"The ultimate freeway experience" is how City Councilwoman Joy Picus terms it. 
</P>
<P>
On a morning when all traffic on the Hollywood Freeway had been reduced to a 
still-life, a woman driver in a neighboring lane began signaling to get the 
attention of Picus and her aide, Mark Newell. 
</P>
<P>
"I rolled down my window," Picus said. "It was so unexpected that at first I 
couldn't understand what she was saying. She said, 'Would you mind calling my 
office and telling them I'm going to be late for the deposition? My name is 
Sharon.' She gave us the number -- and we phoned for her."

Azusa Mayor Eugene Moses had an exciting Halloween Eve. He found a tarantula in 
his bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor trapped the hairy intruder in a bottle and summoned police, who made 
the pinch. Moses, who has feuded with other city officials, expressed some 
suspicions about the timing of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
But Azusa Lt. Felix Noriega -- "that's Felix, not Manuel; and lieutenant, not 
general," the officer emphasized -- pointed out that His Honor lives "at the 
base of the foothills," where such critters reside. 
</P>
<P>
With no real basis for holding the tarantula, police released it -- in a nearby 
canyon.

<P>
I read the columns by Pete Wilson and Dianne Feinstein (Commentary, Oct. 23) on 
what each intends to do about education in California, and commend them both 
for their serious commitment to early childhood education. Just teaching the 
little ones how to speak English well will raise their chances of absorbing 
what is being taught in the classroom later on. 
</P>
<P>
However, I was shocked that neither of them mentioned teacher quality, the most 
important factor in giving children a good education. If money is to be set 
aside for education, it should go into searches among high school students for 
good teaching material (as they search for good athletic material), and 
teaching scholarships at least commensurate with athletic scholarships; 
enhancing teaching as a sought-after career, and providing salaries for 
teachers to teach what they know best and are happiest doing. 
</P>
<P>
Good teachers need to be found and nurtured. Both Feinstein and Wilson urged 
funds for building new schools. Children do not need new buildings; in many 
cases, old ones can be renovated. Buildings we have aplenty, but good teachers 
are diamonds waiting to be polished.

LOS ANGELES HOUSING BONDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I take issue with your endorsement of Prop. K, the $100-million general 
obligation housing bond issue on Tuesday's ballot (editorial, Oct. 26). 
</P>
<P>
The solution to the costly social problems of homelessness and the lack of 
affordable housing is within the domain of the state and federal governments. 
These programs have always been funded with state and federal revenues and 
never, until now, through Prop. K, have homeowners been asked to take this 
burden upon their backs. 
</P>
<P>
Prop. K proposes to tax city homeowners to assist low- and moderate-income 
first-time home buyers, to provide shelters for the homeless and to help 
nonprofit organizations bring buildings up to earthquake standards. All of this 
is already available through the California Housing Finance Agency, which was 
created by legislation I co-authored in the state Senate in 1975, and by new 
and increased funding available through the U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
Just this week, Congress -- being fully aware of the housing problem in this 
country and being equally aware of its responsibility in this regard -- passed 
the first major overhaul of federal housing policy in 10 years and allocated 
$57.4 billion to help low- and moderate-income families obtain decent housing. 
The bill includes nearly $8 billion in renewed subsidized housing, more than $3 
billion in increased block grants to local governments to provide affordable 
housing programs (including earthquake renovation), $772 million to help 
first-time home buyers finance their homes and much, much more. 
</P>
<P>
Why should city homeowners pay for these programs twice? I agree that the lack 
of affordable housing in this city is a problem, but I believe Prop. K is an 
inappropriate method of solving it.

U.S. MISSION IN THE GULF

<TEXT>
<P>
The gulf crisis is the product of a joint venture by Saddam Hussein and George 
Bush. The people of America and Iraq as well as other nationalities trapped in 
Iraq and Kuwait are in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
God forbid, but if war breaks out, the colossal loss of human lives is 
inevitable. Prior to shots being fired it is essential to consider with utmost 
care the plight of the hostages held by Hussein as human shields. If it is 
decided that destruction of Hussein and his forces is more beneficial than the 
precious lives of hostages, the invasion of Iraq can be justified. If not, ways 
and means for a peaceful settlement through dialogue and diplomacy should be 
initiated. Why doesn't the United Nations take charge of the crisis?

EFFORTS TO END GANG VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Sen. Art Torres' (D-Los Angeles) call for renewed war on gangs 
in East Los Angeles (Metro, Oct. 26): 
</P>
<P>
This "war" can only be won by combining a strong, strategically directed 
law-enforcement approach with motivated and active community volunteers mixed 
with comprehensive prevention and intervention programs, all operating in 
unison. This has been the approach in the Los Angeles Police Department South 
Bureau, where we have seen a gradual but promising reversal of the gang 
violence trend. 
</P>
<P>
For the past two years there has been unprecedented cooperation among various 
entities including the city attorney, the Parks and Recreation Department, the 
Los Angeles Unified School District, LAPD South Bureau and Community Youth Gang 
Services South Region personnel. More than 300 volunteers have come forward to 
take back parks and schools and to reclaim the community, including the youth. 
It is by no means enough! 
</P>
<P>
This kind of cooperation has been in operation in East Los Angeles under the 
auspices of the East Los Angeles Inter-Agency Gang Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned Parents, a group of dedicated mothers who share the distinction of 
losing one or more children to gang killings, along with the East Los Angeles 
Sheriff's, the Probation Department, CYGS and others reduced gang homicides to 
zero for all of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
While CYGS did concentrate our forces in South-Central Los Angeles beginning in 
1988, Supervisor Ed Edelman is again building up various agency forces to 
continue and increase the strategic attack on gang violence in East Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Whether someone's child is murdered in East Los Angeles or in South-Central Los 
Angeles, the horrifying loss is felt just as deeply. More funding must be 
provided in a comprehensive coordinated approach to solve the problem of gangs 
throughout Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Only then will we begin to see a decrease in gang violence as well as 
decreasingthe exportation of gang violence to other cities.

Alexander Cockburn's article "Stand Fast for Talk, Not Battle" is excellent 
(Column Left, Commentary, Oct. 21). 
</P>
<P>
I agree we should say no to Iraq's grab of Kuwait, no to a U.S. war and no to 
double standards about which land grabs and invasions the U.S. chooses to 
denounce. I believe we should say yes to the countries and to the United 
Nations who are trying their utmost to remedy the complex issues in the Persian 
Gulf with a peaceful settlement. 
</P>
<P>
A war wouldn't settle the difficult problems in the area. A war would just 
delay the settlement of international difficulties. The American people don't 
want war with its unbelievable horrors and inhumanities for all concerned.

I gather that Anthony Day (Commentary, Oct. 20) believes that the "new world 
order" is worth sending American troops into battle for, something much loftier 
than cheap oil. 
</P>
<P>
Does that concept rank even higher than making the world safe for democracy and 
fighting a war to end all wars? If you look beneath the surface, you might find 
that oil was involved in those debacles as well. 
</P>
<P>
Would this quest for peace require us to surrender our sovereignty to the moral 
authority of the United Nations? If that's the plan, then American voters need 
to address this issue directly. 
</P>
<P>
Let us not be so anxious to jump from the frying pan into the fire.

Is this the best that the left can do? Speaking as a "red diaper" baby, I 
remember asking my father why he went to war with Hitler and I remember his 
answer: "Because Hitler had to be stopped and war was the only way. There was 
no other alternative." 
</P>
<P>
He went to war, not rashly, but deliberately, reading his copy of Walt Whitman 
to sustain him. 
</P>
<P>
I can now see why the left is ineffective. It wants the easy way out; to look 
good without the pain of being good. This is what the left should be saying: 
</P>
<P>
Liberate Kuwait -- I cannot justify inaction when a population is being 
systematically destroyed. I hear nothing from the left of the plight of Sri 
Lankans, Indians, Egyptians, as well as Kuwaitis being tortured and murdered. 
Do we only liberate white Europeans? 
</P>
<P>
Do not invade Iraq -- Continue the embargo even after Kuwait is liberated and 
extend it to include Western technicians without whose help Western technology 
does not work. Continue the military embargo even after Iraq has a government 
that does not torture and kill its population. I'm sure all hostages held at 
strategic installations in Iraq would prefer this policy. 
</P>
<P>
I am appalled at the racism and envy of the left. This is not what my father 
and his generation did.

PROP. 128'S EFFECT ON WATER SUPPLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Much has been written about the Hayden Initiative, Proposition 128, in recent 
weeks. However, very little has been said about its effect on Southern 
California's water. 
</P>
<P>
I am particularly concerned about the very real possibility of a substantial 
reduction in the water available to Southern California from Northern 
California. Your readers should know that in much of Southern California, 100% 
of all domestic water is imported either from Northern California via the State 
Water Project or from the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 128 mandates "full protection and propagation of fish, shellfish 
and their habitat." This would undoubtedly mean diversion of water to San 
Francisco Bay from the State Water Project, thereby reducing water available 
for distribution to consumers. Real people will be shortchanged. People need 
water. 
</P>
<P>
After four years of drought, water is already in short supply in Southern 
California despite aggressive voluntary conservation. Mandatory cutbacks will 
be required if our drought continues into its fifth year. Public water 
suppliers are developing alternates to imported water; however, many of these 
are unreasonably costly or are limited in quantity. 
</P>
<P>
One successful alternative currently used to reduce our need for imported water 
is to reclaim water for non-domestic purposes. This is both economical and 
available. Proposition 128's stringent restrictions on the use of chlorine will 
tend to eliminate the use of reclaimed water as an economic alternative. This 
would further compound our shortage. 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, the Coastal Municipal 
Water District, the Municipal Water District of Orange County (the major 
wholesale suppliers), most of the retail water agencies in Orange County, the 
Assn. of California Water Agencies, and the Water Advisory Committee of Orange 
County have all adopted resolutions opposing Proposition 128 for these reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Other parts of the proposition may be desirable, but its negative effect on 
Southern California water would be pervasive. Your readers should know the 
facts before they decide.

MEASURE C MUDDLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A political dirty trick is being foisted on the people of Huntington Beach. The 
trick: Paid telephone solicitors are identifying themselves as calling for Save 
Our Parks and urging support for Measure D and the developer candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The truth: Save Our Parks is the group that founded Measure C, the Citizens' 
Charter Amendment. Measure C gives the citizens a direct vote before the 
pro-developer City Council majority can lease away our beachfront for 
35-foot-high restaurants and Central Park for hotels, large restaurants, 
amusement parks, etc. The public has the right to participate in decisions 
regarding major commercialization of their parks and beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Save Our Parks rejects Measure D (the developers' measure) as a fraud that was 
put on the ballot by the pro-developer City Council majority with the intent of 
deceiving the voters. Save Our Parks supports Measure C and the slate of Grace 
Winchell, Mark Porter and Linda Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
Don't be fooled: Measure C represents citizens. Measure D represents 
developers.

PLAYERS NOT GUILTY, BUT USC BAND IS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Nancy Rothenberg (Oct. 27) concerning the three USC football 
players "charged" with sexual battery, am I missing something or are these 
young men not citizens of the United States, where one is presumed innocent 
until proven guilty? If they are found guilty, fine, boot 'em out and use my 
boot. But let's wait for the verdict. The Constitution is for all of us, not 
just non-athletes.

<P>
I would like to respond to the letter of Oct. 27 from Mr. Butler concerning the 
USC band. 
</P>
<P>
Come on. "Tribute to Troy"? "School songs"? "A band the university can be proud 
of"? Don't you mean "Tribute to repetition," "School song" and "a band the 
university should do something about"? 
</P>
<P>
Let's face it. "The Song" is no longer inspiring. The results of the football 
team will attest to this. How about a "Tribute to Mercy"?

Once my anger subsided after watching the latest heavyweight championship 
debacle, it became clear to me what the problem is and what the solution is. 
</P>
<P>
Give the challenger a guaranteed $1 million. Give the champion a guaranteed $2 
million. Give the winner the rest of the purse, be it $30 million, $50 million 
or $100 million. Then you'll see how fast Buster or any other fighter will get 
off the canvas after a knockdown.

THOROUGHBRED RACING TAKES A TRAGIC FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After watching the Breeders' Cup, I have changed my view on horse racing. 
</P>
<P>
Is it fair for us to use these innocent animals and put their bodies through 
such treacherous torment merely for our own entertainment and gambling 
pleasure? Three horses were killed on this same day because of our own selfish 
enjoyment. 
</P>
<P>
Although horses are born to run, we should not force them to run and increase 
their risk of a fatal injury, whether it be a heart attack or a broken bone. 
Until enough of us decide to ban such a heartless sport, this cruelty to 
animals will continue and more innocent horses' lives will be lost.

I wish to respond to some of the recent letters depicting Martin Bernheimer as 
jaded and an overcritical critic. Although, as we know, it is his job to give 
an objective and critiqued account of the operas we all so love, it is also his 
job to pillar high standards of the stage, to keep Mozart Mozart and not Piggly 
Wiggly pop. 
</P>
<P>
I found the "dreamscape" sequence and 16th-Century wigs in "Idomeneo" a little 
too cute. 
</P>
<P>
I have never found Bernheimer vicious, or perhaps I have never found him 
vicious enough. His critiques are always constructive. That is, something could 
be done to improve the play. 
</P>
<P>
In my opinion, Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Times are fortunate to have him.

FACES . . .: TONY WINNER, SITCOM STAR RALPH NOW SETS HER SIGHTS ON MOVIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheryl Lee Ralph has already conquered Broadway -- winning a Tony nomination 
for her performance in the 1981 landmark musical "Dreamgirls" -- and headlined 
two sitcoms, "It's a Living" and "New Attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Now she is making her bid for movie stardom. 
</P>
<P>
The actress is starring opposite Danny Glover in Charles Burnett's critically 
acclaimed first feature, "To Sleep With Anger," as a materialistic wife and 
mother whose life changes when an old family friend (Glover) meddles with the 
relationships among a family. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a review from somebody," says Ralph, "and they said I was 'intelligently 
sexy.' And I said, 'Yeah, that's it.' It's a wonderful thing to be able to 
combine those two things not only in life, but in film." 
</P>
<P>
The actress also has won the coveted starring role in "Romuald and Juliette," 
the American remake of the French farce, "Mama, There's a Man in Your Bed," 
about a married white executive who falls in love with his company's black 
cleaning woman. 
</P>
<P>
Difficulties in casting the male lead have pushed production into 1991. "I 
would be hard pressed to say why they haven't found an actor," says Ralph. 
</P>
<P>
But she says someone told her it was a race issue: "It just made me see that 
women are further down on the totem pole than we thought. I said (to the 
person), 'You mean to tell me that people are entertaining the idea that the 
reason why a white leading male actor would not take this role is because I am 
an upcoming black female actress?' If that is not one of the most sexist, 
racist things ever said to me, I don't know what else to say about the industry 
or the nation I live in -- both of which I love so deeply."SUSAN KING

HEAVY CRITICISM UNFAIR TO 'CALIFORNIA LIGHT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In spite of Cathy Curtis' flippant "Ho-Hum" critique, I went to see the exhibit 
and I found it beautiful! 
</P>
<P>
A good art critic puts aside his or her personal preferences when judging art. 
Curtis does not do this. She uses ridicule and should stop her silly comments 
about "expecting a broadly sociological look at the connection between art and 
sun-dazzled land." 
</P>
<P>
You owe an apology to these fine artists of another era, when beauty was not 
ridiculed.

Not having been to a New Kids concert I cannot honestly say what their concert 
style is like, but I can say that if it's like their "Hanging Tough" or "Live 
at Your House" specials on Disney, then it's not as bad as you say. 
</P>
<P>
Saying that Jonathan Knight was a candidate for the Andrew Ridgely award for 
superfluous presence in a pop act was uncalled for. 
</P>
<P>
He holds the group together and doesn't need to be in the limelight. When I 
told my 9-year-old cousin what superfluous meant, she was upset. Jonathan is 
her favorite because he is shy and quiet. 
</P>
<P>
(And as for) saying that maybe fans and their parents should stop wasting money 
on New Kids paraphernalia, I would rather my cousin buy New Kids paraphernalia 
than drugs on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Have you ever really listened to the words of the New Kids songs? Up until 
their last album, I never even heard them cuss. Their one cuss word is hell. 
How many times a day does the average kid hear that word (from his or her) 
parents? 
</P>
<P>
What right do you have to judge people you don't even know? Calling Donnie a 
lout was in my opinion unprofessional. Do you know him enough to call him a 
lout? I wouldn't judge you on what you wrote about the New Kids. How can you 
judge them on one concert?

You have some nerve, Mister. I happened to be at the (New Kids) concert. It was 
not a waste of energy to us, them or anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
The only waste of energy was you writing this stupid article. 
</P>
<P>
In the part where you said we fans would scream at almost anything, even the 
stagehands' pre-show adjustment and so on, that was ridiculous. We only 
screamed because we knew the New Kids were coming on soon. 
</P>
<P>
They gave it their all, and we loved it. Donnie went on stage and yelled, 
"Drugs suck!" Now what singer would go on stage and say that? We were very 
grateful to him (and so were many parents). We thank him. Jonathan loves to 
perform, but like many people he doesn't feel comfortable around humongous 
groups. Yes, Jordan is the best singer in the group. He dances great. They all 
can sing. Yes, even Danny Wood. He's a great singer. Joe McIntyre by far did 
the best and most entertaining job of all. We practically died each time he 
came out. 
</P>
<P>
For all I know, you probably didn't even go to the concert. 
</P>
<P>
Donnie said, "Don't take it when people are disrespectful to you or us." So 
"Shut Up!" and Donnie told me to say it.

<P>
A Houston jury refused to find the Roman Catholic Church negligent in a 
$7-million suit filed by a woman who had had a two-year sexual relationship 
with a priest. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors deliberated just three hours before rejecting the claim of Debbie 
McCorvey, 34, that the church was negligent in allowing Father Fernando Noe 
Guzman to exploit her dependence on him as a counselor. McCorvey, a religion 
teacher, claimed church officials were at fault for not making sure Guzman, 39, 
received therapy after his alleged sexual involvement with a 13-year-old girl. 
Church officials argued that McCorvey's relationship with Guzman was 
consensual.

<P>
The scarred woman known as the Central Park jogger was cross-examined for the 
first time since she was gang-raped and nearly beaten to death. One defense 
lawyer refused to question her, but the other asked about her sex life, her job 
competence, her physical condition, her memory and whether she had been 
assaulted by the men in her life. 
</P>
<P>
Many of his questions were not answered because the prosecution's objections 
were sustained. Two of six teen-agers indicted in the attack are on trial now 
on charges of rape, assault and attempted murder. The lawyer for defendant 
Kharey Wise suggested that the woman's injuries were less serious than the 
prosecution claimed and that a man she knew might have attacked her.

A woman who said she was desperate when she went to the men's room at a concert 
was found not guilty of illegally using the restroom. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors deliberated for 23 minutes before acquitting Denise Wells of violating a 
Houston ordinance that prohibits people from using restrooms intended for 
members of the opposite sex in a manner calculated to cause a disturbance. She 
faced a maximum $200 fine if convicted of the misdemeanor. Wells testified that 
the women's room line was so long that "I felt I was in a situation where I had 
to be in a restroom. I took the only option I felt was available."

The long-anticipated Trump divorce became more than just gossip when Ivana 
Trump's lawyer announced that, "with deep regret," she was filing for a divorce 
from her developer husband, Donald. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't clear when the papers would be filed. The couple separated in 
February amid a flurry of publicity over Donald Trump's relationship with 
model-actress Marla Maples. "Mrs. Trump and I have discussed our situation and 
have mutually agreed that it would be appropriate for her to file for divorce," 
Trump said in a statement. The Trumps married 13 years ago and have three 
children.

CLEAN AIR: THE PROPOSED $300 YEARLY INCENTIVES COULD BE A MODEL FOR PRIVATE 
COMPANIES THAT MUST FIND WAYS TO ENCOURAGE RIDE-SHARING.

Ventura County officials may dangle a $300 carrot in front of county workers to 
entice them into leaving their cars at home when they go to work. 
</P>
<P>
All that the employees would have to do is car-pool, ride a bus, bicycle or 
walk to work an average of three days a week for 48 weeks. By Christmas, 1991, 
they would receive a check for $300. 
</P>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors will consider the cash incentive program 
Tuesday. If it is approved, the program will kick off just before Thanksgiving, 
and the city would join a small but growing number of private companies and 
public agencies that are beginning to offer incentives for employees to find 
ways to get to work other than driving alone. 
</P>
<P>
A cash incentive is one of the strategies in the county's plan for cutting air 
pollution by reducing the number of cars the county's 6,000 employees drive to 
work. The plan could be a prototype for private companies with 100 or more 
employees, which must come up with their own proposals in the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
The plans are being adopted to help the county comply with state and federal 
clean air laws. The county is under a federal court order to clean up its air, 
which ranks sixth worst in the nation for ozone pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to hand out cash incentives comes at a time when the county is 
strapped for money because of state funding cuts. Yet county officials say the 
program is worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
"A massive effort is needed to clean up the air," said Richard Wittenberg, the 
county's chief administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
Simply asking people to leave their cars at home isn't enough, he said. 
However, the county is choosing the carrot approach over the stick, he said. 
"This is the best way even in tight budget times." 
</P>
<P>
The program is designed along the lines of the county's wellness program, which 
attracted about 2,000 employees who earned $200 or $300 for improving their 
health. The county hopes that a similar number will elect cash over their cars. 
If so, the county is prepared to shell out about $500,000 a year in cash 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
The top prize is $300 for those employees who leave their cars at home an 
average of three days a week, but $200 would be given to those who average at 
least two days a week. 
</P>
<P>
The program depends on the honor system, said Marty Shaw-Halloway, the county's 
manager of special projects. Employees must sign a statement acknowledging that 
they will be disciplined if they falsify information about their car-pooling 
efforts. Car-pool drivers and riders must keep daily records of their 
ride-sharing efforts, and the quarterly reports must be signed by a supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
As of last March, there were 47 registered car-pools carrying 109 county 
employees to work, county records show. Commuting county employees average 1.2 
people per car -- a number the county must raise to 1.35 under Rule 210, the 
plan the county adopted requiring large employers to devise ways to reduce the 
number of commuting cars on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County may need to be creative when it comes to getting people out of 
their cars. Other communities, such as Los Angeles, have more smog, more 
traffic congestion, tighter parking restrictions and a larger public transit 
system -- all strong, visible incentives to car-pool, Shaw-Halloway said. 
</P>
<P>
"Things that push people in Los Angeles and Orange County into car-pooling 
aren't here," she said. "We're asking people to make a lifestyle change," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw-Halloway said a number of private companies in the county are beginning to 
offer incentives to car-pool. Some provide vans or free parking. Some use a 
point system and reward ride-sharing with gifts, while others might offer a 
drawing for prizes. 
</P>
<P>
She knew of no company in the county offering a straight cash incentive such as 
the one the county is considering. 
</P>
<P>
However, such incentives are not that unusual in the Los Angeles area, said 
Paula Levy, spokeswoman for the South Coast Air Quality Management District, 
which covers Los Angeles, Riverside, Orange and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
She said her own agency, which has 1,000 employees, offers workers $60 a month 
if they use the bus, bicycle, walk or van-pool to work. Those who car-pool get 
as much as $55 a month.

MAYOR WITHDRAWS HOUSING SUPPORT OVER LAWSUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The future of one of the largest affordable housing projects in Ventura has 
been placed in jeopardy because of recently discovered information about a 
pattern of lawsuits involving the project's developer, Mayor Richard Francis 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Francis said the extensive litigation involving the head of KNM Development 
Inc., which had won tentative approval to build 147 affordable housing units in 
east Ventura, has convinced him to drop his support of the project. 
</P>
<P>
Ernest T. Mansi, the head of KNM, and the companies he controls have been sued 
at least 10 times over the past six years for allegedly mishandling other 
development projects in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
"My fear is that the KNM project will never be completed and we will end up 
with an eyesore," Francis added. 
</P>
<P>
Mansi could not be reached for comment at KNM offices in Oxnard and Camarillo 
Friday, but Francis said he met with the developer early in the day and was 
told by Mansi that there is no legitimate reason for the city to drop its 
support of the project. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he had an explanation for everything," Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Mansi submitted a letter to the city explaining his role in 11 
lawsuits and generally denying any financial irresponsibility or negligence in 
past construction projects. In some cases, the letter states that Mansi was 
victimized by the actions of his partners. In other cases, the letter simply 
states that the cases were settled. 
</P>
<P>
KNM had received tentative approval from the City Council on Oct. 15 to build 
the 147-unit project on the southeast corner of the intersection of Telegraph 
Road and Reata Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 applicants have signed up for the houses, which would cost about 
$146,800 for the three-bedroom units and $176,900 for the four-bedroom units, 
Community Development Director Everett Millais said. 
</P>
<P>
The council withheld final approval of the project pending a redesign of the 
tract's traffic circulation pattern. The required changes were deemed so minor 
that City Atty. Peter Bulens said the council was not required to hold a public 
hearing next Monday when the project is scheduled to be considered for final 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure glad the project was sent back for redesign," said Francis, who had 
moved without council support to approve the project without any changes. After 
Francis' motion failed, the council voted 4 to 2 in favor of tentatively 
approving the project and sending it back to the planning staff for minor 
modifications. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John McWherter voted against the motion because he said it would 
bring too much development to the city. Francis voted against the motion 
because, although he supported the project, he did not favor the traffic 
modifications that were being proposed. Councilman Gary Tuttle abstained, 
citing a conflict of interest because he was distantly related to one of 
Mansi's partners. 
</P>
<P>
Francis said he decided to withdraw his support for the KNM development after 
receiving information from a neighbor Wednesday listing more than 30 lawsuits 
involving the head of KNM. Francis, who works as a private attorney in addition 
to serving as mayor, said he was able to trace at least 10 of those suits 
directly to Mansi. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing the list of lawsuits and speaking to some of the attorneys 
involved in those cases, he determined that allowing the KNM projects to go 
through would be too risky, Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
While no evidence of wrongdoing was discovered, Francis said there were so many 
allegations against Mansi that he felt uncomfortable about granting the project 
final approval. 
</P>
<P>
"What I see is a lot of smoke and you know the old adage," Francis said. "For 
the city to be involved in a project of this magnitude, that requires a 
presumption of credibility and confidence that all but guarantees the 
deliverability of the project as planned." 
</P>
<P>
Francis said he is particularly concerned about Mansi's role in two nursing 
home projects, one in Lompoc and another in Santa Paula, which were never 
built. Francis said he was also concerned about a condominium project in Oxnard 
for which Mansi had done the engineering studies. The mayor said that, months 
later, a roof caved in. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Cathy Bean, who was also informed of Mansi's legal disputes and 
who earlier voted in favor of the project, said she too will now vote to 
withhold approval of the KNM project until all doubts are eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something we didn't know beforehand," Bean said of the lawsuits. "We 
will need more information before we proceed any further." 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they do not check the legal backgrounds of developers 
seeking to build in the city. "We just make sure all the documents are correct 
and that the actions the City Council takes are correct," Bulens said. 
</P>
<P>
Millais added, "When we do our plan checks, it doesn't really matter whether 
the developer is involved in a lawsuit or not, but in this case the developer 
appears to be involved in a lot of lawsuits, and that always invites 
suspicion."

BUS BENCH ART WITHIN NEA GUIDELINES; 
</P>
<P>
FUROR: GOVERNMENT ARTS ORGANIZATION NEVERTHELESS PLANS TO INVESTIGATE USE OF 
FUNDS TO CREATE WORKS CRITICAL OF SAN DIEGO POLICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Four San Diego artists who used federal funds to pay for bus-bench ads that 
protest deadly force shootings by police were operating within guidelines set 
forth by the National Endowment for the Arts, according to documents obtained 
by The Times on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, officials for the embattled NEA said Friday that they intend to 
investigate the artists for what appears to be, in the words of national 
spokesman Jack Lichtenstein, "a most inappropriate use of NEA funds." 
</P>
<P>
The NEA agreed to investigate the artists after a request from Rep. Bill Lowery 
(R-San Diego), who said that it was "highly unusual and improper for artists to 
take NEA money and buy commercial advertising, regardless of its content." 
</P>
<P>
But, according to the $12,500 grant issued to the artists through the 
Installations Gallery of San Diego, $4,000 is budgeted for "media advertising," 
as well as printing and direct mailing. The ads themselves cost $3,662.50. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the clear wording of the grant, which functions as a contract, Lowery 
received a letter Friday from Rose M. DiNapoli, the NEA's congressional 
liaison, informing him that the investigation will continue. DiNapoli wrote 
that NEA officials will determine whether Installations Gallery "is in 
compliance with the terms and conditions of the grant award." 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, DiNapoli wrote that she regrets the published comments of 
Virginia Falck, an NEA press aide, who made statements supportive of the 
artists and their adherence to the terms of the grant. 
</P>
<P>
"The views attributed to her would have been premature," DiNapoli's letter 
states. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Sisco, one of the artists involved, said Friday that she had received 
assurances from Loris Bradley of the Inter-Arts division of the NEA -- which 
granted the four their funding -- that "we have done nothing wrong." Bradley 
was unavailable for comment, but Sisco said she couldn't understand why 
Bradley's assurances were in such "stark contrast" to what national spokesman 
Lichtenstein said publicly. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, the inquiry is still going on and will for a while," 
Lichtenstein said Friday. "I don't know who they (the artists) talked with, but 
I haven't heard anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think there's a problem," artist Louis Hock said. "We did exactly 
what we said we would do in the grant." 
</P>
<P>
The NEA-approved agreement allows the artists "to extend our exploration of the 
way art can illuminate contradictions and act as a catalyst for local debate," 
the grant reads. 
</P>
<P>
The artists have said they used $3,662.50 of a $12,500 NEA grant to rent space 
on 25 area bus benches through Coast United Advertising of Commerce, Calif. 
Arlan Renfro, president of the company, said the check he received was from the 
account of Scott Kessler Public Relations. Kessler is one of the artists who 
produced the work. 
</P>
<P>
Even the ad itself carries the wording, "Partially funded through a grant from 
the National Endowment for the Arts." The artists say they donated their time 
and materials to produce the ads but used NEA money to rent space on 25 
benches, which are scattered throughout San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The ads are in protest of the police policies that the artists say have left 
nine people dead and 14 wounded in so-called "deadly-force" shootings. The 
artists have called for a stronger police review board, namely one with 
subpoena powers. 
</P>
<P>
The ads were denounced almost immediately by San Diego Police Chief Bob 
Burgreen and the police officers' association, as well as by several local 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
The furor over the ads escalated Friday with Ronald Newman, president of the 
1,750-member San Diego Police Officers Assn., writing a letter of complaint to 
nine high-ranking congressmen over the use of federal funds in paying for the 
ads. Newman called the use of NEA grant money for political purposes "patently 
unfair to all citizens." 
</P>
<P>
But the grant apparently allowed the artists to use the money that way. Joy 
Silverman, director of the National Campaign for Freedom of Expression, said 
Friday from Washington that the high-level political battle now being waged 
within the NEA has caught the San Diego artists in a cross-fire. 
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, as soon as somebody criticizes the Endowment, you have somebody 
saying, 'OK, we'll check that out right away, we'll get right on it!' " she 
said. "They're constantly bowing to forces from the Jesse Helms-inspired far 
right, rather than serving the American public and the American arts community. 
They're trying to address these volatile politics, rather than the needs of 
American constituents." 
</P>
<P>
Silverman said she knows of several NEA-funded artists whose work has been 
reproduced on commercial billboards, as per the terms of their grants. She 
listed an AIDS exhibit and a piece critical of the mass media as examples. 
</P>
<P>
The art on the 25 bus benches features the outline of seven human bodies 
silhouetted in black against a red background. Within each figure is a target, 
similar to those at police shooting ranges. 
</P>
<P>
Within one target is a trowel, within another a baseball bat and within a third 
a garden stake. A pair of upraised hands and a question mark are drawn within 
others. Among those killed in deadly-force shootings were men wielding a 
baseball bat, a garden stake and a trowel. Another man was unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, two of the 25 bus-bench ads -- those closest to San Diego 
police headquarters at 1401 Broadway -- have been defaced in ways the artists 
say are "pro-police." One bench now bears the graffito -- "Kops Are OK," and, 
attached to another are replicas of two badges and the names of two officers 
killed in the line of duty.

COUNTY GAS PRICES SOAR TO A RECORD; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: AUGUST'S KUWAITI INVASION IS BLAMED. OFFICIALS SAY BUS 
RIDERSHIP HAS ALSO INCREASED BY 40,000 OVER A YEAR AGO.

<P>
Gasoline prices in Ventura County are at record highs, with prices of premium 
grades soaring to within pennies of the $2-per-gallon mark at some stations. 
</P>
<P>
Price increases imposed by major oil companies since Iraq invaded Kuwait also 
have been blamed for the shutdown of at least one county gas station, and more 
dealers expect to mothball pumps in coming weeks because of trench-war 
competition at the retail level. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a good living in this business eight to 10 years ago, but today I'm on 
the verge of bankruptcy," said Tony DaCosta, the owner of a Ventura Union 76 
outlet who recently closed a Texaco station he operated for nearly seven years. 
"I put my entire savings into this business yesterday to keep it alive." 
</P>
<P>
He had to close the Texaco station, he said, because the wholesale price 
charged by Texaco was higher than some other stations' retail prices. 
</P>
<P>
A random survey of 60 Ventura County stations Thursday found self-serve prices 
for 87-octane unleaded -- the most popular grade of gas -- ranging from $1.319 
per gallon at a Quality Gas station in Simi Valley to $1.559 a gallon at a 
Ventura Union 76. The price of full-serve premium unleaded exceeded $1.90 at 
several outlets. 
</P>
<P>
The soaring cost of keeping car engines running has led many motorists to use 
mass transit. Ridership in the South Coast Transit District rose by 40,000 
passengers in October from the same month a year ago, and district officials 
estimate that half of the new riders boarded buses in response to gas prices. 
</P>
<P>
"People aren't locking up their cars and throwing away the keys, but they are 
realizing there's times when they don't need to use their car," said Maureen 
Lopez, the transit district's director of planning and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Those who are still driving are turning more and more to credit cards for gas 
purchases and racking up debt for what used to be an out-of-pocket expense. Don 
Gurke, owner of an Oxnard Unocal 76, said credit card sales account for nearly 
70% of his business, compared with about 50% before August's invasion of 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Trilby Lundberg, publisher of the Lundberg Letter, which monitors fuel prices 
nationwide, said retail gas prices throughout Southern California have topped 
their previous high set during the 1979 oil shortage. However, today's prices 
are pinching consumers less when inflation is taken into account, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Off-brand outlets, particularly several Quality and USA Petroleum stations, 
offered some of the lowest pump prices in Ventura County on Thursday. Among 
major producers, Arco on the average continues to offer the cheapest prices, 
while Unocal stations on the whole ranked as the most expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Self-serve leaded gas at the surveyed stations ranged from $1.299 to $1.449 per 
gallon and self-serve premium unleaded from $1.459 to $1.739. Full-serve 
per-gallon prices ranged from $1.329 to $1.749 for leaded, from $1.499 to 
$1.849 for regular unleaded and from $1.599 to $1.949 for premium unleaded. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are being slapped in the face seeing prices go up, but at 
least this isn't the European marketplace," said Chad Hargett, a Ventura 
Chevron station owner. "People have a real love here for their automobiles, and 
now they're paying for it."

HOSPITAL SHACKLED MENTALLY ILL MAN FOR 6 DAYS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH CARE: PSYCHIATRIST WOULDN'T ADMIT PATIENT, SO HE WAS RESTRAINED IN 
PALOMAR MEDICAL CENTER'S EMERGENCY ROOM UNTIL HEALTH ADVOCATE INTERVENED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A 39-year-old mentally ill man was shackled on an emergency room gurney for 
most of six days last month at Palomar Medical Center, because the attending 
psychiatrist wouldn't authorize his admission to a psychiatric bed at the 
hospital, the county's patient advocate for the mentally ill said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
It was only after the patient advocate appealed to county mental health and 
state licensing officials on Oct. 16 and 17 that the man was placed in an 
appropriate medical environment. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe this, and I was very fearful for him," said patient 
advocate Richard Danford. "I've worked in mental health for 13 years and this 
guy just looked terrible. He was in real bad shape, and I wanted something to 
be done about it." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, if it hadn't been for a state law requiring a legal hearing for any mental 
patient held involuntarily beyond 72 hours, Danford might not have learned 
about the man's plight at all, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He reported the situation to the state attorney general's office as suspected 
abuse of a dependent adult, and state health care licensing officials were also 
called in. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego inspector, Eleanor Bray, found Palomar to be in violation of 
state codes requiring that involuntary mental patients be kept in the least 
restrictive, and most therapeutically beneficial, environment. 
</P>
<P>
The man's hands and feet were kept bound in leather restraints without the 
psychiatrist's written authorization, Bray found. "There is no documentation in 
the emergency room record that alternative methods were considered," her 
inspection report said. 
</P>
<P>
He was walked to the bathroom only five times over six days, his medical record 
indicated. The "may have contributed to the subsequent development of a 
pseudoileus," Bray reported. 
</P>
<P>
A pseudoileus is a form of severe constipation. Psychiatric medication can also 
cause the condition. 
</P>
<P>
The man, who had been previously hospitalized at Palomar for paranoid 
schizophrenia, was brought to the hospital by police about 3 a.m. Oct. 11 
because he allegedly had threatened his father with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
A psychiatrist on Palomar's staff declined to authorize the man's admission to 
the hospital, however, because he "was too potentially dangerous and they had a 
sensitive milieu" in the psychiatric unit, Danford said he was told later at a 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Danford said he learned elsewhere that another "justification for not admitting 
him to Palomar was that this guy abused the system." He had been hospitalized 
at Palomar for schizophrenia at least twice before. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor's refusal to admit the man stuck the emergency room with him. He had 
already been legally determined to be dangerous to himself or others, a step 
that authorizes involuntary detention for up to 72 hours, so he could not be 
released under state law. 
</P>
<P>
"Here they had assessed this guy, put him on hold and then one of their own 
doctors refuses to admit him," Danford said. 
</P>
<P>
After the 72-hour hold expired, the hospital again certified the man for 
another 14-day involuntary detention, but he still was left in the emergency 
room. 
</P>
<P>
The Palomar psychiatrist wanted the man taken to the county's adult mental 
health hospital on Rosecrans Street, Danford said. However, the man was 
eligible for Medi-Cal coverage. This put him at the bottom of the list for 
getting into the overburdened county hospital, since its 62 beds are reserved 
for people who have no coverage at all. 
</P>
<P>
After Danford entered the case on Oct. 16, he asked county hospital officials 
to admit him for humanitarian reasons. They did so after first returning the 
man to Palomar for medical treatment for the suspected pseudoileus. 
</P>
<P>
"He's (at the county hospital) now," Danford said. "He's walking around and 
he's not in restraints and he's doing OK." 
</P>
<P>
Palomar officials would not comment on the case, except to say that they had no 
evidence the patient was ever in a life-threatening situation. Communications 
director Alain Jourdier denied that Palomar has the facilities to treat 
dangerous patients. 
</P>
<P>
But the state inspection report notes that "a seclusion room was available on 
the facility's psychiatric unit." 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the incident, Palomar had specific certification from the county 
as a facility authorized to take involuntary mentally ill people brought there 
by police, said county mental health spokesman Patrick Stalnaker. 
</P>
<P>
Since last month's incident, Palomar has asked to have the designation removed, 
Stalnaker said. 
</P>
<P>
Danford said the incident at Palomar puzzled him, since the hospital's 
psychiatric unit is known as one of the better facilities in the whole county." 
</P>
<P>
It was the doctor's adamant refusal to admit the man to a psychiatric facility 
that had plenty of room for him that was the problem, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The emergency room staff and the mental health staff expressed to me a good 
deal of frustration about the quality of care this man got," Danford said. 
</P>
<P>
The state inspection report noted that an inspection at Palomar last March had 
also found that its emergency room had no policies to ensure that mentally ill 
patients would not be held there beyond 24 hours.

<P>
Motorists seeking to avoid construction-related delays on the Ventura Freeway 
between Reseda and North Hollywood can now turn to the air-waves. 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Transportation is broadcasting traffic advisories 
on 1610-AM to warn motorists of lane, ramp and connector-road closures caused 
by the Ventura Improvement Project, a $76-million road-widening project 
scheduled for ongoing work until early 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The broadcast will air during peak construction periods between Thursday and 
Sunday nights, when post-midnight traffic in certain areas is reduced to a 
single lane in each direction, Caltrans spokeswoman Nora Chopelas said. 
Roadside signs have been erected to alert drivers when the messages are airing. 
</P>
<P>
The information is being broadcast in both English and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
The project, begun last November, will add an additional lane in each direction 
on a 15-mile stretch between Woodland Hills and Universal City. CHRISTOPHER

LIQUID FOUND INSIDE DRAIN IS EXAMINED

<P>
Ventura County officials are testing a dark, oily liquid found in a storm drain 
in Newbury Park to determine whether it is hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
The substance found in the 1200 block of Rancho Conejo Boulevard appears to 
contain a mixture of water and oil products, said Terry Gilday, technical 
services manager of the county's environmental health division. 
</P>
<P>
Results from tests on the sample are expected next week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A construction crew grading a field behind warehouses and assembly plants on 
Rancho Conejo Boulevard discovered a pool of murky water while trying to 
install a storm drain, said Bryan Tapking, a project manager for the Shappell 
development firm, which is building more than 1,200 residences in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The crew stopped work on the drain while county officials inspected the area. 
</P>
<P>
A county environmental health inspector traced the liquid to a high-pressure 
air compressor at Republic Fasteners, a company that manufactures parts for the 
aerospace industry. The company's building is a few hundred feet from the 
contaminated soil. 
</P>
<P>
Gilday said the soil contamination did not extend beyond the area near the 
drain. The material did not enter the Thousand Oaks sewer system. PSYCHE

BOND COULD LEAD TO COLLEGE ARTS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Moorpark College could build a $7-million performing arts building with two 
theaters if voters approve Proposition 143, the Higher Educational Facilities 
Bond Act, on Nov. 6, college officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed building, which has already cost the state $700,000 for 
architectural plans, would have two theaters -- one seating about 400 people 
and the other 100. 
</P>
<P>
If funded, construction is scheduled to begin after July. 
</P>
<P>
Should the bond fail, construction will be delayed, said Larry Lloyd, vice 
president of administrative services. 
</P>
<P>
"The performing arts building would be delayed a year or longer," Lloyd said. 
"But if the state spends $700,000 on working drawings, they won't let them lie 
around too long. It's bad economy. They'll find a way to fund it because it's 
wasted taxpayer money." 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark College would also get $163,000 for handicapped ramps and a second 
elevator in the humanities building. 
</P>
<P>
Other schools in the Ventura County Community College District would also 
benefit. Oxnard College would receive $265,000 toward a new gymnasium and 
Ventura College would get $644,000 to finance plans for a math and science 
complex. GERRY BRAILO SPENCER

LA JOLLA MAN ARRESTED AFTER WIFE FOUND BURIED

Police on Friday unearthed the skeletal remains of a woman buried behind a 
Canoga Park home early Friday, and later arrested her husband, a La Jolla man, 
for murder. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on a tip, authorities uncovered the remains from a 3-foot deep pit in 
the backyard of a single-family residence in the 20600 block of Sherman Way. 
</P>
<P>
Swanston said authorities believe the remains are those of Deborah Lynn Hardy, 
31, who lived at the residence with her husband and two daughters until her 
death, estimated as either late 1985 or early 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Hardy, 46, was taken into custody without incident late Friday at a La 
Jolla apartment he shared with the couple's two children. He was booked without 
bail on suspicion of murder and was transported back to Los Angeles to face 
charges, detective Rick Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they believe Hardy beat his wife to death with a flashlight 
during a domestic dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy never filed a missing person's report on his wife and instead told those 
who inquired that his wife had abandoned the family. 
</P>
<P>
Swanston said Hardy's 22-year-old daughter apparently learned of the slaying 
sometime after the death. Charges were not being sought against her, although 
she did not notify police of the killing, Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
Tests should be able to positively identify the remains within the next two 
weeks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Coroner's Office will positively identify the skeleton, but it is our 
belief they are most likely the remains of Deborah Lynn Hardy," the detective 
said.

<P>
A 6-year-old boy was killed Friday morning when a truck broadsided his mother's 
car at the intersection of Chase Avenue and Anza Street in El Cajon, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
El Cajon firefighters had to extricate Daniel James Long from the passenger 
seat of his mother's 1984 Mercury Cougar, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The El Cajon boy was taken by paramedics to Sharp Memorial Hospital about 8 
a.m., where he died a short time later, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel's mother, Catherine King Long, 27, suffered minor injuries in the 
accident and did not require treatment, police said. The driver of the truck, 
James Bradbury, 22, of El Cajon, was uninjured, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 7:52 a.m. when Catherine Long, traveling east on 
Chase Avenue, attempted to make a left turn north onto Anza, police said. She 
was broadsided by a 1988 Isuzu flatbed truck driven by Bradbury, police said. 
Neither driver was cited.

THE VANISHING SINGLE SCREEN; 
</P>
<P>
LANDMARKS: THE OWNERS OF A 50-YEAR-OLD STUDIO CITY MOVIE HOUSE THAT WILL CLOSE 
IN FEBRUARY REPORTEDLY HAVE NO INTEREST IN RAZING THE BUILDING, WHICH MAY 
BECOME A BOOKSTORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mann's Studio Theatre in Studio City, one of only two operating single-screen 
theaters in the San Fernando Valley, will go dark in February, a victim of the 
burgeoning trend toward multi-screen complexes. 
</P>
<P>
But the 50-year-old landmark may be saved from the wrecking ball and restored 
to its original grandeur. The landlord, a family that has owned the Ventura 
Boulevard property for generations, reportedly has no interest in redeveloping 
the site and hopes to sign a lease with a Texas-based book chain that has 
turned other old theaters into stores. 
</P>
<P>
"They actually have some sentimental attachment to this building," said Bruce 
Bailey, a real estate broker representing owner Ray Rothman and his family. 
</P>
<P>
"They, like a lot of citizens, are against some of the types of developments 
that have gone on and believe that residents should have some say in what goes 
up in the community." 
</P>
<P>
Bailey said the family had originally hoped another motion-picture chain would 
replace Mann Theatres, expected to leave the site in February. 
</P>
<P>
He said Mann decided against renewing the theater's long-term lease because 
single screens are no longer profitable and the 65-foot-wide movie house was 
found to be too narrow for multiple screens, among other factors. 
</P>
<P>
The prospective tenant -- the Austin-based Bookstop Inc. -- approached the 
family after a number of other movie chains were dissuaded from operating there 
for similar reasons, Bailey said. Bookstop, which opened a store last February 
in San Diego's Loma Theater, is a division of Barnes &amp; Noble that operates 
under the name Bookstar Inc. in California. 
</P>
<P>
The Studio Theatre opened in the late 1930s in the streamlined Moderne style of 
its time -- but rather plain in design compared with its more elaborate Art 
Deco sisters, according to theater historian Preston Kaufmann of Pasadena, who 
described the movie house as a "pleasant neighborhood theater" if 
architecturally unremarkable. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufmann cited the Highland Theater, the Fairfax Theater and the Pacific 
Hollywood Theater as examples of single-screen movie houses converted to three 
screens since the 1970s. There were about 230 single-screen theaters in the Los 
Angeles area in 1950, according to the Film Daily Yearbook of Motion Pictures. 
Kaufmann estimated that there are fewer than 50 today. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey and Jill Doland, managing director of the Los Angeles Historic Theatre 
Foundation, said the Studio Theatre was the last single-screen theater in the 
Valley. However, Kaufmann, a foundation member, noted that the Fox Theater on 
Van Nuys Boulevard also remains in operation with a single screen. 
</P>
<P>
Studio City neighbors said they are sorry to see the old movie house go, but 
praised the landlords for trying to preserve the building and for shunning the 
retail-office centers that have replaced one traditional shop after another 
along Ventura Boulevard. Representatives for the owner and the bookstore met 
with the Studio City Residents Assn. last month to discuss their plans. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way to turn that theater into a bunch of theaters economically so 
the Rothmans are looking for a viable lease, and I'm really pleased they didn't 
just say, 'We'll tear the whole half-block out and do a retail center or 
something,' " said Polly Ward, the association's president. 
</P>
<P>
Another Ventura Boulevard movie house, the single-screen La Reina Theater in 
Sherman Oaks, was turned into a small mall three years ago. The shopping center 
has been plagued by store vacancies and temporarily lost its occupancy permit 
last spring after the developer repeatedly failed to complete the street 
improvements promised to the city. A temporary occupancy permit has since been 
renewed. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing we hope is that they don't make it like the La Reina, because that 
was just a disaster," said Lenore Leon, a real estate broker who works on the 
same block as the Studio Theatre and has lived in the neighborhood more than 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Ward and others expressed some concern that the site may eventually be 
redeveloped into either a multiplex cinema or shopping center. The Rothmans own 
approximately 3.5 acres of increasingly valuable property, from the theater 
itself west to Vantage Avenue, according to Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
But Bailey said that competition from multi-screen movie theaters in nearby 
Universal City, coupled with the limited parking that would be available under 
the proposed Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan, left the prospect of a large 
redevelopment project unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
He also said that the landlords have no secret agenda. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known the Rothmans for approximately 10 years now and I can tell you 
they've had unbelievable offers on their property from developers and I'm 
absolutely convinced they will never sell those properties," Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm also convinced they won't change the property unless it is falling down. 
They are against mini-malls. They like the look of Studio City. They've had 
tenants ask if they could clear a portion and they won't do it." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Christopher, president and chief executive officer of Bookstop, said 
details remain to be worked out before a lease is signed. He confirmed that his 
company wants to open a discount bookstore in the theater that would include 
120,000 volumes and a newsstand of 3,000 titles.

RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPE SPILLS AT VA MEDICAL CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A radioactive isotope spilled in a research lab at the Veterans Administration 
Medical Center in La Jolla on Friday and was tracked around the hospital by 
workers, contaminating several corridors and elevators, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The radioactive material, which is used in research and cancer therapy, was 
spread in small quantities over several floors after the spill about 3 a.m. 
Friday, but posed no threat to patients or staff members, hospital spokeswoman 
Gayle Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
"After they finished cleaning it up, they ran an analysis of the people 
cleaning up and nothing was found on them," Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the hospital floors had been cleaned and decontaminated. 
</P>
<P>
Gray said a team from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was scheduled to arrive 
late Friday to investigate the spill. 
</P>
<P>
"We've asked them to come just to determine that everything was all right," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The levels of radiation the hospital reported to us should not pose a health 
hazard to any of the people in the hospital, including people who may have 
gotten the material on their clothing or shoes," commission spokesman Reg Cook 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The only people that we're concerned about at the moment are the four people 
who we understand were working at the lab where the spill occurred last night," 
he said. "We don't know what sort of contamination they may have experienced. 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing we'd be worried about is the radiation exposure itself," Cook 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said commission investigators wouldn't know the extent of the contamination 
until they interviewed the workers, who were not identified. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said that, when hospital staff members arrived in the morning, they found 
the lab sealed with tape indicating that the area was contaminated, but the 
hospital radiation safety officer did not learn of the spill until about 8:30 
a.m. He said he didn't know who had sealed the lab or how many people actually 
were in the lab when the spill occurred.

A San Diego bar owner was arrested and her business shut down by undercover 
narcotics agents who made drug buys out of her 16th Street bar, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Narcotics agents from the San Diego Police Department and the state's 
Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control seized 84.75 grams of marijuana and 
$1,614 in cash from the Nayarit Bar at 71 16th St. about 7:30 p.m. Thursday, 
police spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the evening -- before they served their search warrant -- agents had 
made four drug buys in the bar and observed several similar transactions taking 
place, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bar owner Cecelia Suarez, 44, was arrested and held at the Las Colinas Jail in 
Santee on narcotics charges, Robinson said. Agents from the Department of 
Alcoholic Beverage Control closed the bar after Suarez's arrest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A search of Suarez's home in the 100 block of 29th Street uncovered more than 
11 pounds of marijuana, $1,260 in cash and two handguns, Robinson said. Agents 
also arrested Reyna Grageda, 29, at the 29th Street house, and she was held at 
the Las Colinas Jail on narcotics charges, he said.

Downtown condominium developers Ted Odmark and John Thelan and the Centre City 
Development Corp., the agency that oversees downtown redevelopment, on Friday 
were given the Award for Excellence by the Urban Land Institute, the nation's 
leading urban design association. 
</P>
<P>
The prestigious national award, one of only seven announced at an Urban Land 
Institute conference in Chicago, is the first ever presented to a San Diego

sensitivity to the environment, resourceful use of land and finances. 
</P>
<P>
Odmark, Thelan and the agency were recognized for Columbia Place, a 103-unit 
condominium project at Columbia and G streets. The complex developed by the 
Odmark &amp; Thelan company is built around two historic buildings, the Old 
Cracker factory and the Royster building, both of which were renovated. 
</P>
<P>
The Urban Land Institute is based in Washington and has 17,000 members,

Female vice officers posing as prostitutes arrested 30 men who tried to solicit 
their services early Friday morning in the 3300 block of Midway Drive, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The men arrested ranged in age from 16 to 39 and included a loan officer, a 
teacher, nine military personnel and a doughnut store owner, police spokesman 
Bill Robinson said. They were issued citations and released, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The sweep, which began at 8 p.m. Thursday and continued until 2 a.m. Friday, 
was in response to complaints from nearby merchants and residents about the 
increase in prostitution in the area, Robinson said.

<P>
A 159-unit housing development in the Mission Oaks area of Camarillo has 
received unanimous approval from the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
But before Pardee Construction Co. can proceed with plans to build the 
single-family houses on 36 acres in the eastern portion of the city, it must 
take measures to improve the traffic flow along Mission Oaks Boulevard, near 
Alta Colina Road. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Pardee must construct a 30-foot buffer wall between the 
development and the existing homes to the south of the proposed project. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, council members said they are pleased with Pardee's plans. 
</P>
<P>
"We got everything we wanted out of them," said Councilman Michael Morgan. "We 
got our buffer zone . . . and our traffic study." 
</P>
<P>
Although the council voted Wednesday night to approve the project, it could be 
years before construction starts, Morgan said. Pardee must still file for 
building permits, which are limited to 400 units a year under the city's 
growth-control ordinance. TINA DAUNT

TILE SETTER INDICTED ON MURDER CHARGE

<P>
A 27-year-old tile setter has been indicted on murder and robbery charges by 
the Ventura County grand jury in connection with the July 3 slaying of a Port 
Hueneme man. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Eugene Diaz was indicted by the grand jury in the death of Bruce Eugene 
Pope, 62, who was found in his ransacked condominium, beaten and strangled with 
a telephone cord. 
</P>
<P>
A television, videocassette recorder, computer, camera and cash were missing 
from Pope's home. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment charges Diaz with murder and robbery and a special circumstance 
of murder during a robbery, which would allow prosecutors to seek the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Police have said they believe Pope and Diaz met each other by chance and that 
Diaz was invited to Pope's condominium. MACK REED

200 LEADERS GATHER TO DISCUSS DRUG EPIDEMIC; 
</P>
<P>
THOUSAND OAKS: A SPEAKER TELLS LAW OFFICIALS, SOCIAL WORKERS AND OTHERS THAT 
THE PROBLEM CANNOT BE TACKLED WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING HISTORY.

<P>
In the late 1800s, Americans sipped Coca-Cola for a cocaine high, used the drug 
to fight hay fever and considered heroin the most effective cough remedy money 
could buy. By 1915, the President declared drug abuse the most pressing 
domestic problem in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Despite conventional wisdom, today's drug epidemic is not the nation's first, a 
Yale University professor told 200 state and county leaders gathered for a 
daylong conference at California Lutheran University on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
David Musto, author of "The American Disease: Origins of Narcotic Control," 
told law enforcement leaders, social workers and politicians that without 
understanding the country's past, they could not effectively tackle the current 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no sense that we ever went through it, and it went away," Musto said. 
</P>
<P>
Americans were introduced legally to cocaine in 1885 and the problem peaked in 
1910, he said. But by 1930, because of education and the public's negative 
experience with the drug, use declined for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
After Musto's talk and addresses given by a variety of community leaders, about 
50 drug-control activists agreed to meet again on the Thousand Oaks campus in 
January to form a countywide council to better organize the area's prevention 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Council of Alcohol and Drug Issues will be modeled after 
city-based programs in Ventura, Santa Paula and Thousand Oaks, said Stephen 
Kaplan, director of Ventura County Alcohol and Drug Programs. 
</P>
<P>
While specific goals have not been outlined, the council will review the 
county's services to determine which areas have duplicated prevention efforts, 
he said. Committees will be formed in the county's remaining cities and on 
regional levels, and will be instrumental in responding to the state's request 
for a five-year master plan against substance abuse, Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1987 and 1989, 178 people died in accidents linked to substance abuse, 
the county coroner's office reported. And, according to the district attorney's 
office, 70% of violent crimes committed in the county were drug- or 
alcohol-related. 
</P>
<P>
Medical Examiner Warren Lovell said those whose deaths were linked to cocaine 
ranged in age from 16 to 63. 
</P>
<P>
"The dead should teach the living," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Musto stressed that history can also be educational. Racial prejudice fueled 
the public's ambivalence toward drugs in the 1800s and still does today, he 
said. People look for an easy solution to their fear of the drug crisis and use 
racial minorities as scapegoats. "It's a very powerful temptation to connect 
two social fears and make it one," Musto said. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the presidential "war on drugs" sends a dangerous message that a 
solution can be immediate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It implies quick results," he said. "Almost everyone thinks a war is a quick, 
dramatic thing." 
</P>
<P>
Other speakers advocated different solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Cobb, athletic director of the University of Southern California, 
stressed his belief that the deterioration of family values account for today's 
drug problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's me, me, me" Cobb said. "We mortgage our futures to have our 
pleasures right now. Substance abuse is another manifestation of how we've been 
conducting ourselves the past few years."

LOCAL ELECTIONS COUNTY PROPOSITIONS; 
</P>
<P>
VOTE MAY REMOLD SHERIFF'S OFFICE; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: TWO PROPOSITIONS WILL DECIDE WHETHER TO CREATE A CIVILIAN 
REVIEW BOARD AND A CORRECTIONS DEPARTMENT TO RUN THE JAILS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Besides choosing a successor to Sheriff John Duffy, voters also will have two 
other ways in Tuesday's election to influence the way the San Diego County 
Sheriff's Department will operate in the future -- Propositions A and B. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition A is a proposed amendment to the County Charter that would 
establish a civilian review board to oversee the Sheriff's Department and the 
Probation Department, and, in particular, to investigate citizen complaints of 
brutality, false arrest, illegal searches, criminal misconduct, improper 
shootings and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition B, if approved, gives county supervisors the option of creating a 
county Board of Corrections, appointing a corrections director and staffing the 
six county jails with civilian corrections officers rather than sworn deputies. 
</P>
<P>
The review board created under Proposition A is supported by both sheriff's 
candidates, the county Board of Supervisors and the former county Grand Jury 
foreman. Composed of 9 to 15 members, the review board would be nominated by 
the county's chief administrative officer and appointed by supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The review board would have the power, as does the grand jury, to subpoena 
witnesses and compel testimony. The San Diego Police Department has a 
voter-approved civilian board, but without subpoena power. Civil rights groups, 
like the American Civil Liberties Union, say the police review board should be 
strengthened to be more like the proposed county board. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff Duffy opposes the review board, criticizing it as a group of political 
appointees who will be forced to do the board's bidding. Duffy said the Grand 
Jury can do a better job and save the county about $350,000 it will cost to set 
up the new board. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's candidate Jack Drown, an assistant sheriff, initially agreed with 
Duffy about the Grand Jury but supports the review board now that it is on the 
ballot. His opponent, Sheriff's Capt. Jim Roache, supported the review board 
from the start. 
</P>
<P>
Both men helped write the rebuttal to Duffy's argument against Proposition A. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the review board say it would go a long way toward restoring 
public confidence in the Sheriff's Department, which has been hit with several 
high-profile problems this year, including a $1.1-million jury judgment for a 
retired Navy chaplain who said he was beaten by sheriff's deputies, and the 
killing by a deputy of an unarmed man in Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition B, its backers say, would save the county $13 million to $22 
million by staffing the jails with civilians. The Department of Corrections is 
needed, proponents say, to keep inmates from being abused, as many were at the 
El Cajon jail in 1987 and 1988, and to keep the Sheriff's Department from 
overspending its jail budget. 
</P>
<P>
A varied group of law enforcement officials, from the president of the San 
Diego Police Officers Assn. to the executive director of the San Diego Crime 
Commission to the assistant sheriff for jails, opposes the Department of 
Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
So do Drown and Roache, who say a separate department will do nothing to ease 
jail crowding or help gain money for new jail space. 
</P>
<P>
In the argument against Proposition B he co-authored, Duffy said county 
supervisors simply want further control over the Sheriff's Department but are 
not interested in allocating more money for the problems that exist.

<P>
Mideast Crisis 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you generally support President Bush's handling of the Mideast crisis 
precipitated by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait? Briefly 
explain any differences you have with Bush's actions. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: No. I believe in a neutral foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ultimate Goal 
</P>
<P>
Q. Should the ultimate goal of the United States be to force Iraq to withdraw 
from Kuwait? Or should it be to remove Hussein from power or at least greatly 
reduce his military capacity, either through war or negotiations? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: No. Same as above. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weapons Sale 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support the Bush Administration's proposal to sell billions of 
dollars' worth of additional weapons, including F-15 fighters, TOW missiles and 
Apache helicopters, to Saudi Arabia? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: No. The United States should control these weapons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deficit Reduction 
</P>
<P>
Q. President Bush and congressional leaders recently agreed to a compromise 
package of tax increases and spending cuts designed to reduce the federal 
budget deficit by $40 billion this fiscal year and $500 billion over the next 
five years. This deal, if it gains final congressional approval, would increase 
taxes on gasoline, cigarettes and alcohol; raise Medicare premiums; impose a 
new tax on luxury goods, and reduce itemized deductions that can be taken by 
taxpayers with incomes over $100,000. Do you support his plan? If no, why not? 
What specific actions would you support to cut the federal budget deficit? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: No. Spending should be cut, specifically in the area of military and 
economic aid to foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Campaign Spending 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support efforts to restrict campaign spending and reduce the amount 
of contributions that can be made by special-interest groups? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: No. People should be free to spend as much or little as they desire. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Capital Punishment 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support capital punishment? If so, do you think it should be imposed 
on those convicted of importing or selling drugs? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: Yes, I support capital punishment, but not for drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Abortion 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support a woman's unrestricted right to an abortion within the first 
three months of pregnancy? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Abortion Funding 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support federal funding of abortions for women who cannot afford 
them? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: No. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unpaid Leave 
</P>
<P>
Q. President Bush in July vetoed legislation that would have required 
businesses employing at least 50 people to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid 
leave per year for childbirth, adoption or serious illness to employees or 
immediate family members. Do you favor this or similar legislation? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: No. Private employers have a right to make their own decisions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oil Exploration 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think the present Mideast crisis justifies opening up additional 
parts of the California coastline to oil exploration? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: No. Private property rights justify oil exploration in California, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assault Rifle Ban 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you favor extending President Bush's ban on the import of semiautomatic 
assault rifles to the domestic production of such weapons? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: No. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arts Support 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think the federal government should continue to support the arts 
through the NEA? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: No. Let the "arts" sink or swim on their own. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anti-Crime Legislation 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support anti-crime legislation passed by the Senate in July that 
would re-establish the federal death penalty, limit Death Row inmates' appeals 
and relax the exclusionary rule that prohibits the use of illegally seized 
evidence in criminal trials? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: No. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Immigration Reform 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you support immigration reform that would increase the number of visas 
allowed for family members of those who are already in the United States, as 
well as for skilled workers? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reducing Drug Use 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you believe our present strategy of criminal prosecution, interdiction of 
supplies, and imprisonment of users and dealers is significantly reducing the 
level of drug use in the United States? If no, what should be done? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson: No. Decriminalize drugs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

THE ARROGANCE OF POWER; 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO SHERIFF DIVERTS $300,000 TO SECRET BANK ACCOUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each time San Diego County Sheriff John Duffy thumbs his nose anew at standards 
of ethical conduct, we come away worried about what the man is going to do 
next. 
</P>
<P>
This is an elected official whose past includes illegally using deputies to 
distribute post cards opposing former Chief Justice Rose Bird; who lost a civil 
suit (and was ordered to pay damages) for maliciously firing a deputy from a 
teaching job; who accepted campaign contributions from members of his 
department in violation of policy -- then changed the policy to allow his 
protege to do the same -- and who did not report income from private consulting 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
But Duffy may have surpassed his own benchmark for arrogance with the 
revelation this week that he diverted more than $300,000 seized in drug raids 
to a secret bank account -- and used more than $70,000 in other seized drug 
money to pay a private attorney in a civil suit filed by a deputy. This despite 
a specific prohibition from county supervisors that Duffy spend no more of the 
seized money. 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller concluded Friday that there is no reason to 
investigate. But we believe that the latest Duffy affair should be reviewed by 
the state attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
Miller should stay out of the matter. His office received a share of the seized 
drug funds from Duffy, and on Friday Miller endorsed Duffy protege Jack Drown 
in Tuesday's election to succeed the retiring sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
Federal guidelines governing expenditure of the funds are vague; they mandate 
only that the money be used for "law enforcement" purposes. Orange County 
supervisors and Sheriff Brad Gates have wrangled over Gates' expenditures of 
forfeited drug money. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike grant money, the expenditure of forfeited drug assets is not monitored 
by the federal government. It remains an open question who is ultimately 
responsible for decisions about the money. 
</P>
<P>
As for the swaggering Sheriff Duffy, he will leave in January after 20 years in 
office, tarnished by the bizarre behavior of his last years there. What remains 
to be seen is whether the latest episode harms Drown at the polls Tuesday.

FIRES FORCE 125 TO EVACUATE HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two fires that broke out Friday within two blocks of each other in San Ysidro, 
both producing heavy smoke, forced the evacuation of about 125 people from a 
nearby mobile home park, San Diego fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported from the fires, along Calle Primera in San Ysidro, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear late Friday whether the 125 people, who were forced to leave the 
Rancho del Rio park, would be allowed to return home for the night. Red Cross 
officials said they were prepared to offer overnight shelter. 
</P>
<P>
The first fire began about 12:30 p.m. behind La Bodega Wholesale Market in the 
300 block of Calle Primera, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze was originally reported as a grass fire. Firefighters discovered 18 
55-gallon drums burning in a storm drain, officials said. Hazardous-materials 
specialists could not determine what was in the drums, which sent up clouds of 
black smoke, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
It also was not immediately known where the drums came from, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
As fire crews put out the first fire about 6:30 p.m., after it had burned about 
6 acres, the second one broke out in the 200 block of Calle Primera, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Crews discovered when they sprayed another storm drain with water that an 
unknown chemical was burning, because the water produced popping sounds and 
smoke, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The trailer park was evacuated shortly afterward, officials said. Authorities 
reported late Friday that the second fire was still burning, but they expected 
to have it put out by today.

2 SCHOOLS DISCIPLINE PLAYERS AFTER BRAWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY and KIM KOWSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jennifer Aranda had just finished cheering the Hawthorne High School sophomore 
football team to a 25-0 victory over Inglewood High last Thursday when she 
found herself in the middle of a stampede of warring players. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'Oh my God, what's going on?' " she said. "I saw people pushing 
people, name calling and then people started fighting. Then I saw someone had a 
bat and a metal object. . . . It got worse and worse." 
</P>
<P>
Before the melee was over, the 15-year-old cheerleading captain had been struck 
in the back of the head by someone in a green Inglewood jersey. Her ears were 
ringing and her face felt numb. 
</P>
<P>
"Football players are supposed to be rough and tough but for them to beat up on 
girls is kind of wimpy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
School officials said the fight involved dozens of students and that there were 
a number of injuries but none that required hospital attention. 
</P>
<P>
Both schools disciplined their own teams after the incident -- with Inglewood 
High recommending the dismissal of its assistant coach and Hawthorne High 
suspending five players for one game -- but each school also blamed the other's 
team for instigating the brawl. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of it is our fault, but not everything," said Inglewood nose tackle 
Charlovahn Bell, 14. "It's kind of both our faults." 
</P>
<P>
Both sides agree that tensions were high throughout the game. Afterward, the 
Hawthorne players went to the south side of the field instead of lining up for 
the traditional end-of-the-game handshake. Some of the players yelled to the 
Inglewood team, "We're No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
No one disputes that Inglewood players then ran the length of the field, toward 
the Hawthorne players. Skirmishes broke out. Helmets were thrown. Soon players, 
coaches and some fans were exchanging blows, and a few of them were wielding 
baseball bats or knives. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood blames the outbreak of fighting on Hawthorne's refusal to shake 
hands, coupled with cheap hits and racial slurs from the Hawthorne players 
during the game. Team members said most of Inglewood's players joined the 
fighting only after Taofi Togia, a Hawthorne assistant coach, struck an 
Inglewood player. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne players said they avoided shaking hands because their coach had 
predicted violence might erupt after the game. They also accused the Inglewood 
players of cheap shots during the game and said any slurs they hurled were 
fueled by similar comments from Inglewood players. Togia said he struck an 
Inglewood student only after the student struck him. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood High student Mark Chisolm, 17, filed an assault complaint against 
Togia with the Inglewood Police Department, and Togia filed a similar complaint 
against two unspecified people from Inglewood. A police spokesman said the 
complaints are being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
"When they came after us we just froze," Togia said. "We didn't know what to 
do. . . I was trying to help (a player) when a guy with a bat came and grazed 
me. . . . Then a guy in street clothes hit me in the shoulder with a fist. I 
ended up hitting the guy (that was) with him. He went down and then the guy who 
hit me in the shoulder pulled a knife. . . . That's when I grabbed my player's 
helmet and used it to defend myself." 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne team members also accused Inglewood's assistant football coach Edwin 
Demby of fueling the fight by cursing throughout the game and encouraging his 
team to join the melee. 
</P>
<P>
Enrique Hernandez, 16, said he was walking toward the south end of the field 
when he heard the Inglewood coach say, "Let's go get 'em." Demby denies making 
such a remark. 
</P>
<P>
Demby, a part-time coach who is not on Inglewood High's teaching staff, said he 
gave no orders to his players to fight and was in the middle of the melee 
trying to break it up. He said he even helped three Hawthorne coaches get on 
the bus when someone threatened them with a knife. A Hawthorne coach confirmed 
that Demby helped him and two others to get on the bus.

KINGS ARE DEFENSIVE AFTER LOSS; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: ROBINSON WARY THAT TEAM IS BECOMING LAX AFTER CAPITALS WIN, 4-3. 
</P>

<P>
Larry Robinson may speak softly. But that has never stopped him from delivering 
the hard truth. 
</P>
<P>
And the truth, as Robinson sees it, is that the Kings are sliding back into the 
bad habits and dark days from whence they came. 
</P>
<P>
It's not only that they lost to the Washington Capitals Friday night, 4-3, 
before a sellout crowd of 18,130 at the Capital Centre. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is it merely that this was the first time this season the Kings have lost 
back-to-back games. 
</P>
<P>
No, Robinson, an NHL defenseman for 19 years, knows poor defense when he sees 
it, and he thinks he has seen it over the last two games. After giving up 33 
goals in their first 12 games, the Kings have surrendered 13 in the last two, 
raising fears the team has already slipped after vowing to reform and put 
defense ahead of offense. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you want to win hockey games?" Robinson said. "Or do you want to put on a 
show? 
</P>
<P>
"We are giving up scoring opportunities, and, the sooner we get that through 
our thick heads, the better off we're going to be. We've got to get our act 
together. This was a big game to lose. We shouldn't have lost. There was no 
reason for it. We are playing gambling hockey, and that doesn't pay off." 
</P>
<P>
In falling to 9-4-1, the Kings remained one point behind the Smythe 
Division-leading Calgary Flames. 
</P>
<P>
But some of the factors that had propelled the Kings to their best start in a 
decade were missing Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The power-play unit was a perfect example. The Kings had scored at least one 
power-play goal in 11 of their first 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, they did not have a goal in their four power-play opportunities, 
extending their scoreless streak in that department to 12. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all their problems, the Kings were tied heading into the final period 
Friday night in a game they never led. 
</P>
<P>
The Capitals had scored twice in the opening period, Kevin Hatcher getting his 
fourth goal and John Druce his seventh. 
</P>
<P>
But Tony Granato countered with his eighth goal and Dave Taylor tied the score 
with his third goal 11:37 into the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Washington went ahead again on Nick Kypreos' third goal, but Wayne Gretzky got 
the equalizer, putting in a 20-foot shot from the slot over the stick of goalie 
Mike Liut at 16:16 for his team-leading 10th goal. 
</P>
<P>
In extending his point-scoring streak to 12 games, Gretzky moved past Calgary's 
Al MacInnis into the league's scoring lead with 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
But the goal that mattered most this night was scored by Washington left wing 
Michal Pivonka. He took a 35-foot shot from the slot that slipped past goalie 
Kelly Hrudey's pads at 3:34 of the final period. 
</P>
<P>
It was Pivonka's fourth goal, and it was, as it turned out, adios for the 
Kings. 
</P>
<P>
"You are going to let goals like that in during a season," Hrudey said. "You 
just wish it was not 3-3 in the third period when it happened. It was one of 
those nights where playing goalie was not fun. 
</P>
<P>
"You have just got to pick your head up and go on." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings had only one shot on goal in the last seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
With 46 seconds to play, King Coach Tom Webster pulled Hrudey, but, even with 
the extra skater, the team failed to add to their shot total of 23. 
</P>
<P>
The Capitals didn't get a shot on goal over those last seven minutes, but, by 
then, they were more concerned with protecting their own net. 
</P>
<P>
"They were sending one guy in," Granato said, "and stacking four at the blue 
line. It's pretty tough to penetrate." 
</P>
<P>
It was a big victory for the Capitals. Despite an injury list that includes 
Dino Ciccarelli, Peter Zezel, Alan May, Neil Sheehy and goalie Don Beaupre, the 
team moved above .500 for the first time this season at 8-7. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings are 2-3 on this trip, with the finale Sunday in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still confident we've got a real good squad," Granato said, "and a team 
that has the talent to be in first place. What a good team does is stop these 
slides at one or two games, not let them get to five or six. Now we'll see 
whether or not we are a good team." 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
A dinner, honoring former King Marcel Dionne, on the floor of the Forum 
Wednesday night will be open to the public. Tickets may be purchased through 
the Kings. Dionne's jersey will be retired in a ceremony Thursday, preceding 
the game against the Detroit Red Wings. . . . Washington forward Dino 
Ciccarelli, out since Oct. 20 with a broken thumb, skated for the first time 
Thursday. It was merely to keep in shape, however. He is not expected back in 
the lineup until the middle of next month.

The New York Islanders blew an early two-goal lead before ending the New York 
Rangers' record 8-0 home ice start with a 3-2 victory Friday night on 
defenseman Joe Reekie's first goal of the season at 5:40 of the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Reekie's screen shot from the right point went between the pads of goalie John 
Vanbiesbrouck, who had won his last six starts. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Healy, the Islanders' goalie, stopped 29 shots, including Mike Gartner's 
breakaway with 25 seconds to play. The Rangers outshot the Islanders, 15-5, in 
the third period. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers (11-4-0) were 11-1 in their last 12 games and lead the league with 
22 points. The Islanders improved to 4-9-0.

CAL STATE FULLERTON PLAYS AT SAN JOSE STATE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The longest losing streak in Cal State Fullerton football history is expected 
to continue tonight at 6 when the Titans play at San Jose State in a Big West 
Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, which has lost eight in a row since a season-opening victory over 
Sonoma State, has won five of the last seven games against the Spartans, 
including a 58-13 victory in 1988 and a 28-14 win last season. 
</P>
<P>
But San Jose State (5-2-1, 4-0 in conference play) is an overwhelming favorite. 
The Spartans are four points away from an undefeated season. They tied 
25th-ranked Louisville, 10-10, lost to seventh-ranked Washington, 20-17, and 
lost to California, 35-34. MIKE DiGIOVANNA

The Phoenix Suns, led by Tom Chambers, started the NBA season half a world away 
from home Friday night with a 119-96 victory over the Utah Jazz in the first 
regular-season NBA game held outside North America. 
</P>
<P>
A sellout crowd of 10,111 at Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium, paying as much as 
$175 a seat, was predominantly young Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
The game was close during the first half before the Suns pulled away with a 
19-2 run late in the third quarter, giving Phoenix an 85-70 lead that was never 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Chambers scored eight of his 38 points during the run. He scored 27 points in 
the second half when the Suns outscored the Jazz, 61-39, after leading only by 
one at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Malone led the Jazz with 33 points, 26 in the first half.

<P>
The Denver Nuggets unveiled their new rapid-fire offense and the result was an 
NBA record for points by two teams in a regulation game Friday night at Denver, 
although the Golden State Warriors won, 162-158, behind Tim Hardaway's 32 
points and 18 assists. 
</P>
<P>
The 320 points broke the mark of 318 set when Denver beat San Antonio, 163-155, 
on Jan. 11, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The game marked the debut of Denver Coach Paul Westhead, who guided Loyola 
Marymount to several collegiate scoring records. He gave a clear indication of 
what style of play he would use as the Nuggets' exhibitions averaged more than 
300 points. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando Woolridge, obtained from the Lakers during the off-season, had 37 
points and Walter Davis 33 for the Nuggets. Golden State's Chris Mullin led all 
scorers with 38 points and Mitch Richmond added 29. 
</P>
<P>
With Golden State leading, 87-83, the teams' total of 170 points also was an 
NBA record for points in a first half. The previous mark was 166 by Syracuse 
and San Francisco on March 10, 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 115, Milwaukee 104 -- The Pistons began their bid for a third 
consecutive championship with a victory at Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Dumars scored 19 points and Bill Laimbeer and James Edwards each had 18 for 
Detroit, hoping to become the first team since 1966 to win three consecutive 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
Baskets by Edwards and Dennis Rodman gave the Pistons a 92-77 lead early in the 
fourth quarter and the Bucks never got closer than eight the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 125, Cleveland 101 -- The Celtics, with a new fast-break offense and new 
head coach Chris Ford, easily defeated the Cavaliers at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
With Boston leading, 105-92, with 6:11 left, Brian Shaw made two free throws to 
start a 16-1 Celtic run. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Lewis led the Celtics with 32 points. Robert Parish added 23 points and 
Larry Bird had 18 points and 15 assists. The Cavaliers were led by Mark Price's 
19 points. 
</P>
<P>
The game featured the return of Shaw and Danny Ferry, teammates last year with 
Il Messaggero of Rome. Shaw scored 13 points and Cleveland's Ferry had five. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 98, Dallas 85 -- Tyrone Corbin, Randy Breuer and Pooh Richardson 
ignited a 31-12 run over the final 9:34 to help the Timberwolves open their new 
arena with a victory. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas, a favorite to win the NBA's Midwest Division, missed six consecutive 
shots as the Timberwolves broke a 77-77 tie with a 10-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
New York 134, Charlotte 130 -- Maurice Cheeks made a key steal and made four 
free throws in the final seconds as the Knicks won in overtime at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks scored six consecutive points, capped by Mark Jackson's two free 
throws with 49 seconds left for a 130-129 lead. Cheeks then stole the ball from 
Dell Curry and made two free throws to put them ahead, 132-129, with 39 seconds 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 124, Chicago 116 -- Charles Barkley scored 37 points and Johnny 
Dawkins added 25 to offset Michael Jordan's 34 points at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan scored 28 points in the second half. The 76ers' Rick Mahorn scored 13 of 
his 19 points in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 115, Orlando 111 -- The Hawks trailed, 111-109, with 1:26 to play, but 
Dominique Wilkins made two free throws and Rumeal Robinson, Kevin Willis and 
Duane Ferrell each made one for Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Miami 119, Washington 95 -- Willie Burton, a 6-foot-8 forward from Minnesota, 
scored 25 points for the Heat in his NBA debut at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 100, New Jersey 81 -- Rik Smits scored 24 points and LaSalle Thompson 
had 20 rebounds as the Pacers, taking control in the third quarter, won at 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 90, Houston 89 -- Clyde Drexler scored 17 of his 29 points during a 
third-quarter rally as the defending Western Conference champion Trail Blazers 
struggled at Portland. 
</P>
<P>
Houston's Akeem Olajuwon, who finished with 21 points, scored the final six 
points of the game. Teammate David Wood missed a 20-footer as the game ended.

Cornerback Darryl Henley, who will be activated off injured reserve today, 
could be stepping back into the Rams' secondary in the nick of time. 
</P>
<P>
Pro Bowl cornerback Jerry Gray has been nursing a sore knee this week, and 
Coach John Robinson was evasive Friday about whether Gray will play Sunday 
against the Houston Oilers at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just kind of waiting as long as we can," Robinson said of Gray's 
situation. "Jerry will be OK, I think. It's just we've got quite a few ifs 
there, and we're going to try to play a lot of people. Is that vague enough?" 
</P>
<P>
Gray, who is not listed on the Rams' injury report, missed the first three 
games of the season after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his left knee, and 
lately has been complaining of soreness in the knee. He had it re-examined this 
week, but no further serious damage was found. 
</P>
<P>
If Gray is sidelined, Robinson said Mickey Sutton probably will play in his 
place, though Henley, who was projected to be a starter before his hip-muscle 
tear in the exhibition season, is also a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Marcus Dupree, eligible to come off of injured reserve, will not 
be activated for Sunday's game, Robinson said. TIM KAWAKAMI

I lost $50 on Friday when Wingless Flyer had his wings clipped in the second 
race. I could blame my two-day slump on a lack of competition, but that would 
be mean so I won't mention SURELOCK's race to bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
So, today, I'm betting $50 to win and place on Shinko's Lass in the fifth and a 
$25 show parlay from Chelsea's Pick in the second to Meadow's Interco in the 
third to Summer Sale in the fourth to Shinko's Lass in the fifth to 
Thisonesforyoumike in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
Janice Goldinger's Fri. bankroll: $2,070 
</P>
<P>
Friday's Loss: $50 
</P>
<P>
Current Bankroll: $2,020 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SURELOCK's bet for today is a $6 early triple, I Can Do That-Valiant Pete-Linda 
Card. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SURELOCK's Fri. bankroll: $21 
</P>
<P>
Friday's Loss: $9 
</P>
<P>
Current Bankroll: $12 
</P>
<P>
Note: Janice Goldinger, a horse owner, does not bet on races her horses run in. 
SURELOCK does not own horses. 
</P>
<P>
Both players started with a $2,000 bankroll.

ROSS GETS HIS MARK; RBV WINS

<P>
The full moon was shining bright, like a big spotlight, on the Vista High 
School football field. 
</P>
<P>
And Markeith Ross, the Laurence Olivier of running backs, was Friday night's 
star on the 100-yard stage. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, a Rancho Buena Vista senior, became San Diego County's most prolific 
rusher in a 38-24 homecoming victory over Fallbrook in front of 3,500. He 
gained 159 yards on 18 carries, giving him 4,496 for his career, surpassing the 
record 4,486 yards held by former RBV back O.J. Hall (1987-89). 
</P>
<P>
Since opening in 1987, RBV has been a virtual running back factory. Scott 
Garcia (1987-88) is fifth in career rushing with 3,466 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Ross figured he would get the record sooner or later. And it wouldn't matter to 
him at all if the record didn't come at all. "(The Stadium) is my goal," Ross 
said of advancing to the championship game at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
"The rushing records can all pass, I just want to go to The Stadium." 
</P>
<P>
This is not Ross' first county record. He already holds the career mark for 
most points scored with 416. 
</P>
<P>
He also set a single-game touchdown and scoring record when he rushed for seven 
in a game against Poway earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
He finished the night with three touchdowns for RBV, on runs of four, two and 
five yards. He has 23 this season, 22 rushing. 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, RBV (7-2, 6-0) clinched the Palomar League title. Fallbrook 
(4-4-1, 1-4-1) was hoping for an upset to try to ensure an at-large berth for 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
They were unwilling to let Ross' record come easily. Although Ross gained 64 
yards on his first carry, the defense keyed on him the rest of the night, 
opening the door for backfield mates Tyrone Cormier, Edric Hall and Derrick 
Breaux. 
</P>
<P>
Fallbrook held a 24-19 lead, in large part due to sophomore quarterback John 
Dutton and the running of Tony Burton.

EDBERG, BECKER APPEAR HEADED FOR PARIS SHOWDOWN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It appears that Stefan Edberg and Boris Becker are headed for a showdown in the 
final of the Paris indoor tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Both won their quarterfinal matches Friday. Top-seeded Edberg beat Jakob 
Hlasek, 6-3, 6-2, and No. 2 Becker beat Michael Stich, 6-1, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
In the semifinals, Becker will play Jonas Svensson, who beat sixth-seeded 
Emilio Sanchez, 7-5, 6-4. Sergi Bruguera of Spain beat qualifier Guillaume 
Raoux of France, 4-6, 6-1, 6-3, in another quarterfinal and will play Edberg. 
</P>
<P>
Becker beat Edberg in the Paris final last year, but Becker has beaten Edberg 
in straight sets at Sydney, Australia and at Stockholm, Sweden, in the past 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg broke Hlasek's serve in the first game of Friday's match and broke again 
in the first and third games of the second set with big service returns. 
</P>
<P>
In the last game, Hlasek fell behind 0-40 and saved two match points before 
Edberg hit a service return past Hlasek to close it out. 
</P>
<P>
Becker needed only 67 minutes for his 13th consecutive victory at the Paris 
indoor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my best match of the tournament," Becker said. "It usually gets tougher 
in the quarterfinals, but for me it's getting easier." 
</P>
<P>
Said Stich, ranked 67th: "Today I lost to a player two times better than me. I 
didn't have any chances to win a set or the match." 
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded Zina Garrison, troubled by Marianne Werdel's power game in the 
opening set, converted her opponent's mistakes into a 6-7 (3-7), 6-1, 6-2 
quarterfinal victory in a $350,000 tournament at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Unseeded Meredith McGrath beat Rosalyn Fairbank-Nideffer, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Accusing the United States of putting television before tennis, Australia has 
demanded that the timetable for the Davis Cup final at St. Petersburg, Fla., be 
rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. organizers want singles matches to run from 5 p.m. until midnight on 
the first day Nov. 30, with play resuming in the doubles at 12:30 p.m. the next 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Australia wants the international management committee of the 
International Tennis Federation to change the timetable. In a statement, Tennis 
Australia said that after having a shower and massage, speaking to the press, 
and having a meal, a player would have only "five hours effective rest" before 
getting up to start practice. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has said its singles players will not play in the doubles, 
but Australian captain Neale Fraser has not yet announced his lineup. 
</P>
<P>
The Davis Cup committee refused to intervene last month, but Tennis Australia 
insists that the rules do not give the host country the right to dictate 
scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
The event will be televised by ESPN.

WARM OCEAN BRINGS VIVID CHANGE TO MARINE SYSTEM; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: FISHERMEN AND SURFERS BASK IN THE FRIENDLY WATERS, WHILE 
SCIENTISTS STUDY THE PHENOMENON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A marine biologist diving near Santa Catalina Island was startled to find an 
unfamiliar off-white-colored starfish usually indigenous to the tropical waters 
of South America. 
</P>
<P>
Near Point Loma in San Diego, the waters are providing a unique harvest of such 
exotic species as yellowfin tuna and dorado, prompting commercial fisherman 
Lance Withee to say he has "never seen the ocean like this before." 
</P>
<P>
And for surfers at Newport Beach, swimming trunks often replace the full-body 
wet suit, normally de rigueur as Southern California moves into the winter. 
</P>
<P>
Warmer-than-average ocean temperatures off Southern California -- as much as 10 
degrees above normal on a given day -- are intriguing scientists, fascinating 
fishermen and delighting surfers from Santa Barbara to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla say monthly 
average temperatures since June have topped normal temperatures by as much as 
five degrees. The highest readings occurred in July. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really excited about it," said Orange Coast College marine biologist 
Dennis Kelly, who has heard reports of unusual sea turtles and other warm-water 
creatures as close as four miles to Newport Pier. "It opens up a lot of doors 
for us for research." 
</P>
<P>
No one is quite sure why the tropical-like waters have pushed ocean 
temperatures up. And scientists are less willing to predict what the trend 
could mean for the future. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big ocean out there," said biological oceanographer John McGowan, a 
member of the Scripps Climate Research Division. "There is so much going on 
that we just can't see." 
</P>
<P>
Some specialists suggest a shift in wind patterns may be the cause. Others 
point to a change in an ocean current. Still others are concerned that the warm 
water may be a harbinger of El Nino, a Pacific Ocean weather pattern that 
causes severe drought in some areas of the Pacific Rim and devastating storms 
in others. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California has experienced a slackening of strong westerly winds, 
which normally blow across the ocean and churn the deeper, colder water. The 
resulting "upwelling" cools the shallower warm water. 
</P>
<P>
Without the wind, the upper layer of ocean water becomes tepid -- an 
explanation offered by Newport Beach Marine Safety officer Gordon C. Reed. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had little wind to speak of this year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But others suggest that the warming is the result of an errant current that is 
also dragging to the Southern California coastline an array of exotic marine 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Marine biologist Jeff Landsman, with the Cabrillo Marine Museum in San Pedro, 
said that he and other researchers have noted unusual ocean life that seems to 
be associated with the warm water. Thousands of South American Humboldt squid 
were beached near San Onofre in the summer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another striking example was the discovery of the starfish, a Tamaria obstipa, 
off Catalina by Landsman's colleague, Lloyd Ellis. The creature is native to 
coastal waters off Peru. 
</P>
<P>
Finds like that have prompted Landsman and other scientists to conclude that 
the warmer-than-normal water might be the result of an off-season flow of the 
Davidson Countercurrent, which pushes water northward from Baja California in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
"There's too much out there to believe that it's just the lack of winds," 
Landsman said. "I don't believe that it's upwelling that is causing this." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason, the tropical-like waters have been a boon to such 
beachgoers as 19-year-old Jason Smith, an avid Newport Beach surfer. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent day his wet suit lay unused nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't even need the suit," said his 18-year-old friend, Rip Arenz. "Yeah, 
the water is really warm. I don't know why." 
</P>
<P>
And sportfishermen are enjoying the bounty. Withee, who owns and operates the 
Vagabond, an 80-foot sportfishing boat out of Point Loma, said he has caught 
tropical fish without having to travel hundreds of miles south. 
</P>
<P>
"It's never before been like this," Withee said. "We've had a long bite of 
exotic species out there." 
</P>
<P>
Withee and other fishermen say that dorado are normally caught during a 
two-week period in August. But since May, they have been bringing on board 
hundreds of the iridescent, blue-and-green fish each day. Fishermen also report 
higher than normal concentrations of yellowtail tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Zeke Grader, executive director for the Sausalito-based Pacific Coast 
Federation of Fishermen's Associations, said the catches are helping the 
$1.5-billion commercial fishing industry as well as sports fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
But Grader said that if the unseasonably warm temperatures continue, important 
colder-water fish may be driven away. For example, experts say a small squid 
that spawns off Santa Catalina Island in the winter would be threatened by the 
warmer water. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to say whether we are looking at something unusual," Grader said, 
"but we're watching very carefully the water conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Grader said that the last time warm water hurt the fishing industry was in 
1982-83, when a strong El Nino -- the worst such weather system in the century 
-- devastated the salmon harvest. 
</P>
<P>
Scripps researchers said that fears of an impending El Nino are ill-placed. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Graham, part of a team studying the phenomenon, said the earliest an El 
Nino could form would be next year. 
</P>
<P>
Scripps' McGowan also said the warm waters do not appear to be a sign that an 
El Nino is beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Absent are other signs of the phenomenon -- called the El Nino-Southern 
Oscillation, or ENSO -- which are found in the equatorial and eastern Pacific 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
For an El Nino to take place, Graham said, barometric pressure in the area of 
Darwin, Australia, must rise and pressure over Tahiti must fall. Neither 
condition has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, El Nino is associated with increased rainfall in the central 
equatorial Pacific, elevated sea surface temperatures from South America to the 
international date line and weaker easterly winds along the Equator, Graham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have all the (other) danger signals yet," McGowan said. "They are 
just not all in place."

PROP. 136 FEAR IGNITES FLURRY OF TAX ACTIVITY; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCES: LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SCRAMBLE TO PASS NEW LEVIES IN CASE 'POISON PILL' 
CHOKES OFF REVENUE SOURCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Like shoppers rushing to a going-out-of-business sale, local officials in 
several Southland communities are scrambling to levy new taxes in anticipation 
that a proposed constitutional amendment will pass in Tuesday's election and 
wipe out their power to raise revenues without first getting voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
Lynwood acted so quickly last week to adopt an emergency 10% utility tax that 
officials there said they did not have time to figure out the cost to the 
average consumer. 
</P>
<P>
Downey adopted a 3% utility tax at a special council meeting Tuesday and the 
San Diego County Board of Supervisors last week voted to enact a first-ever 
license tax for businesses in unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
Other communities, including San Fernando, Compton and West Hollywood, have 
scheduled meetings for Monday to vote on tax levies before the controversial 
initiative, Proposition 136, takes the matter out of their hands. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the rush is that Proposition 136 will take effect at midnight 
Tuesday if it is approved by voters. 
</P>
<P>
The measure is the brainchild of those allied with the Jarvis-Gann anti-tax 
crusaders. It would prohibit a city or county from enacting a new 
general-purpose tax or increasing an existing one unless a majority of voters 
approved. A new or increased special-purpose tax, such as a levy to pay for 
increased police protection, could not be enacted unless two-thirds of the 
voters approved. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, bankrolled largely by the liquor industry, contains some 
exemptions for tax hikes needed in emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
It is known as the "poison pill" initiative because it could also wipe out key 
funding elements of at least three other propositions on Tuesday's ballot. In 
one instance, it would block a new tax on alcohol unless two-thirds of the 
voters approve. 
</P>
<P>
"This is far more reaching than most people realize," said Iola Williams, 
former president of the League of California Cities, which strongly opposes 
136. 
</P>
<P>
Said Compton Councilman Maxcy D. Filer: "Any time you cannot tax or raise 
funds, I don't know how you can run a government, because you're at the mercy 
of someone else." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said that without direct taxing power, city and county governments run 
the risk of becoming even more dependent on the state for financial support. 
</P>
<P>
There appears to be no likelihood of a last-minute tax push by the Los Angeles 
City Council, and the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has already 
signaled its lack of interest. In some other cities, tax increases were 
considered but not enacted. 
</P>
<P>
In San Jose, where Williams is a councilwoman, officials worked for weeks to 
come up with a list of possible new revenues sources. But on Tuesday, they 
abandoned the effort, fearing voter resentment. . 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino Mayor Bob Holcomb has been trying for a month to persuade his 
City Council to raise the utility tax from 8% to 9%. But even with a promise 
not to implement the tax if Proposition 136 fails, Holcomb has been unable to 
get enough votes for it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's doing what logic dictates," the mayor said of the attempted tax 
hike. He said he plans to make one last try at the City Council meeting on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of Proposition 136 are chortling over the beat-the-clock tax measures, 
saying they will boost voter support for the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"It absolutely helps us enormously," said Ray McNally, a Sacramento public 
relations strategist helping to orchestrate the 136 campaign. "These guys slink 
around and underscore the voters' suspicions that they can't trust politicians 
and that's a big selling point on Proposition 136." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opponents of 136 winced at news of the election eve tax push. 
</P>
<P>
"If cities all rush to do this, it makes it bad for us," said Lenny Goldberg, 
director of the "No on 136" campaign. 
</P>
<P>
But for some city officials concerned over shrinking revenue to pay for 
municipal services, the political pitfalls were worth risking. 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood Councilwoman Babette Lang was loudly booed by the audience when 
she left her sickbed this week -- where she is recuperating from a broken hip 
-- to break a monthlong deadlock over a proposed business license tax. She cast 
the third and deciding vote for the tax, which comes back for final approval on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, designed to raise $1 million a year, would impose a $270 annual 
tax on a business with annual sales of $565,000. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something that is really needed and we have to do it now," Lang said. 
"Besides, the tax is minimal. I don't believe it will really hurt the business 
community." 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Mayor James B. Hansen proposed an ordinance empowering the city to 
levy taxes on basic utilities and cable television service. The measure, he 
said, would give the city a quick method of raising revenue "if financial 
disaster hits." . 
</P>
<P>
The City Council will meet Monday to consider the tax. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a good business decision to do it," Hansen said. However, he said 
he would withdraw his support if residents voice overwhelming opposition to the 
proposal. . 
</P>
<P>
In Compton, where more than 100 city employees have been laid off over the past 
two years because of budget problems, the City Council will vote Monday on 
raising its utility tax from 5% to 7%. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody likes to impose fees but we had no choice," said Lynwood City 
Councilman Paul H. Richards, referring to Proposition 136.

Mubarak and in Saudi Arabia with King Fahd, the Saudi monarch, and the exiled 
emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah. 
</P>
<P>
The initial plans for the trip were disclosed by White House Press Secretary 
Marlin Fitzwater while Bush was in the middle of a political tour of the 
Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
The President has said frequently in recent weeks that he wants to spend the 
holiday visiting with some of the more than 210,000 GIs stationed in the region 
if such a tour could be arranged. A visit over Christmas, it was felt, would 
risk offending the Saudis, who have been extremely sensitive over the presence 
of non-Muslim forces in their nation, site of some of the holiest places in the 
Islamic religion. 
</P>
<P>
The trip will put an American President in a zone of potential warfare for the 
first time since Lyndon B. Johnson made a 2 1/2-hour visit to Vietnam on Oct. 
26, 1966, during the height of the U.S. involvement in the war there. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. forces are deployed in the Saudi Arabian desert although Arab forces 
have generally taken up the most forward positions on the Saudi-Kuwaiti border 
where they face Iraqi troops. U.S. troops are also aboard ships in the Persian 
Gulf, the Arabian Sea and in neighboring countries allied with the anti-Iraq 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
The President's specific plans for the troop visit, as well as the sites of his 
meetings with Mubarak, Fahd and the emir, were not disclosed. White House 
officials are about to begin their initial travel survey of the region. 
</P>
<P>
The presidential visit to Saudi Arabia will be the first since Jimmy Carter 
visited Riyadh in January, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time that the White House disclosed the President's Middle East 
travel plans, it made public a presidential proclamation declaring Friday a 
"National Day of Prayer," a generally routine document. In this case, however, 
it dealt specifically with the crisis in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"With these grave concerns before us, we do well to recall as a nation the 
power of faith and the efficacy of prayer," the proclamation said. It asked for 
divine protection of those "working to uphold the universal cause of freedom 
and justice half a world away from home." 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the trip was made at the end of a week in which the 
Administration sent multiple signals about the anticipated course of events in 
the gulf -- holding out renewed hopes for a peaceful resolution of the 
confrontation there, even as the President stepped up his angry pronouncements 
directed at Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Bush continued that approach Friday during his political appearances in the 
Midwest. He said that although the United States is not alone in its deployment 
of troops in Saudi Arabia and the gulf -- the Americans have been joined by 
troops from 25 other nations -- only the United States has the strength and 
commitment to stand up to Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III was scheduled to leave Washington today 
to visit Europe, Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations to assess the status of 
the U.N. Security Council's economic sanctions on Iraq and, sources have said, 
to consider additional steps, including a military offensive. 
</P>
<P>
The Middle East portion of the President's trip is being added at the end of a 
long-planned visit to Europe that has been built around a summit conference in 
Paris, at which a treaty making sharp cuts in conventional, or non-nuclear, 
armaments in Europe will be signed. 
</P>
<P>
Bush will take part in the Paris summit with Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev on Nov. 19 and 20. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the White House announced that Bush will visit Prague on Nov. 17, 
the first anniversary of the revolution that overturned four decades of 
Communist rule in Czechoslovakia. The next day he will confer with Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl of Germany in Kohl's hometown of Ludwigshafen. 
</P>
<P>
The visits will highlight the changes that have taken place in Europe over the 
last year. The trip to Prague will be Bush's first to a former Communist nation 
since those dramatic upheavals, and his visit to Germany will serve to mark the 
unification that occurred there Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
The European trip is the first of several foreign journeys on Bush's agenda in 
the coming months. He is also planning to visit Mexico at the end of November, 
South America during the first week in December, and Moscow early next year for 
the anticipated signing of a treaty cutting in half the U.S. and Soviet 
arsenals of strategic, or long-range, nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
During his public appearances Friday in Rochester and Cincinnati, Bush stepped 
back from one approach he employed at several stops Thursday, when he said 
Hussein was more brutal than Adolf Hitler. He made no mention of the Nazi 
dictator during his speeches Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Alixe Glenn, White House deputy press secretary, said the omission was not 
deliberate and that the reference, which drew criticism from some Jewish 
leaders, may be repeated in future speeches. Abraham Foxman, national director 
of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, said the comment was "an 
unfortunate exaggeration." 
</P>
<P>
Bush otherwise maintained his adamant opposition to the Iraqi occupation of 
Kuwait, insisting on one hand that "no one wants a peaceful solution to this 
situation more than I do," while also declaring that he would hear of no 
compromise -- "none at all" -- when it comes to his demand for a total Iraqi 
withdrawal and restoration of the Kuwaiti government that was overthrown Aug. 
2. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God, the people of the United States understand that it is only the 
United States that has the strength and, I would say, total commitment to stay 
the course and see that this aggression is turned back," Bush said at a 
Republican Party rally in a high school gymnasium in Rochester.

6 POLICEMEN TRIED FOR 'JUST A FRENZY';

<TEXT>
<P>
Leonardo Mercado was sitting on a tattered yellow couch in the front yard of a 
house in an inner-city Miami neighborhood that Friday afternoon when three cars 
roared up and six men jumped out. 
</P>
<P>
The six were policemen, and Mercado, 35, was a small-time drug dealer who the 
police believed might be responsible for a death threat that one of the 
officers had received. The police officers patted down a few people standing 
around the yard, chased others away and then invited Mercado inside the house 
to talk. 
</P>
<P>
No one but the six police officers knows exactly what happened next. But, 
within 10 minutes, Mercado was dead, a victim of what a police spokesman later 
called "just a frenzy." He was beaten with fists, pummeled about the head with 
a flashlight or a nightstick and repeatedly kicked, according to the autopsy 
report. Mercado died of a brain hemorrhage. The date was Dec. 16, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Now, almost two years later, the six Miami policemen are on trial, facing 
federal charges of conspiracy and civil rights violations. If convicted, they 
face life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
To prosecutors, "This is a case about police brutality," as Assistant U.S. 
Atty. Edward Nucci said in his opening statement to the 12-member jury last 
week. The six plainclothes officers not only beat Mercado to death but then 
lied to cover up what had happened and fabricated evidence, the prosecution 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
To defense attorneys, the case epitomizes the harsh reality of the war against 
drugs in which police officers daily risk their lives. Mercado, with a long rap 
sheet and traces of cocaine in his blood, caused whatever frenzy ensued by 
attacking the policemen, the defense argued. 
</P>
<P>
To many in Miami, the trial represents another sad chapter in the tale of a 
city with a disturbing history of police actions resulting in death. Twice in 
recent years, Latino police officers have faced criminal charges after the 
fatal shootings of black men. Both incidents sparked riots. 
</P>
<P>
Most infamous of all is the McDuffie case, named for black insurance man Arthur 
McDuffie, who was beaten to death on the street by white police officers in 
1979. The subsequent acquittal of those officers on manslaughter charges 
touched off a vicious three-day riot in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Although allegations of excessive force by police officers are a central issue, 
this trial lacks the racial and ethnic tensions of previous celebrated cases. 
Mercado was a native of Puerto Rico. Two of the defendants are Latino, three 
are black and the sixth is a non-Latino white. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the case is considered significant for what it discloses about 
police procedures in drug-infested Miami neighborhoods and about life in what 
the prosector called "the underbelly of society" where Mercado lived. 
</P>
<P>
In U.S. District Court, the six burly defendants sit in a row behind their 
lawyers at the defense table. As members of the elite Street Narcotics Unit, 
they drove unmarked cars, carried guns strapped to their ankles and cultivated 
informants among Miami's dope-dealing nether world. They wore jeans and 
sneakers to work. 
</P>
<P>
Here in court, they are dressed in suits and ties, and they stare 
dispassionately at the young prosecution witnesses, teen-agers and school 
dropouts whose lives revolved around playing video games and serving as 
bicycle-riding lookouts for the man they called "Cano." 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Soto, 14 at the time of Mercado's death, was expelled from school as a 
chronic truant and troublemaker. Although he reached the seventh grade, he 
cannot read or write. "Problems come to me," he said in describing his life. 
</P>
<P>
He testified that, when he came home and heard that the police were inside with 
"Cano," a man he considered his stepfather, he climbed in a window to take a 
look. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, he said, officer Andy Watson, known on the street as "Rambo," 
picked him up and threw him back out the window. 
</P>
<P>
"How did you go out?" asked Nucci, the assistant U.S. attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"Like Superman," said Soto. 
</P>
<P>
"Head first, in other words," Nucci said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," Soto replied. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro Soto and his brother Jose, 18, who claims he was punched by the officers, 
have filed a $10-million civil lawsuit against the city. They were 
cross-examined vigorously, and defense lawyer Richard Sharpstein called them 
"Mutant Ninja Turtles," willing to lie both to convict the police officers and 
bolster their chances of financial gain in the civil case. 
</P>
<P>
Well before the trial began, Judge Stanley Marcus ruled as inadmissible 
statements four of the officers gave to other policemen immediately after 
Mercado's death. In those statements, defendants Nathaniel Veal Jr., Ronald 
Sinclair, Charlie Haynes Jr. and Watson said they did not touch Mercado but 
found him, bloodied and nearly unconscious, in the room with Pablo Camacho and 
Thomas Trujillo. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that all six officers hit or kicked Mercado. Nucci said 
experts would testify that patterns from the soles of sneakers worn by Veal and 
Haynes matched bloody marks on Mercado's body. Testimony is expected to 
continue two more weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Miami police officials say they have tightened screening procedures 
designed to detect officers who are prone to violence. In the three years 
before Mercado's death, the six defendants had been involved in 38 "use of 
force" incidents on which they were required to write reports. Each instance 
was ruled justifiable by a supervising police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the six had shown up in an "early warning" system designed to identify 
officers prone to excessive violence.

U.S., SINGAPORE HAGGLE OVER MILITARY ACCORD; 
</P>

WHO GETS LEGAL JURISDICTION OVER AMERICAN PERSONNEL COULD BE A STICKING POINT.

<P>
When a U.S. naval task force led by the carrier Midway steamed into Singapore's 
harbor last month on its way to the Middle East, it was an indication of the 
close military relationship that Washington enjoys with this tiny island 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
But the visit of several thousand U.S. sailors was also a reminder that despite 
more than a year of negotiations, the two countries have been unable to resolve 
their differences over a formal agreement granting the United States increased 
access to military facilities in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
A Western diplomat familiar with the talks said an agreement was "90% 
completed," but the remaining 10% could take several more months of 
negotiations to resolve. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed agreement, the United States would have permanent access to 
naval shipyard facilities in Singapore to service its vessels. It would also 
keep a squadron of F-16s on virtual constant rotation at Paya Lebar airfield, a 
joint military-civilian air base. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement would provide for the stationing of 180 to 200 U.S. military 
personnel permanently in Singapore, although both U.S. and Singapore officials 
have studiously avoided the word bases in referring to the arrangement. The 
U.S. Navy now maintains a staff of just 10 sailors in Singapore to provide 
supplies to visiting ships. 
</P>
<P>
The talks with Singapore come at a time when the Philippine government has made 
clear its determination to take over control of two big U.S. bases -- Clark Air 
Base and Subic Bay Naval Base -- when their leases expire next September. 
</P>
<P>
When Singapore proposed that the United States make greater use of its 
facilities in 1989, it said the main reason was to show Philippine President 
Corazon Aquino that it is willing to share the burden of an American military 
presence in the region. But the proposal immediately caused an outcry in 
neighboring Indonesia and Malaysia that has only recently died down. 
</P>
<P>
Singapore is still a firm proponent of a stable U.S. military presence in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
According to Western diplomats and Singapore officials, the main sticking point 
in the facilities talks is the question of legal jurisdiction over sailors and 
airmen while they are on Singapore territory. The United States wants the 
Singaporeans to hand over lawbreakers to face trial under U.S. military law. 
</P>
<P>
But Singapore has refused to relinquish jurisdiction. Officials said they are 
particularly sensitive about Singapore's drug laws, among the toughest in the 
world, which provide for the death penalty for possession of small amounts of 
heroin and other narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said the possibility of U.S. military personnel being put to death 
for infractions considered relatively minor in the United States could make 
getting the deal through Congress difficult. 
</P>
<P>
A Singapore official said his government will not relinquish its jurisdiction 
but might agree to consult with U.S. authorities before charges are brought 
against any serviceman.

An old territorial dispute over a tiny cluster of uninhabited islands was 
reignited last month, threatening to upset Japan's delicate balance of 
friendship with neighbors Taiwan and China -- and revealing how raw Asian 
sensitivities still are over the legacy of Japanese militarism. 
</P>
<P>
THE ISSUE -- In dispute is a group of five islets and three coral reefs in the 
East China Sea about 130 miles northeast of Taiwan and 100 miles 
north-northwest of Ishigaki Island in Japan's Okinawa prefecture. Lying 220 
miles to the west is the Chinese mainland. 
</P>
<P>
The Senkaku Islands, as they are called in Japanese, had of late attracted 
scant attention until early October. That was when the Maritime Safety Agency, 
Japan's version of the coast guard, disclosed that it was ready to grant 
official status to a private lighthouse erected on one of those forlorn rocks 
by an obscure Japanese right-wing organization. 
</P>
<P>
No further provocation was needed for an opposition politician in Taiwan to 
lead a landing party to the islands, called Diaoyutai in Chinese, with the 
intention of reasserting Taiwanese sovereignty by having athletes from a sports 
festival walk ashore with a torch. A television crew from Taipei recorded the 
scene Oct. 21 from a helicopter as Japanese Maritime Safety Agency ships chased 
away the two Taiwanese fishing boats. 
</P>
<P>
REACTION -- The incident sparked official complaints of "intrusion" from Tokyo 
and accusations of "unfriendly harassment" and "military expansionism" from 
Taipei. Protesters threw rotten eggs and burned a Japanese flag outside Tokyo's 
unofficial representative office in the Taiwanese capital. Similar 
demonstrations occurred in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities in Beijing have been comparatively calm during the whole affair, 
but they reiterated China's territorial claim to the islets. Beijing Radio 
carried a report last weekend saying China proposed jointly developing the 
islands with Japan and Taiwan.Tokyo reacted coolly. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the dispute could not have been worse for Tokyo, which is 
attempting to get legislation through Parliament that would permit personnel of 
the Japanese Self-Defense Forces to join peacekeeping efforts in the Persian 
Gulf. The bill has aroused fears of revanchism among Asian countries that fell 
victim to past Japanese expansionism. 
</P>
<P>
AT STAKE -- At the same time, Japan's borders are not things taken lightly at 
home. A territorial dispute over four small islands off Hokkaido has been the 
major block to friendly relations with Moscow since the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The battle for the Senkakus pivots on national pride, but also at stake are 
rich fishing grounds and potential deep-sea oil deposits. 
</P>
<P>
HISTORY -- Japan first annexed the islands after it acquired Taiwan as a colony 
in 1895 at the end of the Sino-Japanese War. In 1972, when they established 
diplomatic ties, China and Japan disagreed on sovereignty but agreed to shelve 
the problem for "future generations to solve." 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, a right-wing group called the Nihon Seinensha flaunted Japan's claim 
of sovereignty by building a lighthouse on the largest of the islets. After 
repairs were made to the lighthouse in 1988 and 1989, it won recognition as an 
official navigational facility. 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK -- What will happen next on the Senkaku Islands is not clear. A second 
Taiwanese opposition politician has vowed to sail back to the disputed islands 
with a flotilla of 300 fishing boats. 
</P>
<P>
The Taiwanese military has declined to become involved, and Tokyo, too, has 
said it won't use naval forces to patrol the area -- only ships from the 
civilian Maritime Safety Agency.

BRANDT WON'T TRAVEL TO IRAQ ALONE, GERMANY INDICATES

The German government said Friday that it is confident that other European 
personalities will join former Chancellor Willy Brandt on his controversial 
trip to Iraq next week. 
</P>
<P>
"It is highly unlikely that Herr Brandt will travel alone," Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Juergen Chrobog said. 
</P>
<P>
The statement appeared to imply that former Italian Prime Minister Emilio 
Colombo and former Belgian Finance Minister Willy de Clercq might join Brandt 
on the trip to Baghdad, where Brandt is expected to seek release of European 
hostages. 
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had asked the European Community president, 
Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, to suggest to U.N. Secretary General 
Javier Perez de Cuellar that Colombo and De Clercq travel to Iraq as special 
envoys. 
</P>
<P>
Perez de Cuellar, in talks with Brandt on Wednesday, wished the former 
chancellor good luck but declined to name him as a U.N envoy. On Thursday, 
Britain reacted angrily to the planned trip, saying that such visits must be 
discouraged and that London was not consulted. 
</P>
<P>
But German government spokesman Hans Klein said Friday that the trip is in 
agreement with a European Community summit decision made last weekend in Rome 
to discourage isolated visits to Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
"In its activities, the federal government strictly adheres to the Oct. 28 
declaration of the European Council in Rome," Klein said.

DIPLOMACY: SECRETARY GENERAL IS SEEKING A COMPROMISE TO AID THE BESIEGED 
ENVOYS.

U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar met Friday with a high official 
of the International Committee of the Red Cross as part of a quiet U.N. 
diplomatic effort to seek a compromise solution to resupplying the besieged 
U.S. and British embassies in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Red Cross officials said the plight of the remaining handful of diplomats, as 
well as citizens of other countries, still in Kuwait was discussed. A State 
Department official in Washington confirmed that the use of the Red Cross is a 
preferred option for funneling badly needed food and other vital necessities to 
the beleaguered Foreign Service personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Underscoring the seriousness with which the United States views the situation 
at the embassies, U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering and John R. Bolton, 
assistant secretary of state for international organization affairs, met later 
with the secretary general. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Bolton said Perez de Cuellar is very concerned about the 
plight of all foreign citizens in Kuwait and is continuing his efforts to try 
to find a way under U.N. auspices to resupply the embassies. 
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqis persist in stonewalling and in their continued inhumane treatment . 
. . of diplomatic personnel," Bolton said. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department official said Iraq's ambassador in Washington had been 
summoned repeatedly by the Bush Administration to protest the plight of the 
diplomats and private citizens in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"We have seen no progress," Bolton said. He added, "So far, the Iraqis have 
shown no inclination whatsoever to stop their uncivilized treatment of our 
diplomats." 
</P>
<P>
Pickering's and Bolton's meeting with Perez de Cuellar was well publicized and 
came as the Administration considered a number of options for resupplying the 
U.S. Embassy. These include a landing in Kuwait by an unarmed ship carrying 
provisions under the American or U.N. flag; an overland convoy from Baghdad 
under U.N. auspices, or forcible entry by Marines in helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, an official of the International Committee of the Red 
Cross met with State Department personnel in Washington. On Friday, Perez de 
Cuellar also met with Jean de Courten, the International Red Cross' director of

<P>
Whether Iraqi President Saddam Hussein would accept a resupply convoy under Red 
Cross sponsorship is highly uncertain. In the past, he has rejected such 
suggestions in discussions between Red Cross officials and Iraqi authorities. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 20, Iraq ordered all embassies in Kuwait to close by the end of that 
week, and two days later the United States announced it would defy the order. 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks that followed, other Western embassies, facing severe shortages of 
food and other items, were forced to cease operations. Only the British and 
U.S. diplomats remain in their embassies in Kuwait city.

The Honduran government will fire as many as 10,000 of its 60,000 state workers 
as part of a severe economic austerity plan launched in April, officials said 
Friday. The workers will be dismissed in January, 1991, in an attempt to reduce 
the Central American nation's $117-million fiscal deficit, a government 
spokesman said.

BRITAIN: HIS RESIGNATION AS DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER LEAVES THE PARTY'S POSITION 
ON EUROPE IN CONFUSION. CONSERVATIVES BELIEVE THEY MAY SUFFER AT THE POLLS.

<P>
Britain's Conservative Party on Friday sought to put a brave face on the 
resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey Howe, leaving the party's 
position on joining Europe in a state of doubt and confusion. 
</P>
<P>
Many Conservatives believe that Howe's resignation Thursday in protest against 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's renunciation of a common European currency 
will seriously damage them in the next general election. 
</P>
<P>
As the conservative Evening Standard pointed out Friday afternoon: "To lose a 
deputy prime minister over Europe is a catastrophe." The newspaper added: 
"Nothing loses elections faster than a party that is manifestly divided at the 
very top." 
</P>
<P>
The loss of Howe in his other role as leader of the House of Commons was 
stemmed Friday when Thatcher hastily appointed Education Minister John 
MacGregor to the job. She also moved Health Minister Kenneth Clarke to 
education and junior Foreign Minister William Waldegrave to the health post. 
</P>
<P>
The new ministers insisted that the government is not in disarray over the 
European issue. They were joined in that assessment by Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd and Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major, both of whom are 
leading supporters of Britain's closer integration in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
However, critics pointed out that it was the fifth time this year that Thatcher 
has shuffled her Cabinet, calling it a signal of increasing dissatisfaction 
with her authoritarian style of leadership. 
</P>
<P>
The row over Britain's approach to the 12-nation European Community began at 
the group's summit in Rome last weekend when Thatcher, after having seemed more 
conciliatory toward her neighbors at the previous summit, balked. She opposed a 
federal political union in Europe, a central bank and a common currency, but 
was outvoted on these issues 11 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than reassessing the British position, or trying to work out a 
compromise approach for another summit next month, Thatcher and her personal 
aides launched a campaign against other European nations. 
</P>
<P>
They singled out France and Germany for not agreeing on cuts in farm subsidies 
and criticized the Italians for mishandling various ministerial meetings during 
Rome's current presidency of the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher's aides had some pertinent points to make about the lack of specifics 
in the EC proposals and the illogic of setting timetables for political and 
monetary union before it is clear what exactly is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
But they seemed to go out of their way to make biting comments about fellow 
European Community leaders, with a top Thatcher aide calling the proposals 
"ragbag" and the summit itself "an undignified mess." 
</P>
<P>
The aide declared heatedly: "She finds unacceptable the way the EC conducts 
gang negotiating positions."

10TH CHESS GAME, SHORTEST OF MATCH, ENDS IN A DRAW

Defending champion Garry Kasparov and challenger Anatoly Karpov agreed to a 
draw Friday in the 10th game of the world chess championship. 
</P>
<P>
The players agreed to the draw after Kasparov's 18th move. 
</P>
<P>
The game lasted three hours and 12 minutes, the shortest so far in the match. 
</P>
<P>
Each player had 4 1/2 points after they agreed to a draw Wednesday in the ninth 
game. Friday's draw gave them each another half-point, bringing the match score 
to 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
The first player to gain 12 1/2 points wins the championship and $1.7 million 
of a $3-million purse. In the event of a 12-12 tie, Kasparov will retain the 
title. The first 12 games are being played in New York and the rest will be 
played in Lyons, France. 
</P>
<P>
Karpov had the advantage in Wednesday's game but blundered on the 32nd move and 
lost a pawn. A few moves later, he offered a draw and Kasparov immediately 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Grandmaster Maxim Dlugy called the Wednesday mistake "the most horrible blunder 
of this match." It was the third game in a row in which one player or the other 
made a significant mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Following are moves in the 10th game of the chess championship, with Kasparov 
playing white:

BUSH MAKES SHARP TURNS ALONG THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL;

POLITICS: THE PRESIDENT LAUNCHES FIERY ATTACKS ON THE DEMOCRATS, THEN SOFTENS 
HIS TONE. HE INSISTS THAT HE HAS HAD NO 'CHANGE OF HEART.'

<P>
Much as he is sending out dual messages on the Persian Gulf -- determined not 
to yield an inch to Saddam Hussein but expressing the hope that not a shot is 
fired -- President Bush is sending out multiple messages on the domestic 
political front as he winds up yet one more campaign. 
</P>
<P>
At one moment he appears to step back from his angry attacks on Democrats; at 
another he charges into the fray by denouncing their "demagogic . . . 
soaking-the-rich" approach. 
</P>
<P>
At stop after stop as the President made his way along the East Coast on 
Thursday and across the Midwest on Friday in the closing days of the 
congressional and gubernatorial election campaigns, it was much the same: All 
takers, be they Saddam Hussein or Democrats and Republicans, were offered the 
rose or the fist, take your pick. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Bush railed against Democrats who would build campaigns 
around "tax-the-rich, class warfare . . . garbage." 
</P>
<P>
Since he used the line about "garbage" in Oklahoma City on Monday, he has -- 
for the most part -- not been nearly as tough on his party's Democratic 
opponents. A change of heart? 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a change of heart," he said. Rather, "I'd like to finish on a 
positive note in these campaigns." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said Thursday evening, "it's a little early to say that there will 
be no more flamboyant rhetoric about the Democrats, because I'm absolutely 
convinced if we had more Republicans, things would be a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
So the message is mixed. No longer, Bush said at one stop, with dramatic anger 
creeping into his voice, will government programs be funded with red ink. Not 
after the budget compromise that was hammered out in a summer-and autumn-long 
game of chicken between Capitol Hill and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the veto pen, and I will use it over and over and over again," Bush 
declared, his volume rising and his left hand pounding the lectern -- this time 
in Cincinnati -- the first stop on a day that also took him to Rochester, 
Minn., and Sioux City, Iowa. He arrived in Thousand Oaks, Calif., on Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Horton, the furloughed convicted murderer who Bush made a symbol in the 
1988 presidential campaign, may be gone from the speech texts, but there are 
still daily reminders of the threat of street crime that the image of Horton 
had provided, with the President invariably making a link to "liberal 
Democrats" who opposed the anti-crime bill he supported. 
</P>
<P>
"Handcuffs belong not on the cops and the courts; handcuffs belong on the 
criminals," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
The problems that plagued the President's campaign efforts two weeks ago at the 
height of the outcry over the final work on the 1991 budget have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike his tour of New England on Oct. 23, when one candidate for whom Bush was 
campaigning openly voiced his opposition to the President's acceptance of a tax 
increase, and another found it more convenient not to appear on the same 
platform as Bush, the President has found no shortage of candidates willing to 
stand with him in public. Today, he is making his second appearance in a week 
with Sen. Pete Wilson, the GOP's gubernatorial candidate, at a rally at 
California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
In some recent public opinion surveys, those saying they approve of the way 
Bush is doing his job has fallen from an extraordinarily high rating in the 
mid-70% range to slightly below 50%. But Bush, an astute politician known to 
consult closely with his political advisers, professes to be taking the long 
view. 
</P>
<P>
"I told you when things were soaring like eagles: 'Don't believe the polls.' 
And I think now I'm entitled to say: 'Hey, we're going to come on back, don't 
worry about it. They'll be all right,' " he told a news conference on the first 
day of his six-day political journey, which is intended to lend the prestige of 
the presidency to candidates for offices ranging from state auditor to 
governor.

The Museum of Modern Art will receive the multimillion-dollar collection of art 
assembled by William S. Paley, the late founder of CBS Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The gift includes 84 paintings, sculptures, prints and drawings, including 
Pablo Picasso's 1906 masterpiece "Boy Leading a Horse" and other works by 
Picasso, Renoir, Gauguin and Degas. 
</P>
<P>
"At a time when donations of great works of art to museums have been declining 
because of tax changes and soaring values, this magnificent donation of 
masterpieces sets an extraordinary example of generosity and spirit," said 
Richard E. Oldenburg, director of the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Oldenburg called the collection "one of the most significant ever presented to 
this institution." 
</P>
<P>
Paley, who died Oct. 26 at age 89, was appointed a trustee of the museum in 
1937 and served as board president from 1968 to 1972 and chairman from 1972 to 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years he had given the museum many works by Picasso and others. 
</P>
<P>
In his will, Paley left the bulk of his large art collection to the William S. 
Paley Foundation, which he set up in 1936. The museum and the foundation have 
just completed an agreement for the transfer of the collection to the museum.

SPRAY PAINT DECISION COULD SLOW GRAFFITI ARTISTS, FORCE ALTERNATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In a region where violent gangs send death messages to one another on 
cinder-block alley walls and street artists with tag names like "Hex" and 
"Slick" substitute buildings for the conventional canvas, the question on some 
people's lips Friday was this: 
</P>
<P>
Will new anti-smog regulations that restrict the manufacture of spray paint 
eventually put a dent in the graffiti that colors the Los Angeles landscape? 
</P>
<P>
The answer seems to depend on who is doing the talking. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's no aerosol cans, the kids will have to be out there paint-brushing, 
and that takes too long," says Carlos Flores, acting director of Project Heavy, 
a nonprofit graffiti removal service. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sure," countered Los Angeles Police Officer Michael Strawberry, who works 
with the department's anti-gang CRASH unit, "that they will come up with 
something else. There'll be (an) alternative." 
</P>
<P>
The regulations were enacted Friday by the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District as part of an anti-pollution measure. They will require paint 
manufacturers to reduce the amount of smog-forming chemicals in spray paint 
cans so drastically that by 1996, the manufacturers say, virtually 90% of all 
aerosol products will be eliminated from the market. 
</P>
<P>
"Fantastic!" exclaimed Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) on hearing of the AQMD's 
decision. "But not soon enough." 
</P>
<P>
Torres has pressed for legislation to ban the sale of spray paint cans, but the 
bill was defeated in the Assembly in August. The senator wants to put an end to 
gang graffiti and thinks depriving the artists of the major tool of their trade 
is the way to do it.

LIQUOR INDUSTRY LEADS BUSINESS IN CONTRIBUTIONS TO INITIATIVE RACES

Trying to beat back a stiff alcohol tax increase on Tuesday's state ballot, 
alcoholic beverage interests have poured $28 million into initiative campaigns, 
the largest amount by a single industry since the insurance measure wars of the 
last election. 
</P>
<P>
Business and agricultural interests have contributed a total of $57 million in 
the battle over a variety of propositions for increasing their taxes and 
regulating the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The money has flowed from oil and chemical companies trying to defeat 
Proposition 128, the "Big Green" initiative which would limit pesticide use and 
offshore oil drilling. It has come from timber interests fighting Propositions 
130's plan to preserve ancient redwood forests and limit timber-cutting, and 
from the alcohol interests countering Proposition 134, the so-called 
"nickel-a-drink" tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
The total industry spending, compiled from financial reports filed with the 
secretary of state's office, dwarfed the amounts collected by environmental and 
political activists to promote their proposals. With those groups amassing less 
than $12 million, they were outspent nearly 5 to 1 by industry money. 
</P>
<P>
"(Industries) fear (that) what happens in California will spread to other 
states. We do set the trend and that's why alcohol, chemical, oil and timber 
interests see it as World War III whenever we try to have them fairly foot the 
bill for the costs (imposed) by their products," said Steve Hopcraft, a media 
consultant for Californians Against Initiative Fraud, a coalition opposing 
Proposition 136. If successful, that initiative would immunize alcoholic 
beverages and tobacco from future tax increases of more than 1% and cancel the 
nickel-a-drink initiative if it gets less than a two-thirds vote Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the measure have collected $7.8 million, with support from alcohol, 
tobacco and oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
Political consultants for the alcohol industry agree that the rest of the 
country is watching what happens in California. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly there's a concern that (these proposals) would spread, as there is any 
time there's any initiative on the ballot in California," said Rick Manter, 
campaign manager for Taxpayers for Common Sense, a political committee 
organized by the industry to defeat the nickel-a-drink tax. 
</P>
<P>
Tapping foreign-owned companies for nearly 25% of the total, alcoholic beverage 
interests have collected $21.3 million to defeat Proposition 134, another $1.6 
million for efforts to pass a smaller industry-backed increase contained in 
Proposition 126 and $5.2 million to help pass the tax-killing Proposition 136. 
</P>
<P>
To defeat Proposition 128, the so-called "Big Green" initiative, industry 
sources have reported collecting almost $11 million. Many of the same firms, 
including oil companies and agribusiness interests, have provided an additional 
$5.5 million to support a counter-measure of their own, Proposition 135. 
</P>
<P>
Top contributors for the industry effort have been Arco, Chevron and Shell oil 
companies, with combined donations of more than $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Timber interests have contributed close to $10 million to oppose Proposition 
130, the forest-protection initiative placed on the ballot by environmental 
activists, and to promote Proposition 138, the industry-backed alternative on 
the same ballot. 
</P>
<P>
But none of the industry contributions reached the magnitude of insurance 
industry spending two years ago when the industry alone collected about $75 
million for a battle over measures dealing with state regulation of insurance.

SHERMAN-PARRISH RACE GOES FROM POTHOLDERS TO BRICKBATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In recent weeks, little-known State Board of Equalization candidates Brad 
Sherman and Claude Parrish have attempted to lure prospective voters by handing 
out combs and potholders. 
</P>
<P>
But with Election Day looming, the pair have switched to verbal brickbats, 
accusing each other of spreading big-time lies to confuse residents of their 
massive District 2, which stretches from Santa Monica to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Sherman, appearing with Democratic state attorney general candidate 
Arlo Smith at a Los Angeles press conference, took issue with a last-minute 
campaign mailer distributed by Republican Parrish which says Smith has refused 
to endorse Sherman for a post on the state's elected tax appeals board. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the most outrageous hit pieces in contemporary California 
political history," said Sherman, proceeding to put his arm around Smith's 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish, meanwhile, is livid about a Sherman leaflet which claims that 
Parrish's ice cream company was shut down in 1985 for failure to pay state 
income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish says he actually sold the firm, National Ice Cream Products Inc., on 
Jan. 21, 1983. That was 10 days before the company's business license was 
suspended for a month by the state Franchise Tax Board. 
</P>
<P>
Sherman says he relied on public records in making his allegations. Besides, 
Sherman said, the 1983 suspension could only have occurred because of previous 
tax delinquencies. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish, however, says he will sue Sherman for libel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good thing Sherman sold his house (to finance his campaign)," the 
Republican said. "(Otherwise) when I get through with legal action, I'd own 
it."

CHAIN LETTER CAMPAIGN AGAINST ROOS RESURRECTS TIES TO MORIARTY 
</P>

<P>
A wildcat political action group has launched an unorthodox campaign against 
powerful Los Angeles Assemblyman Mike Roos, flooding his district with chain 
letter-style mailings that blast the six-term Democrat for a past brush with 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The group, calling itself Californians Against Corruption, claims to have 
reached nearly all 65,000 voters in the mid-Wilshire district using a network 
of volunteers who each mailed up to 100 packages of literature at their own 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
The group has filed no campaign statements and is not registered with the state 
because it has raised no funds, its organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
The two mailings, the first spread over several weeks and the second reaching 
voters in the week before Tuesday's election, cast Roos as one of the "corrupt 
politicians . . . strangling the effectiveness of government." 
</P>
<P>
Both contain reprints of newspaper articles on Roos' involvement with fireworks 
magnate W. Patrick Moriarty, who was convicted in January, 1986, on corruption 
charges. Although it was disclosed that Roos, who is Assembly Speaker pro tem, 
made a $50,000 profit on a Moriarty condominium project at the same time he was 
pushing a bill helpful to Moriarty's fireworks firm, Roos was not charged with 
a crime. 
</P>
<P>
The letters urge a vote "for anyone but Mike Roos in November!" 
</P>
<P>
Although most members of the group have declined to identify themselves, 
leaders said they come from across the political spectrum and are mainly 
businessmen drawn together by their opposition to restrictions on gun 
ownership. They organized last year in response to the state's assault rifle 
ban authored by Roos, said one of the founders, Manuel Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
The group's first mailing, which started to go out about 10 weeks ago, 
apparently got a boost when a national gun enthusiasts' newsletter published a 
how-to column urging readers to write the Pasadena-based organization for voter 
rolls and basic literature. 
</P>
<P>
After the article appeared, volunteers wrote in from all around the nation 
requesting materials, Fernandez said. Each was instructed to reproduce the 
10-page mailer, mail it in a stamped, hand-addressed envelope and return the 
voter lists with the recipients' names crossed out. 
</P>
<P>
Though Roos is considered by professional politicians to be unbeatable in his 
bid for a seventh term in the 46th District, where Democrats outnumber 
Republicans 2 to 1, Roos was apparently jolted by the letter campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Roos appeared at several community meetings this week and met his Republican 
challenger, Geoffrey Church, in a debate Friday, a gesture that is virtually 
unheard of for an incumbent in such a commanding position. 
</P>
<P>
Church said a Roos staff member told his campaign manager that "the phones were 
ringing off the walls" over the letters. Church said he is not affiliated with 
the group, although he supports its viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Roos camp responded in a letter from the Los Angeles Police 
Protective League, received by voters this week. It characterized the attack on 
Roos as an illegal campaign by the National Rifle Assn. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the NRA said the organization has no connection with 
Californians Against Corruption and said the NRA's attorney has notified the 
Police Protective League that its letter contained "actionable libel." 
</P>
<P>
Neither officials of the Police Protective League nor Roos' office returned 
phone calls from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Californians Against Corruption also denied any connection with the NRA, which 
one of its leaders characterized as "a sporting club" that doesn't care about 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez said the group is no longer motivated only by firearms issues, but is 
taking on corruption throughout government. 
</P>
<P>
"We started looking into Mike Roos because we wanted to recall him," Fernandez 
said. "The more we looked into him, the more garbage we found." 
</P>
<P>
He said the group decided to target Roos in Tuesday's election after conducting 
surveys in the district that showed a high degree of voter apathy and a lack of 
knowledge about Roos' connection to Moriarty. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez said the organization will continue to seek Roos' recall if he wins 
and will target other elected officials it finds lacking in integrity.

DRIVE-BY GUNMAN CONVICTED OF MURDER IN GANG SHOOTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A street-gang gunman in one of the worst drive-by shooting rampages in Los 
Angeles history was convicted Friday of two counts of murder, seven charges of 
premediated attempted murder and one count of robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Faitdon Gipson, 18, was found guilty by a Superior Court jury and faces up to 
61 years in state prison, plus seven life terms. 
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Because Gipson was only 16 at the time of the shootings, he will not face the 
possibility of a death sentence, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. David 
Demerjian. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor charged that Gipson, described as a "hard-core" gang member, was 
the gunman in pay-back shootings near Raymond Avenue and 46th Street on April 
1, 1988. Gang member Stacey Childress, 19, was killed and 10 others, including 
a 5-year-old child, were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The night before, Demerjian said, Gipson shot and killed Loul Alemu, 27, a 
parking lot attendant, while trying to steal the victim's car, which was 
stopped at a red light at 54th Street and Vermont Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Demerjian said Alemu was wearing a red jacket -- a color associated with the 
Bloods street gang -- and Gipson thought he was a rival gang member. 
</P>
<P>
Juvenile Court Judge Donald Pitts decided at a hearing in May, 1988, that 
Gipson could be prosecuted as an adult.

PARENTS' PROTEST GAINS TEACHERS' JOBS -- FOR NOW; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: SCHOOL OFFICIALS HAD OVERESTIMATED THE NUMBER OF INSTRUCTORS NEEDED 
FOR STUDENTS BUSED TO THE VALLEY AND THE WESTSIDE. A LAYOFF DECISION IS DELAYED 
UNTIL MONDAY.

In an unusual move, Los Angeles Unified School District officials removed 100 
teachers from their classrooms Friday and then rescinded the order hours later 
after protests from parents, students and teachers union representatives. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers were told Thursday not to report next week because district 
officials had overestimated the number of students expected to be bused to more 
than 50 schools, mostly in the San Fernando Valley and the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
But a storm of protest from parents and teachers angry over the disruptions 
apparently has stalled the move. Lu Hishmeh, an administrative consultant for 
school operations, said the decision "is being delayed until Monday." 
</P>
<P>
District officials had few explanations for the teacher cutbacks, which 
prompted a flood of telephone calls from parents and sent hundreds of children 
home in tears. Normally, teacher assignments are adjusted after the first month 
of school. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a multimillion-dollar error that is affecting thousands of kids, and 
people who are responsible need to be identified," said Mark Slavkin, the 
school board member representing the Westside. "It is a big mistake and it is 
inexcusable." 
</P>
<P>
Slavkin said he will ask Los Angeles School Supt. Bill Anton to find out why 
district administrators needed nearly two months since the start of school to 
determine how many teachers were needed at schools receiving the bused 
students. 
</P>
<P>
District officials accurately predicted an increase of 15,000 students this 
year, according to Gordon Wohlers, a special assistant to Anton, but apparently 
could not determine what schools the students were attending. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Bernstein, president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, said teachers were 
given only one day's notice of the changes. The teachers were told they would 
be transferred to other schools in the city or used as substitute teachers, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The district must have known about this problem for weeks but we had no idea," 
said Bernstein, whose union represents teachers in the school district. 
</P>
<P>
The 100 teachers were hired this year to accommodate increasing numbers of 
students who ride buses from crowded inner-city neighborhoods to schools on the 
Westside and in the San Fernando Valley. Their salaries have been paid from a 
fund created by the school board several years ago to relieve overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
But without the required number of students per classroom, officials said the 
financially strapped district cannot afford to continue paying for 
smaller-than-average classes. 
</P>
<P>
District officials estimate that the teacher cutbacks will save $3 million that 
would have gone to pay substitute teachers. The district contract guarantees 
the teachers a full-time job through June. 
</P>
<P>
But in a tearful goodby to her students Friday, teacher Jamie Brown said the 
issue was more than money and a job. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not supposed to happen in November," said Brown, who had 25 students 
in her third-grade class at Beckford Avenue School in Northridge. "We've 
started some intense projects and you can't just stop in the middle of them. We 
all cried together."

IMELDA MARCOS SAYS SHE'S ENJOYING LIFE 'IN THE REAL WORLD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MERINA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shorn of her bodyguards and far from the tumult of loyalists and enemies, 
Imelda Marcos sat in her Beverly Hills hotel room nibbling at a pepperoni pizza 
and noted that on her last visit here she was the First Lady of the Philippines 
who dined with industrialist Armand Hammer. 
</P>
<P>
Away from the crowds, she was reflecting Friday on her slide from being one of 
the most visible foreign dignitaries in the world to the survivor of a 
celebrated criminal trial that may have found her innocent but, to many, had 
not cleared her name. 
</P>
<P>
"Before it was Imelda in the Cinderella fairy tale. Now it is Imelda in the 
real world," said the woman who once exchanged toasts with Fidel Castro, glided 
on the dance floor with George Hamilton and swapped dinner conversation with 
Ronald and Nancy Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
"She had an enviable position then, and now she's down here," Marcos said of 
herself. "But she's down with the real world and the real people, and I'm 
enjoying it." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Imelda Romualdez Marcos is enjoying herself once again is both 
liberating to her supporters and galling to her detractors. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos remains a lightning rod of controversy not only in her native country 
but in the Filipino-American community and among other Americans who watched 
her plight as the first wife of a foreign head of state to stand trial on 
criminal charges in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos was charged with fraud and racketeering in New York for allegedly 
joining her late husband, former Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos, in 
looting their country's treasury of more than $200 million and using some of 
the funds to purchase skyscrapers and other real estate in the city. 
</P>
<P>
During a three-month trial that saw her lifestyle dissected, her face on the 
cover of a tabloid newspaper with the headline "OINK," and her own lawyer 
endorsing her reputation as a "world-class shopper," Imelda Marcos became the 
punch line for comedians in two nations. 
</P>
<P>
But last July 2 -- on her 61st birthday -- a federal jury acquitted Marcos of 
all charges. She walked on her knees down the aisle of St. Patrick's Cathedral 
in thanks. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in her Beverly Hills hotel room three months later, Marcos said she 
still felt overwhelmed by her ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
"For someone who is widowed and orphaned from a country and then alien in a 
foreign land, what I went through was something awesome," she said. "Even the 
Bible says there is a special place for those who oppress widows and orphans, 
and I was both." 
</P>
<P>
Marcos, dressed in a black, sequined gown with her hair pulled back, was still 
basking in the boisterous reception she had received only hours before at the 
Carson Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
More than 600 supporters, including some who had traveled from San Diego and 
San Francisco, had packed the hall Thursday night to welcome the woman they 
affectionately called "Mom" -- short for both Madame and Mother or "Nanay" in 
their native Tagalog. 
</P>
<P>
As she entered the hall, Marcos was overwhelmed by the crush of supporters who 
had spelled out her name in balloons, stood whistling on chairs and pushed for 
autographs and pictures. 
</P>
<P>
What Marcos' supporters got, in return, was vintage Imelda -- an hourlong 
speech that defended her family, spoke tearfully of her late husband, quoted 
both the Bible and Madonna, and poked fun at her rumored romance with George 
Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
Imelda regaled them with stories. She sang. She wept. She laughed. And she told 
the crowd that since her acquittal, she is ready to pay some of the reputed 
millions of dollars of her family wealth to settle a massive civil lawsuit 
filed against her by the Philippine government. In return, she said, she hopes 
to be able to return home and bury her husband, who died two years ago before 
he could be tried. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that the verdict is in, that's good money," she said of her financial 
offer. "That's clean money." 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, disagree. Outside the center, some anti-Marcos protesters 
displayed paper banners denouncing her appearance and called her acquittal a 
sham. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm appalled that she would be invited by Filipino people after all the 
looting and plundering her family did in the Philippines," said Teresita 
Salazar of Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
Beside her stood her 6-year-old daughter, who carried a sign reading: "Imelda, 
You Destroyed the Future of the Filipino Children." And her husband, Ludy, held 
another sign aloft: "Imelda, the Whole World Knows You Are Guilty." 
</P>
<P>
But the target of their scorn never saw the signs. Whisked to and from the 
reception in a stretch limousine that avoided the protesters, Marcos was 
constantly surrounded by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies and bodyguards. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos, however, defended some of her expenditures and said they were part of 
her role as the wife of a head of state. 
</P>
<P>
"I was playing a part. I was the First Lady," she said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
As she spoke, Marcos fingered a gold compact case with her name inscribed in 
jewels on the top, and she sought to explain a role that she said many 
Americans do not understand. 
</P>
<P>
Calling herself her country's "mother and First Lady," Marcos likened herself 
to the queen of England. "I'm not trying to be royalty, but you know, what are 
they there for? They are symbols and people live by symbols," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos, who is in Los Angeles to attend a judicial conference this weekend, 
said she is negotiating with the government of Corazon Aquino in hopes of 
returning home in the next few months. Marcos said she does not know the size 
of her family's wealth, but her attorney, James P. Linn, said a partial 
agreement has been reached that could mean some of her fortune will be returned 
to the Philippine government. 
</P>
<P>
"If what I hear is right, she is having problems," a smiling Marcos said of the 
president who replaced her husband. "Here I am. I'm jobless. Maybe I can be of 
help."

RIVAL AIDS WALK SPURRED BY FIGHT FOR PRIVATE FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new AIDS walk-a-thon scheduled Sunday in downtown Los Angeles, touted as a 
means to get private donations to more groups, is the culmination of a 
sometimes bitter conflict between its sponsors and AIDS Project Los Angeles, 
the largest and oldest AIDS agency in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The "Eastside AIDS-Thon" is expected to raise at least $350,000 for 22 AIDS 
service providers and bring attention to the rising incidence of the disease 
among minorities, especially those in East and South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But sponsors also hope the event will break what they consider a monopoly on 
fund raising by APLA's original and more famous "AIDS Walk." 
</P>
<P>
The dispute in the AIDS service sector arose earlier this year, when APLA 
turned down repeated requests by smaller, community-based groups to share the 
planning and wealth of its multimillion-dollar AIDS Walk. 
</P>
<P>
The smaller groups charge that APLA, created in 1982 mainly by and for white, 
gay males, cannot address the cultural and linguistic differences that have 
accompanied rising numbers of minorities with AIDS -- and therefore shouldn't 
have a monopoly on private fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
"The AIDS Walk is the single most important symbol of AIDS effort in Los 
Angeles County," said Michael Weinstein, president of the Hollywood-based AIDS 
Healthcare Foundation, which is spearheading the AIDS-Thon. "Today, it 
symbolizes a monopoly of power rather than a sharing of resources." 
</P>
<P>
APLA has vigorously defended its services and refusal to allow other groups to 
sponsor the AIDS Walk. One official said he wished the AIDS-Thon luck, but 
considered it partly a sabotage effort by jealous, "ego-driven" agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to go around acting like we're a minority organization . . . but 
we provide the services in this town," said Stephen Bennett, APLA's chief 
executive officer. "APLA in the last 90 days has seen its biggest client growth 
in our history. I don't think it's wise to endanger that." 
</P>
<P>
The expected leveling off of the county's commitment to AIDS, at an estimated 
$65 million this year, has increased competition for private funds, such as 
those raised in the annual AIDS Walk. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the first APLA walk raised $600,000 and put the agency in the public's 
eye, Bennett said. This year, the walk attracted 15,000 participants who raised 
$2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
The proceeds never have been shared, Bennett said, because APLA cannot afford 
to give away its revenue. The agency, with a $12-million budget, offers more 
than 20 services, including case management, residential care and free 
groceries, clothing and other staples to more than 70% of the 10,000 AIDS cases 
in the county, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But leaders of smaller service groups say the changing demographics of AIDS has 
altered APLA's role and unique right to proceeds from its walk. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks, Latinos, Asians and other minorities now account for 41% of all AIDS 
cases in the county, up from 29% four years ago, according to June figures 
recorded by the Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
As the statistics change, so does the nature of the problem, service providers 
said. Many minorities with AIDS also are homeless and poor, speak no English 
and know little about how to get help, they said. 
</P>
<P>
APLA has worked with other groups to coordinate services, Bennett said. For 
instance, the agency recently established a computerized client referral system 
with eight other groups, Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
But critics charge that the agency has not been "culturally sensitive" enough 
to communicate with increasingly eclectic AIDS communities. They pointed out 
that nearly three years ago, several Latino administrators of APLA resigned 
after protesting that the organization was insensitive to minority needs. 
</P>
<P>
"What does that really mean, when you say you 'serve' people?" asked the Rev. 
Carl Bean, chief executive officer of Minority AIDS Project, an AIDS-Thon 
sponsor based in South-Central Los Angeles. "If the bulk of the clients that a 
person serves has been upwardly mobile, pretty well-educated and insured . . . 
you're talking about two different worlds." 
</P>
<P>
Last February, Bean and officials of the Healthcare Foundation, Gay and Lesbian 
Community Services Center, Being Alive and Shanti Foundation told APLA the 
public wrongly thought the AIDS Walk benefited the entire AIDS community. It 
was APLA's duty, they said, to share the walk's wealth with smaller agencies, 
who in turn could help increase the profits. 
</P>
<P>
Three months later, APLA turned down the request. But on Sept. 13 -- 10 days 
before the APLA AIDS Walk -- the agency gave $225,000 to nine community-based 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
Healthcare Foundation leaders and other groups thought the move meant their 
campaign had worked. They placed an ad in several gay and lesbian community 
newspapers with the headline, "APLA: A Good First Step." But Bennett firmly 
maintained that the money came from other fund-raisers, not the AIDS Walk. 
</P>
<P>
The refusal to open up the AIDS Walk prompted Weinstein to mobilize 21 other 
small agencies to create the AIDS-Thon. 
</P>
<P>
"It basically became a situation where they had theirs and we needed to have 
ours," Weinstein said. "But we would have preferred to have one event embracing 
all the groups." 
</P>
<P>
The AIDS-Thon begins at 10 a.m. Sunday at the Music Center. It is expected to 
draw at least 5,000 participants through downtown Los Angeles, including the 
Broadway business district and Little Tokyo, to El Pueblo Historic Park near 
Olvera Street. 
</P>
<P>
The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which is financing the event, will receive 50% 
of the proceeds, Weinstein said. The 21 other sponsors will split the other 
50%, depending on how many participants they recruit. 
</P>
<P>
Participants in a walk-a-thon recruit sponsors who pledge a certain amount of 
money for every mile walked. In addition, corporations are solicited.

SUICIDE LEAP KILLS 2 MEN WANTED IN MURDER CASE; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE SUSPECT IN A TEXAS STUDENT'S SHOOTING DEATH JUMPS WITH HIS FRIEND 
FROM THE 12TH FLOOR OF A WEST HOLLYWOOD HOTEL AS POLICE TRY TO ENTER THE ROOM.

<P>
In a bizarre suicide pact, a man wanted in a brutal Texas murder and his best 
friend jumped to their deaths from the 12th floor of a chic Sunset Strip hotel 
before dawn Friday as police tried to break into their suite, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The two men, objects of a nationwide hunt, died where they fell on the sidewalk 
moments after Los Angeles police officers began banging on the door of their 
hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw the open window in the bedroom and looked down and saw the bodies on 
the pavement below," said Sgt. Pat Findley, who led a team of officers into the 
12th-floor room of the Mondrian Hotel on Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Police tentatively identified the dead men as Matthew M. Novanty, 22, and his 
roommate, Jason E. Smith, 19. Novanty was wanted for the widely publicized 
murder two weeks ago in Austin, Tex., of a popular University of Texas 
freshman, Tiffani Ann Bruce, 18. Smith was wanted for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce's partially clothed body was discovered Oct. 21 in her rented home a 
short distance from the University of Texas campus. Dead at least two days when 
found, she had been bound and shot twice in the head and once in the chest at 
close range, Austin police said. Investigators believe Novanty had wanted a 
romantic relationship with Bruce, whom he met through his job as a door-to-door 
solicitor for an environmental company. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Novanty and Smith) had a fixation on death," Austin Police Sgt. Brent 
McDonald, in charge of the Bruce case, said in a telephone interview. "They 
were into . . . death and suicide. They talked about suicide and read material 
pertaining to that." 
</P>
<P>
Novanty and Smith, described by Austin authorities as "close friends," dropped 
out of sight right after Bruce's murder and apparently fled to the Los Angeles 
area in an effort to elude a widening dragnet, which grew to include the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, they checked into their $275-a-night suite at the exclusive 
Mondrian, a favorite haunt of celebrities and rock stars, ordered room service 
and did nothing that would attract extraordinary attention from hotel 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the early hours of Friday, the two fugitives made a telephone call 
from their room to a friend in Austin and spoke of a suicide pact, Lt. Juan 
Gonzalez of the Austin Police Department said. Gonzalez said the friend 
reported the content of the call to police. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said Austin authorities traced the call to West Hollywood and notified 
the Los Angeles Police Department's Hollywood Division, which immediately 
dispatched officers to the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
There, police climbed to the 12th-floor suite, tried the door's combination 
lock but found it was secured with a deadbolt. A hotel employee with a key was 
summoned. As police struggled with the door, the officers heard a "rustling" 
sound, Los Angeles police spokesman Cmdr. William Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
"It could have been the window being opened. It could have been the breeze," 
Booth said. "When they gained entry, they found no one." 
</P>
<P>
The bodies were found, side-by-side, on Olive Drive off of Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which has jurisdiction in West 
Hollywood, where the Mondrian is located, took over the investigation Friday 
morning and since then has refused to discuss the case. Deputies said they 
would await fingerprints before confirming the identity of the dead men. 
</P>
<P>
Novanty, a senior majoring in communications at the University of Texas, and 
Smith, a sophomore engineering student, lived together off-campus and had both 
dropped out of school this semester, university records show. 
</P>
<P>
The two went to work part time for Clean Water Action, a firm that works on 
environmental issues, as door-to-door neighborhood canvassers. Austin police 
and the Travis County district attorney's office said Novanty met Bruce, the 
murder victim, while on his job, became attracted to her, then apparently 
returned later. 
</P>
<P>
In an arrest warrant issued by a Texas court on Oct. 24, Novanty was quoted as 
having told friends he wanted to "date" Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
"He went back to her, possibly in an attempt to follow through with his 
attraction," Travis County Assistant Dist. Atty. Terry Keel said. "We have some 
evidence there was a struggle that took place." 
</P>
<P>
Keel said police would investigate whether Novanty could be tied to a string of 
unsolved rapes in the same Hyde Park neighborhood where Bruce lived, but he 
cautioned that Novanty could not yet be considered a suspect in those cases. 
Neither Keel nor Austin police would say whether Bruce, a fashion and design 
major and honors student, had been sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
Austin police said they were able to tie Novanty to the murder when a palm 
print in Bruce's dried blood matched prints taken of Novanty in a 1989 drug 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce's murder had convulsed the University of Texas campus and shocked people 
who knew and worked with all parties involved. 
</P>
<P>
"We were totally shocked, shocked and angered and betrayed when we even heard 
that he (Novanty) might be involved," said Mary Anne Neely, Novanty's boss at 
Clean Water Action. She described him as quiet, shy and "a good worker" who 
gave no signs of trouble.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GILLESPIE UNDER REVIEW FOR QUALIFICATION AS 
JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian has submitted Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie's 
name to the state Bar's Commission on Judicial Nominees Evaluation for their 
opinion on whether she is qualified to be named a Los Angeles Superior Court 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the commission who disclosed this, but asked not to be identified, 
said that the action means that Gillespie probably will be appointed if the 
commission decides she is qualified. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Deukmejian said the governor's office would have no comment. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie, the last appointed insurance commissioner before the job becomes an 
elective post in January, said last winter when she decided not to run for the 
post that she would not return to an insurance industry job. Before she was 
appointed, she had been counsel to a company.

LOCAL ELECTIONS / SUPERIOR COURT JUDGES; 
</P>
<P>
NO OPPOSITION MEANS NO PLACE ON BALLOT FOR 66 INCUMBENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED ROHRLICH, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sixty-six of Los Angeles County's 238 Superior Court judges are up for election 
next week, but you'd never know it by looking at Tuesday's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
They're not on it. 
</P>
<P>
Because no one is challenging them, they will automatically win six-year terms 
without having to be voted upon, in accordance with a 1963 state law that 
appears to have been intended to help them avoid dirtying their robes with 
electoral politics. 
</P>
<P>
In upholding the constitutionality of this law, the state Court of Appeal 
declared in 1965, "The Constitution does not require that there be an actual 
balloting and tabulation of votes" for incumbent judges who are unchallenged. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court justices are required to appear 
on ballots to win public confirmation of their 12-year terms, after their 
gubernatorial appointments. Although no one can run against them, the public 
gets a chance to vote for or against them, in what are known as retention 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
The special electoral treatment of California's judges reflects a philosophical 
splitting of the difference between arguments that they should be treated like 
other public officeholders and held strictly accountable for their actions at 
the polls, and arguments that they should be appointed, like federal judges, 
for life, in a system in which judicial independence is most prized. 
</P>
<P>
Under California's system, the governor appoints the vast majority of Municipal 
and Superior Court judges, but state law requires them to run for office at the 
next election. 
</P>
<P>
This year's Los Angeles Superior Court elections were effectively decided last 
March 9, when no one gathered the 20 signatures on a nominating petition or 
paid the $898 filing fee to be listed as a challenger. 
</P>
<P>
It became clear 10 days later that no incumbents would even be listed on the 
ballot, when no one filed a petition with the 100 signatures necessary to mount 
a write-in campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, one incumbent judge, Lourdes Baird, was challenged in the June 
primary. But at the time, it was widely known in legal circles that she was 
likely to become the chief federal prosecutor in Los Angeles. Presumably 
because this was not widely known by the electorate, she defeated her 
challenger, then resigned from the court when her presidential appointment as 
U.S. attorney came through. Gov. George Deukmejian must appoint her successor. 
</P>
<P>
In his nearly eight years in office, Deukmejian has appointed more than 750 of 
the 1,500 judges now sitting in California. 
</P>
<P>
While there traditionally is very little interest in running for the office, 
"there certainly aren't a lack of people interested in becoming judges," said 
Terrance W. Flanigan, the governor's appointments secretary. He said the 
governor has received 4,000 applications from lawyers seeking judgeships since 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
The electoral route is unpopular for several reasons. 
</P>
<P>
* It is expensive, particularly in large counties. In Los Angeles County -- 
which has more people than all but six states -- just mailing ballot pamphlets 
with a brief statement about who you are and what you believe in costs about 
$60,000. "If you wanted to wage a campaign over and above that, it would 
probably cost you another $50,000 to $100,000," said county presiding Superior 
Court Judge Richard P. Byrne. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court judges earn $94,344 a year. 
</P>
<P>
If a judge is not independently wealthy, he will have to raise campaign funds 
-- probably from lawyers who may appear before him in the future. This can 
create, at the least, an appearance of unfairness. 
</P>
<P>
* It is seen as unseemly. If you mount a successful challenge, the incumbent's 
colleagues are likely to snub you, said Frank Zolin, who, as Los Angeles County 
clerk-executive officer, is the longtime chief administrator for the Superior 
Courts. 
</P>
<P>
If you lose, you may look foolish. And, in a small county, you may have to 
appear in court later before the judge you challenged. 
</P>
<P>
* It is hard to beat an incumbent. Particularly in large areas, most people 
don't know how to evaluate judicial contenders. The word "judge" in front of 
one of their names on a ballot may be the most significant piece of information 
voters have, said Joseph Cerrell, a political consultant popular with judicial 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County in 1980, four Superior Court incumbents were challenged. 
All the incumbents won. In 1982, four were challenged. Three won. The one who 
lost was literally on his deathbed. In 1984, only one incumbent was challenged. 
He won. In 1986, there were no challenges. And in 1988, there were three. Two 
of the incumbents won. 
</P>
<P>
The big year for incumbent challenges was in 1978, midway through the tenure of 
liberal Democratic Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. Statewide, the number of challenges 
increased from six in 1970 to 28 that year, nine of which were in Los Angeles 
County, according to figures compiled by California State University professors 
Charles G. Bell and Charles M. Price. 
</P>
<P>
The 1978 surge is widely attributed to dissatisfaction among some prosecutors 
with the judges Brown was appointing, who, they charged, were "soft on crime." 
Despite the emotionally powerful charge, only one incumbent was unseated in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's appointees have tended to be strong law-and-order advocates. 
Figures compiled by California Lawyer magazine in mid-1988 showed that 55% were 
prosecutors and another 14% were other types of government attorneys. Only 40% 
had ever worked in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
As a conservative governor, one would expect electoral challenges to his judges 
to come from liberals. "There just aren't that many liberal Democrats out there 
hungry to be judges," said Cerrell. "I don't know (why). Maybe they're making 
too much money." 
</P>
<P>
There appears to be declining interest in becoming a judge among private 
attorneys, particularly in big cities where salaries for accomplished lawyers 
in major firms can easily exceed $500,000 a year, and even some third-year 
lawyers are paid as much as judges. 
</P>
<P>
Judgeships may have become less attractive for other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The workload is increasing faster than the number of judges. "Each individual 
judge is required to do more . . . and frankly, a lot of the fun and personal 
satisfaction of the job has diminished," said Byrne. 
</P>
<P>
While being a Superior Court judge might result in wide recognition and high 
status in Siskiyou County, where there is only one, said court administrator 
Zolin, it is considerably less of a big deal in Los Angeles, where there are 
238. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of job security is another factor. 
</P>
<P>
Although challenges are few, being singled out for a challenge is a nightmarish 
prospect for judges. While some are chosen because particularly controversial 
decisions have attracted media attention, others are picked arbitrarily. 
</P>
<P>
As an alternative to the appointment process and to avoid the difficulties of 
running against an incumbent, the system provides one other way to become a 
judge: Running for an open seat. 
</P>
<P>
An open seat is created when a judge announces he will retire at the end of his 
term. This acts as a "release valve . . . for anybody who wants to run," said 
Cerrell. It also allows incumbent judges politically at odds with the governor 
to avoid giving him the opportunity to name their replacements. 
</P>
<P>
The only judicial races in Los Angeles County on Tuesday's ballot are runoffs 
from two such such open contests in Municipal Courts -- in Downey and Santa 
Monica -- that were not decided in June because none of the candidates received 
a clear majority. 
</P>
<P>
In the only other election for Superior Court in Los Angeles County this year, 
a Compton Municipal Court judge ran unopposed for an open Superior Court seat 
in the June primary. He won, but rather than wait for January when he would 
routinely take office after the general election, Superior Court officials 
asked the governor to appoint him to their understaffed court immediately. The 
governor complied.

CULTURES: WILLIAM EIYA OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA CAPTIVATES SCHOOLCHILDREN AND ADULTS 
WITH ACCOUNT OF HIS LIFE. HIS VIEW OF L.A.: 'NOT ENOUGH FRESH AIR.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Activity came to a sudden halt at the chic Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel when 
William Eiya arrived Friday for a luncheon engagement. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it was because he walked in barefooted, wearing a huge, bat-shaped wig 
constructed from human hair and bird feathers atop his head. Or maybe it was 
because he rustled across the lobby wearing only a skimpy loincloth made from 
beads, thatched vines and pigs' tails around his waist. 
</P>
<P>
Eiya is a Stone Age jungle warrior from the remote central highlands of Papua 
New Guinea who stopped briefly in Los Angeles on his first trip to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
During a quick visit to the county Natural History Museum where he wanted to 
gaze at dinosaur bones, Eiya surprised schoolchildren on an American history 
field trip by displaying his own polished bone club and telling them of the 
seven wives he left back home. 
</P>
<P>
At the hotel, his unexpected appearance startled society matrons and prompted 
double takes from businessmen crowded into the hotel bar. 
</P>
<P>
"He was stopping traffic outside," said Inger Drysdale of Pasadena, who was so 
jolted by the sight of Eiya that she at first failed to notice the woman she 
had come to the hotel to meet, Ann Pascoe. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought you were going to walk into the wall," said Pascoe, of Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Said businessman Joseph Fuenzalita of Encino: "You don't normally see people 
like that here. You see it in Hollywood, not Beverly Hills." 
</P>
<P>
You don't see sights like he was seeing on Friday back home in the Tari Basin 
of eastern New Guinea, either, acknowledged Eiya -- who had stopped on his way 
to a travel agents' conference in Houston. He was flown here by Air Niugini, 
the national airline of Papua New Guinea. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to tell people (back home) about the United States," he said. "I'm 
going to tell them you can't live here without a car. I could not live here. 
There are too many cars and big buildings. There's not enough fresh air." 
</P>
<P>
Eiya, who figures he is about 42 years old, is a member of the Huli tribe. 
About 38,000 Hulis live in scattered hamlets across the center of New Guinea. 
Their existence was discovered in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
Known in New Guinea as "wig men" because of the intricate human-hair wigs and 
ceremonial face paint worn by males, the Hulis are subsistence farmers who grow 
sweet potatoes, taro and sugar cane in fenced gardens. They are also known as a 
warlike people who arm themselves with bows and arrows; in the past, skirmishes 
between Huli groups have involved thousands of arrow-shooting marksmen and 
lasted for months. 
</P>
<P>
But Eiya, who works as a tour guide when he isn't tending his own vegetable 
garden, indicated he is more of a lover than a fighter. 
</P>
<P>
"I have seven wives," he told wide-eyed fifth-graders from Locust Elementary 
School in Fontana at the Natural History Museum. "I'll probably have another 10 
wives. I'll stop when I'm 60." 
</P>
<P>
He said he had to pay a fee of about 25 pigs to the parents of each of his 
wives. "You have to build separate huts for every one of them because they 
don't like to live together," he added, explaining that the huts are scattered 
around the edge of his vegetable garden. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Eiya said, he is the father of two girls and one boy -- by his first 
wife. He said he is looking forward to the day when they marry and he collects 
his own pig payoff. 
</P>
<P>
At the museum, the children weren't exactly hog wild about the Huli marriage 
custom, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Seven wives would fight with each other," said Donnie Mason, 10. "I only want 
one wife. I have just one girlfriend now." 
</P>
<P>
Said classmate Jennifer Childers, also 10: "Donnie wishes he had more 
girlfriends!"

USC'S SMITH KEEPS HIS STARTER A SECRET; 
</P>
<P>
TROJANS: HE DELAYS ANNOUNCING WHETHER MARINOVICH OR FOLEY WILL BE QUARTERBACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After watching them compete in practice all week, Coach Larry Smith announced 
Friday that USC's starting quarterback in today's game against California would 
be . . . 
</P>
<P>
Todd Marinovich. 
</P>
<P>
Or Shane Foley. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the competition too close to call -- "Both Todd and Shane had great 
practices this week," he said -- Smith promised at least to choose before the 
Trojans take the field at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
When Marinovich was suspended by Smith last week for cutting class, Foley 
filled in capably, if not spectacularly, passing for 125 yards and running for 
60 in a 13-6 victory over Arizona State at Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
It has been assumed that Marinovich, who was reinstated Monday, would win back 
the job in practice this week and would call the signals as the Trojans attempt 
to give Smith his 100th victory as a major college coach -- by winning for the 
50th time in USC's 78 games against Cal. The Trojans, incidentally, have beaten 
no other team more often. 
</P>
<P>
Whichever quarterback is tabbed by Smith, he will line up against a Cal defense 
that ranks eighth in the Pacific 10 Conference against the pass, seventh 
against the run and last overall. 
</P>
<P>
"We're kind of scrambling a little bit defensively," Coach Bruce Snyder said. 
"We have been inconsistent in terms of our secondary play. We've also been 
injured in the secondary, which has added to the inconsistency, (and) we're 
thin at inside linebacker." 
</P>
<P>
Cal has given up 435.5 yards and 33.1 points a game. Washington ran for 396 
yards against the Bears; Miami passed for 473. 
</P>
<P>
Five times in eight games, however, the Bears have outscored their opponents. 
They are 3-2 in the Pac-10 and, for a change, stayed in the Rose Bowl race 
longer than USC. 
</P>
<P>
A 46-7 defeat by Washington last Saturday all but knocked them out, but the 
Bears still hope to end the season with a winning record for the first time 
since 1982 and attract a bowl bid for the first time since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Led by quarterback Mike Pawlawski, tailbacks Russell White and Anthony Wallace 
and an experienced, resilient line, Cal ranks third in the Pac-10 in total 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
Pawlawski, a fiery junior from Troy High in Fullerton, was one of the first 
players recruited by Snyder, who formerly coached running backs for the Rams 
and USC. 
</P>
<P>
"I was damn near a neighbor of his while I was coaching (with) the Rams," said 
Snyder, who is in his fourth season at Cal. "Mike is a very competitive, 
physical player." 
</P>
<P>
A backup to Troy Taylor in his first two seasons, Pawlawski has completed 58% 
of his 226 passes for 1,550 yards and 12 touchdowns. He has thrown 10 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Cal's strength, though, is a running game that has averaged 202.8 yards to rank 
third in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
White, a sophomore from Crespi High in Encino and a nephew of former USC 
tailback Charles White, has yet to start, but has rushed for a team-high 737 
yards and scored eight touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"He has changed the whole Cal team," Smith said of White, who was recruited by 
USC. 
</P>
<P>
White ran for a state-record 5,998 yards at Crespi, but he sat out last season 
after failing to meet the academic requirements of the NCAA's Proposition 48. 
</P>
<P>
He has had a major impact on the Bears, averaging 5.3 yards a carry, but he has 
been only slightly better than Wallace, a senior from Altadena who has rushed 
for 731 yards and three touchdowns, averaging 4.6 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
"(White) has been a tremendous addition to our team from Anthony Wallace's 
perspective," Snyder said. "Anthony is playing better because of Russell 
White." 
</P>
<P>
In the Washington loss last week, Wallace ran for only 16 yards in six carries 
before a sprained knee forced him out of the game. White ran for 121 yards in 
19 carries against a defense that ranks first in the nation against the run. 
</P>
<P>
Both will play today. 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Larry Smith's coaching record in more than 14 seasons at Tulane, Arizona and 
USC is 99-65-4. He is 33-10-1 at USC. . . . Smith said it was possible that 
both Todd Marinovich and Shane Foley would play today. . . . Marinovich needs 
14 completions to move past Sean Salisbury and into second place on USC's 
all-time passing list. . . . Cal's Anthony Wallace and Russell White are both 
on pace to rush for more than 1,000 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Seven freshmen are expected to start for USC. . . . Cal, which ended an 18-game 
losing streak against UCLA with a 38-31 victory two weeks ago at Berkeley, 
hasn't beaten UCLA and USC in the same season since 1958. . . . Eight of Cal's 
11 offensive starters are from Southern California.

LAKERS PREPARED FOR AN EYE-OPENER; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: STILL ADJUSTING TO CHANGES, THEY START THE SEASON WITH A TALL TEST 
AT SAN ANTONIO.

<TEXT>
<P>
The proprietors of Showtime are lashing down the circus tents for heavy 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers will open their season and Mike Dunleavy's career as a head coach 
today against the Spurs with more worries than David Robinson and a Hemisfair 
full of screeching Texans. 
</P>
<P>
With a new coach, a new starting center, two other new players in the rotation 
and a system they still don't have down, the nine-time defending Pacific 
Division champions face unusual uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
The only question used to be: How to best stay interested till the finals? 
</P>
<P>
"We'd go in, we knew what we were going to do," Magic Johnson says. "We'd look 
at that first 20 games and we already knew -- and basically it was right to 
detail. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd look at 20 games and say, 'We want to be 17-3.' " 
</P>
<P>
Don't laugh, that's what they decided they wanted to do last season -- and 
settled for 15-5. 
</P>
<P>
This season's early schedule? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I looked at it," Johnson said. "This year, it's more us getting our team 
together than saying, 'Da-da-da-da-da.' 
</P>
<P>
"It's all new now. We'll see what happens. I think it's going to take 10 games 
to see where we're at. And then we'll go from there to set goals." 
</P>
<P>
You can find the Lakers' cause for optimism in a hurry: 
</P>
<P>
They're still the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
Or as Phoenix Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons said: 
</P>
<P>
"Have you checked the obituaries? I haven't seen Magic's name in there. I 
haven't seen (James) Worthy's name in there. Until you do, they're still the 
team to beat." 
</P>
<P>
But the final three exhibitions had a decided un-Laker feel: a 30-point loss to 
the Golden State Warriors, followed by victories over the overmatched New 
Jersey Nets in which the Lakers scored only 103 and 94 points. They shot 43% 
and, apart from James Worthy, no starter shot 44%. 
</P>
<P>
Dunleavy said he hadn't been able to install everything he had intended. "There 
are a lot of changes and some of them, I guess, are going to be slow in 
coming," he said. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Jerry West acknowledged concern, saying, "At this point in 
time, we have a lot of catching up to do." 
</P>
<P>
Everything is a puzzle. West seems once more, against all odds, to have 
upgraded the roster. But everyone else in the West did, too, so was it enough? 
</P>
<P>
Sam Perkins, signed at a no-bargain free-agent price of $19.2 million over six 
seasons, gives the Lakers a quality, if unspectacular, big man who can play all 
along the front line. He's an improvement over the flashier Orlando Woolridge, 
even if the souped-up Denver Nugget offense lands Woolridge among the top 10 
scorers. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Teagle takes the place of Michael Cooper. If no one can match Cooper's 
kind of intangibles, Teagle brings, in Johnson's words, "scoring at that spot 
that we haven't ever had here." 
</P>
<P>
If there is concern about a player, it falls on the bearded and celebrated head 
of Vlade Divac. 
</P>
<P>
After his intriguing rookie season, West made him No. 1 at the start of the 
summer. But the Lakers haven't liked what they have seen since. 
</P>
<P>
Originally projected as a big forward, it's an open question anyway whether he 
can play defensive center. Divac's promotion may be cosmetic. Mychal Thompson 
played more minutes than Divac through the first seven exhibitions and Dunleavy 
has Perkins warmed up to relieve there, too. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the cast you know: 
</P>
<P>
James Worthy -- Shot 55% in exhibitions, ready to prove his playoff slump 
against Phoenix was an aberration. 
</P>
<P>
Byron Scott -- Psyched and feeling sound, he looks capable of rebounding from 
his two-season slide. 
</P>
<P>
A.C. Green -- The working man's Laker and still the starter but Perkins will 
push him. 
</P>
<P>
Mychal Thompson -- Brains and muscle still make him useful at 35, although the 
Lakers aren't keen to expose him full-time to big, young opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Drew -- Faded away last season, grew unhappy with Pat Riley as his 
minutes varied. Looking better now. 
</P>
<P>
Elden Campbell -- At 6-11, the last pick on the first round, he looked like a 
coup but spent the exhibition season in foul trouble. He'll have an uphill 
battle for playing time but has raw talent. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson -- Enough said. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
In his own debut, former coach Pat Riley will be co-host of the NBC telecast 
from New York. Says Riley: "I don't think you can really judge the Lakers in 
preseason. Those guys are going to play together, the five-six who've been 
there. And I think the new guys will fit right in. As soon as they get really 
comfortable with what Mike (Dunleavy) wants, I don't think they'll be anything 
but a great team." . . . Magic Johnson on opening here: "It's exciting. It's 
fun. Why not? That's what it's all about. Let's go somewhere where it's wild 
and crazy. Hey this is the team (Spurs) that's supposed to win the West -- so 
let's go up and see."

MELVIN DURSLAG: EXCESSIVE CELEBRATING IS IN POOR TASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was the inspiration in 1984 of professional football owners to introduce an 
anti-taunt rule, aimed essentially at discouraging one side from irritating the 
other, if, indeed, not causing it to take muscular exception. 
</P>
<P>
The rule specifies that one can draw five or 15 yards -- depending upon the 
severity of the crime -- for "prolonged, excessive or premeditated celebrations 
by individual players or groups of players." 
</P>
<P>
No rule in football is administered more loosely. Maybe it is because officials 
witness celebrations on almost every play. 
</P>
<P>
It no longer seems possible for a tackle to be made, or a pass knocked down, or 
a pass completed, without someone on the field celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
And a touchdown? That's New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrating after plays is wrecking the game. It breaks the concentration of 
those watching. And the taste is so questionable that it is hard to believe 
young guys are engaged in a sports event. 
</P>
<P>
We are looking at the Rams and Pittsburgh last Monday night. Robert Delpino of 
the Rams is returning a kickoff when he and Tyronne Stowe of the Steelers have 
an accident. Helmet lowered, Stowe rams the helmet of Delpino. 
</P>
<P>
The collision is shuddering. Delpino is knocked out. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't even remember leaving Pittsburgh that night. 
</P>
<P>
While Delpino is stretched on the turf, Stowe raises his arms triumphantly and 
performs a bit of Terpsichore, soon joined by teammate Jerrol Williams, who 
turns the scene into Mardi Gras. 
</P>
<P>
Mind you, Williams is only a kibitzer, and he is carrying on as if he has 
finished off the Iraqis. 
</P>
<P>
Well, this is one of those isolated cases where a flag is thrown for 
celebrating. The Steelers get 15 yards. Delpino doesn't know it. And he has a 
headache until the following Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
It is not charged here that Pittsburgh tried purposely to injure the 
ballcarrier. Nor is it hinted that when the celebrating took place, the 
celebrants even knew that Delpino was hurt badly. 
</P>
<P>
But since such a possibility always exists in football, and since the victim 
was laid out like a bowling lane, you would guess that before a dance begins, 
it first be ascertained whether the guy below is alive. 
</P>
<P>
Tracing the start in sports of self-commendation, which is to say, the 
love-me-for-what-I-have-just-done habit, students of human behavior usually 
begin with Olympic champions from Europe, beginning in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
It became the practice of the winner to take a victory lap, waving to his 
adoring minions, receiving their adulation. 
</P>
<P>
Then soccer picks up the custom. Scoring a goal, a guy goes coconuts, jumping 
up and down, opening his arms for embraces, even kisses, from teammates. 
</P>
<P>
And the next thing you know, it spreads to hockey. 
</P>
<P>
You offer thanks the habit hasn't spread to the NBA, where in a night maybe 230 
points are involved. 
</P>
<P>
Allowing for celebrations, a game would take eight hours. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, celebrations would make their way to football, starting with 
touchdown efforts. Jim Brown was once asked why he comported himself so quietly 
in end zones. He responded: "I've been there before." 
</P>
<P>
You never saw O.J. Simpson dance or spike. Or Franco Harris, John Riggins or 
Earl Campbell. Do you see Marcus Allen make a production in the end zone today? 
He has scored 84 touchdowns, more than any other Raider. 
</P>
<P>
One day we asked Ted Hendricks, who would go to the Hall of Fame, why he never 
turned a tackle into a musical revue. The question stunned him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm expected to make tackles," he answered. "The only time a scene should be 
created is when I miss one." 
</P>
<P>
Coming up with a rule to water down celebrating, football should have stuck 
with it faithfully to discourage an athletic contest from degenerating into 
something suggesting wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
What you see out there today is just short of burlesque. If the two teams run 
140 plays, you might see exhibitionism of some sort on 135. 
</P>
<P>
And when you see celebrations over a fallen carcass, as you did in the case of 
the Rams' Delpino the other night, you've got to draw back and ask idly where 
the game is heading. 
</P>
<P>
The rule against showboating is clearly on the books. It was put there to 
restore the dignity of the sport and of those who play it. 
</P>
<P>
Each time the arms go up and the dance begins, the referee arriving on the 
scene should do a soft shoe, dropping a flag along the way.

THE ACES KEEP COMING SIFFORD'S WAY, BUT HE COMES UP ON THE SHORT END

Charlie Sifford keeps making holes in one in local tournaments, but has trouble 
cashing in on them. 
</P>
<P>
Sifford, using a two-iron, scored an ace on the 208-yard third hole Friday at 
Rancho Park during the first round of the $500,000 Security Pacific Senior 
Classic. 
</P>
<P>
He picked the wrong day and the wrong hole for it. If he had done it on the 
17th today or Sunday, he would have won a car. All he got on No. 3 was two 
under par on the way to a 72, one over. 
</P>
<P>
In the last senior event in Los Angeles, at MountainGate in 1986, Sifford also 
shot a hole in one. The hole had been designated as worth $100,000 for an ace, 
but the insurance policy failed to come through and the offer was withdrawn. 
But when Sifford, an early starter, made his hole in one, the sign proclaiming 
the $100,000 offer was still up. 
</P>
<P>
Sifford went to court and won a judgment for the $100,000. DAN HAFNER

NOTHING PETTY ABOUT THIS KIND OF INCENTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
AUTO RACING: IF KYLE PETTY GETS ONE MORE VICTORY OR POLE, HE AND HIS CREW OF 17 
GET A TRIP TO THE BAHAMAS, COURTESY OF CAR OWNER FELIX SABATES.

<P>
The pressure on Mark Martin and Dale Earnhardt in their separate quests for a 
$1-million check as the NASCAR Winston Cup champion is immense, but what about 
Kyle Petty? 
</P>
<P>
The third-generation stock car driver needs a victory here Sunday in the 
Checker 500 or a pole or victory Nov. 18 in the Atlanta Journal 500 to reach a 
goal set for him by his car owner, Felix Sabates. If he reaches that goal, the 
reward is an expenses-paid trip to the Bahamas for his crew of 17 and their 
wives or girlfriends. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing I know for certain, I don't have to worry that all the crew isn't 
putting out 100%," Petty said Friday as he watched the crew change an engine in 
his baby blue No. 42 Pontiac Grand Prix. "They're as (excited) about the trip 
as I am." 
</P>
<P>
Before the season, Sabates set a goal of three victories or poles for Petty. 
</P>
<P>
Kyle got two of them the same weekend, winning his first pole and then 
following it up by winning the Goodwrench 500 at North Carolina Motor Speedway 
in Rockingham, N.C. It was only the third race of the season, but it earned 
Petty a NASCAR single-race record purse of $294,450, thanks to an oil company 
bonus of $228,600 for being the first pole winner to win a race in 26 starts. 
</P>
<P>
The bonus was $7,600 a race and the money rolled over 26 times before Petty hit 
the jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
Petty got his own private bonus from Sabates after the race -- a gold-colored 
Rolls Royce. 
</P>
<P>
"That race meant a tremendous amount to me," Sabates said. "It proved that the 
team that Gary (Nelson) and I had assembled could not only win, but could 
dominate a race. And it also proved that Kyle really has the heart it takes to 
be a winning race-car driver." 
</P>
<P>
Sabates knows something about having heart. 
</P>
<P>
When he was 16, he was in the hills of his native Cuba, fighting Fidel Castro. 
Only the intervention of his priest and his father kept him from getting 
killed. The gang he had been with was wiped out shortly after he left. 
</P>
<P>
"My father faked an 'emergency appendectomy' for me and had me sent to Miami 
for 'emergency care,' " Sabates recalled. "It was the only way I could have got 
out of Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
"I landed in Miami with two shirts, $25 and two boxes of cigars. I sold the 
cigars at the airport for another $25 and went to live with a friend of my 
father's in Miami for a week. I couldn't speak English or anything." 
</P>
<P>
Sabates bounced around, living with friends or relatives wherever he could, 
scratching out a living washing pots and pans in a hospital, selling cookware 
door to door, sanding furniture in a North Carolina factory -- anything he 
could find. 
</P>
<P>
"I was living with my aunt, but we didn't get along and she kicked me out of 
the house on Christmas Eve," he said. "I went and lived in a flophouse . . . 
for a few months." 
</P>
<P>
By 1963 he had learned enough English to get a job selling cars in Charlotte, 
N.C., where he worked for Rick Hendrick, now one of NASCAR's leading car 
owners. There he also met Walter Rice, a friend of his father, who suggested 
that Sabates quit selling cars and help him establish a new company, Top Sales, 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Top Sales, which among other things distributes Nintendo games throughout the 
southwestern United States, did more than $400 million in business last year. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Sabates decided he wanted to start a race team. His first step was to 
hire Nelson as crew chief. Nelson, who hails from Redlands, Calif., began his 
apprenticeship on the West Coast as a mechanic for Ivan Baldwin before heading 
south, where he directed Bobby Allison's only Winston Cup championship season 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Next he looked for a promising driver and lured young Petty away from the Wood 
Brothers' team. At the time, Petty was torn between racing and singing. He had 
been racing Winston Cup cars for seven seasons but had won only two races and 
had never finished higher than seventh in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
"People never gave Kyle a fair shot," Sabates said. "Half of him imagined that 
he was the next Willie Nelson and the other half thought he had to be the next 
Richard Petty. It was tough on him, but I think he's back on the right path 
now. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Kyle's best years are ahead of him. If you look at the top drivers of 
today, most of them have become very successful after they turn 30. Kyle turned 
30 last June and I think he will do very well in the next couple of years as we 
grow together as a team." 
</P>
<P>
Petty did not fare so well Friday, though, qualifying 26th at 121.729 m.p.h., 
not good enough to make the first 20 qualifiers. Rusty Wallace, in another 
Pontiac, won the pole at 124.443. 
</P>
<P>
A second 20 will qualify today for Sunday's 40-car field. 
</P>
<P>
"The car races better than it did in practice," Petty said. "We're not worried. 
We'll make the show tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
His speed, though, was faster than his illustrious father's. The seven-time 
NASCAR champion could coax only 120.128 m.p.h. from his Pontiac. 
</P>
<P>
"The track was fast, but I was slow," quipped Richard Petty.

FORUM FIGHT WILL HELP FANS FORGET

Fans burdened by the unpleasantness of last week's one-punch fight for the 
heavyweight championship should get a lift Monday night at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The following are guaranteed to happen: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Paul Banke will show up fit and primed for battle. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If he goes down, he will get up. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Win or lose, fans will cheer his name when it's over. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Banke will be paid $60,000, not $19,075,000. 
</P>
<P>
After a week during which a heavyweight championship fight and cowardice are 
mentioned in the same breath, it will be reassuring to watch once more a 
fighter who consistently offers the kind of intensity and excitement so rarely 
seen in boxing today. 
</P>
<P>
Banke stands 5 feet 4 and weighs 122 pounds. He hits as if rocks, not fists, 
were in his gloves. His kind of courage under fire -- he seems to be at his 
best when he is hurt -- is rare, even in a sport where bravery is mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
Banke is probably Southern California's most popular fighter, and with good 
reason. On the night of April 23, 1990, he won the allegiance of 5,937 at the 
Forum with one of those performances that will be remembered for a lifetime. He 
fought back from certain defeat and stopped Daniel Zaragoza in the ninth round 
to win the World Boxing Council's super-bantamweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
The little guy from Azusa was a champion at last. 
</P>
<P>
In more than 20 years of boxing at the Forum, this was as good as it had ever 
been. Banke and Zaragoza hammered away at each other. In every round, it 
seemed, someone would surely fall. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Zaragoza did. 
</P>
<P>
Banke had shown an unremitting will to win. Many who saw that victory will be 
back for more Monday, when Banke makes his first Forum appearance since then, 
defending his title against Pedro Decima of Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
But it may be that if Banke retains his championship for another five years, no 
one in this country will have seen his greatest victory. Last Aug. 18, in 
Ichon, South Korea, he was up against a rugged opponent, Lee Ki-Jun. Banke's 
left eye became severely swollen. 
</P>
<P>
But for the second straight fight, Banke, behind on points, had more at the 
finish than his opponent. Exhausted and with one eye swollen shut in the 12th 
round, he nonetheless knocked Lee down twice, and the referee stopped the 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
Such courage seemed to be missing in one contestant in the big Las Vegas fight 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
Banke will come into Monday's fight without having sparred. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul sparred nine rounds total before the fight in South Korea and five rounds 
before the Zaragoza fight," said Banke's trainer, Steve Rosenzweig. Banke 
recently moved from Quail Valley in Riverside County to Richfield, Utah, so he 
could train at the 5,500-foot altitude. 
</P>
<P>
"He won't spar a single round for this fight," Rosenzweig said. "We don't 
believe in getting a fighter beaten up in the gym. What's the point? I wear 
body pads and sparring mitts when we're in the ring. We feel we're extending 
the life of the fighter. We work mainly on timing, and you don't have to get 
hit to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the animosity that people who run amateur boxing hold for 
professional boxing, Southern Californians will probably see Oscar de la Hoya, 
possibly the country's best amateur boxer, only on television before the 1992 
Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
What's wrong with prominent amateurs boxing in exhibitions on the undercards of 
pro shows at major venues, such as the Forum? Nothing, really . . . but it 
probably will never happen. "First, it's an international rule, not a national 
rule," said Paul Konnor, a Milwaukee attorney who is a vice president of AIBA, 
amateur boxing's world governing body. 
</P>
<P>
"Second, we're constantly getting lumped in with pro boxing by the American 
Medical Assn. people who want to ban boxing, so for that reason alone we try to 
stay as far removed from pro boxing as we can. 
</P>
<P>
"The best way for people in Southern California to see De la Hoya and the other 
top amateurs is for someone there to bid on our major 1991 events, like the 
USA-Cuba and USA-Soviet Union competitions." 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, an obvious inconsistency in these arguments for separating 
amateurs and pros. On a practical level, there is no separation. At any boxing 
gym, amateurs not only spar with pros, they are trained and advised by men who 
also train and manage pros. 
</P>
<P>
The USA Amateur Boxing Federation is wasting an opportunity to show off its 
best talent, to raise some significant revenue and to garner support for the 
1992 Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
Even after splitting the difference between the high and low estimates of the 
pay-per-view television revenue from the Evander Holyfield-Buster Douglas 
heavyweight title fight, it is still the highest-grossing boxing event ever. 
</P>
<P>
Low side: Tom Adams, pay-per-view analyst for Paul Kagan and Associates, a 
Carmel-based cable TV newsletter, said his firm is estimating the fight was 
purchased by 6.8% of 13.2 million cable households. That's 897,600 homes. Based 
on an average price of $40, it comes to $35,904,000. 
</P>
<P>
High side: Rick Kulis, who marketed Holyfield-Douglas sales for Mirage 
President Steve Wynn, is estimating at least a 7.8% rate out of 14.8 million 
homes, or 1,154,400 households paying a total of $46,176,000. 
</P>
<P>
Roughly half of the gross TV receipts go to Wynn, who says he invested $39 
million. It is believed that the previous pay-per-view record for boxing was a 
gross of $30 million, by both the 1987 Sugar Ray Leonard-Marvin Hagler bout and 
the 1988 Mike Tyson-Michael Spinks fight. 
</P>
<P>
Will the general unhappiness over Douglas' effort hurt future shows, such as 
April's Holyfield-George Foreman bout? 
</P>
<P>
"None at all," Kulis said. "Remember, Leonard-(Roberto) Duran III was a 
stinker, too, and it didn't hurt Holyfield-Douglas. Besides, George Foreman is 
hugely popular, he's articulate and he's a great promoter." 
</P>
<P>
Kulis also said the theme to Holyfield-Foreman is a proven winner. "It's the 
'Can the old man do it?' theme, just like (Larry) Holmes-(Muhammad) Ali," he 
said. "Holmes-Ali grossed $12 million in 1980, a huge number then." 
</P>
<P>
Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Buster Douglas received $19,075,000 for 7 1/2 minutes of work. In his entire 
career, Rocky Marciano earned $4,138,289. His largest single purse: $948,117, 
for his final fight, against Archie Moore Sept. 21, 1955. . . . The Forum 
boxing staff is getting static from the Los Angeles office of the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service over work visas for foreign boxers. As late as 
Friday afternoon, Argentine lightweight Fabian Tejeda (22-0) still hadn't been 
cleared by the INS for his 10-round Forum bout Monday night. The INS was also 
asking that the Forum provide documentation that WBC light-flyweight champion 
Humberto Gonzalez of Mexico City really is a champion. 
</P>
<P>
An invitational amateur boxing tournament is scheduled for Lincoln Park 
Gymnasium in Los Angeles Nov. 26-Dec. 1. . . . Don King has signed Julio Cesar 
Chavez for a 10-round, non-title rematch against Meldrick Taylor at 145 pounds 
for January or February. Then, win or lose, Chavez will meet Hector Camacho in 
May or June with Chavez's two junior-welterweight titles at stake. . . . The 
USA Amateur Boxing Federation is starting a masters division, for boxers 38 and 
over. 
</P>
<P>
Kelcie Banks, America's most decorated amateur boxer as recently as 1988, will 
fight his first pro main event Thursday in Las Vegas, against Felix Gonzalez. 
The Bally's show also has a good undercard: Heavyweights Loren Ross and Tommy 
Morrison in separate bouts, Olympic featherweight champion Kennedy McKinney and 
Canadian Olympic flyweight Scott Olson. . . . Bob Arum's Top Rank pro group 
recently signed top-rated amateur welterweight Skipper Kelp of Colorado 
Springs, a two-time national Golden Gloves champion.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY ELEVATOR OPERATOR CRUSHED TO DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An elevator operator was crushed to death Friday at the Hall of Justice jail in 
downtown Los Angeles when she was caught between a descending car and a 
building floor. 
</P>
<P>
Doris T. Sims, 64, of Los Angeles, suffered head injuries and was pronounced 
dead at the scene on the 10th floor of the county building where she worked a 
manually operated freight elevator for eight years, Los Angeles County 
sheriff's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Sims would have turned 65 in January, sheriff's officials said. She told 
colleagues on Monday that she had picked up an application for retirement. 
</P>
<P>
County employees in the building were shaken by the accident that took the life 
of the feisty but endearing Sims. 
</P>
<P>
"One day we were riding in the elevator and she asked if I had pictures of my 
kids," Sheriff's Deputy Nick Cannis said as he filled in for a bereaved 
elevator operator who left her shift early. 
</P>
<P>
"She told me: 'I got a photo album going of all the deputies' kids. One day I 
can look back at those children and see the faces of all the deputies I ever 
worked with.' Yeah, Miss Sims was real close with a lot of the people here. She 
considered us all a part of her family." 
</P>
<P>
Several operators said Sims had talked with them about minor problems she had 
with the cantankerous elevator system. Administrators in the vintage 1924 
building told operators that an investigation into the accident was under way. 
</P>
<P>
"This was where she and I had our gab sessions," said a 30-year veteran 
operator, John J. Countee, 64, as he opened his elevator door on a deserted 
first floor. 
</P>
<P>
"She was rich with humor, you might say. That's why I always looked for Miss 
Sims here in the mornings." JOHN H. LEE

SELLARS ACCEPTS NEW JOB AT L.A. PHILHARMONIC; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: AS CREATIVE CONSULTANT, HE WILL DEVISE SPECIAL EVENTS, FESTIVALS AND 
COMMUNITY PROJECTS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In what he describes as "an open-ended agreement," Peter Sellars has been named 
creative consultant to the Los Angeles Philharmonic. He will help devise 
special events, festivals and community-oriented projects, according to an 
official announcement made Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Sellars, director of the 1990 Los Angeles Festival and an internationally 
recognized stage director, describes his new job as "an experimental position. 
And right now, we are not quantifying it. But it seems that, with this, all my 
L.A. projects are now coming into alignment." 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he will juggle his numerous other commitments around the world, 
Sellars said that Los Angeles is now his place of residence: "I really live 
here. I have no other home." 
</P>
<P>
He said that he sees his affiliation with Boston Opera Theater as "just a 
friend of the family. They do some of my operas. I'm not officially connected." 
</P>
<P>
Ernest Fleischmann, executive vice president and managing director of the 
Philharmonic Assn., confirmed that Sellars' consultant role is still being 
defined but that "we need the kind of fresh thinking that a man of Sellars' 
vital imagination . . . can bring to us." 
</P>
<P>
He declined to give financial details of the appointment, but said that "Peter 
has promised to give us two days a month in person and to be available by 
telephone wherever he is in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Sellars, 33, has already been announced as stage director of the 1992 Salzburg 
Festival production of Olivier Messiaen's opera, "St. Francois d'Assise," for 
which the L.A. Philharmonic will be the resident orchestra. He is also 
collaborating again with composer John Adams on another opera, "The Death of 
Klinghoffer," plus free-lancing on other projects internationally. 
</P>
<P>
Sellars and Philharmonic music director designate Esa-Pekka Salonen told The 
Times on Friday that the new production of the Messiaen opera would probably 
travel to Los Angeles. Salonen said that would happen in late 1992 or early 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the genesis of the relationship between Sellars and the orchestra, 
Fleischmann said: "When I saw the chemistry between (Sellars and Salonen), I 
saw we had the makings of something special. 
</P>
<P>
"And, frankly, I think it is important for all of us to keep Peter here as much 
as possible. Between these two men, Salonen and Sellars, we are keeping our 
sights on the next century. And, in a way, our bringing them together is a kind 
of insurance for the future of the orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
As for Sellars' specific projects and priorities, all three principals were 
vague. 
</P>
<P>
Said Fleischmann: "The four of us -- including Ara Guzelimian, artistic 
administrator of the Philharmonic -- haven't even sat down together yet. But 
what Peter did for the L.A. Festival, we can all learn from. This was the first 
time people in L.A. were made aware of what it means to have here the 
incredible range of little-known cultures." 
</P>
<P>
Said Salonen: "This is one way to give the Philharmonic a higher profile in the 
ethnic communities. One idea we have already talked about is to create small 
residencies by ensembles from the orchestra in different parts of the city. We 
are always looking for new means of reaching more of our possible audience, the 
people who traditionally have not come to our concerts. We always must think of 
how to ensure a basic continuity, to fulfill this missionary zeal we feel 
toward our audience." 
</P>
<P>
Already the Philharmonic leadership is reflecting steps taken in that 
direction. Two members of the board of directors are minorities: James M. 
Rosser, president of Cal State L.A.; and Hansonia L. Caldwell, dean of 
humanities and fine arts and a music professor at Cal State Dominquez Hills. 
Rosser was added to the board in 1986; Caldwell in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Sellars has completed two projects with the Philharmonic. In March, he put 
together a chamber-music program played by Philharmonic members at the Museum 
of Contemporary Art, and in September he arranged and staged an L.A. Festival 
program at Hollywood Bowl in which the orchestra appeared. 
</P>
<P>
Sellars, whose next Los Angeles Festival is scheduled for 1993, concluded: 
"This is a very exciting time. L.A. is ripe for this, the Philharmonic is game. 
And we are all on the edge of something special here."

A LITTLE HEALTHY FRICTION?; 
</P>
<P>
MEETING FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS SEASON, THE PROGRESSIVE MUSIC-DIRECTOR-TO-BE 
AND HIS CONSERVATIVE AUDIENCE CHALLENGED EACH OTHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Esa-Pekka Salonen, we are assured, holds the future of our Philharmonic in his 
flamboyant hands. Thursday night at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, he taught 
Los Angeles a few more things about his musical persona. 
</P>
<P>
For his first concert of the season, he juxtaposed a pair of French 
masterpieces from the turn of the century with two works from his native 
Finland, one old and one very new. 
</P>
<P>
The Music Center audience, in turn, taught the youthful music-director-to-be a 
few things of its own about local artistic perspectives. Significantly, 
perhaps, the house was less than full. 
</P>
<P>
The on-going relationship between the adventurous maestro and our essentially 
conservative public will be interesting to observe. Perhaps we should brace 
ourselves for a little healthy friction. 
</P>
<P>
It is clear that Salonen is not going to settle for lazy solutions to 
contemporary problems. Our potential sonic savior is a man of his time, 
unburdened with a lot of historical baggage. His dedication to musical 
exploration far exceeds anything we have experienced with his predecessors on 
the Philharmonic podium. 
</P>
<P>
This music director won't lull the subscribers with a steady stream of pretty, 
familiar tunes. He doesn't particularly want to send the masses home humming. 
He does, however, want to send them home thinking. 
</P>
<P>
It won't be easy. Still, if anyone can plead the case for modernism 
persuasively in this town, Salonen may be the man. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles loves a hero, especially if he looks the part and speaks with a 
slight accent. Salonen is handsome, boyish, slim, blond, energetic, capable of 
picturesque passion and exotically foreign. He might have been sent to us by 
Central Casting. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, he also happens to be immensely talented. Given time and proper 
conditioning, he might just persuade Los Angeles to embrace his progressive 
aesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
A push-button ovation greeted his entrance. It soon became clear, however, that 
many in the crowd of well-wishers were more eager to clap than to listen. 
</P>
<P>
Before the final pianissimo cadences of Sibelius' "En Saga" could even begin to 
evaporate, the mood was shattered by insensitive applause. Salonen looked 
startled. He didn't look pleased. 
</P>
<P>
One expected the worst at the end of "Du Cristal," the seemingly chaotic new 
piece by Salonen's compatriot Kaija Saariaho that opened the second half of the 
program. Philharmonic regulars have been known in the past to make rude 
remarks, walk out, even boo when confronted with anything so unhummable. 
</P>
<P>
Not this time. The first-nighters listened stoically and applauded politely. 
They registered neither enthusiasm -- which would have been surprising -- nor 
disapproval -- which might have been candid. They followed their potential 
leader, took their medicine, and looked forward to washing away any dissonant 
memories in the waves of Debussy's "La Mer," which was to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Comprehension of the relatively forbidding idiom might have been enhanced, 
incidentally, with penetrable annotation. In lieu of a good program note, 
however, the management reprinted a chatty, quizzical, quasi-analytical letter 
to the composer, written by a Finnish colleague. It only served the cause of 
obfuscation. Salonen may want to pay some special attention to this aspect of 
his missionary work when he takes up residence here in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Saariaho's score, commissioned by the Philharmonic in association with the 
Helsinki Festival, makes a mighty, multitextured noise. It raves and rumbles 
with aggressive force, yet compels attention by constantly shifting rhythmic 
gears and frequently altering textural focus. 
</P>
<P>
Just when the music seems most unyielding in its density and toughness, it 
reveals an unexpected, even delicate melodic fragment or adds a new splash of 
color. Saariaho's complex structural devices demand intense concentration. 
Clarification of her intentions will, no doubt, come with repeated exposure. 
When Salonen settles in, it might be useful if he gave us a lot of routine 
second performances along with the wonted glamorous premieres. 
</P>
<P>
The conventional part of this program on Thursday confirmed his technical 
prowess as well as his temperamental abandon. In "Ma Mere l'Oye," he mothered 
Ravel's goose with ravishing tone and expressive refinement. In Debussy's 
"Mer," long a Philharmonic specialty, he favored storm over calm. In the 
process, he invoked shades of Mehta rather than Giulini, but his brisk and 
broad performance made sense on its own incisive terms. 
</P>
<P>
In Sibelius' somewhat soggy "Saga," he allowed the music to brood and soar with 
poignant theatricality. His abiding conviction made the premature applause 
doubly regrettable. 
</P>
<P>
The Philharmonic played brilliantly for its incipient boss in all cases. 
Already, he seems to bring out the best in the band.

SOUTHWEST CHAMBER MUSIC PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD S. GINELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Southwest Chamber Music Society apparently doesn't want to know about the 
word routine. That was the impression left by its refreshingly eclectic program 
Thursday night in Chapman College's Salmon Recital Hall (and repeated Friday at 
the Pasadena Library). 
</P>
<P>
Unusual instrumental combinations dominated this outing, beginning with Reger's 
delightful Serenade for flute, violin and viola, Opus 141a, a dashing, 
rambunctious, richly harmonized piece that ought to be better known. Flutist 
Dorothy Stone, violinist Peter Marsh and violist Jan Karlin checked in with a 
rough yet lively reading that often tumbled headlong through Reger's difficult 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
Next were two demonstrations of sheer compositional genius with a minimum of 
means in Britten's quirky, humorous, sometimes self-absorbed "Six Metamorphoses 
After Ovid" for solo oboe, and the amazing contrapuntal interplay within 
Mozart's Duo for violin and viola, K. 424. 
</P>
<P>
Oboist Stuart Horn displayed a firm, liquid, legato tone in Britten's 
soliloquy, and he was undaunted by a beeper that went off in the audience in 
mid-piece. In the Mozart, played by Marsh and Karlin, one could almost overlook 
Marsh's frequent lapses in tuning, for the two were carrying on a joyous 
musical dialogue where feeling triumphed over technical shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Britten's inventiveness with solo winds, Alexander Goehr's 
Paraphrase on Monteverdi's "Il Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda" for 
clarinet was a typically loose-jointed, rambling exercise that quickly 
exhausted one's patience. Clarinetist Michael Grego ably coped with its angular 
writing, frequent pauses, and fashionable tapping of the keys. 
</P>
<P>
But Goehr's arid landscape was quickly washed away by Prokofiev's wonderfully 
savage Quintet in G minor, a product of the early 1920s that reminds the 
listener of the acidic Second Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
With its odd instrumental lineup (oboe, clarinet, violin, viola, bass), 
abrasive drones and lurching rhythms, the piece can't help but summon images of 
Stravinsky peering over Prokofiev's shoulder. Here, double bassist Paul Zibits 
joined Marsh, Karlin, Horn and Grego in a zesty performance made all the more 
effective by its rough edges.RICHARD S. GINELL

'HISTORY PROJECT' EXAMINES LOS ANGELES' TENSE PAST;

TELEVISION: SEGMENTS ON THE HOLLYWOOD STRIKES AND AIMEE SEMPLE MCPHERSON HELP

In the 1940s, Hollywood's glamorous movie industry suffered through more than a 
year of violent strikes that laid the foundation for the witch hunts of the 
McCarthy era, and for then-actor Ronald Reagan's conservative ideology and 
political future. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s, Los Angeles' original Chinatown was leveled to make room for 
Union Station, forcing the immigrant residents of that persecuted community to 
move and, without any compensation, start all over again. 
</P>
<P>
You can live your whole life in Los Angeles without any awareness of the city's 
rich and not-always-pretty history. KCET Channel 28's "Los Angeles History 
Project," which begins its third season Sunday at 8 p.m. with a documentary 
about the Hollywood strikes of 1945-46, attempts to remedy that for natives and 
transplants alike. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember I went to the head of a major foundation to ask for funding for the 
project, and he asked, 'Is there anything interesting in the history of Los 
Angeles?' " recalled Stephen Kulczycki, KCET's station manager. "And I hung 
onto that for a long time. This is a city that invented itself out of nothing. 
There is no reason for it to be here. No river, no port. Everything is self 
made, and there are so many fascinating stories about the struggles and 
disappointments and triumphs of the people who created this community." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to "Hollywood Strike," this season's four stories include 
documentaries on the life of famed Los Angeles evangelist Aimee Semple 
McPherson; the city's two Chinatowns as seen through the eyes of three men who 
helped build them; and the turn-of-the-century battle over where to build Los 
Angeles Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to pick stories that cover a span of time," said Arthur Barron, the 
series producer for the last two years. "In the current series, you have an old 
story in 'Harbor Wars' and a fairly modern story in 'Strike.' We try to show 
history not so much as seen from the outside, but how history has been 
experienced by ordinary people. We try to see if there is a way of 
personalizing these stories, of making them interesting and human, rather than 
dry textbook facts and dates." 
</P>
<P>
Barron said that he looks for stories, such as the strikes and the battle over 
the harbor, that are not well known. When the topic is familiar, such as 
"Sister Aimee," he tries to tackle it in a new way. 
</P>
<P>
"Most treatments of her had focused on the sexual scandal," Barron said. "We 
tried to show what her genuine contribution was to Los Angeles, her 
compassionate side, a woman who gave lonely immigrants to the city a sense of 
identity, a balm for their alienation." 
</P>
<P>
The series also attempts to reflect the city's ethnic diversity. Last season 
offered documentaries on the black and Latino experiences in Los Angeles. This 
season examines the rough and difficult road traveled by the city's Chinese 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the series' most compelling trait is that its stories are told through 
the use of rarely seen archival photographs, films and newsreels that bring the 
period to life. "Sister Aimee" includes 1920s home movies of the evangelist 
preaching to thousands in her magnificent Angelus Temple. The Chinatown program 
shows an old newsreel in which the narrator, over images of Chinese 
schoolchildren undergoing medical checkups, reveals the rampant bigotry the 
Chinese faced by casually referring to the children as "the future crop of 
laundrymen." 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywood Strike" features old footage of the strike and its violence. It also 
juxtaposes a vintage Disney cartoon that depicts a strike orchestrated by a 
bunch of overworked chickens with Walt Disney's own efforts to break the 
cartoonists' union. 
</P>
<P>
"We dig around with a pickax to find things," said Barron, who sends his staff 
searching through the National Archives in Washington, D.C., public and private 
libraries and the personal memorabilia of cooperative private citizens. "The 
glory of this series is that we turn up so much that has never been seen." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's show strips the glitter off the movie industry, portraying the gritty 
reality of the struggle for power between the blue-collar craft workers and the 
moguls who ran the studios. It illustrates how organized crime infiltrated the 
union and worked in conjunction with the studios to keep pay scales low. It 
shows how "Commie-bashing" became a common tool in squashing rival unions and 
labor sympathizers, and it focuses on Reagan's transformation from a "New Deal 
Democrat" into an FBI informant and staunch conservative. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the important things to be learned from this, I think, is that there is 
really nothing about the glamour and tinsel of Hollywood that makes the 
churning out of pictures any different than the churning out of refrigerators 
or anything else," Barron said. 
</P>
<P>
Such lessons, however, do not come cheap. Kulczycki said that producing the 
four documentaries that will air over the next four Sundays cost close to $1 
million, much of that covered by donations from various foundations and the Los 
Angeles Cultural Affairs Department. But, Kulczycki said, a good deal of the 
cost must be absorbed against KCET's own operating budget. At present, the 
station does not have the money to continue the series. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying it's over," Kulczycki said. "We will continue to try to find 
ways to do it, even if that means making them one at a time" -- on an 
occasional basis. 
</P>
<P>
Barron, who is currently producing a "reality-based" series set in New York's 
Bellevue Hospital for ABC, said that it would be a shame if the series died 
now. In such a sprawling community embracing so many styles, ethnic groups and 
cultural enclaves, learning of their city's past, he believes, can be a 
unifying experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the series helps the audience to have a sense of connectedness to 
their past," Barron said. "It serves as an antidote to an age of anxiety and 
rootlessness by revealing and remembering the values that once sustained us. It 
helps us to discover the other cultures, our neighbors, and that we all do 
share a common heritage. That's something to be proud of."

EVERYTHING'S COMING UP ROSES FOR OTT

The encaustic rose paintings of Sabina Ott exude a heavy, melancholic air. 
Their thick, waxy surfaces equate easily to time and seem to embalm each 
painting in dark musings about presence, absence or life and death. Ott's roses 
are the stuff of memories and old Victorian cards, swollen and fully open. One 
rose is much like another, a fact Ott uses masterfully in "Disappearance and 
Return No. 19," where she weaves a claustrophobic white web of pattern across 
the huge painting's surface. Part bridal gown, part flocked wall paper, the 
massed roses vie for breathing room seeming to drown and surface repeatedly 
amid milky flotsam. In other paintings the flower's obliteration is more 
heavy-handed as the artist washes over portions of imagery with runny veils of 
colored encaustic. In a corner of a four-panel painting a single small red rose 
evokes a vivid sense of violence. The impact is chilling. 
</P>
<P>
Creighton Michael's driftwood wall sculptures read like Modernist tribal art. 
The elegance of his simplified forms recall Louise Bourgeois' sculptures of the 
late '40s but Michael's abstraction is more animalistic than figurative. Pieces 
suggest fetishistic shields, or abstract animal totems which are delightfully 
spry yet surprisingly earnest in their dignity. Perhaps it is the cocky 
spontaneity of sanded limbs covered with penciled lines gesturing broadly in 
refined courtship rituals that lifts this art out of the reverential doldrums 
that affects most fetishistic work. The nobility is there but thankfully it's 
got a sense of humor.

Perfectly Crafted Plywood: Erik Levine's three huge plywood forms are tidy 
pieces of self-containment. They look exactly like what they are, pieces of raw 
plywood perfectly crafted into rounded, vaguely mechanical forms of precise 
geometry and resolute functionlessness. Just looking at the unfinished surface 
dotted with staples, divided by pencil lines and liberally dusted with finely 
sanded wood putty, we know they have everything to do with construction. They 
bring out the craftsman in all of us. You want to run your hands over the 
surface because that's how you will really know the perfection of the shape and 
its fine smoothness. 
</P>
<P>
If this is Minimalism's "what you see is all you get" basics, then Levine's 
sculptures have found a constructivist trap door to allow for allusions to 
machines and containers of empty space. These Gargantuan models for orange 
squeezers, tops or drain plugs reek of industrial ramifications but refuse to 
get specific. Instead they bring up formal considerations about sculptural 
weight, interior vs. exterior volumes and implied movement retained by static 
form. Isn't it fun when something that looks that good before it gets 
"finished" can still carry on an intelligent conversation? 
</P>

Occidental Exhibits: Of the four exhibitions going on simultaneously around the 
Occidental College campus, the most noteworthy is Michael McMillen's 
installation "Atlas Worked." Not as much a full-scale environment as earlier 
pieces such as his "The Pavilion of Rain," "Atlas" has more in common with the 
running musings of "Train of Thought" seen earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
United simply by the question "What Shaped Burbank?," the small gallery space 
is broken up by three sculptural "points" and a single painting. Most 
intriguing is a rusted, padlocked locker which has a bubbling fountain flowing 
loudly inside. The sound of liquid splashes coming from the sealed locker 
animate and inform the rest of the room with a hidden presence of life. This is 
in sharp contrast to the entropy projected by the rest of the works: a slowly 
rusting conical mountain of steel junk and a dirt-encrusted old drill press 
(the Atlas trade name of the title). On the wall is a painting titled "A Home 
in America" that focuses on a junk-laden backyard which backs up to a 
construction site where huge grubs are busy moving earth. 
</P>
<P>
Though it's quite spare, there is much to be said for the intelligence of this 
piece and the way McMillen allows the viewer to come to interpretations based 
on changing physical interaction with the sculpture. It's an experiential 
premise that's at the heart of some of the most interesting installation work 
being done today by artists like Ann Hamilton and Connie Zehr. In a sense, the 
art really only finds meaning through the observer. It's an interesting way for 
an object maker like McMillen to get the audience involved in the process of 
making the art. 
</P>
<P>
In the next gallery, two painters take off on their own ideas of water in 
"Waterfall as Image." For such a hackneyed subject, both artists offer some 
nicely arresting abstract landscapes bordering on the figurative. Jean 
Towgood's writhing, Expressionist "Fire Falls" are the raw force of nature with 
an apocalyptic edge. Her energetic mark on naked canvas and inflamed color are 
the exact opposite of Gillian Theobald's icy cold rivers of self-illuminating 
swiftness which flow in bleached white blues against solid black rocks. The 
polarities form a refreshing juxtaposition. 
</P>
<P>
Painter Jesus Perez makes points with his great sense of humor about death and 
pollution in "Dead Issues." Any artist who admits doing research for a Day of 
the Dead show by investigating folk tradition and then going to the butcher 
shop is in touch with an appealing sense of the absurd. While his paintings try 
too hard to be symbolic high art, the drawings are wonderfully inventive and 
playful. They are firmly entrenched in the Mexican idea that death and life 
have everything in common and are a delightful celebration of that unity. This 
is not gallows humor but something more lively. 
</P>
<P>
On view in a different building are the somber, shifting-space interiors of 
painter Linda Kallan and the oddly diminutive sculptures of Pamela Burgess. The 
space is problematic for the work of both artists but Burgess suffers most with 
stone and metal pieces that have great difficulty with their scale.

Shegelman's Transformation: Russian painter Simon Shegelman's images have 
undergone a startling transformation since he left the Soviet Union in 1975. 
The linocut and silk-screen prints he made in Latvia, before his immigration to 
France and America, were dark, powerfully claustrophobic figurative works 
dealing with the emotional pain of regimented oppression. Little wonder that 
officials would close the exhibit for "political and ideological reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Since Shegelman immigrated, his work has exploded in a maelstrom of brightly 
fashionable colors. He is attracted to the flash and dazzle of the nightclubs 
and glittery trappings of "the good life." His paintings are a strange 
combination of Chagall and kitschy Leroy Nieman illustration montage. It's 
distressing to think that Shegelman could sound the depths of one political 
reality so clearly in his early silk-screens yet be so completely bedazzled by 
the materialism of another. But perhaps both systems are extremes and that's 
the simplification the artist is communicating.

KID BEAT: 'CIRQUE DU L.A.' CELEBRATES IMAGINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Unlike that famous visiting Cirque from Canada, "Cirque du L.A.: Working 
Without Annette," at the Odyssey Theatre Ensemble, has no big top, no spangled 
acrobats nor spectacular high-wire tricks. 
</P>
<P>
It does have French tightrope walkers, a talking chimpanzee, a husband-and-wife 
daredevil act and a magician named Fred. 
</P>
<P>
Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
On an almost bare stage, enlivened with humor and warmth, this zesty new show 
for ages 5 to 12 is an imagination celebration. 
</P>
<P>
After pre-show theater games out in the lobby -- there is lots of voluntary 
audience participation -- the Glorious Players, an adult cast of professionals, 
skillfully directed by actress-educator Debbie Devine, offers the story of 
12-year-old Molly (Cheryl Crabtree) who can't read and is afraid to try. 
</P>
<P>
To escape from her troubles, Molly runs away to join a circus. But the circus 
performers have their own problems -- they're not attracting audiences because 
they refuse to learn new tricks. 
</P>
<P>
When Molly helps the troupe overcome its fear of change, she loses her own fear 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
The message is buoyed up by well-timed nonsense from the polished cast who, 
except for Crabtree, play multiple roles. Jay Kyle McAdams is a hoot as Molly's 
mom and dad, her mischievous little brother, a Teutonic daredevil and 
cigar-smoking chimpanzee trainer. The rest of the ensemble -- Crabtree, Andy 
Papp, Jill Cervant, Jinni and Erick Melton -- score high marks for humor as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Chew's original music is a big plus, particularly when she gives "voice" 
to the giraffe and the zebra. The puppets, designed by Victoria Carpenter and 
Martha Crawford, are a visual treat and seen too briefly. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2055 S. Sepulveda Blvd., West Los Angeles, for an indefinite run, 
Saturdays, 1 p.m. Tickets, $6.50; (213) 477-2055.

EXPERIMENTAL MINISTRY: THE CHURCH IN OCEAN PARK FOCUSES ON ARTISTIC FREEDOM AND 
LIBERAL CAUSES. IT PLANS A CONCERT SOON CALLED 'NAKED IN THE CHURCH.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Church in Ocean Park, a United Methodist congregation that ministers to the 
young and unconventional, began planning a concert last summer "designed to 
affront the sensitivities of the prudish." 
</P>
<P>
The Nov. 17 concert, called "Naked in the Church," will feature performance 
artists who will do separate pieces about the "body" and "pornography," music 
by The Underthings, described as a provocative rock group, and a film short, 
"Elektra," by two "feminist underground filmmakers." 
</P>
<P>
"There is not anything done without taste," said the Rev. James Conn, pastor of 
the Santa Monica church. 
</P>
<P>
The show's original purpose was to protest threatened curbs on the National 
Endowment for the Arts. Although that issue has cooled, Conn still feels the 
concert will make a worthy statement about artistic freedom. 
</P>
<P>
While most churches might be more likely to protest rather than sponsor such a 
concert, the avant-garde Church in Ocean Park has long been unique among 
Christian churches in Southern California. It helps that Conn aims his ministry 
at the artistic, socially liberal community in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Despite having only 100 active members, the congregation had more members than 
any other church taking part in last winter's sit-in demonstrations at the 
Federal Building in Los Angeles over U.S. aid to El Salvador. Conn was arrested 
six times and about 20 members were arrested at least once for blocking 
entrances. 
</P>
<P>
The church has long supported civil rights for homosexuals and their 
participation in the congregation. Conn has performed "celebrations" of 
same-sex unions but has escaped Methodist censure because they are not 
technically weddings. Next Saturday night the church will hold it first annual 
Lesbian and Gay Square Dance. "You can dress like Roy or Dale or just like your 
cute self, honey!" advises the church newsletter, which has a mailing list of 
1,000. 
</P>
<P>
The church also sponsors an erotic-literature reading group. "There aren't many 
churches that would entertain that notion," Conn commented wryly. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, United Methodist Bishop Jack M. Tuell of Los Angeles said he is 
"grateful" for what the church tries to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
"Not everybody approves of the ministry there, but I've never had pressure to 
step in and stop anything," Tuell said. "I welcome efforts like this to reach 
groups of people we don't always reach," the bishop said. The church expresses 
itself differently than other churches, but "it basically seeks to be a United 
Methodist church," Tuell said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the congregation does some typical churchy things, including providing 
space for groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous and holding a pre-Christmas gift 
fair. 
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old pastor, casually dressed, sits on a stool to give his Sunday 
sermons, and the ensuing discussion is sometimes just as lengthy. The music is 
a cappella, led by Elinor Graham, who has members learn traditional American 
music or other songs without aid of books or printed lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
Conn said he talks at the morning service with more illustrations from 
contemporary culture than from the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more like a Unitarian church in many ways," said member Ida Bucher of 
Westwood. "There is not a lot of stress on God. But it's Christian if you think 
of Christian as caring for others." 
</P>
<P>
The church feeds the homeless each Sunday at the Ocean Park Community Center, 
which operates in an adjacent, church-owned building. Bucher became acquainted 
with the church because of its day-care center for children in foster care 
whose parents were drugs addicts or otherwise troubled. 
</P>
<P>
Church in Ocean Park was 50 years old and fading in membership when Conn was 
appointed pastor in 1973 and given the mission of making it an experimental 
church with a politically and socially liberal perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a lengthy 'experiment,' " he conceded. "One might call it an 
alternative church at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Conn said he enjoys the challenges and intellectual ferment at the church. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fair to say this church has attracted people who are not surprised by the 
offbeat and incongruous," Conn said. "In fact, they sort of expect and look 
forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
He conceded that the upcoming "Naked in the Church" concert has lost some of 
the provocative sting it had last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Congress has since voted to scrap tough restrictions on the kinds of art 
eligible for federal subsidies. Not only that, the government agency has 
quietly dropped a controversial requirement that grant recipients must sign a 
non-obscenity pledge. 
</P>
<P>
Conn is happy about the developments in Washington, but he nevertheless said 
the show is "an affirmation that needs to be made about the freedom of artistic 
expression." It is also the last of three fund-raising events this year at the 
congregation. 
</P>
<P>
Cheri Gaulke, one of the performance artists, is expected to present a work 
similar to one she gave at the church several years ago. It included a scene in 
which she portrayed Eve, covered only with a fig leaf, being crucified on a 
cross. 
</P>
<P>
Anybody who "thinks there is some dichotomy between the flesh and the soul, 
between God and sex, would be in deep trouble going to this show," Conn said. 
</P>
<P>
A concern with public issues once led Conn to politics. He served eight years 
on the Santa Monica City Council, the final two as mayor. He did not seek 
reelection in 1988, he said, because he "decided there was more to life than 
going to meetings every Tuesday night and answering constituents' complaints." 
As a pastor and a politician he was working about 80 hours a week, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Conn said his church duties include the kinds of things pastors typically do. 
"My task is to stand with people as they go through passages of their lives . . 
. weddings, funerals, communion. It's just that my style is different." 
</P>
<P>
Members say the musical contributions of Graham are just as important as Conn's 
messages during the Sunday service. 
</P>
<P>
"Elinor is magic," said Susan McCorry of Santa Monica. "She and Jim work so in 
sync. We sing folk songs, hymns, protest songs, you name it." 
</P>
<P>
An ex-Catholic and a single mother, McCorry said she enjoys the church's annual 
trip to Catalina Island, the potluck dinners and acceptance by others. But she 
took the newsletter for a dozen years before, in the midst of personal crisis, 
she was drawn to a scheduled sermon on why people believe in God. 
</P>
<P>
"We do a lot of serious things -- and fun things," she said. 
</P>
<P>
After church one Sunday last spring, she said, the pastor and churchgoers 
pushed the chairs aside, got down on the floor to make kites and went to the 
beach to fly them.

U.S. SCHOOLS WILL BE OFFERED RELIGIOUS LIBERTY CURRICULUM

The nation's schools will be offered a new curriculum on religious liberty that 
aims to circumvent a minefield of controversies by focusing on the historical 
role of religion in society, project officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"A constructive handling of religious liberty is essential to good teaching 
about religion, democratic first principles and American common core values," 
said Charles Haynes, president of the National Council on Religion and Public 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
The curriculum, evaluated and refined by a host of top educators, integrates 
what Haynes describes as "the new three Rs" -- rights, responsibilities and 
respect into social studies lessons tailored for upper elementary, junior high, 
and high school students. 
</P>
<P>
The goals of the curriculum, entitled "Living with Our Deepest Differences: 
Religious Liberty in a Pluralistic Society," are to explain the history and 
significance of the First Amendment religious liberty clause and examine the 
advantages and responsibilities of living in a modern society with numerous 
races and religions. 
</P>
<P>
"This curriculum represents a major stride forward for the school reform 
movement in this country," said Ernest Boyer, president of the Carnegie 
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and former U.S. commissioner of 
education. 
</P>
<P>
"Students simply cannot know the history of art, for example, without

Hundreds of Southland Hindus are expected to assemble in a first-ever "Unity 
Day" celebration today at Cerritos College in Norwalk. The evening program 
culminates lengthy planning to bring together disparate religious, cultural and 
secular Hindu groups for an annual celebration. 
</P>
<P>
The event has no relationship to the recent escalation of Hindu-Muslim conflict 
in India, said a spokesman, engineer Shiva Subramanya of Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
"None of us hold hatred toward Muslims or anyone else, and we are against all 
violence," Subramanya said. 
</P>
<P>
He said it was only "coincidental" that today's event comes on the heels of the 
recent violent storming of a mosque site in Ayodhya, India, by thousands of 
militant Hindu pilgrims. 
</P>
<P>
Hinduism, which is practiced by many sects and schools of thought, has no 
central organization. But when a famous Indian monk, Murari Bapu, visited Los 
Angeles last year, more than a dozen Hindu organizations cooperated in 
sponsoring and organizing his appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Subramanya said that many people asked, "Why don't we do this every year?" He 
said that the 40 or so groups sponsoring today's celebration include, the 
Indian Dental Society, the Ananda Foundation, Art India and the International 
Society of Divine Love. 
</P>
<P>
Although Swami Swahananda of the Vedanta Center will speak on Hinduism in the 
21st Century and the program includes Vedic chanting, the event is not entirely 
a religious affair. Cultural dances and other entertainment are planned for the 
celebration, which begins at 4:15 p.m. and ends at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Open to the public without charge, the event will take place in the Burnight 
Theatre on the Cerritos College campus.

A rabbi and a priest who have spearheaded interfaith relations in the Los 
Angeles area for two decades will receive the North American "Interfaith 
Leadership Award" at the 12th National Workshop on Christian-Jewish Relations 
Tuesday night in Chicago. The award will go to Rabbi Alfred Wolf, director of 
the American Jewish Committee's Skirball Institute on American Values, and 
Msgr. Royale M. Vadakin, the Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese's director for 
ecumenical and interreligious affairs. The two were founders of the multifaith 
Interreligious Council of Southern California and were instrumental in a series 
of Catholic-Jewish study dialogues and education exchanges.

PARADE 
</P>
<P>
The Tournament of Roses Parade will have a second religious entry on Jan. 1, 
1991 -- the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod's 
laymen's league has entered floats for many years, but this is the first time 
for the Adventists. Seen as a public relations device for national television 
exposure (however brief), the float will show "children of the world at play in 
a garden."

<P>
The 42nd annual Ministers' Convocation, to be held Monday and Tuesday at the 
School of Theology at Claremont, will be addressed by David Buttrick of 
Vanderbilt University Divinity School, Margaret R. Miles of Harvard Divinity 
School and M. Thomas Thangaraj at Emory University's Candler School of 
Theology. Registration, costing $18 and open to all clergy, begins at 9 a.m. 
Monday at the seminary's Mudd Auditorium. A clergy and lay workshop on local 
church revitalization -- added to the program at popular request -- will be 
held on the campus Wednesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Choirs from two "mega-churches" in Southern California will present Johannes 
Brahms' "The Requiem" at 6 p.m. Sunday at one of the churches, the Lake Avenue 
Congregational Church in Pasadena. The Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove will 
contribute to the 300-voice combined choir and Frederick Swann, who is organist 
for the Crystal Cathedral, will accompany the choir on the 125-rank organ at 
the Congregational Church. Both congregations rank among the top 25 
best-attended Protestant churches in California. JOHN DART

AMERICAN PRELATE RETIRES FROM VATICAN SERVICE; 
</P>
<P>
PAPACY: ARCHBISHOP MARCINKUS WILL SERVE AS PARISH PRIEST IN CHICAGO. FORMER 
BODYGUARD TO POPE, HE WAS PRESIDENT OF BANK ROCKED BY SCANDAL.

VATICAN CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After four decades abroad, Archbishop Paul C. Marcinkus, the best known -- and 
most controversial -- American prelate at the Vatican, has retired from papal 
service to return to his native Chicago as a parish priest. 
</P>
<P>
Built like a linebacker, his street Chicago accent and idiom unblunted by 40 
years of Vatican propriety, Marcinkus first drew international attention as the 
Pope's chief bodyguard and later as the hapless president of a Vatican bank 
rocked by monumental financial scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Marcinkus, the 6-foot, 4-inch son of a Lithuanian window cleaner in Cicero, 
Ill., said in a brief statement Tuesday that he would return to the United 
States "to make myself useful in whatever pastoral work I may be able to do, 
much like many priests of my diocese are doing." 
</P>
<P>
Pope John Paul II accepted the 68-year-old Marcinkus' resignation as deputy 
governor of Vatican City at his request, the Vatican announced Tuesday, and 
named him to an honorary post as a consultant to the city-state. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Chicago Cardinal Joseph Bernardin praised Marcinkus' "great 
dedication to the church and his personal integrity," saying "the door to his 
home diocese will always be open to him." 
</P>
<P>
Marcinkus, an avid sports fan who reminisced with gusto one recent night about 
his adventures trying to teach Italian boys to play baseball, retained his 
Vatican City post after resigning in March, 1989, as president of the Vatican 
bank, called the Institute for Religious Works, after 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
His presidency was marred by Italy's largest postwar banking scandal, which 
cost the Vatican $250 million in a 1984 goodwill settlement to creditors of the 
failed Banco Ambrosiano. The bank, which collapsed in 1982 with the 
still-unresolved disappearance of $1.3 billion, was Italy's largest private 
bank. The Vatican was a major shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
Two Italian bankers with whom Marcinkus dealt, Roberto Calvi and Michele 
Sindona, were convicted of fraud after their banks collapsed. Both died 
mysteriously -- Sindona in jail and Calvi hanging from Blackfriars Bridge in 
downtown London in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Marcinkus has always staunchly denied any wrongdoing, and the Vatican has 
supported him, insisting while making the $250-million settlement that it bore 
no moral or legal blame for the Ambrosiano collapse. 
</P>
<P>
On foreign trips of Pope Paul VI and John Paul II, Marcinkus often ran 
broad-shouldered interference as unofficial chief bodyguard. In 1987, Italian 
prosecutors issued warrants for Marcinkus and two lay officials at the Vatican 
bank, accusing them of being accessories of Banco Ambrosiano's fraudulent 
bankruptcy. An Italian court ruled that Italian officials had no jurisdiction 
over the papal enclave, which is surrounded by Rome but recognized as a 
sovereign city-state. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly a year, Marcinkus made no secret that he was lobbying for 
retirement. As its acceptance was announced Tuesday, he told an Associated 
Press reporter: "I don't want to have sour grapes. I want to leave here on a 
happy note."

IS ROSE COMING OFF HALL OF FAME BALLOT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER SCHMUCK, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The incarceration of Pete Rose brought baseball moralists out of the woodwork 
by the thousands and kicked off a lively debate. 
</P>
<P>
The question at the time was this: 
</P>
<P>
Should a convicted felon be allowed entrance into the Hall of Fame? 
</P>
<P>
It was a legitimate question with legitimate arguments on both sides, but the 
answer didn't figure to arrive until Rose's name was placed on the ballot in 
1992 and the approximately 450 voting members of the Baseball Writers 
Association of America had their say. 
</P>
<P>
Now, there is speculation that an answer will come much sooner than that, when 
a committee of nine meets in December or January to review the Hall of Fame 
selection process. 
</P>
<P>
Hall of Fame Director Edward Stack has convened the committee to examine 
selection procedures and review the Rules for Election. That, in itself, is not 
unusual, but the curious timing of the review has at least two committee 
members wondering whether Rose's Hall of Fame eligibility is going to get lost 
in a hidden agenda. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly, this happens a year before a guy who could be a sticky issue is a 
candidate," Baseball Writers' Executive Secretary Jack Lang said. "It has every 
indication of being an attempt to keep Pete Rose off the ballot." 
</P>
<P>
The review has been scheduled ostensibly because of inconsistencies in the 
selection process. Hall of Fame candidates are chosen by a screening committee, 
then must be named on 75 percent of the ballots cast to get into Cooperstown. 
Players passed over in the Baseball Writers' voting eventually can be elected 
by the Hall of Fame Veterans Committee, which includes longtime baseball 
executives, baseball writers and former players. 
</P>
<P>
Though no specific rules changes have been discussed, there has been talk about 
altering the eligibility requirements to prevent the induction of players who 
have been banned from baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"That's been a suggestion made by some of the baseball writers," Hall of Fame 
Associate Director Bill Guilfoile said. "Whether that will come up for 
discussion, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
But Lang said that he has heard no such sentiment from any member of the 
Baseball Writers Association of America, and fellow committee member Frank 
Dolson of the Philadelphia Inquirer said recently that he feared the rules 
review was just an excuse to try to get Rose off the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it's a sham," Dolson told the Cincinnati Enquirer, "but I 
suspect that it is." 
</P>
<P>
The board of directors of the Hall of Fame has the power to alter the rules at 
its discretion, but Lang and Dolson say that the Baseball Writers' traditional 
role in the selection process should not be circumvented by rules that would 
keep specific players off the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
It would seem more logical to allow a committee of 450 to elect a player by a 
75 percent vote than to allow a committee of nine to reject him by a simple 
majority, but it could happen. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the thing should be left up to the writers," Lang said. "We'll be the 
heroes or villains if Rose gets in or doesn't get in. It has always been the 
writers who decide, and they (the Hall's board of directors) have never 
questioned anybody the BBWAA has selected." 
</P>
<P>
There are some loopholes in the selection process that the association would 
like to see reviewed, however. 
</P>
<P>
"The Veterans Committee has admitted players who were soundly rejected by the 
BBWAA voting body," Lang said, "so the BBWAA would like to see tougher 
eligibility requirements for candidates who have been passed over in the 
balloting. 
</P>
<P>
"The Veterans Committee selected Rick Ferrell, although he got only five votes 
in all the years he was on the ballot," Lang said. "We think they should have 
to come reasonably close to the 75 percent requirement. I've been asked to 
propose that nobody be considered by the Veterans Committee who did not get at 
least 662-3 percent of the vote in any one year." 
</P>
<P>
That proposal doesn't figure to be embraced by the Veterans Committee, but it 
does show that the association is committed to keeping the Hall of Fame a very 
exclusive place. 
</P>
<P>
The Philadelphia Phillies did Mickey Tettleton a big favor when they signed 
catcher Darren Daulton to a three-year contract worth $6.75 million, but that 
doesn't figure to change the chemistry of Tettleton's negotiations with the 
Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles can feign outrage if they want to, but Daulton turned down a 
three-year, $6.6 million offer during the regular season. This contract was no 
great surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it helps us as far as the Baltimore Orioles are concerned, but 
it certainly helps us as far as Mickey Tettleton is concerned," agent Tony 
Attanasio said. "It simply reaffirms for us that there is a market out there 
for catchers in Mickey's class." 
</P>
<P>
Tettleton's offensive numbers are comparable to Daulton's (his two-year numbers 
are much better, in fact), but the Orioles have been unwilling to discuss a 
multiyear contract. They have, in essence, asked Tettleton to go out and make 
the best deal he can, then bring it back and give them a chance to match it. 
</P>
<P>
The bidding does not open until after the free-agent filing period ends 
Saturday. There has been some indication that the Orioles will make another 
offer before any other clubs have an opportunity to talk money, but it seems 
likely that Tettleton will enter the market. 
</P>
<P>
"The Nov. 4 date is not pivotal to us," Attanasio said. "If he signs before 
Nov. 4, it will be because he got an acceptable offer. If he doesn't, we're 
fully prepared to wait and see what's out there." 
</P>
<P>
Daulton's contract only makes it obvious that the market for catching has not 
been affected by the recent worldwide economic crisis, which is very bad news 
for Mickey Tettleton fans in Baltimore.

<P>
DEFENSE: DIAGNOSING PLAYS SPONTANEOUSLY IS THE CORNERSTONE OF COACH DUTTON'S 
PHILOSOPHY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ask any lineman, football games are always won or lost in the trenches. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, in particular, it might come down to the difference between Cal State 
Northridge's suspect offensive line and the dominating defensive line of 
visiting Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
The Western Football Conference title could ride on CSUN's ability to handle 
the nation's second-leading Division II defense against the run. 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo's line is spearheaded by end Patrick Moore and tackle Robert 
Morris. Both are expected to play in the National Football League next season. 
Andres Washington, an end from Glendale College, and Eric Alexander, a tackle 
who earned junior college All-American honors at Riverside, round out the line 
with Mike Hamrick periodically rotating in for Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Hamrick is a transfer from Boise State. So are Moore and Morris. Defensive line 
coach Bill Dutton and head Coach Lyle Setencich also came to San Luis Obispo 
from Boise State. 
</P>
<P>
Dutton, a former Alhambra High and Cal player with coaching experience in the 
United States Football League and the Canadian Football League, as well as the 
Pacific 10 Conference, originally recruited Morris and Moore to attend Boise 
State in 1986. After those players' freshman seasons, Dutton followed Setencich 
to San Luis Obispo, leaving Moore and Morris lost without him. 
</P>
<P>
"I left (Boise State) because of Coach Dutton," Moore said. "After he left, I 
stayed one more year but I didn't like the technique we were using. We were 
blasting, running upfield. We didn't have any reads." 
</P>
<P>
Reading the offense on the run is the cornerstone of Dutton's philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"We ask more of them than blowing a gap and slashing into a particular point," 
Dutton said. "They respond to the screen, the draw, the sucker plays." 
</P>
<P>
Their statistics indicate such versatility. 
</P>
<P>
Morris, 6-foot-5 and 270 pounds, has 33 tackles (five for 30 yards in losses), 
4 1/2 sacks, a fumble recovery and a pass breakup. En route to WFC defensive 
player of the year and Kodak Small College All-American honors last season, he 
made 41 tackles, eight sacks and broke up three pass attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Moore leads the Mustangs this season with 47 tackles (11 for 33 yards in 
losses), 6 1/2 sacks, two pass breakups, a fumble recovery and an interception. 
A first-team All-WFC selection last season, he finished with 57 tackles, 10 
sacks, one interception, a blocked field goal and a pass breakup. 
</P>
<P>
Moore's 41-yard interception return for a touchdown is a prime example of his 
ability to determine what the offense is doing. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a flash screen and he read it beautifully," Dutton said. "He ran it 
back 41 yards; that shows some fine speed. There were running backs who had the 
chance to catch him." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-3, 265-pound Moore also showed good leaping ability and soft hands. 
To make the catch, he had to tip it to himself. 
</P>
<P>
"That is the most excited I've ever been," said Moore, who is clearly not 
excitable. 
</P>
<P>
"I do my job and I go back into the huddle. I'm not too flamboyant." 
</P>
<P>
Morris shares his temperament. 
</P>
<P>
"When I get a sack, it pumps people up, but I'm not into a dance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I get back in the huddle and try to get another to fire up the team. We're not 
out there to be cheerleaders, we're out there to get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
Dutton credits a variety of attributes for the rise of Moore and Morris from 
Division I wannabes to NFL prospects. 
</P>
<P>
"No. 1 is their dedication," Dutton said. "They want to be good. They are 
dedicated to practicing hard, being aggressive and they have the size, strength 
and excellent technique. They have the desire to hit and run to the ball. It 
has been drilled into them for years." 
</P>
<P>
The turning point was in 1988, the year the M&amp;M connection sat out after 
transferring. 
</P>
<P>
"Pat and I worked out really hard in the year off and in the off-seasons," 
Morris said. "We were really hungry to play." 
</P>
<P>
Now that desire is aimed at finding a home in the NFL, something Morris never 
considered at Boise State when he was playing behind future Washington Redskin 
Markus Koch. 
</P>
<P>
"It was unbelievable how good he was compared to me," Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
While Moore has been able to forget about hovering NFL scouts, Morris was 
initially unnerved. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt pressure," he said. "I was stressing too much, trying to make big plays 
and more tackles and more sacks. Then, I settled down and played my game." 
</P>
<P>
Morris ironically calls San Luis Obispo's 20-17 loss to Cal State Sacramento -- 
the Mustangs' only loss -- his best game. 
</P>
<P>
"In the tougher games, your character comes out," he said. "We were losing and 
I was playing hard." 
</P>
<P>
While Troy Mills was the man to stop that day, CSUN's career rushing leader 
Albert Fann is the player Dutton and the Mustang defense will home in on 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"He has the unique ability to find the seam in the defense," Dutton said. "He 
slashes through there, drives his legs and accelerates. He has a lot of power." 
</P>
<P>
As for the line responsible for giving Fann room to run, Morris is careful not 
to give them incentive. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll come up with a big challenge, we'll have our hands full but we'll do all 
right with them." 
</P>
<P>
It is a big game, Morris allows, but no bigger than the past few. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been playing every week like champions," he said. "We had to win the 
last couple weeks anyway and we like playing on the road. We like to have the 
crowd against us."

TAFT STANDS TALL DESPITE 24-19 LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After the game, a single thought kept running through the mind of Taft High 
Coach Tom Stevenson, who stands 6-foot-5. 
</P>
<P>
It had nothing to do with his team failing to measure up. 
</P>
<P>
"We came up short," Stevenson said. "We came up a little short." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Stevenson's overachieving Taft team just ran out of time Friday night 
against Granada Hills, dropping a 24-19 decision in a West Valley League game 
at Taft. 
</P>
<P>
The Toreadors scored with 5 minutes 37 seconds left to take a 19-18 lead, 
marking the first time this season the Highlanders had trailed in Northwest 
Valley Conference play. Taft quarterback Lamar Lawson scored on a one-yard 
keeper to finish off an 11-play, 36-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills (7-1, 5-0 in league play) fired back, however. After Bryan Martin 
(seven of 16 for 221 yards) connected with Alonzo Finney for a 39-yard gain to 
the Taft 38, fullback Brett Washington rumbled inside for 12 yards. 
</P>
<P>
On the next play, Washington went outside on a draw, cut back against the grain 
and scored from 26 yards to give the Highlanders a 24-19 lead with 4:08 left. 
</P>
<P>
Washington finished with 102 yards in 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"I just started left, and then I saw more of my guys to the right," Washington 
said of the cutback, which froze several defenders. "All I saw to the left was 
(Taft) red." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Taft almost had the Highlander defense turning a similar color. Taking 
possession with 4:03 left at its 26, Taft drove to midfield, primarily behind 
tailback Darnell Hendricks. Granada Hills almost left Taft (4-3, 3-2) with too 
much time. 
</P>
<P>
"It was almost too quick," Granada Hills co-Coach Darryl Stroh said, shaking 
his head. "We almost scored too fast." 
</P>
<P>
On a fourth-and-one play at the Taft 49, Hendricks gained eight yards to keep 
the drive alive with 51 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
After an incomplete pass, Lawson was sacked for an eight-yard loss. Lawson 
completed a 12-yard pass to Hendricks to the Highlander 37, but a desperation 
pass to Hendricks and Byron Duncan at the goal line was intercepted by 
defensive back Robert Haywood at the final gun. 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks gained 116 yards in 22 carries, the most any ballcarrier has managed 
this season against the Highlanders. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best back we've seen all year," Stroh said. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Derrick Stewart gave the Highlanders a 6-0 lead on a one-yard run with 
38 seconds left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Even though its offense was held in check in the first half, managing only 69 
yards, Taft pulled even in the second quarter on a 29-yard interception return 
by Daryl Cash.

THOUSAND OAKS, WESTLAKE STRUGGLE TO 41-41 STANDOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It took Westlake High eight years to have an opportunity to win a Marmonte 
League title, but a 69-second drive by Thousand Oaks has put the Warriors' 
title hopes on hold for at least another week. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks running back Greg Buchanan scored on a two-yard run with 16 
seconds left, and quarterback Scott Peterson added the two-point conversion to 
forge a 41-41 tie in front of an overflow crowd of more than 5,000 at Thousand 
Oaks High. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake (8-0-1 overall, 5-0-1 in league play) must defeat Royal (7-1-1, 4-1-1) 
next Friday at Moorpark College if the Warriors are to claim their first title 
since 1982. Thousand Oaks (6-1-2, 4-0-2), which can still win its second 
consecutive title, will play host to Agoura next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake trailed by 13 points midway through the third quarter before rallying 
behind three consecutive scores to take a 34-27 lead with 7 minutes 10 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks pulled within one, 34-33, on a four-yard pass from Peterson (10 
completions in 24 attempts for 131 yards) to Jeff Watts with 3:51 left. 
Peterson's two-point conversion pass fell incomplete in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake came back with a 43-yard touchdown pass from Todd Preston (16 of 25 
for 282 yards, three touchdowns) to Seamus Gibbons on third and four with 1:16 
left. Preston's conversion gave Westlake a 41-33 lead and the Warriors appeared 
to have the game in hand. 
</P>
<P>
But Thousand Oaks was grimly determined. The Lancers took over at their 31 with 
1:09 left and Peterson hit Jeff Trevathan for a 15-yard gain, then found Jeff 
Watts for 16 yards to Westlake's 30. 
</P>
<P>
After an incomplete pass, Peterson scrambled 21 yards to Westlake's nine, then 
dashed six yards to the three with 24 seconds left. After a pass-interference 
call, Buchanan scored. 
</P>
<P>
The game was an offensive display from the start, and the teams combined for 
820 total yards. Preston set school single-season records for touchdown passes 
(20) and passing yardage (2,055). 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks took a 6-0 lead on Buchanan's one-yard run with 5:49 left in the 
first quarter. The drive included a 15-yard completion from Peterson to Shane 
Graham on third and six from Westlake's 27. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake drove 66 yards in four plays, only to turn the ball over when Thousand 
Oaks' Dan Fitzgerald recovered Reuben Allen's fumble at the Lancers' 16. 
</P>
<P>
On Thousand Oaks' second play from scrimmage after the turnover, Cory Bowen 
broke four tackles on a 76-yard run. Fitzgerald's conversion extended Thousand 
Oaks' lead to 14-0 with 7:38 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake, which punted three times and fumbled on its first four drives, 
reached the end zone on its fifth drive, which was set up by Vince Bruno's 
fumble recovery at the Lancers' 32. Preston scored on a nine-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake tied the score when Allen -- 178 yards rushing -- bolted 50 yards with 
2:10 left in the half.

Maurice Stepter caught two second-quarter touchdown passes from Deon Edwards 
and Reseda High held on to defeat San Fernando, 17-15, Friday night in a North 
Valley League game at Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando (4-4, 2-3) missed a chance to tie the score, 14-14, when Jose 
Servin missed a third-quarter conversion after Leonice Brown's 52-yard 
touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
Reseda (4-3, 2-3) increased its lead to 17-13 on Gerald Cohl's 37-yard field 
goal with 4:54 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers appeared to take the lead with 3:04 left when Brown scored from 
eight yards, but the play was nullified because of a clipping penalty. The 
drive ended when Cruz Trevino's fourth-down pass into the end zone was broken 
up by Johann Reece. TODD JACOBSON

VERDUGO HILLS BOGS DOWN IN SECOND HALF OF 28-7 LOSS

<P>
The Dons moved into scoring position on their second possession, but Robert 
Servellon's field-goal attempt from 33 yards was blocked. 
</P>
<P>
Mancilla tied the score, 7-7, with 3:13 left in the first half, taking a pitch 
from quarterback Eddie Espinoza and running 23 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
He scored on a pair of three-yard runs in the second half as Eagle Rock 
improved to 4-3, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Verdugo Hills managed only 14 yards in the second half and was penalized five 
times for 55 yards. 
</P>
<P>
After Alvarado suffered his injury shortly before halftime, "we lost our 
momentum," Verdugo Hills Coach Charley Mack said. "He couldn't throw the ball 
and that limited our options on offense." 
</P>
<P>
Mack also objected to some of the officials' calls, including the ejection of 
offensive lineman Eric McDonagh, who was in a shoving match with opposing 
players after an illegal-procedure penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what game they (referees) were watching, but it wasn't ours," 
Mack said.

BALIAN PLAYING WELL DURING DIFFICULT SEASON FOR DAMIEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defensive tackle Mike Balian played for a young Damien High team last season 
that reached the Southern Section Division IV quarterfinals. An All-San Gabriel 
Valley selection, he was listed on several preseason national prep All-American 
teams during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
Counting on another good season, Balian, 17, said he never expected that his 
team would lose six of eight games and be on the brink of missing the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
No, it hasn't exactly been the storybook season that the 6-foot-4, 253-pound 
Balian envisioned. But longtime Damien Coach Dick Larson said the senior is 
still having a season worthy of his reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if you evaluate it the right way, he's doing what he should be doing 
in his area," Larson said. "He can't be expected to be everywhere out there, 
and he is playing his position well. 
</P>
<P>
"I think when we evaluate a player of his caliber, we sometimes expect him to 
do too much, but he's doing what he's supposed to be doing and then some." 
</P>
<P>
Balian has been recruited by many of the West's top college programs, including 
Colorado, USC, UCLA, Washington, Washington State, Arizona State and Cal. 
</P>
<P>
Balian said his reputation may have worked against him early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I was playing as well as I should have at first, and I also 
didn't expect teams to play me as well as they did," he said. "These last few 
games, I feel like I've played a little more like I expected." 
</P>
<P>
Balian added: "I do think being named to the preseason All-America teams had to 
affect the way some teams prepared for us."

CALABASAS HANDS FILLMORE FIRST LOSS

<P>
Damon Riggins scored on a 14-yard run with 5 minutes 12 seconds left and 
Calabasas High upset previously unbeaten Fillmore, 13-7, in a Frontier League 
game Friday night at Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
Riggins, a senior tailback, rushed for 149 yards in 26 carries and also played 
the entire game on defense. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he was the team's kicker and connected on one of two extra points. 
Only 14 players suited up for Calabasas (3-6 overall, 1-2 in league play). 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore (8-1, 2-1) took a 7-0 lead late in the first half on a 19-yard run by 
Val Pillado, but Calabasas tied the score in the third quarter on a seven-yard 
keeper by quarterback Ron Adelman. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the fourth quarter, Mike Baron of Calabasas intercepted a pass and 
returned the ball to the Fillmore 27-yard line. Calabasas drove to the 10, but 
a fumble was recovered by Fillmore's Gabe Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore was forced to punt five plays later, however, and Calabasas began the 
winning drive. Riggins broke over the left side for a 17-yard gain on the 
second play, and four plays later he burst over the middle, shook off two 
tacklers and romped into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Adelman passed for 90 yards, completing nine of 13 passes. He also rushed for 
42 yards and played the entire game as a defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
Pillado finished with 48 rushing yards for Fillmore. Tailback Tory Cabral, who 
has rushed for 978 yards this season, carried only three times for six yards.

QUARTZ HILL CLINCHES A TIE FOR TITLE

<P>
On a brisk Friday night at Palmdale High, Quartz Hill smelled a Golden League 
title. 
</P>
<P>
And Palmdale was the worse for it. 
</P>
<P>
Quartz Hill scored 35 second-half points in annihilating Palmdale, 49-7. The 
win gave the Rebels a share of the league title and also status as the league's 
No. 1 representative for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale, as it turned out, was just getting in the way. Before garbage time in 
the final minutes, the Falcons had posted just one first down, and that came on 
Anthony Ortega's 63-yard touchdown run, the game's first score. 
</P>
<P>
After that, the deluge. 
</P>
<P>
Quartz Hill (7-2, 4-0 in league play) scored on a 14-yard pass from Jake Haro 
(four of 10 passes, 123 yards, two touchdowns) to Rob Keller with seven seconds 
to play in the half. That gave Quartz Hill a 14-7 lead and the necessary 
emotion to dust Palmdale (3-6, 2-2) in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"It really hurt them when we scored right before the half," Quartz Hill Coach 
John Albee said. "That gave us a lot of emotion in our locker room." 
</P>
<P>
Haro opened the second-half scoring with a 48-yard pass to David Nelson, who 
was so wide open it appeared that he had jumped off the sideline and joined the 
game somewhere down the field. Palmdale never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Quartz Hill's Erik Thomas joined in the fun, scoring three second-half 
touchdowns and finishing the night with a game-high 147 yards rushing in 20 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson rushed for 79 yards as the Rebels piled up 440 yards total. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding Ortega's 63-yard run, Palmdale gained just 37 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I think after the first touchdown of the second half they weren't the same 
football team," Albee said. 
</P>
<P>
Which was surprising, considering the emotion that Palmdale brought into the 
game. After Ortega's run, Coach Kent Bothwell pumped his fists in the air as he 
ran onto the field. 
</P>
<P>
But Quartz Hill struck back after a key interception by Selves Smith at the 
Palmdale 20-yard line. Three plays later, Haro stole in from the one. But the 
kick failed and Palmdale stayed in front, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale could muster little more against a Quartz Hill defense that has been 
among the area's best all season. 
</P>
<P>
This is the first Golden League championship for Quartz Hill since the school 
shared a title in 1981. What remains is a game with Antelope Valley for the 
Rebels to finish with a spotless league mark. Nevertheless, they will be the 
league's top-seeded team. 
</P>
<P>
Meaning? 
</P>
<P>
"You think this was cold?" Albee said, referring to temperatures in the 
low-40s. "Wait till two weeks from now, when it drops to about 30 degrees. 
That's why I want that CIF game up here in two weeks."

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: PADRES HIRE KIMM AS THIRD BASE COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Padres completed their coaching staff Friday by hiring Bruce Kimm, formerly 
of the Pittsburgh Pirates, as their third-base coach. He replaces fired bullpen 
coach Denny Sommers. 
</P>
<P>
Sommers has received an offer to remain in the organization as an advance 
scout, but he has not made a decision. Sommers is the 30th front-office 
employee or coach who has been fired since Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Kimm, 39, a former major league catcher, was an extra coach on Jim Leyland's 
staff the past two seasons. He kept scouting charts during the games while 
sitting in the stands as the Pirates' major league coordinator of instruction. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Manager Greg Riddoch met Kimm when he was in the Cincinnati Red 
organization as a minor league manager and major league coach. Riddoch 
interviewed Kimm Thursday in Denver and offered him the job Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just ecstatic about the staff we've put together," Riddoch said. 
</P>
<P>
The Padre coaching staff for the 1991 season consists of Mike Roarke, pitching 
coach; Merv Rettenmund, hitting coach; Jim Snyder, bench coach; Rob Picciolo, 
first base coach, and Kimm. BOB NIGHTENGALE

FAST-FOOD CHAINS FEEL PRESSURE TO GET RID OF PLASTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For fast-food companies looking to join the Green Revolution, forgoing plastic 
packaging has suddenly become as American as the Golden Arches. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental and industry officials said Friday that McDonald's Corp.'s 
surprise decision this week to switch from plastic or foam packaging to paper 
for most items will put pressure on other fast-food chains to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
"We fully expect there will be a ripple effect from this decision," said Dr. 
Richard Denison, a senior scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund, which 
worked with McDonald's to revise its packaging. "It's an about-face, and 
(McDonald's) decision to not use the material and not be on the firing line 
will only up the pressure on others." 
</P>
<P>
Many major fast-food chains said Friday that they had already made the 
changeover to paper from foam packaging or were planning to do so because of 
the growing public concern about landfills and the environment. Burger King, 
the No. 2 hamburger chain, already uses lightweight paper boxes. 
</P>
<P>
The decision is also a blow to the polystyrene industry, which sells about 20% 
of its products to fast-food restaurants. The industry is already under attack 
in some localities because the manufacturing process gives off ozone-depleting 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Like other disposables -- from Bic pens to Pampers diapers -- the cushiony, 
pastel-colored foam package that serves as a home to Big Macs and Chicken 
McNuggets has become a staple of the American throw-away lifestyle. Foam boxes 
keep burgers hotter longer than paper packaging and are less expensive to 
produce. 
</P>
<P>
To package foods in its 8,000 restaurants, McDonald's uses an estimated 7% or 
more of the 1 billion pounds of polystyrene manufactured in the United States 
every year. That made the corporation a lightning rod for environmentalists 
concerned about plastic's indestructibility and the space the containers 
consume in landfills. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's had been moving toward a plan to recycle all its plastic containers. 
Instead, the company on Thursday announced a quick and unexpected decision to 
switch to paper and foil wrappers and boxes within 60 days. The decision was 
aimed at dispelling adverse publicity that McDonald's was not a good 
environmental citizen. 
</P>
<P>
Others have already jumped on the green bandwagon. McDonald's archrival Burger 
King has never used foam boxes for burgers, a spokeswoman said. Anaheim-based 
Carl's Jr. switched to cardboard containers in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy's tried plastic foam containers in 1986 for its Classic Sandwich. But 
they proved so cumbersome to handle compared to paper wraps -- and trash cans 
filled up so quickly -- that the containers never were used again, said 
spokesman Denny Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
Foodmaker Inc., the San Diego-based parent company of the Jack-in-the-Box 
chain, has gone so far in its drive to eliminate plastics that drinks to be 
consumed at its restaurants will soon be served without lids, unless a customer 
requests one, said spokeswoman Jan McLane Reiger. 
</P>
<P>
Still, foam packaging is unlikely to disappear entirely from the restaurant 
industry. Many independent take-out eateries depend entirely on foam clam-shell 
trays. Restaurants use them as doggie bags. Foam packages are likely to 
continue to be used for wet or unusually shaped items such as salads or baked 
potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
And though the industry may try, one venerable foam item is proving the most 
difficult of all to eliminate: the Styrofoam coffee cup. 
</P>
<P>
So far, McDonald's and other chains say they cannot find a reasonable cardboard 
substitute that would be readily accepted by a public wary of burnt fingers and 
scorched thighs. One of the few exceptions is Burger King, which says that it 
will give paper cups a try following a successful test. 
</P>
<P>
The plastics debate may be heating up among fast-food providers, but it should 
not have any great effect on the bottom line. The switch to paper packaging 
carries a negligible cost, said analyst Steven A. Rockwell of Alex. Brown &amp; 
Co.

BRITISH SATELLITE TV NETWORKS PLAN TO MERGE; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: THE TWO RIVAL SYSTEMS HAD BEEN LOSING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EACH 
WEEK.

<TEXT>
<P>
After losing a combined $2.4 billion, Britain's rival satellite television 
networks announced Friday that they will merge, ending a bitter and expensive 
battle for market domination. 
</P>
<P>
Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television will join with British Satellite Broadcasting, 
which is owned primarily by a consortium of European media companies. The new 
joint venture will be controlled 50-50 by Murdoch's News International and 
BSB's principal shareholders, Granada Television Ltd., Pearson PLC, Reed 
International and the French group Chargeurs, according to a company 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
It's the "end of a satellite war," said the anchor on Sky Television's all-news 
channel, which broke the story on its 9 p.m. newscast. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate information on when the merger would take place, but a 
News Corp. source said merger discussions have been under way for three weeks. 
The new company will be called British Sky Television. 
</P>
<P>
The two companies broadcast via satellite direct to homeowners, who must 
purchase small dish antennas to receive the programs. 
</P>
<P>
Both satellite networks have been losing millions of dollars each week, with 
neither company able to sign up enough subscribers to be profitable. Sky is in 
about 1.6 million homes, while BSB has signed up less than 100,000. At the same 
time, the rivalry has forced Sky and BSB into bidding wars for programming, 
dramatically escalating costs. 
</P>
<P>
Buying films for the pay movie channel that each network operates proved 
especially costly, with both companies competing for rights to the same films. 
While the rivalry was good for Hollywood's studios, the merger is expected to 
result in lower fees paid for films. "We've paid ridiculous prices. That 
inevitably will change," said one Murdoch executive, who declined to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
But the new company will still be hungry for movies. Although Sky's four 
channels and BSB's five will be pared down to a combined total of five 
channels, two of those will be their existing pay-movie channels. There was no 
information Friday on the content of the other three channels. 
</P>
<P>
The new network will be transmitted from both Sky's satellite system and the 
one used by BSB, but an individual close to Murdoch said his company would 
manage the joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
"The combined investment to date incurred by Sky and BSB exceeds 1.25 billion 
pounds," or about $2.4 billion, according to the company announcement. "This 
investment continues, but both parties are confident that together they will 
provide more effective competition to existing broadcasters on a profitable 
basis." 
</P>
<P>
BSB is believed to have invested about $1.8 billion to date, while News Corp. 
executives say they have put about $600 million into their enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
With news of the merger coming so late in the day, there was little public 
reaction. But Michael Grade, head of the British broadcast network Channel 
Four, appeared on a news program and denounced the merger. He declared it 
"scandalous" that Rupert Murdoch, who also owns five national newspapers, 
should have such extensive control of British media. The merger apparently will 
have to be approved by Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The merger should help Murdoch's much-publicized debt problems, as Sky has been 
a major drain on his company. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Sky with BSB should save Murdoch's News Corp. about $200 million in its 
current year, said a source familiar with the deal. 
</P>
<P>
News Corp. continued to believe that Sky would turn a profit in two years, the 
source said. The company believed that it might have to spend as much as 
another $1 billion over the next two years to win its battle with BSB. "It 
probably would have won in the end. But it would have been two hard-fought 
years. We always believed if there were a single service covering all the U.K. 
. . . my God, it would be a bonanza. Well, 50% of this is a bonanza." 
</P>
<P>
While the merger should ease Murdoch's building cash flow crunch, a News Corp. 
official said further restructuring remained likely, including the possible 
sale of one or more of Murdoch's U.S. magazines. But the official denied 
widespread rumors that all of Murdoch's American magazines, including New York 
and Mirabella, were up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
BSB, which was launched last April, has been beset by problems, including 
manufacturing setbacks that severely hindered it from getting its dish 
receivers into stores for months. 
</P>
<P>
Sky, which debuted in February, 1989, has had more success in reaching viewers, 
but has still been losing about $4 million each week.

CBS, NBC DROP ELECTION NIGHT ADS IN RATINGS MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CBS and NBC, both facing a severe slump in advertising revenues, have made the 
unusual decision to drop commercials from next Tuesday's election coverage in 
moves designed to bolster the ratings of their entertainment shows. 
</P>
<P>
The decision is the most sobering example yet of how the soft advertising 
economy is affecting the once-robust television industry. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, ABC was unable to sell at least six spots in "Monday Night 
Football," usually one of the highest-rated shows of the week. All three 
networks have had to delay making program changes so as not to forfeit tens of 
millions of dollars in badly needed sponsor commitments. 
</P>
<P>
Although likely to be promoted as a high-minded public service initiative, 
network executives privately attributed the reason for dropping commercials to 
the fact that programs without commercials are not rated by the A. C. Nielsen 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
The networks have just entered the crucial November "sweeps" period, when their 
performance determines how local affiliates will set ad rates for the next 
quarter. By deleting little-watched election coverage from the ratings, CBS and 
NBC will be able to boost their sweeps numbers. "This makes it a level playing 
field," an NBC executive said about the two networks' strategies. "We are 
anticipating a close sweeps race, and elections get marginal ratings anyway." 
ABC plans to run advertisements during its election coverage. 
</P>
<P>
At CBS, sources said, the decision to drop commercials from election coverage 
came at the urging of the entertainment division in Hollywood, which has 
recently seen CBS move up to second place this season. It was feared that a 
low-rated news program could depress CBS' ratings during the sweeps, just as 
the network was picking up momentum for its entertainment shows. 
</P>
<P>
"The great byproduct of this is there will be no rating number," said a senior 
CBS executive in New York. "That should help in the sweeps." 
</P>
<P>
CBS News will produce a two-hour block of election coverage at a cost of more 
than $400,000. In addition, the network will forgo more than $1 million in ad 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
All through the 1980s, the networks gradually cut back on the time they devoted 
to election-night coverage, mostly because the cost of hiring hundreds of 
part-time employees is hard to justify in an age of tight budgets and limited 
viewer interest. 
</P>
<P>
Like low voter turnouts, ratings for election coverage are notoriously weak. 
During the 1988 presidential election, ABC and NBC each attracted about 10% of 
the TV audience, while CBS pulled in only 9%. Typically, the three networks 
each attract between 13% and 15% of the audience on any given night. 
</P>
<P>
Advertisers, who are under pressure to reduce expenditures as a recession 
looms, frequently target news programs first when looking for ways to trim 
their ad budgets. CBS "tried to sell it, but there was no interest, so they 
junked it," said David Corvo, vice president of public affairs programming at 
CBS News. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, CBS broadcast a one-hour tribute to the late CBS founder 
William S. Paley, also without commercials. Publicly, CBS officials said the 
decision to withhold commercials from the Paley special had been made long ago 
out of respect for the late chairman, who died Oct. 24. But privately, some at 
CBS contended that advertising was not sold out of fear the program would drag 
down sweeps ratings. 
</P>
<P>
CBS is planning to broadcast two hours of election coverage between 9 p.m. and 
11 p.m., when it would normally run a movie. ABC and NBC will start their 
coverage at 10 p.m. and sign off at 11 p.m. for local news. They will then 
return for an 11:30 p.m. "wrap-up." NBC said it would run commercials during 
the post-11:30 p.m. portion. 
</P>
<P>
ABC still plans to run commercials during its election coverage but, 
reportedly, at heavily discounted rates. Thirty-second commercials on election 
night were said to be selling for about $50,000, compared to more than $100,000 
usually paid for a prime-time spot. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers will still see a handful of commercials, however, since affiliates will 
continue to run spots during "cut-away" segments when the network hands over 
seven minutes of air time for the reporting of local races.

FOR SALE: USED S&amp;LS, INCLUDING LINCOLN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES and GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, the Irvine-based thrift that has become a symbol of 
the nation's savings and loan debacle, was put up for sale Friday by federal 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Once owned by Charles H. Keating Jr., Lincoln was one of 18 failed savings and 
loans put on the block by the federal Resolution Trust Corp., the agency formed 
last year to clean up the S&amp;L mess. Also put up for sale was Imperial 
Federal Savings Assn. in San Diego, the largest failed thrift in the state. 
</P>
<P>
The failure of Lincoln, seized by regulators on April 14, 1989, is expected to 
cost taxpayers more than $2 billion, which could make it the most expensive 
S&amp;L failure ever. The RTC on Friday said Lincoln has $2.7 billion in assets 
and $2.4 billion in deposits in its 29 branches. Lincoln has continued to post 
huge losses, losing $327.3 million in the first six months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln, Imperial and the other 16 thrifts are being sold thanks to a loophole 
in last year's thrift bailout bill. It allows the government to borrow up to 
$18.8 billion to keep the bailout from stalling. 
</P>
<P>
Congress adjourned last weekend without providing more money for the cleanup. 
Federal regulators had been planning to sell or close 192 failed S&amp;Ls, with 
assets valued at $119 billion, over the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
Both Lincoln and Imperial are expected to be sold in either January or 
February, an RTC executive said. Most deals the RTC is doing now involved only 
the sale of branches, deposits and a minimum of assets, typically low-risk home 
loans. In recent months, the main bidders for large failed thrifts in the west 
have been two giant California banks, BankAmerica Corp. in San Francisco and 
Security Pacific Corp. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln probably has become the best-known failed thrift in the nation. 
Keating, who faces numerous criminal and civil charges, used the thrift to 
build vast real estate and resort projects. He also battled with regulators, 
who argued that the thrift was a time bomb waiting to explode. Such politicians 
as Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) have been criticized for ties to Keating. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial, which has 78 offices in California, was the nation's 16th largest 
S&amp;L when it was seized on Feb. 23 and severed from its parent firm, 
Imperial Corp. of America. Regulators linked Imperial's failure to the 
S&amp;L's troubled junk bond holdings, bought largely through the collapsed 
Drexel Burnham Lambert investment bank, and losses in consumer loans, 
especially auto loans. 
</P>
<P>
During 1989, Imperial held about $1.5 billion in junk bonds, making it the 
second largest holder of junk bonds among the nation's thrifts. The S&amp;L 
held slightly more than $1 billion in junk bonds when seized, and now has about 
$700 million in junk bonds, according to Imperial spokesman KennUlrich. The RTC 
said Imperial has $7.9 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial has been linked in shareholder suits to an alleged "daisy chain" that 
involved Imperial, Drexel and various clients of Drexel. The suits allege that 
former Drexel junk-bond financier Michael Milken orchestrated junk-bond deals 
for Imperial to pump up fees for Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L's financial woes were driven by a decision to bolster Imperial's 
profit margins by entering non-traditional and risky businesses such as junk 
bonds and consumer lending. The strategy worked for a while, but Imperial 
lacked the expertise to manage the troubled consumer loan portfolio. Imperial's 
troubles were compounded when the market for junk bonds fell apart in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial entered non-traditional businesses during the mid-1980s under the 
leadership of Ken Thygerson, a former banking industry regulator who once 
acknowledged that Imperial's non-traditional business ventures were "strange

THE LINCOLN SAVINGS SAGA (Southland Edition) 
</P>
<P>
1926: Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan receives its California charter. 
</P>
<P>
1976: Charles H. Keating Jr. moves to Phoenix from Cincinnati to take over 
Continental Homes of Arizona from parent company, American Financial Corp., 
later known as American Continental Corp. 
</P>
<P>
1979: Keating settles with Securities and Exchange Commission after being 
accused of making insider bank loans totaling $14 million while at AFC. 
</P>
<P>
1984: American Continental acquires Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan for $51 million, 
moving the S&amp;L out of the home-mortgage business and into speculative real 
estate and junk bond investments. 
</P>
<P>
1985: Keating opposes regulations imposed by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board 
limiting the amount of direct investments S&amp;Ls make in speculative real 
estate and other ventures. 
</P>
<P>
1986: Federal and state regulators begin examination of Lincoln's books. 
Federal regulators contend that Lincoln failed to report losses. Keating says 
regulators are harassing Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
1987: Bank board alerts SEC of possible securities violations. Federal 
regulators in San Francisco recommend a federal seizure of Lincoln. Five 
senators, including Alan Cranston (D-Calif), meet with Edwin Gray, head of 
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, on Keating's behalf. M. Danny Wall replaces Gray. 
The SEC launches an investigation of American Continental. 
</P>
<P>
1988: Wall orders a new examination and a transfer of Lincoln's supervision 
from San Francisco to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
1989: In April, American Continental files for protection under Chapter 11 of 
the bankruptcy code, restricting regulators' access to its records. The next 
day Lincoln is seized by federal regulators. Keating sues to regain control of 
Lincoln. Hundreds of American Continental bondholders sue Keating for fraud. 
Resolution Trust Corp. in September files a $1.1-billion civil racketeering and 
bank-fraud lawsuit against Keating and 19 associates. Keating refuses to 
testify before the House Banking Committee in November. Senate Ethics Committee 
begins probe of charges that Cranston and other senators improperly intervened 
with federal regulators on Lincoln's behalf. Wall resigns. State and federal 
grand juries begin criminal investigations. 
</P>
<P>
1990: Keating says in federal court that regulators wrecked Lincoln. The state 
attorney general, through Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, wins approval for 
a special state grand jury to investigate possible criminal wrongdoing in the 
sale of American Continental bonds. The State Department of Corporations sues 
Keating and two executives for the return of $200 million to bondholders. 
Federal judge rules that regulators acted properly in seizing Lincoln, saying 
Keating looted it. Keating resigns from American Continental. Office of Thrift 
Supervision seeks $41 million in restitution from Keating. A state grand jury 
indicts Keating and three associates on 42 counts of fraud relating to the sale 
of American Continental bonds. Keating spends a month in Los Angeles County 
Jail before being released -- when his bail is reduced to $300,000 from $5 
million.

Brokerage Fee Case to Go to Jury: Arguments in a suit over a disputed 
multimillion-dollar brokerage fee ended in Orange County Superior Court in 
Santa Ana, and the jury is expected to begin deliberations Monday. Real estate 
broker Lee &amp; Associates alleges that it was cheated out of a $9-million 
commission when Fluor Corp. sold its Irvine headquarters to Trammell Crow Co. 
in 1985. Lee is seeking $64 million in restitution and damages against Fluor, 
the giant engineering and construction company, and Trammell Crow, one of the 
nation's top commercial developers.

BASS-LED INVESTOR GROUP ACQUIRES 7.2% OF HOMEFED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON and CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group led by Idanta Partners, a La Jolla investment firm whose principal 
owners are the Bass brothers of Texas, has acquired 7.2% of HomeFed Corp.'s 
outstanding shares, according to a Friday filing with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Idanta founder and general partner David J. Dunn on Friday maintained that his 
firm acquired the HomeFed stock for investment purposes only. He said his group 
has no plans to take over HomeFed, which is based in San Diego, and combine the 
savings and loan with American Savings, the Irvine-based thrift that is owned 
by a group headed by Robert F. Bass, one of Idanta's investors. 
</P>
<P>
Idanta acquired nearly all its 1.6 million HomeFed shares between Oct. 17 and 
23, paying from $4.54 to $6.675 per share. Over the past several months, Idanta 
also has acquired positions in Wells Fargo and Security Pacific Bank, as well 
as HomeFed, Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
With a total investment portfolio valued at $100 million, Idanta is best known 
for investments in high-technology stocks such as Apple Computer, Sun 
Microsystems and Intel. It has also provided venture capital to a number of 
start-up high technology firms, including Pacific Communications Sciences of 
San Diego and Iomega of Utah. Dunn is a former chairman of Prime Computer. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn, 60, said that the Bass brothers were not aware of Idanta's HomeFed 
investment until news services reported it. "I haven't talked to Bob Bass in 
two or three years," Dunn said. SEC flings made on Friday identify Idanta as a 
Texas limited partnership whose "principal business is investing and 
reinvesting its assets in securities of all kinds." 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed President Robert Adelizzi said Friday that HomeFed knows little about 
Idanta, other than that the La Jolla group "has an excellent reputation." 
Adelizzi said he was "not surprised" by Idanta's stock purchases because, for 
months, HomeFed has publicly stated that its stock is undervalued. 
</P>
<P>
The Idanta-led group is now one of the HomeFed's largest shareholders.

GENERAL MILLS TO BUILD A NEW CEREAL FACTORY

General Mills' board has approved plans to construct a new breakfast cereal 
manufacturing plant in Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
The plant will be General Mills' eighth major domestic packaged foods plant and 
the company's first in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
Site preparation for the plant was expected to begin late this year, subject to 
completion of real estate transactions, issuance of industrial revenue bonds, 
an environmental audit and other conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The plant will be part of General Mills' plans to invest $1.65 billion in new 
fixed assets during the next three years to support continued growth in the 
country's packaged consumer foods and restaurant businesses. 
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, the company's dollar share of the $7-billion 
ready-to-eat breakfast cereal market has increased by five percentage points to 
a record 27%. 
</P>
<P>
General Mills had sales of $6.5 billion in the fiscal year ending in May, with 
consumer packaged foods accounting for about two thirds of those sales. 
</P>
<P>
General Mills employs about 100,000 people worldwide.

NORMAN SPARKS CLIPPER RALLY;

PRO BASKETBALL: AFTER LEADING AT HALFTIME, SACRAMENTO SCORES ONLY 34 POINTS IN 
SECOND HALF AND LOSES, 90-80.

Ken Norman scored 18 of his 24 points in the second half and Bo Kimble got 14 
of his 22 over the final two quarters as the Clippers overcame a sluggish 
offensive performance to beat the Sacramento Kings, 90-80, Friday night in the 
season opener before 12,845 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers led by only five, 66-61, to open the fourth quarter, but pushed 
the advantage to 84-72 with 3:38 to play, with Kimble and Norman scoring 14 of 
the 18 points during the run. 
</P>
<P>
Wayman Tisdale scored 24 to lead the Kings, who had only 34 points in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
The lead-in to the opener didn't exactly fit the script, this being the most 
anticipated season in Clipper history. 
</P>
<P>
First, Danny Manning was declared out for the first game and maybe the second, 
Sunday against Golden State, because of tendinitis in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
Then Thursday, Benoit Benjamin suffered what originally was thought to be a 
strained muscle in his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Friday morning, it was announced the starting center actually separated his 
shoulder, won't play against the Kings, and is day-to-day from there. 
</P>
<P>
So what did it take to turn the emotional tide? 
</P>
<P>
Nothing more than the lineups being announced. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble, given the start at shooting guard despite having made only 34% of his 
shots in the eight exhibition games, was given a semi-standing ovation by the 
crowd. The former Loyola Marymount star said before he was not nervous, but he 
had made preparations for a more dramatic moment, just in case. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble made four of seven attempts in the first half -- a few long-range bombs 
that swished, a few bad misses. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble didn't go to the line in the first half, so his much-publicized 
left-handed shot, a tribute to close friend Hank Gathers, had to wait until the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
A natural right-hander, he hadn't shot a lefty since the NCAA tournament last 
spring, the first time he used the free throw as a memorial to Gathers, who 
made the switch to southpaw while playing at Loyola to improve his shooting. 
Friday afternoon, he took 15 tries as a warmup. 
</P>
<P>
The moment came with 9:33 to play in the third quarter, when he was fouled by 
Sacramento rookie Lionel Simmons, a high school rival of teammates Kimble and 
Gathers in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble didn't stall for dramatic effect. Looking to convert a three-point play, 
he made a couple quick bounces and launched the shot, not looking terribly 
awkward in the process. The shot missed badly, bouncing off the right side off 
the rim, not that the real point was to get a point. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind the attention put on it because it's a great thing," he explained 
before the game. "It is important to me, and I think it's important to the 
fans, too. But if they're going to put a lot of attention on it, they should 
realize why it really matters." 
</P>
<P>
It appeared at the time it might matter in a Clipper victory as Sacramento, the 
consensus last-place team in the Pacific Division, used a 15-0 run at the end 
of the first quarter and early parts of the second to take a 46-39 lead at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers were clearly struggling in the first half, committing 11 turnovers 
and shooting just 25%. But Norman and Kimble brought them back in the second 
half, enabling the Clippers to start the season on a winning note. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Chances are good Benoit Benjamin will also miss Sunday's game, and he could be 
out as many as seven days. The sixth-year center isn't even scheduled to be 
examined again by Dr. Tony Daly, the Clipper team physician, until Monday. "He 
feels good about doing something Sunday," trainer Keith Jones said before the 
game. "That's not out of the question, but it is doubtful. Danny Manning, who 
is listed as day-to-day, will be checked Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
NBA Commissioner David Stern is expected to attend Sunday's 6 p.m. game against 
Golden State. Stern attended the Utah-Phoenix game Friday in Tokyo and will be 
stopping in Los Angeles on his way back to New York. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Grant has become the second Clipper to change his uniform number for this 
season, switching from the No. 23 he wore for two seasons to No. 1. "Just 
trying to so something different," said Grant, returning after missing a broken 
ankle Feb. 2 ended his 1989-90 season. "Twenty-three didn't give me much luck, 
injury wise." Ken Norman had already changed from No. 33 to No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Mike Schuler, on his first game as a head coach since January of 1989: 
"The feeling I had four years ago (in his debut with Portland) was a great deal 
more anxiety. It was my first game as an NBA head coach, the chance to do 
something I've dreamed about and worked all my life to accomplish. I know now 
what to expect."

Mission Viejo High School's defense beat El Toro, 21-9, before an overflow 
crowd of 8,000 at Mission Viejo Friday with the South Coast League title on the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
The operative word here is beat. 
</P>
<P>
"This win will go down in Diablo lore," said Mike Rush, Mission Viejo coach. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo stuffed El Toro's running game and even managed to slow its 
passing attack. Except for a touchdown on its first series, El Toro managed 
only a safety. 
</P>
<P>
The victory puts Mission Viejo (8-1, 4-0 in league play) a victory away from 
the outright league championship and means the Diablos will be the top-seeded 
team from the South Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo also could take over the county's No. 1 ranking next week. El 
Toro (8-1, 3-1) had been top-ranked since the season started. 
</P>
<P>
If you throw out that first drive, El Toro seemed like a discouraged team for 
most of the showdown. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo could thank Bill Denny, a strong safety who plays more like a 
linebacker, and Beau LeBreton, a defensive end, for that. 
</P>
<P>
The two seemed to be in El Toro's backfield constantly, either slamming a 
running back to the turf or pressuring quarterback Rob Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
LeBreton had three sacks and swatted away a key third-down pass on the Mission 
Viejo 17-yard line late in the game. It was one of many times El Toro drove 
deep into Mission Viejo territory but came away without scoring. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew what we had to do . . . shut down Rob, shut down (running back Bret) 
Sanders, make the big plays and execute," LeBreton said. 
</P>
<P>
It all worked flawlessly. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Mission Viejo: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Held El Toro on downs at the Mission Viejo five. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Intercepted a Johnson pass at its own 36. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stopped El Toro twice more on downs before game's end. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'd have to credit their defense," said Bob Johnson, El Toro coach. 
"They stopped us when they had to. This is a tough loss for us. Real tough." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Snowden, Mission Viejo quarterback, threw touchdown passes to three 
different receivers as the Diablos led, 21-7, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
After Johnson hit Darren Doalson with a simple screen pass that turned into a 
19-yard touchdown play, Snowden got hot. 
</P>
<P>
He completed a four-yard lob to Doug Roberson with 3:41 left in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, he completed touchdown passes of 24 yards to Denny and 
14 yards to Anthony Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
After halftime, Mission Viejo turned the game over to its defense. The Diablos 
didn't plan it that way; it just happened. 
</P>
<P>
Snowden completed 11 of 20 passes for 133 yards to Johnson's 16 for 31 for 215 
yards and one interception. Snowden came into the game completing 68.4% of his 
passes; Johnson 71.4%. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the kids last week that they were special," Rush said. "We've dwelled 
on that. Nobody thought much of us at the beginning of the year."

The Buena Park High School football team clinched its first playoff appearance 
since 1981 with a 28-13 Freeway League victory over Troy Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park is 5-4, 3-1 in league and tied for Fullerton for second place with a 
week left in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
The Coyotes can finish no worse than third. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park junior Angel Barrios helped lead a second-half comeback, rushing for 
211 yards on 20 carries and a 16-yard touchdown. It was his fourth consecutive 
200-plus-yard game this season. 
</P>
<P>
Troy (3-6, 1-3), which could have climbed into contention for third and a 
playoff berth with a victory, saw its chances fade when senior quarterback Greg 
Windle injured his left (throwing) wrist in the first half. He was taken to the 
hospital for X-rays at halftime, and Coach John Turek said the preliminary 
diagnosis was a break. 
</P>
<P>
Windle dominated before being forced from the game, completing six of 14 passes 
for 177 yards and sparked his team to a 13-0 lead. One of his completions 
resulted in a 96-yard touchdown pass play with Steve Friedrich in the first 
quarter, the longest in Troy history. 
</P>
<P>
But Windle's injury forced Turek to go with an inexperienced sophomore, Bryan 
Burchit, who didn't complete a pass in seven attempts, and was sacked three 
times by the Coyotes' swarming defense. 
</P>
<P>
That allowed the winners to recover, and they took a 14-13 lead on their first 
possession of the second half when running back Robert Starks scored on a 
two-yard run. DENNIS KAISER

Sunny Hills High School, the defending Freeway League champions, clinched at 
least a tie for the league title with a 28-0 victory over Fullerton Friday 
night in front of 3,500 at Buena Park High. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth consecutive victory for the Lancers (6-3, 4-0 in league) over 
Fullerton, which dropped to 7-2 and 3-1. Fullerton and Buena Park, which play 
next Thursday, are tied for second place and both are bound for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers now have outscored their league opponents, 118-6. The only 
touchdown they have allowed in those games was scored two weeks ago by Troy. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense has risen to the occasion all year long," said Sunny Hills Coach 
Tim Devaney, who is guaranteed of his 10th winning season in 11 years at the 
school. "There's no reason they are not going to play good football against 
their cross-town rivals." 
</P>
<P>
That they did. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancer defense was outstanding throughout the night, allowing Fullerton 64 
yards rushing and 58 passing and sacking Indian quarterback Daniel Chacon six 
times. Jeff Hicks had three of those sacks, Clayton Lau had two, and Mark 
Veronda added another. 
</P>
<P>
On offense, Sunny Hills relied on senior running back Mike Sullivan, who rushed 
for 106 yards in 13 carries and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan set the stage for the Lancer rout on the opening kickoff, which he 
returned 31 yards to the Fullerton 38-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
From there, Sunny Hills marched the remaining 62 yards on 11 plays, opening the 
scoring on a two-yard run by Sullivan with 7:30 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers increased their lead to 14-0 with 8:10 left in the second period on 
a one-yard sneak by senior quarterback Hakeim McKenzie. The touchdown was set 
up on the previous play, a fourth-and-five situation from the Fullerton 36-yard 
line. Running back Kenny Overby connected with wide receiver Stephen Choe on a 
35-yard flea-flicker. 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills needed only one play on its next possession to take a 21-0 halftime 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan broke a tackle at the line of scrimmage and sprinted along the left 
sideline for a 68-yard touchdown run with 4:11 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
The next touchdown showed that Sunny Hills was both good and lucky on this 
night. 
</P>
<P>
On a fourth-and-five from their own 28-yard line, punter Steve Ashton took the 
snap from center, but decided not to try to punt because of heavy pressure from 
a Fullerton defender. He then took off up the right sideline and didn't stop 
until he had scored a 72-yard touchdown with 6:45 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Overby, the other half of a dynamic rushing tandem with Sullivan, gained 46 
yards in 11 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Chacon, the running quarterback, had better luck passing the ball than he did 
rushing. He completed all eight passes he attempted for 58 yards but was held 
to minus 16 yards on the ground.

HERNANDEZ'S KICK ENDS BREA'S SEVEN-YEAR HEX

Football games like this are usually measured in yards. But you could size up 
Brea-Olinda High School's 23-21 victory over host Valencia Friday night in the 
width of the smile Brea kicker Marco Hernandez was wearing afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez's 25-yard field goal sailed straight and true with 42 seconds left 
and gave Brea Coach John Looney his first victory over Valencia in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Marco to go out and win us the Orange League championship," Looney 
said. "Inside, I was just praying he'd make it." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez's kick set off a wild celebration on the Brea sideline. And it gave 
the Wildcats (6-2-1, 3-0-1 in league) the inside track on the league 
championship. Brea can clinch the title with a victory at home next week 
against Western. 
</P>
<P>
The decisive field goal was set up on a 43-yard option pass play from Jamie 
Baraglia to Mike Ryan after a lateral from quarterback Jason Luevanos. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia (8-1, 3-1) took a 21-7 lead early in the third quarter on John 
Fewell's third touchdown run of the game. Fewell carried 16 times for 131 
yards. Brea's comeback started with Brook Coop's two-yard touchdown plunge in 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
With 3:13 left after the second of three tough Brea defensive stands, Luevanos 
hit a sliding Rick Taylor in the end zone from 11 yards out to cut Valencia's 
lead to 21-20. But Luevanos' pass attempt on the two-point conversion was 
batted away by Korey Alexander. STUART MATTHEWS

Jeremy Brion rushed for 158 yards on 16 carries and scored a touchdown to lead 
Capistrano Valley to a 25-14 victory over Irvine in a South Coast League game 
at Capistrano Valley High School Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Brion, who ran for 113 yards in the second half, piled up a large amount of 
yardage during an eight-play drive in the fourth quarter that put Capistrano 
Valley ahead, 18-6. The Cougars (7-2, 2-2 in league) got the ball at their own 
21 after holding Irvine on downs with 9 minutes 18 seconds left in the game 
with the score, 11-6. Brion carried the ball six times, including the final 
four plays, for 61 yards, including his eight-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine tried to rally, but the Capistrano Valley defense once again held the 
Vaqueros on downs and the Cougars had the ball at their own 39 with 4:38 left 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
Brion carried the ball 12 yards to the 27, and two plays later, Allan Perlas 
ran nine yards around the left side for the score. Tomek Mikler's extra point 
increased the lead to 25-6. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine (6-3, 2-2 in league) scored with 43 seconds remaining when Aron Garcia 
ran six yards for the score. Garcia threw to Chris Perry for the two-point 
conversion. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley scored first on Tony Solliday's one-yard run. Solliday threw 
to Dave Poltl for the two-point conversion. The Cougars added three more when a 
blocked punt set up Mikler's 24-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine made it 11-6 when Jason Minici threw 32 yards to Mark Huffmann for the 
score. The two-point pass failed.

Marcus Jenkins intercepted two passes and ran for a touchdown to lead Dana 
Hills to a 37-27 victory over San Clemente in a South Coast League game Friday 
night at San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins, a junior, helped the Dolphins (4-4-1, 1-3) rally from a 20-10 
second-quarter deficit. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente (4-5, 0-4 in league) led early behind the passing of Ken Dolan and 
the running of Shane Shanafelt. 
</P>
<P>
Dolan threw a nine-yard touchdown pass to Chris Carroll on the first series,

After an 11-yard touchdown run by Shanafelt made it 13-3, Nick Nosek ran eight 
yards for a touchdown, making it 13-10 in the second quarter. An interception 
by Jenkins set up the score. 
</P>

A good thing came in threes Thursday at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center with the appearance of Joe Pass, George Shearing and Joe Williams in a 
program billed as "A Gathering of Friends." The concert was presented as part 
of the Irvine Symphony Orchestra's Performing Arts Center Series. 
</P>
<P>
Pass opened solo with a playful, yet polished, presentation of standards. The 
guitarist achieved an almost orchestral effect, backing single-note melody 
statements with smart chording and the infrequent bass lines, toying with 
rhythms and twisting familiar themes into something barely recognizable. " 
'Round Midnight" opened at a gentle, reserved pace before shifting into swing. 
In an Ellington tribute, "Mood Indigo" evolved into "Satin Doll" with a line 
from "Don't Get Around Much Anymore" thrown in near the end. 
</P>
<P>
Pass' subtle ability to move between moods shone on Oscar Hammerstein's "It's A 
Wonderful World," developing from a stately dance-like figure into a rich, 
rhythmic affirmation. 
</P>
<P>
The guitarist added percussion to his complex voicings with pops of his strings 
and infrequent taps on his instrument's body. 
</P>
<P>
Shearing, in the company of bassist Neil Swainson, also stuck to familiar 
numbers, which he embellished with shifting textures and rhythms. Standouts 
included his moody reading of "Misty" and the crisp, unison statement between 
bass and piano on the theme to Miles Davis' "Donna Lee," the bop-era workhorse 
that Shearing managed to work into a barrelhouse rag. A particularly somber 
rendition of the World War I nostalgia tune, "Lili Marlene," was full of 
foreboding derived from a minor key setting. 
</P>
<P>
And yes, Shearing played his signature tune, "Lullaby of Birdland." 
</P>
<P>
Bassist Swainson seemed a perfect musical foil for his employer, supplying a 
steady walk, speedy theme statements in tandem with the keyboard and melodic, 
to-the-point soloing. His improvisation on "Donna Lee" was a showcase of 
agility and ideas. 
</P>
<P>
On the downside, the pianist delivered much the same between-tune chatter 
("Delighted to see you," is the blind musician's standard greeting to an 
audience) that he used during his Performing Arts Center appearance last year, 
even stooping to tell the same jokes. One would hope that this tired patter 
might reflect something new the next time he comes to town, or be dropped 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, backed by Shearing, Swainson and drummer Clayton Cameron, put his 
bouncy, brassy voice to blues and standards such as "Just Friends" and 
Ellington's "I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart." Despite his reputation as a 
blues singer, Williams' was most satisfying while performing ballads, which he 
delivered with warmth and conviction. His reading of Thad Jones' "A Child Is 
Born" was particularly moving, accented by Shearing's hushed, minor-key lullaby 
that closed the tune. 
</P>
<P>
Pass' inclusion on the last few numbers almost seemed an afterthought. Nearly 
inaudible when providing accompaniment, the guitarist stepped out for short, 
slippery improvs before disappearing back into the mix. The three men closed 
with a tune from Williams' Basie days, "The Comeback," which the singer 
dedicated to those serving overseas. Pass, Shearing and Williams will appear 
Sunday at UCLA's Royce Hall.

SOUTHWEST CHAMBER PROGRAM;

UNUSUAL INSTRUMENTAL COMBINATIONS DOMINATE A REFRESHINGLY ECLECTIC PROGRAM IN 
CHAPMAN COLLEGE'S SALMON RECITAL HALL.

<P>
The Southwest Chamber Music Society apparently doesn't want to know about the 
word routine. That was the impression left by its refreshingly eclectic program 
Thursday night in Chapman College's Salmon Recital Hall (and repeated Friday at 
the Pasadena Library). 
</P>
<P>
Unusual instrumental combinations dominated this outing, beginning with Max 
Reger's delightful Serenade for flute, violin and viola, Opus 141a, a dashing, 
rambunctious, richly harmonized piece that ought to be better known. Flutist 
Dorothy Stone, violinist Peter Marsh and violist Jan Karlin checked in with a 
rough yet lively reading that often tumbled headlong through Reger's difficult 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
Next were two demonstrations of sheer compositional genius with a minimum of 
means in Benjamin Britten's quirky, humorous, sometimes self-absorbed "Six 
Metamorphoses After Ovid" for solo oboe, and the amazing contrapuntal interplay 
within Mozart's Duo for violin and viola, K. 424. Oboist Stuart Horn displayed 
a firm, liquid, legato tone in Britten's soliloquy, and he was undaunted by a 
beeper that went off in the audience in the middle of the piece. In the Mozart, 
played by Marsh and Karlin, one could almost overlook Marsh's frequent lapses 
in intonation, for the two were carrying on a joyous musical dialogue where 
feeling triumphed over technical shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast with Britten's inventiveness with solo winds, Alexander Goehr's 
Paraphrase on Claudio Monteverdi's "Il Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda" 
for clarinet was a typically loose-jointed, rambling exercise that quickly 
exhausted one's patience. Clarinetist Michael Grego ably coped with its angular 
writing, frequent pauses and fashionable tapping of the keys. 
</P>
<P>
But Goehr's arid landscape was quickly washed away by Prokofiev's wonderfully 
savage Quintet in G minor, a product of the early 1920s that reminds the 
listener of the acidic Second Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
With its odd instrumental lineup (oboe, clarinet, violin, viola, bass), 
abrasive drones and lurching rhythms, the piece can't help but summon images of 
Stravinsky peering over Prokofiev's shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Here, double bassist Paul Zibits joined Marsh, Karlin, Horn and Grego in a 
zesty performance made all the more effective by its rough edges.

WORKSHOP TIPS FOR EMULATING OLD PROS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Do It Yourself 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Follow an old pro around the workshop and discover lots of time-saving, 
hassle-reducing tips. 
</P>
<P>
Here are three techniques to simplify drilling holes for shelf pegs, staining 
lath and cutting dadoes for set-in shelves. 
</P>
<P>
There are lots of ways to install shelves in a bookcase. If using purchased pin 
clips to hold the shelves in place, here's a tip to simplify the job. Use a 
piece of perforated hardboard -- the type with 1/4-inch-diameter holes -- to 
ensure accurate spacing without a lot of measuring. 
</P>
<P>
To begin, determine the placement of the pin clips on the bookcase sides. 
Measure the desired distance of the pin clips from the edges of the bookcase; 
position the holes about one inch in from the front and back edges of the 
bookcase sides. Trim the perforated hardboard to the width of the bookcase with 
a hole lining up the pin-clip location. (To avoid mix-ups, mark the top of the 
guide.) 
</P>
<P>
Wrap electrical tape around the drill bit; this allows the holes to be drilled 
at uniform depth because the tape stops the penetration of the bit. 
</P>
<P>
When finished boring holes in one side, move the template to the other side, 
making sure the template lines up with the first side. 
</P>
<P>
Lots of outdoor projects call for lattice. When constructing lattice from 
strips of lath, take care to preserve the lath. Lath is very thin, and even 
lath made from rot-resistant woods will deteriorate over time if not protected. 
</P>
<P>
If you choose to stain the lath, be aware that some inexpensive stains are 
nothing more than pigmented paint thinner. These will offer no protection for 
the wood. In fact, they can even dry it out, shortening its life. 
</P>
<P>
Staining or painting the lath is much easier before the latticework is 
assembled. The quickest way to do this is by dipping it. A length of galvanized 
gutter stopped at both ends makes an ideal dipping tank. Cut the gutter long 
enough to handle the longest pieces of lath. Hang the lath to dry over several 
layers of newspaper to catch any drips. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a simple trick to ensure that dado joints cut in the sides of the 
bookcase line up horizontally. 
</P>
<P>
Cut the sides of the bookshelf to size and suspend them over a pair of 
sawhorses; clamp the pieces together side by side using bar clamps. 
</P>
<P>
Measure and mark the location of the bottom shelf; clamp a straightedge the 
appropriate distance from one end. Draw two parallel lines that define the 
borders of the dado. (The dado should be slightly wider than the shelf edge.) 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that the saw kerf (the void created by a saw blade as it cuts) 
should run along the inside edges of the dado. With the saw unplugged, adjust 
the blade to the desired dado depth (one-third the thickness of the material). 
</P>
<P>
Plug in the saw and cut along the straightedge. 
</P>
<P>
Next, move the straightedge and make cuts along the other cutting line. Plow 
out remaining material by making additional passes with the saw. Pare down 
rough spots with a chisel. 
</P>
<P>
Repeat this process for each shelf location. Measure carefully to ensure the 
correct shelf placement.

MAINTENANCE; 
</P>
<P>
KEEPING THOSE GARBAGE CANS SPICK AND SPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reader's Digest 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Simple maintenance can keep your garbage cans in good repair, odor-free and 
safe from raids by dogs and raccoons. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some tips: 
</P>
<P>
You'll get longer wear from garbage cans if you keep them under cover and away 
from moisture in a shed or garage. This is true of both metal and plastic cans. 
</P>
<P>
To prevent odors, line the cans with plastic garbage bags and drain all garbage 
before throwing it into them. When full, the bags can be closed with a tie and 
easily lifted out for disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Wash out the cans frequently. Use a garden hose to blast out loose soil and 
trash remains. Then, using a broom, scrub the cans with an industrial-strength 
detergent, preferably one containing a disinfectant, or with hot sudsy water 
with a little chlorine bleach or ammonia added. (Caution: Do not mix both 
bleach and ammonia in the same solution.) Let the cans dry in the sun, or at 
least in fresh air. 
</P>
<P>
To keep metal garbage cans free from corrosion, coat their insides and 
undersides lightly with used motor oil. This will have to be reapplied 
occasionally. An application of asphalt roof cement, which can be purchased at 
building supply centers, will provide longer protection. 
</P>
<P>
To repair damaged cans: 
</P>
<P>
Patch small holes in metal cans with an epoxy-base mending compound, available 
from hardware stores. 
</P>
<P>
Repair larger holes with 20- to 24-gauge galvanized sheet steel, available from 
hardware and building supply stores. Fasten the patch in place with epoxy 
compound. 
</P>
<P>
You can also attach the patch with stainless steel pop rivets. Pop rivets are 
installed with a rivet gun that works somewhat like a stapler. Rivet guns are 
available at modest cost in hardware stores. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how to repair with rivets: Align the patch over the hole. Use a center 
punch to mark the rivet positions on the patch. Drill holes slightly larger 
than the pop rivet diameter going through both the patch and the can. Insert 
the long end of the rivet (the mandrel) in the gun and the rivet in the hole, 
holding the gun flush with the surface. Squeeze the handles to form the rivet 
head and break off the mandrel. 
</P>
<P>
Repair splits in plastic cans by sandwiching them between strips of aluminum 
roof flashing, available at building supply centers. Or, cut open and flatten a 
couple of aluminum beverage cans. Use aluminum pop rivets to fasten the patches 
in place. 
</P>
<P>
To deter animal raids, secure the lids to the can handles with elastic shock 
cords, with a hook at either end, available in varying lengths at auto supply 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
Fasten one end of the cord permanently to the can by drilling a hole in one of 
the handles and hooking one cord end through it. Crimp the hook closed with 
pliers. Then hook the free end to the other handle. 
</P>
<P>
Some plastic garbage cans have molded lid grips. Groove a rectangular block of 
wood, about the size of the grip, across its narrow width. Then, screw or bolt 
the block, groove side down, to the grip. Run a length of rope or a shock cord 
through the groove and fasten its ends to the can's handles.

BIEDERMEIER EXHIBIT SHOWS DECORATIVE ART; 
</P>
<P>
DISPLAY: CENTER OFFERS A LOOK AT FURNISHINGS FROM POST-NAPOLEONIC PERIOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTIE COSTANZO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the Decorative Arts Study Center in San Juan Capistrano, the focus is on the 
changing styles of furniture, residential architecture and home gardens. 
</P>
<P>
"What (it's) about is providing (people with) those tools to have the 
confidence and enthusiasm to stay home and create their own environment," says 
G. R. (Gep) Durenberger, volunteer director of the center. 
</P>
<P>
"Decorative art is defined as those items we use in our everyday existence, 
including everything we sit on, feed ourselves with and look at," Durenberger 
says. 
</P>
<P>
The center, across the street from the San Juan Capistrano Library, is housed 
in a unique complex of early California buildings and gardens. It opened in 
February, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Although the exhibits are fashioned by professional designers, they are not 
decorator showcases. 
</P>
<P>
"We try not to be decorators," Durenberger says. "We try not to be interpreters 
or edit what we're doing here. This is as authentically correct as we can make 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The current exhibit showing in the main building, "Biedermeier: Neo-Classicism 
in German and Austrian Domestic Design: 1815-1848," reflects the center's 
dedication to detail and authenticity in its examination of domestic 
architecture and furnishings of the post-Napoleonic era. 
</P>
<P>
The Biedermeier period is distinguished by its smaller-scale, unadorned 
furnishings made from local fruitwoods. 
</P>
<P>
After Napoleon's defeat, there was a conscious rejection of the ostentatious 
style of the French Empire. Massive, imposing furniture made from imported 
woods replete with gilding and complex designs were replaced with simple 
functional styles that emphasized comfort and function. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a style of living that emanated from the middle classes themselves 
rather than filtering down from the courts," Durenberger says. 
</P>
<P>
Even the name accents the bourgeoisie nature of the style: bieder, meaning 
honest and straight-forward combines with meier, a common German surname. 
</P>
<P>
One of the galleries exhibits the type of furniture that people revolted 
against, like the mercury gold on a bronze clock, and a gilded wood and silk 
fabric armchair. 
</P>
<P>
In another gallery is a display of a typical apartment living room decorated in 
the Biedermeier style. Design innovations of the time included draping windows 
with elaborate fabrics and hanging fabrics on the wall. A pair of oil 
portraits, a solid cherry wood settee, an inlaid fruitwood worktable and a 
porcelain pitcher painted with pink and blue flowers celebrate the value of 
hard work and the importance of home and family. 
</P>
<P>
Every Study Center exhibit includes a representative garden of the period on 
display. 
</P>
<P>
The Biedermeier garden was typically geometric and very colorful, mixing a 
variety of colors in a small area. The intimate Study Center garden re-creates 
the feeling of the period when small gardens were treasured possessions of the 
middle class. 
</P>
<P>
Adjacent to the garden is a tree-shaded courtyard with an old stone fountain. 
From here visitors can enter the gift shop to browse through an eclectic

DRYWALL PROJECT? SKILL WITH KNIVES IS THE KEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Popular Mechanics 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drywall -- also called wallboard, gypsum board or plasterboard -- is probably 
the most versatile and forgiving wall surface available today. 
</P>
<P>
Less expensive and easier to apply than plaster, it can be frustrating to work 
with in the finishing stages, as it requires some skill with at least three 
sizes of compound knives -- 3, 6 and 10 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Individual drywall panels, called boards, come in a common width of 4 feet, in 
lengths from 8 to 16 feet in 2-foot increments. Thickness starts at 1/4 inch 
and progresses by 1/8-inch increments to 3/4 inch. The most common size, by 
far, is 4 by 8 feet by 1/2 inch. 
</P>
<P>
Each board consists of a gypsum core covered with heavy paper on both sides. 
The ends are cut square exposing the core. The long edges have a tapered 
depression about 1 1/2 inches wide for the paper and joint compound that makes 
a seamless surface between panels. 
</P>
<P>
Start your installation with the ceiling, and install any electrical boxes or 
fixtures first. Cut matching holes before applying panel cement to the bottom 
of the joists with a caulking gun and raising the board. Adhesive makes a 
stronger bond and reduces the number of nails required. 
</P>
<P>
Make it easier to hold ceiling boards in place by tack-nailing a 40-inch-long 
2-by-4 to the wall about an inch below the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
Support one end of the ceiling panel on this cleat while you raise the other 
end and nail it in place. Then move the cleat for the next panel. Use 1 
5/8-inch-long drywall nails 8 inches apart around the perimeter and across the 
face of the board into every joist that's covered. Dimple, or slightly recess, 
the nail heads into the paper for future filling. 
</P>
<P>
The same methods cover the walls. 
</P>
<P>
Place panels horizontally so you won't have to apply joint tape while climbing 
a ladder. Remember to minimize butt joints with their taping bulges. Push the 
upper wallboards tight against the underside of the ceiling boards. This 
drastically reduces future cracking. If the ceilings are eight feet or lower, a 
second board around the perimeter of the room does the job, but higher ceilings 
in older homes take a third, partial board. 
</P>
<P>
Finish in four steps: apply joint compound, embed paper tape in it directly 
over the joint line, cover the tape with more compound and let it dry before 
skimming the joint with a final very thin layer of compound. There are probably 
as many ways of doing this as there are professional drywall installers, but 
for beginners, the three-knife method works well. 
</P>
<P>
Start compounding a tapered joint with the six-inch knife. Hold the knife at a 
30- to 45-degree angle to the joint, pressing the compound into the depression. 
Then wipe off the excess. 
</P>
<P>
Tear off a length of tape to cover the entire joint. Press it in place with 
your fingertips and then lightly smooth it in place with the three-inch knife. 
If you see a bubble under the tape when you finish there is too little compound 
in the joint. Fixing this is impossible. Remove the tape and start over. 
</P>
<P>
Once the tape is embedded, cover it with another layer of compound with the 
six-inch knife. Smooth the joint with the 10-incher. Let the joint dry for a 
day and then sand with 120-grit paper. 
</P>
<P>
Finish up by lightly sanding the whole job and applying a very thin skim coat 
of compound to each joint. Wait a day for it to dry, sand the whole job with 
180-grit paper and touch up imperfections before priming and painting.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If elected governor, Pete Wilson will have more than the usual reasons to 
accept telephone calls from the Newport Beach headquarters of the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
The caller may be his former mayoral press secretary and campaign manager: 
Larry Thomas, now the Irvine Co.'s vice president of corporate communications. 
</P>
<P>
It may be another former campaign manager: Jack Flanigan, now the Irvine Co.'s 
vice president of government relations. 
</P>
<P>
Or it may be his friend, Donald L. Bren, the billionaire owner of the Irvine 
Co. who last year hosted a Wilson fund-raiser in his home. 
</P>
<P>
All three are at the top of a company that is widely considered one of the most 
aggressive behind-the-scenes players in state government, where the single 
stroke of a governor's pen can lead to millions of dollars in benefits -- or 
costs -- to the company. And if Wilson is elected, some say, the company will 
have easy access to the state's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
"They will get -- I'm not sure I'd like to say preferential treatment -- but 
they get access," said a Republican fund-raiser, who asked not to be 
identified. "They will get their telephone calls to the governor returned on 
the first, rather than the fifth, try." 
</P>
<P>
Observed Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who has received contributions 
from and butted heads with the Irvine Co.: "I'd say the Irvine Co. is a major 
player in California politics. I think they're even bigger (if Wilson is 
elected), because there are personal relationships as well as political 
relationships." 
</P>
<P>
One of those relationships was underscored on Oct. 26, when the publicity-shy 
Bren played host and co-chairman of a $400,000 Republican Party breakfast 
fund-raiser at the Irvine Hyatt Hotel featuring President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the county that is going to put Pete Wilson into the corner office of 
the Capitol in Sacramento," Bren told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Co. spokesman Thomas, however, argued that any close political and 
personal ties to Wilson will not translate into special treatment from the 
governor's suite. 
</P>
<P>
"I can just tell you that the whole political playing field on which Pete has 
played for 20 years is strewn with people who have supported his candidacy but 
have found him to make judgments on individual issues that have disappointed 
them," said Thomas. "I've known Pete Wilson for years, and Pete is 
independent." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who readily acknowledges that Bren is a political supporter and "a 
friend," says the company's position on an issue won't be his guide as 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
"The test is: Is it coincident with or is it in opposition to the public 
interest? If it is in opposition, then it doesn't go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co.'s interests in Sacramento are proportionate to its size: It 
holds title to one-sixth of Orange County -- the largest private ownership in 
any major American metropolitan area. As owner of about 10,000 apartments, the 
company worked to kill legislation this year that would require landlords to 
pay interest on security deposits. When its development rights were threatened 
by a move to list two rare plants as as endangered plant species, the company 
persuaded the Fish and Game Commission to overrule its own staff and deny 
special protection for the flora. 
</P>
<P>
Records show that the Irvine Co. paid lobbyists more than $250,000 over the 
last two years to support or oppose 74 bills, 36 of which were signed into law. 
</P>
<P>
The company also gave at least $125,000 to an initiative sponsored by Gov. 
George Deukmejian that increased the gasoline sales tax by 9 cents a gallon to 
fund transportation projects and freeways. And perhaps its biggest coup was 
helping to convince a reluctant Legislature that southern Orange County needed 
three private toll roads, 50% of which would run through Irvine Co. land. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to lobbying, the company spends substantial sums on political 
races. Since 1987, records show, it has donated more than $2 million to a 
variety of local and state races. Although it is most closely aligned with the 
Republican Party, the firm has made a point to extend its largess to powerful 
Democrats such as Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
So far this year in the governor's race, the company and its officials have 
given at least $19,000 to the Wilson campaign. Those giving $1,000 include the 
company itself, Bren, Thomas and Senior Vice President Gary H. Hunt, public 
records show. Flanigan and his wife, Janet, each gave $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
Records also show a number of Irvine Co. board members and their spouses 
contributing to Wilson. They include Richard F. Alden and his wife, Marjorie; 
Orange County developer Donald M. Koll and his wife, Dorothy; William McFarland 
and his wife, Rose Marie; Raymond L. Watson; and Howard A. Marguleas and his 
wife, Ardith. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Bren served as intermediary in the Wilson campaign by hosting an 
$86,200 fund-raiser at his home late last year. And Flanigan has taken a 
month's vacation to help the Republican Party get out the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Two Irvine Co. board members and their families have given a total of $3,000 to 
the Feinstein campaign, records show. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever is the next governor . . . we just want to be in the position to 
advocate our position at the negotiating table when things are discussed," said 
Jim Barich, the Irvine Co.'s senior director of government relations. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said that he and other Irvine Co. executives with past ties to Wilson 
are supporting the Republican for personal reasons, and not because of their 
affiliation with the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
"These are people who have known Wilson long before they knew Donald Bren," 
Thomas said of himself and Flanigan in particular. "The fact that we are all 
here is not because we know Pete Wilson." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an old friend of Pete's and I'm a supporter of Pete's and an enthusiastic 
one . . . but my involvement in the support of his candidacy is unrelated to 
the Irvine Co." he said. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
TOP IRVINE CO. OFFICIALS WITH TIES TO WILSON AND HIS CAMPAIGN 
</P>
<P>
(Compiled by Times staff writer Ralph Frammolino) 
</P>
<P>
Donald L. Bren, 58, owner of 93% of the Irvine Co., first joined political 
forces with Pete Wilson in 1975, when Wilson was running for his second term as 
San Diego mayor. Wilson faced bitter opposition from local developers, who were 
angry at his forceful moves to impose controls on suburban sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
Bren dined with Wilson in San Diego one night during the campaign and offered 
his help, said one former Wilson aide who attended the meeting but declined to 
be identified. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the only developer in Southern California offering help," the former 
aide said. "I remember being impressed by the fact that he was stepping up and 
saying, 'You (Wilson) are on the right track with your philosophy of growth, 
that it has to be managed."' 
</P>
<P>
Bren also was among the inner circle of supporters who helped persuade Wilson 
to abandon his campaign for governor in 1982 and instead focus on a successful 
U.S. Senate race, an Irvine Co. spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gary H. Hunt, 41, the Irvine Co.'s senior vice president for strategic planning 
and corporate affairs, is a close friend of Wilson's general campaign manager, 
George Gorton. Their personal relationship goes back to the early 1970s, when 
both were young men living in Washington. At one point, Gorton said, when he 
was between residences, Hunt allowed him to stay at his home for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Gorton was working as national college director for President 
Richard M. Nixon's Committee to Reelect the President. Later, after Gorton was 
quoted in 1973 as saying he helped spy on radicals in 38 states, he was fired 
from his job at the Interior Department and banished from Republican politics 
by George Bush, then national party chairman. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, Hunt played a crucial role in getting Gorton's career back on 
track, giving him a favorable recommendation when Gorton was hired to be 
assistant finance director of the Republican State Central Committee. Gorton, 
credited with engineering Wilson's come-from-behind 1982 Senate victory, is 
considered one of the politician's closest advisers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jack Flanigan, 45, the Irvine Co.'s liaison with state and federal officials, 
got his start in state politics with Wilson. Party insiders say Flanigan is 
behind Bren's political involvement and makes fund-raising telephone calls on 
his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Then-Assemblyman Wilson hired Flanigan, then a San Diego college student, to be 
his first summer intern in Sacramento. Flanigan worked out of a small office in 
the top floor of the Capitol, answering phones and researching issues. 
</P>
<P>
Flanigan, a self-professed "political junkie," was serving a tour of duty in 
Vietnam when Wilson ran for San Diego mayor in 1971. But he had returned to 
California and finished law school just in time to help his former boss with 
the 1975 reelection campaign. He ran Wilson's unsuccessful 1978 gubernatorial 
bid. Four years later, he took a six-week leave from his job at the CORO 
Foundation in Los Angeles to travel around the state with Wilson during the 
politician's successful Senate campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Flanigan's younger brother, Terry, is Gov. George Deukmejian's appointment 
secretary, responsible for overseeing judicial selections. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Thomas, 43, the Irvine Co.'s vice president of corporate communications, 
first met Wilson while working as a political reporter for the San Diego Union. 
After Wilson was elected San Diego mayor in 1971, Thomas became his press 
secretary. He kept thepost until 1977 -- six years that were some of Wilson's 
most dynamic at City Hall, as he pushed controls on growth, construction of a 
trolley and redevelopment of San Diego's seedy downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas left the mayoral payroll to be press secretary for Wilson's ill-fated 
1978 gubernatorial campaign, during which he met Bren. After the campaign, 
Thomas left San Diego altogether for a private industry job with the Bechtel 
Corp. in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas returned to politics in 1982, when Gov. Deukmejian appointed him as 
gubernatorial press secretary. In 1986, he left state employment to run 
Deukmejian's successful reelection campaign. Then Thomas went to Washington to 
be press secretary for Vice President Bush. He kept that job for three months, 
then took his present job with the Irvine Co. in mid-1987.

TRIAL: THE GARDEN GROVE DRIVE-BY SHOOTING -- IN WHICH A TEEN-AGE RIVAL AND A

<P>
Two reputed Santa Ana gang members, convicted of murdering a teen-age rival and 
a 4-year-old bystander in the worst gang violence in county history, were 
ordered Friday to spend the rest of their lives in prison for a crime the judge 
called "inexcusable." 
</P>
<P>
Tensions ran high in the tightly guarded courtroom of Superior Court Judge 
Tulley H. Seymour as two dozen supporters of the defendants -- some wearing 
"Not Guilty" T-shirts -- shot occasional glances at their outnumbered rivals 
across the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
There, among the black-clad relatives of the two victims in the Sept. 16, 1989, 
shooting in Garden Grove, sat several key witnesses who had broken a 
longstanding "code of silence" among gangs and helped to prosecute Louis P. 
Valadez, 28, and Robert P. Figueroa, 21. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes after her son was sentenced, Isabel Figueroa of Santa Ana stormed out 
of her seat and, as she tried to push her way past police at the door, struck 
one officer in the shoulder. She was taken into custody for booking on a charge 
of assaulting a peace officer, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Court marshals and police were so worried about further confrontation that, 
after the sentencings, they separated the family and friends of the defendants 
from those of the victims and led them out of the building in shifts. 
</P>
<P>
Even then, one group yelled at the other as they drove away from the Harbor 
Courthouse on Jamboree Road. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Fernandez Sr., whose 4-year-old son was killed in a hail of gunfire in 
the attack, said outside the courtroom that hostilities among the rival 
factions "is gonna get worse right now -- because everyone's mad. But hopefully 
it'll blow away." 
</P>
<P>
His son, Frank Jr., was shot to death as he sat with the family in their car on 
La Bonita Avenue in Garden Grove, waiting to go to the movies. Police said 
several young men in a pickup truck drove slowly past the area where they were 
parked as another group of people stood nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Men in the truck then opened fire with semiautomatic rifles, killing Frank Jr. 
and17-year-old Miguel (Smokey) Navarro. A 17th Street gang member, Navarro may 
have been a target of the drive-by shooting, which was spurred by an earlier 
attack in 5th Street gang territory, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Six other people were wounded in the gunfire, including Frank Jr.'s 2-year-old 
brother and a man whose left leg had to be amputated. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Seymour sentenced a third man convicted in the attack to 25 years to 
life in prison. The judge said Friday that he wanted to give Roman Gabriel 
Menchaca, 20, an even tougher sentence but could not because the jury convicted 
him only of conspiracy and split over a murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth defendant in the case, a 15-year-old gang member, is to be sentenced 
next Friday in juvenile court. He is expected to be sent away to the California 
Youth Authority until he turns 25. Authorities allege that the minor and 
Menchaca, in the back of the pickup, were the shooters. 
</P>
<P>
The sentencing next week will close out a case that stirred fears of rising 
gang warfare in Santa Ana, Garden Grove and elsewhere in the county because of 
the brutality and disregard for bystanders. 
</P>
<P>
In delivering the sentence, Seymour said he was sending a "message" to the 
community as well as seeking to execute justice. "This is a real pivotal case 
as far as this county is concerned," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Avdeef echoed that theme, telling the judge that he 
must send a signal to gang members that their crimes will be dealt with sternly 
in the judicial system. "That's the way you educate the gang members," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Valadez nor Figueroa is alleged to have been a shooter in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say Valadez, who had served time in state prison for assault and 
was on parole at the time of the crime, was the "leader" and mastermind of the 
assault and drove the truck. 
</P>
<P>
Figueroa, they say, rode in the passenger seat and set the stage for the 
killings the day before by warning rival gang members that he was going to pay 
their friends "a visit." 
</P>
<P>
In ordering the two defendants to each spend life in prison without the 
possibility of parole, Seymour pointed to the multiple victims in the 
shootings, their use of a minor and the "planning and sophistication" of the 
attack, showing premeditation. 
</P>
<P>
David A. Zimmerman, attorney for Valadez, delivered a virulent attack on the 
credibility of the young women who had placed the defendants at the scene. 
Calling their testimony "lies," he said: "(Valadez) goes to prison forever for 
that! I don't think that's a fair trial." 
</P>
<P>
Isabel Figueroa also attacked the justice system, saying the judge and the jury 
were "prejudiced" against her son. "He never got a chance to prove that he was 
innocent," she said in an emotional address to the court. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour not only rejected their appeals for leniency but also ordered the 
defendants to each pay $10,000 in restitution to the families of the victims. 
Valadez sat stone-faced as the sentence was delivered, but Figueroa strained 
through his handcuffs to wipe tears from his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmerman showed his frustration with the sentence when Seymour asked him how 
many days his client had already served in jail, to be credited against his 
life sentence. Caustically, the defense attorney answered, "It's hard to 
believe anything could be more academic, judge."

$1 MILLION RAISED FOR MEASURE M'S COFFERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Supporters of a half-cent sales tax for transportation have crossed the 
$1-million mark in fund raising with just four days left until Orange County 
voters decide the fate of the hotly contested measure, according to campaign 
reports filed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The last-minute additions to Measure M's campaign coffers were highlighted by a 
$200,000 loan secured by the Irvine Co. and Disneyland. Those two companies 
backed an earlier $250,000 loan to the campaign, and their latest loans -- 
combined with several other gifts and in-kind contributions from other 
organizations -- bring the group's total war chest to about $1.14 million. 
</P>
<P>
Reed Royalty, who chairs the Yes on Revised Measure M campaign, said the 
contributions and loans will allow supporters of the sales tax to step up their 
"education efforts," in the campaign's final days. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing mailings and telephone calling, and we'll keep doing it right up 
until the end," said Royalty, area vice president for Pacific Bell. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's election will mark the third time that Orange County voters have 
considered a sales tax to pay for transportation improvements. A nearly 
identical transportation tax, also called Measure M, was defeated by county 
voters last November, 53% to 47%. 
</P>
<P>
But while Royalty and other backers of this year's Measure M predict that their 
ample campaign coffers will help strengthen support for the proposal down the 
home stretch this time, opponents of the measure remain confident. 
</P>
<P>
"Their polls and their consultants have led them to believe that if they spend 
more money, they'll win," said Tom Rogers, a slow-growth advocate from San Juan 
Capistrano and a leader of the anti-Measure M campaign. "I just don't believe 
that's true." 
</P>
<P>
Support for the measure has remained mixed in recent polls. A late October 
Times Orange County Poll found 47% supported the measure, compared to 37% who 
opposed it. When respondents were told of specific projects that the proposed 
tax would pay for, support increased to 58%. JIM NEWTON

QUADRUPLETS BRING IDENTITY CRISIS HOME 
</P>

<P>
Life can get pretty confusing when there are four tiny quadruplets to take care 
of -- and three of them are genetically identical girls. 
</P>
<P>
Asked at a press conference Friday to identify the four 7-week-olds lying 
quietly in two matching strollers made for twins, Consolacion (Solly) Amante, 
28, the quadruplets' mother, wasn't sure who was who, without undressing them. 
"They have birthmarks in different places," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy was easy to identify -- he was the one in blue. But throughout the 
picture-taking session, the parents had problems telling Jacqueline, Jessamine 
and Jeraldine apart. 
</P>
<P>
"Last night, I put them in the wrong cribs," confessed their mother. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for Friday's press conference was the quadruplets' first well-baby 
checkup at FHP medical offices in Fountain Valley. Although the babies were 
born at UCI Medical Center in Orange, the premature quads were transferred 
several days later to the neonatal intensive care unit at FHP Hospital in 
Fountain Valley, where the parents are members of a health plan. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy, the first to be born on Sept. 12, also was the first to go home to San 
Bernardino. He was discharged Oct. 22, while sisters Jacqueline and Jessamine 
went home last Saturday and Jeraldine completed the set at home on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The infants' pediatrician, Dr. Naomi Uchiyama, proclaimed the four to be "doing 
wonderfully." 
</P>
<P>
All four have gained weight -- Jacqueline and Jeraldine weighed 5 pounds 
Friday; Jeremy 4 pounds, 14 ounces; and Jessamine 4 pounds, 12 ounces. Their 
weights at birth ranged from 3 pounds, 9 1/2 ounces (Jeremy) to 2 pounds, 12 
ounces (Jacqueline). The quadruplets were conceived without fertility 
treatment, which, according to doctors, occurs only about once in every 512,000 
births. 
</P>
<P>
The pediatrician also diagnosed the parents as "managing well," although 
Uchiyama said she counseled them to set aside time for themselves, as well as 
pay special attention to their other children, 4-year-old Jonathan and 1 
1/2-year-old Jane. While Jonathan wants to help and is especially thrilled by 
his baby brother, Jane is reluctant to give up her position as the baby of the 
family, said father Oscar Amante, 30. 
</P>
<P>
Life is hectic with six small children under the roof, especially when four of 
them want to be fed every two to four hours, the parents said. They go through 
32 bottles every day. 
</P>
<P>
Helping the parents are Solly Amante's mother and grandmother, who live just a 
short distance away. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I'd never have time to eat and that I'd never get any sleep," Solly 
Amante said. "But I'm getting six hours of sleep a day."MARCIDA DODSON

MAYORAL CANDIDATES SEEK DOUBLE VOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the barrage of mailers going out to Anaheim residents in these last days 
before Tuesday's election there's an added plea from the two mayoral 
candidates: Don't just vote once, vote twice. 
</P>
<P>
"Vote TWICE for Fred Hunter on Nov. 6," read Hunter's ads, with two squares 
marked, one for mayor and one for City Council. 
</P>
<P>
"Elect for Mayor, Irv Pickler, Re-elect for City Council, Irv Pickler," 
declares another campaign mailer, with two examples of two sample ballot boxes 
checked. 
</P>
<P>
Under Anaheim's election laws, the mayor must be a member of the City Council. 
Hunter's and Pickler's council terms expire this year. 
</P>
<P>
For voters who want to support one of those candidates for mayor, they need to 
mark the ballot twice for the same candidate -- once for the candidate's 
council seat and once for the mayor's seat. 
</P>
<P>
But what happens if one candidate wins the mayoral contest but fails to win a 
council seat? 
</P>
<P>
"If the person who receives the highest amount of votes for mayor is not 
elected to a City Council position, the mayoral election is declared a nullity, 
and the City Council would then appoint a mayor," said City Atty. Jack L. 
White. 
</P>
<P>
White said that situation has never arisen in past elections, and that voters 
seem to have a grasp of the complex ballot.LISA MASCARO

COUNCIL AGREES TO LET WOMAN KEEP 3 HORSES

<P>
At the far end of Gay Street, past the chickens and just across the road from 
costly two-story homes, lives Gail Simonz. 
</P>
<P>
She, like several of her neighbors, was drawn to her secluded lot now in the 
northern tip of Cypress because it was one of the few places left that allowed 
farm animals. 
</P>
<P>
But since establishing the Silver Spur Hoss Motel more than 13 year ago, Simonz 
has been engaged in a constant battle to stave off developers who want her out. 
This week, she is finally claiming victory. 
</P>
<P>
In a unanimous decision, the City Council agreed to allow Simonz -- and the 
three horses she loves -- to stay. "The city told me they wanted to protect the 
animal lovers," said Simonz. "And they did protect them. I am very happy." 
</P>
<P>
Gay Street, which is located off Crescent Avenue near Denni Street and the 
Southern Pacific Railroad, was annexed by the city in 1988. At that time, it 
was an unincorporated area of Orange County and zoned for agriculture. As many 
as 200 horses once lived on the block, along with an assortment of chickens, 
rabbits and dogs. 
</P>
<P>
When the city took over the area, it extended special consideration for the 
animals. But harboring animals was considered a "nonconforming" use of property 
that the city intended to eventually phase out. 
</P>
<P>
Today, only a handful of livestock owners are left. Many of the ranchers have 
sold their property and gone inland to such areas as Chino, where it is cheaper 
to raise livestock and avoid urban encroachment. 
</P>
<P>
But Simonz, who came in 1977, is entrenched. A large landscaped archway 
welcomes visitors to her mini-ranch, where she houses her three horses -- Joe, 
Ruby and Lacee. Simonz has a county license to board horses but says she does 
so only occasionally for a friend. "They are my hobby," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
A vacant lot behind her property -- once home to an Arabian horse ranch -- has 
been eyed by several developers. 
</P>
<P>
But her latest battle involved a 12-unit housing development. The proposal 
called for the homes to be built on the edge of her property line, only 10 feet 
from the yellow barn and the riding arena. 
</P>
<P>
According to city codes, livestock must be kept at least 50 feet from a 
residential area. "If there is a complaint and the council declared (the 
livestock) a public nuisance, they would have to be removed," City Atty. Jerry 
M. Patterson told the council. 
</P>
<P>
Still feeling reverberations from an unpopular decision to remove rabbits from 
a nearby park, the council sided with the animals. "I would like to condition 
it so somehow (Simonz's) property is protected," said Councilwoman Margaret M. 
Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
The council decided to allow the development but promised at a later meeting to 
provide a variance stipulating that the horses can be closer than 50 feet to 
the residential area. 
</P>
<P>
The project's developers have also agreed to work with their equine neighbors 
to accommodate their special needs. "We are trying to do everything we can," 
said Larry Johnson, one of the developers. "(Simonz) takes very good care of 
her property. We will take the horses into consideration." 
</P>
<P>
Simonz has requested that the homes be limited to one story because the horses 
don't like having objects over their heads. In return, she has promised to keep 
the stable area as clean as possible. A special air-cleaning device has been 
installed to deter odor and flies. To maintain her license with the county, she 
also must pass an inspection every year. LYNDA NATALI

BP OFFERS $431,653 SETTLEMENT FOR SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER

<TEXT>
<P>
City Atty. Gail C. Hutton is scheduled Monday to ask the City Council to accept 
a $431,653 payment from British Petroleum as the city's full reimbursement for 
cleanup costs from the worst oil spill in county history. 
</P>
<P>
The city, however, will continue pursuing efforts to recover compensation for 
damage allegedly caused by the disaster, including losses to wildlife and lost 
tourist revenue, according to a report from Hutton released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed settlement with British Petroleum, which owned the spilled oil and 
has assumed financial responsibility for the Feb. 7 incident, is considerably 
less than the $526,959 sought by city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Hutton is recommending the council waive $87,827 of its claim. 
</P>
<P>
British Petroleum policy states that the firm does not reimburse overhead 
charges in oil spill claims, which the city would agree not to challenge under 
the proposal, Deputy City Administrator Richard Barnard said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The only other way the city could attempt to recover those costs would be to 
file a potentially costly lawsuit, according to Hutton's recommended 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, British Petroleum acknowledges no responsibility for the 
incident, in which nearly 400,000 gallons of crude were spilled about 1 1/2 
miles offshore by the tanker American Trader, blackening beaches and killing 
scores of birds and other wildlife. The tanker, while mooring in shallow 
waters, apparently punctured its hull on its own anchor. 
</P>
<P>
If the proposed settlement is accepted, the city would authorize the firm to 
seek damages from others believed to share the blame for the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have not said what other firms or agencies BP might ask to pay part 
of bill for damages. However, a U.S. Coast Guard study released earlier this 
year concluded that Golden West Refineries, which runs the offshore mooring 
operation, was partly responsible. 
</P>
<P>
British Petroleum has already paid the city $250,000 toward reimbursement of 
city costs for supplies, equipment and manpower used during the cleanup effort. 
Upon council approval of the proposed agreement, the firm would pay the city 
$181,653 to complete the settlement.JOHN PENNER

PETITION DRIVE BY MOLA SUPPORTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNON SANDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents fighting on behalf of Mola Development Corp.'s controversial plan to 
build 335 houses on the Hellman Ranch property will begin circulating petitions 
this weekend to place the issue before the voters. 
</P>
<P>
While the Wetlands Restoration Society has fought Mola's plans to build the 
project, those who support the development say it will provide the city with 
41.4 acres of environmentally valuable wetlands, will preserve and restore Gum 
Grove Park and provide a new community park. 
</P>
<P>
The new group, called Seal Beach Citizens for Parks, Open Space and Responsible 
Government, includes Mayor Edna Wilson, Councilman Joe Hunt, seven former 
mayors and more than 50 other residents. 
</P>
<P>
If group leaders collect signatures from 15% of registered voters, or about 
2,700 people, the council then has the option of approving the measure or 
calling a special election to decide the question. 
</P>
<P>
The city's original approval of the project last October was rescinded by an 
Orange County Superior Court commissioner because Seal Beach's state-required 
housing plan was out of date when the council approved the Mola project. Though 
the new housing plan has since been declared valid, a new City Council voted to 
reject the proposal and Mola, which is helping to fund the petition drive, has 
sued the city over its action. SHANNON SANDS

Orange County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder was standing outside Ralphs Market, 
vying with the prison ministry outreach worker for the attention of an elderly 
couple who had just finished their shopping. 
</P>
<P>
"Fight crime and drug abuse! Dollar donation! God bless you!" the former drug 
addict-turned evangelical said in rapid-fire fashion. The couple, Sid and Leah 
Katz, walked by looking a little befuddled. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder had more success with them. They graciously accepted her offer of a 
scratch pad and campaign brochure. 
</P>
<P>
"I know who you are -- you helped us once," Leah Katz said. "I can't remember 
exactly what it was, but whatever it was, you got us the information we 
needed." 
</P>
<P>
So it went for Wieder on Friday, as she campaigned at the same supermarket 
where she handed out packages of flower seeds 16 years ago when she ran for 
Huntington Beach City Council. Some shoppers sped by without a pause, perhaps 
confused by the one-two punch of the evangelist and the politician. 
</P>
<P>
Others stopped to chat with an old friend, and promised Wieder that she had 
their vote. 
</P>
<P>
With just one frenetic weekend of campaigning left before voters decide the 
fate of the embattled supervisor, most political observers in the county think 
that Wieder has made enough friends and built up enough political capital in 
her district to carry her to victory over Westminster Councilwoman Joy L. 
Neugebauer. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder was forced into a runoff when she finished with 47% of the vote in June, 
far ahead of Neugebauer, who had 20%, and three other candidates. Those 
candidates have thrown their support behind Neugebauer, but so far Wieder has 
come through the campaign with no major gaffes and still appears to be in 
command. 
</P>
<P>
Neugebauer, who has served on the council for 18 years, has run a low-profile 
campaign, relying on volunteers, a single districtwide mailer and the same 
homespun style that wins her blue ribbons in the jam contests at the Orange 
County Fair. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder has pumped out issue-oriented mail pieces targeted at different voting 
groups within the district. She has tried to focus on her accomplishments 
during her 12 years on the Board of Supervisors, and, by Tuesday, she will have 
outspent Neugebauer by more than 12 to 1, including $33,000 just for polling 
data -- more than Neugebauer's entire campaign budget. 
</P>
<P>
To guide her to a fourth term on the board, Wieder hired Los Angeles political 
consultant Allan Hoffenblum, who two years ago ran the successful campaign of 
her opponent for a congressional seat, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach). 
Rohrabacher severely damaged Wieder's political career that year when he 
revealed that the supervisor had claimed a college degree from Wayne State 
University that she had never earned. Wieder's campaign never recovered and 
Rohrabacher won the seat. 
</P>
<P>
Political consultant Harvey Englander, who has worked for Wieder in past 
campaigns, said his former client is in good hands. 
</P>
<P>
"She's got a first-class consultant, and I know he's doing everything possible 
to get her record and message out to the voters," Englander said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how Harriett can lose," said former supervisor Bruce Nestande, a 
Wieder supporter. "She's served the people there well, and she doesn't really 
leave the opposition with an issue of any substance they can use. There are 
some issues of embarrassment, but there's nothing that goes to the issue of 
office or job performance." 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach City Councilman John Erskine, a strong Wieder supporter, said 
he didn't think Neugebauer would be able to capitalize on some of the criticism 
leveled against the supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
"I think her own style issues have attracted some of the (negative) press," 
said Erskine, "and that's the only reason why Neugebauer is remotely viable. 
She (Neugebauer) hasn't made a dent among her colleagues in the League of 
Cities or the surrounding cities." 
</P>
<P>
But there are also those who think the race will be closer than it looks on 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until a couple of weeks ago I thought Harriett would win easily," said 
Westminster Councilwoman Lyn Gillespie, who endorsed Wieder before Neugebauer 
entered the race but now is trying to stay neutral. "Maybe it's just intuition 
-- I can't put my finger on it -- but Joy's going to be a much stronger 
contender than people think. I think she has a good chance of pulling it off." 
</P>
<P>
Wieder's enormous advantage in fund raising, Gillespie said, is deceptive. 
"People talk about the money Joy's raised, but that is Joy's traditional 
strategy," Gillespie said. "She's pulled off a lot of races in Westminster with 
very little money." 
</P>
<P>
Both of the candidates are confident of winning. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be a comfortable victory," said Wieder, adding that her 
campaign has gone swimmingly "exclusive of the media." Wieder has complained 
repeatedly that coverage of the race has been slanted in favor of Neugebauer. 
She was particularly upset about a Times Orange County Edition story noting 
that she has missed more meetings and abstained from more votes than any of her 
board colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Neugebauer reprinted part of an article about her opponent's attendance record 
in a campaign piece sent to district voters. 
</P>
<P>
"You've given her copy that cost me money," Wieder said. "It's easy to attack, 
but I've got a good track record. . . . I've been a hard-working supervisor, 
and people have been responsive to the campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Neugebauer said she too has received good responses to her mailer, her phone 
calls and neighborly approach to the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who support me are the people who live next door, who go to church, 
who I know from organizations in the community," Neugebauer said. "I think 
there are enough of them to win."

GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like watching a classic old movie where everybody knows the lines by heart, 
Orange County Republicans gathered around former President Ronald Reagan on 
Friday and basked in the glow of another campaign finale. 
</P>
<P>
"Can I ask one favor of you?" Reagan finally said to a crowd already 
anticipating the next sentence. "Let's go out and win this one for the Gipper." 
</P>
<P>
This time Reagan was referring to Garden Grove's freshman Assemblyman Curt 
Pringle, who is locked in California's most hotly contested legislative race 
against his Democratic challenger, Tom Umberg. 
</P>
<P>
Before joining the audience of about 400 people at the Hyatt Alicante, Reagan 
jumped into a Republican phone bank and made three telephone calls to urge 
surprised voters to support Pringle in Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
One call was to 71-year-old Minnie Ledesma of Newport Beach, whom Reagan 
encouraged to vote for Pringle -- even though she doesn't live in the 
assemblyman's 72nd District. 
</P>
<P>
Ledesma said she wasn't quite sure it was really the former President on the 
telephone. "At first, I thought it was a tape or something," she said. "His 
voice just sounded the same as always, a little slower, maybe. I asked him for 
his wife, Nancy, because I wanted to be sure it was President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
"He said for a couple of days she's had something in her throat, and she 
couldn't talk. Then he said, 'I don't like it when she doesn't talk.' 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'You're the first man I've ever heard who misses his wife talking.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ledesma added that Reagan "wasn't pushy or anything, he was a gentleman." 
</P>
<P>
She said he encouraged her to vote, but never suggested which party to support, 
so she never told him she is a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech about the downfall of communism and the high-spending Democrats, 
Reagan barely referred to Pringle. 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) warmed up the audience, saying, 
"Curt Pringle is in the fight of his life, and that is why President Reagan is 
down here: to help Curt Pringle." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan's visit was the first event of a four-day campaign swing through 
Southern California that will include stops today in the Inland Empire, Sunday 
in San Diego and a final visit to Orange County on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The former President's mission is to rally Republican troops. To convey that 
message he once again recalled one of his favorite quotes: "Will Rogers once 
said the people we send to office are no better than those who send them. But 
they're all better than those who don't vote." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan talked about his recent visit to Moscow, where he saw lines outside a 
McDonald's outlet. Asking one man why he was standing in line, Reagan said he 
was told, "It's the only glimpse we can get of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
"You might be interested to know how much people in Moscow go out of their way 
to say how much they want to be like us," said Reagan, wearing a black suit and 
tie after appearing Friday morning at the funeral for William French Smith, who 
was U.S. attorney general in the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Dornan, Reagan was joined on stage by Reps. Christopher Cox 
(R-Newport Beach) and Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach). Other Republican 
candidates included State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who is 
running for lieutenant governor; Orange County Dist. Atty. Michael Capizzi, and 
State Sen. Edward R. Royce (R-Anaheim).

LATINOS UPSET BY CARTOON IN COLLEGE PAPER

A cartoon published in the Lariat, a student-run newspaper at Saddleback 
College, Friday was denounced by Latino students and a faculty member as racist 
and offensive. 
</P>
<P>
The cartoon, drawn by Saddleback student Clint Bond, depicted five Mexican 
nationals crossing Interstate 5 in a crosswalk marked "Illegal Alien Crossing." 
On the other side of the freeway is a brick wall marked by graffiti and a sign 
saying "No Green Card Needed" and "Welcome to America." 
</P>
<P>
The cartoon, published last week, was drawn in reference to recent incidents 
involving undocumented workers who were struck by vehicles as they dashed 
across the freeway while attempting to evade the Border Patrol checkpoint south 
of San Clemente. Several have died. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time within a year that the Lariat had drawn fire for 
publishing cartoons that some ethnic groups labeled insensitive. Last December, 
the Larait drew criticism from Jewish students and community leaders for a 
cartoon and editorial it published titled "Happy Holocaust." 
</P>
<P>
Lariat editors eventually issued a formal apology to the community. 
</P>
<P>
"The border-crossing cartoon was confusing in the point it was trying to make 
and made light of a very tragic and complicated issue," said Juanita Baltierra, 
a Saddleback College counselor and adviser to the Student Organization of 
Latinos. "It presented an image of Latinos that we consider derogatory. I found 
it insulting and racist, and so did many of the students." 
</P>
<P>
Lariat Editor Alex Murashko said the cartoon was not meant to offend Latinos. 
"We were trying to call attention to the problem on the freeway near the 
checkpoint and some of the Latino students thought the cartoon was making fun. 
We met with them and are going to publish their letters in the next edition." 
Bond, the cartoonist, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Gustavo Flores, a photographer on the Lariat staff, said he was offended by the 
cartoon and felt that, as a Latino, he should have been asked for his opinion 
before the cartoon was published. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a joke," he said. "Families and little children have been hit 
crossing the freeway. These are real lives and you just can't make fun of their 
deaths."

STUDENTS PROTEST PROPOSED SITE OF UNIVERSITY HOUSE

UC Irvine's graduate student leaders have passed a resolution demanding that a 
planned chancellor's residence be built somewhere other than a four-acre 
plateau that biology professors regard as the most environmentally sensitive 
area on campus. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, passed unanimously Thursday night by the Associated Graduate 
Students of UCI, also asks the university to conduct an environmental impact 
study of the project. 
</P>
<P>
"We took this action because the university has plans to build the University 
House in an area of our campus that is the habitat for a very rare bird," said 
Kevin Kandalaft, president of the graduate students' council. "We see it as 
needless destruction of that habitat when the house can just as easily be 
moved." 
</P>
<P>
University House, the chancellor's official residence as well as an 
entertainment facility and guest quarters, is scheduled for construction on a 
hilltop near the southern edge of campus. The university already has launched a 
drive to raise $3 million in donations for the 13,500-square foot building, 
which would have a panoramic view of the campus, Upper Newport Bay, Newport 
Beach and the ocean beyond. 
</P>
<P>
But the hilltop is also one of the last and best stands of coastal sage scrub 
on campus, and it is home to about half a dozen nesting California 
gnatcatchers. The small darting bird is disappearing so rapidly throughout its 
coastal range that federal wildlife officials are studying it for possible 
emergency listing as an endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
The plateau is also home to a very rare spring-blooming plant known as Dudleya 
multicaulis, and to nesting cactus wrens, another increasingly uncommon bird 
that once was abundant throughout much of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
A recent university-commissioned survey of the hilltop determined some measures 
could be taken to ensure survival of the rare plant and the cactus wrens if the 
University House is built. But it concluded that construction would have 
"unavoidable adverse impacts" on the gnatcatcher. 
</P>
<P>
However, university officials say they have a new design for the building and 
accompanying parking and picnic areas that would minimize the impact on the 
birds and the plant. 
</P>
<P>
They have said they will not consider moving the site, and they plan to break 
ground on the project in spring, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The graduate students said the council acted after campus biologists alerted 
them to the environmental issues. The students emphasized their support for a 
chancellor's house on campus.

AST TO INTRODUCE 2 SMALL COMPUTERS;

Personal computer maker AST Research Inc. said Friday it plans to introduce two 
notebook-sized computers that can be upgraded to suit a user's growing 
performance requirements. 
</P>
<P>
While AST is a late entrant to the crowded $2.1-billion laptop computer market, 
computer analysts said the machines have advanced features and will cost less 
than half the price of its nearest competitor. 
</P>
<P>
"When you've got an outstanding product with the right features and the right 
price, it's always the right time (to introduce it)," said James W. Ashbrook, 
AST senior vice president of worldwide marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the introduction will create more competition in an already 
crowded field. InfoCorp, a market research firm in Santa Clara, reports there 
are more than 20 companies that are either developing or selling notebook 
computers. The firm estimates sales of notebook machines, generally eight 
pounds or lighter, increased 231% in 1990 to 890,000 units, compared to 260,000 
a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"There's going to be a blood bath in the portable computer market, and AST has 
just made the first stab wound," said JoeAnn Stahel, president of 
Storeboard/Computer Intelligence Inc., a market research firm in Dallas. "They 
are serious." 
</P>
<P>
AST's less expensive model, the Premium Exec 286/12 with a 20-megabyte hard 
drive, is based on the Intel 80286 microprocessor and will sell for prices 
beginning at $2,495. The higher-end model, the Premium Exec 386SX/20 with a 
20-megabyte hard drive, is based on the Intel 80386SX microprocessor with 
prices beginning at $2,995. Both models weigh about 6.5 pounds and are small 
enough to fit in a briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
The 386SX model competes with the Compaq LTE 386 s/20, a 7.5-pound notebook 
computer introduced three weeks ago by Compaq Computer Corp. in Houston. The 
model has 30-megabyte hard drive and sells for prices starting at $6,500. 
Compaq officials said Friday their machine is more powerful than AST's and 
appropriately priced, but Ashbrook disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
The AST model also competes with a notebook computer introduced last week by 
Texas Instruments Inc. in Dallas. The 5.7-pound TravelMate 3000 computer is 
priced about $5,500. 
</P>
<P>
"On the surface, it (the AST model) looks like a very aggressively priced 
notebook," said Bruce Stephen, analyst at International Data Corp., a market 
research firm in Framingham, Mass. "AST is a known name and it has good 
distribution. It might do well." 
</P>
<P>
AST is aiming the product at business people on the run, such as traveling 
sales people, reporters, auditors, real estate and insurance field personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The computers feature paper-white VGA graphics and can be expanded for 
facsimile or modem options. They can operate on battery power for three hours, 
and the batteries can be replaced in a "suspend mode" without disrupting work 
on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other laptops on the market, the Premium Exec 286/12 model can be 
upgraded to the more powerful 386SX microprocessor for $499. AST will introduce 
the two machines formally at the Comdex computer trade show in Las Vegas on 
Nov. 12 and begin shipping them in December.

<P>
EECO Inc., a computer products manufacturer that filed for bankruptcy 
protection in May, said Friday that it has agreed to sell its hotel-computer 
manufacturing business to a Hong Kong investor group. 
</P>
<P>
EECO said Dataprep, a company headed by Hong Kong investor Fred Eu, will 
acquire its EECO Computer Inc. subsidiary in Santa Ana for an undisclosed 
price. Eu will serve as the company's chairman and Carl Jeremias will remain as 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremias said EECO Computer Inc. will retain its 92 employees. 
</P>
<P>
After the sale of the division, EECO would be left with its corporate 
headquarters here, a keyboard- and switch-manufacturing operation in Scotland 
and a keypad plant in Phoenix. Each of the manufacturing plants has about 100 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 1, EECO sold the assets of its Maxi-Switch Keyboard Division in Tucson, 
Ariz., to a Taiwanese investment company for an undisclosed price. 
</P>
<P>
Later that month, the company filed a reorganization plan in which it proposed 
to pay $11 million to its largest creditor, Sanwa Bank in Los Angeles. Of that, 
$7.5 million would be in cash and $3.5 million would be proceeds of a new loan. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the company also proposes to settle a $6.5-million debt to 
creditor Gary Beesom by giving him ownership of its Phoenix keypad plant, which 
it will then lease back, and to settle the remaining $9.5 million in debt by 
issuing common stock and a $1.1-million note to other unsecured creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Sale of the EECO Computer unit to Dataprep is expected to close in early 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Divestiture of the subsidiary will be a major step toward meeting a condition 
of EECO's proposed reorganization plan, said George B. DeHuff III, EECO 
chairman. "This generates cash for us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dataprep has been EECO's Asian market distributor since 1977 and has installed 
100 systems in 63 hotels throughout the Far East, including China, Jeremias 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The company will continue to be based in Santa Ana, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremias said he wants to expand the business with its focus on a new hotel 
computer-product line based on the Pick operating system and run on either IBM 
or Digital Equipment Corp. machines.

. . . But Traffic Down: More on the air transportation front: 
</P>
<P>
Because of the yearlong construction jumble at John Wayne Airport, passenger 
traffic for the first nine months of 1990 was down 3.2% from the same period in 
1989, and the number of takeoffs and landings by big passenger jets was down 
2.4%. 
</P>
<P>
In September, however, the passenger count increased 7.1%, to 383,003 from 
357,554 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The carriers are apparently packing more people on each plane, however, because 
their total operations for the month were up just 3%. 
</P>
<P>
The big business increase seems to be with the air taxi, or commuter airline, 
firms. They posted a 19% increase in flight operations in September and a 15.5% 
increase for the first nine months -- 24,967 takeoffs and landings versus 
21,610 for the first nine months of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
At United Express, the largest commuter carrier at the airport, the September 
passenger load shot to 10,859, up 50% from 7,234 in September, 1989, and more 
than double the 4,959 passengers carried in September, 1988.

CARE, SHAREHOLDER WILL DROP OPPOSING LAWSUITS; 
</P>
<P>
SETTLEMENT: THE 4-YEAR LEGAL FIGHT BETWEEN THE NURSING HOME OPERATOR AND RALPH 
E. HAZELBAKER ENDS.

<P>
A costly four-year legal battle between Care Enterprises Inc., the nursing home 
operator now emerging from bankruptcy, and dissident shareholder Ralph E. 
Hazelbaker ended Friday in what both sides called a welcome divorce. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the deal, each side will drop the lawsuits it has filed against the 
other, and Hazelbaker will surrender his 3% interest in Care by returning to 
the company 200,785 shares of its common stock without seeking payment. 
</P>
<P>
Although announced Friday, the settlement was approved Oct. 16 by the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles. As part of the move to completely sever ties 
with Tustin-based Care, Hazelbaker and his family partnerships sold their $40 
million worth of Care debentures on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
"We all wanted to sever the relationship," said Carl Fry, Hazelbaker's 
attorney. He said Hazelbaker was willing to turn in the Care stock because he 
"didn't think it was worth anything. We don't want an investment in Care 
Enterprises." 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Drumwright, Care's chief executive officer, called the settlement "a 
total divorce." 
</P>
<P>
The storm of litigation began when Care sued Hazelbaker in August, 1986, to 
stop him from terminating its contracts to manage two nursing homes his company 
owned. Hazelbaker retaliated by suing Care for alleged mismanagement of the 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
More than 20 suits and countersuits have been filed by Care and Hazelbaker 
since then, but none have gone to trial. The legal wrangling cost Care 
Enterprises "in excess of $1 million," said Drumwright. 
</P>
<P>
Hazelbaker sold Care his Americare nursing home operation in 1985. He later 
formed Paradigm Corp., a health care company in Columbus, Ohio, and retained 
Care to operate nine of Paradigm's nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
Care, founded in 1965, became one of the nation's 10 largest nursing home 
chains. 
</P>
<P>
But it sustained huge losses after a major expansion drive that concluded with 
its 1985 acquisition of Americare. 
</P>
<P>
Care filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition on March 28, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
A reorganization plan, calling for Care to emerge from bankruptcy court 
supervision by the end of the year, was approved in April. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement agreement between Hazelbaker and Care "resolves all the 
litigation and ongoing disputes," said Care's general counsel, Gary Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
He said Care also has renegotiated its leases of three nursing homes in 
Albuquerque, N.M., that are owned by Hazelbaker-led partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, Hazelbaker has agreed to pay Care $970,000 for 
maintenance of the facilities over the last four years.

ENGINEERING: TWO IRVINE RESEARCHERS ATTEMPT TO DEVELOP A LASER TO DETERMINE A 
STRUCTURE'S ABILITY TO TAKE A JOLT.

When a small earthquake rattled parts of Orange County two weeks ago, it did 
not damage the offices of Cecil F. Hess and James D. Trolinger. But the jolt -- 
which measured 4.0 on the Richter scale -- delivered an uncomfortable reminder 
of the urgency of their work. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time there's an earthquake it reminds me that we're very unprepared to 
deal with them and there is a lot of work for us to do," said Hess, co-founder 
and director of engineering at MetroLaser, a small Irvine start-up firm. 
</P>
<P>
The company is attempting to develop a laser that would help determine a 
structure's ability to withstand earthquakes, such as last year's collapse of 
Interstate 880 in Oakland during a major temblor. 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, the eight-employee firm recently won a $230,000 research grant 
from the National Science Foundation to investigate how laser-generated 
holograms can be used to determine structural stability. 
</P>
<P>
In a two-year study in conjunction with the civil engineering department at UC 
Irvine, Trolinger and Hess will attempt to determine if lasers can detect the 
points in any structure that are subject to the most stress from ground 
vibrations. 
</P>
<P>
The laser would take a hologram -- or three-dimensional image of a structure 
such as an office building -- by shining a laser beam on the object and 
capturing its reflected image on light-sensitive glass slides. 
</P>
<P>
A second hologram would capture the outline of the structure at another point 
in time, and the two holograms could be compared to measure the distance the 
structure has moved during the elapsed time. 
</P>
<P>
With the data from the holograms, civil engineers would then use computers to 
analyze where the most pressure is exerted on a building, find its structural 
flaws, calculate the point at which the structure might collapse during an 
earthquake, and measure damage after an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Hess said the laser technology can improve upon current test instruments known 
as accelerometers, vice-like devices that record the vibrations in a structure 
at a single point. 
</P>
<P>
While it would take many cumbersome accelerometers and months of work to 
capture all the stress points in a large structure such as a bridge, a laser 
hologram could theoretically detect the stress points throughout the bridge in 
a single instant, Hess said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, MetroLaser proved the basic tenets of the theory in a joint research 
project with civil engineers at UC Irvine. In that experiment, sponsored by the 
National Science Foundation under a $50,000 grant, Hess and Trolinger built a 
laser that recorded the effect of vibrations on a liquid storage tank. 
</P>
<P>
Trolinger said any equipment developed from the technology will probably be too 
expensive for individual homeowners to use to measure how earthquake-safe their 
homes are. It will most likely be used by civil engineers who must measure the 
safety of large structures, such as bridges, skyscrapers, hospitals or shopping 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Jones, general manager at San Juan Capistrano-based Endevco, a subsidiary 
of Allied Signal Corp. which makes accelerometers, said the laser technology 
sounds exciting, but he said there is still room for the current technology. 
</P>
<P>
"Accelerometers will still be used for measuring small objects," he said. "The 
technologies are not necessarily competing." 
</P>
<P>
It could be several years before MetroLaser markets a product, and it may be 
even longer before civil engineers can understand and interpret the data it 
produces. Its laser device, for example, may be able to identify weak spots on 
a bridge, but how the span should be reinforced and at what point it will 
collapse could take years to understand, Trolinger said. 
</P>
<P>
"The technology for taking the measurements has been demonstrated," Trolinger 
said. "But there's a big gap in understanding what the measurements mean. This 
research is still high-risk in terms of commercial value." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, MetroLaser has lined up agreements with several companies that may be 
interested in manufacturing a product based on the technology: GenRad Corp., a 
diagnostic instruments firm in Milpitas; Physical Research Inc., a 
military-oriented optical diagnostics firm in Torrance; and Newport Corp., an 
optical instruments manufacturer in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Galantowicz, president of Newport Corp., said his firm supports the 
direction of MetroLaser's research and will be interested in manufacturing the 
instruments if the research proves fruitful. 
</P>
<P>
Hess and Trolinger have searched to find commercial applications for holograms 
for more than two decades. Now that they believe they have found one, they are 
racing against time to perfect an instrument before the Big One strikes, the 
long-expected catastrophic earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"We're driven by the idea that we might actually save some lives with this 
device," Trolinger said. 
</P>
<P>
Illuminating Flaws With Laser Light 
</P>
<P>
Using holograms created by shining laser beams on an object, MetroLaser hopes 
to predict the eartquake safety of large structures such as a fuel storage 
tank.

TEMIRKANOV BRINGS UNIQUE STYLE TO CENTER; 
</P>
<P>
CONDUCTING: MOST ORCHESTRAS REVEAL EITHER ABSOLUTE DISCIPLINE OR A WILLINGNESS 
TO TAKE EMOTIONAL CHANCES. LENINGRAD PHILHARMONIC CONDUCTOR YURI TEMIRKANOV 
DEMANDS, AND GETS, BOTH.

Music is the art of time. And it usually takes time for any conductor, even an 
eccentric one, to establish an interpretation. A downbeat must be given, a 
tempo suggested, momentum established, guidelines set, so that the players get 
off together. It always takes a few bars. 
</P>
<P>
But Yuri Temirkanov had no use for an upbeat or any other of the preliminary 
conductorial niceties as he led off the first of four Leningrad Philharmonic 
programs in Carnegie Hall last week -- programs that will be repeated Sunday at 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center and later at the Los Angeles Music 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Conducting batonless, he simply lifted his right hand over his head, palm open 
and facing toward the ceiling, and like a magician pulling a sound unexpectedly 
out of a hat, he brought in the trumpet solo that begins Prokofiev's 
"Lieutenant Kije" Suite. 
</P>
<P>
The hand remained raised throughout the solo, undulating slightly to shape the 
phrase and seeming to encourage supple expression out of it. But there never 
was a beat, a tempo, even a real cue. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about his extraordinary podium technique a day after his Carnegie 
appearance, the conductor, relaxing in a borrowed Upper West Side apartment, 
put down his cigarette, got up from his sofa and began conducting the 
interviewer. First he beat out the "Kije" trumpet solo exactly, demonstrating 
how up-tight that can make a player and how it will likely constrict his sound. 
Then he showed the advantage of simply encouraging him to play and letting the 
music sing forth. 
</P>
<P>
"If you give him an order to play, he tightens up," Temirkanov explained 
through his interpreter. "But if you invite him, he is free. We've decided how 
it will be in rehearsal. So it is my job in performance to create the right 
mood." 
</P>
<P>
Temirkanov admits that he is sometimes accused of theatricality for such 
methods. But he defends that accusation by describing the conductor's job 
during performance as being akin to an actor's. He must create the atmosphere 
for both audience and the players. If there is humor, as there is in "Kije," 
then he finds it not just appropriate but necessary to clown around on the 
podium. But in Tchaikovsky's stormy "Manfred" Symphony, Temirkanov becomes the 
demented poet, egging the orchestra on to give its most Angst-ridden response. 
</P>
<P>
How the orchestra responds to such a conducting style is another matter. It is 
a musical approach that presupposes absolute orchestral discipline along with a 
willingness to take emotional chances. And orchestras are generally comfortable 
with one or the other of those approaches, but the Leningrad players seem 
unusual by excelling in both at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
The 51-year-old conductor from the Caucasus has been the music director of the 
Leningrad Philharmonic, the Soviet Union's most celebrated orchestra, for only 
two years. Temirkanov, whose irrepressible outspokenness often got him in 
trouble during more repressive times in the Soviet Union, claims that the 
orchestra was in shoddy condition when he took it over. He says that the 
legendary Evgeny Mravinsky, who headed the orchestra for exactly half a century 
up to his death in 1988, had, in his last years, become too old to sustain 
orchestral discipline but too authoritarian to share any of his control. 
</P>
<P>
So, Temirkanov notes, his first task was to rebuild the ensemble, which has 
meant replacing a number of players. Temirkanov has had to fight hard to 
improve living conditions for musicians, since his orchestra, like all Soviet 
orchestras, must contend with a constant drain of its best players attracted to 
the West. But then, Temirkanov, who is known as the bad boy of Russian 
conductors, has never accepted conditions he didn't think proper. 
</P>
<P>
He says that he is now free to conduct whatever he wants. "The old system has 
collapsed. There is no new system and there is complete freedom." But the old 
system never stopped him anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"I am proud to say that I never obeyed when something that I wanted to do was 
forbidden," he says, a big, red copy of "KGB: The Inside Story," sitting on his 
coffee table. "It was a risk for my career, but I always conducted what I 
wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, once I wanted to conduct Shostakovich's 'Jewish' cycle, and the 
performance was to be on the ninth of May, which is the day we celebrate 
victory over Germany in the Second World War. I was advised not to do it, and 
particularly not on that day. But I still did it and got away with it." 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, Temirkanov's challenge is more for continuing tradition than 
breaking with it. He has sought to maintain the famous Leningrad sound, 
Leningrad being long noted for the string players its conservatory produced 
with their full, rich tone. The conductor complains that international 
uniformity is creeping into the Russian musical soil just as it is everywhere 
else. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Temirkanov also says that it doesn't matter nearly as much where the 
players come from as what the conductor requires of them. Although the 
Leningrad Philharmonic well may be one of the last great orchestras that plays 
with real national personality, Temirkanov claims that his performances with it 
differ from those with the Western orchestras he regularly guest conducts only 
in that he and the players have come to know each other so well. 
</P>
<P>
That may be; Orange County and Los Angeles audiences will have a rare 
opportunity to judge for themselves. Not only is Temirkanov dividing four 
Leningrad Philharmonic programs, all devoted to Tchaikovsky and Prokofiev, with 
the orchestra's associate conductor, Mariss Jansons, but he will return to the 
Music Center next month for two programs with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Philharmonic Society presents Yuri Temirkanov conducting the 
Leningrad Philharmonic in a concert of works by Prokofiev and Tchaikovsky 
Sunday at 3 p.m. at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center 
Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $18 to $50. A free concert preview with Burton 
Karson, professor of music at Cal State Fullerton, begins at 1:45 p.m. at the

RIKK AGNEW'S COMEBACK VIA A CARTHARTIC ALBUM; 
</P>
<P>
PUNK ROCK: THE PUNKSTER SEES HIMSELF AS RECKLESS, BUT NOW IT'S A CONTROLLED 
RECKLESSNESS.

<P>
After more than a decade in punk rock, Rikk Agnew finally got around to 
cleaning out his musical attic. 
</P>
<P>
The new solo release by the former Adolescents and D.I. guitarist has both a 
project name, "Rikk Agnew's Yardsale," and an album title: "Emotional Vomit." 
</P>
<P>
Both are fitting. Stylistically, the record is a haphazard but browsable 
display of some of Agnew's favorite musical trinkets and knickknacks, a 
collection of odds and ends that is a patchwork of old and new material, 
borrowed songs and originals. Thematically, the album is devoted largely to 
expelling rancid, undigested emotional material left over from failed 
relationships and betrayed friendships. Hence the blunt title. 
</P>
<P>
For Agnew, who plays Saturday at the Meadowlark Country Club and Sunday at the 
Doll Hut, that emotional and stylistic housecleaning is a first step toward 
making a new start that he hopes will bring a steadier career and a more 
settled personal life. 
</P>
<P>
Agnew, who will turn 32 next month, spent most of 1989 casting about for a 
musical direction after the most recent breakup of the on-again, off-again 
Adolescents. That uncertainty, coupled with too much alcohol and too many 
drugs, set the stage for a purgation on the order of "Emotional Vomit," Agnew 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of (the songs) I wrote while I was in a very bad state, a very lonely 
and self-abusing state," the stocky rocker with the stubbly face and aquiline 
nose said Thursday as he sat in a dark corner of his favorite hangout, the Doll 
Hut. "It was a way of letting it out." 
</P>
<P>
These days, things are more upbeat for Agnew. After that fallow 1989, which saw 
him serving more often as a roadie for other bands than as a musician 
commanding a stage of his own, he has returned to steady music-making in 1990. 
Agnew began the year by playing a successful national reunion tour with 
Christian Death, one of the many bands that he flitted in and out of in the 
early '80s. Then, with his hastily put-together Yardsale band, Agnew got his 
chance to tour Europe for the first time. Now, with the release of "Emotional 
Vomit" on the punk-oriented Triple X label, Agnew plans to play extensively in 
Southern California in hopes of catching the eye of scouts for major labels. 
</P>
<P>
After leading a gypsy existence, both in his band-hopping career and a 
free-booting personal life, Agnew figures it's time to settle down a bit. The 
prospect of impending fatherhood can do that. Hovering nearby as Agnew spoke, 
bestowing an occasional lovebird's hug, was his fiance, Karen Mountain. 
Mountain, 23, had followed Agnew's career from a distance ever since she was a 
13-year-old punk-rock fan growing up in Tustin. But the two didn't meet until 
this past May, when the Adolescents regrouped for a benefit show at the Doll 
Hut and Mountain turned up with a video camera to record the event. The couple 
fell in love immediately, and they're expecting a child in six months. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that I'm going to have a wife and a kid, I've got to think of three 
people," said Agnew, a friendly, animated speaker with a high, husky voice who 
wears the marks of a confirmed punk rocker -- a collection of 33 tattoos -- on 
his arms, torso and right leg. "I've got to be serious about making a career 
out of this, and not just a part-time job." 
</P>
<P>
Agnew was one of the early catalysts of the Orange County punk-rock scene that 
took shape in the late 1970s and burst forth with a series of well-received 
albums in the early '80s -- including the Adolescents' sizzling howl of a 1981 
debut album, which stands as the definitive statement of Orange County punk. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Agnew's career has followed a jagged path. The Adolescents fired 
him before that first album, "Adolescents" was even released. He landed in 
Christian Death, a gloom-punk band from Pomona, for one album. "All By Myself," 
a solo album in which Agnew played all the instruments and sang all the vocals, 
appeared in 1982 but sold poorly, even for a cult item. Agnew moved on to form 
D.I. with fellow Adolescents alumnus Casey Royer. Then he jumped to the 
re-formed Adolescents lineup, which recorded two more albums in 1987 and 1988, 
including the excellent but overlooked "Balboa Fun Zone." 
</P>
<P>
Along that choppy, musically inconsistent path, Agnew has written or co-written 
some of the most memorable rock songs to come out of Orange County -- "Amoeba," 
"No Way," "Creatures" and "Kids of the Black Hole" from that first Adolescents 
album, "OC Life" and "Johnny's Got a Problem" from D.I., and a slew of strong 
material from "Fun Zone." 
</P>
<P>
On "Emotional Vomit," Agnew again plays most of the music, including drums, 
bass, guitars, vocals and keyboards, but it's not strictly a solo affair like 
"All By Myself" (that first solo album is now available again, packaged by 
Frontier Records on CD with the first Adolescents LP). Among those helping out 
on the new album are younger brothers Alfie and Frank Agnew. Over the past 
decade, the Agnew brothers have performed in twosomes -- Rikk and Alfie in D.I. 
and one version of the Adolescents, Rikk and Frank in the Ads lineup of 
"Adolescents" and "Balboa Fun Zone" -- but never as a trio. Rikk said that will 
change Monday, when he and his younger brothers are scheduled to record a 
version of the Ramones' "Bonzo Goes to Bitburg" that's intended for a Ramones 
tribute album being put together by Triple X. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of an all-Agnew band "is always brought up now and then" by fans, Rikk 
said, but the brothers have felt such an effort would be a too-many-cooks 
situation, with each Agnew wanting to set the musical direction. "It's not so 
much the personality mix (that stands in the way of an Agnew Bros. Band), as 
different concepts of what we want to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With its collection of reworked tunes by obscure Orange County bands such as 
the Mechanics and L.S.D., covers of songs by Depeche Mode and T-Rex, and 
originals that range from a Phil Spector-style big romantic ballad to "Stress 
(I Go)," a funny, blitzing speed-metal-tinged rant about coping with everyday 
frustrations, Agnew's Yardsale project collects odds and ends, suggesting great 
versatility, but not setting a cohesive career direction. 
</P>
<P>
For his next musical move, Agnew says he has several leads to follow. The 
Yardsale band, with bassist Brad Jackman, guitarist Dan Colburn and drummer 
Chris Webb in supporting roles, is beginning an extensive series of shows after 
its six-week series of underground gigs in Europe, most of them in Germany, 
where a cult following has sprouted for early 1980s vintage Southern California 
punk. 
</P>
<P>
Agnew said he also plans to work with Rik L Rik, a veteran Los Angeles punk 
rocker, and perhaps with a new lineup of Orange County band Doggy Style. And 
there is talk of reuniting the original Adolescents again for an album of new 
material in the mold of their debut album. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to bite off more than I can chew," Agnew said. "Keeping busy is good. 
It keeps me out of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Agnew recognizes a developing pattern: Punk rockers who managed to survive 
youthful excesses and find some stability are now building solid careers with 
mainstream record companies. 
</P>
<P>
"I see a lot of my peers, like Mike Muir (of Suicidal Tendencies), and 
especially (Social Distortion's) Mike Ness -- they get their act together, they 
get their head clear, and look what happens. They get signed to major labels. 
I'm not getting younger. I've got to do it now." 
</P>
<P>
Could this represent the start of a mellowing process? 
</P>
<P>
"Mellowing is the wrong word. I'm maturing," Agnew said. "But I'm still the 
angry 16-year-old I'll always be. Being responsible doesn't mean you can't be a 
reckless 16-year-old kid. You just have to control your recklessness." 
</P>
<P>
Rikk Agnew's Yardsale, Shattered Faith and Mother Fist play tonight at 9 at the 
Meadowlark Country Club, 16782 Graham St., Huntington Beach. Tickets: $10. 
Information: (714) 846-3391. Agnew's Yardsale also plays at 6 p.m. Sunday at 
the Doll Hut, 107 S. Adams St., Anaheim, in an event to promote pledges for the 
Love Ride, an annual fund-raiser for the Muscular Dystrophy Assn. The event 
starts at 2:30 p.m., with performances by Love Killers, Smash Palace and L.S.D. 
Admission: Free. Information: (714) 533-1286.

PIANIST THRIVES ON SUDDEN STICKY WICKETTS; 
</P>
<P>
CLASSICAL MUSIC: SHE WILL FILL IN FOR THE ORIGINALLY ANNOUNCED JEAN-YVES 
THIBAUDET ON MONDAY AT THE IRVINE BARCLAY THEATRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In March, the phone rang in pianist Helene Wickett's Northern California home. 
The management of the Minnesota Symphony wanted to know whether she could play 
Mozart's Concerto No. 27 with the orchestra and conductor Edo de Waart -- on 24 
hours' notice. 
</P>
<P>
Wickett said yes. Such is the life of a professional trying to make a career 
from the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"It was lots of fun," she said in a recent phone interview from her home in 
Redwood City, San Mateo County. "It gave me a wonderful sense of 
accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
She had more time -- about two months -- when Micah Levy, music director of the 
Orange County Chamber Orchestra, called her to fill in for the originally 
announced Jean-Yves Thibaudet at a concert Monday at the Irvine Barclay 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
What had happened to Thibaudet? "It didn't work out," Levy said. "I'd rather 
not say more than that." 
</P>
<P>
(David Hamilton, Thibaudet's agent in New York, confirmed that "there was a lot 
of discussion about that date. But in the end, the contract didn't work out. . 
. . The artist was willing to uphold his end of the offer. There has been no 
discussion about rescheduling the date. He has a date in Orange County in 
1991.") 
</P>
<P>
Wickett will actually be making her return engagement with Levy and the 
orchestra. As a Pro Musicis Foundation artist, she played Beethoven's Second 
Concerto with them in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Wickett said coming back is "business and pleasure, both. I enjoyed working 
with Micah several years ago. Making a career while living on the West Coast is 
very difficult and also an endless challenge. But when things do come to you, 
you feel that you've really earned them. . . . I play as well as I can, and one 
concert leads to another." 
</P>
<P>
Born outside of San Francisco, Wickett, 35, moved to Europe in her early teens. 
Her teachers included Nadia Boulanger in Paris, Alfred Brendel in Vienna and 
Robert Casadesus in France. 
</P>
<P>
"My schooling was very unorthodox," she said. "I went to San Francisco 
Conservatory as kid, then I was taken to Europe when I was 13 and spent three 
years there. I never went to high school. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to Stanford (University) for a year, in a field totally outside music, 
when I was 16. At the end of that year, I started getting concerts. I decided I 
had to make a career choice: either going on with a career or going on with 
college. I took a big gamble and took the career." 
</P>
<P>
Regarding the Beethoven Fourth Concerto -- described by composer Robert 
Schumann as a "slender Greek maiden between two Norse giants," the Third and 
Fifth Concertos -- Wickett said the restrained work is "actually quite 
difficult." 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be quite powerful to play the piece well," she said. "All the 
quick runs happen at strategic points in the first movement. You have to 
produce quite a lot of sound going against a large-scale sound from the 
orchestra. Simply from a purely physical point of view, there is a lot of work 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
Levy's 32-piece orchestra should make that a bit easier. But it raises 
questions about how much impact the piece can make. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd much rather adjust in this direction than make the compromises which a 
very large orchestra and a 3,000-seat hall require," Wickett said. "It's much 
easier to scale down, rather than go for the large effects that our large halls 
necessitate sometimes. I have no qualms at all about scaling down. 
</P>
<P>
"Any concerto should be an oversize chamber-music kind of concert, in any case, 
in that there are times when you are more important, and there are times that 
they are. You listen and adapt to circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
When asked how much she practices every day, Wickett said simply: "Long hours. 
There are no shortcuts at all." 
</P>
<P>
But she doesn't practice scales or technical exercises. "I haven't done any 
purely technical exercises since I was 9 or 10 years old," she said. "Most are 
a waste of time. However, as you play the repertory, you're forced to address 
every conceivable problem there is in a far more effective way than any 
mechanical exercise could provide." 
</P>
<P>
On the day of a concert, Wickett fights "a constant battle between being 
sufficiently well rested and wishing I had another three weeks to practice. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be fresh and concentrated and think positive, and if you're not 
prepared, nothing will help you. Once you've accomplished these two things, 
though, it's not entirely in your hands, either. A certain amount of luck is 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
Among the factors she enumerated are the quality of the piano, the mood of the 
audience and the acoustics of the hall. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest thing, however, is that from the stage, you can't hear what goes 
into the hall," she said. "It can really be guesswork. And very often you wind 
up getting reviewed. From the audience perception, they'll hear the acoustics 
and be affected by a lousy acoustic, instead of the details of a performance." 
</P>
<P>
In earlier seasons, the Orange County Chamber Orchestra played concerts at 
Loyola Marymount in Orange on Sunday afternoons and at South Coast Repertory in 
Costa Mesa on Monday nights. 
</P>
<P>
Levy said that he has lost subscribers by consolidating their five-concert 
season on Mondays at the new Irvine theater. 
</P>

"A lot of people came on Sundays," Levy said. "A third of our total audience 
was on Sundays. So now we asked them to switch to a different location, to a 
different time and a different day. We've picked up a few new ones but haven't 
begun to make up from the lost. In the long run, it will be better for us. But 
there's also the short run.

"I'm very hopeful. I feel very optimistic about this whole thing. But, of

"Basically, the plan is to have her concentrate on raising money and selling 
more tickets," Levy said. "As time goes on and she raises more money, she will

budget, the same as last year.

 -- The orchestra has expanded to about 32 musicians for the season. Last year,

"Back in that period of time, orchestras were not necessarily huge," Levy said. 
"That doesn't mean that they didn't want larger orchestras. We will have a 
different sound. It's not going to sound like a 100-piece orchestra. It will be 
a lighter sound. And who knows, maybe that's fitting for this piece."

College projects -- Because of an error in material furnished by the California 
Community Colleges system, a story Friday incorrectly reported the capital 
projects at Orange Coast College to be funded if voters pass Proposition 143. 
OCC would receive $13.7 million for a vocational technology building and a 
central maintenance facility. Rancho Santiago Community College District would
