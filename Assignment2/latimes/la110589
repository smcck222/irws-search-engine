JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: BLANK LOOKS; 
</P>
<P>
EVERY DAY, WRITERS FACE EMPTY PAGES THAT ARE ACTUALLY FILLED WITH PROMISE 
</P>

<P>
TWO OF THE most comfortable sensations that have haunted me all my life," 
writes Bill Campbell of Glendale, "are walking onto a tennis court before play 
and sitting down before my typewriter. 
</P>
<P>
"Could it be the mystery of wondering how it will come out? The relish of an 
impending challenge?" 
</P>
<P>
We are all familiar with such beginnings: moments that are vibrant with 
promise. There is a quickening of the pulse, a mixture of fear and exultation. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Campbell's word challenge is better than fear. We are buoyed by 
confidence. We know that we are about to encounter what James Joyce called "the 
reality of experience," and we will not be found wanting. 
</P>
<P>
I no longer play tennis, and when I did play, I didn't wonder how it would come 
out. I could be pretty sure I would lose. Nevertheless, when I took the court, 
I felt that involuntary surge of mastery. This time my serve would be 
untouchable. That I more often lost than won did nothing to discourage that 
preliminary expectation -- even when it was my wife who beat me. 
</P>
<P>
Today I am a big fan of television tennis. I can't watch Ivan Lendl on the 
court without wondering what it would be like to play against him. Suppose I 
had the first serve, and assuming I could get the ball in the service court: 
How long would I last -- one serve, two? -- before Lendl walked off the court 
in disgust? 
</P>
<P>
I don't think Campbell was talking about daydreams, though. He was talking 
about real-life situations. 
</P>
<P>
All right. I sit down at the typewriter (in my case a computer). I start with a 
two-sentence quote from Bill Campbell. Then I am struck wordless by the 
impending challenge. The mystery of how it will come out. Usually I get up and 
go into the kitchen for a cup of coffee. Then I check to see if the mail has 
come. Then I decide to finish reading the paper. Then I go back to my computer. 
The sense of mystery and challenge has not gone away. 
</P>
<P>
When you face that mystery and challenge every day of your life, it takes on 
the dangerous texture of routine. You know that the muses will not come to your 
rescue. Genius will not alight on your shoulder like a parrot. Your fairy 
godmother may make the coffee, but she won't write a word. 
</P>
<P>
At that moment you are reminded of Thomas Edison's aphorism that genius is "1% 
inspiration and 99% perspiration," and you strike the first key. Was it Gene 
Fowler or Red Smith who said that the way to overcome writer's block is to put 
a piece of paper in the typewriter and wait until a drop of blood appears on 
your forehead? 
</P>
<P>
But Campbell is describing a real-life phenomenon. Children experience it on 
their first day of school, filled with emotions that we have long since 
forgotten as they march for the first time into their classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure that the South Pacific planter felt it that enchanted evening when he 
first saw the face across a crowded room and knew that somehow he would see it 
again and again. "Who can explain it? Who can tell you why?" 
</P>
<P>
Brides feel it when the minister says, "Do you take this man to be your lawful 
wedded husband? (And, of course, bridegrooms feel it, too.) That is a threshold 
brightened by mystery, challenge, enchantment -- sometimes shadowed by 
apprehension. 
</P>
<P>
Every runner feels it when he is on the mark and set and waiting, his ears 
straining for the pistol shot. Every field-goal kicker feels it when he is 
waiting for the ball to be snapped from center, and the game is on the line. 
</P>
<P>
Who has not felt it on the first day of a new job? "That's your desk over 
there. The coffee machine is at the back of the room. Your break is at 10. Good 
luck." 
</P>
<P>
Every policeman must feel it when, armed with a warrant, he knocks on the door 
of a dangerous felon. 
</P>
<P>
Every felon must know it when he hears that knock. 
</P>
<P>
The feeling is not known only to the noble. 
</P>
<P>
Who can explain it? Who can tell you why?

MOVIES OF THE WEEK

By KEVIN THOMAS

<TEXT>
<P>
In Trading Places (Channel 13 Sunday at 6 p.m.), that hilarious variation on 
"The Prince and the Pauper," Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy decide to see if 
streetwise con man Eddie Murphy can run their Philadelphia commodities 
brokerage as well as insufferable WASP Dan Akyroyd has. 
</P>
<P>
Taken Away (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie starring Valerie Bertinelli 
as a single working mother fighting to regain custody of her child. 
</P>
<P>
John Heard and Mel Harris star in the new two-part Cross of Fire (NBC Sunday 
and Monday, 9-11 p.m.) which is based on the true story of the Ku Klux Klan's 
rise and fall in Indianapolis in the '20s. 
</P>
<P>
Crocodile Dundee (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.), one of the most popular movies of the 
decades, stars Paul Hogan in the title role as a resourceful tour guide in the 
Australian outback, who winds up in adventure and romance in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Randal Kleiser's fine 1980 remake of The Blue Lagoon (Channel 5 Monday at 8 
p.m.) succeeds in involving us with a couple of kids (Brooke Shields, 
Christopher Atkins) stranded on a tropical isle and presents their coming of 
age with tenderness and honesty. 
</P>
<P>
The Gate (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) is sub-Spielberg stuff, a bit of 
horror-whimsy about wholesome, lovable all-American kids battling the Forces of 
Darkness; Stephen Dorff stars. 
</P>
<P>
When He's Not a Stranger (CBS Monday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie starring 
Annabeth Gish as a college freshman seeking justice after being raped by a man 
she knows. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Tracy, Detective is the first of four Dick Tracy movies from the '40s 
airing on Channel 28 this week at 11 p.m. Morgan Conway stars in the first 
(Monday) and in Dick Tracy Vs. Cueball (Tuesday); Ralph Byrd, the definitive 
Tracy, stars in Dick Tracy's Dilemma (Wednesday) and Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome 
(Thursday). 
</P>
<P>
John Hughes' 1985 The Breakfast Club (Channel 5 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) finds five 
radically different kids (Anthony Michael Hall, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, 
Molly Ringwald and Judd Nelson) who get to know each other in the course of an 
all-day detention at their suburban Illinois high school. It's engaging but 
finally too schematic for its own good. 
</P>
<P>
Set in the forbidding wasteland of the future, George Miller's The Road Warrior 
(Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is slam-bang entertainment envisioning a 
gas-starved postwar world in which scavengers prowl a shimmering strip of 
highway, ready to kill for a tank of fuel. Mel Gibson is once again Mad Max, a 
Shane-like loner drawn to helping a group of idealistic, bewildered survivors. 
</P>
<P>
The Secret of My Success (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), a 1987 misfired comic 
fantasy on business success in in the Reagan era, stars Michael J. Fox who 
brings a welcome low-key winsome chutzpah to a Kansas college graduate 
determined to conquer the corporate world of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Parker's Angel Heart (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is a visually lush, 
determinedly lurid thriller of the supernatural that overreaches yet is 
captivating all the same. Mickey Rourke, in his usual ferocious low-life guise, 
stars, and Robert De Niro has a witty turn as Satan. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood aren't the most convincing casting as a Puerto 
Rican Romeo and Juliet, but Robert Wise's Oscar-laden, razzle-dazzle film of 
West Side Story (Channel 13 Thursday at 7:30 p.m.) is nonetheless a terrific 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Blake Edwards' unfunny Blind Date (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.) features a 
beautiful woman (Kim Basinger) with no tolerance whatever for alcohol who goes 
out on a blind date with a yuppie executive (Bruce Willis) who, although warned 
about her problem, feeds her quantities of champagne and then watches in 
outraged dismay as she lurches out of control. 
</P>
<P>
WarGames (Channel 5 Friday at 7:30 p.m.) is a taut, ingenious winner in which 
high school computer whiz Matthew Broderick blunders into a game, Global 
Thermonuclear War, with the Defense Department's computer which keeps ticking 
away after Broderick quits. 
</P>
<P>
The 1966 Batman (Channel 11 Friday at 8 p.m.), with Adam West, is just awful, 
hopelessly dated. 
</P>
<P>
In An American Werewolf in London (Channel 9 Saturday at 8 p.m.) director John 
Landis juxtaposes humor and gore with such outrageousness that from one moment 
to the next you can't tell whether you're going to laugh or cringe. Not for the 
very young but a delirious treat that develops surprising poignance. David 
Naughton and Griffin Dunne star.

Based on the quality of product lately, were I a stockholder in NBC, CBS or 
ABC, I would demand an accounting and an apology. Even the most timid of 
critics rates the best of the fall shows at the lower end of mediocrity. The 
only fit viewing: returns, reruns and old movies. TV finally has descended to 
its nadir in autumn '89. We hope it is the nadir, not the norm.

VOICES FROM THE FIRST GENERATION; 
</P>
<P>
THE RAMIREZ &amp; HERNANDEZ FAMILIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, Hector Tobar is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TO HEAR MARILU Ramirez talk, you would not believe that two of her brothers 
have been killed by the Salvadoran military; that she has been separated from 
five of her nine children since she fled her country in 1987, and that the U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service is trying to have her deported. There is 
little trace of anger or despair in the voice of the 37-year-old housekeeper 
from Sonsonate in western El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many people suffering what we are. . . . At least we have a roof 
over our heads," Ramirez says quietly in Spanish as she sits in a one-bedroom 
apartment shared by more than a dozen relatives. "I know a lot of people who 
don't even have this. There are people living on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, who asked that her real name not be published, to protect relatives in 
El Salvador, came to Los Angeles after soldiers detained and tortured her for 
six days in 1987. She says members of her family were targeted for repression 
because military officials accused them of being "subversives" linked to 
leftist guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of the 350,000 Salvadorans who have come to Southern California, 
Ramirez lives in Pico-Union, a community just west of downtown Los Angeles. 
Pico-Union is mostly a community of exiles, the product of a decade of 
revolution and civil war that has ravaged their tiny country. Today, only San 
Salvador, El Salvador's capital, has a larger Salvadoran population than L.A. 
</P>
<P>
The community is a cross section of Salvadoran society. There are country 
people like Ramirez but also city dwellers from San Salvador's working-class 
barrios. Exiled guerrilla fighters have formed a local support network for the 
revolutionary movement, and they coexist with several thousand former soldiers 
and National Guardsmen who also have found refuge in Los Angeles from their 
country's violence and economic difficulties. There also is a small sampling of 
well-to-do businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
Although exact figures are not available, Nina Lockard, a social services 
coordinator at the Central American Refugee Center, calculates that about 60% 
of the Salvadoran immigrants in Los Angeles are undocumented. Perhaps about 70% 
are unemployed, she says, and probably living at or below the poverty line. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the growth of the community, there are many Salvadorans who hope that 
Los Angeles will not become their permanent home. Maria Hernandez, 32, says she 
still dreams of the day she can return to El Salvador, which she left six years 
ago, a victim of political repression. 
</P>
<P>
Once a sociologist working for El Salvador's Ministry of Education, Hernandez 
says she survived two assassination attempts after she published a study highly 
critical of the Salvadoran government. Her desire to return one day to El 
Salvador, however, is not shared by her 19-year-old daughter, Margie, who was 
born in El Salvador but who has grown into adulthood in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty sure that I could go back if the situation improves so that my life 
isn't in danger," says Hernandez, a caseworker at a Pico-Union legal aid 
clinic, who also asked that her real name not be published. "But I'm also 90% 
sure that my daughter won't go back. She says life is easier here because no 
one is watching us or following us." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez now lives in suburban Azusa; raising children in the Pico-Union 
barrio, she says, was difficult. She is currently studying for a master's 
degree in political science, and Margie is a first-year student at Cal Poly 
Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Although she is grateful that both Margie and her other daughter, Fatima, 12, 
have adjusted well to life in Southern California, Hernandez says she worries 
about the effect of television, "materialism" and other American institutions 
on her family. 
</P>
<P>
The same concern over American culture and traditional Salvadoran family values 
is shared by Ramirez. She says she has done her best to make sure her teen-age 
children avoid the problems of gang violence and drug abuse that have affected 
other Salvadoran youths in Pico-Union. The Los Angeles Police Department says 
the largest of the Salvadoran gangs, the 150-member Salvatrucha gang, deals 
drugs in Pico-Union and has been growing and becoming more violent. 
</P>
<P>
"In El Salvador, children listen to their parents," Ramirez says. "And there is 
always someone home when your children come home after school. Here, our young 
people seem to be lost to us." 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez says raising her children would be easier if she could make more money. 
If she could afford to pay more rent, for instance, they wouldn't have to live 
in such crowded conditions: Before the manager of her building complained, 26 
people were living in her apartment. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, Ramirez says, is that only she and two of the other eight adults 
living with her -- brothers, sisters and in-laws -- can find work. The others 
don't have work permits because the Immigration Reform and Control Act granted 
amnesty only to those illegal immigrants who came to the United States before 
1982 -- effectively excluding the Salvadorans, most of whom began arriving in 
the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the law, Ramirez says she has plans to bring more of her relatives to 
Los Angeles, where they will be safe from the violence of the Salvadoran 
countryside. Recently, one of her brothers has undertaken three trips from 
Tijuana to El Salvador and back to guide family members to California. 
</P>
<P>
"We're used to living close to each other," she says of her family. "We can't 
be all together right now, but we still have to try to help each other all we 
can." 
</P>

THE RAZI FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, Gregory Crouch is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALI RAZI TALKS about Feb. 12, 1979, like it was the day he died. 
</P>
<P>
On a business trip in London, he had awakened to a cup of coffee and the 
morning news. The president of a mega-corporation in Tehran, he sat on the edge 
of his hotel bed listening to an inconceivable TV report -- the Imperial 
Iranian Army of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi had surrendered to the Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
"Twelve hours later, my secretary called and said, 'There is an ayatollah 
sitting on your desk, taking over the company,' " he recalls. The young woman 
told him that it wasn't safe to return to Iran especially after she had 
informed the ayatollah that he could never replace a man as great as Razi. 
</P>
<P>
Razi still cannot tell the next part of the story without crying. His wife, 
Anousheh, must finish it for him. 
</P>
<P>
The company he started from nothing and built into a construction giant with 
$250 million in sales, 5,000 employees and joint ventures around the world had 
become a memory in just a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
The Razis, with their daughter and two sons, came to Los Angeles in late 1979 
carrying a few suitcases, some savings and the hope that Razi's business 
experience would help them get by. 
</P>
<P>
The family has done better than just survive in the 10 years since. Razi, 48, 
and Anousheh, 46, have woven themselves into the fabric of Los Angeles politics 
and business. He is a partner in a Newport Beach development company, and she 
is a member of the country club set in Bel-Air. Both are active in national 
politics and local charities. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a Persian poet who says a human being is like a nail," Razi says. 
"The more you hammer on top of it, the more it is driven in and becomes 
stronger." 
</P>
<P>
The metaphor drives the Iranian community in Los Angeles, which has absorbed at 
least 400,000 refugees -- including a large, well-educated group of doctors, 
poets, architects, actors, engineers and attorneys -- who fled the fall of the 
Shah's regime in the late 1970s and early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
The 848-page Iranian Yellow Pages for Southern California is a testament to 
their success in the United States -- about 1,600 businesses and professionals 
are listed, including 91 dentists and 58 accountants. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere in Los Angeles is the Iranian presence stronger than on the half-mile 
strip of Westwood Boulevard near UCLA that is an eating and shopping mecca. 
Everything from Burger King to the used-car lot is Iranian-owned. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday afternoons, Iranian families stroll down the street bumping into 
friends and celebrities, including the Shah's nephew, Shahbaz Pahlabod. The 
smell of taftoon bread sneaks out of sidewalk cafes to tantalize passers-by, 
while local bakeries entice them with trays of Persian treats. Fortune-cookie 
messages are printed in Farsi. 
</P>
<P>
For many children, the weekly pilgrimage is really a field trip. Westwood 
Boulevard is the only place they have ever been that even remotely resembles 
Iran. 
</P>
<P>
The Razis' youngest son, Keyvan, 12, has no recollection of his year and a half 
in Iran and speaks Farsi with an American accent. He prefers pizza and Gatorade 
to chicken kabob and a glass of doogh. 
</P>
<P>
Parents fear that their children will see Iran only through the eyes of the 
media -- hordes of Muslims denouncing the United States or staring into the 
moon hoping for a glimpse of the ayatollah. 
</P>
<P>
"The younger generation will not go back," Razi says. "It's not practical. They 
will go to help, but this is where they know and this is where they are going 
to stay." 
</P>
<P>
Keyvan's grandmother, meantime, is simply hoping to live long enough to see the 
day she can return. Badri Dadsetan, 77, left Iran with great reluctance. She 
was finally forced to get on a plane after the chants of Allah Akbar -- God Is 
Great -- finally unnerved her son-in-law. Razi and Dadsetan were the last two 
holdouts -- the rest of the family had fled to London months earlier. None has 
ever returned to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Now Dadsetan spends three hours every day listening to Farsi television and 
radio and tries to read many of the 20 or so Iranian magazines and newspapers 
published in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
She is a representative of a small component within the Iranian population in 
Los Angeles that doesn't speak English and rarely talks to outsiders. They 
drive back and forth on Coldwater Canyon because it reminds them of the road to 
Chalus, and they sit on the shores of the Pacific pretending it's the Caspian 
Sea. They miss the sounds of street vendors selling watermelons and hot beets 
and the smell of the grass in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
"Even today she is incredibly upset," Niloofar, the Razis' daughter, says. "All 
her thoughts are still on Iran." 
</P>
<P>
But the rest of the family says this is now their home. For several years, Razi 
has taken a leadership role in local Republican Party politics, even traveling 
to Sacramento to cast an electoral vote for George Bush. Now Niloofar, 21, and 
her brother Babak, 23, are joining political groups, too. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a lesson from the revolution," Razi says. "In Iran, we thought we do 
our profession, and politics is taken care of by the government. We learned 
that we have to be active." 
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Razi and Anousheh watched from the steps of the U.S. Capitol 
as George Bush became the nation's 41st President. 
</P>
<P>
"It was democracy in action. This country stands for freedom and liberty, and 
sometimes I think the newcomer appreciates that more than some of the people 
who are born here," Razi says. "It's important to keep this dream going." 
</P>

VOICES FROM THE FIRST GENERATION; 
</P>
<P>
THE NGOY FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
TED NGOY HAD an unrelenting obsession during his 1975 plane ride from Southeast 
Asia to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to raise pigs and chickens and have enough meat and eggs to take 
to the market," recalls Ngoy, who came from a poor family in Cambodia, where 
99% of the people are farmers. "That was my dream." 
</P>
<P>
The dream would not be fulfilled, but eventually, Ngoy, now 47, made his way in 
a manner more spectacular than he ever could have imagined. 
</P>
<P>
In Cambodia, Ngoy was in law school when poverty forced him to drop out and 
work as a travel agent and tour guide. Later, he became a major in the army 
assigned to his country's embassy in Bangkok, Thailand. That's where he was in 
1975 when the communist Khmer Rouge took control of his native land and began a 
four-year reign of terror. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to return home, Ngoy fled with his wife and three children and arrived 
almost destitute at Camp Pendleton in Oceanside. They spent their first month 
in America waiting for a sponsor. Eventually, a Lutheran church in Tustin hired 
Ngoy as its full-time janitor, allowing the family to move into a small, 
showerless room on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
To make ends meet, Ngoy took on two extra jobs: as an evening clerk at a 
Builders Emporium and as a nighttime pump jockey at a gas station. Then, as if 
it had been preordained, it happened: Ngoy discovered doughnuts. 
</P>
<P>
One night at the gas station, a co-worker ducked over to a nearby doughnut shop 
to bring him his first taste of the sugary snacks. "I didn't know what it was," 
Ngoy says, "but I liked it. My kids liked it, too." 
</P>
<P>
The next day, the ambitious church janitor bicycled to the doughnut shop and, 
holding out the small amount of cash he had managed to save, offered to buy the 
place. "They didn't understand me," recalls Ngoy, who spoke little English at 
the time. "They turned me down." 
</P>
<P>
A day later, he approached a Winchell's doughnut shop with the same offer. As 
fate would have it, the company had just initiated an affirmative action 
program to increase its minority hiring, and Ngoy was soon enrolled in a 
management-training program. After a year of managing a Winchell's Donut House 
in Newport Beach, Ngoy had borrowed enough money from friends and relatives in 
the tightknit Cambodian community to buy Christy's, an independent doughnut 
shop in La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-1980s, Ngoy had saved and scraped together money many times over. 
The one shop had become 50 -- a veritable doughnut empire stretching from San 
Francisco to San Diego. And the new Cambodian doughnut czar and his family 
occupied a luxurious home on a private lake in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy," says Ngoy, who now employs most of his relatives, including 
his wife and children, and has begun to diversify. Over the years, he has also 
repaid his loans by setting up dozens of his countrymen in shops of their own. 
"America is a miraculous country." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it must seem miraculous to the hundreds of Cambodian refugees who, like 
Ngoy, are changing the face of Southern California. Their impact can be seen 
most dramatically in cities such as Long Beach, where nearly half of the 
region's estimated 85,000 Cambodians live. They have virtually remade a bleak 
portion of that city's central "Anaheim corridor" into a thriving commercial 
district, a neighborhood infused with their religion and culture. 
</P>
<P>
One anchor of the Long Beach Cambodian community is the $1.4-million Khemara 
Buddhikarama pagoda, a religious and cultural center that provides social 
services. Another is the United Cambodian Community, which, over the past 12 
years, has expanded from a few friends with part-time use of a borrowed desk to 
an organization with seven offices and a $2.4-million budget that annually 
serves more than 10,000 people from a variety of immigrant groups. 
</P>
<P>
The community as a whole faces serious problems, says Vora H. Kanthoul, 
associate executive director of the center. Although Cambodian immigration has 
slowed to a trickle, according to Kanthoul, many of the immigrants are still 
unskilled and unemployed. Unlike doughnut mogul Ngoy, who was lucky enough to 
escape the atrocities under the Khmer Rouge, many of the immigrants face a 
particularly acute need for mental health services to treat what experts 
describe as disorientation, depression, inertia, paranoia, even functional 
blindness apparently brought about by the traumas they experienced. They also 
encounter discrimination. Asian leaders agree that most Americans seem to have 
a healthy respect for Cambodian culture, but occasional misunderstandings still 
evoke the sort of hostile reactions that some fear may be lingering just below 
the service. 
</P>
<P>
An incident in Long Beach earlier this year is one example. Animal-rights 
activists expressed outrage after a judge dismissed cruelty charges against two 
Cambodians who had admitted killing a German shepherd puppy for food. Cambodian 
leaders were quick to characterize such behavior as un-Cambodian. Nonetheless, 
the incident provoked ugly responses, including a rash of seemingly racist 
bumper stickers, and resulted in state legislation outlawing the killing of 
pets for consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, most Cambodians say, life in America is improving. "The longer you 
stay, the better things get," Kanthoul says. "It's a success story. Considering 
that (the immigrants) came with nothing but their bare hands, if you're not 
impressed with the achievement, I don't know what you're looking for."

<TEXT>
<P>
There are several matters that I would have you and your readers know with 
reference to the portrayal by Peter Boyer of me in what he styles "The War" 
between me and my former husband, Steve Garvey. 
</P>
<P>
First, I would certainly have preferred that no one's version of "The War" be 
offered for such conspicuous public consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Second, it is no less saddening than it is unsurprising that Steve would 
attempt in the media as he has in the courtroom to shift responsibility for his 
daughters' estrangement from him away from his own bizarre and hurtful behavior 
and on to me. 
</P>
<P>
Third, as people who know, work with and, yes, even love me would attest, I am 
not "obsessed," suicidal or a wild woman. Rather, I live, work and raise 
virtually alone two teen-age daughters in this area and look forward to the 
time when my children and I will no longer be made objects of scrutiny, 
criticism and even derision by mention of us in Steve's media adventures.

Steve Garvey was my favorite Dodger, and I tried to keep an open mind in 
regards to his "problems" -- until I read his "side of the story." I can only 
tell you, if he was my husband or my friend or my associate, I would become 
hysterical and need counseling just being around this "pillar of perfection." 
All I can say to Cyndy Garvey is, I wish you and your daughters all the best.

In the Sept. 24 cover story by Peter J. Boyer ("Mr. Clean's Mid-Life Crisis"), 
Steve Garvey aired his dirty laundry. Then, as a sequel, we were treated with 
Cynthia Garvey's one day in jail for contempt of court. This appears to be no 
more than an arrogant egomaniac seeking revenge on his ex-wife. Mr. Garvey 
states he would like to run for public office. He can't even run his own 
affairs. If this man can't be loyal to one woman, how could he possibly be 
loyal to a constituency. His current wife is kind enough to offer to raise the 
children born to the other women with whom he had affairs. Who does she think 
she is, a saint? I find the "new" Garveys offensive, lacking of intelligence 
and devoid of any human compassion for anyone but themselves. They deserve each 
other.

NOTEBOOK: ALICE WILL CONTINUE TO LIVE IN MALIBU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It looked for awhile as if the story was going to be "Alice Doesn't Live Here 
Anymore." 
</P>
<P>
About a year and a half ago, Alice's Restaurant, on the state-owned Malibu 
Pier, announced that it was going to vacate its longtime waterside site. The 
new holder of concessions for the pier had raised the rent, and the restaurant 
was planning to move to a new, unspecified location. Since that time, though, 
that concession holder has relinquished control of the facility -- and Alice's 
is still in its original location, with no further plans to decamp. 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, restaurant co-proprietor Peter Palazzo says he and his 
partners are in the final stages of negotiating a 20-year lease for the site -- 
and simultaneously a deal by which they themselves would become concession 
holders for the entire pier. (Palazzo's partners are Bob Yuro and Andre 
Guerrero, through their Japedemy Inc., which owns both Alice's and Brio in 
Tarzana.) "We haven't formulated all of our plans yet," says Palazzo, "but when 
the deal is signed, there will be some necessary reconstruction of the whole 
pier, with new retail facilities out at the end of it, including sportfishing 
facilities of some kind. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd also like to redo the restaurant, including the kitchen, and maybe add an 
outdoor deck overlooking the water. There's been a restaurant on this spot 
since at least the 1940s, since long before Alice's, and the structure has 
really taken a beating over the years. We'd like to get it back to a style of 
place that I think everybody would like to look at." 
</P>
<P>
TEA WITH A TWIST: Cucumber sandwiches and petits fours aren't the only thing 
you can eat with your tea in Los Angeles these days. Two new teatimes in town 
offer some more interesting choices. City Restaurant on La Brea serves what 
co-owner/chef Susan Feniger describes as "an Indian teatime menu," weekdays 
from 3 to 5:45 p.m. That means homemade pooris, samosas and other Indian 
delights -- plus a large selection of teas, loose, with nary a tea bag in 
sight. . . . And Pane Caldo Bistrot in Beverly Hills serves tea Monday through 
Saturday from 3:30 to 5 p.m., featuring not only assorted Italian-style sweet 
cakes but also a selection of savory pastries flavored with walnuts, 
prosciutto, or anchovies. 
</P>
<P>
CONSIDER THE OYSTERS: The "Oysters on Ocean" festival starts today at Ocean 
Avenue Seafood in Santa Monica, featuring the largest selection of oysters in 
Southern California. About 10 varieties of oysters will be served on the 
half-shell (Kumamoto, Olympia, Belon, Fanny Bay), plus several hot oyster-based 
dishes (i.e., Hangtown Fry and oyster stew). The festival will run through the 
end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
DON'T CALL IT SPEEDO: San Francisco restaurant star (and proprietor of Stars 
restaurant) Jeremiah Tower has renamed his new restaurant, from "Speedo 690" to 
simply "690." Although Tower had drawn the original name from the Speedo 
Carburetor Shop that used to occupy the premises, the Speedo swimwear company 
had filed a copyright infringement complaint against him alleging misuse of 
their trademarked moniker. Tower decided, he says, that he'd rather switch than 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
GAME PLAN: Trattoria Toscana in Brentwood features a selection of wild game 
dishes, prepared Tuscan style, in addition to its regular menu, from Nov. 12 to 
19. 
</P>
<P>
CHANGES: Cafe Connection in Beverly Hills, which has featured some Brazilian 
dishes in the past, and has catered numerous Brazilian-themed banquets around 
town during the last two years, has gone 100% Brazilian -- serving dishes from 
that country exclusively now, with live Brazilian music added on Thursday, 
Friday, and Saturday. . . . David Cecchini, former chef at Genio's in Burbank 
and at his own Cafe Casanova in Glendale, has gone into partnership with Leo 
and Jane Damian to open Jane's Cucina Italia (which, somewhat strangely, means 
"Jane's Italy Kitchen (or Cuisine)" at the Safari Hotel in Burbank . . . . 
Giancarlo Zaretti has sold his 8-year-old Pontevecchio in Santa Monica. The new 
proprietor is Mary Lou Barilla, whose family has owned several Italian 
restaurants in Pittsburgh. She plans to refurbish the place and introduce a new 
menu -- but Pontevecchio will remain open while the changes are in the works. . 
. . Rex II Ristorante, downtown, has at least temporarily abandoned its 
longtime (and unusual) policy of not opening for dinner until 7 p.m. Service 
now starts at 6 p.m. Why? To accommodate diners who are going to see "Phantom 
of the Opera" at the Music Center, says Rex boss Mauro Vincenti.

CLARKE'S IN LONDON REDEFINES RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clarke's has been called "Anglo-French" and also "Californian." Proprietor 
Sally Clarke herself has been called one of the best chefs in London. She has 
also been accused of not running a "real" restaurant at all -- because, like 
her mentor Alice Waters at Chez Panisse in Berkeley, she offers only one prix 
fixe dinner nightly. 
</P>
<P>
Well, I suppose there are many ways of defining "real." But sitting in the 
downstairs dining room at Clarke's recently -- eating a salad of perfect 
grilled salmon set off by the contrasting sweet/bitter/salty/minty flavors of 
roasted peppers, rocket leaves (arugula), black olives and basil mayonnaise; a 
juicy corn-fed pigeon grilled with sage and garlic, served with a corn pancake 
and a parchment-paper packet of parsnips, carrots, shallots and potatoes, 
roasted to the point of caramelization in rich butter and fresh herbs; a 
selection of English farmhouse cheeses with homemade oatmeal crackers, and a 
light raspberry-filled meringue with homemade pistachio ice cream -- I remember 
thinking that this seemed to me about as real as food could get. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke is a slender, pretty young woman who seems almost obsessively dedicated 
to her craft (her workday commonly begins at 7 a.m. and ends after dinner). And 
she learned a lot about the restaurant business in Southern California. One 
morning in September, over espresso in the cheery, art-filled street-level 
portion of her establishment, she told her culinary story: 
</P>
<P>
"I was born and brought up in Guildford, near London. I was one of three 
children, and each of us had a specific job around the house. Mine had always 
been helping to make the meals, so when I was about 12 1/2 and needed to earn 
some money for riding holidays, my mother suggested that I should go to work 
for a local caterer. I did, and I loved it. 
</P>
<P>
"After high school, I took a two-year hotel and restaurant course at Croydon 
Technical College. I was taught how to clean the bathrooms and put cherries on 
top of half-grapefruits and dreadful things like that. Then I decided that I 
wanted to learn the frilly bits. I applied to the Cordon Bleu in London, but 
they turned me down. When I wrote to the Cordon Bleu in Paris, though, they 
basically said, 'If you've got the money, you can come.' I went, and while I 
was there I met Michael McCarty (of Michael's in Santa Monica, etc.) and 
Ricardo Jurado-Solares (who now helps manage McCarty's Adirondacks restaurant 
in Washington). This was my first (exposure to) Americans, and it was more of a 
shock than Paris itself." 
</P>
<P>
Clarke supplemented her classes by visiting local restaurants and markets and 
cooking informal dinners with McCarty and his friends. "Then I decided that if 
I really wanted to learn about food, I should work professionally in Paris. A 
friend of Michael's told me to go see Raymond Oliver at Le Grand Vefour (then a 
three-star restaurant). I remember that I stood outside the place for hours, 
afraid to go in. Finally I got up the nerve. Oliver was very sweet, and 
immediately picked up the phone and called his son Michel, who had just opened 
the Bistro de Paris, and told him that he thought he ought to hire me." 
</P>
<P>
She worked with Oliver and his chef at the time, Pierre Vedel (he later went on 
to open a respected restaurant of his own) for three months. They treated her 
as something of a novelty, she says, but she says she "saw a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Clarke then moved on to two other Paris restaurants, the traditional Le 
Recamier and the decidedly non-traditional Au Pactole, then in its heyday under 
owner-chef Jacques Maniere. "After that," says Clarke, "I thought I knew 
everything there was to know about food, and I wanted to be a writer." 
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, she moved back to London and wrote to two Englishwomen 
prominent in the field -- Elizabeth David and Prue Leith. David called her up 
and said something like, "If you want to be a writer, just start writing." 
Leith interviewed her, and ended up hiring her to work in her catering company. 
She later helped Leith set up her cooking school. 
</P>
<P>
"In the middle of all this," she says, "Michael McCarty called me up out of the 
blue and said, 'I'm opening a restaurant in L.A. next month, and I want you to 
come over and help.' Of course, he hadn't even found a site yet. But we 
basically just ran around L.A. with his mom and dad and his girlfriend, Kim 
(now Mrs. McCarty), eating out, seeing what other people were doing, doing 
'market research.' When he found a bar on a side street in Santa Monica called 
Brigadoon, he basically shoved me in the front door and said, 'Go see what the 
ladies' loos are like.' The Brigadoon, of course, eventually turned into 
Michael's." 
</P>
<P>
Clarke helped set up Michael's, but had to return to England before it opened. 
Back in L.A. a few months later, she went to work at the restaurant, cooking 
with chef Jonathan Waxman during the day and working the door with McCarty at 
night. That lasted about 18 months. After another brief stay in London, she 
returned to California and worked the door at the West Beach Cafe in Venice and 
then again at Michael's. During this time, she recalls, somebody took her to 
Chez Panisse in Berkeley. It was a revelation. 
</P>
<P>
"I just couldn't believe it," she says. "From the time I'd been 13 or 14, I'd 
always had this fantasy about a restaurant where there'd be just one menu, 
where it would be sort of like cooking for my family -- and that's just what 
Chez Panisse was doing." 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by the Berkeley landmark, Clarke resolved to open her own place, and 
to do it in London. She returned to the city in 1983, found a location on an 
antique shop-filled stretch of Kensington Church Street, and opened Clarke's in 
December of 1984 with her one-menu-a-night policy. (Clarke will vary the dinner 
menu only to the point of preparing vegetarian meals on request. At lunchtime, 
though, there is a choice of three appetizers and three main dishes -- because, 
says Clarke, "We get a lot of business trade during the day, with people 
meeting each other for the first time, and if there was no flexibility, it 
might embarrass some people.") 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Clarke added a shop called "&amp; Clarke's" next door, where she 
sells California wines, British cheeses (superb and varied -- a real revelation 
to anyone who thinks that subject begins with chewy yellow Cheddar and ends 
with plastic Stilton), homemade chocolate truffles, and roughly a dozen kinds 
of homemade bread and rolls -- also served generously in the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke's doesn't exactly look Californian, but it does seem more Los Angeles 
than London. And the ever-changing menu owes an obvious debt to contemporary 
Californian cooking (and thus by extension, of course, to traditional 
Mediterranean cuisine). 
</P>
<P>
There might be yellow pepper soup with olive oil, Parmigiano and assorted 
crostini; homemade ravioli filled with bufala mozzarella and poached in a light 
roasted tomato broth; grilled tuna salad with garlic toast; grilled boneless 
quail with chile-and-orange-zest butter; grilled salmon char with shallot and 
nasturtium sauce; grilled breast of wild duck accompanied by braised leg of 
duck with herb-infused white beans; coffee granite with lemon shortbread; pear 
and Armagnac brioche tart with prune ice cream, and melon and purple figs in 
light mint syrup. 
</P>
<P>
This is fresh, honest, gloriously simple food, cooked exactly right. And if 
that's not "real," I don't know what is.

TALES OF JAY LENO, MR. NICE GUY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I went to the Long Beach Grand Prix with only one intention -- to see Jay Leno, 
who was one of the celebrity drivers. As I peered through a fence, he came out 
of an outhouse. I yelled out, "Hey, Jay!" He turned and did his little "chin 
thing" . . . funny without even saying a word. 
</P>
<P>
OK -- so maybe it was a little rude to bother him at such a moment, but I sure 
wish that I'd had my camera!

I enjoyed Lawrence Christon's Oct. 22 Jay Leno article, which brought to mind 
two incidents. 
</P>
<P>
I tried stand-up comedy at San Francisco's Holy City Zoo at a beginners' "open 
mike" night in 1976. The task didn't seem daunting until the comedian before me 
exploded with brilliant improvisation. He closed by inviting the audience for 
ice cream across Clement Street. This left mercifully few patrons to see me 
bomb. 
</P>
<P>
I asked the bartender if this comedian really was a beginner. His answer: "This 
was only Robin Williams' second time here." 
</P>
<P>
The bartender continued: "Why don't you come back next Sunday? You can go on 
before a fellow who wants to 'work out' here with some new material." 
</P>
<P>
The following Sunday, I dutifully performed and then sat slack-jawed along with 
other comedic hopefuls as we watched Jay Leno deliver a tremendous 1-hour, 
45-minute set. For him, it was just a practice. For us, it was an unforgettable 
lesson in humor, pacing, stage technique and reaching your audience.

A reaction to the letters about KROQ: All right, enough is enough. The 
supposedly hip radio audience of Los Angeles has only itself to blame for the 
homogenization of KROQ's programming. 
</P>
<P>
Reeb's changes are a result of what the masses want to listen to. Profitability 
of a radio station is a function of how the station performs in the quarterly 
Arbitron ratings book. Fewer listeners yield lower ratings, which equal lower 
ad revenues. 
</P>
<P>
For letter writer Cheryl Wadeson to lable Mr. Reeb a "ratings-hungry, sell-out 
station manager" is ludicrous. The problem is that the majority of L.A. radio 
listeners happen to like the mainstream, accessible, safe pop song.

Regarding the Oct. 29 letters responding to Patrick Goldstein's Pop Eye column 
about KROQ-FM's format modification: None of the letter writers supported 
KROQ's change, accusing the management of selling out. But they are forgetting: 
Commercial radio is there to make money. 
</P>
<P>
If stations could run nothing but ads, most would. KROQ was losing listeners 
and thus ad revenue. Trip Reeb, the station's new manager, came from a highly 
rated modern rocker, 91X in San Diego, and his actions may well save KROQ from 
being forced to entirely change its format, as happened with KFAC-FM. 
</P>
<P>
As a modern rock music director, I appreciate the need for an outlet for 
underground/new music -- but the place for this is college radio. Stations like 
ours regularly play bands months or even years before they gain acceptance on 
commercial radio. 
</P>
<P>
KROQ must appeal to the majority of its listeners, and believe it or not, you 
alternative types do not make up all that large a demographic group. 
</P>
<P>
Face reality and just be glad KROQ did not decide to go more Top 40.

I am astonished to read complaints from rock fans about the racist insults and 
other obscenities that issue from Guns N' Roses' Axl Rose and the like 
(Letters, Oct. 22 and 29). 
</P>
<P>
These heavy-metal types have made their fortunes in catering to the new 
barbarism, proclaiming their antisocial stance in everything from the names 
they choose for their groups to their rogues' gallery get-ups, which generally 
want only the finishing touch of a pair of handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
Their every performance, or public tantrum, calls for a police presence and 
special measures for the delivery of first aid. 
</P>
<P>
Enthusiasm for their spectacles arises in the main from a spirit of hostility, 
rampant in a generation largely deprived of adequate parenting. What should 
anyone expect from Guns N' Roses -- sweetness N' light?

Entertaining in the New L.A. It's about cultures, contradictions and 
complements, traditions and an insatiable search for something new. Whether we 
entertain privately in our homes or publicly in a restaurant, we've developed a 
love affair with ethnic foods of all types, and we excel at blending flavors 
from a variety of cuisines, such as the pairings of chef-created soups and 
sandwiches on Page 30. We happily mix and match, be it tableware, foods and 
customs of the Far East or of the Near East, of Central America or of South 
America, of the American Southwest or of the Yankee Northeast. We're as 
comfortable seated on floor pillows dining on Moroccan fare as we are gathered 
in a high-tech restaurant sampling the latest in L. A. cuisine, or hiring a 
caterer to provide elegant hors d'oeuvres and decadent desserts while we 
prepare the entree. Rules are broken in the New L.A.: Luxury looks meet casual 
concepts head-on; old and new make bold pairings. Ethnicity comes as second 
nature; the issue is style and how to achieve it.

AKIKO TAKENAKA, AGUSTIN AND MARIA GARZA AND JORGE SANTOS

Yukuo Takenaka's first brush with the differences between Japanese and American 
social customs came in a physical-education class in Salt Lake City when he was 
15 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a dancing class," he says, shaking his head. "That really shook me. You 
have to remember, in Japan in those days, we didn't even talk to girls and we 
certainly didn't hold hands. I had never danced in my life. In fact, I had 
never touched a woman's hand before. And in the United States, girls grow up 
very fast. It was a shocking experience to say the least." 
</P>
<P>
Takenaka recovered enough to become the first Japanese accountant at the 
prestigious accounting company of Peat-Marwick, where he worked for 22 years 
before leaving this past March to found his own investment-banking firm, 
Takenaka and Co. His new role often requires that he act as a Japanese firm's 
man in America. He's not uneasy about dancing any more, but he remains acutely 
aware of the differences between the way the two countries live and do 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between when Japanese entertain and when Americans entertain is 
that when Japanese entertain for business, it is 100% business," he says. "In 
American business entertaining, there is a lot of emphasis on family and 
friends. Americans try to become your personal friend before they become your 
business friend. 
</P>
<P>
"In my home, I would only entertain relatives -- cousins and nephews -- or very 
close friends I have known for a long time. For business, we usually take our 
guests to restaurants or nightclubs, or sometimes to play golf." 
</P>
<P>
For this, there is a price to pay. Takenaka says that at one time his wife 
Akiko was typical of many Japanese in America in that she had a hard time 
making friends: "She lived a very lonely life, initially. Then, when our kids 
went to school, we moved to Palos Verdes. It was a very small school and they 
needed the parents to help. My wife's language skills were not very good yet, 
so she worked in the school garden every day and got to know people through 
their children. But if we hadn't had kids, I would have had a very lonesome 
wife." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, he usually takes visitors to Nobu Matsuhisa's restaurant on La 
Cienega ("I admire him very, very much"), the expensive Sushi-Ko or the private 
zashiki rooms at Horikawa, good for business discussions. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually prefer either sushi or what we call kappo ryori. In Japanese, that 
means small dishes," says Takenaka. "It's like a series of appetizers that 
usually feature the vegetables and fish of the season. Because I travel so 
much, I need to balance my diet and with that kind of menu, it is much easier 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
If the visitors don't want Japanese food, Takenaka will probably take them to 
Lawry's The Prime Rib: "There's something that Japanese love about a big piece 
of meat." 
</P>
<P>
Some of his favorite restaurants, Takenaka keeps secret. "One of the problems 
with the Japanese is that they tend to do everything the same as everybody 
else," he says. "If someone says this is good, everybody wants it. If I took 
people to my favorite restaurants, I wouldn't be able to get in. I only take 
Americans or people from Japan who aren't going to remain here."

Jorge Santos says he learned the three keys to giving a successful party from 
his mother, a noted hostess in his native Antigua, Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
"Most important, always mix people," says Santos, who now lives in a spacious, 
art-filled home near Santa Monica Airport. "You have to remember that everyone 
is interested in what other people do, but if you just have doctors, all 
they'll talk about is surgery. If you just have businessmen, they'll talk about 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
"The second thing is to always have good music. That is why I have a dance 
floor in my living room, because when there is good salsa music, people are 
going to want to dance. They can't stand still. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, there must always be good food. And at my parties, I always serve the 
very best Guatemalan food, since I think it is truly one of the world's great 
cuisines and I am very proud of it." 
</P>
<P>
A typical menu at one of Santos' parties would include lengua de Rigoberto 
(tongue prepared in a way he learned from his grandmother's chef), a spicy 
estofado of chicken or pork, and then as a centerpiece, Guatemalan enchiladas 
-- dramatically different from the Mexican with a crispy fried tortilla topped 
by finely chopped, spiced pork and beef; a pickled salad, eggs, tomato sauce 
and queso de jalata. There might be pache, or tamales made from potato and 
steamed in platano leaves, a subtle stew called pepian and finally, for 
dessert, some bunuelos, hot from the fryer. 
</P>
<P>
Santos has his own line of Guatemalan-inspired napkins and place mats that are 
sold nationally in such high-end department stores as Gump's, Nieman Marcus and 
Bullock's as well as in smaller Southwest design-oriented shops such as 
Umbrello. 
</P>
<P>
"In Guatemala, we are very fortunate," he says. "We have borrowed from so many 
places. We have the sophistication of Europe, the comforts of America and the 
spice of the exotic from the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
"Guatemala was always called the 'silver cup' because it was so clean and so 
elegant. But Guatemala is a very difficult place to live in now. It was famous 
for its night life and for its social scene. Now you must be off the streets by 
6 p.m. No member of my family had ever left the country, but I told my father 
'I am like a bird, I must be free. If I stay here, I might as well be in a 
monastery'." 
</P>
<P>
Santos sees his style of entertaining as being a direct translation of what he 
learned at home. "My mother was a very beautiful lady and was very famous for 
being the best entertainer in Guatemala," he says. "The president, the 
ambassadors -- everybody came to her parties. 
</P>
<P>
"I love to give parties like that. I invite 75 or 100 people -- all kinds of 
people: doctors and lawyers and businessmen, and my Italian and French friends 
too -- and we have a lot of food and good music. Everybody shows up. I've never 
had a cancellation." 
</P>
<P>
For business entertaining, Santos prefers to go outside the home, taking people 
to some of his favorite restaurants: "You don't want to be intimidating in your 
home. In business, you can't always control who you're with."

Both Joel and Margaret Chen's families originally came from Shanghai. But there 
is much more of Hong Kong and Los Angeles in the way they entertain their 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
"We never entertain at home," says Joel, the owner of J.C. Chen Antiques, a 
stylish to-the-trade store on the high-rent end of Melrose. "I guess that comes 
from the time we lived in Hong Kong. You know, there living space is so small 
that there just isn't room. So you take your friends to restaurants. That's 
what we do here. 
</P>
<P>
"Dining is vital. Cuisine is a very important part of Chinese society. Chinese 
people eat all the time and we're very critical of our food." 
</P>
<P>
The restaurants the Chens choose depend on the company they are keeping. With 
their Los Angeles friends they go to places such as Patina, Maple Drive or 
Campanile. Lately, they've been at DC-3 a lot. "The decor is so unusual," says 
Joel, who is in his late 30s. "You really feel like you're in California." 
</P>
<P>
But when family members visit, the restaurants are more likely to be in 
Chinatown, Alhambra or Monterey Park. "We really like to go to Seafood City in 
Rosemead and the new Empress Pavilion in Chinatown, he says. "Usually, we order 
Cantonese. To me, it's a lot less oily. And we eat a lot of seafood and 
vegetables cooked in different ways. A lot of times, we specify no MSG. I like 
soup a lot, especially Hot Pot with Tofu. My wife doesn't like it but I win all 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
"We did try a Chinese imitation once -- we went to Chinois on Main -- and liked 
that a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Another place they take visitors from China is Lawry's The Prime Rib. "People 
from the Orient go for meat a lot," Joel says. "It really seems to be an 
essential part of the meal and Lawry's gives them a lot. It seems very English 
and very traditional. But other than that, we stay pretty Chinese. I don't 
think they'd understand Spago." 
</P>
<P>
Within their family, the Chens remain very Chinese. "Sometimes I feel like I'm 
very un-Chinese now," Joel says. "We still speak Chinese at home, though, and 
our two kids speak Chinese. Our parents are here and when we go out on the 
weekends with them, we tend to go for dim sum -- either the Empress Pavilion or 
(Monterey Park's) Harbor Village." 
</P>
<P>
Or they'll go shopping at stores such as Maxfield's. "We love to go to sales on 
the weekend," he says. "I hate to pay full price." 
</P>
<P>
Even after being in Los Angeles for 17 years, Joel Chen says most of the 
couple's friends are Chinese. "Our clients are all Caucasian, but we don't tend 
to socialize with them," he says. "I guess no matter how many years we've 
stayed here, we're basically very ethnic."

BLENDING THEIR ETHNIC ORIGINS AND FOOD PASSIONS, FOUR CHEFS CREATE VERSIONS OF 
THE ALL-AMERICAN SOUP AND SANDWICH THAT ARE SOPHISTICATED ENOUGH FOR A DINNER 
PARTY 
</P>

At one time, "soup and sandwich" meant tomato in a bowl and American cheese 
between slices of white bread. But that was before Southern California's 
current corps of chefs entered the scene. Blending their ethnic origins and 
passions with the all-American soup and sandwich, they came up with 
cross-pollinated hybrids sophisticated enough for even an elegant dinner party. 
But that's only one reason to prepare them. Another is just as telling: They 
taste sensational. 
</P>
<P>
Felix Salcedo of Sonora Cafe created a soup-and-sandwich menu that is 
distinctly southwestern. Or is it? The traditional flour-tortilla quesadilla is 
filled with American, Italian and French cheeses, spiked with sauteed Maui 
onions from Hawaii and sprinkled with fresh herbs that, presumably, are 
Californian. Serve it with two salsas, one of red chiles and one of cactus 
leaves. To go along, Tomato Sirloin Soup with Blue Corn Tortilla Chips combines 
traditional southwestern soup ingredients with slices of sirloin, stir-fried 
the Asian way. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Kang of Five Feet presents a dinner with a decidedly Asian influence 
but one with European inspiration. A julienne of colorful vegetables brings 
beauty to a light chicken stock. Ravioli-like dumplings made of won tons filled 
with goat cheese are creamy and sour-sweet. Kang suggests serving it with 
commercially made Chinese scallion cakes, split and filled with Chinese roast 
duck, shiitake mushrooms, pine nuts, sun-dried tomatoes and Parmesan cheese. 
The result is wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
The imaginative mind of Joachim Splichal of Patina came up with a very American 
corn chowder served with tiny corn fritters. As an accompaniment, he recommends 
a skewered sandwich of bacon, shrimp and lettuce that is deep fried until 
crunchy and served with fresh basil mayonnaise. 
</P>
<P>
From Hans Rockenwagner, owner-chef of FAMA and Rockenwagner, comes an elegant 
mixed-metaphor meal. The sandwich, which begins with Italian-inspired grilled 
polenta, is topped with lightly cooked, sushi-quality tuna, a Japanese 
inspiration. From India, a mango salsa, but one made with balsamic vinegar, is 
the perfect accompaniment. Serve it with Rockenwagner's delicious cold cucumber 
soup, topped with a scoop of sorbet-like frozen cucumber ice, liberally 
seasoned with sesame seeds, a common Asian ingredient.

OUR 16TH-ANNUAL WINE TASTING -- OF PINOT NOIR AND SAUVIGNON BLANC -- UNCOVERS 
BRIGHT NEW STARS PLUS SHARP VALUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Most everyone in the wine world -- consumers and producers alike -- knows that 
Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon are the most popular white and red table 
wines in America. Then why, for our 16th-annual Los Angeles Times wine tasting, 
did we choose to spotlight Sauvignon Blanc and Pinot Noir? 
</P>
<P>
European wine lovers, to whom Pinot Noir-born Burgundy is the undisputed king 
of all wines, and Cabernet Sauvignon the queen, might only wonder at the 
audacity of any competition from our young wine land of California. We dared, 
and in the judgment of our 18 panelists, all of professional standing, eight 
California Pinot Noir wines, from several regions, placed ahead of a 1985 
vintage Echezeaux jewel from the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti. 
</P>
<P>
And Sauvignon Blanc? This is the sole grape variety grown in the Loire Valley 
responsible for some of the most graceful white wines of France, Pouilly Fume, 
vines ribbing the hills of this chateau country of legendary history. It is 
also the dominant vine of French Graves, where its sauvage or bold character is 
forever tempered with varying amounts of softer, fruitier Semillon, the 
dominant grape of Sauternes. In the last few years, with decisive canopy 
management of the vines' luxuriant foliage, our viticulturists have made 
tremendous strides in taming the wild assertiveness of this varietal, and wine 
makers, too, have carefully etched a new personality for this less costly, but 
definite rival to the preeminence of Chardonnay at wine-selection time. 
</P>
<P>
These bright new stars, of engaging difference, none with outrageous 
grassiness, emerge from regions as diverse as Monterey and Mendocino counties, 
Lake County and Livermore, and of course, Napa, Sonoma, and the Central Coast 
regions. Among our 33 winners are some fabulous discoveries. Though the choices 
of our tasting jury may be controversial, treasures of taste abound in the 
following results, and the value scale is remarkable.

WALL STREET: BLAME PENSION FUNDS FOR STOCK MARKET VOLATILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CRUDELE, JOHN CRUDELE is a financial columnist for the New York Post. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If small investors want to end the stock market volatility that's being caused 
by program trading, they may have to stop complaining to their congressmen and 
stockbrokers and, instead, send angry letters to the guys who watch over their 
own pension money. 
</P>
<P>
Lost in the recent swell of anger over computerized program trading is the fact 
that without institutional investors (like insurance companies) and pension 
funds (like those that take care of the retirement money of millions of 
Americans), program trading would just disappear. 
</P>
<P>
"The little guy should understand that he is directly involved in program 
trading," says Jeffrey Tabak, a managing partner of Miller, Tabak &amp; Hirsch 
-- one of the first firms to use program trading in the early 1980s. Tabak does 
not, however, use the most despised type of program trading -- index arbitrage 
-- for its own money. 
</P>
<P>
A number of brokerages during the past week have joined Miller Tabak in no 
longer taking part in what is called "proprietary index arbitrage." That means 
these brokerages will not let their own money flow back and forth between the 
stock market and the stock index futures markets in order to profit from the 
small discrepancies between the two. 
</P>
<P>
That's good for a start. But it really won't make the market entirely stable -- 
not until institutional investors and pension funds also forsake index 
arbitrage. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to determine just how much of this dastardly index arbitrage is 
done by pension funds and other clients of brokerage firms. In September, the 
New York Stock Exchange reported that an average of 20.9 million shares of its 
total volume each day was connected with all sorts of program trading. 
</P>
<P>
About half of that amount -- or 10.45 million shares -- was computerized index 
arbitrage. And of the 10.45 million shares being index arbitraged, sources 
estimate that about two-thirds involve brokerages' own money. 
</P>
<P>
That would mean that pension funds and other "regular" people are trading more 
than 3 million shares of stock a day in the hated index arbitrage programs. 
</P>
<P>
While a two-thirds decline in the amount of index arbitrage trading will be a 
welcome relief for the beleaguered stock market, it doesn't mean that 
everything will be back to normal. In fact, if the institutions and pension 
funds try to trade their 3-million-share daily dose of index arbitraged stock 
all at once, the market could still easily come unglued. 
</P>
<P>
This past week, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton announced 
that they would stop doing index arbitrage for their clients. Only one other 
firm -- Paine Webber Group -- has gone that far. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of Wall Street's brokerages have taken the easy way out so far by 
forbidding their own money to be used for index arbitrage purposes. 
</P>
<P>
In taking action, Merrill Lynch said the public sees index arbitrage as a 
contributing factor to excess volatility in the stock market. So it will stop 
using the practice -- even for clients -- "until we are satisfied that 
effective controls are in place." 
</P>
<P>
Experts say one needed control is a "circuit breaker" that stops trading on the 
stock market and the stock index markets simultaneously. The New York Stock 
Exchange said it is looking into the matter. Right now, the stock index circuit 
breaker is tripped four times sooner than the circuit breaker that affects 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
And that just leads to panic on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
You didn't have to listen too carefully to the Wall Street grapevine these past 
few weeks to hear the rumor that Pennzoil Co. was accumulating shares of 
Chevron Corp. The rumor may or may not turn out to be true. 
</P>
<P>
But what's more intriguing than the rumor itself is how this particular gossip 
seems to have started. 
</P>
<P>
Corporations and raiders sometimes use what Wall Street refers to as a "beard," 
or intermediary, when they want to quietly buy stock in another company. The 
"beard," who is usually some little-known financial adviser in some obscure 
hamlet, places his purchase orders for the stock with various Wall Street 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
By doing this, the corporation or raider hopes to disguise its purchases so 
that Wall Street speculators won't get wind of the fact that the stock is being 
accumulated. This helps keep the price of the stock down and generally makes it 
a bigger surprise when the company or raider finally decides to pounce. 
</P>
<P>
The use of a beard is perfectly legal -- unlike the "parking" schemes that the 
government cracked down on these past few years. When the time comes to make a 
filing with the government on the stock purchases, the real owner -- not the 
beard -- finally comes forward. 
</P>
<P>
Now back to the origin of the rumor that Pennzoil is getting ready to attack 
Chevron. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Pennzoil accumulated a large stake in Burlington Resources 
Corp. Traders claim that the accumulation -- which was done very quietly -- was 
handled for Pennzoil by a beard named Robert Garrett, who runs a company called 
Garrett Associates in Skillman, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The Chevron rumor reportedly started weeks ago when, traders claim, Garrett 
started buying Chevron stock through as many as five different brokerages. 
Speculators reasoned that since Garrett, a former head trader for Morgan 
Guaranty Trust, had a history of working with Pennzoil, then Pennzoil must be 
the one for whom he was buying the Chevron stock. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street has become pretty convinced that someone has been accumulating 
shares of Chevron, and they think that the buyer is Pennzoil. But the truth is 
that nobody -- whether they are traders on Wall Street or members of the press 
-- really knows what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
All anyone knows is that trading in Chevron's stock has been peculiar. 
Chevron's shares are up 50% in value this year, and volume has been 
extraordinarily heavy. 
</P>
<P>
The best guess among experts is that Pennzoil is buying Chevron stock because 
it believes that this will help postpone a huge tax liability that Pennzoil 
could owe to the government. Pennzoil could have to pay an extra $800 million 
in taxes on its multibillion-dollar legal victory over Texaco, unless the 
billions are spent to acquire oil and natural gas properties before the end of 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street doesn't think that Chevron could be taken over. That would probably 
cost $40 billion, and it would be difficult to pull off the largest acquisition 
ever in the current economic environment. 
</P>
<P>
But if nothing else, it's good to know that a big company like Chevron could be 
shaken by something going on in a village like Skillman, N.J., population 
around 3,600. 
</P>
<P>
The deal to acquire UAL Inc. fell apart largely because Japanese banks didn't 
want to loan money to the prospective buyers. While that was a unique 
situation, it does raise the interesting question: What would happen if the 
Japanese suddenly decided that they not only didn't want to invest in things 
like the UAL takeover but also wanted no part of investing in the United 
States? 
</P>
<P>
Japanese investors are estimated to hold $80 billion in American securities and 
real assets. The United States government has been able to operate with a huge 
budget deficit because Japanese investors and other foreigners have been 
willing to send their money here for safe-keeping. 
</P>
<P>
The UAL deal could serve as a miniature lesson on just how important Japanese 
cooperation is to America's borrowing needs. 
</P>
<P>
"If there were a sudden decline in the Japanese demand for dollar securities, 
things would be bad," says Robert Z. Aliber, professor of international 
economics and finance at the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Just how badly does the United States need Japanese investment right now? "If 
they pull out, it's going to have a very negative effect," says Peter Rona, 
president of IBJ Schroder Bank and Trust, a unit of the Industrial Bank of 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Without the flow of Japanese investments, interest rates would go up, economic 
growth in the United States would decline and our standard of living could drop 
sharply. Some things could help alleviate the pain. Americans could save more 
and use that extra savings to invest in government bonds. (That's not likely.) 
Or the government could cut its budget deficit -- now estimated at $150 billion 
a year. (That's always difficult to accomplish.) 
</P>
<P>
Luckily for the United States, Aliber says, Japanese investors aren't likely to 
stop sending their money over here because there are few attractive 
alternatives. "They are making life easy for us, and we are making life easy 
for them. It's mutually advantageous," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Unless, of course, one day the Japanese suddenly decide not to invest any more 
in the UAL . . . uh . . . I mean the U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
New York investor Donald J. Trump last week was trying to raise money for a new 
offer for AMR Corp., according to a Wall Street source. The source didn't give 
details, but rumors said Trump was trying to put together a $95- to 
$100-a-share offer. Trump previously offered $120 a share for the airline 
company but then withdrew the bid before he ever raised a nickel. Wall Street 
is skeptical that Trump really wants to own AMR . . . 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are some very believable reports around Wall Street that 
investor Carl C. Icahn has been trying to raise the billions necessary to stage 
a credible threat to USX Corp. Icahn is said to be displeased with the 
restructuring that USX recently announced. Raising financing for a bid would be 
one of the only ways that Icahn would be able to convince Wall Street that he's 
capable of threatening the steel and energy company . . . 
</P>
<P>
Keep an eye on a "revolutionary" transaction (as several sources called it) 
that will soon come out of Gradco Systems Inc. Sources say the Irvine maker of 
paper-handling equipment will soon announce that it is going private, using 
financing raised in Japan. Gradco has publicly that it is considering becoming 
a private company, but the Japanese angle hasn't been disclosed. In essence, 
Gradco -- which does a lot of its business in Japan -- could end up changing 
from a publicly traded U.S. company to a Japanese one. And it could give other 
U.S. companies similar ideas.

NANCY REAGAN'S CRITICS TAKE TURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading "Her Turn" I feel compelled to point out a discrepancy in Mrs. 
Reagan's account of why she wrote her memoirs. She cites her sake, her 
children's sake and history's sake as reasons for writing her book. 
Conspicuously absent is Mrs. Reagan's bank account's need for the book. 
</P>
<P>
"Too much is going on right now" for Nancy to get involved in a drug center. 
Too busy ringing up her cash register, I guess. "Just Say No" kind of died 
after Reagan left office, but then again, most drug treatment centers are 
nonprofit, aren't they? 
</P>
<P>
A free house in Beverly Hills, $2 million to go to Japan and five-figure 
speaking fees. Who's kidding who? With her "Just Say No" program, Nancy Reagan 
expected ghetto children to work for minimum wage rather than make hundreds of 
dollars a day selling crack on the street. She doesn't seem to realize that she 
and these children have two things in common: greed and a lack of moral 
conscience.

A UNIFORM SOLUTION TO CLOTHING DILEMMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After observing the latest round of back-to-school shopping for preteen 
clothing, I would like to suggest a common-sense alternative to the ritualistic 
sparring between preteens and their parents over what is appropriate for young 
bodies ("Preteens' Clothing Choices: They're Dressed to Secede," Oct. 20). 
</P>
<P>
Schoolchildren in America should do what most European and Asian children do 
and wear uniforms to school each day. Uniforms save time and a lot of money for 
the parents; they promote some sense of purpose and fellow-feeling at school, 
and while they don't end competition for status among children, they do shunt 
it away from one obvious and costly arena.

<P>
After California's recent tragic disaster, it was just the right tonic to lift 
the spirits of the masses, a portrait of Nancy, and to know that after hundreds 
of thousands of dollars worth of free advertising she continues to live the 
life of luxury. Missing from her book are the 100-plus of Ronnie's appointees 
who were looting the government while the Reagans stood and watched.

S. EL MONTE RESIDENTS ARE FATALISTIC ABOUT THEIR SHAKY GROUND 
</P>

<P>
The way most residents figure it, you do what you can and try not to worry 
about what you can't. 
</P>
<P>
Wedged between the San Gabriel River and the Rio Hondo, the tiny San Gabriel 
Valley industrial city is built on sandy, alluvial ground -- "old riverbed," as 
Assistant City Manager Steve Henley decribes it. 
</P>
<P>
State experts say a major earthquake -- the Big One -- could liquefy the city's 
base, churning up the ground and the subterranean water table like a Manhattan 
in a cocktail shaker. 
</P>
<P>
"Most engineers we've talked to say there's not much we can do about it," says 
Henley, the city's emergency services coordinator. "The ground shakes, and the 
water and sand mix. The only thing we could do is excavate the sand, putting in 
a sturdier base, or get rid of the water. Neither are practical." 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable residents in this city of 19,800 tend to shrug off the extra 
dangers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned about it, but where can you go?" says Bill Keef, a 40-year 
resident. "I'm an aerospace engineer, and Southern California is where the 
money is. Oh, I could go out to the desert in Arizona or New Mexico, but what's 
there to do out there?" 
</P>
<P>
Seven miles east of downtown Los Angeles, South El Monte has more than 1,300 
businesses, one for every 15 residents. Companies such as chicken wholesalers 
Zacky Foods and Foster Farms and sportswear manufacturer Joni Blair have 
established home bases there because of the city's central location and its 
fiscal policies, with no property taxes, utility taxes or business license 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the city has also become a Latino enclave. Three-quarters of 
the population is Spanish-surnamed, according to city officials. Many are 
particularly worried about earthquake dangers. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of a lot of bad experiences by family members in Mexico City (during 
an 8.1-magnitude quake in 1985), they're more sensitive than a lot of other 
people," says Patrick Sayne, superintendent of the city's Valle Lindo School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
Still, residents have some reason for consolation. Although parts of the city 
are barely a mile from the epicenter of the Oct. 1, 1987, Whittier Narrows 
5.9-magnitude earthquake, damage was negligible. 
</P>
<P>
Damage in the city was so slight -- about $50,000 worth -- that the city had to 
return a $150,000 state disaster assistance loan that was rushed through after 
the quake. "Nobody ever qualified for the money," Henley said. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials say South El Monte escaped large-scale damage because it is a 
newer city than Whittier. "They have an older, more established type of town," 
says Mayor Albert Perez. "We only have a few homes built in the 1940s." 
</P>
<P>
Also, South El Monte has few buildings taller than one story. As Keef puts it, 
even if the ground suddenly turns swampy, "how far are you going to fall?" 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the city has made elaborate preparations for disaster. City Hall 
basement can be converted quickly into an emergency operations center, with a 
diesel-powered electrical generator, telephones, cots, blankets, enough food 
for 40 people for three weeks and a 16,000-gallon water tank. 
</P>
<P>
Schools keep similar supplies on hand. The two schools of the Valle Lindo 
district, for example, could feed and board their 1,100 students for a week, 
Supt. Sayne says. The schools, where student regularly undergo emergency 
drills, are linked by shortwave radio with county disaster centers. 
</P>
<P>
"We may be a little ahead of other districts," says Sayne. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross, the Los Angeles County Office of Education and City Hall have 
been spreading earthquake preparedness information for years, says Perez. "Our 
newsletter is mailed to all of our residents," he says, displaying the April 
issue containing a lengthy article on preparing for a major earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The word has gotten out. "I have canned food and bottled water, just in case," 
says Ignacia Escobedo. "What more can you do?"

NEIGHBORS OF FREEWAY SOUND OFF FOR A WALL 
</P>

<P>
After robbing a local supermarket some years ago, the suspect dashed past 
Francine Ryan's apartment building near the freeway, clambered over a 
chain-link fence and escaped in a getaway car down the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
On other occasions, motorists who ran out of gas on the San Bernardino Freeway 
would scale the fence, knock on doors at the Royal Gardens Apartments and ask 
to use the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"I have kids in the house," resident Christine Olguin said. "I can't open the 
door to just anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Olguin, Ryan and a dozen neighbors at the West Ramona Road apartment complex 
confronted transportation officials last week, demanding that the state install 
eight-foot walls between their buildings and the freeway, which is less than 50 
yards away. 
</P>
<P>
Residents say such a wall would reduce traffic noise as well as protect the 
neighborhood from unwanted visitors and cars that may careen off the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no denying that it's noisy," said Oscar C. Villacorte, a senior 
engineer for the state Department of Transportation. But he said the residents 
do not qualify for a sound wall because their building was erected after the 
freeway was. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify for a wall, the residents would have to get their state legislators 
to change the law, Villacorte said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if they can do that, they may still have a long wait, Villacorte said. 
More than 200 communities statewide are already on the waiting list for the 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Rotstan, a resident leading the fight for a wall, said he and his 
neighbors deserve to be at the top of the waiting list because, in addition to 
noise pollution, they also face safety problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Children climb over the fence," Rotstan said. "Cars almost careen through the 
fence." 
</P>
<P>
Most residents have at least two young children, Ryan said. It is impossible 
for parents to always keep an eye on them, especially since there are no locks 
on the building gates, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rotstan, who lived at the county-subsidized complex in the early 1980s and 
recently moved back, said he knew about the noise problem but, as with many of 
his neighbors, could not afford to live elsewhere. Residents pay rent on a 
sliding scale according to income. "We do not have a choice," said Elizabeth 
Mejia, a 24-year-old mother of two toddlers. "Our choice is to move here or be 
homeless." 
</P>
<P>
Although the buildings were designed so that no windows face the freeway, the 
rumbling of passing trucks -- and trains on tracks between the east and 
westbound lanes -- often shake the buildings, Mejia said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Duffy, an assistant to state Sen. Joseph Montoya (D-El Monte), said the 
senator has asked Caltrans for a report on the risks to residents' safety. 
</P>
<P>
The sound-wall waiting list is outdated because it does not take into account 
environmental changes since the freeway was built, Duffy said. For example, 
commuter bus lanes added in recent years have changed the environmental impact 
of the freeway, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Marta Maestas, a spokeswoman for Assemblyman Charles Calderon (D-Montebello), 
said Calderon will try to address the residents' concerns by focusing on the 
safety issues rather than their complaints about sound.

When Arcadia was incorporated in 1903, one of the first orders of business for

Clara Villa.

CAMPBELL SETS OFF SCRAMBLE WITH PLAN TO QUIT SENATE

<P>
Sen. William Campbell's surprise decision to step down from office is enticing 
San Gabriel Valley-area politicians to study voter registration figures and 
consult strategists to decide whether they should attempt a scramble up the 
political ladder. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of the Oct. 26 announcement by the Hacienda Heights Republican, 
Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier) jumped into the Senate race, prompting at 
least seven would-be candidates, including former Assemblyman Wayne Grisham, to 
consider whether to seek his Assembly job. 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), who is serving his 
third term in the lower house, announced he too would be a candidate for 
Republican Campbell's 31st Senate District seat. The sprawling district 
straddles parts of Southeast Los Angeles County, the San Gabriel Valley and 
stretches south to El Toro in Orange County. Among the district's registered 
voters, the GOP holds a 54% to 36% lead over the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Ferguson said that, in part, he was prompted to run 
because "Los Angeles-area lawmakers now dominate the Legislature" and that "no 
one from Orange County has ever represented the district," even though more 
than half the voters live there. 
</P>
<P>
At least two other Republicans are considering the race. One is Brea City 
Councilman Ron Isles, who last Monday said he is "95% certain" he will run for 
the Senate. The other is Diamond Bar City Councilman Gary Miller, who said he 
might enter the contest for the seat, which will become vacant in January. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said he has not made up his mind whether he would endorse a candidate 
to succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
Isles, 51, said he is willing to spend $500,000 of his own money on the 
campaign. In a statement, he indicated ethics could be an issue, warning that 
"the candidates who decide to enter this contest better not be carrying any 
political baggage." In an interview, Isles said the statement was not aimed at 
Ferguson or Hill. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Ferguson, 66, failed to properly report some of his personal income 
and amended his economic disclosure statement after newspaper stories revealed 
the discrepancy. The Fair Political Practices Commission is investigating the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, 35, is one of the five elected state officials who are targets of an 
ongoing FBI investigation into political corruption in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, who previously had been advised not to make statements to the media about 
the investigation, said last Tuesday: "I know as much about it as I read in the 
newspapers. I haven't done anything wrong, and I'm running." 
</P>
<P>
The four-term lawmaker said he has no idea whether the FBI probe will be a 
campaign issue. "I get the sense that it's something in the past," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Democrat Janice Lynn Graham, 53, who last year ran for Campbell's seat, 
maintained that Hill "has a cloud over his head with the FBI . . . that might 
create a problem for him." Graham, a retired businesswoman and teacher from 
Laguna Hills, said she is exploring whether to seek the office, despite losing 
to Campbell by a wide margin. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell's Senate seat and Hill's Assembly seat are regarded by campaign 
consultants as relatively safe for the GOP because registered Republicans 
outnumber Democrats in both districts. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats acknowledge that capturing either district would be a long shot. But 
privately, several Democratic legislative staffers say the party might be 
willing to pump money into a campaign if Assemblywoman Lucy Killea (D-San 
Diego) wins a December special election in what is also regarded as a safe 
Republican Senate district in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell officially steps down in January and the secretary of state's office 
said Gov. George Deukmejian could call the primary in March or April with a 
runoff, if necessary, in May or June. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state's office said Hill or Ferguson could file for reelection 
to the Assembly while campaigning for the Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, who estimates that he has $260,000 in his Assembly war chest, said he is 
undecided whether he will seek both seats at the same time. If he ran for 
reelection to the Assembly and won, a special election for his seat might not 
be held for another year, according to state election officials. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of campaign contribution limits approved last year by voters on the 
special election is also unclear. 
</P>
<P>
In Hill's district, registered Republicans outnumber Democrats 48% to 43%. The 
district includes Walnut, La Habra Heights, La Mirada, a large part of 
Whittier, Diamond Bar, Hacienda Heights, Rowland Heights and parts of Industry, 
West Covina and South Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier) said Democrats in the past have "busted our 
pick" trying to get a Democrat elected in the district. "It still seems pretty 
much like a safe Republican district." 
</P>
<P>
Among the Republicans lining up for Hill's seat, Grisham, 66, is the most well 
known. A former La Mirada city councilman, Grisham represented part of the 
district during two terms in Congress from 1978-82. After losing his 
congressional seat and serving as a Peace Corps official, Grisham established a 
voting residence in Norwalk. He won two elections to the 63rd Assembly 
District, but last year narrowly lost a reelection bid. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, a former Grisham aide, maintained that his one-time boss must "be 
considered the front-runner. He's going to raise some money and he's got a base 
of support. He's never had a negative campaign in this district." 
</P>
<P>
Grisham, who has been serving as a broker in his son's real estate office, 
confirmed he is "seriously considering" making another political comeback. 
Grisham pointed out that Hill's Assembly district encompasses half of his old 
congressional district. 
</P>
<P>
Also considering the race is Walnut Mayor Drexel Smith, a 43-year-old 
Republican. Smith, who is running for reelection to the City Council, said: 
"I'm looking at it as an option and an opportunity that needs to be evaluated." 
</P>
<P>
If Hill does not seek reelection, Diamond Bar City Councilman Paul Horcher, 38, 
said he will definitely be a candidate for the Assembly. Ken Manning, 38, a 
member of the Hacienda-La Puente Unified School District, said there is a 
strong possibility he, too, will be a candidate for the lower house. 
</P>
<P>
Another Republican regarded as a potential candidate is Barbara Shell Stone of 
Whittier. But last Wednesday, Stone, who finished second to Hill in the 1982 
GOP primary, said: "There's no opening so I'm not going to deal with it. . . . 
That's not appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
Other Republicans who say they might be interested in seeking Hill's seat 
include Dan Pellissier, 29, of Whittier, a former aide to Grisham and to Sen. 
Minority Leader Ken Maddy (R-Fresno), who is now a public affairs analyst with 
Southern California Gas Co.; Tony Russo, 26, a former aide to Hill and Grisham 
now serving as chief of staff to Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), and 
Ray Andersen, 33, of Diamond Bar, a former deputy to County Supervisor Pete 
Schabarum. 
</P>
<P>
Also mentioned as a possible candidate is Democrat Terry Lee Perkins of Walnut, 
who lost to Hill in 1988.

ENCOUNTER WITH THE GUARDIAN ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clay Evans' story on the Guardian Angels (Times, Oct. 19) leads me to tell you 
of a household experience with these remarkable young people. Last Dec. 29, my 
wife, Vada, fell and cracked her head against a curb, was found lying in the 
street bleeding profusely by a young woman named Susan Youel. She called the 
paramedics (Unit 68) who took her to the emergency entrance of Midway Hospital 
Medical Center, where she was given nine stitches and, in her woozy, bewildered 
state, was sent out into the night without a taxi being called or any attempt 
to call home for someone to come for her. 
</P>
<P>
Wandering in the dark, a youngster she knows only as "Bill" found her and told 
her he always wanted to be a Guardian Angel, but was turned down for being too 
small and the streets were too tough for him. He volunteered to take her to a 
Guardian Angel friend to prove he could do "rescue things," and that maybe the 
Guardian Angels would reconsider his candidacy. My wife went along, and the 
Guardian Angel she met was Malcolm Ratliff, who was "off duty" in Westwood and 
did not have his identifying uniform. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm saw before him a 78-year-old woman, 5 feet tall, covered in blood, the 
whole right side of her face a great red splotch. And she was in the hands of 
two black youngsters. Were the police to show up, would they come to a quick 
conclusion that they were the ones who had abused her? Malcolm acted coolly, 
got the address of our home and, having been a "missing person" for 19 hours, 
she was delivered to our door -- safely. 
</P>
<P>
The incident, according to Dr. Michael Vitulio of the Midway Hospital Medical 
Center, caused a top-to-bottom revision of that facility's policy toward 
emergency cases -- no release until spliced into a responsible contact. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine the incredible chain of coincidences -- starting with the Guardian 
Angels dream of little "Bill," that saw my wife Vada through! 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday night, the Guardian Angels had a receiving line at a Hollywood 
theater, and at the head of the line was Steve Kirkman, the one in Clay Evans' 
story and head of the Los Angeles Guardian Angels. He told me Malcolm wants to 
be a Los Angeles policeman one day and, if that is his choice, I'm going to 
support his candidacy any way I can. Around our house, though, there is still 
the problem of never having been able to identify that street kid named Bill, 
to whom the Guardian Angels were a dream and who, by showing up when he did, 
averted what could have been an awful fate for that lady who's been around and 
with me in 77 countries for more than 54 years! 
</P>
<P>
I don't know how things will turn out for a West Hollywood perplexed about how 
to deal with its dangerous "eyesore" problem, but the Guardian Angels are owed 
a lot by one couple in Westwood!

TOWN HALL MEETING FOR LIGHT RAIL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It must be very clear by now that Westsiders and other Los Angeles citizens are 
keenly interested in the purchase of the rail lines currently for sale to local 
counties surrounding Southern California. From all the letters written recently 
in response to the grossly slanted Rancho Park "community meeting" in 
September, we can see it is necessary to hold more forums on the subject. It is 
especially important that these forums present both sides of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
As suggested in an earlier letter, just such a town hall meeting will be held 
at the Palms Junior High School auditorium on the evening of Nov. 16. The 
meeting will host a panel of five people representing both pro and con on light 
rail for Los Angeles. I suggest that the many hundreds of concerned people who 
care about this issue attend. The event is sponsored and endorsed by homeowners 
groups, senior citizens and environmentalists, to mention but a few. At this 
meeting half the evening will be devoted to dialogue between those attending 
and the panelists. Any other experts who wish to attend and act as resource 
people are encouraged to contact the Westside Greens at (213) 31G-reens.

AROUND THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY: A WOULD-BE APPLICANT FOR CITY ADMINISTRATOR 
FINDS THERE'S MORE TO THE JOB THAN RUNNING THE CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Try to imagine, if you will, that you work in city government in a small town 
in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Let's say you are city manager of Lake Beaujolais, a hamlet of 25,000 or so 
nestled between wineries and vineyards in the mythical county where "Falcon 
Crest" is filmed. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from once-a-year location shooting by the television crews, it's a quiet 
life in Lake Beaujolais. As long as yuppies keep drinking, the tax revenue is 
pretty steady. Biggest crime is the occasional house draped with toilet paper 
after a high school football game. 
</P>
<P>
Controversy? Well, people still talk about the nude photograph that won the 
Lake Beaujolais Art Festival in 1975. But all in all, a quiet life. A nice 
place to spend your life -- unless you are an ambitious city manager, which you 
are. You've been in Lake Beaujolais oh, five or six years, and it's time to 
move on to a bigger city. 
</P>
<P>
You hear there's an opening in Pomona. That's appealing. Pomona, after all, has 
a population of 120,000. In some states that would be considered a city of some 
magnitude. But Pomona is on the eastern edge of Los Angeles County, so it's 
often subsumed into the megalopolis. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a good-size place. It has both urban problems, including a burgeoning 
crime rate and gang activity, and the challenge of growth, with people and 
businesses moving from Los Angeles and the west toward affordable housing and 
land to the east. There's a lot going on in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
You're bright, you have ideas, you're politically savvy. An ideal city manager, 
really. You like the look of this place. City administrator of Pomona. Sounds 
very appealing. You decide to give Pomona a closer look. 
</P>
<P>
First question: How did this opening come about? Was it someone like you, 
moving on to a bigger challenge in a larger city? A homesick Midwesterner 
looking for a life-style change? A retirement, perhaps? 
</P>
<P>
You head over to the public library to look at the newspaper file. Here's what 
you find: 
</P>
<P>
The city administrator, A. J. Wilson, was fired last May, soon after a City 
Council election formed a new majority. The 20-year government veteran had been 
hired 13 months earlier on the strength of his reputation as a forceful leader 
who had tackled urban decay and economic stagnation. 
</P>
<P>
His interim replacement, Andrew Lazzaretto, quit after little more than a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
His replacement, Tom Fee, continues in his full-time job of fire chief while 
managing the city. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant, the leader of the majority, came up 
with the idea that a good way to save money would be to cut or eliminate 
employee benefits. His term for benefits like tuition and executive leave was 
"fat." 
</P>
<P>
In the last two months, the city attorney and the public works director have 
quit. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, council members announced that they had heard from patrol 
officers that mid-rank police officers have exerted so much authority over 
patrol officers that many have avoided taking any action on their own for fear 
of making a mistake and being disciplined. Bryant quoted one patrol officer as 
saying he was so petrified that he spends most of his shift sitting in his 
police car reading a magazine, unless he is specifically ordered to a crime 
scene. The council concluded somebody should get fired. Police Chief Richard M. 
Tefank, who had been been with the department for 18 years, refused to fire his 
middle management staff. The council fired Tefank. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, after the police union voted to protest the Tefank firing by joining 
a move to recall Bryant, Bryant publicized one of the officers' private medical 
records. 
</P>
<P>
A day later, a deputy city attorney sent in his resignation by fax. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona council members have referred to themselves as the best show in town.

ANOTHER VIEW OF POMONA URGED

<P>
I protest the demeaning of Pomona as a crime-ridden and poverty-stricken city 
(Times, Oct. 29). 
</P>
<P>
You only glorify the crime. Your staff writers need to give both views of 
Pomona and not constantly state that minorities are always the cause of crime 
and violence. 
</P>
<P>
The middle class still lives in Pomona maintaining nice homes and careers. 
Write something for once about Pomona that is positive.

SUPERMARKET DELAY IS CENTRAL ISSUE IN DUARTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANGEL D. AYALA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Kirchner and Lino S. Paras are challenging incumbents John E. Hitt, Terry 
Michaelis and John Van Doren for seats on the Duarte City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The central issue in the campaign has been the City Council's efforts to bring 
a major supermarket to Duarte. Last month, city officials announced that a 
Ralphs market will open in mid-1990 at the site of the old Gemco store on 
Huntington Drive. The challengers have said the council took too long to lure a 
supermarket to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Kirchner said the council knew of the need for a supermarket long before Gemco 
closed two years ago but that it was not responsive to that need. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbents say the council began the search for a supermarket even before Gemco 
closed and that preparations, such as acquiring the land and interviewing 
potential tenants, went on long before a deal was finalized. The delay resulted 
from doubts on the part of supermarket officials that a Duarte store would 
attract enough shoppers, incumbents said. 
</P>
<P>
Hitt, 44, a financial planner and resident of Duarte for nine years, emphasized 
doing more to control the city's crime, drug and gang problem as well as 
enhancing the quality of life. He has been mayor for the last two years and is 
seeking his second term in office. 
</P>
<P>
Proposing that the city work more with local groups and allow the town center 
to be used free of charge, Kirchner, 44, said he seeks a community atmosphere 
in the city. Chairman of the Planning Commission and a Duarte resident for 
seven years, Kirchner is a computer services manager and president of the 
Duarte Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Michaelis, 44, proposes working with neighboring cities to get rid of 
crime in unincorporated areas of lower Duarte and helping residents pay for 
pipe damage from pinhole leaks in the city's water system. Michaelis has lived 
in Duarte for 10 years and has been mayor pro tem for the last two years. He 
owns his own accounting firm and is seeking his second term. 
</P>
<P>
Paras, 43, is controller of a manufacturing company in Montebello and has lived 
in Duarte for four years. In addition to wanting more honesty in city 
government, he said he would oppose a buildup of multi-unit housing in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
John Van Doren, 46, has served on the council for more than 11 years and was 
mayor in 1986-87. He is a sales representative and has lived in Duarte for 17 
years. Van Doren said he wants the city to fix leaking pipes and said he would 
attend to problems of traffic congestion and the resulting pollution.

WALNUT CAMPAIGNS SHOW MUCH CIVILITY, LITTLE DISAGREEMENT 
</P>

WALNUT 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an election devoid of mudslinging and negative advertisements, each of the 
five candidates for City Council is politely trying to carve out his identity. 
</P>
<P>
That may be hard to do. All the candidates -- Mayor Drexel Smith, Greg 
Arakelian, Dr. William Choctaw, Bernard (Joe) Margowsky and Dave Weigand -- say 
they want to control residential development, preserve the equestrian 
atmosphere of Walnut and bring more businesses to the city. At a candidates' 
forum last month, there weren't any heated arguments, and the five often echoed 
each others' positions. 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't really any killer issues," Weigand said recently. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the only controversy that surfaced was in the form of a press release 
mailed to local newspapers by Arakelian's campaign manager disputing Choctaw's 
claims that Mt. San Antonio College's bookstore is the largest generator of 
sales tax revenue in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates prefer to quietly emphasize their differences. Mayor Smith, who is 
seeking a third term, said that after the election, at least three council 
members will have less than a year of experience and the city would need 
someone with his extensive background. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the only candidate that really has the . . . experience," Smith said. 
Smith, an executive with Wyle Laboratories, a high-technology research firm, 
has been on the council since 1982 and served as planning commissioner from 
1979-82. His fellow council members have elected him mayor three times. 
</P>
<P>
Arakelian, a partner in an Irvine architectural firm, said his interest in city 
government began earlier this year when city residents successfully fought a 
plan to build a chemical storage and distribution plant in Industry, near the 
Walnut city border. Arakelian participated in a citizens' group that lobbied 
the Environmental Protection Agency, the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District and the fire marshal against the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Choctaw said that because of his experience as planning commissioner, "I'm more 
qualified that the others are, with the exception of Mayor Smith. Drexel and I 
are the best candidates for the job. We know what the city needs." 
</P>
<P>
At the candidates' forum, he said Walnut's future economic woes could be solved 
if a University of California campus were located in the city, possibly near 
Mt. San Antonio College. He said the largest portion of the city's sales tax 
revenue comes from Mt. SAC's bookstore, and he supports the concept of a 
"university park" where resources and facilities would be shared by a number of 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Margowsky, president of Aims Marketing Inc. in San Dimas, said because of his 
background in business and management, "bottom-line budgeting is something I've 
had to deal with for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Margowsky said that if elected, he would exercise greater control over 
residential development in the city and call for a temporary moratorium on the 
construction of new homes. He said he has received calls from several 
homeowners complaining about haphazard development in Walnut that wasn't 
closely scrutinized while in the planning stages. 
</P>
<P>
Weigand, who works in the maintenance department of the Fullerton Union High 
School District, said he wants to continue the good work the city has done and 
would encourage citizens to get involved in volunteer work. He is a member of 
Walnut's emergency response team, belongs to the Elks Club and is a trustee of 
the Walnut United Methodist Church. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe this is a good community," he said. "And I'm a firm believer 
in community service."

MORALE, ETHNIC SPLIT KEYS TO COLLEGE RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICKI TORRES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Low teacher morale, high enrollments and an Anglo-Latino political split are 
some of the issues dominating Board of Trustee election races in three San 
Gabriel Valley community college districts. 
</P>
<P>
After 85% of instructors surveyed at Citrus Community College District in 
Glendora said morale had declined, the issue has come to dominate the two races 
in the 10,000-student district, which encompasses Glendora, Azusa, Monrovia, 
Duarte and Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
In Azusa, Area No. 1, seven-year incumbent Gary Woods, 45, of Azusa, an 
attorney and law professor at Pasadena City College, blames labor negotiations 
for low morale. The challengers, Armando Camarena and Lawrence Sowers, said 
board members are out of touch with the district's teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Camarena, 42, of Azusa, is an account executive and former Azusa city 
councilman. Sowers is a research scientist at the City of Hope National Medical 
Center in Duarte and a former faculty member at Duke and Harvard universities. 
</P>
<P>
In Duarte, Area No. 2, board President Edward Ortel, 50, of Duarte, a Pasadena 
City College business professor and a 20-year board member, is seeking 
reelection. He blames low morale on the lack of state funds for the last two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
His opponent, Angelo Diaz, a printer from Duarte, has not appeared at candidate 
forums. 
</P>
<P>
Voters in the 21,000-student Pasadena Area Community College District, 
encompassing La Canada Flintridge, Altadena, Pasadena, San Marino and South 
Pasadena, will cast ballots in four races, three of them uncontested, to fill 
vacancies on the seven-member board. 
</P>
<P>
The contested race is in Area 5, which comprises South Pasadena and San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Warren Weber, 59, of San Marino, a retired businessman with 12 years 
on the board, faces challenger Robert Almanza, 58, of San Marino, dean of 
academic affairs at East Los Angeles College. Almanza has said Weber's failure 
to promote the college locally has caused high enrollments of Los Angeles-area 
residents, but Weber said the enrollments merely indicate strong course 
offerings. 
</P>
<P>
In the Rio Hondo Community College District, where 12,000 students attend 
classes in Whittier, voters in El Monte, South El Monte, Pico Rivera, Whittier 
and Santa Fe Springs, are watching a politically charged race. Two Latino board 
members not up for election, Bill Hernandez and Ralph Pacheco, are supporting 
candidates in three races, hoping to gain a board majority. 
</P>
<P>
In El Monte, Area 1, the two are backing attorney David Flores, 33, of El 
Monte, a contract negotiator with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, 
against board President Hilda Solis, 32, of El Monte. Solis is director of a 
nonprofit educational program for college-bound high school students. 
</P>
<P>
Also running is Elizabeth Van Note, 49, of El Monte, director of administrative 
services with the city of Bell and a former Rio Hondo board member in 1979, who 
said she is independent of the board's political split.

FILMS: HIDDEN AWAY IN ROOMS, LOFTS AND SOUND STAGES IS AN UNSEEN COLLECTION OF 
"SET DRESSINGS" -- FURNITURE, TOASTERS, EVEN LIVE BIRDS, THAT CREATE REALITY 
FOR THE MOVIE CAMERA.

</HEADLINE>

<P>
At first glance, Roger Shook looks to be the owner of an enormous secondhand 
store. "Las Vegas lounge chairs? We've got dozens," he says, gesturing broadly 
in the direction of a seemingly endless row of furniture. "They're right next 
to the round hotel-lobby sofa that looks like a giant orange-juice squeezer." 
</P>
<P>
A request for toasters is answered by a display of two dozen, ranging from 
something grandma might have used to futuristic models. Overhead, chandeliers 
hang lifeless, waiting to shine on the next make-believe dinner party. "And in 
this room," he says proudly, as if introducing something new to the world, 
"we've got rings, silverware, jewelry . . . wait, here's something, a Bon Ami 
cleanser can from the 1930s." 
</P>
<P>
What's going on here? Why is there a futuristic ray gun lying next to a 
coonskin cap? And where did Shook get that green freeway sign that says, 
"Welcome to Cleveland"? 
</P>
<P>
This is an unusual store -- one not open to the public -- where nothing can be 
bought, only rented or borrowed, and the merchandise is in great demand by all 
who enter. It is the prop department of Buena Vista Studios in Burbank, home of 
Walt Disney Productions. Most everything -- except the freeway sign -- is a 
leftover from a forgotten old production. 
</P>
<P>
Hidden away in prop rooms, lofts and sound stages, here at Universal and the 
Burbank Studios, is an unseen collection of "stuff," the tools of an unusual 
trade -- called set dressing -- used to create reality for a movie camera. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the pieces, stacked from floor to ceiling, are no more famous than many 
of the people who try to break into the movies. Tucked away here and there, 
amid the refrigerators and lounge chairs, are some real gems, most having 
escaped destruction not because of their history -- many prop and wardrobe 
people are unaware of or unconcerned about the origin of their inventories -- 
but because they are still useful. 
</P>
<P>
Like the ray gun, used by James Mason, and the coonskin cap, worn by Fess 
Parker. 
</P>
<P>
The ray gun, which upon close inspection is nothing but a crude assembly of 
various diameter pipes, washers and fittings glued to a roughly carved trigger, 
dates to 1954 and Disney's first full-length non-animated feature, "20,000 
Leagues Under the Sea," and was one of a dozen guns used by Captain Nemo's 
underwater navy. And the coonskin cap? Years before John Wayne played Davy 
Crockett at the Alamo, Fess Parker was his TV version in 1955 and 1956. 
</P>
<P>
There are about a dozen other pieces of historical significance in the prop 
department, which Shook says contains more than 2 million items. These include 
a pair of 25-year-old parrot-head umbrellas from "Mary Poppins"; two swords 
from the "Zorro" TV series, starring Guy Williams from 1957 to 1960; a 
specially made red plush Victorian sofa used in Captain Nemo's submersible in 
"20,000 Leagues," and a working flintlock rifle, used by Fess Parker's 
Crockett. 
</P>
<P>
Although Shook, who is manager of production facilities and the property 
department at Disney, is sure which production each piece came from, their 
history before Disney acquired them is murky. 
</P>
<P>
The Zorro weapons, he said, "could just be cheap swords. They don't have to be 
like fine pieces of machinery. But the flintlock is. It's an authentic piece 
bought back in the '50s. Who knows where they got it?" 
</P>
<P>
At Universal Studios, the prop department's Burt Cohen, 56, has a similar 
set-dressing inventory of more than 1 million items. Universal doesn't have 
dozens of Las Vegas lounge chairs, but it does have rows of pink-colored '50s 
hair dryers used in "Grease" in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
There are also a few pieces of genuine pre-Columbian art, some knickknacks from 
Charlie Chan movies of the '30s and '40s, a pair of antique vases valued at 
$30,000 and a pair of live parakeets, held for whenever Angela Lansbury is 
shooting "Murder, She Wrote." "She's crazy about those birds," Cohen said, "so 
we keep them when they don't need 'em." Various busts are scattered about, 
including one of Einstein which is keeping company with Bill Cosby on the movie 
set of "Ghostdad." 
</P>
<P>
Nudging past a full-size grand piano, made entirely of balsa so one person 
could seem to show incredible strength (for a movie no one at Universal can 
recall), and a stuffed dummy of Bigfoot used in "Harry and the Hendersons," 
Cohen surveys his acres of props. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost all furniture of one form or another," he said. This includes the 
chair in which Mother Bates rocked back and forth in 1960 for "Psycho," as well 
as the specially made butcher knife son Norman was so adept at using. On the 
blade, hidden from the camera, was a copper tube that was connected to a rubber 
bulb on the handle. When Tony Perkins went slashing, he squeezed the bulb and 
"blood" spurted out. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the back lot is "The War Wagon," the principal prop in a 1967 John 
Wayne Western of the same name: an armored, windowless stagecoach designed to 
haul gold bullion. Now horseless, with its top gun turret gone and the plywood 
that stood in for steel aging poorly in the sun, "The War Wagon" sits placidly 
by the side of one of the tram-tour roads, hardly receiving mention from tour 
guides. 
</P>
<P>
Farther up the Universal hill, hidden in the dark interior of an adobe church 
in a Western town, is another almost-forgotten relic. Surrounded by countless 
cowboy props and buggy whips, covered with a heavy veneer of modern-day dust, 
is a Roman-era chariot just begging for a wash and wax and Kirk Douglas to hop 
on, grab the reins and lead the gladiators to victory in 1960s "Spartacus." 
</P>
<P>
At the Burbank Studios, Bill McLaughlin, 51, has the chandeliers from Rick's 
Cafe Americain in "Casablanca," the 1942 classic, and a throne chair and 
painting of Errol Flynn from "The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex," 
released half a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a curator," said McLaughlin, who is the property department manager. 
"This is a working prop department. Most of the older props that are around and 
still functioning have been reworked, re-upholstered and repainted. They're not 
in their original form. This stuff isn't furniture; it's working stock for the 
decorators." Their collection of props numbers about 1.5 million pieces. 
</P>
<P>
If what makes a piece of furniture or clothing valuable is who owned or wore 
it, the Burbank Studios has found a number of "classic" pieces in its wardrobe 
department. The department was described simply as "nine acres of clothes" by 
Jered Green, the acting department manager. The Burbank Studios has been the 
combined production facility of Columbia and Warner Bros. since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the clothing for the ample Sidney Greenstreet -- the heavy in "The 
Maltese Falcon," "The Hucksters" with Clark Gable and Rick's friend in 
"Casablanca" -- is still around, said Green, 37, because Greenstreet's size 
demanded tailor-made clothes. 
</P>
<P>
More diminutive items in the collection include a couple of pairs of pants worn 
by James Dean in 1955, his Levi's from "Rebel Without a Cause" and a pair of 
camel-colored slacks from "East of Eden." 
</P>
<P>
There's an orange chiffon dress Shirley Jones wore in 1962's "The Music Man," 
and a velvet evening gown Elizabeth Taylor slinked around in has been preserved 
since "Giant" was released in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more bizarre articles of clothing is a wedding gown covered with 
pumpkin seeds and a gold crown, worn in 1967 by Vanessa Redgrave in "Camelot." 
</P>
<P>
But props and wardrobes with a high historical value for film fans are usually 
mixed in with the run-of-the-mill items, and with every studio actively 
soliciting independent production rental of their inventories, many have fallen 
victim to breakage, auctions and, in some cases, theft. 
</P>
<P>
And as the movie business has changed, so have the property and wardrobe 
departments. When the studio system was operating, little left the confines of 
the lot. With the rapid shift toward independent production, most studios are 
eager to rent their wares to qualified companies, with an average of 20% to 30% 
of their business coming from the outside. The weekly fee is a percentage of 
the item's value. 
</P>
<P>
Although Disney's coonskin cap isn't for rent, the Victorian sofa James Mason 
enjoyed in "20,000 Leagues" goes for about $200 a week. The "War Wagon" at 
Universal might run about $650 per week. The "Spartacus" chariot is a real 
steal at $250 a week. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to save everything that's good," Shook said. "But people can misuse 
them, or something is accidentally dropped and broken beyond repair. Some have 
just rotted into disuse." There are items, such as the historically valuable 
parrot-head umbrellas, that Shook says he will never rent out. Others, such as 
the "20,000 Leagues" ray guns and Davy Crockett's coonskin cap, have been 
assigned to the archive department for safekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes a big actor or actress says, 'I really want this piece,' " Shook 
said. "Then the producer comes to us and says, 'We really want to give this 
piece to him.' A lot of the pieces are lost that way."

SPEAKING OUT: NO STICKER SHOCK FOR EX-ANGELENO

<P>
We knew we had really left Los Angeles the first time we skipped down a flight 
of stairs to examine a finished basement. 
</P>
<P>
And the second time and the third and the 14th and 40th times. 
</P>
<P>
And we really knew we were back on the Other Coast when we ventured into 
relatively expansive back yards that were lush and green, sans sprinklers, but 
also bereft of palms and citrus trees. And, under gray skies, our clothes clung 
to us with the humidity of it all. 
</P>
<P>
We had arrived in the Big Muggy, the nation's capital, in late August, feeling 
flush with cash that was, in fact, not yet officially ours from the sale of our 
modest Sherman Oaks home. But we were in the promised land -- in escrow on one 
coast and looking to enter it on the other. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming from Los Angeles, real estate prices here won't shock you," a 
Washington real estate broker had written to us before our arrival. "In fact, 
nothing is likely to shock you." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. The day before we departed, we visited a friend who had broken her toe 
stumbling over her Jacuzzi, pure pool-side pathos. During a farewell dinner at 
a trendy Santa Monica restaurant, we found ourselves surrounded by Michael 
Keaton, Rosanna Arquette, the model Iman and designer Diane von Furstenberg, 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, my wife, Katherine, gleefully tossed the "Seven-Day Earthquake 
Survival Guide" and donated the gallons of emergency water to the thirsty 
movers. 
</P>
<P>
And, on our final night, I feverishly dreamed I had written a TV movie that was 
so awful that I knew it was time to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Washingtonians, like Southern Californians, tend to expect newcomers to suffer 
sticker shock. Many were surprised, even nonplussed, when we stood their 
expectations on their head and told them that the D.C. housing dollar stretches 
further here than whence we came. 
</P>
<P>
During the course (or as Katherine felt by the end, curse) of looking at more 
than 75 houses in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia, we found 
that you can indeed buy more house on more land for less money, especially if 
you are willing to go somewhat farther from the marble halls of power and the 
downtown heart of employment. 
</P>
<P>
For $325,000, you can find attractive, if smallish, two- or three-bedroom homes 
in middle-class neighborhoods of Northwest Washington or just over the line in 
fashionable Bethesda, Md. If you have your heart set on Chevy Chase, one of 
Maryland's choicest addresses, appealing homes can be had for $450,000 or so -- 
the equivalent of a starter place on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
The median price of existing single-family homes in the D.C. area reached 
$139,900 in the second quarter of this year, the 10th highest price in the 
nation, according to a survey by the National Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
This compares to a median price of $218,000 in Los Angeles and $247,600 in 
Orange County. These figures are driven down by the inclusion of townhouses as 
well as properties in more far-flung, less expensive suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
We had sold our two-bedroom, 1,500-square-foot Sherman Oaks home for a sum in 
the mid-$300,000 range following two years of soaring appreciation -- and even 
as the midyear stagnation began to grip the market. 
</P>
<P>
We opted to buy a considerably larger home farther out in the suburbs that 
surround the highly efficient Metro line. Farther out by Washington standards 
is a trip to the neighborhood mini-mall for many Angelenos. 
</P>
<P>
We eventually settled on the area around Vienna, Va., the last stop on the 
Metro. Some longtime Washingtonians think of Vienna as a distant horizon, but 
it's only 15 miles from the city center, or a 25-minute subway ride. 
</P>
<P>
Our search concluded with a painful decision involving pleasant alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
House No. 1 was a four-bedroom brick Colonial -- imposing from the street -- 
with a large deck facing a small, strikingly picturesque lake. The subdivision 
included tennis courts, a swimming pool, a basketball court and a jogging path 
around the lake. The lake's residents include bass and a beaver; deer roam the 
nearby woods. 
</P>
<P>
The asking price, clearly inflated, was $349,000. Was this housing heaven? 
</P>
<P>
Not quite. Unfortunately, the rooms were too small. It was, our broker said, 
like a piece of clothing that was too tight: every way you turn, you're 
slightly uncomfortable. Worse, the house was a standard model that failed to 
take advantage of the potentially spectacular lake-side views. 
</P>
<P>
So, heeding our broker's advice, we followed our heads and not our hearts and 
went for another handsome brick Colonial in a more stately neighborhood. This 
one is on a hill, surrounded by pines, dogwood and azaleas on a lushly 
landscaped half-acre. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old home has four bedrooms on the second floor, hardwood floors, 
spacious living, dining and family rooms and a large redwood deck. It's been 
superbly maintained. 
</P>
<P>
In comparison to our Los Angeles home, we had doubled our land holding and 
living space -- for all of $10,000 more. Of course, we had not replaced the 
orange tree, cactus or serene, covered patio. 
</P>
<P>
And we had ventured just beyond the Beltway, a freeway in concrete terms but a 
psycho-political demarcation line in Washington-ese. To be outside the Beltway, 
for many here, is to be beyond the outer limits. 
</P>
<P>
It can also mean having to battle traffic that backs up every rush hour, San 
Diego Freeway-style. That is, unless you take advantage of the Metro. 
</P>
<P>
The Metro is clean, well-lighted, computerized and futuristic-looking. You 
cannot eat, drink or be merry on the Metro. Riders do not dare to even leave 
behind a newspaper. Proper decorum prevails; it's polite society on the go. 
</P>
<P>
The rub, however, can be in getting to the Metro station. For many, this 
process resembles a commuting triathlon, an exercise utterly foreign to 
car-dependent Southern California of today, though perhaps not tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
Some Metro stations provide parking; others do not. At even those that do, the 
lots tend to fill up by 8 a.m., necessitating other measures to get there. 
</P>
<P>
Some walk to a bus stop to hitch a ride if one is close enough. Some travel by 
bicycle. Others drive to a neighborhood near the Metro and walk the rest of the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
A colleague transports his bike on his pickup to within a half mile of the 
Metro, where he parks the one and gets on the other. At Vienna, others drive to 
shuttle lots, where they park and catch a van to the station. 
</P>
<P>
For those who drive during rush hours, there is potential relief on the H.O.V., 
or high occupancy vehicle road. This is a highly advanced form of Los Angeles' 
despised diamond lanes. 
</P>
<P>
During rush hours on Route 66, the major freeway into the city from northern 
Virginia, each car is required to have three or more occupants. Those caught 
with fewer face a steep $40 ticket. There have been reports of commuters 
resorting to inflatable dummies to fool police. 
</P>
<P>
The authorities have responded by encouraging H.O.V. vigilantism. Billboards 
invite outraged drivers to turn in villains by calling 1-800-234-HERO. 
Violators reportedly receive annoying warnings in the mail. When we've taken 
the H.O.V. (picking up a third rider at the station), we estimated that nearly 
half our fellow travelers had merely one or two occupants aboard. 
</P>
<P>
But, being new, we gave them the benefit of the road and did not race to a 
phone to report them. 
</P>
<P>
I'm waiting for one with a Washington Redskins bumper sticker. That's the 
driver I'll blow the whistle on. 
</P>
<P>

SAM HALL KAPLAN: NEEDED FOR NEW DOWNTOWN: LINKAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM HALL KAPLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the distant vantage point of the Harbor and Santa Monica freeways, 
downtown Los Angeles is beginning to look more and more interesting. 
</P>
<P>
The recently topped crown of the cylindrical First Interstate World Center, 
fashioned by the architectural office of Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners, 
glistens, as do the wall panels being applied to the 777 Tower designed by 
Cesar Pelli. 
</P>
<P>
These and less ambitious efforts are lending the skyline a diversity of styles 
and shapes that happily are incrementally overcoming the boxy, boring buildings 
in the severe Modernistic mold that has dominated downtown for the last few 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
Also heartening is the restoration effort along Broadway, most notably of the 
Grand Central Market and Million Dollar Building by Ira Yellin, the start of 
construction of the expansion of the Convention Center, and of Phase 2 of 
California Plaza on Bunker Hill, consisting of an office tower and performance 
plaza. 
</P>
<P>
And then there are numerous other projects of promise in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
These include a bold mixed-use project covering 6 acres just east of the Harbor 
Freeway at 9th Street, labeled Metropolis and designed by Michael Graves in a 
multicolored pastiche of classical allusions; Grand Avenue Plaza, at 8th Street 
and Grand Avenue, featuring an elegant office tower by Richard Keating of the 
local office of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, and at 1st and Grand, a 
singular concert hall and questionable hotel by Frank O. Gehry. 
</P>
<P>
But architecturally interesting as they are, these projects will not make 
downtown that much more engaging. From my perspective, downtown remains 
fractured, much like the region itself, its parts greater than the whole. 
</P>
<P>
The abiding cliche describing Los Angeles as "40 (now read 140) suburbs in 
search of a city" could, with some license, be rephrased to describe the 
downtown as "40 clusters in search of a downtown." 
</P>
<P>
There is the Broadway and Spring Street historic district, the civic and music 
centers, California Plaza, Bunker Hill, the commercial core along Flower 
Street, the Central Library cluster, Citicorp Plaza and the convention center 
and South Park, each with its own image. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of forming a downtown of diversity and distinction, the clusters, 
for all intents and purposes, are isolated. Needed is what urban designers call 
linkages; planners call pedestrian-friendly connections; romanticists, paseos; 
science fiction writer Ray Bradbury, a yellow brick road, and what most people 
would describe as an interesting, safe street, a street for window shopping and 
looking. 
</P>
<P>
Author and urbanist William H. Whyte calls them the rivers of life of a city. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of linkages for downtown is not new. Public and private people, 
organizations and agencies have been urging them for years, in workshops, 
symposiums, proposals, plans and speeches. 
</P>
<P>
"Linkages are absolutely critical to the future of downtown," says Community 
Redevelopment Agency administrator John Tuite. "It is what is going to enliven 
and strengthen the historic district and every other district in downtown." 
</P>
<P>
However, with a variety of projects now coming on line, being discussed and 
debated, and taking form, I feel the concept again should be emphasized. Too 
often those involved in pushing a particular project lose perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Among the planned linkages is the Angel's Flight funicular connecting Broadway 
to California Plaza, Grand Avenue connecting California Plaza to the Music and 
Civic centers, the Bunker Hill steps connecting Bunker Hill to the Central 
Library, the Hope Street promenade connecting the library to South Park and 7th 
Street connecting the historic districts to the Citicorp and Metropolis 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
These linkages cannot be afterthoughts. They are not decorations on the cake of 
downtown, but rather its foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Happily, the Bunker Hill steps, as designed with a flair by Lawrence Halprin, 
are nearing completion. But the other linkages appear to be floundering at the 
bottom of the list of public and private priorities. This also includes two 
critical linchpins in the linkages, the redevelopment of Pershing Square and 
the Central Library's west lawn. 
</P>
<P>
Another concern of mine is 7th Street between Olive and Grand. Once the city's 
prime retail location, the street has deteriorated badly and desperately needs 
new life for the sake of the persevering landmark business there, such as 
Clifton's, and to help channel energy and investments to the threatened 
Broadway and Spring Street historic districts. 
</P>
<P>
That is why I think it is time for preservationists to bite the bullet and hold 
a wake for the vacated 1912 Brockman and 1917 Coulter buildings. The buildings 
are simply not in the same category, alas, as the Pan Pacific Auditorium and 
the Ambassador Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
What should be saved is the spirit of 7th Street, and that I feel can be done 
by urging that the new hotel proposed for the Brockman and Coulter site respect 
the street's 150-foot cornice height limit and reflect the texture and tone of 
neighboring historic structures. An absolute must would be street-level shops 
to enrich the sidewalk and engage pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the future of downtown will not rest with the buildings, 
architecturally and historically interesting as they may be, but with the 
people, working and living there, and enjoying the streets and the sights. 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood is one of the more gerrymandered cities in Southern California, 
its shape an aberration of a Rorschach test. And although in many ways the city 
is very together, it desperately needs a civic focal point, a village green of 
sorts, edged by community and governmental buildings. 
</P>
<P>
That is why conceptually and aesthetically the proposed civic center south of 
Santa Monica Boulevard on San Vicente Boulevard makes so much sense. As 
designed by Edmund Chang and Roger Sherman, assisted by Gruen Associates, 
Michael Van Valkenburgh and POD, the center is appropriately user-friendly. It 
also creates as much parkland as it takes, with the city promising more 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The project, which is on the ballot this Tuesday in West Hollywood, deserves to 
be approved.

APARTMENT LIFE: LANDLORD'S DUTIES AFTER S.F. QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

of the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles, an apartment owners' service 
group.

QUESTION: I own a four-unit building in San Francisco. Here's my question: In 
the aftermath of the 1989 San Francisco earthquake, what are the 
responsibilities of a landlord to the tenants if the quake caused the rental 
units to be uninhabitable or dangerous for either a short time or over longer 
periods of time? I rent on a monthly basis. Do I need to provide shelter for 
the balance of the month or until the building is safe to occupy? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: You are not responsible for "acts of God," which earthquakes are. If 
the building is only going to be uninhabitable for a short period of time, you 
must provide the tenants with some kind of rent refunds or credits while 
repairs are being made. Even though the condition of the property is not your 
fault, you cannot collect rent while it is uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
If the tenants are going to permanently need new housing, you should refund the 
pro-rata share of their rents for the month and any security deposits you may 
be holding of theirs. I would do so immediately as a humane gesture, rather 
than waiting up to two weeks as allowed by state law. 
</P>
<P>
Splitting Couple Must Honor Lease 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband and I moved into our Los Angeles apartment last March. We signed 
a one-year lease. Now we're having marital problems and I'm thinking about 
moving out. The problem is that my husband says if I don't continue paying rent 
until the lease is up he'll take me to court to get "my" half of the rent. 
</P>
<P>
Do I have to pay the rent since I signed the lease? Do I have any options? And 
will this ruin my chances of getting another apartment because I might get a 
bad reference for moving out during the term of the lease? 
</P>
<P>
A: You're probably going to have problems because of the lease. Most contain a 
provision such as the following: "The undersigned tenants, whether or not in 
actual possession of the premises, are jointly and severally (together and 
separately) liable for all rent incurred during the term of this agreement." If 
your lease contains similar language, you're liable. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not you get a bad personal reference from your landlord depends upon 
your relationship with him. 
</P>
<P>
Detached Garages Can Rent Separately 
</P>
<P>
Q: We recently bought a six-unit apartment building in Encino. Some of the 
rents are very low, but the unit includes six detached garages. Can I charge 
more rent for the garage spaces? If so, how do I go about it? 
</P>
<P>
A: You can rent the garages; however, there are a number of issues to consider 
here. The key is the rental agreements. 
</P>
<P>
If the units are rent controlled, as they appear to be, and the garages are 
included in the renters' rental agreements as part of the rentals, you cannot 
raise the rent to the tenants for their continued use. The garages are already 
rented to them. 
</P>
<P>
You could give the tenants 30-day notices to vacate the garages, and then 
re-rent them, but you would have to reduce the tenants' rents and check with 
rent control to find out how much, because of the reduction in services. (Any 
reduction in services requires a rent reduction under rent control.) 
</P>
<P>
If the units are not rent controlled, are rented to parties other than your 
renters, or rented to your renters as separate services, you can raise the 
rents to market levels with 30-day notices. 
</P>
<P>
Tenant Can Be Evicted With 30-Day Notice 
</P>
<P>
Q: I would like to know if the new owner of my Arleta apartment building has 
the right to evict me because I have lived here for 10 years and the rent is 
very low. What are my rights? 
</P>
<P>
A: If the building is not rent controlled, the owner can ask you to leave with 
a 30-day notice. If it is controlled, he can only evict you for "just cause." 
</P>
<P>
Since you say the rent is very low, I'll assume you won't give him cause to 
evict, such as not paying the rent or violating the rental agreement, which 
leaves us with the three "no-fault" eviction causes: 
</P>
<P>
They are owner move-in, demolition of the property and permanent removal of the 
unit from rental housing use. If the owner evicts you for one of these causes, 
you are entitled to relocation fees. 
</P>
<P>
Soft Drink Machines Trouble New Owner 
</P>
<P>
Q: My wife and I recently bought a four-unit apartment building in Santa Maria. 
There was a lot of deferred maintenance in the building, but my problem for you 
is the two large soft drink machines that we seem to have inherited. They are 
protected by locked iron doors and are electrically powered from one of the 
tenant's units. 
</P>
<P>
We want to get rid of the machines, but the company that owns them claims to 
have a valid contract for them with the previous owner. What can we do? 
</P>
<P>
A: Contracts such as the one you are alluding to are often recorded in escrow 
when properties are sold, however, it doesn't sound like this one was. The 
problem you have is that the presence of the two "large" machines seems fairly 
obvious to anyone inspecting the building prior to its sale. 
</P>
<P>
You should have asked about the machines when you inspected the property. If 
the vendor has a valid contract, you may be stuck with the machines. Do ask to 
see the contract. 
</P>
<P>
If you must keep the machines, you must have them rewired to the house wiring. 
</P>
<P>
Rent Control Rules Are Similar but Diffferent 
</P>
<P>
Q: Your last column included a letter from a man who was concerned that he 
might be evicted from his duplex and denied relocation moving fees. 
</P>
<P>
My question is asked on behalf of my 89-year-old uncle, who lives in a 
rent-controlled duplex in San Francisco and has the same concern. 
</P>
<P>
Do the rent control measures in Los Angeles reflect those in San Francisco and 
other California cities? If not, where can I write to get the San Francisco 
rules and regulations? 
</P>
<P>
A: Rent control measures in California are similar but different. To find out 
about San Francisco rent control, write to: San Francisco RSD, 25 Van Ness 
Ave., S.F., CA 94102.

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: HOME BUYERS TODAY HAVE SEVERAL PROTECTIONS FROM BUYING 
'LEMON' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS, Robert J. Bruss is a San Francisco-area lawyer, author and 
real estate broker. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Many years ago, my mother and father bought their first home, which 
turned out to be a lemon. I grew up in that house and remember most of the 
problems, such as bad plumbing, defective wiring, which almost burned the house 
down; a water heater that exploded shortly after we moved in, a roof that 
continuously developed new leaks, and a furnace that never worked right. 
</P>
<P>
Now my husband and I are talking about buying our first house and we want to 
avoid buying one with unexpected problems like my parents encountered. Is there 
any way to avoid such problems? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Yes. Home buyers today have many ways to protect themselves against 
buying a defective home. After you find the home you want to buy, just take 
some simple precautions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Inspect the home very carefully. Note all visible defects. Most will be 
minor problems, such as small cracks. Consider the cost of repairing these 
obvious defects when you make your written purchase offer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In your written purchase offer, if the seller has not given you a written 
disclosure statement (as some states, such as California now require by law) 
make your offer contingent upon the seller disclosing in writing all known 
defects and your acceptance of such disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Also include in your written offer a contingency clause such as "This 
purchase offer contingent upon buyer obtaining and approving a professional 
inspection report of the house." Such an inspection will cost around $200, but 
will be well worthwhile. Be sure to accompany the inspector, who will point out 
and explain all defects observed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If possible, get the seller or the real estate agent to pay for a one-year 
home warranty policy. This protection, available from most realty agents, pays 
for repairs to built-in appliances, plumbing, wiring, water heater and furnace 
during the year after purchase. 
</P>
<P>
The old days of caveat emptor, or buyer beware, which prevailed when your 
parents bought their home, are long gone. Today, home sellers must disclose all 
known defects or risk being liable to their buyers for the costs of repairs. 
But smart buyers use the methods above to protect themselves just in case the 
home seller "forgets" to disclose a known defect. Ask a real estate attorney to 
explain further. 
</P>
<P>
Elderly Sellers Miss Out on Tax Break 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am 66 and my bride, whom I married almost a year ago, is 62. She didn't 
like my house, so I reluctantly agreed to sell it so we can buy a new townhouse 
together. However, when I talked to my tax adviser he said I cannot use my 
$125,000 tax exemption because my new wife used her exemption when she and her 
late husband sold their home several years ago. This doesn't seem fair. Please 
tell me it isn't true. 
</P>
<P>
A: I regret to inform you that your tax adviser is correct. You are a victim of 
legal age discrimination by the federal government. Internal Revenue Code 
section 121, the "over 55 rule" $125,000 home sale tax exemption is available 
when the seller is 55 or older on the day of sale, has owned and lived in the 
principal residence at least three of the five years before sale, and has never 
used this tax break before. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the last requirement ruins your use of the "over 55 rule" 
because your new wife used her once-per-lifetime $125,000 home sale exemption 
when she was married to her late husband. Since she used her entitlement and 
she is now married to you that means you cannot claim the exemption. 
</P>
<P>
Your situation is a classic example of why persons 55 or older who plan to get 
married should ask their new spouse before marriage, "Honey, have you used your 
once-per-lifetime $125,000 'over 55 rule' home sale tax exemption yet?" If the 
answer is "yes," the new spouse should consider selling their old home before 
the marriage. Your tax adviser has further details. 
</P>
<P>
Use Lease-Option to Sell Condominium 
</P>
<P>
Q: We own a condo that has been listed with three fine realty agents over the 
past year. None has been able to sell it. As we must sell to stop our negative 
cash flow we were thinking of advertising "nothing down" and just walking away. 
However, the lender doesn't want our mortgage to be assumed by a buyer. What 
should we do to get rid of this condo? 
</P>
<P>
A: Please don't walk away from your condo because the consequences to your 
credit would be very adverse. A better alternative is to lease the condo with 
an option to buy. I have yet to see a situation where a lease-option, properly 
used, can't find a buyer for a property. 
</P>
<P>
My suggestion is to run a classified newspaper ad under both the For Sale and 
For Rent headings. A headline such as "$1,000 moves you in" makes your ad stand 
out from the crowd. Be sure to list all the condo benefits and the words "100% 
rent credit toward down payment." Of course, a lesser rent credit would be used 
if you weren't so eager to sell. 
</P>
<P>
No Extension Given for Replacement Home 
</P>
<P>
Q: We sold our home almost two years ago. But due to family problems, we were 
unable to buy a replacement home to qualify for tax deferral on our home sale 
profit. It looks like we won't meet our 24-month deadline. I called the local 
IRS office for a time extension but they refused. How can we get a six-month 
extension? 
</P>
<P>
A: Sorry, but IRC 1034 does not have any provision for extension of the 
24-month tax-deferral home replacement period unless you join the military or 
are living overseas. Please ask your tax adviser for further details. 
</P>
<P>
Improving Rural Lot Could Be Big Mistake 
</P>
<P>
Q: Almost five years ago, my husband wanted to buy a lot in the country. I 
didn't like the idea, but since the cost was only $3,500, I went along with the 
idea. Now he wants to spend about $40,000 to build a house on the lot. In my 
opinion, the lot offers nothing special. 
</P>
<P>
It is not in a recreational area and we probably would rent the house to 
tenants. My husband keeps saying this will be a great investment. But nearby 
homes sell for $35,000 to $45,000 so I don't see any profit potential, do you? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Improving a rural lot by building a house on it that offers no profit 
potential appears to not be a very smart idea. If the lot has some redeeming 
quality, such as recreational use or excellent potential for appreciation in 
market value, that would be different, but it doesn't make sense to invest 
$43,500 to possibly sell for $45,000. Since you will presumably be obligated on 
the mortgage, maybe you should say "no."

Open Listings Don't Benefit Home Sellers 
</P>
<P>
Q: My neighbor is trying to sell his home and save half the sales commission. 
I'm watching what he's doing because next year I plan to sell my house. He told 
me he sent letters to about 20 real estate brokers in town, giving the details 
of his home and his asking price. 
</P>
<P>
Most came to inspect the house, and several brought prospective buyers. The 
neighbor tells me he made a counteroffer to a purchase offer and is waiting for 
the response. What do you think of this idea? 
</P>
<P>
A: Not much. Your neighbor is using an open listing. It is really no listing at 
all because if the seller finds a buyer, without any agent's help, then the 
seller owes no sales commission. 
</P>
<P>
Since the agents lack control over the open listing, most will not work very 
hard to sell your neighbor's house. A better alternative for you to use when 
you are ready to sell your home is to invite at least three local realty agents 
to give you their listing presentations. 
</P>
<P>
Select these agents by asking friends for recommendations, watching which 
agents sell nearby homes, and following the newspaper ads of agents advertising 
homes in your neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Each agent should give you a written "competitive market analysis" showing 
recent sales prices of homes like yours, asking prices of similar nearby homes 
for sale (your competition), asking prices of recent comparable expired 
listings, and the agent's recommended asking price for your home. After 
checking each agent's references of recent sellers, then select the best agent 
to receive your exclusive listing. 
</P>
<P>
Be Sure You Record Your Land Contract 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are buying a house with nothing down on a land contract in which the 
seller continues to hold the title until we complete our payments. When I asked 
the seller about recording the contract, she said that wasn't necessary. Do you 
agree? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. If you are dealing with an unscrupulous seller, she might try to sell 
the house for a second time to another buyer. Then you could be caught in the 
middle of a mess. Recording your land contract establishes your priority date 
in the event of a dispute. 
</P>
<P>
If you are living in the house, you are legally protected because anyone 
dealing with that house, as a buyer or lender, does so subject to the rights of 
the tenants. But for your safety, you should record your land contract. For 
full details, please consult a real estate attorney. 
</P>
<P>
How to Cancel Your Real Estate Listing 
</P>
<P>
Q: We stupidly signed a six-month listing for the sale of our home. Now we 
realize that was a bad mistake because the agent is doing practically nothing 
to get our home sold. How can we get out of this listing so we can either 
forget about selling or list with a better agent? 
</P>
<P>
A: Most reputable real estate agents will let their home sellers cancel a 
listing without penalty. However, a few agents insist on receiving a 
cancellation fee. 
</P>
<P>
But if you can show the agent did little or nothing to effectively market your 
home, you might wish to cancel the listing for failure of consideration, also 
known as lack of due diligence. 
</P>
<P>
However, please consult a real estate attorney before canceling your listing 
because such action might incur legal liability to the first agent. 
</P>
<P>
If you plan to list your home for sale with another agent, you may be able to 
get the first agent to transfer the listing to the second agent. Then the first 
agent gets a referral fee when the second agent finds a buyer for the home. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, please don't sign a long listing. The maximum should be 90 days, 
but a 60- or even 30-day term keeps the agent working hard to get the listing 
sold before it expires. Of course, be sure the agent understands if the listing 
expires with the home unsold but the agent is doing a good job, you will renew 
the listing. 
</P>
<P>
Beware of Agents Who Seek Advance Fees 
</P>
<P>
Q: I own some farmland which I inherited several years ago. It was rented to a 
tenant farmer, but he decided not to renew in 1989 and it is now vacant. A 
local real estate broker has written me several times about selling my land. 
</P>
<P>
He claims to have contacts with corporate farm buyers but he wants me to sign a 
six-month listing and pay a $500 advance marketing fee. In addition, he wants a 
10% sales commission. Is it customary to charge an advance fee? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Beware of any real estate agent who insists upon an advance fee. Most 
reputable agents do not charge up-front fees and you should be very wary of one 
who wants you to pay before the agent sells the property.

GARLIC AND SHALLOTS ARE EASY-GROW TASTE TREATS; 
</P>
<P>
PLANTING: ORDER SELECT VARIETIES OR USE BULBS YOU BUY FROM THE GROCERY STORE TO 
GROW YOUR OWN PUNGENT COOKING SPICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The bold flavor of garlic and the subtle flavor of shallots help transform 
ordinary table fare into extraordinary cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
Both of these flavor favorites are easy to grow in a small kitchen garden plot 
or in a container. October is the choice month to plant them in the Southland. 
Once planted, you can almost forget about them. Except for regular watering, 
both garlic and shallots are almost carefree plants. 
</P>
<P>
Garlic has been a prized culinary addition for thousands of years. Three 
thousand years ago in Egypt, one could purchase a slave for 10 pounds of 
garlic, and Roman soldiers and senators consumed copious quantities of the 
pungent bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
You may order select garlic varieties from seed companies or you may simply buy 
garlic bulbs at the grocery store, pull them apart and plant the individual 
cloves. If you want a mild garlic, I would recommend elephant garlic. 
</P>
<P>
It is usually available at nurseries and garden centers. Elephant garlic grows 
to a large size, sometimes producing bulbs which weight a pound or more, and it 
is a very reliable producer. 
</P>
<P>
Garlic requires an area of the garden that receives full sun. Like all 
vegetables, garlic will benefit from a soil that has been well-worked and 
enriched with organic materials. Add a vegetable fertilizer at planting time. 
</P>
<P>
Divide the garlic bulbs into individual cloves and plant them 1 inch deep, with 
the pointed ends up. Regular garlic should be spaced 3 inches apart and 
elephant garlic, 5 inches apart. 
</P>
<P>
When planting garlic in rows, space the rows 15 inches apart. Garlic should be 
watered on a weekly basis until three weeks before harvest. During the growing 
period if any seed stalks form, break them off, as they hinder the bulb 
formation. 
</P>
<P>
In late spring or early summer when the green foliage starts to droop and turn 
yellow, discontinue watering. When the tops turn brown and fall over, it is 
time to harvest the bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
Dig the bulbs and let them dry in the sun for two days. Then let them cure in 
an airy place that is protected from the sun. When storing garlic bulbs, you 
may want to braid the stems to form clusters of bulbs and then store them in a 
dry, cool place that is adequately ventilated. 
</P>
<P>
Shallots are the delight of the gourmet cook and are prized in French and other 
Continental cuisines. But they often are not carried by local markets, and when 
you do find them, they're usually expensive. Why that is so isn't known, since 
shallots are one of the easiest vegetables to grow. 
</P>
<P>
They thrive on poor soil, need very little care and will divide and multiply 
year after year, producing clusters of small bulbs from the original bulb. 
These bulbs, when dried and cured, lend a mild garlic-onion flavor to meats, 
sauces and other dishes. 
</P>
<P>
Shallot bulbs are available at many nurseries, or you can order them from firms 
such as Burpee Seed Co., 300 Park Ave., Warminster, Pa. 18991. You can also 
plant the shallots you buy in the market. 
</P>
<P>
Soil preparation and cultural requirements for shallots are the same as those 
listed above for garlic. Plant the shallot bulbs 1 inch deep and 2 inches 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
Shallots are ready for harvest when the tops turn brown and topple over. From a 
fall planting, this usually occurs in late spring. But be sure to leave a few 
bulbs in the ground to multiply and produce more plants. Pull the bulbs, leave 
the tops on, and cure them by letting them dry in the sun for one week. Then 
remove the tops and store the bulbs in a paper bag in a cool, dry area. Shallot 
bulbs will keep up to one year without losing their quality. 
</P>
<P>
Both garlic and shallots are easy to grow in a container. When planting in a 
container, add a time-release fertilizer to the potting soil. Container-grown 
plants require more frequent watering. The soil should never be allowed to dry 
completely.

KEEP SLIDING DOORS ON THE RIGHT TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reader's Digest 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sliding doors are widely used on closets because they are easy to install and 
virtually maintenance-free compared to hinged doors. 
</P>
<P>
But after years of use, even these doors can begin to have trouble moving in 
their tracks. Most sliding doors are hung from a track mounted on the top door 
jamb and ride along the track on rollers. A guide on the floor holds the doors 
in alignment. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some tips on keeping your sliding doors working smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
Maintenance: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The nylon rollers on sliding doors are self-lubricating, but they sometimes 
get sticky. If that happens, apply a little powdered graphite to their axles. 
Don't use oil; it attracts dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To clean the overhead track, spray household cleaner on a terry cloth rag, 
wrap the rag around the tip of a screwdriver, and move the padded tip along the 
track. 
</P>
<P>
Troubleshooting: 
</P>
<P>
 -- If a door hangs crooked and one side drags, loosen the adjusting screw on 
the back of the roller mounting plate on the side that drags. Raise the side 
until its lower edge is parallel to the floor; check it with a carpenter's 
level. Then retighten the screw. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If a sliding door rattles, check the bottom door guides. Replace them if 
they are bent or missing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If a door sticks, or a roller jumps the track, check for loose screws, an 
object lodged in the track, a worn or broken roller, or a bent track. 
</P>
<P>
Hint: It's easier to replace a broken roller or a bent overhead track than to 
repair it. Here's how: 
</P>
<P>
1. Remove the door by lifting it until the rollers are free. Note that some 
doors can be freed only when their rollers are lined up with special "key" 
openings in the track, generally when the door is halfway open. 
</P>
<P>
2. Remove the screws that hold the broken roller to the door or the bent track 
to the jamb. Install an identical replacement part, available from hardware 
stores or home centers. 
</P>
<P>
A door that slides on a lower track may or may not have rollers. In either 
case, problems usually stem from a dirty or bent track. First, clean the bottom 
track with a vacuum atttachment or a stiff brush; scrape off any paint or 
stubborn grit. 
</P>
<P>
If the track is bent, you can usually straighten it provided it's not too 
severely damaged. Cut a block of wood to fit inside the track and hammer out 
the bend from the outside with a rubber mallet.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: HOME IMPROVEMENT; 
</P>
<P>
MODULAR HOUSES ARE ENERGY SAVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY, James Dulley is a Cincinnati-based engineering consultant. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I am planning to build a house soon and I was considering a modular 
house. Are they very energy efficient and are they basically just large mobile 
homes? 
</P>
<P>
A: Modular houses are very well built and energy efficient. They are 
constructed just like a site-built house, but in the controlled environment of 
a factory. With strict quality control, these houses can be built very airtight 
and well-insulated for utility bills. 
</P>
<P>
They range from small ranches to large, two-story colonials with well over 
3,000 square feet of floor space. Unless you were told that the house was 
modular and built in factory, you would not know it from the interior or the 
exterior. 
</P>
<P>
The larger two-story houses use several modules connected side-by-side and 
stacked on top of one another. The top modules are often shipped with the roof. 
</P>
<P>
Modular houses are typically somewhat less expensive than comparable site-built 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
The exteriors of modular houses can be finished in the factory with siding, or 
at the site with stucco, brick or siding. Stucco is a particularly 
energy-efficient exterior wall finish because it reduces air leakage through 
the walls. 
</P>
<P>
Some manufacturers and builders allow you to order a modular house to varying 
degrees of finish. If you are handy with tools, you can do some of the finish 
work yourself and reduce the total costs. 
</P>
<P>
A major reason for the high-quality and energy-efficient construction is 
transportation requirements. The modules must be built strong enough to 
withstand long-distance transportation on trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy lumber and extra fasteners and reinforcing straps are used for strength. 
For example, wall construction using 2x6 studs on 16-inch centers is common. 
The 6-inch thick walls provide space for extra insulation. 
</P>
<P>
Construction in a factory offers other advantages over a site-built house. All 
of the building materials are stored out of the weather. In addition, certain 
the lumber can be nailed and fastened together better and stronger when the 
walls aren't on a foundation. 
</P>
<P>
You can install any type of heating and central air conditioning system. 
Baseboard electric heat is often used or a heat pump, for both heating and 
air-conditioning, can be effective. 
</P>
<P>
You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 111 showing exterior diagrams 
and floor plans for five modular houses (ranch and two-story) and a list of 30 
modular house manufacturers and addresses. Please include $1.00 and a 
self-addressed, business-sized envelope. Send your requests to James Dulley, 
Los Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45244.

Natural Gas Is Cheaper Way to Heat Water 
</P>
<P>
Q: I was wondering how much it costs to heat one gallon of hot water. 
</P>
<P>
A: If you use natural gas to heat your water, it typically costs about .2 cents 
for each gallon of hot water. With an electric water heater, it costs several 
times that much. Even though the dollar savings per gallon is not great, there 
are other hidden costs: increased sewage/water treatment costs, increased 
pollution and needless of energy supplies.

FAKE BEAMS CAN HIDE CRACKS, OTHER DEFECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Looking for a way to hide a persistent ceiling crack? Want to hide those ugly 
steel posts in your basement? Like to give ordinary drywall a post-and-beam 
Tudor look? 
</P>
<P>
You can accomplish all these goals and more with fake beams. Although most 
lumberyards sell realistic-looking beams made of plastic, I prefer to make my 
own, using ordinary 1-inch lumber. 
</P>
<P>
A good all-around size is 1-by-6. They give you a finished beam 5 1/2 inches 
wide, that looks about right in most cases. 1-by-4s look a little bit skimpy, 
and 1-by-8s, a little large. 
</P>
<P>
If you can find rough-cut cedar, by all means use it. This will automatically 
give your beams a rustic look. You can also use ordinary pine and rough it up a 
bit after it's assembled to give it that hand-hewn, rustic look. 
</P>
<P>
Let's make a ceiling beam first. Here is the basic beam-building technique. To 
start, buy three 1-by-6s at least as long as your intended beam. 
</P>
<P>
When you get them home, cut each of these to length. Next, bevel both edges of 
one piece to a 45-degree angle. This will be the bottom of the beam. Then bevel 
one edge of each of the other two pieces. These will be the sides of the beam. 
You can cut your bevels with a table saw, radial arm or a portable circular 
saw. 
</P>
<P>
Now glue and nail these three pieces together as shown in the sketch. Use 
ordinary white or yellow glue, and six-penny (2-inch) finishing nails. Let the 
glue dry for an hour and then the beam is ready to install. 
</P>
<P>
To do this, cut some scrap lumber to a width that will fit snugly inside the 
open top of your beam. Any old scraps of 1-inch pine or 3/4-inch plywood will 
do. Now take these scraps and fasten them to the ceiling, along the line you 
want your beam to follow. If you are using your beam to hide a crack, you can 
simply nail these scraps in place. There will be a ceiling joist directly over 
the crack. 
</P>
<P>
Now you can slip the beam up over this line of scraps and secure it to them 
with finishing nails. If you want to finish the beam -- maybe staining it to 
look old and dark -- you should do so before hanging it. This way you won't 
have to worry about getting any finish on the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
You can use this same technique for installing "antique" posts on your wall. 
This is an easy way to cover the joints between sheets of dry wall and thus 
eliminate the job of taping. Let's say you want to finish off a basement. Do 
the walls with gypsum board. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of taping and carefully covering all the nail heads, just smear on a 
rough coat of wallboard compound with a trowel to get that rustic, 
hand-plastered look. Then cover all the joints between sheets with posts and 
you have a Tudor basement. As a bonus, you can also use these posts to hide 
plumbing or new electrical runs. 
</P>
<P>
Hiding Posts. To cover up those ugly steel posts in your basement, you'll have 
to modify your technique somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of making a three-piece beam, you need to use four pieces. And you'll 
have to bevel all four corners. Glue and nail three of the four pieces together 
and slip the beam around your post. 
</P>
<P>
Then glue and nail on the fourth side to complete the job.

FREQUENTLY ACCURATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As an active real estate appraiser in Southern California, I read with interest 
Dan Thomas Nelson's article, "How Appraisers Value a Home" (Oct. 22). 
</P>
<P>
Generally, the article was consistent with the appraisal profession. However, I 
take exception to two items. First, Mr. Nelson stated that the county 
assessor's living area for homes is "frequently wrong." In my 12 years' 
experience as an appraiser, I have found the assessor's living area is 
frequently accurate. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, a substantial disparity is the result of a non-permitted (therefore 
illegal) room addition. (An illegal room addition can quite possibly contribute 
very little to the value of a home, especially if the addition does not meet 
the local building code.) 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the appraiser implied that a hillside lot is generally worth less 
than a level lot of similar size. In today's view-conscious society, a hillside 
lot with a view, especially of the ocean, can be more valuable than an entirely 
level lot. In addition, a hillside lot provides considerable privacy.

Dan Nelson did not touch on two questions I have: 
</P>
<P>
1. Does not the appraiser deliberately "low-ball" his estimates because he is 
employed by the mortgage lender and not the buyer/sellers? That has been my 
experience and also others with whom I've spoken. 
</P>
<P>
2. Mr. Nelson's description of how he arrives at an estimate would seem to have 
an obvious flaw. Namely, when demand is pushing prices up, his technique of 
setting a value purely on what has previously transpired flies in the face of 
reality.

SAME OLD CLAPTRAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Leon Whiteson's otherwise interesting article on the admirable Case Study 
Exhibit at the Temporary Contemporary ("Homes That Captured the Dream," Oct. 
15) it is disappointing to read the same old claptrap about the great 
significance of the Case Study program. 
</P>
<P>
It is entirely possible to praise John Entenza's program for its utopian 
concept and for the artistry of some of the resulting designs, while at the 
same time admitting that it failed in its goal of influencing the mast housing 
market. To claim that it had a "major impact" is laughable; of the "major 
innovations . . . in popular house design" that Whiteson lists, only the lowly 
sliding glass door applies. 
</P>
<P>
False praise does the cause no good. Critics and designers must have a more 
clear-eyed view of past successes and failures if their present opinions are to 
be valued by others in society.

Every day, as I read our L.A. Times I ask myself "Do I like the new format?" 
</P>
<P>
It is not an easy question to answer, but the Oct. 22 Sunday Times spurred me 
to compliment you on your Real Estate section. 
</P>
<P>
But what motivated me to write was the article written by Leon Whiteson on the 
I. M. Pei building for the Creative Artists Agency. 
</P>
<P>
He describes the building glowingly, which I have eagerly watched being built, 
but also states that such a "building doesn't seem to fit where it is placed." 
Granted it may be true, but doesn't it stand out among the mishaps that have 
been built along that prestigious Wilshire area, one building more unattractive 
than the other. 
</P>
<P>
At last I. M. Pei has finally come into our area! We are truly honored. 
</P>
<P>
We welcome him, as I believe he is a very fine, and maybe one of the greatest 
architects in our world today.

HUNTSVILLE, Ala. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four minutes, 30 seconds to liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
Mission control reports that the shuttle has switched to internal power. I 
radio confirmation as my eyes wander over the monitors on the flight deck. 
Outside the forward viewing ports, thin clouds drift through the serene blue of 
the Florida sky. Perfect launch weather. 
</P>
<P>
"Discovery? Repeat: Do you confirm oxygen vents closed? Over." 
</P>
<P>
What oxygen vents? Something to do with fuel for the main engine? I search 
frantically among the banks of switches for anything that mentions "oxygen." We 
are falling behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Less than two minutes before, the solid engines had ignited and we are 
committed to launch. At last I spot it, an obscure switch labeled "O2." I flip 
it and mumble confirmation over the headset, then glance at the panel again and 
go cold. 
</P>
<P>
I have vented all the oxygen from the sealed cabin. To the right, my pilot, 
"Buzz," a doctor from California, seems unconcerned. He studies the electrical 
system. Behind me, "Bubba," the Midwest carpet dealer, mentally rehearses his 
space walk. 
</P>
<P>
The countdown continues. This motion is going to make for a long two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
The equipment and the mission are simulations, but the tension is real at the 
Space &amp; Rocket Center in Huntsville, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
Start with a generation that grew up with Sputnik, the Mercury astronauts and 
Apollo on the moon. Imagine a theme park built around space exploration, with 
real NASA training machines, detailed Hollywood mock-ups of the space shuttle, 
and the chance to command a shuttle mission from launch to landing. Add some 
astronauts, a German rocket scientist and the world's most extensive rocket 
park. 
</P>
<P>
The result is U.S. Space Camp, a hands-on program that sets the center apart 
from other collections of space hardware. College-age counselors take children, 
and adults, through a program of lectures and simulations that are no doubt the 
closest most of us will ever get to real space flight. 
</P>
<P>
Programs are divided into five levels -- three for children and two for adults. 
Children in grades 4-6 can attend Space Camp, where they build and launch their 
own model rockets. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the five-day program, kids can taste astronaut food, ride machines 
that simulate moon gravity and explore astronaut training facilities at the 
nearby Marshall Space Flight Center. 
</P>
<P>
The more advanced Space Academy offers a five-day program for children in 
grades 7-9. 
</P>
<P>
Academy Level II trains high school sophomores, juniors and seniors in a 10-day 
program patterned on NASA crew training manuals. The intensive 100-hour course 
includes lectures by rocket engineers and astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
Both adult programs, Levels I and II, are condensed three-day versions of the 
advanced Academy curriculum, including descent into a two-story water tank like 
the system used to teach astronauts the tricks of construction in space. 
</P>
<P>
Any student from grades 4-12 may apply to Space Camp. The application must 
include a recommendation from a classroom or science teacher. 
</P>
<P>
I had never strapped on a tank before, but after some homework and a session 
with certified scuba instructors, I dived 20 feet to experience simulated 
weightlessness. 
</P>
<P>
The realities of physics hit home in a new way. A 150-pound steel ball, buoyed 
weightless underwater and shoved gently toward me, still delivered a jolt 
through its properties of inertia and mass. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson: In near-earth orbit, I might be able to "lift" a satellite, but not 
stop it from spinning. 
</P>
<P>
The culmination of each session is a "shuttle mission" combining all the week's 
training in a carefully scripted simulation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Until midway through our flight, our crew's mission specialists sit patiently, 
with only an occasional radio report to make. Now it is time for their 
"extra-vehicular activity" -- the space walk. 
</P>
<P>
An assistant helps them into bulky space suits. They get into white rubber 
boots and helmets and take their places for the satellite-repair exercise. 
</P>
<P>
One is strapped into a parachute harness attached by cables to a track far 
overhead. The other steps onto a large mechanical arm like the one used in the 
repair of phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
The first figure glides out over the shuttle bay like a space age Peter Pan. 
The second jerks the arm in fits and starts, up and over, to rendezvous near a 
shiny satellite replica above the shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
This is a quiet time for the commander and pilot, so the counselor overseeing 
our mission secretly throws a switch on his command panel. 
</P>
<P>
A red light on our emergency panel flashes "Fire." The pilot and I flip through 
our emergency cards to find the fire control procedure. We expected something 
like this, and in less than a minute the light is out. We are getting cocky. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Not everything runs like clockwork. Coordinating training and machinery for 
three or more groups simultaneously leads to some confusion and down time. 
</P>
<P>
During my visit, a jet cockpit trainer was out of commission and one of the 
microgravity simulators, which ride on a cushion of air, had a balky hose. A 
special early-morning session to rehearse mission assignments started late with 
a collection of drowsy counselors. 
</P>
<P>
Agendas for the advanced programs are packed. Twelve-hour days are the norm. 
Breaks for sightseeing are scheduled during each session; the staff reminds 
participants that the experience is, after all, supposed to be fun. 
</P>
<P>
Campers' families or others who just want to visit for the day can find less 
demanding activities. 
</P>
<P>
The center's Spacedome Theater features movies filmed in the huge new Omnimax 
format like the ones shown at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, 
D.C. But here films are projected overhead on a shallow planetarium-type 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
A shuttle launch vibrated our reclining chairs with the rolling thunder. Later 
we "oohed" and "aahed" like spectators at a fireworks show as panoramas of 
Earth and the crisp starkness of space filled our field of vision. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
The idea of a museum that would allow children to take part in the excitement 
of space travel was first promoted by Wernher von Braun, the German rocket 
genius who immigrated to the United States after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The museum and rocket park opened in 1970. In 1982, the first U.S. Space Camp 
program was offered, attracting 747 children. The center later added the 
advanced sessions for teen-agers and adults. Annual attendance at this 
three-ring space circus is up to 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
The center is run by the state of Alabama and receives sizable donations of 
equipment, money and expertise from NASA and a group of aerospace contractors 
and local corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Campers bunk in compact six-person "sleep stations" in the new 
multimillion-dollar Space Habitat dormitory, whose futuristic design was 
inspired by NASA's proposed space station. Counselors provide supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
The runway at Edwards Air Force Base rises ahead of us. I begin the first of 
the broad S-turns that will allow us to glide in at the right speed and 
heading. 
</P>
<P>
I ease the control stick to one side. The hydraulics slowly tip the whole cabin 
in that direction. I steer back the other way, and again the cabin tilts in 
response. 
</P>
<P>
I am so intent on keeping the craft centered that I almost forget about landing 
gear. Wait, that's the pilot's job. "Buzz, get the gear." More fumbling. Armed, 
deployed, on the ground, with two seconds to spare. 
</P>
<P>
Buzz says nothing, pretending to recheck the switches. Bubba can't wait to 
rehash the mission over lunch. I decide to sit here a minute and come down to 
earth. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Space Camp program has been so successful that an affiliate center 
(grades 4-7) opened last year, adjacent to the Kennedy Space Center on the east 
coast of Florida, sponsored in part by NASA's original Mercury astronauts 
through their Mercury 7 Foundation. Nippon Steel has been licensed to open a 
Space World franchise in Japan next spring. 
</P>
<P>
The center has a snack bar for fast food, and a cafeteria. Campers eat all 
meals at the cafeteria. An informal poll rated the food hot, varied and 
unexceptional. 
</P>
<P>
Family members can stay at the Huntsville Marriott a short walk away. It offers 
the usual Marriott facilities including restaurants, and advertises a special 
Space Camp family rate. Call the hotel at (205) 830-2222. 
</P>
<P>
Programs for both young campers and academy participants run all year. All 
adult programs take place Friday through Sunday in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
The center recommends early registration for Space Camp and Space Academy 
programs. Easter holidays and June and July programs fill quickly. Many schools 
provide credit for students who must miss classes to attend the camp. 
</P>
<P>
Tuition, which includes meals, lodging and all activities, ranges from $425 for 
the five-day Space Camp fall session to $800 for the 10-day Level II Space 
Academy summer session. Scholarships are available. Adult sessions cost $450.

FOOTLOOSE: THE CROSSROADS OF EUROPE AND ASIA

ISTANBUL, Turkey 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once described as a comely bride adorned enticingly for her husband, this 
color-splashed city is more than that, being a fetching combination of earth 
mother, saucy soubrette, harridan and grand dame at the doorway of Asia Minor. 
</P>
<P>
With one foot in Europe and the other in Asia, Istanbul's setting at the 
confluence of the Sea of Marmara, Golden Horn and Bosporus, is unrivaled by any 
other city -- Rio de Janeiro, San Francisco and Naples included. 
</P>
<P>
Istanbul's checkered history and changing fate began as a fishing village about 
1000 BC. It became the Greek Byzantium a few centuries later and, after 
accepting Rome's influence and fighting wars between the empire's various 
factions, it fell to Constantine the Great and Christianity in AD 330. 
</P>
<P>
He proclaimed it "New Rome," renamed it Constantinople and made it capital of 
the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire until conquered by Ottoman Turks in 1453. 
</P>
<P>
Understanding Istanbul's past helps to appreciate the city's attractions today: 
bits of Greek statuary; Roman forums, hippodrome and aqueduct; majestic Ottoman 
palaces, the great Christian church-Muslim mosque of St. Sophia. 
</P>
<P>
These and other priceless legacies from Hellenic, Christian and Muslim eras 
have made the city an exciting first step into a country that yearly lures 
great numbers of visitors from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: Fly British Airways, Pan Am, Lufthansa, KLM or SAS. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? Four days will keep you hopping, what with a day's cruise up 
the Bosporus for lunch near the Black Sea and perhaps another day over to Bursa 
for a look at the Asian side. Lodging costs are expensive, but great Turkish 
food is a huge bargain. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: The Turkish lira recently sold at 2,200 to the dollar, about 
.00045 each. Visit any time from spring through November. Cabs are reasonable 
and the town has 17,000 of them, but make sure you get one with a meter. And 
stick to bottled water, even in the best hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: Hotel Gezi (Mete Caddesi 42; $74 to $97 double B&amp;B) has 
a wonderful location, with fine views of the city and Bosporus. Bedrooms are 
contemporary in decor, and there are sparkling marble baths, mini-bars and TV. 
</P>
<P>
The Hotel Riva (Aydede Caddesi 8; $95 B&amp;B double), like most hotels, is on 
the "newer" Beyoglu side of the Golden Horn. It's modern, with a restaurant 
cantilevered over the lobby on a balcony. Bedrooms are neat, basic and on the 
small side. The cellar breakfast room serves as the Riva Pub in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel Eresin (Topcu Caddesi 34; $100 B&amp;B double), at the heart of Beyoglu, 
has a pleasant marble lobby. While the bedrooms are also small, they're pretty, 
bright and have all the big hotel amenities. Buffet breakfasts there are more 
like a hearty brunch. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: You'll find plenty of lamb and fresh seafood, but some 
of the more interesting specialties never make it out of the country. Try the 
pedici -- a flat, pita-like bread topped with cheese, ground meat or eggs, then 
baked. Lahmacun also uses pita bread as a base for a soft pizza delight that's 
inexpensive. 
</P>
<P>
Turks have at least 150 ways of preparing eggplant and all are colorful and 
delicious, like most of their fresh vegetable dishes. Cankaya is a good white 
wine from the Ankara region. Doluca Akik Beyoz also is excellent. 
</P>
<P>
Dining well: Pandeli (above the Spice Market by the Galata Bridge) has achieved 
a worldwide reputation for authentic Turkish food in a romantic setting 
overlooking the Bosporus. Everything we had was luscious: fried mussels, kebabs 
on eggplant, lamb shish kebab and koftes (a spicy lamb patty). Menus have 
English translations, and most main dishes are $3-$5. 
</P>
<P>
Akvaryum (Capariz Sok. 39) is one of about 35 small fish places in the Kumkapi 
area of the old part of town, southwest of the Golden Horn. Just look for the 
word balik, which means "fish," over the door, then go in for the very best 
seafood. Try Akvaryum's swordfish kebab skewered with fresh bay leaf. At night 
the area comes alive with street musicians, which you invite inside to play, 
and then tip. Some groups even bring along their own belly dancer. 
</P>
<P>
Palet No. 3 (Tarabaya village on Bosporus) is about a 20-mile cab ride from 
Istanbul. Or take a ferry from the Galata Bridge, but make sure you get Palet 
No. 3. It's on a small marina, open to the street, offering music in the 
evenings. The mezes (hors d'oeuvres) are numerous, the main dishes superb. 
</P>
<P>
Going first-class: In the last three decades the Hilton (Cumhuriyet Caddesi; 
$145-$170 double) has become a showplace and social center, with probably the 
finest view in the city. Its lobby is also the best people-watching spot in 
town: women in purdah, sheiks in flowing robes, European industrialists meeting 
for drinks. 
</P>
<P>
The Hilton has every possible luxury, from pool and squash court to helicopter 
pad. The rooftop Rotisserie is considered Istanbul's most chic dining spot, and 
it served us the best meal we had had since the French Riviera. Stop by for a 
drink in the Rotisserie's Kiz Kulesi Bar. 
</P>
<P>
Established in 1892 to accommodate passengers of the Orient Express, the Pera 
Palace (Mesrutiyet Caddesi 98; $148 double) has a guest book that runs the 
gamut from Kemal Ataturk to Agatha Christie. The main lounge is a masterwork of 
wood paneling and marble soaring up to glass cupolas in the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
A club-like bar has an antique chandelier, a cool terrace and a 78 rpm 
Victrola. Everything about the Pera Palace whisks you back to the last century, 
but the busy lobby is cluttered with tour desks, posters and other tacky 
paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
Yesil Ev (Kabasakal Caddesi 5; $120 double) is one of the last 19th-Century 
Ottoman mansions, now converted into a magnificent hotel. It's in the old part 
of town near St. Sophia, Topkapi Palace and the Sultan Ahmet Mosque (Blue 
Mosque). Each bedroom has its own color scheme and period furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasha's Suite ($180) is a fantasy of white and gold baroque furniture, an 
Alexander Bell telephone that still works and private Turkish bath with marble 
massage table. Take your meals in the flowery garden beneath magnolia and fig 
trees by a tinkling fountain. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: Start making a small dent in the city's attractions by visiting 
the Blue Mosque, so called for its interior of blue tiles; Suleyman Mosque, 
begun in 1550 and probably the town's most beautiful, and St. Sophia Museum, 
built by Emperor Constantine, later a mosque and finally desanctified by Kemal 
Ataturk. 
</P>
<P>
Palaces come next. Spend an hour or so in Topkapi, where 24 kitchens (now 
displaying jewels and porcelains) once turned out meals for the 4,000 people 
who lived and worked there. Gigantic Dolmabahce Palace on the Bosporus also is 
worth a visit, but the lines are horrendous. So cross the Bosporus on the 
Ataturk Bridge and see the summer palace of Beylerbeyi, where the sultan and 
his harem went during hot months. 
</P>
<P>
Take a ferry ride up to the Black Sea, visit the Turkish and Islamic Arts 
Museum and get lost in the bazaar looking for a Turkish carpet. 
</P>
<P>
For more information: Call the Turkish Culture &amp; Information Attache at 
(212) 687-2194, or write (821 United Nations Plaza, New York 10017) for a 
brochure-city map of Istanbul giving descriptions and locations of sights and 
many hotels.

YOUTH BEAT: LIFTCENTER MIGHT BE TICKET TO RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

routes.

AMSTERDAM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the second floor of 256 N. Z. Voorburgwal, near Dam Square here, is a budget 
agency that can save you money. 
</P>
<P>
The International Liftcenter offers a variety of budget travel services, 
including one that matches drivers who want to cut expenses with passengers 
willing to contribute to fuel costs. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you're in Amsterdam and want to go to Paris, you could call or 
drop into the office to check if any Paris-bound drivers are seeking riders. 
They may know several days in advance about a car heading that way, or just 
hours in advance. It's always wise to check more than once. 
</P>
<P>
If they can arrange the ride, you'll be charged a service fee of 14 guilders 
(about $7) and a maximum of 30 guilders toward fuel costs. That fuel charge 
could be reduced if several riders share the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Chances are, economical rides can be found to several European destinations. 
The fee for a ride to Barcelona or Florence, for example, is a 24-guilder 
service charge plus a maximum of 90 guilders for fuel. From Amsterdam to Lisbon 
the charges are 27 guilders and 140 guilders, respectively. To Athens it's 27 
and 150. 
</P>
<P>
The Liftcenter is linked to Eurostop, a network of similar services in 37 
European cities. Together they produce a 64-page booklet that lists about 80 
offices providing this type of service, in seven countries. 
</P>
<P>
The publication, which costs 2.50 guilders, also includes information on budget 
accommodations, restaurants and tourist information offices in the cities where 
the offices are. Copies can be bought at the Amsterdam office. 
</P>
<P>
The Amsterdam Liftcenter, which has been in business for four years, also 
arranges alternative forms of budget transportation. For example, they have 
made arrangements with luxury bus services to fill their unsold seats at 
reduced rates. 
</P>
<P>
While I was visiting the Liftcenter it was possible to buy a one-way fare to 
Barcelona for 105 guilders; the regular rate was 190. Sometimes these fares are 
available a week in advance, sometimes it's just a day or two. 
</P>
<P>
Other last-minute bus destinations include the six-hour trip to Paris for 55 
guilders, London for 75 guilders, Innsbruck for 105 guilders, Lisbon for 255 
guilders, Florence for 125 guilders and Rome for 135 guilders. 
</P>
<P>
Another type of inexpensive bus fare you can buy at the Liftcenter is called 
Budget Bus. Luxury buses are used on most routes, but don't expect them on the 
Greece and Yugoslavia runs. 
</P>
<P>
Budget Bus has an office of its own in Amsterdam at 10 Rokin, also near Dam 
Square. It offers a variety of cheap one-way fares; for example, Amsterdam to 
Greece for 225 guilders if you are under 26, and 250 guilders for older 
passengers. It also offers five "Capital Tripper" fares that allow you to spend 
up to six months to cover a designated route. For example, a ticket from 
Amsterdam to London, Paris, Lisbon and Barcelona plus return to Amsterdam is 
360 guilders. 
</P>
<P>
The Liftcenter also sells Transalpino rail tickets. These are special reduced 
rail fares for international trips that are sold throughout Europe to people 
under 26. You have up to two months to complete a journey. 
</P>
<P>
While you are in Amsterdam you can get help with information on what to see, 
the transportation system, entertainment, budget lodgings and emergency 
services in a free copy of "Use It," available upon request at the tourist 
information office outside Central Station.

SMALL SHAKER VILLAGE OFFERS LESSON IN HISTORY

PLEASANT HILL, Ky. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To me, Shaker always signified a certain style of chair and a lot of money for 
the seller. 
</P>
<P>
Now I know Shakers as a people -- who they were, what they believed, where they 
lived. 
</P>
<P>
The Shaker Village of Pleasant Hill, commonly known as Shakertown, in the 
Bluegrass region of Kentucky, 25 miles southwest of Lexington, supplied all the 
answers. 
</P>
<P>
Pleasant Hill is one of America's most successful religious communal societies. 
Established by the Shakers in 1805, it has been accurately restored by a 
nonprofit preservation group, recreating the Shaker environment, with 27 of the 
original buildings accessible. The Department of the Interior has declared 
Pleasant Hill a national landmark. 
</P>
<P>
Shaker Village first opened to the public in April, 1968, after decades of 
deterioration and neglect, to illuminate memories of a simpler time, little 
known and long forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Progressive Principles 
</P>
<P>
The Shakers were religious zealots who upheld principles foreign to their time 
-- the early and mid-19th Century. Their progressive concepts espoused racial 
and sexual equality, environmental conservation, staunch pacifism, collective 
holdings of goods and property. They also insisted upon celibacy. 
</P>
<P>
Dissidents from the English Quaker Church, they had earned the derisive title 
of "Shaking Quakers" because of their frenetic shaking and whirling dances, 
part of their worship ritual. 
</P>
<P>
In 1774, their leader, Mother Ann Lee, an inspired prophetess, set sail from 
Liverpool with eight disciples, following release from prison for disturbing 
the peace. 
</P>
<P>
Within 10 years, 11 Shaker villages were founded in New England and New York. 
The Pleasant Hill village was founded on land owned by a farmer who had been 
converted to the religion. By 1820, Shaker mills and shops were supplying 
markets throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years later, the village, prosperous and self-sustaining, and encompassing 
5,000 acres, had grown to nearly 500 inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
The Shakers encouraged the growth of new crops, tested and grafted different 
kinds of fruit, experimented with feed, soils and fertilizers, and cultivated 
the most prolific nurseries and orchards in the Ohio Valley. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quality Products 
</P>
<P>
Shaker women achieved recognition for quality merchandise, pursuing a thriving 
business in willow baskets, rag carpets, woolen goods, palm-leaf bonnets, 
cornshuck mattresses, pickles, preserves and pressed cheese -- sold to ready 
consumers in the "outside world." 
</P>
<P>
During the Civil War, the Shaker community suffered reversals from which it 
never recovered. As Southern markets were being destroyed, villagers were 
called upon to feed and care for the wounded of both Union and Confederate 
forces, a charitable undertaking that depleted their supplies. 
</P>
<P>
In 1896, the Shakers were forced to mortgage their land. The last Shaker, an 
aged woman, died at Pleasant Hill in 1923. 
</P>
<P>
One year later, an auction of buildings and furniture took place. During the 
next 40 years, ownership changed several times. Finally, in 1961, a group of 
private citizens enlisted support to save the remaining buildings and extensive 
farmlands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Angus Cattle 
</P>
<P>
Situated on 2,250 acres of serene countryside, Pleasant Hill is currently 
operated as a modern farm with corn, tobacco crops and a herd of Angus cattle. 
</P>
<P>
In the kitchens of the 40-room Centre Family House, now serving as the museum, 
one sees the ingenious tools that helped the Shakers cook in quantity: the pea 
sheller, double-barreled Shaker stove, cylindrical wooden meat grinder, cider 
press and automated apple peeler. 
</P>
<P>
Each time we use a flat broom, wooden clothes pin, circular saw or washing 
machine, we are using one of the many Shaker inventions. 
</P>
<P>
A plaque in the water house explains that the Shakers, in 1831, initiated the 
first civic waterworks west of the Alleghenies. Water was pumped from the 
spring by horsepower a half-mile up a hill to the water house, where it flowed 
by gravity through pipes to village kitchens and cellars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flawless Craftsmanship 
</P>
<P>
The Shakers' talents remain widely recognized and acclaimed, their fine design 
and flawless craftsmanship a perpetual monument on the village grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Outstanding are the graceful, superbly executed twin stairways in the Trustees' 
House, which contains the public dining rooms and superior network of notched 
trusses in the attic of the Meeting House. 
</P>
<P>
Dual staircases and entrances were obligatory, since men occupied one side of 
the dwelling house, women the other. Strict laws of chastity kept the two 
forever apart. 
</P>
<P>
The society was divided into five communal families, each numbering from 50 to 
100 members. In these semi-autonomous units, every family had its own home, 
shop, barn, field and orchard. 
</P>
<P>
Above the main room in the Meeting House were apartments of the Ministry, a 
ruling body of two elders and two eldresses, who wielded equal authority. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shaker Dances 
</P>
<P>
After weekly meditation and singing in the somewhat primitive Baptist style of 
linking out songs, Sunday worshipers pushed the benches back and started their 
intensely emotional, impassioned religious dances. 
</P>
<P>
"They put their whole body into motion, got down to the floor, leaped up, 
twirled and shaked away their sins," said a Shaker Village guide. 
</P>
<P>
Begun in 1824, with outside walls of stone almost three feet thick, the Centre 
Family House -- the largest dwelling, with three spacious floors and a cellar, 
and built for the most spiritually advanced -- was home to more than 100 
families. 
</P>
<P>
Furnishings are original, except for the chairs in the hall and the stoves. 
Furniture had to be plain and utilitarian, with no allowance for ornamentation. 
Many of the simple, clean lines have been copied by the Danish Modern style. 
</P>
<P>
Beds with slatted headboards look like Frank Lloyd Wright creations. No one 
seems to know why the celebrated Shaker chairs were buit low to the ground. On 
bureau tops are the famous oval Shaker boxes, in graduated sizes. Reproductions 
are still a best seller in gift catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
In the Centre Family House, the bannister railing is magnificently crafted from 
a single section of walnut, 30 feet long. An office contains interior windows. 
Shakers considered circulation of air to be important to good health. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vocational Talents 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations by skilled artisans afford a glimpse into the vocational talents 
of the Shakers, disciplined by a creed of maximum utility, wasting neither 
time, material nor resources. Each engaged in labor, from members of the 
ministry to humblest converts, practicing Mother Ann's dictum: Put your hands 
to work and your hearts to God. 
</P>
<P>
Weavers in the Sisters' Shop operate spinning wheels and looms. Candle dipping, 
soap rendering, basketry, tinsmithing and tole painting are ongoing 
presentations. Coopers turn out one butter churn, one bucket and three dippers 
a day. 
</P>
<P>
Displayed at the East Family Wash House is a rare and outstanding assortment of 
quilts. "The Shakers would have worked in groups, but I work alone," said an 
accomplished homemaker seated before the nine-foot-long original quilting 
frame. 
</P>
<P>
It takes this skilled craftswoman from five to 10 months, eight hours a day, 
five days a week, to complete a quilt. One coverlet consisted of a pattern of 
50 stars stitched into the fabric, with a colorful floral border. Another, 
beautifully crafted in orange and green, outlined the symbol of all Shaker 
villages: the tree of life. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Rates for tours of Shaker Village are $5.50 for adults, $2.50 for students. 
</P>
<P>
Lodging is in the Shaker tradition, with accommodations in 15 original 
dwellings. Guest rooms are furnished in handwoven spreads, curtains, rugs and 
reproduction Shaker pieces, including the typically high bed and trundles that 
slide underneath. 
</P>
<P>
We stayed at the Old Stone Shop, built in 1811 as a residence, then used for a 
workshop and eventually converted into offices for the village physician and 
dentist after the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
Clothes are hung Shaker-style on hardwood pegs that line the wall. There are no 
closets. Twentieth-century concessions comfortably intrude: modern bath and TV 
in each room, and air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
Breakfast is a bountiful country buffet: juice, eggs, sausage, bacon, 
hashbrowns, breads, fruit compote, buttered grits, cobbler. For calorie 
counters, the continental menu includes juice, beverage and as many warm, flaky 
biscuits and pumpkin muffins as you dare devour. 
</P>
<P>
Dinners rank as the hallmark of Kentucky down-home hospitality: Abundant 
appetizers and entrees supplemented by vegetables straight from the village 
garden, and pastry baked on the premises. A favorite of ours was Shaker lemon 
pie, a double-crusted dessert with a tart custard filling. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the year, a varied calendar of events includes guided nature walks, 
performances by the Louisville Ballet Company, pageants of Shaker music, folk 
singers, wagon and sleigh rides, and visiting artisans. 
</P>
<P>
Riverboat excursions on a paddlewheel depart in the morning and afternoon 
during spring, summer and fall. The village is closed Christmas Eve and 
Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
Special winter weekends are planned for Dec. 27-28; Jan. 12-13, 19-20, 26-27,

breakfast, a tour ticket for all exhibition buildings open on Saturday, a

</P>
<P>

a village tour ticket, available Sunday through Thursday nights Nov. 26 to Dec. 
21, and Jan. 14 through March 8. The price is $85.

BARGAIN CORNER: LUFTHANSA AND KLM OFFER INCENTIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lufthansa again is offering a complimentary Avis rental car for one week to 
passengers flying round trip from the United States to Frankfurt. The offer is 
good from now through March 31, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Two people have to fly together between Sunday and Thursday, paying any of 
Lufthansa's regular fares, excluding its nonrefundable Special Saver fare. The 
offer is good, however, with the airline's APEX fare. 
</P>
<P>
Reservations for the car have to be made at least 14 days before departure, 
with Lufthansa taking care of the booking. You can pick up the car at the 
airports in Frankfurt, Munich, Vienna and 15 other German and Austrian cities. 
Have your Lufthansa ticket ready to show at the Avis counter. 
</P>
<P>
The offer includes unlimited mileage and the value-added tax in both West 
Germany and Austria. In addition, you have free drop-off privileges when you 
return the car to an Avis station served by Lufthansa, as long as it's in the 
same country in which you picked up the auto. 
</P>
<P>
Another off-season offer comes from KLM. If you fly round trip to Amsterdam on 
the Dutch airline, you're entitled to the Happy Holland Bargain. This offers 
you your first night's accommodation in Amsterdam for $20 to $40 per person 
based on double occupancy, depending on the hotel. Continental breakfast is 
included, along with taxes and service charges. One child under 12 is free when 
sharing the room with two adults. 
</P>
<P>
If you're traveling solo, you can get rooms from $30 to $70. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one hotels, mostly in downtown Amsterdam, are participating in the 
program. The offer is good until April 1, 1990. The hotel booking should be 
made in the United States, and can be processed by KLM at the time of the air 
booking. 
</P>
<P>
Contact Lufthansa at toll-free (800) 645-3880 and KLM at (800) 777-5553. JACK

TEXAN FRUITCAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I thoroughly enjoyed David M. Kinchen's article about Corsicana fruitcakes and 
Texas courthouses ("Locate the Fruitcake and You Get a Lone Star," Oct. 15), 
but I must voice my disappointment that he did not include the courthouses in 
Hillsboro and Marshall -- both singled out by art historians as being 
outstanding examples of Victorian architecture in Texas.

IGNORANT AND INEFFICIENT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Peter S. Greenberg's article ("It's Time for Business to Get Back to the 
Basics," Oct. 15) about the lack of service for the traveler is right on 
target. However, it reminds me that during 15 years of almost weekly travel in 
the United States, and a total of nearly 30 months' travel throughout Europe 
over several years, it is amazing how many stupid, ignorant, inefficient and 
rude people I have met when I was in a bad mood.

TREKKING IN NEPAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frank Riley's article on trekking in Nepal ("Colorful Nepal Is Still a Favorite 
Spot for Treks," Oct. 22) is preceded by a small heading: "Adventure Travel." 
From our experience, his descriptions should be classified as "Adventure Travel 
For People With Money to Burn." 
</P>
<P>
It is completely unnecessary to book Nepal treks from home because trekking 
companies are plentiful throughout Katmandu and Pokhara, and the rates are 
roughly half those quoted in the article. 
</P>
<P>
It does take a day for the trekking company to obtain trekking permits and 
food, but most travelers would probably appreciate a day to recover from the 
long flight before setting out on a trek. 
</P>
<P>
Trips to Chitwan National Park are also very inexpensive ($45 per person for a 
three-day trip, including bus transportation) for people willing to put up with 
rustic accommodations and no electricity. For us, this price included food, 
accommodations, an elephant ride, a jungle walk, bird watching and a canoe 
ride, as well as the biggest adventure of all: a nine-hour ride on the roof of 
a bus with 50 other people and a goat, to return to Katmandu. 
</P>
<P>
For some people, this may be a bit too much of an adventure!

OUTTAKES: SHE WAS NO ANGEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back in the late '60s, Theresa Saldana's mom was furious when she joined a 
Brooklyn gang called the Little Warriors. Now the actress portrays a mom who's 
harassed when her son refuses to join a gang in "Angel Town," an independent 
action flick (it stars kick boxer Olivier Gruner) set for Nov. 22 release. 
</P>
<P>
"It was nothing like the gangs we have now," said Saldana, who was "12 or 13" 
when she briefly became a Warrior. "Our gang was more for the purpose of 
hanging out together than anything else. It was like a baby version of (the 
movie) 'Turf.' But in truth, there are violent gangs in that same neighborhood 
today. If some of the same kids had grown up later, who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
Saldana's mom, feeling the other gang members were "too rowdy," shipped young 
Theresa off "to a Catholic camp in the Poconos, where I was frankly much 
happier."

OUTTAKES: HATCHET MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Stacy Jenel Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember New Century/Vista's "The Stepfather," the 1987 suspense thriller about 
a murderous family man? It won positive reviews, but never did find an audience 
-- despite four different ad campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
So why are we getting "Stepfather II," opening in N.Y.C. this weekend, with a 
release here Friday? 
</P>
<P>
"There is a strong, strong awareness of the first movie," figured Russell 
Schwartz, exec VP of Miramax Films, which releases "II" through its Millimeter 
Films division -- awareness based partly on the original's exposure in cassette 
and TV syndication. 
</P>
<P>
As for advertising this time around: "We're not pulling any punches. . . . 
We've made a very substantial TV buy and we're going big and broad." 
</P>
<P>
That includes two TV campaigns -- a genre horror spot, another aimed at an 
upscale audience, focusing on the movie's psychological aspects. 
</P>

This CD gives us the peerless Warren baritone in live recital 31 years ago, 
less than two years before his untimely death. Moreover eight songs are 
included which were not on the original LP. Warren lavished his faultless 
technique and mighty instrument with as much care and seriousness of purpose on 
concert chestnuts and English-language throwaways as he did on his familiar 
operatic specialties. Even in a folk song like "Colorado Trail" we hear a 
perfectly controlled forte, mezza voce, pianissimo and diminuendo. Compared to 
earlier versions, the "Faust," "Falstaff" and "Chenier" arias retain the wonted 
beauty of sound, but one discovers addded colors and nuances. WALTER PRICE

(1987) -- both premiered in Los Angeles -- frame the disc. Both are big, 
three-movement works of characteristically intense sonorities and complex, 
varied textures, and both offer ample opportunities for tightly meshed 
virtuosity. The performances, under Lazarof's direction, are incisively paced 
chains of explosions. Also included are the String Quartet from 1980, and 
Chamber Music/LA director Yukiko Kamei's soaring, probing account of the Lyric 
Suite for Solo Violin (1983). John Henken

Ramey ventures unhackneyed repertory including the "Don Carlos" and "Vepres 
siciliennes" arias in the original French, relatively unfamiliar arias from 
"Robert le Diable" and "Comte Ory," and "La calunnia" in its original key. His 
basso is rich and even from top to bottom. Lacking, however, is vocal 
personality or musical imagination. There is little attempt at 
characterization; Fiesco sounds much the same as Zaccaria. Mephisto's aria from 
Berlioz' "Damnation" lacks insinuating, dark humor. The plodding accompaniments 
of Delacote are no help. Walter Price

MUSIC &amp; DANCE NEWS: MICHAEL SMUIN TO DIRECT ABT GALA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 50th-anniversary gala celebration of the American Ballet Theatre has been 
in the planning stages for months. To be given at the Metropolitan Opera House 
in New York City, Jan. 14, the performance will be directed by Michael Smuin, 
former artistic director of San Francisco Ballet (1973-84) and an ABT alumnus 
(he danced in the company, 1966-73). 
</P>
<P>
"Misha (Baryshnikov, former ABT director) called me last summer and asked me to 
put this together. I asked him why me, and he said: 'Because you've already 
done a 50th-anniversary gala. Now do ours.' " 
</P>
<P>
Smuin recalls that he created the three-act, 50th San Francisco Ballet 
anniversary program over a period of three years, and with a cast headed by 
Gene Kelly. When it was performed in War Memorial Opera House, it ran for eight 
consecutive nights. 
</P>
<P>
On the phone from New York, Smuin says: "My job with the ABT gala is to tell 
the history of the company in as entertaining a way as possible. What I did 
first, before I met with anyone from the company, was write a scenario and make 
a budget. When I got here with them, both were approved." 
</P>
<P>
The plan is this, he says: "There are two acts, each one more or less covering 
25 years. Leonard Bernstein is writing a fanfare to be played on the plaza 
before the gala, and inside, as an overture. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be, all told, five long film clips, detailing the company's 
history. I'm trying to get as many of the illustrious star alumni to appear -- 
it's not so easy, since many of them have died." 
</P>
<P>
Major appearances, however, have been promised by choreographers Agnes de 
Mille, Jerome Robbins and Eliot Feld, designer Oliver Smith and ballerinas 
Alicia Alonso, Carla Fracci and Natalia Makarova. 
</P>
<P>
"And, at the end, there will be an anniversary waltz, with perhaps 30 couples 
onstage." 
</P>
<P>
Tickets will be priced at $1,250, $1,000, $300, $85, $50, $25 and $20. 
</P>
<P>
In this project, Smuin -- who has spend much of the last five years as a 
Broadway choreographer -- says he is working closely with ABT executive 
director Jane Hermann. Because of the cost of producing the one-night-only 
gala, a tour version of the program will be part of the repertory for the 
company's spring tour. 
</P>
<P>
The ABT spring tour opens in Miami Jan. 29 and closes in Washington April 8, 
with intermediate stops in Chicago, San Francisco, Costa Mesa (March 6-18) and 
Toronto. The company will dance in Los Angeles in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion 
at the Music Center next summer (July 31-Aug. 12). 
</P>
<P>
"We won't be able to have all the special guests on tour, of course, but, since 
there are alumni everywhere, we hope to incorporate appearances by ABT people 
at each stop. In Chicago, for instance, it would be great to have Maria 
Tallchief (a ballerina from the 1940s) take part." 
</P>
<P>
Smuin's job will be done Jan. 15, however. After that, he reports, his next 
project is a musical based on James Clavell's "Shogun," with a score by Paul 
Chihara, set to open at the Kennedy Center in May. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of graphs to come on Smuin talking about his directing the ABT, 
currently without an artistic director since September, when Baryshnikov quit 
in a well-publicized power struggle with the board after nine years with the 
company. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Goddess or gooney bird? Even some of this English progressive popstress' 
loyalists sometimes have to wonder. Though on 1985's "Hounds of Love" Bush 
stripped away many of the quirks of youthful exuberance that had marred her 
unique approach, some will always find her attention-getting vocals precious 
and her quasi-cosmic outlook and naked emotionalism off-putting. But this, her 
first album since "Hounds," is even more mature and accomplished. As Bush 
herself sings in "The Fog," "You see, I'm all grown up now." 
</P>
<P>
The glorious Trio Bulgarka sings on three songs, further expanding Bush's 
already thoroughly developed world vision -- perhaps only Peter Gabriel melds 
so many cultural elements with such seamless flair. But it's the how, not the 
what, that distinguishes her accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
Listen to the mournful Balkan wail that punctuates "Deeper Understanding's" 
look at loneliness in the computer age. No Post-Modern irony or juxtaposition 
here; rather, the combination transforms the song into a wide-eyed-wonderful 
essay on the human condition, with all the sensuality promised in the album 
title. It's enough to make you go, well, gooney. STEVE HOCHMAN

RECORD RACK: GARCIA PUTS LIFE INTO DEAD'S 'BUILT'; 
</P>
<P>
GRATEFUL DEAD "BUILT TO LAST," ARISTA ** 1/2: 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When it's Uncle Jerry's Band, the Dead is something to hear. But when Jerry 
Garcia steps back and lets the other guys take over, "Built to Last" subsides 
into something less durable. The best songs are the three valedictory numbers 
sung and co-written by Garcia. They're fine (especially the title track), 
except when Brent Mydland's incongruous synthesizer flourishes creep into the 
Dead's woody sound, like prefab housing thrown up in a fine old historic 
district. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of Mydland songs about relationship woes provide a good counterpoint 
on Side 1 to Garcia's philosophic overviews about striving, understanding and 
enduring. But Mydland winds up singing four of the album's nine songs, giving 
too much weight to a singer who, while earnest enough, is basically a 
second-string Bob Seger. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Weir's two contributions are bookend songs about doubt and inspiration -- 
the doubt-ridden number, "Victim or the Crime," giving the Dead a chance for 
some dark blazing that belies the band's reputation as just a sunny, loping 
sound track for the free-form dancing of tie-dyed concert fans. "Built to Last" 
holds up well as a thematically coherent look at the prospects for getting by, 
and maybe even soaring a bit, in a fallen and dangerous world. But taken one by 
one, most of the songs don't live up to the title's warranty. MIKE BOEHM

Gaelic New Age music? Hmmm, an interesting idea. Fraser and Machlis have 
composed and adapted some traditional-sounding Irish themes into a very 
untraditional format. Fraser's fiddle playing, rich in ornamental twists and 
turns, is juxtaposed against the strikingly contemporary settings created by 
Machlis' piano and synthesizer. 
</P>
<P>
The results, even in pieces like the sprightly "Cowboy Jig," are fascinating -- 
a convincing interface between old and new. At its best -- "Bovaglie's Plaid" 
is a stirring example -- the blend of synthesizer and fiddle will bring 
passionate tears to the hearts of the most hidebound traditionalists. DON

UNDERSTAFFING STRAINS S.D. BORDER PATROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost three years after Congress and the White House pledged a 50% increase in 
U.S. Border Patrol staffing as part of sweeping immigration reform, the number 
of agents in the San Diego area has plummeted to a four-year low, straining 
officers' ability to deter the huge number of undocumented people who daily 
attempt to enter the United States from Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
That fact, officials say, has increased stress among officers and left 
supervisors scrambling to plug enforcement holes in San Diego, the most crucial 
corridor along the nearly 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border. It is estimated that 
almost half of all illegal entries into the United States are made through a 
10-mile swath of frontier in San Diego, primarily because it leads to the 
booming immigrant job markets of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
At times, a lack of officers has prompted authorities to reduce inspections or 
shut down operations outright at the giant immigration checkpoint along 
Interstate 5 near San Clemente, which is considered one of the agency's key 
enforcement tools. The checkpoint is operating at slightly more than half of 
its authorized officer strength, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Border Patrol staffing nationwide has risen about 16% in the last 
three years, to about 3,750 officers, the San Diego sector has dropped below 
1986 levels, to 712 agents. Officials blame the decline on a yearlong hiring 
freeze, high attrition rates because of the cost of living in San Diego County 
and the fact that Congress has never come through with the funding for all the 
officers promised as part of immigration reform. 
</P>
<P>
The Border Patrol staff decline here comes at a time when the agency has had an 
expanding roster of responsibilities nationwide, including increasing 
involvement in anti-drug-smuggling activities and the investigation of 
employers who illegally hire undocumented workers. 
</P>
<P>
The manpower shortage, authorities say, has led supervisors in San Diego to 
rely increasingly on overtime and internal transfers in an effort to bolster 
trouble spots. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we need to bring more people on board," said Miguel Vallina, 
assistant chief patrol agent in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation for American Immigration 
Reform, a conservative Washington-based pressure group, called the decline in 
Border Patrol staffing in San Diego "a disaster," adding, "It represents an 
erosion at the wrong time of many of the gains in improving immigration 
enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
A Border Patrol-wide hiring freeze has been in effect for almost a year because 
of federal budget constraints, preventing authorities from filling vacancies 
caused by transfer, retirement or other factors. Although the freeze has been 
felt nationwide, its impact has been particularly acute in San Diego, which 
loses more than 10% of its agents each year, one of the highest attrition rates 
in the service. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Davidian, Western regional commissioner for the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, parent body of the Border Patrol, said the lack of 
staff has probably heightened tensions among individual agents. 
</P>
<P>
"Increased stress and tension come from understaffing," said Davidian, who 
assumed his post in mid-August and has spent considerable time on the border 
since then. "Anyone who's put into a situation like this, it's understandable 
that the string gets pulled a little too tight. You pull it too tight, and it 
may snap." 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Davidian said, he has "no doubt" that staff shortage-related 
stress may have contributed to an incident in August in which a patrol agent in 
San Diego directed amplified racial and sexual slurs at hundreds of 
undocumented people gathered along the border. The U.S. Justice Department says 
it is investigating the incident, which was witnessed by three American 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's a more frustrating job on the planet than being a Border 
Patrol agent in the San Diego sector," said Davidian, who said pushing for more 
agents is a top priority. 
</P>
<P>
The staff shortages, agent Vallina said, have also sometimes forced the agency 
to cut back the number of agents posted directly along the border, or "line," 
thus reducing the rate of apprehensions of illegal immigrants. Although INS 
officials in Washington have often cited the reduced arrest numbers as evidence 
that the 1986 law is deterring illegal entry, Vallina conceded that manpower 
deficiencies may also partly explain the decline. 
</P>
<P>
"The number of arrests is going to be commensurate with the number of people on 
the line," Vallina said. "We're dealing with just about the same numbers of 
aliens coming across, we just don't have many people on the line." 
</P>
<P>
During the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, agents along the U.S.-Mexico border 
recorded about 850,000 arrests of undocumented foreigners, a decrease of 9.3% 
from the previous year. It was the third consecutive year in which the number 
of apprehensions declined. 
</P>
<P>
The 50% increase in Border Patrol staffing was one of three key elements of the 
1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act. The law's two other principal sections 
-- amnesty for some illegal immigrants and new penalties against employers who 
hire undocumented workers -- have already been put into effect, with varying 
results. 
</P>
<P>
In authorizing a huge increase in Border Patrol manpower, lawmakers reasoned 
that enhanced enforcement was 
</P>
<P>
a crucial part of any effort to stem the arrival of undocumented foreigners 
through the U.S.-Mexico border. The Border Patrol, which has been in existence 
since 1924, is often referred to as "the first line of defense" against illegal 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the authorized 50% increases, however, Congress never followed through 
with the required appropriations to finance additional hiring. And attrition 
has eaten away at early staff gains from a hiring splurge that followed passage 
of the immigration-reform package. 
</P>
<P>
Since the law's passage, observers say there has been little resolve in 
Washington to bolster the Border Patrol, especially during the current period 
of fiscal austerity. 
</P>
<P>
"With something like that, either the Administration has to take an aggressive 
stance to gain the necessary funding, or, in lieu of that, the Congress has to 
push for it," said one Washington official close to the issue who declined to 
be identified. "Neither one of those things happened." 
</P>
<P>
Exacerbating matters, officials say, is the Border Patrol's traditional role as 
a kind of stepchild of the INS, as well as lack of concern among lawmakers who 
are not from one of the four border states -- California, Arizona, New Mexico 
and Texas. Not one border-state congressman sits on the House appropriations 
subcommittee that determines funding for the INS and other Justice Department 
branches, noted U.S. Rep. Bill Lowery (R-San Diego), who sits on another 
appropriations panel. 
</P>
<P>
"For my colleagues from Iowa or Arkansas, this is not a do-or-die problem, so 
it's tough to get their attention focused on the matter," Lowery said. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the Border Patrol and its supporters have lately been stressing 
the agency's increasing involvement in the drug war, which has considerable 
bipartisan support nationwide. Although the U.S.-Mexico border has long been 
known as a principal conduit for the flow of illegal drugs, Border Patrol drug 
seizures have almost quadrupled in the last four years. Congress last year gave 
patrol agents additional legal authority to arrest drug suspects. 
</P>
<P>
"The only headway we're making is putting it (Border Patrol funding) in the 
context of the drug war," Lowery said. 
</P>
<P>
That may have had some effect. Senate and House conferees drafting a budget 
bill have approved $9 million to finance the hiring of 200 patrol agents next 
year. That awaits final approval, however. 
</P>
<P>
The average number of officers in the San Diego sector was 724 in 1986, 760 in 
1987 and 732 in 1988. In the 1989 fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the average 
number of officers rose to 793. But now, because of heavy attrition and the 
hiring freeze, the number has dropped to 712, a level last seen in fiscal 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities trace the high attrition rate in San Diego to two factors: The high 
cost of living and the general frustration of being a patrol agent here, 
something embodied by the tableau that unfolds nightly along the Tijuana River 
levee in San Diego: A handful of agents attempts to deter thousands of 
undocumented border crossers, sometimes in groups of 100 or more. 
</P>
<P>
A beginning Border Patrol officer earns a base salary of slightly more than 
$18,000 a year. (Starting San Diego police officers earn about $25,000.) The 
Border Patrol salary can be stretched a lot further in rural Texas, where many 
Border Patrol officers reside, than in the San Diego area. Consequently, many 
agents decide to transfer elsewhere in the force. Others jump to other law 
enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Of almost 1,200 new Border Patrol officers hired in San Diego since 1985, fewer 
than half remain with the force. 
</P>
<P>
However, despite the push for Border Patrol staff increases, some are skeptical 
that any number of agents will ever deter the tide of humanity that daily 
arrives at the border, fleeing poverty and political repression. "I think if 
they put Border Patrol agents shoulder to shoulder along the entire 2,000 miles 
of border, these people will still find a way to come to the United States," 
said Roberto Martinez, a rights activist in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Each evening, hundreds of people gather along the border in Tijuana and just 
inside U.S. territory, waiting for an opportunity to enter the United States 
without papers. Most are from Mexico, but many Central Americans are also among 
those massing in Tijuana, and undocumented border-crossers come from as far as 
China and Africa also come to Tijuana to gain quick access to the United 
States.

Bobby McLaughlin is about to get his due for the 6 1/2 years he spent in "the 
gladiator school" and other prisons for a murder he didn't commit. 
</P>
<P>
But the $1.9-million award made recently by New York Court of Claims Judge 
Adolph Orlando will barely begin to soothe the pain. 
</P>
<P>
"People think I'm winning the lottery or something," the former New York 
resident said from his St. Paul apartment. "Well, they owe me. If they had 
given me a choice, I wouldn't have gone through all this for $50 million." 
</P>
<P>
Orlando awarded McLaughlin $1.5 million for "loss of liberty, mental stress, 
anguish and loss of reputation." The judge also ordered payment for lost wages 
and $225,000 in medical expenses for treatment of McLaughlin's addiction to 
cocaine and other drugs that stemmed from his prison experience. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unlikely that he will ever survive the devastating trauma resulting from 
incarceration for a crime he did not commit," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin, 30, was convicted in 1979 in the New York borough of Brooklyn for 
taking part in an armed robbery in which one person was killed. McLaughlin 
received a 15-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin said he was drinking with friends at a bar in his neighborhood the 
night of the killing. He was arrested several days later because the primary 
suspect was reputed to associate with a Robert W. McLaughlin. Detectives 
mistook that man for Bobby, whose middle initial is "K." 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin was picked out of a police lineup by a 15-year-old witness who had 
been told by police that McLaughlin was a friend of the other suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept telling myself it would end but it never did," McLaughlin said. "I 
hated the system for not believing me. It just seemed like they were God -- 
like they could do whatever they liked with my life." 
</P>
<P>
The conviction was overturned in 1986 after McLaughlin's foster father, Jarold 
Hohne, persuaded civil rights lawyer Richard Emery and a police sergeant to 
reopen the case. After four years of relentless work, the only witness who 
identified McLaughlin acknowledged that he was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a nightmare for Bobby from beginning to end," Emery said. "He faced 
it down and he survived like one has to, but he's lost the critical years from 
20 to 26 1/2." 
</P>
<P>
That's how old McLaughlin was during his prison stays at Rikers Island, Sing 
Sing, Elmira and Comstock. The last of those was known as "the gladiator 
school" because there were so many fights, McLaughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
"They prey on the weak and your body is your weapon," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Going into prison, McLaughlin weighed about 150 pounds. He emerged after six 
years of body-building tipping the scales at 200 pounds -- a physique he still 
maintains. 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin said he bulked up to protect himself against constant aggression. 
</P>
<P>
He said he kept a bucket of water next to his bunk to defend against inmates 
known to start gasoline fires in enemy cells. He guarded against early morning 
attacks by waking each day before his cell doors opened. Late sleepers were 
often attacked, he said. 
</P>
<P>
When McLaughlin returned to his Brooklyn apartment, he sometimes slept in the 
cellar because he feared that police would knock on his door and return him to 
prison, said Thomas Duffy, the police sergeant who reopened the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"That kid's finished," Duffy said in a telephone interview from Glendale, 
Ariz., where he is retired. "No amount of counseling will make him normal 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Upon his release from prison, McLaughlin said he reverted to the life he was 
leading at age 19 only to find that many of his friends had careers and 
families and couldn't party with him at Brooklyn bars. 
</P>
<P>
His cocaine abuse started because he wanted "to live the fast life. I was 
trying to catch up too quick and it caught up with me." 
</P>
<P>
The addiction led him to a treatment center in Minnesota, where he has lived 
for the last 18 months and worked as a painter and lawn sprinkler installer. He 
plans to marry in April. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a long way to go," he said. "I'm 30 years old and I still don't know 
what I'm going to do with my life. That hurts." 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin, who still suffers bouts of depression, said he may have to settle 
for less than $1.9 million to avoid a lengthy appeal of the award by the state. 
When he gets the money he says he'll buy a nice car and a place to live. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll go from there," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
To his neighbors, John Cotter Jr. was a wealthy real estate developer who had 
it all, the son of a retired state Supreme Court chief justice, himself the 
patriarch of an elegant family, a loving father who took his son hunting. 
</P>
<P>
But inside, Cotter was tortured by "monsters," tormented by his business 
failures, shattered by the recent discovery that his son had epilepsy. 
</P>
<P>
Hopelessness overtook him and in the end he shot himself -- but not before 
taking the lives of his wife, son and daughter. 
</P>
<P>
The tragedy recalls other cases in which people bent on killing themselves have 
taken innocents, even bystanders, with them -- people like Joseph Wesbecker, 
the former mental patient who in September killed nine, including himself, in a 
Louisville, Ky., printing-plant rampage. 
</P>
<P>
Psychologists and physiologists are only beginning to isolate possible reasons 
for such perplexing behavior. Besides personal pressures that seem unbearable, 
they cite perverse love-hate relationships between some killers and victims, 
and in many cases a deficiency in a message-carrying chemical in the brain. 
</P>
<P>
The details of Cotter's final act provide a dim light down the foreboding 
tunnels of the mind. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing strange about them," said Jane Longley-Cook, a neighbor who 
was in a car pool with Cotter's wife, Anne. 
</P>
<P>
Anne Cotter, 44, was a patron of the arts and a caring mother so thoughtful 
she'd hand out trick-or-treat candy in advance of Halloween if she was going to 
be away. The daughter, Julia, 21, graduated from college last spring with a 
degree in French and planned to spend some time in England. The son, John III, 
17, was enrolled in a private school. 
</P>
<P>
"It probably was the biggest shock of my life," Jane Longley-Cook said of the 
July killings in the three-story brick house across the street. "I don't think 
we'll ever know what causes people to do things like that." 
</P>
<P>
Cotter, a shy, private man of 47, had started seeing a psychiatrist about a 
month before. According to police reports, he indicated to the therapist that 
he was depressed because of, among other things, financial problems and the 
illness of his son, a loner who had few close friends. 
</P>
<P>
About a year earlier, the son suffered a seizure while driving, which led to 
the discovery that he had epilepsy. 
</P>
<P>
The psychiatrist, who prescribed antidepressant drugs for Cotter, would not 
comment on the case, but police said he indicated Cotter never talked about 
taking his own life, let alone killing his family. Just a week or two before 
the shootings, he told the therapist his difficulties seemed to be 
straightening out, according to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
But apparently pressure began to build in a mind psychiatrists say might have 
crossed the line from reality to exaggeration. His last thoughts were scribbled 
on a single page of paper in disjointed and unpunctuated notes: 
</P>
<P>
"Depression 
</P>
<P>
"Shaking uncontrollably inside 
</P>
<P>
"Destitute 
</P>
<P>
"No hope 
</P>
<P>
"No hope for family 
</P>
<P>
"No good insurance 
</P>
<P>
"Epilepsy 
</P>
<P>
"John III is depressed from Tegretol (medication to control seizures) and . . . 
walks the house at night as I do He worries about another seizure and accident, 
becoming a closeted person 
</P>
<P>
"Death, nervous breakdown depression is everywhere 
</P>
<P>
"The monster shakes my body each night and I wake trembling." 
</P>
<P>
The page ended with a reference to his wife, who was mourning the recent loss 
of her mother: 
</P>
<P>
"No future, no hope, suffering for all of us -- she suffered in the past and 
can't suffer again." 
</P>
<P>
Cotter also left an eight-page letter alleging payoffs and the mishandling of 
funds and grants in the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority, which makes 
loans for projects, including low-income housing. Although Cotter did not 
implicate himself, he alleged that the purported scheme to defraud the 
authority involved real estate he had owned. The state is investigating. 
</P>
<P>
Cotter himself was facing a half-dozen civil suits filed by tenants of one of 
his developments seeking more than $2 million in damages from a fire. At a 
probate hearing, a judge said Cotter's estate might not be enough to cover his 
debts. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Alan L. Berman, a professor of psychology at the American University in 
Washington, said Cotter's notes are an expression of tremendous anxiety, fear 
or threat he felt and an inability to separate himself from his family. 
</P>
<P>
Some suicidal people in a twisted state of mind may see those they murder as 
themselves. "They are so fused, so incapable of distinguishing that this other 
person is a separate human being, the suicidal motive extends to having to kill 
this other person as well," said Berman. 
</P>
<P>
The most typical murder-suicide is one in which two partners depend on and 
abuse each other for affection in a love-hate relationship marked by 
separations, threats and accusations of infidelity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They cannot exist separate from each other and they really can't live with 
each other without being abusive. So it's sort of a final act that communicates 
just that and that is: 'I am so despairing because you're threatening to leave 
me. I hate you so much and I love you so much, I have to take you with me and I 
have to go.' " 
</P>
<P>
Berman told of a Baltimore man who shot his lover three times in the head, then 
bent over and kissed her before killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Allen, a Los Angeles counselor, found in a study of 104 murder-suicides 
that 71% of the murderers were husbands or boyfriends of the victims. In half 
of the cases, the couple had been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
Studies since 1976 link such violent and impulsive behavior to a decrease in 
the chemical called serotonin, which carries messages between brain cells. 
</P>
<P>
"Serotonin has been found to be the lowest in murder-suicides," said Dr. Susan 
J. Blumenthal, a psychiatrist and chief of the Behavioral Medicine Program at 
the National Institute of Mental Health in Rockville, Md. "It's also very low 
in arsonists who then kill themselves or attempt suicide." 
</P>
<P>
Some who commit murder-suicide fall victim to depression or psychosis, unable 
to distinguish reality from fantasy, hearing voices telling them to hurt 
themselves and others. They blame others, including family members or their 
work supervisors, for their failures and their hurt, often exaggerated in the 
exhaustion of the mind. 
</P>
<P>
"These are people . . . who feel helpless in the face of being victimized by 
someone else," said Dr. Ronald S. Ebert, senior forensic psychologist at McLean 
Hospital in Belmont, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Such was the case with Wesbecker, a 47-year-old pressman who was put on 
disability leave last year. A manic depressive, he had attempted suicide three 
times. Co-workers said he carried a grudge because he was laid off and feared 
his disability benefits were going to be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"You're dealing with a man who perceives a miscarriage of justice and he's 
going to correct it," said Dr. Martin Symonds, chairman of the American 
Psychiatric Assn.'s Task Force on Victimization. 
</P>
<P>
Many murderers then take their own lives because they despise what they did and 
cannot to live with themselves after killing someone, particularly someone 
close. 
</P>
<P>
The National Institute of Mental Health's Blumenthal said that in more than 90% 
of suicides there is some humiliating life event in the recent past. "There's a 
breakup in a relationship. They've lost a job. They've lost some financial 
status. They're about to be confronted by the law." 
</P>
<P>
No one knows for sure what was going through John Cotter's mind that fatal 
summer day on Woodside Circle. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody wishes they knew because you could say, 'Well, it happened 
because of this and we can put it behind us,' " said Longley-Cook, a mother of 
three. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's what's very frightening to children. They see this happy family 
across the street and then suddenly they hear the father murdered everyone and 
killed himself. That's pretty devastating for children. Every time I see the 
house, I just can't believe that's happened there."

THOUSANDS ALIVE, THANKS TO 'BOMB MAGICIAN'; 
</P>
<P>
LEBANON: YOUSSEF BITAR HAS SAVED A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE CIVIL WAR. HE HAS 
DEFUSED ENOUGH BOMBS 'TO BLOW UP NEW YORK CITY.'

<TEXT>
<P>
They call Warrant Officer Youssef Bitar, formerly of the French Foreign Legion, 
the "bomb magician." He calls himself a "bomb charmer." 
</P>
<P>
Either name fits, for he has defused more than 2,000 terrorist bombs in 
Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war, probably more than any other demolitions 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
Bitar, who also fought the Germans with Gen. Charles de Gaulle's Free French 
forces in World War II, has survived three assassination attempts by terrorists 
whose actions he has thwarted, been shot twice and blown up by a mine -- all 
for the equivalent of $200 a month and free gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
"If all the bombs he's defused had gone off, the death toll of the civil war 
would have more than doubled," said a police colonel, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. "Bitar is indispensable." 
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 people have been killed in the civil war, hundreds of them in 
car bombings. 
</P>
<P>
When car bombs explode before he can get to them, Bitar can usually tell after 
examining the blast scene how much explosive was used, sometimes even the type. 
</P>
<P>
Bitar, 61, has defused 300 car bombs outside hospitals, airline offices, 
newspaper buildings, embassies, government ministries, movie theaters, churches 
and mosques. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the others were time bombs planted in jetliners, supermarkets, banks, 
schools, universities and gasoline stations. 
</P>
<P>
Bitar estimates the total explosive weight of the bombs he had defused since 
1975 at more than 100 tons, "enough to blow up New York." 
</P>
<P>
Bitar is a Greek Catholic. But he defies Lebanon's Christian-Muslim sectarian 
barriers and regularly races across Beirut's dividing Green Line to the Muslim 
sector dodging shells and sniper fire to defuse bombs. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest bomb he has dismantled was in the Bir Hassan district of West 
Beirut in 1983. It contained 1,320 pounds of TNT with four Katyusha rockets 
attached to it, enough to pulverize a city block. 
</P>
<P>
Bitar said it was apparently planted by the Israelis before they withdrew from 
west Beirut after their 1982 invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"That was probably the worst disaster I've prevented," he said in an interview 
in his elegant penthouse apartment in the Sad el-Boushrieh district of 
Christian East Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
The stocky Bitar sat stroking his Siamese cat Rambo on his lap as he talked 
dispassionately about his spine-chilling exploits, gesticulating with hands 
missing three fingertips. 
</P>
<P>
He lost a fingertip on his right hand when he grabbed a detonator, taken from a 
bomb he had defused, that a police officer was playing with. It exploded in 
Bitar's hand. 
</P>
<P>
He lost two fingertips on his other hand in 1982 when he stepped on a mine 
after he had defused a bomb in a Palestinian guerrilla base in the mountains 
overlooking Beirut. He was also wounded in the chest and feet. 
</P>
<P>
"That cost me three months in hospital," Bitar said. 
</P>
<P>
Talking of his nerve-racking exploits seemed somehow incongruous amid the 
comfortable domesticity of Persian carpets, brass ornaments and exotic Oriental 
decor in his marble-floored lounge. 
</P>
<P>
Bitar joined the Foreign Legion as a teen-ager when Lebanon was still ruled by 
France and served with special forces and demolition teams in North Africa and 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"I was with De Gaulle's Free French forces in Algeria when I heard about the 
American atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima Aug. 6, 1945," he recalled. "It sort of 
kindled my interest in explosives." 
</P>
<P>
After joining the Lebanese army in 1946, Bitar became Lebanon's top explosives 
expert. But he really came into his own when the civil war erupted in 1975 and 
the car bombings started. 
</P>
<P>
"I operate with great faith in God," Bitar said. "But I rely mainly on 
intuition -- and a little bit of luck." 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell the kind of bomb I've got to tackle the moment I see it. I try to 
disconnect it as quickly as possible. I feel as if it's placed under the bed of 
one of my children," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I never panic. From the moment I see the bomb, I know what has to be done. 
</P>
<P>
"The bombs don't frighten me. But I'm always afraid of the people who planted 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Bitar said the first assassination attempt against him came as he was defusing 
a car bomb in the Barbir neighborhood of Muslim west Beirut on Sept. 19, 1975. 
</P>
<P>
"Two bullets hit my neck and chest, but I managed to finish dismantling the 
bomb before I collapsed. I stayed two months in a hospital that time." 
</P>
<P>
Gunmen shot at him and missed, three years later, as he was defusing a bomb 
near the entrance to a movie house in the Muslim sector. 
</P>
<P>
The third assassination attempt was in 1985 while he was visiting the Helou 
police station in west Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone tossed a hand grenade into the room," he said. "I threw myself to the 
floor to grab it and threw it out the window into the parking lot. No one was 
hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Bitar was retired from the army in 1980, but was immediately hired by the 
Defense Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think of quitting," he said. "When I look in the eyes of people when I 
arrive to tackle a bomb, I see their faith in me. I'll fight the bombers as 
long as I live."

CHILE WILL STUDY SAN FRANCISCO QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HARVEY, UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SANTIAGO, Chile 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists and engineers in Chile, which has the distinction of playing host to 
the largest earthquake ever measured, are waiting with serious interest reports 
on the Oct. 17 San Francisco earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Measured by magnitude, "Chile is the world's most seismic country," said 
building engineer Elias Arze, president of the Chilean Seismology and 
Anti-Seismic Engineering Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco quake measuring 7.1 was comparable to the earthquake that 
struck Santiago and central Chile in March, 1985, killing 180 people and 
toppling some 70,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
And like California, Chile is still waiting for another "big one," an 
earthquake of magnitude 8 or more. Both areas are situated along the Pacific 
"ring of fire," the huge faults created by the collision of massive plates of 
the earth's surface. 
</P>
<P>
"Chile, along with Alaska, are the sites that have had the biggest seismic 
occurrences," said Prof. Edgar Kausel, chairman of the Geophysics Department at 
the University of Chile. 
</P>
<P>
Chile has about 2,270 miles of its coast along the earthquake fault between the 
Nazca plate and the South American plate. The frequency of earth movements 
prompts Chileans to say that every president has at least one major earthquake 
during the traditional six-year term in office. 
</P>
<P>
The long history of earth movements in Chile has led to a sharing of 
information with U.S. and Japanese scientists and engineers over the behavior 
of the earth and of buildings during earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
Arze said after the 1985 earthquake, teams of foreign experts arrived in Chile 
to study the effects of the earthquake on buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"Our buildings performed very well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since earthquake building codes were implemented in Chile in the 1930s, only 
two engineered buildings have collapsed, he said. Older buildings have been 
replaced over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"We have so many earthquakes in Chile it has cleaned up our construction," Arze 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Chilean earthquakes tend to be sharper and last longer than those of 
California, leading to differences in building design. 
</P>
<P>
While California engineers have promoted a flexible design of steel framed 
buildings that allows them to swing in a quake, Chileans opt for stiffer 
construction. Chilean buildings are of reinforced concrete with more inside 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
"Our buildings move little compared to (those of) the Americans," said Arze. 
</P>
<P>
Descriptions of earthquakes in Chile date back to Spanish settlers in 1575. 
</P>
<P>
In an 1835 journal entry about a stop the ship the Beagle made in Chile, 
scientist Charles Darwin described an earthquake he experienced. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few months before the 1906 earthquake in San Francisco, a quake 
measuring 8.5 struck the central Chilean coast, destroying the city of 
Valparaiso. 
</P>
<P>
On May 21, 1960, an earthquake measuring 9.5 struck an area about 600 miles 
long in southern Chile, releasing energy nearly 1,000 times that of this year's 
San Francisco quake. Parts of the coast stretching south from the city of 
Concepcion, 325 miles south of Santiago, dropped nine feet. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the biggest registered in the history of seismic instrumention," said 
Kausel. 
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 people were killed in the sparsely populated area, most of them 
when the coastline dropped. A tsunami, a tidal wave created by the earthquake, 
killed others and caused considerable damage in Japan and Hawaii.

One group, Fundatropicos, claims that the shark fishermen are harpooning 
thousands of dolphins a year to hook small sharks used in a favorite Venezuelan 
delicacy called cazon. 
</P>
<P>
Some fishermen and government officials deny the charges, but the allegations 
have touched off a heated debate among environmentalists in Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
The result has been conflicting press reports, confusion over the number of 
dolphins killed, uncertainty about which fishermen might be responsible, a call 
for a boycott of shark meat and an open rivalry between two government 
ministries. 
</P>
<P>
"Between 6,000 and 7,000 dolphins per year are killed by shark fishermen using 
a system called trotline fishing," said Eduardo Szeplaki, a biologist who is 
spearheading a campaign by Fundatropicos. A trotline is a long fishing line 
with hundreds of baited hooks attached to it. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the Environment Ministry identified 12 fishing boats thought to be 
killing dolphins and the areas where the killings were taking place. 
</P>
<P>
According to Szeplaki, Venezuelan fishermen got the idea of using dolphins as 
shark bait from Asia. The dolphin meat is fibrous, lasts as long as three days 
and is regarded as effective in attracting sharks. 
</P>
<P>
Killing dolphins, while prohibited by Venezuelan law, also enables fishermen to 
avoid having to buy bait. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Novoa, director of the fishing section at the Venezuelan Agriculture 
Ministry, described Fundatropicos' accusations as "completely without 
foundation." 
</P>
<P>
He says nine South Korean boats operating in Venezuelan waters may have killed 
dolphins but departed more than a year and a half ago. According to Novoa, 
Venezuela now has only four trotline shark boats, despite Fundatropicos' claim 
of 17. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging the possibility of "isolated cases" of dolphin killings, 
Novoa said captains of shark boats deny it. 
</P>
<P>
Salvador Bohir, director of an Environment Ministry animal protection agency, 
disagreed with Novoa. 
</P>
<P>
"I am far more realistic," he said. "Yes, there are irregularities." 
</P>
<P>
In Venezuela, the Agriculture Ministry is charged with marketing and developing 
ocean resources, while the Environment Ministry oversees their protection and 
conservation. 
</P>
<P>
"At times the marketing part takes precedence over protection," said Jose 
Gregoria Garcia, an engineer at the Environment Ministry. "There must be 
greater communication and teamwork." 
</P>
<P>
Dolphins are protected by international accords in the Pacific, where dolphins 
and tuna swim together -- and dolphins sometimes suffocate in tuna fishermen's 
nets. Venezuela, which sends tuna fleets into the Pacific, met the terms of 
those accords last year after a 38-day tuna embargo by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But no such accords apply to the Caribbean, which makes up Venezuela's 
shoreline, and the shark fishermen, who are just 1% of the nation's fishing 
fleet. 
</P>
<P>
Szeplaki maintains that nearly half of all species of dolphin can be found in 
Venezuelan waters and that some species might be in danger of extinction. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the accusations of dolphin killings in the press and official circles, 
only one trotline shark boat has been cited so far.

Ten girls arrested for allegedly jabbing 39 women in a series of attacks on the 
streets of Manhattan's Upper West Side told police the unprovoked strikes were 
staged "for fun." The girls, all black high school students aged 13 to 15, face 
charges of juvenile delinquency. Most of the victims were white women between 
the ages of 14 and 55, police said. Some victims had expressed concern that the 
weapons used in the attacks were hypodermic needles contaminated with the AIDS 
virus. But officials said the suspects told police they had pricked the women 
with ordinary pins.

CORNEAS FROM SRI LANKA'S DEAD ENABLE 25,000 TO SEE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A blind man from Japan flew to Sri Lanka recently and saw a young woman through 
the eyes of her dead grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
Horikoshi Masao, 60, a technician in a Japanese automobile factory, is one of 
25,000 people in different parts of the world whose sight has been restored by 
corneal grafting with eyes from Sri Lanka. 
</P>
<P>
Masao, a grandfather, came to the Indian Ocean island to participate in 
celebrations organized by the Sri Lanka Eye Donation Society to mark the giving 
of the 25,000th eye. 
</P>
<P>
The society's president, Dr. Hudson Silva, said Sri Lanka is the only country 
in the world giving to other countries corneas of dead people to be grafted 
onto the eyes of the blind. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Given to 57 Countries 
</P>
<P>
Silva, who started the humanitarian scheme, said the eyes have been given to 57 
countries over the last 25 years. "Our eyes have gone to so many countries to 
illuminate the world," the eye surgeon said. 
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa was the chief guest at the 
celebrations to mark the event. 
</P>
<P>
Premadasa said that at Silva's request he had carried eyes to several countries 
on his official tours as prime minister before he became president early this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"I have taken eyes to various countries, and I know how much the people in 
those countries appreciate it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Masao's defective eyes had been grafted three years ago with the corneas of a 
65-year-old Sri Lankan woman named Aslin Nona three days after she died. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Went to See Her Family 
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the island, Masao drove to Aslin Nona's home at 
Heriyantuduwe in the suburbs of Colombo to see her family. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy to see you, I have always wanted to see all of you with these 
eyes," he told Aslin Nona's children and grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Her granddaughter, Karunaseeli, 23, showed Masao pictures of Aslin Nona in the 
family album. "I am very happy to see her," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like as if our grandmother has returned home," said Tillekeratne, one 
of Aslin Nona's grandsons. 
</P>
<P>
The Eye Donation Society formed by Silva started donating eyes to local 
hospitals for grafting in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
"Before we started this scheme, the eyes were obtained from people sent to the 
gallows. But, when in 1956 the government stopped executions, the flow of eyes 
to the hospitals dried up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Three years after the society started collecting corneas of dead people, there 
was an excess over the number required by the local hospitals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We then started donating the excess eyes to foreign countries. The first batch 
of six eyes was sent to Singapore on the full-moon day of the month of May, 
1964." Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
He said giving the eyes on full-moon day was significant because the day is 
sacred to Buddhists, who form 70% of Sri Lanka's 16 million people. 
</P>
<P>
The Eye Donation Society has a list of more than 550,000 people, mostly 
Buddhists, who have signed forms offering their corneas for grafting after 
death.

AFTER 50 YEARS, R.I. OYSTERS MAY BE MAKING A COMEBACK 
</P>

<P>
Rhode Island oysters -- as famous as Maine lobsters until pollution and 
overfishing wiped them out during World War II -- may be making a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers are tiny as yet, but shellfish dealers report buying occasional 
batches of oysters from fishermen who normally harvest quahogs, or hard-shell 
clams. 
</P>
<P>
"There are quite a bit of oysters around," said Mark Boucher, manager of Top 
Quality Shellfish in Bristol. "Two, three years ago, you wouldn't see anybody 
digging them." 
</P>
<P>
But some Rhode Island oyster beds remain off limits because of pollution. 
</P>
<P>
"The largest oyster population is in the Pawcatuck River, which has been closed 
(to shellfishing) for years," said Arthur Ganz, senior marine biologist with 
the state Department of Environmental Management. 
</P>
<P>
To assess the extent of the comeback, the Narragansett Bay Project next month 
will start an 18-month study to pinpoint the bay's oyster beds. 
</P>
<P>
"The speculation now is that they are remnants of the cultivated oyster 
industry that was flourishing here in 1900 to 1940," said Caroline Karp, the 
project's director. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Rice, assistant professor of fisheries at the University of Rhode 
Island, said the drop in metal pollution in the upper bay in the last few years 
might be one explanation for the oyster revival. Adult oysters can live in 
extremely polluted waters, but metal contamination can be fatal to oyster 
larvae. 
</P>
<P>
Metal pollution at the Narragansett Bay Commission's sewage treatment plant in 
Providence dropped from 954,000 pounds per year in 1981 to 180,500 pounds per 
year in 1988, said Chip Young, spokesman for the environmental group Save the 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Parts of the bay that are distant from the plant are open to shellfishing. 
</P>
<P>
The oyster industry flourished in Narragansett Bay in the early part of the 
century. Because oysters spawn best in comparatively fresh water but grow best 
in saltier water, the baby bivalves were imported into the bay. 
</P>
<P>
"The oysters were dredged from coves in Connecticut, schoonered over to 
Narragansett Bay and left to grow until they were big and fat and succulent," 
Ganz said. 
</P>
<P>
"The old discarded shells would be shoveled back on the schooners, sent back to 
Connecticut and used as cultch," the ragged surface that young oysters need to 
attach themselves to in order to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Rhode Island oysters in those days were known as the best in the country, 
smaller but less salty than those raised in the Chesapeake Bay, Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a mystique about them, something like the Maine lobsters," Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
Increasing pollution and the destruction of reefs by silt and over-use of 
oyster tongs wiped out the oysters around World War II, and many shellfishermen 
turned to quahogs that recently have become a Rhode Island state symbol, Rice 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, a shortage of quahogs may be helping fuel the renewed interest in 
oystering, Boucher said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are digging them now more so because of the shortage of littlenecks," he 
said. "The upper bay isn't open as much anymore (to quahogging), so they're 
looking for any other way to make a dollar." 
</P>
<P>
Oysters bring anywhere from 70 cents to $1.20 a pound at Rhode Island docks, 
about the same price as steamer clams but less than the prized littlenecks, the 
smallest and most tender of the quahogs.

BUSH TO BACK CONGRESSIONAL PAY RAISES

The White House said Friday that President Bush will support a new attempt on 
Capitol Hill to get a pay raise for members of Congress, federal officials and 
judges. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just waiting for them to give us a package," press secretary Marlin 
Fitzwater said. "We'll be supportive if the Congress produces any reasonable 
proposal." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said Bush would like to see any pay raise tied to a package of 
ethical standards that would prohibit lawmakers from accepting honorariums -- 
fees for speeches, public appearances and writing. 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and Minority Leader Robert H. Michel 
(R-Ill.) met with Bush last week to discuss pay raises, Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Foley and Michel both back a pay-raise proposal, made by a bipartisan task 
force, that would phase in a 35% salary boost over two years, according to 
congressional aides. The plan also would include changes in Congress' ethics 
rules, including new restrictions on members' speaking honorariums. 
</P>
<P>
A Democratic leadership aide said Friday that "no final decision has been made" 
on moving a pay raise this year, but the meeting with Bush was sought because 
"presidential support would be essential" if lawmakers go ahead with a salary 
plan.

COURAGEOUS VIETNAM VETERAN TO RECEIVE HIS FINAL TRIBUTE

On Veterans' Day, more than 20 years after an enemy mortar shell blew away most 
of his body below the waist, Freddie Paul Heugel rejoins his comrades who 
sacrificed their lives in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
The name of Heugel, who died in 1984 of complications from his war wounds, has 
been inscribed on the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial in Washington. It will be 
dedicated at a Nov. 11 ceremony with the names of 19 other servicemen recently 
added to the black granite wall, which carries the names of more than 58,000 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
His mother, Maggie Heugel of Taylor, Mich., will be there. 
</P>
<P>
"He would be very proud," she said in a telephone interview from her home. A 
soft-spoken woman who works the night shift making salads for airline dinners, 
she still finds it hard to discuss her son without crying. 
</P>
<P>
Truman A. Strong might not be able to attend the ceremony, but the event will 
be special nonetheless for the Livonia, Mich., dentist. Strong launched the 
campaign to have Heugel's name inscribed on the memorial and enlisted the help 
of Rep. William Ford (D-Mich.), who interceded with the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the nicest kid I've ever seen . . . very easygoing," Strong said. "He 
deserves to be on that memorial as much as anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Heugel's story begins in 1968 when he was 19 and working at a Dearborn Heights, 
Mich., service station when the draft notice came. 
</P>
<P>
By Feb. 23, 1969 -- the day his life changed forever -- he was Cpl. Heugel, 
assistant gunner on a 105 millimeter howitzer. 
</P>
<P>
As he manned his weapon in a bunker two miles from the Ho Chi Minh Trail, a 
mortar shell exploded nearby, wounding a buddy. Heugel ran to summon a medic. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I got it too," Heugel said in a 1974 interview with the Detroit News. "I 
remember getting hit and smelling the gunpowder and then falling over backward. 
Then there was a medic leaning over me saying, 'Oh, my God. Oh, my God.' " 
</P>
<P>
He was evacuated to Japan, where doctors rated his survival chances as 
practically nil. Telegrams were sent to Michigan urging his family to hurry to 
his bedside. 
</P>
<P>
One physician, however, suggested a risky operation that would involve further 
amputations and removal of 80% of Heugel's spine. It would mean he would never 
even sit up again, but he might live. 
</P>
<P>
Heugel resisted. 
</P>
<P>
Ford's office helped Heugel's mother catch a flight to Tokyo, where she 
persuaded her son to undergo the surgery. He spent four years convalescing in 
hospitals, repeatedly confounding predictions that he would die within months. 
</P>
<P>
With sheer grit and help from friends, he managed to lead a productive life 
despite being permanently confined to a prone position on a hospital gurney. 
</P>
<P>
Heugel taught himself to drive a specially equipped van, controlling the 
brakes, gears and accelerator with a single lever. He and his mother drove to 
the 1982 World's Fair in Knoxville, Tenn., and to Disney World in Orlando, Fla. 
A Veterans of Foreign Wars post raised money for an elevator and recreation 
room in Heugel's home. He read, played pool and poker, and took up photography. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a great time together," his mother said. "Everybody that knew him loved 
him. He cheered up people who came to see him." 
</P>
<P>
He also became a volunteer in Ford's congressional campaigns, driving workers 
around the district and making telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
"I have an annual family birthday picnic, and he'd come," Ford said. "People 
would marvel at how he'd drive up in his van, wheel himself out on his gurney. 
. . . His courage was remarkable. I never heard a bitter word out of him, that 
he had gotten a raw deal, that anybody owed him anything." 
</P>
<P>
But life was difficult. Heugel required heavy doses of painkillers and he was 
constantly returning to the local veterans' hospital for dialysis and other 
treatment. He developed cirrhosis of the liver from a blood transfusion, and 
toward the end his heart deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
No one disputed Heugel's fitness for a spot on the Vietnam memorial when his 
name was submitted in 1987. But because of the strict qualification standards 
and red tape, it took a year to win the Pentagon's approval. 
</P>
<P>
For Maggie Heugel, the passage of time has made it no easier to understand the 
war and her son's fate. "I don't even watch the war movies on TV. I can't," she 
said. "I don't know why it had to happen. Before my son went to Vietnam . . . 
he never said nothing like 'I don't want to go,' but he just said, 'Mom, why do 
we have to go and fight people we don't even know?' " 
</P>
<P>
Heugel died May 12, 1984, at age 35.

SENATE IMPEACHES JUDGE NIXON ON PERJURY CONVICTION

<P>
The Senate Friday removed U.S. District Judge Walter L. Nixon of Mississippi 
from the bench on impeachment charges stemming from a perjury conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon was the second judge in two weeks removed from office through 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
With Nixon watching from his seat on the Senate floor, lawmakers sealed his 
fate by voting 89 to 8 to convict him on the first of three articles of 
impeachment. Senators quickly followed by approving a second charge, 78 to 19, 
but acquitted him on a third. The vote on that was 57 to 40, less than the 
necessary two-thirds of those voting. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney David Stewart put his arm around Nixon as the secretary of the 
Senate read the names of senators voting guilty. The judge closed his eyes as 
the list grew longer and longer. 
</P>
<P>
The 61-year-old Nixon was convicted of perjury in 1986 for lying to a grand 
jury about his unofficial talk with a prosecutor in a marijuana-smuggling case. 
He served more than a year in prison and in recent weeks was moved to a New 
Orleans halfway house. 
</P>
<P>
He has been collecting his $89,500 annual salary and saying he would like to 
return to the bench to preside over trials. 
</P>
<P>
"We fought the fight for 5 1/2 years because we know we are not guilty of 
anything and we don't feel like it," Nixon told reporters outside the Capitol 
after the vote as he held hands with his wife, Barbara, and his daughter, 
Courtney. 
</P>
<P>
"We can hold our heads high because we are innocent . . . We have to go home 
and talk about things and get on with our lives," he said.

MERCHANTS PAY DEARLY FOR BRIDGE, ROAD REPAIRS; 
</P>
<P>
ORANGE COUNTY: BUSINESS OWNERS SAY CUSTOMERS ARE BEING DRIVEN AWAY. OFFICIALS 
COUNTER THAT THE RESULT WILL BE WORTH THE INCONVENIENCE.

Until August, Abbas Sarlak had run a fairly profitable gasoline station here on 
the busy corner of Valencia Mesa Drive and Sunny Crest Drive in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Then the city closed the Valencia Mesa Drive bridge that feeds traffic into his 
station, and his business foundered. 
</P>
<P>
With the bridge expected to remain closed during a five-month reconstruction, 
Sarlak, 53, has sent a letter to the city complaining that his revenues are off 
as much as 45% and that he has had to get loans to stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts. . . . I might go into bankruptcy," Sarlak said recently. 
</P>
<P>
Sarlak's predicament is an increasingly common one in northern Orange County, 
where an aging infrastructure has necessitated many road and bridge 
improvements such as the bridge in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Small-business owners, dependent upon a steady flow of traffic, have besieged 
officials of some cities in the northern part of the county with complaints 
about losing customers because of construction-caused traffic delays. 
</P>
<P>
And with a slew of streets scheduled to be torn up soon for more projects in 
Fullerton, Placentia, Yorba Linda and Villa Park, officials warn that such 
disruptions will continue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of an inconvenience for a period of time, but hopefully the 
long-term results (in better streets and bridges) will pay off," said John 
Schiller, general manager of Steve Bubalo Construction in Monrovia, a firm that 
handles many road construction and repair jobs in north and central Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crews Work Quickly 
</P>
<P>
In most of these projects, city officials said, crews work so quickly that 
disruptions are minimal. But they acknowledged that longer projects, such as 
the bridge job in Fullerton, have created major problems for some businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Another of the more disruptive projects in north Orange County is occurring 
along a two-mile stretch of Euclid Street in Anaheim, where the city is 
resurfacing the pavement and installing a new storm drain while the county adds 
new sewer pipes. 
</P>
<P>
The $10-million project, between Katella Avenue and Broadway, began in 
September, 1988, and is expected to be completed on schedule this month. 
</P>
<P>
In August, angered over the trenches that have blocked entrances to some 
shopping centers and forced commuter traffic down to a single lane at times, 
about 200 merchants along the street banded together to battle the city. 
</P>
<P>
Anger directed at the city over the traffic disruption prompted the new Euclid 
Street Merchants' Assn. to retain an attorney for a possible damage suit 
against the city. The merchants are also circulating a petition to ask Gov. 
George Deukmejian to declare Euclid Street a disaster area, making small 
businesses there eligible for low-interest loans. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a big, big mess," said Billy Mitchell, organizer of the Euclid 
Street Merchants Assn. and owner of Billy Mitchell's Restaurant, where he said 
revenues have plunged as much as 70% in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
"They're taking us to the poorhouse a little at a time," he said. "We are all 
suffering because we are losing everything we have." 
</P>
<P>
Other merchants report business losses ranging from 10% to 60%. Especially hard 
hit has been the Ball Euclid Plaza shopping center at the corner of Euclid and 
Ball Road, where Mitchell's restaurant is located. Four small businesses in 
that shopping center have shut down for lack of customers, and many others are 
struggling, merchants there said. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had not had my regular customers, I would not have made it," said Larry 
Esmino, a longtime hairdresser in the center. 
</P>
<P>
Rufino's Pizza in the shopping center used to enjoy a brisk lunchtime trade. 
Since the construction project started, however, Rufino's owner, Rufino 
Chammas, said his lunch business has been virtually nil. 
</P>
<P>
"With the construction, nobody has time to come here and eat lunch," Chammas 
said in his nearly empty restaurant one recent afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
And at Spire's Restaurant, on the corner of Ball and Euclid, Assistant Manager 
Donna Newton said a 40% drop in business has forced her to put her 42 full-time 
employees on part-time status. 
</P>
<P>
"The dinner (rush) used to start at 3 o'clock," Newton said, as road crews 
jackhammered the street out front. "We're lucky now to have (a) dinner (rush) 
at 6 or 6:30." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Blamed 
</P>
<P>
The merchants, along with many customers, blame the city for dragging its feet 
on the project. They said they were told it would take just six months. But 
city officials insist that everyone in the area was told in advance it would 
take 13 months. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been going on for too long," said Jean Muller, 68, an Anaheim resident 
who was among a handful of customers dining at Spire's recently. "If we had 
rain, like the Midwest, I could see the delays. But this is California." 
</P>
<P>
Not all the merchants are in agreement that the city is at fault. Although his 
B&amp;L Liquor Drive-In has lost as much as 60% of its business, Robert Gordon 
said the road crews have been hard at work every day and have let him know all 
along when they would be blocking off certain parts of the street and for how 
long. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not holding anyone accountable for it," Gordon said. "It's just bad luck." 
</P>
<P>
Gordon added that Euclid Street's retail business had been declining anyway and 
that the road construction has weeded out some of the weaker stores. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impossible to Avoid 
</P>
<P>
Dave Nelson, city field engineer in charge of the project, said he sympathized 
with the plight of the Euclid Street merchants. But he said there was just no 
getting around the traffic disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
"We're rebuilding the whole street (because) a good portion of Euclid is just a 
shot street. The asphalt has served its design life. It's time to upgrade and 
replace it." 
</P>
<P>
The road reconstruction was authorized under a 1982 city bond issue. The Orange 
County Sanitation Districts also decided to replace an outdated sewer line 
while the work was under way. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said it is actually a benefit to the public that the agencies are 
working jointly on the project: "Yeah, we tore the street up for 13 months. But 
instead of tearing it up for five or six months now and nine months to a year 
later with the sewer project, we've got double forces working." 
</P>
<P>
In Fullerton, where gas station owner Sarlak estimated that he is losing nearly 
$4,000 a month because of the bridge reconstruction, city officials said they 
had to rebuild the bridge because it was built in the early 1920s and is 
dangerously narrow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Do-Nothing Option 
</P>
<P>
Don Hoppe, a city senior civil engineer in charge of that project, said making 
no road improvements would hurt small businesses even more in the long run: "If 
the street is never repaired, it will become so bad that people won't drive it 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
But that is no consolation to Sarlak. He sent a letter to the Fullerton City 
Council in September, seeking financial relief to compensate for his losses. 
The council is considering the request and sent a city employee to Sarlak's 
business recently to examine his receipts. 
</P>
<P>
Without the compensation, Sarlak, a husband and father of four who has operated 
A&amp;M's Service for six years, said he is worried that his business will 
fail. 
</P>
<P>
"At this rate," Sarlak wrote in his letter to the council, "I would expect to 
have severe financial difficulties resulting in (the) loss of my business, 
which will cause significant hardship on my family and loss of (my) home."

CITY SEEKS TO SAY A HOUSE IS NOT A DORM; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: CITY ATTY. JOHN WITT'S OFFICE IS PREPARING A MEASURE THAT WOULD ALLOW 
THE CITY TO DECIDE WHAT CONSTITUTES A SAN DIEGO FAMILY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Frustrated with ineffectual attempts to control college students who turn 
single-family homes into "mini-dorms," City Atty. John Witt's office is 
preparing a more drastic measure that would allow the city to decide what 
constitutes a San Diego family. 
</P>
<P>
Witt's office has drafted an ordinance that would divide single-family home 
dwellers into "traditional" and "non-traditional" families, imposing parking 
restrictions on groups of adults not joined by blood, marriage or adoption. 
</P>
<P>
The city's community planning groups have endorsed a separate proposal that 
achieves much the same purpose and are preparing to forward that proposal to 
City Hall. Both proposals are expected to go before a San Diego City Council 
committee Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Either measure, if passed by the San Diego City Council, is expected to spark a 
court battle because the restriction on the rights of non-traditional families 
flouts a 1980 state Supreme Court decision that specifically prohibits cities 
from attempting to limit the number of unrelated adults who may live together. 
</P>
<P>
But that is part of the plan. With the dramatic change in the composition of 
the Supreme Court in the past nine years, the thinking at City Hall, and among 
some community group leaders, is that now may be an opportune time to directly 
challenge the court's ruling in "City of Santa Barbara vs. Beverly Adamson." 
</P>
<P>
"Only (Justice Stanley) Mosk is left from the court that wrote that decision. 
All the rest are (Gov. George) Deukmejian's appointees," said Chief Deputy City 
Atty. Fred Conrad, who drafted the proposed city ordinance. "In an effort to 
protect our sacred single-family zones, we would at least like to hope that the 
court's inclination has changed." 
</P>
<P>
The city proposal already has drawn opposition from building industry 
representatives who worry that it might prevent groups of unrelated people from 
buying homes together and from others who believe it is simply unfair. Even 
among residents of neighborhoods plagued by the noise, parking problems and 
declining property values caused by the proliferation of homes jammed with 
college students, there is some hesitancy to back Conrad's solution. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't live in an 'Ozzie and Harriet' society any more and, particularly in 
San Diego, with the cost of housing being a critical issue, we have to create 
definitions that allow non-traditional families" in single-family homes, said 
Doug Case, chairman of the College Area Community Council, the planning group 
for the San Diego State University neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"If the issue is density, if the issue is parking, it should not make any 
difference what the nature of the relationship between the people in the house 
is," he added. 
</P>
<P>
But others, who have lived through a decade of hard-partying students in their 
formerly quiet, traffic-free, single-family neighborhoods, are ready to address 
the problems with drastic measures. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have now does not work," said Barbara Greene, another College Area 
Community Council member, of the city ordinances and programs aimed at 
mini-dorm problems. "The mini-dorms are escalating. The problems in this area 
are so bad. Property values are going down." 
</P>
<P>
Born of the enrollment boom at SDSU, the mini-dorm controversy is primarily a 
clash of cultures between exuberant college students and aging single-family 
homeowners who for decades have populated the neighborhoods near the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
As on-campus housing grew scarce in the early 1980s, and the residential 
population around SDSU began retiring, more of the single-family homes put up 
for sale were purchased by investors, many of whom rented the homes to groups 
of college students. Today, there are about 500 rental properties in the 
college area planning zone, Case said. 
</P>
<P>
With the students came more cars than driveways could handle, and on-street 
parking became more difficult to find. Some students simply began parking in 
front yards. 
</P>
<P>
Loud parties became more common, and absentee investors did not keep up some of 
the properties they rented out. The students, who often lived in a home for a 
year or less, were not responsible for maintenance either. 
</P>
<P>
The problems, victims note, are not restricted to the SDSU neighborhood. In Del 
Mar Terrace, residents complain that low-cost "Go Homes," five or six 
one-person suites clustered around a single kitchen in one building, have 
caused some of the same parking and nuisance problems. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't what you expected to have when you bought into a single-family 
neighborhood," said Opal Trueblood, chairman of the Torrey Pines Community 
Planning Group. 
</P>
<P>
The city has responded with a battery of ordinances and programs, none of them 
effective. In July, 1988, the Single Family Rental Overlay Zone ordinance went 
into effect in the College, Del Cerro, Rolando, Navajo, Grantville, Allied 
Gardens and San Carlos communities. The ordinance, which applies only to rental 
housing, limits the number of people who may occupy a residence based on the 
number of bedrooms, bathrooms and off-street parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
But enforcement of the rules is time-consuming and cumbersome, with a maximum 
$1,000 fine allowable only after a court hearing. Overburdened city code 
enforcement officers must take complaints, then determine the number of people 
living in a home before enforcement proceedings can begin. 
</P>
<P>
In 16 months, the city has corrected about half a dozen problem homes, said 
Joseph Schilling, deputy city attorney in charge of code enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
"They make so many trips out there . . . and then the semester changes, and the 
kids move out," said Councilwoman Judy McCarty, whose 7th District includes the 
College area. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole issue is how do you prove, from a legal standpoint, who is living at 
a certain residence," Schilling added. "Whether it's under SFROZ or this new 
definition of family, you're going to need a zoning inspector to go out and 
determine who lives there, and you can't." 
</P>
<P>
The city followed the zoning ordinance with a civil penalties ordinance 
allowing daily fines of $2,500 for flagrant violators; a "second response 
ordinance" that establishes fines of as much as $500 against party hosts if 
police must respond a second time to complaints of an unruly party; a good 
neighbor program; a one-warning policy for loud parties that gives police the 
right to shut down parties during the following year based on a single 
complaint by a neighbor; and a boom box confiscation ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, the city has been hamstrung by the "Adamson" case, a Rose Bird-era 
court decision that overturned a Santa Barbara court's injunction prohibiting 
12 unrelated people from living together because of a city ordinance that 
defined "family" as two or more people related by blood, marriage or legal 
adoption. 
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that cities cannot impose arbitrary numbers in family 
definitions, stating that such ordinances discriminate against "alternate 
families." 
</P>
<P>
"Population density can be regulated by reference to floor space and 
facilities," the majority wrote. "Noise and morality can be dealt with by 
enforcement of police power ordinances and criminal statutes. Traffic and 
parking can be handled by limitations on the number of cars (applied evenly to 
all households) and by off-street parking requirements." 
</P>
<P>
This year, the swelling number of complaints about mini-dorms led to a series 
of hearings before the Planning Commission and other city officials, followed 
by the demand that Witt's office develop a legal solution. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad's simple ordinance change creates two family classifications for single 
family homes. A traditional family would be two or more people related by 
blood, marriage or adoption, as well as anyone placed in the home by a court or 
under legal guardianship. Foster homes with fewer than six children would 
qualify. 
</P>
<P>
Non-traditional families would be two or more people who do not qualify under 
those rules. 
</P>
<P>
Non-traditional families would be subject to a new parking regulation requiring 
an off-street parking space for each adult over 18 beginning Jan. 1, 1990. 
Homes occupied by more than one traditional family would be subject to the same 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Conrad admits that the ordinance sets up non-uniform standards for traditional 
and non-traditional families, but claims that it is legal and responds to a 
longstanding, valid complaint of single-family homeowners. He acknowledges 
that, for example, a traditional family with four teen-age drivers who own 
their own cars would not be subject to the same rules as three unrelated 
drivers living in the same home. 
</P>
<P>
"We need relief of some kind from a pattern of conduct and living that is 
typically that of our college students," he said. "That goes back to lack of 
parental supervision (in the mini-dorms), any father figure or mother figure 
who keeps the conduct within the bounds of propriety." 
</P>
<P>
Conrad is equally certain the regulations will be tested if they are passed by 
the City Council. "It would be naive to think somebody won't," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Community Planners Committee, a citywide advisory body composed of the 
chairmen of the city's 31 community planning groups, has a different 
suggestion. The panel last month approved a resolution asking the city simply 
to enforce an ordinance still on the books that prohibits more than three 
unrelated people from living together in a single-family home in neighborhoods 
zoned for single-family use. Non-traditional living arrangements would be 
allowable in other zones. 
</P>
<P>
"What we endorsed was the idea of the city going back to the original 
definition that was in 'Santa Barbara' and carrying that through to the state 
Supreme Court again," said Trueblood, chairman of the Torrey Pines Community 
Planning Group. 
</P>
<P>
McCarty is also considering a suggestion to license rental housing like 
businesses, forcing investors to conform to parking, noise and landscaping 
regulations and face loss of the license if they do not continue to comply. But 
McCarty said she would support the new family definitions if they can be 
legally enforced. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to do something," she said. "I think (the ordinance) has 
possibilities, but we've got to make sure we are within the spirit of the 
Constitution. That means the Constitution, not Rose Bird's interpretation of 
the Constitution."

WHO'S IN CHARGE WHEN PARENTS AREN'T? SCHOOLS, FOR SOME; 
</P>
<P>
CHILD CARE: SOME DISTRICT SCHOOLS ARE FILLING THE GAP FOR WORKING PARENTS, BUT 
SAN DIEGO UNIFIED IS WRESTLING WITH PROVIDING MORE THAN HAPHAZARD SERVICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
In Vista, parents on their daily commute to work in Orange County or downtown 
San Diego can drop children at one of 11 child-care centers run by the public 
school district, instead of facing the prospect of leaving them unattended at 6 
a.m. on a playground. 
</P>
<P>
The Poway district runs 13 before- and after-school programs -- all with long 
waiting lists -- not only during school sessions but during holiday and summer 
breaks as well, and principals in almost all cases have worked to make space 
available despite crowded classrooms at many sites. 
</P>
<P>
In small districts from Solana Beach to Imperial Beach, from Escondido to El 
Cajon, school trustees and administrators have bitten the bullet on educational 
child care, realizing that too many children are going without a safe, 
supervised environment, often with severe consequences for their social and 
academic futures. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, these districts offer widespread, fee-for-service care for the 
growing legions of middle-class parents whose working lives have put the final 
nail in the coffin of society's myth of a happy housewife waiting for the kids 
to come home. 
</P>
<P>
In stark contrast, the San Diego Unified School District, the nation's 
eighth-largest urban system with a growing elementary-age student population, 
sits almost alone among its smaller neighbors with no comprehensive child-care 
despite clear evidence that many parents within its boundaries are anxious for 
school-based programs. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Solana Beach district points with pride to its special Child 
Development Center for children from 6 weeks of age through the sixth grade. 
The center serves children, on a first-come basis, even if they do not live 
within the Solana Beach school boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, private San Diego child-care operators have run into continuing 
bureaucratic red tape trying to put a couple of bungalows proposed at two of 
the city's 107 elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
At Jerabek Elementary in Scripps Ranch, a proposed program by a private 
provider has been stalled for almost a year because of conflicts over whether a 
classroom trailer for the child care, if placed on the playground, will 
encroach slightly on the foul lines of a softball diamond leased to the city 
Park and Recreation Department. The conflict also involves differing opinions 
by members of the neighborhood's Community Planning Group over additional cars 
that might use streets because of child care. 
</P>
<P>
"For an urban system, we haven't been in the forefront of districts trying to 
facilitate child-care programs," San Diego city schools trustee Kay Davis 
conceded. Davis is pushing administrators and fellow trustees to get more 
involved in the issue. She sponsored a workshop for the board in late September 
to hear about the district's few successes and a host of horror stories about 
unsuccessful efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Davis served on a city committee earlier this year that looked into ways to 
encourage businesses to work with schools in providing child care. 
</P>
<P>
"A strong policy statement (by the board) supporting child care" would make it 
clearer to school administrators that they should encourage activities at their 
sites, said David Poole, a Pardee Construction Corp. executive whose company 
has been among five developers trying to set up child-care centers at several 
Mira Mesa and Scripps Ranch elementary schools. Parents prefer school-based 
programs, child-care advocates say, in large part for safety reasons, since 
children do not have to be bused. 
</P>
<P>
Why have other county districts moved so much faster than San Diego Unified in 
addressing part of the countywide need for child care? -- especially with 
estimates from the nonprofit Childcare Resource Service that as many as 80,000 
San Diego children up to age 14 could benefit from some type of adult care? 
</P>
<P>
"Partly it is due to the smaller size of the outlying districts and partly it 
is due to a greater level of commitment on the part of people," said Sylvia 
Selverston, child-care coordinator for the private nonprofit Social Advocates 
for Youth (SAY), who has persuaded a dozen San Diego principals to rent her 
space for child care. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Brunkow, director of Childcare Resource Service, said, "Like everything 
else, you have to have somebody who wants to make it happen, to make a real 
commitment" to bring parents, teachers and principals together. 
</P>
<P>
Brunkow's counterpart in North County, Paula Leard, said that "teachers often 
are territorial, they don't want to give up their classrooms after school for 
someone else, since they consider it disruptive . . . the success of a program 
depends on where a district's priorities lie." 
</P>
<P>
Given the large size of the San Diego district and the lack of attention that 
trustees have paid to child care, decisions whether to offer the service have 
been left up to individual principals. Their approval is key when they are 
approached by private providers to consider lending a classroom or authorizing 
a special trailer. Even when there is agreement at the school, delays can 
result because of liability or building code questions. 
</P>
<P>
Although not discounting the unmet needs, San Diego administrators say that too 
many of their schools are crowded and that they cannot afford to give up a 
classroom or auditorium for child care. Programs at these crowded schools would 
require portable classrooms -- a more expensive proposition -- and only if 
adequate playground space is available. Also, they say that fee-for-service 
child care would mean that some families unable to afford $35 or so a week 
would be left out. 
</P>
<P>
(The San Diego system, using state funds, does operate 27 child development 
centers for 2,128 low-income preschool and school-age children, under a program 
begun in 1942 by the federal government when World War II forced large numbers 
of women into the work force. Those centers provide before- and after-school 
care. It also offers a handful of child-care programs at certain magnet schools 
as a carrot to white parents who agree to voluntarily bus their children to the 
predominantly minority magnet schools.) 
</P>
<P>
But Brunkow and several North County child-care providers said that problems of 
space, janitorial service and parking all can be worked out if those involved 
recognize research that shows child care can boost a child's chances for 
academic and social success. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Van Zant, Poway elementary principal and one of 12 California Educators 
of the Year for 1990, began her district's efforts nine years ago at Garden 
Road School. At that time, many parents would ask about child care each time 
they visited the school, since there were -- and still are -- too few private 
providers in the county to meet demand. 
</P>
<P>
Van Zant found a spare room at the school and piloted the first program. 
</P>
<P>
Now Poway has more than 1,100 children in child care out of about 9,000 
eligible from kindergarten through fifth grade. Parents pay all fees, which are 
$275 a month for the first child and $140 a month for the second. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a time when they do homework, when they play, when they have a snack, 
in essence doing things that are appropriate for kids, so that's why we call it 
extended learning and not just child care, because we are not baby-sitting," 
Van Zant said. 
</P>
<P>
Although some Poway schools use multipurpose rooms, at others there are 
trailers on the playground. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all paid out of fees," said Leslie Fausset, the Poway program 
coordinator. "A portion of the fees offset business costs, pay rent to the 
district and pay for additional custodial services. We just haven't had a lot 
of logistical problems, since I think that our principals, given the (board of 
education) interest, understand that day care is a critical, critical need. 
</P>
<P>
"The program began as a voluntary program, but when other principals saw it 
working well at the first schools, they were happy to embrace it. Sure, 
trailers or use of rooms before or after school cause some negative impacts, 
but the program is worth such minor negatives." 
</P>
<P>
In Vista, coordinator Linda Maag said that several principals realized the need 
after finding students already on the grounds when administrators arrived at 
6:30 a.m. to open the buildings. Vista uses existing space at schools, and Maag 
said that principals must often compromise on providing a spare room, 
especially since district enrollment has ballooned in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think we have come a long way in persuading administrators that 
educating a child before or after school in some cases is a responsibility as 
well," Maag said. Although most of the parents who participate are middle- to 
upper-middle class, as in Poway, Maag does have those who cannot afford the 
$25- to $40-a-week cost. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been applying for grants, under which I set aside a certain amount for 
low-income families, since we don't get any funds from the district itself," 
Maag said. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido has expanded its program from one to three schools this fall with 
encouragement from its school board trustees, but it still cannot meet the 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran a little into the bureaucracy at first," coordinator Gloria Bond said. 
"But we talked a lot with the principals. They have personal experiences with 
latchkey kids and realize that they must do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
All the North County programs are run directly by the school districts, as are 
those in La Mesa-Spring Valley, Lakeside, Santee and South Bay. Leard said 
district control can help avoid transportation problems and can allow districts 
to satisfy building and safety regulations directly through the state education 
code, without having to wait for often time-consuming municipal regulatory 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
Those municipal regulations have slowed down Pardee significantly in its effort 
to provide portables for the several Mira Mesa-area schools in San Diego. 
Pardee agreed to cover the construction costs for a private social-service 
operator, Harmonium Inc., in an area where it has built thousands of houses 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Because the San Diego district runs no fee-for-service care of its own, a 
private group such as SAY or Harmonium must meet additional codes and 
requirements should it wish to use a trailer at a school. If the district 
placed the trailer itself and then leased it to a private child-care operator, 
the red tape would be unnecessary, Selverston of SAY said. 
</P>
<P>
But, beyond codes, the lack of direction from the school board has left 
proposals by private operators pretty much up to the whim of a principal, both 
regarding trailers and in trying to use an existing classroom or auditorium 
before or after school. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure we (as the public) build the schools and we ought to be able to access 
the rooms, but I have to negotiate with the site administrator at each school" 
and overcome questions of territory, of parking, "of all these things," 
Selverston said. 
</P>
<P>
At Vista Grande Elementary in Tierrasanta, principal Alex Cremidan acknowledged 
that he and his staff were not too enthusiastic when SAY approached them 
several years ago with a survey showing the need for child care. 
</P>
<P>
"The area they wanted already was being used for special education resource 
study and also by our English-as-a-second-language students," Cremidan said. 
"So we held several meetings with SAY and with the parents, and came up with a 
plan to move the resource specialist out of the area, but to have a cooperative 
use of the area with the language students." The program is now successfully 
operating. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, teachers are apprehensive, but once you sit down and adjust to meet 
the needs of the community -- of the kids, really -- we can work things out, 
especially since the parents are really thankful that we are doing this." 
</P>
<P>
Walker Elementary in Mira Mesa is one of the schools with the new program run 
by Harmonium using a trailer provided by Pardee. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a million reasons that a principal could come up to say this thing 
wouldn't fly, but I decided to help out, I didn't want to be a detriment," 
Principal Gilbert Gutierrez said.

IDEA IS IN THE BAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the issue of paper vs. plastic shopping bags, I would suggest neither 
("Big Bear Packages a Worthy Concept," Oct. 29). European shoppers generally 
bring along their own shopping bags, which are usually made of a lightweight 
see-through nylon netting. The bags fold up into a small wad in pocket or 
purse. This practice has got to save the stores a bundle. Perhaps some 
enterprising company could give away such bags free to shoppers with their 
logo, and stores might give some coupons to shoppers who bring their own bags 
as an added incentive.

SAVE THE DEPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the Oct. 28 article "Del Mar Depot Faces Closure, Demolition," I read both 
good news and bad. The good news is that a decision has finally been reached as 
to a location for the Del Mar/Solana Beach station on the Oceanside-San Diego 
commuter train. Del Mar has gotten what it deserves for its incredible myopic 
and self-centered attitude about this project (i.e., no station in Del Mar). 
</P>
<P>
The very bad news is the abandonment and proposed destruction of the Del Mar 
depot. I can't think of any reason to tear it down just because it's not going 
to be used by Amtrak anymore. We already have in San Diego County some 
excellent examples of railroad depot reuse (chambers of commerce, restaurants, 
museums, etc.). And Del Mar's 1912 structure is certainly deserving of some 
reasonable study for alternative uses. I understand that the model railroad 
group that uses a facility at the Del Mar Fairgrounds will soon need a new 
home, for example. 
</P>
<P>
Historic preservation has been (I thought) on the increase, even in Southern 
California. How can it possibly be justified to take away a building that 
stands not only for almost 80 years of railroad service to Del Mar but which 
can also be used for something else with minimal conversion or restoration?

RETHINK DESIGN PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most San Diegans would agree that our public buildings do a poor job of 
expressing our city's character, or inspiring our citizens. Yet, with the 
upcoming Civic Center competition, we are losing an unparalleled opportunity to 
create a city core of great buildings, since the proposed competition will 
emphasize developer "qualifications" instead of quality design. 
</P>
<P>
There are two fundamental problems with the proposed process: 
</P>
<P>
1. The overall emphasis of the judging is on developer's financial status, 
rather than architectural design. This is just the type of "bottom line" 
thinking that has helped create our national image as an uncultured city of 
cheap buildings. 
</P>
<P>
2. By emphasizing past architectural experience, young, new design talent will 
be eliminated and the number of potential designers severely restricted to 
those who are the current media stars. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, I propose a competition format which will deliver both the best design 
available and create savings for the city (rather than just a guaranteed 
maximum cost, with the builder profiting from any savings). This competition 
would be in four stages: 
</P>
<P>
Step 1: An open international, anonymous design competition to be judged on 
architectural merit (rather than the proposed statement of qualifications 
process, which becomes a political contest instead of a design competition). An 
open competition has historically been the best method to discover dynamic and 
appropriate design solutions, such as the Sydney Opera House, and to recognize 
new talent. 
</P>
<P>
Step 2: From the first-stage design submissions, select five proposals to be 
further developed, in conjunction with construction managers, cost estimators 
and other technical support, to ensure that the winning design can be built 
within budget. The design teams should certify that the proposal can be built 
within budget, at risk of redesign, or elimination. 
</P>
<P>
Step 3: Select a winning design and commission the team to create construction 
bid sets. 
</P>
<P>
Step 4: Finally, the winning project should be competitively bid among 
qualified construction contractors and awarded to the low bidder with the 
stipulation that 90% of any savings below the project budget will be returned 
to the public and 10% will be awarded to the design team for their cost-saving 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
This method is a realistic recognition of the extra work required of a designer 
to create a great design within cost limits, rather than by simply 
"gold-plating" a project with expensive materials. 
</P>
<P>
The people of San Diego would be the final winners with a combination of 
financial savings, and world-class design.

VISTA BOND ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yes, Vista schools are overcrowded and need refurbishing, but the November bond 
issue is a poor way of taking care of the problems. 
</P>
<P>
How did our schools get into this pickle? 
</P>
<P>
When our school board had the opportunity to collect sufficient fees to build 
new schools, it didn't, and even now it has explicitly stated its opposition to 
developer fees, and declared that general obligation bonds are the only fair 
method of financing new schools. It has also stated that this $38.8-million 
bond is only the first of several bond issues. 
</P>
<P>
The figure of $45 (the average annual tax on $100,000 of assessed valuation) is 
quite misleading. A more revealing statement would be to say the average 
homeowner would pay $109.57 the first year, and, if he should live so long, 
$12.72 in the last and 20th year. These figures are based on a $100,000 home. 
If your assessed value is different from that figure, multiply it by .0010957. 
</P>
<P>
Rapid growth means a rapid increase in need for all our infrastructure: 
schools, roads, sewers, jails, courts, etc. If you favor paying for all these 
things so the developers can sell more houses, here's your opportunity. If you 
think growth should pay its way, however, vote no on the Vista school bond. 
There are better ways to finance our problems, and double sessions won't be 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Vote no to show your disgust with the board's deliberate policy of delayed 
maintenance. Vote no to express your disapproval of the board's spending 
$20,000 for a consultant to influence the election. Vote no to say school 
children should not be exploited to collect money for the campaign. Send a 
message to the Vista and Oceanside city councils not to approve any more houses 
until the money for schools is up front.

UBIQUITOUS PLASTIC FOULS SEA, TAKES TOLL OF WILDLIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The oceans are choking in plastic junk that kills marine life and forms a crust 
on once pristine coastlines, according to a researcher who has combed the sea 
for five years. 
</P>
<P>
Industrial abuse heaped on the oceans became vivid in reports about the 
devastating Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska's Prince William Sound and the 
mysterious algae tides fouling beaches in the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
But less well known is that tons of long-lasting plastic debris has accumulated 
for years on the high seas, washing ashore on beaches thousands of miles away 
from where it was dumped. 
</P>
<P>
Like dirty rings on a bathtub, bits of plastic coat beaches from the central 
Gulf Coast to Cape Cod and across the Atlantic on the western shore of England. 
</P>
<P>
"I've found hockey pucks on beaches in the Bahamas," oceanographer Jude Wilber 
said in an interview. "Mediterranean coasts are very plasticized." 
</P>
<P>
Far out in the Atlantic on a 135-foot schooner, run as an educational program 
for college students, Wilber found that plastic pollution is ubiquitous. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gone from what we assume was a plastic-free ocean in 1960 to our present 
state," Wilber said. "Over large parts of the ocean well removed from any shore 
it's virtually impossible to tow a sample without getting some plastic. 
</P>
<P>
"Roughly 30% of the Atlantic contains high concentrations of plastic," he said. 
"In those areas, it is impossible to tow a net without getting something. You 
can find roughly 10,000 pieces per square kilometer," which is less than half a 
square mile. 
</P>
<P>
On dozens of voyages with student crews throughout the North Atlantic, Wilber 
has taken more than 1,000 samples by dragging a fine mesh bushel-sized net for 
a mile at a time. 
</P>
<P>
He winds up his research this fall with a final cruise to the Caribbean from 
the Woods Hole, Mass., base of the maritime program offered to college students 
by the Sea Education Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The plastic pollution kills fish, sea birds, turtles, seals and whales, and can 
damage coral in the tropics, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sea birds, including albatross and various species that never go ashore, are 
found stuffed with plastic beads or strangled by fishing line. 
</P>
<P>
Giant sea turtles have become an endangered species, partly because so many 
suffocate after ingesting plastic bags mistaken for jellyfish, a favored food. 
Whales and seals are similarly threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Coral is whisked away by snagged line whipped like a scythe by the waves. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the plastic junk escapes through fishermen's nets, but the beads of 
polyethylene ingested by fish and lobster is certainly undesirable from a 
consumer standpoint, said Robert Bryant, an expert on New England's lobster 
industry at the University of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
Plastic beads, the building blocks of all types of plastic goods, are 
manufactured in several nations and then transported by ship to be melted down 
and molded elsewhere. Spillage is relatively common. 
</P>
<P>
Wilber's research, since he first publicized his discoveries two years ago, has 
focused on the path of the debris. He has found that floating plastic 
circulates on ocean currents that reveal the Atlantic to be a gigantic 
whirlpool, centered in Bermuda. 
</P>
<P>
"People make the assumption that pollution is close to shore, and it's just not 
true," he says. "The highest concentrations are in the middle of the ocean, 
much higher than it is adjacent to any coast." 
</P>
<P>
Plastic is long-lived and most of it does not degrade either in landfills or in 
the ocean, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's subtle, with none of the dramatic, instantaneous effects such as you 
get with an oil spill or toxic waste dumping," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One disgusting result appears on the rocky coasts of Caribbean islands, Wilber 
said. A crust as much as half-a-foot thick, made up of tar from oil spills 
embedded with bits of plastic, extends over the entire windward shore of some 
islands. 
</P>
<P>
"The tar acts a lot like plastic in that it floats around the ocean for years. 
Coagulated clumps of oil get caught in our nets, too, and ends up on the same 
shores and beaches," Wilber said.

EMIGRATION OF POLITICAL PRISONERS IN VIETNAM CALLS FOR HELPING HANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART TORRESBD State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) represents the 24th 
District and is chairman of the Joint Committee on Refugee Resettlement, 
International Migration and Cooperative Development for the state Legislature. 
He is also a member of the Natio 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
July 29, 1989, was for most of us no different than any other day. But for 
Vietnamese-Americans, July 29 ushered in a new era of hope and brought to this 
community an answer to almost 15 years of prayers and endless waiting. 
</P>
<P>
On that historic date, our government reached an agreement with the government 
of Vietnam on a program for emigration of former re-education camp detainees, 
otherwise known as political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of this agreement, Vietnamese who were incarcerated in 
re-education camps because of their affiliation with the United States and 
South Vietnamese governments will be permitted to emigrate to the United 
States, many to rejoin their families. 
</P>
<P>
After the fall of Saigon in April, 1975, an unknown number, but estimated to be 
several hundred thousand, possibly 1 million, Vietnamese citizens were sent to 
re-education camps. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years thousands escaped; many died attempting escape or while in 
camps, some were released, and during 1987 and 1988 thousands of the remaining 
were released in a limited amnesty program. Over time, pressure on the 
Vietnamese government has steadily intensified to let these former prisoners 
emigrate to any country which would accept them. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, in our attempts to put the Vietnam war behind us, the plight of these 
men and women, many decorated war veterans, has been ignored. The prisoner 
releases and subsequent steps leading to the July 29 accord did not garner 
front page coverage and the accord itself was overshadowed by another legacy of 
our Vietnam involvement, Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
But the July 29 accord is good news for us all and should not be overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
The first of the former prisoners, known in the community as POWs, will be here 
within weeks and we should be prepared to provide them the assistance they need 
for a successful transition. We now have another opportunity to welcome Vietnam 
veterans. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing these men and women finally arrive here has special meaning for me as I 
reflect upon the time I shared with those I met in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly 
Saigon, on my April, 1989, family reunification trip -- a community-sponsored 
trip I made as chairman of the State Legislative Joint Committee on Refugee 
Resettlement. 
</P>
<P>
I remember quite well praying in the cathedral in Saigon with a former 
political prisoner I shall call Mr. Lam, husband and father to an Orange County 
family. I was touched by his strength of spirit, despite what I knew to be the 
harsh circumstances of his life and the continual frustrations he faced in 
realizing his dream of reuniting with his family soon. 
</P>
<P>
I went to Vietnam because I knew we had to keep letting the Vietnamese people 
know we cared. The former political prisoners I met there let me know how 
important our interventions were to them. For the 350,000 Vietnamese in 
California, 25% of whom live in Orange County, I knew our mission was 
important. Our efforts joined the work of many pushing the cause of the 
political prisoners and family reunification. 
</P>
<P>
Although released, they have no role, no job, no income. The impasse on 
negotiating to let them leave left them with little option but to risk escape 
and perhaps die, either at sea or the hands of pirates. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and Vietnam set up the orderly departure program as a safe 
option to emigrate to the United States. But that door was shut to former 
political prisoners for so long -- either negotiations were stalled or 
conditions were deemed unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
For me, and for so many new Californians, this breakthrough has great meaning. 
I think of Mr. Lam and now have hope for him and his family. And I believe the 
story of these brave men whose fight for freedom did not end in 1975 brings us 
face to face with our own blessings as free Americans. 
</P>
<P>
As the Vietnam veterans who preceded them faced problems coming back, they too, 
will find the road rocky as they build their new lives here. 
</P>
<P>
But we can help. We can appreciate their sacrifice and extend the hand of 
friendship. 
</P>
<P>
We can build upon the hope and great spirit that kept them alive and work 
together to help rebuild their lives.

IN SANTA ANA, A FOLLY AGAINST CITY ATTORNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Ana City Council is caught in a crazy confrontation with City Atty. 
Edward J. Cooper that is threatening to cause dissension just as many important 
issues, including approval for a proposed sports arena, are awaiting decision. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the seven council members have been trying to suspend the widely 
respected Cooper for reasons that they refuse to make clear. The only public 
statement by a Cooper opponent came from Councilman Richards L. Norton, who 
said his recommendation for an administrative review of the city attorney's 
office "was based solely on setting to rest, once and for all, the allegations 
and innuendoes that have been made in recent months." 
</P>
<P>
Those "allegations and innuendoes," however, appear to be known only to Norton 
and the others who joined in the ouster attempt, Miguel A. Pulido, John Acosta 
and Ron May. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper has the strong backing of the three remaining members of the council and 
has refused to leave. He says that the city charter requires five votes to oust 
him. The four anti-Cooper members are now going to the state attorney general 
for a ruling. And the three backing Cooper, Mayor Daniel H. Young, and council 
members Daniel E. Griset and Patricia A. McGuigan, are asking Orange County 
Dist. Atty. Cecil Hicks to launch a grand jury investigation of the attempted 
firing. 
</P>
<P>
The whole affair is tainted by the fact that Norton, Pulido and Acosta are all 
either currently or have in the past been involved in litigation filed by 
Cooper on behalf of the city. Norton is, in fact, facing a hearing Thursday on 
a case concerning a swap meet that the city is attempting to bar Norton from 
holding at Santa Ana Stadium. Norton sued, and the city countersued. 
</P>
<P>
At least in the case of Norton, it appears to us that there is a conflict of 
interest. That would reduce the number of votes against Cooper to three, short 
of a majority no matter how the city charter is interpreted. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-Cooper forces can proceed with this folly. But it will carry with it a 
cost to the city in the form of diversion of the council from matters of 
importance to the electorate.

THE ISSUE OF RAISING SALES TAX FOR ROADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was with a great deal of disappointment that I read your editorial espousing 
Measure M. It would only encourage the developers to build more and restore 
gridlock. Besides that, why do you favor the most unfair method of taxation 
such as an increase in sales tax, which falls on all of us, including those 
poor souls on welfare? 
</P>
<P>
Why not the fairest method of taxation, a surcharge or increase in the income 
tax where those who can afford more will pay more. This can also apply to the 
proposed increase in the gas tax to pay for the catastrophe of the recent 
earthquake. The more affluent pay for the needier.

ISSUES IN NEWPORT-MESA SCHOOL BOARD ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re Newport-Mesa Unified School District Election: 
</P>
<P>
Our current school board, working cooperatively with our community members, 
site administrators and district officials, has built an exemplary educational 
system that we do not wish to see undermined. Yet two of the challengers 
seeking election to the school board have accepted the support of a 
single-issue group committed to censoring the curriculum in our public schools. 
</P>
<P>
We are ready to stand up and be counted as angry at the insistent call for 
"reinstatement of traditional Christian values." The Christian values that we 
were taught include love of mankind and tolerance of others' views. We resent 
the intolerance of this group and the insinuation that people who do not accept 
their views on certain specific issues have suspect values.

THE EFFORT TO RECALL FOUNTAIN VALLEY COUNCILMAN VOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When we voted Fountain Valley City Councilman Fred Voss into public office, we 
did so with a number of expectations. We expected him to represent the majority 
of us in deciding matters within his jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
We expected him to show, by example, the way we are to go. We expected him to 
exhibit exemplary personal, moral, ethical and professional traits toward which 
we may all aspire. 
</P>
<P>
We expect to hold Voss accountable for his performance with respect to these 
issues while in public office. 
</P>
<P>
It is my belief, and the belief of a very large number of other Fountain Valley 
residents who signed petitions to place a measure on the November ballet to 
consider his recall, that Voss, as a result of poor judgment and questionable 
moral character, has forfeited his right to represent the citizens of this city 
and this caused us to doubt the soundness of his judgment in deciding issues 
regarding our interests. 
</P>
<P>
Any leader given to compromise in his personal life is subject to lack of 
discernment in his public life as well. A leader of character, when guilty of 
wrongdoing, is more sorry for the offense than for getting caught. It is our 
right and duty as citizens to vote yes for recall.

ISSUES IN NEWPORT-MESA SCHOOL BOARD ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
School board elections. Yawn. At least that's the way it has been in the past. 
But this year it's a different story. This fall has seen one of the most hotly 
contested school board races in the entire history of the Newport-Mesa Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning there has been a definite polarization of candidates into 
two distinct camps: those (who) maintain that parents pay for the schools and 
entrust their children to the schools for instruction, so schools should be 
held accountable to the parents, and those who believe that issues of education 
are "best left to the professionals on the staff." 
</P>
<P>
The real issue in this campaign is: Just who's in charge? It has been said that 
"Education is the key to the future, and parents are the key to education." 
Public education of our children is too important and too personal to leave in 
the hands of professionals exclusively. Parents can make their votes count on 
Nov. 7 by electing school board candidates who will re-establish the link 
between parents and schools.

ISSUES IN NEWPORT-MESA SCHOOL BOARD ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tuesday's contest for the Newport-Mesa Board of Education has ignited a flame 
of fear in me, for at issue is the smoldering threat of "censorship" promised 
by a group of extremist-minded candidates supported by groups whose sponsoring 
names belie their motives: Traditional Values Coalition, Citizens for 
Excellence in Education and Eagle Forum, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that the sole purpose of these organizations is to foist on the 
majority their minority views within the classroom in an attempt to mold 
children, all children, in their image. 
</P>
<P>
The tactic is classic censorship via the political process. All of us parents 
should be mortified at the prospect that the narrow convictions of a relatively 
few politically active (and well-financed) fundamentalists may predominate at 
the policy-setting level of our public schools. 
</P>
<P>
If the challengers fear information, information that has been professionally 
and sensitively proffered in our science and social studies classrooms, then 
they have no business making the policy decisions that will affect the future 
of my child. 
</P>
<P>
Information is power, the power to grow, to become educated, to make cogent 
decisions, to function. Censorship is insidious, undermining, retarding.

THE HUMAN RIGHTS ORDINANCE IN IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid all the hateful rhetoric about the Human Rights Ordinance, one fact seems 
to have been obscured: This ordinance has been in place for more than a year. 
None of the terrifying things the Irvine Values Coalition predicted has 
happened. We do not have quotas for any group listed in the ordinance; we have 
not had huge numbers of gays move to Irvine; we have not changed any laws 
regarding public or consensual sexual activities. Just like the state of 
Wisconsin and numerous cities throughout the nation, all we have done is to 
state clearly that we will not tolerate discrimination in housing or the 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
It appears that since the facts will not support its position, the Irvine 
Values Coalition has resorted to evoking every possible fear in order to tear 
apart the Human Rights Ordinance. This is contrary to a Scripture passage that 
they seem to have forgotten: "Perfect love casts out fear." I encourage the 
citizens of Irvine to embrace love and tolerance and to reject the tactics of 
fear and hatred. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance is in effect now. It protects all people and is a symbol of what 
we want Irvine to be: a tolerant, loving community that will not stand for 
hatred. Keep the symbol alive. Vote no on Measure N.

THE HUMAN RIGHTS ORDINANCE IN IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was reading the ballot arguments for and against Measure N in the Voter 
Information Pamphlet distributed by the Orange County registrar for Tuesday's 
ballot. I find a clear distinction in the way the arguments are presented. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's impartial summary says that "this initiative would delete 
any references to sexual orientation (in the city's Human Rights Ordinance)." 
</P>
<P>
The argument for Measure N says the issue is special protections for 
homosexuals, not discrimination, and proceeds to give examples of how that's 
true and reasons why the Human Rights Ordinance needs to be amended. 
</P>
<P>
The argument against the measure signed by the City Council defending its 
ordinance tells me that the "people of Irvine" enacted this "nationally 
acclaimed Human Rights Ordinance." I don't know about you, but I didn't vote 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor tells me that a "handful . . . of extremists seek to destroy this 
ordinance." Yet the press reports that 7,000 Irvine signatures qualified N for 
the ballot. Since when did 10% of the voters become a "handful of extremists?" 
Only 8,500 voters showed up at the last school board election. 
</P>
<P>
Why does the City Council insist on name-calling rather than dealing with the 
issue as the city attorney outlined it? I would encourage everyone to read the 
arguments for and against and then let the mayor know how you feel on Tuesday.

MEDI-CAL PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with no surprise your article "More Doctors Shun Medi-Cal Prenatal 
Coverage" (Oct. 24). Sadly, I must report that I too have stopped taking 
Medi-Cal despite my strong liberal feelings and concern for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
My problem is not the terrible pay of less than one-third of a normal fee; I 
can live with that for some patients. The problem is the horrible bureaucracy. 
The state agency makes collection so time-consuming and irritating that my 
office manager refuses to do their billing, and I don't blame her. Therefore, I 
have to pay someone else extra money for doing the laborious paper work when 
full pay doesn't even cover the overhead. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, our Medi-Cal administrators have found a way to combine the worst of 
capitalism and socialism in our bureaucracy. Perhaps it is a conspiracy to 
cripple help for the poor because it sure works that way. 
</P>
<P>
I take a modest number of very-low-pay patients to assuage my social 
conscience. If the "system" ever figures out a way to run Medi-Cal competently, 
I'll be glad to be reactivated.

HOMELESS FAMILIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your articles on homeless families (Oct. 15 and 16) move me and prompt my 
speaking up. 
</P>
<P>
Affordable housing for low-income people is nearly impossible to find these 
days. The National Coalition for the Homeless estimates that as many as 3 
million Americans are homeless today. And a recent Congressional study 
indicates that if the current trend continues, as many as 19 million people may 
be homeless within the next 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of U.S. apartments now receive federal subsidies under contracts that 
are about to expire and hundreds of thousands of others are receiving mortgage 
subsidies that soon will allow private, profit-motivated owners to convert the 
properties to condominiums or high-income rentals, displacing the renters. 
</P>
<P>
Housing Now sent a loud and urgent message to Congress and the Bush 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Housing Now is part of a nationwide, ongoing demand that every American have 
decent, affordable housing. Our job as citizens is to create the political will 
with our elected officials that will make it happen.

FORTUNES FADE FOR TATTERED S&amp;L TRADE GROUP; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: INDUSTRY SCANDALS AND STAGGERING BAILOUT COSTS HAVE ROCKED THE ONCE 
ALL-POWERFUL U.S. LEAGUE OF SAVINGS INSTITUTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not long ago, the U.S. League of Savings Institutions had clout that few trade 
groups enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
It picked people who regulated it. It wrote laws that sailed through Congress, 
and torpedoed ones that it didn't like. It wined and dined politicians nightly. 
Most of the time it got its way. 
</P>
<P>
"The league was all powerful," said Edwin J. Gray Jr., who regulated the thrift 
industry from 1983 to 1987 as head of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. 
</P>
<P>
Now the good times are over. Today, the league, shrunken and humbler, gathers 
in Chicago for its annual convention. Like the thrift industry that it 
represents, the league is in tatters. It is losing members by the hundreds. Its 
influence and credibility are nowhere near what they once were. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, some 600 thrifts have dropped off its membership rolls, leaving 
2,765. Most of those that left were insolvent S&amp;Ls that were acquired, 
merged into other thrifts or went out of business. League officials expect that 
200 or more may be gone by year-end as regulators continue mopping up troubled 
institutions as part of the federal government's huge savings and loan bailout. 
</P>
<P>
The membership drop has caused big financial headaches for the trade group. 
Facing a cash crunch, the league was forced to slash its budget for next year 
to a projected $27 million. That compares to $32.5 million in 1988. Among the 
casualties: 50 employees lost their jobs earlier this year, representing more 
than 10% of the league's workers. 
</P>
<P>
More challenging than stemming the U.S. League's financial and membership 
problems may be repairing the image of both the trade group and the industry. 
Few industries have been subjected to the public flogging that the thrift 
industry and its trade group took this year. 
</P>
<P>
Taxpayers are angry at having been blindsided by a staggering savings and loan 
fiasco. Losses are so severe and climbing so fast that the bill for taxpayers, 
some estimate, may eventually exceed $1,000 for every man, woman and child in 
the nation. It didn't help the industry image that taxpayer-insured deposits at 
some rogue institutions were squandered on paintings that hang in the Vatican, 
antique car collections, French chefs and 605-room resorts. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas the league once got its way in legislative scraps, this summer it lost 
nearly every major fight in shaping the bailout and the stricter regulations 
that came with it. Legislators who once were cozy with the league scorned it. 
Many politicians and industry officials say the league shoulders much of the 
blame for the thrift mess, for fighting such things as restrictions on risky 
investments that might have helped stem the red ink. 
</P>
<P>
"Its image is at an all-time low," said Richard Pratt, who headed the Federal 
Home Loan Bank Board before Gray and now heads the mortgage capital markets 
operations at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, investor Warren E. Buffett and partner Charles T. Munger, 
who control Mutual Savings, a small thrift in Pasadena, pulled the institution 
out of the league in disgust. Had it been anyone else, it probably would have 
gone unnoticed. But this was Warren Buffett talking, the nation's 
second-richest individual and one of its most respected investors. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the league was fighting some provisions in the federal bailout 
eventually signed by President Bush in August. In a letter to the league, 
Munger went so far as to say its actions were as if Exxon had encouraged 
drinking by tanker captains after the Valdez oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the biggest mess and biggest scandal that ever happened to financial 
institutions in the United States. And the league had almost a 100% record of 
being on the wrong side of the issues," Munger said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Needless to say, the trade group believes that it has been unfairly picked on. 
</P>
<P>
"My gut tells me that the league was a convenient whipping boy, punching bag 
and fall guy," said Frederick L. Webber, president and chief executive of the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
No one, league officials argue, knew the extent of the thrift mess when the 
first signs appeared. Government estimates were particularly bad, they add. And 
policing rogue members, they argue, is not the job of any trade group.

B. R. (Barney) Beeksma, outgoing chairman of the league, contends that the 
worst thrift owners have been purged from the business, particularly those that 
ran the high-flying institutions in Texas and California. He said this reflects 
a much more conservative group that favors such things as stronger capital, the 
financial cushion that thrifts must maintain. 
</P>
<P>
"It's taken a bum rap," Beeksma said. 
</P>
<P>
Webber, a former soft-drink industry trade official, has the job of restoring 
the league and keeping it financially sound. In general, he gets good reviews 
so far. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the toughest trade association jobs in Washington," Webber said. 
</P>
<P>
Webber took over as chief executive late last year from William O'Connell, 
under whose leadership the association reached its zenith in the mid-1980s 
while becoming so controversial. 
</P>
<P>
It once employed a lobbyist nicknamed "Snake" whose wining and dining of 
Fernand St Germain, the former Rhode Island congressman and House Banking 
Committee chairman, sparked a number of official inquiries that died after St 
Germain was defeated for re-election. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to entertaining politicians, the league sometimes had an incestuous 
relationship with regulators. Gray, for example, was first approached about the 
bank board job by league officials, not people from the Reagan Administration. 
Once he had the group's blessing, he says now, his confirmation hearing was 
"like a knife cutting through butter." 
</P>
<P>
Members and league officials are sensitive to past misdeeds of league 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
"That can't happen again. I think you've got to keep control," said Norman M. 
Coulson, chief executive of Glenfed Inc., parent of Glendale Federal Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Webber hesitated to comment on past league activities, saying he doesn't like 
to discuss things that went on before he took over. He said, however, that the 
league has moved on and describes those days as "nothing but a vague memory." 
</P>
<P>
Webber and league officials say that the league's power in the past was 
exaggerated and that its relationship with regulators varied with each one. 
</P>
<P>
"When you call an organization all powerful, you assume you can own congressmen 
and senators. That's dead wrong," Webber said. 
</P>
<P>
But Gray, the former head of the bank board, disagreed. He was friendly with 
the league at first, but came to resent it as it fought his efforts to stem the 
big losses that he saw coming. 
</P>
<P>
"They killed every piece of reform legislation we sent to Congress. They wrote 
all the laws," Gray said. Among the proposals it killed, he said, was one that 
would have curtailed the kind of direct investments that got many thrifts into 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Uniting league members will be difficult for Webber as well. Herbert M. 
Sandler, chairman of Oakland-based Golden West Financial Corp., parent of World 
Savings, said he is continually questioning whether his thrift should be a 
member. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just me. There are many, many others. What we are waiting to see is 
what Fred Webber will do," Sandler said. 
</P>
<P>
Sandler, who runs one of the largest and healthiest thrifts in the nation, is 
disillusioned with the league. He said it has fought too long for rules that 
the weakest, worst managed institutions need. Sandler said he was especially 
disappointed that the league did not take a stronger stand this summer on 
measures to make sure that the thrift debacle doesn't happen again. 
</P>
<P>
Defections by larger thrifts could cripple the league. Members pay according to 
size, and the larger ones can pay dues of $30,000 to $60,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Some members suggest that for the league to recover, it must make affordable 
housing and increased home ownership its main goals and become the lobby that 
is most often identified with those issues. 
</P>
<P>
The league seems to be moving that way. The program for this week's convention 
is titled "Housing: Continuing the Commitment," and a large proportion of 
seminars for members involve housing issues. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond internal politics, the league must deal with larger problems facing the 
entire industry. Some predict that the thrift industry won't exist as a 
separate business in 10 years as S&amp;Ls become more like banks. A lot of 
thrifts don't even want to be called savings and loans anymore, and have 
changed their names to banks. 
</P>
<P>
This summer's bailout will force many thrifts out of business, and its tougher 
standards will make it harder for some thrifts to stay independent. 
</P>
<P>
Said Pratt, the former bank board head: "The primarily role for the league now 
is one of damage control."

<P>
When Don Heinicke looks at his apple orchard -- 288 fertile acres tucked into a 
curve of the Columbia River -- he sees a stream of money rushing away as fast 
as the river itself. 
</P>
<P>
Since the furor over Alar hit nine months ago, Heinicke has had to find means 
to keep his fruit on the tree long enough to turn red without the controversial 
growth regulator -- measures that add as much as $400 per acre in growing costs 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
Without the chemical, Heinicke has tried methods ranging from complicated 
pruning strategies to intricate overhead sprinkler systems to redden his crop. 
A record Washington harvest has compounded his problems, he says; apple prices 
are as low as he's seen in five years. "The lack of Alar has hurt us," says 
Heinicke, managing partner of Cascade Foothills orchard. "We've put in all 
these extra costs . . . and we've overproduced. It's hard to get along without 
that crutch." 
</P>
<P>
Heinicke has just struggled through his first harvest since the Alar 
controversy rocked the apple industry. It has been a harvest of drastic 
measures and dire prophecies throughout the nation's apple-growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
In California, where the Granny Smith is widely grown, depressed prices have 
trickled down from Washington state. In New England, unseasonable rains have 
decimated this year's McIntosh crop. The absence of Alar has also caused many 
Northeastern farmers to rethink the types of apples that they grow and consider 
selling family orchards for development. 
</P>
<P>
And in the nation's apple capital, officials from the Washington Apple 
Commission have just returned from a whirlwind tour of the country, trying to 
increase demand for the Red Delicious -- the archetypal Washington apple and 
the major focus of last winter's Alar controversy. 
</P>
<P>
In February, the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council issued a report 
charging that Alar residues posed an unacceptably high risk for cancer, 
particularly in children, who consume large amounts of apple products. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the group questioned the reliability of data used by the council to 
reach its conclusions. Others voiced concern about the council's lack of 
responsibility, complaining that scaring consumers into taking fresh fruits and 
vegetables out of their diets was as damaging as the Alar itself. 
</P>
<P>
The report, however, caused a furor that briefly took apples off school lunch 
menus and caused apple sales to plunge. The episode has changed the way that 
apples look and could cause shortages of several perennial favorites, like the 
Stayman and the Winesap, which crack without Alar treatment. And the impact is 
still felt. 
</P>
<P>
"There have only been a few years in this century that have been catastrophes," 
said Bob Riggan, president of Gwin, White &amp; Prince, Inc., an apple 
marketing firm in Wenatchee, Wash. "We've had two in a row." 
</P>
<P>
And if demand for Washington apples doesn't increase soon, the state's apple 
industry could be heading into a third. 
</P>
<P>
The first bad year was 1987, a harvest of miserable quality, one with problems 
so severe that even Alar didn't help. Washington growers make their money from 
so-called fresh market apples, the reddest, prettiest fruit. These are apples 
raised for sale to supermarkets, not processing companies, made to munch, not 
mash into juice and sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The rule of thumb is that 75% of Washington's apple crop is sold in markets 
throughout the world for eating and baking. Fresh market apples garner about 
twice the price of apples sold for processing. In 1987, the total harvest was 
107 million bushels, but only 68 million, or 63%, were good enough for the 
fresh market. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a horrendous diversion to processing," said Charles E. St. John, 
spokesman for the apple commission. "There were record-high daytime 
temperatures in September and October. The reds didn't turn red. Those that did 
sunburned." 
</P>
<P>
When the next year's apple harvest ended in November, 1988, weather again was 
on the Washington growers' side. Public opinion, however, was not. Of the 84 
million bushels of apples picked, nearly 76% were good enough to sell, and 
wholesale prices were high -- but only for four months. 
</P>
<P>
"Had we followed the trend line we were on up through February (1989), the 
average season price would have been close to $15 a box," St. John said. "It 
would have been an excellent year." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the average price for a bushel of apples -- also known as a 42-pound 
box -- dropped to $12.62, St. John said. And the price for a bushel of extra 
fancy Red Delicious had an even more precipitous plunge: September, 1988, 
$18.67 per bushel. June, 1989, $8.40 per bushel. 
</P>
<P>
For Heinicke of Cascade Foothills in Chelan, the change was quick and dramatic. 
All of Heinicke's apples from tart green Granny Smiths to robust Rome Beauties 
are stored, shipped and sold through a packing house not far from his ranch. 
The firm starts paying him for his fall harvests in December of the same year, 
based on market estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Heinicke gets a check a month for 10 months, checks representing a 10th of his 
entire harvest's value. In January, for example, he received about $175,000 in 
payment for his 1988 harvest. March and April checks were closer to $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
"After that, it started going back up slowly," he said. "But it never did get 
back up to the $175,000 we had originally." 
</P>
<P>
What happened? Apples simply stopped selling. After the two largest school 
districts in the nation -- Los Angeles Unified and New York City -- pulled 
apples and apple products from their cafeteria trays, smaller districts around 
the nation followed suit. Major export markets, such as Taiwan, Thailand and 
Hong Kong, briefly collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
And consumer confidence was cut nearly in half. The Washington Apple Commission 
does daily phone surveys of nine major markets nationwide, including Los 
Angeles. In mid-February, before the NRDC report was released, 89% of the 
consumers asked said they definitely planned to buy apples in the future. By 
the end of March, only 55% said apples were on their shopping lists. 
</P>
<P>
"In the work that we did, 11% said they'd reduced their usage based on chemical 
concerns -- basically Alar," St. John said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, 3 million to 4 million more bushels of fruit were left in storage 
than in previous seasons. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
Washington state alone lost an estimated $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
The USDA kept the 1988 harvest from being a complete bust with its first apple 
buyout program. On July 7, the agency announced that it would spend up to $15 
million to buy surplus apples and then distribute them to charities, livestock 
feeders and ethanol distillers. Only $9.5 million was distributed because of 
lack of participation in the program. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the $9.5 million went to Washington," St. John said. "Only about 
$300,000 went elsewhere. On Aug. 1, the majority of the apples in the country 
were here in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
Riggan's apple marketing firm diverted nearly 50,000 bushels into the program 
on behalf of growers big and small. The average price received was about $6.30 
per bushel -- about half of the average price that they could have received had 
they sold to markets. 
</P>
<P>
But it's a lot better than nothing, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"The apple market just became a burden, selling red apples," Riggan said. "This 
allowed us to really clean up the old crop apples that had the stigma. It 
cleaned out the pipelines for the new crop." 
</P>
<P>
Riggan has spent nearly 20 years in greater Wenatchee, a valley of rolling 
foothills at the base of the Cascade Mountains. Wenatchee is in Chelan County 
and vies with Yakima as the state's greatest apple producer. 
</P>
<P>
In November, as the two-month harvest comes to a close, its orchards are a 
green patchwork stitched together with stands of golden poplars. From the 
window of Gwin, White &amp; Prince, Riggan watches the harvest wind down and 
talks of his bitterness over the Alar controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the saddest thing to hit the industry since I've been here, 19 years," 
he said. "The so-called consumer groups swung the ax and devastated an 
industry. What's fair in that? . . . What started as a great year turned into a 
nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
St. John and the apple commission are still battling for the hearts and 
stomachs of the nation's consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, St. John flew to Los Angeles, the first leg of a tour aimed at 
"increasing the sales of Washington apples and increasing consumer preference 
for Washington apples" in a year with a record volume crop and insufficient 
consumer demand. 
</P>
<P>
It was his second such trip in less than a year and represented only the second 
time that the commission has taken to the road to stump for its product. The 
first, of course, was last March. 
</P>
<P>
"In March, I was basically leading the crisis management team on Alar for the 
industry nationally," he said. "I was out fighting back brush fires this 
spring." 
</P>
<P>
Apple commission surveys show that consumer confidence has rebounded from last 
winter's depths. By June, about 80% of those surveyed said they planned to buy 
apples, a figure that's held steady through August, the most recent figures 
available. 
</P>
<P>
But the commission's fall advertising campaign bears subtle differences from 
its 1988 predecessor. Last autumn, the national ad slogan was: "Bite into the 
best -- Washington apples." This year another line has been added to distance 
the crop from the Alar disaster. It's now: "Bite into the best -- Washington 
apples. We've got a whole new crop." 
</P>
<P>
To quiet any residual questions, Washington state's Department of Agriculture 
instituted an emergency testing program for the 1989 harvest. From Aug. 28 to 
Sept. 8, technicians picked 10,000 randomly selected apples from 1,125 sites 
throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time we've done this," said Mike Schwisow, deputy director 
of the Washington state department of agriculture. "We took as many samples in 
this Alar program as we have funds to do all year round in all commodities." 
</P>
<P>
The price tag: $60,000, half from the growers and half from the governor's 
emergency fund. The results: Negative; no traceable Alar was found on the 1989 
crop. The impact on sales: too soon to tell. 
</P>
<P>
But growers, shippers and packers have a lot riding on the success of such 
efforts. Instead of running out of 1988 apples by August, Washington growers 
put 1.5 million bushels into the USDA diversion program and still had 500,000 
bushels left. 
</P>
<P>
Follow that with one of the biggest apple harvests in recent memory -- 107 
million bushels worth -- and you have what the apple commission likes to think 
of as a marketing challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The harvest size has eclipsed the state's storage capabilities, so there is 
pressure to sell before the unprotected apples -- those not in proper bins and 
refrigerated rooms -- go bad. That in itself pushes prices down, Alar or no. 
</P>
<P>
"We're selling at prices that we're not happy with," says Thomas K. Mathison, 
president of Stemilt Growers Inc., Washington's largest packing and shipping 
house. "The truth of the matter is we have the largest crop in history. And we 
have to restore consumer confidence in the product." 
</P>
<P>
In one recent October week, nearly three-quarters of the apples that Stemilt 
sold went for less than $9 per bushel -- around $1 below the break-even point 
for the company's clients. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, if the market price stopped at this level, it'd be a very 
disappointing year for a lot of people," Mathison said. "It's not profitable. 
There's loss there for the grower." 
</P>
<P>
And not just the Washington grower. In California, where little Alar was ever 
used, the most widely grown apple is the Granny Smith. And growers of the tart, 
green fruit have had a huge harvest, too. Kenton Kidd, president of the 
California Granny Smith Assn., predicts that the harvest will reach 5 million 
bushels, nearly double that of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But because Washington's problems have lowered prices throughout the nation, 
Kidd said, Granny Smith growers could face losses of up to $20 million this 
season because the apples are averaging $3 to $4 less per bushel than in past 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all affected by it," he said. "We couldn't compete with (Washington's) 
low prices without being low-priced ourselves. It's been a disastrous effect." 
</P>
<P>
Eastern New York and the New England states produce 65% of the nation's crop of 
McIntosh apples, a distinctive two-tone red and green fruit. Bad weather and no 
Alar struck a double blow to the area's growers. 
</P>
<P>
John O'Donnell, spokesman for the New York &amp; New England Apple Institute, 
figures that at least half of the area's McIntosh growers used Alar to some 
degree in 1988. A very tender apple, McIntosh have a tendency to fall off the 
tree long before the entire harvest can be picked. Alar, he said, allows the 
apple to hang on the tree an extra week or two, basically doubling the harvest 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"Recognizing there was no Alar this year, the growers geared up and hired as 
much help as they could, picked as fast as possible," O'Donnell said. "But they 
were still losing a great deal that would fall before picked." 
</P>
<P>
Original predictions put the harvest at about 11 million bushels, O'Donnell 
said. But bad rains at spring blossom and harvest times, coupled with the 
inability to use Alar, cut the harvest down to an estimated 9 million bushels. 
</P>
<P>
What growers are doing, he said, is looking at alternatives: different 
varieties and different use of the land. The heartier Empire apple is one 
possibility. Selling out entirely is another. 
</P>
<P>
"You are talking about increasing populations of people in an area where land 
is increasing in value," he said. "You get awfully tempted when someone says 
they want your acre of orchard land for $40,000, and you figure all you can get 
off it is $1,000 in apples. You get awfully tempted." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the lessons of Alar are not all bad for the nation's growers. In New 
England, for example, apple growers realized this season that they had used 
Alar to keep their fruit on the tree until it was actually overripe. 
</P>
<P>
Washington state's success with its very red Red Delicious made other growers 
think that only red would sell, O'Donnell said. Without Alar, New England 
growers couldn't get their McIntosh as red as they wanted and ended up with a 
crisper, tastier crop. 
</P>
<P>
"We were trying to grow red McIntosh when we really shouldn't have tried so 
hard," O'Donnell said. "This has given us a reason to look more at quality, not 
appearance, in growing practices." 
</P>
<P>
And, like it or not, Don Heinicke has learned to make do without Alar in 
Washington state. It's reduced his crop size, cost him more money, made him 
rethink his growing practices and made his life miserable. But, so far, it's 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
More light means redder apples, so he's pruned his trees with greater 
precision, he said, "to open up the trees and manage for light, and we've 
thinned the apples more." Cooler temperatures mean redder apples, so he's 
installed overhead sprinklers to cool down the fruit on hot days. 
</P>
<P>
"All these things cost us money and cut down on our production," he said, "but 
it helped our color." 
</P>
<P>
STORING RED DELICIOUS APPLES 
</P>
<P>
As the year goes on, the numbers of boxes in storage in 1989 compared to 1988 
grows as a direct effect of the Alar controversy. Typically, the crop is gone 
in the latter part of August, around Aug 20. It wasn't this year. The only 
thing that saved the day for the Washington apple industry was the USDA 
diversion program, announced July 7, whereby several million boxes of apples 
were bought by the government and diverted to non-traditional uses, such as 
animal feed, ethanol manufacture and food banks.

ALAR AND THE PRICE OF APPLES 
</P>
<P>
When the Alar scare hit, Washington apples had been commanding record high 
prices for months. But in February, the effects of the scare began to show. 
Prices dipped to lows that growers say kept them from breaking even. The 
following shows the progression in the average price for a 42-pound box (a 
bushel) of extra fancy Red Delicious apples.

ROGER SIMON: IN A PICKLE IN HONG KONG

<TEXT>
<P>
"No pickles," the waiter is saying. "We have pastrami. We don't have pickles." 
</P>
<P>
I smile. I shake my head. Please, I say, no jokes. Pastrami without pickles is 
like a wedding without the bride. 
</P>
<P>
"Cornball philosophy we got," the waiter says. "What we don't got are pickles." 
</P>
<P>
Which just goes to prove that deli waiters are the same the world over, even in 
Hong Kong. I am in Kowloon, which is the mainland part of Hong Kong across the 
harbor from Hong Kong island. Surrounding Kowloon is a chunk of land called the 
New Territories, and surrounding that is a rather large piece of geography 
called China. 
</P>
<P>
The British took Hong Kong from China in 1841 because the British had bigger 
guns. In 1997, the Chinese will take Hong Kong back because now China has 
bigger guns. 
</P>
<P>
This is called diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety-eight percent of the people who live in Hong Kong are Chinese, which 
gives them a good understanding of China, but a rather limited understanding of 
pastrami. 
</P>
<P>
It is my belief, however, that pastrami will someday become a global constant 
like gold. There may even be precious food trading pits just like there are 
currently precious metal trading pits. Feverish men will jump up and down 
yelling, "I've got lean at 16 and a quarter! I've got fatty at 10 and an 
eighth!" 
</P>
<P>
In any case, I have tried to find pastrami in every country I have reported 
from. This was easy in South Africa, a bit tricky in Beirut and a real 
challenge in Saudi Arabia. Hong Kong, however, I was not worried about. Hong 
Kong has everything. 
</P>
<P>
I do not ignore local foods, of course. In Hong Kong, I ate not only the 
familiar Cantonese and Sichuan foods, but also Hakka and Shanghainese and Hunan 
and Chiu Chow foods. 
</P>
<P>
And for days I had been eating my shark fins (better than them eating me) and 
eels and chili con carne. Yes, like pizza and spaghetti, the Chinese also 
invented chili. Mao Zedong (who used to be Mao Tse-tung until he woke up one 
day with a completely different name) was Hunanese and loved chiles and once 
said the more chiles you ate, the more revolutionary you were. 
</P>
<P>
Funny, I always thought they just gave you gas. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, I woke up one morning with a craving for a good pastrami sandwich. And 
the concierge at the Regent Hotel in Kowloon assured me there was a restaurant 
not far away called the Beverly Hills Deli that served real pastrami. 
</P>
<P>
"Chinese invented pastrami," he said proudly. "And rye." 
</P>
<P>
And pickles? I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Them too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the smell of burning incense from a furniture store a few doors 
down, the Beverly Hills Deli could be like any deli in, say, Beverly Hills. 
Which was the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the Chinese think Beverly Hills is the deli capital of America, 
which is very far from the truth. As everyone knows, the Mecca, the Valhalla, 
the Mt. Everest of pastrami in America is the Carnegie Deli in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
How good is it? Henny Youngman eats there. 'Nuff said. 
</P>
<P>
But as often happens, things gets slightly mistranslated as they travel across 
the globe. And so in Hong Kong they somehow think pastrami belongs in a 
Hollywood motif. 
</P>
<P>
So the Beverly Hills Deli in Kowloon is decorated with big pictures of Charlie 
Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy and other dead movie stars. There are also 
bentwood chairs and red-checked tablecloths. And a sign saying: "Kosher meals 
on request." 
</P>
<P>
I was going to ask if the Chinese also invented kosher, but instead I just 
ordered a pastrami on rye with extra pickles. 
</P>
<P>
"No pickles," the waiter said. 
</P>
<P>
My heart sank. Why no pickles? I asked. 
</P>
<P>
The waiter shrugged. Nobody in the world can shrug like a Hong Kong waiter. It 
is like the weight of world is pressing down on his forehead. 
</P>
<P>
"Not come in today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This is the universal excuse in Hong Kong. Since the place is so tiny, almost 
everything is imported from elsewhere. Food comes from China and Japan and the 
Philippines and Hawaii and California. 
</P>
<P>
So I had the pastrami without pickles. And I am trying to be fair. It was not 
bad. It was not as good as the pastrami in New York, of course, or even 
Baltimore or Los Angeles. But it was better than the pastrami in Las Vegas, 
Montreal and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
But I was not in the best of moods when I left the Beverly Hills Deli. 
Technically, I was in Hong Kong to find out what is going to happen here when 
the Chinese government takes over in 1997. Most of the residents are very, very 
worried. 
</P>
<P>
But I say let's be open-minded. 
</P>
<P>
I say let's wait and see if they bring the pickles with them.

<P>
MEMORABILIA: FIFTY YEARS AFTER ITS RELEASE, "THE WIZARD OF OZ" IS STILL 
GENERATING ALL KINDS OF "OZ" WARE. THE NEWEST COLLECTIBLE: REPLICAS OF 
DOROTHY'S RUBY SLIPPERS, WHICH WILL SELL FOR $5,000 A PAIR. 
</P>

<P>
On the golden anniversary of the release of the 1939 film, "The Wizard of Oz," 
Ozmania marketers are following the yellow brick road all the way to the bank: 
</P>
<P>
Pairs of $200 ruby slipper costume earrings are so popular that department 
stores are having a tough time keeping them in stock. 
</P>
<P>
Rhys Thomas' new book, "The Ruby Slippers of Oz," went into a second printing 
two weeks after it came out in late August. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred people are on a waiting list for artist Melanie Taylor Kent's 
official "Oz" serigraphs, which began selling at $1,000 and are now going for 
$2,500. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA Home Video Inc. has sold more than 2 million "Wizard" anniversary 
videocassettes. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-nine firms nationwide have been licensed to produce official "Oz" ware -- 
from Franklin Mint heirloom dolls ($135-$245) to children's lunch boxes, 
greeting cards, clothing, board games, watches, beach towels, banks, playing 
cards, dishes and Christmas ornaments. 
</P>
<P>
The latest to join the national "Oz" craze is Western Costume Co. in Hollywood. 
It plans to produce a limited edition of 500 pairs of red shoes, replicas of 
Dorothy's ruby slippers made from the original molds. 
</P>
<P>
Their price: more than $5,000 a pair. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a tremendous amount of calls from people who are interested in the 
slippers and heard we still had the molds," said Western Costume President Paul 
Abramowitz. "We figured while the old shop is still available -- we're 
currently looking for another building -- we should create the replicas. We're 
offering a work of art, a handmade collectible from one of the 25 treasured 
movies of the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
He said he is considering setting up an auction for the first pair of replica 
slippers produced by Western Costume, hoping to raise enough money to buy a 
print of the film and donate it to the Library of Congress, which does not have 
one. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Library of Congress officials designated "The Wizard of Oz" among 
the nation's top 25 movie treasures of all time. 
</P>
<P>
The costume company's president intends to discuss the auction project with Ted 
Turner, who acquired the rights to the movie when he bought the MGM film 
library in 1986 and took over the licensing venues in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Western Costume, like all other licensees of "Wizard" products, has a contract 
with Turner Entertainment Co. to produce the replicas, with Turner's firm 
receiving a royalty. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Western Costume reproduced a pair of ruby slippers for the Turner 
company to display in its store at CNN Center in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
All official "Oz" paraphernalia, as well as that of "Gone With the Wind," 
another national treasure film that is celebrating its 50th anniversary in 
December, is licensed through Turner's Atlanta-based corporation. 
</P>
<P>
For movie memorabilia buffs, the price of Western Costume's ruby slipper 
replicas may not seem too steep, considering what original "Wizard" 
collectibles go for: 
</P>
<P>
A pair of the original ruby slippers sold for $165,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Wicked Witch's hat brought $33,000. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy's gingham dress went for $22,000. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Christie's East auction house in New York City collected $20,000 for 
the Cowardly Lion's "Witch Remover," a 28-inch spray can that Bert Lahr carried 
while hunting for Margaret Hamilton in the Haunted Forest. 
</P>
<P>
At the Broadway, which has offered a collection of "Oz" costume jewelry by New 
York designer Wendy Gell for 1 1/2 months, the $200 ruby-pave slipper earrings 
have outsold all the various "Oz" character pins. 
</P>
<P>
But recently, sales of "Oz" witch pins have picked up. 
</P>
<P>
"Currently, the good and bad witch pins are selling very well," said Jeff 
Sinfield, fashion jewelry buyer for the Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mystery of Slippers 
</P>
<P>
Dick Weaver of Tale Weaver Publishing, the Los Angeles company that is 
publishing "The Ruby Slippers of Oz," believes that "being the anniversary year 
helped (book sales), but it's more than that. There's a mystery surrounding the 
slippers, and I don't know anyone who doesn't love the film. It makes you 
wonder if Hollywood will ever produce anything like that again. I think 'Oz' 
even eclipses 'E. T.' " 
</P>
<P>
The mystery, as Thomas points out in his book, is that no one is sure how many 
pairs of shoes there were or how many were made specifically for Judy Garland 
or bought from a Hollywood shoe company. 
</P>
<P>
It is believed there are at least seven pairs. One is in the Smithsonian; the 
others are privately owned. 
</P>
<P>
They weren't even red to start with, according to Al DiPardo, who retired from 
his job as shoe cutter and fitter at Western Costume in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
DiPardo said that he cut the original pairs of shoes for Garland, "no more than 
three or four pair." 
</P>
<P>
His deceased brother-in-law, Joe Napoli, Western Costume's shoemaker at the 
time, fashioned the original shoes, DiPardo insisted. "And they weren't covered 
with red sequins. They were white satin. And they had 1 1/2-inch heels. They 
were doctored with the sequins by the studio (MGM)." 
</P>
<P>
DiPardo, who lives in Sherman Oaks, recalled that "after she (Garland) worked 
in them (the shoes) they were ugly. The sequins popped off -- they were just 
glued on. One pair came back to Western for repair, and went back to the 
studio. I never saw them again." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the pairs have numbers inside, which indicates they were bought rather 
than custom-made, DiPardo explained: "The shoes Western Costume made had no 
number and no size in them. My sister, Carmella, worked there, too, and she 
printed JUDY GARLAND inside the shoes. No size and no number. Judy wore a 5B. I 
made the shoes she wore in 'A Star Is Born.' " 
</P>
<P>
For its part in Ozmania, MGM/UA Home Video, which introduced "The Wizard of Oz" 
as its first home videocassette on Oct. 8, 1980, has issued an "Oz" anniversary 
edition, a brilliant Technicolor print in which the prologue and epilogue of 
the movie have been restored to the original sepia color instead of black and 
white. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA also has added almost 17 minutes of extra footage to the cassette at the 
movie's end, including a song by Buddy Ebsen, who originally played the Tin Man 
but was replaced by Jack Haley after suffering an allergic reaction to the Tin 
Man makeup and being hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
The cassettes cost $24.95, but there's a $5 rebate available. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Baum Book Auction 
</P>
<P>
Another group to join in Ozmania is San Francisco-based California Book Auction 
Galleries, which will sponsor a Los Angeles auction of "Oz" author L. Frank 
Baum books and what it calls other "Oziana," including original movie cards, 
ads, posters and sheet music. It will be Nov. 30 at 7:30 p.m. at the Hyatt 
Hotel on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Not to be overlooked, Turner Entertainment released a 16-page catalogue last 
week featuring all of the "Oz" products offered at the Turner Store in CNN 
Center, along with those from "Gone With the Wind." They can be purchased 
through the company's toll-free number, (800) 423-3200. 
</P>
<P>
Turner executives are expecting "millions and millions" to be generated from 
the "Oz" and "GWTW" product sales, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Included among Turner's more unusual "GWTW" products are "Scarlett's 
Chocolates," a one-half-pound box of chocolates with Scarlett O'Hara's portrait 
on the lid. It was created by Atlanta chocolatier Maggie Lyon, and sells for 
$14.95. For $8.95, there's also a limited edition replica of the original "Gone 
With the Wind" paper doll book done in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been getting orders from all over the country," said Shelly Charles, 
general manager of the Turner Store and director of tours for CNN Studios. 
"There are a lot of 'Oz' collectors, but people are getting fanatical about 
'Gone With the Wind.' I think it will be bigger than 'Oz' because this is the 
territory here. We're gearing up for Dec. 15 (the date the original film 
premiered in Atlanta). We have a huge celebration coming up -- a re-premiere of 
the film, tours to historic places, a ball, Scarlett and Rhett look-alike 
contests." 
</P>
<P>
To date, Turner Entertainment has licensed 25 firms to produce "GWTW" products, 
among them a restored print videocassette ($89.95); expensive ($175-$495) and 
inexpensive ($25.95) Scarlett, Rhett and Mammy dolls; books; T-shirts; musical 
pocket watches; cookie tins; puzzles; and "GWTW" perfume. Turner officials also 
commissioned artist LeRoy Neiman to create an official painting commemorating 
"GWTW's" anniversary. It will be used for the ad campaign promoting the new 
"GWTW" fragrance, "Miss Scarlett's Gone With the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
Can Scarlett bonnets be far behind? 
</P>
<P>
Probably not. Western Costume has five different models on a shelf in an 
upstairs millinery section.

INTERPRETER'S LIFE IN POLITICAL WATERS;

<P>
DIPLOMACY: A UNITED NATIONS OFFICIAL LOOKS BACK AT HIS PAST CAREER AS A 
TOP-LEVEL SOVIET TRANSLATOR.

<P>
It was the most dramatic clash of Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev's 
coast-to-coast tour: The mayor of Los Angeles stood up and informed the visitor 
that his people would never bury America, as the fiery Soviet leader had 
threatened to do. 
</P>
<P>
As a banquet audience gasped, Khrushchev tossed aside a prepared speech and 
ripped into Mayor Norris Poulson with a scathing reply. 
</P>
<P>
For young Viktor Sukhodrev, the interpreter, it was a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
"He started quoting Ukrainian proverbs, and I don't speak Ukrainian," Sukhodrev 
said in an interview during a break from his new job as a General Assembly 
official. "I still talk about it when I give lectures to young foreign service 
officers, telling them how you have to expect anything." 
</P>
<P>
Sukhodrev said Khrushchev was already irritated when the Soviet entourage 
arrived in Southern California just after noon on Sept. 19, 1959, because of 
Cold War regulations that had placed Disneyland off-limits to him. 
</P>
<P>
And he was further annoyed that the main event of the day was a visit to the 
set of "Can Can" at 20th Century Fox, rather than an inspection of an aerospace 
plant or some other more serious activity. 
</P>
<P>
When the group reached the Ambassador Hotel that evening and was greeted by a 
less-than-friendly Poulson, the premier turned purple. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking at Mrs. Khrushchev's interpreter, and all I could see was her 
eyes widening in horror," Sukhodrev said. "I can remember this proverb, 
something about, 'Your eyes have seen what you're buying but you can't swallow 
it,' and others that I really had to guess about. At one point, he turned to 
young Tupolev, the son of the aircraft designer, and asked how many hours it 
would take to fly back to Moscow, and I thought we were on the way, but 
somebody in the back of the room saved the day. 
</P>
<P>
"As Khrushchev was shouting that he had come to Los Angeles with his hand 
extended, a voice -- it must have been that of an emigre -- called out in 
perfect Russian, 'We take it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sukhodrev was picked as the junior partner to Oleg Troyanovsky, now the Soviet 
ambassador to Beijing, for the interpreting team to go along on the first U.S. 
visit by a Kremlin chief. 
</P>
<P>
He had entered the foreign service only three years before after graduating 
from the Moscow Foreign Languages Institute, and gone to work almost 
immediately for Andrei A. Gromyko, the poker-faced foreign minister who would 
be elevated to the presidency in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
His first assignment for Gromyko, Sukhodrev said, was to interpret at a meeting 
with Secretary of State John Foster Dulles. 
</P>
<P>
"I could hardly believe that I was in a room with the man we all regarded as 
the architect of the Cold War," he recalled. "He noticed me and said to Gromyko 
'You've got a new interpreter. You always had Troyanovsky.' Gromyko answered, 
'He's a good substitute,' so I knew that I had made the grade." 
</P>
<P>
The veteran interpreter -- his once jet-black hair now slightly gray -- later 
traveled with Leonid I. Brezhnev, and his final service for a Soviet head of 
government was with Mikhail S. Gorbachev last December for the meeting with 
President Reagan in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"That was my voice you heard when Gorbachev spoke on television," he said, 
shaking his head. "It was especially strange to hear myself on all the news 
broadcasts later. That was sort of a new experience for me." 
</P>
<P>
Other interpreters have long recognized Sukhodrev as a master of his craft, 
able to slip from British- to American-accented English and back without a 
slip. 
</P>
<P>
As reporters observed during his frequent appearances at the Geneva peace talks 
over the years, he polished his vocabulary and stayed current with slang 
through voracious reading of the Western press. 
</P>
<P>
It was not all learned in school, he confessed. 
</P>
<P>
As a youth, he accompanied his mother to London at the beginning of World War 
II. She worked with a Soviet trade mission there until 1945. Although he 
attended an embassy school, he played in the street with English children. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I can still hold my own with a London taxi driver," he said with a 
grin. 
</P>
<P>
Although Soviet diplomats have customarily displayed better language facility 
than Americans, Sukhodrev said, he believes U. S. diplomats have improved 
substantially in the more than three decades he has dealt with them. 
</P>
<P>
"In my first contacts with the embassy in Moscow in 1956, there were just a few 
who could barely manage to communicate," he said. "Now, any U.S. official whose 
job is to maintain contact with the government can speak Russian." 
</P>
<P>
In his new post at the United Nations, Sukhodrev works directly under Ronald 
Spiers, the undersecretary for political and General Assembly affairs, who 
until his retirement earlier this year was undersecretary of state for 
management. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a reflection of the new atmosphere between our countries that I think we 
work well together," he said of Spiers.

<P>
FUNCTIONAL ART COMBINES THE BEST OF BOTH CREATIVE WORLDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
You stare through the glass table top and see its metal legs spelling EAT. And 
you think, yes, this is the function of a dining room table. 
</P>
<P>
But then you examine the price tag and discover that this self-conscious piece 
of furniture is titled "The Crisis in Gourmet Marxism." 
</P>
<P>
Fearing indigestion, you move to a more conventional coffee table, titled 
"Anthesis I." Sleek, utilitarian, stoic -- just the design for serious 
business. But what's this drawer doing on its surface? Curious, you tug, and 
out slides a hidden compartment that's warm and sensual. Now you see another 
compartment, and another, and another, all different shapes and sizes and 
colors. By the time each drawer has swung out, the table has "flowered" into a 
garden of delights. 
</P>
<P>
But is it a table? Or is it art? 
</P>
<P>
Such confusion is by design at Santa Monica's Gallery of Functional Art, where 
director/owner Lois Lambert wages a one-woman crusade on behalf of work that's 
both functional and aesthetic. The two tables are part of a show titled "Table 
as Art -- Part II," which closes Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of resistance to the word 'functional art,' " Lambert said. "Is 
it art furniture? Is it fine art? Is it craft? Is it design? 
</P>
<P>
"There is a part of me that gets involved in underdogs. And functional art is 
the underdog of the art world. I'm trying to show people that this blend of 
fine art, craft and function is an authentic artistic expression." 
</P>
<P>
It's no accident that Lambert selected a quote from Paul Klee as the gallery's 
maxim: "There is bound to be some common ground between layman and artist, 
where a mutual approach is possible and whence the artist no longer appears as 
being totally apart." 
</P>
<P>
But Lambert's crusade has not been an easy one. Since opening in August, 1988, 
at the Frank Gehry-renovated Edgemar Mall on Main Street, she has struggled -- 
unsuccessfully for the most part -- to interest fine-art critics in reviewing 
her shows. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been awful trying to get art reviews," she said. "This town is very 
provincial and young as far as art is concerned. But here you can touch it and 
hold it and be part of it, and you can still have art. What more could you ask 
for?" 
</P>
<P>
But while fine-art critics don't flock to her gallery, the public seems to be 
interested. Functional Art's first exhibition, "Table as Art -- Part I," opened 
to a crowd of more than 2,000. A year and five shows later -- "Feast of 
Function," "Architects Art," "Environments," "Chair as Art," "Illuminations" -- 
Lambert reprised the table theme for her gallery's first birthday. More than 
3,000 people clamored to get into "Table as Art -- Part II" on opening day in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
Her airy, high-windowed, sunny corner space is crowded with tables that vary 
from the bluntly utilitarian to the barely functional. David Gale's "EAT" table 
($3,900) clashes in design next to conceptual artist Phil Garner's "Mechanics 
Table" ($350) -- a droll appropriation of an auto mechanic's "crawler," 
complete with car jacks. Titles are evocative -- consider Anne Kelly's "A World 
Within a Cube," Gales' "Without Snails There Is No Theory," John W. 
McNaughton's "L. A. Transit System." 
</P>
<P>
Eugenia Butler's "Moving Through Pancks Wall" -- a steel, tar and hay 
conglomeration resembling a farm door after an earthquake -- comes complete 
with a poetic description. "This piece is about magic and science and spiritual 
transformation," she writes. "To me it takes on the form of a prehistoric 
battery or perhaps a prototype for a machine of primitive and unknown origin. . 
. . I like the fact that by virtue of its 'artiness' it assumes the fiction of 
being incorporated into usability -- while maintaining its definite sculptural 
identity." 
</P>
<P>
Lambert's uphill battle for wider respectability hasn't hurt her sales. She 
admits that it's become trendy to own functional art. She recently sold 
$100,000 worth of objects for the sets of Arnold Schwarzenegger's next movie, 
"Total Recall." In addition, Lambert said, corporate investors are realizing 
that the gallery's one-of-a-kind or limited edition handmade furnishings are 
cheaper than Pacific Design Center manufactured lines. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a hard sell at first," Lambert said, "but it's becoming a lot easier 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Lambert grew up in Chicago, surrounded by a family of fine-art collectors. 
After studies at the Chicago Institute of Art, she moved to Los Angeles in 
1969. "There was one museum, no theater life and less music," she recalled. 
"Now all that's changed so dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
During the '70s, she worked on educational videos. In 1983, Lambert opened an 
academic lecture agency, but left four years ago. "Then I basically began 
looking for a business. If I wanted to be in the art world, that meant I wasn't 
going to be rich. I wanted to do functional art because, as I investigated it, 
it seemed to me there was an awful lot of incredible work that wasn't being 
represented." 
</P>
<P>
The only full-time functional art gallery in the country at that time was Art 
et Industrie in New York. Lambert knew that it had closed and opened three 
times during its 13-year existence, so a West Coast version would hardly be a 
safe business venture. For two years she investigated the field, interviewing 
artists, craftsmen and dealers. Finally, Lambert took a second mortgage on her 
home and searched for a space. 
</P>
<P>
She became the first tenant after the Santa Monica Museum of Art to move into 
Edgemar. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told that as I got more successful there would be clones," she said. 
"And it's starting to happen as stores are opening on (Main) street like 
Akropolis Now and Art Options. They're not galleries because they don't do 
shows. But it's really an enormous task. There's no funding in this country for 
art. There's not a lot of empathy for dealers in this country because there's 
been so much unscrupulous activity. It's not an easy road to take." 
</P>
<P>
Now, if Lambert can just get the critics to take her seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, some critics argue that all art is furniture," she said, sighing. "But 
that's a whole other argument."

THEATER NOTEBOOK: DIFFERENT WOMEN WITH THE SAME PROBLEM -- LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three upscale New Yorkers find love, lose love and keep love in John Patrick 
Shanley's friendship comedy, "Women of Manhattan," opening this weekend at the 
Tiffany Theatre in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"The women are all in their 30s, all from different backgrounds and all in 
different situations with men," said director Claudia A. Weitsman. "One is 
married; one begins a relationship during the course of the play; one has just 
ended a relationship as the play begins. It's about three people who have 
different ideas about what's supposed to happen in a relationship, what they 
want -- and how they all arrive at different places and still remain friends." 
</P>
<P>
Although Shanley has recently made a big name for himself in movies (he won an 
Oscar in 1988 for his screenplay of "Moonstruck"), his local play outings 
("Savage in Limbo," "Danny and the Deep Blue Sea") have been less plentiful 
than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Weitsman, 27, who's married to "Women" lighting designer Jim Blickensderfer, 
originally staged the play in its West Coast premiere last year at San Diego's 
Progressive Theatre Co. "I thought the piece had elements of doing well," she 
said of the remounting. "The author has a real name value here. The play's not 
been done on a professional level in Los Angeles. It has small, well-defined 
roles for the actors. It's short. My motto is, 'Small theater is good theater.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Here, the writer seems to agree. In his instruction notes, Shanley counsels, 
"This play is about finding and solving problems. For that reason, I think it 
would be best to do it in the spirit of simplicity and warmth." Weitsman said, 
"That not only tells me about the style and pursuing an overall look but gives 
the actors direction from the source. He also says, 'Please do be loving, 
natural and vulnerable, and a little rough around the edges.' So that's what 
we're trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Anton, Sharon Wyatt and Nicole Orth-Pallavicini play the ladies; Charles 
Salter and Malcolm Groome are the men in their lives. 
</P>
<P>

Hill's boasts a comedic, campy tone -- and the music of Verdi, Offenbach and 
Mozart.

Theater gets a healthy dose of slide show in Terry Dodd's "Dusk to Dawn at the 
Sunset," opening this weekend at Studio City's Theatre West. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of those family-drama kinds of things," said director Michelle 
Truffaut, "but the structure's real interesting. The story is told in flashback 
by the two kids, who are now in their late 20s, and they tell it through a lot 
of photographs. It was like shooting a movie to get all of those photographs, 
to get all the family history there. On stage you'll see the live dramatic 
part. . . . But all of the motivation will be happening through the 
photography." 
</P>
<P>
So audiences will have to listen and watch live actors -- and watch a slide 
show at the same time? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," the 42-year-old director said with a chuckle. "Hopefully, it won't be 
too confusing. The crux of the story is that these kids, Sharon and Barry, are 
raised at a real crucial time -- in the late '50s, early '60s. The mother, 
Dottie, is a real victim as far as being stuck in the house, having the 
responsibility of a family. But the father, Lonnie, is also a victim of that 
time, in that he needs and wants security, but he likes to run around on his 
wife." 
</P>
<P>
Although the San Francisco-born director grew up in a very different home 
environment, the era is extremely familiar. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I remember the '50s," she said. "I was little, but I was there. And my 
mother was a working woman. At the same time, the rest of my family -- aunts, 
uncles, everyone else -- was very traditional, conventional. And they were all 
miserable. Although my parents had a good relationship, my father was a wilder 
kind of guy. He had a gambling tendency. So I think to safeguard the family, my 
mother figured she'd better contribute as well. As a result of that, she kind 
of had her own life," selling real estate. 
</P>
<P>
It never occurred to Truffaut not to have a career, although for many years, it 
had nothing to do with the theater. 
</P>
<P>
College business courses led her to Gump's department store in San Francisco, 
where she worked in merchandising, interior design and buying. "Then one day I 
realized something was wrong. I wasn't quite happy. I'd always gone to theater, 
always gone to the movies. But I couldn't get up there myself. Honestly, I was 
so shy. But finally I went to an acting workshop -- and after three months of 
sitting in the back row and listening, I finally got up and started doing 
things." 
</P>
<P>
Bitten by the acting bug, Truffaut apprenticed at a small repertory company 
outside London, then resettled in New York, where she began doing Off- and 
Off-Off Broadway work. But it wasn't until 1972, while visiting the Bay Area 
over the holidays, that she was asked to direct a friend's play. "I said, 'I've 
never directed anything in my life.' They said, 'Come on, you can try. Please 
help us out.' So I did. And it was the first time I thought, 'Oh, I really like 
this.' " 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, she formed her own improvisational touring group. In 1976, it 
became incorporated as the San Francisco Repertory Company -- with Truffaut as 
artistic director. In that capacity, she won Bay Area Critics Circle Awards for 
her direction of "Mary Stuart" (1982) and "Blood Knot" (1983). In 1986-87, she 
headed up the San Francisco Summer Shakespeare Festival. "It was really 
stifling," she says now. "Too much. You don't get to do any individual 
exploring. You're too busy trying to figure out the whole picture." 
</P>
<P>
So when she was accepted to the American Film Institute's prestigious 
directors' program in 1987, Truffaut was ready for the move. Since packing up 
her dogs and cats and moving to Los Angeles, she's thrown herself into the film 
work. After a year of video projects, she's recently completed directing her 
first movie, "Ralph's Arm," an AFI-sponsored project she co-wrote with friend 
Bram Druckman. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bizarre kind of black comedy," Truffaut said, smiling. "What's going on 
with Ralph is that he's a concert pianist who's very, very stiff and will only 
think in terms of playing classical music. At a concert one night, his left arm 
rebels and starts screwing up -- and leaves." After hitching a ride with an 
upwardly mobile couple, the arm finds himself banished to their refrigerator, 
trying to fend off the attentions of a large dog. Ultimately, of course, Ralph 
rescues the arm and finally gives in to its yen to play jazz and blues. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of her new-found enthusiasm for film (she's planning to move here 
permanently), Truffaut has no intention of making a complete break from the 
theater world. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that I'd been missing it," she said. "I wasn't. And it wasn't like I 
sought this out. It was just an interesting project that was brought to me. Now 
that I'm doing it again -- yeah, I do kind of miss it. But it's so different 
directing film and stage. In theater, the actors really carry the show. Of 
course, the director's important -- pulling from the actors the best job he can 
get. But in film, you have so much more control. The conceptual thing is really 
sitting in the director's lap. And I have to admit I like that."

A candidate for presidency of Colombia canceled two campaign stops after a 
large bomb was found on a bridge hours before he was scheduled to cross it. 
Cesar Gaviria, one of three leading candidates, canceled stops in Cienaga and 
Fundacion after the dynamite bomb was found on the bridge between the two 
towns. Gaviria was campaign manager for Sen. Luis Carlos Galan until he was 
assassinated at the order of drug traffickers at a political rally on Aug. 18. 
Gaviria than decided to enter the race.

Voters in Gary, an economically depressed steel town, endorsed legalized 
gambling in hotel-casino facilities by 13,309 votes, or 60.4%, to 8,733 votes, 
or 39.6%, against. Only 32.3% of the registered voters cast ballots in the 
non-binding referendum. Despite the results, Gov. Evan Bayh said he will not 
support gambling in Gary. State legislators from Gary had promised to bring the 
issue to the 1990 session of the General Assembly if the referendum passed.

Business owners and residents of St. Croix protested President Bush's plan to 
withdraw 1,100 federal troops that were sent to the island to quell looting 
following Hurricane Hugo. The United Concerned Citizens of St. Croix said it 
joined the Chamber of Commerce and the Board of Realtors to lobby the White 
House and Pentagon urging Bush to rescind the order. The Defense Department has 
announced that troops would be withdrawn within 20 days. "We have no 
electricity and telephones and we want to be safe on the island," a full-page 
ad in the St. Croix Avis newspaper proclaimed.

COUNSELORS USE PERSUASIVE POWERS ON TRUANT YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THUAN LE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The three teen-agers sat on brown chairs in the locker room of the Glassell 
Park swimming pool. The hour was approaching noon on a school day. The youths 
were hungry and restless. But they had no choice but to wait. 
</P>
<P>
About 9 a.m. that day, Los Angeles police officers had brought in Margaret, 13, 
and Luisa, 14. About 11:30, police brought Tommy to the room. Tommy was already 
warming up his excuse. Those are not the students' real names. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going home," Tommy said, and the two girls giggled. The two counselors 
in the room glanced at each other knowingly. They had heard that one too many 
times. 
</P>
<P>
There was no escape. The youths were in for several hours of boredom and 
unwanted adult company, the consequence of being truant. 
</P>
<P>
That was the scene at one of the Los Angeles Unified School District's 11 
Operation Stay in School (OSIS) centers one recent morning. 
</P>
<P>
The OSIS centers serve as drop-off points for truants picked up on the streets 
by police officers who patrol in special "juvenile cars." The counselors use 
gentle persuasion along with their limited legal powers to try to turn young 
people away from truancy. 
</P>
<P>
Although California law requires children ages 6 to 17 to attend school, 
truancy itself is not a crime and students cannot be arrested merely for being 
out of school. However, the state Education Code allows school officials and 
police officers to keep truant students in custody during school hours until a 
parent or guardian can retrieve them. 
</P>
<P>
Those picked up in the Northeast area of the district are brought to the OSIS 
center in Glassell Park, which opens each fall in the pool house after the end 
of the swimming season. In its first week, beginning Oct. 16, the center 
processed 36 juveniles, counselor Karen Crowl said. 
</P>
<P>
The center is staffed by Crowl and an aide, Rudy Martinez, who have worked 
together since 1979, when the program was housed at the Highland Park pool. 
That building was damaged by fire in 1987, and the counselors moved to the 
Glassell Park Recreation Center at 3650 Verdugo Road. 
</P>
<P>
When truants are brought in, the counselors try to contact their parents to 
pick them up. If a parent cannot be reached, a counselor returns the student to 
school, Crowl said. The counselors also watch for signs of child abuse, which 
they report to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
While this day's students waited to be picked up or taken back to school, 
Martinez bantered with them. He asked each one general questions about what 
they were doing when they were picked up, how they get to school and where 
their parents work. Then Martinez began targeting more specific problems that 
the students' schools might have told him about, such as frequently missing 
classes, fighting or shoplifting. 
</P>
<P>
Out of earshot of the truants, Martinez said: "Most of them blame the school 
and not themselves when they get into trouble. I like to try to help the kids 
straighten themselves out." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Detective Doug Evans said police support the truancy program 
because, besides keeping students in class, it has helped reduce daylight crime 
near schools. 
</P>
<P>
Juveniles who habitually ditch school often look for opportunities to make 
trouble, and "anything taking them off the streets helps," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Glassell Park OSIS center, Crowl and Martinez watch 12 to 15 truants 
during an average day. Officers find the youths either by seeing them on the 
streets or by hearing reports of loud daytime "ditching parties" from 
complaining neighbors, Crowl said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have gotten 16 kids all at once from a ditching party," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith Park and the Glendale Galleria are among the hot spots for truant 
students to gather. During the 1988-89 school year, the Glassell Park center 
processed 952 truants, according to a Los Angeles school district spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the time, the parents don't realize the student's attendance is much 
worse than they think," Crowl said. 
</P>
<P>
Crowl said OSIS is most effective for youths who are not yet habitually truant. 
</P>
<P>
"For some kids, all it takes is to be picked up by the police that one time," 
Crowl said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 14,353 truants processed by the district's 11 centers during the 1988-89 
school year, only 3% were picked up more than once for being truant, said a 
spokeswoman for OSIS' downtown office. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the kids with parents less likely to come pick them up, " said Crowl, 
referring to those who are repeatedly truant. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret is one such "hard-core truant," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
When encountered at the Glassell Park center last month, it was the sixth time 
she had been picked up for truancy and the second time that she had been taken 
to Glassell Park. A phone call to Eagle Rock Junior High School revealed that 
she had not been in school for three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Margaret's mother calls her school to check up on her at the 
request of her school counselors, Margaret's attendance has not improved. "I 
never went last year," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret said her mother had scolded her for not going to school before but 
that she would run away if her mother tried to punish her. She and Luisa were 
given "opportunity transfers" from another school, meaning that they had been 
in trouble at their home school. 
</P>
<P>
When they were transferred to Eagle Rock, they had to sign an agreement saying 
they would attend school regularly and, if caught ditching, would be 
transferred to their former school, Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
For some youths, an opportunity transfer to another school is all they need to 
go straight, Crowl said. "A different atmosphere, a different crowd might do 
the trick," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Different schools have different ways of dealing with truants, she said. Irving 
Junior High School in Glassell Park will not allow truant youths to return 
until their parents come in to discuss the child's behavior. Other schools, 
such as Benjamin Franklin High School in Highland Park, hold the students in 
detention after school. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Avallone, an assistant principal at Franklin, said the school's attendance 
office requires the student to make up the class time that was missed by doing 
homework during after-school detention. In addition, the school insists that 
one of the student's parents come in for a conference with the dean.

PANEL VOIDS OUSTER OF AA GROUP; 
</P>
<P>
ZONING: NEIGHBORS OF THE STUDIO CITY MEETING HALL, GIVEN TO THE NORTH HOLLYWOOD 
CHAPTER IN 1947, PLAN TO APPEAL THE DECISION, WHICH LIMITS MEETING ATTENDANCE 
TO 100 PEOPLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Zoning Appeals agreed Saturday to allow a popular 
Alcoholics Anonymous chapter to remain at its Studio City meeting hall, 
overturning an earlier city decision and setting the stage for an appeal to the 
City Council by neighbors who say the AA meetings cause problems with parking, 
litter and noise. 
</P>
<P>
The zoning board voted unanimously to allow the North Hollywood chapter of 
Alcoholics Anonymous to continue meeting at the group's facility on Radford 
Avenue. But it imposed conditions that included limiting meetings to 100 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"This organization needs to be in this neighborhood," said James D. Leewong, 
zoning board chairman. "But we need to control it and limit it." 
</P>
<P>
Alcoholics Anonymous members meet regularly to socialize, talk over problems 
and teach newer members the AA method of alcoholism recovery, members said at 
the hearing. Total abstention from drugs and alcohol is the goal of AA members, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
Renee A. Gunter, president of the Grove Assn., the homeowners group that 
complained about the AA group, said her organization will appeal the zoning 
board's decision to the City Council. During the 4 1/2-hour hearing, Gunter and 
other neighbors told the board that the presence of the AA group held back 
property values in the upscale area. 
</P>
<P>
"We find ourselves up against the wall and can find no other recourse than to 
have them find another, larger facility," Gunter said at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Gunter showed board members several soda cans and beer bottles that she said 
were left by AA members going to and from the Radford Avenue meeting hall. 
</P>
<P>
AA members who testified at the hearing said they will continue to urge members 
to leave meetings quietly and not to litter or park illegally. 
</P>
<P>
Gail Gordon, an attorney representing the North Hollywood AA group, said the 
group's seven-member advisory board must vote on whether to accept the zoning 
board's conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"They are grateful that they can remain on the property," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the AA group said they are disappointed, however, that a limit of 
100 people was imposed. Attendance at the 90-minute meetings, scheduled twice 
daily during the week and at noon on Saturdays, usually is between 25 and 90 
people. 
</P>
<P>
But more than 100 attend a popular Monday night meeting, AA members said. But 
they said those inconvenienced by the Monday night limit will be asked to put 
the welfare of the meeting hall ahead of their own interests. 
</P>
<P>
"Our common welfare comes first," said AA member Don M., who, consistent with 
the organization's traditions, does not reveal his last name. "We have an 
opportunity to show that we can make it work." 
</P>
<P>
The zoning board decided to hold another public hearing a year after a decision 
is reached in the current dispute to determine whether neighborhood complaints 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is going to let AA off the hook," said board member Joseph D. Mandel. 
But he said forcing the group to move because of neighbors' complaints was like 
"throwing the baby out with the bathwater." 
</P>
<P>
In June a city zoning administrator gave the North Hollywood group one year to 
move from its property because it does not meet the area's residential zoning 
and parking requirements. The meetings are held in a former church, which was 
donated to the organization in 1947 and does not have a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
For years the city had allowed the meeting hall to remain because its use by 
the AA group predates city zoning laws, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
But the issue drew the attention of city officials last winter after neighbors 
complained that as many as 250 people attended evening meetings at the Radford 
Avenue meeting hall. Cars occupied most of the neighborhood's available street 
parking, and AA members tossed litter on lawns and sidewalks and were noisy on 
the way to and from the meetings, the neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the North Hollywood AA group and Los Angeles City Councilman 
Joel Wachs said Saturday that they are trying to arrange for the organization 
to use a nearby lot owned by CBS.

NEIGHBORS PICKET PROPOSED SITE OF MULTILEVEL OFFICE 
</P>

More than 200 noisy, sign-toting Sherman Oaks residents demonstrated Saturday 
against what they said was the silence of a developer who wants to build a 
retail and office project at Woodman Avenue and Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Jama Enterprises is seeking to build an 85,000-square-foot complex in the 13600 
block of Ventura Boulevard, which until earlier this year was occupied by such 
neighborhood institutions as the Scene of the Crime Bookstore and Mary's Lamb 
restaurant. The businesses were evicted to make way for what the residents 
characterize as a four-story glass monolith shaped like a battleship. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't feel the developer has been dealing with us in good faith," said 
Leonard Liebshard, a member of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. who helped 
organize the rally. "They've been silent from even before they announced the 
project to anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Jama Enterprises unveiled its plans in August, after months of uncertainty 
during which the longtime retail tenants were gradually evicted but did not 
know why. Since August, the residents say, the developer has neither kept them 
nor Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo, who represents the area, informed 
of its plans and has been unresponsive to complaints about the building's size, 
design and amount of parking. 
</P>
<P>
Judith McCurdy, head of a committee organized by homeowners to monitor the 
development, said: "Silence seems to be the way they do business, even with the 
city." 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin M. Reznik, an attorney representing the developer, denied the 
residents' claims Saturday. He said the rally was "clearly done to put some 
pressure on city officials" to order an environmental impact report on the 
project, "not . . . because the company has not been responsive." 
</P>
<P>
Reznik said he last met with homeowners Sept. 13 and since then has put an 
architect to work redesigning the structure "so it doesn't look like one 
structure." He also said the developer has altered the project to respond to 
residents' concerns over parking, security and traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The main dispute, however, is over the building's height. The residents say the 
proposed structure is four stories, two more than what would be allowed on the 
site under a proposed draft of a specific use plan for the area. However, 
Reznik said the structure is only three stories, but has an elevator shaft and 
a mechanical room on its roof. 
</P>
<P>
Woo and the homeowners are demanding that the developer conduct a thorough 
environmental impact review before being allowed to bulldoze the buildings to 
make way for the project. An attempt to get a demolition permit in July was 
blocked by Woo, but McCurdy said a permit to knock down a gas station that 
occupies the west corner of the block was secured recently. 
</P>
<P>
That demolition was set for Wednesday, but was also blocked by Woo. The gas 
station, the last business in the block that continued to operate, shut down 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
Reznik said he knew nothing about the permit to demolish the gas station. He 
speculated that it may have been obtained by the gasoline company that operated 
the station because it is obligated to remove fuel tanks and clean up the site. 
</P>
<P>
Reznik said the Los Angeles city attorney's office is reviewing Woo's demand 
that an environmental impact report be prepared before demolition permits are 
issued. He threatened to file a lawsuit against the city if demolition is 
blocked. 
</P>
<P>
"The homeowners are holding demolition permits hostage" to squeeze greater 
concessions out of Jama Enterprises, he said. "All requirements have been met 
for a demolition permit." 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners say that if the developer were allowed to build the structure as 
designed, its height would dominate the one-block stretch of Ventura Boulevard 
and cause unmanageable traffic problems. They say they would accept a 
scaled-down version. 
</P>
<P>
"This doesn't go with the neighborhood at all; it's all glass and four 
stories," said Sidonia Lax, who lives nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a neighborhood, and the stores need to reflect the needs of the 
neighborhood," said Marcy Kelly, who lives a block away. Along other stretches 
of Ventura Boulevard, she said, dry cleaners, hardware stores and markets have 
been replaced by offices and yogurt shops. 
</P>
<P>
"We want our local government to be as responsive to homeowners as they have 
been to developers," she said. "We're very concerned . . . that this area . . . 
not become another Westwood."

COURT APPROVES INGLEWOOD CENTER FOR MENTALLY ILL; 
</P>
<P>
MENTAL HEALTH: DIDI HIRSCH PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES PLANS TO START BUILDING 
IN-PATIENT FACILITY ACROSS THE STREET FROM CENTINELA HOSPITAL MEDICAL CENTER, 
WHICH HAS OPPOSED PROJECT AND PLANS TO APPEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A Superior Court has granted Didi Hirsch Psychiatric Services the go-ahead to 
build a 14-bed psychiatric treatment facility in Inglewood across the street 
from Centinela Hospital Medical Center, which had attempted to block the 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
In a ruling Thursday, Superior Court Judge Kurt J. Lewin criticized the 
hospital for showing an irrational fear of the mentally ill in trying to move 
the residential facility out of its back yard. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Didi Hirsch said construction will begin as soon as possible, 
whereas an appeal was promised by Centinela Hospital, one of Inglewood's 
largest employers and most politically powerful institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's satisfying that the white hats win sometimes," said Dr. Ellen Brand, 
executive director of Didi Hirsch. "This is a not-in-my-back-yard syndrome. I 
can understand that in citizens who are not educated about mental illness. For 
a major health-care facility to so stigmatize the mentally ill is 
unconscionable." 
</P>
<P>
The city of Inglewood had supported Hirsch, saying state law prohibited 
discrimination against mental health facilities. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Howard Rosten said he's happy the dispute is behind him. "We never 
thought it had any merit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital fought to stop Didi Hirsch, which runs several such facilities, 
from opening the in-patient treatment center at 1011 Myrtle Ave. in a 
residential area across from the Centinela medical complex. The site is zoned 
for medical use. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, the city's Planning and Development Commission granted the 
clinic a special-use permit to build a crisis residential treatment facility, 
which would offer up to two weeks of treatment for mental patients. 
</P>
<P>
Centinela filed an appeal, however, and asked the City Council to revoke the 
permit, charging that patients at the unlocked residence would pose a danger to 
its clients, staff and neighbors. Centinela President Russell Stromberg had 
compared the situation to "putting a match stick next to a can of gasoline." 
</P>
<P>
The council unanimously approved the facility in February, arguing that state 
law prohibits discrimination against the mentally ill in the approval of 
health-care facilities in areas zoned for medical uses. Centinela quickly filed 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
"What you have here is two different types of facilities and the interaction 
could be detrimental to the public," said Eric Tuckman, the hospital's vice 
president and legal counsel. "Maybe in another location the facility will live 
happily ever after." 
</P>
<P>
Tuckman said Centinela does not oppose the psychiatric center in general and 
has been active in assisting Didi Hirsch in finding an alternative site. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital's lawsuit against Didi Hirsch and the city charged that council 
members disregarded the danger the facility could pose for the neighborhood, a 
consideration required by the California Environmental Quality Act and that 
they violated the Brown Act by meeting in closed sessions to consider the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The judge dismissed those claims and said the state Legislature has enacted law 
to prevent "irrational fear of and aversion to the mentally ill." The court 
said Centinela wanted to "place the psychiatric facility in someone else's back 
yard." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Garland Hardeman, who represents the district that includes 
Centinela and the proposed facility, said Friday that he would have voted 
against the facility if he had been on the council at the time. 
</P>
<P>
But now that the court has ruled, Hardeman said, "I will do everything in my 
power to make sure that the facility is as safe as possible and any problems 
are alleviated." 
</P>
<P>
Brand accused Centinela of fomenting discrimination against the mentally ill 
with misinformation. Didi Hirsch operates similar treatment centers in 
Inglewood, Redondo Beach, Cerritos and West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Mentally ill people who are in these programs are probably the best neighbors 
you will have anywhere," she said.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: JUNIOR HIGH STUDENTS LEARN THE THREE RS: RESTRAINT, 
RESPONSIBILITY AND RESPECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Anti-drug crusader Montel Williams joked and laughed with 550 San Pedro 
students last week -- and gave them a new set of the three Rs while imploring 
them to stay away from drugs. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to reading, 'riting and 'rithmetic, Williams told the ninth-graders 
at Dodson Junior High School to learn restraint, responsibility and respect. 
</P>
<P>
"You better learn respect right now for yourself," Williams exhorted the 
students. "If you start respecting yourself -- guess what -- maybe other people 
will respect you." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who came to the school under the sponsorship of Pepsi-Cola to spread 
an anti-drug, improve-yourself message, immediately grabbed the students' 
attention when he walked down the center aisle, and he never let their 
attention stray. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in black, his head shaved, Williams used sarcasm and street talk from a 
persuasive bag of speaking tricks. He pranced all around the auditorium. He 
mugged, pleaded and screamed. 
</P>
<P>
Williams told the boys they were not men just because "God gifted you with the 
equipment to make a baby," and he urged the girls to have self-esteem: Don't be 
fooled into spending time with a man "for a piece of plastic, a meal and a 
ride." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 33, also told the students not to become high school dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
Without an education, he said, their job future would be bleak. "Hi, welcome to 
McDonald's," Williams mimicked. "Can I take your order?" 
</P>
<P>
Pepsi-Cola Co. Los Angeles paid $3,000 for Williams' 90-minute visit. The money 
will go to his Denver-based nonprofit organization called Reach the American 
Dream, which he founded in 1988 to motivate youngsters to stay in school and 
avoid drugs. Williams, who said he receives 12% of the honorariums for his 
appearances, has talked to an estimated 1.5 million students across the country 
since January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Williams said he used drugs "at a time when everyone was doing 
drugs" but realized their danger when he saw what 11 years of heroin did to his 
cousin. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, a lieutenant in the Navy Reserve, was invited to speak at Dodson by 
Ralph Mays, coordinator of the Long Beach Naval Station's Personal Excellence 
Program. It adopted Dodson in 1988 as part of a nationwide outreach effort, 
which involves the Navy with local community and youth organizations and 
emphasizes academics, health and fitness. 
</P>
<P>
In his presentation, Williams frequently shouted, "Mountain, get out of my 
way," a reference to the biblical declaration that faith can move mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"What that means to me," Williams told the students, "is it doesn't matter if 
you think you have some little obstacle. . . . If that obstacle seems to be as 
big as a mountaintop, all you have to do is" move it with education and 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"To prove to you all that education and knowledge pay . . . who can tell me 
what event got this country into World War II and what event ended the war?" 
</P>
<P>
"The bombing of Pearl Harbor," answered Oscar Short. "The bombing of Japan," 
answered Randy Coryell. 
</P>
<P>
Their rewards? A $10 bill each. 
</P>
<P>
"They got $1 per second for just what they know," Williams told their 
classmates. 
</P>
<P>
Williams also staged a skit to illustrate the seriousness of the nation's drug 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Four Dodson ninth-graders -- Christina Wade, Ginger Anderson, William Fell and 
Glenn Angeles, pretended to buy $55.15 worth of drugs from a drug dealer named 
Dr. Feelgood, played by Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"I got something for your $55 that I keep in my pocket," Williams suddenly 
declared as he fired a cap gun, pretending to kill the youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
The gunfire seemed to startle the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't do this because I wanted you guys to get a big kick out of this pop 
gun," Williams admonished the crowd. "This is happening all over L.A. . . . It 
isn't so funny, and it won't be so funny when you wind up like this." 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles Unified School District, 27% of 760 expulsions last year 
were drug-related, said Ruth Rich, health education specialist for the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Rich said the district received $2.5 million last year to fund its anti-drug 
programs, including DARE, in elementary schools and Project Impact for older 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' presentation had some effect. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned the three Rs: restraint, responsibility and respect," Jason (Spud) 
Kayen said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Zamudio added: "I learned to say no to drugs." Alisa Samuels

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER RESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After more than 10 years with the city, the assistant city manager and 
community resources director of Hermosa Beach has announced she is looking for 
a new job and will resign in January to "look for bigger and better things." 
</P>
<P>
Alana Mastrian-Handman, 44, who had complained in May that doing both jobs was 
too stressful, cited personal reasons for the resignation. She added that news 
reports linking her decision to a recently discovered fee-collection error were 
inaccurate. The resignation, she said, had absolutely nothing to do with the 
error, which she made in 1987 while she was filling in as city manager. 
</P>
<P>
The mistake was a failure to have the city collect a $200 increase in fees 
assessed to movie companies filming in the city. The error cost the city about 
$10,000 and wasn't caught until last month. Although City Manager Kevin 
Northcraft called it "unfortunate, but not earth shattering," it was seized 
upon as an issue in the current City Council election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been thinking about this for the last six months. I've been here 10 
years, and I was getting tired of the routine," she said. "I was putting in 12 
to 14 hours a day on average, and then I got married a year and a half ago, and 
I decided I had to start balancing things out."

MORE DOCTORS SHUN MEDI-CAL FOR PRENATAL CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of Orange County doctors willing to accept Medi-Cal coverage of 
expectant mothers has decreased at a time when concern is growing over infant 
mortality, according to a new study. 
</P>
<P>
Warnings about the need to reverse that trend were included in the March of 
Dimes study, which area health specialists said offers perhaps the most 
comprehensive assessment to date of the increasingly visible problem of 
prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
Despite clear evidence that medical attention in the early stages of pregnancy 
reduces the risk of low birth weight and unhealthy infants, the study found 
that about 12% of Latino mothers and 15% of teen-agers get little or no 
prenatal care, making them the two highest-risk groups. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, about 7% of the 38,730 county women who gave birth in 1987 received 
inadequate prenatal care, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing a wider schism than ever before between those who are able to 
receive care and those who aren't, and the message is that we need to get the 
community excited about making mothers and babies a priority," said Dorothy 
Andrews of the Orange County branch of the March of Dimes Birth Defects 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
She oversaw the study, completed last month. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of prenatal care among poor women was highlighted by UCI Medical 
Center's policy of diverting to other medical facilities women in labor who 
have not been treated previously at UCI. The diversion policy goes into effect 
only when the emergency room and maternity ward are full. 
</P>
<P>
The study's findings on the increasing strain created by indigent women on the 
health system "vindicates us," said Dr. Thomas Garite, head of the medical 
center's obstetrics and gynecology department. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first implemented our policy, we were looked upon as the perpetrator," 
he said. "But more and more lately -- and this study shows it -- we're being 
seen as the victim of a system that concentrates its indigent care on one 
hospital. We are not a county hospital." 
</P>
<P>
The study, several months in the making, concluded that public and private 
campaigns against infant mortality and health problems should focus on the 
poor, minorities, youths and substance abusers -- groups that have received 
inadequate care consistently in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Research has shown that babies born to mothers with no prenatal care are four 
times more likely to die at birth than those who received first-trimester care. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the problem locally, health experts said, is the increasing strain 
on the state's public health insurance program and government-sponsored 
programs for poor mothers. 
</P>
<P>
The March of Dimes study found that since 1985 the number of private doctors in 
the perinatal field -- those providing service about the time of delivery -- 
who accepted Medi-Cal coverage -- decreased from 64 to 52. 
</P>
<P>
The decrease portends "an especially critical situation," the study said, 
because recent income changes in the state plan mean that more women can get 
public aid. 
</P>
<P>
But the change "will make no difference" if a woman eligible for Medi-Cal 
"cannot find a provider who will accept her insurance," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
While the county provides prenatal care for poor women at four locations and 
offers additional referrals, it has no system to provide for actual delivery 
services, so women must make their own arrangements, the report noted. 
</P>
<P>
"Because most of these women are low income, speak only Spanish and face severe 
financial and cultural barriers, arrangements for delivery prior to the onset 
of labor are rarely made," the report found. 
</P>
<P>
"Women usually wait until they go into labor and then proceed to a hospital 
emergency room, with the hope of finding one that will accept laboring patients 
for delivery." 
</P>
<P>
The study found that although Latino women account for just 35% of total births 
in the county, they make up 61% of the births to mothers who received 
inadequate prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
Marianne Maxwell, who heads the county's newly formed task force on perinatal 
care, said: "This is the first full report we have at this point and the most 
current, and it's certainly going to be vital information for us in our 
studies."

A 'ROOKIE,' ROBINSON, BEATS LAKERS; 
</P>
<P>
SPURS: EX-MIDSHIPMAN SCORES 23 POINTS AND GRABS 17 REBOUNDS IN HIS NBA DEBUT AS 
SAN ANTONIO WINS, 106-98, TO EVEN L.A.'S RECORD AT 1-1. 
</P>

<P>
SAN ANTONIO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They are claiming here that David Robinson, the Spur of the moment and the 
franchise's future, is a rookie and, as such, mostly unaware of the demands of 
NBA play. Magic Johnson does not believe it, not after what he saw Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to say he's a rookie," Johnson said. "He's a man already, you know. 
Some guys just aren't ever rookies." 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio's celebrated 7-foot-1 center, finally making his professional debut 
after a two-year naval commitment, was more than just eager to start his 
career. That was obvious by the way he played. Robinson, the first overall 
selection in the 1987 draft, had 23 points and 17 rebounds to help the Spurs 
score a 106-98 victory over the Lakers before 15,868 fans at Hemisfair Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson did not disappoint those who already have anointed him as the NBA's 
next great center. He is menacing and confident, casting a looming presence in 
the middle, and has all the skills to match his demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
The funny thing is, Robinson said he does not feel as if he's a rookie, either. 
Spending two years shuffling papers, or whatever his naval commission involved, 
apparently gave him a lot of time to prepare mentally for this night. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I've been around forever," Robinson said. "I definitely don't 
think of myself as a rookie. I've got a lot of confidence in what I can do. I 
don't get nervous or anything. It was good just to kind of get it over with." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, who were outplayed in almost every aspect of the game but still 
avoided being blown out one night after beating Dallas, could relate to that 
emotion. Suitably impressed, they seemed relieved that they only have to face 
Robinson and the Spurs three more times in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
"(Robinson) is simply a great player," said Laker Coach Pat Riley, more 
impressed by the Spurs than disturbed by the Lakers' play. "He's a presence, 
offensively -- running, getting the second shots. They truly have a significant 
center." 
</P>
<P>
This is not all the Spurs have, however, which is sobering news to the rest of 
the Western Conference. As impressive as Robinson was, one thing he cannot do 
is win games single-handedly. Saturday, he did not have to. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Terry Cummings, the former Milwaukee Buck, had 22 points and 12 
rebounds; small forward Sean Elliott, a true rookie, had 16 points in his pro 
debut, and former Philadelphia 76er point guard Maurice Cheeks added 14 points 
and was a steadying influence on offense. 
</P>
<P>
With Robinson, the erstwhile midshipman, in the middle and a flotilla of talent 
for a convoy, the Spurs figure to be a threat in the Western Conference. 
Saturday, they dominated a Laker team playing its second road game in as many 
nights but not showing any ill effects. 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs, taller and -- on this night, at least -- quicker than the Lakers, 
simply beat them. San Antonio outrebounded the Lakers, 58-39; forced the Lakers 
out of their offense and into a succession of perimeter shots, and had a 58-30 
edge in inside scoring. 
</P>
<P>
It might have been just a bad night for the Lakers and a good one for the 
Spurs. After all, San Antonio beat the Lakers by 15 points in their opener last 
season, then won only 20 more games all season. 
</P>
<P>
This, however, is a drastically revamped and replenished Spur lineup. Cummings, 
Elliott and Cheeks are all new, but the franchise-altering addition was 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
He scored his -- and the Spurs' -- first basket 2:02 into the game with a 
savage reverse slam dunk off a pass from Cummings. More dunks and low-post 
moves and converted free throws followed as Robinson easily handled adversaries 
Mychal Thompson, Vlade Divac or any other Laker who tried to help. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of Robinson's 17 rebounds were on the offensive end, as the Spurs had as 
much as a 13-point fourth-quarter lead with such rebounding aggressiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's defense, which he calls a weakness, helped keep the Lakers out of 
the low post -- not that Robinson wasn't challenged. Most of the time, he did 
not back down. 
</P>
<P>
"Defensively, I'm not where I want to be," Robinson said. "I haven't blocked 
shots the way I'm capable of, but it'll come along." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson had only one blocked shot Saturday, but it was significant. 
</P>
<P>
It came with 1:56 left in the third quarter during a 9-0 Laker run that cut the 
Spurs' lead to 72-70. Cummings had missed a jump shot, and the Lakers initiated 
a fast break. Byron Scott beat his defender and headed in for the layup. 
Robinson was waiting and swatted the ball away. The Lakers never got that close 
to catching the Spurs again. 
</P>
<P>
"They were driving in, and I had to make sure they didn't get through (without 
being punished)," Robinson said. "I think we earned the Lakers' respect tonight 
with our defense." 
</P>
<P>
This being only the second game of a long season, Riley praised his team's 
effort and defensive play, but not much else. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers shot only 38.4%. They received only nine points from the bench, 
Michael Cooper making two of 10 shots. They also had a combined total of 16 
points and 10 rebounds from Thompson and power forward A.C. Green. The scoring 
load was limited to James Worthy, who had 25 points, and Johnson and Scott, 
each of whom had 24. 
</P>
<P>
"They flattened our offense out with their pressure," Riley said. "Plus, we 
didn't shoot well and got hammered on the boards. Our running game was 
nonexistent. Running comes off rebounding, and their speed also neutralized our 
running. We need five guys rebounding all the time. We know that." 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs also know that a season-opening victory over the Lakers does not 
assure subsequent success. Robinson was not around last season when the Spurs 
beat the Lakers in the opener, but he kept tabs. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that," Robinson said, laughing. "It was kind of one of those feelings, 
like I don't know whether we should win this one because of last year. But no, 
of course, we want to win 'em all."

NFL THE HALFWAY POINT; 
</P>
<P>
STEELERS BOUNCE BACK TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG GARBER, HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After the Pittsburgh Steelers lost their first two games of the season by a 
combined score of 92-10, the fans and media savaged the team and suggested the 
NFL had passed Coach Chuck Noll by. Six weeks later, at the midpoint of the 
regular season, the Steelers are 4-4 and one of six AFC teams in line for the 
AFC's second wild-card berth. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Walter Andrew (Bubby) Brister III is not all that surprised. But 
he's probably the only one. 
</P>
<P>
"I said a long time ago if at the midway point we were 4-4 we'd have a good 
chance to win nine or 10 games and make the playoffs," Brister says. "We 
probably still have some non-believers in (the media), but we believe in our 
locker room." 
</P>
<P>
After facing six 1988 playoff teams in the first seven games, the Steelers see 
two over the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers aren't the only story of note at mid-season. There is finally a 
new commissioner and the league can address the labor dispute, drug testing and 
a new TV contract. Here's the on-the-field halftime report: 
</P>
<P>
The good: The New York Giants and San Francisco 49ers, winners of two of the 
past three Super Bowls, each has a league-best 7-1 record. None of the teams 
who have won Super Bowls in the 1980s have a losing record. 
</P>
<P>
The bad: The Chicago Bears and Los Angeles Rams -- each 5-3 -- got off to 
terrific starts, then went down in flames with matching three-game losing 
streaks. 
</P>
<P>
The ugly: The Dallas Cowboys are halfway to an 0-16 season. Coach Jimmy 
Johnson, who lost four games in his past four seasons at the University of 
Miami, has been walking the sideline with glazed eyes. Unfortunately, Dallas 
(along with Seattle) has the toughest second-half schedule in the league; 
opponents are a combined 40-24. Fortunately, Dallas has six of the 1990 draft's 
first 81 picks. 
</P>
<P>
Amazingly, the 1-7 New York Jets have Coach Joe Walton under contract through 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
Where did he come from? Why, Azusa Pacific, of course. We're talking about 
Kansas City running back Christian Okoye, the "Nigerian Nightmare." The 
253-pound former sprinter (yes, it sounds incongruous) has carried 177 times 
for a league-high 810 yards. The last time a running back from that franchise 
won the league rushing title was in 1960, when Abner Haynes gained 875 yards 
for the AFL Dallas Texans. 
</P>
<P>
What's their line? The Phoenix Cardinals, who have lost 14 starters for at 
least one game, played four defensive ends on their line at one point in last 
week's game in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Still the franchise: After Philadelphia quarterback Randall Cunningham produced 
73 percent of the Eagles offense a year ago, Coach Buddy Ryan promised he would 
be better supported this season. Cunningham, who is headed toward his third 
consecutive team rushing title, has contributed 78 percent of Philadelphia's 
2,693 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
Thirtysomething-else: Phoenix wide receiver J.T. Smith, 34, and former 
Cardinals teammate Ottis Anderson, who turns 32 in two weeks, are making a case 
for a senior football circuit. Smith has 60 catches for 759 yards and five 
touchdowns and is on pace to destroy Art Monk's league record of 106 in a 
single season. Anderson has carried 179 times for 609 yards and seven 
touchdowns for the Giants -- and is on pace to break the Guinness modern record 
for time in a whirlpool. 
</P>
<P>
Silver stench: The Detroit Lions' Silver Stretch offense has merely stretched 
the credibility of offensive coach Mouse Davis. In eight games the Stretch has 
produced three touchdown passes, 16 interceptions and 34 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco treat: 49ers wide receiver Jerry Rice has caught 42 passes 
for 869 yards (20.7 average) and nine touchdowns. In fewer than five seasons he 
has caught 58 touchdown passes in 55 starts. 
</P>
<P>
Umm, umm, bad: Atlanta Coach Marion Campbell, who has presided over a 2-6 first 
half, has a 33-77-1 career record in the NFL. He is expected to retire at the 
end of the season when his contract runs out. 
</P>
<P>
Youth is served: Minus Harry Carson, George Martin, Kenny Hill, Jim Burt, the 
Giants defense has improved dramatically, compared with the first half of 1988. 
Points allowed: 109 vs. 168; passing yards: 1,591 vs. 1,900; interceptions: 13 
vs. 7; touchdown passes allowed: 8 vs. 15; first downs: 131 vs. 163. 
</P>
<P>
Onward and upward: Last season Tampa Bay quarterback Vinny Testaverde threw an 
NFC-record 35 interceptions. Can he throw the 26 he needs in his last eight 
games to break that mark? 
</P>
<P>
Sudden impact: The following rookies are among the top three tacklers for their 
teams: Denver safety Steve Atwater (71, first), Phoenix linebacker Eric Hill 
(46, second), New Orleans cornerback Robert Massey (39, second), Giants safety 
Myron Guyton (50, third). There are a handful of Rookie of the Year candidates: 
Detroit running back Barry Sanders (112 carries, 597 yards); Atlanta wide 
receiver Shawn Collins (29 catches, 457 yards); Indianapolis wideout Andre 
Rison (25 catches, 353 yards); Giants running back Dave Meggett (9.5-yard 
punt-return average, 14 catches, 246 yards); Atlanta cornerback Deion Sanders 
(three interceptions, 11.7 punt-return average). 
</P>
<P>
Fresh wheels: Herschel Walker has carried 50 times since being traded to 
Minnesota and gained 305 yards in three games. It took Walker five games and 81 
rushes to gain 246 yards in Dallas. Redskins' Gerald Riggs has carried 154 
times for 658 yards since arriving in Washington, although he has lost three 
fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
Magik man: Green Bay quarterback Don Majkowski, the 10th-round pick out of 
Virginia in 1987, has completed 171 of 280 passes for a staggering 2,303 yards. 
His quarterback rating of 88.4 is surpassed only by San Francisco's Joe 
Montana, Bobby Hebert of the Saints, Houston's Warren Moon, Cincinnati's Boomer 
Esiason and Buffalo's Jim Kelly. Green Bay's offense, ranked 24th last year, is 
No.2. 
</P>
<P>
Miscellaneous: Buffalo running back Thurman Thomas has an outside chance to 
match the 1985 feat of San Francisco's Roger Craig by clearing 1,000 yards for 
both running and receiving. So far Thomas has rushed 113 times for 502 yards 
and caught 33 passes for 379 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Rams' wide receiver Willie Anderson is averaging 31.7 yards on 15 catches. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Mike Merriweather, the Vikings' other trade acquisition, has 54 
tackles, third on the team, plus four forced fumbles, three interceptions and 
2.5 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
Massive turnover: Detroit has a minus-21 turnover net; the Lions have lost 31 
balls so far. 
</P>
<P>
Houston leads the NFL with 76 penalties, worth 599 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers have completed an amazing 70 percent of their passes.

Todd Marinovich threw for three first-half touchdowns as ninth-ranked USC 
rolled to a 48-6 victory over Oregon State on Saturday and took clear command 
of the Pacific 10 title race. 
</P>
<P>
The win put the Trojans at 7-2 overall and 5-0 in the conference as they 
contend for their third consecutive Rose Bowl berth. 
</P>
<P>
No other Pac-10 team has fewer than two conference losses. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State, beaten by Southern Cal for the 18th consecutive time, came into 
the game third with a 3-1-1 mark. Their second Pac-10 loss dropped them to 
4-4-1 overall. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans, who have won 18 straight Pac-10 games and have Arizona and UCLA 
remaining on their schedule, got more breathing room Saturday when Arizona, 
second in the Pac-10 with a 4-1 record, was upset 29-28 by Cal. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich helped stake the Trojans to a 34-0 halftime lead against the 
overmatched Beavers, then yielded to backup Shane Foley at 3:47 into the third 
period with Southern Cal ahead 41-0. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich, a redshirt freshman who ranks ninth on the Trojans' all-time 
completions list after just nine games, completed 14 of 18 for 226 yards in the 
romp. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Cal dominated the Beavers in virtually every department. Ricky Ervins 
led the Trojan rushers with 110 yards on 20 carries and scored three times on 
runs of 17 yards, 7 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
On the 7-yard score, he picked up a Marinovich fumble on the first bounce and 
bulled his way into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Ervins also was perfect on one passing attempt. He took a pitch from 
Marinovich, pulled up and completed a 33-yarder back to the quarterback to help 
set up the second touchdown for the Trojans, who scored the first three times 
they had the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich's touchdowns came on throws of 57 yards to John Jackson, 31 to Gary 
Wellman and 17 to Joel Scott. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans' defense completely overpowered the Beavers, with linebacker Junior 
Seau leading the charge with 3 1/2 sacks, giving him 13 1/2 this season to 
break the school record of 13 set by Jack Del Rio in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State's lone score came on a 14-yard pass from Matt Booher to Maurice 
Wilson 47 seconds into the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Booher was 24 of 32 for 216 yards with two interceptions.

MORNING BRIEFING: WILLIAMS KNOWS A LOT ABOUT RUNNING TO -- AND FOR -- OFFICE

<TEXT>
<P>
Reggie Williams burns with envy every time he sees Bo Jackson's television 
commercial. 
</P>
<P>
Bo may know a lot of things, Williams admits, but at least he's not doing them 
all simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, on the other hand, is doing two things at once: trying to hold onto 
his job as starting outside linebacker with the Cincinnati Bengals while at the 
same time campaigning to remain a member of the city's City Council in 
Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo at least gets to separate them," says Williams, a 14-year NFL veteran 
closing out his career this year with the Bengals, and a council member since 
last year. "He doesn't have to run from the football field to the baseball 
field. I'm doing both at the same time."

The pedestrian was treated at a hospital and released. The two combatants, Jim 
Lawrence, 26, and Bradley Sayeau, 23, were hospitalized with serious injuries 
after the 30-foot fall. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a freak accident," Ontario Provincial Police spokesman Rick Sapinski 
said, before stating the obvious: "It was absolutely unintentional."

KINGS' SLIDE ON ICE CONTINUES AGAINST WHALERS, 6-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY DODDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HARTFORD, Conn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kevin Dineen, the talented, young Hartford Whaler who has been slumping since 
last season, looked nothing less than brilliant Saturday night as he broke out 
with not just his first goal but two more after that for a hat trick in a 6-3 
victory over the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Noting the crowd of 15,535 at the Civic Center -- the first sellout of the 
season and, with some newly constructed seating areas the Whalers' biggest 
crowd in history -- Dineen said: "Let's face it, the (Kings) brought the fans 
in tonight, but maybe now we'll start winning some fans back. It's getting 
colder out there. It's hockey season. Maybe I'll start getting hot." 
</P>
<P>
And Whaler teammate Scott Young said: "I know (Wayne) Gretzky fires up his own 
team, but he also fires up the guys he plays against, too. We were excited to 
play against him. Especially the younger guys. I was all fired up. Gretzky gets 
you going." 
</P>
<P>
Considering the Kings' dismal effort, it was generous of the Whalers to be 
speaking of Los Angeles and its leader in such respectful tones. 
</P>
<P>
Without laughing. 
</P>
<P>
It got so bad Saturday night that the game ended with the Kings skating with 
three players to the Whalers' five as a result of a slashing call against 
goalie Kelly Hrudey followed by a roughing call against Hrudey. Followed by -- 
after the final buzzer -- a 10-minute misconduct against Gretzky for throwing 
his stick and a 10-minute game misconduct for whatever he had to say about it. 
</P>
<P>
With all the fights, the game dragged on, and the Kings ended with a total of 
87 penalty minutes, more than double their previous high this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings were assessed three bench minor penalties, two for too many players 
on the ice and one because Bernie Nicholls refused to go directly to the 
penalty box after a high-sticking call. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings dropped under .500 for the first time since the spring of 1988, and 
the Whalers went over .500 for the first time since January of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings will take a 7-8-0 record into Buffalo for a game tonight against the 
Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
The loss to the Whalers was downright embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of all that venting of frustration, the Kings were outshot, 33-23, 
and went one for eight on the power play while giving up four power-play goals 
on 11 chances. 
</P>
<P>
King Coach Tom Webster said: "We're all getting to the (frustration) point 
right now with the way we've been playing. It certainly hasn't been fun . . . 
It just gets more frustrating each day . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The difference in tonight's game was the specialty units. They capitalized on 
our power play. They're strong, they go to the front of the net, they get their 
shots through. We're on the outside getting shots, but then we've got nobody to 
pick up any rebounds. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"You can see what happened at the end of the game. You take unnecessary 
penalties and you do things out of character." 
</P>
<P>
Webster was sitting with his coaches in a quiet room adjacent to a quiet room 
full of Kings after the game. He said he really hadn't said much to the team. 
</P>
<P>
"There's only so many times you can yell. There's only so much you can do as a 
coach. . . . This is not the time to look at everyone else. Look at yourself. 
If you're a goal scorer, score goals. If you're a banger, bang. If you're a 
grinder, grind. Do what got you here." 
</P>
<P>
Which is exactly what Dineen finally did. 
</P>
<P>
Dineen had missed the first five games of the season with back spasms and a 
subsequent adverse reaction to medication. He had been back for 10 games, in 
which he had just six assists. 
</P>
<P>
He was concerned that Whaler fans would think that he was being complacent 
after signing a four-year contract for $500,000 a year. Dineen didn't want 
anyone saying that he was taking the money and sitting back. 
</P>
<P>
Well, they won't be saying that now. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old right winger, who led the Whalers in scoring last year, found 
the form he had before trailing off toward the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Dineen's first goal was his first in 10 games dating to last season, a season 
in which he had 45 goals and 89 points to lead the Adams Division. 
</P>
<P>
Dineen also led his team in power-play goals last season with 20. Against the 
Kings, he had two power-play goals. Dineen and Young had given the Whalers a 
2-0 lead before Nicholls scored off a pass from Gretzky in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Duchesne tied it off a pass from Nicholls early in the second period on 
the Kings' only power play. But Dineen's second-power play goal, after a 
tripping call on Duchesne, put the Whalers up again. 
</P>
<P>
John Tonelli gave the Kings their final goal at 12:51 of the second period, 
falling to his knees in the slot as he fired the shot past goaltender Peter 
Sidorkiewicz. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't so bad when Pat Verbeek scored to give the Whalers a one-goal lead 
less than a minute later, but when Dineen scored his third goal -- shorthanded 
and with six seconds to play in the second period -- that was deflating. Dineen 
had lost defenseman Larry Robinson and was all alone in front of Hrudey. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings didn't score in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mike Liut is one of the league's best goaltenders at the moment, the 
Whalers started Sidorkiewicz against the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
No problem for Sidorkiewicz. 
</P>
<P>
Whaler Coach Rick Ley said: "I thought we played very well. You have to play 
well to beat a team with that talent . . . They have a little bit of 
everything. That's a pretty good hockey team. But we showed grit. Our role 
players made a great showing. We showed the L.A. Kings that we can play." 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky played 35 minutes 37 seconds Saturday night, a long stretch. . . 
. The Whalers have won five of their last six. . . . Kevin Dineen's father, 
Bill, is a former Whaler coach. . . . Although goaltender Peter Sidorkiewicz 
had a record of 1-4-0 and a 5.00 goals-against average going into Saturday 
night's game, he is 2-0 against the Kings through last season.

STEWART DISPROVES NOTION THAT HE'S UNWORTHY; 
</P>
<P>
BOXING: HUGE UNDERDOG GIVES UNBEATEN EVANDER HOLYFIELD A REAL BATTLE BEFORE 
BOUT IS STOPPED IN THE EIGHTH ROUND. 
</P>

ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Boxing's heavyweight division, previously thought to be dominated by only two 
men, may have to make room for a third after what transpired Saturday night in 
Atlantic City's Convention Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Stewart, a 13-1 underdog and thought to be a near-setup for Evander 
Holyfield in his countdown to a bout with champion Mike Tyson, unexpectedly 
fought with skill, heart and courage. He also fought from the second round on 
with a deep cut on the outside of his right eye, and that cost him the fight. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield, fighting with great courage himself, preserved a multi-million 
dollar payday against Tyson, probably next June. Holyfield (23-0) got a TKO 
when the ringside doctor stopped the fight at 2:51 of the eighth round. 
</P>
<P>
It was a brutal fight. Both heavyweights absorbed a tremendous amount of 
punishment. Both had to summon strength from deep within, but Holyfield had a 
good track record for tough fights. Stewart didn't. 
</P>
<P>
The Jamaican-born and London and Brooklyn-raised Stewart was 24-0 against 
mediocre opponents and had stopped each one inside of four rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield had a tough fight in Las Vegas against Michael Dokes last March. Most 
have called that one the heavyweight bout of the eighties. 
</P>
<P>
The fight was watched by a capacity crowd of 6,415 in the Convention Hall's 
West Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield was fighting with a cold, he said later. 
</P>
<P>
"He was taking cold medication two days ago and had a vitamin shot," said his 
co-trainer, George Benton. "If I'd suggested we postpone the fight, Holyfield 
would have fired me." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart's manager, Mike Jones, came in late to the post-fight news conference 
and seemed to be disturbed with talk of a cold. "I think Alex's performance 
might have had something to do with Holyfield's performance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield's worst moments came in the furious fifth round when Stewart, at 
center-ring, rocked Holyfield with a left-right-left combination. Holyfield 
wobbled, backed up, dropped his hands and opened his mouth. He took a couple of 
more hard rights and a couple of left hooks, but survived the round. 
</P>
<P>
Every judge scored the fifth as Stewart's only round. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield's manager, Dan Duva, was smirking at the post-fight news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, where are the wise guys who said Alex Stewart couldn't fight?" he said. 
"He fought a beautiful fight." 
</P>
<P>
Added Holyfield: "Alex was courageous . . . and a lot quicker than I expected. 
I thought he was a two, three-punch combination fighter. He was throwing six, 
seven at a time tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, 223, had never fought a boxer of Holyfield's caliber, and he went to 
school over the first two rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield, 212, came out fast with hard, quick left jabs. When he got inside on 
Stewart, he stayed there, throwing short hooks and uppercuts. Thus, he was 
neutralizing Stewart's primary weapon -- a long, straight right that had 
stopped most of his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart had a rocky first two rounds. In fact, his face was reddened by the 
accumulation of Holyfield's attack before the first round ended. But he never 
lost his composure, and never let Holyfield bring in the finishing punch. He 
landed with just enough left hooks and short right hands inside to prevent 
Holyfield from opening up the throttle all the way. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, in a news conference before the fight, said, "No one is going to step 
all over me." 
</P>
<P>
The cut came midway through the second round, although no one was sure exactly 
when. Even Stewart afterward said he didn't know if it was from a head butt or 
a punch. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd never been cut before," he said. "I wasn't sure what to do. At certain 
times my vision (out of the right eye) was blurry." 
</P>
<P>
The cut was on the outside of the right eye socket, just below the end of the 
brow. And it was very deep. 
</P>
<P>
The ringside physician, Dr. Frank Doggett, checked the cut after every round 
and let it go because it wasn't bleeding directly into the eye. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart lost the first four rounds, but was by no means out of the fight. He 
never stopped throwing punches and landed enough of them to keep Holyfield 
honest. Stewart's gallant fifth was an important round for him, since he'd 
never gone that far. 
</P>
<P>
But in the sixth, Holyfield backed up Stewart with left hooks and landed two 
punishing, short uppercuts on Stewart's chin midway through the round. At this 
point, Stewart seemed to be slowing down and losing strength. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield finished the round by punishing Stewart on the ropes. When the bell 
rang, Stewart stumbled and couldn't find his corner. 
</P>
<P>
With Doggett watching, Stewart's seconds battled furiously to stop the blood 
flow, but when the bell rang for the eighth, the blood was streaming again even 
as he hoisted himself off his stool. 
</P>
<P>
There were no knockdowns. But if this battle turned on one punch, it was 
probably a powerful right to Stewart's ribs midway through the eighth. It could 
be heard several rows back into the crowd. Stewart never threw another 
significant punch. 
</P>
<P>
More important, his face was a bloody mask at that point. When Doggett looked 
at him on his stool, he told referee Tony Perez to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart earned $225,000 Saturday. His previous biggest paycheck was $13,500. 
Holyfield made $1.2 million.

IRISH NOTCH 21ST WIN IN A ROW; 
</P>
<P>
NOTRE DAME: SCHOOL RECORD FOR CONSECUTIVE VICTORIES IS TIED IN 41-0 ROUT OF 
OUTMANNED NAVY.

<P>
How does a team win 21 consecutive games? Talent, lots of it. Just ask Navy 
Coach Elliott Uzelac. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty obvious Notre Dame had too many horses for us," Uzelac said 
after his Midshipmen lost to top-ranked Notre Dame, 41-0, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we played that poorly, but at times they made us look poorly." 
</P>
<P>
Navy (2-6) remains winless against Notre Dame (9-0) since 1963. 
</P>
<P>
The 21 consecutive victories ties the school record set by teams coached by 
Frank Leahy, 1946-48, beginning with Army and ending with a tie against USC. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even mention it in the locker room after the game," Notre Dame Coach 
Lou Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish, whose last loss was to Texas A&amp;M on Jan. 1, 1988, figures to 
easily set a school record of 22 consecutive victories next Saturday they play 
host to Southern Methodist, a struggling team that resumed football this season 
after a two-year suspension from the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
"If we want to hold the score down, we'll pass on every down," Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
Against Navy, quarterback Tony Rice completed only one of eight passes for 28 
yards with two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
But Rice led a rushing attack that gained 414 yards. Ricky Watters rushed for 
134 yards and one touchdown, becoming the first Irish player this season to 
rush for more than 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Raghib (Rocket) Ismail, Notre Dame's speedy flanker and return specialist, 
suffered a groin injury in the first half and did not return. 
</P>
<P>
The shutout was Holtz's first in his four seasons as coach. The last one for 
the Irish was a 42-0 victory over Army on Oct. 15, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Rice ran six yards for a touchdown 1:15 into the game and Rod Culver ran 11 
yards for a touchdown on the Irish's next possession. 
</P>
<P>
Navy's David Lerch interrupted the next Irish drive by intercepting a pass by 
Rice, but the Middies' Alton Grizzard was sacked for a 14-yard loss on third 
down and Watters rushed for a 48-yard touchdown on the next possession for a 
21-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Hackett's 27-yard field goal made it 24-0 at halftime, and he kicked a 
39-yarder on Notre Dame's first drive of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Navy advanced to the Notre Dame 34 in the third quarter, its deepest 
penetration, but Grizzard fumbled and Eric Simien recovered for the Irish. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey Levens' two-yard touchdown run and Ted McNamara's one-yard plunge 
completed the scoring.

Michigan was playing for history Saturday, but Purdue freshman Eric Hunter 
refused to be a mere footnote. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-ranked Michigan became the second school in NCAA history to win 700 
games as Tony Boles scored three touchdowns, one on an 85-yard kickoff return, 
and the Wolverines held off Purdue and Hunter for a 42-27 Big Ten victory at 
Ann Arbor, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, a true freshman making his first start, became the first quarterback to 
pass for four touchdowns in a game against the Wolverines. Hunter completed 27 
of 42 passes for 344 yards. Three of his four touchdown passes came in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan is the first team in Division I-A history to reach the 700-victory 
plateau. Yale is the all-time NCAA leader with 753 wins. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue rolled up 389 total yards and Michigan 372. 
</P>
<P>
The victory improved the Wolverines to 7-1 overall and 5-0 in the Big Ten, 
setting up a showdown next week when they visit Illinois. Purdue dropped to 1-7 
and 0-5. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue played without Abe Hoskins, a second-string receiver from Omaha, Neb., 
who was suspended because of an arrest Friday on battery charges after an 
altercation with his former girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois 31, Iowa 7 -- Wagner Lester scored two touchdowns and quarterback Jeff 
George completed 28 of 44 passes for 302 yards and a touchdown to lead the No. 
8 Illini in a Big Ten game at Iowa City. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois, 7-1 overall, goes into its showdown against Michigan next Saturday 
with a 5-0 conference record. Iowa fell to 4-4 and 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
Lester scored on a one-yard plunge with 12 seconds left in the first half and 
also on a 26-yard burst around right end with four minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State 52, Northwestern 27 -- Jaymes Bryant handled the ball only twice but 
scored both times in helping the Buckeyes beat the Wildcats in a Big Ten game 
at Evanston, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant scored two of the Buckeyes' three second-quarter touchdowns, running 63 
yards for one and catching a pass on a 46-yard play for the other. He suffered 
a collarbone injury on his touchdown catch with 59 seconds left in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Dante Lee, who rushed for 157 yards in 24 carries, scored three second-half 
touchdowns as Ohio State (6-2 and 4-1) pulled away. The Buckeyes led 45-14 
after three quarters. Northwestern is 0-8 and 0-4. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 24, Wisconsin 22 -- Ron Goetz returned an interception 73 yards for a 
touchdown in the fourth quarter to turn back a Badger rally as the Gophers (5-3 
and 3-2) scored a Big Ten victory at Minneapolis. Wisconsin is 2-6 and 1-4. 
</P>
<P>
With 9:02 left to play, the Badgers, trailing only 17-14, drove to the 
Minnesota 30, but Goetz stepped in front of a swing pass and sprinted down the 
left sideline for the winning score.

LOOKING AT 'SENIOR' CIRCUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first pelican encountered here was an at-large bird perched on a piling 
near Tampa Bay. The area's newest Pelicans -- the St. Petersburg Pelicans -- 
were all gathered downtown at Al Lang Stadium. They're a baseball team, as well 
as an odd group of birds. 
</P>
<P>
They're a collection of Roy Hobbses, who have been away from the game for a 
time -- in some cases, a long, long time. The Florida-based eight-team Senior 
Professional Baseball Association begins play Wednesday with almost 200 former 
major-leaguers who are at least 35 years old (catchers must be 32). Managers 
range from from future Hall-of-Famer Earl Weaver to Bill Lee, the former Red 
Sox "Spaceman," who calls the aging players' new opportunity "a denial of 
death." 
</P>
<P>
The Pelicans' roster is a mixture that rivals Bernard Malamud's strangest 
fiction: 40-year-old Lenny Randle, once a Washington Senator and now a fluent 
speaker of Italian after five seasons in the Italian Baseball Federation; Sammy 
Stewart, who still speaks perfect Swannanoan probably because he's been back 
home in Swannanoa, N.C., for two years after a 10-year career, eight with 
Baltimore; Ron LeFlore, former Detroit standout also remembered for a book 
about his prison experience titled "Break Out," and Dock Ellis, who said his 
use of drugs cut short his major league career but who has long gone straight 
and is making his first appearance as a pitching coach and maybe even short 
relief man. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Bosman almost made the team. Once the Senators' ace, he is 45 years old 
and hasn't pitched in the big leagues since 1976. "If I had known this, I 
wouldn't have worn out my arm pitching batting practice for the last 13 years," 
said Bosman, who was still wearing No. 25 for the Pelicans. "Just kidding. I'll 
be in a utility role." That will include being color man on the Pelicans' local 
radio broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
The league was conceived by Jim Morley, who owns the Pelicans. At 33, he is not 
old enough to play in his own league. His only professional experience was a 
season in Fresno in the Giants organization. He was a "very light hitting 
outfielder" who went on to become a millionaire real estate developer in 
Colorado Springs. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sitting on the beach in Australia in January, about 2 1/2 weeks into a 
month's vacation, and I was reading about a senior golf tournament that was 
going on," said Morley. "I thought, 'Wouldn't it be nice if there was a senior 
baseball league?' " For the rest of the vacation, he said, he virtually ignored 
his girlfriend, Annie, while he mapped his baseball league plans, "35 pages on 
a legal pad." 
</P>
<P>
When he got home, which wasn't fast enough for him, he wrote to 1,250 former 
players. "I got back 730 positive responses," said Morley, standing by the 
batting cage watching his Pelicans work out Monday in the late afternoon sun. 
"In the first week I had 100. That's when I knew that I had hit a deal. 
</P>
<P>
"Frank White from the Royals sent me back a card that said, 'Not this year.' 
Goose Gossage said 'Yes,' but under comments added, 'I hope not this year.' 
When Dick Williams came aboard as a manager, that really gave us some 
credibility. Earl gave us more credibility." 
</P>
<P>
Weaver is managing the Gold Coast Suns (Pompano Beach-Miami), who open 
Wednesday afternoon at Fort Myers. Williams manages the West Palm Beach 
Tropics. Bill Lee has the Winter Haven Super Sox, who have several former Red 
Sox. Gates Brown manages the Orlando Juice, Clete Boyer the Bradenton Explorers 
and Graig Nettles the St. Lucie Legends. Morley would seem to have picked a 
choice location for his franchise. "The fact that I founded the league made it 
real simple," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Each team has 24 players and will play 72 games. The league has a three-year 
cable arrangement with Prime Network. Top salaries are about $15,000 a month 
and each team has a season salary cap of $550,000. Pelicans tickets sell from 
$3 to $5.50. 
</P>
<P>
Around the league are such once (and future?) wonders as a 48-year-old Luis 
Tiant, Amos Otis, Tippy Martinez, Bill Madlock, Ferguson Jenkins, Butch Hobson, 
Al Bumbry, Clint Hurdle, Bobby Bonds, Mickey Rivers, Dave Kingman, Paul Blair 
and Cesar Cedeno. 
</P>
<P>
"The players think this is about Triple-A level," Morley said. "They say that 
they don't have the speed that the kids in Triple A do, but they have the 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
The league will succeed, he added, if it offers competitive games. "This is not 
an old-timers league. You can't play 36 old-timers games. If you do, people 
won't come out and watch. People are looking for competitive baseball." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, the Pelicans have assembled a "youthful" team with an average age 
of 37 years 2 months. Bobby Tolan, the manager, has worked them hard for two 
weeks, and almost all look trim. In fact, most of the uniform pants that Morley 
ordered were too big -- especially the extra larges and extra-extra larges. 
They had to be run through a hot-water washer and dryer several times. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an another opportunity for me," said Tolan, a former National League 
outfielder who managed the last two years in the Orioles chain at Erie, Pa., in 
the New York-Penn League and aspires to big league managing. "Although it's not 
the major leagues, they are to me still major league ballplayers. Even though 
they're in the past tense." 
</P>
<P>
A friend of Tolan's, Dock Ellis has spent several years dedicated to efforts in 
keeping young people off drugs. As far as coaching, he said he's learning as he 
goes and has benefited from help by Tolan and fellow coach Ozzie Virgil Sr. 
Ellis said he would like to be a big league coach. 
</P>
<P>
"But what happens to me is, something comes up that I never really like to talk 
about, and that's my past, because of the type person that I was. ... But 
notice that I use the term that I 'was.' " 
</P>
<P>
He was 34 when he "lost the desire" for the game. He's 44 now, and for the last 
three years said he has had plenty of desire to be reconnected with baseball. 
The closest he's been was two years as a drug counselor for the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
"One more pitch -- that's it, that's it," Ellis shouted to a left-hander named 
Mike Williams, finishing his turn as batting practice pitcher. Each team is 
allowed three players with no major league experience; Williams never advanced 
above Triple A. 
</P>
<P>
But some who did are here because they want to get back to the big leagues. One 
is left-handed reliever Al Holland, whose major league earned run average is 
2.98 but who has been home in Voorhees, N.J., the last two seasons. He's 
"thrown BP" with his son's Babe Ruth team. Last spring he tried out with the 
Orioles, but was cut. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal is to come down, pitch well, exceptionally well, and maybe I'll get a 
chance to be invited to a major league camp again," Holland said. "I'm throwing 
the ball nice and easy and free. I tried to come in in better shape than I did 
in any other spring training in my career. As you get older, you get a little 
wiser. 
</P>
<P>
"The tag on me was that I was always overweight. A lot of times I wasn't, but 
that's the tag. I came into camp what I weighed when I was pitching very well 
in '83 and '84, which was 210." 
</P>
<P>
Holland said that when he and other players were younger "we took things for 
granted." Now he's working toward one last chance in the majors with the hope 
that "left-handed pitching is hard to come by. You never have enough 
left-handed pitching." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, the former Oriole who moved on to Boston and Cleveland, sat on a stool 
in the Pelicans clubhouse. "The last time I pitched, in '87," he said, "I don't 
think I was finished. I got hurt that year in a collision. But I still had the 
arm. I think I'm going to show people. I was in my best shape in '88, trying to 
get ready for a team, but they didn't call. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just good to be in the locker room again with these guys. I have an 
opportunity now to play with some great ones like (Jon) Matlack and (Milt) 
Wilcox. I've missed it. Being in the locker room. Being under the lights and 
playing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"In two World Series I was never scored on, and I was kind of disappointed that 
(then Boston manager) John McNamara didn't find time to use me in the '86 World 
Series. But," he sighed, "that's water over the dam." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart was perspiring. He said Tolan has kept him running. "The workouts have 
been hard. He runs a tight ship here and I think it's made us respect this 
league. It's not going to be a slow-pitch softball league. 
</P>
<P>
"When I left the big leagues in '87, I had a great split-finger and I was a 
little worried that it might have left me. But it didn't. It's still here and 
it's going to be a good pitch for me. Because I think most of these guys are 
going to be looking for the fastball. You're going to really have to spot your 
fastball because I see some of the older guys just jumping all over the 
fastball." 
</P>
<P>
As for Weaver, his longtime manager, Stewart said, "I'm looking forward to 
seeing the little fellow. Earl used to tickle me. He'd come out to the mound -- 
he didn't like you to walk people -- and he'd say, 'I'm 53 years old and I can 
throw the ball over a 17 1/2-inch plate. Get out of here. You stink today.' " 
</P>
<P>
As darkness fell and the Al Lang lights took hold, the Pelicans finished their 
workout. Randle was among those circling the bases -- several times. He hit 
.302 with Texas in 1974 and .304 with the Mets in '77. But before that he was a 
Senator. In 1971, his one season in Washington and Washington's last in the 
American League, he batted .219 as a rookie second baseman. 
</P>
<P>
Back this year from Italy, he had spoken about the new seniors league with its 
commissioner, Curt Flood, who told him, "Don't think it's a joke. Call." Randle 
said, "Put me down. I'll be there. I'd like to play in every league." 
</P>
<P>
One thing he remembered about his days as a Senator was Richard Nixon's 
interest in the game and the team. As he signed an autograph for an elderly 
couple he'd known for years, Randle said of his Washington days, "I've 
outlasted a lot of politicians."

LSU BEATS OLD MISS IN GAME THAT BENEFITS PARALYZED PLAYER

<P>
Tommy Hodson passed for three touchdowns and ran for another Saturday as 
Louisiana State held off Mississippi, 35-30, in a Southeastern Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
Hodson, LSU's all-time leading passer, passed for 381 yards as the Tigers 
improved to 2-6. Ole Miss, playing before a record crowd of 42,354 at 
Vaught-Hemingway Stadium, dropped to 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Eddie Fuller caught two of Hodson's touchdown passes, a 46-yard, 
first-quarter bomb to open the scoring and a 13-yarder in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fans at Saturday's game donated more than the expected $50,000 for a 
health-care plan for Ole Miss player Roy Lee (Chuckie) Mullins, who was 
paralyzed during a game last week. Final figures were not immediately 
available. 
</P>
<P>
"We will go well beyond our minimum goal," Ole Miss Chancellor Gerald Turner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The reserve defensive back was injured on Oct. 28 when he tackled a Vanderbilt 
receiver while breaking up a pass play. Mullins fractured the third, fourth, 
fifth and sixth vertebrae in his neck when he took a blow on the top of his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
Ole Miss has set up a trust fund to help provide lifetime care for Mullins, and 
one student collected at least $17,000 on her trip through the record 42,354 
fans, and $19,000 was collected in a sky box. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing about this is the united effort of people from all 
backgrounds," said Turner, who also predicted the fund-raiser would exceed the 
$150,000 needed to set up a "significant endowment fund" for Mullins. 
</P>
<P>
LSU officials donated money and other universities said they would send money 
for what he called a long-term recovery effort for the injured athlete. 
</P>
<P>
Mullins reportedly had been able to sit up and listen to part of the game on 
radio.

PALMER TRIES TO HALT DOWNWARD TREND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILBON, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It would be a good made-for-TV movie: Star running back is runner-up in the 
Heisman Trophy balloting. Smashes every important school record. But all his 
marks are stricken from the books when the university finds out he has broken a 
major rule by accepting money from a notorious sports agent. Achieves a 
lifelong dream of being drafted by an NFL team in the first round, but the 
laughter fades to tears when the woman who raised him, his great-grandmother, 
dies later the same day. 
</P>
<P>
His NFL career starts with a rush of success; stardom can't be too far away. 
But when his playing time is cut, he says jokingly, out of acute frustration, 
that he'll fix the coach -- get him fired by fumbling a time or two. At the 
start of his third season, uninjured and presumably at his physical peak, he is 
waived -- flat-out cut. 
</P>
<P>
An assistant coach who is in on the decision to cut him is the man who recuited 
him out of high school and coached him for four years in college. The team that 
calls and offers a future has, as an assistant coach, the man he had joked 
about trying to get fired less than a year earlier. Less than halfway into the 
season, the player is traded -- for a 10th-round draft pick to the worst team 
in many, many years. 
</P>
<P>
It would make a nice bit of TV fiction, except that it's Paul Palmer's life, a 
tangled, barely plausible sequence of events Palmer hopes to unknot very soon. 
</P>
<P>
Asked recently if he realizes just how out of the ordinary all of this is, 
Palmer, who grew up in Potomac, Md., nodded, managed a faint smile and said: 
"I'm still trying to catch my breath. These have been two difficult, strange 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer is with his third team, the 0-8 Dallas Cowboys. He occasionally gets to 
be the lead tailback, which is good. But he must run behind an offensive line 
that couldn't even spring Herschel Walker when he was with the team. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer started the season with the Detroit Lions, playing primarily on special 
teams. His position coach there was Frank Gansz, which would seem to defy logic 
since it was only 11 months ago when both were with the Kansas City Chiefs that 
Gansz suspended Palmer for joking to teammates that he'd put the ball on the 
carpet if it would help get Gansz -- the man who was cutting his playing time 
-- fired. 
</P>
<P>
Lions Coach Wayne Fontes went to Gansz and asked what he thought of signing 
Palmer, who had been cut at the end of training camp by new Chiefs Coach Marty 
Schottenheimer and running-backs coach Bruce Arians, Palmer's coach at Temple. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul might have been surprised, but he was always one of my favorites," Gansz 
said. "I know that may sound crazy in light of what happened. What he did hurt 
me, but I've always liked him and I thought he could help this team. I had to 
(suspend him), but I told him at the time I'm the kind of person who believes 
in letting bygones be bygones." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer was thankful for the second chance. Asked to clear up the events leading 
to his suspension last November for one game, he recalled the frustration over 
being "taken out on passing downs and having to share rushing downs. I had been 
late a couple of times for practice, and they got to the point of saying, 
'That's it.' Sort of just like I got fed up with not playing as much and said, 
'That's it.' It was mounting frustration on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no intent in the remark, but yet it was a serious remark to say 
you'd fumble on purpose. I don't think anybody who knows me took it seriously. 
But to say something like that, it's very serious and they had to do something. 
I put Coach Gansz in an extremely difficult situation." 
</P>
<P>
And himself. When Palmer came back two weeks later, he fumbled the first two 
kickoffs he handled. "It's the most nervous I've ever been in my whole athletic 
life," he said. "I was shaking. Third time I went out to take the kickoff, I 
got booed. I was scared to death." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer thought he would get a fresh chance with Schottenheimer and Arians, but 
isn't sure he did. "It didn't appear, as camp kept going, that they had a lot 
of faith in me," he said. "I had led the team in receiving much of (1988) but I 
found myself being taken out in passing situations. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed as if they didn't know how to read me. They didn't know whether or 
not I was a troublemaker, had a bad attitude or was a laid-back person. I 
thought, 'Maybe I should do extra work to show them I can catch the ball.' I 
did that, got my hands beat up bad (from catching too many passes after 
practice) and made the situation even worse." 
</P>
<P>
During pre-season the coaches told Palmer to run the ball with a sense of 
urgency. "And I was told before the final pre-season game that I was getting 
(to play in just) the fourth quarter. I don't know too many starting tailbacks 
who get the fourth quarter of the final pre-season game. A lot of the guys I 
was in with ended up getting cut. Talk about running with a sense of urgency; I 
was running for my life. 
</P>
<P>
"I went home that night, told my fiance, Virginia, 'I just don't have a good 
feeling about what's going on.' The next day in practice somebody said the 
magic words, 'The coach wants to see you.' And the ironic thing about it was 
when I got to Schottenheimer's office, there was this giant depth chart on the 
wall with all the players' names. My name was still first string. Then I go to 
(General Manager) Carl Peterson's office, and my name is first string on his 
board too." 
</P>
<P>
So the Chiefs cut a player who through the first six weeks of the 1988 season 
led the team in receiving, scoring, rushing and combined yards from scrimmage. 
"I was about the only starting tailback in the league returning kicks. I did 
everything they asked me to do," Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
(On the day Palmer was cut, Schottenheimer said he had "no doubt" Palmer was an 
NFL-caliber back and would play again this season. But he also said Palmer 
needed to run out of an I-formation, which the Chiefs do not use.) 
</P>
<P>
Palmer said he knew he had acquired a "bad rap as a player with a bad attitude" 
but says he had never complained about playing time or anything else until the 
ill-timed joke. 
</P>
<P>
As if his growing problems with the Chiefs weren't enough, it had become public 
knowledge that Palmer accepted money -- monthly payments and a $5,000 loan -- 
from agent Norby Walters during his senior year at Temple. Walters and 
associate Lloyd Bloom were convicted of charges dealing with illegal payments 
to players. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer was one of 43 players who acknowledged accepting money from Walters, 
which is regarded as one of the most serious violations of NCAA rules. While 
players often don't see it that way, Temple obviously did. 
</P>
<P>
The school voluntarily forfeited all six games it won during Palmer's senior 
year, 1986, when he led the nation in rushing (1,866 yards) and all-purpose 
yards. The only players who have gained more rushing yards than Palmer in NCAA 
Division I history are Tony Dorsett, Charles White, Herschel Walker, Archie 
Griffin and George Rogers. They all won Heismans. 
</P>
<P>
The yards, the touchdowns and the 16 school records he set as a senior no 
longer exist because Temple virtually disowned Palmer and sought to distance 
itself from him because he accepted the money. Just three years ago, Temple 
directed its sports-information department to produce 1,400 comic books 
celebrating "Boo" Palmer, as his friends call him. He expressed has mixed 
feelings about accepting the money, and Temple's reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"People constantly say, 'If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't do it.' 
But at the time you have only the present and the future, not the advantage of 
hindsight," he said. "I would like to think, 'Well, I wouldn't do that again, 
given the choice.' But I don't know that. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a decision, be it right or wrong. It was the one I had to make. Temple 
made a decision, the one it had to make. I'm not angry at Temple. I'm hurt as 
hell though. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing is none of this is simple black and white. We all know the NCAA 
rules are there. And if you break the rules that are out there, you may have to 
pay for it. That doesn't change the fact that a lot of us weren't from 
silver-spoon families. There was no money coming from my household. My 
great-grandmother was in her 70s and retired. ... 
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell you what I did with the money. I didn't get a car until February, 
after my senior season was over. I'd stick some money in unmarked envelopes and 
send it to my grandmother. She didn't know where I was getting the money from. 
There's probably one big decision I made that I never consulted her on and it 
was signing with an agent. 
</P>
<P>
"But I decided this was the best thing for me to do at that time. I could take 
my teammates to a party at the University of Pennsylvania. Before we'd have to 
bum money to get transporation to a party, bum money to get in the party, then 
to get back to Temple. Non-athletes could go to the parties and pay their own 
way because they could get work-study, which is against NCAA rules for 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd go to the mall, a party at Villanova, take the train to Rutgers. 
Everybody else could do it. You talk about athletes not being treated 
differently from other students. How come rules allow it that we can't order a 
pizza or go to the mall if our folks don't have much money? 
</P>
<P>
"Out of 10 people, I'd say two people, at the most, would do something 
different than I did. Talking around here and in Kansas City, guys have agents 
when they're juniors, some even sophomores. The NCAA rules have to be changed. 
You can't stop guys from trying to get money." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer said he does regret skipping classes and failing to apply himself in 
those he did attend. It came out during the Walters-Bloom trial that Palmer had 
failed remedial writing, completed no classes in his major and attended no 
classes most of his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the first to admit I did not apply myself," he said. "I wish I had. I put 
all my eggs in one basket: football. It scares me now. Suppose something had 
gone wrong anywhere along the line. Fortunately for me it didn't. But it 
certainly could have. I know I'd tell the next guy to come along, 'Go to class. 
Make sure you can conduct your life without football.' " 
</P>
<P>
Those weren't Palmer's only troubles. He was shaken by his great-grandmother's 
death, maybe even more than he knew at the time. "The person who I wanted to 
share all this with, the person I worked to accomplish all this for, was gone," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer thought he was settling down before being cut. He, Virginia and daughter 
Moet Frances had moved into a new home in Kansas City. "I kept telling people 
it's not like I wanted to get traded." 
</P>
<P>
But since he has to start anew, Dallas may be the best place for him. In the 
Lions' run-and-shoot offense, there is room for a back with Palmer's talents, 
but Barry Sanders also has those talents and then some. And since the Lions use 
primarily one back, they were thinking of using Palmer as a receiver. 
</P>
<P>
In Dallas, there is no glut of talent. Not in the backfield or anwhere else. 
Palmer eventually may flourish in a passing offense, which gets him into the 
open field, where he's most dangerous. Palmer had a 62-yard kick return for the 
Lions. 
</P>
<P>
That Palmer has enormous talent is undeniable. Whether he can stay in the right 
situation long enough is the big question. In Dallas the coaches say he has 
gotten to practice early and stayed late. Perhaps it is not too late for his 
story to sort itself out and have a kinder ending.

WILLIS HAS BIG DAY, LEADS FLORIDA STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Florida State quarterback Peter Tom Willis passed for a career-high 362 yards 
and three touchdowns to lead the No. 6-ranked Seminoles past South Carolina, 
35-10, Saturday at Tallahasse, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Willis completed 25 of 38 passes to become the first Florida State quarterback 
to pass for more than 300 yards four times in a season. Kim Hammond and Gary 
Huff did it three times each. 
</P>
<P>
Willis also became the third Florida State quarterback to throw for more than 
2,000 yards in a season. Huff and Bill Cappleman each did it twice. Willis, who 
has 2,323 passing yards with two games left, also is within Huff's 
single-season record of 2,893 yards, set in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
"The end of the season will tell just where Peter Tom fits in among all-time 
quarterbacks," Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden said, "but he's got to be way 
up there." 
</P>
<P>
In a 59-0 victory over South Carolina last year, Willis completed 17 of 20 
passes for 271 yards. 
</P>
<P>
He said he'd been looking forward to this year's game against the Gamecocks. "I 
looked at them on the schedule to see when they would be here," Willis said. 
</P>
<P>
The Seminoles (7-2) took a 21-0 lead midway through the second quarter as 
Willis threw 13 yards to Bruce LaSane for one touchdown, 18 yards to Terry 
Anthony for another and Paul Moore scored on a 13-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State made it 35-7 in the third quarter on Anthony's leaping catch in 
the end zone and a 12-yard touchdown run by Moore. 
</P>
<P>
Duke 52, Wake Forest 35 -- Dave Brown, filling in for the injured Billy Ray, 
passed for 444 yards and four touchdowns as the Blue Devils kept their Atlantic 
Coast Conference title hopes alive by beating the Demon Deacons at 
Winston-Salem, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Three of Brown's touchdown passes went to flanker Clarkston Hines, including 
one for 97 yards and another for 76 yards on the first play from scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
Hines, a senior who entered the game with nine touchdowns, finished with six 
receptions for 251 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Hines' 97-yarder was the longest play from scrimmage in Duke history. 
</P>
<P>
Duke, 6-3 overall, is 4-1 in the ACC and trails Virginia by a half-game. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Devils, who haven't won an ACC football title since 1965, still have 
conference games against North Carolina State and North Carolina. Virginia has 
one ACC game left, against Maryland in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson 35, North Carolina 3 -- Senior tailback Joe Henderson ran for a 
career-high 163 yards and three touchdowns as the Tigers got an ACC win at 
Chapel Hills, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson (8-2 and 5-2) led only 14-3 at halftime, but the Tigers scored four 
plays after an interception by Levon Kirkland and after that it was all 
Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson blanked North Carolina (1-8 and 0-6) in the second half and held the 
Tar Heels to minus-six yards rushing and 114 yards offense for the game. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson, averaging an ACC-leading 210.8 yards rushing entering the game, ran 
for 322 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech 34, Western Carolina 7 -- Shawn Jones threw a pair of touchdown 
passes and scored on a 19-yard run to lead the Yellow Jackets at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Tech (4-4) scored on its first possession when Jones hit Emmett Merchant with a 
two-yard touchdown pass after T.J. Edwards returned the opening kickoff 60 
yards to the Western Carolina 34. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Mays, the ACC's leading rusher who played sparingly after the first 
quarter, had 82 yards and a touchdown in 14 carries and has 929 rushing yards 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Western Carolina, a member of the Division 1-A Southern Conference, is 3-5-1. 
</P>
<P>
Miami 40, East Carolina 10 -- Quarterbacks Craig Erickson and Gino Torretta 
each directed three scoring drives the No. 7 Hurricanes won at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Miami (7-1), coming off a 24-10 loss at Florida State, led only 14-10 before 
pulling away. 
</P>
<P>
Miami freshman Stephen McGuire and junior Alex Johnson each had the first 
100-yard game of their college careers. McGuire carried 14 times for 136 yards 
and three touchdowns. Johnson carried 15 times for 111 yards and one score. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson, sidelined for the past month by an injury to his throwing hand, 
completed 11 of 17 passes for 173 yards and one touchdown. Torretta started for 
the fourth consecutive game and directed touchdown drives of 75 and 84 yards on 
the Hurricanes' first two possessions. He completed seven of 16 passes for 96 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
East Carolina fell to 4-3-1. 
</P>
<P>
Tulane 38, Memphis State 34 -- Deron Smith threw five touchdown passes, his 
fifth a 21-yarder to Jerome McIntosh with 50 seconds left, to give the Green 
Wave (3-6) a victory over the Tigers (2-7) at New Orelans. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville 55, Western Kentucky 7 -- Browning Nagle threw four touchdown passes 
to lead the Cardinals (4-4) at Louisville, and the Division I-AA Hilltoppers 
(6-4) managed only 64 yards of total offense.

VIRGINIA BEATS N.C. STATE, MOVES INTO ACC LEAD

<TEXT>
<P>
The star quarterbacks flopped and the statistics lied. Otherwise, it was just 
an ordinary upset as No. 24 Virginia beat No. 18 North Carolina State, 20-9, 
Saturday at Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
The victory enabled Virginia to take over first place in the Atlantic Coast 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The high-powered Cavaliers lost almost every offensive category but the final 
score. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolfpack ran 79 plays to Virginia's 49, and had 26 first downs to the 
Cavaliers' 13. N.C. State also held the ball for more than 36 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia's Shawn Moore and N.C. State's Shane Montgomery are considered by many 
two of the best quarterbacks in the South. But Montgomery left early with a 
concussion and Moore completed only three of 10 passes for 113 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Moore had reason to smile after teammate Jason Wallace returned an 
interception 40 yards for a touchdown and Jake McInerney extended his 
consecutive field goal streak to 14 for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
The victory puts the Cavaliers (8-2 and 5-1) in position to win their first ACC 
football title. Virginia's final ACC game will be in two weeks against rival 
Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolfpack (7-2 and 4-2) lost for the fourth consecutive time to the 
Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery broke Erik Kramer's school passing mark with 42 yards on the game's 
opening drive before being injured. Montgomery has 4,626 career passing yards 
to Kramer's 4,602. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery is not expected to miss a game.

SAN JOSE BOTCHES EXTRA-POINT TRY, LOSES; 
</P>
<P>
FRESNO STATE: BULLDOGS ESCAPE WITH A 31-30 VICTORY TO CLINCH TIE FOR BIG WEST 
TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

FRESNO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Jose State, content to settle for a tie, almost got a victory instead when 
a one-point conversion attempt went awry and almost turned into a successful 
two-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
But almost isn't close enough, and No. 25 Fresno State ended up beating San 
Jose State, 31-30, Saturday night before a record crowd of 35,353 in another 
thrilling game in this series. 
</P>
<P>
The last three games between these two schools have been decided by four points 
or less and have had wild finishes. Saturday night's game was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
After San Jose backup quarterback Ralph Martini replaced starter Matt Veatch, 
the Spartans, after being down 31-17, scored twice in the final 6:11 to get 
back in it. 
</P>
<P>
Martini scored on a keeper with 2:33 remaining to make it 31-30. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans, playing for the tie, readied kicker Jim Kirk for the extra point. 
Kirk took his spot, holder Greg Centilli got his mark and Nick Trammer snapped 
the ball. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't quite get there, so Centilli picked the low snap off the ground and 
scrambled to his right, looking for someone to throw to in the end zone. Don 
Togisala was there, but when the reserve quarterback delivered the ball, it 
bounced off Togisala's hands. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno ran out the final minutes for its 16th consecutive victory, the 
second-longest Division I-A streak in the nation, bettered only by Notre Dame's 
21. The Bulldogs are also averaging 38.6 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State, 9-0 overall and 6-0 in Big West play, claimed at least a tie for 
the conference title and, because of the victory over San Jose, clinched its 
second consecutive appearance in the Dec. 9 California Raisin Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
That bowl game, against the Mid-American Conference champion (Eastern Michigan 
is the current leader), will also be at Bulldog Stadium, where Fresno State has 
a 32-1-1 record going back to 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs, who won the Cal Bowl in 1982, '85 and '88, came back from a 17-10 
halftime deficit against San Jose to win what has developed into the annual Big 
Game in the Big West. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State dominated most of the second half, surging to its 31-17 lead on 
third-quarter touchdowns by Aaron Craver (on an eight-yard pass from Mark 
Barsotti), Myron Jones (four-yard run) and Dwight Pickens (10-yard end 
reverse). 
</P>
<P>
San Jose State, the Big West champion in 1986 and '87, dropped to 4-4 and 3-1, 
but the Spartans have been over-matched only once, and that was on the road 
against Miami of Florida, which beat the Spartans, 48-16. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, San Jose has lost only to a couple of Pacific 10 teams -- Arizona 
State (28-21 in the season opener) and Cal (26-21) -- and now Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth consecutive season that Fresno State and San Jose State have 
met with perfect conference records. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, they took it so far as to trade field goal for field goal and 
big kick return for big kick return in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State's Steve Loop took care of openers, hitting a 43-yard field goal 
with 10:25 to play in the first quarter. Kirk matched that 10:11 later with a 
33 yarder. 
</P>
<P>
On the ensuing kickoff, Bulldog Kelvin Means took the ball three yards deep in 
his end zone, headed up the middle and then cut right, sprinting down the 
sideline until being knocked out of bounds on the San Jose 13. 
</P>
<P>
Three plays later, with 14:57 left in the half, Barsotti hit end Rich 
Bertlewski for the touchdown, which gave Fresno State a 10-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
San Jose answered right back. Sheldon Canley, who began the day's action No. 1 
in the nation in all-purpose yardage, returned the next kickoff for a 97-yard 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
It may have stayed 10-10 into intermission, too, if not for Fresno State 
helping a 50-yard Spartan drive with two pass-interference penalties. The first 
moved the ball to the Bulldog 35. Two plays later, after San Jose had advanced 
to the 30, Fresno State was flagged again, pushing the ball to the 15. 
</P>
<P>
Canley went off left tackle for a three-yard touchdown with 4:12 remaining to 
make it 17-10 and set up the exciting second half.

Curtis Butts rushed for 156 yards and three touchdowns as San Diego State beat 
New Mexico 45-28 Saturday night, spoiling Terance Mathis' Western Athletic 
Conference record of 358 all-purpose yards. 
</P>
<P>
Mathis, who became the NCAA career leader in receiving yardage in his previous 
game, had six receptions for 147 yards to increase his record to 3,919 yards. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State (5-3-1 overall and 3-2 in the WAC), which led 38-28 at 
halftime, maintained the lead through a scoreless third quarter and then sealed 
its fourth consecutive victory on Butts' 15-yard touchdown run in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
That score was set up when John Wesselman forced a fumble inside the San Diego 
State 5 as Derek Coffman of New Mexico (1-9, 0-6) neared the end of what would 
have been a 76-yard touchdown run.

LONG BEACH FALLS APART AT LAS VEGAS

<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach fell apart in the second half Saturday, losing its fourth 
consecutive game, 43-21, to Nevada Las Vegas in the Silver Bowl at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Overcoming a 14-7 halftime deficit, the Rebels scored 36 points in the second 
half, more than they had scored in a single game this season. 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas, 4-4 overall and 3-2 in the Big West, intercepted two passes by 
quarterback Paul Oates in the third quarter and turned each into eventual 
touchdowns. The Rebels then poured it on, aided by an ineffective 49er defense. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach fell to 3-7 and 1-4 and has given up 40 or more points five times. 
</P>
<P>
Oates had a poor game, completing only 12 of 36 passes. But Las Vegas 
quarterback Derek Stott became the first Rebel to pass for more than 300 yards 
since Randall Cunningham did it five years ago. Stott completed 18 of 23 passes 
for 326 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Keenan McCardell caught seven of Stott's passes for 139 yards and one 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
In the Rebels' 19-point third quarter, Stott hit Rickie Wills on a 51-yard 
scoring pass play to close to 14-13. 
</P>
<P>
Then Stott drove the Rebels 63 yards in six plays to put them ahead for good, 
19-14, with 4:35 left in the quarter. DICK WAGNER Utah State 38, Pacific 10 -- 
Kirk Johnson rushed for two touchdowns and passed for another to pace Utah 
State at Stockton. Brett Payne rushed for 166 yards and two touchdowns, and 
Demetrius Brown ran for 131 yards in 22 carries for the Aggies (2-6 and 3-1). 
Pacific is 1-9 and 1-5.

NBA NOTES; 
</P>
<P>
ANOTHER SHORT SEASON AHEAD FOR TARPLEY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HUBBARD, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clifford Ray is employed as a "special assignments coach" by the Dallas 
Mavericks. The current translation is that Ray is Roy Tarpley's baby-sitter. 
When Tarpley missed a Mavericks practice last week, Ray searched for Tarpley in 
places where Tarpley was a regular. Where Ray looked is significant to 
Tarpley's NBA future. 
</P>
<P>
Nightclubs. Bars. Places where alcohol is served. Places where a two-time loser 
can easily be tempted. Tarpley has two strikes in the NBA's anti-drug program. 
One more, and he will be banned from the league for at least two years. 
</P>
<P>
So why does he go to bars? Simple. Tarpley is 24 years old. He likes to hang 
out. And perhaps he figures that because he spent 49 days in a California 
substance-abuse center last season, he can handle the temptation. 
</P>
<P>
Tarpley, in short, probably will not have an NBA career that isn't interrupted 
for at least two years. And what a gigantic waste. At 7-foot, 246, he is the 
best combination inside-outside man in the NBA. He led the league in rebounds 
per minute in each of hit first two NBA seasons. And he is a proficient shooter 
from anywhere inside 18 feet. There may be only one big man in the league 
better than Tarpley -- Akeem Olajuwon. In terms of basketball talent, Tarpley 
is Patrick Ewing's equal, and may even be better. 
</P>
<P>
But obviously, one Patrick Ewing is more desirable than 12 Roy Tarpleys. A team 
with Tarpley's talent might be able to win the NBA championship. But, because 
of his lifestyle, his team also could as easily be the top rehab volleyball 
team in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Volleyball is part of the recreation at the rehab clinic. And Tarpley is good. 
Unfortunately, if he becomes a full-time, rehab volleyball player, his 
five-year, $9-million deal with the Mavericks will be voided. 
</P>
<P>
On one hand, it is tempting to feel sad for Tarpley. He is a tremendously 
likeable person. He has a natural, sort of naive sense of humor that is 
appealing. When he was a rookie, he would leave Reunion Arena after a game, go 
to a nearby store, buy a six-pack of beer, a large package of chips and a 
bottle of Tabasco sauce. He would go home and consume it all, heavy on the 
sauce. When asked about his eating habits, he would say, "I love Tabasco sauce. 
When I was a kid, I used to drink it right out of a bottle. I'm serious. But 
when I went to the bathroom, I'd be hurtin'." He was like that -- full of 
funny, silly one-liners. 
</P>
<P>
But, on the other hand, it is difficult to feel too sorry for Tarpley because 
he has received nothing but support since his first bout with cocaine as a pro 
sent him to a rehab clinic. Tarpley's mother was an investment banker in New 
York. She gave up her job to move to Dallas to live with her son. Two years 
ago, the Mavericks employed a drug counselor to accompany Tarpley on trips. 
Mavericks owner Donald Carter even attended Alcoholics Anonymous and Cocaine 
Anonymous meetings with Tarpley. But it hasn't seemed to matter because Tarpley 
continues to be an adolescent in a man's body. After his first strike, Tarpley 
discontinued attending meetings, which are considered vital, because he figured 
he didn't need them. He was wrong.

Now he figures he can go to bars. Each aftercare program is designed to address 
the problems of the individual. If Tarpley's NBA-approved drug counselors find 
out that Tarpley has drunk an excessive amount of beer, they can suspend him 
without pay indefinitely, although he would not incur a third strike unless he 
used cocaine or heroin. Still, if the counselors say he doesn't play for a 
year, then, under terms of the anti-drug agreement, he doesn't play, and he 
doesn't get paid. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, several of Tarpley's teammates say they don't believe he can avoid a 
third strike. It seems that Tarpley continues to believe he has beaten 
something that continues to beat him. It could be another short season for Roy 
Tarpley.

The Houston Rockets say Akeem Olajuwon is no longer taking blood thinners to 
combat the phlebitis that hospitalized him for eight days in the summer and 
prevented him from playing in the exhibition season. Rockets Coach Don Chaney 
said Olajuwon will be his starting center when the Rockets open the season 
Friday in Los Angeles against the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say he's not at 100 percent," Chaney said, "but he is improving on a 
daily basis. He's about 75 percent. The key would be stamina more than anything 
else. We will monitor Akeem as we go and watch out early for fatigue." 
</P>
<P>
Chaney said Olajuwon will play in short stretches of five or six minutes during 
the first two weeks of the season and will play about 30 minutes a game. Then 
Chaney hopes to increase his playing time to 36-38 minutes a game. 
</P>
<P>
Chaney said doctors have assured him that it is unlikely Olajuwon will have a 
recurrence of the phlebitis. But he noted that it would be difficult for the 
Rockets to be successful without Olajuwon, which is a little like saying it 
would be difficult for a gelding to be a stud. No kidding, Don.

One method Lakers center Vlade Divac uses to learn English is to watch movies 
or television. The Yugoslav listens to phrases, then tries them out on 
teammates and reporters at practice. Recently, Divac watched a movie, and 
thought he had picked up how to greet people in the morning. So that morning, 
whenever Divac saw someone for the first time, he said, "Goooooood Morning, 
Vietnam." He thought that was how all Americans did it. Now if Divac can only 
develop an interest in old TV sitcoms, he can turn to his wife, Snezana, before 
they go to sleep, and say, "Goodnight, Gracie."

DESPITE THE MILEAGE, STEVE GROGAN STILL RUNNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CIMINI, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If a football player's career could be measured in mileage, Steve Grogan's 
odometer would be ready to turn over -- for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old New England Patriots quarterback has endured 14 seasons of 
punishment, compiling a list of injuries that rivals Evel Knievel. 
</P>
<P>
Grogan had a herniated disk removed from his neck and two vertebrae fused with 
a piece of bone from his hip in January. He feared his career was over, but 
here he is, still exciting the hometown fans. He has become a part of autumn in 
New England, just like the colorful leaves. He makes everyone believe. 
</P>
<P>
"With Steve in there playing like he is, I definitely believe we can finish the 
season 11-5 or 10-6," said wide receiver Cedric Jones, perhaps forgetting the 
Patriots are 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
Record aside, Grogan has inspired hope in New England. Since replacing an 
ineffective Doug Flutie three weeks ago, Grogan has sparked the offense with 
his fiery leadership. He threw a career-high 28 completions in 46 attempts for 
355 yards against the Indianapolis Colts Sunday, leading the Patriots to a 
24-21 overtime victory. 
</P>
<P>
Grogan will try to make it two in a row Sunday against the 1-7 New York Jets, 
who travel to Foxboro, Mass., with a five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Grogan never imagined he would ascend to the starting role. He wasn't even sure 
he would play again. The dreaded 'R' word invaded his vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
"Retirement was a very real possibility," Grogan said recently. "I knew I 
couldn't play without the surgery, and there were no guarantees the surgery 
would correct the problem. Up until July, there was still a pretty good 
possibility I would have to hang 'em up." 
</P>
<P>
Grogan got the OK from the doctors, but he still wasn't certain about his 
future. Tony Eason was named the starter in the off-season, and there was 
Flutie, a local hero. Grogan opened camp as the No. 3 quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came to camp, I was just hoping to get a roster spot," Grogan said. 
"When I did, with two young guys in front of me, the only chance I would have 
of seeing the field is if both of them got hurt, which was highly unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Eason was booed out of town -- he was waived Tuesday and 
claimed by the Jets Wednesday -- and Flutie couldn't get the job done. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Grogan. Again. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of got it by default," Grogan said modestly. 
</P>
<P>
That's bad news for the Jets. In 20 games against them, Grogan has 35 touchdown 
passes and only 16 interceptions. His record as a starter is 12-5. He burned 
the Jets in the 1988 season opener, throwing two touchdown passes in a 28-3 
win. The Jets fear him. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of guys, for some reason I can't explain, play well against some teams," 
Jets Coach Joe Walton said. "He always plays well against the Jets." 
</P>
<P>
Why? "There really isn't an answer," Grogan said. "It's unexplainable." 
</P>
<P>
Patriots Coach Raymond Berry said, "I don't really understand it. It's like a 
pitcher who wins 30 games a year, but there's one guy he can't get out. That's 
how it is with the Jets." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Grogan's style has changed over the years. He doesn't run as much. 
He said it's because he's smarter and he has to protect his body, which has 
absorbed many dents over the years.

<TEXT>
<P>
Boris Becker caught John McEnroe on one of McEnroe's best days, which means he 
was as brilliant as he was temperamental. 
</P>
<P>
And Becker was better. 
</P>
<P>
The West German advanced to the final of the $1.3-million Paris Open by 
unleashing big serves on big points to beat the third-seeded McEnroe, 7-6 
(7-2), 4-6, 6-3, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Becker will play No. 2 Stefan Edberg in today's final, which is worth $300,000 
to the winner. Edberg beat sixth-seeded Aaron Krickstein, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2, in the 
other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end, he was just a little better," McEnroe said. "But I felt I played 
well. We both did. It's exciting to be part of a match like that." 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth consecutive time that Becker had defeated McEnroe. 
</P>
<P>
But McEnroe, who lost seven consecutive points in the first-set tiebreaker, did 
not go quietly. His game took a decided upswing after he was assessed a penalty 
point in the fourth game of the second set. 
</P>
<P>
The outburst began with McEnroe leading, 2-1, and Becker serving at 15-15. 
McEnroe had already been complaining loudly about Becker's slow preparation for 
service. Then, McEnroe was warned about his delaying tactics while waiting for 
Becker to serve. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not ready to play when he gets to the line," McEnroe argued with chair 
umpire Richard Ings. "What makes you think I couldn't get ready to play in 10 
seconds?" 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the tournament supervisor came out and McEnroe drew a penalty, but 
his play improved. He quickly broke Becker's serve and won the second set. 
</P>
<P>
Becker responded in the third set by breaking McEnroe's serve in the second 
game and holding serve for the rest of the match. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Martina Navratilova needed only 61 minutes to defeat unseeded Anne 
Smith, 6-3, 6-2, in one semifinal match of a $300,000 tournament at Worcester, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova will play third-seeded Zina Garrison, who upset second-seeded 
Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina, 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-3), in the other semifinal.

CLOSING OF HEALTH CENTER DISMAYS CLIENTS; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILY PLANNING: OFFICIALS FEAR CUTS IN SOUTHEAST-AREA FACILITIES WILL RESULT 
IN AT LEAST 260 UNWANTED PREGNANCIES NEXT YEAR AND SCORES OF ABORTIONS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Clients who showed up at the Norwalk Health Center last Thursday to renew their 
birth control prescriptions found that service cut off. 
</P>
<P>
"We referred everybody to Bellflower," said Patti Leeson, a supervisor at the 
county facility. "Most of them are having difficulties dealing with it." 
</P>
<P>
Hit by state funding cuts, the Norwalk center -- which used to offer family 
planning services every Thursday afternoon -- was one of 13 health centers 
countywide to discontinue those services last week. The other Southeast-area 
center to eliminate the services was in Hawaiian Gardens, while the health 
center in Pico Rivera cut its family planning services back from four sessions 
a week to three. Among the results locally, county health officials fear, will 
be at least 260 unwanted pregnancies next year, an alarming spread of sexually 
transmitted diseases and scores of new abortions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real tragedy," said Dr. Irwin Silberman, director of maternal health 
and family planning programs for the county Health Department. "I'm very 
distressed." 
</P>
<P>
The cuts stemmed from Gov. George Deukmejian's decision in July to slash 
two-thirds of the state's $36.2-million family planning budget, apparently 
because of rising teen-age pregnancy rates that he considers evidence of the 
programs' failure. 
</P>
<P>
The action has been vigorously protested by pro-choice leaders and Democratic 
state legislators, some of whom rallied on Wednesday in an effort to persuade 
the governor to change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
But last week as the debate raged, clients arriving at the Norwalk and Hawaiian 
Gardens centers for various other medical services were reacting negatively to 
the news that those locations would no longer be offering gynecological exams, 
Pap smears, pregnancy counseling and birth control or testing for venereal 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the clients are low-income Latinos, many of them teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a hardship on people," said Carmen Ruiz, a mother of 10 who has 
used the family planning services in the past. "I'd rather see (the services) 
stay here." 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Maldonado said, "I don't think they should (cut) birth control. That's 
too important right now." 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the two centers -- which last year served about 1,450 family 
planning patients -- said they are referring would-be family planning clients 
to a health center in Bellflower that they believe is equipped to handle some 
of the overflow. In addition, they said, clients can get the services at the 
county facilities in Pico Rivera or Compton, although waiting periods for 
appointments at those clinics are expected to be long. 
</P>
<P>
But many of the clients, the officials say, will find it almost impossible to 
leave their neighborhoods because of lack of transportation or child care. And 
even if they do make it to Bellflower, they said, that facility has the 
capacity to handle only about a third of those turned away in Norwalk and 
Hawaiian Gardens, with the result that many will simply not get the services. 
</P>
<P>
"These are poor people who were going to family planning in order to avoid 
having more children," Silberman said. "They were acting responsibly, doing 
what we would hope they would do and what their more affluent sisters do 
regularly. Now we are denying them that opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
The result, he said, could be at least 260 unwanted pregnancies next year in 
the Norwalk and Hawaiian Gardens areas alone. Countywide, he said, the number 
will likely be in the thousands. 
</P>
<P>
Although both centers are still open for such routine medical procedures as 
physical examinations, inoculations and pediatric appointments, the mood at the 
Norwalk facility on Thursday was fairly subdued. "Word (of the cuts) must have 
gotten around," Leeson said. 
</P>
<P>
Though abortion was never among the services offered at the two centers, 
Silberman said, as many as half of the new unwanted pregnancies are likely to 
end in abortions. "If people support cutbacks in family planning," he said, 
"they are promoting and supporting the need for abortions. When poor women 
become pregnant and recognize that they are unable to care for the coming 
child, they seek abortions. We think it's a sad irony."

A PERSONAL HORROR STORY ON PESTICIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I feel compelled to respond to Supervisor Pete Schabarum's remarks to the 
Downey Rotary Club luncheon last Tuesday (Times, Oct. 26). Schabarum stated 
that "a couple of local politicians, desperately seeking some kind of issue to 
justify reelection, have jumped on the construction of a county facility and 
have repeatedly described it as some kind of chamber of horrors." Schabarum was 
referring to Norwalk Assemblyman Bob Epple and Downey Councilman Roy Paul. 
These gentlemen have tried to inform the citizens in the area adjacent to the 
pesticide warehouse of the potential dangers. 
</P>
<P>
"A chamber of horrors," if I may borrow from Schabarum, is an accurate 
description of the present warehouse in Pico Rivera. In January of 1987, my 
husband, a 14-year employee with the Los Angeles County Department of the 
Agricultural Commissioner, was exposed to aluminum phosphide gas. He and two 
other county employees were hospitalized for 24 hours. Aluminum phosphide is 
used to fumigate grain for the control of rodents, etc. The fumigation was not 
properly performed and the poisonous gas was vented into the interior of the 
warehouse. My husband and the other two men were in the warehouse attending to 
work-related responsibilities and were not involved in the ill-fated 
fumigation. After release from the hospital, all three were homebound for three 
weeks per doctor's orders. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum stated that he "believes the facility will operate safely on Downey's 
western border with South Gate." I say to the supervisor, before any pesticides 
are stored, or any grain is treated, please see that the people directly 
involved with the daily function of this warehouse are properly trained. Also, 
in the event of any violation, the penalty should be in accordance with the 
penalties issued to private industry.

SHAKY SOUTH EL MONTE TAKES IT IN STRIDE

SOUTH EL MONTE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The way most residents figure it, you do what you can and try not to worry 
about what you can't. 
</P>
<P>
Wedged between the San Gabriel River and the Rio Hondo, this tiny San Gabriel 
Valley industrial city is built on sandy, alluvial ground -- "old river bed," 
as Assistant City Manager Steve Henley decribes it. 
</P>
<P>
State experts say a major earthquake -- the big one -- could liquefy the city's 
base, churning up the ground and the subterranean water table like a Manhattan 
in a cocktail shaker. 
</P>
<P>
"Most engineers we've talked to say there's not much we can do about it," said 
Henley, who also is the city's emergency services coordinator. "The ground 
shakes, and the water and sand mix. The only thing we could do is excavate the 
sand, putting in a sturdier base, or get rid of the water. Neither are 
practical." 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable residents in this city of 19,800 tend to shrug off the extra 
dangers. 
</P>
<P>
Seven miles east of downtown Los Angeles, South El Monte has more than 1,300 
businesses, one for every 15 residents. Companies such as chicken wholesalers 
Zacky Foods and Foster Farms and sportswear manufacturer Joni Blair have 
established home bases there because of the city's central location and its 
fiscal policies, with no property taxes, utility taxes or business license 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the city has also become a Latino enclave. Three-quarters of 
the population is Spanish-surnamed, according to city officials. Many are 
particularly worried about earthquake dangers. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of a lot of bad experiences by family members in Mexico City (during 
an 8.1-magnitude quake in 1985), they're more sensitive than a lot of other 
people," said Patrick Sayne, superintendent of the city's Valle Lindo School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
Still, residents have some reason for consolation. Although parts of the city 
are barely a mile from the epicenter of the Oct. 1, 1987, Whittier Narrows 
5.9-magnitude earthquake, damage was negligible. 
</P>
<P>
Damage in the city was so slight -- about $50,000 worth -- that the city had to 
return a $150,000 state disaster assistance loan that was rushed through after 
the quake. "Nobody ever qualified for the money," Henley said.

GADFLY SUES CITY OFFICIALS OVER ARREST 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gadfly Stanley Wantuch has filed a lawsuit in Norwalk Superior Court against 
Downey Councilman Robert G. Cormack and other city officials, accusing them of 
false arrest, assault and battery and of depriving him of his First Amendment 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
Police dragged Wantuch out of the Downey City Council chamber and arrested him 
last November after Cormack and other officials claimed he was disrupting a 
council meeting. Wantuch had been ejected from a council meeting the month 
before for videotaping from an aisle in violation of a city ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, a Municipal Court jury found Wantuch innocent of disrupting the 
council meetings and obstructing a police officer. The judge in the case 
criticized Cormack for depriving Wantuch of his freedom to speak and called the 
arrest unlawful and unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Wantuch said he suffered neck, shoulder and back injuries when he was removed. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages. It also seeks an injunction to prohibit 
armed, uniformed police officers from serving as sergeants-at-arms at the 
council meetings -- the city's current practice. The lawsuit alleges that the 
presence of an armed police officer inhibits free speech during council 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Downey City Atty. Peter Thorson could not be reached for comment.

AVALON BUSINESSES WANT OUT OF AQMD; 
</P>
<P>
POLLUTION: AQMD'S NEW FOCUS ON REGULATING SMALL BUSINESSES SPURS RESIDENTS TO 
PROTEST THAT PRISTINE AIR OF CATALINA ISLAND DOES NOT POLLUTE THE LOS ANGELES 
BASIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Avalon city officials and business owners, arguing that Santa Catalina Island's 
air is pristine and does not contribute to pollution in the Los Angeles Basin, 
want out of the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter presented to an AQMD official last month, Catalina Chamber of 
Commerce President George A. Escofie disputed the logic of having islanders 
conform to the district's air quality regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The island's business community, he wrote, "simply fails to understand its 
contribution to the air quality problems of the Los Angeles Basin or the 
inclusion of Catalina Island in the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District." 
</P>
<P>
The letter asks that AQMD boundaries be redrawn to exclude the largely 
undeveloped, 76-square-mile island from the district. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say that although the district's geographic boundaries are drawn 
along county lines, Catalina could become part of another less urban district, 
or the island's unique location could be considered when permit fees for 
smog-emitting equipment are levied. 
</P>
<P>
As a third alternative, they suggested forming a new Channel Islands district, 
in addition to the 41 existing districts, said City Manager Chuck Prince. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got 22 miles of open water between us and the balance of the district, 
and we don't see that we're in the same air basin," Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
The movement was sparked by recent visits to several island businesses by AQMD 
officials, who have begun notifying small businesses countywide of new permit 
fees and requirements for certain kinds of equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the increased attention on the island results from the district having 
redrawn -- in late 1988 -- its list of equipment for which permits are needed. 
Claudia Keith, an AQMD spokeswoman, said a lot of equipment that previously did 
not require permits were added to the list, including restaurant charbroilers, 
bakery ovens and cleaning equipment at dry-cleaning stores. 
</P>
<P>
In Avalon, an AQMD inspector notified owners at more than half a dozen 
businesses with such equipment that they would have to get permits and pay 
fees. The businesses included the Avalon Hospital, a golf cart rental facility, 
the Southern California Edison electrical generating plant and several 
restaurants, Keith said. 
</P>
<P>
But when they got the message, the Avalon business community balked. Merchants 
argue that the fees are exorbitant and wonder how they will help clean up the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
"For our little island it gets to be a pain in the butt, all the rigmarole they 
put us through," said a secretary who fills out air quality reports for a waste 
disposal business on the island. "They're treating us like a big city." 
</P>
<P>
Islanders cite a number of reasons why Catalina is different from everywhere 
else. For example, the number of cars in Avalon is limited by city ordinance to 
about 800. The state Department of Motor Vehicles has already excluded Avalon 
from smog certificate requirements, and about half the residents walk to work 
in the one-square-mile town, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The tourist-oriented island -- 86% of which is preserved by a nonprofit 
conservancy in its natural state -- has virtually no heavy industry. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD spokesman Bill Kelly said part of the problem is that the district is 
beginning to focus enforcement on smaller polluters, including businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone thinks that what they pollute is minimal," Kelly said. "The air from 
Catalina does come on shore very often. . . . Therefore, whatever pollution is 
produced out there is going to be transported to the mainland."

FOUCAULT'S PENDULUM BY UMBERTO ECO, TRANSLATED BY WILLIAM WEAVER (A HELEN &amp;

<P>
Umberto Eco's new novel is an artichoke with 641 leaves and not much heart. 
There is some real pleasure in artichoke leaves, but what with the work and the 
scratchiness you probably wouldn't undertake one unless you thought there would 
be a heart in it. 
</P>
<P>
True, in "Foucault's Pendulum" the absence is part of the point. Its 
elaborately branched story about the search for an ancient secret whose 
possession will confer world mastery is both an illustration and a parody of 
the contemporary literary doctrines of semiology and structuralism. 
</P>
<P>
Eco is a professor of semiology and a novelist, author of "The Name of the 
Rose." His new book is a bravura series of variations and reverses on the 
structuralist view that the important reality in a text is the text itself. 
"Hamlet," for example, is not "about" a melancholy prince and the difficulty of 
action. It is "about" Shakespeare's telling the story. He might have told it 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
In one of many witty passages in "Pendulum," in fact, Belbo, a nervous and 
suggestible book editor who is jealous of his authors, imagines himself 
coaching Shakespeare. Don't set it in France, he advises; set it in a less 
distinctive place, say, Denmark. How about having the ghost come in at the 
beginning instead of the end? And couldn't we improve on: "To act or not to 
act, that is the problem"? 
</P>
<P>
Belbo, in other words, is "deconstructing," showing the inner flux and 
instability of monuments. Structuralism, like modern science -- which it aims 
to be -- divides the visible into subatomic particles.At that level, a chair 
and the thumbtack placed upon it are much the same. So are Superman and Keats. 
In physics, a lot of energy has been liberated. In literature, a lot of 
scholarly activity has been liberated, but perhaps less energy. 
</P>
<P>
To tell what "Pendulum" is about, itself requires a certain deconstruction. The 
plot is the least of it, being, essentially, an invention of the characters. 
Only at the end does the invention appear to come true, although this 
"coming-true" also is an invention. Through it, Eco makes his point -- 
satirical, serious and above all ambiguous. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, then; or rather, unessentially: Belbo, Diotallevi and the 
narrator, Casaubon, three Milan intellectuals of varying stripes and 
edginesses, work for Garamond, publisher of a few serious books and of a great 
number of vanity items, paid for by their authors. 
</P>
<P>
One of these, a comically paranoid and right-wing former Foreign Legionnaire 
who goes by the name of Colonel Ardenti, turns up with a book about a mystical 
secret known to the Knights Templar. The Templars fought in the Holy Land, came 
back to Europe, but became rich and powerful, and eventually were broken and 
dispersed in the 14th Century by the Pope and King Philip of France. 
</P>
<P>
Ardenti claims to have found part of the secret in the form of a coded message. 
The Templars, he asserts, hid it and purposely got themselves suppressed in 
order to go underground until, through a 600-year line of initiates and adepts, 
it should be time for it to become known. The time is now, he insists; by 
publishing what he knows, others will come forward and complete the chain. 
Instead, Ardenti vanishes. 
</P>
<P>
Garamond, for reasons that will become unpleasantly clear at the end, thereupon 
orders a line of books on similar themes. Manuscripts pour in on such assorted 
topics as the Rosicrucians, the Masonic lodges, the Bavarian Illuminati, and 
all kinds of alchemical and other lore from the long Western tradition of 
hermetic and underground belief. 
</P>
<P>
It is all so far-fetched and arbitrary that Belbo, Casaubon and Diotallevi 
decide they can do better. They feed the manuscripts and masses of other 
research into a computer. And they proceed to invent their own elaborate theory 
about the Templar secret. 
</P>
<P>
It consists, they decide, of a map through which can be found a place where the 
earth's magnetic currents form a kind of node. Power over this node will allow 
vast tectonic displacements. Japan, for instance, could be dumped into the Gulf 
of Panama. Such a power, of course, would make its holders the monarchs of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Using scraps of history, and reams of mystical and cabalistic writing through 
the ages, the three construct the secret's genealogy. The Templar tradition, 
they decide, has been fragmented and passed in bits into the hands of any 
number of rival secret societies. 
</P>
<P>
Such figures as Roger and Francis Bacon, Descartes, Voltaire, Frederick the 
Great of Prussia, and Adolf Hitler had connections with them. 
</P>
<P>
The trio keeps reminding itself that all this is an invention; a text, as it 
were. But they get sucked in. And all kinds of ominous events and pseudo-events 
begin to take place; various enigmatic figures begin to turn up. An incautious 
and invented hint that they possess the Templar map brings on a bomb attempt 
and blackmail threat. Finally, Belbo is kidnapped and taken to the old Templar 
church of St. Martin des Champs in Paris, now the science museum that houses 
the pendulum of the title, among other things. There, at midnight, a disorderly 
gathering of Satinists and Occultists and an assortment of secret orders demand 
the map. He refuses and is killed. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the book, Ditallevi is dying of cancer and regrets that, as a 
devotee of the Kabbala, he has played with "The Word." And Casaubon is in 
hiding, expecting a visit at any moment from the "They" who eliminated Belbo. 
</P>
<P>
It is a double semiological joke. If reality is simply a text, then the Milan 
trio can, simply by writing it, proclaim the secret of the universe. But if, to 
reverse things, text is reality, it can materialize and gobble them up. 
</P>
<P>
Eco hovers astride the joke, neutrally and with evident glee. At the end, the 
narrator reflects that the only reality is in such things as the taste of a 
peach and the sound of a trumpet. And, after all, Belbo has died rather than 
reveal the details of a map that is pure invention. Is it Eco's message that 
there is a reality worth dying for beneath the text? But it is text to say so. 
</P>
<P>
Eco's jokes are splendid. There is Belbo's beloved computer. Casaubon struggles 
with elaborate numbers and combinations to get into it, but the machine keeps 
repeating: "Have you the password?" Finally, Casaubon gives up and writes: 
"No." That, of course, is it. 
</P>
<P>
There is the imaginary college that the trio devise in their spare time, 
offering courses in Potiosection (slicing soup) and Mechanical 
Avunculogratulation (building machines to greet uncles). There is Lia, 
Casaubon's wonderfully sage girlfriend, who examines the Templar message -- 
upon which the whole phantasmagoric structure rests -- and concludes that it is 
simply a medieval merchant's list of things to do that day. 
</P>
<P>
We could have used more Lia. There are any number of good things in "Pendulum," 
but a novel is not a truffle-hunt. Its central paradox is neat and springy, but 
a novel is not a mousetrap either. 
</P>
<P>
Eco's conceits are buried in a vast verbiage, a wearying thicket of occultist 
lore and scholarship. A whole leaden section is devoted to a visit to Brazilian 
voodoo ceremony; another to a tired occultists' orgy. There is a seeming 
infinity of false leads and circling suppositions. 
</P>
<P>
Eco's game demands quite a few more reader candles than it is worth. "Name of 
the Rose" may have been the best-liked half-read novel of its day. "Pendulum," 
I suspect, will be well-liked too; and only one-quarter read.

THE VILLAGE STILL WEIGHED BY WAR; 
</P>
<P>
VOICES IN THE EVENING BY NATALIA GINZBURG; TRANSLATED BY D.M. LOW (ARCADE 
PUBLISHING/LITTLE BROWN: $16.95; 171 PP.) 
</P>

<P>
Long admired in her native Italy, Natalia Ginzburg's terse, limpid novels and 
trenchant essays are now being reissued in English translation. Even in this 
one short novel, the author's sensitivity to the nuances of Italian political 
and social issues and the economy with which she distills the essence of an 
entire region through the personalities of a few characters are immediately 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the Italian Parliament as well as a dramatist, biographer, critic 
and translator, Ginzburg was born in Sicily, grew up in Turin and married the 
notable anti-Fascist Leone Ginzburg. During the war, the family fled to an 
isolated village in the mountains of the Abruzzi, where they lived in enforced 
obscurity until an ill-timed return to Rome, where Leone Ginzburg was arrested 
and killed by the Nazis. Widowed, the author returned to Turin, worked for a 
publishing house and began writing the stark, deceptively simple stories of a 
nation in post-war conflict and confusion. 
</P>
<P>
"Voices in the Evening," first published in 1961, is set in a small provincial 
village and narrated by Elsa, whom we see both as an innocent adolescent and as 
the disillusioned young woman she becomes. The style is austere, virtually 
minimalist, yet the salient incidents are so meticulously chosen that we know 
the people and the town as thoroughly as in a saga three times the length. In 
effect, the reader becomes the writer's collaborator; filling in background, 
imagining detail, establishing connections merely suggested in the story 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Elsa's mother is a querulous hypochondriac, disturbed at her daughter's single 
state and fearful that she'll wind up like her Aunt Ottavia, an elderly maiden 
lady who lives as a shadowy presence in her sister's household. In Elsa's view, 
Aunt Ottavia is treated almost as if she were inanimate, as unobtrusive and 
convenient as a spare armchair. When the novel begins, Elsa is 27, a dangerous 
age for Italian women of her time and place. Her prose is edgy, the flat, 
declarative mode revealing her cynicism. 
</P>
<P>
The De Franciscis are the leading family of the village, owners of a once- 
prosperous factory that has fallen into decline though the neglect of the owner 
and the indifference of his sons. One of these sons, the brooding and mercurial 
Tommasino, is the love of Elsa's life, a passion he reciprocates only wanly. 
Although Elsa becomes his mistress, spending Wednesday and Saturday afternoons 
with him in a rented room in a nearby town, the affair seems to lose momentum 
as it proceeds, paralleling the decline of the family factory. When Tommasino 
finally brings himself to propose formally, he's so oppressed by the imminence 
of marriage that Elsa releases him; a fortunate decision, because Tommasino is 
so lacking in vitality that the marriage seems doomed to mirror the sinking 
family fortunes. Elsa deserves better, and one senses she'll eventually find 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The De Franciscis' sons have been overshadowed since childhood by their cousin 
Purillo, an orphan adopted by their father "Old Balotta." Purillo is an 
ambitious, energetic opportunist, and as Tommasino observes, he "has got plenty 
of vitality, or rather, he has not so much got it as that he behaves as if he 
had, and he gets the results he wants . . . Perhaps he has never realized that 
they have already exhausted all the vitality that was available in this place." 
</P>
<P>
Succinct as it is, the novel provides memorable vignettes of the various people 
whose lives are inextricably bound to the narrator's -- the ill-chosen wives of 
the De Franciscis brothers, the giddy Bottiglia sisters, continually held up to 
Elsa as an example of successful womanhood; the promising young man Nebbia, 
killed by the Fascists, whose death permanently touches all the young people in 
the town. Even the subsidiary characters, defined in a reference or two, 
contribute significantly to our perception of life in this particular place 
during an era of disruption and change. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the grace of Ginzburg's style in Italian is often obscured by an 
awkward, imprecise and quaintly British translation that seems ill-suited to an 
essentially contemporary novel. Raffaella, one of the two De Franciscis 
daughters, is described as a "boisterous hobbledehoy"; a servant returns from 
berry-picking "heated," Elsa's mother refers to an English raincoat as a 
"montgomery." Even so, "Voices in the Evening" will arouse interest in a writer 
who explores the profound effect of historical upheaval upon Italian life; a 
theme she has made particularly her own, fully exploiting her political 
sophistication and her intimate knowledge of village life.

10 + 10: CONTEMPORARY SOVIET AND AMERICAN PAINTERS EDITED BY VIKTOR MISLANO,

<P>
10 + 10 does not always add up to 20! Here is a case where the sum is much 
greater. The catalogue "10 + 10: Contemporary Soviet and American Painters" is 
more than a new publishing project for American and Soviet cultural 
cooperation, more than back-up material for the exhibition that started its 
intercultural tour in May this year at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth. 
This is an invaluable book on the most recent trends in American and Soviet 
painting, displaying only artwork by painters under 40. 
</P>
<P>
Assembling the show and catalogue in both Russian and English, the large, 
Soviet-American team of exhibition directors, curators, catalogue editors, 
translators and painters (10 Americans, 10 Soviets) is, regrettably, too 
numerous to mention by name. The entire intercultural venture is described in 
penetrating essays by Viktor Mislano, curator of art at Moscow's Pushkin 
Museum, and John E. Bowlt, a professor of Slavic Studies at USC and one of 
America's top experts on avant-garde Russian art. 
</P>
<P>
A first glance at this attractive catalogue leaves one wondering whether the 
reader's attention will be as symmetrical as the American and Soviet paintings. 
For one obvious reason, the American painters surely are at a disadvantage. 
While Americans know little about new Soviet painting (indeed, the same could 
be said, until very recently, of the Soviets!), they will be especially drawn 
to the Russian paintings for the way they turn our few preconceived notions 
inside out. These cliches range from ugly Socialist Realism (with its 
trademark, the gigantic working couple armed with their inevitable props, the 
hammer and sickle) to the Russian avant-garde, as yet unsurpassed (with its 
trademark, Malevic's famed black square). 
</P>
<P>
A second glance at the catalogue and the biographies of represented artists 
enhances first impressions. The Soviet painters are more aggressive, more 
impassioned in texts they have written to accompany their paintings, while the 
American writing is more subdued. At first it seems as if the Americans are 
playing the cordial hosts, doing everything they can to make their guests feel 
at home and do their best. But in all fairness, the literary expressiveness of 
the young Soviet painters is as much a reflection of a traditional culture 
dominated by the Word as it is an expression of the artists' youthful 
verbosity. Whatever the case, these texts are intriguing and often crucial to 
an understanding of the paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Yurii Albert, author of the "manifesto" paintings "I Am Not Jasper Johns" and 
"I Am Not Baselitz," feels that "the place of each work of art is defined by 
its correspondence to other works." Vladimir Mironenko insists, within the 
Soviet context, on the uniqueness of recent Soviet art ("A new Soviet 
civilization has come into being"). Andrei Roiter works with signs ("In trying 
to express my sense of time I make use of an 'alphabet' of topical signs, 
structuring a sort of pseudo-universal plastic language"). 
</P>
<P>
The word "sign" appears frequently, used as well by Anatolii Zhuravlev 
("Everything -- or almost everything -- is a sign, a symbol, or a system of 
signs"). Konstantin Zvezdochetov, a true child of the postmodern age, 
demonstrates a self-deprecating exhibitionism and a talent for mystification 
("I, Konstantin Zvezdochetov, am a member of a secret organization, the Black 
Faculty"). 
</P>
<P>
A third glance at the artwork displayed in the catalogue destroys all 
preconceptions and brings one to the startling conclusion that artistic 
discoveries and dialogue in the two countries are remarkably similar despite 
geographical distances and disparities between cultures and political systems. 
If someone were to switch the signatures under many of these paintings, the 
reader might find it hard to pinpoint the "Soviet" or "American" qualities of 
each piece. How could this be so after the isolation that has shrouded Soviet 
art for so many years? Is Moscow slated to become a new metropolis in the art 
world? 
</P>
<P>
The paintings of the young Soviet painters come from an alternative, 
underground culture that has been evolving for several decades in opposition to 
official culture, gaining cultural legitimacy only two or three years back. 
Returning to the tradition of the Russian avant-garde, yet rejecting it, 
imitating Western models while repudiating them, Soviet alternative culture has 
survived in a state of isolation bereft of markets, shows, museum status -- and 
in the process it has forged an artistic language all its own. 
</P>
<P>
In constant defiance of ruling aesthetic and ideological norms, the collective 
underground life of painters, writers and artists ultimately produced truly 
original artistic forms, genres, directions, groups, poetics ("soc-art," 
"apt-art," "conceptualist actions") and artistic figures such as Ilya Kabakov, 
Erik Bulatov and Komar and Melamid. 
</P>
<P>
By the '70s, these artists had mastered soc-art, their own, authentic voice. 
The youngest Soviet artists absorbed the soc-art aesthetic, ranging in their 
approach from a more "literary" version (Bulatov, Kabakov) to the 
political-grotesque (Komar and Melamid), the political poster (Alexander 
Kossolapov, who signs Lenin's name as author of the slogan "Coca-Cola Is the 
Real Thing") and intermedia. 
</P>
<P>
Because of their new voice, young Soviet artists are now able to articulate the 
ideological context of everyday life, participating in the international 
artistic community on an equal footing with artists from other countries. This 
allows us to compare Vladimir Mironenko and Peter Halley, Alexei Sundukov and 
April Gornik, Yurii Albert and Mark Tansey, Leonid Purygin and David Bates, 
Konstantin Zvezdochetov and Annette Lemieux. The only unanswered question is 
whether their similarity is one of resemblance or of difference, whether 
Vladimir Mironenko is right in saying, "I would like to know how our enormous 
country, existing, as it were, in a different dimension, fits in with what is 
happening in the rest of the world. What kind of art can it produce? One 
bearing only a superficial resemblance to art created in the West, its content 
is by now completely different. This is not a continuation of the Russian 
avant-garde traditions of the turn of the century. It is already something new, 
purely Soviet in origin and intent." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the case, here is my advice: See for yourself how 10 + 10 add up, 
catch the show while it is open in San Francisco, Buffalo, Milwaukee or 
Washington, where the American tour of "10 + 10" ends in June, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
If you can't see it then, don't miss it in Moscow, Tbilisi or Leningrad, where 
the show finally will close in November of 1990. If all else fails, at least 
you should order the catalogue. Come to think of it, order it anyway. "It's the 
real thing," in Lenin's immortal words.

FICTION IN BRIEF: THE ADVENTURES OF A PHOTOGRAPHER IN LA PLATA BY ADOLFO BIOY

<P>
The reader of a novel is like a young man from the provinces who arrives in the 
big city gawking, suitcase in hand. What adventures will befall him? Romance? A 
mugging? The main thing is that they start soon. The veteran Argentine writer 
Adolfo Bioy Casares, best known for "The Dream of Heroes" and his 
collaborations with Borges, doesn't disappoint. He begins: "Around five in the 
morning, after a bus trip as long as the night, Nicolasito Almanza arrived in 
La Plata. He had barely walked a block . . . when somebody waved to him." 
</P>
<P>
And not just any somebody. Don Juan Lombardo, the old gentleman who detains 
him, is the spark that sets in motion a storytelling engine of near-perfect 
efficiency. In this short novel, no time is wasted, no character or detail 
superfluous, no remark without its point. Yet this very perfection makes the 
novel seem faintly stylized, its age-old devices -- coincidental meetings, 
delayed paychecks, midnight trysts, nosy landladies -- at odds with the 
contemporary, sexy story being told. Bioy Casares' lucid prose might as well be 
the misty, shifting light of La Plata that blurs the buildings Almanza 
photographs; the effect is of near-total ambiguity. 
</P>
<P>
The young man is a novice, but his photographs have a magical effect on all who 
see them. He is poor and diffident but rapidly attracts friends and lovers. Don 
Juan may be a harmless eccentric, but he may also be a swindler, a vampire, 
even the devil. His two daughters, Julia and Griselda, both of whom the lusty 
Almanza beds, present interchangeable faces of love. The photographer's friend 
Mascardi, a cop, may be informing on other friends who are student radicals. 
Reality and dream, common sense and paranoia, flip-flop. Almanza survives what 
may be a murder attempt because he has picked up a few city tricks -- and 
because he has remained as sweet-natured and guileless as Candide. 
</P>
<P>
"The Adventures of a Photographer in La Plata," like much other Latin American 
literature, gives the impression of a culture both younger and older, raunchier 
and more sophisticated, than our own: a blend of Europe and the wild frontier. 
In Bioy Casares, who is 74, the sophistication predominates. Though jacket 
blurbs tout his "magical existentialism," our reader needn't fear that heavy 
metaphysical baggage will weigh down his suitcase. Rather, it's like the fizz 
of electricity above the trolley that carries him effortlessly down new and 
exotic streets. Michael Harris

 Marcus quotes and compares the prophetic voice to that of the early Dylan, of 
Isaiah, of Johnny Rotten, "defining what rock 'n' roll no longer dares to say." 
Something about Hall's poetry always has made it timely, a part of the news as 
well as of literature. 
</P>
<P>
He started, as do most writers, embedded in the idiom of his time. It was the 
1950s, and his early, prize-winning poems were about exile and existential 
estrangement. Holding his new-born child in his arms, he addressed it as "my 
son, my executioner"; he mourned the decay of rural New Hampshire, where he had 
spent this school vacations, and he detailed the dull, familiar features of the 
suburbia in which he had been raised. Those almost identical "dark houses 
harden into sleep," he wrote, and it was a sleep where he saw no refreshment, 
no waking into vigor. 
</P>
<P>
But he was looking for something more. Searching for an imagery equivalent to 
the heartland from which we have been exiled, he entered next upon a different 
kind of poetry. In "The Long River" he rows into a dark, mysterious interior: 
</P>
<P>
 The musk-ox smells 
</P>
<P>
 in his long head 
</P>
<P>
 my boat coming. 
</P>
<P>
 The musk-ox is both ominous and vital; his appetites have become forgotten in 
suburbia. The spondaic phrases give the writing a slowness, a weight, that it 
has not had before. And its syllabic form -- Hall was the inventor of syllabics 
in our time -- make for a more unpredictable verse-movement than in the earlier 
poetry, with which it has little in common. 
</P>
<P>
It was now the '60s, and he moved into different kinds of free verse. "The 
Alligator Bride" embodies a kind of jocular surrealism. Such investigations of 
the irrational, however, led him eventually to the true sources of the rural 
nostalgia that always had haunted him. He quit teaching at Ann Arbor in 1975, 
remarried, and moved back to the farmhouse of his maternal grandparents, not as 
farmer himself but as a writer who wanted to raise poetry on farmland. And he 
succeeded, writing poems that were less elegies for the past than realizations 
of it -- about the cart horses and the hen yard, the Holsteins and the ox-cart 
man, their lives thick with things. He lifted the recurrent rhythms of the 
farming year into the present tense. 
</P>
<P>
His career seemed inconsistent and unpatterned, as Herman Melville's must have 
looked during his time, or Shakespeare's. But he has always been consistent in 
his subject matter, his poetry being preoccupied with the shared rather than 
the exceptional experience, with what we have or could have in common. 
</P>
<P>
Thus "The One Day" consists of the voices of all of us. The poem is in three 
parts. The first opens with an aging man daydreaming and smoking in his yellow 
chair, "unfit/to work or love." His voice is joined by a woman's but they are 
the same voice, though they speak of different lives, and we come to understand 
that they have led the same life, in which the promise of fullness has been 
answered only by the fact of emptiness. They speak of a self without center, an 
existence without revelation or joy. "The world is a bed," they say; that is, 
the world has become reduced to a bed of adultery, a bed of insomnia, a bed of 
sleep only after pills chased down with whiskey. The voices weave and 
alternate, but they speak of the same dead end; of having been herded 
unwillingly into a present with no real connection to past or future, a present 
in which they find neither rest nor meaning. 
</P>
<P>
It is written in a line based on the Old English accentual line as it was 
loosened and revised by Pound, one of the most useful and flexible technical 
innovations of the century. The collage and juxtaposition of experience that he 
uses also is a modified Poundian method, making possible the economical 
inclusion of a great deal of specific heterogeneous material. 
</P>
<P>
For this poem is all detail and circumstance, the one day made up of many 
specific days, the one life of many lives, though they lead the speaker into 
the same narrow place, at the end of which is only fear. At the end of the 
first part, the female voice tells, with a deadly flatness, how she prepares to 
give her children pills which will kill them. Then there enters someone whose 
identity hovers just out of sight, the way a beekeeper's mask darkens a face, 
who picks up a rag doll and starts to demonstrate on it the proper ways to 
dismember a child, as one might a dead fowl, by cutting its limbs carefully 
into sections. 
</P>
<P>
Though Part One ends thus in nightmare, it has been moderate in tone, that of 
someone no longer possessing the energy to direct his or her own life. By 
contrast, Part Two, with the title "Four Classic Texts," starts with rage. 
"Prophecy," which reminded Greil Marcus of Johnny Rotten, is a curse -- against 
our civilization and against life itself. It is succeeded by the rage of 
satire, a bitter satire of love and sex and marriage, in "Pastoral". The work 
is still a bed, in which "we pull off our clothes like opening junk mail." 
"History" follows, rage against the past, and consists of a terrible parody of 
what already parodies itself, the list of human destructiveness, and Tiberius 
melts into Stalin. The fourth classic text, though, is not like the others: 
"Eclogue" replaces their destructive rage with its opposite extreme -- a 
visionary certainty, the return to an age of gold through a cyclical process in 
which we recapture innocence, "the vector of greed withdraws" and there is a 
"restitution of lost things." 
</P>
<P>
We are to make what we will of this middle section. The "Four Classic Texts" 
are thrust between Parts One and Three, and we must supply the connection for 
ourselves. What I think is implied is that his composite protagonist has been 
moved out of the earlier quiet and rational despair into a full-bodied 
irrationality, of crazy angers and equally crazy hope, which are at least signs 
of energy, of not surrendering to the presence with the darkened face. 
</P>
<P>
So that when in the last part we return to the original speakers, though they 
are still old and in the same world, they are changed -- enabled. The brushes 
with craziness have released them from their inertia. They still live in the 
present, but now they live in it fully. No longer "unfit/to work or love," they 
now find joy in both -- 
</P>
<P>
 When my body shook again with the body's passion, 
</P>
<P>
 it was impossible only because I expected nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 -- and a proposition is reversed, in a kind of echo of John Donne's "The Sun 
Rising": "A bed is the world," inclusive, and receptive to possibilities. The 
polysyllabic ironies from earlier in the poem are replaced by praise, not only 
of blossoms and old lilacs but of "fried Spam and onions on slices of Wonder 
Bread." 
</P>
<P>
What Hall achieves in this third part is an extraordinarily complex 
presentation of the grounds for joy, difficult enough to describe at any time, 
a joy that has nothing in common with complacency, for it is active, 
intelligent and completely aware that it is to be ended by death, which in fact 
helps to define it. The rage and satire have been worked off, but the promise 
of a cyclical return is in its way kept. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first Sunday of every month we assemble 
</P>
<P>
 molecules of Jesus from their diaspora, 
</P>
<P>
he says, while a few lines farther down: 
</P>
<P>
 When the rain drives on the poppies they hold bright petals to the rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Raindrops recur and disappear, as the molecules of Jesus disappear and recur. 
There is one day: Past and future are contained in the present of the one day 
as the whole world is contained in the one bed. Everything is present at the 
same time: 
</P>
<P>
 The tomcat plays with his mother, sucking and teasing; he cuffs 
</P>
<P>
 his mother's jaw. The tomcat limps home in the bloody 
</P>
<P>
 morning, ear torn. The tomcat sleeps all day 
</P>
<P>
 in a portion of the sun, fur tatty over old scars, pulls 
</P>
<P>
 himself to the saucer of milk, and snores going back 
</P>
<P>
 to sleep, knowing himself the same. The kitten leaps 
</P>
<P>
 in the air, her paws spread like a squirrel's. 
</P>
<P>
 The beauty of this writing is not merely in what it says, that the stages of 
our lives are in some way co-existent, but in the way it so actively is what it 
says, in the specifics of the cat and in the pacing of those specifics. The joy 
and the acceptance are neither glib nor unexamined. 
</P>
<P>
Among his numerous prose books, Hall has written at least one, "Remembering 
Poets" (1978), which is of permanent value, not only for its observant memoirs 
of Dylan Thomas, Frost, Eliot and Pound but also for the brilliant way he moves 
from them into his reflections about the nature of poetry itself. He says: 
</P>
<P>
poetry attempts ... to add old or irrational 
</P>
<P>
 elements to the light of consciousness by 
</P>
<P>
 means of language, which is the instrument of consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 The poet thus adds unreason to reason, "making a third thing." It seems to me 
that this describes well what Hall has done in "The One Day": Mere reason was 
combined with mere irrationality and the two in combination produce the refined 
and alert awareness, the late spring, of the third part, a life going through 
the same processes as a poetry. 
</P>
<P>
And this poem, as a whole, may indeed be seen as the synthesis of a whole 
life's work. It is one of those books, like Elizabeth Bishop's last collection, 
which alters the way we look at the jumbled contents of the poetic career 
preceding it, giving it retrospectively a shape, a pattern, a consistency it 
didn't seem to have at the time.

THE LIONS OF JUDAH IN THE JUNGLE OF HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN ZIPPERSTEIN, Zipperstein is associate professor of Modern Jewish 
History at UCLA. He is the author of The Jews of Odessa (Stanford University 
Press) and his biography of the Zionist thinker Ahad Ha'am will be published 
next year.

"Giving chicken soup to Cossacks" is how Lillian Hellman acidly characterized 
the reaction, craven in her view, of the movie industry's Jewish moguls to the 
machinations of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC). One by 
one these wizened tycoons -- whose brutality, calculated risk-taking and sheer 
shamelessness were already, by the early 1950s, the stuff of legend -- 
capitulated without even token resistance to an anti-Communist campaign with 
anti-Semitic overtones that, as Neal Gabler shows, eerily substantiated fears 
that had accompanied them ever since they transformed their empire of 
back-street nickelodeons into Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood was created by a remarkably homogeneous group of Central and Eastern 
European Jewish men. Their desire to remake themselves, extinguish their pasts 
and transcend the hostilities of the old world and the more subtle ones of the 
new fueled their all-but-insatiable ambitions to rule, to patronize and to 
assimilate. Hollywood, their magic kingdom, was created, Gabler tells us, to 
provide an imaginary, and tragically tenuous, haven in what they never ceased 
to feel was a heartless world. 
</P>
<P>
Readers of Yiddish and Hebrew literature of the late 19th and early 20th 
Centuries already will be familiar with figures resembling Paramount's Adolph 
Zukor or Columbia's Harry Cohn: men whose reactions to the poverty, 
marginality, and impenetrable intergroup resentments of Eastern Europe would 
make them into victims, and then monsters of retribution and resentment. 
Victims are by no means inevitably saintly, the "grandfather" of Yiddish 
literature, Mendele Mochor Seforim, knew well, and catastrophe unleashed 
unsavory, sometimes truly hateful passions. A considerably more sanitized 
version of the East European Jewish past was eventually, and quite 
successfully, promulgated in America, and Gabler's admirable book illuminates, 
among many other things, an otherwise neglected feature of European Jewry's 
desperate, fearful transmutations of the last century. 
</P>
<P>
A nasty, mutually antagonistic coterie of "furriers" is how they were 
frequently called by their (often justifiably) resentful actors, writers, 
technicians and bankers who saw their rise from the prototypically Jewish 
trades to the incomparably glamorous movie industry to be jarring, even 
inexplicable. Yet at the time when these would-be moguls, some prescient and 
others just uncannily lucky, first embarked on their careers -- typically 
haphazardly, as one of various ways to make a buck in an unfamiliar, often 
hostile turn-of-the-century America -- the movies they promoted were but brief, 
low-status entertainments for working men and women. 
</P>
<P>
It was they who transformed the primitive moving pictures, the products of very 
recent technical advances by Edison and others, into America's most popular 
entertainment form by the early 1920s. Nickelodeons were replaced by movie 
palaces, (sufficiently opulent to satisfy the escapist needs of the working 
class and to capture the respectable middle class) short flicks expanded into 
features, their obscure players made into stars, and eventually, by the late 
1920s, their visual pleasures enhanced immeasurably by sound. 
</P>
<P>
The men responsible for all this had no special technical expertise, little 
literacy, typically a spotty command of English, and not much money or 
prestige. Indeed, had they come from the right side of the tracks they probably 
never would have found their way into the dives that featured the first penny 
movies that they so dramatically transformed. What they did have, by virtue of 
their experience in the clothing trade, was a practiced sense of what 
constituted popular taste, a willingness, even a hunger, to take chances, keen 
merchandising skills, and an ability to mediate and shape the preferences of 
disparate groups. In their first few years in the movie business they lost big 
sums and moved from good addresses to dismal ones without losing face, friends 
or confidence. (This would change when they reached the top.) And they entered 
the industry (a term they coined and preferred) with an insatiable, restless 
need to win, an abiding sense that a poor man was a broken man and that they 
could only make their way in a Gentile world by bringing it to their feet. 
Their heirs, not surprisingly, lacked their combativeness and their talent; 
these were the products of unhappy pasts so different from those spent in the 
considerably more benign California climate to which these moguls moved once 
they began to produce, merchandise and distribute their increasingly lucrative 
and prestigious films. 
</P>
<P>
They moved to Los Angeles because the weather allowed shooting movies 
throughout the year. In what is one of the book's best sections, Gabler 
describes the content of their daily lives. Never since Fitzgerald's "The Last 
Tycoon" has this feverish, grittily competitive, strangely cloistered 
("Suddenly Stahr could think of no place . . . Where did people meet?"), and 
irredeemably exhausting routine -- one in which even leisure time was spent in 
endless hours of competition involving gambling, horse racing and womanizing -- 
been told as fully and convincingly. Their family lives were publicly pristine 
but, in fact, typically vacuous, authoritarian and distant; their friendships 
were usually based far more on utility than sentiment. Adolph Zukor relaxed, 
and then only rarely, among Hungarian-born Jews like himself, and he was sure 
to limit his intimate circle to men without clout or influence who consequently 
could gain nothing professionally from the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
As one Los Angeles producer recalled: "There used to be a kind of floating 
Jewish population. We'd go to Palm Springs. We'd go to Coronado. We'd go to 
Pebble Beach and Arrowhead Springs and Arrowhead Lake . . . They'd go down on 
Saturday afternoon and come home on Sunday night, and they'd stay overnight and 
play cards. . . . They never discussed anything. They just played cards." 
</P>
<P>
In their movies -- which they influenced, Gaber suggests, more than their 
directors did -- they projected images of an America that were wholesomely 
domestic (Louis Mayer's forte) or stylish, continental, witty -- a congenial 
place where people like themselves would be treated as full, honored members 
and which did not exist beyond their vaulted studio sound rooms. Ethnicity they 
eschewed, except for the Warners, who proved an exception to most of these 
rules. Jews as film characters they believed were unsaleable; as actors they 
were rendered virtually unrecognizable until HUAC publicized their original 
names. (Julius Garfinkle was made by Hollywood executives into John Garfield, 
Emmanuel G. Goldenberg into Edward G. Robinson.) 
</P>
<P>
When Garfield protested his new name, which he pointed out was the name of a 
President, and countered, "You wouldn't name a goddam actor Abraham Lincoln, 
would you?" he was told, "No, kid, we wouldn't, because Abe is a name that most 
people would say is Jewish and we wouldn't want people to get the wrong idea.") 
</P>
<P>
Accusations that this was a Jewish-dominated industry (by 1936, 53 of the 85 
producers in the United States were Jews) were, the moguls hoped, muted by 
their efforts to ensure that neither their movies nor their lives retained any 
of the residual influence of their European past, which they attempted to 
expunge ferociously. They voted Republican when nearly all Jews were Democrats; 
they loathed Roosevelt when Jews elsewhere worshipped him; their comments about 
the suffering of Jews (even during the horrors of World War II) testified to a 
fatal combination of repression and insensitivity, though in this instance 
again Harry Warner stood out as unusually humane and responsive. 
</P>
<P>
They understood, as Carey McWilliams wrote in the late 1940s, that "Jews have 
been excluded from participation in the basic industries of the country, the 
industries that exercise a decisive control over the entire economy. . . . 
Generally speaking, the businesses in which Jews are concentrated are those in 
which a large risk-factor is involved; businesses peripheral to the economy . . 
. businesses which have traditionally carried a certain social stigma, such, 
for example, as the amusement industry and the liquor industry." Never did the 
moguls cease to fear that they would be robbed of what they spent a lifetime 
building, by virtue of the ramblings of xenophobic ministers, hostile members 
of congress, the plots of east-coast Gentile bankers, envious west-coast 
competitors, or the Communist activities of their hapless writers. 
</P>
<P>
A source of solace and inspiration, oddly enough, was their rabbi, Edgar Magnin 
of Wilshire Boulevard Temple -- a man superbly suited for his role as spiritual 
mentor to an insecure but relentless elite who sought the assurances of a rabbi 
as long as he substantiated their rather base inclinations. Magnin was 
charismatic, dogmatic and a source of endlessly facile, often crass, homespun 
wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
He was as shrewd as any of his powerful Hollywood congregants and the scion of 
Central European Jews (in fact very rich ones) whose status was immeasurably 
greater than that of the Eastern ones who had spawned the moguls. 
</P>
<P>
He was no less preoccupied than they with the need to assimilate and, except 
when it came to the espousal of virulently xenophobic patriotism, he avoided 
discussion of values, social issues or even personal ethics. Magnin, a good 
example of how the People of the Book have produced even rabbis who are wholly 
unbookish, enabled his elite to believe that their deracinated, assimilationist 
and bullish way of life was precisely what America expected of them. 
</P>
<P>
How these men worked out their existential dilemmas in their movies is at the 
core of Gabler's book, and his observations on this score are speculative, 
probably inevitably so. They were, as he demonstrates, drawn to the movies by 
chance but they remained, he says, in part because of the way in which this 
medium helped resolve (or so it seemed) tensions that they never managed to 
overcome intheir own lives. Speaking of "The Jazz Singer," that historic 
milestone which launched movies with sound, Gabler suggests that this movie in 
particular but film in general provided the moguls with a way to navigate 
between tortuously conflicting demands: "The movies, after all, are a world of 
possibility where anything can happen, and of all the themes in 'The Jazz 
Singer,' this might have been the most important and the most telling for 
theHollywood Jews. The movies can redefine us. The movies can make us new. The 
movies can make us whole. And this is precisely how the Hollywood Jews would 
use them." 
</P>
<P>
Our story ends unhappily. In the end, they were left with precious little: 
divested of their Jewish wives, their Jewish pasts, having discharged many of 
their Jewish writers and executives during the hateful McCarthy years, 
friendless in a milieu (shaped largely by them) where status was made and 
squandered within the span of minutes, and lost in a raw and empty city devoid 
of anything resembling the urban cultures they had known in their youth. Once 
their companies were gobbled up by Coca Cola or Warner Communications, or taken 
from them in corporate maneuvers, they came to resemble, rather uncannily and 
despite their wealth, that faded mogul Schwartz in Fitzgerald's novel whose 
suicide at the book's beginning prefigures the tragedy that eventually 
envelopes its protagonist Monroe Stahr. Once rich, now poor, and consequently 
desperate, Schwartz was "obviously a man to whom something had happened. 
Meeting him was like encountering a friend who had been in a fist fight or 
collision, and got flattened. You stare at your friend and say, 'What happened 
to you?' And he answers something unintelligible through broken teeth and 
swollen lips. He can't even tell you about it." 
</P>
<P>
They created a universe of abiding images. And even if Coca Cola came to 
control much of what they built, their classic works were colorized in a 
flourish of rapaciousness of the sort familiar to the movies' creators, and 
eventually Hollywood was made into a far more complex place than their 
feudal-like domain, their legacy nonetheless remains potent. It is jarring to 
speculate that the images of America that most animated Ronald Reagan, as his 
biographers have amply demonstrated, were drawn more readily from the 
assimilationist fantasies of Louis Mayer and others than they were from 
anything even vaguely resembling American reality. Dorothy, Auntie Em, Andy 
Hardy were more real to him, and remain more real to many others, than do the 
main streets and alleys of America's cities. What can better attest to the 
potency of these tycoons? 
</P>
<P>
The most potent image that this reader was left with upon closing this 
excellent book, and one not suggested by Gabler himself, was of 
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's roaring lion, the ferocious symbol of the biggest of the 
studios. Can this lion, growling at Mayer's audiences before each and every 
screening, have been inspired, however unconsciously, by the lion of Judah, 
among the best-known symbols of a culture that shunned representative art? Be 
that as it may, Gabler's book provides a new and provocative gloss on our most 
important, certainly our most pervasive, art form, and its study of the wages 
of 20th-Century American Jewish assimilation is subtle, wise, and humane. This 
original book is popular history at its best.

"Memory has its own story to tell. But I have done my best to make it tell a 
truthful story," Tobias Wolff writes in the acknowledgement page of his 
splendid "This Boy's Life: A Memoir." But memory does not always tell a 
"truthful story," and Wolff exemplifies this immediately: " . . . my mother 
thinks that a dog I describe as ugly was actually quite handsome." This 
dichotomy is extended in the book's epigraph, from that master of artifice 
Oscar Wilde: "The first duty in life is to assume a pose." 
</P>
<P>
Life and art melded for Wilde, and all biography assumes a pose. To assert that 
it is possible to re-create more than an approximation of another's life, even 
one's own, may require the most enormous leap into willing suspension of 
disbelief. Fiction is more "truthful." With unabashed honesty, it admits: This 
is an invention that I'm going to try to convince you is true. 
</P>
<P>
By choosing the form of the memoir, Wolff keeps within the boundaries of his 
own "truth" -- its chronology and geography, its protagonists, and what he 
remembers experiencing. But he gives his book its unique life by employing 
fully his talents as a fiction writer: He writes in language that is lyrical 
without embellishment, defines his characters with exact strokes and perfectly 
pitched voices, creates suspense around ordinary events, locating deep mystery 
within them. 
</P>
<P>
This juxtaposition produces surprising effects. At times a childhood memory is 
left as the boy may have experienced it: Tina, a pregnant 15-year-old girl, is 
seen as "one of a pack of hysterically miserable girls who . . . did their best 
to catch the attention of boys who would be sure to use them badly." He 
confesses he "felt no pity" for her. Cruel? Yes. Wolff is here being 
unflinchingly true to the cruelty of childhood. 
</P>
<P>
At other times, as writer, he locates the point of origin for future 
understanding, even redemption. When the boy is caught stealing gasoline from a 
poor family, he refuses to apologize: " . . . there was no difference between 
explanations and excuses . . . excuses were unmanly. So were feelings." That 
was the boy. This is the writer: "Everything I saw thereafter forced the 
knowledge in deeper. These people . . . were near the edge, and I had nudged 
them that much farther along . . . Returning the gas didn't change that. The 
real harm was in their knowing that someone could come upon them . . . and 
pause to do them injury. It had to make them feel small and alone, knowing 
this." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Wolff -- he resumes Tobias only toward the end -- is no ghostly memoirist; 
he is a living character. Seeing himself in a mirror while wearing the 
unfamiliar clothes of prep school, the "I" of the boy surrenders to the "he" of 
the emerging writer: "The elegant stranger . . . regarded me with a doubtful, 
almost haunted expression . . . looking for a sign of what lay in store for him 
. . . He took a step forward, stuck his hands in his pockets, threw back his 
shoulders and cocked his head. There was a dash of swagger in his pose." 
</P>
<P>
The book follows the boy from age 10 to his teens as he and his mother travel 
-- "restless, scheming, poised for flight" -- from Florida to Utah to 
Washington State, through major and minor catastrophes, and very few joys. 
</P>
<P>
A child roams through the world of adults like a spy gathering evidence for 
future meanings -- and encountering much mystery. There is much mystery in 
Wolff's book. Just as in life, it often is left unsolved. Sister James, "a 
woman of passion," is Jack's catechism teacher. When he cannot bring himself to 
confess to a testy priest, she takes the boy aside and blithely tells him her 
own childhood sins -- she was a "backbiter" who stole from her father. Back in 
the confessional, the boy recites her sins as his. A few days later she slips a 
letter under his apartment door, for his mother. The boy opens the letter and 
learns that the nun wants Mrs. Wolff to call her. About what? Jack burns up the 
note. "I never saw her again." Like many others in the book, this perfectly 
nuanced interlude could stand alone as a gem of a short story. 
</P>
<P>
By conveying an experience with urgent immediacy, Wolff leaves judgment to the 
reader. Silver, the son of a cantor, is "an only child, clever, skinny, 
malicious, a shameless coward." With Jack and another boy, he watches 
television news clips of what an announcer identifies as the ugly time of "the 
little Fuehrer and his bullyboys." Yet the admonitory voice accompanies images 
that "celebrate snappy uniforms and racy Mercedes staff cars and great 
marching, thousands of boots slamming down together . . . while banners 
streamed overhead and strong voices sang songs that stirred . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, Silver is wearing a Nazi armband, telephoning people with 
Jewish-sounding names and screaming at them in "pig German." When he and his 
two friends bombard a car with eggs thrown from a roof, Silver becomes enraged 
"as if he had been the one set upon and outraged . . . he leaned over the edge 
. . . and screamed a word I had heard only once . . . 'Yid!' Silver screamed." 
Wolff leaves the reader to draw the inevitable conclusion: that Silver has, 
indeed, also been "set upon and outraged." 
</P>
<P>
Wolff is at his best when he explores complex, even contradictory characters. 
Dwight, his stepfather, is absurd and cruel. Once started on a room, he cannot 
stop painting a whole house white, even its furniture. He is obsessed with 
weapons and their props: "To spot the game he never got close to he carried a 
pair of high-powered Zeiss binoculars. To dress the game he never killed he 
carried a Puma hunting knife." Insisting that Champion -- the dog that may be 
ugly or handsome -- is a good hunting dog, he orders it to fetch a stick. The 
dog merely barks at it. "Smart dog," Dwight concludes. "Knows it's not a bird." 
</P>
<P>
Dwight ponders for hours how to refine his tortures of the boy. He takes Jack 
on life-threatening drives, laughing to show he isn't afraid. He leaves the 
adult Wolff a terrible legacy: "We hated each other so much that . . . it 
disfigured me . . . I hear his voice in my own when I speak to my children in 
anger. They hear it too, and look at me in surprise. My youngest once said, 
'Don't you love me any more?' " So powerful is this voice that Wolff has 
explored its various tones in his best fiction. 
</P>
<P>
Wolff's satirical humor shines here. Jack and his friends dutifully pant after 
Annette Funicello: "As soon as she appeared . . . Taylor would start moaning 
and Silver would lick the screen." Suddenly children again, they surrender to 
the mesmerizing mindlessness of the Mickey Mouse Club: "Taylor forgot himself 
and sucked his thumb." 
</P>
<P>
Wolff drowns Lawrence Welk, a favorite of Dwight's, in his own Champagne 
bubbles: Dwight "leaned forward as the bubbles rose over the Champagne 
Orchestra and Lawrence Welk came on-stage salaaming in every direction, crying 
out declarations of humility in his unctuous, brain-scalding Swedish kazoo of a 
voice." And perhaps no one has more accurately captured the exalted silliness 
of the Boy Scouts, their tidy education for precise heroism, exact 
catastrophes. 
</P>
<P>
Wolff accomplishes what every child yearns to do, to get even with stultifying 
adults by entombing them forever in a book. Mr. Mitchell, civics teacher, goes 
about sniffing out conflict between boys for his regular "grudge-matches." Miss 
Houlihan insists that elocution has to do with " 'reaching down' for words as 
if they were already perfectly formed in our stomachs." She exhorts stupefied 
children to "simply let the words 'escape' . . . Reach down, reach down." 
Horseface Greeley, shop teacher, drops a 50-pound block of iron on his foot to 
show off his "Tuff-Top shoes, which had reinforced steel uppers." 
</P>
<P>
Wolff employs his mastery of details and mimetic dialogue to strengthen the 
reality of his memories: "Gulls strutted on the railing outside, shaking their 
feathers and turning their heads at us. The air was rich with the smell of 
chowder. Sunlight gleamed on the silver, lit up the ice cubes in our glasses, 
made the tablecloth bright as a snowfield." If those are not the details memory 
retains, they donate richness to its re-creation. 
</P>
<P>
Here's Dwight instructing Jack on how he approached a fight: "I went over to 
this guy, but not acting tough, okay? Not acting tough. Acting more like, Oh 
gee, I'm so scared, please don't hurt me . . . So I came over to him and in 
this little scaredy-cat voice I say, Excuse me, what's the problem?" That is 
not the exact language memory recalls, but it is the expert dialogue of a fine 
writer. 
</P>
<P>
Wolff structures events into mini-epics: Will the subtly crafty, nervous woman 
who may have encouraged Jack to cash a fraudulent check entrap him -- even 
following him along the streets, to an alley? Will a return match with Arthur 
-- a boy who prances magnificently in gay defiance but beats Jack up for 
calling him a sissy -- deal Jack another defeat when featured in one of Mr. 
Mitchell's gruesome "grudge matches"? 
</P>
<P>
In the area of sex, so central to boyhood, Wolff is honestly dishonest with the 
boy of his memory. Like other boys his age, Jack brags about himself as a 
"make-out artist." But he gives no evidence of that, obscures all sexual 
matters: " . . . that's another story," he shrugs, hoping we won't notice -- 
and Wolff chooses not to challenge him. 
</P>
<P>
There is no sentimentality in Wolff's book, no trace of self-pity, no 
psychological jargon about childhood scars. Without resorting to symbols that 
would compromise the verisimilitude of his remembered childhood, he can create 
a sense of meaningful but undefined eeriness: A beaver Dwight ran over and 
abandoned in the attic is found two years later: "covered with mold . . . white 
and transparent, a network of gossamer filaments that had flowered to a height 
of two feet . . . like cotton candy but more loosely spun . . . The mold had no 
features . . . but its outline somehow suggested the shape of the beaver it had 
consumed: a vague cloud-picture of a beaver crouching in the air." 
</P>
<P>
To the rich fiction of childhood that ranges from "Huckleberry Finn" to 
"Catcher in the Rye," Wolff has contributed his superb memoir, his "truthful 
story."

PEACE: A BIOLOGICAL IMPERATIVE FOR PRIMATES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTYANN KEVLES, Kevles is a science writer whose most recent book is 
Females of the Species (Harvard University Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "Peacemaking Among Primates," Frans de Waal calls attention to an important 
but recently overlooked perspective in ethology, the study of the evolution of 
behavior. A relatively new science, ethology incorporates theories of behavior 
that go back at least 200 years, when scientists first looked to the natural 
world for a blueprint of the social contract, the basis for human behavior. 
Since then, they have moved from the picture of man as a "noble savage," born 
into an Eden and then corrupted, to the post-Darwinian vision of man as another 
animal subject to fierce competition for limited resources in order to survive. 
</P>
<P>
On a January day in 1880, a different view came to the attention of Peter 
Kropotkin, known historically as the ideologue of anarchism, when he heard 
about a lecture presented at the Russian Congress of Naturalists by a 
well-known zoologist, who suggested that besides the law of mutual struggle -- 
species locked in a gladiatorial battle for existence -- there was a 
corresponding and even more important law of mutual aid. Three years later, 
Kropotkin read the same suggestion in Darwin's "The Descent of Man" and set to 
work collecting data, which he published, in 1902, as "Mutual Aid," a chronicle 
of cooperative behavior in the progressive evolution of the species. 
</P>
<P>
Kropotkin reissued "Mutual Aid" in 1915 in order to set the record straight. He 
insisted that the war then destroying civilization as he knew it was not 
inevitable. People cooperate even under siege, he argued: Witness the peasant 
women who thrust bread and apples into the hands of German and Austrian 
prisoners as they trudged through the streets of Kiev. Mutual aid, he asserted, 
is a necessary correlative of competition among social animals, including human 
beings. 
</P>
<P>
But this optimistic view of nature did not win much favor as the 20th Century 
continued with wars and genocide expanded to levels previously unimagined. 
Biologists and ethologists, along with psychologists and sociologists, sought 
the roots of this violence in the evolutionary past. 
</P>
<P>
The roots were not hard to find. Violence is dramatic and easy to document. 
Tracking hostile behaviors in other species fulfilled the expectations of those 
who read these acts as a genetic necessity, a selection of evolution. However, 
while aggression is a successful adaptation among other species, it becomes a 
fatal flaw in humans who still react instinctively, hair standing on end, 
adrenaline flowing, to hostile movements, responding with nuclear weapons 
instead of sharpened canines. 
</P>
<P>
The late Konrad Lorenz, an Austrian ethologist of enormous stature, observed 
that an animal must be aggressive to compete successfully, and he reasoned that 
aggression has biological roots. This concept, which he explored in "On 
Aggression," published in English in 1966, inspired a generation of scientists. 
Perhaps as an effort to universalize the atrocities of the war he had lived 
through in Germany, Lorenz defined aggression as the starting point of all 
social relationships. Aggression inspires hierarchy, community, and among 
non-human species controls the dispersion of resources. But among humans, he 
asserted, it is out of control. As a species we have run amok because we do not 
have the inhibition to control our aggressive instinct. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenz's work was followed by a spate of books and articles testifying to the 
biological, hormonal and psychological basis of aggression in human beings. The 
consensus seemed to be that we come equipped with a runaway instinct, one that 
suited our ancestors on the savannah, but in the world of advanced weaponry 
seems to doom us to extinction. 
</P>
<P>
Awash in this news about the aggressive nature of animals in general and 
primates in particular, ethologists such as Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey began 
to document intra-species killings, even cannibalism, among those apes we had 
all learned to love because of their gentle nature. 
</P>
<P>
De Waal rejects this pessimistic and one-sided picture of the human 
predicament. "Peacemaking Among Primates" can be seen as a delayed, and 
infinitely more sophisticated, sequel to Kropotkin's attempt to describe with 
scientific accuracy the centripetal forces that keep societies together as well 
as the centrifugal ones that drive them apart. It also is an elucidation and 
expansion of Lorenz's views, accepting the reality of aggression but positing 
it as only one side of the coin. 
</P>
<P>
De Waal is both a revisionist and an optimist. Indeed, he concedes that 
primates fight. But at least as often they avoid clashes that could lead to 
fights; and when they do fight, they make peace with their adversaries so that 
the community continues as before. He documents this assertion with detailed 
studies of five primate groups including chimpanzees, macaques and human 
beings, using data he has meticulously collected over more than a decade. He 
confirms in the idiom of a modern ethologist what Kropotkin could only surmise: 
that mutual aid has enabled primates to evolve complex and viable social 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
De Waal demonstrates that science can be like poetry: Once a truth is stated, 
our vision shifts and we cannot imagine how we did not see it before. We join 
De Waal in the public observation post at Arnhem Zoo in The Netherlands, above 
the largest colony of chimpanzees in captivity. De Waal knows each individual 
by name and personality (and has already written about them in an earlier book, 
"Chimpanzee Politics"). Familiar with their frequent fights, he realized in a 
moment of inspiration that their conflicts always ended in reconciliations that 
left most relationships repaired and normalized. Along with his colleagues, he 
had been blind for years to what had been happening before their eyes. Thus he 
began to study the nature of reconciliation, of peacemaking among these 
chimpanzees. 
</P>
<P>
From the chimps at Arnhem, he went on to study peacemaking among rhesus and 
stump-tailed macaques at the Wisconsin Regional Primate Research Center where 
he is now a research scientist; among bonobos (pygmy chimpanzees), in the 
unique group at the San Diego Zoo; and among human beings. He discovered 
similar patterns of peacemaking among the five groups of primates. He also 
discovered a blindness among other scientists to the study of peacemaking. He 
describes a world- renowned psychologist, a specialist in human aggression, who 
grew irritated at the suggestion that evolution has anything to do with 
explaining behavior, and had not even considered the possibility that conflicts 
are inevitable among people because aggression has a long evolutionary history, 
and that reconciliation is worth studying because it is logical to expect the 
co-evolution of powerful coping mechanisms. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that psychologist will read his book. The evidence is overwhelming that 
we share with other primates the mechanisms for fighting, but also the need for 
friendship, support, body contact and even sexual activity as a social 
function, and to get these we, too, have evolved mechanisms for face-saving, 
for compromise, for consolation and for reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
Until now -- and this is the heart of his message -- most scientists have 
believed that violence is more integral to human nature than peace. In reality, 
he demonstrates, we have highly developed strategies for consolation and 
reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
De Waal brings a new perspective to a discipline that has been dominated in the 
English-speaking world by self-consciously detached observers as well as by 
those who see animals as a gene's device to reproduce itself. De Waal also 
rejects the approach that science starts with a battery of hypotheses which are 
dispassionately tested. He points out that Darwin didn't set sail to test a 
theory. Rather, he returned with the ingredients to make one. 
</P>
<P>
Theory never takes precedence over his personal observations, one of which led 
him to reject the extrapolation of the famous crowded-rat experiment to the 
human condition. In this experiment, caged rats that were pushed closer and 
closer together eventually went mad and turned cannibal. But De Waal notes that 
vervet monkeys crowded together simply avoid eye contact and look at the sky 
and ground a lot. The same could be said for his countrymen who, while living 
in one of the most densely packed nations on earth, enjoy low crime rates and a 
high degree of personal tolerance. Primates are one thing, rats another. 
</P>
<P>
As a Dutchman, de Waal also is especially careful about English, the way a 
person must be whose native language is not the lingua franca of any major 
discipline. He distinguishes carefully between the words "aggression" and 
"violence," the latter being the most extreme but not the most common form of 
the former. He also distinguishes between "consolation," the act of support by 
a bystander to the victim of a hostile encounter, and "reconciliation," 
peacemaking between the actors in the encounter. 
</P>
<P>
De Waal's observations are wide-ranging, surprising and invariably provocative. 
With increased knowledge of primate behavior, he worries about the ways some 
zoos isolate these highly social creatures. From observations that male 
primates participate in acts of reconciliation more frequently than do females, 
he wonders if males are generally more conciliatory than females, and 
speculates on the differences between the sexes in our own species. 
</P>
<P>
This gracefully written book is unabashedly political, referring frequently to 
contemporary issues to make a point. Concerned about survival, De Waal in 1986 
signed the Seville Statement which asserted that "Biology does not condemn 
humanity to war." But unlike the other signatories, who felt that we could rise 
above our biological destiny (through intelligence, one supposes, and 
restraint), De Waal believes it is that very biological heritage that provides 
us with the mechanisms of reconciliation which he urges us to develop. We are 
creatures of evolution, and have arrived where we are because we are able to 
control and channel our aggressions. Peacemaking is not only desirable, it is, 
in a sense, evolutionarily prescribed.

This big, elaborate volume traces the history of the Caped Crusader from his 
first appearance in issue No. 27 of Detective Comics through Tim Burton's hit 
film. "Batman" underwent numerous shifts in tone, graphic style and content 
over the decades: The earnest crime fighter of the early '40s bears little 
resemblance to the cynical, aging loner in Frank Miller's '80s graphic novels. 
Mark Vaz chronicles these transformations with the affection of a devoted fan, 
but offers little serious analysis or criticism. Lavishly illustrated with film 
and television stills, as well as comic-book pages and covers, "Tales of the 
Dark Knight" will delight comics fans.

A collection of short, pungent essays from 1949 that are less about food than 
people's attitudes toward food. M. F .K. Fisher reflects on great meals, 
terrible meals and the popular misconceptions of what constitutes good cooking. 
The few recipes she includes sound horribly fatty by today's cholesterol- and 
calorie-conscious standards, but Fisher probably would dismiss those qualms 
about fine food as unworthy caviling. The book's charm lies in her 
straightforward, delightfully self-assured style: At just over 200 pages, it's 
a minor gem that belongs in the library of anyone who likes to cook -- or eat.

TV NEWS: IS SEEING BELIEVING?;

SIMULATIONS AND NEW TECHNOLOGY HAVE BROUGHT MAKE-BELIEVE TO NETWORK NEWS. BUT 
THEY MAY BLUR TV'S BEST ASSET -- REALITY.

<P>
The woman on the train said she didn't hate Deborah Norville. She just felt bad 
for Jane. 
</P>
<P>
You know, Jane Pauley is so sensitive, she said, such a good mother. And, the 
woman said, she didn't really know Norville, Pauley's replacement on NBC's 
"Today" show, at least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
Her seatmate nodded understandingly. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, of course, the woman had confused television with reality. She had 
never met Pauley or Norville. 
</P>
<P>
But this intellectual sleight of hand is the central magic of television news. 
The images on the screen look real, and so people believe them to be real. That 
is why Americans say they have seen John Kennedy's funeral, the Challenger 
disaster or men walk on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, many researchers believe television news is at a crossroad, 
technologically and journalistically. Increasingly, the TV images on which this 
trust is based can be manipulated -- or manufactured. 
</P>
<P>
And depending on the choices television makes today, viewers may soon conclude 
that seeing is no longer believing. 
</P>
<P>
Pressured by economics, and the success of so-called tabloid-TV shows featuring 
news re-creations, the three major networks are looking for new ways to tell 
stories, and increasingly the distinctions between entertainment and news are 
blurring -- particularly on a spate of new prime-time news magazines that use 
docudrama, news simulations and audience participation. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, television news is acquiring new tools that make it easier to 
alter and create video images. One NBC news magazine regularly superimposes 
correspondents into scenes where they never actually were, using the same 
technology used to make Superman fly in the movies. 
</P>
<P>
And such technology is advancing rapidly. Last year engineers from Pixar in San 
Rafael, Calif., won an Academy Award for a short video starring a baby who was 
entirely generated by computer. 
</P>
<P>
"Fifteen years ago, I could not put on my newscast something that I had not 
heard or seen or recorded, unless it was something that an artist might have 
sketched," said Walter Porges, vice president of news practices at ABC. "Now I 
can create pictures and sounds to go with them that never happened. And that 
opens up all kinds of ethical moral problems for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
What are the implications of all this? The answers go well beyond whether it is 
journalistically responsible to simulate news. 
</P>
<P>
On the simplest level, substantial scientific evidence suggests that even if 
simulations are carefully labeled, viewers will remember them as real, 
confusing TV imagery with actual events. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts warn that Americans over time will come to see their primary 
medium for news, which currently has a high level of credibility, to be suspect 
-- hardly better than advertising. If so, TV news could be tampering with its 
greatest strength. 
</P>
<P>
Others think staged news and simulated images are part of a larger social 
change in which real events generally are being subsumed by synthetic ones. It 
has already occured, they say, in political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Nonsense, say those involved in the experimental programs. The good or evil of 
these techniques depends on their use. 
</P>
<P>
But all agree that simulated and altered news images are more than a fad, and 
television must begin to develop a new set of ethics to handle them -- much as 
medicine must wrestle with such technology as genetic engineering. 
</P>
<P>
Change in television news is nothing new. The medium is far different from when 
Douglas Edwards first read radio copy on camera for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
The most important difference, say news executives, is the march toward better 
pictures. Where once anchormen held up still photos on camera, now viewers get 
live video from anywhere in the world instantly. 
</P>
<P>
One result, some newscasters believe, has been the diminution of the 
journalist. Many say that while TV journalists like Dan Rather are certainly 
celebrities, today they are more narrators of pictures than authoritative 
figures interpreting unseen events. Who has the prestige of Walter Cronkite, 
whose on-air comments about Vietnam convinced President Lyndon B. Johnson that 
public support for the war was lost? 
</P>
<P>
"You are getting a lot more coverage and a lot less journalism, a lot more show 
and a lot less tell," said Lawrence Grossman, former president of NBC News. 
</P>
<P>
Even network executives like Robert Siegenthaler, president of Broadcast 
Operations and Engineering at ABC, worry that better visuals "have 
de-emphasized the words, and concomitantly the thought. . . . There is a fall 
off in the communication of understanding. The audience is in video overload," 
unable to retain all the pictures. 
</P>
<P>
If the move toward better pictures in the early 1980s was rooted in the 
improved technology of video and satellites, the current move toward new ways 
of telling stories is grounded in the declining economics of network 
television. 
</P>
<P>
As cable television and independent stations proliferated, offering more than 
just reruns, the networks saw their share of the prime-time audience shrivel 
from 92% in 1978-79 to 67% this year, Nielsen Media Research reports. The 
network oligarchy was dying. The old way of business was failing. And by 1986 
new owners had taken control at all three networks: Capital Cities 
Communication at ABC, General Electric at NBC and hotel magnate Lawrence Tisch 
at CBS. 
</P>
<P>
Their mandate was to cut costs and find new ways to attract audiences -- news 
suddenly was going to have to turn a profit. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Ronald Reagan Administration's deregulation of television 
eliminated one of the major purposes of the network news divisions, to provide 
public service broadcasting that would keep the Federal Communications 
Commission off their backs. 
</P>
<P>
The perfect model for news in this new world was CBS News' "60 Minutes." For, 
blessed with talent, an original format and a time slot pitting it against 
Sunday children's shows, it became a news show with entertainment-sized ratings 
in prime time -- and subsidized the rest of the news division. 
</P>
<P>
The allure was powerful. Prime-time magazines such as "60 Minutes" were more 
profitable because they were cheaper to produce and the networks owned them 
outright, while communications regulations mandated that most entertainment 
programs come from outside producers. 
</P>
<P>
ABC succeeded with "20-20." CBS tried to attract younger audiences with "West 
57th Street." And then came the rise of so-called "reality programming," or 
Tabloid TV, initially produced by non-network producers called syndicators. 
News-as-entertainment shows, such as "America's Most Wanted," "Unsolved 
Mysteries," "A Current Affair" and "Hard Copy," demonstrated that big audiences 
could be had by staging news-style dramatizations. 
</P>
<P>
Soon network entertainment divisions were producing such programs, too. And 
this year all three networks added new hourlong prime-time magazine news shows 
that borrow the techniques of entertainment. "Saturday Night With Connie Chung" 
on CBS and "Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow" on NBC both use actors in 
re-creations. "Prime Time Live" on ABC involves participation by a live studio 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
All three networks gave their producers more freedom to experiment with these 
prime-time formats, from the conviction, deeply held, that to succeed in prime 
time, newscasters must tell stories in new ways. 
</P>
<P>
But simulations are not the only innovations. Other techniques of entertainment 
programming in general are being mixed with news -- giving rise to 
"info-tainment," or what some have called TV's New Journalism, a reference to 
the blending of fiction and nonfiction writing techniques newspapers explored 
in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot produce a prime-time TV program the way you do a Sunday morning 
(news magazine) program," said Sid Feders, executive producer of "Yesterday, 
Today and Tomorrow." "People want to be entertained more, they want their 
attention held more." 
</P>
<P>
And the search for new ways to tell stories is also a matter of technology. 
</P>
<P>
Feders' program regularly alters news images by superimposing correspondents on 
scenes, even if they never actually were there. The machine used, called the 
Ultimatte, mates two images so cleanly that the alteration is not detectable to 
the viewer. It even adds the correct shadows. 
</P>
<P>
Another machine, the Paint Box, allows producers to change the image's colors, 
to add or delete objects from the image, or to turn video images into sketches. 
</P>
<P>
Other machines can make objects spin, expand or shrink, add animation to video, 
change the focus, or obscure the faces of anonymous sources. 
</P>
<P>
And there is more to come. 
</P>
<P>
In laboratories and universities around the world, computer researchers are 
working on the science of simulating reality. 
</P>
<P>
"The state of the art now is we can simulate man-made things realistically," 
said Alvi Ray Smith, co-founder and executive vice president of Pixar, the San 
Rafael company that is one of the leaders in the field called computer-aided 
visualization. 
</P>
<P>
Images of buildings, furniture, machines and automobiles, moving and stationary 
-- anything made by humans -- can be simulated to the point that they are 
indistinguishable from reality. 
</P>
<P>
Simulating plant life is getting closer, researchers say. A company in France 
is starting to sell plant models on computer to architects. 
</P>
<P>
Simulated images of animals and humans are harder. 
</P>
<P>
Pixar made its first significant attempt this year by simulating a baby in "Tin 
Toy," the Oscar-winning video, which appears to be halfway between a cartoon 
and a photographic movie. 
</P>
<P>
But researchers say the technology is not yet there to simulate physiology. 
Pixar had to create 40 sets of muscles just for the baby's face. 
</P>
<P>
"The skin doesn't fold quite right," said Smith. "We still weren't close enough 
to reality to claim it was a real baby." 
</P>
<P>
The new technology has potential to improve television news, especially 
covering topics the medium once found difficult, such as science or economics. 
</P>
<P>
When a plane crashes, for instance, the Paint Box makes it possible to 
immediately create an animation from federal records of what happened. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the new techniques also argue that so-called reality programming 
is reaching audiences that otherwise would not watch news. "If you simulate 
socially significant things that otherwise people would be missing, you might 
be doing a service," said Doris A. Graber, professor of political science at 
the University of Illinois at Chicago and author of "Processing the News." 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Lack, executive producer of "Saturday Night with Connie Chung," said he 
is "much more concerned that all we show them (on the news) is Mexican bus 
crashes" than he is that networks are looking for new kinds of stories and 
formats. 
</P>
<P>
But the machines also carry obvious potential for deception. 
</P>
<P>
ABC News, for instance, used some of this technology when it staged a picture 
of someone playing the part of suspected spy Felix S. Bloch handing over a 
briefcase to a supposed Soviet agent. ABC technicians added a digital time code 
to the corner of the faked photograph to make it look more like a real 
surveillance photo. 
</P>
<P>
And, privately, television staffers admit other indiscretions. NBC News 
employees tell of one editor who regularly "sweetens" boring footage with bird 
sounds he has collected. That occasionally brings a letter from some astute 
birding enthusiast complaining of a bird heard singing in the wrong habitat. 
</P>
<P>
But potential transgressions could be much more serious. "If I were a budding 
dictator and I wanted to influence the minds of the people of the small island 
of X," Siegenthaler said, he could simulate television images "to make the 
current opposition leader look bad. If drinking were forbidden, I could make 
him look like he was coming out of a bar." 
</P>
<P>
Many critics, of course, have opposed all re-creations of news events. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to be a journalism school fuddy-duddy to wonder if CBS News 
hasn't invaded a realm from which it might better exclude itself," Washington 
Post TV critic Tom Shales wrote after the debut of Connie Chung's show. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps seeing the issue as an ethical debate over simulations misses the 
point. This is more a matter of economics and technology. 
</P>
<P>
"It is like genetic engineering," Siegenthaler said. "You can tell the doctors 
not to mess with genetics, but, in point of fact, science marches on. 
</P>
<P>
"In the same way, the Ultimatte will be a cleaner clip, so more easily 
inserted, the Paint Box will get cleaner." 
</P>
<P>
What is needed, most argue, is a new set of rules for the new era of 
television. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these tools are sort of neutral and it depends on their use," said ABC 
media critic Jeff Greenfield. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect we will go through a whole period where we exploit this technology 
to the hilt, until we get to the point that we develop some proper standards," 
said Smith of Pixar. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, the ethics are sketchy. NBC News President Michael Gartner has 
issued rules that re-creations be restricted to prime-time magazine shows. They 
are not to appear on the nightly news. 
</P>
<P>
But former NBC correspondent Ken Bode asks: "Once you say you are no longer a 
virgin, what's the difference? What Gartner is doing is offering a lofty 
rationale for slipping standards." 
</P>
<P>
All three networks also assure audiences that any simulated, animated or 
re-created images will be carefully labeled. 
</P>
<P>
But some who have studied the impact of television believe that these new lines 
being drawn fail to account for how television actually works. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, scientific research shows that people soon forget and confuse 
where they saw news. "We have known since the 1950s that source and message 
divorce over time," said Kathleen Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School of 
Communications at the University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, people tend to remember things as coming from more credible sources 
than they really did, in part because they don't like to think of themselves as 
manipulated. 
</P>
<P>
Hence, if people remember simulations, "it is a reasonably good guess" people 
will believe "they had seen the real McCoy," said Graber of the University of 
Illinois at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, researchers believe that labeling simulations and issuing verbal 
warnings probably won't change that. Research shows that people process visual 
images separately and less critically than written or spoken information. 
</P>
<P>
The result, said Jamieson, is that "people believe what they see even if you 
put a notice up saying it's simulated." 
</P>
<P>
In the short term, "people will believe a lot of things that are not real," 
Jamieson said. 
</P>
<P>
And in the long term, some believe, television news could be tampering with its 
most precious power -- the sensation, clearly identified by research, that 
people believe television to be real. 
</P>
<P>
"People believe it because they think it is actually happening," said Shanto 
Iyengar, a professor of political science and communication at UCLA and 
co-author of "News that Matters." If info-tainment, simulations and simulated 
reality become commonplace, the effect would be to weaken "that exalted status" 
Iyengar said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are risking their credibility," Jamieson said of television news in 
general. "If you deceive the American audience, they ultimately will come to 
question news." 
</P>
<P>
Already, audiences make clear distinctions in the way they perceive different 
kinds of television, researchers said. They regard advertising with great 
skepticism, for instance, and view some kinds of news, such as foreign affairs, 
as more important and persuasive than others, such as celebrity interviews. 
</P>
<P>
But other researchers have less faith in the viewing audience and believe that 
the confusion over what is real will deepen. 
</P>
<P>
"Increasingly, Americans are going to be unable to tell the difference between 
reality and illusion," said Jack Solomon, a UCLA professor and author of "The 
Signs of Our Time," a study of semiotics, or social symbols. 
</P>
<P>
"We live in a commercial culture whose main job is to sell things. It is 
spilled out into politics and it is now spilling out into the news." 
</P>
<P>
And some see this debate over effects as overheated speculation. 
</P>
<P>
On one level, said Smith of Pixar, "the act of editing (videotape) is already a 
corruption of reality. . . . Once you are willing to rearrange time with 
editing, why not rearrange space a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the debate in television news is not over simulating reality at 
all, but over values. 
</P>
<P>
Producer Feders is fond of quoting Bob Wright, the president of NBC. "He says 
you cannot set a table and then serve food that is so unappetizing that it 
drives them away." 
</P>
<P>
Don Hewitt, the respected executive producer of "60 Minutes," believes the 
decisive factor in TV news' future is not the journalists but the owners. He 
notes, for instance, that TV stations owned by major newspaper companies have 
helped popularize news re-creations by airing tabloid TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
And he was particularly upset, he said, when CBS' flagship station in New York, 
which is network owned, bumped "The CBS Evening News" from 7 p.m. to the 
lower-rated 6:30 p.m. time slot to make room for "USA Today on Television." 
When "USA Today" bombed, it substituted the tabloid TV show "Hard Copy." 
</P>
<P>
"If the pressure comes from the top, I think what will happen is the nature of 
the people who work in the business will change," Hewitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Even the vice president of standards at ABC, Porges, sounds uncertain at times: 
"I would hate to think I wasted 35 years trying to be right."

JAILHOUSE INFORMANT SAYS HE LIED AT 3 MURDER TRIALS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A veteran jailhouse informant whose testimony helped send three Los Angeles 
County men to prison for life terms now says he lied at their murder trials at 
the urging of police. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Jesse Cisneros, a convicted arsonist, kidnaper and rapist serving a 
70-year prison term, says he perjured himself when he testified that all three 
men confessed to him. 
</P>
<P>
In sworn statements to a private investigator and in a subsequent interview 
with The Times, Cisneros says that, all told, he lied in five Los Angeles 
murder cases at the behest of police. In the remaining two cases, he says he 
testified falsely at preliminary hearings that two more men confessed. 
</P>
<P>
One of those men is still awaiting trial. He faces a possible death penalty if 
convicted. The other pleaded guilty to a lesser charge -- being an accessory to 
murder -- and was sentenced to prison for three years. 
</P>
<P>
Cisneros thus becomes the first jailhouse informant to admit under oath that he 
fabricated confessions in specific murder cases since an informant scandal 
surfaced in Los Angeles County last year. 
</P>
<P>
The scandal broke when another veteran informant demonstrated how easily he 
could fake confessions, but he balked at being specific without a grant of 
immunity. 
</P>
<P>
The consequences of Cisneros' recantations are uncertain. One defense attorney 
has used them to file court papers seeking his client's freedom. Another is 
considering an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The officers whom Cisneros has accused deny his charges, but the Los Angeles 
Police Department has started an internal affairs investigation in one case as 
a result of a Times inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors involved in the cases contend Cisneros' retractions are irrelevant 
because they had enough evidence to convict the defendants without his help. 
Defense lawyers dispute this. 
</P>
<P>
Cisneros says he is now admitting to being a liar because he wants to ease his 
guilty conscience and because he is angry. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason I am changing my statement," he said, "is because all these D.A.s 
and officers that work with the snitches are doing it to make themselves look 
better, and at the end they screw the snitches. And there is a lot of people, 
innocent people, in jail." 
</P>
<P>
Cisneros was in and out of jail and prison for years before he was finally put 
away for the 70 year term as the "Los Angeles Riverbed Rapist" who abducted at 
least eight illegal alien women from 1980 to 1985 by posing as an immigration 
officer. He handcuffed the women, and raped and sodomized them near the Los 
Angeles River before letting them go. 
</P>
<P>
He was a police informant while behind bars and on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Whether he is telling the truth now -- or whether he was telling the truth on 
the witness stand -- is impossible to say. Two psychiatrists years ago told 
judges -- and the district attorney's office -- that Cisneros was a compulsive 
liar. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors who used Cisneros to testify to confessions purportedly made to him 
said they were unaware of these psychiatric evaluations. Because of a lack of 
information-sharing within the district attorney's office, some prosecutors 
said they were unaware that Cisneros had been an informant in any case other 
than their own. 
</P>
<P>
Cisneros recanted his testimony about the murder confessions in sworn 
statements to a private detective who interviewed him recently in prison. The 
detective, Sue Sarkis, took along a court stenographer, who placed Cisneros 
under oath and transcribed their talks. Sarkis made the transcript available to 
The Times. 
</P>
<P>
During an interview Friday at Folsom state prison, Cisneros repeated in detail 
the account he gave to the private investigator and added to it by describing 
another case in which he said he had lied. 
</P>
<P>
In the case in which his testimony probably had the most impact, Cisneros had 
told the court that Carlos Herrera Vargas confessed to him over drinks at a 
Montebello bar that he had accidentally killed a young woman. 
</P>
<P>
During a conversation about why Vargas had not attended a fund-raiser to 
benefit the dead woman's child, Cisneros testified that a drunken Vargas 
blurted out that "he didn't mean to kill her. It was an accident. It just 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Cisneros says he was lying. He says Vargas never admitted responsibility 
for the killing. Cisneros says that a Montebello police officer, Robert 
Crawford, paid him $150 -- and offered him help on his own criminal case -- to 
say that Vargas confessed. 
</P>
<P>
Vargas was convicted of the attempted rape and first-degree murder of the young 
woman and was sentenced to prison for 29 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford, the Montebello police officer, responded to Cisneros' allegations by 
saying: "In no way would myself or (my partner) ever advise an informant to 
lie. . . . Also . . . I never paid him a dime." 
</P>
<P>
"I think I gave him five bucks once and that was all," said Crawford's 
then-partner, Sgt. Herbert Albert. "Five bucks and a couple of packs of 
cigarettes." 
</P>
<P>
Other evidence against Vargas consisted of a pubic hair found on the victim's 
chest, which an FBI expert testified matched characteristics of the defendant's 
hair, but which the expert would not say was "probably" that of the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
Still other evidence was a second reputed confession by Vargas to an informant. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Larry Walls, said in an interview that there 
was ample other circumstantial evidence to convict Vargas without the 
informants' testimony. 
</P>
<P>
However, the judge at Vargas' trial, Alexander Williams III, said at the trial 
that the informant testimony was very important and "possibly critical." 
</P>
<P>
Despite its importance, Judge Williams kept from the jury information that the 
second informant had admitted privately that he had lied. 
</P>
<P>
The second informant, Leo Zendejas, testified that Vargas confessed to 
murdering the woman. 
</P>
<P>
However, Zendejas' attorney, Joseph Gutierrez, reported to the court that 
Zendejas had told him privately that Vargas had never said any such thing. 
</P>
<P>
Vargas' attorney then wanted to call Zendejas' attorney as a witness to 
discredit Zendejas, but the judge wouldn't let him. Zendejas had objected to 
his lawyer testifying, claiming that any statement he made to his own lawyer 
was protected by the doctrine of lawyer-client confidentiality. Judge Williams 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Williams later appointed Sarkis, the private investigator, to look into the 
conviction on behalf of Vargas' appellate lawyer, James R. McGrath. McGrath 
recently filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Williams' court, 
seeking his client's freedom on the basis of Cisneros' recantation. A hearing 
on the petition has not yet been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
In a second case that resulted in a life term, Cisneros testified he was in a 
hospital jail ward in February, 1985, when Donald Clayton Massengill was 
brought in for treatment of seizures from heroin withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
Massengill had been arrested the day before on suspicion of murdering a woman 
who had supplied him with heroin and housing in exchange for his services as an 
escort. Police said Massengill had already confessed to them that he had killed 
his landlady with a machete. Police also had a witness to the killing -- 
someone who also worked for the landlady. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Cisneros. Cisneros testified at Massengill's trial that Massengill did 
not exactly confess to killing his landlady; he confessed instead to murdering 
a male dope dealer with a machete. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Burton Schneirow contended in an interview that Massengill 
distorted his story of the murder because admitting that he killed his landlady 
would have sounded wimpy. 
</P>
<P>
Cisneros' account, Schneirow said, "showed a macho type of guy who was too 
embarrassed to tell what he really did but was bragging about some phony 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
In his recantation, Cisneros said that two Los Angeles County sheriff's 
homicide detectives, whose names he could not recall, had supplied him with 
that story -- a charge that sheriff's homicide Capt. Robert Grimm denied. 
</P>
<P>
Alhambra Police Detective Jim Varga, who also investigated the case, suggested 
that Cisneros' recantation didn't make sense. Varga suggested that if police 
had decided to plant information, they would have planted the correct 
information -- that Massengill had killed his landlady. 
</P>
<P>
Questioned Friday about the apparent illogic, Cisneros said: "I don't know what 
the logic of it is. That's what they told me to say. . . . They pulled me out 
of here and took me back to court. I got on the stand and they convicted him. 
They told me my statements helped convict him." 
</P>
<P>
Cisneros also testified at that trial that Massengill told him he had arranged 
for the killing of a witness against him. 
</P>
<P>
Massengill's appellate attorney, Sharon Wrubell, said she thought that was 
particularly damaging and may have helped the jury conclude that Massengill was 
capable of the planning necessary for a first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a real question here" whether the killing of the landlady was 
first-degree murder or the lesser crime of manslaughter, the appellate lawyer 
said. "If the jury had believed that because of drugs or alcohol that 
Massengill could not form malice aforethought and specific intent to kill, they 
could have found him guilty of manslaughter." 
</P>
<P>
Massengill is serving a term of 26 years to life for first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
Wrubell said she is weighing an attempt to reopen the case, although previous 
appeals have been denied. 
</P>
<P>
In a third trial, Cisneros said Friday he lied at the behest of Los Angeles 
County sheriff's detectives when he testified that he heard James Darrell 
Shortt confess to a murder while both were on a jail bus en route to a court in 
Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
Cisneros said that he could not recall the detectives' names but that they 
visited him in jail a day after the bus trip. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they've been trying to get Jim Shortt on that case and they checked 
to see who was on that bus and then they found me," he related. "They came and 
they showed me some paper work. They told me what went down and they told me 
what to testify to." 
</P>
<P>
Shortt, whose two co-defendants also testified against him, was convicted of 
murdering a man he kidnaped and robbed and was sentenced to prison for life 
without possibility of parole. Cisneros also testified at the preliminary 
hearing for Harold Hall, who is awaiting one trial for two murders and a second 
for five more. 
</P>
<P>
Cisneros testified that Hall admitted to him in a courthouse holding cell that 
he had killed a girl in his neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
In his recantation, Cisneros said that Hall only told him he knew some things 
about the girl's death. 
</P>
<P>
Cisneros said he and another veteran informant, Willie Battle, conspired with 
Los Angeles police detectives to make up Hall's confession. 
</P>
<P>
Battle has told The Times previously that he has always testified truthfully. 
</P>
<P>
Cisneros said in the recantation that Battle called Los Angeles Police 
Detective Mark Arneson from jail. "We told him what we knew. And they changed 
the statements around to where it suited them, and we made a case," Cisneros 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They told us what to say," he said, "that Harold Hall and his boys picked up 
the girl, took her to the alley, raped her and killed her and set her legs in a 
funny position." 
</P>
<P>
Cisneros added: "When it came down to it, they (the authorities) screwed me and 
gave Willie Battle the deal. All I got out of it was $25 and cigarettes now and 
then." 
</P>
<P>
Court records show that Battle indeed got a deal. Deputy Dist. Atty. Patrick 
Dixon told Superior Court Judge David Horowitz that he would recommend leniency 
-- "the main reason being that the defendant is a witness in a case I am 
prosecuting against Harold Hall." Horowitz then sentenced Battle to two years 
in prison for robbery, although the judge told Battle: "I believe you were 
facing . . . around 15 years in the state prison on this case. And given your 
record, it was probably amply justified to give you such a severe sentence." 
</P>
<P>
Informed of Cisneros' allegations, Arneson declined to comment, noting that 
Hall is still awaiting trial. Arneson's then-partner did not respond to a 
written request by The Times for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In the last case in which he has recanted, Cisneros testified at the 
preliminary hearing of Martin Victor Ramirez, who was accused of beating a 
neighbor to death in what police said was a gang-retaliation attack. 
</P>
<P>
In his recantation, Cisneros said Los Angeles Police Officer Bill Jones told 
him to lie and say that Ramirez had confessed at a jail hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Jones vehemently denied the charge. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez was never brought to trial. The district attorney's office elected to 
try his alleged accomplice before him. When two trials of the alleged 
accomplice ended in hung juries, both Ramirez and the alleged accomplice were 
offered deals. The alleged accomplice pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter 
in return for a sentence of three years which, when time for good behavior was 
computed, he had already served. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez pleaded guilty to being an accessory to murder and got three years, 
which he too had already served while awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
The LAPD's internal affairs division said it wants to talk to Cisneros about 
his allegations. 
</P>
<P>
In another case, Cisneros said he witnessed jailhouse informants conspire to 
frame a Compton man for murder. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Dykes had been arrested for possessing rock cocaine, and was placed in a 
part of the jail reserved for informants for his own protection, because he had 
told police he had witnessed a friend's murder. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dykes' cellmates, who were veteran informants, told police and later 
testified that Dykes confessed to murdering his friend. 
</P>
<P>
Cisneros said Dykes had in fact stuck to his story that he was merely a 
witness, and that the informants had turned it around. 
</P>
<P>
Cisneros' account, however, was called into question by his statement to the 
private detective, as reported in a transcript: "I was there when Kevin Dykes 
told the story. He told them . . . he saw a murder. He saw someone get killed 
-- shot." 
</P>
<P>
The problem was that the victim in the Dykes case had been stabbed to death. 
</P>
<P>
The Times did not tell Cisneros of this problem at first. When he was asked on 
Friday what happened in the Dykes case, Cisneros told The Times that Dykes had 
said the victim had been stabbed. 
</P>
<P>
Asked again if Dykes had said the victim had been stabbed, he repeated that 
that was the case. 
</P>
<P>
Then he was told that the transcript quoted him as having used the word "shot." 
He looked puzzled and responded emphatically, "Not with Dykes." 
</P>
<P>
Dykes was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 24 years to life. 
A hearing on his bid for a new trial, based on allegations that informants 
lied, is set for Tuesday in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Jailhouse informants are typically career criminals who claim to have heard 
confessions of other inmates, then try to trade their information for leniency. 
At any given time, Los Angeles County jails hold between 50 and 100 of them. 
For years, defense attorneys suspected that they fabricated confessions, but 
could not prove it. Then, nearly a year ago, one of them, Leslie Vernon White, 
demonstrated for his jailers that he could convincingly fake the murder 
confession of an inmate he had never met. Using a jail phone, he posed as a 
policeman to gather inside information about the murder from law enforcement 
agencies, then arranged a phony record to show that he had briefly shared a 
cell with the inmate whose confession he claimed to have heard. The 
demonstration led to a vast reduction in use of informants by county 
prosecutors and a state law requiring that juries be told to view informant 
testimony with suspicion, and has left a Los Angeles County Grand Jury 
investigation in limbo since the panel fired its special counsel, retired 
California Supreme Court Justice Otto Kaus, in a flap over his performance. 
Before his ouster, Kaus said the probe could lead to indictments of "a few 
people."

WE ARE READY, DISASTER TEAMS IN L.A. ASSERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In August, 1987, a little-known commission issued a scorching indictment of Los 
Angeles County's preparedness for a major earthquake: The county for years had 
neglected its obligation to coordinate the countywide response to the 
long-awaited Big One. 
</P>
<P>
Planning had been left to mid-level bureaucrats, the commission said. Some 
county departments had no emergency planners at all. The county Disaster 
Council rarely met, and most cities took no part in the county's, or even their 
neighbors', earthquake drills. 
</P>
<P>
"We just found tremendous gaps in the preparedness . . . and a tremendous lack 
of coordination," George A. Morrison, a member of the Emergency Preparedness 
Commission, said. "We really couldn't get the attention of the supervisors." 
</P>
<P>
The report -- and the October, 1987, Whittier earthquake -- rattled the county. 
The new chief administrative officer, Richard Dixon, began making preparedness 
a high priority. Over the last two years, Morrison and others say, Los Angeles 
County has made up for lost time. 
</P>
<P>
But the Oct. 17 Bay Area quake has refocused attention on Los Angeles: Would 
this county have risen to the occasion as the Bay Area apparently did? Or have 
this region's reputed powers of self-delusion left it ill-equipped to face down 
a massive disaster? 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County and city officials say they are optimistic. They say the 
county is as well prepared as the Bay Area -- perhaps better. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, emergency-management specialists have traveled north on 
reconnaissance missions in recent weeks, searching in Northern California's 
experience for weaknesses in Southern California's plans and how those plans 
might be improved. 
</P>
<P>
Among their findings: 
</P>
<P>
* Emergency communications systems in Los Angeles County need to be upgraded to 
allow for the possibility that not only telephones but radio systems may fail 
in a major quake. Satellite systems may be the only way to avert a 
communications breakdown, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
* The Bay Area experience underlined the need for a state-of-the-art "emergency 
operations center" from which to coordinate the countywide response. Los 
Angeles County is currently without an adequate facility; construction of one 
is scheduled to begin in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
* The phenomenon of liquefaction, or ground failure, must be restudied in light 
of the collapse of San Francisco's Marina District. Los Angeles city officials 
intend to consider whether new controls are needed on the kinds of buildings 
constructed on loose soil. 
</P>
<P>
* Southern California cities and counties must develop plans to accommodate the 
legions of volunteers who can be expected to offer their services in a 
catastrophe. Officials say they had not anticipated the degree of 
public-spiritedness that surfaced in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
* Los Angeles County has failed to achieve the degree of cooperation among 
cities that will be needed in a catastrophe, several officials said. Without 
that coordination, there can be no speedy assessment of damage after a quake, 
and no rational allocation of resources. 
</P>
<P>
"Mutual aid is greatly lacking as far as these smaller cities in Los Angeles 
County," said Lloyd J. Wood, the Azusa police chief and a member of the 
Preparedness Commission. "They just haven't pulled together. It's just, I 
think, general apathy on the part of the cities." 
</P>
<P>
"There's an old adage in business that people do well what they believe the 
boss is interested in," said one official who asked not to be identified. 
"Government people react to elected officials. Elected officials don't care. 
(Preparedness) doesn't get them elected." 
</P>
<P>
But many city, county and public utility officials insisted that they came away 
from the Bay Area not only impressed by its response to the 7.1-magnitude 
quake, but confident that Los Angeles County is equally ready to handle an 
emergency of even greater proportions. 
</P>
<P>
"I came away feeling that Los Angeles County is very well prepared," said 
Constance Romero, assistant manager of the county's Office of Emergency 
Management. "This county has done a great deal of work in the past two years. . 
. . I felt good." 
</P>
<P>
"What you will see are spots of brilliant staff work and excellent 
communication and . . . spots of poor staff work and poor communication," 
predicted Harry S. Hansen, another Preparedness Commission member, speculating 
on how Los Angeles County would respond to a major earthquake. "When they 
average out, what you will see is some successes and some problems. It's like 
any other kind of emergency." 
</P>
<P>
The gospel guiding each region's earthquake response is its emergency plan -- a 
series of massive, multivolume documents required by law and outlining who does 
what, and when, in the face of disasters ranging from a tsunami to a nuclear 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco's plan was last updated Sept. 29. The phone list of vital numbers 
was updated in October. Federal and state agencies, utility companies and the 
Red Cross have copies. So do all city and county agencies -- from the War 
Memorial trustees to the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-inch-thick document details the duties of every city department in an 
emergency. It includes all laws and regulations that can be invoked. There are 
drafts of orders, copies of mutual aid agreements and details for setting up 
shelters and assessing damage. 
</P>
<P>
It even includes a checklist for mass burials: Officials are reminded to remove 
teeth and collect and tag jewelry for later identification. Instructions on how 
to embalm a body quickly, and the importance of covering it before burial, are 
also included in the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is tested in a full-scale earthquake drill every April -- marking the 
anniversary of the city's 1906 quake. The Fire Department, the lead 
emergency-response agency, has been testing its communications system every two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
The plan appears to have worked well, San Francisco officials say. 
</P>
<P>
For example, within five minutes of the Oct. 17 quake, every piece of San 
Francisco Fire Department equipment was out of its garage. Within three hours, 
400 off-duty firefighters living outside the city had checked in and were 
reporting for duty. 
</P>
<P>
So many off-duty firefighters reported to work that every fire truck was 
carrying at least double its normal complement of workers within hours. That 
allowed the department to handle the Marina District fire and 26 others without 
calling in extra help. 
</P>
<P>
The average number of fires in the city is 13 in 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly we were tested and the response was magnificent," Mayor Art Agnos said 
in an interview. He said the public may be skeptical that government could 
design and carry out such a plan. "But it worked," he insisted. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, there were contingencies that the plan failed to anticipate. 
</P>
<P>
Among them, the onslaught of reporters at times created a distraction from the 
immediate crisis, Agnos said. City officials ended up calling newspapers and 
radio stations and asking that reporters and crews not interview workers 
engaged in rescue operations. 
</P>
<P>
City officials also found themselves forced to ban helicopter traffic over the 
Marina District after it appeared that vibrations from the innumerable choppers 
surveying the damage might increase the likelihood of damaged buildings 
collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
The city's plan also did not take into account the anger and desperation of 
residents informed that they could not return to damaged homes -- a reaction 
that Agnos describes as the "need to re-establish a connection with a house 
that is standing but yet is unsafe." 
</P>
<P>
"A person will say, 'My wedding ring is on that table by the window,' and 
they're ready to crash through a police barricade to get it," Agnos said. "What 
do you do? Shoot them down?" 
</P>
<P>
Some seat-of-the-pants decisions made after the quake will be part of future 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
Building-safety officials improvised a now-notorious system of issuing colored 
tags to identify safe and unsafe structures. That colored "pass system" will 
become a part of San Francisco's emergency plan -- and may make its way into 
Los Angeles County's as well. 
</P>
<P>
"That impressed me as a reasonable approach," Ken Weary, disaster services 
coordinator for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works, said in an 
interview. "I've asked people to add that to our plan. That could possibly be a 
lesson learned." 
</P>
<P>
But there were far more significant lessons for Los Angeles County, some 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco County consists only of the city of San Francisco, but Los 
Angeles County includes 85 incorporated cities. Although each city and town may 
have emergency-response plans, the county is responsible for overall 
coordination and for unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles has an elaborate, two-volume plan like San Francisco's, 
outlining each department's responsibilities. It also has its own emergency 
operations center, mobile communications equipment and regularly scheduled 
drills. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles city officials say their equipment is far superior to that of San 
Francisco and Oakland: They cite tractor-trailers, mobile command posts, and 
helicopters equipped with video cameras capable of transmitting pictures 
directly to the emergency operations center. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Shirley Mattingly, director of emergency management for the city, 
said, "We will be reassessing our entire plan, every area of it." She said the 
Bay Area quake has raised in particular the question of how to restore city 
services when city administration buildings are uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
"That's going to be a major problem," Mattingly said. "We had considered it, 
but we need to spend more time on it. We're not ready. The more that you have 
planned and practiced your plan ahead of time, the easier the response comes." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County, meanwhile, has its own 574-page plan outlining a system 
that has been upgraded dramatically in recent years. The Board of Supervisors 
recently approved funding for a new county emergency operations center to 
replace an inadequate, interim center. 
</P>
<P>
There are also plans to replace the county's existing disaster communication 
service -- a network of amateur radio volunteers -- with a system of computers 
capable of transmitting messages via portable radios in the event that 
telephone lines are down. 
</P>
<P>
Other improvements will include video cameras for Sheriff's Department and Fire 
Department helicopters, said Capt. Gary Snelson, commander of the sheriff's 
emergency operations bureau. Department communications are being improved, with 
new frequencies being added to the system. 
</P>
<P>
"We're heading in the right direction," said Snelson. "We've improved so much 
over the last three years that there isn't a lot else that we could do." 
</P>
<P>
But George Morrison, one of the architects of the county's emergency-operations 
ordinance, said the Bay Area's experience underlined the need for cooperation 
between political jurisdictions -- something many say has long been lacking in 
Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Without cooperation and mutual aid, it is impossible in an emergency to 
efficiently assess the extent of damage and to dispatch limited resources where 
they are most needed -- at freeway interchanges, bridges, petrochemical 
facilities and other crucial areas. 
</P>
<P>
"The media pretty well determined the focus of the earthquake response in 
Northern California because of their ability to get out and assess the damage," 
said Morrison, who stressed that he was not faulting the Bay Area's handling of 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result, resources were committed on the basis of media reports rather 
than the government's assessment of where the need was greatest," he said. Less 
populous but badly damaged areas, like Santa Cruz, attracted attention 
relatively late. 
</P>
<P>
Others said the Bay Area quake showed them the need for satellite 
communications systems in the event that telephone lines and radio towers are 
knocked out. Others suggested Los Angeles County could benefit by more heavy 
rescue equipment for search-and-rescue operations. 
</P>
<P>
Petty cash must be kept in the gas company's operating districts for covering 
expenses in the event of a massive quake, one gas company official said. One 
fire official said he was struck by how rescue efforts in the Bay Area strained 
Fire Department resources. 
</P>
<P>
Mattingly, director of emergency management for the city of Los Angeles, said 
the Bay Area quake reinforced in her mind the need for plans for long-term 
economic recovery as well as a new look at the risks of liquefaction. 
</P>
<P>
"We have done a lot in this city on unreinforced buildings," she said. "But I 
think we need to reassess what kind of construction is being allowed in the 
city on areas that we suspect may be subject to ground failure." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, officials concede, they can only guess how Los Angeles County will 
fare. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to understand that in Los Angeles County, you have an immense area, 
immense population and over 80 political jurisdictions, each with its own 
responsibilities," said Hansen of the county Preparedness Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"To try to meet the immediate effects of a major earthquake, in my opinion, is 
going to be extremely difficult no matter how well prepared we are," he said, 
"because the complexity of it exceeds anything I am aware of."

Scientists are certain that a major earthquake will hit Southern California 
sometime in the future, but they do not know precisely when or where it will 
strike. A Times Special Report, "Waiting for the Quake," provides a detailed 
look at the earthquake faults that criss-cross the Los Angeles area and 
examines two leading scenarios for a big quake. It also shows which freeways 
and key buildings are vulnerable, and tells how residents can prepare for the 
Big One. See Section Q.

REAGAN RECEIVES AWARD FROM AMERICAN JEWISH COMMITTEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES RELIGION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan was honored Saturday night in Beverly Hills by 
the American Jewish Committee at its annual Executive Council meeting for his 
defense of Jewish concerns in international affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The Committee presented Reagan with its American Liberties Medallion for moving 
the United States "to new heights of warmth and friendship" with Israel and 
enhancing "free trade and strategic partnership" between the two nations in his 
eight-year White House tenure. The award, at a Beverly Hilton dinner attended 
by nearly 1,000 people, came as the Jewish-rights organization debated at its 
five-day meeting whether a serious rift is growing between Israeli and American 
Jews over political and religious differences. 
</P>
<P>
In accepting the medallion, Reagan said: "Throughout my Administration a 
special friendship between Israel and the United States was a cornerstone of 
our foreign policy because of our shared moral values." In the quest for peace 
in the Middle East, he said, "courage and trust will be required" from both 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
Past recipients of the award have included President Lyndon B. Johnson, the 
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Henry Kissinger, Nobel Peace prize laureate Elie 
Wiesel and, most recently, West German President Richard von Weizsaecker. 
</P>
<P>
Although the American Jewish Committee had often criticized the Reagan 
Administration's cuts in domestic social programs, the New York-based 
organization complimented the ex-president Saturday for "his exemplary 
leadership in support of the State of Israel and lifetime commitment to the 
freedom of Soviet Jewry." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, who recently returned from a much-criticized, nine-day series of 
appearances in Japan that paid him $2 million, was not paid for his dinner 
appearance, Committee officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Producer-director Steven Spielberg, whose motion pictures include "E.T., the 
Extra-terrestrial" and "The Color Purple," was given the Committee's Mass Media 
Award at the dinner "for bringing film-making to new heights while faithfully 
maintaining artistic integrity and deep concern for human values." 
</P>
<P>
The 83rd annual Executive Council meeting, which ends today, was attended by 
nearly 300 people to discuss issues such as the impact of new immigrant 
communities on American life and the role of media in combating prejudices. On 
Friday, the council announced the formation of a Pacific Rim Institute in Los 
Angeles to combat signs of anti-Semitism in some Far East countries and to 
establish Jewish relations with growing Asian-American communities in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
One concern here was what a Saturday morning panelist called a "drifting apart" 
of Israeli and American Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish leaders generally agree on the primary friction points: the Israeli 
handling of the Palestinian uprisings and the unresolved "who is a Jew" 
question affecting non-Orthodox converts who emigrate to Israel and who are not 
totally accepted. The rabbis in Israel do not accept the validity of 
conversions by Reform and Conservative rabbis in other countries, a position 
that has drawn criticism from Reform and Conservative U.S. Jews. 
</P>
<P>
It is generally seen that differences have arisen because the Israeli 
government has moved to the right while the U.S. Jewish community remains 
mainly left of center in political and religious outlook. 
</P>
<P>
Arye Z. Carmon, president of the Israel-Diaspora Institute at Tel Aviv 
University, attributed part of the problem to "ultra-Orthodox bigotry and 
fundamentalism." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Rep. Mel Levine (D-Los Angeles) likened the strains between Israeli and 
American Jews to a long marriage. "It can never be good all the time," Levine 
said. He added, however, "we can't allow a divorce." 
</P>
<P>
Levine said he is not adverse to expressing misgivings over Israeli policies 
with candor -- "but privately, not publicly." 
</P>
<P>
However, the third panelist, Norman Podhoretz, the noted conservative editor of 
Commentary magazine, contended that "anxiety over a split is overdrawn." He 
said that American and Israeli Jewish relations are better than they were in 
the mid-1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Many U.S. Jews in 1948 held anti-Zionist views or at least were indifferent to 
the creation of the Jewish state at that time, Podhoretz said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defiant Lebanese parliamentary deputies gathered at a Syrian-controlled seaside 
town Saturday in a bid to counter Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun's decree dissolving 
Parliament. Aoun, the leader of Lebanon's Christian military Cabinet, is 
seeking to block election of a new president. 
</P>
<P>
By Saturday night, the test of authority remained unresolved. Twenty-seven 
deputies, almost all Muslims, had arrived in a column of cars from West Beirut 
at Qlaiaat, just south of Syrian territory on the Mediterranean coast. They 
were prepared to vote formal approval of a peace plan for their war-torn 
country. 
</P>
<P>
But about 28 others, most of them Christians, remained in Paris, forestalling a 
parliamentary quorum at Qlaiaat. A plane that was to have flown them to Qlaiaat 
never left the French capital, according to press reports from Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
(Late Saturday, Reuters reported from Paris that Speaker Hussein Husseini said 
he and the other deputies would return to Lebanon today and vote for a 
president at a time and location still to be announced.) 
</P>
<P>
Abdallah Rassi, one of the deputies at Qlaiaat, said the planned session had 
been delayed "for technical reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Salim Hoss, who heads a rival Muslim Cabinet in West Beirut, rejected Aoun's 
decree as illegitimate. "It is unconstitutional and void," he told reporters in 
Beirut. "This farce should be stopped by electing a new president." 
</P>
<P>
Another attempt to form a quorum of 49 of Lebanon's surviving 73 deputies -- 
all elected in 1972, three years before the civil war between Christians and 
Muslims broke out -- will be made today, supporters of the peace plan said. 
Parliamentary Speaker Husseini went to Paris to round up the missing deputies, 
who have been labeled traitors -- and are believed to be intimidated -- by 
Aoun's followers. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun summoned reporters before dawn to his shell-shattered presidential palace 
in the Beirut suburb of Baabda to hear his order dissolving Parliament. It was 
a move he had threatened for a week. 
</P>
<P>
He repeated his charge that the peace plan, hammered out by the deputies last 
month after three weeks of dogged bargaining at the Saudi Arabian mountain 
resort of Taif, does not guarantee Lebanese independence and sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
The general, wearing combat fatigues, appeared tired and disheartened, 
according to reporters at Baabda. He challenged the action of this Parliament 
by proposing election of a new one in a three-stage election in January. Of the 
current deputies, he said, "We sent them to Taif and gave them a chance to 
bring peace, but they brought back a charter of surrender." 
</P>
<P>
Aoun's Christian-led Lebanese army fought a brutal six-month artillery war 
against Syrian troops and their Muslim militia allies in the first half of the 
year to break what he calls Syrian control of his country. 
</P>
<P>
Approval of the Taif accord, strongly supported by the Arab League and outside 
powers such as the United States, France and the Soviet Union, is a "breach of 
the constitution that warrants dissolution of the Parliament," Aoun's 
three-member Cabinet declared in its decree. 
</P>
<P>
Other Christian leaders, including the influential patriarch of the Maronite 
Church, have called the Taif plan acceptable. The well-armed Lebanese Forces 
militia has not rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
So Aoun, who has earned support from both Christian and Muslim for his "war of 
liberation" against the Syrians, stands largely alone in opposition to the 
accords. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun's followers promptly called a general strike Saturday in Christian East 
Beirut. Stores and factories shut down, and Christian demonstrators drove 
through the otherwise quiet streets shouting deprecations against the 
parliamentarians. 
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has not had a president for more than a year, since Amin Gemayel's term 
ended without election of a successor by the Parliament. Accusations were laid 
against both Christians and Muslims for threatening deputies to prevent a 
quorum. 
</P>
<P>
Just before stepping down, Gemayel named Aoun, his army commander, to head an 
interim Cabinet. Aoun has interpreted the appointment to give him presidential 
powers. 
</P>
<P>
The Arab League-engineered cease-fire in September that ended the artillery war 
led to the long deliberations at Taif. There, under strong pressure, the now 
aged Christian and Muslim legislators approved a series of compromises designed 
to reform the outdated political system in Lebanon, which guaranteed Christian 
privileges in the face of a Muslim population majority. 
</P>
<P>
Under the reform plan, the president will remain a Maronite Christian, but his 
power will be diminished in favor of a strong prime minister to be chosen from 
the Sunni Muslim community. The Shiite Muslims, who by most estimates are the 
largest community in Lebanon, will retain the speakership of the Parliament, 
but the term will be extended from one year to four, increasing Shiite clout. 
</P>
<P>
Many Lebanese factions were unhappy with their share of the power to be 
assessed under the plan, but none opposed the overall package as strongly as 
Aoun. He demanded a firm timetable for the withdrawal of Syria's 40,000 troops 
in Lebanon in return for political reforms. 
</P>
<P>
But even the thin prospect for peace after 14 years of civil war was enough to 
win approval of the Christian parliamentarians at Taif. Most of them are now in 
Paris. A series of intimidation bombings at some of their homes and offices in 
East Beirut underscored their security concerns. An initial plan to meet at the 
Parliament building on the so-called Green Line dividing Christian and Muslim 
Beirut was abandoned in the tense atmosphere of the past few days. 
</P>
<P>
One Christian politician who did arrive in Qlaiaat was former President 
Suleiman Franjieh, 79, who headed the government when the civil war began and 
who was unsuccessfully promoted by the Syrians in the contest to succeed 
Gemayel last year. Franjieh kept his militia forces out of this year's 
conflict.

The chief of the KGB acknowledged Saturday that the secret police played a role 
in the cruelty and repression of the Stalin regime and vowed that such 
brutality would never happen again. 
</P>
<P>
"We bow our heads in memory of the innocent victims," Vladimir A. Kryuchkov 
said on national television. "This is a moral purification for us all and a 
guarantee that it will never happen again. Never." 
</P>
<P>
Kryuchkov made the admission in a speech at a Kremlin gathering in advance of 
Tuesday's anniversary celebrations marking the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
The speech was another step in the push by Kryuchkov, who became KGB chief a 
year ago, to partially lift the tight veil of secrecy over the feared secret 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Dictator Josef Stalin's cult of personality "distorted the institutions of 
Soviet power, and law enforcement bodies, including state security organs, were 
turned into a weapon of Stalin's arbitrary rule," Kryuchkov said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no justification for the mass repression and cruelty often inflicted 
on behalf of the revolution, the party and the people," the KGB chief said. 
</P>
<P>
The Stalin period of 1924-1953 now is widely criticized in the Soviet Union for 
the murder and imprisonment of millions of innocent citizens. The KGB has been 
among the last to acknowledge its part in the terror, much less on nationwide 
television during a celebration of the founding of the Soviet state. 
</P>
<P>
A subdued holiday parade is scheduled Saturday for Red Square. But, like last 
year, it will have less emphasis on a show of military power than it had in 
previous years. 
</P>
<P>
Signs on billboards for the holiday have been asking what citizens have been 
doing for perestroika (restructuring) rather than urging them forward to 
triumphs of socialism.

Iran marked the 10th anniversary of the seizure of the U.S. Embassy on Saturday 
by opening the compound to the public and displaying seven alleged CIA spies. 
Most Iranians ignored the event. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent disinterest was a blow to radicals who hoped to use the occasion 
to stir up anti-American passion. It was a victory for President Hashemi 
Rafsanjani, who wants to improve Iran's relations with the West and end his 
country's isolation. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 10,000 to 15,000 people gathered outside the one-time U.S. Embassy 
in Tehran, which was stormed by militants on Nov. 4, 1979. For 444 days, 52 
American diplomats and embassy personnel were held hostage there. They were 
finally released on Jan. 20, 1981, the day President Jimmy Carter left office 
and Ronald Reagan was sworn in as President. 
</P>
<P>
Even routine Friday prayer gatherings attract more people than Saturday's 
rally. Crowds at previous anti-U.S. rallies have been estimated at more than 1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The main speaker was former Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, 
Rafsanjani's main rival. It was his first public appearance since he was 
dropped by Rafsanjani when he formed his new Cabinet in August. 
</P>
<P>
Mohtashemi repeatedly referred to the animosity the late founder of the Islamic 
republic, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, harbored toward the United States. 
Khomeini died on June 3. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago today, when the students following the Imam's (Khomeini's) line 
seized the den of spies, the whole world marveled that the face of America was 
pushed in the mud," Mohtashemi said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that Khomeini was against any rapprochement with the "bloodsucker 
government of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd often interrupted to shout "Death to America!" and "Death to Israel!" 
</P>
<P>
They waved life-size portraits of Khomeini and his successor as spiritual 
leader of the Islamic republic, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. 
</P>
<P>
During a march to the embassy from Tehran University, a mile away, some 
protesters burned an effigy of Uncle Sam and about 160 U.S. flags, some with 
skulls in place of the field of stars. 
</P>
<P>
Banners vowing to "fight the U.S. until the last drop of our blood," hung from 
maple trees surrounding the compound, which now is used as a training base for 
young Revolutionary Guards. 
</P>
<P>
The seven alleged CIA spies appeared at a news conference in a corrugated iron 
hut next to the main embassy building. 
</P>
<P>
They said they were recruited by the CIA while abroad. 
</P>
<P>
One of the alleged agents, Bahman Aqaei, said he was recruited while working at 
the Iranian Embassy in New Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
Aqaei, the group's spokesman, said they had been trained in espionage 
techniques and promised as much as $1,200 a month, a small fortune in 
economically troubled Iran, but never received any money. 
</P>
<P>
He claimed he was recruited by an American Embassy official who put him in 
contact with a dissident Iranian group, which he did not identify. Others said 
they were recruited in West Germany and Turkey.

MAHATMA'S DISCIPLES WORK, PRAY FOR INDIA'S MORAL REVIVAL

SEVAGRAM, India 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mohandas K. Gandhi would be aghast to see his old neighborhood today. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a mile from the national shrine at the Sevagram Ashram, where Gandhi 
spent 12 of his last years developing the principles that made him India's 
enduring symbol of purity, simplicity and nonviolence, a pint of whiskey can be 
purchased illegally for 25 rupees (about $1.50), prostitutes sell their 
services for 50 rupees a night, lottery tickets go for half a laborer's daily 
wage and high-caste Hindus occasionally clash with the Untouchables to whom 
Gandhi dedicated his life to protect. 
</P>
<P>
But there is more. Soon there will be a steel plant in Gandhi's old back yard. 
</P>
<P>
The Indian government laid a foundation stone for the new steel plant in 
September despite a futile, yearlong drive by Gandhi's disciples to block it 
under Indian laws that bar the location of such factories near national 
shrines. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it seems, the only thing that remains unchanged at Gandhi's historic 
Sevagram Ashram is Haribau Shende, loyal servant of the Mahatma, as Gandhi was 
known to his followers. Shende still sits outside Gandhi's thatched-roof hut as 
he has every day since his master was assassinated by a religious fanatic 41 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Bapu's age is gone now," the toothless Shende sadly told a visitor recently, 
speaking of Gandhi with a word reserved for Indian saints. "Everywhere there is 
change in the way people are living. 
</P>
<P>
"Bapu has not taken anything with him. It is all still here. His things are 
here. His ideas are here. But, if the people do not want to follow them, what 
can be done?" 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to a nearby sign that lists what Gandhi called the Seven Social Sins, 
among them "politics without principles," "pleasure without conscience" and 
"science without humanity," Shende added: "Unfortunately those sins are still 
with us, too. 
</P>
<P>
"But what is to be done?" 
</P>
<P>
Four decades after Gandhi was instrumental in achieving India's independence 
from British colonial rule, the remaining handful of his disciples at Sevagram 
Ashram here in the heart of India concede that their nation has never been 
further from the principles he laid down. 
</P>
<P>
Political corruption is widespread and reaches into the highest levels. 
Consumerism and greed have penetrated every level of society. Religious 
fundamentalism is growing among the Hindu majority and the Muslim, Sikh and 
Christian minorities. And Gandhi's formula for a simple life of self-reliance 
has been replaced with dreams of owning color TV sets, videocassette recorders 
and imported luxuries. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought in the post-independence period, the government would work in the 
Gandhian model, but, of course, it did not," said Thakurdas Bang, president of 
the Sevagram Ashram Trust and a committed Gandhi disciple. 
</P>
<P>
"In general, the way we have been going for the past 50 years is toward more 
and more materialism and more and more consumerism in the name of science or 
technology or whatever. So now we face rampant corruption, unemployment and 
destruction of our environment, and, what is worse, the evil of drink is 
increasing tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
And the Gandhians, Bang conceded, are now in "a microscopic minority." 
</P>
<P>
"If humanity is to be saved in our country, Gandhiji will have to be 
resurrected," Bang concluded, using a respectful form of address. 
</P>
<P>
Bang conceded that resurrecting Gandhi's ideals will be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
One need not look far from Gandhi's ashram for a case in point. The steel 
plant, Bang said, is a classic confrontation between Gandhiism and progress in 
contemporary India. 
</P>
<P>
When the federal government endorsed a private-sector proposal to build the 
plant in the town of Wardha, which includes the Sevagram village ashram, Bang 
and other ashram trustees objected. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted only that the Indian government obey its own laws," Bang said, 
referring to statutes prohibiting industrial development within 15 miles of 
national shrines and monuments. 
</P>
<P>
But the government of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi paid little heed to the 
protests. Wardha is the home district of a key member of Gandhi's Cabinet who 
was sponsoring the project to provide jobs and win votes in time for this 
year's national elections. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Gandhians continued their fight. 
</P>
<P>
Threats and harassment soon followed. Sources confirmed that Bang and other 
trustees received death threats and, late last year, a fire was set near 
Gandhi's historic hut, apparently as a warning. 
</P>
<P>
To bolster local support for the plant, the government ordered an environmental 
study of the steel project, which showed that little pollution would result. 
And officials produced maps indicating that the plant actually would be built 
just a few feet outside the protected radius for historic sites. 
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the survey and the government's promise of new jobs, the majority 
of the residents supported the project. 
</P>
<P>
Alone in their resistance, the handful of Gandhians were forced to back down. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless the people are convinced in that direction, what is the point of an 
ashram or an individual taking up a position based solely on ideology?" Bang 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
Reminded that such a course was precisely the one chosen by Gandhi in 
British-ruled India, Bang readily agreed, adding, however, that despite their 
defeat in their own back yard, the Gandhian struggle is continuing -- even 
growing somewhat -- nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"Mind you, we are facing a huge tidal wave of hedonism," he said. "But there is 
the beginning of a small wave in India among intellectuals and even some common 
villagers to again turn to Gandhiji's model." 
</P>
<P>
As examples, he cited a continuing protest movement to stop a huge dam project 
in Gujarat state, where hundreds of villagers surrounded local government 
offices and barred officials for a week. 
</P>
<P>
Just 50 miles away from Sevagram, Bang added, hundreds of village women, 
angered by rampant alcoholism among the men there, traveled house to house and 
village to village, seizing and smashing liquor bottles in protest. 
</P>
<P>
In the eastern state of Orissa recently, the opposition in the state 
legislature protested a ruling party decision by spending the night on the 
assembly floor, facing a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi. 
</P>
<P>
And the Gandhian disciples themselves are, for the first time, endorsing 
"value-based" candidates this year in half a dozen parliamentary districts as 
an experimental, though largely symbolic, attempt to raise India's political 
consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
Still, when asked where Mohandas Gandhi would be in India today had he managed 
to survive all these decades, Bang shook his head and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sure," he said, "that Bapuji would again find himself in jail."

Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner on Saturday announced a pact with 
Japan that he said marks the "most dramatic expansion in air service between 
the two countries" in 37 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It opens new vistas in terms of travel, trade and tourism," Skinner said late 
Saturday after the agreement had been signed in Tokyo. Transportation 
Department officials announced the "agreement in principle" in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
David Prosperi, assistant secretary for public affairs, said the pact could 
increase current air service between the United States and Japan by 25% to 30%. 
Six U.S. and three Japanese carriers currently fly routes between the two 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
The pact provides for more passenger and cargo service between the two 
countries, new all-cargo services and special services for Alaska, Guam and 
Saipan, Prosperi said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosperi said U.S. and Japanese officials initialed the agreement after six 
days of negotiations in Tokyo.

Negotiations between the Boeing Co. and the Machinists Union broke off 
Saturday, with a union official calling the aerospace giant's offer to end the 
month-old strike and resume production an "insult." 
</P>
<P>
Mediator Douglas Hammond said that he decided to end the latest round of talks 
Saturday, but he refused to say what led to the breakdown in negotiations. No 
further talks were scheduled after six straight days of face-to-face meetings, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond said that both sides had worked hard to reach an agreement but 
ultimately they "continued to agree to disagree." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Baker, president of Machinists District Lodge 751, emerged from the 2 
1/2-hour session saying Boeing's newest offer was an "insult" and little better 
than the contract the union overwhelmingly rejected Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Larry McKean, Boeing's chief negotiator, said that the company had made a good 
proposal with adjustments to cost-of-living provisions and bonuses.

GIULIANI SHARPLY ATTACKS DINKINS' CHARACTER IN THEIR FIRST N.Y. MAYORALTY 
DEBATE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Former U.S. Atty. Rudolph W. Giuliani, as expected, sharply attacked the 
character and competence of his Democratic mayoral rival, David N. Dinkins, 
Saturday when the two finally met in their first debate. 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins countered by saying that New York City needs a mayor, not a prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
Giuliani went into the debate trailing in the polls, and analysts said he 
needed to score something close to a political knockout, which he apparently 
did not. Dinkins appeared poised and well briefed and was not flustered. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Henry R. Hewes, a Republican running on the Right to Life ticket, 
who was included in the debate over Giuliani's objections, even came to 
Dinkins' defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not happy that David did not pay his taxes according to the time schedule 
20 years ago, I'm sure he's not," Hewes said. "But you are talking about 
something that happened 20 years ago, and I have no doubts about David's 
integrity." 
</P>
<P>
"I think Henry and David are running almost like a ticket here," Giuliani 
countered. "The two of them seem to agree on everything." 
</P>
<P>
Giuliani accused Dinkins, the Manhattan Borough president, of engaging in a 
"cover-up" by not opening up the books of a company whose stock he transferred 
to his son. On a state form, Dinkins valued the stock in the Inner City 
Broadcasting Co. at $1 million-plus. 
</P>
<P>
The same year, on a New York City form, he listed the value of the stock at 
between $20,000 and $60,000. He transferred the stock to his son for a $58,000 
promissory note due by 1991, with interest, and has previously explained that 
the price he charged his son was consistent with the price the privately held 
company had offered to redeem its shares during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
"Open up the stock record books, let's see if that stock in fact was 
transferred," Giuliani challenged. He also charged that Dinkins' election 
filings were incomplete and that the borough president had concealed the 
business affiliations of contributors. 
</P>
<P>
"These are important issues. They go to character and integrity and honesty," 
Giuliani charged. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . People don't run for mayor of New York who have not paid their taxes," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
Two decades ago, Dinkins failed to file taxes for four years. He has apologized 
throughout the campaign and has said that all back taxes and penalties were 
later paid. No charges were filed against him. 
</P>
<P>
As he has throughout the campaign in an effort to rally Democrats, who 
outnumber Republicans in registration 5 to 1 in New York City, Dinkins sought 
to picture Giuliani as a captive of national Republicans. He charged they were 
hostile to the plight of the nation's cities. 
</P>
<P>
And seeking to undercut Giuliani's credentials as a crime fighter, he agreed 
that crime and drugs were the principal issues in the campaign, reiterating a 
pledge to place a police officer on every subway train. 
</P>
<P>
"Throughout this campaign I have tried to keep our sights fixed firmly on the 
challenges we will face in the 1990s, crime and drugs, housing, schools, AIDS, 
the environment all at a time of fiscal constraint. It will not be easy," 
Dinkins said. 
</P>
<P>
"These will be tough times and we will have good times too. I am asking you to 
make me mayor." 
</P>
<P>
The debate was held only three days before Election Day, and through long weeks 
of negotiations Giuliani's representatives had argued for a one-on-one 
encounter with Dinkins, who refused. But as the Democratic mayoral candidate's 
lead in the polls held steady, the Republican contender, who also is running on 
the Liberal Party ticket, finally agreed that Hewes, the Republican running on 
the Right to Life ticket, could be included. 
</P>
<P>
Hewes is given no chance of winning the election. The latest Daily News-Channel 
7 poll showed Dinkins leading with 53% to 39% for Giuliani.

Gov. George Deukmejian named 10 members of an independent Board of Inquiry 
Saturday, to investigate the collapse of Interstate 880 and the San 
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in the Oct. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The panel is headed by nationally known earthquake engineering expert George 
Housner, who was appointed earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Housner, who was appointed several days after the disaster, is the C.F. Braun 
Professor of Engineering Emeritus for the Caltech in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The Oct. 17 earthquake killed 65 people, including 41 in the collapse of a 
double-decker section of I-880 in Oakland known as the Nimitz Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The board will investigate the collapse of both I-880 and a section of the Bay 
Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"We also need to know whether these failures were, or could have been, 
predicted," Deukmejian said in his Saturday morning radio address, when 
announcing the new appointees. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said the board will determine if the bridge and freeway were 
properly retrofitted using seismic and structural information that has been 
developed after other earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
The panel also is expected to make recommendations as to whether the state 
should modify existing construction and freeway retrofit programs in light of 
information learned from the quake.

Here's a brief summary of the major earthquake relief bills passed on Saturday 
by the Legislature and sent to Gov. George Deukmejian for his signature: 
</P>
<P>
Increases the state sales tax by one-quarter of a cent for 13 months, beginning 
Dec. 1 and ending Dec. 31, 1990, to raise an estimated $800 million to help pay 
for earthquake repairs and aid to disaster victims. 
</P>
<P>
Creates a damage compensation fund for victims, or their families, who were 
killed or injured in the collapses of the Nimitz Freeway or a portion of the 
San Francisco Bay Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Authorizes the governor to provide supplemental grants of up to $10,000 to 
those disaster victims with the greatest need, on top of $10,000 federal 
grants. 
</P>
<P>
Allows businesses and individuals to carry forward property and casualty losses 
on their state corporation and income taxes for five years. 
</P>
<P>
Permits the use of state funds for housing needs in earthquake-damaged regions, 
including low-interest loans for homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
Puts needed repair work for damaged highways and bridges on a so-called fast 
track by exempting contractors from various permit requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Establishes a special program to assess and accelerate the retrofitting of both 
state and local bridges. 
</P>
<P>
Waives the required one-week wait before a person residing in a major disaster 
area is eligible for unemployment insurance benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Authorizes the governor to make emergency funds available for the repair of 
private, non-profit organizational facilities, including universities. 
</P>
<P>
Permits state parks bond money to be used to rehabilitate damaged recreational 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Replenishes the state's $20-million disaster response fund, which was nearly 
depleted by immediate earthquake assistance payments. 
</P>
<P>
Provides funding to counties hit hard by the earthquake to cover revenue losses 
caused by reduced collection of property taxes.

REPUBLICANS STOP BID TO SAVE CLINICS; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: GOP ASSEMBLYMEN, ANGRY AT THE DIVERSION FROM EARTHQUAKE RELIEF BILLS, 
BLOCK EMERGENCY FUNDS TO KEEP FAMILY AGENCIES FROM CLOSING.

<P>
A last-ditch effort to provide emergency funds that would prevent the closure 
of family planning clinics throughout the state was blocked Saturday by 
Republican legislators who contend the clinics encourage abortions. 
</P>
<P>
With 38 family planning clinics forced to shut down because of a cutback in 
state funds, Democratic leaders agreed to broaden the Legislature's earthquake 
relief session and take up a $6-million bailout resolution for the clinics. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate, on a bipartisan vote of 29 to 6, easily passed the measure asking 
Gov. George Deukmejian to forestall the clinic closures until the Legislature 
comes back in January and negotiates a permanent solution. 
</P>
<P>
But Republicans in the Assembly, angry at the diversion from earthquake relief 
bills, refused to waive the Assembly's rules so that the bailout measure could 
come up for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's an inappropriate effort to leverage and blackjack members of the 
Legislature who are here because of this earthquake," complained Assembly 
Republican Leader Ross Johnson of La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also charged that the family planning clinics promote abortions by 
providing pregnancy counseling along with other services. 
</P>
<P>
Backers of the clinics counter that no state funds are used at such facilities 
to provide abortions or encourage women to get them. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the fiery assemblyman also said he is becoming "less and less 
sympathetic" to family planning clinics because of the political activities of 
some groups, such as Planned Parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
"If they've got enough money to take out ads to attack members of the 
Legislature, let them use that money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The family planning crisis was prompted by Deukmejian's veto in July of $24 
million in state funds for clinics offering such services as birth control, 
gynecological exams, Pap smears, pregnancy counseling and testing for venereal 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
The governor said the family planning programs had been ineffective and should 
instead be funded by private sources, which already provide a large portion of 
their funding. His veto wiped out two-thirds of the state's $36-million family 
planning budget. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 38 clinics forced so far to halt family planning services, 13 are in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Brett, Deukmejian's press secretary, said that if more money is needed to 
fund the clinics, counties can use other resources allocated by the state, such 
as revenue from the Proposition 99 tobacco tax increase, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor does not see a compelling reason why we need to act on family 
planning at this time," Brett said. "We called the special session for 
earthquake relief and it is the desire of the governor to keep it to that 
subject." 
</P>
<P>
The drive to restore some of the family planning money was led by two 
Democratic legislators from Los Angeles, Assemblywoman Maxine Waters and Sen. 
Diane Watson. 
</P>
<P>
For two days, Waters lobbied Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) 
and Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) to call a general 
session of the Legislature at the same time as the emergency earthquake relief 
session so that the issue could be heard. 
</P>
<P>
Then, once she was successful, the Democrats introduced identical resolutions 
in both houses requesting that the governor spend $6 million from the state's 
reserve fund to prevent the clinic closures. The resolutions, an attempt at 
compromise, would not have required the expenditure of funds but simply asked 
the governor to use his emergency powers to save the clinics. 
</P>
<P>
In the Assembly, the bid to have the bill heard was rejected on a party line 
vote of 43 to 31, well short of the two-thirds vote required. 
</P>
<P>
But Waters was not deterred by the outcome. With abortion looming as a major 
issue in the Legislature next year, she said Saturday's debate was simply the 
first step. 
</P>
<P>
"It's what I call my opening salvo to wage a campaign in this Legislature on 
women's issues," she said. "This Legislature belongs to women too. What can be 
anticipated all of next year is that at every opportunity we're going to force 
these issues."

'MOST WANTED' FELON CAUGHT IN WEST COVINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A dangerous prison escapee from Massachusetts, who was recently featured on the 
television show "America's Most Wanted," was captured early Saturday in a West 
Covina hotel by police and the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Rambert, 23, was arrested without incident as he slept at the 
Comfort Inn on Garvey Avenue, said FBI spokesman Jim Neilson. The fugitive was 
with a woman, who was later released. A loaded semiautomatic pistol was found 
in his room, Neilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Rambert, who was serving a life sentence for rapes and other crimes, escaped 
Oct. 1 from the Bridgewater Treatment Center for violent sexual criminals in 
Massachusetts. Two other inmates who escaped along with him have been captured. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI and the West Covina police were informed that the fugitive was in the 
area by Massachusetts officials who said that Rambert had been seen driving a 
stolen pickup truck with Georgia license plates. Officials were unable to say 
whether the tip came as a result of the national exposure the case received 
last month on television. 
</P>
<P>
Deodato Arruda, spokesman for the Massachusetts Department of Correction, said 
that it was possible a phone call came from a viewer. 
</P>
<P>
Rambert, who received a life sentence as a juvenile, was considered "one of the 
most violent criminals in the state," Arruda said. "He has been in and out of 
prison all his life."

MUSEUM FUND-RAISING DRIVE BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trustees of the Japanese American National Museum, set to open in Little Tokyo 
in late 1990, kicked off a fund-raising drive this weekend that they hope will 
bring in $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
The official campaign began Friday with a $100,000 contribution from Bank of 
America, said Irene Hirano, the museum's executive director. That brings to $4 
million the amount donated so far, including a $1-million grant from the Los 
Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency last year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The CRA funds will be used for the first phase of construction -- the 
$10-million renovation of the 64-year-old Nishi Hongwanji Buddhist Temple at 
1st Street and Central Avenue. The three-story brick temple is set to open as a 
museum by late 1990. It will house the museum's first exhibit, a collection of 
photographs and other items documenting the Issei, or first wave of Japanese 
immigrants to the United States between 1885 and 1924. 
</P>
<P>
Museum trustees plan to eventually construct a second building on an 8-acre 
parcel just north of the temple, Hirano said.

PROTESTERS AGAIN DEMONSTRATE AT RED ARMY SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Armenian demonstrators marched outside the Shrine Auditorium again on Saturday, 
the third straight day of protest at a four-day engagement of the Soviet Red 
Army Chorus and dance ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
About 80 demonstrators chanted and carried signs protesting the killing of 
Armenians by soldiers in the Soviet Union. But police kept protesters at bay, 
limiting their marching to the south side of the auditorium, along Jefferson 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The number of protesters has dwindled since Thursday, when about 1,000 
demonstrated, some chaining themselves to the auditorium's front doors, 
delaying the opening performance by more than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance has steadily increased since the first night when only about 800 
waited for police to clear the entrance to the auditorium. About 2,400 attended 
the third performance on Saturday. Auditorium manager Brian Fenske said it did 
not appear that the demonstration had affected attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Protesters carried posters decrying the "Soviet dictatorship" and chanted "Red 
Army go home."

OUTMANNED CHARGERS MUST GO LONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today's Charger-Eagle game at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium is more than just a 
mismatch of talent. 
</P>
<P>
It is no secret that Philadelphia, led by its electric quarterback, Randall 
Cunningham, and defensive end Reggie White, arguably the best defender in 
football, has better players. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles also have a better record (6-2) and a four-game winning streak. The 
Chargers (2-6) have a four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The strange thing about this game is what a mismatch in perceptions it 
presents. Philadelphia Coach Buddy Ryan has had more effect on defensive 
philosophy league-wide that any other coach in the '80s. Attack the 
quarterback, Ryan says, and you won't have to worry so much about how well your 
defensive backfield can cover. 
</P>
<P>
But the Eagles, who have intercepted more passes (19) and recovered more 
fumbles (13) than any other team in the NFL, rank a surprising 21st in yards 
allowed. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, on the other hand, are coached by Dan Henning, whose background 
is offense. Yet they rank ninth in NFL defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure people understand Buddy Ryan and his system," Henning says. "He 
doesn't believe in statistics any more than I do." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Ryan is willing to give you the chance to make a big play on 
him if he thinks he can make a big play on you first. That strategy backfired 
on him at home in Week 3. The Eagles sacked San Francisco quarterback Joe 
Montana eight times but lost, 38-28, when Montana threw four touchdown passes 
in the final period. He finished with 428 yards passing on the day. And those 
numbers remain a major factor in why the Eagles' rank 25th in the league in 
pass defense. 
</P>
<P>
That also explains why the Chargers were working on their long passing game 
this week. They know if they can protect starting quarterback Jim McMucus . . . 
er . . . McMahon long enough, he may be able to locate his two swift wide 
receivers -- Anthony Miller and Jamie Holland. The Chargers have completed just 
one pass all year that netted more than 50 yards -- a 63-yarder to Miller that 
got them a touchdown against Houston seven weeks ago. Look for the Chargers to 
utilize rookie Wayne Walker as a third wide receiver as often as they can. 
</P>
<P>
But isn't it odd that rookie Billy Joe Tolliver won't be starting in the one 
game on the Charger schedule that begs for his strong arm? The explanation is 
simple. Tolliver made his first NFL start last week and completed just six of 
17 passes. He read the Seattle defense poorly. And he showed little skill 
escaping the rush. His quarterback rating is chilly -- 19.5. By way of 
comparison, McMahon's is 74.2, Cunningham's is 76.8 and league-leader Montana's 
is 108.9. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon has good escape ability, great reading instincts and a chip on his 
shoulder bigger than Camp Pendleton. At one point this week, he blew his nose 
at a reporter when he heard a question he didn't like. 
</P>
<P>
The resultant media uproar almost totally obscured the importance of this game. 
If the Chargers lose, they will be one game short of the 2-8 mark they stumbled 
to last year under former Coach Al Saunders. Their opponent next week is the 
improved Los Angeles Raiders. After that, they play four games in five weeks on 
the road, three in the Eastern time zone. 
</P>
<P>
To beat the Eagles, the Chargers must contain Cunningham and detain White. It 
won't be easy. 
</P>
<P>
Even though opponents have sacked Cunningham 21 times, more than the league 
average of 19.6, he has an uncanny knack for making something out of nothing. 
He is the league's leading rushing quarterback with 333 yards, three touchdown 
runs and a 6.2 yards per carry average. 
</P>
<P>
"Randall Cunningham can throw the ball 100 yards," says Charger cornerback Sam 
Seale, the defender opponents have directed most of their passes at this year. 
"You have to cover longer against him. You have to cover until you hear the 
whistle. Once he starts scrambling, he will be running one way and throwing a 
55-yard touchdown in the other direction." 
</P>
<P>
White usually lines up at left end, which matches him against Brett Miller, the 
Charger right tackle. But White will also line up on the nose across from 
rookie center Courtney Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll probably line up across from me all day," says a self-deprecating Hall. 
"He's the best we've seen on film." 
</P>
<P>
Hall described one play in which White, who is 6-5, 280 pounds, chased a 
running back 50 yards downfield. 
</P>
<P>
"If the defensive back hadn't caught him," Hall said, "Reggie would have." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who played against White when Miller was an Atlanta Falcon, refers to 
White respectfully as the "Reverend" Mr. White. And White is in fact a licensed 
Baptist minister, part of the reason they call him the "Minister of Defense" in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a testimony to your talent to be able to measure it against the best," 
Miller says. "But it's not so bad, every once in a while, to get a stiff. There 
aren't many stiffs around, and Reggie White certainly is not one of them." 
</P>
<P>
Because he typically draws at least two, and sometimes three, blockers, White 
is only third on his own team in sacks with six. Right end Clyde Simmons has 10 
1/2, and tackle Jerome Brown has six. More revealing is the "quarterback hurry" 
statistic kept by the Eagles. White leads with 36. Simmons has 25 and Brown 18. 
</P>
<P>
So far the Chargers have managed to stay together as a team even though the 
margins of defeat during this current losing streak have been six, one, seven 
and three points. The culprits have been on offense, which has dropped to 26th 
in the league, and the special teams, which have been abominable. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have a togetherness on offense and defense," Henning says. "Either 
you have that or you have nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Eagle defense has 21 sacks and 12 interceptions in its last four games. . . 
. Charger punter Hank Ilesic is last in the league in net punting average, 30.8 
yards.

SCHROEDER, RAIDERS AT BREAKING POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of these weeks turned out to be a passion play revolving around Jay 
Schroeder, after all. It wasn't last Sunday, when his former Redskin teammates 
were in, but this one, when he's cast back in the lineup to bear the slings and 
arrows of the Cincinnati Bengals and outrageous Raider fans. 
</P>
<P>
All that hangs on the outcome is the Raider season. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Beuerlein's knee injury will sideline him today, and possibly several 
more games. The Raiders, 4-4 and in contention for a wild-card spot, are in the 
teeth of their schedule: one-point underdogs today; at San Diego next week; at 
Houston the week after. 
</P>
<P>
All they have to do is stabilize a slumping quarterback who's just lost his 
job, who's completed 28% of his passes in his last three games, and who will be 
booed the first time he does anything wrong, or before that. 
</P>
<P>
They have a lot of work to do: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Internally . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It's been tough mentally," Schroeder said. "But this game has been that way 
since it started. It's a tough physical game and it's tough mentally to get 
yourself prepared, especially in times like this. You've got to be able to 
block everything out." 
</P>
<P>
 -- And externally . . . 
</P>
<P>
There is one thing the Raiders will try to do to help Schroeder: control the 
ball with their running game. 
</P>
<P>
Can they? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe. 
</P>
<P>
Their turnaround under Coach Art Shell has been complete, a product of 
happiness, health and the one and only Bo Jackson, in whatever order. 
</P>
<P>
When Mike Shanahan was fired, opponents were outrushing the Raiders by 43.5 
yards a game. Since, the Raiders have run for 150 yards a contest and held 
opponents to an average of 80. You-know-who is averaging 6.2 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Bengals are in trouble. Pro Bowl nose tackle Tim Krumrie, who 
broke his leg in the Super Bowl, is back but laboring. With a sound Krumrie 
last season, the Bengals had only an average defense. Now they're No. 25 
against the rush. 
</P>
<P>
They can be expected to bring some extras, such as their 230-pound (it says in 
the media guide) or 240-pound strong safety, David Fulcher, up to the line of 
scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Schroeder may be called upon to loosen the Bengals up right away. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders, in turn, could try to get him some early, easy -- that is, short 
-- completions, to rebuild his confidence. One thing that threw Schroeder, 
ironically, was the return to Raider Ball. He was supposed to be the new Daryle 
Lamonica-style mad bomber, but he may have lost his game locking on to 
receivers going deep while easier targets -- the ones Beuerlein would hit -- 
came open underneath and unseen. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to know what could happen to the Raiders if things don't work out, 
check last season's Bengal visit -- a 45-21 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Nor can the Raiders motivate themselves by complaining that Bengal Coach Sam 
Wyche ran up the score. Wyche pulled his regulars early in the fourth quarter, 
leading, 45-7. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the Bengals scored on five consecutive possessions. As if to 
prove it was no fluke, they scored on five of six last week, massacring Tampa 
Bay, 56-23. 
</P>
<P>
Al Davis was so anguished at the lack of pressure on Boomer Esiason, he 
convened a late-Sunday night meeting of the coaching staff and threatened to 
fire two defensive assistants. 
</P>
<P>
What's a coach to do with a game film that's scarier than "Friday the 13th?" 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you have to look at it, if only to watch personnel, see the guy that you 
played against last year, see how you did against him," Shell said. "You can't 
hide it. You got to take a look at it, even though it was a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals have a huge offensive line, built around their Hall of Fame-bound 
left tackle, Anthony Munoz of USC. A year ago, Bengal guard Max Montoya of UCLA 
said that the game Munoz had played against Mike Wise was the finest he'd ever 
seen an offensive lineman play. 
</P>
<P>
How good is that line? 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals have lost Ickey Woods and are still rolling. James Brooks, their 
182-pound tailback, is averaging 5.9 yards a carry and is on a 1,400-yard pace. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders are fresh from shutting down the Redskins and overrunning the Hogs. 
They held the Redskins to 21 yards rushing and registered seven sacks on a team 
that had given up seven in seven games. But that was with Gerald Riggs out, and 
the Raiders leading from the get-go, thanks to Beuerlein's hot start. 
</P>
<P>
Today Beuerlein watches. How well the Raiders carry on will tell their '89 
tale. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
Boomer Esiason says he's finally over shoulder and ankle problems. His injuries 
notwithstanding, he's the AFC's No. 2 passer with 14 touchdowns -- five last 
week -- and four interceptions. . . . Howie Long's name is once more on the 
lips of every Raider opponent. Without being asked, Esiason volunteered that 
Long "is just playing tremendous football right now." Wyche said Long is 
"playing as well as I've seen him in years. He really looks aggressive and 
quick." . . . Raider safety sensation Eddie Anderson has a hamstring pull, 
didn't practice and was limping last week. If he can't go, with Vann McElroy 
already out, the Raiders would switch Mike Harden to free safety and play 
Russell Carter or Zeph Lee at strong safety. . . . Former Bruin Eric Ball, the 
Bengals' No. 2 pick, starts in place of the injured Ickey Woods.

THE OTHER GAMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
GAME OF THE DAY 
</P>
<P>
Chicago (5-3) at Green Bay (4-4), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Packers can make it a three-team race in the NFC Central by knocking off 
the Bears. Chicago's defense looks menacing again with Richard Dent back, but 
Green Bay's Don Majkowski leads the NFL in passing with 2,303 yards and 16 
touchdowns, and has made a star of receiver Sterling Sharpe. Jim Harbaugh 
replaces Mike Tomczak at quarterback after leading the Bears past the Rams. The 
Bears have beaten the Packers eight consecutive times, including 24-6 and 16-0 
last season. Chicago is 4-1 at home, 1-2 on the road. The Packers are 4-1 at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
INTERCONFERENCE GAMES 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland (5-3) at Tampa Bay (3-5), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns beat Houston last week with an assortment of gadget plays, but may 
not need any tricks against Tampa Bay, which has allowed 88 points in the last 
two games. Bernie Kosar was back in form, throwing two long touchdown passes to 
Webster Slaughter and running for another, but the running game continued to 
lag. Tampa Bay's Vinny Testaverde has thrown three touchdown passes in each of 
his last three games, but can't escape the interception. He had three passes 
intercepted last week and has 10 this season. Testaverde threw 35 interceptions 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia (6-2) at San Diego (2-6), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Coach Dan Henning saw enough of rookie quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver 
in three scoreless quarters against Seattle that he's going back to Jim 
McMahon, who nearly pulled out a victory over the Seahawks. Philadelphia will 
send Reggie White and the rest of Buddy Ryan's sackmen after McMahon, who isn't 
as mobile as he once was. San Diego has lost its last four games; the Eagles 
have won their last four and seven of their last eight on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo (6-2) at Atlanta (2-6), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills have won three in a row with reserve quarterback Frank Reich but 
might turn the reins back over to Jim Kelly. Linebacker Shane Conlan also may 
be ready to play, rejoining a defense that was the first to sack Dan Marino 
this season. However, the Bills have won only two of their last five road 
games. The Falcons have lost five of six despite the standout play of 
quarterback Chris Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit (1-7) at Houston (4-4), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Peete and Barry Sanders can pile up the yards in Detroit's Silver 
Stretch offense, but the Lions have trouble scoring. Detroit gave up 345 yards 
passing to Green Bay, good news for Houston's Warren Moon, who has thrown for 
1,910 yards and 12 touchdowns, and hasn't had a pass intercepted in his last 68 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
AFC GAMES 
</P>
<P>
Indianapolis (4-4) at Miami (4-4), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts figure to leave Eric Dickerson on the bench, hoping his nagging 
hamstring injury will heal. That leaves the running chores to Albert Bentley. 
The Colts have beaten Miami three consecutive times, including 15-13 and 31-28 
last season. Indianapolis might have learned from Buffalo's defense, which 
sacked Miami's Dan Marino twice last week after he hadn't been down in 759 
passing attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh (4-4) at Denver (6-2), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
TV: Channel 4. 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers are a different team with Bubby Brister at quarterback, as he 
showed when he returned to lead them over Kansas City last week. After allowing 
92 points in its first two games, Pittsburgh has given up only 94 while winning 
four of six games. The Steelers beat Denver, 39-21, last season at Pittsburgh. 
John Elway was inconsistent again in Denver's loss to Philadelphia, having 
three passes intercepted before leading a rally that fell short when he 
fumbled. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle (4-4) at Kansas City (3-5), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Chiefs have won five of their last six games at home, losing only to 
Cincinnati in the final minutes. Seattle has won three in a row on the road. 
Christian Okoye leads the league in rushing and had 156 yards in a 20-16 
victory over Seattle four weeks ago. Steve Largent's pairing with Brian Blades 
figures to help Dave Krieg, who has thrown 13 touchdown passes, but has been 
intercepted 11 times. The Chiefs have beaten Seattle seven consecutive times at 
Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
New York Jets (1-7) at New England (3-5), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets are off to their worst start since 1974, when they also were 1-7. New 
York's defense has outscored the offense, 24-16, in the last five games -- with 
safety Erik McMillan scoring three touchdowns on returns this season. Jet 
quarterback Ken O'Brien was sacked nine times last week by San Francisco. New 
England has jelled offensively the past two games with Steve Grogan back at 
quarterback. The Patriots have beaten the Jets four consecutive times, winning 
27-24 on opening day, and 14-13 and 28-3 last season. 
</P>
<P>
NFC GAMES 
</P>
<P>
New York Giants (7-1) at Phoenix (4-4), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants hope Phil Simms' ankle injury won't keep him out, since they 
struggled with Jeff Hostetler while beating Minnesota Monday night. The Giants 
are off to their best start since 1939. Six weeks ago, New York intercepted 
four of Gary Hogeboom's first eight passes and rolled past the Cardinals, 35-7. 
The Giants have won eight of 11 from the Cardinals, who beat the Giants, 24-17, 
last season at Phoenix. The Cardinals might have found a ground game with Earl 
Ferrell and Tony Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas (0-8) at Washington (4-4), 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
TV: ESPN 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins bring Doug Williams off the injured-reserve list and into the 
starting lineup, benching Mark Rypien, who has nine interceptions and has lost 
six of 11 fumbles. The Redskins have won five of their last six against Dallas, 
which scored a 24-7 victory at RFK Stadium last season -- the Cowboys' only win 
in the last 20 games. Washington trounced Dallas six weeks ago, 30-7. With one 
more defeat, Cowboy rookie Coach Jimmy Johnson will equal his total in six 
seasons at the University of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
MONDAY NIGHT 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans (4-4) at San Francisco (7-1) 
</P>
<P>
TV: Channel 7, 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana returns to the San Francisco lineup, but the 49ers learned in 
recent weeks they're not in bad shape with Steve Young or Steve Bono. However, 
the 49ers will be without nose tackle Michael Carter, replacing him with former 
Giant Jim Burt. The 49ers have beaten the Saints three consecutive times, 24-20 
four weeks ago. The Saints have come on strong since then, winning the last 
three behind a stingy defense and a hot quarterback, Bobby Hebert.

VOICES OF THE PAST MAY HAUNT RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MINNEAPOLIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The site of so many Rams crises through the years -- playoff losses in 1969, 
1974, 1976 and 1988 -- provides an excellent setting for the latest one, a 
three-game losing streak that could become four faster than a Ram blocker might 
say, "There goes Keith Millard!" 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't gotten any easier for the Rams here, just warmer. The Minnesota 
Vikings used to freeze the Rams out of contention. Now, in the Metrodome, they 
just shout 'em out. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's wild-card playoff game against the Rams came complete with such a 
deafening roar that quarterback Jim Everett had to use a silent snap count, 
apparently only audible to Viking safety Joey (Dog Ears) Browner, whose two 
first-half interceptions led to touchdowns in a 28-17 Minnesota win. 
</P>
<P>
How important is it to hear in football? Last summer, the Rams dominated the 
same Vikings, 24-14, in an exhibition game at Anaheim Stadium in which Everett 
used the staggered count expertly, drawing Minnesota's fabulous front four 
offside several times, while keeping the group off balance throughout the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams have come to Minnesota this weekend in need of a win in the worst way, 
but are armed this time with a new league rule designed to keep crowd noise in 
check. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams' John Robinson said something had to be done eventually. 
</P>
<P>
He said of some stadium video scoreboard displays: "I don't know if it was 
choreographed by somebody but those stadiums all flashed (NOISE!) to start it 
and newspapers commented on it, and visiting coaches are asked about it. So 
there was a clear environment established, and maybe this (rule) will make that 
less." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Rams were working on their all-mime offense again this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there'll be the same intensity," Robinson said. "It's not a 
playoff game. But I do think we have to recognize it's an indoor stadium and 
noise will be a factor." 
</P>
<P>
Surprise, surprise, though, the Vikings haven't run away from the pack in the 
National Football Conference, despite having acquired tailback Herschel Walker 
from Dallas on Oct. 11. Walker was supposed to be the missing piece, but the 
Vikings appear to have lost a few puzzle parts in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
After Monday night's 24-14 loss to the New York Giants, Minnesota Coach Jerry 
Burns gave quarterback Tommy Kramer the hook and will be starting Wade Wilson 
against the Rams. Wilson, an NFC Pro Bowl pick last season, opened the season 
as the starter before breaking a knuckle on his left hand against Tampa Bay on 
Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was the the NFC's 12th-rated passer, with three touchdowns and five 
interceptions, before he went down, so this wasn't like losing one of this 
year's stars such as, say, Don Majkowksi. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings' offense, operated by the independent-thinking coordinator Bob 
Schnelker, may need some rethinking. How can an offense with wide receiver 
Anthony Carter and Walker in the same lineup be so ineffective? 
</P>
<P>
Walker carried only 12 times against the Giants, which is one popular theory, 
and Carter, a capable one-man wrecking crew, has only six receptions in his 
last three games. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been getting him the ball and he hasn't been dominating the game as 
he's got the capability of doing, but the fault lies not always with him," 
Burns said of Carter. "Sometimes he runs an excellent pattern and the 
protection breaks down, or we can't get the ball to him, because sometimes he 
might not be running the pattern. There's so many problems that surround our 
ineptitude." 
</P>
<P>
Remember, Mike Lynn, the Vikings' general manager, admitted that the Walker 
trade was a short-term proposition for his team, and that anything less than 
the Super Bowl the next few years would prove the trade a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
The pressure's in your court, Mr. Burns. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you'd be in the game if you weren't either used to it, 
anticipated it, or expected the pressure," Burns said. "I'm sure John Robinson 
isn't going to be happy batting .500. He wants to get in there, get to the 
playoffs and win the Super Bowl. That's the object of everybody. The pressure's 
there to do it. If we don't do it this year, it's going to be next year. If you 
do it this year, there's pressure to repeat it again. What the hell you going 
to do?" 
</P>
<P>
Play ball, and let the crises begin. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're going to come in here hungry as hell, and mean as hell," Burns 
said of the Rams. "I think we're in the same position, we're both 5-3, and both 
hopeful to win our division. If we don't get there, we're fighting for a 
wild-card spot. It's a critical game for both teams." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Henry Ellard has led the Rams in receiving in nine consecutive regular-season 
games and, with 51 catches through eight games, is on a pace to break his own 
franchise record for receptions in one season, 86, which he set in 1988. . . . 
Sack update: The Vikings are averaging 7.2 sacks a game the last four weeks and 
lead the league with 42. Defensive tackle Keith Millard leads the league with 
13. . . . The Rams have just 16 sacks for the season. They had 39 through eight 
games in 1988. . . . The Rams are averaging 2.6 yards a rush the last three 
weeks, after averaging 4.6 the first five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
. . . In case you haven't noticed, Tony Slaton and Duval Love are sharing the 
right guard position, equally, alternating every third series. After a long 
summer holdout, Love still hasn't regained the starting position he won after 
Dennis Harrah's retirement in 1987.

GILL LEADS TEXAS TECH PAST NO.22 TEXAS, 24-17 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jamie Gill threw a 65-yard touchdown pass to Anthony Manyweather for the 
go-ahead score with 4 minutes 26 seconds remaining as Texas Tech upset No. 22 
Texas, 24-17, for the Red Raiders' first victory at Austin, Tex., since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
With Tech trailing 17-14 and facing third and 26, Gill escaped a strong rush 
and found Manyweather in the clear along the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
Lin Elliott kicked a 51-yard field goal with 1:20 to go, and a pass by Peter 
Gardere, Texas' freshman quarterback, was intercepted by Brian Dubiski at the 
Tech 31-yard line with 22 seconds to go. 
</P>
<P>
Texas fell to 4-3 overall and 3-1 in the Southwest Conference. Tech improved to 
6-2 and 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 55, Texas Christian 10 -- Andre Ware passed for six touchdowns and 
safety Chris Ellison intercepted three passes as the 17th-ranked Cougars won at 
Ft. Worth, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Ware, the nation's leader in total offense who also set a Southwest Conference 
single-season passing record, had touchdown pass plays of 62 yards to Emmanuel 
Hazard and 40 yards to Paul Smith as Houston took a 20-3 first-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
Hazard broke his conference record of 16 receptions with 19, for 194 yards and 
three touchdowns. Hazard's 17 touchdown receptions this season broke the 
previous conference record of 15 by Jason Phillips of Houston in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars are 6-2 overall and 3-2 in the Southwest Conference. TCU fell to 
4-5 and 2-4. 
</P>
<P>
Ware had touchdown pass plays of 29 yards to Patrick Cooper, 24 yards to Smith 
and 19 yards to Craig Alexander in the third quarter. Ware left at the start of 
the fourth after completing 42 of 63 passes for 477 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Ware's 3,413 yards passing this season passed the previous conference record of 
3,317 set by Tommy Kramer of Rice in 1976. His 65 career touchdown passes also 
are a record. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas 38, Rice 17 -- Derek Russell had 15-yard touchdowns on an end around 
and a pass reception, and James Rouse's 11-yard run late in the third quarter 
lifted the the 11th-ranked Razorbacks at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas turned the game into a rout in the final 10 minutes, capitalizing on 
two Rice turnovers for touchdowns. The Razorbacks also held the Owls to 98 
rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas (7-1 overall and 4-1 in the SWC), defeated the Owls (1-7-1, 1-5), for 
the ninth consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Rice quarterback Donald Hollas completed 16 of 18 passes, including nine of his 
last 10, for 176 yards but left with 3:14 to go in the half with a sprained 
ankle after he was hit out of bounds. He did not return. 
</P>
<P>
Texas A&amp;M 63, Southern Methodist 14 -- Darren Lewis rushed for 126 yards, 
scored two touchdowns and threw a touchdown pass, all in the first half, as the 
20th-ranked Aggies won at College Station, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
It was A&amp;M's second largest victory margin over SMU in the 70-year history 
of the series. A&amp;M beat SMU, 63-0, in 1916. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies improved to 7-2 overall and 5-1 in the SWC; SMU dropped to 2-6 and 
0-6.

Johnny Bailey of Texas A&amp;I broke the NCAA all-purpose yardage record in the 
Javelinas' 33-13 victory over Abilene Christian on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey broke the record, which combines rushing, receiving and return yardage, 
of 7,623 yards with a 19-yard kickoff return. The record had been held by Kenny 
Gamble, who played for Colgate from 1984-87. 
</P>
<P>
The kickoff return, with 6:08 remaining in the second quarter, gave Bailey 
7,637 all-purpose career yards. Bailey, a 5-foot-9, 180-pound running back, 
finished with 179 rushing yards in 23 carries and 41 yards in two returns for 
7,726 all-purpose yards. He has one regular-season game remaining.

ACC MAY GET SQUEEZED OUT OF CITRUS UNLESS N.C. ST. WINS TITLE 
</P>

<P>
Saturday's Virginia-North Carolina State game in Raleigh, N.C., could go a long 
way toward determining this year's Atlantic Coast Conference champion. 
</P>
<P>
But only a victory by the Wolfpack would realistically keep the ACC in the 
running for a bid to the Florida Citrus Bowl in Orlando. The ACC is in the 
second year of a four-year deal with the Citrus Bowl, a contract that 
stipulates that in years Nos. 2 and 4, the bowl's selection committee can go 
outside the league for a host school as long as it can get a higher-ranked 
team. 
</P>
<P>
As of this week, North Carolina State is only ranked 18th. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's a significant difference in the rankings (between North Carolina 
State and a non-ACC school), we'll lean toward the higher-ranked team," Chuck 
Rohe, the Citrus Bowl's executive director, said this week. "It doesn't put the 
ACC in a bind." 
</P>
<P>
As part of the agreement, the Citrus Bowl will inform the ACC of its plans by 
Nov. 15, which is 10 days before the bowl invitations can be announced. But 
North Carolina State, which plays at Duke next week, appears to be the only 
team from the conference to be a realistic contender. Clemson, which beat 
Oklahoma in the Citrus Bowl last season, is ranked 21st. 
</P>
<P>
ACC Commissioner Gene Corrigan said he gets a phone call every Monday morning 
from Citrus Bowl officials to update him. Though he admits the ACC is in a 
difficult situation, considering the number of strong teams in the Southeast 
this season, he says the league contenders will continue to get serious 
consideration from the Citrus Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless all the teams fall apart," Corrigan said. "At this time of year, 
everybody is looking way beyond what they're going to get. As you get closer to 
the end, things become more realistic." 
</P>
<P>
The jockeying for position is heating up. Consider some of these possibilities: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Right now, the Orange and Sugar bowls appear to be the leading contenders 
for the national championship game. Though it has generally been assumed since 
Notre Dame beat Michigan back in September that the game would be played 
between the Fighting Irish and the Big Eight champion in Miami, that no longer 
seems to be certain. 
</P>
<P>
"They will have played in the Orange Bowl (against Miami Nov. 25), and it's not 
a pleasant thing for them," said Don Meyers, chairman of the Fiesta Bowl's 
selection committee. "It's going to be nasty this year. If they win, that's 
great, but they don't want to go back. If they lose, they certainly don't want 
to go back." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The one problem with Notre Dame accepting a Sugar Bowl invitation is 
waiting to see if Alabama finishes unbeaten. The Crimson Tide won't end its 
season until a Dec. 2 visit to Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's say Notre Dame stays undefeated and Colorado stayed undefeated," Sugar 
Bowl executive director Mickey Holmes says. "Then let's say Alabama gets 
through its Southern Mississippi game (Nov. 18) undefeated. Then Notre Dame 
would have a decision to make between us and the Orange Bowl. I think the idea 
of playing Alabama would have a lot of appeal for Notre Dame." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's game between host second-ranked Colorado (8-0) and third-ranked 
Nebraska (8-0) has an interesting quarterback duel. Both Damian Hagan of the 
Buffaloes and the Cornhuskers' Gerry Gdowski have a chance to run for 1,000 
yards and throw for 1,000 yards this season. It has been done three times: by 
Bart Weiss of Air Force in 1985, Reggie Collier of Southern Mississippi in 1981 
and Drake's Johnny Bright in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
For last week's trip to Oklahoma, Colorado had a first-class airplane seat, a 
spot at the training table and a locker kept empty in memory of its late 
quarterback, Sal Aunese, who died of stomach cancer in September. Even more 
eerie was the way Aunese's number (8) figured into the story line. The victory 
gave Colorado an 8-0 record. It was head coach Bill McCartney's 88th game in 
his eighth year at Colorado and the school's 888th game overall. 
</P>
<P>
In last week's 20-3 victory over Oklahoma, the Buffalos were penalized when 
injured Colorado running back Eric Bieniemy ran onto the field to celebrate 
with his teammates after one of the touchdowns. Bieniemy, who is sidelined with 
a broken fibula, is listed as questionable for this week's showdown. 
</P>
<P>
McCartney said, "We're not going to play him if he's limping. He wants to play. 
I'm going to have to chain him to the bench if I don't let him play." 
</P>
<P>
Iowa State coach Jim Walden has opinions on nearly everything, so it wasn't 
surprising for him to make his own prediction about the Colorado-Nebraska game. 
"Nebraska's got to throw the ball and they're not going to want to," Walden 
said. "If you don't throw the ball on Colorado, they're going to beat you into 
submission." 
</P>
<P>
The eating habits of some other Big Eight coaches came into question this week. 
When asked about the difference between being a head coach and an assistant, 
Kansas State's Bill Snyder said, "Eating. I don't eat lunch or dinner when I'm 
at work. I don't eat breakfast. I eat one meal when I go home." 
</P>
<P>
That might be one meal more than Kansas' Glen Mason is going to get at home for 
a while. When told of Snyder's comments, Mason said, "I don't go home to eat. 
If you ate my wife's cooking, you wouldn't go home to eat, either." 
</P>
<P>
Forget about eating. Mason might be living in his office after those remarks. 
</P>
<P>
One week after Minnesota's Fred Foggie ran back a blocked field goal 98 yards 
against Indiana, Illinois strong safety Quintin Parker broke the short-lived 
Big 10 record. Parker's 100-yard runback of a blocked extra point in last 
week's 32-9 victory over Wisconsin, which was worth two points (a defensive 
point after touchdown), also set the National Collegiate Athletic Association 
record. 
</P>
<P>
It took three years, but Ohio State quarterback Greg Frey finally got back at 
an old high school rival. Seems that when both he and Minnesota's Scott 
Schaffner were high school seniors in Cincinnati, Frey threw for 487 yards for 
St. Xavier in a game against Schaffner's Moeller team. Moeller won, 56-42. 
</P>
<P>
In last week's 41-37 victory for the Buckeyes, a game in which they came back 
from a 31-0 second-quarter deficit, Frey threw for 327 yards, three touchdowns 
and a pair of two-point conversions. Ohio State equaled an NCAA record for the 
largest comeback, set by Maryland in a 1984 win over Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in some pretty wild ones, especially that one against Moeller," Frey 
said. "I'm glad I played the way I did. I had something to make up for." 
</P>
<P>
Quote of the Week: "They really are good on defense." Georgia Coach Ray Goff on 
Temple, which is 0-8 and giving up 41 points and 393 yards a game.

UNLV GETS THE BENEFIT OF LONG BEACH COLLAPSE

<P>
Cal State Long Beach fell apart in the second half Saturday, losing its fourth 
consecutive game, 43-21, to Nevada Las Vegas in the Silver Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Overcoming a 14-7 halftime deficit, the Rebels scored 36 points in the second 
half, more than they had scored in a single game this season. 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas intercepted two passes by quarterback Paul Oates in the third quarter 
and turned each into eventual touchdowns. The Rebels then poured it on, aided 
by an ineffective 49er defense. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first half our tackling was pretty good, but in the second half we got 
a little tired and worn down," said Long Beach Coach Larry Reisbig, whose team 
fell to 3-7 overall and 1-4 in the Big West Conference. The 49ers have given up 
40 or more points five times. 
</P>
<P>
Oates had a poor game, completing only 12 of 36 passes. But Las Vegas 
quarterback Derek Stott became the first Rebel to pass for more than 300 yards 
since Randall Cunningham did it five years ago. Stott completed 18 of 23 passes 
for 326 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Keenan McCardell caught seven of Stott's passes for 139 yards and one 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Stott got the Rebels (4-4, 3-2) started toward a 19-point third quarter with a 
51-yard scoring pass to Rickie Wills, but the 49ers held onto a 14-13 lead when 
the extra-point attempt was missed. 
</P>
<P>
Then, after an interception by Freddy Phillips, Stott drove the Rebels 63 yards 
in six plays to put them ahead for good, 19-14, with 4:35 left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Fullback Kyle Toomer gave balance to the Rebels' attack by rushing for 143 
yards and two touchdowns. Tailback Tommy Jackson added 100 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Even UNLV's Anthony Vannucci, a walk-on freshman, scored on a 10-yard run in 
the fourth quarter. It was his second carry as a collegian. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach had a 201-165 advantage in total yards after the first half but was 
outgained, 552-330 for the game.

U.S. TO FACE EL SALVADOR IN WORLD CUP QUALIFIER

<P>
With a victory today over winless El Salvador in a World Cup qualifying match, 
U.S. Coach Bob Gansler and his young soccer team can make things easier for 
themselves when they play the decisive game later this month against Trinidad 
and Tobago. 
</P>
<P>
If the United States (3-2-1) beats the Salvadorans (0-4-1) at the St. Louis 
Soccer Park, it will advance to the World Cup next June in Italy for the first 
time since 1950 with either a victory or a tie on Nov. 19 at Port of Spain, 
Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
But with a loss or tie against El Salvador, the United States will have to win 
at Port of Spain in its last qualifying game in the North and Central American 
and Caribbean region. 
</P>
<P>
In their previous game in September at Tegucigalpa, Honduras, the United States 
beat El Salvador, 1-0. U.S. midfielder Hugo Perez scored the only goal, but he 
will miss today's match because of a groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
The Salvadorans appeared to be playing for a scoreless tie in that game, but 
Gansler said Saturday that he expects them to be more aggressive today. 
</P>
<P>
They have a new coach and several new players, most of them from El Salvador's 
first-place league team, Firpo. Because of financial problems, the Salvadorans 
were not scheduled to arrive in St. Louis until Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
A capacity crowd of 8,500 is expected to attend today's match, including a 
small group from the St. Louis Latin America Solidarity Group that plans to 
protest U.S. military aid to El Salvador.

SNEAD BEST, ACCORDING TO PGA

<P>
Who is the greatest golfer who ever lived? 
</P>
<P>
It is a question that cannot be answered, but it is one that can be argued for 
hours at a time. 
</P>
<P>
If the criterion is the number of major championships won, the answer is Jack 
Nicklaus. He has 20, and no one else is close. 
</P>
<P>
If the criterion is the amount of money won, it's Tom Kite, who has won 
$5,600,691, thanks in part to the $625,000 windfall he reaped by winning one 
tournament, the Nabisco Championships, a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
If the criterion is number of tournaments won, the greatest is Sam Snead, the 
slammer from West Virginia who won 84 officially and many others that aren't 
listed as official. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Deane Beman and the PGA Tour staff have come up with a new 
criterion, based on statistics from tournaments between 1916 and the present, 
to measure a player's career in different eras. The money list, once the 
measure of success, became obsolete with the escalation of prize money. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Snead, in winning 84 tournaments, won $620,000 in a career that 
spanned 50 years. Kite won $5,000 more than that in one tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The PGA method gives equal importance to every tournament. Points are awarded 
to the first 25 finishers in accordance with the tour purse breakdown, which 
pays 18% of the purse to first place and so on. Every event is awarded 10,000 
points, thus giving 1,800 to the winner. 
</P>
<P>
And the winner? 
</P>
<P>
Sam Snead. 
</P>
<P>
Snead totaled 311,205 points, far outdistancing Nicklaus, 260,777; Arnold 
Palmer, 228,823; Ben Hogan, 219,226; Billy Casper, 211,281; Byron Nelson, 
190,081; Lloyd Mangrum, 178,968; Gene Littler, 169,471; Cary Middlecoff, 
160,237, and Horton Smith, 158,462, who round out the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
Kite is 40th with 99,181. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it gives no consideration to amateurs, thus eliminating Bobby Jones, 
or to foreign tournaments, where Gary Player, Bobby Locke and Seve Ballesteros 
have prospered. But it does make Snead happy. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a real nice thing of them to do," Snead said during a stop while 
promoting his new book, "The Lessons I've Learned." 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I'd have more points than that if they'd give me those other 
tournaments I won. I won the first Crosby tournament down in Rancho Santa Fe, 
and they don't count it." 
</P>
<P>
Snead, 78, has dropped off the Senior PGA Tour to spend his time playing in 
corporate outings and charity events, and autographing books. 
</P>
<P>
"This book deal is tougher than playing 36 holes of golf," he said. "Back in 
Dallas the other day, I signed 400 books. I couldn't believe my eyes. People 
were coming in loaded down with eight or 10 books. They'd have me sign one for 
them, one for cousin Joe, one for uncle Dick and you can't imagine who else. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of those charity tournaments are no picnic, either. Usually, I stay at 
one hole, a par-three, and hit a ball with each group and then go putt out with 
them. I played one hole 33 times at Ft. Pierce, (Fla.,) and I had one stretch 
where the team made 10 birdies in a row playing my ball." 
</P>
<P>
Snead has some definite ideas about what's wrong with golf: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The new golf courses, especially those designed by professional golfers, 
are too difficult, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't relate to the everyday golfer. They make the courses too tough, 
especially the second shots. Muirfield, one of Jack's (Nicklaus) courses, is 
the hardest second-shot course I've ever seen. You have to be a magician to 
work your way around there. 
</P>
<P>
"They ought to look at the old courses like Riviera and Cypress Point. (Touring 
pros) don't kick the hell out of Riviera, even after they took out that 
barranca that ruined a lot of scores. And when they build those tough holes, 
they ought to look at No. 16 at Cypress. If you want to go for it over the 
ocean, you've got a hell of a shot. But there's also a nice, little place to 
lay up. You take some of these new ones, like that PGA West, they don't have a 
place for the short knocker to hit his shot. 
</P>
<P>
"There's too many grunt-and-groan courses being built. Golf is still a game, 
and it should be a pleasure to play." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nobody walks anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"The average guy would be a hell of a lot better off if he walked, but the 
clubs don't like that. There's big money to be made with the carts, so most 
them shoo away the caddies. There aren't many real caddies around anymore, 
which is too bad because one of the best things about golf is the walking." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Big money events, like the Nabisco, give a false view of the money list. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy could win five tournaments and another win just one, and if that one is 
the Nabisco, it upsets the whole apple cart. And only 30 guys play (the 
Nabisco), so it's not fair to all the other guys who don't get a shot at the 
big money. 
</P>
<P>
"I won 11 tournaments one year and made $35,000. I won the British Open once 
and got $600. I guess I came along too soon." 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Twenty of golf's finest shotmakers will play in an old-fashioned country 
club-type tournament, the Ronald McDonald Children's Charities Invitational, 
Nov. 15-19 at the new Sherwood CC in Thousand Oaks. Greg Norman is the host of 
the PGA team event, which will include two days of pro-am play, followed by a 
round of alternate shot, a round of scrambles and a final round of best ball 
for a purse of $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Norman will be paired with Jack Nicklaus, the architect of the 7,007-yard 
wooded course near Lake Sherwood. Other teams: Curtis Strange-Mark O'Meara, 
Mark Calcavecchia-Bruce Lietzke, Tom Kite-Hal Sutton, Arnold Palmer-Peter 
Jacobson, Lee Trevino-Andy Bean, Tom Weiskopf-Lanny Wadkins, Hale Irwin-Steve 
Jones, Ray Floyd-Chip Beck and Bernhard Langer-John Mahaffey. The winning team 
will collect $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
After the Sherwood tournament, Norman will conduct a clinic and play a 
nine-hole exhibition Nov. 20 at Newport Beach CC to raise money for the 
Assessment and Treatment Service Center for abused juveniles. . . . Also on 
Nov. 20, the City of Hope-Eric Tracy Open will be played at Braemar CC with 
LPGA pros Carolyn Hill and Donna Caponi participating. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
O'Neal Hadnott, 59, the Riviera golfer who won the L.A. City Senior 
championship, is a retired general surgeon from Marina del Rey. Before joining 
the seniors, Hadnott won club championships at Rancho Park in 1976 and Riviera 
in 1977. Honored as the "most senior golfer" in the tournament was 92-year-old

MARY STAR'S 5TH SHUTOUT STOPS DANIEL MURPHY, 32-0

<P>
One block south of Hollywood Boulevard's Walk of Fame, Mary Star High School's 
football team made a lasting impression on Daniel Murphy, shutting out the 
Nobles, 32-0, at Hollywood High on Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Stars' fifth shutout of the year, improving their record to 6-3 
overall, 4-2 in the Santa Fe League. Murphy remained winless, dropping to 0-9 
and 0-6. 
</P>
<P>
The win puts Mary Star in a second-place tie with El Segundo, which lost to 
Cantwell on Friday, 14-13. First-place St. Monica leads the league with records 
of 8-1 and 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
The Stars scored on their first two possessions of the game. The first 
touchdown came on a 16-yard pass from quarterback Anthony Racaza to receiver 
Nick Rugnetta. Shawn McEachern's extra-point attempt was no good, one of his 
three misses for the day. 
</P>
<P>
The next score came on a one-yard run by Vince Orlando, set up by a 21-yard 
pass play from Racaza to McEachern. Racaza finished the game with six of 12 
completions for 80 yards, one touchdown and an interception. 
</P>
<P>
Rugnetta scored again in the second quarter on a 20-yard reverse to give Mary 
Star a 19-0 lead. The Mary Star defense limited Murphy to 106 total yards, 
intercepted Noble quarterback Jesus Williams three times, and recovered two 
fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
"When you go into a game, you want your defense to shut (the opponent) out," 
Mary Star Coach Mike Marinkovich said. "Defense is what wins games, and that's 
what won the game today." 
</P>
<P>
Marinkovich praised sophomore linebacker Mike Baker, who delivered some 
ferocious hits at the expense of Murphy ballcarriers. "We had some good, crisp 
hitting today," the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
Fullback Ernie Gregg and McEachern tallied second-half touchdowns to finish the 
scoring for Mary Star. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Star completes its regular season next week at Daniels Field against 
Cathedral.

NEW-LOOK CARSON WINS ON FINESSE; ERRATIC BANNING FALLS TO CRENSHAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's a new look to the Banning and Carson football teams as they prepare for 
their annual showdown Thursday night at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Banning looks uncharacteristically erratic, as evidenced by a 20-18 loss to 
Crenshaw on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
And Carson, once the model of hard-running football, has developed into, of all 
things, a finesse team on offense. 
</P>
<P>
Is nothing sacred? 
</P>
<P>
Carson went to a four-receiver passing offense last year to take advantage of 
the talents of quarterbacks Perry Klein and Fred Gatlin. But the Colts kept 
defenses honest with a balanced attack that featured running back Errol Sapp 
and an outstanding offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Carson is passing out of necessity because of an inexperienced 
group of running backs and offensive linemen. Through seven games, the Colts 
(6-1) have passed for 1,000 more yards than they've rushed for, 1560-560. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way we can run over teams like we used to," Coach Gene Vollnogle 
said. "We have to out-finesse them. We'd like to run the ball, but we're just 
not physically able to do that." 
</P>
<P>
The Colts never tried to establish a running game Friday night in a 29-8 
Pacific League-opening win over Dorsey at Veterans Stadium. Quarterback Armin 
Youngblood came out throwing and didn't stop until he had shattered the school 
record with 40 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Carson, most of the passes failed to find their way to Colt 
receivers. Youngblood was only 16 of 40 and was intercepted five times, setting 
a rather dubious school record in the process. 
</P>
<P>
But with the help of a dominating defense and the sure hands of wide receiver 
Michael Ross, the Colts didn't need many completions to destroy Dorsey. 
Youngblood finished with 298 yards passing and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Ross became the most prolific pass receiver in Carson history with eight 
catches for 205 yards and touchdowns of 71 and 29 yards. The school records set 
by the senior included: 
</P>
<P>
Most catches in a career, 65, breaking the old mark of 64 set by Jamie Williams 
in 1982-83. 
</P>
<P>
Most receiving yardage in a career, 1,266, breaking the old mark of 1,241 set 
by Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Most receiving yardage in a game, 205, breaking the old mark of 172 set by 
Melvin Smith in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Most touchdown catches in a career, 17, tying the record shared by Wesley 
Walker (1971-72) and Ron Carver (1966-67). 
</P>
<P>
Most touchdown catches in a season, 10, tying the record shared by Walker 
(1971) and Michael Wilson (1976). 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little surprised," said Ross, when informed of his 205-yard night. "But 
I had a feeling I was close to 200. I just try to make the big plays." 
</P>
<P>
Vollnogle says Carson will be more capable of making big plays when Tydus 
Winans, the Colts' other starting wide receiver, returns to the lineup. Winans 
sat out his second consecutive game with a strained achilles tendon, but might 
return for Thursday's 7 p.m. game with Banning. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully we'll get the other half of our offense going (next week) with 
Winans," Vollnogle said. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhat overlooked, except to the coaches, has been the excellent play of 
Carson's defense. 
</P>
<P>
Led by linebackers Edgar Ta'Ase and Nkosi Littleton, the Colts held Dorsey to 
46 total yards and just two yards rushing. They have allowed only 106 yards 
rushing this season, but are a long way from the school record. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 Carson defense gave up minus 90 yards rushing in 12 games. If you are 
wondering how a team could hold opponents to minus yardage for an entire 
season, remember that sacks count against rushing totals in prep football. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, outside linebacker Arnold Ale, who is redshirting at UCLA after 
playing for Notre Dame's national championship team last year, set Carson 
records for most sacks (22), most tackles for losses (43) and most yards 
tackled for losses (222) in a season. 
</P>
<P>
Banning, after building an 18-0 lead midway through the third quarter, 
eventually lost to Crenshaw when Kevin Hicks returned a punt 79 yards for a 
touchdown with 4:37 left to play at Gardena High. 
</P>
<P>
Vollnogle said he will try to keep the ball away from Hicks when Carson meets 
Crenshaw on Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
"That guy is super," the coach said. "He's the best running back I've seen. 
We're not going to kick the ball to him. He's like the Rocket (Raghib Ismail) 
they have at Notre Dame." 
</P>
<P>
Vollnogle didn't think Banning's first loss (the Pilots are 6-1-1) would have 
much of an effect on either team heading into Thursday's game. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it will bother them," he said. "The Banning-Carson game is still 
the Banning-Carson game. Banning is going to play their best game, and 
hopefully we're going to play our best game." 
</P>
<P>
The message on the marquee outside Hawthorne High on Friday night read, "This 
is the big one!" 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Hawthorne, it turned out to be a big one for the Leuzinger 
football team. 
</P>
<P>
The Olympians assured themselves of a spot in the Southern Section Division II 
playoffs with a 23-14 victory, handing Hawthorne its first loss of the year and 
dropping the Cougars into a first-place tie in the Bay League with Palos 
Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
"They kicked our butts, that's all there is to it," said Hawthorne Coach Goy 
Casillas, whose team, ranked No. 1 in Division II, fell to 8-1 overall and 5-1 
in league play. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback-defensive back Zac Odom was perhaps Leuzinger's most determined 
player. After allowing Hawthorne wide receiver Jermaine Jones to slip past him 
for a six-yard touchdown catch in the first quarter, Odom tripped and fell on 
the Hawthorne track. This led to some finger-pointing by Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Odom responded by leading Leuzinger to 16 unanswered points in the second 
quarter, including a two-yard touchdown run. Hawthorne pulled within 16-14 on a 
39-yard run by tailback Chris Alexander in the third quarter, but Odom again 
gave Leuzinger a cushion with a 54-yard touchdown pass to receiver Donald Byrd. 
</P>
<P>
With one game remaining, Leuzinger (7-1-1, 4-1-1) pulled a half-game behind 
co-leaders Hawthorne and Palos Verdes (8-1, 5-1) in the Bay League race. All 
have clinched playoff berths. 
</P>
<P>
Still fighting for a post-season bid are Rolling Hills (6-2-1, 3-2-1) and Santa 
Monica (5-3, 3-3). With only four possible spots available, counting a 
wild-card berth, the last playoff position will be determined in Thursday's 
Palos Verdes-Rolling Hills and Leuzinger-Santa Monica games. 
</P>
<P>
Most teams play on Thursday this week because Veterans Day will be honored on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
West Torrance clinched its first league title in three years Friday night with 
a decisive 52-14 win over visiting North Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
The Ocean League champions were led by running back Josh Moore, who scored 
three touchdowns on runs of 34, 7 and 93 yards to help the Warriors improve to 
8-1 overall and 6-0 in league play. North (2-7, 2-4) was eliminated from 
playoff contention. 
</P>
<P>
The lone bright spot for North was wide receiver Eric Hansen, who caught eight 
passes to give him a South Bay single-season record of 80. He also moved into 
the No. 10 spot on the all-time CIF-Southern Section list. 
</P>
<P>
After West, four Ocean League teams are contending for the two remaining 
guaranteed spots in Division VII playoffs. In games Thursday, second-place 
South (4-2 in league) faces North, third-place Redondo (3-2-1) meets Mira Costa 
(3-3), and Morningside (3-3) plays last-place Centennial.

CLU ENDS SEASON ON WINNING NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nietzsche believed in the inevitability of returns, and after what happened at 
Mt. Clef Stadium on Saturday, Cal Lutheran Coach Bob Shoup appears to be a 
believer as well. 
</P>
<P>
Against Azusa Pacific, Shoup took a chance repeating a mistake as his theory on 
the inevitability of returns seems to be more along the lines of, "If at first 
you don't succeed, try, try again." 
</P>
<P>
Last week at a crucial point in a game against Southern Utah State, Shoup 
called for a reverse on a kickoff return. Disastrously, Craig Ashley fumbled 
the handoff from Eddie Hoffman, Southern Utah went on to score and Cal Lutheran 
went on to lose. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, however, on a gorgeous day in a year in which little else has gone 
right for the Kingsmen, perhaps this return was fated to be a success. 
</P>
<P>
The freshmen Hoffman and Ashley, man and superman on this particular play, 
executed the handoff flawlessly. Ashley dashed 42 yards to the Azusa Pacific 
46, and three plays later, Cal Lutheran scored the winning touchdown with 9:46 
to play in a 21-17 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than dooming Shoup, this return helped ease the burden of last week's 
gaffe. 
</P>
<P>
"We practiced on it," Shoup said of the reverse. "I felt the ballgame was at a 
momentum-change point. If we didn't turn it around, Azusa was going to get 
stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Still, amid the celebration after the season finale for Cal Lutheran (3-6), 
Shoup's return as coach remained by no means inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Senior running back Dean Henderson said he was "sure" that Shoup would return; 
junior tight end Dave Deisinger said he thought Shoup would return; but, 
according to Shoup, the issue is still under negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
"From a coaching standpoint, it was a difficult week because everything is not 
settled," said Shoup, who has coached all 28 years of Kingsmen football. "I 
thought the players stayed out of that, and that's been true all year. We'll 
certainly work hard at (a settlement). Now that the season is over, it frees my 
time. If we can get it settled within a week or two, it would be good for all 
parties." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of next year, after watching his team finally produce in the clutch, 
Shoup said he would like to return to the first two games of the season, losses 
to Sonoma State and St. Mary's, and play them over. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 10-7, at halftime, the Kingsmen responded to a Shoup pep talk with 
two second-half touchdowns and some stern defense. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Whitney returned the second-half kickoff to the 42, and Cal Lutheran 
quarterback Dan Nagelmann directed a 14-play, 68-yard touchdown drive that 
consumed more than seven minutes and put the Kingsmen ahead, 14-10. 
</P>
<P>
Nagelmann sneaked from inches away for the touchdown after Cal Lutheran had 
simply hammered the last 12 yards with five consecutive rushing plays behind 
its physically superior offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought at halftime we pulled together really well," Shoup said. "We settled 
down and just decided to play rock-and-sock football and not get cutesy." 
</P>
<P>
Although it could manage only 53 yards of total offense and one first down in 
the second half, Azusa Pacific (4-4) capitalized on a fumble by Hoffman, one of 
four Cal Lutheran turnovers, to regain the lead with a 25-yard touchdown drive 
early in the fourth quarter. Ashley immediately answered with his kickoff 
return. 
</P>
<P>
Nagelmann then hit Tom Leogrande for seven yards and Deisinger for 20 to set up 
Henderson's 19-yard touchdown run. Henderson, who led Cal Lutheran with 82 
yards in 13 carries, found a gaping hole on a draw play and jitterbugged for 
the score. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa Pacific quarterback Fitz Wilson led all rushers with 95 yards in 14 
carries and ran for a touchdown. He completed only seven of 22 passes, but one 
was a 35-yard first-half touchdown toss to wide receiver Kevin Griffin on a 
double reverse, flea flicker.

EL CAMINO DEFEATS LONG BEACH, 40-15 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As strong-armed quarterback Frank Dolce goes, so goes the pass-happy offense at 
El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night at Long Beach Veterans Stadium, Dolce cranked up his right arm 
for 316 yards, and as a result, the El Camino scoring machine, which had been 
in the doldrums of late, got a jump start as well. Dolce and his fleet of 
talented receivers led El Camino to a 40-15 victory over host Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, Dolce dipped into El Camino's aerial arsenal for these gems: 
</P>
<P>
* A first-quarter strike over the top of the Long Beach defense that was tipped 
by cornerback James Brown into the hands of El Camino's Khevin Pratt, who 
tucked the ball away for a 34-yard touchdown play. 
</P>
<P>
* A 41-yard bullet to Pratt in the second quarter that set up Louis Perez' 
32-yard field goal to give El Camino a 17-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
* A tight spiral to flanker David Blakes, who sprinted with the ball to the end 
zone for a 35-yard TD play with 11 seconds left in the first half. A 41-yard 
completion to Blakes set up Perez's 22-yarder at the start of the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, the Warriors improved to 8-0 overall and 7-0 in the Mission 
Conference. El Camino, ranked first in the state and third in the nation by JC 
Grid-Wire, They also took another stride toward their hopes of another 
undefeated season. 
</P>
<P>
The victory also extended the school's nation-best winning streak to 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
Dolce completed 21 of his 30 passes. The Warriors held Long Beach (3-5 overall) 
to 235 yards of total offense, and treated quarterback Damon Fisher roughly. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach flanker Oscar Ford scored the Vikings' only two touchdowns -- one on 
an 84-yard kickoff return in the second quarter, and on a nine-yard pass play 
from replacement quarterback Steven Jones in the fourth.

SOUTHWEST OUTPLODS SANTA BARBARA, 18-15 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN LINDSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its homecoming game, L.A. Southwest College turned in a sporadic offensive 
performance to come away with an 18-15 win over Santa Barbara College. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Craig Manigo sealed the victory with a 37-yard touchdown pass to 
sophomore wide receiver Ansel Littlejohn with 3:48 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
The win lifts the Cougars to 6-1-1 overall and 5-1-1 in the Western State 
Conference's Northern Division. The Vaqueros drop to 4-4 overall and 3-4 in the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest travels to Harbor College next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, when Southwest scored its only points on a 38-yard field 
goal by Jason Thomson and trailed, 9-3, Manigo completed only four of nine 
passes for 23 yards. He was also the team's leading rusher with four carries 
for 45 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara was equally sluggish on offense in the first half, but its 
defense took up the slack. The Vaqueros scored a touchdown in the first quarter 
on a 73-yard interception return by freshman defensive back Paul Perkins. They 
added two points in the second quarter when linebacker Calvin Young tackled 
Manigo for a safety. 
</P>
<P>
Manigo came alive in the second half, completing nine of 16 passes for 130 
yards and a touchdown. Overall, he completed 13 of 25 for 153 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Manigo finished with 66 yards rushing on six carries, and William Jarrett 
picked up 51 yards on nine carries. Jarrett's six-yard touchdown run in the 
third quarter and a two-point conversion put Southwest ahead, 10-9. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara quarterback Ted Robison completed 16 of 30 passes for 168 yards 
and one touchdown, a 43-yarder to wide receiver Victor Prince in the fourth 
quarter that temporarily regained the lead for the Vaqueros, 15-10. 
</P>
<P>
The Southwest defense was led by Chris Mims, who had four of his team's seven 
quarterback sacks.

PALMDALE FLOPS AFTER 28 OF ITS PLAYERS JOIN FOR COIN FLIP AGAINST CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM BROWN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The setup: How many Palmdale High players does it take to flip a coin? 
</P>
<P>
The punch line: 28. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction: Canyon Coach Harry Welch didn't get it. 
</P>
<P>
When Welch turned the corner of the bleachers before the Palmdale-Canyon game 
Friday night, he was met by the sight of his four co-captains facing off at 
midfield with 28 members of Palmdale's team. Four of the Falcons actually were 
at the 50-yard line, while the rest lined up along the hash marks. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it doesn't matter," Welch said Saturday. "But I'd like to stay within 
the rules. I do believe, if it is a violation of the rules . . . then it 
shouldn't be done. I thought you could only have four, maximum. That's what 
I've been told." 
</P>
<P>
Kent Bothwell, the first-year coach of a Palmdale program that has taken its 
lumps this season, said the display was a tribute to his seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a unity thing for our leadership, our seniors," he said. The final 
punch line? Canyon won the flip, and the game, 42-6. 
</P>
<P>
Round two to Casey: For Jerome Casey, it was simply a matter of respect. 
</P>
<P>
In Sylmar's 28-8 win over Grant on Friday, the back-of-all-trades rushed for 
147 yards, scored three touchdowns, passed for another and delivered some 
teeth-chattering blows from his safety position. 
</P>
<P>
His best shots, however, were reserved for a certain diminutive tailback from 
Reseda. Two weeks ago, one Joey Tushnet -- all 5-foot-6, 150 pounds of him -- 
wondered aloud, real loud, whether Casey was indeed the area's best back. That, 
of course, came after Reseda's 20-6 win over Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
Casey, who leads area City Section schools in rushing and scoring, took some 
exception. "Pound for pound, inch for inch, I'm a better man and athlete than 
he'll ever be," Casey said. "He didn't have to say nothing about me." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks, bro: The headline in the Nov. 3 edition of Highlander Highlights, the 
student newspaper at Granada Hills, reads "Jeremy Leach Breaks New Mexico 
Record." 
</P>
<P>
Leach, who quarterbacked the Highlanders to the City Section 4-A Division 
championship in 1987, has indeed set two career passing marks at New Mexico in 
little over a season and a half. 
</P>
<P>
The story was authored by Leach's younger brother, Josh, which might cause some 
to question the story's objectivity. 
</P>
<P>
But Josh didn't pull any punches. He pointed out that his brother's favorite 
target has been Terence Mathis, who ranks fourth on the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn.'s career reception yardage list. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote: "Together the accomplishments of Leach and Mathis should bring a 
little recognition to an otherwise dismal season. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it, at 1-7, the Lobos need about as much recognition as they can 
get." 
</P>
<P>
Lester the motivator: Lester Hayes, the pontificating Judge in his playing days 
as a cornerback for the Los Angeles Raiders, handed out a little of his 
legalese Friday night on the sideline of the Hart-Schurr football game. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, a friend of Joe McKeon, an assistant for Hart's freshman team, took in a 
14-14 first half, then gathered the Indians around him before the second half 
began. 
</P>
<P>
"Half the kids didn't know what he was saying, but they were impressed," Hart 
Coach Mike Herrington said. "He was flashing those Super Bowl rings around and 
the kids got a little starry-eyed and came out to play." 
</P>
<P>
Hart scored three times in the second half to win, 35-28. 
</P>
<P>
Lost in the mail: A communication error was the reason the Alemany boys' 
cross-country team missed the Del Rey League finals Wednesday at La Mirada 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
The meet, which was at St. John Bosco, was originally scheduled for Nov. 2 but 
was rescheduled one day earlier so that Del Rey races would not conflict with 
the Suburban League championships, according to St. John Bosco Coach Tim 
McIntosh. McIntosh said he mailed information regarding the change to all the 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea why it didn't get to me. I have no idea where it ended up," 
said Dudley Rooney, Alemany's athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they mailed the communication so I will assume it was our fault. It 
was an unfortunate misunderstanding." 
</P>
<P>
Indians' Coach Pat Connelly, however, was fit to be tied. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was putting on the meet, I would have personally called everyone," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The start of the meet was delayed for 30 minutes while officials waited for 
Alemany to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
Alemany's absence from the finals, however, will not affect the league 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola (4-0), St. John Bosco (3-1) and Crespi (2-2) placed first, second and 
third based on dual-meet results and will advance to the 3-A preliminaries 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
St. Francis (1-3) and Alemany (0-4) finished fourth and fifth. 
</P>
<P>
This, too, shall pass: Franklin quarterback Santiago Alvarez, who passed for 
324 yards in a 57-0 victory over Verdugo Hills on Friday, tied a state record 
with his eight touchdown passes. The mark put Alvarez in good company. 
</P>
<P>
Other California players with eight touchdown passes in a game: Mike Smith of 
Los Altos, 1982; John Paye of Menlo, 1982; Kevin Tinney of Kennedy of 
Sacramento, 1987; Jim McKinley of Menlo, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, of course, went on to play basketball at BYU, and he was the Boston 
Celtics' first-round pick earlier this year. Paye became a quarterback at 
Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
The national record is nine, set by Randy Hendricks at Seth Sherman of West 
Virginia in 1972.

OCCIDENTAL SQUEAKS PAST REDLANDS

Ronnie Cunningham made a spectacular -- and controversial -- diving 
interception in the waning moments of a Southern California Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference game Saturday night, giving Occidental a 21-17 victory over 
Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
The matchup figured to be close, pitting Redlands, the conference's top 
offensive and defensive team, against Occidental, which is second in both 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
Redlands loudly protested Cunningham's interception, claiming the ball was 
trapped. The turnover came seconds after Brian Harmon hit Ricky Jacobs with a 
17-yard pass to the Occidental 38. The play, which came on a fourth-and-15 
situation, breathed new life into the Bulldogs' final drive. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental is 6-2 overall, 4-1 in conference play. Redlands is 4-4 and 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
With 3:08 to play in the third quarter Saturday, John Thebeau cut Redlands' 
deficit to 21-17 with a 39-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental took the opening kickoff of the second half and -- sparked by a 
28-yard Gary Little gallop -- marched to the Redlands' two. After two 
unsuccessful attempts by Little to dive in the end zone, Kevin Vegas pushed the 
ball over the goal line and the Tigers increased their lead to 21-14. 
</P>
<P>
Redlands drove 82 yards in seven plays on its first possession, taking a 6-0 
advantage on Shaun Trejo's 11-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Redlands dodged a bullet late in the second quarter with the score tied, 14-14. 
The Tigers, who had marched 50 yards in 11 plays, scored an apparent touchdown 
when Tony Werbelow hit Rob Leinbach, who caught the ball at the two and 
squirmed into the end zone. But Occidental was caught with an illegal receiver 
downfield and the play was nullified. 
</P>
<P>
Two plays later, Werbelow found Marc Krock on a 27-yard pass in the right 
corner of the end zone. This apparent score was also called back, this time on 
a holding penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 14-6, with 8:43 to play in the half, Redlands evened the score when 
Trejo cut off left tackle and rambled in from the Tigers' 11. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon faked the hold on the conversion try and ran untouched into the end zone 
to tie the sore. The touchdown run -- Trejo's second of the game -- capped a 
four-play, 27-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
Little, who led all rushers with 149 yards in 39 carries, charged in from the 
two with 49 seconds to play in the first quarter to give the Tigers a 14-6 
edge. 
</P>
<P>
Curt Landreth, the conference's leading rusher, led Redlands with 135 yards in 
19 carries. SAM FARMER

AS THE DEBRIS SETTLES, THE POLITIANS SHAKE ; 
</P>

GOVERNMENT: CALIFORNIA'S ELECTED LEADERS CAME THROUGH AFTER THE QUAKE, BUT THE 
STATE NEEDS LONG-TERM RELIEF FROM ITS 'NO-TAX, NO-SPEND' POLICIES.

Crisis mobilizes public opinion and public opinion motivates politicians. 
Response to crisis is not only a function of gov ernment, it is a test of its 
political survival. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the Northern California earthquake Oct. 17, the state's 
political leadership re-emerged. Styles differed, but the job generally got 
done. 
</P>
<P>
The conduct of California politicians at every level of government may have 
helped to raise their low public esteem. Officials whose districts were hardest 
hit were out being visible, comforting victims, expediting help. The state's 
usually fractious congressional delegation worked with a unity rarely seen to 
secure federal disaster aid. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos and Assembly Transportation Committee Chair 
Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) staked out a strong media presence. Agnos, like Katz, 
appeared active, aggressive, knowledgeable -- and all over the tube. 
</P>
<P>
With less media hype, but with no less competence, Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, 
acting governor when the quake hit, and Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson showed calm 
and quiet authority. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian started strong. He returned from abroad to take charge 
quickly. He appeared prescient in demanding his "prudent" reserve. But 
questions remain about how much will be available for earthquake relief and how 
much has been exhausted already to cover Deukmejian's initial underfunding of 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
And the governor may lose the debate over responsibility for Caltrans' inept 
handling of infrastructure maintenance policy. Deukmejian insisted that nobody 
informed him of the Nimitz Freeway problems. Of course not. His leadership 
style and political philosophy discourage that. 
</P>
<P>
Messages have come down loud and clear and constantly from the governor's 
office that spending must be cut or that programs must make do with already 
limited funds. 
</P>
<P>
Under those circumstances, what brave soul wants to tell the governor what he 
doesn't want to hear? Why bother to ship a memo upstairs when you already know 
what the response will be? Why risk rocking the boat? That's a standard 
bureaucratic response. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, state schools chief Bill Honig remained strangely quiet, 
despite the fact that damage to schools could reach $50 million to $100 
million. Why wasn't Honig out front early? Perhaps because Proposition 98 
guarantees the state's schools 40% of the state budget and the major share of 
any general-fund surplus. A post-quake tax increase proposal could change that. 
Finally, Honig seems to have accepted a temporary waiver of Proposition 98, but 
only if the schools are "treated as fairly as everyone else" in recouping 
earthquake losses. 
</P>
<P>
Despite infrastructure failures, the quake showed that government regulation 
works. Overall, newer structures, built according to tougher state and local 
earthquake standards, survived. Older structures and ill-maintained roads and 
buildings suffered greater damage. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Nimitz Freeway collapse demonstrated that regulation is not enough 
-- not without a continuing infusion of money and a strong political will. For 
more than a decade, since the passage of Proposition 13 and the Gann state 
spending limits, California has been unable to commit to either. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-tax fervor has forced years of bare-bones state and local budgets. 
Government officials are stuck with hard policy choices. Limited funds are 
spent on the most visible, popular or politically sensitive programs. 
</P>
<P>
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it. And don't fix it if it costs too much -- 
unless it is politically threatening." That became the politicians' mantra. And 
the most fervent acolyte has been Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
That's why long-term infrastructure maintenance and repair -- lacking immediate 
political gratification and sound-bite potential -- were deferred at every 
level of government. And social services for the poor -- never a powerful 
interest group -- suffered. And the state's health-care system atrophied. 
</P>
<P>
Now the quake has given us a graphic lesson in just how detrimental the "don't 
tax, don't spend" philosophy can be. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in Los Angeles County inadequate funding has forced homeless 
shelters to cut back or close programs. They are at or near capacity today. How 
will they cope with the tens of thousands of people in Los Angeles likely to be 
left homeless or stranded by a severe quake? 
</P>
<P>
And the decrease in health-care funding has forced trauma and health centers to 
close, leaving the county unprepared to cope with a catastrophic emergency. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of major arteries underscored how decrepit our state's 
infrastructure has become under Govs. Deukmejian and Edmund G. Brown Jr., and 
red-flagged the lack of alternative transportation systems, particularly in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Up north the earthquake made people angry and frustrated. Everywhere 
Californians are concerned and scared. Politicians are responding to those 
emotions. And the need to make the state whole again may liberate governments 
from the bondage of "no new taxes" politics. 
</P>
<P>
Even with a renewed will to spend, there are still hard fiscal and political 
realities to be faced. The federal government has kicked in $3.45 billion, for 
starters. But that was without identifying a funding source. Funding that 
appropriation means either a higher deficit or higher taxes. Should national 
disaster costs continue to climb, Congress may find itself confronting a major 
test of courage. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's supposed $1-billion budget reserve, now estimated by California's 
Commission on State Finance to be only $674 million, does not adequately cover 
the state's share of an estimated $7 billion in quake relief. So the governor 
softened his opposition to raising the state's tax burden -- temporarily, 
paving the way for the special legislative session called to enact a limited 
sales-tax increase to help fund earthquake relief and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
But stopgap measures are predicated on the assumption that current state 
spending will remain below the Gann limit. If expenditures escalate or if 
economic conditions shrink the budget reserve, the state could find itself 
smack up against the expenditure ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
There are a couple of possible responses, both of which are politically risky. 
The Gann initiative allows the Legislature to lift the state spending limit for 
one year in emergencies, but over-the-limit expenditures must be repaid during 
the following three years. That could mean a reduction in spending for social 
services, prisons and other state programs. 
</P>
<P>
For long-term relief, Gann requires that California voters decide whether or 
not the limit can be raised to permit increased tax revenues to be spent. That 
would mean scheduling a special election -- which the secretary of state's 
office estimates will take at least 90 days, or waiting even longer to put the 
question on the ballot at the next regular election. Either way, there is the 
risk of "out of sight, out of mind." As the months go by and the media's and 
government's attention turns to other issues, a tax increase would become 
harder to sell to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Also, quake relief may affect a delicate compromise reached by legislators and 
the governor -- Senate Constitutional Amendment 1, scheduled for the June, 
1990, ballot -- that would raise the Gann limits and allow a permanent gas-tax 
increase to fund a long-term transportation package. 
</P>
<P>
There is concern among politicians that the voters won't look kindly on 
enacting tax after tax. And current polls indicate weak support for the 
permanent gas levy. Said one Senate leadership aide, "It is troublesome to 
enact a tax now with SCA 1 on the ballot in June. That has to be thought out." 
Even in tragedy, politics is never far from policy. 
</P>
<P>
The exercise of leadership and the special legislative session to deal with the 
immediate aftermath of the quake are positive first steps, but they are not 
enough to ensure California's future. 
</P>
<P>
When the current crises abate, will our leaders have the courage to address the 
long-term needs and weaknesses spotlighted by this latest natural disaster? To 
do that requires money, political risk and bold thinking. It requires political 
leadership. And it requires sustained public support for changing an arbitrary 
spending limit that hamstrings government's ability to respond to emergencies. 
None of these have come easy to California in the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
Government must be able both to lead and react. This state's political 
environment has made governing difficult. But the Oct. 17 temblor may have 
shaken the foundations of California politics sufficiently to force a change. 
The greatest impact may have occurred when, borrowing Paul Conrad's symbolism, 
the Proposition 13 era was crushed beneath the rubble of the Nimitz Freeway.

<TEXT>
<P>
Like political reporters everywhere, those who live in the press gallery of 
Britain's House of Commons are a cynical lot -- and cynical, above all, about 
the Commons itself. It may proudly call itself the mother of parliaments, but 
usually the place is as ill-informed and predictable as you would expect when 
650 politicians are gathered together. Only occasionally does the House live up 
to its billing -- and it did so the afternoon of Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
At 5:26, Nigel Lawson who, until five days before, had been Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher's chancellor of the Exchequer (or chief finance minister), 
rose to tell his colleagues why he had resigned. Lawson is a proud, some would 
say, arrogant man -- and not usually a good orator. But his 10-minute speech 
(heard, unusually for the Commons, in total silence) was delivered with none of 
the pompous attitudes he often adopts, and it was electrifying. For he did 
nothing less than explain why Thatcher's government may be falling apart at the 
seams. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson had been chancellor since Thatcher's second election victory in 1983 but 
he was much more than that. Almost alone among the entourage, he had the 
ability to make the intellectual case for Thatcherism with a politician's 
instinct for what would play in the British equivalent of Peoria. He had cut 
taxes, privatized industries and deregulated the economy. From 1986 to 1988, 
when Britain grew faster than any other Western economy, he presided over the 
closest thing to a boom the country had seen for 30 years. If anyone deserved 
Thatcher's unstinting support, he did. But he did not get it. To understand 
why, you have to understand both Margaret Thatcher and Britain's current 
economic difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years of power have not diminished one of Thatcher's central traits. She 
thinks of herself as an outsider, enjoying the advice and company of other 
outsiders. In large measure, her perception of her own position is cracked. No 
woman before Thatcher had quite managed to snake her way into the charmed world 
of Britain's Conservative Party; and on her way to the top, she was patronized 
and dismissed by many of the smooth men who run it -- and who run Britain's 
Civil Service. She is not smooth. She is a provincial, suspicious of 
metropolitan charms. Her whole political life has been dedicated to bucking the 
conventional wisdom, and she revels in it. She is one of those infuriating 
people who, when they find themselves in a minority of one, are convinced they 
are right. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the British economic Establishment -- and Nigel Lawson -- think 
exchange-rate stability is a desirable goal in itself, and an invaluable weapon 
in the battle against inflation. They believe, moreover, that the best way for 
Britain to secure such stability would be for the pound to become a member of 
the European exchange-rate mechanism (or ERM) which, within narrow limits, sets 
rates for the currencies of members within the European community. 
</P>
<P>
Since most Establishment economists think the ERM is beneficial, it is not 
surprising that Thatcher does not -- even though she is nationally committed to 
joining it "when the time is right." She has long believed that attempts to 
manage the currency markets are futile; yet that was Lawson's policy. When 
currency dealers were selling the pound (which makes Britain's imports more 
expensive, and hence raises domestic inflation) he would raise interest rates 
to maintain the value of the currency. British rates are now at 15%. This, be 
it noted, is in a country where almost all home loans are floating rate, which 
means that interest-rate hikes hurt -- and since most home owners vote 
Conservative, it is Thatcher's people who feel the pinch. 
</P>
<P>
Hence the prime minister had some political grounds for feeling annoyed with 
Lawson, and she was much supported by the views of one of her unsmooth, 
provincial chums -- Sir Alan Walters, a British economist who has long spent 
most of his time in America (at the World Bank or Johns Hopkins University). 
Walters has offered Thatcher economic advice for most of the 1980s, and this 
year was scheduled to spend half his time in her employ. His views on 
exchange-rate management are robust; he thinks it stinks. The ERM, he said in 
an article published only last week, is "half-baked." In Lawson's view, "No 
case can be made for seeming confusion or vacillation between the two 
positions"; Walters' article was "the tip of a singularly ill-concealed 
iceberg, with all the destructive potential that icebergs possess." When it 
became clear to Lawson that the prime minister would not settle the confusion 
by sacking Walters, he resigned. Walters himself followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
In one interpretation, Lawson's going does no more than confirm that Thatcher 
is autocratic, intensely loyal to supporters and incapable of admitting that 
she is wrong -- characteristics we have all recognized for years. But there is 
far more to it than that. 
</P>
<P>
Though she is still only 64, Thatcher is the last of her generation of British 
politicians. Her political outlook was shaped by World War II and its 
aftermath. She came of age at a time when the countries of Western Europe were 
either in ruins or the enemies of Britain, but when American troops were its 
savior. She grew up, not so incidentally, in the part of Britain where most 
Americans were stationed; I like to think that as an impressionable 
Lincolnshire school girl, she bicycled down the lanes with some firm-jawed GI

For Margaret Thatcher, commitment to the Atlantic Alliance is a deeply 
emotional thing, one that long predates her relationship with Ronald Reagan. 
America is steadfast, or at least, it always has been for her. Europeans, she 
thinks, are not to be trusted; they are devious when not woolly, but usually 
both. 
</P>
<P>
No other prominent British politician thinks like this any more. They are fond 
of America, or most of them are, but they regard themselves as Europeans. 
Thatcher's ministers find that more and more of their business -- whether 
fighting terrorism, stopping drugs, cleaning up the environment or managing the 
economy -- is easier done if done with their colleagues in European 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
Nigel Lawson was, and is, firmly of this view. He is not a romantic dreaming 
about the United States of Europe, but he believes that Britain's destiny lies 
in a "Europe of nation states." If it did not join the ERM, he said, Britain 
would find its influence in Europe sorely diminished. 
</P>
<P>
Here lies the true significance of Lawson's departure. Even those calling 
themselves Thatcherites no longer follow her line on Europe. One young minister 
to whom she is quite close told me this week, "There simply are no votes to be 
won in being anti-European now." Yet given the chance to set her face against 
Europe -- and ERM is the most potent symbol of European cooperation -- she took 
it. 
</P>
<P>
If Thatcher took it in the knowledge that Britain had somewhere to go other 
than Europe, her action would at least have been understandable. But that is 
not the case. For all of this year, the State Department has been signaling 
that the Reagan years are over, that relations with West Germany are more 
important for America than relations with Britain and that Britain must start 
playing an ungrudging part in the building of a stronger, more integrated 
European Community. Like Adm. Nelson, the British hero who clapped a telescope 
to his blind eye when he saw the flags ordering retreat, the prime minister has 
ignored everything that has come out of Washington. Sometimes -- more often 
than her enemies admit -- her gut instincts have been those of most of the 
British people. But on Europe, she has lost touch with those who -- like Nigel 
Lawson -- have supported her for so long, and as they withdraw their support, 
so the final departure of this remarkable 20th-Century leader slides quietly 
into view.

NEW HUNGARY REPUBLIC FULFILLS THE DREAM OF '56 FREEDOM FIGHTERS;

On Oct. 23, church bells rang throughout Hungary to commemorate the anniversary 
of the 1956 uprising against Soviet rule, and tens of thousands of Hungarians 
cheered as Matyas Szuros, the acting president, announced the nation would 
henceforth be the Hungarian Republic, no longer the Socialist People's 
Republic. Zuros said: "The Hungarian Republic is going to be an independent, 
democratic and legal state." He said the new Hungary would reflect the spirit 
of the 1956 "National Independence Movement." 
</P>
<P>
This is thrilling news, but most especially for those who closely followed 
Hungarian events in 1956 -- as I did, professionally. The Hungarian people are 
now on the threshold of achieving peacefully what they almost achieved by that 
rebellion. To better understand the astounding implication of these political 
developments, it is worth looking at some details of the 1956 revolt not fully 
reported at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Nikita S. Khrushchev, after Josef Stalin's death, had become leader of the 
Soviet Union. He proclaimed a relaxation of tensions and a thaw in police 
control in Eastern Europe. Intellectuals, especially writers and students, were 
the first to respond and, by late 1955, an influential anti-Stalinist movement 
was at work -- most notably in Poland and Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary's leader was Matyas Rakosi, the most brutal Stalinist tyrant in Eastern 
Europe. He was famous for his "salami tactics" -- eliminating all dissenters 
"slice by slice." At the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party in 
February, 1956, Khrushchev, in a secret speech, savagely exposed the crimes of 
Stalin. The contents of the speech became known in the early summer, leading 
Hungarian writers to attack Rakosi openly. He was soon removed and retired to 
exile in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
His removal whetted the appetites of Hungarians, who increased their calls for 
political and economic change. There was remarkable freedom in the press, with 
articles exposing political corruption and harsh living conditions. But Rakosi 
was replaced by Erno Gero, another Stalinist unresponsive to the intellectuals' 
complaints. Gero's inaction inspired a growing demand for the return of Imre 
Nagy, a popular communist reformer, who had once been premier. 
</P>
<P>
On the morning of Oct. 23, 1956, university students put up posters throughout 
Budapest, calling for Soviet troops to be withdrawn from Hungary, a new 
government under Nagy, economic restructuring, freedom of speech and press and 
restoration of the Hungarian Kossuth emblem (Louis Kossuth led the War of 
Independence against the Austrian Hapsburgs in 1848-1849. The troops of Russian 
Czar Nicholas I came to the rescue of the Austrians, and ultimately defeated 
the Hungarians.) 
</P>
<P>
At 3 p.m., a young student recited the national anthem to the cheering crowds. 
The words came from a poem first read at the outbreak of the Revolution of 
1848. At 8 o'clock that night, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators gathered 
at the Parliament to listen to a speech by Nagy, calling for a new government. 
During the speech, shots were fired by police, loyal to Gero. 
</P>
<P>
But the police could not disperse the crowds, some of whom marched to the huge 
bronze statue of Stalin. With blow torches, they sent it crashing to the 
ground. Sporadic fighting continued through the night. When Gero saw that the 
police had lost control, he called for intervention by Soviet forces. Soon, the 
students and writers were joined by armed factory workers, and then by units of 
the Hungarian army. 
</P>
<P>
Quickly, the news spread throughout Hungary. America's Radio Free Europe, based 
in Munich, was broadcasting every scrap of news about the uprising. Manned by 
Hungarian exiles who had current information about developments in Poland as 
well as Hungary, the broadcasts, though heavily jammed, became the main source 
of information for the Hungarian people. Partly because of the radio -- but 
also because U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles had proclaimed a goal 
of liberation for Eastern Europe -- many Hungarians believed their rebellion 
would be supported by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
There was consternation in the Kremlin. The Soviet Politburo was called into 
24-hour session. Although not reported at the time, Khrushchev was holding long 
telephone conversations with Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai, the leaders of 
China. In fact, a Chinese delegation, headed by Liu Shao-chi, was dispatched to 
Moscow. After discussing the various possible courses of action, they agreed 
not to use military force in Hungary. The Chinese went even further, 
recommending the Soviet Union leave Hungary. Soviet Politburo members Anastas 
Mikoyan and Mikhail A. Suslov were sent to Budapest with instructions to 
negotiate an armistice with Nagy. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 28, it was agreed that Soviet forces were to leave Hungary, and Nagy 
would be recognized as prime minister, with Gen. Paul Maletar, commander of the 
Hungarian armed forces, as defense minister. In the next 24 hours, Soviet 
forces were withdrawn from Budapest, and one of the four Soviet divisions had 
left Hungary. Nagy moved rapidly to form a multiparty government -- including 
representatives of the old Democratic Socialist and Peasant parties. Nagy 
proposed that Hungary be granted neutral status similar to Austria. He hoped 
the Western powers would support this. Indeed, the U.S. government subsequently 
learned that one reason the Soviets and Chinese considered it prudent for the 
Red Army to withdraw from Hungary was because they expected the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization to support the freedom fighters. 
</P>
<P>
During September, 1956, while our wives were vacationing, I shared a house with 
two high ranking British diplomats, one the former senior aide to Prime 
Minister Anthony Eden. Night after night, they talked with growing anger and 
frustration about the intolerable behavior of Gamal Abdel Nasser, the Egyptian 
leader who had nationalized the Suez Canal. After all, the Suez Canal was more 
important to Britain and other Europeans than the Panama Canal was to the 
United States, but the United States, they felt, was showing insufficient 
concern. Not until a month later did I understood the terrible implications of 
this impasse. 
</P>
<P>
For the Hungarian freedom fighters were struck down as a result of the actions 
the British ultimately decided to take. On Oct. 30, using the Hungarian events 
as cover, British, French and Israeli troops invaded Egypt in an attempt to 
regain control of the Suez Canal. Eden had launched the invasion without 
consulting the United States. Furthermore, the invasion came in the last days 
of the U.S. election campaign between President Dwight D. Eisenhower and 
</P>
<P>
Adlai E. Stevenson. Secretary of State Dulles was enraged at the allies' 
deception -- especially because of the implications for Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
The issue was immediately taken to the U.N. Security Council. Khrushchev had 
announced that, unless the invading forces left Egypt, he was prepared to send 
Soviet "volunteer" forces to assist Nasser. However, the Security Council 
reached an unusual consensus: the United States and Canada, joined by the 
Soviet Union and China, voted that the British, French and Israeli forces 
should end the invasion at once. But the damage was done. While the world 
spotlight was focused on the Middle East, Khrushchev ordered his troops back 
into Hungary. On Nov. 4, massive Soviet tank units entered Budapest, and 
crushed the rebellion, in a bloody battle. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarians fought fiercely, with more than 20,000 killed, and 150,000 
wounded. Thousands of Soviets were killed as well, but they had broken the 
resistance. During the next month, more than 200,000 Hungarians escaped to the 
West. Nagy and Maletar were granted asylum in the Yugoslav Embassy, but were 
later captured and executed. Last month, Nagy was reburied with honors as a 
leader and patriot. 
</P>
<P>
In 1956, the odds were probably against the Hungarians, even if there had not 
been an invasion of Egypt. Khrushchev was an impulsive risk-taker, as revealed 
by his confrontation with President John F. Kennedy over Berlin, and his 
dispatch of medium-range nuclear missiles to Cuba. Yet if the United States, 
Britain and France had been working together, instead of apart, in 1956, it is 
possible to imagine a negotiated resolution, guaranteeing Hungarian neutrality 
on the Austria model. 
</P>
<P>
But that is not the way it was. In his book "Khrushchev Remembers" the Soviet 
leader reports a conversation between some British and French diplomats with 
their Soviet counterparts: "You seem to have some trouble on your hands in 
Poland and Hungary. We're having some troubles of our own in Egypt. Let's have 
a tacit understanding between us that you'll liquidate your difficulties by 
whatever means you see fit, and you won't interfere while we do the same." 
</P>
<P>
So the Hungarians' reach for freedom was snuffed out in both 1848 and 1956. Yet 
now there is another surge of hope. The prospects are brighter than at any time 
in Hungarian history. Last month, the Hungarian government and its Parliament 
took action calculated to transform Hungarian society with a new constitution 
that creates a multiparty system. 
</P>
<P>
The people of Hungary will probably vote for a majority of independent 
non-Communist representatives in the coming elections. There may be a coalition 
government, with important representation from the new Socialist Party, and 
Hungary probably will remain in the Warsaw Pact for a while -- but there will 
be growing links to Western Europe, and, in time, Hungary will likely become 
neutral between East and West, as Nagy proposed in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
The dangers of 1956 no longer exist. In a speech in Helsinki, on Oct. 25, 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said the Soviet Union has no moral or political 
right to interfere in the affairs of its East European neighbors. He praised 
neutral Finland, as a model of stability. The future of Eastern Europe is 
inevitably linked with Gorbachev and his new thinkers. Thus, it is clearly in 
U.S., Hungarian and Polish interests that they not fail.

IS ANYONE OUT THERE BLIPPING FOR THE GAS TAX?; 
</P>
<P>
HIGHWAYS: THERE'S CONFUSION ON THE POPULAR MOOD REGARDING THE STATE 
TRANSPORTATION INITIATIVE. IS IT GAINING OR NOT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Are California's voters any less phobic about higher taxes today than they were 
a year ago, when they embraced George Bush's no-new-taxes pledge? 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the voter appeal of a June ballot initiative that would, over time, 
raise the state gas tax by 9 cents a gallon to pay for highway and transit 
improvements. SCA 1, as the measure is known, would also raise the Gann 
spending limit to accommodate the new expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative enjoys the blessings of Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative 
leaders. But their endorsements, let's face it, stand little chance of 
reversing the state's decade-long aversion, first evident in passage of 
Proposition 13, against higher taxes -- no matter how noble the cause. 
</P>
<P>
Nature, however, might have accomplished what California politicians can only 
dream about. Last July, the California Poll rated SCA 1's chances of success at 
roughly 50%. Then came the Oct. 17 earthquake. Voters were so shaken up, 
according to the latest California Poll, that 9% more joined the yes-on-SCA 1 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
But a Los Angeles Times Poll, also taken after the San Francisco quake, 
indicates that nature has no such power. Only 25%, the same number as before 
the shaking started, said they would vote for SCA 1. 
</P>
<P>
The explanation may lie in how the tax question was put to the polls' 
respondents. In the Times Poll, no mention was made of how the new revenue 
would be spent. The California Poll, which used the initiative's wording to 
frame the question, specified the purpose. The Times question also got to the 
bottom line much faster: Do you want your gas taxes to go up? 
</P>
<P>
In explaining the conflicting findings, Mervin Field of the California Poll 
accused I.A. (Bud) Lewis of the Times Poll of asking a "very loaded question." 
Yet, he conceded that the gas-tax-hike issue may be in a state of flux. "My 
guess is (the poll jump) is a temporary blip." As for Lewis: "Mervin and I 
simply disagree." (In his private soundings, L.A. pollster Arnold Steinberg 
found SCA 1 "losing substantially" in San Diego and Orange counties.) 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), chairman of the Assembly Transportation 
Committee and a big booster of SCA 1, pooh-poohs the polling as an exaggeration 
of the electorate's mood. Support for the measure, he believes, is 45%, about 
where Field pegged it last summer. But Katz is justifiably anxious that the 
level of support isn't going to rise from there. 
</P>
<P>
The good news for SCA 1 backers is that followers of the late Paul Gann, whose 
spending limit would be lifted by passage of the initiative, are fence-sitting. 
The bad news is that they might not remain there.

FISHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William McCloskey's column ("Fishing Rights and Wrongs," Opinion, Oct. 29) on 
controversies surrounding the delayed reauthorization of the Magnuson Act 
concerning the U.S. fishing industry was a valuable report -- with one 
omission. 
</P>
<P>
Granted it is much harder to watch those intent on pillaging the seas than it 
is to catch those who devastate the land. But a start might be made simply in 
identifying the owners of the "fleet of large, Seattle-based U.S. fishing 
ships" whose greed impoverished 2,000 Alaskans. 
</P>
<P>
Does McCloskey not know who these corporate marauders are, or the names of 
those responsible for giving the order to dump back into the ocean 60,000 tons 
of wasted fish carcasses? These acts were committed by people, and there is 
some faint possibility that publicity, and brand names, might induce restraint, 
if not anything resembling shame.

TIME IS RUNNING OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For six months Congress has looked into allegations of multibillion dollar 
scandals, waste, mismanagement and influence-peddling at the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development. But the one person who might help Congress sort 
out the facts and shake out the truth, Samuel R. Pierce Jr., former secretary 
of HUD, testified once before a subcommittee and has since stonewalled the 
investigation by twice refusing to answer questions. His silence left little 
choice. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have requested the 
appointment of a special counsel to take over the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
An independent counsel could pursue the inquiry into the activities of Pierce, 
some of his top aides and a favored few who profited handsomely from some 
operations at HUD. But that can happen only if Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh 
overcomes his objections to the request as an act of "partisan" politics and 
appoints counsel quickly. Time is running out. 
</P>
<P>
Thornburgh is wrong about the request and his reaction illustrates perfectly 
the reason that special counsels are essential in such cases. There is nothing 
partisan about finally getting to the bottom of allegations of political 
favoritism, pay-offs and fraud that may have cost taxpayers more than $4 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
The need for haste lies in the law that set up the procedure for appointing 
independent counsel. The law provides that a special counsel has only one year 
in which to investigate a former Cabinet member after he or she leaves office. 
In Pierce's case, the deadline is Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce, appointed by former President Ronald Reagan, headed the federal housing 
department for eight years. During his tenure, federal housing funds were cut 
substantially; poor people in need of housing lost out. At the same time, 
well-connected Republicans siphoned off millions of dollars in consulting fees 
for arranging deals for certain developers. That money would have been better 
spent on rehabilitating housing as the taxpayers intended. 
</P>
<P>
There were other problems at HUD. Private mortgage brokers stole millions from 
the sale of foreclosed properties. In the rush to privatization as a way to cut 
costs, HUD cut too deeply into the ranks of government auditors, and the 
stealing was easy. The Federal Housing Administration, the government's largest 
real estate mortgage program, ran up billions of dollars in deficits. 
</P>
<P>
Is Pierce to blame for everything that went wrong at HUD? Absent his full and 
complete testimony, people may never know what exactly went wrong or how to 
prevent its happening again. A special counsel could clear up the mysteries.

NICARAGUA ENDS CONTRA TRUCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to The Times' editorial, Ortega has blown it again by announcing that 
his government will not renew a cease-fire with the Contras. The Times 
acknowledges that the Contras have violated the accord and killed many people 
(736 during the "cease-fire" according to the Nicaraguan government), but The 
Times asserts that the timing of Ortega's announcement at the Costa Rican 
summit puts the onus for the renewed fighting on him. 
</P>
<P>
If 763 American citizens were killed during a truce period, few Americans would 
challenge the moral legitimacy, indeed the necessity, of driving the killers 
out, but the dead (and the more numerous wounded) are merely Nicaraguans and 
their deaths should not be allowed to mar a public relations junket.

There it was for all to hear. The essential arrogance of the well-bred U.S. 
leader toward the head of an upstart antagonist country, conveyed in tones that 
betrayed all of the speaker's contempt: "That little man" (Part A, Oct. 29). 
Third World people, many of whom do not possess great physical stature, must 
have heard in those words all of the implied sense of superiority ingested by 
the white ruling elites of the world with their mothers milk. It is amazing 
that President Bush didn't say "little brown man." To add to the insult was 
"animal at a garden party." The racism was hardly sheathed. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow lost was the fact that the Nicaraguan leader was suggesting that the 
cease-fire might not be continued because the U.S. supported Contras were 
killing Nicaraguans trying to register to vote. Who are animals? Where else 
could he hope to get the attention of the democratic leaders of this hemisphere 
if not at their summit? Was this just a party? 
</P>
<P>
To the upper-class, decorum is all. It is not what is happening, but what seems 
to be happening that is important. Dress codes must be enforced. The leadership 
of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe are beginning to lead. Is it too much to 
hope that our leaders will come off their pedestals and start to relate to the 
real problems of the world?

SHAMIR IS GUARDING ISRAEL, NOT QUIBBLING; 
</P>
<P>
MIDDLE EAST: IT'S A MATTER OF SURVIVAL. TALKS CAN ONLY BE HELD WITH THOSE 
PALESTINIANS WHO WANT AND URGENTLY NEED PEACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Middle East peace process appears to have gotten so bogged down in arcana 
that only diplomats and specialists can follow its twists and turns. But the 
occasional reports and leaks that penetrate the public perplexity leave one 
clear impression: behind the obfuscation, it is Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's 
niggling insistence on procedural details that is keeping us from the dawn of 
Middle East peace -- and keeping the Bush Administration from a diplomatic 
triumph, the first-ever Israeli-Palestinian talks. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir has made a very large issue of two points. But they are about as 
procedural as Churchill's refusal to negotiate with Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
Point 1. Israel's peace initiative calls for free elections in the occupied 
territories to produce Palestinian negotiators to work out some interim peace 
("autonomy") that would end the Israeli military occupation. After three years 
of living together, after having reassessed each other's worst assumptions 
about the other's ultimate intentions, then and only then do negotiations start 
talking final peace, because only then can they have any chance of success. 
</P>
<P>
Elections, negotiation, interim solution, final status -- everybody but the 
Palestine Liberation Organization has accepted this sequence in principle. 
Nevertheless, an Egyptian plan pointedly puts the "final status" issue -- 
Israel's giving up the West Bank -- on the table before the first words are 
exchanged or the first ballot cast. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's "wrangling" is over demands for an ironclad American guarantee that 
the initial talks will be only about elections. Israel does not want to start 
talks that are destined from day one to fail and for which failure it is sure 
to be blamed. 
</P>
<P>
Point 2. Israel's other wrangle is to insist that the Palestinian negotiators 
who will arrange the elections be insiders (West Bankers) and not outsiders 
(Palestinians living abroad and representing the PLO establishment in Tunis). 
</P>
<P>
This is not a procedural point, because the only talks that can possibly 
succeed are talks between Israel and the insiders. It is true, of course, that 
both insiders and outsiders swear allegiance to the PLO. (Those who refuse have 
a way of getting shot: 125 of those killed during the intifada have been 
Palestinians killed by other Palestinians.) But there is a natural divergence 
of interests between insiders and outsiders in the Palestinian movement, and on 
every major issue, the insiders' interest is more favorable to peace. 
</P>
<P>
It is the insiders who suffer daily the dislocations and casualties of the 
intifada; thus their objective is to end the occupation quickly. For the 
outsiders, the intifada is a political boon. It revives an issue that had been 
dead for years. They are in no hurry. They can hold out to the last West Banker 
for their maximal demands. 
</P>
<P>
The first freely elected Palestinian leadership ever, though nominally pledged 
to Yasser Arafat, will enjoy a status and legitimacy rivaling that of the aging 
rejectionists in Tunis. Precisely for that reason the PLO is not happy about 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
It is conceivable that West Bankers would trade an end to occupation for a 
Palestinian entity that truly renounces all designs on Israel proper. The 
outsiders will not. The vast majority of them come not from the West Bank but 
from Israel proper. Their program is to use the West Bank as a staging point 
for returning to -- retaking -- what is now Israel. 
</P>
<P>
In sum, the insiders have a more urgent need for peace now and a more moderate 
objective for the final peace to come. That is what prompted Israel to propose, 
and the United States to back, West Bank elections. The whole point of the 
election idea is to get the peace process moving by exploiting the natural 
divergence of interests between insiders and outsiders and shifting the center 
of political gravity from the outside to the inside. 
</P>
<P>
Talks with outsiders -- representatives of the PLO in Tunis -- are guaranteed 
to fail. But don't you have to negotiate peace with your enemies? The answer to 
that fatuity is: There are enemies and there are enemies. You negotiate with 
enemies whose objective is somehow to settle with you. With those who want only 
to expunge you, there is nothing to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
Israel does not want to negotiate with PLO outsiders because it understands 
that such negotiations can only be about a single issue: a PLO state. For most 
Israelis, that is a prescription for national suicide. They are not interested 
in entering a negotiation whose purpose is to work out the finer modalities of 
their demise. 
</P>
<P>
That may look like procedure in Washington. In Jerusalem, it is life and death.

WOMEN CHEFS: CHECKING IN ON THE REVOLUTION; 
</P>
<P>
IT SEEMS THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH ROOM AT TOP, AFTER ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The stories have become legendary. There's the one about the male chef who was 
so infuriated about being asked to share his kitchen with a woman that he went 
up to the skylight and threw a pail of water on her. Another man welcomed a 
woman into his kitchen by sticking her cut finger into a bucket of salt. A 
third initiated his new woman helper by demanding that she instantly clean 25 
pounds of squid. And there are the other stories -- like the one about the 
woman who graduated from chef's school and went looking for a job in a 
professional restaurant only to be offered a job as a hat-check girl. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago all the articles about woman chefs began with the horror 
stories. Women chefs were a novelty, and every one of them had terrible tales 
to tell of her initiation into the business -- dozens of them. 
</P>
<P>
But then things started to change. Three years ago women chefs in Los Angeles 
finally seemed to be coming into their own. Lydia Shire had arrived to take 
charge of the kitchens at the new Four Seasons Hotel; she was the first female 
to become an executive chef in a major Los Angeles hotel. But she was not 
working in a vacuum -- there were so many women running kitchens in Los Angeles 
that they banded together to start the Woman's Culinary Alliance -- and give 
other women their support. "We don't have to prove ourselves anymore," said 
Elka Gilmore, the first chairman of the organization, "we just have to support 
each other." It looked as if the age of the woman chef had come. 
</P>
<P>
Now things don't look quite so rosy. Today, there are fewer women running 
kitchens in Los Angeles than there were three years ago. Lydia Shire left the 
Four Seasons -- and then left town. She was replaced by a man. The Woman's 
Culinary Alliance, according to Gilmore, has "disintegrated into a catering 
coffee klatch." Gilmore herself has opened -- and closed -- her own restaurant 
(Tumbleweed). And of the 30 or so big deal new restaurants slated to open in 
the next year, only one will be run by a women. What happened? 
</P>
<P>
Says Elka Gilmore, "In my case, I was just sort of naive. I don't know how I 
went from being content as a chef to owning a restaurant. At Tumbleweed, I 
didn't have time to cook at all. It was really tough; I had a hard time dealing 
with it. But now I know what it's like to have to sell your car to make 
payroll." 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Stalvey, former chef at Spago, says much the same thing. She left Spago to 
open her own restaurant, J. Paul's at the Beach. In the process she lost her 
money. "I'm not real businessy, I'm just real creative. I admit I've been a 
sucker. I didn't protect myself legally. I guess I'm not ready to run my own 
business." 
</P>
<P>
Even Gigi Patout, who was running the family business, Patout's in Westwood, 
has a similar story. "My brother Alex was Mr. P.R. He was so domineering. I was 
the one who moved, I was the one who set the restaurant up. But I was in the 
background." And says Patout, "when the family quarrelled with Alex, I was the 
one who left the restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
Says Michael Roberts, chef at Trumps (and a man who has hired so many women 
that his key kitchen people are all female), "Women chefs are at a disadvantage 
because they're working in a male world. They have to be just a little bit 
tougher than a man does. This is not always to their advantage. The problem is 
that it's so difficult for a woman to be given credibility in a kitchen -- to 
prove that she's strong enough, etc. -- that she then gets propelled into 
thinking that she wants to be the owner. And lots of people would be better off 
if they just stayed in the number two position. " 
</P>
<P>
A chef who graduates to executive chef changes his job radically. He becomes 
more of a manager than a cook. This is hard for many women to face. When Lydia 
Shire took her first executive position many years ago, she admits that she was 
not prepared. "I failed miserably at management. The cooks were making fun of 
me behind my back. I wasn't strong. I'd ask instead of tell, and there are 
times when you just can't do that. In a kitchen, everybody needs a leader." 
</P>
<P>
Shire ultimately became a leader. She worked her way up to executive chef at 
the Bostonian Hotel -- and was then lured away to Los Angeles. For the Four 
Seasons Hotel, hiring Shire created a lot of press. "I still think I was an 
experiment," Shire says now. "They were going into the L.A. market, and you 
have to be a little weird to be great in L.A. So somebody higher up said, 'Hire 
her.' I'm not sorry I went. I had 43 cooks on my staff and the second lowest 
turnover rate in the whole hotel chain. People were happy." 
</P>
<P>
But Shire was not. "We did a quarter of a million dollars worth of banquet 
business in the first month, and they only gave me one and a half banquet cooks 
to do it with. They were trying to force me to serve French banquets. We do it 
this way in all our hotels, they said, and you have to do it our way. I said 
I'm not going to." Shire ultimately left the hotel to open her own wildly 
successful restaurant, Biba, in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Evan Kleiman has become a leader, too. Like Shire, it took her a while. When 
she was the chef at Verdi in 1982, she had an assistant, a man, who fought her 
for control. Exhausted, she finally walked out and left him in charge of the 
kitchen. That couldn't happen today. Kleiman knows who is the boss. "It's hard 
to work for me," she admits. "I know what I want. I tend to have huge conflicts 
with people who want to come in and make up recipes." 
</P>
<P>
But being successful takes more than the ability to lead. It takes chutzpah. It 
takes stamina. It takes stubbornness. Asked what the secret of her success has 
been, Alice Waters, owner of Berkeley's famed Chez Panisse, replied, "I was 
more obsessed than anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
They all were -- all the successful ones. Lydia Shire says "I was always trying 
and pushing. It simply never would have occurred to me to ask for a Saturday 
night off. If you want to get ahead, you have to do what it takes." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Sue Milliken, co-owner of City Restaurant, the chef who graduated from 
chef's school only to be offered a job as a hatcheck girl, refused to take no 
for an answer. She called every week until she wore the owner down. He finally 
bowed to the inevitable and gave her a job peeling vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
But today, most chefs complain, nobody wants to take a job peeling vegetables. 
Says Milliken's partner at one of L.A.'s most successful restaurants, Susan 
Feniger, "We'll put an ad in the paper and not one person will apply for a 
job." Michael Roberts says, "People don't want to start at the bottom and work 
to the top. Today they go to cooking school for two years, graduate and say to 
me, 'My mother's going to stop the payments on my BMW. I need to earn $12 an 
hour -- and I won't work weekends." Says Shire, "It irks me when these young 
cooks come in and say they need Saturday off because that's the night their 
husband isn't working." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Silverton, who now owns Campanile with her husband, Mark Peel, and runs 
the La Brea Bakery, worked for free at her first job. This is not unusual; most 
of the women of the first generation did. But today, says Silverton, there 
don't seem to be people who are willing to do that. "If there had been a bakery 
around when I started out," says Silverton, "I would have worked on my day off, 
worked for free. I would have done anything. But I haven't had a single person 
who has come in and said, 'I want to learn to bake bread like you do.' Wouldn't 
you think there'd be one person in Los Angeles who would want to?" 
</P>
<P>
"I wish there had been a bakery when I started out," says Victoria Granof, 
executive chef at Atlas, due to open next month in the Wiltern Building. 
</P>
<P>
Granof started with no training at all. When she wanted to get some, a friend 
suggested she call Michael Roberts at Trumps. "That was 1983, when Trumps was a 
sort of culinary temple. Michael told me to come in and see him. When I got 
there he said, 'I don't have time to talk to you, but can you bake bread?' I'd 
never done it, but I said, 'Sure'. He told me I could start the next day. So I 
went home and baked all night, trying every recipe in the Joy of Cooking until 
I got one acceptable loaf." 
</P>
<P>
Granof proceeded to work so hard that after two months Roberts asked her to 
take over the pastries as well. She left Trumps to work at the fledgling City 
restaurant ("a friend called and told me that those girls really had their 
stuff together, so I went.") Ultimately she went off to take classes at the 
Cordon Bleu in England -- and then to work in a restaurant in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"While I was there Evan (Kleiman) called and asked me to come work for her. You 
know, I think I've been very lucky. I worked for people like Michael Roberts 
and Evan. It's made it easier. If I had been in a situation where I had to 
spend five years doing stages in a traditional French kitchen, I would have had 
some more of those horror stories to tell you. But it was easier for me." 
</P>
<P>
It will continue to get easier. Women may be failing as executive chefs -- but 
they are pouring into kitchens in record numbers. "There are a lot more woman 
cooks," says Kleiman. "Not just chefs. They are everywhere, at all levels. 
There has definitely been a change in the last three years. It's no longer 
extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
There are still chefs who refuse to let women in the kitchen. Chefs like the 
one with a restaurant on Melrose who recently told Elka Gilmore, "I know women 
are going to be more prominent in kitchens, but I personally won't be able to 
deal with it." But those kitchens are becoming rarer. The new California casual 
style of eating has produced a new California casual style of restaurant. Few 
local kitchens are organized along traditional French lines. Most chefs don't 
even bestow titles like "sous chef" and "saucier" anymore. In place of the 
old-line French chefs there are innovative younger men -- Michael Roberts, 
Wolfgang Puck, Joachim Splichal -- all of whom employ women as head chefs. 
</P>
<P>
And then, of course, there are the women who have made it. They are helping the 
ones who haven't. "The Woman's Culinary Alliance may now involve mostly 
caterers," says Kleiman, "but there is an informal support network among women 
chefs. Eighty percent of the applications I got to work here at Angeli Mare 
were from women." 
</P>
<P>
And she hired a lot of them. There are four women on the line at Angeli Mare. 
And if you walk into the kitchen at Trattoria Angeli, you may be surprised to 
hear a decidedly Cajun accent coming from behind the stove. "When I needed a 
job," says Gigi Patout, "I called Evan. She said, 'You want to work for me?' " 
The Cajun chef laughs, a deep rolling laugh and says, "I told her I didn't know 
anything about Italian food, but I was willing." She laughs again and adds, 
"It's been such a good challenge for me. The worst thing for me was being able 
to pronounce the words. You know, the closest thing to this we've got in 
Louisiana was Pizza Hut." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Feniger says lots of women come into City to apply for jobs, too. "I 
think it's because we're women who own it. I'm amazed how many women want to 
work with other women." 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe," says Kleiman, "women haven't gone to the top as fast as they might 
have. But it's going to come in the next generation. The woman working for me 
now are between 25 and 29, and a lot of them are real interested in having 
their own place, running the show. It's just a matter of time."

THE NEXT WAVE: THE FUTURE BELONGS TO THOSE ON THE LINE

At the moment Anne Sprecher is more concerned about the botched fish order than 
about the current state of women chefs. Thirty-nine whole New Zealand snappers 
were expected at Campanile this morning, but only nine showed up. She puts in 
an annoyed phone call to the supplier, but when it's clear that no more whole 
fish will be available, she reworks the night's specials with her boss, Mark 
Peel. ("We can do more lobster instead," she tells him. "We have more of them 
than we thought we did.") 
</P>
<P>
Later, Sprecher outlines her duties. "I think my title is 'In Charge of 
Whatever Mark Doesn't Want to Do,' " she says. "I do the scheduling and the 
organizing and I make sure prep's coming out right. It works out really well 
because I don't like doing meat, which is what Mark loves." She also hires and 
fires kitchen employees and decides who works where on the line -- the 
battalion of cooks who actually prepare the food. 
</P>
<P>
Though she's not the owner, Sprecher holds a powerful position -- it's a job 
that might not have been entrusted to a woman 10 or 15 years ago. Then, women 
chefs had a hard time getting promoted from pastry or the pantry station. Those 
who did were novelties, condescended to in the kitchen and promoted by 
restaurant publicists as unusual selling points ("We found kiwis add an 
interesting twist to leg of lamb and we have a woman in the kitchen!"). 
</P>
<P>
It's still not exactly easy, but these days, women work the line routinely, and 
are given real responsibilities. Sprecher feels that an assessment of women 
chefs as women chefs is almost irrelevant now -- a good sign. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so strange thinking back on that stuff," Sprecher says. "Here at 
Campanile almost the whole line is women. But then, only five years ago, I went 
to talk to Mauro (Vincente) at the Rex -- and he was really up front -- he 
said, 'I can't hire a woman because I've got all Italian chefs and they 
couldn't handle it.' " Now he's hiring women. It's changed. I don't think 
anybody looks twice if a woman comes in; even a lot of the French chefs have 
adjusted." 
</P>
<P>
Sprecher is a reluctant symbol of the struggle women have gone through to earn 
respect in the kitchen -- she's the woman who got soaked with water by pastry 
chef Claude Koeberle when Wolfgang Puck hired her to work at Ma Maison in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
When Koeberle saw that his stunt didn't faze her, they became good friends. "He 
saw I could take the pressure and decided to teach me a lot," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Sprecher, Pauliann Lister never had to learn things the hard way. "I 
heard a lot of the horror stories you hear about abusive chefs," she says, "but 
I won't work for anyone like that, period." Lister trained at the La Varenne 
cooking school in France and came to the recently opened Angeli Mare from the 
restaurant at Checkers Hotel downtown. "I think at this point there are enough 
good people out there that I don't have to subject myself to that kind of 
stuff. Of course, it hasn't been a major issue -- I've never been confronted 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
None of her female co-workers have, either. To the women in the kitchen at 
Angeli Mare (four women and one man, all in their 20s, work the line) the grim 
tales seem almost as dated as bra burnings and sit-ins that happened when they 
were kids. 
</P>
<P>
And working for Angeli Mare co-owner and chef Evan Kleiman, it's unlikely that 
they'll ever have firsthand knowledge. Kleiman runs her kitchen more as coach 
than despot. "Teamwork" is a concept that constantly pops up in these women's 
conversations. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to get us all in a position where we can work every station and 
alternate," says Ilana Sharlin. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really compatible," Lister says. "I hope this doesn't sound sexist, but 
I think that women are better able to share responsibility without drawing 
lines." 
</P>
<P>
(Lister is quick to add that the sole male on the team, Jamie Behar, is as much 
a part of the team as the other women.) 
</P>
<P>
But while these women are committed to their jobs, and especially to Kleiman -- 
whom they all treat as a mentor -- they don't seem as obsessed as their 
predecessors (as is common with members of the second generation of any 
movement). 
</P>
<P>
"I don't ever think I'll have my own restaurant," Lister says. "I'm already 
married." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not really one of my dreams," says lunch chef Margot Malikoff. "Cooking 
is a skill I do well, it pays the rent . . . and I like it, most of all." 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that this crew of women has a lot in common with their male 
contemporaries. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my first professional cooking job," Laura Guagliano says. "It may turn 
out that I don't get where I want to go quickly enough and then I'll have to 
try something new. I like being in a position of authority. I like being in 
charge." 
</P>
<P>
Trump's Elizabeth Miller is in charge; she's Michael Roberts chef du cuisine. 
But it took Miller more than 10 years to earn her position. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a guy come in here and say, 'Well, I don't want to go through the steps 
-- I want to be the best right now,' " Miller says. "But no one can be the best 
right away. You have to stick with it -- through years and years of training -- 
and really be a workaholic. 
</P>
<P>
Miller puts in 10 and 12 hour workdays -- "and when I have my own restaurant 
it'll be 14 and 16 hours, at least," she says. 
</P>
<P>
She expects to have her own place within three years, probably in Washington 
where there have been offers of financing. But at the moment Miller is someone 
who as she puts it, "does Michael Robert's food." 
</P>
<P>
"Michael's job," she says, "is to be out in the dining room, talking to the 
patrons and pushing his food, and my job is to make sure that everything comes 
out of his kitchen perfect. I'm his eyes. I make sure that I have everybody 
trained to do what he wants. I know his style of food, the way he presents 
things. Like I was telling this new pantry guy I hired who wanted to make 
everything look perfect, he hates symmetrical food. He likes it to look nice, 
but he's not a plate painter -- he wants a mish mash of delicious food." 
</P>
<P>
There's a real sense of excitement in Miller's voice when she talks food. She 
tells you about the Thai market she went to and the wonderful herbs and sauces 
she got there (and that they ended up in a few specials at Trumps that night). 
And she tells you that in her "spare" time she and her daytime sous chef, Nancy 
Wilkinson, make desserts for the restaurant, Indigo. Traci de Jardin was 
untrained when she first went to work for Joachim Splichal. "I didn't even know 
how to hold a knife," she says. That was when she was 17. Now she's about to 
turn 24 and is Splichal's chef du cuisine at Patina. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so incredible for a woman to have that position in a French kitchen," 
Campanile's Sprecher says. "I couldn't believe it when I heard." 
</P>
<P>
De Jardin has surprised a lot of people. She quickly worked through the ranks 
with Splichal at the Seventh Street Bistro and Max au Triangle. Then, because 
she wanted more of the kind of regime that would make her a serious chef, she 
went off to France. She got the training she wanted . . . and more grief than 
she'd bargained for.

"I was working among only men," she says, "and it was probably the hardest 
thing that I'll ever have to do in my life. Not only are the French very biased 
against women in the kitchen, they're very biased against Americans. And, big 
mistake, I didn't speak French when I went. But I learned . . . fast. Even 
still I had to put up with everything from practical jokes and sexual comments 
to absolute cruelty. There was no recognition for my skills or abilities 
whatsoever. I just washed lettuce and peeled shallots. It's a story Americans 
tell over and over." 
</P>
<P>
But she stayed for eight months, four and a half at Troisgros. From France she 
went to New York's Montrachet for a year and a half, where she worked every 
position in the kitchen until she was promoted to sous chef. 
</P>
<P>
Then she did something that few American chefs in her position would have ever 
done. She went back to France for more training. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very scary to go back," she says, "but I'd felt I'd come to a 
standstill as far as cooking, and I couldn't think of anyone else I wanted to 
work for. I mean, I'm pretty much into French food and I wanted more of it." 
</P>
<P>
She went to Paris' three-star Lucas-Carton in Paris and stayed for six months. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a lot better," she says. "I knew French the second time around, plus I 
was older and my confidence was up. I just gave them as much attitude as they 
gave me and basically said, 'I'm not going to put up with this. I know what my 
abilities are and none of you are better than I am.' " 
</P>
<P>
The experience taught her about cooking under pressure, a skill she needed when 
she and Splichal opened Patina this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been tough. If you step as a chef into a position where the routines are 
already established it's a lot easier. We had to make up everything new and 
develop all our own systems. But it's all fallen into place, and I've even been 
able to take a day off once in a while. Things are looking good."

<P>
When Branford Marsalis speaks his mind, the listener has the impression that he 
is doing so out of deep conviction, and not because he desires to flaunt his 
erudition. 
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old saxophonist who has enjoyed even more credits than his brother 
Wynton -- as saxophonist, composer, movie actor, touring soloist with pop 
groups and recording artist in both jazz and classical settings -- has no 
hesitation in letting a few chips, falling where they may, cause a touch of 
irritation. 
</P>
<P>
It has struck some observers as remarkable that the group he now heads consists 
entirely of former Wynton Marsalis sidemen, including himself. "I don't think 
Wynton resented it at first," he says, "because I never lured them away from 
him; his own music was going in a different direction. But now that he may be 
changing his style again, he's gonna be hard pressed to find musicians. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really a dream band for all of us. I went to school with the drummer, 
Jeff (Tain) Watts; the pianist, Kenny Kirkland, is an old friend and always 
wanted to work with me. Bob Hurst, the bass player, went with Wynton after 
Kenny and I had left, but he worked with Tony Williams just before joining us." 
</P>
<P>
To the casual observer or first-time interviewer, the attitudes of the two 
senior Marsalis brothers seem sharply contrasted; Wynton seems to verge on 
arrogance and to avoid any comment that might be construed as racially 
incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
Branford, on the other hand, when asked about the possibility of recording 
works by black classical composers, had no hesitation in replying: "There 
aren't that many for any instrument, let alone for the saxophone. William Grant 
Still, judging by what I've heard of his work, is not in the same class as 
Stravinsky or any of the great composers. I don't want to sound mean, but if he 
were white he wouldn't get any mention at all! There's a lot of instances where 
people have gotten credit because they were black. 
</P>
<P>
"Being black can work to your advantage; if you have somebody that violently 
disagrees with you, whether it's in music or the political arena, all you have 
to do is holler 'racism!' and they'll back off." 
</P>
<P>
When it was suggested to him that this attitude seemed antithetical to 
Wynton's, he replied: "You think so? He would never make a remark like that, 
but he thinks it. I'm sure he knows there's such a tremendous amount of 
anti-black racism in this country that he doesn't want to given anyone a chance 
to say 'You see? Racism works both ways.' 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to explain the differences between me and Wynton. I agree with the 
majority of things he says, but our deliveries are different. The best part of 
his message is the musical part. 
</P>
<P>
"Music means a lot more than just music to him, I think, whereas music to me 
means music. I'm not trying to prove anything to anyone with my music -- at 
least, not politically or socially; only musically. I do have social 
observations that differ from Wynton's. Mine are more comfortable for people, 
while he, I believe, enjoys making them squirm." 
</P>
<P>
Branford would just as soon make people laugh. He has impressed millions with 
his screen presence, first in "Bring On the Night," which some feel he stole 
from Sting, then in "Throw Mama From the Train" and most recently in Spike 
Lee's "School Daze." 
</P>
<P>
He was offered a lead acting role in Lee's current production, "A Love 
Supreme," but turned it down because it would have meant putting his band on 
hold while he spent time in the studios. "I wrote three tunes for the sound 
track and my band played on it; that seemed more important to me than the 
acting. It's going to be a real hard-core jazz movie too -- unlike 'Bird,' 
which I thought was awful. I didn't like the technique they used to drown out 
the other musicians and dub in new ones who backed up Bird. They threw in a lot 
of crowd noise so that it sounded more like a rock concert than a jazz club." 
</P>
<P>
Miles Davis, whose absence from "Bird" was the subject of much speculation, has 
given Branford Marsalis food for considerable thought. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Miles has done as much damage to jazz music as he has done good. He 
reminds me of stories I used to hear about (the late trumpeter) Lee Morgan, 
where there was some fear of being considered a nice person, so you try to show 
how tough you are and you curse at everyone and turn your back to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"Miles would rather be considered famous than important. The only reason he 
switched to pop music was that he thought people had stopped going to see jazz. 
When the Village Vanguard was no longer the in place to play, he didn't want to 
work there any more. 
</P>
<P>
"His last record, 'Amandla,' is fantastic, but you know why? Because of Marcus 
Miller, who is one of the baddest pop writers and producers out there. It's 
ironic to see Miles reduced to being, in effect, a sideman on his own record; 
in the old days he put his own personal stamp on every album." 
</P>
<P>
Marsalis has no objection to Davis' change of musical orientation. "I'm not 
saying he should still be playing jazz. Not at all. Especially after he's 
played with every great musician known to mankind. Once Herbie Hancock and 
Wayne Shorter and Tony Williams and Ron Carter left him, who was he gonna play 
with -- us? That's a joke to me, man. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just not right for Miles to take so much undue credit and put so many 
people down. I heard one interview where he said Freddie Hubbard can't play the 
trumpet. Before I was asked to join his band, I was just "a great musician," 
but when I didn't join him, in the next interview he said I can't play social 
music. Well, I grew up with social music, as he calls it; it's a product of the 
generation I represent. There's a difference between not being able to play it 
and choosing not to. All these guys of his age would talk about funk -- I 
resent that, because funk also is a product of my generation, not theirs." 
</P>
<P>
Another source of resentment: The New York critics who, as Marsalis puts it, 
"believe that Miles invented air. They seem to feel that he was the guiding 
force behind Herbie and Wayne and the rest, although the only smart thing Miles 
did was hire them in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"Years from now, how would it sound if I went around saying I taught Jeff Watts 
how to play the drums, or Kenny Kirkland how to play the piano? People might be 
dumb enough to believe it, but that's not fair to the musicians you hired -- 
and it's not fair to history." 
</P>
<P>
The many and varied achievements of Branford Marsalis over the past year have 
provided a fair indication of what history holds in store for him. Last winter 
he was the national spokesman, and one of the judges, for the National Assn. of 
Jazz Educators college band competition. In May, taking part in a Carnegie Hall 
concert with Sonny Rollins, he earned an extraordinary endorsement from the 
tenor sax veteran, who said: "I've played in competitive situations with some 
of the giants, and Branford may be the next giant." Soon after, Rollins invited 
Marsalis to play on his record session. 
</P>
<P>
Another staunch admirer is Dave Grusin, on whose latest release, "Migration," 
Marsalis plays three cuts. Perhaps coincidentally, the bassist on all three, 
and the composer on one, is the above-mentioned Marcus Miller. This is a GRP 
release, but Branford remains under contract to CBS for his own albums. 
</P>
<P>
Given the wide range of his activities and the growing respect in which he is 
held, it would seem likely that not only will Branford Marsalis be fair to 
history, but history will be eminently fair to him.

THE MARSALIS BROTHERS CREATE SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MUSIC OF THE DECADE; 
THERE ARE OTHER MUSICAL BROTHERS NOT YET HEARD FROM

<P>
It is becoming increasingly clear that the 1980s will go down in jazz history 
as the Marsalis decade. 
</P>
<P>
Wynton Marsalis rose first to fame, followed rapidly by his brother Branford. 
Their father, Ellis, was a long-respected teacher and pianist in New Orleans. 
Now it appears that another brother is about to make a swift rise to 
acceptance. He is the trombonist Delfeayo Marsalis, who graduated recently from 
the Berklee College of Music in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Not long after, he found himself in fast company, working on a jazz cruise with 
a band headed by the veteran cornetist Nat Adderley. Playing with world class 
musicians, he earned an uproarious ovation at every show, displaying a style 
marked by technical expertise, swirling melodic lines and frequent touches of 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the fourth oldest," he said during a rest between sets. "Branford is 29, 
Wynton's 28, Ellis III is 25. Ellis was married in September, and for the first 
time in many years the entire family got together. 
</P>
<P>
"I was born July 28, 1965. My younger brothers are Mboya, who's 19, and Jason, 
who's 12 and plays drums. At first I wanted to play electric bass, but it hurt 
my fingers, so while I was in the sixth grade I figured I'd be like big brother 
and pick up a horn." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, his father did not encourage Delfeayo. "He saw that I wasn't too 
interested in practicing, and he knew the level of proficiency that Branford 
and Wynton had attained, so he tried to persuade me to be a writer." 
</P>
<P>
Unfazed, the youth went on to Tanglewood, playing classical music, but his 
technical ability was not matched by a talent for improvising, until he went to 
Berklee. 
</P>
<P>
"I studied with Phil Wilson and all the other trombone teachers there, but my 
ideas about jazz playing really came from the records of J. J. Johnson." 
</P>
<P>
Armed with the albums of that bebop pioneer, Delfeayo Marsalis honed his 
skills, though for the first three of his six years at Berklee he was mainly 
involved with learning record production. "While I was in the fifth grade, 
Branford showed me how you could create a tape loop, and from that point on I 
was fascinated with tape recorders. I was 17 when I produced my first album, 
'Syndrome,' a piano session my Dad made." 
</P>
<P>
Though he also put together and played with a band composed primarily of fellow 
Berklee students, Delfeayo remained unknown as a trombonist while racking up an 
imposing series of producer credits. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done four albums for Branford: I produced Harry Connick Jr.'s first album 
when he was 19; I made 'Crystal Stair' for Donald Harrison and Terence 
Blanchard and 'The Truth Is Spoken Here,' (pianist) Marcus Roberts' debut 
album." 
</P>
<P>
These were all New Orleans musicians, but there have been other credits: He 
assisted on a session for the Polish pianist Adam Makowicz and has produced two 
albums for the British saxophonist Courtney Pine. ("My Dad played on the new 
one -- it's due out soon.") 
</P>
<P>
"I did the acoustic sound track for Spike Lee's 'Do the Right Thing,' and 
lately we've been working together on his new movie, 'A Love Supreme.' It's a 
story about a jazz trumpet player; he's portrayed on the screen by Denzel 
Washington, with Terence Blanchard dubbing the trumpet parts and Branford's 
band featured as well." 
</P>
<P>
Last January Delfeayo's Berklee group competed in the national college band 
contest held by the National Assn. of Jazz Educators in San Diego. The band won 
first prize, and those of us who heard the young trombonist were convinced that 
his career could never be limited to producing. 
</P>
<P>
He agrees. "I want to do more playing. I haven't worked in my brothers' groups. 
I did road-manage Branford on a couple of his gigs, but I'm not interested in 
that type of work; I really want to play. 
</P>
<P>
"They are much more advanced, and being my older brothers they have a different 
perspective on life. But I'm fortunate to have had an opportunity to see their 
mistakes, observe what they were doing correctly, and use that as a guide in 
making my own decisions." 
</P>
<P>
His career may not be confined to playing and producing. As his liner notes for 
the recent Branford Marsalis album "Trio Jeepy" revealed, he is a literate and 
knowledgeable writer who may yet justify his father's original ambition to see 
him take up journalism and criticism. He has written a number of unpublished 
poems and short stories. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy writing. I want to get some columns into the papers, and I hope 
eventually to document enough material for a couple of books. It seems to me 
important to get someone from this generation -- musicians of our age group -- 
to provide written information on how they think and feel about the music." 
</P>
<P>
Yet another direction in which he will aim is composition. "Whenever I tour 
with my own band, I do some sporadic composing and arranging. I've been working 
on a new concept in which the trombone is playing the melody underneath the 
harmony, instead of writing the melody on top of the harmony as everybody 
usually does." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly there is no limit to the potential successes of this brilliant youth. 
As knowledgeable as brother Wynton, friendly and outgoing like Branford, tall 
(almost 6 feet) and good looking, with a rare improvisational talent on an 
instrument that has been too long on the sidelines in jazz, he seems ready to 
take on the world. It is safe to predict that within a year or two, the name 
Delfeayo Marsalis will be as well known and respected as that of his two older 
brothers.

1 SEIZED AT CAMPUS FLAG BURNING RALLY

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An American flag was torched on the steps of Sproul Hall on the UC Berkeley 
campus Friday as a crowd of about 500 people chanted, "Burn, baby, burn." 
Police arrested one person, but not under the federal law against flag burning 
that went into effect Oct. 27 and prompted the protest. Suzanne Lester, 20, a 
student at the university, was cited for obstructing a police officer. Police 
said because of the size of the crowd, they could not determine which 
individuals actually took part in the burning.

52 ABORTION FOES ARRESTED AT CLINIC

San Bernardino police arrested 52 people at a rally called by the anti-abortion 
group Operation Rescue on Saturday for trying to block the entrance of a family 
planning clinic, police said. Police were called to the early morning 
demonstration by employees of the Family Planning Associates clinic when many 
of the more than 150 demonstrators began blocking the doors, trying to prevent 
scheduled abortions from being performed, police said. During the three-hour 
protest, many of those arrested offered passive resistance and were carried 
away from the clinic to waiting police vans, which took them to a nearby 
detention center. They were cited for trespassing and interfering with police 
officers and released, police said.

A Central California man wanted by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
in connection with the strangulation of a 57-year-old West Hollywood resident 
surrendered early Saturday morning after talking to a pastor at the Crystal 
Cathedral in Garden Grove. Mark Murray, 23, of San Luis Obispo was arrested in 
the Tower of Hope, a building in the church complex by Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies shortly after 4 a.m. Murray had been sought by investigators 
after Richard Roberts was found strangled in his Sweetzer Avenue apartment on 
Oct. 31, Sheriff's Deputy Patrick Hunter said. Pastor Sandy Freud of the 
Crystal Cathedral said he had advised Murray on Friday to surrender. He later 
made arrangements for him to be turned over to deputies at the church.

Police are asking the public for help in their investigation of the slaying of 
a prominent lawyer who spent much of his time protecting the rights of criminal 
defendants. Investigators are searching for a motive for the attack on Eric 
Henrikson, 41, who was bludgeoned to death outside his law office Monday. 
Officers are looking into the possibility that the slaying was linked to a case 
Henrikson handled or stemmed from an aborted robbery.

QUESTION: You seem to routinely advise against paying off a home mortgage 
early. But I feel you are referring to fairly new loans. I would appreciate 
your thoughts about older home loans where the balance is small in comparison 
to the greatly appreciated-inflated house value. 
</P>
<P>
In our case, our 30-year, 5.5% interest rate, $26,800-mortgage with a monthly 
$152.17 principal and interest payment is now over 24 years old. The remaining 
debt is under $9,000 and the house is worth about $200,000. It cost us $33,500 
new in 1965. That $9,000 balance is about two-month's worth of our current 
income. As I am now in my mid-60s and retired, I am tempted to pay off the 
mortgage. Is this a good idea? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Since your $9,000 loan balance is very small and you have adequate 
income, you would probably feel much better paying off the mortgage. However, 
when you do so, you will really be investing $9,000 at 5.5% interest. That's 
not a very good investment just to save around $495 interest annually. 
</P>
<P>
If the amount of your low interest rate mortgage were larger, I would strongly 
advise against paying it off. But I presume you have adequate cash and credit 
line reserves so you won't miss the $9,000. 
</P>
<P>
You are correct that I do not advise making big lump sum mortgage pay downs. 
Perhaps you recall the homeowner who inherited $65,000, paid down his home loan 
but didn't get any reduction in monthly mortgage payments, later needed some 
money, and couldn't borrow except at loan shark rates. 
</P>
<P>
A better alternative for borrowers who want to save home mortgage interest is 
to make an extra principal payment each month to pay off their loan in 15 years 
instead of 30 years. Usually, only $50 to $100 extra is required each month; 
the lender can provide the exact amount needed. The result is saving thousands 
of interest dollars by cutting 15 years off their mortgage's life. 
</P>
<P>
Low Interest Rate No Bargain If Deal Bad 
</P>
<P>
Q: There is a condo complex in a nearby town which is advertising 8.5% 
fixed-interest rate mortgages. I am considering buying a two-bedroom condo 
there. The building was constructed about three years ago and the construction 
lender foreclosed. The lender added many extras to make the complex attractive. 
</P>
<P>
There really isn't any nearby condo complex which is competitive so I'm having 
a difficult time comparing it with alternative condos. The local realty agents 
all knock the project. But when I talked to the saleswoman at the condo she 
said her company isn't cooperating with the local agents so they criticize the 
project. The low interest rate is attractive but do you think I might be paying 
too much for the condo if I buy? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. The lender-owner is in a unique position to adjust the interest rate 
and the prices of the condos. I suggest you listen closely to the local real 
estate agents in the vicinity to learn all you can about the condo complex. 
</P>
<P>
If it has been there several years, you can be sure the realty agents know its 
good and bad points. The lender-owner is obviously not very smart, because 
failure to cooperate with local realty agents is a serious sales marketing 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
I can't advise you to buy or not but it sounds like you should be very careful. 
If you decide to buy, be sure not to close your purchase until at least 75% of 
the condo units are sold and ready to close. The reason is, you don't want to 
be one of the few individual owners if the project turns out badly and the 
lender continues to own a majority of the condos.

YOUR MORTGAGE; 
</P>
<P>
FHA BEGINS REVERSE MORTGAGE PILOT PROGRAM; 
</P>
<P>
EQUITY: ELDERLY HOMEOWNERS CAN USE FEDERALLY INSURED LOANS TO PROVIDE MONTHLY 
INCOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Five western lenders will soon offer the first federally backed 
reverse-mortgages, those hard-to-find loans designed to aid equity-rich but 
cash-poor older homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
Only two of the lending institutions -- Encino-based Beverly Hills Securities 
Co. and Riverside-based Directors Mortgage Loan Corp. -- are making the 
federally insured loans in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The other three institutions chosen by the Federal Housing Administration to 
take part in its new pilot program are California Bank of Lodi, Philadelphia 
Freedom in Las Vegas and First California in San Rafael, said Yville Edwards at 
the FHA's regional headquarters in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Reverse mortgages are home loans that work backward. Instead of a lender making 
a loan to a buyer who will repay the money in monthly installments, the lender 
typically sends a check to an existing homeowner in monthly increments. 
</P>
<P>
The owner usually doesn't have to pay the money back until the term of the loan 
expires or the borrower sells the home and moves. If the homeowner dies, the 
loan is repaid by the estate. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are several lenders that offer reverse mortgages in California 
and other states, the loans they make are not insured by the FHA and, some 
experts say, they don't have such attractive terms and flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
Many prospective borrowers apparently agree. The FHA is allowing each of the 
institutions that are taking part in the pilot program to make 50 of the loans, 
yet some of the lenders have been deluged with requests from hundreds of 
prospective borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got more than 400 people on our waiting list, and we haven't done a bit 
of advertising," said Verlee Gale of Beverly Hills Securities. 
</P>
<P>
"We could probably make a lot more of the loans, but we just don't have the 
government's authorization." 
</P>
<P>
That could change. Although legislation that established the new reverse 
mortgage program requires the FHA to insure only 2,500 of the loans nationwide, 
Jack Kemp, secretary of housing and urban development, recently said he 
supports quadrupling the size of the project. 
</P>
<P>
More important, some experts say the government's involvement could encourage 
more private-sector lenders to begin offering reverse mortgages -- and more 
competition would likely mean lower borrowing costs for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly how much you can borrow under the FHA program or through 
reverse-mortgage programs run by private-sector firms depends on a number of 
factors, including your age, amount of equity and the type of reverse mortgage 
you select. 
</P>
<P>
Like many other reverse-mortgage programs, the FHA program lets buyers choose 
from three types of mortgages: 
</P>
<P>
A "tenure" mortgage, which allows a borrower to receive pre-set monthly 
stipends for as long as he lives in the home. The money doesn't have to be paid 
back until the borrower moves or dies, which makes this type of loan 
particularly attractive to someone who plans to stay in the house for the rest 
of his life. 
</P>
<P>
A "term" loan, which gives the borrower monthly stipends for a specified period 
-- say, five or 10 years. Although the loan will have to be repaid on a 
specified date, it often attracts borrowers who need some monthly cash until a 
pension or annuity kicks in, or people who plan to eventually sell their house 
and move to a retirement home. 
</P>
<P>
A "line of credit" that lets homeowners borrow money as it is needed and 
doesn't have to be repaid until the borrower moves out or dies. It's the most 
flexible of the three loans, but borrowers need discipline to avoid using the 
money all at once. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most other reverse-mortgage programs, the FHA program also allows 
lump-sum draw-downs on the loans. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you had a term loan calling for monthly stipends of $300 but 
suddenly needed $5,000 to repair your roof or pay medical expenses, you could 
alter your loan arrangement and get the $5,000 you need immediately. 
</P>
<P>
The FHA is insuring both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans. Importantly, it 
also lets you and your lender work out a lower rate on the loan if you agree to 
give part of the home's future appreciation to the lender. 
</P>
<P>
For example, you might be charged a 20% interest rate if you declined to share 
a portion of your future profits with the lender, or a lower rate if you agreed 
to give the institution some or all of your future appreciation. Either way, 
the equity you built up before the reverse mortgage was made is yours to keep. 
</P>
<P>
You must be at least 62 years old to be eligible for the new FHA program. If 
you're married, both you and your spouse must be at least 62. 
</P>
<P>
You must also own your own home free and clear, or have it nearly paid off. 
Owners of condominiums and townhouses are eligible, as well as people who own 
single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
Like most other lenders that make reverse mortgages, institutions that take 
part in the FHA program will require prospective borrowers to first contact a 
third-party counseling firm staffed by professionals who discuss each 
individual's financial situation and borrowing options. 
</P>
<P>
For example, older homeowners who need a large amount of cash but can afford to 
repay the loan in monthly installments are usually better off taking out a 
simple home-equity loan, experts say. Doing so will usually save them thousands 
of dollars in interest charges, and they probably won't have to sell the 
property in order to pay off the loan. 
</P>
<P>
A sale-leaseback is another option. An older couple can sell their home to 
their child or a private investor and simultaneously sign a lease to remain in 
the house for as long as they want. 
</P>
<P>
The couple gets to keep the sale proceeds and may be eligible for the one-time 
exclusion that lets them pocket up to $125,000 of their profit tax-free. The 
child or investor gets to collect monthly rent payments, take tax deductions 
like other landlords, and eventually has the option of occupying the house when 
the parents move away or die. 
</P>
<P>
Since reverse mortgages, home-equity loans and sale-leasebacks entail some 
complex tax and legal questions, you'll want to consult with an accountant, 
attorney or other qualified professional if you're thinking about tapping your 
equity. 
</P>
<P>
You'll also want to read up on your borrowing options. One of the best sources 
of information is a free, 44-page booklet published by the American Assn. of 
Retired Persons. 
</P>
<P>
The booklet discusses reverse mortgages and other ways that older people can 
use the equity in their home. It also includes a list of reverse-mortgage 
lenders in California and other states.

COMPANIES OFFERING REVERSE MORTGAGES

Here is a partial list of loan companies that offer reverse mortgages in 
California. Although the first two offer only FHA-insured reverse mortgages and 
have stopped accepting loan applications, they may eventually get government 
authorization to offer more of the loans. The other two companies on the list 
are still making reverse mortgages, but they aren't insured by the government.

QUICK FIXES RENEW A WORN-OUT FAMILY ROOM; 
</P>
<P>
REPAIRS: SOME HINTS ON HOW TO MODERNIZE THE FAMILY ROOM, WHICH NO LONGER IS 
MERELY A STORAGE AREA FOR CAST-OFF FURNITURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Better Homes and Gardens 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today's family rooms are more than a catch-all for cast-off living room 
furniture. These contemporary family gathering spaces offer comfort and 
relaxation with style. Much is demanded of a family room today. 
</P>
<P>
It may accommodate sophisticated television, video and stereo systems, provide 
room for family play, quiet reading, evening work and entertaining, sport a 
bright and airy look and give quick access to the kitchen and deck. 
</P>
<P>
But not all family rooms measure up to their owners' needs. Some, with shag 
carpeting in worn traffic patterns along with worn furniture, dark paneled 
walls, lighting that brightens only the center of room, games and books 
cluttered here, there and everywhere, a TV hogging a corner, many family rooms 
leave their owners wanting. 
</P>
<P>
Remodeling is an option but not the only one. Here are some quick fixes that 
will give your family room new life without emptying your wallet: 
</P>
<P>
Paint: The quickest and best sprucer-upper is paint, even for dark wood 
paneling. "Painted wood is one of the hottest looks going," says Denise 
Caringer, Executive Furnishings and Design Editor for Better Homes and Gardens 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Fabrics: Add new, bright colors with throw pillows for a minimum of expense. 
Reupholster a tired piece of furniture or re-cover with slipcovers. "Often the 
family room has been the catch-all for furniture that has outlived other rooms. 
If you can't afford new furniture, the next best thing is to use stylish but 
hard-wearing fabrics to make it seem like new. Today's fabrics are wonderful," 
Caringer says. 
</P>
<P>
Carpet: Try an area rug over that tired carpet. "Pick a pattern or color that 
complements the old, but draws attention to the new area," Caringer recommends. 
"Then reshuffle the furniture for a really quick fix. People generally arrange 
furniture in ballroom style -- against the walls with the middle of the floor 
open. Put down an area rug and arrange a furniture grouping in the center of 
the room. Remember to use a focal point, such as a fireplace or television 
center." 
</P>
<P>
Impact: Rather than lots of small-scale furnishings and accessories, update 
your look with a few bold elements. Hang an oversized poster rather than a 
grouping of small art pieces. Top a coffee table with a huge bowl instead of 
tiny knickknacks. Bring in a fat new sofa or lounge chair. 
</P>
<P>
Doors and windows: Replace sliding glass doors with French doors for an airy, 
more sophisticated look. Brighten the room with lighter window treatments such 
as vertical blinds that can block out the sun and provide some insulation. Or 
stash the heavy draperies in favor of a bright fabric swag for a soft but open 
look. 
</P>
<P>
Lighting: Come out of the dark with better task lighting. "Clever lighting 
schemes don't have to be expensive," Caringer says. Install recessed lighting 
or track lights. Direct clip-on lights toward artwork and place up-lights in 
plants. Task lighting will brighten the dark corners and make the room more 
cheerful for minimum expense. Plus, light makes a room seem larger," Caringer 
says . 
</P>
<P>
Clutter: Make up your mind to part with some clutter, often the most difficult 
but most important decision in sprucing up a room. "That doesn't mean tossing 
Dad's favorite chair, but it does mean a simple paring down. Decide what you 
like and then have a garage sale or store the other pieces for awhile to see 
how you like living with less," Caringer says. 
</P>
<P>
Personality: No matter what, surround yourself with objects that mean something 
to you. Personal style, thank heavens, is in. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever changes you make, use comfort as your guide, for today's family room 
is the center for family leisure and time together.

FAMILY ROOM, KITCHEN RATE HIGH IN CONSUMER SURVEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A total of 45% of home buyers said they want kitchens and family rooms that are 
open to each other, but with a divider, such as a counter, according to a 
January, 1989, consumer preference survey conducted by the National Assn. of 
Home Builders and Better Homes and Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Seven out of 10 home buyers said that even with a den, a family room or great 
room is a must, and 64% said the basic price of a house must include a family 
room. 
</P>
<P>
The survey concluded that an open kitchen-family room will make a home sell 
better. 
</P>
<P>
In another survey, Better Homes and Gardens Consumer Panel respondents said 
that if they were building their own home, the most important room would be the 
kitchen, followed by the family room. 
</P>
<P>
It's not just the newer houses that are featuring family rooms. Many home 
improvements in the $102-billion industry focus on remodeling or adding a 
family room. The Better Homes and Gardens Home Improvement Contest showed that 
9,160 homeowners who entered the 1988 contest spent $172.2 million on 
remodeling projects, a 28% increase over the amount spent by those who entered 
the 1986 contest. 
</P>
<P>
The entries showed that family togetherness often prompted remodelings. Parents 
who wanted to spend more time with their youngsters inspired open 
kitchen/family room arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Family rooms were one of the most common additions. Desired features in this 
room included vaulted or cathedral ceiling with ceiling fan, skylights, 
fireplace, hardwood floors and lots of glazing, often with elaborate 
circle-topped windows. Bookcases and built-in cabinetry for sophisticated 
stereo and television video systems were also popular.

FINDING A NEW U.S. FOREIGN POLICY TO FIT A NEW WORLD OF OPPORTUNITY

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The abortive coup in Panama has unleashed a debate about the adequacy of the 
Bush Administration's decision-making process. Yet controversy about procedures 
misses the central point. In a crisis, there is usually so little time that 
officials react as athletes do, almost by rote -- on the basis of attitudes 
that have become second nature. The key question concerning Panama is, 
therefore, not how the United States managed one incident, but how it could 
have slid, during two administrations, into a confrontation with a weak, 
dependent country, staking American prestige without achieving stated 
objectives. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis could have been a blessing in disguise. Contrary to popular 
perception, the top reaches of government grow quiet during crises. Competition 
for pre-eminent status stops; more often, the competition is over who can avoid 
blame. A crisis has the hidden benefit of separating those willing to assume 
responsibility from those who maneuver for personal and career survival. These 
are lessons an Administration must learn -- the sooner the better. 
</P>
<P>
The fundamental imperative for a new Administration is an inquiry on how the 
United States chooses basic objectives. This is particularly important when the 
world teeters uneasily between the conventional wisdom of the past and the 
revolutionary reality of the present. Not since the end of World War II has the 
international situation been so fluid. 
</P>
<P>
And not since the Marshall Plan or the formation of NATO has an American 
President had so great an opportunity to build a new international order. But 
equally, not since the end of American isolationism have the obstacles in the 
United States been so daunting. 
</P>
<P>
No government of a major country reinvents its foreign policy with such 
regularity or so systematically as the American. Every eight years at most, the 
top personnel down to the level of deputy assistant secretary are removed even 
when -- as happened this time -- no change of party is involved. A large 
percentage of the next lower levels are simultaneously transferred from 
policy-making positions, sacrificing expertise and policy depth at a moment 
when political appointees are still without operational experience. Their 
seminal experience is often the recent political campaign, with its inevitable 
emphasis on short-term considerations geared to the rhythm of the TV evening 
news. Hence, high officials drawn from the political world tend to be more 
concerned with avoiding criticism than with imparting a sense of direction and 
tend to confuse verbal formulations or public-relations exercises with 
long-range policy. For in a political campaign, pronouncement is substance; the 
focus has to be on what to say rather than on what to do. 
</P>
<P>
For all these reasons, senior officials entering policy-making from the field 
of politics spend a disproportionate amount of effort seeking to dissociate 
themselves from their predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
Then a key test of any new administration is its ability to generate objectives 
that go beyond liquidating the policies of predecessors. That point seems to me 
to have been reached in the Bush Administration. At least for now, it has 
postponed -- in my view indefinitely -- controversy over the deployment of 
short-range nuclear weapons in Europe; it is cutting back the Strategic Defense 
Initiative in effect to a research program. But it has yet to put forward its 
concept of the new Europe, of Atlantic relations under conditions of 
perestroika, of the evolving role of China and Japan or of Latin America. In 
the nature of things, a long-range policy will take time to evolve; it would be 
both premature and unfair to criticize this Administration for failing to 
achieve it in a few months. But it is not too early to point out that in the 
end an administration will be judged by what it creates, not by what it 
liquidates. 
</P>
<P>
In organizing to deal with the future, the Bush Administration has many assets, 
notably that the President and several key advisers have a wealth of seasoned 
foreign-policy experience. They are also, by nature, prudent. Tactical 
recklessness will not be the undoing of this Administration. But concentration 
on tactics and short-term politics could be. Ironically the fact that the top 
people have known one another for so long and obviously get along so well may 
prove too much of a good thing. They may be reluctant to challenge one another 
or even embark on projects likely to produce controversy. When harmony becomes 
its own end, really difficult choices tend to be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
That tendency toward stagnation disguised as consensus is reinforced within 
each department, in the interdepartmental machinery and by evolving 
presidential-congressional relations. 
</P>
<P>
In taking over, every administration faces institutional deadlock: Its 
instincts are for change almost for its own sake while the bureaucracy is 
committed to a status quo it helped achieve. But since the new men rarely know 
their goals beyond campaign rhetoric and the bureaucracy controls the paper 
flow, solving day-to-day problems may consume so much energy that little time 
is left for long-range policy. The State Department bureaucracy, convinced that 
few political appointees could pass the Foreign Service examination, tends to 
persist in its view without formally articulating it to higher levels of 
government. The Foreign Service has a wondrous ability to write memoranda that 
fudge options it does not approve without technically suppressing them, or to 
draft instructions for itself which, once signed by the unwary political 
appointee, can be interpreted in a surprisingly sweeping manner. 
</P>
<P>
Such guerrilla tactics come to the fore when the Foreign Service believes its 
views are being systematically ignored -- more or less the case today. A 
certain tension between the political leadership and the professional staff is 
both inevitable and desirable. But foreign policy cannot thrive without support 
from what is now one of the world's best diplomatic services; when disciplined 
and monitored, it can be marvelously effective. 
</P>
<P>
The flow of cables in and out of State is so voluminous, the issues so complex 
that it can only be managed by teamwork between professionals and political 
appointees. Though it is still early in this Administration, this teamwork has 
in my view not yet been achieved. 
</P>
<P>
More difficult is the task of aligning the interdepartmental process to the 
genesis of long-range goals. The most overwhelming experience of high-level 
government service is that there are always more problems than time. Then the 
urgent tends to drive out the important -- especially, if paradoxically, in an 
Administration of extremely compatible individuals where there is great 
reluctance to play devil's advocate. 
</P>
<P>
Countless treatises have been written about the relative role of the national 
security adviser and the principal Cabinet officers. There is no formally 
conclusive answer because so much depends on the personality of the President. 
Since he has the final power of decision, the way issues are presented to him 
must be compatible with his style of work. But as a general proposition, 
Cabinet members are under duress to deal with day-to-day issues. They cannot 
avoid taking into account the morale of their subordinates, which is inevitably 
linked to short-term issues rather than the uncertainties inherent in 
long-range strategic planning. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, the national security adviser should act as the conscience of the 
Administration. He and the secretary of state should not be so afraid of 
reigniting bureaucratic struggles that they seek to solve all problems by a 
nonaggression treaty between themselves. The national security adviser and 
staff should feel free to raise forbidden subjects and to insist -- within 
limits tolerated by the President -- on the consideration of controversial 
issues. The incumbent, Brent Scowcroft, is almost ideally suited for this, 
though I should mention that he is an admired friend and former business 
associate. 
</P>
<P>
The tendency toward the short-term and the ad hoc is reinforced by the growing 
role of Congress; its staffs have multiplied as its claims have been extended 
from oversight of policy into control of day-to-day tactics. Unfortunately, the 
process of foreign-policy decision-making rarely lends itself to the trade-offs 
that characterize domestic legislation. Effective statecraft demands patience, 
nuance and confidentiality -- characteristics so often the opposite of robust 
congressional politics. The Bush Administration has shown extraordinary 
deference to congressional views. It remains to be seen whether this encourages 
pressures or eases them. In the end, the public and Congress will require a 
road map of proposed long-range destinations. Only in this manner does it 
become possible to generate the sort of dialogue capable of bringing about 
national consensus. 
</P>
<P>
We thus return to our original problem: whether this nation can, in a period of 
revolutionary change, develop objectives capable of shaping history. And this 
depends even more on the cast of mind of top policy-makers -- executive and 
legislative -- than on the administrative machinery at their disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Thus there is reason to be concerned over the disparity between the description 
of our time as revolutionary and the measures put forward to deal with it. 
Those are still quite conventional. For months there has been a debate in the 
United States about whether or not to affirm perestroika -- an update of the 
Cold War question: Can the Soviets be trusted and to what extent? But now that 
perestroika has been endorsed, what are the precise operational consequences? 
Neither Moscow nor the West has put forward any recognizable definition. As a 
result, neither Congress nor the public -- or U.S. allies -- have any criteria 
for determining what is being endorsed; the crucial challenge for the West is 
to develop a common concept and strategy for the new era now being proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
There are celebrations of new democracy in the world but little discussion on 
the specific actions required to sustain or defend it, especially in Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Defense is being reduced, but in the name of what doctrine, by what strategy? 
</P>
<P>
Conventional wisdom holds that the two-power world is disintegrating but the 
United States remains focused on a version of arms control that is a vestige of 
that world; so far no concept has been put forward to take advantage of the 
most significant opportunity perestroika seems to open up: the political 
organization of a new Europe, East and West, and the consequent redistribution 
of responsibility within the Atlantic Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
The comforting assumption seems to be that evolution -- in the Soviet Union and 
in the world -- will proceed smoothly toward some form of undefined global 
harmony symbolized by an occasional high-level meeting. This suits American 
optimism, though not the lessons of history; they teach that revolutions tend 
to proceed unevenly with periodic convulsions until a new structure has 
emerged. How to shape such a process and what we understand by harmony define 
the opportunity for peace. It is too early to ask for an agenda that will cause 
this Administration to meet its seminal opportunities. But the process should 
begin now with the recognition that the answers can be no better than the 
questions that are put.

WE'LL ALL SOON KNOW WHAT BUSH IS MADE OF;

PRESIDENCY: DANIEL ORTEGA AND THE GORBACHEV SUMMIT WILL FORCE THE DECISIONS 
THAT WILL DEFINE THIS ADMINISTRATION.

Two decades ago this week, in what seems another country, the United States was 
at war in Vietnam. And we were at war with one another. Richard Nixon, elected 
in a dead heat with Hubert Humphrey, with 43% of the vote, was a President 
besieged. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 15, 250,000 people arrived in Washington to protest the war. A number 
twice that, containing radical and violent elements, was expected Nov. 15. The 
demonstrations were to continue, monthly, until the White House buckled. 
</P>
<P>
Having pocketed Nixon's concessions on Great Society spending and troop 
withdrawals, the press began its drumbeat. "Nixon in Trouble!" read Newsweek's 
cover. Time's national affairs section said it was, "Nixon's Worst Week." "(I)t 
is becoming obvious with each passing day," wrote David Broder, "that the men 
and the movement that broke Lyndon Johnson's authority in 1968 are out to break 
Richard Nixon in 1969. The likelihood is great that they will succeed again." 
</P>
<P>
His White House split between accommodation and defiance, Nixon concludedthat 
his presidency was indeed at the breaking point and elected to turn and fight. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 3, 1969, in an address whose tone shocked his pursuers, Nixon asked the 
"Great Silent Majority" to stand with him, and against the protesters and the 
Establishment prodding them on. 
</P>
<P>
It was the defining moment of the Nixon presidency. Followed by Spiro Agnew's 
assault on the networks, 10 days later, Nixon's speech polarized the nation. By 
mid-November, his approval had soared to 69%. Nixon had set himself on a course 
leading, three years later, to the greatest landslide in history. 
</P>
<P>
While today's situation is less dramatic, George Bush is clearly at the 
defining moment of his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
And it was the little fascist, Daniel Ortega, who put him there. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Bouchey of the Council on Inter-American Security explains why: "Trailing 
in the polls, Ortega is worried that he will be forced to steal or call off the 
elections and then face the prospect of renewed fighting." Ortega must kill off 
the Contras, so that if he loses the election, he is free to retain power by 
force. 
</P>
<P>
By launching his attack now, Ortega has forced Bush either to watch, paralyzed 
and pathetic, as the Contras are butchered, or go to Congress and demand 
military aid, reigniting the war and giving Ortega the excuse he seeks to 
cancel elections. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming soon, the Bush Administration!" is how a joke marquee read months ago. 
It was apposite. Before autumn is over, Bush will have made the choices that 
define his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, the Administration theme has been "bipartisanship," a near compulsion 
to practice the soothing politics of compromise. 
</P>
<P>
In the name of bipartisanship, Bush let pass the lynching of his friend, John 
Tower. He has watched without protest the steady de-funding of the Strategic 
Defense Initiative. With James Baker insisting the votes were not there, the 
White House declined to fight for Contra aid. This week, Bush signed a 27% 
increase in the minimum wage, which will destroy thousands of entry-level jobs. 
One conservative position after another has been offered up on the altar of 
bipartisanship. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Bush has held the line on taxes. With Budget Director 
Richard Darman pressing the case, he may yet hold the line on spending, 
allowing the Gramm-Rudman budget cuts to take effect. After hesitation, Bush 
also toughened up on abortion funding. 
</P>
<P>
By leaning now left, now right, Bush has excited no one, but then he has 
fatally antagonized no one, which, in the galaxy of the moderate Republican, is 
apparently the best of all possible worlds. 
</P>
<P>
But now comes the Club Med summit, and the stakes are huge. The left has its 
agenda, which, unsurprisingly, is virtually the same as Mikhail Gorbachev's. It 
wants Bush to let Ortega finish the Contras, to open up credit lines to Moscow 
and to serve as sponsor for the Soviet president's entry into the World Bank 
and International Monetary Fund. And the left wants Bush to accelerate the 
timetable for a strategic-arms reduction agreement. If the President comes home 
with that kind of "success," he will be hailed as a peacemaker by the press. 
His center-right coalition will disintegrate. 
</P>
<P>
Bush probably cannot get through the fall without choosing. He will emerge 
either as an Eisenhower, committed to splitting the difference with the 
Democrats, or in the Nixon-Reagan mold. 
</P>
<P>
Before Christmas, Bush will likely make the decisions that define his 
presidency. On saving the Contras, on arms control, on Eastern Europe, on the 
bailout of Gorbachev. At long last, clarity.

CODES: 21 OF 85 CITIES IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAVE SEISMIC ORDINANCES AIMED AT 
UNREINFORCED MASONRY STRUCTURES. THE LAWS DIFFER WIDELY FROM CITY TO CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Times survey of city and county officials in Los Angeles and Ventura counties 
shows about 13,000 unreinforced masonry buildings have been identified. 
</P>
<P>
The largest number are in the city of Los Angeles, which has 7,991 brick 
commercial and residential structures, followed by Long Beach with 565, 
Pasadena with 500 and Alhambra with 330. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 85 cities in Los Angeles County, 21 have seismic safety ordinances in 
place, and a half dozen have upgraded their building codes. Another 11 cities, 
including Whittier, Beverly Hills and Alhambra, have laws under consideration, 
according to officials, while eight said they are following the Los Angeles 
County seismic safety ordinance passed in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinances differ by the amount of time given owners to either upgrade or 
demolish, ranging from 270 days in Huntington Park to three years in Los 
Angeles. The severity of enforcement varies as well. Long Beach passed the 
first seismic upgrading law in the county, in 1971, for example, but under its 
provisions officials cannot take action against recalcitrant owners until 1991, 
according to the city's superintendent of building and safety, Eugene Zeller. 
The city has 565 unreinforced buildings, Zeller added, and so far, "most are 
not done." 
</P>
<P>
The city of Downey, which gave owners a year to upgrade about a dozen 
unreinforced buildings in the late 1970s, has done no enforcement and does not 
know who has or has not complied, building official Bill Makshanoff said. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles' 1981 ordinance says buildings must be vacated or 
demolished if owners fail to meet their deadlines. But since many of the 
residential apartment buildings involved have hundreds of tenants paying among 
the lowest rents in the city, officials are unwilling to order them vacated, 
according to Carl Deppe, the earthquake enforcement chief for the city's 
Department of Building and Safety. 
</P>
<P>
"We now pursue the owners in court," he said. About 14 cases have been referred 
to court and another 260 are being prepared, Deppe said. 
</P>
<P>
Not all unreinforced masonry buildings are covered by most of the ordinances. 
Los Angeles city and county ordinances address only "bearing wall" structures, 
meaning those where the unreinforced masonry walls support the floors and the 
roofs. 
</P>
<P>
They do not cover pre-1934 buildings with a concrete or steel frame that have 
unreinforced masonry in "nonbearing" walls, such as along corridors or 
stairwells. Officials believe Long Beach is the only city in the county that 
includes them. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason it's hazardous is they could pop out and fall down," said Deppe. 
"We've just completed a survey and found 1,100. At least 200 are in the seven- 
to 13-story range." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Hall, the county Hall of Justice and the county Museum of 
Natural History are examples of this type of construction. Deppe said about 800 
of the buildings in Los Angeles are located downtown or in surrounding areas, 
with the rest in older areas of San Pedro, Westwood and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The city did its survey to comply with the 1986 state Unreinforced Masonry 
Building Act, which requires local governments to inventory all pre-1933 
structures and report the number to the state by January, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Reinforcement has progressed slowly throughout the county, even in areas that 
sustained substantial damage in the 1987 Whittier earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Pasadena, where officials estimate there are more than 500 brick 
buildings, has no earthquake safety ordinance, and only requires owners to 
upgrade if they are planning renovations, or if a new business is moving in. 
</P>
<P>
Often, the unreinforced masonry buildings are the oldest or most historic 
structures in their communities. Whole sections of the Old Pasadena district, 
for example, are lined with brick commercial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Some people worry that seismic upgrading could destroy charming neighborhoods. 
Melvyn Green, an engineering consultant who has done surveys of unreinforced 
masonry buildings in several cities, said: "If we tear them down and build 
whatever is trendy today, two years from now it's going to look kind of grim."

<P>
Ralph Grippo, the Torrance director of building and safety, went to the Bay 
Area after the Oct. 17 earthquake and inspected 20 homes in Santa Cruz County. 
</P>
<P>
Working as an emergency inspector, Grippo tagged more than half as unsafe to 
occupy, because "they had just kicked off the foundations." 
</P>
<P>
He came home worried about older wood frame houses in downtown Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no law in Torrance, or elsewhere in Los Angeles County, that 
requires seismic upgrading or even seismic evaluations of single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
At least 22 cities in the county, such as Torrance and the city of Los Angeles, 
have earthquake safety ordinances. But they address pre-1934 unreinforced 
masonry buildings, which are often brick-faced structures concentrated in older 
communities, such as downtown Los Angeles and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Unreinforced buildings have gotten the lion's share of public attention. But 
officials such as Grippo and other safety experts say unreinforced masonry is 
not the only type of building to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
Single-family homes, old or not, that are not properly bolted to their 
foundations are at risk, they say. Other structures described as potentially 
hazardous are: buildings with first-story garages or carports, a style not 
uncommon in apartment and office buildings; buildings made of pre-cast 
concrete, commonly found in warehouses or industrial parks; concrete buildings 
constructed in the 1960s and earlier that could pancake the same way the Nimitz 
Freeway did in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have many hazards remaining," said Fred Turner, structural engineer 
with the State Seismic Safety Commission in Sacramento. "Professional engineers 
have known this for years. Now the public is beginning to realize it." 
</P>
<P>
Parts of many heavily used public buildings are constructed with unreinforced 
masonry and remain to be upgraded, including city halls in Los Angeles, 
Pasadena, Culver City and Claremont, the Los Angeles County Hall of Justice and 
the County Museum of Natural History. 
</P>
<P>
According to a state Department of Conservation estimate, 34% of the hospital 
beds in Los Angeles and Orange counties will be lost in the event of a major 
earthquake on the Newport Inglewood Fault Zone. State laws do not require 
hospitals built before 1972 to be seismically upgraded unless they undergo 
voluntary renovations. 
</P>
<P>
There is an unknown number of buildings constructed after the Long Beach 
earthquake in 1933 -- which led to the first state and local laws requiring 
seismic resistance designs -- that may not be safe by today's standards. No 
inventory has been taken of them. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a large inventory of buildings which were built under codes in the 
1930s or 1940s that were less strong than current ones," said Pat Campbell, 
president of the Structural Engineers Assn. of California. "Those buildings may 
have structural problems in a major quake." 
</P>
<P>
The Uniform Building Code, a set of structural requirements for building 
construction and safety, did not require until 1952 that single family homes be 
bolted to their foundations. 
</P>
<P>
There are no retroactive state laws requiring homes built before then to have 
such bolting done, officials say. Assemblyman Dominic L. Cortese (D-San Jose) 
introduced a bill two years ago requiring this, but it died in the face of 
realtor opposition, according to a spokeswoman at his office. 
</P>
<P>
Other than unreinforced masonry structures, the only buildings covered by 
retroactive laws are public schools. The state, not local governments, has 
regulated school safety requirements since the Field Act was adopted after the 
1933 quake. Even though that only covered new construction, a later law called 
the Garrison Act required that any unreinforced masonry schools had to be 
upgraded or abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital construction standards are also controlled by the state under the 
Hospital Act of 1972. But it did not have retroactive provisions, and a survey 
done by the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development showed that 
"80% of the buildings don't meet the standards," spokesman Derek Pogson said. 
</P>
<P>
But David Langness, vice president of the Hospital Council of Southern 
California, said he believes most of the 164 general acute care hospitals in 
Los Angeles County meet seismic safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
The safety of a single-family house might simply depend on the quality of 
construction, said Michael Krakower, a South Pasadena structural engineer. Most 
houses built before the 1950s were either not anchored or inadequately 
anchored, with bolts set too far apart. "Those kinds of things were not common 
unless you had a knowledgeable or creative builder," Krakower said. 
</P>
<P>
The danger of an unbolted foundation would be particularly acute in areas with 
loose soil conditions, Krakower said, such as the San Gabriel foothills or the 
hills above Monterey Park. In Torrance, the older homes downtown are built on 
piers instead of a concrete foundation, a condition building chief Grippo had 
found common among homes destroyed in Santa Cruz. No surveys have been done to 
determine the total number of homes built on piers in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that none of the estimated 400 high-rises in San Francisco suffered 
major damage lends credence to the claims of local structural engineers such as 
Trailer Martin, president of the company that designed the 42-story One 
California Plaza and 53-story Citicorp 777 Tower buildings in downtown Los 
Angeles, that "big buildings are very, very safe." 
</P>
<P>
One reason is that they are less likely to resonate in step with the ground 
motions of an earthquake, due to their height, while a smaller building will 
shake more violently. 
</P>
<P>
Another is that they are more "elastic," said P. V. Banavalkar, the Texas-based 
engineer who did the structural designs for the tallest building in Los 
Angeles, the 73-story First Interstate World Center under construction in 
downtown Los Angeles. "When the seismic event stops and the building stops 
oscillating, it will come back to its original position," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That will not happen with many older and smaller buildings. The garage-fronted 
apartment houses in the Marina District of San Francisco that collapsed into 
the street are an example, as was Olive View Hospital, severely damaged during 
the 1971 Sylmar earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
In these designs, the upper floors were stiffer and more resistant than the 
ground floor, so that during an earthquake, they moved differently. "It's too 
much of a change," said Carl Deppe, chief of the earthquake safety division for 
the city of Los Angeles. "The forces become excessive in the first story 
elements and you get failures or even collapse." 
</P>
<P>
After 1971, Los Angeles building code requirements were changed to soften the 
effect of that condition, Deppe noted, and new code changes going into effect 
in January are even more stringent. But Deppe added: "It's still not a good 
condition to get a sudden change in stiffness from the upper stories to the 
bottom." And the new requirements are not retroactive to existing buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Another older type of construction that many now say is unable to absorb 
earthquake energy well is concrete frame design built before 1971. The Nimitz 
Freeway collapse Oct. 17, attributed to the failure of the joints and ties 
between its upper and lower sections, is an example of the same principle. This 
kind of concrete construction, Turner said, "exists in not only bridges but 
buildings." 
</P>
<P>
These structures have not been surveyed in Los Angeles, Deppe said, "most are 
commercial but there could be apartment houses and hotels. I expect in the '90s 
we'll be going after this type of building."

These are the bridges in the Los Angeles County area that have been designated 
by the California Department of Transportation as mostly like to sustain damage 
in an earthquake. They have been given top priority in a retrofitting program 
designed to strengthen the ability of their columns to withstand severe 
groundshaking. The risk rating the department has assigned to each bridge is 
based on a scale of 0.00 to 1.00, with 0.00 the least vulnerable and 1.00 the 
most vulnerable. The list represents only single column bridges. A program to 
retrofit multi-column bridges is expected to begin soon.

CARE NEEDED IN EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN THE HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is there anything a homeowner can do to reduce the chance that a great quake 
will level the homestead? A little, said Robert Holmes, a general contractor 
with Builtright Building Inspection, a Los Angeles firm that specializes in 
advising homeowners on how to protect their property. However, homeowners 
should also be warned that some efforts to strengthen their structures may 
backfire. 
</P>
<P>
Homes built before 1935 were not required to meet some of the standards set 
after the 1933 earthquake and may have inadequate foundations. After 1935, 
buildings were required to meet much tougher standards and there is little that 
the average homeowner can do to improve them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Before making significant changes, Holmes strongly recommends that homeowners 
have an expert look at the property. Times Science Writer Lee Dye interviewed 
Holmes about the measures homeowners might be able to take. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Have we learned anything from earthquakes? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: There are many changes in building standards that grew out of the 
lessons learned in the 1933 earthquake in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What changed? 
</P>
<P>
A: A new law passed in 1935 called for reinforcing (steel) to be placed within 
concrete, and it called for a better mix of concrete which could stand a higher 
burst test. Prior to that, concrete might only withstand a burst test of 1,300 
pounds or less. Concrete for residential construction is now set at 2,000 
pounds and can be mixed to a higher burst strength if needed. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What do you mean by burst strength? 
</P>
<P>
A: It means the concrete will withstand specific pressure of 2,000 pounds per 
square inch before it crumbles. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Does that mean that if your house was built prior to 1935, you need to 
suspect the quality of your foundation? 
</P>
<P>
A: I don't know if I would use a word as strong as suspect, but it would be 
prudent to be more concerned about the foundation . . . and consider having it 
inspected. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there something the homeowner can do to decide whether it is necessary to 
call in an expert? If you can drive a nail in it, would that tell you 
something? 
</P>
<P>
A: Actually, that is something you can try. I have seen concrete that was 
degraded enough that you could push a screwdriver into it. Older, lower-grade 
concrete will often begin to flake and degrade. You will see it along the 
interior rim of a foundation and it will almost look like a pile of very fine 
sand that is from the foundation. If there are large cracks within the 
continuous footing, particularly if there is any vertical or lateral 
displacement of the foundation where cracking has occurred, that is a very good 
sign of distress. 
</P>
<P>
Q: If the homeowner can drive a nail into the foundation, would that tell him 
he better get the experts in? 
</P>
<P>
A: It would be prudent. And if a person were to find a very soft and crumbling 
foundation, it would be prudent to have it examined. 
</P>
<P>
Q: So the experts come and say you have a really bad foundation. What can be 
done short of tearing the house down? 
</P>
<P>
A: A foundation can be completely replaced without tearing down a house. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How do you do that? 
</P>
<P>
A: It's similar to when a building is moved. The house would be supported 
temporarily on a framework of girders and raised off its foundation. Then the 
foundation can be jackhammered out, a new footing and stemwall system 
installed, and the house lowered back onto the new foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Q: But aren't we talking really big bucks? 
</P>
<P>
A: It's significant. The number runs between $150 to $175 per lineal foot, so 
that can climb in a hurry. But short of wholesale replacement, it is also 
possible to augment an existing foundation. I have seen it with hollow masonry 
units which are put on top of an existing foundation and then filled with 
mortar to provide additional integrity. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Prior to the early 1940s, the house was not required to be bolted to the 
foundation. Should a homeowner bore into the foundation and set some bolts in 
anchor cement to make sure it doesn't slide off? 
</P>
<P>
A: Very often that is a good idea. But bolts can localize the force vectors. 
That means the energy transmission that occurs during an earthquake would be 
focused on the bolts and the trauma of an earthquake could tear the foundation 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
Q: So you might shatter the foundation while trying to strengthen it? 
</P>
<P>
A: Exactly. It would be a good idea to have an engineer check it first. 
</P>
<P>
Q: If your home was built more recently, can you forget all this? 
</P>
<P>
A: I would say so. There may be certain circumstances . . . a foundation can be 
undermined by erosion . . . but having a post-1935 house is about as good an 
assurance as you can get that you are going to have a good foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Q: So generally speaking, if your house is built prior to 1935 you better take 
a hard look at the foundation and if it was built after 1935 there might be 
other things that would be more of a problem for you? 
</P>
<P>
A: That is correct. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You hear a lot of advice these days telling people to reinforce cripple 
walls . . . the short walls between the foundation and the main structure. Is 
that good advice? 
</P>
<P>
A: I would tend not to be too concerned about cripple walls unless they are on 
a hillside, three to four feet high. And I would not recommend any 
do-it-yourself remedies. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is it possible to worsen the situation by making the wall too rigid? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. I have seen people put up plywood and make a wall too rigid. That is 
going to transfer force in a way that the building is not intended to accept, 
and it can act almost like a whip. The building codes with regard to placement 
of the studs, placement of girders, and loads and lateral resistance in a 
residential context has not changed much through the years. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there anything in particular homeowners should do to improve their 
chances in an earthquake? 
</P>
<P>
A: Well, they should be aware of where their gas valve shut off is. It is 
important to have a water heater strapped and it is also important to have 
large pieces of furniture secured. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why is it important to have a water heater strapped? 
</P>
<P>
A: You have a significantly heavy item that is going to be moving back and 
forth and can do some damage. A water heater can also be an emergency source of 
drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What else? 
</P>
<P>
A: I would secure large pieces of furniture, like china cabinets, items that 
might weigh a significant amount that might fall on a person trying to flee the 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You mean literally screw them to the wall? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, that is what I mean. 
</P>
<P>
Q: We hear a lot these days about different soils and the effect of 
liquefaction. Is there something you ought to be particularly concerned about 
if you find the home you bought last year is in an area that is more 
susceptible to liquefaction? 
</P>
<P>
A: I would say no. And the reason for that is there isn't too much you can do 
about it. I am not aware of anything that an individual can do in a single-lot 
context to dramatically stabilize the soil that is beneath them. 
</P>
<P>
Q: If the soil fails, you are just out of luck? 
</P>
<P>
A: Right. 
</P>
<P>
Q: So what's a homeowner to do? 
</P>
<P>
A: Wood frame construction, which is by far the predominant construction 
methodology in Southern California, is a very good seismic type of 
construction, so we have a plus there. But it is prudent for people to be 
prepared even to the point of having earthquake drills. Heavy things in the 
home should be secured. It is absolutely critical that not just dad but mom and 
the kids all know the location of the gas shut off. A 2-year-old kid with a 
wrench of sufficient size can turn off a gas main, reducing the chance of fire. 
</P>
<P>
Q: But in most cases there probably isn't a lot that anyone can do about the 
structure unless there is evidence of a deteriorating foundation? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, I would say that.

O.C. EAGER TO ADD POWER OF DNA LAB TO CRIME FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a bustling corner of the FBI headquarters, Special Agent Jack Quill is 
poring over an X-ray that bears an odd-looking pattern not unlike the bar code 
on a box of cereal. 
</P>
<P>
But these horizontal lines have nothing to do with supermarkets. What Quill is 
holding on the oblong transparency is a piece of evidence that most likely will 
put a rape suspect behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
The case is one of the 400 in which the FBI's DNA Analysis Unit has completed 
its work since its opening last December. Work on 600 others, referred from law 
enforcement agencies throughout the country, is in progress. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes us probably two to three weeks before we can even start a case now, 
because of our backlog," said John W. Hicks, the FBI assistant director who 
runs the bureau's sprawling laboratory division. "And it will probably get 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
That is one of the reasons that Hicks and other DNA experts, both in government 
and out, are applauding decisions by officials in Orange County and other 
jurisdictions to build their own laboratories to track down violent criminals 
through DNA "fingerprints." 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's a very powerful technology that's going to have a tremendous 
impact on law enforcement," especially in identifying rapists and, to a lesser 
extent, murderers, Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
DNA testing technology represents a major breakthrough for law enforcement 
because it is a highly reliable method of positively matching blood, semen, 
hair or tissue samples taken from a crime scene with a blood sample taken from 
a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
The older technology of blood serology is effective in excluding suspects, but 
it hardly ever produces a positive identification. 
</P>
<P>
DNA, short for deoxyribonucleic acid, is an organic material found in the 
chromosomes of every human being. It carries the basic genetic code that 
determines individual characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
By matching the repeating chemical patterns in those sections of DNA that bind 
genes together, scientists can routinely make identifications with certainties 
of one in several billion. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, law enforcement officials hope to build a computerized central DNA 
"fingerprint" identification system that will allow authorities to determine 
whether a series of rapes or murders across the country was the work of a 
single person, or whether a suspect arrested in one state was connected to 
violent crimes in another. 
</P>
<P>
Despite questions raised by defense attorneys and civil libertarians, the 
technology has been accepted in trial courts in 34 states, according to an 
official of one of the two major private DNA testing laboratories in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
Appellate courts in three of those states -- Maryland, Virginia and Florida -- 
have upheld the use of DNA testing, said John W. Huss, vice president of 
Cellmark Diagnostics in Germantown, Md., about 25 miles northwest of 
Washington. No appellate court has yet rejected the technology. 
</P>
<P>
However, only two states and one local jurisdiction -- Virginia, North Carolina 
and Nassau County, N.Y. -- have opened DNA testing units in their own crime 
laboratories, according to the FBI. Six other state and local agencies, 
including the Orange County Sheriff-Coroner's Department, are on their way. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Board of Supervisors voted Oct. 17 to spend $200,000 to 
create a DNA unit in the county crime laboratory, $80,000 of which will be from 
private sources that have contributed to the Sheriff's Advisory Council. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was prompted in part by the disclosure that a suspect in the 
recent rape of a 12-year-old girl in Huntington Beach had been acquitted of a 
rape charge five months earlier because prosecutors were late in obtaining DNA 
evidence from a private laboratory. Had the evidence been received sooner, 
authorities have said, the man would probably have been convicted. 
</P>
<P>
"The sooner we get it on-line, we feel, the better off we're going to be," said 
Lt. Richard J. Olson, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
"We feel that evidence of this type is so overwhelming that in a lot of cases, 
rather than go to trial, we'll get more guilty pleas." And that, Olson said, 
would save both time and money. 
</P>
<P>
Further, in the cases that go to trial, police officials said, an in-house DNA 
lab would eliminate the need to hire expert witnesses from private 
laboratories, which charge fees of as much as $1,000 for a single court 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Exonerations can result in savings too, police said. If a DNA test determines 
early on that a prime suspect could not possibly have been the assailant, 
police are not wasting time or money going after the wrong person. 
</P>
<P>
However, it is difficult to determine the cost-effectiveness of establishing a 
DNA unit in a public crime lab, Huss said. The FBI performs its analyses for 
local police agencies at no cost, but the growing demand may mean longer waits 
for evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say a laboratory that is going to do 10 cases a year, it would be 
absurd," Huss aid. "But maybe it makes sense if you're going to do 30 to 50 
cases a year. . . . It's very hard to calculate break-even, in a non-revenue 
environment and a non-competitive environment. But I think there are practical 
reasons to do it, chiefly chain of custody." 
</P>
<P>
The technology was developed in the early 1980s, and it has been refined in 
recent years. Its first widespread commercial application was in paternity 
testing. Huss estimated that 85% of his company's business involves paternity 
cases, but its criminal work is significant. 
</P>
<P>
Cellmark, for example, performed the lab work that led to the conviction last 
month of a 35-year-old woman for the robbery and murder of a worker at a 
Ventura hamburger stand. It was the first California case in which genetic 
testing evidence was introduced. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't view the entry of the public sector laboratories as a surprise or a 
problem," Huss said. "When the FBI entered this business, our business shot up 
substantially because it gave the broadest possible endorsement to the 
technology." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to operating its own DNA lab, the FBI also trains law enforcement 
agents from all over the country in the use of the technology. The bureau 
expects that 120 people will take its DNA courses at Quantico, Va., next year. 
</P>
<P>
Still, despite its promise, DNA identification does have limitations. 
</P>
<P>
It is most effective in rape cases, because semen contains a large amount of 
DNA. In other cases, though, the blood samples or hair fibers sometimes prove 
to be too minute or too old to be effectively tested. 
</P>
<P>
And it is not cheap. The FBI estimates that each test it performs costs about 
$100; Huss put the figure closer to $200 a sample. 
</P>
<P>
Further, it is a painstaking procedure than may take as long as 12 weeks to 
perform, even without a backlog. 
</P>
<P>
And at the moment, it can only determine whether a known suspect is connected 
with a particular crime. As yet, there is no DNA database comparable to the 
massive FBI fingerprint index that permits identification of an otherwise 
unidentified person. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, DNA testing is subject to human error; one court so far has excluded 
DNA evidence because of a foul-up at the laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
The testing process begins when a bloody piece of clothing or other article 
from a crime scene arrives at the lab. First, blood or semen samples are tested 
using traditional technology. If those tests do not eliminate a suspect, the 
samples are passed along to the DNA unit. 
</P>
<P>
In an exacting process, the laboratory technicians extract pure DNA from the 
blood, semen or tissue sample, then purify it. The meter-long molecules of the 
double-stranded DNA are then cut into smaller pieces using agents known as 
restriction enzymes. 
</P>
<P>
"Just think of them as biological scissors," the FBI's Quill said. 
</P>
<P>
The DNA fragments are then placed on a sheet of gelatin that looks much like 
clear Jell-O. An electric current is applied, and the negatively charged DNA 
fragments migrate across the gelatin toward the positive charge, spreading 
according to their molecular weight. 
</P>
<P>
The double strands of DNA are chemically split in half, then transferred to a 
nylon membrane through a process known as Southern Blotting. 
</P>
<P>
The single DNA strands contain unique repeating patterns of organic chemicals 
that identify the individual who produced them (the matching strand contains 
complementary chemicals that fit the pattern precisely). 
</P>
<P>
Once the DNA molecules are fixed on the membrane, the technician introduces a 
radioactive probe. A probe is a single strand of DNA with a known pattern of 
chemicals. The probes attach themselves to the single strands of DNA molecules 
at precise intervals, according to how often the pattern of chemicals is 
repeated. That pattern of repetition is unique to each individual. 
</P>
<P>
When exposed to X-ray film, the radioactive probes create bands similar to the 
bar codes on supermarket items. Examiners such as Quill then read those bands, 
often using sophisticated computer equipment to assist in the analysis. 
</P>
<P>
If the same probe creates the same band pattern on DNA strands taken from two 
different samples, then the examiner concludes that the two samples are from 
the same individual. 
</P>
<P>
"There are about 90,000 rape cases that occur every year. . . , and only about 
half of those are solved," said the FBI's Hicks. "Many of these are probably 
the result of the mobile type of offender, selecting their victims at random 
and then moving on -- the Ted Bundy type. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the type of person that this technology is going to be able to help us 
catch." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DNA Fingerprinting 
</P>
<P>
This is the process a blood sample goes through to produce a DNA "fingerprint", 
or indentification, of a person 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1 Blood sample. 
</P>
<P>
2 DNA is extracted from blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
3 DNA is cut into fragments by a restriction enzyme. 
</P>
<P>
4 The DNA fragments are separated into bands during electrophoresis in an 
agarose gel. 
</P>
<P>
5 The DNA band pattern in the gel is transferred to a nylon membrane by a 
process known as Southern Blotting. 
</P>
<P>
6 The radioactrive DNA probe is prepared. 
</P>
<P>
7 The DNA probe binds to specific DNA sequences on the membrane. 
</P>
<P>
8 Excess DNA probe is washed off. 
</P>
<P>
9 At this stage the radioactive probe is bound to the DNA pattern on the 
membrane. 
</P>
<P>
10 X-ray film is placed next to the membrane to detect the radioactive pattern. 
</P>
<P>
11 The X-ray film is developed to make visible the pattern of bands that is 
known as a DNA fingerprint.

ORANGE COUNTY CAMPAIGNERS TAKE LAST SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY and DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County campaign season entered its final weekend with a mix of 
political controversy, candidates hitting the hustings and a last-minute push 
on an array of issues, including a proposed half-cent sales tax increase to 
raise $3.1 billion for transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
In Laguna Niguel, supporters of cityhood for the unincorporated community 
complained Saturday that county workers improperly uprooted campaign signs. 
</P>
<P>
In Irvine, a militant gay organization held a candlelight vigil to display 
opposition to a ballot measure that would repeal protections for gays in the 
city's Human Rights Ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
And countywide, supporters of Measure M, the proposed half-cent sales tax 
increase for transportation, continued their well-financed election battle, 
with hundreds of volunteer and paid campaign workers hitting the streets across 
the county to drum up support. 
</P>
<P>
County election officials kept busy counting absentee ballots that poured in, 
most of them resulting from a push by Measure M supporters. With the large 
number of absentee ballots -- upward of 20,000 are expected by Tuesday -- and 
the presence of the well-publicized countywide tax increase proposal, election 
officials were hard pressed to estimate just how many voters will show up at 
the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Registrar of Voters Donald Tanney declined to make a prediction about voter 
turnout. 
</P>
<P>
"If Measure M was not on the ballot," he said, he would have expected just 10% 
to 12%. He said he expects the $1.8 million-plus being spent in the campaign 
for the sales tax to change that. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if Measure M is going to increase that to 15%, 20% or 25%," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
About 250 campaign signs supporting Laguna Niguel's bid to become the county's 
29th city were removed from private property by a county public works crew 
Saturday, prompting a pro-incorporation organization to file a complaint with 
the Sheriff's Department against the county.

Representatives from Citizens for Cityhood said a three-person work crew began 
removing the signs from Crown Valley Parkway and La Paz Road before 9 a.m. 
Saturday. The white cardboard signs -- reading, "Laguna Niguel Cityhood -- Vote 
Yes on Nov. 7" -- were stapled onto five-foot stakes. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in a panic," said Jim Olmsted, a member of the organization. "We're a 
grass-roots group, and we don't have a lot of money to replace these signs. 
We're sick of the county stepping on us. They weren't even pulling out the 
signs, they were destroying them." 
</P>
<P>
The county has an ordinance against signs on county property, and a crew 
routinely removes the placards over weekends, said Lynne Fishel, assistant 
director of the Environmental Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
She would not comment until county offices reopen Monday about whether the 
signs were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Christiansen, one of 23 candidates running for five seats on a prospective 
Laguna Niguel city council, said he has a formal permit to post 400 signs 
throughout Laguna Niguel, including several on county-owned property. 
</P>
<P>
Christiansen said the crew still took down and tore up some of his signs. "We 
thought the signs were OK," he said. "This is unconscionable. Here we are 
asking for independence from the county, and they have directly attacked our 
political process on the closing days of the election." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of paid and volunteer campaign workers walked neighborhoods 
Saturday in Mission Viejo, Seal Beach and other areas of the county, as 
proponents of Measure M -- the half-cent sales tax increase -- pushed hard 
toward Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with lists of frequent voters, canvassers handed out thousands of 
brochures describing the ballot measure. The precinct-walking effort was 
intended to reach up to 300,000 voters by the election, according to former 
county supervisor Bruce Nestande, chairman of the Committee for Yes on M. 
</P>
<P>
Although he and other Measure M supporters had been worried in recent days that 
a quarter-cent sales tax increase for earthquake relief might undercut Measure 
M, Nestande was more upbeat Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Tracking polls conducted by telephone in recent days showed that most voters 
were not confusing the two tax issues, he said: "They seem to know that the 
quake relief measure doesn't have anything in it for Orange County, and Measure 
M does." 
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope that a campaign letter from the chairman of the 
California Transportation 
</P>
<P>
Commission would help the Measure M effort. The letter, which arrived in some 
voters' mailboxes Friday, said Measure M would provide money for bridge and 
highway safety efforts aimed at preventing serious earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing more we can do (about the special legislative session) than 
what we did with that letter," Nestande said. 
</P>
<P>
Measure M's foes, who spent the day distributing flyers at shopping centers, 
strongly criticized the letter. Their chief objection was that it appeared to 
be an official communication from a state agency. 
</P>
<P>
Nestande, however, said the campaign had the mailer set in type and did not 
actually photograph or reproduce state stationery. The brochure also carried a 
disclaimer stating that it was not mailed or printed at taxpayer expense. 
</P>
<P>
While the Measure M forces have managed to drum up thousands of absentee ballot 
requests from voters, that push has run into some glitches. Several hundred 
requests for absentee ballots sent to the Yes on M campaign got caught in a 
mail delay. They were postmarked Oct. 27 but not delivered to the campaign 
until Saturday -- a few days after the deadline for requesting such a ballot 
from the county, campaign officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Voter turnout remains a key factor in Measure M's chances at the ballot box. 
Polls have consistently shown that supporters of Measure M outnumber opponents, 
but that foes are more likely to vote. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent poll by The Times Orange County Edition, respondents identified as 
the most likely to vote rejected the measure, 46% to 33%. But when the sample 
was expanded to include the "somewhat likely" voters, the measure passed, 52% 
to 29%. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides in the campaign said the measure, which requires a simple majority 
vote, has a good chance of passing if the turnout approaches 30%. If turnout is 
less than 25%, however, both sides say the measure could be in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Hoffenblum, campaign manager for the Yes on Measure M forces, said he is 
anticipating a turnout of 25% to 30%: "Less than 25%, and it could be a 
problem. If we get out our vote, I think we're going to win." 
</P>
<P>
For nearly half of the county's voters, Measure M will be the only item on the 
ballot. For the rest, several municipal ballot issues and school and special 
district races are expected to draw voters. 
</P>
<P>
In Fountain Valley, voters will consider the recall of Councilman Fred Voss, 
who was arrested in January on suspicion on soliciting sex from a plainclothes 
officer during a crackdown on prostitution in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 61 school board candidates are vying for 25 positions. There are also 
special district elections in the Laguna Niguel Community Services District, 
the Silverado-Modjeska Park and Recreation District and the Los Alisos Water 
District. 
</P>
<P>
As of last week, county election officials said there were 1,136,039 voters 
registered in the county for Tuesday's election -- the highest total ever 
recorded for an off-year ballot and about 10% higher than in November, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
That figure, however, is about 50,000 less than for last year's presidential 
election.

ON THE BALLOT 
</P>
<P>
Measure M, the proposed countywide sales tax for transportation projects, is 
the only countywide issue facing all 1.15 million registered voters Tuesday, 
but more than a fourth of the county's voters will also have a chance to decide 
school board races, cityhood and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
Elections in Orange County on Tuesday include: 
</P>
<P>
Countywide: Measure M, a half-cent sales tax increase to pay for an estimated 
$3.1 billion in traffic improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine: Measure N, an initiative sponsored by anti-gay rights activists seeking 
to remove gays from protection under the city's Human Rights Ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel: Measure O, a cityhood proposal for residents who live in the 
unincorporated area now administered by the county. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the ballot in Laguna Niguel is Measure P, which asks: If a majority of 
voters approve cityhood, should city council members be elected by district or 
at large? Voters will also be asked to choose from among 23 candidates five who 
would make up a city council, should cityhood win. In addition, voters will be 
asked to vote for two incumbents to continue serving on the Laguna Niguel 
Community Services District should cityhood fail. 
</P>
<P>
La Palma: Voters will consider Measure Q, a proposed 4% utility user tax to 
raise money for the city's general fund and the police and recreation 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach: Measure R would authorize the city to extend for 10 years the 
current lease on property at West Coast Highway and Newport Boulevard to 
encourage private redevelopment of the site. The current lease to private 
businesses there expires in 2008. 
</P>
<P>
Also in Newport Beach, voters will consider Measure S, which would allow the 
sale of an unused, vacant, $350,000 city-owned lot on River Road to raise money 
for libraries and parks. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley: Voters will decide whether to recall City Councilman Fred 
Voss, who was arrested in January for soliciting sex from a plainclothes 
officer during a prostitution crackdown. Voss pleaded no contest to misdemeanor 
charges of soliciting prostitution, and was fined and placed on probation. 
Voters will also decide whether Voss' successor shall be elected or appointed 
if the recall is successful. 
</P>
<P>
Voters will elect two trustees each in the Coast Community College District and 
Garden Grove Unified, Irvine Unified, and Santa Ana Unified school districts. 
</P>
<P>
Three trustees each will be selected in the Newport-Mesa Unified, Huntington 
Beach Union High, Anaheim City and Lowell Joint school districts. 
</P>
<P>
In the Orange Unified School District, voters will choose four trustees to 
serve four-year terms, plus one to fill the remaining two years of an unexpired 
term. 
</P>
<P>
Voters will elect four trustees in the Silverado-Modjeska Park and Recreation 
District. 
</P>
<P>
Property owners in the Los Alisos Water District will choose two directors from 
among three candidates. The district includes parts of Lake Forest and El Toro. 
Landowners cast one vote for each dollar of their assessed property value by 
mail-in ballot.

COMMON QUESTIONS ABOUT MEASURE M 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Measure M, the half-cent sales tax increase proposal for transportation 
projects, is the only countywide issue facing voters Tuesday. The measure would 
earmark $3.1 billion for a variety of freeway, transit and surface street 
projects over a fixed 20-year period. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, campaign letters and brochures have been mailed by both sides 
in the Measure M election battle, with both sides making varied claims. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a list of frequently asked questions about Measure M, what the 
ordinance says, and what supporters and critics say about it: 
</P>
<P>
Q. 
</P>
<P>
Will it relieve traffic congestion on Orange County freeways? If so, for how 
long? 
</P>
<P>
What Measure M says: Freeway capacity will increase from an average of 160,000 
vehicles a day on the Santa Ana Freeway in 1988 to more than 260,000 daily by 
the end of the 20-year period, and improvements on the Costa Mesa, Orange, 
Riverside and San Diego freeways would be similar but less dramatic. 
Completion, in some cases, would be 10 years sooner than would be possible 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters: Yes, within a 20-year period. Even with improvements, though, some 
slowing will occur during peak travel periods, with speeds below 30 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents: After all improvements are in place, congestion will occur at some 
places such as the junction of the Santa Ana and San Diego freeways in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Q. 
</P>
<P>
How much will it cost me? 
</P>
<P>
Measure: The ballot language does not estimate how much would be collected from 
individual taxpayers or families in an average year. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters: Economists estimate that a half-cent increase in the sales tax, 
from the current 6 cents to 6 1/2 cents, will cost $50 to $75 a year for each 
man, woman and child living in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents: No estimate on sales tax per resident. 
</P>
<P>
Q. 
</P>
<P>
What impact will the measure's growth management policy have? 
</P>
<P>
Measure: It "emphasizes good planning, improved cooperation between neighboring 
cities, and requires that new development pay a fair share for measures to deal 
with traffic generated by that new development." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters: Any city that fails to submit a growth management plan meeting 
Measure M requirements will become ineligible for sales tax proceeds. This will 
give cities an incentive to phase new development so that it does not outpace 
needed traffic improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents: One camp of opponents says the growth controls are too weak to 
prevent more congestion and that they merely reflect existing state planning 
laws; the other contends that there should be no controls at all because they 
infringe on the rights of property owners. 
</P>
<P>
Q. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a heavy reliance on car-pool lanes in the freeway projects outlined in 
Measure M? If so, why? 
</P>
<P>
Measure: More car-pool lanes than regular lanes will be added to freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters: State and federal governments virtually demand car-pool lanes as a 
condition for giving highway construction funds. Also, the installation of such 
lanes on the Costa Mesa and San Diego freeways has improved traffic flow. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents: Measure M pours hundreds of millions of dollars into the 
installation of car-pool lanes at a time when their effectiveness is being 
challenged by citizens' groups. 
</P>
<P>
Q. 
</P>
<P>
Will the traffic improvements planned in Measure M benefit all areas of the 
county equally? 
</P>
<P>
Measure: The measure does not evaluate the geographic spread of highway and 
transit projects. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters: There are enough projects in Measure M to ensure that almost every 
commuter will experience some relief from congestion, though perhaps not all 
the time, in every corner of the county. Much of the money will go for street 
maintenance and improvements in the cities, which bargained to get $450 million 
in street projects from the revenue when Measure M was being written. Most of 
the cities -- and most of the local streets to be fixed -- are in the north. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents: Except for freeway projects, many of the improvements will occur on 
arterials used primarily by South County residents, and this would be at the 
expense of residents in the north. 
</P>
<P>
Q. 
</P>
<P>
What power will the citizens' oversight committee have to ensure the money 
raised is spent properly? 
</P>
<P>
Measure: The panel can demand explanations of any spending plan deviation from 
the chairman of the local transportation authority (in this case, the Orange 
County Transportation Commission), who must respond within 60 days, and any 
amendments or changes in spending must be approved by a two-thirds vote of 
citizens' committee members. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters: The citizens' committee will be an effective check on the power of 
transportation officials, especially because its opinions are expected to 
receive wide publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents: The committee has no authority to actually block disbursement of 
funds. Its only real power is to alert the news media and encourage citizen 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Q. 
</P>
<P>
What effect will the half-cent sales tax have on jobs and the county's overall 
economic health? 
</P>
<P>
Measure: It does not refer to jobs or economic conditions specifically, but it 
does state that it is intended to "preserve the quality of life of Orange 
County residents," and it characterizes some traffic improvements as critical 
to mobility. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters: A few retail sales jobs may be lost because of the slight decrease 
in consumers' purchasing power, but that will be offset by employment gains in 
the construction trades. Further, enhanced mobility will reduce accidents and 
will discourage companies leaving the county for less congested areas. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents: The county's well-being will be jeopardized with the funneling of 
additional tax revenue into the wrong mix of projects. Congestion will only get 
worse, increasing fuel bills and leading to more accidents and additional 
insurance costs. 
</P>
<P>
Q. 
</P>
<P>
What options besides a sales tax were considered? Why were they rejected? 
</P>
<P>
Measure: Does not explain. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters: Experts analyzed additional developer fees and also county gas, 
employee, parking and vehicle registration taxes and levies, but each of these 
alternatives posed either an insurmountable legal or political problem or was 
shown in projections as raising insufficient funds for the projects in Measure 
M. For example, to raise the same amount as the half-cent sales tax, a gasoline 
surtax of 19 cents would be needed, and it also would require approval of 
two-thirds of the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents: Alternatives such as user fees and gasoline taxes were not given a 
sufficient airing before citizens' groups. One critic of Measure M advocates, 
simply on principle, gasoline tax increases, even if those mean certain defeat 
at the polls. Another argues that user fees, or tolls, could be levied on 
trucks using specific roads, even though changes in state laws would be needed 
to implement such a proposal and it also could face court challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Q. 
</P>
<P>
Does Measure M aid developers? 
</P>
<P>
Measure: "Retail tax revenues shall not be used to replace private developer 
funding which has been or will be committed for any (transportation) project." 
Local governments also are prohibited from substituting new sales tax revenue 
for funds already used for traffic improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters: The two provisions above, plus growth management requirements in 
the measure, are aimed at ensuring that the tax proceeds will be used to 
correct existing traffic problems, not those caused by future development, 
which under Measure M is required to pay its own way. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents: Some of the traffic improvements in Measure M will make it easier 
for people to get to developers' new projects, and it thus will promote 
additional growth. For example, the planned Riverside-Irvine commuter rail link 
will stimulate job growth, commercial and industrial development and traffic 
congestion in the Irvine Spectrum complex, a an Irvine Co. development near the 
already jammed junction of Interstates 5 and 405.

SLAYING SUSPECT SURRENDERS AT SCHULLER CHURCH

A Central California man wanted in connection with the strangulation of a 
57-year-old West Hollywood resident surrendered early Saturday morning after 
talking to a pastor at the Crystal Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Murray, 23, of San Luis Obispo was arrested in the Tower of Hope, a 
building in the church complex, by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies 
shortly after 4 a.m. Murray had been sought by investigators after Richard 
Roberts was found strangled in his Sweetzer Avenue apartment on Oct. 31, 
sheriff's Deputy Patrick Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
Pastor Sandy Freud of the Crystal Cathedral said he had advised Murray on 
Friday to surrender. He later made arrangements for him to be turned over to 
deputies. 
</P>
<P>
The Crystal Cathedral, founded by television evangelist Robert Schuller, is 
known worldwide from Schuller's "Hour of Power," broadcast from the church each 
Sunday. The cathedral is the headquarters of the Dutch Reformed Church of 
America. Freud would not discuss some details of his meeting with Murray, 
claiming it was a privileged discussion between a minister and "someone in 
need." But he said it was arranged by the suspect's mother, a regular church 
member. 
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't much advising to do," Freud said. "He was ready to give himself 
up and I told him it was the best thing to do. He said he was very remorseful . 
. . and he was also surrendering to save his 18-year-old brother, who was 
arrested in Las Vegas for the murder." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter said he could not say if Murray's brother had been detained by 
authorities in Las Vegas, but he confirmed that last week homicide detectives 
had left Los Angeles County to "pursue out-of-state leads." 
</P>
<P>
Freud said he was confident Murray would surrender after he spoke with the 
suspect and his mother Friday evening. He said he had given Murray's mother a 
list of telephone numbers where he could be reached. 
</P>
<P>
"When I arrived at a dinner party in Placentia I got a message that Mark Murray 
had called," he said. "I immediately returned his call and he asked me whether 
we should meet at a coffee shop or someplace else to surrender to police. I 
told him the best place was at my office." 
</P>
<P>
Upon arriving at Tower of Hope offices, Freud said he called the Los Angeles 
County sheriff's homicide office and asked them to page the investigating 
sergeant, who lives in neighboring Orange. The pastor said he and Murray spoke 
while they waited for officers to reach the church. 
</P>
<P>
"There was really never any question about what he wanted to do," Freud said. 
"He was scared and he was sorry. It was also extremely important that he 
cleared his brother." 
</P>
<P>
Homicide detectives arrived with a camera crew from the Fox Broadcasting series 
"Cops." The crew was taping a typical night's work when the detectives took 
Murray into custody.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: OFF-AIR TACTICS REVEAL MUCH OF MINISTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Covering religious broadcasters in Orange County over the last four years has 
been both a revelation and an education. 
</P>
<P>
For a relatively small area, the county seems to be home to a disproportionate 
number of televangelists and Christian radio ministers, most of whom were drawn 
to this area from different parts of the country. Among those attracted by the 
hospitable religious climate in 1973 was an ambitious young man named Jim 
Bakker. 
</P>
<P>
While Bakker, sentenced last month to 45 years and a $500,000 fine for mail 
fraud, did not last here, many others did remain and prosper. Thanks to 
satellite and microwave technology, county-based broadcasters not only blanket 
the nation, they now envelope the globe: 
</P>
<P>
From Garden Grove, Robert H. Schuller's "Hour of Power" beams down to 
television screens in Europe; from Tustin, Paul and Jan Crouch's "Praise the 
Lord" is seen in Italy, South Africa and China; from Santa Ana, Chuck Smith's 
"Word for Today," on both television and radio, reaches Australia and the 
Philippines; from Fullerton, Charles Swindoll's daily "Insight for Living" 
radio show reaches Canada; from Costa Mesa, Paul Finkenbinder's "Hermano Pablo" 
covers Latin America, and until his death earlier this year, Walter Martin, 
Irvine's "Bible Answer Man" was heard as far afield as Burma and Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's considerable impact on the world of religion extends to the 
written word. At various times, books by Schuller, Swindoll, Smith and Martin, 
as well as those by Irvine's pastor and occasional broadcaster Tim Timmons, 
have been prominent on the religious best-seller lists. 
</P>
<P>
These men have about them an undeniable charisma and not inconsiderable charm, 
which has been useful in the wake of the televangelism scandals. None has 
personally been involved in the controversies surrounding the ministries of 
Bakker, Jimmy Swaggart or Oral Roberts, or Pat Robertson's run for President. 
But the way most of Orange County's broadcast ministries handled requests for 
information about their leaders and their organizations' finances told as much 
about them, I think, as their ledgers and tax returns. It was a measure of 
their self-confidence in a time of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of one television minister were tough negotiators on the 
subject of ground rules. They were not bashful about having their board members 
write letters to The Times, extolling the minister's virtues, well before any 
of the articles on their organization were published. Yet they answered 
hundreds of written questions fully, supplied documents on request and agreed 
to an interview with the minister, who later wrote a note of thanks. 
</P>
<P>
The founder and officials of another religious broadcast organization were 
initially quite open. Soon, however, questions went unanswered and calls were 
no longer returned. Ultimately, the only channel of communication left was to 
tele-copy questions to the organization's private investigator or to one of its 
attorneys. Negative mail from religious broadcasters who appear on the network 
-- some of whom acknowledged not reading any of the articles -- was heavy. 
</P>
<P>
In the area of religious radio, the range was equally striking. The late Walter 
Martin was expansive in his cooperation and instructed his staff to do 
likewise. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, another radio minister wrote in a letter: "I neither seek nor 
desire publicity. There are many who do, but I am not one of them, even though 
I realize some notoriety simply comes with the territory." 
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, some other unique and equally revealing aspects to 
writing about Orange County religious broadcasters and their life styles. 
</P>
<P>
While not in the same league as the Bakkers', the perks reported by various 
broadcasters based in Orange County include a ministry-supplied $70,000 BMW, a 
$350,000 house, a $125,000 salary, a Hawaiian condo and a $2-million, 
8,000-square-foot vacation getaway in Lake Arrowhead. 
</P>
<P>
But knowing that some of these articles would travel beyond Orange County, it 
was often necessary to include the caveat -- astounding, I imagine, to readers 
in other parts of the country -- that such benefits "are not considered 
excessive by Orange County standards."

LAGUNA TO STUDY HAZARDS AT HIRING LOT

LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A blue pickup truck pulls off the road. The driver motions to a group of 30 
young men standing across the street. 
</P>
<P>
Cars whiz past. The men wait anxiously to cross the road and bargain for a 
day's wage, when suddenly two men bolt across the road -- into the path of a 
moving truck, which narrowly misses them. 
</P>
<P>
It is a scene, officials say, that is being repeated over and over as 
dayworkers gather on busy Laguna Canyon Road -- a knot of mostly young Latino 
men eager to do a day's work for meager wages. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say the scene along the winding road has become increasingly 
dangerous as crowds of job-hungry men compete for scarce work by darting across 
traffic to crowd around the employers in trucks and vans who pass by the lot 
looking for hired help. 
</P>
<P>
Already, two dayworkers have been struck by cars while trying to cross Laguna 
Canyon Road. More recently, a dayworker broke his leg when he was hit by a car 
near the hiring area. 
</P>
<P>
The car was heading south toward Laguna Beach when the man ran out in front of 
a crowd of dayworkers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was horrible. He was hit right in front of me," says Ben Willits, a Laguna 
Beach resident who was standing at a nearby bus stop. "The car just hit him and 
sent him flying like a rag doll." 
</P>
<P>
While none of the accidents has resulted in serious injuries, residents fear 
that someone will be killed if the city does not monitor the situation more 
closely. Spurred by complaints from residents and business owners on Laguna 
Canyon Road, city officials on Tuesday will discuss ways to reduce the dangers. 
</P>
<P>
Measures being considered include restricting pickups to one side of the road, 
posting a police officer or other city employee in the area and restricting 
workers and employers to one pickup spot. 
</P>
<P>
Council members say they have no plans to bar the workers from public streets 
and note that they have gone out of their way to find a suitable place for the 
workers to gather -- unlike other cities that have called in Immigration and 
Naturalization Service officials to round up those who may be in the country 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
"Complex social issues can never be solved easily by ordinance," Mayor Robert 
F. Gentry says. "As long as I'm on the City Council, I will never go for that." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some local businessmen have criticized officials for relocating the 
dayworkers to the heavily traveled road that connects Laguna Beach to the San 
Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes logical sense that you don't put them on one of the busiest streets 
in the county," says Joe Jaharaus, who owns Laguna Beach Lumber Co., across the 
street from the pickup site. "One of these days, there is going to be a major 
accident." 
</P>
<P>
Jaharaus says he has seen two dayworkers struck by cars and a collision between 
a van and a truck that was pulling into traffic after picking up a worker. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you how many accidents we have had involving dayworkers," 
Jaharaus says. "People slamming into our gate. It's a very dangerous spot 
here." 
</P>
<P>
The dayworkers, mostly young Mexican men in their late teens and 20s, used to 
gather on Coast Highway in North Laguna. But when residents there complained, 
the city told the workers to move the pickup spot to a parking lot on Laguna 
Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly eight months ago, they asked the workers to move another 100 yards up 
the road because the lot was being used for Festival of the Arts parking in the 
summer. The workers now gather at two spots just south of El Toro Road. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Canyon Road was picked "because we wanted them to be able to get off 
their bus and go to their place of work," Councilwoman Martha Collison says. 
"Also, this did not impact on a residential neighborhood because there were 
already some commercial businesses there." 
</P>
<P>
Gentry says he sympathizes with the dayworkers' plight and added that he sees 
them as a vital part of the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
"If I ever had to leave my country and risk a number of things, in some cases 
my life, to seek work to support my family, to me that is pretty impressive," 
he says. "It's not a negative thing. It's American capitalism at its finest."

NEIGHBORS OPPOSE CHAPMAN COLLEGE PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
GROWTH: RESIDENTS VOW TO FIGHT WHAT COULD BE A 50% INCREASE IN ENROLLMENT. 
</P>

Chapman College and residents in the surrounding neighborhood in Orange are at 
odds over the new college president's plans to increase enrollment 50% over the 
next five years and to rename the private college Chapman University. 
</P>
<P>
"We will fight it; we will not put up with any more expansion," said Carole 
Walters, leader of the Orange Concerned Citizens Group, an organization of 
about 25 neighbors who have opposed expansion of the college. "What we want 
from Chapman College is communication, and we haven't gotten that yet." 
</P>
<P>
Walters' group and another local residents' group, the Old Towne Preservation 
Assn., have been working together to prevent the 128-year-old private college 
from encroaching on their historically rich neighborhood of Victorian and 
early-California-style homes. 
</P>
<P>
Some neighbors are concerned about the growth that would result from changing a 
college to a university. But most seem worried about the immediate problems, 
such as more traffic and noise, that increasing enrollment from 2,200 to 3,500 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be most concerned about when those students would be here," said Joe 
Suste, a preservation association member who owns a home built in 1909 that is 
near the college. "If we're going to have a lot of night and weekend traffic, 
that would be a big problem." 
</P>
<P>
Suste's concerns stem from the college's plan to attract more students to 
attend courses during evenings and weekends. But college President Allen E. 
Koenig said he and the trustees want to increase the number of full-time 
students on the campus, where a great many who attend are part time. 
</P>
<P>
"The 3,500 figure is simply a goal," said Koenig, who took over as the 
college's 11th president in October. "We're going to live up to our agreement 
with the city of Orange." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the City Council approved a long-range development plan to 
increase the college's capacity to 2,500 students at any one time. That 
decision, in effect, permits enrollment to increase to 3,500, provided that not 
all the students are on campus at once. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the college's expansion efforts console local residents with the 
idea that a bigger and better university nearby will increase their property 
values. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand and respect their positions," Paul Frizler, chair of both the 
Faculty Senate and the English department, said of the residents. "But I don't 
think they are seeing this whole thing very clearly. I really think (the 
expansion) helps, rather than hinders, the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners are not convinced. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to have to go to battle for this," said Dale Rahn, a former 
president of the preservation association. "I would hope they would be 
sensitive to the community, but it'll all be worked out in the political 
process."

TACO BELL: A RINGING SUCCESS; 
</P>
<P>
FAST FOOD: THE COMPANY'S SUCCESS IS MIRRORED BY ITS ABILITY TO LOWER PRICES AND 
CONTINUE TO REPORT SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER EARNINGS. THE INCREASED POPULARITY OF 
MEXICAN FOOD HELPS TOO.

<P>
Sometimes the tried-and-true methods work the best. 
</P>
<P>
While Taco Bell is investing millions of dollars in fancy technology for the 
future, the Mexican fast-food chain has been making money the old-fashioned way 
-- slashing prices. 
</P>
<P>
The chain's national discounting strategy, with tacos and other key items 
selling in some areas for as little as 49 cents, has made Taco Bell one of the 
hottest fast-food operations in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine-based company, which just opened its 3,000th restaurant, expects 
chainwide sales to top $2 billion this year, a 25% jump over 1988 and almost 
four times what they were seven years ago. At the same time, sales per unit are 
up an average of 21% this year over last, with 1989 sales per unit expected to 
top $700,000. A total of 3,080 Taco Bell units are projected to be opened by 
the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The PepsiCo subsidiary's sizzling performance is one of the most impressive 
turnarounds in the quick-service industry in recent years. And Taco Bell is 
taking a bigger bite of the $60-billion-a-year fast-food market at a time when 
there is fierce competition within the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the chain's recent success has been nourished by Taco Bell's 
"value-menu" program, a discount program that dropped the price of six popular 
items -- including tacos, tostadas and burritos -- from 79 cents to as low as 
49 cents in some areas. The resulting lines of customers more than make up what 
Taco Bell gives up by lowering prices, company executives said. 
</P>
<P>
The company's revamping -- including nationwide expansion, broader menus, 
better advertising and, of course, cheap food -- has allowed Taco Bell to snare 
nearly 70% of the $2.8-billion Mexican fast-food market. At the same time, the 
chain also has captured a 3% share of the overall fast-food market, up from 1% 
in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the long period, it (Taco Bell) has been a fabulous business," said Dean 
Witter Reynolds analyst Lawrence Adelman. "It's the ability to lower prices and 
still report substantially increased earnings." 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, Taco Bell's growth has been helped by a boom in the popularity 
of Mexican food. Traffic counts in quick-service Mexican restaurants -- one of 
the fastest-growing food segments in recent years -- were up 9.4% last year, 
the National Restaurant Assn. reported. 
</P>
<P>
Martin and the Taco 
</P>
<P>
Taco Bell's turnaround began in 1983, when John Martin, former president of 
Burger Chef Systems and Hardees, took over as the chain's chief executive and 
president. At the time, sales were slumping, profits were losing steam, 
restaurants were small and outdated, and a lot of folks weren't even sure what 
a taco or tostada was. 
</P>
<P>
PepsiCo bought Taco Bell in 1978 but for several years did little to change the 
chain's menu, restaurants or operations. So within four years, by 1982, sales 
had dropped an average of 16%. 
</P>
<P>
"The chain was deficient in literally every part of how it did business," 
Martin recalled in a recent interview. "It wasn't making much money, and 
everybody said that Taco Bell would be out of business by the turn of the 
decade." 
</P>
<P>
So Martin launched what he called the "four-by-four strategy," an ambitious 
plan that meant increasing the number of restaurants from 1,489 to 4,000 and 
achieving companywide sales of $4 billion by the end of 1991 -- a goal he 
claims still is within the chain's reach with continued expansion and 
acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone thought it was an unbelievable proposition," Martin said. "The answer 
was that if we didn't, we weren't going to be around." 
</P>
<P>
The strategy involved a key change in corporate thinking: "We had to understand 
that our prime competition was not the other Mexican feeders -- it was 
fast-food in general," Martin said. That meant going head-to-head with 
McDonald's and other major fast-food chains. 
</P>
<P>
To do that, Taco Bell stepped up new store building and acquisitions from 70 to 
80 stores a year to about 300 to 350, largely into the Midwest, Southeast and 
Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
The company set about to spruce up its image. The nondescript signs and logos 
showing a Mexican sleeping under a sombrero were replaced with the bolder, more 
recognizable yellow bell on a bright red background. And older stores that 
looked like plastic adobe mini-missions were remodeled with lots of bright, 
arched windows. 
</P>
<P>
Drive-through windows were added and are now in about 80% of Taco Bell stores. 
</P>
<P>
The chain's television advertising budget was quadrupled from $20 million in 
1982 to about $80 million this year. Overhead and administrative costs -- such 
as product purchasing -- became more efficient as well. 
</P>
<P>
There were minor changes -- including spiffier packaging and replacing the 
dowdy, brown uniforms worn by hourly workers -- as well as more sweeping ones, 
such as adding training centers, dual production lines and more up-to-date 
cooking equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Then the menu -- which hadn't varied much in years -- was spiced up. Taco Bell 
added some new items -- including Mexican pizza, Nachos Bell Grande, soft-shell 
tacos, fajitas -- and tried then scrapped others such as seafood salad. 
</P>
<P>
Unit Sales Were Down 
</P>
<P>
The changes helped the chain's sales grow steadily until 1988. By September of 
that year, Taco Bell's operating profits and sales had slid through the 
preceding nine months. But its average sales per unit -- the industry barometer 
of performance -- were sagging. 
</P>
<P>
Martin at the time blamed the decline on higher food costs, capital investments 
and a general softness in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts saw it differently. Taco Bell "had gotten away from the 
perception as a value purveyor," said Jay Nelson, an analyst with Brown 
Brothers Harriman &amp; Co. "A lot of the new menu items had been priced at 
around $2. And that wasn't the way to go." 
</P>
<P>
So last December -- with the industry awash with rumors of Martin's impending 
departure -- Taco Bell went nationwide with its "value-menu" program that it 
had begun testing in late 1986 in selected markets. 
</P>
<P>
With the discounted pricing, Taco Bell was making a big pitch for what the 
industry calls the "heavy user" -- the 18- to 34-year-old customer who eats 
fast-food an average of 17 times a month. 
</P>
<P>
They are customers like Paul Quinn, a 30-year-old salesman from Costa Mesa, who 
eats out virtually every night of the week. Munching a soft-shell taco last 
week, Quinn explained how Taco Bell had won him over. 
</P>
<P>
"I can grab lunch for under $2.50," he says. "Lowering prices really got me 
into coming here because now I can afford to eat it" three or four times a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quick, spicy, good and cheap," added Ken Gaitan, 26, a Costa Mesa 
mortgage banker who often eats at Taco Bell. "Pepsi did for Taco Bell what 
McDonald's did with hamburgers -- high standards with quality, and taste that's 
consistent." 
</P>
<P>
That perception has given Taco Bell the boost it sought. The chain's sales last 
year were $1.6 billion -- up only slightly from $1.5 billion in 1987. Taco 
Bell's 1988 operating profits before tax, meanwhile, totaled $81.6 million, 
contrasted with $91.4 million the year before. 
</P>
<P>
But for the three quarters of 1989 -- with the cut-rate prices and some other 
promotions in place -- Taco Bell has recorded year-to-date, before-tax 
operating profit of $83.9 million, up 50% from the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, average sales per store, which were $380,000 in 1982, are 
projected to top $700,000 this year, up from $589,000 last year. By contrast, 
industry leader McDonald's Corp. averages $1.5 million per restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
There was never much doubt that slashing menu prices by 30% would bring in more 
hungry diners. The big question was: Could the sales growth be sustained? 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know whether it would be like Sears -- where they cut prices, got a 
big boost in sales, then it all fell apart," said James J. Murren, a restaurant 
analyst with C.J. Lawrence in New York. 
</P>
<P>
But that doubt seems to have faded. Even those units that rolled back prices 
two or three years ago as part of market tests are still seeing double-digit 
growth in sales and transactions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's evident now that the price-value menu is creating sustainable sales," 
Murren said. 
</P>
<P>
PepsiCo's Strategy 
</P>
<P>
Taco Bell's price rollback strategy is very similar to what PepsiCo has done 
with its two other fast-food chains -- Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken, 
both of which are leaders in their market segments. 
</P>
<P>
Especially in the fast-growing pizza and Mexican segments, PepsiCo has taken 
products "that are very average and, with good pricing points and good 
advertising, established themselves at the top of people's minds for those 
products in most areas of the country," said Robert Bernstein, an analyst with 
Edward D. Jones &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, some analysts question whether Taco Bell will be able to continue 
racking up sales. "Growth is easier when you have a smaller base," said Pavlos 
M. Alexandrakis, an analyst with Argus Research. "Whether you can sustain sales 
depends on a lot of things -- will the market be tougher in five years? Yes, I 
think it will." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Taco Bell's best weapon -- discounted prices -- has alienated some of 
its franchisees. Lower prices mean that more customers are needed to maintain 
sales levels. And an increase in customers requires more be spent on labor and 
other expenses by the franchisees. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of franchisees are terribly concerned about bottom-line profits," 
complained one major California franchisee, who asked not to be identified. "At 
best, (franchisees') profits will be flat for most of this year and it appears 
the same for 1990." 
</P>
<P>
The price rollbacks probably lock Taco Bell into those rates for the immediate 
future. But Murren said it doesn't prohibit them from making "sneaky price 
increases," such as adding 5 cents to the price of a burrito, while keeping 
taco prices down. 
</P>
<P>
Breakfast Coming 
</P>
<P>
And the company has plenty of other ideas on its plate. One of the most 
promising is the introduction of a breakfast menu. The company plans to offer 
breakfast items, such as soft-shell tacos with various fillings, in early 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something we're thinking about," Martin said when asked about the 
long-range possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Taco Bell is also conducting ongoing research into consumer preferences, speedy 
delivery and quality control. 
</P>
<P>
The chain already is testing in about 300 restaurants a concept known as 
"K-Minus," meaning Kitchen Minus -- which means that much of Taco Bell's food 
preparation would be shifted to outside vendors. By buying already fried taco 
shells or cooked and seasoned ground beef, for example, Taco Bell restaurants 
can shave labor costs by no longer having to do their own chopping, dicing, 
cooking and seasoning. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the high-tech gadgets. Taco Bell -- like many of its competitors 
-- is tinkering with the possibility of machines that will take orders, wrap 
and bag tacos, and deliver orders to customers in about half the time and at 
about half the cost required by workers. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Omnitron. That's the gadget that Taco Bell plans to test in 
restaurants within 30 days; it will fill drinks more quickly, put lids on them 
and save 15 seconds per 32-ounce glass without spilling a drop. 
</P>
<P>
Changes are being considered for outside the restaurants as well. Martin talks 
of the eventual possibility of Taco Bell-labeled tortillas or salsa or the 
chain's burritos and tostadas being sold in office buildings, strip centers, 
malls, and even on turnpikes and at airports. 
</P>
<P>
With the new technology and the enormous financial and marketing muscle of 
PepsiCo, Martin insists that Taco Bell can win a much larger share of the 
fast-food market. He is so confident that he has set a new goal -- called 
"three-by-10," which aims for 10,000 U.S. restaurants, each with $3 million in 
sales, by the year 2001. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts say Martin's long-range objective is far-fetched. 
</P>
<P>
The three-by-10 goal "is unbelievable," analyst Bernstein said. "It would be 
like McDonald's doubling (sales) in those years. And Taco Bell isn't up to 
McDonald's (per store average) right now. . . . I wouldn't want to bet on 
whether or not they can do it." 
</P>
<P>
But Martin remains undeterred. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to keep doing what we're doing," he said. "All of PepsiCo today is 
a $10-billion company. We should pass that in another five years."

ONCE-THRIVING EMPIRE SAVINGS SEEKING FEDERAL HELP TO SURVIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Empire of America Federal Savings Bank, the nation's 12th largest savings 
institution by assets, grew quickly in the 1980s by gobbling up 13 failing 
S&amp;Ls with the support of federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Empire, a Buffalo, N.Y.-based concern that was seeking to expand across the 
country, bought S&amp;Ls in Texas, Florida, New York, Michigan and California. 
The California acquisitions were to serve as a springboard for a major push 
into the state by Empire, which set up local headquarters in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
But now it's Empire that needs support -- lots of it. Saddled with major losses 
stemming from its acquisitions, the $10.3-billion (assets) thrift recently said 
it is insolvent and is looking for federal help to survive. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 28, Empire announced that its stockholders' equity -- that is, the 
amount of its assets minus its liabilities, or net worth -- had vanished 
because of the thrift's ongoing losses. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its problems, Empire noted that customers' deposits, up to $100,000 per 
account, remain insured by the U.S. government. Thus far regulators have not 
seized Empire as part of the recently enacted federal savings-and-loan bailout 
program, which is being overseen by a new agency called the Resolution Trust 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government might provide Empire with the necessary money to stay in 
business; then again, Empire might eventually be seized by the government or 
merged with another institution instead. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is business as usual at Empire's 17 branches in California, 
including those in Fountain Valley, Costa Mesa and Irvine, said Jeffrey M. 
Reinhardt, division marketing officer for Empire's California unit. 
</P>
<P>
The offices in Fountain Valley and Irvine were picked up when S&amp;L 
regulators sold the insolvent Equitable Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine to Empire 
in March, 1987. Equitable also had an office in Bellflower, which Empire 
operates. The Costa Mesa office was converted to an S&amp;L from a branch of 
Empire's Pacific Thrift &amp; Loan subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
As for Empire's 125 workers in California, there is "no change in their 
status," Reinhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
In the nine months ended Sept. 30, Empire lost $209.3 million, after losing 
$57.3 million for all of 1988. The red ink wiped out its capital, leaving it 
with $53.5 million more in liabilities than assets. 
</P>
<P>
What went wrong? Empire tried to expand its banking empire in a hurry by buying 
sickly S&amp;Ls, and in doing so it ran into a growing problem with the 
accounting rules governing takeovers. As Empire bought these S&amp;Ls, it found 
that the S&amp;Ls' liabilities -- which mostly consist of deposits and so can 
be withdrawn at any time -- exceeded the value of the S&amp;Ls' assets by $926 
million. 
</P>
<P>
To make its accounts balance, Empire added $926 million of "good will" to its 
assets. In accounting, good will is a non-cash asset, yet it must be written 
off, or amortized, over a number of years as a charge against the company's 
income. So every year, Empire found that good will was draining $95 million to 
$110 million from its profit. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Empire was unable to generate enough earnings from its 
operations to offset the "good-will drag," as Empire calls it. And the 
resulting losses steadily eroded Empire's net worth. 
</P>
<P>
Empire's descent into insolvency was not unexpected, however. In July, when the 
company reported a second-quarter loss of $54.2 million, it said continuing 
losses would eat up its net worth by the end of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Empire had asked the federal government in February for $900 million to 
overcome the problems stemming from its purchase of the troubled thrifts. 
Empire said that if the government came through with that support, Empire's 
investment banker, Drexel Burnham Lambert, hoped to raise an additional $675 
million from private investors. 
</P>
<P>
The cash infusions then would have enabled Empire to meet new, stricter capital 
minimums required under the new S&amp;L legislation. In general, capital 
reflects the net worth of an S&amp;L, and the tougher capital requirements are 
meant to strengthen the thrifts' cushion against future losses. 
</P>
<P>
Empire's initial plea for cash was made to the Federal Savings and Loan 
Insurance Corp., but that agency was abolished under the S&amp;L bailout plan. 
So on Sept. 20, Empire filed a new application for aid with the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp., which is helping direct the bailout program. 
</P>
<P>
In its latest application, Empire did not list the dollar amount it needs. 
Carol G. Corr, an Empire senior vice president, said the exact amount would 
depend on when the government decided to help. At that point, all of Empire's 
assets would be rechecked for their current market value, and then the amount 
would be established, she said. 
</P>
<P>
There is no guarantee, however, that the government will step in. 
</P>
<P>
But Corr said Empire does not regret its move into California. 
</P>
<P>
"I could not say we're sorry we went into California or Texas or Florida," she 
said. At the time, the mergers "were then appropriate and made sense," but 
since then "a lot of things have happened to change the value of the mergers. 
I'm certain there are no regrets." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE O.C. ANGLE 
</P>
<P>
Empire has 17 branches in California, including those in Costa Mesa, Fountain 
Valley and Irvine. The latter two were acquired in the March, 1987, sale by 
federal regulators of the insolvent Equitable Savings &amp; Loan, based in 
Irvine. Equitable also had an office in Bellflower, which Empire operates.

MEASURING THE MAGNITUDE OF DESTRUCTION

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bay Area quake was only about one-tenth as powerful as the great quake 
expected to hit Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The magnitude of an earthquake is primarily based on the amount of energy 
released by the temblor. It is a logarithmic scale, and each point represents a 
tenfold increase, so an 8.1 quake releases 10 times the energy of a 7.1 quake 
-- the magnitude of the Bay-Area quake. A 9.1 quake, which would be among the 
greatest quakes ever measured, would be 100 times more powerful. 
</P>
<P>
But the magnitude is a measurement of energy at the epicenter of the quake, and 
that is only one component of the destructive process. Equally important is the 
intensity of ground shaking and that depends on the distance from the quake, 
the type of rupture and local geology. Generally, the closer to the quake the 
greater the danger, but loose, saturated soils many miles farther away may 
experience much greater ground shaking than closer rock formations.

NEWPORT-INGLEWOOD FAULT; 
</P>
<P>
GEOLOGISTS PLOT A SCENARIO FOR A 7.0 MAGNITUDE QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This map and the one on the following two pages are from earthquake scenarios 
drawn up by the state Division of Mines and Geology. The first, prepared in 
1988, shows in general terms what might occur in various areas if there was a 
7.0-magnitude quake in the Newport-Inglewood Fault Zone in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. The second, drawn up in 1982, examines the possible impact of 
an 8.3-magnitude earthquake on the San Andreas Fault near Tejon. The maps are 
hypothetical and are not intended to predict that such earthquakes will 
actually occur. It is highly unlikely that a big earthquake, when it does come 
in Southern California, will conform to either of these specific scenarios. 
Even if it did, there would probably be variations from the intensities 
portrayed in these maps. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the scenarios are useful for assessing the possible impact of a major 
temblor. Authors of the Newport-Inglewood Fault scenario describe their work as 
"a possible worst case for emergency planning" and, in discussing their 
purpose, remark, "Hopefully, increased awareness of specific damage effects 
will stimulate regional planning programs to cope with this eventuality." 
</P>
<P>
In both scenarios, the authors were modest in assessing the reliability of 
their maps showing shaking intensities for specific neighborhoods expected from 
such temblors. A prominently displayed warning in each scenario booklets 
declares: "An earthquake of significantly different magnitude on this or any 
one of many other faults in the planning area will result in a markedly 
different pattern of damage." 
</P>
<P>
The Newport-Inglewood scenario shows that a 7.0-magnitude earthquake centered 
within the Los Angeles-Orange County metropolitan area would be more 
destructive than an 8.3-magnitude earthquake centered on the San Andreas 40 or 
more miles away. The only areas excepted from the worst impact would be the 
Palos Verdes peninsula, the Santa Monica Mountains and portions of the Verdugo 
Hills and the San Gabriel Mountains. These areas would experience shaking 
levels slightly lower than in flatter areas. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the San Andreas, much less is known about the intervals between 
major earthquakes on the Newport-Inglewood Fault. The lead author of the 
Newport-Inglewood earthquake scenario, Tousson R. Toppozada, acknowledges that 
scientific convenience, rather than hard information about the likelihood of a 
big earthquake, was responsible for choosing that fault for the 1988 scenario. 
</P>
<P>
"We already had a scenario for the San Andreas Fault, and we were looking for a 
fault that was more urban," Toppozada said. "The Newport-Inglewood Fault is the 
largest in the Los Angeles area. There are others, the Santa 
Monica-Hollywood-Raymond Hill fault systems, that are active, and we have no 
special knowledge that would bring us to fear an imminent quake on the 
Inglewood-Newport. But it has given us a 6 1/4 in the past, and none of the 
others have given us a 6 yet." 
</P>
<P>
At least, Toppozada added, the scientists at the Division of Mines and Geology 
felt that "this (Newport-Inglewood) scenario would give the sort of impacts 
that would occur in the downtown (Los Angeles) area from whichever source a 
major earthquake on a local fault would come."

GEOLOGISTS PLOT A SCENARIO FOR A 8.3 MAGNITUDE QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This map, from a 1982 scenario prepared by the state Division of Mines and 
Geology, provides a hypothetical look at the degree of ground shaking and 
ground failure that might result from an 8.3 magnitude temblor along the San 
Andreas Fault. It would be equivalent to the greatest earthquake ever recorded 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
The scenario's authors chose the San Andreas Fault because it is the longest, 
most famous fault in the state. It also produced the last 8 magnitude 
earthquake in Southern California, centered at Fort Tejon, between Los Angeles 
and Bakersfield, in 1857. 
</P>
<P>
In putting the epicenter of the scenario's 8.3 earthquake also at Ft. Tejon, 
</P>
<P>
the scientists at the Division of Mines and Geology chose a spot on the fault 
close to the Los Angeles metropolitan area that would presumably cause the 
greatest shaking in that area. But they may have opted for something less than 
a most-likely outcome, according to two leading Caltech seismologists. 
</P>
<P>
Hiroo Kanamori notes that most earthquake scientists believe the next "Big One" 
on the San Andreas in Southern California is likely to occur further east, in 
the Coachella Valley. The epicenter's greater distance from -- and different 
orientation to -- the Los Angeles area would likely produce less shaking 
intensities than shown in the map. 
</P>
<P>
And a second scientist, Kerry Sieh, said it is "very unlikely" such a temblor 
would occur in the Ft. Tejon area soon. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have calculated a theoretical average interval of about 130 years 
for quakes in the area. But Sieh found that since about 700 AD only one quake 
had actually occurred according to that timetable. That's because the quakes 
have tended to be bunched in twos or threes fairly close in time, with 
intervals of 250 or 300 years separating the clusters, Sieh said. 
</P>
<P>
If an 8 magnitude earthquake were to occur on the fault segment which is the 
focus of the San Andreas scenario, it would unquestionably be a serious event 
in the Los Angeles area, resulting in "significant interruption of ground 
transportation, communications, water supply, sewage treatment, electricity and 
pipeline distribution of natural gas and petroleum," according to the scenario. 
</P>

considerable damage to poorly built or badly designed buildings. Considerable 
fall of plaster and window breakage.

buildings,

HOW TO REACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If an earthquake strikes and you are . . . 
</P>
<P>
In your home: Do not run outside (most earthquake-related injuries happen 
outdoors). Get away from windows, mirrors and light fixtures. Watch out for 
tall bookcases or china cases that might topple. Climb under a table or desk or 
stand in a doorway if possible. If this isn't possible, crouch against a solid 
wall. Get into a duck-and-cover position, using sofa cushions or pillows to 
protect your head. 
</P>
<P>
In a car: Pull to the side of the road (if possible) and stop the car. Do not 
attempt to continue driving. Do not park under trees, light posts or signs. Do 
not park on or under a bridge. Stay inside your car and get down on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
In an office: Get under your desk or in a doorway if possible. If not, crouch 
against a solid wall and protect your head with what is available, such as a 
book, notebook, large handbag, suit coat or briefcase. Many offices have fake 
drop-ceiling tiles that are easily shaken loose by quakes, so protecting your 
head with something is a must. 
</P>
<P>
In a mall/store: Get away from glass store fronts. Do not head for the exits, 
most of which are glass. Crouch against a solid wall. If you have children, put 
them against the wall and drape yourself over them in a crouching position. 
Make as small a target as possible. Do not attempt to use escalators or 
elevators. 
</P>
<P>
In an elevator: Most elevators will automatically stop moving when the shaking 
starts. When the quake stops, stomp on the floor in an attempt to get someone 
to hear you. If possible, escape through the trapdoor at the top of the 
elevator, since there is a danger of fire. 
</P>
<P>
 In a restaurant: The safest place is under the table, since table-tops are 
made of sturdy material. Do not attempt to run across the restaurant if you are 
at a table or booth near the windows -- climb under the table and protect your 
head. Many restaurants have objects on the walls that could fly across the 
room, so climbing under your own table is the best bet. 
</P>
<P>
In a high-rise building: Climb under a desk or stand in a doorway. Stay clear 
of windows, shelves, cabinets and glass partitions. Most high-rises are built 
so they will sway with a quake more than you would think, but it is actually a 
protection to keep them from toppling. Do not run for the exit because the 
stairways may be broken and/or jammed with people. Do not attempt to use the 
elevator since the power may have failed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a parking garage: Do not run. Crouch against a pillar or solid wall, 
covering your head with your purse, jacket or shopping bags. If in your car, do 
not attempt to drive. Stay in the car and get down on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
In school: Each school is required by the state to have an 
earthquake-preparedness plan and to have practiced earthquake drills. Children 
should climb under their desks and cover their heads, and move away from 
windows if at all possible. The school can provide a copy of its earthquake 
plans to any parent wishing to see it. 
</P>
<P>
In a hospital: Every hospital accredited by the Joint Commission of Hospital 
Accreditation is required to have an earthquake response plan and practice 
periodic drills. If you are a patient, you should ask what to do in the event 
of an earthquake, especially if you are hooked up to an intravenous bottle or 
other medical equipment. Also ask the hospital personnel what their evacuation 
plan is. 
</P>
<P>
Outdoors/in a rural area: Get to where there are the fewest possible hazards 
from above -- away froms trees, power poles, light posts, etc. Flying debris is 
what usually hurts people, so the fewer objects that are around you the better. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mountains: If possible, get away from trees and rocks and into the 
brush, which will catch some of the flying debris. Crouch and cover your head 
with your pack or whatever else is handy. Steer clear of boulders, which can be 
jarred loose by the quake. Be aware that trails may be wiped out. 
</P>
<P>
On the beach: Stay put during the actual quake -- there are very few dangers on 
the actual beach during a quake. When the shaking stops, get off the beach 
because a tsunami (a wall of water that can measure up to 40 feet) may have 
been triggered. Grab essentials and go to the parking lot. Remember to put on 
shoes, because there may be a lot of broken glass.
