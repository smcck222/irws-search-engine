Eliot Porter, 88, a color photography pioneer best known for his large-format 
books published by the Sierra Club. Porter was first recognized for his 
photographs of birds, and perhaps best known for "Birds of North America -- A 
Personal Selection." 
</P>
<P>
Two books featuring his work, "Mexican Celebration" and "Nature's Chaos," were 
released last week. It was while in the field photographing birds that he first 
became interested in the plant formations and land all about him. He went on to 
illustrate such books as "The Flow of Wildness," about the Galapagos Islands, 
and "The Tree Where Man Was Born," about Africa. Porter, whose work was 
exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, donated hundreds 
of prints to the University of New Mexico and the Fine Arts Museum in Santa Fe. 
He took his last photograph in 1986, the year his illness was diagnosed as Lou 
Gehrig's disease. On Friday in Santa Fe, N.M.

POOL IS NOW OPEN; TRUNKS REQUIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Connie was the first to test the waters, delicately dipping the tip of her 
trunk into the murky water, much as a person might wet a toe to check the 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
She trumpeted loudly. Then, finally, Connie took the plunge. 
</P>
<P>
She was the bravest of the San Diego Wild Animal Park's seven female Asian 
elephants, which edged up cautiously to their plush new pool shortly after 
being released into the compound Monday. The pool is designed to provide a more 
aesthetic and natural environment, as well as to get the pachyderms exercising 
more. 
</P>
<P>
"Nita we would have expected to go in right away because she's the dominant 
elephant, and she's usually the one who goes trying something out before others 
will," said Tom Hanscom, spokesman for the park. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Nita and the others took turns getting wet, only to fling dirt on 
themselves with their trunks once they got out. 
</P>
<P>
"Elephants, when they get wet, they get itchy," elephant program manager Alan 
Roocroft explained. 
</P>
<P>
A boulder placed in a clearing in the compound is at a height just right for 
them to scratch their undersides after a swim, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The $100,000 Asian elephant pool, which opens to the public today, has been 
five months in the making and is the first step toward bringing patrons within 
arm's length of the floppy-eared beasts at the park near Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
It replaces an older, smaller pool and is similar in size to one built for the 
African elephants in a neighboring compound. 
</P>
<P>
The park hopes to eventually build a deck reaching to the edge of the wading 
pool and to plant grass in parts of the compound, which now is mostly dirt. 
</P>
<P>
The pool and the compound, which includes boulders and ficus and bamboo trees, 
was designed for the convenience and health of the elephants, park employees 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A collage of boulders, some of them weighing 6 tons, were placed in a pattern 
that makes it impossible for them to be dislodged. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like a jigsaw puzzle," Roocroft said. "We want them to be able to 
get to them and use them as scratching posts, but obviously we don't want them 
to be moving them. Given the right terrain, though, they could move those rocks 
quite easily." 
</P>
<P>
The elephants did succeed in rocking one of the boulders forward, but could not 
pull it out. 
</P>
<P>
The pool gives the elephants a chance to swim, something they couldn't do in 
their old pool. 
</P>
<P>
"Elephants don't move normally in captivity, and you've got to find ways to get 
them to exercise," Roocroft said. 
</P>
<P>
The pool, which is 9 feet deep and has two entrances, is deep enough to put the 
8-foot-tall elephants through a healthy workout and is designed to accommodate 
their social structure. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were to build a pool with just one entrance, you may have a dominant 
animal at the entrance keeping a sub-dominant one in or out of the pool," 
Roocroft said.

DOLPHIN WON'T BE TRADED TO NAVY

Yielding to pressure from animal rights activists, the New England Aquarium on 
Monday dropped plans to trade an aggressive dolphin to the Navy's dolphin 
training program in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The move settled a federal lawsuit filed last month by Citizens to End Animal 
Suffering and Exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
The group, which sought to block the trade, claims the Navy trains dolphins for 
hazardous duty. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the aquarium arranged to trade Rainbow, an 11-year-old, 
450-pound male, to the Naval Oceans Systems Research Center in San Diego for a 
partly deaf female dolphin. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy center said it trains and studies marine mammals in underwater 
surveillance and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
The aquarium decided to resolve the dispute by agreeing with the Navy to end 
the deal, aquarium director John Prescott said. 
</P>
<P>
"We agreed publicly to take a second look at alternative facilities, and we've 
done so in good faith," Prescott said. 
</P>
<P>
The aquarium wanted to find a new home for Rainbow because he had become 
incompatible with its other show dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the settlement, the aquarium also asked the U.S.Department of 
Commerce to speed up the process regulating transfer of marine mammals between 
licensed facilities.

It didn't start out as a big night for Chaminade High place kicker Amy Cook. 
</P>
<P>
She had a field goal attempt blocked in the first half. "We didn't block for 
her very well," said coach Richard Lawson. 
</P>
<P>
But things picked up. At halftime, the 5-foot-6-inch senior changed into a gown 
and was crowned homecoming queen of the San Fernando Valley school. 
</P>
<P>
Then Cook changed back into her other outfit and kicked a point after 
touchdown, her seventh this year. 
</P>
<P>
Public address announcer Alan Mitchell noted: "That may have been the first 
extra point by a homecoming queen." 
</P>
<P>
The West L.A. Veloway was displayed -- complete with artist's conception -- in 
a recent USA Today bicycling feature, which said that construction on the 
pathway for commuting peddlers "could begin next year." 
</P>
<P>
"It's news to us," said a spokesman for Supervisor Ed Edelman, a member of the 
County Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Urban planner Ryan Snyder, the Veloway's chief advocate, says 1993 is a more 
realistic goal -- environmental impact statements haven't even been submitted 
yet. But a crucial factor in this budget-strapped era is that at least $6 
million must be found to finance the 2.5-mile route. 
</P>
<P>
The Southland has been without a veloway since 1900, when 600 bicyclists 
inaugurated the Dobbins Elevated Cycleway. Originally planned as a 
Pasadena-L.A. route, it was abandoned a few months later after about a mile had 
been completed. Before the cycleway's demise, it was also tested by a Stanley 
Steamer, which hit a stupefying speed of 25 m.p.h. That evidently gave 
elevated-road planners another idea. 
</P>
<P>
The term-limitation measures on the ballot inspired Val Rodriguez of Signal 
Hill to send us a recent vacation photo he took of Throw-the-Rascals-Out-Street 
in Ciudad Obregon, Mexico. No Reeleccion was a slogan of the Mexican 
Revolution, referring to crooked elections of the regime of dictator Porfirio 
Diaz. 
</P>
<P>
An anti-growth group in San Diego, which is opposing two measures on that 
area's ballot, goes by the acronym of PLAN. That's short for Prevent Los 
Angelization Now.

May they take a long ride on a short veloway.

A $17,500 reward for information leading to the recovery of three pieces of 
pre-Columbian art that were stolen from Mingei International Museum of World 
Folk Art is being offered by the insurance company that underwrites the 
exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based Cigna Insurance Co. put up the reward in the hope that it 
would yield information in an investigation that has gone cold, said William F. 
Smith, a representative for the company who works solely with fine arts. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the San Diego Police Department and the FBI still have no 
leads in the Oct. 23 theft, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The reward is about 10% of the estimated $175,000 value of the stolen 
artifacts, Smith said. It applies only if all three pieces are returned, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The three pieces -- a terra cotta vase dated AD 750-800, and two sculptures -- 
were part of an exhibition at the Mingei entitled, "Pre-Columbian Flora and 
Fauna: Continuity of Plant and Animal Themes in Mesoamerican Art." The show 
opened Sept. 30 and will run through mid-February.

<P>
Two men accused of severely beating San Diego Charger Joe Phillips on Sept. 26 
pleaded not guilty to felony assault charges Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Brett J. Dost and Scott E. Stewart made their pleas before Municipal Judge 
Michael B. Orfield, who ordered the defendants taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the "senseless and brutal nature of this crime," Orfield set bail for 
Dost at $30,000 because of his prior contacts with police, and he set bail for 
Stewart at $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
Dost, 21, and Stewart, 24, face one felony charge each of assault with force 
likely to produce great bodily injury and battery intended to produce great 
bodily injury, and one misdemeanor charge of malicious mischief. 
</P>
<P>
The two men -- along with David Hanna, 22, who is free on $20,000 bail after 
pleading not guilty last week -- are accused of beating 27-year-old Phillips 
outside a Mission Beach restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Mark Pettine said Phillips, a defensive lineman and 
five-year NFL veteran, was beaten so badly that a doctor could not tell how 
many fractures there were in Phillips' face. The beating was "one of the worst 
he's ever seen," Pettine reported. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips underwent surgery for some of his injuries. It is not known if he will 
be able to play again this season. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police after the attack that the assailants made a remark to a 
woman accompanying Phillips that led to a confrontation, which erupted into a 
brawl. Phillips reported to police that at least one of his attackers kicked 
him with steel-toed boots while he was on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Pettine said there is a "history of violence in Mr. Dost's past," and he is on 
probation in a drug case. The prosecutor told the judge that a man involved in 
another altercation with Dost suffered a broken jaw and other injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Orfield set a preliminary hearing for Nov. 20, when the three cases are 
expected to be consolidated.

2 HELD AFTER CHULA VISTA SIEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chula Vista police arrested two brothers Monday after an hours-long standoff 
during which officers lobbed tear gas canisters into a house and bombarded it 
with noise from a bullhorn and loudspeaker. 
</P>
<P>
After refusing to leave the house for several hours, one of the two brothers -- 
both self-employed in a rock 'n' roll band -- surrendered to police Monday 
morning. About five hours later, officers found the other brother in the attic 
of the house. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Thomas, 28, and Charles Thomas, 22, were being held Monday night at the 
County Jail in Chula Vista. Police said they believe one of them fired a gun 
from the house late Sunday night and wounded Barry J. Samples, 26. 
</P>
<P>
Samples and Fred I. Jewett, another Chula Vista man, had gone to the rear of 
the house, in the 400 block of Nickman Street, about 11 p.m. Sunday, officers 
said, intending to steal marijuana plants growing in the yard but were met with 
three shots from the house, one of which hit Samples in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
After taking to Samples at Scripps Memorial Hospital in Chula Vista early 
Monday morning, officers arranged for a search warrant for the house. 
</P>
<P>
SWAT team members arrived at the house at 9 a.m. and were told a couple of 
minutes later by phone that the two men inside did not intend to leave nor to 
let officers in to search, police said. 
</P>
<P>
For the next couple of hours, officers fired several tear gas canisters into 
the house, police said. At 11:30 a.m., Charles Thomas left the house and was 
taken into custody, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
For the next several hours, officers fired aimed a bullhorn and loudspeaker at 
the house, broadcasting a message to surrender. About 3:45 p.m., officers fired 
more tear gas and stormed the house, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve minutes later, officers said, they found Bill Thomas in the attic. 
</P>
<P>
Samples underwent surgery and was in UC San Diego Medical Center on Monday 
night..

When all we hear is needing more funds for the homeless, overtime for the

TEACHING ABSTINENCE TO PREVENT AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is hard to argue with the concept of sexual abstinence as the most important 
means of preventing AIDS, but to insist on celibacy as the only formula for 
teaching teen-agers about this dread disease indicates a tenuous grip on 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
True enough, celibacy will absolutely prevent all sexually transmitted 
diseases, but that begs the question of how to handle those who can't seem to 
resist the raging torrent of adolescent hormones. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose this same group of parents would prohibit teaching about the dangers 
of drunk driving because, after all, their sons and daughters will obviously 
not imbibe before the age of 21.

L.A. ASSISTANCE FOR LENINGRAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As I look out of the window of the Criminal Courts Building in Los Angeles, I 
am reminded of the myriad problems facing the city: dirty air, crime, filthy 
streets, homelessness, poverty and depression in South-Central Los Angeles. Yet 
Mayor Bradley wants to render assistance to the city of Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
Come on, Mr. Mayor, you are the mayor of Los Angeles. You were elected to serve 
the people of the city. Your record in South-Central Los Angeles is 
disgraceful. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Mayor, help your own fellow Americans. The homeless need shelter, the 
people in South-Central L.A. need supermarkets with competitive prices, more 
police are needed, homes in South-Central need to be upgraded and the Civic 
Center is a blighted area, not worthy of a major city. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Mayor, you were put into office to serve the people of Los Angeles, not to 
conduct self-serving foreign aid. Leave that to the federal government.

TALK WITH THE BRUTE, OR IT'S WAR UNKNOWN; 
</P>
<P>
DIRECT DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND IRAQ ARE THE ONLY HOPE FOR A BLOODLESS 
SOLUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD GOODWIN, Richard N. Goodwin, who was an assistant special counsel to 
President John F. Kennedy and a special assistant to President Lyndon B. 
Johnson, is a writer and commentator in Concord, Mass. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"If World War III ever starts," Robert F. Kennedy once told me, "it won't start 
suddenly. Each side will take an action to which the other side will feel 
compelled to respond as a matter of prestige and credibility. Finally we will 
reach the point where it seems the only choice is who shall strike first. And 
that will be the end of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Although the stakes are smaller, we seem to have painted ourselves into just 
this kind of a corner in the uninhabitable sands of the Middle East. And in a 
travesty of democracy, a violation of the Constitution, the decision -- whether 
or not to go to war -- seems to reside solely within the modestly intelligent 
but very stubborn mind of George Bush. Congress has once again abdicated its 
responsibility to decide and debate questions of war and peace, preferring to 
leave the issues to the secret councils of an enigmatic executive power. 
</P>
<P>
Of course Saddam Hussein is a nasty, brutal and even dangerous leader. His 
conquest of Kuwait was a totally unjustified aggression. But it is done. We 
failed to take immediate action, and preferred to assemble massive forces 
giving Iraq time to expand and entrench its defenses. Now we must decide 
whether to attack Iraq, a course which will almost certainly -- although 
nothing is certain in war -- result in tens of thousands of casualties and 
whose outcome cannot be foreseen. 
</P>
<P>
Writing about the Civil War, Bruce Catton stated, "A singular fact about modern 
war is that it takes charge. Once it has begun it has to be carried to its 
conclusion, and carrying it there sets in motion events that may be beyond 
men's control." 
</P>
<P>
This truth was brutally reconfirmed for the United States in North Korea and in 
Vietnam. There is no foreseeable end to a war in Iraq. Even should Kuwait be 
retaken we will have to continue the fighting across the Iraqi border until we 
conquer that country also, or at least destroy its leadership. That conflict 
will almost certainly involve Israeli entry into the battle, and the 
participation of other countries -- a melange of combatants with widely 
different interests. There is no way to predict the final outcome, except that 
it will be bloody, destructive and costly enough to weaken severely an already 
declining American economy. 
</P>
<P>
Is there, then, no way out from so conjectural and potentially disastrous a 
course? There can be no certainty about the answer. But one thing is certain, 
we are failing -- abysmally, unconscionably -- to pursue alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
It seems self-evident that direct talks between the United States and Hussein 
offer the only hope for a peaceful solution. One recalls our unwillingness to 
negotiate with Hanoi because "it would constitute a recognition of their 
importance as a belligerent." Of course talks with Hanoi might not have 
affected the course of the war. And discussion with Hussein might be futile. 
But to accept military action as the only possibility almost guarantees a 
bloody and uncertain conflagration. 
</P>
<P>
Along with negotiations, we should make it clear that we intend to defend Saudi 
Arabia. As for Kuwait, some kind of compromise is inevitable. It is not in the 
national interest of the United States to begin a large-scale military conflict 
in order to return every inch of Kuwaiti soil to the small, affluent oligarchy 
that ruled that country. At the same time we should continue and strengthen 
sanctions as part of the effort to persuade Hussein that his interest, too, 
lies in a peaceful resolution. 
</P>
<P>
If George Bush launches a war without having exhausted every possibility of a 
peaceful accommodation, he will have the blood of thousands on his hands. 
Moreover, he will have accelerated the now obvious decline of the American 
economy and of American ability to help maintain world order. No American 
interest -- whether it is the protection of our allies or the free flow of oil 
-- is jeopardized by a patient and perhaps long-sustained effort to arrive at a 
non-military resolution. Unless, of course, our hidden purpose is to destroy 
Hussein and his war machine. But to embark on a deliberate effort to obliterate 
them will cause enormous damage to the United States -- in lives, in money and 
in a further diminution of the ideals that are the bonds of the Republic. 
</P>
<P>
For the half century since World War II, we confronted a far more dangerous foe 
than Iraq. We did not go to war. Instead our policy was containment. And it 
worked. The same type of policy in the Middle East is certainly worth a try. Of 
course, that calls for patient endurance. The boys won't be home by Christmas. 
But if it does succeed, they will be home alive.

<TEXT>
<P>
Many minorities are unfamiliar and sometimes uncomfortable with the cultural 
values and norms of corporations -- and few are given the opportunity to learn 
and adjust. Traditional methods that corporations use to find, recruit and 
prepare people for management will not be adequate considering the changing 
demographics of the work force. 
</P>
<P>
It's imperative, therefore, that corporations supplement current training and 
recruiting methods. 
</P>
<P>
It behooves companies to act early and hire promising minority high school 
seniors and college students for summer positions. It's an opportunity to groom 
them for future full-time employment. It's also an opportunity to introduce 
them to the corporate culture -- an environment that must be understood if one 
is to become a leader. 
</P>
<P>
It's incumbent on companies to make investments in people now. It's a matter of 
self-interest.

DON'T RUSH INTO FOLLY IN THE GULF; 
</P>
<P>
THERE ARE NO COMPELLING ARGUMENTS FOR STARTING A WAR WITHOUT CONGRESSIONAL 
CONSENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The beat of Persian Gulf war drums has suddenly become very loud. Reiterating 
that Saddam Hussein is another Hitler, the Administration is now hinting that 
the mistreatment of U.S. hostages in Iraq and Kuwait will be used as a pretext 
for war. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is again sliding inexorably into a war the Congress has not 
sanctioned. Since 1945, American Presidents have committed U.S. troops to two 
major wars (Korea and Vietnam) and a host of lesser conflicts (most recently 
Panama, Grenada and Lebanon) without asking Congress to declare war. Dusting 
off the imperial presidency's supposed prerogatives, the Bush Administration 
has categorically refused to promise that it will seek congressional 
authorization before initiating hostilities against Iraq. Congress should act 
now -- before it is too late -- and prohibit the use of U.S. forces in 
offensive actions against Iraq unless Congress expressly approves. 
</P>
<P>
By making the President commander in chief while reserving to Congress the 
power to declare war and ratify treaties, the Framers issued -- in 
constitutional scholar Edward S. Corwin's oft-quoted observation -- an 
invitation for the two branches to struggle for supremacy in conducting foreign 
policy. Nevertheless, until the end of World War II, it was clearly understood 
that a President could not commit U.S. forces to a major conflict without the 
consent of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The Cold War's exigencies upset the delicate constitutional balance. To meet 
the perceived communist threat in a world that was viewed as bipolar both 
geopolitically and ideologically, the United States became a national security 
state -- permanently mobilized for war in order to contain communism worldwide. 
Executive-branch authority increased dramatically while congressional power 
eroded (and, to a large degree, was abdicated voluntarily). In a nuclear world, 
it was said, the President needed a free hand to respond quickly to global 
crises. 
</P>
<P>
In the Persian Gulf crisis, however, there are no compelling arguments for 
allowing the Administration to start a war without first obtaining 
congressional consent. Americans and their elected representatives have the 
time to debate Washington's Persian Gulf policy, a debate too important to be 
left to street demonstrations staged by aging 1960s radicals. The Persian Gulf 
crisis is not a Cold War superpower confrontation with all the possibilities of 
sudden escalation to the nuclear level that such a clash could entail. There is 
no imminent danger to America's territorial integrity, to its physical and 
economic security or even to the global balance of power. Thus, none of the 
conditions cited during the Cold War as support for unconstrained presidential 
authority to use the military apply in this case. This crisis has dragged on 
more than three months, and there is time to reflect before making the fateful 
decision for war in the gulf, a conflict that may not end quickly and will 
assuredly cost many American lives. 
</P>
<P>
A sober assessment of U.S. policy objectives in the gulf is needed. Will 
vanquishing Iraq really bring stability to that perennially volatile region? 
Will the anti-Iraq coalition hold together if the United States strikes Iraq 
first? What impact will an American-initiated war have on moderate Arab 
governments -- and on Arab populations? How will Washington's policy affect 
U.S.-Israeli relations? 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the issues pertinent to the immediate crisis, Bush's whole notion of a 
"new world order" needs to be scrutinized. In the post-Cold War era, it is far 
from clear that America must remain the world's policeman, or that it can 
afford to do so. In this sense, the Persian Gulf crisis provides the 
opportunity for a new, full-scale "Great Debate" about America's purposes and 
world role. 
</P>
<P>
Wars are easy to start but often difficult to end. Thus the hard questions -- 
the nature of America's security interests, the feasibility of Washington's 
objectives and the relationship of military means to policy ends must be asked 
before the shooting starts. 
</P>
<P>
In its historic 1966 hearings, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee asked the 
right questions about U.S. policy in Vietnam. But it was too late to halt the 
march of folly in Southeast Asia, because vast numbers of American troops had 
already been committed to combat. Congress should not make that mistake again. 
Morally and constitutionally, it is time for Congress to assert its 
foreign-policy prerogatives -- especially the power to declare war -- in the 
Persian Gulf crisis.

ALLEGED COURIER FOR SILBERMAN GETS PROBATION; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: BANKER JACK NORMAN MYERS, WHO TESTIFIED IN MONEY-LAUNDERING CASE OF 
SILBERMAN AND PETTI, AVOIDS JAIL IN PLEA BARGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Malibu investment banker accused of being a courier in a money-laundering 
scheme directed by San Diego financier Richard T. Silberman was sentenced 
Monday to probation for his role in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Norman Myers, 44, who testified against Silberman -- and against Chris 
Petti, who also was indicted in the case -- was sentenced to three years' 
probation by U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving. Under a plea bargain, 
Myers admitted violating one of the six felony counts on which he was indicted, 
then testified against Silberman and Petti. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Silberman, Myers did not receive a prison sentence. Prosecutors 
originally said they would recommend no more than six months in custody, but 
said Monday they had decided to urge probation because Myers had cooperated 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
Irving also ordered Myers to forfeit $12,000, the funds prosecutors contend 
that Myers earned on the two laundering deals in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 61, who served as a top aide to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., was 
sentenced Sept. 24 by Irving to 46 months in federal prison and, on Oct. 2, was 
fined $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
According to prosecutors, Silberman directed a scheme to launder $300,000 that 
an undercover FBI agent portrayed as the profits of Colombian cocaine dealing. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman was convicted June 28, after a two-month trial, of a technical 
currency violation. On Aug. 24, he pleaded guilty under a plea bargain to a 
felony conspiracy count, averting a second trial. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Irving rejected Silberman's novel request for a week off from 
prison. Silberman's lawyers argued that the financier had been negligent in not 
preparing for the possibility of a conviction and prison, and needed time to 
arrange affairs with his wife -- San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding -- 
and family. 
</P>
<P>
Myers pleaded guilty in May to a sole felony count of violating a federal 
currency law. Prosecutors dropped five other charges against him after he 
agreed to testify against Silberman and Petti. 
</P>
<P>
Myers was accused of delivering FBI agent Peter J. Ahearn's cash to Ventura 
County investment broker Terry Ziegler and setting up the mechanics of the two 
deals in the case with him. 
</P>
<P>
The first deal was a November 1988, exchange of $100,000 for stock in a 
Silberman gold-mining subsidiary. The second was a February, 1989, exchange of 
$200,000 for U.S. Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
According to Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr., the lead prosecutor in 
the case, Myers pocketed $4,000 on the first deal and $8,000 on the second. 
</P>
<P>
Gorder said he was pleased with Myers' sentence. "He cooperated fully with the 
government, and I believe he testified truthfully," Gorder said. 
</P>
<P>
Myers' attorney, Michael Lightfoot of Los Angeles, also said the sentence was 
just. "He made himself available and cooperated, and it was a fair sentence," 
Lightfoot said. 
</P>
<P>
Myers declined Monday to comment on the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Petti, 63, of San Diego, who introduced Silberman to Ahearn, was convicted Oct. 
23 of six felony counts in the case, though Irving said he was a "pawn" in the 
scheme. He could draw up to 75 years in federal prison and is due to be 
sentenced Dec. 17 by Irving. 
</P>
<P>
Ziegler, 45, of Moorpark in Ventura County, pleaded guilty April 10 to a sole 
felony count, admitting that he violated a federal currency law. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 4, Ziegler is scheduled to stand trial on whether he, too, earned any 
money on the two deals that prosecutors believe should be forfeited to the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Irving sentenced Ziegler on June 18 to six months in federal custody, three 
months in prison and three months in a halfway house. 
</P>
<P>
Ziegler, who surrendered in July to federal authorities, has already served the 
three months in prison, and is in a Los Angeles-area halfway house, Gorder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The case involved one other man, according to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Darryl Nakatsuka, 43, of West Los Angeles, accused of being a courier with 
Myers, pleaded guilty Oct. 2 to a sole felony count of violating a federal 
currency law. 
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 26.

The New York Giants continue to play their own personal game of "chicken" with 
the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants beat the Indianapolis Colts, 24-7, Monday night to join the 49ers at 
8-0, the first time in 56 years two NFL teams have been unbeaten this deep into 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
New York won with a smothering defense, two touchdown runs by Ottis Anderson, a 
lot of jitterbugging by Dave Meggett and precise passing by Phil Simms, who 
completed 17 of 21 passes for 172 yards. Then the Giants clinched it with a 
31-yard fumble return by Dave Duerson. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Giants' 11th consecutive regular-season victory going back to last 
year. It brought them one step closer to a Monday night game at San Francisco 
Dec. 3 against the 49ers, winners of 16 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The last time two teams were 8-0 was in 1934, when Chicago and Detroit 
eventually went to 10-0. New York and San Francisco would both be 11-0 if they 
get through their next three games. 
</P>
<P>
This one was no contest in the first half. The Giants scored on their first 
three possessions -- a 23-yard field goal by Matt Bahr and touchdown runs of 
two and three yards by Anderson -- and had a 17-0 halftime lead after holding 
the Colts to one first down. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts came back to take the second half kickoff and march 80 yards for a 
touchdown on a one-yard run by Albert Bentley. It was set up by a 17-yard 
fourth-down pass to Billy Brooks from Jeff George, who was 23 for 37 for 160 
yards and was sacked three times, twice by Leonard Marshall.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: HEMACARE REPORTS LOSS FOR 3RD QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HemaCare Corp., a Sherman Oaks-based provider of blood-related services and 
products, reported a $290,000 loss for the third quarter, compared with a 
$126,526 profit a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The loss in the quarter that ended Sept. 30 came despite a 48% jump in 
HemaCare's revenue, to $2.18 million from $1.47 million. The company blamed the 
loss on costs associated with its new clinical laboratories business and to 
research projects. 
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of 1990, HemaCare lost $523,594 compared with 
year-earlier earnings of $333,328. Its nine-month revenue climbed 38% to $5.78 
million from $4.18 million.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: CAMERA PLATFORMS LOSES $679,128 IN 3RD QUARTER

<P>
Camera Platforms International Inc., a Valencia provider of production 
equipment to the movie and television industries, said it lost $679,128 in the 
third quarter, compared with a year-earlier loss of $744,090. 
</P>
<P>
The narrower loss came on a sharp rise in Camera Platforms' revenue, to 
$681,750 in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from $349,597 a year earlier. Continuing 
demand for the company's lighting products contributed to the gains, Camera 
Platforms said. 
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of 1990, the company lost $1.26 million on revenue of 
$3.26 million. A year earlier, it lost $2.23 million on revenue of $1.13 
million.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: HUNTWAY'S $3.58-MILLION LOSS BLAMED ON OIL PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huntway Partners L.P., suffering from the rapid rise in crude oil prices, 
reported a $3.58-million loss for the third quarter and suspended its 
distributions to unit-holders. 
</P>
<P>
Huntway is a Valencia-based producer of liquid asphalt and other products that 
it refines from crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
It is organized as a master limited partnership whose ownership units are 
traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Its distributions are similar to 
dividends. 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have soared since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, and Huntway said 
its crude prices have tripled since July. However, Huntway said it has been 
unable to raise its prices enough to match the higher oil costs, which led to 
the loss. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Huntway said it would not pay a third-quarter distribution to 
owners of its preference units, and "until cash flow and liquidity improve, no 
distributions will be paid to preference or common unit-holders," the company 
said. Huntway made a distribution to holders of its preference units in the 
second quarter, but it was cut to 10 cents per unit from the 34.5 cents paid 
early this year. 
</P>
<P>
The latest loss in the quarter ended Sept. 30 compared with a year-earlier loss 
of $1.03 million, and came despite a 52% jump in Huntway's revenue, to $35.7 
million from $23.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of this year, Huntway lost $2.81 million, compared 
with a year-earlier loss of $835,000, and its nine-month revenue rose 32% to 
$86.0 million from $65.3 million.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: K-SWISS EARNINGS JUMP 68% DURING 3RD QUARTER

REGIONAL EARNINGS: AMERICAN RESTAURANTS' QUARTERLY PROFIT RISES 78% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American Restaurants Corp., extending a recent rebound in earnings, said its 
third-quarter profit soared 78% from a year earlier on an 18% increase in 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura-based company, which operates Hudson's Grill and Wendy's 
restaurants, said net income in the quarter ended Oct. 1 rose to $264,682 from 
$148,390, while sales climbed to $7.37 million from $6.23 million. It was the 
company's seventh straight increase in quarterly earnings. 
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of this year, American Restaurants' net income jumped 
58%, to $593,460 from $376,410, and its nine-month sales rose 16% to $21.5 
million from $18.6 million.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: 3-D SYSTEMS INC. PROFIT DROPS 96% IN 3RD QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
3-D Systems Inc., a Canadian company whose sole operating unit is 3D Systems in 
Valencia, said its third-quarter profit plummeted 96% from a year earlier, and 
it warned of more problems ahead. 
</P>
<P>
3D Systems makes a machine that uses a computer, laser and chemicals to rapidly 
make plastic-like models that manufacturers use as prototypes for new products. 
</P>
<P>
In the quarter that ended Sept. 30, its parent company reported earnings of 
$14,722, down from $358,108 a year earlier. Its sales rose 30%, however, to 
$7.21 million from $5.53 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company said start-up costs for its new SLA-500 machine dragged down 
profits. But it also said that the weakening economy has caused many companies 
to postpone buying decisions, and that it does not expect "any significant 
change in the market or in the psychology of potential customers for some 
time." 
</P>
<P>
3-D Systems earned $544,506 in the first nine months of 1990, compared to a 
year-earlier loss of $2.38 million. Its nine-month sales nearly doubled, to 
$21.5 million from $10.8 million.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: PERCEPTRONICS EARNINGS FOR 3RD QUARTER DOWN 73% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perceptronics Inc. in Woodland Hills said its third-quarter earnings plunged 
73% from a year earlier on a 36% decline in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which makes computer-based simulators and other equipment for the 
military, said net income in the quarter that ended Sept. 30 fell to $104,099 
from $378,110 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Its revenue dropped to $4.73 million from $7.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Perceptronics attributed much of the declines to the winding down of its 
contract on SIMNET, a project that enables tank gunnery simulators to fight 
each other over a computer network. 
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of this year, Perceptronics' profit fell 48% to 
$253,638 from $491,706 a year earlier, and its nine-month revenue was down 23% 
to $10.9 million from $14.1 million.

Building on Past: Convicted Watergate figure Jeb Stuart Magruder has no problem 
with the possibility that his past notoriety may have played a role Sunday in

Equal Enforcement: Federal agents and San Jose police have broken up what they

in cash and hundreds of betting markers, along with computer disks containing

Rags to Riches: Businessman Harry Weinberg's billion-dollar estate will go 
primarily to the poor, according to trustees. An elementary school dropout who 
made his fortune in real estate and mass transit, Weinberg, 83, died Sunday in 
Hawaii after an 8-year battle with cancer. With the exception of about $3 
million he left to his grandchildren, the entire estate is going to the Harry 
and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation, now one of the 12 largest U.S. charitable 
organizations.

WRONG CONCLUSIONS ABOUT COMPUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ah, c'mon, Joe. I think you blew it. You know from a previous letter that I am 
an admirer of yours, but in your Sept. 18 column, "Maiming the Message Is Only 
Half the Danger," I think you and the researcher you cited draw the wrong 
conclusions. I don't doubt the evidence of poorer writing debouching from some 
computers, but I think that evidence might carry other interpretations than 
that computers somehow cause bad composition. 
</P>
<P>
For example, I think the evidence is capable of indicating the inverted values 
of our society, which does not prize and therefore pay for disciplined 
learning, clear thinking and powerful expression. Thus, the people who do 
possess the above characteristics often do not have the financial resources to 
buy the more expensive computers and must make do with typewriters or legal 
pads. 
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, the computer for those who are in the high school and college 
population may be just another toy from indulgent parents, along with the 
sports car in the parking lot and the posh apartment. Indulged students are not 
notorious for disciplined learning. Those who are in school despite having to 
work for the privilege or scrape along on a meager parental stipend may know 
the value of what they're working for and, again, be able to afford only a 
typewriter or legal pad. This may not be a true alternative to the previous 
paragraph but only a different facet of it; I can spell marvelously, but I'm no 
great shakes at logic. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of spelling, I'd like to point out that the greater incidence of 
misspellings in the computer output surely is an indication of prior mental 
disability or laziness. All it takes is running the essay through a spelling 
checker to obviate this. That same device also catches true typos, transposed 
letters (I'm slightly dyslexic) and twice-written words, although it will not 
indicate the improper use of there or their, to or too, as long as they're 
properly spelled. 
</P>
<P>

I'd like to recommend that you seriously consider learning to use a computer. 
Like me, you already know how to compose and spell. I find that the computer 
allows me to write much faster than I type or write longhand, so that I am 
better able to keep up with the flow of thought -- that is, when my thoughts 
are flowing rather than obstructed. I think that my writing is clearer and more 
elegant, in the best sense of that term, because I am able to go back and 
easily rewrite, change words, etc. When I typed, I would often forgo 
non-essential rewrites because I didn't want to retype the whole page for one 
word.

There is something essentially genteel about the tale of the phony fossil known 
as Piltdown Man. The ingeniously contrived hoax fooled two generations of 
gentlemen scientists before being exposed in 1954 as an orangutan's jaw and 
teeth joined to a human cranium. Since then, the list of possible perpetrators 
has been examined by a string of scientist-sleuths, whose fingers have pointed 
successively at figures as diverse as Arthur Conan Doyle and Teilhard de 
Chardin. 
</P>
<P>
Now we have a book claiming to be the last word on the scam: "Piltdown: A 
Scientific Forgery" by Frank Spenser, which comes with "The Piltdown Papers, 
1908-1955," the paper trail that Spenser followed to his solution. 
</P>
<P>
To recap the events: Sometime between 1908 and 1911, Charles Dawson, a 
solicitor in Lewes, Sussex, England, reported that a laborer working in nearby 
Piltdown had found something that looked like a shattered coconut in a gravel 
pit. The laborer gave a fragment of the object to Dawson, who recognized it as 
part of a human skull. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson went to the site and gathered eight more skull pieces as well as a 
fossil hippopotamus tooth. He reported his finds to Arthur Smith Woodward, at 
the Natural History Museum in London, who came to the site with the Jesuit 
scientist Chardin. The three found more teeth of extinct animals, and, at 
another site nearby, evidence of early man. 
</P>
<P>
Also involved were Arthur Keith, of the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College 
of Surgeons, who had a special interest in human evolution; Lewis Abbot, a 
friend of Dawson and Woodward who was a jeweler and amateur paleontologist in 
nearby Hastings, and Martin Hinton, a volunteer at the British Museum until 
appointed deputy keeper in zoology in 1921. Current opinion agrees that Dawson 
was a culprit but with a hitherto unnamed collaborator. 
</P>
<P>
Spenser eliminates possible suspects until he stops at Arthur Keith. Not only 
was Keith capable of the chemistry necessary to produce a fake, but he had 
access at the museum to the fossil teeth "seeded" at the sites. Above all, he 
was in touch with Dawson, who alone had the opportunity to plant the fakes. 
Spenser reveals Keith as the author of an anonymous paper that appeared only 
three days after the announcement of the discovery at the Geological Society. 
Finally, he shows how Piltdown ensured Keith's academic reputation. 
</P>
<P>
So what does it all matter today? No one suffered, and eventually truth did 
out. Given that Piltdown caused mischief, delaying for decades, perhaps, the 
current understanding of hominid evolution, is there more than the fascination 
of skulduggery unveiled to be gleaned from this story? 
</P>
<P>
Of course there is. For one, the ease with which the scientific community 
swallowed the fraud must be examined. From the announcement of the strange 
fossils in 1912 until 1954, when the whole episode was blown open with the aid 
of new dating technologies, scientists avoided the possibility that Piltdown 
was a deliberate fraud. 
</P>
<P>
As early as 1915, an American, Gerrit Miller, studied the skull and concluded 
that "on the basis of the evidence furnished by the Piltdown fossils and by the 
characters of all the men, apes and monkeys now known, a single individual 
cannot be supposed to have carried this jaw and skull." 
</P>
<P>
Scientists seldom suspect fraud, partly because science is self-correcting -- 
as it was with Piltdown -- and partly because science at that time was a 
gentleman's occupation, indulged in by members of the club who knew the rules. 
</P>
<P>
This club in Britain was nationalistic (fossils had been found in France and 
Germany; why not Britain?) and racist -- eager to discount Africa as the place 
to look for human beginnings. "Piltdown" is a cautionary tale. The hoax would 
never have gained such wide acceptance but for the smugness of the narrow 
scientific world in which it all occurred.

Proud Tina: Rock's Tina Turner has ended her 6 1/2-month "Foreign Affair" 
European tour that attracted 3 million fans, and has announced she's going to 
take a year off before performing again. 
</P>
<P>
Her tour began in April in Belgium and went on to 19 countries for 121 
performances. "I'm the first woman to fill all these stadiums and the feeling 
from all those fans night after night was fantastic. I don't want to close that 
door completely," said Miss Turner, who turns 52 on Nov. 26. "I'm going away 
for about a year and when I'm ready to return I just hope the fans will want 
whatever I have to offer." CLAUDIA PUIG

CHRISTO'S UMBRELLA ART PROJECT A HIT BEFORE IT'S UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The people who live amid the hills of the Tejon Pass are getting art lessons in 
unexpected places lately. 
</P>
<P>
Two locals had just left a coffee shop in Gorman one morning last month when 
they bumped into Christo, the famous Bulgarian-born artist who scorns the use 
of his last name. 
</P>
<P>
Eager to share news on the progress of his latest mega-art project -- 1,760 
umbrellas that will dot the hillsides of the pass next fall -- Christo pointed 
to a bright orange circle spray-painted the day before on a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"See where we will place an umbrella," Christo said. 
</P>
<P>
The pair looked in silence and appeared to struggle to respond. One finally 
blurted out: "It looks like you have everything under control." 
</P>
<P>
For the past several years, folks in these parts -- whether they want to or not 
-- have learned quite a bit about their frequent guest. They have watched 
movies of Christo's previous artistic exploits (such as wrapping a Parisian 
bridge with fabric and surrounding Florida islands with pink plastic). They 
have chatted about art at community get-togethers, received the artist's slick 
catalogues by mail and posed for pictures snapped by his West German 
photographer. 
</P>
<P>
By now, there is probably nobody for miles around who does not know about the 
umbrellas. 
</P>
<P>
Next October, the golden yellow umbrellas will decorate cow pastures and small 
towns along 18 miles of Interstate 5 in Kern and Los Angeles counties. At the 
same time, 1,340 royal blue umbrellas will snake through rice fields, a 
riverbed, a bamboo forest and villages along a 12-mile stretch in rural Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Each umbrella will stand almost 20 feet tall and weigh 450 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
It most likely will be the world's largest art project. About 1,500 people on 
each side of the Pacific Ocean will erect the umbrellas in early October. Three 
weeks later, the work crews, made up primarily of art lovers, college students 
and the curious, will dismantle them and the material will be recycled. 
</P>
<P>
All that will remain will be memories and Christo's pricey umbrella collages, 
sketches and other preparatory work that museums, investors and art collectors 
already have been gobbling up. A modest collage costs $35,000. An eight-foot 
drawing fetches $360,000. 
</P>
<P>
Christo, who spends as much time as possible creating umbrella art in his Soho 
loft, is paying for "The Umbrellas, Joint Project for Japan and USA" himself by 
selling his umbrella sketches and other preparatory works. The current price, 
$26 million, is double last year's estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Even schmoozing is expensive. The diminutive artist with impeccable manners has 
flown to the West Coast and Japan dozens of times to persuade skeptical 
bureaucrats, farmers and landowners that his dream to "stretch peoples' notion 
of art" is not a joke. 
</P>
<P>
He has largely succeeded. He has secured all of the necessary approvals, 
including a critical Japanese permit so detailed it is the size of a city phone 
book. The California Legislature has feted the artist for choosing the state 
once more as a backdrop for his creativity. (In 1976 he ran a 24-mile 
shimmering fence across Sonoma and Marin counties and into the ocean.) 
</P>
<P>
The Kern County Board of Supervisors in Bakersfield is thrilled that for once 
its county will not be lost in Los Angeles' shadow. 
</P>
<P>
Abe Gueler, owner of a heavy equipment company, is so excited about the project 
that he plans to widen a steep dirt road with hair-raising curves on his land 
in the Tejon Pass so it will be easier for Christo's workers to reach his 
mountaintop. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, Gueler said, "a high percentage didn't know who Christo was, 
didn't have the slightest idea." Then some locals decided that he "had to be 
nuts" when they learned of his projects in Paris, Florida and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Gueler added, "Now he's getting a better response." 
</P>
<P>
Part of Christo's purpose in visiting the West Coast for 3 1/2 days last month 
was to drum up paid recruits who will install, protect and answer questions 
about the umbrellas while they are displayed next fall. Christo's never had 
trouble in the past finding help, and when he showed his umbrella slides and 
answered questions in Los Angeles and Valencia, the crowds were so large that 
many had to sit on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"Why do you create such big monumental art?" someone in the crowd shouted as 
Christo stood behind a lectern on the USC campus. 
</P>
<P>
"My, human beings build much bigger things," he replied in his thick Bulgarian 
accent. "They build airports, skyscrapers, highways, bridges, much more 
monumental." He said his art "is monumental because it is only irrational and 
completely irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
The audience cheered. 
</P>
<P>
Christo lectured at night and hiked during the day. Two years ago, he walked 
for miles -- he said it was the equivalent of 2 1/2 trips up and down Mt. 
Everest -- to mark where he wanted to place each umbrella. This time, he wanted 
to make revisions. 
</P>
<P>
Christo knows the dips and bends and contours of this brutish landscape like a 
tour bus driver knows Hollywood. He picked a favorite vista to unfurl his maps 
and talk about his plans. It was a steep hillside covered with tall dry grass 
that sounded like muffled firecrackers when crushed underfoot. Nearby was a 
wooden surveyor's stick tied with a pink plastic ribbon flapping in the wind. 
It marks the spot where one of the umbrellas will stand. 
</P>
<P>
From Christo's hillside vantage point, I-5 looked like a thin gray snake. A 
dying oak tree clung to the crumbling earth and a cascade of boulders appeared 
frozen in a free fall. To the north, the burnished hills formed a distant giant 
V and beyond lay the pancake-flat expanse of the San Joaquin Valley, tinted 
blue by clouds. 
</P>
<P>
"Here the freedom of the umbrellas is so visible," Christo said in awe. 
</P>
<P>
"They are so free. They have no other reason than to be works of art." 
</P>
<P>
The umbrella project is an international effort. The nylon fabric was woven in 
Germany. Various parts were manufactured in Japan, Iowa, Kansas and Texas. The 
umbrella tops are being sewn at North Sails Inc. in San Diego, one of the 
world's largest sail makers. 
</P>
<P>
Later this month, workers from Rain for Rent, an irrigation company, will begin 
assembling and painting the aluminum and steel umbrellas in a dilapidated 
warehouse in Bakersfield. Its location is a secret. 
</P>
<P>
There were only three people working in the warehouse one recent afternoon, but 
they were making a terrible racket. The sound of drills cutting through 
aluminum bounced off the concrete floor and bowed ceiling. The poles, which 
looked like giant metal straws, were stacked in tall piles. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Grundvig, chief engineer at Rain for Rent, will oversee this portion of 
the aesthetic process. He says he is amazed at the resiliency of Christo's art. 
</P>
<P>
To test its durability, an umbrella was left for three months on a mountaintop 
in Tejon Pass. After a windstorm earlier this year, Grundvig was dispatched to 
pick up the pieces. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect to see it there," he acknowledged. "Not in one piece." 
</P>
<P>
But it was.

BURBANK MAN GUILTY OF MURDERING WIFE; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: JURY DECIDES THAT EX-CONVICT KILLED HIS SPOUSE TO COLLECT HER INSURANCE 
AND WOUNDED HIMSELF AS A RUSE. HE SAYS, 'I WAS FRAMED.'

<P>
Dan Montecalvo, an ex-convict who met his wife through a prison ministry while 
he was serving time for bank robbery, was found guilty of her murder Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A Pasadena Superior Court jury deliberated three days before deciding that 
Montecalvo committed first-degree murder by firing two shots from a .38-caliber 
revolver into his wife of nine years, Carol, in their Burbank home 2 1/2 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Montecalvo, 49, who prosecutors say then shot himself in the back to make it 
appear that the killer was a panicked burglar, will face 27 years to life in 
prison when he is sentenced Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a gray suit, Montecalvo, who at times acted as his own attorney and 
cross-examined several witnesses during the six-week trial, sat stoically as 
the verdict was read. 
</P>
<P>
Later Monday, in a telephone call to The Times from his holding cell, he 
contended that the jury was swayed more by his criminal past than by any 
evidence that prosecutors presented. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't convicted of murder," he said. "I was convicted of being a bad 
person." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors were the first to admit that their case -- a "whodunit" until 
Montecalvo's arrest last March -- was largely based on circumstantial evidence. 
There were no eyewitnesses and no murder weapon was ever found. 
</P>
<P>
But through 85 witnesses, 163 exhibits and 8,600 pages of investigative 
reports, they portrayed Montecalvo as a desperate man, saddled with gambling 
debts and knowledgeable about guns, who killed his 43-year-old wife to cash in 
on her $600,000 in life insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
"He led two lives; he certainly had two personalities," Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Robert Cohen said of Montecalvo. "To his church friends, he was a good guy. But 
while his wife was at work, he was in bars, hustling women and gambling." 
</P>
<P>
Montecalvo said he met his wife in 1978 while he was in a Wisconsin prison and 
she was active in a nearby ministry. They communicated as pen pals for several 
months. In 1980, they were married in the prison chapel. 
</P>
<P>
"In the whole world, she was the one who trusted him the most," said the 
victim's father, Horace Magavero. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Montecalvo, who worked as an office manager and in advertising sales for 
local telephone companies, was killed March 31, 1988, after an evening stroll 
with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Upon returning home, according to Montecalvo, they decided to replace an auto 
registration sticker that was scheduled to expire at midnight. Montecalvo said 
his wife stepped into the house alone to get a towel to clean the license 
plate, then there was a startled shout and gunfire. When he rushed inside, 
Montecalvo said, he was grabbed from behind and shot. He said he learned of her 
death from his hospital bed. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators found Carol Montecalvo's body slumped in the hallway with a 
bullet wound in the left side of her neck. Another bullet had been fired from 
close range, execution-style, into the back of her neck. 
</P>
<P>
The shots did not prove instantly fatal, however, and in a lawsuit filed last 
year Montecalvo insisted that his wife could have survived had she received 
prompt medical attention. The suit, he contends, spurred police to turn to him 
as their prime suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Montecalvo has also charged that investigators botched the case by mishandling 
evidence, failing to pursue other likely suspects and waiting two years to 
perform a key laboratory test that prosecutors say indicated Montecalvo fired a 
gun the night of the murder. 
</P>
<P>
"I was framed," he said Monday in the telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
But members of the 10-woman, two-man jury said they were not moved by 
Montecalvo's defense. Once they agreed that no robbery had been committed, they 
said they were left with only one conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like fitting the pieces of a puzzle together," said jury foreman 
Kenneth Gerhard, 42, a United Parcel Service manager. "Eventually, you get to 
the point where there's no one else there. . . . It had to be Mr. Montecalvo." 
</P>
<P>
"Carol's smiling down on everybody right now," said Burbank Police Detective 
Brian Arnspiger, the chief investigator in the case. "She was a beautiful woman 
and he just snuffed her out." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Victor Merina contributed to this story.

Responding to complaints that children of Middle Eastern ancestry have been 
subjected to racial slurs, the board on Monday reaffirmed a policy approved two 
years ago condemning prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
A resolution asks that all school employees combat prejudice and encourage 
open, accurate discussions about events in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
School board President Jackie Goldberg said that students who call others names 
may be required to write essays on the importance of treating all individuals 
with respect or to attend group discussions about tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
The board also: 
</P>
<P>
Gave tentative approval to a proposal establishing a mobile Ben &amp; Jerry's 
Ice Cream store to be managed and operated by Manual Arts High School students 
at USC. Students will be responsible for all phases of the business and profits 
will go to the high school.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: YAROSLAVSKY WARNS OF CRISIS, CALLS FOR CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Asserting that Los Angeles is on the brink of an "unparalleled" fiscal crisis, 
City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said Monday that the city must make deep cuts 
in its budget or face a $100-million deficit next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I see cuts coming in every department," said Yaroslavsky, chairman of the 
council's Budget and Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a crisis. We are spending in the red right now." 
</P>
<P>
The city's financial problems are related largely to the economic slowdown in 
the nation and the region, leading to a drop in tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
The slowdown has had a "devastating" effect on the city's reserve fund -- now 
$3 million with seven months left in the fiscal year, he said. The crisis in 
the Persian Gulf also has added $4 million to the city's gasoline bill, he 
said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY URGED TO ACCEPT SETTLEMENT ON OLIVE 
VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Claims Board on Monday recommended that the county 
accept a $3-million settlement from two firms for alleged defects in their 
design of the Olive View Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The county filed suit against four firms in 1986 after officials learned that 
the almost-completed medical center in Sylmar was plagued with design problems 
that delayed its opening for nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
The total county cost to correct the design flaws in the sophisticated air 
exhaust and plumbing systems totaled $4.8 million, said Nancy Singer, who 
chairs the claims board, a panel that reviews lawsuit settlements. The county's 
settlement with Syska &amp; Hennessey Inc. and Welton Becket Associates Inc. 
was reached after a Superior Court judge strongly recommended in October that 
the county accept the $3-million offer. 
</P>
<P>
Singer did not know the status of settlement negotiations with the two 
remaining defendants, Design Joint Venture and Luckman Partnership Inc.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COURT UPHOLDS DELAY OF BRANDO MURDER TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state's 2nd District Court of Appeal issued a brief ruling late Monday 
upholding a stay that delays indefinitely the start of Christian Brando's 
murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
The proceeding, which had been set to begin Monday in Santa Monica, was 
postponed while officials review the status of Brando's half-sister, Cheyenne 
Brando, 20, who is recovering from a drug overdose in Tahiti. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Brando, son of actor Marlon Brando, is charged in the shooting death 
of Cheyenne's former lover, Dag Drollet, at the actor's home on May 16. 
</P>
<P>
Cheyenne Brando, a key witness to events that led up to the shooting, fled to 
Tahiti a month after the killing, gave birth to Drollet's child and had refused 
to return to California to testify. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court has ordered legal briefs to be submitted by Christian 
Brando's attorney on Nov. 13, with responding briefs from the prosecution on 
Nov. 19.

PAPER SAYS ALL MARCOS WEALTH TO BE RETURNED

<P>
Imelda Marcos, who was reported to have reached a deal with the government to 
repatriate part of her family's fortune, has offered to return all her late 
husband's riches, a newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
The independent Manila Standard said the former first lady made the offer in 
exchange for Manila's permission to allow her to return to the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said it interviewed Marcos by telephone from her Beverly Hills 
hotel on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But President Corazon Aquino said Monday the return of Marcos was not being 
discussed in current negotiations for the repatriation of part of the Marcoses' 
wealth from Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
"This does not concern the return of Mrs. Marcos here," Aquino said. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos and her late husband, Ferdinand, who was overthrown in a civilian-backed 
military uprising in 1986 and forced into exile in Hawaii, are alleged to have 
stolen more than $10 billion during the dictator's 20-year rule. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino's government has barred the return of Imelda Marcos for security 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"All the wealth of President Marcos, and my life as well, I dedicate for the 
betterment of all Filipinos," Marcos was quoted as saying by the Standard. "I 
am coming home to dedicate my life and my husband's legacy to rebuild the 
country and provide a better life for all Filipinos."

SCHOOLS TAKE TAPER-OFF APPROACH ON SMOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leaders of the Los Angeles Unified School District voted Monday to implement a 
tobacco-free policy in two phases, which will allow smokers to ease into 
compliance. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase will begin Nov. 15 -- Great American Smokeout Day -- and 
establish designated outdoor smoking areas that will be off limits to students. 
Smoking will be banned in all other areas, including school buildings, grounds 
and district vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Student smoking has been prohibited and employee smoking restricted to certain 
rooms and areas for several years. 
</P>
<P>
The second phase, which will begin on an as-yet-unspecified date next year, 
will prohibit smoking anywhere in the school system. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Martin, a school administrator who headed a committee that recommended 
the two-step process, said the group wanted to avoid a "hard-handed approach." 
</P>
<P>
"We recognize some people have strong feelings about smoking," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
The district will launch a program to educate school employees about the health 
hazards of tobacco and refer smokers to community programs to help them quit. 
The district also will sponsor stop-smoking clinics and start support groups. 
</P>
<P>
The regulations will affect students, employees and visitors to any school and 
those attending any school-sponsored activity, athletic event or meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Rita Walters cast the sole dissenting vote against the designated 
smoking areas. She also voiced concern about a proposal that would allow school 
employees to inform anonymously on those who violate the regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"It smacks of totalitarianism . . . it's a big brother approach," Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
The ban was initially proposed by a group of teachers and other employees and 
representatives of the American Heart, Lung and Cancer associations who 
persuaded board President Jackie Goldberg to sponsor the motion. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers are expected to be hardest hit by the ban, but relatively little 
protest has been registered either with the board or teachers union, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Smoking bans have been implemented in school districts across the country with 
little debate or opposition.

13 OFFICIALS TO GO ON FREE EUROPE TRIP TO STUDY TRANSIT INNOVATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
TRAVEL: TWO STATE BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS AND HOSTS IN PARIS, BERLIN AND OTHER 
CITIES WILL PICK UP THE TAB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Thirteen of the state's most influential transportation and environmental 
officials will leave Wednesday on an all-expense-paid, 12-day trip to Europe to 
study high-speed railroads, high-tech automobiles and highways and exotic 
alternative fuel systems. 
</P>
<P>
The trip to Paris, Berlin, Stockholm and other cities is being sponsored by two 
California business organizations that say they try to preserve a cautious 
"environmental balance" while combatting environmental extremists. 
</P>
<P>
The California Foundation on the Environment and the Economy, an offshoot of 
the California Council for Environmental and Economic Balance, will pay all 
expenses on the $4,000-a-person trip that are not picked up by European 
industrial hosts, according to foundation director Pat Mason. 
</P>
<P>
Serving as staff for the trip will be two officials of the California Institute 
for Technology Exchange, Don Camph and Yvonne Ryzak. Mason and Camph said in 
separate interviews that far from being a junket, this and other annual trips 
the foundation has sponsored in recent years have been hard-working looks, in 
Mason's words, "at how other countries have dealt with 
technological-environmental issues." 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder when I'm going to get a nap," said Mason of the forthcoming trip. 
</P>
<P>
Said Camph: "Our premise is that one of the ways public policy is formed and 
facilitated is direct exposure of policy makers to what is going on in various 
societies. . . . I'm not going to tell you we're not going to have some fun. 
But it's basically work." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the group will fly economy class and stay in moderately priced 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Among those scheduled to go are three state transportation commissioners who 
have been skeptical of expenditures for rail right of way acquisitions and 
commuter rail projects, commission Chairman W. E. (Bill) Leonard and members 
Bruce Nestande and Joe Duffel. 
</P>
<P>
Nestande said, "We have a very jammed schedule. . . . We are in Berlin for less 
than a day." 
</P>
<P>
The four legislators are Republican state Sen. Becky Morgan, vice chairman of 
the Senate Transportation Committee; Republican state Sen. Bill Leonard, 
chairman of the Senate Republican Caucus; Assemblyman Jim Costa, a Democrat, 
and Democratic Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin. Costa recently sponsored 
legislation authorizing Caltrans to help privately funded rail and road 
projects with gifts of public rights of way. Easton is a member of both the 
Assembly transportation and toxic materials committees. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Morgan said she is enthusiastic about the trip because she went with the 
same group to Indonesia and Australia in 1985, looking at oil and gas 
exploration facilities, and learned a great deal. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no effort to sell me on anything," she said of the earlier trip. 
</P>
<P>
Others going include retired Senate President Pro Tem James Mills, now chairman 
of the San Diego Metro Transit Development Board; Norton Younglove, a Riverside 
County supervisor who is chairman of the managing board of the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District; Chris Reed, a Santa Monica city councilwoman who 
is chairman of the Southern California Assn. of Governments; Henry W. Wedaa, a 
Yorba Linda city councilman who is vice chairman of AQMD; Rod Dierdon, a Santa 
Clara County supervisor who is chairman of the San Jose area's Metropolitan 
Transportation Commission, and Nello Bianco, chairman of BART, the Bay Area 
Rapid Transit system. 
</P>
<P>
Also going are two businessmen, Jack Coffey, manager of state affairs for 
Chevron, and Steve Baum, senior vice president and general counsel for San 
Diego Gas and Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
Camph said that while in Europe the party will ride French, German and Swedish 
high-speed trains, but will not go to a German testing facility for the kind of 
magnetic levitation train proposed to run between Las Vegas and Anaheim, 
because it has been shut down for safety work. 
</P>
<P>
He said the party will meet with European experts on automatic vehicle 
navigation systems, vehicle identification technology, automatic toll 
collection and congestion pricing, a system for charging people escalated tolls 
for entering certain congested areas at certain hours.

GREAT COMMUNICATOR, 7, IS DESTROYED AFTER SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a tragic scene that was far too common during the 27-day Oak Tree meeting, 
1988 Breeders' Cup turf champion Great Communicator had to be destroyed Monday 
at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
The 7-year-old gelding, with Russell Baze aboard, was second and closing the 
gap on Ultrasonido with about four furlongs to run in the $219,400 Carleton F. 
Burke Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in an instant, his right hind leg gave way. 
</P>
<P>
Great Communicator was destroyed after suffering a compound fracture of the 
cannon bone in his right hind leg and a possible fracture of the lower leg. 
</P>
<P>
In the previous day's feature, Baldomero had to be destroyed after suffering a 
broken left foreleg at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
And there were several other horses without the credentials of Baldomero and 
Great Communicator who went down during the meeting, raising questions about 
the track's safety. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's coincidental, then there's been an awful lot of coincidence here," 
said one jockey, who declined to be identified. "I don't think it's so much the 
turf course as it is training on this main track." 
</P>
<P>
Great Communicator was seemingly past his prime after failing to come close in 
eight consecutive races before the Henry P. Russell Handicap. But, in that Oct. 
17 race, Great Communicator had looked like his old self while holding off 
Polar Boy to win. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, trainer Thad Ackel's pride and joy appeared to be back on his game. 
</P>
<P>
"He felt 100% in the warmup and in the way he was running until that point," 
Baze said of Great Communicator, who finished with more than $2.9 million in 
earnings and whose biggest victory came in the 1988 Breeders' Cup Turf. 
</P>
<P>
"He was sitting comfortably, and he was just getting himself gathered up and 
starting to close the gap a bit on the leader. The first bad step he took was 
when it broke. The old guy didn't want to pull up. It just makes you sick. I 
feel really bad for Thad because that horse means so much to him." 
</P>
<P>
Said Ackel: "I had a lump in my throat since I watched Go For Wand go down on 
television in the Breeders' Cup. When I saw her go down, I prayed that it 
wouldn't happen to me." 
</P>
<P>
Ackel had given Great Communicator six months off after he suffered a wrenched 
ankle. He returned to racing in July, and more recently the horse had undergone 
minor surgery for a displaced palate. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a perfectly sound horse going into today's race, and that's what 
bothers me," Ackel said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Ackel nor Charlie Whittingham, a trainer with numerous grass horses, 
would blame the Santa Anita turf course for the recent injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't knock Santa Anita," Ackel said. "They responded to complaints about 
the turf course by spending millions of dollars, so they put the money where it 
belonged. I'm not sure they accomplished what they set out to do, but they've 
spent a lot of money trying and given it an all-out effort. 
</P>
<P>
"They ran a couple of other turf races before my horse ran, and when that 
happens a course is bound to have a few holes in it. My horse took a couple of 
funny strides just when he was moving up toward the lead. He had been moving so 
fluidly in the mornings, and I thought he had come up to the race perfectly." 
</P>
<P>
Said Whittingham: "How many races had that horse run? He's been in 56 races? 
Well, there you are. Not only that, he runs hard, he hits the ground hard. He 
runs hard, he hit the ground hard, he's not young, and he broke his leg. That's 
your answer." 
</P>
<P>
Looking for a sweep of Oak Tree's two biggest turf races, Rial won the Burke, 
rallying from last to beat favored Ultrasonido by a head. 
</P>
<P>
However, after a lengthy stewards' inquiry, Rial was disqualified and placed 
second, making Ultrasonido the winner in his first start for owners Frank and 
Jan Whitham. Bayakoa's owners had purchased the 5-year-old Argentine-bred from 
Alberto Hansen Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Lugging in badly through the stretch despite Rafael Meza's left-handed urging, 
Rial came in and bumped Ultrasonido nearing the wire. The stewards ruled this 
caused Ultrasonido to break stride and awarded him the victory, although Rial 
would have been an easy winner if he had maintained a straight course. 
</P>
<P>
The Oak Tree Board of Stewards ordered jockey Pat Valenzuela to appear at 
Hollywood Park by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old rider, who has had problems with drugs and alcohol, called in 
sick Saturday, then later refused to take a drug test and told Dr. Neal Fisher 
he was going to take "three months off to straighten out my life." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela was suspended for 60 days Oct. 27, 1989, after testing positive for 
cocaine. The suspension cost him the mount on Sunday Silence in the Breeders' 
Cup Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kent Desormeaux won his first riding title since making the Southland his home. 
He finished with 23 winners, one more than Gary Stevens, Alex Solis and Eddie 
Delahoussaye. . . . Richard Mandella, who turned 40 Monday, won the training 
title with 12 victories. . . . The daily on-track attendance for Oak Tree was 
21,879, compared to 21,903 in 1989 when the meeting lasted 32 days. On-track 
handle was down 1.3% from the previous year, but the daily average handle of 
$6,619,645, factoring in off-track and out-of-state sites, was up 5.6%. . . . 
Reluctant Guest, who finished 10th in Sunday's Yellow Ribbon Stakes, was 
injured and will be out for several months.

TRAIL BLAZERS CAN STICK LAKERS WITH 0-2 START

If that was a statement the Lakers delivered to Portland in Hawaii, what 
additional words would they like to whisper in tonight's home opener? 
</P>
<P>
"They're all statement games now," Coach Mike Dunleavy said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's big. They're all big. San Antonio was a game we really wanted to win. 
Tonight is a game we really want to win." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers have to win or be 0-2 for the first time in 12 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
These teams started the exhibition season playing two consecutive games in 
Honolulu. The first night, Dunleavy and Portland's Rick Adelman looked into one 
another's eyes, threw away their take-a-look-at-everyone plans and let the 
regulars slug it out. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson went 42 minutes, James Worthy 39 and all five Portland starters 
logged 30 or more as the Lakers rallied to win. 
</P>
<P>
The next night, with a normal training camp rotation, the Blazers ran away and 
hid. They looked good enough that Dunleavy and Johnson conceded that Portland 
deserved its team-to-beat status. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers opened for real Saturday at San Antonio, shot 67% in the first 
quarter but 35% after that and surrendered a 14-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Many of their shots flew from the outer reaches -- of the 35 they made, 13 were 
inside 15 feet -- and Dunleavy was called upon Monday to explain, no, that's 
not how his new offense is supposed to work. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what happened, we hit so many outside shots early, guys had confidence 
they could shoot outside," he said. "As the momentum of the game changed, we 
started missing and (the Spurs) got back into it. What we preach is, you've got 
to know what the situation is to take those shots. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to take advantage of our people in the low post. Our low-post players 
are Sam Perkins and James Worthy, Earvin (Johnson), even Vlade (Divac) if he 
doesn't get in foul trouble. James had it going good (35 points) so he stepped 
outside a bunch." 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers are 2-0 but struggled to edge the Houston Rockets at home, 
90-89, and the Sacramento Kings on the road, 95-93 in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The Blazers are blazing away at 35%. Danny Ainge is at 52.4 and the rest are a 
combined 33% with no one else higher than 42%. 
</P>
<P>
Buck Williams, scoreless Friday night, said they might have been overcome by 
the emotion of their banner-raising and taken out of their game by Akeem 
Olajuwon's shot-blocking. 
</P>
<P>
And Saturday night? "I have no answer for you," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
In Portland, there are questions about the Trail Blazers' response to being 
made the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Around here, they're asking different questions. Everyone gets more data 
tonight.

CARSON FIRED BY BROWNS AFTER 42-0 DEFEAT TO BILLS

The Cleveland Browns, off to their worst start since 1984, fired Coach Bud 
Carson on Monday, the day after their worst home loss ever. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Art Modell, who promised last year that Carson would be his last head 
coach, changed his mind after Sunday's 42-0 loss to the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an embarrassment for all of us," Modell said. 
</P>
<P>
Carson, the first coaching casualty of the season, was replaced by offensive 
coordinator Jim Shofner. 
</P>
<P>
Modell asked Shofner to take over for at least the rest of the season. He 
becomes the Browns' ninth head coach. Carson's three-year contract runs through 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
Carson said Monday he thought the Browns (2-7) were back on track when they 
lost to the San Francisco 49ers, 20-17, on a last-minute field goal a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected to play well last night, and we did not do it," Carson said. "Not 
only did we not do it, we played as badly as we can play." 
</P>
<P>
Carson gambled by starting Mike Pagel at quarterback against the Bills, instead 
of Bernie Kosar. Kosar will start when the Browns play again on Nov. 18 against 
Houston, Shofner said. The Browns have a bye this week. 
</P>
<P>
Including playoff games, Carson was 12-14-1 with the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
Carson, 59, replaced Marty Schottenheimer as the Brown coach on Jan. 27, 1989, 
after Schottenheimer left in a dispute with Modell over coaching styles. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns were 9-6-1 and AFC Central champions under Carson last year, making 
it to the AFC title game before losing to Denver. But 1990 has been a 
nightmare, with injuries, retirements and holdouts wiping out Cleveland's 
offensive line and fouling up the defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel Bud was given a fair shake," said safety Felix Wright, who staged 
a bitter holdout before the season. "I'm disappointed. Who knows what would 
have happened if we were all together during training camp, and happy?"

REMAINDER OF RAIDER SCHEDULE TAKES ON A DIFFERENT LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Halfway through the season, you pick the Raiders apart and wonder why they 
aren't 8-0. In their two defeats, by Buffalo and Kansas City, they squandered 
fourth-quarter leads on the road. 
</P>
<P>
You nit-pick. 
</P>
<P>
Take away two blocked punts that helped whisk the Bills and Chiefs to victories 
and maybe the Raider record remains unblemished. Maybe the race in the AFC West 
would be over. Maybe the Raiders pull out Sunday's game if they run the ball in 
one crucial, fourth-quarter series against Kansas City, instead of throwing 
caution and three incomplete passes to the wind. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, maybe no one believes how far the Raiders have come; how they sit 
atop the AFC West after eight games, a perch only a few loyal Raider employees 
could have envisioned last summer after four consecutive seasons at .500 or 
below. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've done pretty good," Coach Art Shell said Monday. "We just have to 
get better as the season goes on. The good teams are going to start getting 
stronger as the year goes by, and the teams that are not strong are going to 
fall by the wayside. We don't plan on being one of the teams that falls by the 
wayside." 
</P>
<P>
Why not dream? The Raiders have four remaining home games. They have won all 10 
of their games at the Coliseum since Shell took over for Mike Shanahan. If form 
holds, that's four more victories and a total of 10. On the road ahead await 
the Miami Dolphins on Nov. 19, a tougher game than anyone could have imagined a 
month ago. But then come the Denver Broncos, Detroit Lions and Minnesota 
Vikings, a combined 7-17 so far. 
</P>
<P>
So what's not to like? 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody looks at the schedule and says it's easy and soft," Shell said. "But 
I found out a long time ago in this league that there ain't no softies on the 
schedule. Not for us. I know that." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, timing is everything. Miami didn't look so good two months ago. Now, 
the Dolphins are loaded on defense, of all places, to go with quarterback Dan 
Marino. 
</P>
<P>
Once, the Broncos were almost unbeatable at home. No more. The Raiders drop by 
Mile High Stadium on Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Then on Dec. 22, it's the Vikings at the Metrodome. You'd rather have teeth 
pulled than play there in past years. Now, who knows? By then, Herschel Walker 
may be a full-time bobsledder. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders also get the Cincinnati Bengals at the Coliseum on Dec. 16. Which 
Cincinnati teams shows up? Will it be Boomer or a bummer? 
</P>
<P>
Shell said he doesn't look ahead 10 minutes, let alone 10 weeks. He doesn't 
bother with stuff like hoping the Bills take a few on the chin so that the 
Raiders can get home-field advantage and avoid a trip to Buffalo in January for 
the playoffs. The Dolphins might have something to say about the AFC East race, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Shell set no mid-term goals for the Raiders, other than noting the importance 
of getting off to a fast start. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first five games of the season, if you can come out 4-1 you're in great 
shape," he said, noting that his team did that in his first full season as head 
coach. "It's just history with this organization. We've always felt that way. . 
. . You don't want to dig a hole for yourself and try to climb out of it. 
That's tough to do. Why not get on top and let everybody catch you? That's what 
you want." 
</P>
<P>
So far, that's what the Raiders have done. 
</P>
<P>
They have done it, surprise, with quarterback Jay Schroeder, and largely 
without the services of receiver Tim Brown, a former Heisman Trophy winner of 
many moves who presently has nowhere to shake. Brown has five catches in eight 
games. 
</P>
<P>
They have done it without last year's starting quarterback, Steve Beuerlein, 
who hasn't dressed for a game. 
</P>
<P>
And they have done it largely without Bo Jackson, who is 1-1 as a Raider.

JUST CALL IT NO-FAULT OFFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the season began, critics of the run-and-shoot offense said it would never 
work in pro football. 
</P>
<P>
They called it a high school offense. They said that the NFL's first two 
run-and-shoot teams, the Houston Oilers and Detroit Lions, were just wasting 
their time. 
</P>
<P>
They were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Or so it seems at the halfway point of a long season in which the Oilers are 
leading the AFC in offense, and the Lions are second in the NFC in points 
scored. 
</P>
<P>
"We've both moved the ball against everybody," Mouse Davis, Detroit's 
run-and-shoot philosopher, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, both teams are having trouble winning, apparently for 
different reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Detroit defense has been erratic. Against Washington Sunday, the Lions 
lost, 41-38, when they couldn't hold a 35-14 lead after Detroit quarterback 
Rodney Peete left with a hamstring injury in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Oilers keep trying to win exclusively on passes by quarterback Warren 
Moon. Against the Rams Sunday, the Oilers called 50 pass plays and lost, 17-13, 
after calling only 10 runs. 
</P>
<P>
This may reflect a basic misunderstanding on the Houston team of what the 
run-and-shoot system is all about. 
</P>
<P>
Properly operated, it's about running as well as passing, its advocates say. 
The back in the one-back run-and-shoot offense should be getting the ball once 
every three plays -- on either draw plays or traps -- at random times and on 
all three downs, including third and 10. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Oilers' best back, Allen Pinkett, got it only nine times at 
Anaheim on a day when Moon dropped back 50 times. 
</P>
<P>
Houston's big-pass offense nearly won it, anyway, in the fourth quarter. 
Nothing but benefit plays saved the Rams: a drop by a Houston receiver who had 
a touchdown in sight, a slip by another Oiler on an Anaheim soft spot, an 
offside jump by the Rams -- unseen by the officials -- and other such plays. 
</P>
<P>
But none of it would have mattered to the Oilers if they had been calling a few 
draw plays. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams (3-5) are still in the race for the playoffs in a season that has 
brought 17 sub-.500 teams to the NFL after two months of upsets. 
</P>
<P>
The Ram defense has taken most of the heat this year, but the offense will be 
on trial at Anaheim Sunday against the league's best defensive organization, 
the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Which is a reminder that linebacker Lawrence Taylor is still on the team. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those closely studying the tapes of Giant games this fall have noted a 
strange phenomenon: When Taylor rushes the passer, he has often broken through 
untouched. 
</P>
<P>
Are the blockers getting to be afraid of him? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's that," Minnesota defensive coach Floyd Peters said. "The 
problem is that from a standing start, Taylor can accelerate into full speed 
faster than anyone I've ever seen -- in any sport." 
</P>
<P>
The Green Bay Packers will be at the Coliseum Sunday to play the Raiders (6-2) 
at the hour of the Ram kickoff, 1 p.m., as the confused NFL scheduling 
department continues to muddle through its worst season. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders would be 7-1 if more people had held quarterback Jay Schroeder's 
wind-blown passes at Kansas City Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's best pass was delivered on third and eight from the Raider 29 in 
the fourth quarter to his new tight end, Ethan Horton, who carried it far into 
Chief territory before fumbling at the Kansas City 31. 
</P>
<P>
A converted running back, Horton hasn't played tight end long enough to realize 
that five yards before the fumble, he'd gotten everything out of that play that 
was essential. 
</P>
<P>
His mission just then, with a first down well earned, the Chiefs closing in on 
him and a Raider scoring chance imminent, was to protect the ball at whatever 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
He should remember next time. 
</P>
<P>
This much can be said for Schroeder: If he and his counselor, Raider 
quarterback coach Mike White, were in Kansas City, the Chiefs would win the 
division title going away and probably the AFC championship as well. 
</P>
<P>
As of opening day two months ago, it was clear that Kansas City General Manager 
Carl Peterson and his coach, Marty Schottenheimer, had put together a 
championship lineup -- except at quarterback, where they were still leaning on 
an old war horse, Steve DeBerg, 36, a 14-year veteran of standby service on 
four or five NFL teams. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed obvious that they would go as far as DeBerg, with his limited 
abilities, could take them. 
</P>
<P>
And it still looks that way. 
</P>
<P>
An extremely accurate practice-field passer, DeBerg, at game time, too often 
throws too early or too late or to the wrong target. He is probably the least 
instinctive football player on a greatly talented team. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve is a nice guy who can do some things well," Dick Steinberg, the New York 
Jets' general manager, said last summer. "You just shouldn't expect to win 
championships with such a quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson and Schottenheimer, however, quietly got nice-guy DeBerg some more 
help just before the season, when they brought in free-agent fullback Barry 
Word. 
</P>
<P>
And in Kansas City's winter weather, the Raiders became the latest to learn 
what that kind of help means to a journeyman quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
As a ballcarrier, Word, 6 feet 2 and 225 pounds, is so skilled that he has 
moved Christian Okoye to the bench -- the same Okoye who led the NFL in rushing 
just a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
When the Chief-Raider game was on the line, Schottenheimer used Word as his 
principal weapon, even on passing downs, converting Okoye into a short-yardage 
rusher. 
</P>
<P>
As a 1-2 punch in the critical fourth quarter, Word and Okoye, with DeBerg 
handing off, were too much for the Raider defense. 
</P>
<P>
Coming in fresh on third-and-one plays, Okoye, a 260-pound giant, had the speed 
to get to the outside if the hole closed down. 
</P>
<P>
So who must the Raiders fear now in the second half of the season? 
</P>
<P>
DeBerg. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana, the apparently invincible San Francisco 49er quarterback, threw 
two fourth-quarter touchdown passes to pull out another one Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it was his second-quarter comeback that looked decisive. With Green Bay 
in a 10-0 lead 38 seconds before halftime, Montana crossed 61 yards on three 
passes, reducing the Packer lead to three points and regaining the momentum for 
the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
That didn't surprise Leonard Koppett. A veteran editor and researcher for the 
Bay Area's Peninsula Times Tribune, Koppett, writing in the New York Times last 
week, said the secret to Montana's majestic record is his second-quarter 
offense, not his famous fourth-quarter offense. 
</P>
<P>
"In 54 of (their last) 114 games -- almost half -- the 49ers have scored within 
the last two minutes of the first half," Koppett noted, adding that they've won 
88, or 78%, of the 114. 
</P>
<P>
"The real measure of their two-minute drill is their (first-half) success. A 
score just before intermission can change the dynamics, tactics and morale of 
the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"In a close contest, more often than not, victory is nailed down at the end by 
the defense. But at halftime, making the most of an opportunity to add points 
is often the key to victory." 
</P>
<P>
Ask the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
Quote Department: 
</P>
<P>
Donald Shipley, Washington judge and Redskin fan, ordering prosecutors to set 
an early trial date for Ricky Sanders, the Redskin wide receiver arrested in an 
assault case: "Mr. Sanders doesn't want to have this bearing on his mind as he 
heads for the Super Bowl."

<P>
Ram cornerback Mickey Sutton, scheduled to undergo arthroscopic surgery on his 
left knee today, is expected to be sidelined for at least a month. 
</P>
<P>
Complicating the picture in the secondary, the status of injured cornerback 
Jerry Gray remains a question. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not looking for any miracles right now," Coach John Robinson said of 
Gray, who did not play Sunday because of a sore left knee. "You keep hoping 
that all of a sudden the Pro Bowl cornerback would come back. But that just 
hasn't happened. Until he can come back in good fashion, we just can't press 
him. We will just have to take that day by day." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams hope to shore up their secondary losses with Darryl Henley, who on 
Sunday made a successful comeback from a hip injury. Also, Clifford Hicks, who 
has been the physically unable to perform list all season with a knee injury, 
might be available. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson continued to be vague about when he plans to activate running back 
Marcus Dupree from the injured-reserve list. "At some point," Robinson said. 
With Sutton out, there will be an open roster spot for Dupree this week, if 
Robinson chooses to use it that way. TIM KAWAKAMI

In five games as USC's starting tailback, sophomore Mazio Royster has rushed 
for 642 yards and six touchdowns in 119 carries, averaging 128.4 yards a game 
and 5.4 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's 31-31 tie against California, he ran for 175 yards and two 
touchdowns in 24 carries, averaging 7.3 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Royster needs to average 72.5 yards in USC's last four games, including a 
probable bowl appearance, to become the first Trojan sophomore to rush for 
1,000 yards since 1977, when Charles White rushed for 1,478. 
</P>

The starting time for USC's game against Oregon State Saturday at Corvallis,

</P>
<P>
The Ryder Cup, played every two years between teams from the United States and 
Europe, is held by the European team. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Schofield, executive director of the European Tour, said most major 
differences over money and organization have been resolved, but a stumbling 
block appears to be a PGA suggestion that the agreement should be reviewed in 
12 years.

THE PREPS: DORSEY REMAINS ONE STEP FROM SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

When Dorsey High moved from the City 3-A Division to the 4-A Division's Pacific 
League in 1984, no one gave the Dons' football program much of a chance to 
prosper. With perennial powers Carson and Wilmington Banning in the same 
league, Dorsey finished with a 2-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
The Dons improved over the next three seasons, in which they were 20-11 
overall, but they continued to have problems with Carson and Banning, losing 
all seven meetings against them. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey co-coaches Paul Knox and Eugene McAdoo thought they could solve the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We definitely did not feel that we were at the level of Carson and Banning 
when we first moved into their league," said Knox, who became coach along with 
McAdoo in 1985. "We knew we could match up with them at the skilled positions, 
but we also knew that we had to upgrade our interior lines. We struggled at 
first, until we got things going." 
</P>
<P>
An indication of Dorsey's rapid improvement is that the Dons play host to 
Carson Friday night with a share of the Pacific League title on the line. 
Dorsey defeated Carson, 26-15, last season to win its first major division City 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey's progress has come over several years. Guided by assistant coach Darryl 
Holmes, the Dons were first able to gain respect by improving their play on the 
line. That was evident two years ago, in the City semifinals, when Dorsey led 
Carson at halftime before losing. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Dorsey was considered one of the teams to beat, and with this 
distinction came surprises. Instead of searching out players to compete against 
Carson and Banning, Dorsey had quality players, such as wide receiver Keyshawn 
Johnson and kicker Adrian Villareal, transfer to the school. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who played last season at Palisades, and Villareal, who played at 
Carson, have keyed the offense for Dorsey, the Times' third-rated City team 
with a 7-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought that we would have a good team this year, but they have helped us 
have a chance to win a league title," Knox said. "They have been a big addition 
to our program." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 6 feet 3, 185 pounds, has caught 24 passes for 587 yards and five 
touchdowns. His 38-yard reception helped lead to Dorsey's go-ahead touchdown in 
a 21-14 victory over Granada Hills earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson played for Palisades last year, when he started as a defensive back, 
before moving back into the Dorsey area to live with relatives last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Knox was introduced to Johnson last summer during a passing league practice. 
</P>
<P>
"He basically just showed up at our practice and started hanging around," Knox 
said. "He is a cousin of one of our players, and he told me that he was moving 
to the area. He kept coming until we started putting him in, and he's been with 
us ever since." 
</P>
<P>
While Johnson was hanging around the Dorsey practice field, Villareal was 
already attending summer school at Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
"(Villareal) just showed up in school," Knox said. "I didn't know a thing about 
him coming here until after he started attending summer school." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Villareal was a backup kicker for Carson, where the starter was 
his twin brother, Aaron. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Dorsey's recent success, Knox still considers Carson the best program 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just not at the point where Carson is," he said. "Right now, we just 
can't come and line up and be dominant every year. Those are the last touches 
to come." 
</P>
<P>
It is a weekend of big football games, with three showdowns slated for Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Carson, The Times' top-rated City team, will try to avenge last season's 
championship loss to Dorsey. Carson (7-1) will be led by John Walsh, who with 
2,843 yards passing is on pace to break the national prep record of 4,179 
yards. Walsh passed for 388 yards and five touchdowns in the Colts' 47-0 
victory over San Pedro and has 31 touchdown passes this year. Dorsey (7-1) 
bounced back from its loss to Banning two weeks ago by defeating Narbonne, 
37-4. 
</P>
<P>
In the Southern Section, Los Angeles Loyola (8-1) will play for a share of the 
Division I Angelus League title when the Cubs travel to La Puente Bishop Amat 
(7-1). A Loyola victory, along with a Santa Ana Mater Dei victory over St. John 
Bosco, creates a three-way tie for first place. A Loyola victory and a Mater 
Dei loss would give the Cubs the title. Loyola will be led by Corby Smith, who 
has passed for 888 yards, and Matt Vanis, who has rushed for 913 yards. Bishop 
Amat will be led by the backfield tandem of fullback Jason Patterson and 
tailback Scott Fields. 
</P>
<P>
In a long-awaited showdown of unbeaten teams, Rialto Eisenhower will travel to 
Fontana to decide the Citrus Belt League title. Fontana, The Times' top 
Southern Section team and defending Division I champion, has a 23-game winning 
streak. The Steelers defeated Riverside Poly, 50-0, last Friday. Eisenhower 
moved up to second in The Times' poll from No. 4 after defeating Redlands, 
28-0. 
</P>
<P>
Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
Montclair Prep of Van Nuys clinched the Southern Section Division X Alpha 
League football title Saturday with a 20-7 victory over Sun Valley Village 
Christian. The Mounties (6-3) have won five in a row after losing three of 
their first four games. Montclair Prep struggled early in the season after 
cousins Derek and Leland Sparks transferred to Santa Ana Mater Dei. Running 
back Eliel Swinton has filled the gap left by Derek Sparks. Swinton, a 
sophomore, has 1,381 yards rushing in 194 carries and 18 touchdowns. . . . 
Mission Viejo (8-1) jumped from No. 12 to No. 5 in The Times' Southern Section 
poll after its 21-9 victory over previously undefeated El Toro Friday night. El 
Toro (8-1) dropped from No. 2 to No. 9. . . . Bell, which made its debut in The 
Times' City poll at No. 10, may be the hottest 3-A City team right now. The 
Eagles, who upset Locke, 33-0, Friday, have won four in a row by a combined 
score of 110-6. . . . Crenshaw basketball guard Kevin Ollie has made an oral 
commitment to attend the University of Connecticut.

DECLINING OIL PRICES BOOST DOW BY 11.39

<TEXT>
<P>
A sharp fall in oil prices and solid gains in the Treasury bond market pushed 
Wall Street stocks higher Monday, overriding investor fears about the weak 
state of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index closed up 11.39 at 2,502.23. In the broader 
market, advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 9 to 5 in nationwide 
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,029 up, 547 down and 
425 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume came to 147.51 million shares, down from 168.70 million 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The key catalyst to Monday's gains -- which topped a solid rally last week -- 
was the price of oil, which tumbled on signs that inventories remain high 
despite the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The December crude oil contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange tumbled 
$2.04 to $31.96 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
"Equities are up in relation to the break in crude oil," said Jack Solomon, a 
technical analyst at Bear Stearns. 
</P>
<P>
Stronger Treasury bonds also propelled Wall Street.

<P>
Traders said continued interest in financial services stocks also helped lift 
the 30-share index. 
</P>
<P>
Hopes that "there will be a further infusion of funds by the Federal Reserve" 
bolstered that sector, said Solomon. 
</P>
<P>
Expectations of lower interest rates have been sparked by the weak state of the 
economy, which may prompt the Fed to make money cheaper to borrow in an effort 
to spur growth. 
</P>
<P>
But, Solomon warned, the financial services sector remains a trouble spot. 
"Nothing fundamental has changed. This is a technical rebound from selling 
overkill," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley Turner, chairman of McDonald &amp; Co.'s investment policy committee, 
said, "It's also a technically based rally. . . . We (the Dow) crossed back 
over the 2,500 area, and that had a certain psychological impact on the 
market." 
</P>
<P>
After an advance of nearly 55 points last week, "we'd been looking for some 
correction this morning," said Robert Walberg, an analyst at MMS International. 
"When we didn't get that, it encouraged some buyers to return." 
</P>
<P>
And while a weak dollar was a deterrent -- it hit a new low versus the German 
mark -- Wall Street chose to focus on the oil and bond markets, ignoring 
foreign exchange traders' concerns about the stumbling economy. 
</P>
<P>
But investors still kept an eye out for trouble down the road, looking to 
Tuesday's congressional elections and this week's record auction of new 
Treasury bills, notes and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Wachtel, a market analyst at Prudential-Bache, said the market must 
overcome the congressional elections, the Treasury's $34.25-billion auction and 
any bad news out of the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Gainers among financial stocks included Federal National Mortgage, up 7/8 to 
30 1/8; BankAmerica Corp., up 1 1/2 to 21 7/8; American International Group, 
ahead 2 1/2 to 69 3/8; Manufacturers Hanover, up 7/8 to 18 1/2; J. P. Morgan, 
ahead 1 1/8 to 40 1/8, and C&amp;S-Sovran, up 1/8 to 16 as the most active Big 
Board issue. 
</P>
<P>
* Among other prominent financial issues, Federal Home Loan Mortgage gained 1 
1/2 to 37 3/4; Kemper Corp. advanced 5/8 to 19 1/2, and Travelers Corp. rose 
1/2 to 14 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Shares of Neiman Marcus dropped 1 7/8 to 12 3/4 after General Cinema withdrew 
its $14.40-a-share offer for the 16.4 million shares it does not already own. 
</P>
<P>
* Square D Co.'s shares jumped 2 7/8 to 47 7/8 on rumors it may be a takeover 
candidate, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
* The stock of Norstan Inc. fell 2 1/8 to 6 3/8 after the company said 
second-quarter earnings would be lower than expected. 
</P>
<P>
* GTE Corp. said its proposed merger with Contel Corp. may not go ahead until 
the second quarter of 1991 because of the lengthy regulatory process. GTE's 
stock dropped 1 1/4 to 28 1/4, and Contel fell 1 3/8 to 33 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
* Shares of Eagle-Picher Industries Inc. gained 1 7/8 to 3 3/4. The company 
said it expects a settlement within 30 days of litigation over its 
asbestos-containing insulation products. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices posted slight gains Monday on the Tokyo Stock Exchange as the 
Middle East situation coupled with U.S. developments robbed the market of 
virtually all activity. 
</P>
<P>
The key Nikkei index of 225 selected shares, which fell 100.17 points Friday, 
rebounded 190.34 points to 24,385.33. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices also finished higher on London's Stock Exchange, boosted by a 
buoyant performance on Wall Street late Friday. The Financial Times 100-share 
index was up 19.4 points, or 1%, at 2,050.1. 
</P>
<P>
German share prices closed mixed in quiet trading, as a lack of follow-up 
orders erased moderate gains recorded at the start of trading. The 30-share DAX 
finished 0.63 points higher at 1,414.95. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT: Bond Prices Rise on Inflation News 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices jumped on signs of waning inflation, buoying the credit markets 
just as they were bracing to absorb a glut of new Treasury debt from a 
record-size auction. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose 13/16 point, or $8.13 per $1,000 in 
face amount. Its yield, which falls when prices rise, eased to 8.62% from 8.70% 
late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The rise in bond prices warmed investors the day before the government was 
about to start pumping a record $34.25 billion of new securities into the 
credit markets, possibly saturating demand. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the first day of the government's quarterly refunding, the Treasury will 
sell $12.5 billion in three-year notes. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a wild day, a very good day for the market on the eve of three 
important auctions," said Scott Winningham, money market analyst at Scott &amp; 
McCarthy Research Associates Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Bond traders bought aggressively Monday after the release of a key index that 
showed a widespread decline in commodity prices to their lowest level in nearly 
a year. The Commodity Research Bureau's index, a measure of 21 commodities, 
fell 1.9 to 227.50. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of bonds and notes were also nudged up by falling oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
Lower inflation rates can put pressure on the Fed to ease interest rates, which 
can increase the value of securities such as bonds and make them a more 
enticing investment. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 7.938%, up from 7.875% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES: Fading Sales Hopes Hit Soybean Futures 
</P>
<P>
Soybean futures prices sagged to new three-month lows Monday on the Chicago 
Board of Trade amid disappointment over export sales and perceptions that 1990 
U.S. soybean production will exceed expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Grain futures finished mixed. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, oil futures fell sharply; precious metals rose; 
coffee was down; livestock futures were mixed, and pork bellies soared.

Japan's Emperor Akihito will formally ascend the Chrysanthemum Throne next 
Monday in an ancient rite to be witnessed by Vice President Dan Quayle and 
dignitaries from 156 other countries. 
</P>
<P>
Akihito technically became emperor in January, 1989, upon the death of his 
father, Hirohito. But Monday's ceremony is part of an ancient set of rites that 
celebrate the new emperor and the nation following a period of official 
mourning. 
</P>
<P>
A second, deeply religious and controversial Shinto rite enthronement ceremony 
closed to foreigners is to follow on Nov. 22.

<P>
A series of official functions, including a plenary session in the old 
Reichstag building of the German Parliament's upper house, will mark Friday's 
first anniversary of the collapse of the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
In the 12 months since the announcement echoed around the world, much of the 
wall has been completely removed, and within months the remnants are expected 
to disappear. 
</P>
<P>
Friday is also the anniversary of Crystal Night -- the 1938 attacks by Nazis

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The German chancellor called it a special responsibility of his generation. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet president described it simply as realpolitik. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the description, those who crowded into the stuffy little auditorium 
in the northern Caucasus spa town of Zheleznovodsk on July 16 and heard 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev report on results of 
their two-day meeting knew they had witnessed history. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union and Germany -- Europe's biggest power and its richest -- had 
with chilling suddenness buried half a century of bitter differences that had 
dragged them through Europe's bloodiest war and estranged them during a 
prolonged, uneasy peace. 
</P>
<P>
From a thinly disguised fear of German revanchism, Moscow had embraced the 
inevitability of German reunification as a cornerstone of "the new political 
order" that Gorbachev is counting on so heavily. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, the door has opened to a new and hugely important relationship 
-- as rich in potential as it is loaded with uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
"We stem from different parts of global civilization, but we feel that we 
belong together," Gorbachev explained to those listening in Zheleznovodsk. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone witnessing the champagne and euphoria that filled the chancellor's 
aircraft as it winged its way home from the Caucasus last July would be left 
with little doubt that Kohl believed the same. 
</P>
<P>
How these two nations manage this new beginning will do much to influence the 
future shape of a continent in the midst of greater change that at any time in 
nearly two centuries. 
</P>
<P>
If it succeeds, analysts believe that the new relationship could become the key 
element in overcoming the economic and political differences of Europe's long 
East-West division. Failure would likely deepen them further. 
</P>
<P>
"Germany is a huge force in the center of Europe," Soviet Foreign Minister 
Eduard A. Shevardnadze told the Supreme Soviet last month. "The future of 
Europe largely depends on how we relate to this giant." 
</P>
<P>
History and the weight of numbers alone make Shevardnadze's assessment hard to 
reject. 
</P>
<P>
Including the Soviet Union's Asian mass, the two nations account for half of 
Europe's population and nearly half of its total production. Together, they 
have a land area twice that of Europe alone. 
</P>
<P>
Later this month, Gorbachev is expected to make his first trip to the newly 
united Germany and sign a 20-year Soviet-German treaty of "good-neighborliness, 
partnership and cooperation" that will act as a framework for the new ties. 
</P>
<P>
Rich and warm in its language, the treaty symbolizes the historical watershed. 
</P>
<P>
"With this treaty there will be a partnership, and that is fundamentally new," 
said Valentin M. Falin, secretary of the Soviet Communist Party Central 
Committee and Gorbachev's principal adviser on German policy. "And we will be 
serious partners, economically and politically." 
</P>
<P>
Added another foreign policy specialist at the Central Committee: "We decided 
on friendship. Now we are waiting, rather expectantly, to see what that 
friendship brings." 
</P>
<P>
So are many others. 
</P>
<P>
The direction and intensity of this new German-Soviet relationship remains one 
of the biggest question marks in a fast-changing European order -- its future 
as uncertain as that of the Soviet Union itself. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, great potential is there. 
</P>
<P>
As the Soviet empire lurches from crisis to crisis, it is the economically 
strong, politically resurgent Germany that seems to have the most of what 
Moscow so desperately needs if it is to survive as a stable nation. 
</P>
<P>
With a trade volume of $34 billion last year, Germany is already the Soviets' 
largest trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
In a new political climate, German deutsche marks, not Soviet missiles, have 
become more immediately relevant to the preservation of Moscow's empire. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, Germany has pledged more than 20 billion marks (about $13 
billion) to the Soviets in one form or another. 
</P>
<P>
German loans last summer -- among them a $3-billion bank credit that 
constituted the single largest transaction of its kind ever extended to the 
Soviet Union -- were essential in ensuring the smooth flow of imports necessary 
to keep key sectors of the Soviet economy from total collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Given domestic political uncertainties in the Soviet Union, little time has 
been spent trying to assess the long-range potential of Soviet-German trade. 
However, Heinrich Machowski, an analyst at the German Economic Institute in 
Berlin, speculates that overall Soviet trade potential could eventually triple, 
with Germany getting more than its share of the increase. 
</P>
<P>
Bonn and Moscow now also share more common political goals than any other two 
nations across Europe's old East-West divide. 
</P>
<P>
A stable Soviet Union, well integrated into Europe, is accepted along the Rhine 
as essential for Germany's own prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
Noting the 600,000 Soviet military and civilian personnel still remaining in 
eastern Germany and the growing emigration pressures among the 2-million-strong 
German minority in the Soviet Union, a senior Foreign Ministry official in Bonn 
said: "We have a vested, almost material interest in what happens in the Soviet 
Union. If there are problems there, we'd feel it physically." 
</P>
<P>
Moscow has already benefitted from these shared interests. 
</P>
<P>
Both Kohl and German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher were key figures 
in breaking down American resistance to institutionalizing the 35-nation 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe -- the only platform in which 
all Europeans, including the Soviet Union, plus the United States and Canada 
are represented. 
</P>
<P>
The decision eased Moscow's worries of being shut out of a new Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Germans speak of Europe, they include the Soviet Union as part of 
it," Genscher said. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl was also instrumental in winning a European Community commitment to 
provide financial help for the Soviet reforms and in pushing through softer 
language on Western alliance nuclear doctrine that makes nuclear arms "weapons 
of last resort." 
</P>
<P>
"There's more interest in Germany than in any other Atlantic Alliance country 
to integrate the Soviet Union into the European order and stabilize its 15 
republics," summed up Fred Oldenburg, an analyst at Germany's Federal Institute 
of East European and International Affairs in Cologne. "That is a fact now and 
will be for the next five to 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from new political imperatives, personal chemistry between German and 
Soviet leaders has helped accelerate the pace of change. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl has recovered from his initial blunder of comparing Gorbachev to Nazi 
propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels and has now established what one aide calls 
a "strong and very positive" relationship with the Soviet leader. 
</P>
<P>
During their historic talks in July, Kohl became the first Western leader 
invited to Gorbachev's home region of Stavropol. 
</P>
<P>
About two-dozen Genscher-Shevardnadze meetings so far this year have also built 
a mutual respect among the two foreign ministers that goes beyond professional 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
Genscher's gesture last June of placing a wreath at the grave of 
Schevardnadze's 21-year-old brother, Akaki, killed in the Soviet city of Brest 
during the first hours of Nazi Germany's 1941 invasion the Soviet Union, is 
seen as a measure of this respect. 
</P>
<P>
However, despite the infusion of goodwill and intensity of mutual interest, 
hard realities and age-old suspicions seem bound to limit relations between 
Europe's two giants. 
</P>
<P>
The Germany of the Iron Chancellor Otto von Bismarck that wove the Three 
Emperors' Alliance together with Russia and Austria, or the post-World War I 
Germany, whose overtures to Moscow ended their mutual isolation with the 1922 
Treaty of Rapallo, are more than outweighed by the deceptions, intrigues and 
the blood of two world wars. 
</P>
<P>
For both Russians and Germans, it is a love-hate relationship of near-total 
cultural opposites, in which the overriding emotion tends to be a mixture of 
fascination and fear. 
</P>
<P>
"This country basically is afraid of Russia, but at the same time is attracted 
by its culture, its soul," noted Michael Stuermer, director of the Ebenhausen 
Institute near Munich, a government-funded foreign policy think tank. "This 
fundamental ambiguity goes back for centuries." 
</P>
<P>
Russian children at play rarely fight the Americans or Chinese in their 
make-believe conflicts. The enemy is invariably German. 
</P>
<P>
There are other problems, too. 
</P>
<P>
The seemingly near-perfect fit of Soviet and German economic interests is 
overshadowed by some compelling realities. 
</P>
<P>
The mounting chaos in the Soviet Union makes Moscow an increasingly uncertain, 
confused trading partner with shifting needs, declining incomes, slumping oil 
production and a sharply rising hard-currency debt that combine to cast doubts 
on its ability to pay. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, German economic strength has been sapped by the staggering 
costs of restructuring the country's eastern region and by the demands of other 
East European countries such as Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia, which also 
see Germany increasingly as their financial savior. 
</P>
<P>
"We had decided, even two years ago, to look to Germany, but so is everyone 
else," lamented a Soviet diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisory board chairman of the Deutsche Bank, Wilhelm Christians, may 
visit the old East Prussian port of Koenigsberg -- now renamed Kaliningrad and 
part of the Russian Federation -- and talk grandly about turning the military 
port into the Soviets' first international free-trade zone. But as he does, 
longstanding Soviet-German contracts are unraveling. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet exports to what was East Germany dropped 19% during the first half of 
1990, while East German exports dropped 4% during the same period as major 
change gripped both economies. 
</P>
<P>
Kersten Oschmann, a Soviet specialist at the German government-sponsored East 
European Trade Committee, noted in an interview that in the Ukraine alone, 
about 120 longstanding links between German suppliers and Soviet customers have 
either lapsed or are in danger of lapsing despite efforts to revive them in the 
short term. 
</P>
<P>
Overall trade is expected to decline before it grows again. 
</P>
<P>
Politically, the new German-Soviet ties are also limited, as much by other 
relationships as by the suspicions and fears of a troubled past. 
</P>
<P>
Although Moscow has begun to retreat from the global engagements of a 
superpower, its links with the United States remain the priority, at least as 
long as it holds broader responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
For Germany, it is only Bonn's firm anchor in the West -- in the Atlantic 
Alliance and the European Community -- that enables its leaders to lobby so 
effectively among its allies for Soviet interests. 
</P>
<P>
The nature of unification, a de facto West German takeover of the East, with 
the old West German leadership now ruling the reunited country with a few token 
former eastern Cabinet ministers, has eased traditional worries about any 
eastward German drift. 
</P>
<P>
The open, affluent Germany of 1990 about to sign a major treaty with Moscow is 
a far cry from the demoralized, outcast Germany of 1922 whose Rapallo treaty 
with the Soviet Union was seen as a conspiracy against the West by two 
powerful, but maverick, nations. 
</P>
<P>
German diplomats are also careful to note that, despite the reconciliation, 
distance between Bonn and Moscow remains. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a fine difference between what we're doing with our Western partners 
and what we're doing with the Soviet Union," explained one senior German 
diplomat. "We have friendship with (a country like) France, where there are 
shared democratic, cultural values. We want friendly relations with the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
"Soviets who talk freely admit that we are starting here, now, what we began 
with France 30 years ago," the diplomat added. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a series of potentially explosive trouble spots in the new 
relationship, including the continued Soviet troop presence in eastern Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts see the way in which these forces are withdrawn as a first major 
test of the new relationship. 
</P>
<P>
It is likely to be a sensitive task as morale sags among the low-paid, poorly 
treated Soviet troops and tempers shorten among eastern German residents now 
free to say what they really feel about their uninvited guests. 
</P>
<P>
Some commentators believe the inevitable friction can only fuel dangerous 
nationalistic emotions on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to demand a high degree of sensitivity and understanding . . . ," 
Genscher warned the German Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
O Added Machowski, the senior economist and Soviet analyst at the German 
Economic Institute here: "If it's done well, it can be a kind of 
confidence-building measure." 
</P>
<P>
Other issues, including treatment of the so-called Volga German minority in the 
Soviet Union, revelations of Stalinist atrocities in Germany during the early 
postwar years, and demands for compensation from Soviets used as slave labor in 
Nazi factories, all are potential flash points. 
</P>
<P>
Falin warned that claims for compensation could slow the upcoming Supreme 
Soviet's ratification of the treaty ending Moscow's World War II occupation 
rights in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever its eventual fate, few doubt that the success or failure of the new 
German-Soviet relationship will be pivotal in shaping the Continent's future. 
</P>
<P>
Many familiar with both countries agree with Falin's assessment that the new 
Soviet-German relationship "will likely be a central element of European 
developments, a central aspect of international affairs in the 21st Century . . 
. just as it was, very unfortunately, in the experience of the 20th Century." 
</P>
<P>
Parks reported from Moscow and Marshall reported from Bonn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Forging a New Relationship 
</P>
<P>
What the Soviets are getting from Germany: 
</P>
<P>
* More than $13 billion in direct financial help, including trade credits and 
grants. 
</P>
<P>
* A powerful voice in key Western institutions for additional multilateral 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
* A friendly, influential power working to prevent any attempt to isolate 
Moscow from the European mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
* A possible intermediary as Moscow seeks new links with other international 
organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
What the Germans are getting from the Soviet Union: 
</P>
<P>
* Unconditional approval for reunification on German terms. 
</P>
<P>
* The prospect of genuine security in the east. 
</P>
<P>
* The potential of a lucrative economic relationship that seems a perfect fit 
-- precision German industrial goods for a backward Soviet economy; Soviet oil 
and other raw materials for a Germany with no such natural wealth.

Ever since the celebrated French TGV high-speed train system opened its first 
line between Paris and Lyon nine years ago, it has been expanding 
full-throttle, clear-track ahead through the French countryside. 
</P>
<P>
The Paris-Lyon route was an instant success that cut the 290-mile travel time 
between the cities to two hours. Counting airport transportation and waiting 
times, even airlines could not compete with the new pride of French 
engineering. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, an even faster Atlantic TGV connecting Paris and Rennes opened in 
the west, setting an international speed record of 313 m.p.h. along the way. A 
southwest line to Bordeaux opened last month, cutting the travel time from 
Paris to the wine region to under three hours. Work is expected to be completed 
in 1993 on a North Europe line of the TGV system that will connect Paris to the 
rail tunnel being built under the English Channel. 
</P>
<P>
After Spain ordered TGV trains for its railroad system and other countries, 
including Australia and South Korea, showed strong interest, the train a grande 
vitesse seemed destined to join Champagne and perfume as one of those French 
items the rest of the world covets. The TGV fueled the passionate dream of many 
French, including President Francois Mitterrand, that their country would 
become the rail transportation hub of the new "borderless" Europe envisioned 
for the end of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Until a serious anti-TGV environmental movement erupted here last summer, in 
fact, French railroad officials felt they were on a fast track to realize their 
futuristic dream of building a train system that will ultimately connect Paris 
and London in 2 hours 10 minutes; Paris to Frankfurt in 3 hours; Paris to 
Barcelona in 4 hours 45 minutes, and Paris to Turin, Italy, in 4 hours 50 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But here in sunny Provence, the rugged Mediterranean land lovingly captured in 
the rustic writings of Marcel Pagnol and on the canvasses of Impressionist 
artist Paul Cezanne, the TGV has suffered its first derailment. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout Provence and the neighboring lower Rhone River Valley, the TGV 
recently has faced serious resistance from agricultural, environmental and 
community organizations. The TGV opponents contend that the trains are too 
noisy, require too much land for their specially designed roadbeds and that 
they would disrupt the delicate agricultural economy of the region, 
particularly in densely populated and ecologically sensitive Provence. 
</P>
<P>
Several key lines, including routes to Barcelona and the French Riviera, are in 
limbo as a result of the movement. And the unexpected opposition has suddenly 
thrown into question the applicability of the fast-train concept, as developed 
by the French, for other regions of Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Could it be," asked Le Monde journalist Marc Ambroise-Rendu in a recent 
article that followed a wave of anti-TGV protests here, "that France's TGV, 
which is dreaming of conquering foreign markets, is a transport system designed 
for vast characterless tracts of land, but quite unsuitable to the picturesque 
and vulnerable settings of rural areas?" 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem involves basic physics. To operate at full-speed, the TGV 
trains require their own tracks. Because of speeds averaging near 200 m.p.h., 
they require much gentler bends than other trains, and are unable to follow the 
contours of the land as did the old trains. 
</P>
<P>
This engineering handicap was not such a problem in the relatively flat 
farmlands of northern and western France where the initial lines were 
constructed. But in the densely farmed lower Rhone Valley and in Provence, 
where natural landmarks abound, it posed more difficult challenges. 
</P>
<P>
The most controversial spur of the proposed TGV Mediterranean route would cut 
through the rugged countryside east of the Roman city of Aix-en-Provence, 
traverse a forest that is home to a rare European eagle and skirt the northern 
edge of Montagne Sainte Victoire, the humped-back white mountain that was 
painted so often by Cezanne that it became the very symbol of Provence. Picking 
up on the Cezanne theme, TGV opponents produced posters depicting streamlined 
TGV trains crashing through a Cezanne canvas. 
</P>
<P>
The objective of the French railroad management in constructing this route is 
to cut the train trip from Paris to the Riviera resort city of Nice to four 
hours from the current seven. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Provence who oppose the project contend that the three-hour saving 
for the convenience of Paris tourists is not worth the damage the new line 
would cause to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"I am revolted by the idea of such an absurd project," said Gerard Perrier, 43, 
leader of CARDE, an umbrella group of 35 organizations opposed to the proposed 
TGV project here. "So much waste just to save a little bit of time!" 
</P>
<P>
The anti-TGV movement in Provence has emerged as the first important 
environmental campaign in France since a wave of anti-nuclear protests in the 
early 1970s. "The big success of this movement," said Robert Celaire, 35, an 
environmental engineer in Lambesc, a farming town in northern Provence, "has 
been to bring together environmental groups with elected officials." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of lining up outside French railroad offices and begging for a station, 
as was the case in northern France, many elected officials in the south, 
spurred by angry farmers and homeowners who do not want high-speed trains 
roaring through their land, find themselves on the other side of the tracks. 
Celaire said the CARDE movement has gained the support of 35 mayors, National 
Assembly deputies and senators from the region. The TGV figures to be an issue 
in local elections set for next year. 
</P>
<P>
The intensity and bitterness of the anti-TGV movement caught the French 
national railroad company, Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer, by surprise. 
Managed by an elite cadre of engineers -- most of them graduates of the two 
famous Paris engineering schools, Ecole Polytechnique and Ecole Centrale -- the 
SNCF is accustomed to having its right of way. 
</P>
<P>
Among the basic demands of CARDE is that the French railroad company be 
required to conduct detailed environmental impact studies of the proposed 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation Minister Michel Delebarre tried to diffuse the anger of TGV 
opponents -- who range in the political spectrum from pear planters to 
landscape artists -- by naming a special commission to investigate complaints 
and explore alternate routes. The report of the commission, directed by veteran 
politician Max Querrien, is expected this month. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, however, the movement against the proposed Mediterranean TGV route 
has intensified since Delebarre appointed the commission in early August. 
Nearly every weekend, anti-TGV demonstrators block key rail lines, resulting in 
long delays on regional rail routes. On several occasions demonstrators have 
chained themselves to tracks, occupied stations and engaged in pitched battles 
with police, resulting in injuries on both sides of the barricades. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the protests, French railroad officials insist that their TGV trains 
are environmentally sound, even better than other forms of transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, experience shows the TGV lines cut a swath nearly as big as an 
interstate highway through the countryside, dividing farms and subjecting 
homeowners to decibel levels considerably higher (97 decibels compared to 92 
decibels at a distance of 80 yards) than traditional trains. 
</P>
<P>
At first SNCF management appealed to the nationalism of the citizens who would 
be affected by the new TGV lines to try and soften the blow. 
</P>
<P>
But the argument has not impressed affected residents such as Mariette 
Cuvellier, 43, a school principal who lives near the Rhone River city of 
Montelimar and who heads an active association of private homeowners along the 
proposed route between Valence and Avignon. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in Paris think we are a bunch of crazy hicks to oppose the TGV," 
she said during a recent interview. "They say we should be thinking about 
France -- about greater Europe. They want us to kneel down in their path like 
the old-time peasants. But there are 10,000 people living in this valley. We 
don't want to live in a universe of noise, sandwiched between the autoroute and 
the TGV."

THE LITTLE AIRLINE THAT COULD;

SINGAPORE AIRLINES IS THE MOST PROFITABLE AIRLINE IN THE WORLD. THE FIRM'S 
SUCCESS SAYS MUCH ABOUT THE ISLAND NATION.

<TEXT>
<P>
Why would a country which is just 16 miles long and 24 miles wide need a huge 
airline? 
</P>
<P>
If the country is Singapore, the answer is simple: vast amounts of foreign 
exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Singapore Airlines is the most profitable airline in the world, earning $625 
million last year. Fortune magazine ranked the airline, with its sales of about 
$2.6 billion, the seventh largest company in Asia outside of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the airline is now Singapore's largest employer, with more than 
20,000 workers. One of every 79 workers in the country works for the airline or 
one of its subsidiaries, which include a cargo handling company, a charter 
airline and airport services companies. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't start out thinking of ourselves as a big airline," the company's 
Managing Director Cheong Choong Kong said in an interview. "We set out to be a 
successful airline by making the best use of Singapore's strategic location." 
</P>
<P>
Although a majority of its shares are owned by the government, the airline 
hardly fits the image of the bloated state-run firm. Instead, it is an emblem 
of the qualities the island nation has striven to achieve: hard work, 
discipline, efficiency in the extreme. 
</P>
<P>
"The management and staff are unusually committed to the success of the 
venture," said a recent analysis by the Hong Kong stockbrokers Crosby 
Securities PTE. "This is a phenomenon which can be observed throughout 
Singapore, but clearly the airline has an advantage over its international 
competitors." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Singapore Airlines is regularly ranked among the top two or three 
airlines in the world in passenger preference surveys because of its on-time 
record and high quality of in-flight service. It has the newest fleet of any 
airline, with the average age of its aircraft at just four years, 10 months. 
(The firm has another 22 Boeing 747-400 jumbo jets on order and has options on 
21 more.) 
</P>
<P>
The airline has increased its profits every year since it was founded in 1972, 
when it was spun off from the Malaysian airline, though this year may see the 
first profit slowdown in its history. Last week, Singapore Airlines reported a 
12.7% drop in after-tax profits for the first six months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Darrington, of Crosby Securities, attributed this year's profit decline 
to the huge fuel price increase faced by all airlines because of the situation 
in the Persian Gulf, a major appreciation in the value of the Singapore dollar 
-- with no domestic flights, most of its income is earned in foreign currency 
-- and a dip in its average load factor to 76%. 
</P>
<P>
Singapore Airlines enjoys benefits that American carriers do not have, so that 
comparisons are not fair. Airline fares in Asia are set by governments, so 
there is little competition, and capacity increases only with demand. 
</P>
<P>
Because Singapore is so small, the airline has no domestic routes -- unlike 
neighbors MAS in Malaysia and Garuda in Indonesia, which are required by their 
respective governments to subsidize domestic fares. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the airline, the Singapore government has made the country's Changi 
airport into a paradigm of efficiency, with a second terminal opening this 
month to double capacity and work starting later this year on a third terminal. 
In contrast, Hong Kong's airport is past the saturation point, and a new 
airport is at least a decade away. 
</P>
<P>
According to Cheong, another big marketing strategy is the recent decision to 
exchange shares with Delta Air Lines in the United States, to gain access to 
the airline's domestic route network, and with Swissair, another airline 
renowned for its high standard of service. 
</P>
<P>
"Swissair and Delta are a lot like us," Cheong said. "We are expecting greater 
benefits of the synergy of the three airlines." He said that where they 
compete, the airlines will continue to face each other head-on, but they 
anticipate achieving substantial savings with such things as shared maintenance 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Singapore has yet to make much of an inroad into the U.S. market, flying only 
to Honolulu, Los Angeles and San Francisco. The next gateway that officials 
hope for is New York, flying by way of Amsterdam. But the U.S. government has 
not yet granted permission on this heavily traveled route. 
</P>
<P>
The airline has recently encountered difficulties keeping trained personnel, 
since technical workers can earn up to $1,500 more a month in Japan. Even the 
"Singapore Girls" of advertising fame, who are forced to retire from cabin crew 
work in their mid 30s, have been increasingly dropping out after their first 
five-year contract to get married or take more lucrative jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Singapore is also running a bit behind in the technology "war" with its 
competitors. Though it was the first to offer such inducements as free 
in-flight movies, British Airways is several months ahead on offering 
individual movie screens to long-haul passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Singapore plans to fight back with in-flight telephones and fax machines.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bittersweet scent of raw cocoa awaiting shipment overseas still permeates 
the huge lagoon-side port district here, a reminder that this is the commodity 
that created Africa's most stunning economic success story. 
</P>
<P>
But a few miles away in the business district known as "The Plateau," the 
windows of a top-floor office are sealed shut and the air conditioning is on 
full blast, the better to obliterate the chocolaty smell that symbolizes how 
reliance on a single major crop also came close to destroying the country. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't continue to be a cocoa economy," says Alassane D. Ouattara, 48, now 
in his eighth month as economic czar of the Ivory Coast. 
</P>
<P>
In that time Ouattara, a native Ivorian with international banking credentials, 
has turned Ivory Coast into a closely watched laboratory of Western economic 
prescriptions for struggling African countries. 
</P>
<P>
In a virtual blitzkrieg against the country's old, hidebound economy, Ouattara 
has laid off excess government workers and cut bureaucratic costs with a 
determination that would shame, say, the U.S. Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, he negotiated to turn over Ivory Coast's huge state-owned 
electrical utility to a subsidiary of the French industrial giant Bouygues, the 
first decisive step in what is likely to be the largest program in Africa to 
privatize a state-dominated economy. 
</P>
<P>
"By African standards, he's moving by absolute lightning speed -- even by world 
standards," says one leading international banker in admiration. 
</P>
<P>
Handed presidential carte blanche to restructure a nation whose bureaucratic 
bloat and nonchalantly pervasive corruption resemble that of a boom town just 
past its prime, Ouattara may have one of the hardest jobs in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Ivory Coast was a forgotten backwater of the French empire when it received its 
independence in 1960, seemingly doomed to living in the shadow of rich 
neighbors like Ghana, which was then the economic and political heavyweight of 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
But its president, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, abjured the pan-Africanist and 
quasi-socialist policies of Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah. He invited foreign talent to 
live and work in his country and ordered a single-minded buildup of cocoa- and 
coffee-producing capacity. Within a few years Ivory Coast was rich, the world's 
leading cocoa producer. 
</P>
<P>
But the "Ivorian miracle" did not last. When cocoa prices slumped to 15-year 
lows in the 1980s, the economy followed them into the trough. 
</P>
<P>
By the beginning of 1990, after two years of overpaying farmers for their crops 
and trying to drive the world price back up by stockpiling cocoa, the country 
was more or less bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
A plan to tighten belts by slashing public workers' salaries and imposing an 
equivalent tax on private workers sent thousands of demonstrators into the 
streets of Abidjan last spring and sparked violent confrontations with police 
elsewhere. Houphouet-Boigny's 30-year-old reign was tottering. 
</P>
<P>
The president's answer was to put Ouattara in full charge. An urbane product of 
Ivorian, French and American schooling, his official title was to be president 
of the Interministerial Coordination Committee of the Stabilization and 
Economic Recovery Program; in essence, the president told him to do whatever 
was necessary to rescue the economy, as fast as he knew how. 
</P>
<P>
Ouattara says he took one look at the government's half-hearted recovery plans, 
"scrapped everything and started from zero." 
</P>
<P>
He canceled outright the pay cuts and new taxes. He moved to trim the public 
payroll by firing excess workers, cutting expenses and improving lax customs 
and tax collections. 
</P>
<P>
He closed 12 Ivorian embassies, including seven in Africa, and laid off 7,000 
of the country's 100,000 "temporary" public workers. The fleet of official 
government cars was slashed by a third, allowing Ouattara to put 4,000 
Mercedes-Benz and other vehicles on the block and producing great savings on 
auto insurance, maintenance and gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Ouattara claims to have been able to cut government spending by about 
$2.8 billion and to raise $120 million in new revenues. Ivory Coast's fiscal 
deficit has dropped from 18% of gross domestic product to 8%, and he expects to 
show a surplus in three years. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, Ivory Coast may be better equipped for a new economic surge than most 
of its West African neighbors: Its boom years financed construction of the 
region's best roads and telephone system, along with European-grade water 
supplies and electrical utilities. 
</P>
<P>
But cocoa also nurtured a culture of official corruption and favoritism on a 
scale that became widely visible only when the economy suddenly shrank, the way 
a receding tide exposes old shipwrecks to view. 
</P>
<P>
The net result is a government that hands out important business franchises to 
political favorites and remains deeply involved, to the country's detriment, in 
the economy. Today the state owns 140 separate enterprises, ranging from the 
phone company to a distributor of French wine, most of which are sloppily run 
by political favorites. These enterprises register losses every year in rough 
relation to the actual ratio of state ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1982 and 1988, Ouattara said, wholly state-owned enterprises showed a 
combined net loss of $340 million. Those in which the state owned at least 51% 
lost $40 million. But those in which the state was a minority owner made 
combined profits of $576 million. 
</P>
<P>
"This disparity indicates above all an insufficient grasp of financial and 
administrative management," Ouattara said, adding that his next move will be to 
arrange the sell-off of virtually all those state enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of the electrical utility to Bouygues -- actually a management 
contract that will eventually be transformed into an outright sale of assets -- 
will be followed by the sale of the state telephone system, potentially a major 
moneymaker, and the state's palm oil distribution company. Government stakes in 
local subsidiaries of Royal Dutch Shell and other oil companies are also for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
The top-down approach of offering the most alluring properties for sale first 
is designed to signal Ouattara's genuine determination to change the Ivorian 
system. It's in contrast to the standard African privatization program, which 
involves trying gingerly to sell off the most marginal companies first, 
producing a glut of unmarketable, broken-down railroads and steel mills. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, if you put all the dogs and turkeys on the table first, no one will 
buy them," remarks a prominent West African economist. 
</P>
<P>
That Ivory Coast's alternatives have drawn rare raves from the World Bank and 
the International Monetary Fund is not entirely surprising, given that in his 
program Ouattara is not only preaching to the choir: He is a former member of 
the choir. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Ouattara was the IMF's top officer for Africa, a job in which 
he had to persuade leaders of countries around the continent to take many of 
the steps he has taken now. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently he became governor of the French-financed Central Bank of West 
African States, a job that made him the central banker of seven former French 
colonies and put his signature on their jointly issued currency. (Ivory Coast 
accounts for about 60% of the seven combined economies.) 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Ouattara is keeping his job at the Central Bank and taking no pay from 
the Ivorian government. He handles both jobs from his top-floor office at the 
bank's grandiose new office building in Abidjan and flies from country to 
country in a private jet. 
</P>
<P>
He ignores many of the quick-fix economic strategies that waft across the 
African landscape. He rejected restrictions on moving capital out of the 
country, for example, recognizing that the difficulty of moving profits and 
capital abroad is a major constraint on outside investment in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"Those people who got their money out were being good economists," he said. "It 
means our policy wasn't right." Capital would stay in Ivory Coast if people 
thought they could make an adequate profit, he reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
He was similarly concise when his plan to privatize the electricity and 
telephone services in Ivory Coast was criticized as the sale to foreigners of 
"strategic" state assets. 
</P>
<P>
"The notion of a "strategic' sector is a false concept," he snapped back. 
</P>
<P>
With the president's strong backing and the financial support of the 
international community, Ouattara knows he has a window of opportunity to push 
his policies through before political opposition has a chance to jell. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is much reason to question how far Ouattara will be able to go 
before the entrenched interests in the Ivorian economy begin to fight back in 
earnest. For one thing, what he sees as fraud, corruption and patronage have 
been key elements in the governing style of his own patron, President 
Houphouet-Boigny. 
</P>
<P>
It is Houphouet-Boigny who appointed the managers of most of the 
under-performing state enterprises, and Houphouet-Boigny who has handed out the 
franchises and licenses that give political favorites the right to collect 
export fees and customs duties without doing a dime's worth of work. 
</P>
<P>
"Ouattara's credible right now because he's not part of the regime, of the 
gang, and he's getting results," says an international economist here. "But a 
lot of people are increasingly saying, 'He's touching on my interest.' There's 
no question that many who have lost because of him are going to try to put 
banana peels under his feet." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Balancing The Books 
</P>
<P>
Alassane D. Ouattara's belt-tightening program for Ivory Coast includes these 
steps: 
</P>
<P>
Selling the electrical utility, telephone system and palm oil distribution 
companies to private firms. 
</P>
<P>
Closing 12 Ivorian embassies. 
</P>
<P>
Laying off 7,000 public workers. 
</P>
<P>
Cutting the fleet of government vehicles by a third, in the process putting 
4,000 Mercedes-Benz and other vehicles on the block. 
</P>
<P>
Using these steps, Ouattara claims to have cut government spending by $2.8 
billion and raised $120 million in new revenues. The country's fiscal deficit 
has dropped from 18% of the gross domestic product to 8%.

TURNOUT BELOW 40% EXPECTED ACROSS NATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After all the polls, the commercials, the fund-raisers, flip-flops and cheap 
shots, the election is finally in the hands of the voters. 
</P>
<P>
But which voters will decide it? 
</P>
<P>
Experts are again predicting that less than 40% of the 186.4 million eligible 
Americans will make their way to the ballot box today, continuing a virtually 
uninterrupted 25-year slide in turnout. But that pattern could vary 
dramatically from state to state and between demographic groups -- with 
decisive partisan implications in some races. 
</P>
<P>
For Republican strategists in particular, turnout is a pressing concern: Polls 
have shown the GOP's standing eroding dangerously over the last month among 
senior citizens, who vote more heavily in midterm elections than younger 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the (downward) shifts you're seeing in President Bush's approval 
rating and in the GOP standing in generic questions of who you would vote for 
in Congress are happening among older voters," one Republican pollster said. 
"It's got to be a concern to the Republican Party when you don't have the 
compensating turnout among younger voters." 
</P>
<P>
Young voters have been a vital component of the GOP coalition for the last 
decade. But they are much more interested in flashy presidential contests than 
off-year congressional elections. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1986 midterm election, voters 18 to 24 years old came out at only half 
the rate they did in the 1988 presidential election. Put another way: In 1988, 
senior citizens were twice as likely to vote as young people; in the off-year 
of 1986 they were three times as likely. No other group falls off as 
dramatically in participation from presidential elections to midterm elections 
as young people. 
</P>
<P>
Some Republican strategists worry that disenchantment over President Bush's 
reversal of his no-new-taxes pledge may further discourage young people -- and 
other GOP partisans -- from turning out today. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, analysts say, senior citizens have been angered by the 
inclusion of Medicare cuts in the final budget package passed last month. In 
one recent Republican poll, over 80% of voters 65 and older said they 
considered the country to be on the wrong track. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Democratic appeals to economic fairness appear to be attracting older 
voters back into the fold. "The people in that age group are the last of the 
Truman- and Roosevelt-era Democrats," said the Republican pollster, "and, when 
you talk about Republicans and economic fairness, it strikes residual chords 
that just aren't there with the under-35 group." 
</P>
<P>
Shifting preferences among senior citizens could be an important factor in 
several races. 
</P>
<P>
In Texas, Democratic tracking polls have shown the party's gubernatorial 
nominee Ann Richards strengthening her position among seniors (as well as 
women). 
</P>
<P>
But, in Minnesota, Republican Sen. Rudy Boschwitz rushed out several hundred 
thousand pieces of mail to senior citizens and accused his Democratic opponent, 
Paul Wellstone, of advocating Medicare cuts. The barrage occurred after polls 
showed "slippage" by Boschwitz among older voters, one Republican source said. 
Although Democrats remain optimistic, Boschwitz has solidified his position 
with seniors and reopened a 9-point lead in public polls. 
</P>
<P>
Overall turnout is of less interest to the parties than to political 
scientists. But observers and practitioners alike are expecting a sparse 
showing today. Anything else would be a shock: Turnout in midterm elections 
sank below 40% in 1974 and has not resurfaced since. By contrast, off-year 
elections invariably drew more than 43% of eligible voters from 1948 through 
1970. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the strong anti-Washington mood visible in the electorate, few analysts 
are expecting Americans to break that historical pattern today in a fervor to 
clean house. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is that turnout . . . will not be very much different than the 36.4% 
of eligible voters that turned out in 1986, which was the lowest since 1942," 
said Curtis B. Gans, director of the Washington-based Committee for the Study 
of the American Electorate. 
</P>
<P>
Registration figures undergird that prediction. In 22 of 29 states surveyed 
last week by People for the American Way, a liberal Washington group, a smaller 
percentage of eligible voters was registered than in 1986. Several states -- 
including Oregon, Washington, Pennsylvania, and Maryland -- suffered steep 
declines; California, Florida, Ohio and Illinois fell off more modestly. The 
combined totals show a slight national decline from 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, like 1988, there were no significant voter registration efforts 
around the country," said Sanford Horwitt, director of the Citizen 
Participation Projection at People for the American Way. 
</P>
<P>
But Gans and other experts caution that turnout may rise in some states with 
closely fought races. 
</P>
<P>
Registration is up in North Carolina -- where Republican Sen. Jesse Helms faces 
Democrat Harvey Gantt, who is attempting to become the first black senator from 
the South since Reconstruction -- and the polls are expected to be crowded 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Registration is also up in Texas, the site of a compellingly lurid 
gubernatorial struggle between Richards and Republican Clayton W. Williams Jr. 
In Massachusetts, observers are expecting large numbers of voters to register 
their verdict on polarizing Democratic gubernatorial nominee John R. Silber in 
his campaign against Republican William F. Weld.

MILITANT RABBI KAHANE SLAIN BY N.Y. GUNMAN;

<P>
ASSASSINATION: THE RADICAL ZIONIST AND FOUNDER OF THE JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE HAD 
JUST GIVEN A SPEECH. ATTACKER IS WOUNDED AND CAPTURED.

<P>
Meir Kahane, the controversial founder of the militant Jewish Defense League 
and a fierce proponent of the expulsion of Arabs from Israeli territories, was 
shot to death after giving a speech here Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Kahane, 58, was answering questions from the audience of about 100 people when 
a man approached and shot him in the neck. He was pronounced dead at Bellevue 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The assassin was described by one witness as "smiling and looking strange" as 
he walked toward Kahane. Police said he pulled out a .357-caliber revolver and 
began firing. 
</P>
<P>
The assailant was later captured after being wounded in a gun battle with a 
postal policeman about a block from the hotel where Kahane was killed. The 
assassin was identified by police as El Sayyid A. Nosair, 35. He was listed in 
critical but stable condition at Bellevue early this morning. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe he (Nosair) lives in New Jersey," said chief of Detectives Joseph 
Borelli. "We are not sure he is an American citizen. I don't know if it's a 
political assassination. I'm just taking a homicide." 
</P>
<P>
Borelli said "we have witnesses in the room where the incident occured, and 
every indication is he was acting alone." 
</P>
<P>
Kahane, a former member of the Israel parliament, had been addressing a meeting 
of a group of his supporters. The event was advertised as the founding 
conference of Z.E.E.R.O. -- Zionist Emergency Evacuation Rescue Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Police Sgt. Mary Wrensen said Kahane was shot at 9:05 p.m. as he attended the 
conference on the second floor of the Marriott Halloran House in Midtown 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
"Kahane was answering questions when a young man walked up to him, smiling and 
looking strange, drew a gun and shot him in the head and body," one witness, 
Richard Dunetz told Reuters. "There were two shots." 
</P>
<P>
"All of sudden a shot rang out and my grandson pushed me down. I heard another 
shot. It looked like the gunman aimed straight for Kahane's head. He looked 
extremely bad," said Elca Weinman, another witness. 
</P>
<P>
After shooting Kahane, Nosair shot another man in the leg after he fled the 
room, police said. Nosair got into a taxicab and went about a block. As he left 
the cab he ran into Carlos Acosta, a uniformed postal policemen. Nosair fired 
at Acosta, but the bullet bounced off Acosta's bulletproof vest, police said. 
Acosta returned the fire, striking Nosair in the neck. 
</P>
<P>
Borelli said that Kahane had not requested any police protection. "We know very 
little at this point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Outside of Bellevue Hospital about a dozen Kahane supporters gathered in 
pouring rain. Two carried Israeli flags and held a brief memorial service at 
the door of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the final sacrifice," said Reuven Kahane, 23, a cousin of the murdered 
rabbi. "He's been receiving threats since day one." 
</P>
<P>
He said Kahane left a wife and four children in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"We came down to say a service, to sing a psalm for Rabbi Kahane," said one of 
his followers. 
</P>
<P>
Irv Rubin, national chairman of the Jewish Defense League, said Monday night in 
Los Angeles that he was "shocked and stunned" by Kahane's assassination. Rubin 
said Kahane had been expected in Los Angeles next week for speaking engagements 
to the Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
Kahane left the JDL in 1985 to pursue his political career in Israel, Rubin 
said, "and appointed me his successor. It's a very, very sad event. World Jewry 
has lost a very great leader. He left a different type of Jew to pursue his 
ideology which literally means that never again will Jews submissively go to 
their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
"The death of Meir Kahane will not stop the movement. The god of Israel will 
take vengeance on any Arab terrorist who wants to hurt Jews." 
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles said that while "we 
totally disapproved of (Kahane's) politics and rhetoric on the Middle East, we 
strongly condemn this deliberate act of terrorism . . . We call on the federal 
authorities to conduct a full investigation to ascertain if the heinous crime 
was the act of a lone gunman or part of a wider plot by Arab terrorists." 
Kahane was born in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn in 1932, the son of a 
fervently Zionist orthodox rabbi. He became a member of the Zionist youth group 
Betar, and at age 15 was arrested for throwing rocks at the limousine of the 
British foreign minister to protest British rule of Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
By the late 1950s, Kahane had obtained a rabbinical degree from Brooklyn's 
Mirrer Yeshiva and a degree in international law from New York University. 
</P>
<P>
He founded the Jewish Defense League in 1968, which he said was needed to 
counter growing anti-Semitism which he blamed on the black power movement. 
</P>
<P>
Its "Never Again" slogan, referring to the Nazi Holocaust, was a rallying cry 
for hundreds of young Jews. Kahane organized patrols on Halloween to keep 
hostile gangs from overturning gravestones in Jewish cemeteries. 
</P>
<P>
But the JDL soon ran afoul of the law and was accused of involvement in a 
series of violent anti-Soviet attacks. Kahane spent a year in jail for 
conspiring to make bombs. 
</P>
<P>
He moved to Israel with his wife and children permanently in 1971.

U.S. AND SAUDIS AGREE ON WHO WILL COMMAND GIS

JIDDA, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Saudi King Fahd reached a new 
military command and control agreement Monday guaranteeing that American troops 
will be under the command of American officers if they launch offensive 
operations against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Although operational details of the pact were not disclosed, the agreement 
seems to remove an obstacle that might have complicated a decision to use force 
against Iraq if U.N.-imposed economic sanctions do not force Baghdad to 
withdraw from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. Administration official said that U.S. and Saudi forces would be 
under "truly joint" command if their mission was defense of Saudi Arabia. But 
he said that if operations were conducted outside of the kingdom, American 
forces would be under American command. 
</P>
<P>
Military experts have been concerned about the problems of coordinating the 
multinational force in the gulf ever since it was assembled after Iraq's Aug. 2 
invasion of Kuwait. Some U.S. officials had expressed alarm at the possibility 
that Saudi commanders might interfere in American military operations. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration official said the U.S.-Saudi understanding does not affect 
the forces of other nations, except for those that had previously been placed 
under either American or Saudi command. He said Baker hopes to work out similar 
agreements with some of the other nations to clarify the command structure. 
</P>
<P>
However, the official said the United States and Saudi Arabia would have to 
reach a high-level political understanding before Saudi territory could be used 
as the launching pad for an attack. A senior Saudi official said that issue has 
not yet been addressed. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still genuinely hoping to see a peaceful outcome of this crisis," the 
Saudi official said. 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, he said, Washington and Riyadh agree that the emphasis will 
be on political and economic pressure and "anything beyond that, we'll cross 
that bridge when we get to it." 
</P>
<P>
"Increasing the political pressure beats the heck out of shooting," the Saudi 
official said. But he added: "The longer this goes on, the more we have to 
polish other options." 
</P>
<P>
Resolving the complicated command and control situation was one of Baker's top 
priorities in the Saudi stop on his seven-country, weeklong trip through the 
Persian Gulf and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Baker said the gulf crisis is "entering a new phase" that 
will require the United States and its allies to get ready for war. 
</P>
<P>
He did not spell out how long he believes the new phase would last, but he 
spoke to reporters after the exiled emir of Kuwait appealed for early action to 
return his government to power. 
</P>
<P>
"This crisis is entering a new phase, and while we are still seeking a 
peaceful, political and diplomatic solution, we have to, I think, put ourselves 
in a position where we would be prepared to exercise any options that might be 
available . . . (including) resort to force if that should be necessary," Baker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker met Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah, the deposed emir of Kuwait, in his 
exile capital, the Sheraton Hotel in the Saudi resort town of Taif, before 
flying to Jidda for his talks with Fahd. 
</P>
<P>
The senior Administration official said Baker had not intended to imply that 
the new phase was the last before the resort to force. But he said there is no 
question that the emphasis has shifted to preparing for war if peaceful methods 
fail to produce results. 
</P>
<P>
The exiled emir of Kuwait said it is up to the U.N. Security Council to decide 
how long to wait for the United Nations' trade embargo to force Iraq out of 
Kuwait before turning to more violent measures. But he added quickly: "What I 
would like to see is the liberation of Kuwait, whether through the Security 
Council or not. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like my country to be liberated today -- before tomorrow," he said 
during a brief photo session with Baker before the start of their private 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
A State Department official aboard Baker's aircraft said the emir pledged to 
provide additional economic support to the gulf operation if the crisis lasts 
into next year, as now seems virtually certain. 
</P>
<P>
The exiled government previously promised $5 billion, split nearly evenly 
between defraying the cost of the U.S. military operation and cushioning the 
economic impact of the trade embargo on front-line states like Turkey and 
Egypt. But that contribution covered only the final months of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Baker and the emir discussed Kuwait's contribution for next year, the 
official said: "Not in dollar terms, but Secretary Baker said, and the Kuwaitis 
agreed, that as this thing continues, they are going to probably have to come 
up with more contributions -- and they said yes." 
</P>
<P>
While the emir and Baker met with only a handful of aides, three members of the 
deposed Kuwaiti Cabinet talked to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Housing Minister Yahia al Sumait said that the master registry of Kuwaiti 
citizenship has been smuggled out of Kuwait and will soon be deposited with the 
United Nations in New York and Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi authorities have confiscated the identity papers of Kuwaitis who have 
been permitted to leave the country, leading to speculation that Iraq plans to 
obliterate all records of Kuwaiti citizenship and then repopulate the country 
with loyal Iraqis. 
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti Cabinet ministers also introduced to reporters, and later to Baker, 
four young Kuwaitis who told a now depressingly familiar tale of torture and 
intimidation by the Iraqi occupation authorities. 
</P>
<P>
One 24-year-old bank employee, who declined to give his name, said he was 
finally released after paying a bribe to his captors.

IMMIGRANTS CHANGE FLAVOR OF THE WAY L.A. AREA PLAYS; 
</P>
<P>
CULTURE: GROWING MORE SECURE IN A NEW LAND, CENTRAL AMERICANS STEP OUT TO A NEW 
BEAT IN ENTERTAINMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Late at night, young Salvadoran men and women, their hair slicked or teased, 
their clothes primped and pressed, flow through the painted glass doors at the 
corner of Temple Street and Rampart Boulevard just west of downtown, past the 
security guards and into the darkened cavern that is the Pan American Club. 
</P>
<P>
There, under the pink and purple neon stars, a Salvadoran band breaks into a 
cumbia and other familiar tunes from the tropics. Instantly, the dance floor is 
jammed with the furious movements of bouncing torsos, gyrating shoulders and 
whirling feet. The dance -- at this club and dozens all over the city -- will 
last the entire night. 
</P>
<P>
Clubs such as the Pan American have sprung up throughout greater Los Angeles in 
recent years, catering to a growing Central American community and competing 
increasingly for a portion of the immigrant dollar. Their presence shows that 
new waves of immigrants are changing not only the way Southern California 
speaks and works, but also the way it plays. 
</P>
<P>
With the influx of hundreds of thousands of Central Americans into the region 
over the last decade, these nightspots are taking their place alongside the 
traditional Mexican mariachi clubs and theaters that have existed in Los 
Angeles for decades. Together, they offer a glimpse into the ways recent Latin 
American immigrants are making recreation and entertainment a part of their 
transplanted lives. 
</P>
<P>
To outsiders, the clubs may appear as seedy bars with strange names on 
unattractive street corners. But to those who cross their thresholds, they 
represent something else altogether. Inside, scores of people who have escaped 
civil wars and poverty seek nostalgic links to their homeland, camaraderie 
among compatriots and relief from their daily drudgeries. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the few places where we can enjoy lo nuestro, what is ours, a 
bit of El Salvador," said customer Luis Parton, a Salvadoran who works for a 
local Spanish-language television station, as he sipped a drink and watched the 
dancers crowding the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knows each other here," Parton, 35, said. "The faces rarely change. 
I can stay away three months and, when I return, I see the same faces." 
</P>
<P>
It is the same story for many of the Guatemalans who frequent the 3-year-old 
Guatelinda Night Club on Hollywood Boulevard. "There are people who come just 
to hear the marimba," said Hector Cano, a bartender at Guatelinda. "Marimba 
music is (Guatemala's) national music, the music of our elders." 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, with war menacing El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala, 
refugees poured into Los Angeles by the thousands. As they tentatively formed 
new lives here, mere survival was the primary, perhaps only, goal. Luxuries 
such as entertainment were rarely part of the picture. 
</P>
<P>
The Central American community became more established. As part of that 
evolution, the number of recreational and entertainment outlets has grown to 
include everything from restaurants, nightclubs and pool halls to soccer 
leagues and civic associations. 
</P>
<P>
Couples with children crowd Salvadoran and Guatemalan restaurants in the 
Pico-Union area or in North Hollywood; parks as far flung as MacArthur Park 
near downtown to the soccer fields of suburban San Gabriel Valley are scenes of 
weekend picnics and gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, there was a hope things would change in Central America and 
people would be able to go back," said Francisco Rivera, head of the newly 
formed Central American Cultural Center, which promotes musical and artistic 
performances. "But now you have this incredible situation of half a million 
Central Americans settling definitely in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Rivera said, the number of Central American restaurants in Los 
Angeles quadrupled during the past decade, to about 200. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, the addition of entertainment and recreation to the immigrant's 
activities has always been considered an important milestone in any 
foreign-born group's integration into American life. 
</P>
<P>
It marks a point where the immigrant has overcome an initial feeling of 
isolation and has moved on to join social networks, which gradually give the 
immigrant a sense of belonging. Such support networks allow the newcomer to 
cling to something familiar while building a new life. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the key things the immigrant tries to do is re-create a sense of 
security (and) emotional support by re-creating his community," said Leo 
Chavez, an anthropologist at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Especially for undocumented aliens, in this country illegally and often living 
an underground existence in a seemingly hostile world, the mainstream forms of 
recreation are off limits. Chavez said they look to their own clubs, soccer 
games and restaurants to provide a form of refuge, an "island of security." 
</P>
<P>
Estimating how much money recent immigrants spend on recreation is difficult. 
The amount depends on many factors, including the proportion of earnings that a 
person sends back to his family in Mexico or Central America, the number of 
family members in this country, and so forth. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, from interviews with experts and participants, it is clear that 
entertainment tailored to Latin American tastes has become big business in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
For the savvy entrepreneur, it only makes sense to tap into a growing base of 
potential customers -- people who may not have a lot of money to spend but who 
will gladly dedicate a portion of their budget to entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
One proprietor of a bar on the eastern edge of Hollywood said he began adding 
Central American and Caribbean tunes to a previously all-Mexican jukebox when 
he bought the place nine years ago. Gradually, the clientele shifted from a 
mostly Mexican crowd to a mix that is about 40% Salvadoran, Guatemalan and 
Honduran. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to go where the (business) is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As a recent Friday wore on past midnight, dancers continued to arrive at the 
Pan American. Young men paused just inside the deafening club to check their 
hair in a wall-to-wall mirror. Smiling women came in groups or on dates and 
took their place at cloth-covered, candlelight tables facing the boisterous 
dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
Police have reported complaints from residents who say some patrons who loiter 
after emerging from the club are a nuisance. There have been a handful of 
narcotics arrests of people outside the club, but no trouble involving the club 
itself, police said. The owners said drugs are not tolerated at their 
establishment. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting at the bar, crowding the dance floor or waiting the tables, a 
cross-section of the world of recent Central American immigrants can be found. 
</P>
<P>
There are former students from violent countries who barely escaped, and 
aspiring professionals whose readjustment has been relatively comfortable. 
There are musicians who were famous in their homeland, only to have to start 
over in this country. And there are ex-soldiers who reached U.S. soil only 
after long detours through dank Central American jails. 
</P>
<P>
Here they work as hotel clerks, fast-food cashiers, security guards, sales 
representatives, delivery truck drivers, housekeepers and writers. 
</P>
<P>
Many political backgrounds and viewpoints are represented on any given night at 
the Pan American. The owners make one thing clear: Check your politics at the 
door. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not mention politics here for anything," said co-owner Consuelo Ayon. 
"This is a place to dance, to have a good time. It is not a place for fixing 
political things. It is for having fun. Period. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not allow religion, either," she added. 
</P>
<P>
While many of the clubs attract a mixed clientele who hail from all over Latin 
America, sometimes one country is represented more than others, largely because 
of the music that is played. 
</P>
<P>
At the Pan American, mostly Salvadoran crowds want to hear the club's star 
musical attraction, German Mangandi y Sus Amigos, billed as "the best 
Salvadoran musical group in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
Mangandi was a well-known figure on the entertainment scene of his native El 
Salvador during the 1960s and '70s. As a young singer in San Salvador, Mangandi 
formed several of Central America's most famous dance bands, among them the 
Fiebre Amarilla (Yellow Fever). 
</P>
<P>
Like tens of thousands of other Salvadorans, Mangandi began to see the civil 
war touch his family, his life and his work. 
</P>
<P>
There was the time he was playing a concert in Sesuntepeque when shooting broke 
out. Retreating to the bathroom he had to step over dead bodies. 
</P>
<P>
"Working became difficult," Mangandi, 43, said in a recent interview backstage 
at the Pan American. 
</P>
<P>
So he came to Los Angeles, where he has reinvented a career. In addition to 
headlining the Pan American most weekends, Mangandi &amp; Friends have toured 
the United States occasionally and even returned to perform in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Standing sentry over the entrance to the Pan American are two security guards 
who inspect the customers' proof of age and search each male arriving at the 
club. With emblems of the U.S. flag sewn on their uniform shirt sleeves, the 
two guards can recite the date and time they entered the United States -- after 
nearly a decade of what they described as pain and deprivation in a Nicaraguan 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
The two men, Elen Peterson Bermudez, 47, and Juan Jose Puerto, 50, were members 
of the National Guard of right-wing dictator Anastasio Somoza, who was 
overthrown in 1979 by the leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front. Like 
many guardsmen, Peterson and Puerto landed in jail. 
</P>
<P>
They gained their freedom 10 years later in a general amnesty granted by the 
government. They said they continued to feel pressured and watched, and left 
Nicaragua. The two men ended up in Los Angeles, where they have sisters, and 
started work for a private security firm. 
</P>
<P>
Although the assignments rotate, Peterson and Puerto lately have been spending 
most of their shifts at the Pan American. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine?" Puerto said, shaking his head at the blaring sounds around 
him. "Ten years of not hearing music at all (in prison). And now, hearing it 
until we go to bed! Such is fate." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the Guatelinda, Judith Morales, her long black curly hair flowing over 
her shoulders, and her sister-in-law, Evelyn Gomez, dressed in a tight black 
skirt, white lacy top and large faux-pearl earrings, were sitting at a table 
waiting for a punta y soka contest to begin. 
</P>
<P>
The dance, a faster version of the merengue, is especially popular among people 
from Central America's eastern coast, a region washed in a strong Caribbean 
influence. First prize in the contest was $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Morales, a receptionist, and Gomez, who is studying word processing at a trade 
school, were the first to arrive, about 9:30 p.m., and would be among the last 
to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Morales, who left the Guatemalan lakeside town of Amatitlan five years ago to 
join four siblings in Los Angeles, said she goes to the club, often with her 
husband, an average of three nights a week: Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays. At 
first, her social life in Los Angeles was limited to parties in friends' homes, 
but over the years, her circle widened to take in the discos. 
</P>
<P>
She said she loves to dance, to see the people, to enjoy the ambience. "With 
the music and everything," she said, "it almost feels like we were back home."

BUSH RHETORIC GROWS BUT AIDES ARE CAUTIOUS; 
</P>
<P>
POLICY: A 'PEACEFUL THANKSGIVING' IS FORECAST DESPITE REMARKS THAT CAUSE SOME 
IN ADMINISTRATION TO CRINGE.

<P>
President Bush, on a campaign trip in Texas, again stepped up his rhetoric 
against Iraq on Monday, warning that any acceptance of uncontrolled aggression 
"could be world war tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration officials hastened to assure reporters that Bush's remark 
was an unguarded comment, not a signal of any intention to launch a war. 
</P>
<P>
The country will see "a peaceful Thanksgiving" unless Iraq itself launches an 
attack, a senior Pentagon official said, denying widely circulated rumors about 
plans to begin a U.S. offensive sometime this month. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Bush's remark underlined an increasing problem for the 
Administration: After exercising tight control over his comments during the 
early phase of the anti-Iraq campaign, Bush's rhetorical enthusiasm over the 
last week has been in full swing, causing anxious cringing on the part of 
Administration planners. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, for example, Bush carefully compared 
Iraq's aggression with the German aggression against Poland that launched World 
War II. But he stopped short of a personal comparison of Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein with Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
That caution went out the window last month, when Bush not only compared 
Hussein to Hitler but also threatened Nuremberg-style war crimes trials. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last week, Bush went further, briefly maintaining that the Iraqi leader 
is worse than Hitler because the Germans never held U.S. citizens as "human 
shields" at military sites. 
</P>
<P>
"Got to get his rhetoric under control," one official said after hearing of 
Monday's comment. 
</P>
<P>
The rhetoric, in fact, conflicts with Administration plans for the next several 
weeks -- plans that officials say are centered around slowly continuing to 
build up forces in the Persian Gulf. The buildup, they add, is likely to 
include sending combat reserve units into active duty for the first time since 
the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
The call-up would address political problems with key members of Congress, who 
are demanding that the combat reservists be sent as a demonstration of resolve 
and to fulfill a promise to the reserve troops themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The call-up also would help solve the Army's desire to augment the more than 
210,000 GIs now in Saudi Arabia and to provide replacements when a rotation 
policy is begun early next year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
About 34,000 reservists have already been activated for the conflict, but all 
have been noncombat specialists such as transport pilots, cargo handlers, 
cooks, electricians and medical personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Military leaders have objected to calling up combat units, believing that they 
would take too long to transport, train and integrate with the active-duty 
units already in Saudi Arabia. That exclusion has caused howls of protests from 
lawmakers, who appropriated billions of dollars to equip and train the reserves 
and National Guard troops. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, many reservists themselves have bitterly complained of being 
treated as second-class citizens by their active-duty counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
The units most likely to be called first are two "round-out brigades" attached 
to the 1st Cavalry and 24th Infantry Divisions, the 155th Armored Brigade from 
the Mississippi National Guard and the 48th Infantry Brigade from the Georgia 
National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
Also this month, the Administration is looking forward to a scheduled 
international inspection of Iraqi nuclear facilities. The inspection could help 
answer mounting questions about Saddam Hussein's progress toward developing an 
atomic bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this fall, Iraqi officials hinted at an international meeting that 
inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency might be barred from 
examining nuclear energy facilities in the country. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials now say they expect the Iraqis to drop that idea, which 
would have immediately heightened Persian Gulf tensions. "We've seen no signs 
that they will refuse" to allow the inspectors into Iraq, one Administration 
official said. "There are so many people itching to pull the trigger," the 
official added, "they would not want to give anyone an excuse." 
</P>
<P>
The main target of the IAEA inspection would be two small stockpiles of highly 
enriched weapons-grade uranium, one from France, the other from the Soviet 
Union. Both were sold to Iraq as fuel for nuclear reactors years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The French stockpile, slightly more than 12 kilograms, or about 26 1/2 pounds, 
has been enriched to a very high level, more than 90% fissionable U-235. The 
Soviet stockpile is smaller and less enriched. But the two together could 
provide enough uranium to build one crude bomb, according to non-government 
experts on nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Government analysts agree that Iraq has been trying for years to develop the 
capacity to build a bomb, but they disagree about how much longer it will take. 
A key question is Iraq's ability to enrich its own uranium, rather than rely on 
the small amounts of enriched uranium it can obtain. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believe Iraq may have as many as two dozen gas centrifuges, the 
key devices needed to complete the enrichment. But "it takes about 1,000 
centrifuges operating for one year to produce enough stuff for one bomb," noted 
Leonard S. Spector of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Most experts agree that Hussein is still several years away from having nuclear 
capacity.

GULF WATCH: DAY 96; 
</P>
<P>
A DAILY BRIEFING PAPER ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CRISIS; 
</P>
<P>
HOSTAGE FRONT: 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A steady stream of emissaries urged Iraq to release foreign hostages, despite 
concern that direct appeals were undermining the coalition allied against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Among those in Iraq to discuss hostage releases: a former prime minister of 
Japan, former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt and a delegation of Irish 
legislators. 
</P>
<P>
A former prime minister of New Zealand is headed there, as is a former prime 
minister of Denmark and the wives of 10 British hostages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Saudi Arabia's King Fahd reached a 
new military command and control agreement. It guarantees that American troops 
will be under the command of American officers if they launch an offensive 
operation against Iraq. Details of the pact were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq threatened to attack Arab countries participating in the U.S.-led 
multinational force if war breaks out. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. aircraft carrier Midway and its seven escorts entered the Persian 
Gulf. The 75 aircraft aboard the Midway can strike at targets in Iraq or Kuwait 
without refueling. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Economic Front: 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices started the week sharply lower. Crude oil for December delivery on 
the New York Mercantile Exchange tumbled $2.04 to $31.96 a barrel at Monday's 
close. The markets were apparently reacting to the Saudi oil minister's 
statement that his country is pumping oil at the fastest rate in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Mobilization: 
</P>
<P>
* Army reserves: 24,057 
</P>
<P>
* Navy reserves: 4,529 
</P>
<P>
* Air Force reserves: 4,897

King Hussein of Jordan pleaded Monday for dialogue with Iraq, but French 
President Francois Mitterrand said that only an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait 
could lead to a peaceful outcome to the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be no embargo on dialogue, there has to be dialogue to get us to 
achieve results," the king told reporters after nearly an hour with Mitterrand 
at the Elysee Palace. 
</P>
<P>
A Mitterrand spokesman quoted the French leader as reiterating that "nothing 
has fundamentally changed since Aug. 2," the day Iraq invaded Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way to have a peaceful solution is to obtain Iraq's compliance with 
United Nations Security Council demands" that Baghdad pull its troops out, free 
all foreign hostages and restore Kuwaiti sovereignty, Mitterrand said. 
</P>
<P>
King Hussein, who met Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz on Saturday, said he 
brought no message from Baghdad. Mitterrand has said his government has had no 
negotiating contacts with Iraqi leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The king stressed that a solution should also encompass the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict. He would not comment on whether Iraq should pull out of Kuwait first. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we are against occupation by war. . . . We are against the 
annexation of territory," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The king, caught between neighboring Iraq and dependence on Western aid, 
reiterated that Jordan, which has an $8-billion foreign debt, is complying with 
U.N. trade sanctions despite its former heavy reliance on Iraqi oil and other 
trade.

BRANDT IN IRAQ ON HOSTAGES MISSION

<P>
Former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt arrived in this capital Monday night 
on a personal mission to win the release of hundreds of Iraqi-held hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt traveled in a chartered Lufthansa Airbus that can carry about 250 
people, bearing flowers and letters from relatives of the estimated 400 German 
hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Also on board were four aides and two tons of medicine for Iraq donated by 
German companies. 
</P>
<P>
The British, Belgian and Dutch governments have criticized the journey, and 
Brandt has been unable to stir up much support outside Germany for the trip. 
</P>
<P>
The German government said it backs the journey even though the 12-nation 
European Community last week stated there should be no negotiations with 
Baghdad on hostages. 
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands has asked Italy to call an EC foreign ministers' meeting out of 
concern that missions such as Brandt's undermine Western resolve against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt, honorary head of the opposition Social Democrats in Germany and a Nobel 
Peace Prize winner, says his trip is a private mission and that he is not going 
to Baghdad as a representative of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government.

INDIA'S RULING PARTY CRISIS DEEPENS; PRIME MINISTER'S OUSTER EXPECTED;

India's political crisis deepened Monday as Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap 
Singh's ruling party split over his handling of two key issues that together 
touched off waves of religious clashes and suicide protests in which hundreds 
have died in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
After a day of politicking and back-room meetings, the ruling Janata Dal 
(People's Party) appeared as divided as the rest of India on Singh's decision 
to forcibly block Hindu militants' attempts to replace an ancient Muslim mosque 
with a temple to the god Rama, as well as Singh's edict last summer to reserve 
20% of all government jobs for low-caste Hindus. 
</P>
<P>
The split virtually ensures Singh's fall from power on Wednesday, when the 
Indian Parliament is scheduled to convene for a no-confidence vote on the prime 
minister's performance. 
</P>
<P>
But what sort of government will replace Singh's socialist-led coalition 
remains uncertain at a time that Singh has conceded is India's most trying hour 
since independence in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
The dissident faction of the People's Party, which has ruled for 11 months 
through a coalition with the Hindu fundamentalists and India's Communist 
parties, unanimously elected veteran socialist Chandra Shekhar as its leader 
Monday. The faction claimed to have support in 68 of the party's 140 
parliamentary seats. 
</P>
<P>
Shekhar has proven himself a perennial political opportunist since he broke 
ranks with the Nehru family's once-monolithic Congress-I party in 1974. And on 
Monday, he made clear his intentions to replace Singh as prime minister through 
a coalition with any group willing to support him. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, I am not the prime minister of this country. When I am prime minister, 
I will answer every question," Shekhar shouted during a news conference in the 
back yard of Singh's former deputy prime minister, Devi Lal, who helped convene 
the splinter faction. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time that Shekhar's group met, though, Singh convened the remainder 
of his party in a parliamentary annex building, where they unanimously elected 
Singh to continue as party president. 
</P>
<P>
Singh's faction claimed the support of 83 of the 140 party members. No one 
could explain the mathematical discrepancy in the two factions' claims. 
</P>
<P>
Singh himself left the official party meeting hurriedly and offered no comment 
on the day's feverish and often convoluted politicking. Later, however, he 
announced the formal expulsion of Shekhar and 24 other party members for 
"anti-party activities." 
</P>
<P>
In a briefing for journalists after Singh's faction met, Railways Minister 
George Fernandes at first asserted that the party had not broken apart. 
</P>
<P>
"The Janata Dal has not split," he said with a smile. "Some people did not 
attend the meeting, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
Later, though, he conceded that the party is "under attack, under siege" from 
within, adding, "I suppose that's a part of political life." 
</P>
<P>
Fernandes and other Cabinet ministers still loyal to Singh insisted that 
whatever the makeup of the future government, it will not be decided before 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how Singh's government can survive the parliamentary vote now that his 
own party is divided, Fernandes concluded: "Sometimes a party which loses some 
of its members becomes more cohesive -- and therefore strong. All possibilities 
are still open as far as Parliament is concerned. . . . In politics, there is 
no such word as impossible." 
</P>
<P>
But even if the ruling party remains united, Singh more than likely will lose 
Wednesday's vote because it has ruled only through the contradictory 
Hindu-Communist coalition -- and last week he lost the key support of the Hindu 
revivalist Indian People's Party, whose entire leadership was arrested while 
trying to join in the destruction of the mosque in the holy city of Ayodhya. 
</P>
<P>
Singh ordered the release of the fundamentalist party's leaders so they, too, 
could meet in New Delhi on Monday to prepare for the upcoming session. 
Predictably, the Hindu party called for new national elections, which it hopes 
to win on the strength of its mosque-destruction crusade. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 200 people killed in nationwide rioting last week after Hindu 
militants began destroying the mosque were Muslims attacked by frenzied mobs of 
celebrating Hindus. If new elections are held, Singh hopes to win backing from 
the Muslims, who number 100 million to the Hindus' 750 million but consistently 
vote in a bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Singh also would rely on the support of India's millions of low-caste Hindus, 
who will benefit by his so-called positive discrimination order to break 
India's caste system. The order has been blamed for nearly 200 suicide attempts 
-- half of them successful -- by high-caste students and young government 
officials who despair of their professional future. 
</P>
<P>
The Hindu fundamentalist party, however, has mobilized a new political force 
through its campaign to build the temple to Rama, among the most popular of 
Hinduism's gods and mythical heroes. Its leaders are banking on a new "Hindu 
vote" to bring them to power for the first time if elections are held soon. 
</P>
<P>
The final decision on elections is likely to be made by Indian President 
Ramaswami Venkataraman, a 79-year-old former congressman who serves as 
political referee in such crises. 
</P>
<P>
If Singh loses the confidence vote, the president can call on Shekhar to form a 
coalition with other parties -- even the Congress-I, which holds about 190 
seats in Parliament and is still led by former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, many analysts speculated that the president can even call on Gandhi 
himself -- who presided over his party's worst defeat in three generations -- 
to form a new government or serve as a caretaker prime minister for up to six 
months before scheduling new elections. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the outcome, Gandhi is likely to play a key role.

CAR PAC PUMPS UP 2 GOP HOPEFULS; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE FOREIGN AUTO DEALERS' LOBBY GROUP PROVIDED $600,000 IN 
LAST-MINUTE AID. SOME CHARGE IT IS A FRONT FOR JAPANESE AUTO MAKERS.

<P>
AutoPAC, an association of foreign car dealers accused by some Democrats of 
being a front for Japanese auto manufacturers, has spent almost $600,000 to 
assist two Republican Senate candidates in the final two weeks of the election 
campaign, according to Federal Election Commission records. 
</P>
<P>
The political action committee, also known as the Auto Dealers and Drivers for 
Free Trade, spent $357,600 on behalf of Rep. Robert C. Smith (R-N.H.), who is 
running to fill a vacant Senate seat in New Hampshire, and $202,565 on behalf 
of incumbent Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.). 
</P>
<P>
Founded by Tom Nemet, a New York Nissan-Volvo-Jaguar dealer, AutoPAC made its 
reputation as a potent political force in 1988 when it was credited with 
defeating the Senate bid of then-Rep. Buddy McKay (D-Fla.). 
</P>
<P>
Democrats have since tried unsuccessfully to cripple AutoPAC by filing 
complaints against it with the FEC and the Justice Department, at one point 
suggesting it be required to register as a foreign agent. Neither the Justice 
Department nor the FEC acted on these complaints. 
</P>
<P>
AutoPAC is the acknowledged leader among a number of well-heeled national 
lobbying groups involved in making last-minute, independent expenditures on 
behalf of candidates in close congressional races. As long as these groups do 
not coordinate their efforts with the candidate, they are permitted under 
federal election law to spend unlimited amounts of money. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, these same PACs are permitted under federal law to make direct 
contributions to a candidate of no more than $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
In New Hampshire, most of AutoPAC's money was spent to air two television 
commercials attacking the record of Smith's opponent, former Sen. John Durkin 
(D-N.H.). One commercial dealt primarily with Durkin's votes on taxes; the 
other alleged that Durkin has an inconsistent record on the abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
In response to these ads, Durkin told voters that AutoPAC was trying to buy 
Smith's vote in Congress "so the Japanese could put you out of work." Using a 
derogatory racial term, he charged that the Japanese who attacked Pearl Harbor 
now "are trying to stage a sneak attack on our election process in New 
Hampshire on Nov. 6." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Glacken, AutoPAC executive director, said that while the group's ads make 
no mention of the free trade issue, Durkin's response clearly demonstrates why 
AutoPAC has set out to defeat him. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob Smith is an internationalist," he said. "John Durkin is a nationalist, an 
isolationist with a xenophobic perspective on the world." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, AutoPAC has also produced television commercials that attack 
Boschwitz's challenger, Democrat Paul Wellstone. 
</P>
<P>
Glacken said the group, which will spend about $1 million independently in this 
election, has done nothing to alter its strategy in response to the criticism 
it received after the 1988 election. However, he said AutoPAC has been somewhat 
more cautious with its independent expenditures because of the volatility of 
many races this year. 
</P>
<P>
After the 1988 election, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee filed an 
FEC complaint alleging that the AutoPAC's independent expenditures were 
actually being coordinated with the Republican Party. At the same time, four 
Democratic senators asked the Justice Department to investigate whether AutoPAC 
should be required to register as a foreign agent because of its apparent ties 
to Japanese and other foreign auto makers. 
</P>
<P>
Glacken denied allegations that AutoPAC is a front for either the Japanese auto 
dealers or the Republican Party. He noted that the group give direct 
contributions to some Democrats and also independently spent $93,750 on a 
direct mail campaign in support of Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.). Johnston 
earlier this month defeated a challenge by white supremacist David Duke. 
</P>
<P>
But Anita Dunn, spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, 
said AutoPAC's support for Johnston proves nothing about its political 
affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
"The Louisiana Senate race was an easy choice for anyone who wanted to say that 
they support Democrats too," she said. "The truth is they (AutoPAC) often give 
an unfair advantage to Republicans late in the game by spending huge amounts of 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Another group heavily involved in making large independent expenditures on 
behalf of congressional candidates is the National Realtors Assn. PAC. It has 
spent a total of $976,977 on behalf of eight candidates: Johnston, Smith and 
Reps. Peter Hoagland (D-Neb.), Jack Buechner (R-Mo.), Ileana Ros-Lehtinen 
(R-Fla.), Larry E. Craig (R-Ida.), Rep. Ben Jones (D-Ga.), and Hank Brown 
(R-Colo.), who is running for a vacant Senate seat in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
The National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL), has independently spent 
$216,697 of its funds on broadcast advertising designed to defeat incumbent 
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), who has authored several anti-abortion proposals in 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the National Education Assn. has reported spending $100,000 on behalf 
of Helms' opponent, Harvey Gantt. 
</P>
<P>
Other targets of NARAL's independent expenditures include Florida Republican 
Gov. Bob Martinez, Rep. Denny Smith (R-Ore.) and Rep. Tom Tauke (R-Iowa), who 
is challenging Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa.). NARAL's efforts include telephone 
campaigns as well as commercials.

European nations agreed Monday to freeze emissions of the gases most 
responsible for global warming by the year 2000, Swiss Interior Minister Flavio 
Cotti said. 
</P>
<P>
But at the parallel Second World Climate Conference here, resistance from the 
United States helped water down a statement from nearly 100 countries, 
disappointing environmentalists by setting no target dates for controls on gas 
emissions. 
</P>
<P>
Cotti said the Europeans' decision came at a meeting of the six-nation European 
Free Trade Assn. (EFTA) and the 12-member European Community (EC), shortly 
before the conclusion of a worldwide conference on what to do about global 
warming, known as the greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
The EFTA-EC decision means the United States and Turkey are the only two 
members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development not 
committed to a freeze or reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. 
</P>
<P>
The draft agreement will be signed Wednesday at the end of the 10-day Second 
World Climate Conference.

PENTAGON LOSES 9-YEAR BATTLE TO BAR GAY ARMY SERGEANT 
</P>

<P>
The Supreme Court Monday ended the Pentagon's nine-year effort to bar Sgt. 
Perry Watkins from the Army because of his homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
The justices refused to hear the Bush Administration appeal of a ruling last 
year which concluded the Army waited too long before discharging Watkins for 
homosexuality. Beginning in 1967, when he was drafted, Watkins repeatedly said 
he was a homosexual. But it was not until 1981 that the Army sought to force 
him out. 
</P>
<P>
"This shows it is possible to fight the Army and win," said attorney James 
Lobsenz, who represented Watkins in the long-running case. 
</P>
<P>
But the Watkins case was not the landmark victory for gay soldiers that it once 
appeared it could be, since the case hinged on the fact Watkins could prove 
that his homosexuality had been revealed to officers and ignored. 
</P>
<P>
"They tolerated him for 15 years," said Watkins' attorney. "Hopefully, this 
means Sgt. Watkins can now resume his military career." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, on a 2-1 vote, said the Army 
violated Watkins' constitutional rights by discharging him for homosexuality. 
The court opinion, written by Judge William Norris, struck down the Army's 
anti-gay regulations as a violation of the Constitution's guarantee of equal 
treatment for all. 
</P>
<P>
Gay rights activists hailed the decision as their most important judicial 
victory ever. But shortly afterward, the full appeals court withdrew the 
decision and later issued a much more limited ruling. 
</P>
<P>
In that second decision, the appeals court said the Army could not discharge 
Watkins for homosexuality in 1981 when it had repeatedly ignored his earlier 
admissions that he was gay. 
</P>
<P>
In its appeal, the Bush Administration said the Army should be permitted to 
exclude all homosexuals. But without comment Monday, the justices let stand the 
second appeals court decision. (U.S. Army vs. Watkins, 89-1806). 
</P>
<P>
Watkins, 42, of Tacoma, Wash., was discharged in 1984 and has been trying to 
get back into the service since then. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court has never ruled directly on whether government discrimination 
against homosexuals violates the Constitution's guarantee of "equal protection 
of the laws." On several occasions, however, it has refused to hear appeals 
from soldiers who were discharged for homosexuality.

GROUP CLAIMS 7 BROKE LAW ON CAMPAIGN GIFTS

Responding to a Los Angeles Times story, Common Cause has filed a complaint 
with the Federal Election Commission accusing seven wealthy campaign 
contributors of violating a federal election law that prohibits anyone from 
making more than $25,000 a year in contributions to federal candidates. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to FEC Chairwoman Lee Ann Elliott, Common Cause President Fred 
Wertheimer called on the commission to "take appropriate action against these 
individuals and to institute procedures by which the FEC can regularly detect 
such violations." 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported in a story published April 18 that the FEC had failed to 
take action against at least 10 wealthy men and women who appeared to have 
exceeded the limit on contributions during 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The seven contributors named in the Common Cause complaint were corporate 
buy-out specialists Henry R. Kravis, Ronald O. Perelman and Harold Simmons; 
Kravis' father, Raymond; Ira Riklis, son of corporate raider Meshulam Riklis; 
Dwayne O. Andreas, chairman of Archer Daniels Midland, and his wife, Dorothy 
Inez. 
</P>
<P>
The three others named in the Times story were Meshulam Riklis, New York 
developer Donald Trump and Rose Hunt, heir to the Hunt oil fortune. Common 
Cause did not explain why these names were not included in the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
FEC officials have acknowledged that they do not adequately monitor compliance 
with the limits on campaign spending. Although a few people have been fined in 
the past for exceeding these limits, the penalties levied in these cases have 
not exceeded $250. 
</P>
<P>
Wertheimer noted that both the Times story and the Common Cause complaint were 
drawn from candidate reports currently on file at the FEC headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal election law, contributors are permitted to give up to $2,000 to 
a congressional campaign, $5,000 a year to a political action committee and 
$20,000 a year to a party committee. But total contributions in any calendar 
year may not exceed $25,000.

HELMS, GANTT ABOUT EVEN AFTER N. CAROLINA STRUGGLE; 
</P>
<P>
SENATE: CONTEST HAS BECOME A BAROMETER OF RACE'S ROLE IN SOUTHERN POLITICS. 
BOTH CANDIDATES END WITH AD BLITZ, PUSH FOR A BIG VOTER TURNOUT.

<P>
At the end of a bitter struggle that has become a barometer on the role of race 
in Southern politics, white incumbent GOP Sen. Jesse Helms and black challenger 
Harvey Gantt Monday pushed for big voter turnouts in the nation's most-watched 
Senate contest. 
</P>
<P>
Campaigning across the state and blitzing the airwaves with commercials, the 
two men wound up a race many consider too close to call. However, an opinion 
poll published Saturday in the Charlotte Observer put Gantt ahead 47% to 41%, 
with 12% either undecided or refusing to say how they will vote. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday Helms continued his attack focusing heavily on racial issues, 
including affirmative action, minority ownership of broadcast facilities and 
Gantt's support of the civil rights bill that President Bush vetoed. 
</P>
<P>
Gantt has retaliated by hammering on Helms' 18-year record in the Senate, 
portraying the conservative senator as ineffective and out of touch with the 
state's voters. Gantt castigated Helms for opposing a woman's right to choose 
abortion and for his record on the environment and education in a state that 
lags on both. 
</P>
<P>
The final days of the campaign have been "hellacious," Helms' tactics in 
particular, said Thad Beyle, a political scientist at the University of North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like Helms saved all those negative ads until the end of the campaign," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The ads appear to have mobilized Helms' white base of support and knocked Gantt 
off balance, slowing his momentum. 
</P>
<P>
But Gantt, speaking to reporters Monday in a hoarse voice, rejected that 
notion. "I don't have much of a voice, but my spirit is willing, and we shall 
win," he said. "I've never thought the momentum ever shifted." 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Helms rejected charges that his ads were unfair, telling 
reporters: "They claimed one time that Mr. (Harry) Truman was giving 'em hell. 
And he said: 'I'm not giving 'em hell. I'm telling the truth on 'em, and they 
think it's hell.' " 
</P>
<P>
As a measure of the role race is playing in the contest, the Justice Department 
said Monday it was sending a team of lawyers to North Carolina to ensure that 
minority voters aren't disqualified from voting based on information gathered 
by the state Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Atty. Gen. John R. Dunne said the state GOP has pledged not to use 
any information it obtained from postcards it sent out advising voters that 
they were ineligible to cast ballots if they had moved in the last 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic officials feared that if the postcards were returned as 
non-deliverable, indicating that someone had moved, they could be used to 
challenge eligibility of voters at the polls today. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats also charged that postcards were sent to intimidate black voters. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, a federal judge in Newark, N.J., held that the Republican 
National Committee was not involved in the North Carolina mailings, which 
Democrats charged violated a 1982 consent decree signed by the national GOP. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Salisbury, a town of 24,000, the racial split was apparent: black 
voters are solidly for Gantt, but white voters are more diverse, with some for 
Gantt, others for Helms. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my man," said Robert Steele, a 70-year-old black man, referring to 
Gantt. "It's time we have a chance at something." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Zachary, an 89-year-old white man who said he has voted for Helms in the 
past, said the senator "has been in 18 years, so he must be doing something 
right." 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts expect more whites than the polls currently indicate will vote 
for Helms. Of the 12% in the Charlotte Observer poll who were undecided or 
refusing to name their choice, 83% were white. 
</P>
<P>
Helms and Gantt each depended on out-of-state contributions for roughly 
two-thirds of their campaign budgets. Helms raised a total of $12.8 million and 
Gantt raised $5.6 million.

Eight people were under arrest Monday in a Halloween rampage by a masked gang 
that attacked homeless people on a desolate island off Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants made incriminating videotaped statements placing themselves at 
the scene of the brutal crime and pinning the actual killing on an 18-year-old 
male, whose name was not immediately released, said a police source. 
</P>
<P>
That 18-year-old defendant, who was arrested early Monday, also made a 
videotaped statement about killing on Wards Island, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
"They put themselves there, but they never actually do the killing. Everybody 
puts it on him," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
A ninth youth was being sought in the attack by assailants who wore Halloween 
masks, wielded a meat cleaver, vacuum cleaner parts and broken bottles and 
shouted "trick or treat" before setting upon their victims.

LONGEST BALLOT IN HISTORY AWAITS VOTERS

Ventura County voters, peppered with last-minute appeals from candidates and 
special interest groups, will cast ballots today in the governor's race, pick a 
county supervisor and decide whether to raise sales taxes by half a cent to pay 
for transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the ballot are more than a dozen federal, state and local races, 
including nine school board contests and City Council races in Camarillo, 
Fillmore, Moorpark, Oxnard, Port Hueneme, Santa Paula, Simi Valley and Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Polls open today at 7 a.m. at 459 locations around the county and close at 8 
p.m. Elections officials predict that 59% of the county's 308,555 registered 
voters will cast ballots, a historic low for a gubernatorial race. 
</P>
<P>
The low-vote prediction is based on a three-decade trend of growing voter 
apathy. In this election, only 42% of the voting-age population in the county 
is expected to vote, said Richard Dean, county clerk and recorder. 
</P>
<P>
Of those casting ballots, election officials estimate that a record 22% of 
voters in the county, or 40,000 people, will mail or drop off absentee ballots 
rather than stand in a voting booth and wrestle with the longest ballot in the 
county's history. 
</P>
<P>
The final days of the campaign has brought a flurry of radio and television 
advertisements. In addition to the barrage of ads for the gubernatorial 
candidates and for 28 statewide ballot propositions, Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino 
(R-Ventura) and his Democratic challenger Anita Perez Ferguson have multimedia 
campaigns to curry favor with voters. 
</P>
<P>
Most area candidates have focused on delivering their message through the mail. 
For example, county supervisorial candidates Vicky Howard and Bill Davis have 
sent mass mailings to woo potential voters in the 4th Supervisorial District 
that incorporates Moorpark and Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Measure C, a countywide measure to add a half-cent sales tax for transportation 
projects, has picked up additional supporters and opponents in the last few 
days before the election. 
</P>
<P>
State Sens. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita) and Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) 
issued a joint statement supporting the measure they say will improve air 
quality and relieve traffic congestion. Meanwhile, Assemblyman Tom McClintock 
(R-Thousand Oaks) announced his objection on the basis that it add more taxes 
to the overburdened taxpayer.

<P>
Today's ballot presents voters with more choices than ever, Dean said. "It's 
the longest ballot we've ever had, about double the size of the ballot in 
June." 
</P>
<P>
Election officials attribute part of the increase in absentee voters to the 
increasing length and complexity of the ballot, especially the intimidating 
number of statewide ballot propositions. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a lot easier to ponder all these choices at home than to do it standing 
in an election booth," said Ruth P. Schepler, chief of the county's Elections 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, growing numbers of candidates, special-interest groups and 
political parties have supplied their supporters with applications for absentee 
ballots in an effort to get out their vote. 
</P>
<P>
For this election, the state and national Republican parties have sent out more 
absentee ballot applications than other groups, Schepler said. Other 
applications have come from a variety of groups, including Beer Drinkers of 
America, which is opposed to ballot initiatives that would increase alcohol 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
One advantage to a big number of absentee ballots is that about 29,000 ballots 
will be tallied by 8:30 tonight, giving the public a strong indication of 
winners and losers. 
</P>
<P>
A disadvantage is that an anticipated 11,000 absentee ballots will be dropped 
off at the polls on election day, delaying the final results. Election 
officials have to check the signature of each absentee voter to the signature 
recorded on microfiche at the county. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, counting these ballots may not be completed for a week or more. 
"They could have an impact on close races," Dean said. He said the election 
officials are not promising final election results until Nov. 21 and will not 
alter its schedule to determine the winner of a particularly close race. 
</P>
<P>
Registered voters who do not know where to cast their vote may call the 
Elections Division for assistance at 654-2781 between 6:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. 
today.

EX-OFFICIAL DENIES THERE'S A CONFLICT IN CONTRACT TO TENANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former member of the state Employment Training Panel confirmed Monday that he 
rents office space to a longtime associate whose company won a $592,000 state 
contract in August, in part because of the official's support. 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Munoz, an Oxnard insurance broker under investigation for a possible 
violation of conflict-of-interest law, said he does not think his landlord 
relationship with associate Larry Owens created a financial conflict that 
required him to abstain from voting on the contract. 
</P>
<P>
State law generally prohibits members of state boards from participating in 
decisions that would affect a source of their income. 
</P>
<P>
Munoz, however, said he doesn't believe there is a legal conflict because the 
company that rents his Oxnard Boulevard suite is not the same company that 
received the state contract, though both are partly owned by Owens. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any doubt in my mind that there is no conflict of interest," 
Munoz said in an interview. He previously had declined requests for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
"Is the perception of conflict of interest there?" he said. "Yeah, I think so. 
But as far as me receiving any income . . . because of a particular vote, there 
is nothing there." 
</P>
<P>
Munoz was the panel's chief supporter of a $2-million contract approved Aug. 24 
with the Ventura County Agricultural Assn. He led an effort that moved the 
project from 335th place on a waiting list to first place amid criticism that 
it was a subsidy for big farmers. 
</P>
<P>
The contract, which promises to teach farm workers to pick a variety of crops 
and operate machinery, also includes a $592,000 subcontract under which Golden 
State School agrees to provide English-language instruction. Owens is president 
and part owner of Golden State School. 
</P>
<P>
In his interview Monday, Munoz said he has not consulted a lawyer to confirm 
his reading of state conflict-of-interest law. Nor did he ask the legal counsel 
for the Employment Training Panel whether his landlord relationship with Owens 
was a problem before his August vote, Munoz said. 
</P>
<P>
Special Assistant Dist. Atty. Donald D. Coleman, who last week initiated a 
county inquiry into Munoz's vote, said the distinction Munoz makes about which 
Owens company pays rent to him will be examined over the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"First you establish what happened, then you apply that to the law," Coleman 
said. "Then the question becomes whether that is just an artificial 
distinction." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman said Munoz has agreed to cooperate in the county probe and will be 
interviewed today or Wednesday by county investigators. 
</P>
<P>
James Bratt, interim executive director of the Employment Training Panel, has 
also asked the state Fair Political Practices Commission and the state attorney 
general's office for a ruling on Munoz's vote. 
</P>
<P>
Munoz, a 59-year-old gubernatorial appointee, was replaced on the obscure state 
training panel in September after more than four years as a member. The panel 
awards dozens of job-training contracts a year and is expected to approve 
agreements worth $160 million in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura contract, which included the subcontract for Owens' Golden State 
School, was given fast-track treatment by the panel after Munoz persuaded his 
colleagues in May to make farm projects a top priority. The next month, Munoz 
declared that the only agricultural applicant was the Ventura agricultural 
association. 
</P>
<P>
Two months later, despite serious concerns by its staff and strong objections 
by the state Employment Development Department, the panel approved the Ventura 
project 5 to 2. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State School is on Universe Circle in Oxnard. Owens is principal owner 
of Golden State Employer Services, which Munoz said rents a 3,300-square-foot 
office from him for $3,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Owens and Munoz also worked together as directors of the Job Training Policy 
Council, formerly known as the Private Industry Council of Ventura County, 
during the early 1980s and from 1988 until Owens resigned in late September. 
</P>
<P>
Munoz said Monday that he has known Owens for years but is not a close friend. 
He added that since Golden State Employer Services began renting offices from 
him in 1988, he has been careful never to vote on that company's many contracts 
at the local Job Training Policy Council or to discuss them with other council 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Munoz also said that, as a member of the state employment panel, he treated the 
Ventura County Agricultural Assn. contract the same way he has many others, 
pushing for quick approval once he believed it was worth his support. 
</P>
<P>
Munoz said he has never tried to use his position as an employment panel member 
to get insurance business for his agency. But he acknowledged that he tried 
this year to sell an insurance policy to Home Club, which has held a 
$5.8-million panel contract since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Munoz said that -- at the request of another insurance broker -- he called a 
consultant involved in the Home Club contract and asked him to solicit the 
policy for Munoz. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to call the Home Club, but I just didn't feel right in doing it," 
he said. He said he could not explain why he felt uneasy, but he did not 
believe his solicitation was improper. 
</P>
<P>
Munoz said he had never been the broker on an insurance policy for a company 
that received a panel contract. 
</P>
<P>
But when asked about Tubed Products Inc. of Oxnard, which received a $54,960 
panel contract in March, he said he arranged that company's health insurance 
policy for its local plant. 
</P>
<P>
Munoz said Tubed Products called him about the policy, not the other way 
around. Munoz said that is important because he had previously been assured by 
panel lawyer Peter DeMauro that no conflict of interest would exist if a 
company initiated the contact. 
</P>
<P>
DeMauro said Monday that he knew nothing of Munoz's work for Tubed Products and 
would have recommended against it. "I'd say just don't do it," the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
DeMauro said that a year or two ago, Munoz did ask hypothetically whether he 
could be a broker for a company with an Employment Training Panel contract if 
the work was produced by a Munoz employee without his knowledge. DeMauro said 
he told Munoz that he would have to disclose the policy and abstain from all 
activity involving that contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure I've never given the advice that they should . . . contract with 
somebody we have a contract with," DeMauro said. 
</P>
<P>
Munoz, who was appointed to the employment panel by Gov. George Deukmejian in 
1986, said he is comfortable with his service to the state. 
</P>
<P>
"I can honestly say I am very proud of what I have done on the panel," Munoz 
said. "I feel that I have served the governor to the best of my ability."

<P>
TROOPS' REPLIES GIVE STUDENTS AN UP-CLOSE LOOK AT THE MIDEAST

Students in Ventura County who have been writing letters to U.S. troops in 
Saudi Arabia are beginning to get some grateful responses from their military 
pen pals. 
</P>
<P>
And, in the process, they are making some new friends. 
</P>
<P>
Without knowing the name of any individual soldier, Heather Dempster, a 
16-year-old junior at Thousand Oaks High School, wrote a letter to Saudi Arabia 
for the U.S. military to distribute. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did she get a reply -- from Marine Lance Cpl. Kevin Kishner -- she 
received an invitation from Kishner's mother in San Luis Obispo to have dinner 
with the family on Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really excited," said Heather, who is planning to accept the invitation. 
"And I was surprised I received something like this back." 
</P>
<P>
Little by little, students at Thousand Oaks High and Acacia Elementary School 
in Thousand Oaks, who have written to U.S. soldiers stationed in Saudi Arabia 
during the last few weeks, are getting replies. 
</P>
<P>
For these students, the troops are no longer just a large group of khaki-clad 
men and women in a faraway desert, glimpsed on evening news broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
They now have names -- like Marine Lance Cpl. Frankie Sellner of Sleepy Eye, 
Minn., a 24-year-old combat motorcycle messenger who confessed to Acacia 
sixth-grader Rhonda Nesheiwat that he worries about getting lost in the Saudi 
desert. 
</P>
<P>
Marine Sgt. G.W. Clites told Thousand Oaks High cheerleader Niki Zewe that he 
used to date a cheerleader; and Jeffery Bauc, 20, also a Marine lance corporal, 
wrote to Erin Larisey of Acacia that he shared her love for reading and 
encouraged her to pursue her dream to be a writer. 
</P>
<P>
"When I read those letters I started to cry," Acacia Principal Gail Lowe said. 
</P>
<P>
Several pupils in Anne Graham's sixth-grade class at Acacia chose to send 
letters to the troops as part of their "free-write" English assignment. So far, 
10 responses have been received. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of exciting to get a letter from there," said 11-year-old Rhonda, 
who noted that she has responded to Sellner's letter. 
</P>
<P>
Graham said the responses have been good incentives for students to write and 
that they have stimulated an interest in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
At Thousand Oaks High, the 175 sophomores and juniors in Ellen Droshe's history 
classes were required to write to the troops. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel, as history teachers, we have a responsibility to make students aware 
of civics -- whether we feel it's wrong or right to be there," Droshe said. 
</P>
<P>
The responses -- about 20 so far -- have been received with great enthusiasm by 
the students, who read them aloud in class, Droshe said. And they are often 
eye-openers about dramatic cultural differences between the Arabian peninsula 
and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I found out that men cannot speak with women in public, and there's a public 
beating if you get three speeding tickets," Heather said. "I didn't think they 
would take it that far." 
</P>
<P>
Students at both schools were allowed to write whatever they wanted. Many of 
them told the troops about Thousand Oaks, their families, their interests and 
their school activities. Letters were mailed to unnamed soldiers and were 
distributed by the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
Responses from the troops varied. Some spoke about their experiences in Saudi 
Arabia, some talked about their families and some gave advice. 
</P>
<P>
"The hard part of the job is always knowing where I'm at, so I don't get lost," 
said Sellner, the combat motorcycle messenger. "It's a big desert out here, and 
a person doesn't want to get lost." 
</P>
<P>
Clites, the Marine who spoke of dating a cheerleader, said he works "18 hours a 
day, seven days a week and sleep is a luxury." 
</P>
<P>
Marine Lance Cpl. Shannon Louws told his new pen pal, Kelly Goebel of Acacia, 
that his wife, Jacque, of Twentynine Palms "is hangin' in there and giving me 
lots of support." 
</P>
<P>
He also spoke of the uncertainty of the Persian Gulf situation. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be on the move at a moment's notice," he wrote. "We move every day 
to three days . . . We don't know when and if we are to go up north into 
Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
Marine Cpl. Terrance Patterson admonished Acacia's Danielle Bancroft: "Listen 
to your Mom and Dad even though they can be a pain sometimes. They know best." 
</P>
<P>
With rumors of military action increasing, some students say they are worried 
about the fate of their new pen pals. "Now that I've received a letter from 
someone, now I know how they feel and what they're going through, I'm 
concerned," Heather said. 
</P>
<P>
Students said they plan to correspond regularly with their new pen pals. 
</P>
<P>
Heather, who has written 13 letters to undesignated soldiers, said she plans to 
send a photo of herself to Kishner, a 21-year-old Marine who enclosed in his 
letter a snapshot of himself. 
</P>
<P>
She said she feels a kinship with Kishner because they are both originally from 
Detroit, and she has many friends in San Luis Obispo, his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
Heather said, "I'm looking forward to meeting him some day."

MAN SHOT TO DEATH IN FRONT OF 2 YOUNG SONS; 
</P>
<P>
OXNARD: A CONSTRUCTION WORKER IS GUNNED DOWN WHEN HE OPENS THE DOOR OF HIS 
MOTEL ROOM. HIS CHILDREN SAY THEY RECOGNIZED THE KILLER.

<P>
A 46-year-old construction worker was shot and killed in his Oxnard motel room 
as his young sons sat in the room watching television, witnesses said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Perea died of three gunshot wounds to the chest at 8:43 p.m. Sunday at 
St. John's Regional Medical Center, Deputy Coroner Zelmira Isaac said. 
</P>
<P>
Perea was shot when he opened the door to his room at the Sunshine Inn in the 
700 block of West Hueneme Road about 7:50 p.m. Sunday, said motel resident Jack 
Ganza, 29, who rushed to Perea's room when he heard the gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
Ganza said he found Perea bleeding and slumped against the bed. Two boys, ages 
4 and 6, sat on the bed crying, Ganza said. 
</P>
<P>
The children apparently had just come from their bath and were watching 
television when the shooting occurred, Ganza said. 
</P>
<P>
"One kid, all he kept saying was, 'He just shot my dad. He shot my dad,' " 
Ganza said. 
</P>
<P>
Ganza said another motel guest ran to the office to call police, who arrived 
and took the children. 
</P>
<P>
Several guests said Monday that after they heard the shots, they looked out and 
saw a man running past the front office and off the motel grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Ganza, who lives in the motel with his 4-year-old daughter, said the children 
told police they knew the man who shot Perea. The children said that the man 
was named Junior and that they and their father had lived with him and a woman 
at one time, Ganza said. 
</P>
<P>
The homicide is the 16th in Ventura County this year, the coroner's office 
said. Seven of them have been in Oxnard, the Oxnard Police Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard police gave few details of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
Perea apparently was a construction worker from Northern California who moved 
around quite a bit, said Sgt. Denny Phillips of the Oxnard Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Perea frequently stayed at the motel and brought his two children with him, 
according to clerk Bill Chuang. 
</P>
<P>
Perea had checked in Sunday morning, Phillips said.

SLAYING SHOWS LANCASTER ISN'T IMMUNE TO URBAN ILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It's the kind of murder case that makes people in Lancaster realize they don't 
live in a country town anymore: a 14-year-old girl from a devoutly religious 
family is found strangled to death beside a desert road, hours after running 
away from home in a relative's car. 
</P>
<P>
And while Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators have made the slaying of 
Angela Migliore a top priority, they say they have developed few leads since a 
motorist found the girl's body Oct. 11. The Lancaster City Council planned to 
offer a $5,000 reward at its meeting Monday night in hopes that someone will 
come forward with new information. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real high priority case," said Sgt. Jacqueline Franco, a sheriff's 
homicide investigator. Franco has spent weeks talking to people who knew Angela 
and canvassing the neighborhood where the teen-ager apparently abandoned the 
car after slipping out of the house late at night. 
</P>
<P>
"She was 14 years old," Franco said. "We don't want this to happen to anyone 
else up here." 
</P>
<P>
Officials hope the reward will generate the same kind of attention that 
followed the area's first gang-related slaying earlier this year, when a high 
school soccer star died in a shooting outside a party. 
</P>
<P>
The Migliore case is more mysterious. Neighbors and investigators describe the 
Migliore family, who were not available for comment, as religious and strict. 
The Migliores moved to the western Lancaster neighborhood about three years ago 
from Edwards Air Force base after Angela's father, Daniel Migliore, retired 
from the Air Force, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
Angela attended services three or four time a week at Lancaster Baptist Church 
and was an eighth-grade student at the church school, neighbors said. But she 
had also run away from home several times during the past year because of 
family conflicts, according to neighbors and deputies. 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't look rebellious, but the police had been over here a couple of 
times when she ran away before," said a neighbor who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
The neighbor said he was told by Angela's father that on one such occasion the 
teen-ager was found at the residence of a male friend. He said the father had 
described the friend as "rough around the edges." 
</P>
<P>
Angela was last seen by her parents on the night of Oct. 10, when she went to 
bed about 10 p.m., Franco said. She left the house and drove off in her 
brother-in-law's car, which was parked in front of the house, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
A teen-age neighbor, who asked not to be identified, said Angela was angry 
because of an argument with her 17-year-old brother. The neighbor said she had 
run away before because of similar arguments. Investigators would not comment 
on that account. 
</P>
<P>
Angela had planned to meet a female friend in Lancaster and drive to a site 
outside Los Angeles County, which Franco would not disclose. But the two never 
met. The car was found in a residential neighborhood near downtown Lancaster 
the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe Angela, who did not have a license, abandoned the car 
because of engine trouble or because she had difficulty driving. 
</P>
<P>
The girl's parents discovered that she was missing the next morning and called 
deputies. The body was found at about 2:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
There was no evidence in the car of foul play, Franco said. Investigators 
believe the killer dumped Angela's body behind a tumbleweed near 70th Street 
East and Avenue N, east of Lancaster, after strangling her elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies said initially that the girl's clothing was disheveled and 
that she appeared to have been sexually assaulted, but Franco would not comment 
on those reports. 
</P>
<P>
Franco said deputies have not ruled out either the possibility that the killer 
was someone Angela knew or that the attack was committed by a stranger who saw 
the girl on the street at night.

COUNCIL ENDS BID TO WORK AROUND TAX PROPOSITION; 
</P>
<P>
SAN FERNANDO: OFFICIALS CONSIDER ENACTING AN EMERGENCY MEASURE ON THE EVE OF A 
VOTE ON AN INITIATIVE THAT COULD REQUIRE VOTER APPROVAL TO RAISE LEVIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Faced with substantial public opposition, the San Fernando City Council on 
Monday rejected a proposal to authorize itself to enact emergency taxes on 
utilities and cable television service, a defensive move before today's 
balloting on a constitutional amendment restricting tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 angry opponents of the proposal crowded City Hall as council members 
considered the utility users tax, introduced to protect the city from the 
possible effects of Proposition 136. The ballot measure would eliminate the 
ability of local officials to raise taxes without voters' approval. 
</P>
<P>
The audience cheered the measure's defeat. "You're damned if you do. You're 
damned if you don't. I'd rather be damned later than today," said Councilman 
Jose Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, rejected on a 4-1 vote, would have established a framework 
enabling the council to quickly and easily enact emergency taxes on gas, water, 
electricity and telephone and cable TV service -- without asking the voters -- 
in case of a severe economic slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
If the council had acted before the proposition passed, the new tax authority 
would not fall under its restrictions. The measure involved two ordinances: The 
first would have authorized the new taxes, the second would have immediately 
suspended them but reserved the council's power to reimpose them in an 
emergency. 
</P>
<P>
City officials had said any such taxes would not be permanent and would only be 
implemented as a last resort before cutting municipal services. Public hearings 
and a council vote would have been required before any new taxes could be 
implemented. 
</P>
<P>
City officials had said they did not envision actually imposing any new fees in 
the foreseeable future and called the utility users tax a "safety net" that 
would guarantee that municipal services such as police protection would not be 
cut if the city were to fall on tough economic times. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope I don't have to come back and say 'I told you so,' " said Councilman 
Doude Wysbeek, who cast the sole vote for the proposal, referring to 
predictions that the tax limit could cause cuts in essential city services. 
</P>
<P>
Like their counterparts in a number of Southern California cities -- including 
West Hollywood and Compton -- San Fernando city officials were racing to 
approve new municipal taxes before voters statewide decide Proposition 136, 
which would take the issue out of the hands of cities and counties completely. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 136, which would take effect at midnight if approved, would 
prohibit a city or county from enacting a new general-purpose tax or increasing 
an existing one unless a majority of voters approved. A new or increased 
special-purpose tax -- to pay for increased police protection, for instance -- 
could not be enacted without two-thirds voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
A memo by city Finance Director Michael J. Moon said the utility tax was not 
designed as a "long-range revenue source, only as a stopgap measure." City 
Administrator Mary Strenn said the taxes would be implemented only if the city 
were faced with a sudden, severe revenue shortage -- for example, if a large 
retailer moved or went out of business, reducing the city's sales tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
The swiftness with which city officials placed the matter on the agenda 
prompted criticism from San Fernando residents who accused the council of 
trying to sneak the ordinance through at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
Angry residents launched a flurry of petition drives opposing it, gathering 
1,185 signatures, which council members said was a key factor in their 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"This preempts our vote on Proposition 136 and circumvents our right for the 
people to vote on future taxes," said Florine Dickey, who has lived in San 
Fernando for 36 years. "It think it's sneaky. This should have been on the 
agenda a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
City officials denied that they purposely waited until the last minute to 
discuss the ordinance, saying it took two months to research the issue and 
draft the proposed measure.

COLLEGE AGREES TO BACK PAY FOR 8 INSTRUCTORS; 
</P>
<P>
ANTELOPE VALLEY: THE ACTION ENDS A SIX-YEAR BATTLE. A STATE COURT OF APPEAL 
PANEL RULED THAT THE NURSES HAD NOT BEEN COMPENSATED PROPERLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The governing board of Antelope Valley College, having lost a six-year legal 
battle that was one of the longest and costliest in its history, agreed Monday 
to pay more than $350,000 to eight women nursing instructors who claimed they 
had been wrongfully underpaid. 
</P>
<P>
The instructors -- seven who still work at the college and one who has retired 
-- sued in 1984, contending that they had not been given proper salary credit 
for work experience and academic credits. A state Court of Appeal panel sided 
with the instructors in August, capping the long legal battle. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit involved the school's two-tier salary tables, for academic and 
vocational instructors. The suit contended that some of the nursing instructors 
had been wrongly placed on an academic salary schedule, instead of on the 
higher-paid vocational schedule, and that others were ranked too low on the 
vocational schedule. The college has since ceased using the split-salary 
schedules for instructors, but college officials have continued to defend their 
salary practices. 
</P>
<P>
The college board approved the payments by a 5-0 vote -- with no discussion in 
public session -- after emerging from a closed-door meeting with its attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Hoverman -- one of the instructors and president of the faculty union, 
the Antelope Valley College Federation of Teachers -- said she was pleased with 
the outcome but frustrated that it took such a long fight against the college 
to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
Hoverman said the women in her group, which includes all but one of the 
full-time faculty members in the college's Allied Health Division, began their 
lawsuit alleging gender discrimination. But she said they later learned that 
male vocational teachers at the college also had similar problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it's just been a whole, big, unfortunate situation that could have 
been settled years ago for much less," Hoverman said. "They would have saved 
the public quite a bit of money had it been settled in-house." 
</P>
<P>
The court-ordered direct payments amount to $325,273, about two-thirds back 
salaries and about one-third interest on the back salaries. The college also 
will have to pay $9,054 in attorneys fees and court costs for the nurses and an 
estimated $18,000 in added retirement fund payments for them. The women 
received their interest payments last week, but have yet to receive the back 
salary. 
</P>
<P>
The salary and interest payments ranged from a low of $3,916 for Hoverman to a 
high of $91,153 for instructor Emily Pack, according to college officials. The 
payments represent salary adjustments for the instructors for five to 13 years 
of work. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Rosenzweig, the Santa Monica attorney who represented the instructors on 
behalf of their parent union, the California Federation of Teachers, said the 
back pay owed Hoverman is still a subject of dispute with the college and he is 
seeking at least an additional $20,000 for her. 
</P>
<P>
At issue in the case, which the Lancaster-based community college fought 
stubbornly through a change of its president and several shake-ups in its 
governing board, was whether administrators had followed a uniform salary 
schedule in deciding nursing instructors' pay. 
</P>
<P>
In its August ruling, the Court of Appeal found that "there was no consistency" 
in the college's salary decisions. In a July, 1989, decision, Los Angeles 
Superior Court Judge Miriam Vogel found the college had been "careless and 
inconsistent."

PEDESTRIAN DIES AFTER BEING HIT BY CARS ON FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A pedestrian died Monday evening after being struck by several vehicles on the 
Ventura Freeway in Calabasas, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at 6 p.m. on the eastbound Ventura Freeway east of 
Parkway Calabasas, said CHP Officer Robert Strong. 
</P>
<P>
The identity of the victim had not been determined because of the battered 
condition of the body. "We assume it was a male," said Capt. Richard Leitch of 
the Los Angeles County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told authorities "they'd seen someone walking along the freeway," 
Leitch said, but investigators found no abandoned car.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOMB DAMAGES LIQUOR STORE, CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A powerful homemade bomb exploded outside a Van Nuys liquor store late Sunday 
night, hurling shrapnel that shattered windows and severely damaged a parked 
car, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb had been placed on top of a pay telephone outside Adam's Liquor, 
located in a mini-mall at 14556 Vanowen Street, and blew up about 11:30 p.m., 
said Detective Don Tabak of the department's criminal conspiracy unit. 
</P>
<P>
The blast blew out almost all the windows of the liquor store, a restaurant and 
a video store, Tabak said. The damaged car was parked in the mini-mall parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
The stores were closed when the blast occurred and there were no injuries. A 
clerk at Adam's Liquor said the inside of the store was not damaged and that 
all the businesses in the mini-mall were open Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Police had no motive or suspects in the bombing.

I am writing in reference to a letter from Jeanne Kosinski, whose property 
overlooks the proposed golf course in Tujunga Wash. 
</P>
<P>
She doesn't really mean to say the golf course would protect the environment, 
preserve the wildlife and plant life. Get real. What she really means to say is 
the golf course would skyrocket her property value. 
</P>
<P>
I think the wash is one of the few natural settings left. It's beautiful -- 
leave it alone.

Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi's support of uninterrupted play on 
the three Sepulveda golf courses is applauded by members of the Sepulveda Men's 
Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
Our 800-member club has for a long time urged the use of Tillman reclaimed 
water to irrigate these courses in an effort to alleviate a four-year drought. 
Tearing up the courses to lay water mains to carry Tillman water can be 
self-defeating. Reduced fees for shortened courses could cost the city about as 
much as routing those pipes around them. 
</P>
<P>
Keep up the good fight.

A DEFICIT-SPENDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Idon't understand what conclusion to draw from the Sept. 30 article about James 
Salomon, Republican candidate for Congress running against Anthony Beilenson. 
</P>
<P>
Are we to vote for him because we feel sorry for him? After all, he was wealthy 
and made a great deal of money and now he has no income. 
</P>
<P>
Or are we to be aghast at a man who wants to go to Congress and deal with the 
national deficit who doesn't seem to be able to set his own financial house in 
order: 
</P>
<P>
* With no income he drives a $60,000 Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
* He seems to have reneged on child support. 
</P>
<P>
* He failed to pay a $50,000 promissory note to a former business partner. 
</P>
<P>
* He writes checks that bounce. 
</P>
<P>
* And he has piddled away twice as much money as Beilenson has raised long 
before the election. 
</P>
<P>
On second thought, maybe he'll fit right in with the most of Congress. He seems 
to be an expert on deficit spending and wasting other people's money.

PASQUALE'S UNIT IS SPECIAL 
</P>

<P>
It wouldn't have seemed possible a year ago, but the numbers tell the story: 
Statistically at least, the Chargers have the best special teams unit in the 
NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who remembers how poorly the Chargers' special teams played were under 
Joe Madden last season can appreciate the job Larry Pasquale has done in his 
first year on Dan Henning's staff. The dramatic turnaround was climaxed Sunday 
when Nate Lewis returned a punt 63 yards for a touchdown in the Chargers' 31-14 
romp over the Seahawks in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
According to rankings of the 28 NFL clubs in the four major special teams 
categories, the Chargers have an average score of 3.5. They rank second in 
kickoff returns, third in kickoff coverage and punt coverage and sixth in punt 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
The Denver Broncos, who will meet the Chargers on Sunday at San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium, rank second with an average of 6.5. 
</P>
<P>
Rankings are computed on a basis of one point for first place in a given 
category, two for second, etc. 
</P>
<P>
In case the Chargers' figures don't appear impressive, consider those from 
their lamentable 1989 season. Madden's special teams had an average ranking of 
21.3 -- 25th in kickoff coverage, 23rd in punt coverage and punt returns and 
14th in kickoff returns. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long road," Pasquale said Monday. "We started out with a lot of 
things to work on, and we're getting better every game. 
</P>
<P>
"The one team that was sort of disappointing was the punt return team. We had 
our chances, but nothing happened. Then on Nate's return yesterday, everybody 
blocked extremely well and Nate broke it. 
</P>
<P>
"That was really gratifying. It was 17-7 late in the third quarter, and the 
home crowd was waiting for the Seahawks to get things going. If Nate's runback 
wasn't the crowning blow, it was close to it." 
</P>
<P>
Pasquale cited Richard Brown, Darrin Nelson, Walter Wilson, Craig McEwen and 
Steve Hendrickson for making key blocks on Lewis' run. He praised Brown, 
Hendrickson, Cedric Figaro, Donnie Elder, Lester Lyles and Junior Seau for 
their consistency on special teams through the season. 
</P>
<P>
"Brown and Hendrickson are sort of the pace-setters," Pasquale said. "They keep 
things together. Figaro has great upper body strength and reads returns real 
well. Elder is very focused on this phase of the game, and he has added smarts 
in terms of experience. Lyles is probably the most unheralded special teams guy 
we have." 
</P>
<P>
Seau has been criticized for his slow progress at linebacker after being 
drafted No. 1 out of USC, but Pasquale said, "He has been in on a lot of big 
plays on punt returns and kickoff returns. He has learned a lot." 
</P>
<P>
The special teams unit have undergone such a drastic makeover that Henning 
said, "I'm not sure if anybody from last year is still on those teams. We have 
a whole new set of faces. We have different kickers, a different snapper, 
different cover people. 
</P>
<P>
"And we always seem to come up with extra people when we have injuries. Like 
Billy Ray Smith and Gary Plummer yesterday. They went in on one kickoff and 
made the tackle inside the 20." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, there are a few old faces on the special teams unit. Pasquale listed 
Figaro, Lyles, Plummer, Martin Bayless and Sammy Seale as holdovers. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who played part-time at outside linebacker Sunday for the first time 
since missing five games with a pulled stomach muscle, laughed when the subject 
of his stint as a special teams player came up. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of guys were winded, so Gary (Plummer, who although a special teams 
player doesn't usually play on kickoffs) and I went in," Smith said. "That must 
have been the oldest kickoff coverage group in the league." 
</P>
<P>
On a more serious note, Smith said, "Our special teams pretty much took the 
crowd in Seattle out of the game. They were a big key to our win." 
</P>
<P>
Hendrickson, a backup linebacker and H-back, talked about the enthusiasm and 
competitiveness of the special teams players. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's been so intense that guys are fighting to get on (the special 
teams)," he said. "Starters like Gary (Plummer) and Junior (Seau) are as 
gung-ho as the rest of us. It's like wrestling. It's all an individual thing. 
</P>
<P>
"If you meet a guy on the kickoff team, chances are you'll meet the same guy on 
the kickoff return team. If you kick the other guy's butt, it gets his goat. He 
gets frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
Pasquale, who turned out a string of successful special teams with the New York 
Jets before joining the Chargers, noted that his job here has been far more 
complicated. 
</P>
<P>
"The Jets were set," he said. "They all grew up, so to speak, and developed 
togetherness. They established a tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a different situation. First of all, these teams ranked very low last 
year. Second, the players we have now have come in from different teams. It has 
been a matter of building confidence and blending everything together."

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: TOP VOLLEYBALL TEAMS FLOP SPOTS THIS SEASON

<TEXT>
<P>
For the past couple of years the top two girls' volleyball teams in San Diego 
County have been Poway and Torrey Pines. In that order. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, Torrey Pines has worked its way to the top. The Falcons not only 
defeated Poway earlier in the season, but again last Tuesday for the Palomar 
League title. 
</P>
<P>
Now, when people speak of the top two teams, the answer is reversed. Torrey 
Pines and Poway. In that order. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real neat day," Torrey Pines Coach Jim Harrah said of winning the 
league title. "It was a culmination of a lot of hard work and a lot of sweat." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's victory also pushed Torrey Pines ahead of the Titans in the state 
coaches' poll for the first time. Torrey Pines jumped from seventh to third in 
the rankings; Poway remained fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"The girls are excited to be recognized," Harrah said. "Any girl at the age of 
15, 16 or 17 likes to be recognized. But at the same time they're putting it in 
perspective. It's a fine honor but it's not everything to them. It's not going 
to their heads. It's nice but you still have to prove yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Poway had won the league title the past two years and in 1987 Torrey Pines was 
co-champion with Mt. Carmel. This year, however, the Falcons weren't about to 
let that happen again. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the match, the girls said they didn't want to share the title this 
year," Harrah said. "It's been an interesting season. The short-term goal was 
to be strong at the end of the season. The long-term goal was to not only win 
the league but (to be as) prepared for the (section) playoffs as possible and 
possibly go to the state playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
With the realignment of the section playoff divisions this year, Torrey Pines 
and Poway will not meet for a third time this season. Poway remains in Division 
I; Torrey Pines is now in Division II. Poway has won the Division I title the 
past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Poway will play Morse in today's first round of Division I playoffs and Torrey 
Pines meets El Capitan when Division II play opens on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines (24-2) is second-seeded to Helix (28-0) in Division II, Harrah 
said, because Helix defeated Torrey Pines in a tournament two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a much different team now," Harrah said. "The committee seeds the teams 
on head-to-head battles, not on how the teams are doing overall. I talked to 
some parents of the girls the other night and they all said, 'Give us No. 2, it 
gives us motivation and puts the pressure on Helix.' " 
</P>
<P>
Because of Saturday's Times' report on Mike Chamberlain, the Mission Bay High 
School football booster who collapsed because of an arrhythmic attack on his 
heart while watching his son play in Mission Bay's football game Friday, his 
family said it has been flooded with calls and contributions from well-wishers 
at Mission Bay Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"Mission Bay (Hospital) says they've never gotten so many calls for one 
person," Chamberlain's wife, Betsy, said. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla Country Day has had games stopped before the end of fourth quarter 
because of the 45-point rule, but never after one quarter of play. La Jolla 
Country Day defeated Borrego Springs, 50-0, in the first quarter Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really unusual," LJCD Coach Rick Woods said. "Everything happened so 
quickly. We knew Borrego Springs was having a rough year, they only have one 
win. We knew they weren't up to their strength. It was an opportunity to play 
other kids, especially defensively. 
</P>
<P>
"We made five interceptions, our defense kept getting the ball. It's not that 
we ran up the score, they just kept throwing the ball in our hands. After the 
game (Borrego Springs Coach Rod Quigley) said he was sorry he couldn't give us 
a better contest." 
</P>
<P>
Said LJCD linebacker Darren Hamilton, "What the score doesn't indicate is we 
were trying to add a new defense and we were really confused at the start of 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
Kearny's football team broke out of a midseason slump with a 28-0 victory over 
USDHS Friday mainly because it started using Darnay Scott as Notre Dame uses 
Raghib (Rocket) Ismail. Without Scott, a 6-foot-3 split end with 4.3 speed, 
Kearny is not the same team. 
</P>
<P>
Against USDHS, Scott lined up at tailback on one play and scored on a 74-yard 
touchdown run, breaking numerous tackles and spinning off a violent collision 
with a linebacker, which almost knocked off his helmet, en route to the end 
zone. He also caught a 23-yard touchdown pass and had two interceptions. He 
leads the county with nine interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
After starting the season 5-0 and averaging 30-plus points a game, Kearny went 
1-1-1, and averaged 11 points during a three-game stretch, because it wasn't 
getting the ball to Scott. 
</P>
<P>
"Said Kearny offensive coordinator Steve Miner, "(Scott is) a rugged, tough 
football player." 
</P>
<P>
While being surrounded by reporters after he gained 159 yards against Fallbrook 
and became the county's all-time leading rusher, Rancho Buena Vista's Markeith 
Ross, who wanted to shake hands with the opposition, said: "Let me walk through 
here." 
</P>
<P>
It was the only time he asked all night.

SATELLITE TELEVISION MERGER IN BRITAIN FACES OPPOSITION;

COMMUNICATIONS: WHILE THE MONEY-LOSING COMPANIES WORK TO MESH THEIR COMBINED 
OPERATIONS, OFFICIALS RAISE THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE DEAL SKIRTED THE LAW.

<P>
Newlywed satellite networks Sky Television and British Satellite Broadcasting 
were planning how to consolidate their programming and business operations 
Monday as a political outcry against their merger began to swell. 
</P>
<P>
"We have people down at BSB looking at programming, contracts -- everything," 
said Sky spokeswoman Fiona Waters. 
</P>
<P>
With Rupert Murdoch's Sky losing $4 million a week and BSB losing nearly four 
times that, the deal comes as a relief for both companies. 
</P>
<P>
Reaching profitability is expected to be much easier with the new venture. For 
starters, the companies will be free from the crippling expense of battling 
each other -- both in advertising and in bidding wars for programming such as 
films and major sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
The streamlining also will include closing BSB's headquarters and basing the 
new company in Sky's London offices. Hundreds of employees are expected to be 
laid off as the two multichannel networks pare down to one. The two systems' 
nine channels will be reduced to five. 
</P>
<P>
Murdoch, under pressure to relieve his massive debt problems, appears to have 
put a stopper on the biggest single drain in his empire. On the New York Stock 
Exchange, shares of Murdoch's News Corp. jumped $2.125 on Monday to close at 
$9.25. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the merger, the consortium of four media companies that own BSB 
will put up $136.5 million in new working capital, while Murdoch puts up $58.5 
million. BSB will also guarantee a $195-million loan. 
</P>
<P>
When the company becomes profitable, the first $780 million in dividends will 
be split 80-20 in favor of Murdoch. Then, for twice the period that it took to 
reach the first $780 million, profit will be split 50-50. BSB will then receive 
80% of the next $780 million. After that, profit will be shared equally. 
</P>
<P>
The favorable terms for Murdoch are meant to reflect the stronger position held 
by Sky. While both Sky and BSB were losing fantastic sums, Sky had expectations 
of making a profit within two years. 
</P>
<P>
Although BSB is available in 750,000 homes, most of those receive the 
programming service on cable television. Just over 100,000 homes are equipped 
with BSB receiving dishes. 
</P>
<P>
Sky, which has installed 750,000 dishes, can be seen in 1.7 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
Of the five TV channels that will emerge from the venture, two will be 
subscription channels. Both Sky and BSB had realized that pay channels would be 
the best source of income for satellite TV. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's Financial Times -- which is owned by major BSB shareholder Pearson 
PLC -- reported that one of the subscription channels will be a "gold" premium 
channel, with the top films and major sporting events. The second "silver" 
subscription channel will carry an assortment of old and new films and will be 
less expensive. A Sky spokesman declined to comment on the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
Also included in the new network's programming package will be a general 
entertainment channel that will come primarily from Sky. BSB's and Sky's sports 
channels will be combined and Sky's respected all-news station, Sky News, will 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
Dropped from the mix will be BSB's NOW channel, an up-market mix of arts 
programming and talk shows. Gone also will be BSB's MTV-style Power Station. 
The real MTV, transmitted from the same satellite as Sky, can be seen by Sky 
viewers. 
</P>
<P>
Coupled with the fact that most of the hands-on management will come from Sky, 
the new British Sky Broadcasting should be much more a reflection of the old 
Sky than the old BSB. 
</P>
<P>
All of this is troubling for the Independent Broadcasting Authority, which 
regulates commercial television in Britain and awarded BSB a 15-year franchise 
for a domestic satellite TV service. 
</P>
<P>
IBA directors were holding "urgent talks" with principals in the merger Monday. 
"At the moment, everything is under legal consideration," an IBA spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Among IBA concerns is that Murdoch, who owns five national newspapers in 
Britain, may have skirted the country's cross-ownership restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics of the merger, including Lord Thompson of Monifieth, the former 
IBA chairman, are calling the timing of the deal's announcement suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
The Friday night merger announcement came one day after passage of Britain's 
new Broadcasting Act. While the act prohibits owners of national newspapers 
from also controlling more than 20% of a television franchise, the restrictions 
apply only to domestic TV companies. Sky transmits from the Luxembourg-based 
Astra satellite, so Murdoch is exempt from the regulations. 
</P>
<P>
When the cross-ownership provision was being debated in Parliament, Labor 
members had sought wording that would make the restrictions apply to Murdoch 
and Sky as well. Members of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative 
Party argued that Murdoch was not being awarded a protected franchise -- like 
BSB -- but instead was taking a huge financial risk on his own. Therefore, he 
deserved more leeway. 
</P>
<P>
The vote, largely along party lines, allowed Murdoch's company to retain its 
newspapers and its 100% ownership of Sky. 
</P>
<P>
There have been suggestions that the merger was not announced until it was too 
late to change Murdoch's status in the Broadcasting Act. But Sky and BSB 
officials say the timing was coincidental. 
</P>
<P>
Labor Party officials have declared the new venture "very unhealthy" for the 
nation and called for an investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers 
Commission.

UPI TELLS UNION TO ACCEPT PAY CUTS OR FACE LIQUIDATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NEW YORK

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
United Press International on Monday told its 350 union employees that the 
money-losing news service will be liquidated later this month unless they 
accept 35% pay cuts for 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
Management of the news service, which is a unit of New York-based 
Infotechnology Inc., said the cuts were needed to make UPI attractive to the 
six bidders that management says are considering purchasing the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Pieter Vanbennekom, executive vice president of UPI, told employees in a memo 
that a "no" vote from the membership would mean the organization couldn't meet 
the payroll or other obligations for two weeks. "Therefore, we will have to 
take the once-unthinkable step of putting UPI into liquidation," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, union leaders promptly announced that they would oppose the 
request, and it was not clear that the proposal would receive a warmer 
reception from the membership, which has made a series of contract concessions 
as UPI has changed hands three times in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"We have little doubt that UPI needs a lot of money, and needs it fast, but 
they're coming to the wrong people," said Chris Dahl, secretary-treasurer of 
the Wire Service Guild, which represents the employees. "People here can't 
survive on a 35% pay cut. And once you give it away, I don't think you're going 
to see it back, even in the rosiest scenario." 
</P>
<P>
Union balloting on the question will be completed Nov. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Milt Capps, a UPI spokesman, said the pay cuts were needed to "buy time to 
allow us to identify and negotiate with prospective buyers." But he said there 
would be no guarantee that UPI would return salaries to their current levels 
after 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to review that, obviously, as we go along," Capps said. "It's far 
too early to call that." 
</P>
<P>
Guild employees with eight years' experience earn $690 a week, while first-year 
reporters or photographers make $360 a week, said Dahl. He said UPI 
compensation has changed little in recent years; the current figures include a 
3% raise added after negotiations earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The 83-year-old news service was purchased in late 1989 by Infotechnology, 
which also owns 47% of Financial News Network; 58% of Comtex Scientific Corp., 
which distributes UPI's electronic feed, and all or part of a number of other 
small companies. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials won't disclose UPI's financial results, but sources close to 
the situation were told that the organization has been losing money at a rate 
of about $2.8 million a month. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, UPI officials fired an undisclosed number of management employees to 
cut costs. As of Friday, the company stopped offering severance pay for 
non-union employees and said it no longer would give notice before laying off 
non-union employees. 
</P>
<P>
The demand for a 35% pay cut came in an eight-hour negotiating session last 
Friday between the guild and management in Philadelphia. UPI management first 
told union leaders that they would begin a corporate liquidation Wednesday 
unless the union agreed to the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Later, however, management agreed to allow guild members to cast ballots 
according to their current rules. 
</P>
<P>
UPI's operations have been sharply scaled back in recent years. About 150 guild 
members have been laid off since August, Dahl said. As recently as 1987, the 
guild unit had 800 members. 
</P>
<P>
UPI was subsidized for years by its founding parent, E. W. Scripps Co., and was 
last profitable in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
The news service has struggled for several reasons, including the lack of 
financing from its original parent, the consolidation of the newspaper industry 
and the rise of supplemental news services, such as the Los Angeles 
Times-Washington Post and the New York Times services.

VEHICLE SALES UP 5.7%, BUT MANY IN INDUSTRY FRET; 
</P>
<P>
AUTOS: THEY SAY THE OUTLOOK IS WORSENING. ANXIOUS DEALERS HAVE BEEN CUTTING 
BACK ON ORDERS.

<P>
Car and truck sales were better this October than last, but that isn't saying 
much, industry executives, dealers and analysts noted Monday. With some 
exceptions, they reported a steadily worsening sales outlook. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 companies building cars and trucks in America posted a modest 5.7% daily 
sales increase over the previous October (904,754 total units sold this year 
versus 824,148 last year). 
</P>
<P>
That increase, however, masked a falloff in dealer orders that is blamed for 
upcoming production cuts. Worker layoffs and rollbacks, scheduled for November 
and December, were announced last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Sales are not the greatest. They kind of stink," said Jerry Brunner, general 
manager at Stella Buick in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
A year earlier, sales in October and November were undercut by elaborate sales 
contests and discounts in September. They were aimed at unloading unsold 
1988-model cars from dealer lots. 
</P>
<P>
Sales were particularly bad last year at General Motors, which helps to explain 
GM's relatively strong year-to-year sales increase of 9% in cars and light 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Still, not even GM tried to put on a cheery face. "We expect increased 
competitive pressures as manufacturers respond to slower dealer ordering 
patterns due to declining consumer confidence and fluctuating market 
conditions," said J. B. Fitzpatrick, marketing vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Despite rising gasoline prices and economic uncertainty since the Aug. 2 
invasion of Kuwait, there has been no outright collapse in car sales. 
</P>
<P>
They have generally continued at the weak pace that has prevailed all year, 
except for certain of the foreign-owned "transplant" auto makers building cars 
here. Japanese auto makers, selling American-built as well as imported cars in 
the United States, continue to eat away at the market share of U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
GM and Ford Motor Co. reported surprisingly weak financial results last week. 
They have announced temporary plant closings in November and December, idling 
tens of thousands of workers. Chrysler Corp. reported a $214-million loss. 
</P>
<P>
Weaker-than-expected earnings were blamed partly on the auto industry's 
increasingly costly system of rebates, underscoring how hard it is to sell cars 
these days. The average rebate is said to exceed $1,200 per car. 
</P>
<P>
Now, dealers nationwide are grumbling about lower customer traffic and weaker 
sales. In turn, they have slashed new-car orders. Potential buyers "are really 
holding on to their money," said Tom Lamberto, sales manager at Gengas 
Chrysler-Plymouth in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said one explanation for the seemingly more favorable sales reports 
from auto makers -- in contrast to dealers' complaints -- is the bigger role 
played by fleet sales in the overall auto market. Sales to fleet buyers tend to 
be less volatile than sales to the general public, and October is a big sales 
month for fleets. 
</P>
<P>
But others, including auto analyst Clifford J. Swenson of Economic Consulting 
&amp; Planning Inc. in New York, believe that underlying car sales aren't as 
bad as suggested by the weak dealer orders. By this line of reasoning, dealers 
are responding more to predictions of a recession than to how many cars they 
are selling. 
</P>
<P>
"The dealers at this point are very nervous," Swenson said. "They're the ones 
who end up carrying excess inventory, if sales fall off. We are, overall, very 
optimistic compared to the general outlook. The industry is planning for a 
recession, but whether that emerges is another question entirely." 
</P>
<P>
Sales in October equalled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.1 million 
domestic cars, Ford officials estimated. That is about what it has been all 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit-based companies reported a sales increase of 6.1% in cars but a 
1.2% drop in trucks in October. Transplant car sales surged 36.5%, and served 
to replace sales of imports, which dropped 9.2 %. 
</P>
<P>
Ford car sales slipped 1.6% for the month while Chrysler's improved 6.3%. 
</P>
<P>
Sales rose 13% at Honda, 138% at Mazda, 23% at Nissan and 73% at Toyota, which 
said it had the best October in its U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
"Sales are excellent -- very excellent," said Joe Pestano, sales manager at 
Downey Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi sales dropped 1.2 %. 
</P>
<P>
Researcher Amy Harmon in Detroit contributed to this story.

Carter Hawley Plans to Buy Shares: The profit-sharing plan of Carter Hawley 
Hale Stores will begin purchasing shares of the company on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
The company, owner of the Broadway-Southern California and four other 
department store chains, said about $6 million to $7 million will be available 
over the next six months for the purchases. The move marked a switch from last 
year, when Carter Hawley began issuing new shares of stock to the plan. The 
previous approach raised money for Carter Hawley, but was criticized in some 
circles for diluting share values.

S&amp;P Lowers Citicorp Debt Rating: Standard &amp; Poor's said it lowered 
ratings on about $22 billion of debt and preferred stock of the nation's 
largest bank and various units, a move that analysts say could reignite concern 
about the financial state of the nation's banks. Citing Citicorp's rising 
credit problems, the rating company downgraded the bank's senior debt to single 
A-plus, from double A-minus. S&amp;P said "the lower rating reflects S&amp;P's 
expectation that asset quality will continue to deteriorate, albeit at a slower 
pace than that of the past year."

Markets Overreacted on Banks, Seidman Says: Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
Chairman L. William Seidman said in a Los Angeles speech that stock investors 
have overreacted to concern that banks could develop problems similar to those 
plaguing the savings and loan industry. Noting that major banks are still 
making money, he said he believed that the FDIC can meet its insurance 
obligations, provided the nation does not slip into deep recession.

ANONYMITY MAKES ELECTRONIC BOARDROOM WORK; 
</P>
<P>
MANAGEMENT: A NEW MEETING SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS EMPLOYEES TO BRAINSTORM THROUGH 
COMPUTERS IS PROVING TO BE PRODUCTIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Brainstorming and consensus-building are two goals of business meetings that go 
by the boards once a dominant personality turns a gathering into his or her own 
private sounding board. Less forceful participants -- and their ideas -- are 
likely to fade into the background, depriving the business of valuable input. 
</P>
<P>
A new and somewhat revolutionary computer network product is designed to make 
business meetings more democratic and productive. The "electronic meeting" 
system developed at the University of Arizona creates a freer and faster flow 
of ideas by enabling participants to respond electronically, simultaneously -- 
and anonymously -- on computer terminals. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have found is that when people are addressing superiors, they tend to 
qualify what they are saying, to couch it in terms that are more palatable when 
in fact what they want to say is, 'This is never going to work,"' said Jay 
Nunamaker, the University of Arizona computer science professor who directed 
the system's development. 
</P>
<P>
The anonymity of the system, which was developed with financial support from 
International Business Machines, makes such employees free to express 
themselves candidly, Nunamaker said. It allows ideas to be judged by others in 
the group on merit alone, not according to the source. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem (with conventional meetings) has always been that some ideas don't 
get discussed by people who might be intimidated. And the dominant ones can 
change the focus or expand the meeting away from its original purpose," said 
George Easton, who with his wife, Annette, runs a system that was installed 
recently at San Diego State University's business school. 
</P>
<P>
Both Eastons are SDSU assistant professors who helped develop software for the 
system at the University of Arizona as graduate students. SDSU's electronic 
meeting system recently became operational and is being made available to San 
Diego-area groups and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The system consists of a dozen or more computer terminals arranged around a 
table and tied electronically by local area network (LAN) software. A 
facilitator helps the group set priorities and to vote -- also on an anonymous 
basis -- on which ideas are best. An overhead projector displays the topics at 
hand and the group's decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the system say it leads to a more focused discussion and brings 
the group toward decisions more quickly than would a conventional meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Marketing of the systems, which sell for up to $120,000, has just begun but the 
organizations that have used them -- including Southern New England 
Telecommunications, the U.S. Army, Greyhound Financial Corp. and Phelps Dodge 
-- all describe it as a highly useful management tool. 
</P>
<P>
Each customer hastens to add that the systems are simply management tools and 
that they will never completely replace conventional, face-to-face meetings. 
There are settings in which verbal skills -- the ability to express oneself 
logically and persuasively -- are paramount. But the electronic systems fill 
the bill when a free flow of information and ideas is desired and when the 
decisions to be made cut across organizational lines. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Southern New England Telecommunications, a New Haven, Conn.-based 
telephone utility and holding company, used the system to arrive at a consensus 
on what kind of desktop publishing and networking software to use in five of 
the company's departments. 
</P>
<P>
A team of 10 people representing the five departments were put on the system 
and in one day "defined their software problem, set down specific goals and 
objectives and ended up with action plans that were actually carried out in 30 
days," said Ray Fletcher, general manager of information systems for the 
utility. "All that was done in one meeting day and everyone ended up happy with 
the result," Fletcher said. 
</P>
<P>
Had a traditional face-to-face meeting format been used, Fletcher said, four 
meetings would have been required for a decision and two months to carry out 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher believes that the electronic meeting system's imperative of planning 
meetings in terms of "problems, goals and objectives" are a key to its 
efficiency. Also, participants usually leave the meetings with their marching 
orders: hard copy "output" with written goals or decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The systems, which are being marketed both by IBM and a company called Ventana 
that is partly owned by the University of Arizona, deals head-on with the 
age-old management problem of how an idea can "take on more or less value 
according to who said it," Nunamaker said. 
</P>
<P>
The professor, who is also Ventana's board chairman, said another key to the 
system's efficiency is its "parallel processing" feature, allowing participants 
to communicate at once by typing their comments simultaneously into the system, 
rather than waiting for a turn to speak, as is the case in conventional 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"In a conventional one-hour meeting, if you have 15 people and everyone 
participates equally, each gets four minutes of air time. You are doing a lot 
of listening," Nunamaker said. "With this system, if you have everyone 
participating at once, you get 60 minutes of everyone's time. That's a big 
change in productivity." 
</P>
<P>
James D. Gantt, chief of the U.S. Army's management information systems 
division based in Ft. Huachuca, Ariz., said the system has proven particularly 
effective in his "highly hierarchical organization" because of the freedom it 
affords lower-ranking Army personnel to speak their minds. 
</P>
<P>
Gantt said the system has proven a big help in strategic planning and in making 
budgetary decisions because both are situations in which "you want a lot of 
give and take of ideas . . . and (to make) trade-offs among a lot of different 
people representing different viewpoints." 
</P>
<P>
Greyhound Financial Corp. of Phoenix was so pleased with its use of the 
University of Arizona's electronic meeting system that it is building its own 
special facility, said president Sam Eichenfield. The electronic meeting system 
is tailor-made to resolve sensitive issues and conflicts between departments 
with different goals, such as sales and credit departments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, 90% of Greyhound Financial's 160 employees will have access to the 
system. "I want to make certain that I'm really getting what people really feel 
-- not just what they think I want them to say," Eichenfield said.

Investors Sue Laventhol &amp; Horwath: The lawsuit alleged that the accounting 
firm prepared a fraudulent marketing study with unrealistically optimistic 
projections about room and occupancy rates at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel, said 
Caroline Barron, an attorney for 48 limited partners of Leper/DBL Baltimore 
Associates. The study also underestimated renovation and modernization costs by 
millions of dollars and mistakenly concluded that other area luxury resorts 
would not be developed, the partners' suit said.

IBM, Northern Telecom Inc. and Nynex Corp. on Monday announced a product that 
links incoming phone calls at a company or organization with computerized 
information on the caller. 
</P>
<P>
The system will make it easier, for example, for customer service 
representatives at a mail-order house to handle inquiries and for public-safety 
officials at a college to locate a caller in an emergency, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, such systems were available only to companies owning expensive 
in-house phone switching systems. 
</P>
<P>
The new system is aimed at companies and organizations that do not have their 
own private phone system. It operates through the electronic central-office 
switch of the local phone company. 
</P>
<P>
The systems match the number of an incoming phone call with a computer file. 
The file then pops up on a screen, using the same telephone network technology 
as residential "caller ID" systems that flash the number of an incoming call on 
a small screen near the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, a customer's file would appear on a screen at a mail-order 
catalogue company where that customer has an account.

INVESTORS STILL LEERY OF SMALL BANKS, DESPITE SOLID EARNINGS REPORTS; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: BSD BANCORP, AMONG OTHERS, HAS WATCHED HELPLESSLY AS STOCK VALUE HAS 
FALLEN AMID RISING PROFITS.

<P>
To borrow from Charles Dickens, these are the best of times and the worst of 
times for BSD Bancorp, the parent company of Bank of San Diego, Coast Bank and 
American Valley Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The bank holding company recently reported its third consecutive quarter of 
record profits; non-performing loans at BSD's banks are a respectable 1.9% of 
total loans, and Findley Reports, a Brea-based bank consulting firm, recently 
described BSD's banks as "premiere performers." 
</P>
<P>
But BSD executives and their counterparts at most other local financial 
institutions have watched helplessly in recent months as their stocks have 
plummeted in value. Those drops have occurred despite reports of solid 
quarterly earnings and no real evidence of increased problem loans, according 
to Irving Katz, director of research for Thomas Green/San Diego Securities. 
</P>
<P>
* BSD Bancorp, which hit a 1990 high of $10 early in the year, closed Monday at 
$5, up from its yearly low of $4.50. 
</P>
<P>
* First National Corp., which hit a high of $21.50 early in the year, closed 
Monday at $11.875, near its yearly low of $11. 
</P>
<P>
* SDN Bancorp, which owns San Diego National Bank, matched its yearly low by 
closing at $7.25 on Monday, below its yearly high of $12. 
</P>
<P>
* Only SD Financial, the parent company of San Diego Trust &amp; Savings, which 
is San Diego's largest independent bank, has shown upward movement. The stock 
is trading at $250, up from $235 on Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Investors are wary of smaller financial institutions because "they have a 
smaller base to take the risk against," Katz said. "Look at Rancho Bernardo 
Savings Bank (which was seized late last month by federal regulators). . . . 
One bad loan can wipe small institutions out." 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't seem to matter what (bankers) say, nobody believes them," said 
Campbell K. Chaney, a San Francisco-based financial industry analyst with Sutro 
&amp; Co. "What the stock market seems to be saying is that, ok, you have 
fantastic earnings, but you're only postponing some big loss until later on." 
</P>
<P>
During a speech last month at a national bankers convention, U.S. Comptroller 
of the Currency Robert Clarke said bankers have done "too little and have been 
too late in acknowledging their losses." That lapse leaves the industry with an 
image that is "more tarnished today than it has been in a half a century," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
BSD and other small, local banks face an uphill battle, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no market for small-capitalization stocks in general, not just the 
banks," he said. "NASDAQ volumes are at a three-year low, and the Value Line 
Composite is at a five-year low." 
</P>
<P>
Smaller-capitalization banks such as Bank of San Diego might still be reporting 
profits, but investors have been blinded by poor earnings reports turned in 
recently by the nation's larger banks, said BSD Bancorp President Vito J. 
Guarino Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"They compare us to Wells Fargo, which is down 50%, when our earnings are 
actually up 34%," Guarino said. "We should be doing better (in the market), we 
shouldn't be marked down" because of problems at bigger banks. 
</P>
<P>
BSD's stock has also been hurt by a three-paragraph story in the Oct. 29 issue 
of Forbes magazine that described BSD as one of 13 potentially "unlucky" 
California banks where construction, development and land loans represent 19% 
or more of total assets. In the article, Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst for 
Tucker, Anthony in Portland, Me., suggested that the 13 banks could be swamped 
by problem loans if California's economy stalls. Investor reaction to the 
article was swift and unkind to BSD, where development-related loans accounted 
for 27% of total assets on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost 20% of our market capitalization" in the days after the article 
appeared, Guarino said. "We were pummeled in the marketplace following the 
article . . . despite just having had three record quarters and an increased 
dividend." 
</P>
<P>
Guarino acknowledged that BSD has a relatively heavy dependence on real 
estate-related loans. But he said that dependence is tempered by the fact that 
BSD's banks have "zero exposure" in the state's overbuilt office-building 
segment. 
</P>
<P>
BSD instead has stuck to entry-level single-family and multiple-family housing. 
And it has stuck largely to making loans in San Bernardino and Riverside 
counties, which are generally thought to be the most recession-resistant 
counties in Southern California, Guarino said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's entitled to his own opinion," he said of the Forbes article. 
</P>
<P>
"But what (the article's author) did was silly and childish. . . . He doesn't 
understand what's going on around here. . . . California is not New England." 
</P>
<P>
C. Donald Allen, chairman of Cupertino National Bancorp, a Cupertino-based 
institution that also was included on the Forbes list, argued that the article 
was simplistic because it failed to distinguish among banks with different 
kinds of real estate loans. 
</P>
<P>
"Our real estate loans are all residential," Allen said. "We've got none of the 
commercial ones that are giving Northeastern banks fits. . . . We have no 
delinquent real estate, our capital (ratio) is at 9.5% . . . and we've never 
lost a dime." 
</P>
<P>
Cupertino National, with $120 million in assets, recently began a local 
advertising campaign that explains "why we're different" from troubled S&amp;Ls 
and the larger banks, Allen said. Next year, it will for the first time use a 
"dog-and-pony show" that will carry the institution's message to banking 
industry analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Guarino acknowledged that BSD has little choice but to continue pressing its 
case to stock analysts in the East. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we're being terribly misperceived at this stage of the game," he 
said. "People back East are being totally irrational. Their egos are giving 
them problems. . . . They don't want you to confuse them with facts."

David J. Dunn, founder and general partner of Idanta Partners, describes 
himself as an "occasional" contrarian who sometimes buys severely depressed 
stocks with the expectation that, in the long run, they will see rosier days. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn said Monday that Idanta's recent purchase of 7.2% of troubled HomeFed 
Corp.'s outstanding shares is comparable to the La Jolla-based investment 
firm's 1972 acquisition of stock in two large advertising agencies that were 
then nearing record market lows. It took the badly battered agencies several 
years to rebound, but Idanta eventually "made very good money on them," Dunn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Idanta, which in recent weeks has acquired 1.6 million HomeFed shares at prices 
ranging from $4.54 to $6.675 per share, has also acquired relatively small 
positions in Wells Fargo and Security Pacific banks. 
</P>
<P>
Idanta's investment in HomeFed, which was announced Friday afternoon, helped 
push the San Diego thrift up $.75 to $5.875 on Monday. The stock was trading as 
high as $33.25 in June, when it reported a sharp increase in bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn said he has no assurances that HomeFed, Wells Fargo or Security Pacific 
won't sink even further. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to be bottom-fishing now," he said. "But I learned some time ago that 
you can think you're at the bottom and fall through" to a new, lower stock 
price. Dunn declined to say whether Idanta will acquire additional HomeFed 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't buy (real estate-related stocks) in California unless I was willing 
to suffer through a continuing downturn and see some decline in values," Dunn 
said. "We're not predicting that the market in real estate is going to turn up 
this year or even in 1991." 
</P>
<P>
Idanta, which has never invested heavily in banks or savings and loans, began 
acquiring financial-institution stock in recent weeks because they are "really 
undervalued securities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed "seemed to have faced up" to its problem loans by setting aside 
adequate reserves during recent quarters, Dunn said. "But we have no insights 
into (the S&amp;L) other than what we get from reading their reports and 
commentaries in the newspaper," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn and Idanta aren't the only investors hoping to snare eventual profits by 
bottom-fishing in the generally depressed financial industry. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Buffett on Oct. 24 became Wells Fargo's largest shareholder by acquiring 
5.03 million, or 9.8%, of the giant bank's outstanding shares. News of the 
acquisition pushed Wells Fargo stock up $1.375 to $50.50. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn, who cautioned that financial institutions probably are not wise choices 
for investors who concentrate on short-term gains, noted that Buffett once 
defined long-term as "forever." 
</P>
<P>
Dunn said Idanta's long-term outlook in the stock market often means keeping 
stocks for as long as five years before trading them. Idanta takes an even 
longer view in its venture-capital investments, where the partnership maintains 
holdings for as long as 20 years, Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
The investment firm's principal owners are the Bass family of Texas. Idanta, 
with a total investment portfolio valued at $100 million, is best known for 
investments in high-technology stocks such as Apple Computer, Sun Microsystems 
and Intel. 
</P>
<P>
It has also provided venture capital to a number of start-up high-tech firms, 
including Pacific Communications Sciences of San Diego and Iomega of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn on Monday repeated that Idanta views HomeFed as an investment, and that 
the firm has no intention of trying to take over the S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn said Idanta made the investment without alerting Robert F. Bass, one of 
Idanta's investors, who heads the group that acquired Stockton-based American 
Savings. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd honestly forgotten that Bob was in American," Dunn said. A Bass 
representative "called on Friday to remind me of that . . . (but) the Basses 
are inactive partners, and I'd say it had been years since I'd talked to them." 
</P>
<P>
Dunn formerly served as chairman of Prime Computer, a Natick, Mass.-based 
company that Idanta had helped capitalize in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Idanta remained one of the computer company's largest shareholders until the 
firm was sold to a New York investment firm in 1989.

REPORTERS OF AVOCADO THEFT GET THE GREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Avocado Commission has paid out more than $10,000 in the past 
four months to 26 people statewide who reported or captured avocado thieves. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County residents took in about a third of the total $10,234 awarded. 
</P>
<P>
The reward money is being disbursed from a $30,000 fund the commission 
established in July. The reward is part of a $774,000 anti-theft program that 
included the hiring of a three-member undercover investigation unit of county 
sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Avocado theft became a lucrative enterprise as the wholesale price of avocados 
in recent years approached and then exceeded $1 a pound, commission spokesman 
Howard Seelye said. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County, Valley Center was the avocado theft hotbed during the past 
four months. The rural community was the scene of all five county thefts in 
which witnesses intervened or took time to report what they saw to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Ten different San Diego County residents were given reward money in amounts 
ranging from less than $100 to as much as $1,000, with the highest amounts 
going to witnesses whose reports resulted in convictions. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 19 thefts were reported in San Diego, Riverside and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
Cumulatively, the eyewitness reports led to the recovery of about $10,000 worth 
of fruit that otherwise would have been sold on the black market. 
</P>
<P>
The commission estimates thieves steal 5% to 10% of the state's annual crop, a 
volume that, at this year's wholesale price of $2.25 per pound, is valued at 
between $10 million and $20 million, Seelye said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Barbour, an inspection official, said the reward program and increased 
publicity about avocado thefts has helped break the public's previous apathy 
over the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're seeing is a heightened public interest in reporting avocado 
thefts," Barbour said.

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 18% from its peak near 3,000, 
the NASDAQ composite is down 30% and is at a three-year low, according to 
Irving Katz, director of research for Thomas Green/San Diego Securities. The 
Value Line Composite stock index, which closely mimics small stock performance, 
is selling at a five-year low, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
Trading volume in over-the-counter stocks is at its lowest level in two years, 
and the smaller-capitalization stocks have suffered the greatest, with volume 
all but non-existent and prices headed down, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week saw nine new lows in San Diego stocks. Burnham Pacific Properties hit 
a new low of $10.50 after reporting poor third-quarter earnings. Intermark sank 
to a new low of $2.50, despite announcing that it had hired a financial adviser 
to oversee the sale of its National Airmotive division. 
</P>
<P>
Advanced Marketing Services recorded a new low of $1 on heavy volume but 
recovered to close the week at $1.625. The company announced a 1-million share 
buyback, which, if completed, would retire 17% of outstanding shares. 
</P>
<P>
Xscribe reported a new low of $.03125 as Quixote terminated a planned 
acquisition at $.25 per share. Other new lows were reported by Great American 
Bank, Molecular Biosystems, IRT Corp., DH Technology and Infrasonics. 
</P>
<P>
There were a number of good gains for the week, Katz said, with Price Co. up $3 
to $33.50 as it continued to recover from its low of $26.50 just three weeks 
ago. Price's 1990 high was $48.25, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed Corp. gained $1, to $5.875, after Idanta Partners disclosed its recent 
purchase of 7.2% of the thrift's outstanding shares. Other good gains were made 
by Xytronyx, up $1.75; Molecular Biosystems, which rebounded from its low to 
close the week at $14.75, and Gensia Pharmaceuticals, up $1.125. Magma Power 
and WD-40 each gained $1.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: FAN MARKETER TO RAISE UP TO $2.5 MILLION WITH STOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beverly Hills Fan Co., a North Hollywood-based marketer of ceiling fans, hopes 
to raise up to $2.5 million with an initial public offering of stock. 
</P>
<P>
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it 
plans to offer 833,334 shares for about $3 each, representing about 31% of 
Beverly Hills Fan after the offering is completed. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which earned $326,800 on sales of $3.81 million in the nine months 
that ended July 31, sells about 40% of its fans to The Home Depot, a chain of 
home-improvement stores. Most of Beverly Hills Fan's products are made in 
Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills Fan plans to use the offering's proceeds to retire debt, acquire 
more inventory and for general expansion. The offering is being underwritten by 
A.M. Levine &amp; Co.

3RD-QUARTER OFFICE VACANCY RATE FALLS TO ITS LOWEST POINT SINCE 1988; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: A REPORT SAYS RECENT CONSTRUCTION WAS RELATIVELY LIGHT AND THAT 
THE AMOUNT OF SPACE BEING BUILT IS THE LEAST OF ANY MAJOR SOUTHLAND MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The average office vacancy rate in the San Fernando, Conejo and Santa Clarita 
valleys in the third quarter fell 0.4 percentage points to 13.6%, its lowest 
point since the end of 1988, the real estate firm Grubb &amp; Ellis Co. 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The company said 2.95 million square feet of office space was vacant out of a 
total available of 21.7 million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The decline reflected strong "net absorption," or an increase in occupied 
office space, in the central part of the San Fernando Valley, which includes 
Encino, Sherman Oaks and Van Nuys, Grubb &amp; Ellis said. The openings of the 
91,000-square-foot Industrial Bank Building in Van Nuys and the 
45,000-square-foot Home Plaza Building in Sherman Oaks contributed to the gain. 
</P>
<P>
The office vacancy rate provides a clue to whether there is a glut of office 
space available in the region, whether it's priced at levels attractive to 
business, and whether new construction of offices is keeping pace with 
companies' expansion plans. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest quarter, completed new construction was relatively light at 
197,000 square feet, and much of that space was pre-leased before the buildings 
opened, Grubb &amp; Ellis said. There is an additional 1.3 million square feet 
currently being built, which is the lowest of any major market in Southern 
California, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
The market "performed at a consistent level of absorption" in the third 
quarter, Howe S. Foster, senior vice president in Grubb &amp; Ellis' Sherman 
Oaks office, said in a statement. "It has now held steady in the 13% to 15% 
range over the last year." 
</P>
<P>
The rate has generally stayed below 15% for the last three years after soaring 
to 21% in late 1986, when a rash of new office complexes were built. The rate 
then dropped as low as 12% in late 1988 before climbing back to the 13% to 15% 
range.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: SFE TECHNOLOGIES TO SELL WEST-CAP SUBSIDIARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SFE Technologies, a San Fernando electronics company, said it reached a 
tentative agreement to sell its West-Cap Arizona subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
SFE did not disclose the terms of the agreement, and said only that the 
potential buyer was "a privately held company headquartered in the Midwest." 
</P>
<P>
The deal still depends on the buyer arranging "satisfactory financing," 
according to SFE. 
</P>
<P>
SFE also said its investment bankers are still looking for a buyer for its San 
Fernando division. 
</P>
<P>
If SFE sold both divisions, it would still have manufacturing facilities in 
Concord, N. C., and Nogales, Sonora, Mexico.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: ACCLAIMED FATHER, DAUGHTER TEAM UP FOR 
PERFORMANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Growing up, trumpet and fluegelhorn player Stacy Rowles was jazzed early on. 
Her father, pianist Jimmy Rowles, played host to a steady stream of famous 
visitors at their home in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
"Ben Webster used to sit me on his knee when I was 4. Billie Holiday held me 
when I was 6 months old," said Rowles, who takes the stage with her father at 8 
p.m. Friday and Saturday at All That Jazz, the new club adjoining the Wall St. 
Cafe in Rancho Bernardo. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Rowles is 72 and in precarious health. He seldom plays clubs, so this is 
a rare opportunity to hear an authentic original who came up in the big bands 
of Benny Goodman, Woody Herman, Tommy Dorsey and Bob Crosby. He went on to 
accompany such great singers as Holiday, Sarah Vaughan and Ella Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1960s, Rowles spent a good portion of his time working on movie 
soundtracks before going back to jazz full-time in the mid-'70s and building on 
his reputation for Ellington-inspired piano work on a variety of compositions 
by the Duke and his associate, Billy Strayhorn. 
</P>
<P>
Rowles has recorded as a leader and with Stan Getz, Zoot Sims, Ray Brown, 
George Mraz and others. He's been up for a Grammy five times, including a 
nomination for his 1982 solo piano album of music by Ellington and Strayhorn. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, his daughter's career is picking up steam. Stacy Rowles' resume is 
almost as extensive as her father's, including work with bandleader Herman, Joe 
Pass, Marian McPartland, Red Callender and Tommy Flanagan. In September, she 
toured Europe with the Jazz Tap Ensemble and during October, played several 
dates in France. 
</P>
<P>
She alternates between fluegelhorn and trumpet. She likes the rich, velvety 
sound of the fluegelhorn, and when she plays trumpet, she usually tempers its 
bite with a mute. She names Freddie Hubbard, Clark Terry, Art Farmer and Chuck 
Mangione as influences. 
</P>
<P>
Her last album "Looking Back," released a year ago, includes her father plus 
Donald Bailey on drums and Eric Von Essen on bass. 
</P>
<P>
Rowles said she expects this weekend's fare to consist primarily of standard -- 
"jazz standards, not pop, rooted in be-bop. Dad has such a great knowledge of 
tunes that he has written me a beautiful library of tunes you just don't hear 
anymore, standards most people don't remember." 
</P>
<P>
Elario's makes a significant break with tradition this week by featuring fusion 
keyboardist Rob Mullins for five nights, beginning tomorrow. Actually, Mullins 
doesn't like to label his music, and considers himself a jazz player first and 
foremost, but this is the first time Elario's has headlined an electric jazz 
band with a commercial radio following in one of its prime five-night slots. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy playing a lot of different styles of music," Mullins said. "I'm sure a 
lot of people are going to come in and wonder, 'Can these guys play?' and 'Is 
this jazz?' We would say 'Yes' to both. The way that I look at jazz, I think 
it's still growing and didn't stop developing in the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a great amount of cultural diversity in America, and I try and draw on 
everything I've been exposed to. The first two albums I bought when I was 13 or 
14 were 'Big Swing Face' by Buddy Rich and the debut album by the Doors." 
</P>
<P>
Mullins said he has been most influenced by artists who are "great technicians 
but play with a lot of heart," naming Keith Jarrett, Chick Corea, McCoy Tyner 
and Bruce Hornsby. 
</P>
<P>
His newest album "Tokyo Nights" marks a return to electric jazz following last 
year's "Jazz Jazz," an all-acoustic album. At Elario's, his band will include 
former Crusaders saxman Wilton Felder plus bassist Dave Carpenter and drummer 
Joel Taylor. Mullins will play both acoustic piano and electric keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
Shows begin at 8:30 and 10 Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday nights and at 9, 
10:30 and midnight Friday and Saturday nights. 
</P>
<P>
Now settled in Portland, Ore., after a September move from San Diego, pianist 
Randy Porter teams up with fellow Portlander bassist Leroy Vinnegar and San 
Diego flutist Holly Hofmann this Friday and Saturday night at 8:30 at the 
Horton Grand Hotel downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Porter reports a lively jazz scene in Portland. He has already picked up 
regular work including Tuesday night date at a club called The Hobbit. 
</P>
<P>
Vinnegar, 62, is a polished player and composer. He has recorded several albums 
of his own and played on many others, including the incredibly popular late 
1960s album "Swiss Movement" with Les McCann and Eddie Harris. Vinnegar has 
never worked with Porter and Hofmann, so the music will consist primarily of 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: A recent article by this writer reported that Steve Allen wrote the song 
"South Rampart Street Parade." While Allen is multitalented, his publicity 
material exaggerated his credits a bit, as was pointed out by local musician 
and jazz critic Murray Davison. The traditional jazz number credited to Allen 
was actually penned by bassist Bob Haggart, a former La Costan. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Fluegelhorn player Burnett Anderson, the ex-Texan now in Daniel Jackson's Real 
Jazz Band at Croce's, which is featured at Croce's Monday nights, also plays 
with a trio on Friday and Saturday nights at La Maze in National City (1441 
Highland Ave.). . . . 
</P>
<P>

CHILEAN FOLK WORKS: AUTHENTIC TO SYNTHETIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ballet Folklorico Nacional de Chile brought an impressive cultural legacy and a 
confusing point of view to Pasadena Civic Auditorium on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by Ambassador Foundation, this company of 32 dancers and musicians 
appeared in suites evoking the regional diversity of that South American 
nation. Unfortunately, the incomplete and often inaccurate program notes 
sometimes left only local Chilean-Americans sure of exactly who and what they'd 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, even non-specialists could tell that the performance incorporated 
everything from authentic traditional dances to the most synthetic contemporary 
choreography. 
</P>
<P>
The suite from Rapa-Nui (Easter Island) proved the most problematic, opening 
with a display of the kind of nude-look leotards and weightless, linear jumps 
(with pointed toes) that belong to the world of pseudo-primitive ballet. Soon, 
however, this dubious pretense gave way to genuine Polynesian costumes 
(including Tahitian-style sarongs) and unison group dances of exciting rhythmic 
drive, though the execution here remained mostly dutiful. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the mainland repertory also raised questions about the company's 
artistic stance. How much of the strangely uneven "La Chamantera" dance drama, 
for instance, represented a modern choreographer's fanciful depiction of folk 
culture rather than actual folk dance? 
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by vibrant drums and brass, the carnival finale reached a high 
plateau of spectacle with its glittering short skirts for the women, grotesque 
masks and swirling capes for the men -- all presumably from the Chiloe 
Archipelago at the southern end of Chile. However the finest dancing came 
early, in the elegant, extended "Huasos" suite, with extremely rapid and 
intricate unison footwork performed by 16 dancers wearing enormous spurs on 
their boots. 
</P>
<P>
It would be unfair, however, to remember Ballet Folklorico Nacional de Chile 
primarily as a dance ensemble. After all, the curtain for many of the suites 
rose on instrumentalists and vocalists: four female singers and three or four 
male singer/guitarists, sometimes supplemented by a drummer or accordion 
player. 
</P>
<P>
These artists and their colleagues on brass provided the highlights of the 
program, from the sophisticated layering of men's and women's vocal lines in 
the opening song to the contributions by soloists. 
</P>
<P>
Ximena Rodriguez brought great sweetness of tone to an early song-set. Later 
Jose Luis Hernandez developed an electric rapport with his audience in 
alternately fervent, comic and tongue-twisting songs that included -- what 
else? -- "Viva Chile."

FOUR WORKS BY CONSTANTINIDES MAKE UP NORTHRIDGE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four compositions from three decades by Dinos Constantinides made up a mildly 
interesting concert by the Cal State Northridge New Music Ensemble conducted by 
Daniel Kessner Sunday night. The Louisiana-based composer attended the event in 
Northridge's Recital Hall, offering introductory comments before most of the 
pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Constantinides, a 61-year-old native of Greece, writes in a simple, tonal 
language that explores folk music and lyricism without pretense or showy 
virtuosity. His work emphasizes carefully lucid melodic lines, though sometimes 
in ways unadventurous and woodenly pedagogic. 
</P>
<P>
In "Listenings and Silences for Voice Alone" (1988), he sets three texts by 
Pinkie Gordon Lane -- a black poet from Baton Rouge, where Constantinides has 
taught composition for the past 24 years. Predictable word-painting, with of 
humming, spoken words and melismatic singing accompany descriptions of 
whispering, descending light and the passage of time. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, a tonal, tuneful quality handsomely suggests a traditional 
spiritual style without patronizing or satirizing it. Soprano Theresa Villa 
gave a poised, dramatic performance that captivated the listener. 
</P>
<P>
The composer's "Antitheses" (1975) for chamber orchestra utilizes a 
sentimental, less-convincing neo-Romanticism seasoned with frequent percussive 
bursts. 
</P>
<P>
The ensemble of 14 players gave a timid reading of the work, with specific 
players consistently out of sync. 
</P>
<P>
Constantinides opened the program himself ruggedly performing his serial Sonata 
No. 1 (1968) for violin solo. A three-movement, jazzy study, "Homage: A Folk 
Concerto for Flute"(1988) for flute and piano, closed the program pleasantly.

CAUTIONARY TALE IN COMIC BOOK FORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE MCKENNA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For more than three decades, Roy Lichtenstein has been playing Henry Higgins to 
the lowly comic book. Employing enlarged Benday dot patterning and Mondrian 
colors to execute ironic turns on everything from action painting to the 
current censorship controversy, he combines the brute energy of pop culture 
with a droll, intellectual bemusment evocative of vintage Tom Wolfe. It's a 
recipe that's worn remarkably well over the years, and since the early '60s 
when the Pop-Art boom catapulted him to the front ranks of the avant-garde, 
he's never looked out of date. 
</P>
<P>
Currently one of the stars of the Museum of Modern Art's hotly debated 
exhibition examining the ways high and low culture feed off each other, 
Lichtenstein is looking particularly au courant these days, and his series of 
snappy new paintings at BlumHelman in Santa Monica is one of the most engaging 
gallery shows to turn up hereabouts in a while. The second body of work in a 
series titled "Reflections on Cartoons," the show features five paintings that 
read as a cautionary essay on the frightening things happening in America. We 
see guns and the talons of an eagle, a nude portrait of "Jessica Helms" (the 
X-rated parts of her anatomy discreetly covered, of course), and a clumsy, 
overfed dinosaur thudding to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Sharing the gallery is work by another elder statesmen of Modernism, Ellsworth 
Kelly. A hard-edge color painter who was among the first to use shaped 
canvases, Kelly looks like quite the classicist these days. Two works on view 
involving large geometric shapes rendered in flat, intensely saturated colors 
reiterate values central to much art of the '60s and '70s -- specifically, the 
significance of form, process and surface. Made of composite material with 
enamel paint, they seem faintly nostalgic. 
</P>
<P>
BlumHelman, 916 Colorado Ave., Santa Monica, to Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Roman Grandeur: The ideological atheism of much Post-Modern art hasn't left 
anybody feeling particularly good (other than the handful of people who've 
gotten rich from it, of course), and art in search of mystical revelation 
continues to thrive. It seems to flourish with particular vigor in Italy, a 
country rooted in a profound reverence for history and an unabashedly 
sentimental view of the grandeur of the human soul. That more or less sums up 
the work of Domenico Bianchi on view at the L.A. Louver Gallery in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
Bianchi lives in Rome and his work is perfumed with the spirit of that city -- 
you sense it in his masterful grasp of the fresco form, as well as in the rich 
blend of histories that come to bear on his work. He tips his hat to the Arte 
Povera movement, for instance, in his use of lowly materials, and the influence 
of American Abstract Expressionist exile Cy Twombly (who's lived in Rome for 
more than three decades) can also be detected in Bianchi's work. At Louver, 
Bianchi shows 12 paintings made of wax and pigment on fiberglass panels. 
Layering rather than painting his surfaces, Bianchi "engraves" the wax with a 
vocabulary of enigmatic symbols -- pulsating orbs of light, loopy biomorphic 
forms, floral motifs. The panels are then hung together so as to form a massive 
mural that hums with the portentous power of an oracle. 
</P>
<P>
Also on view is a series of pastel drawings by David Nash, a British sculptor 
whose central theme is the relationship between nature and culture. Man, of 
course, feels justified to leave his thumbprint on everything that drifts his 
way, but Nash expresses this drive with considerable restraint. Effecting 
subtle transformations of what already exists in nature, Nash, like Brancusi, 
attempts to "free" the sculptural forms intrinsic to the organic world. 
</P>
<P>
Fascinated with the ways wood cracks, decays, burns and bends, Nash works 
primarily with trees (this is a bit odd considering that he works in a 
converted church in an almost treeless slate quarrying area of Northern Wales). 
He restricts himself to dying or dead trees, and the vocabulary of shapes he 
wrenches from them include pine cones, spoons, boats and wishbones. Low-tech 
and austere, Nash's work is essentially a primitive form of Minimalism. 
</P>
<P>
This series of pastel studies for monumental works (many in the process of 
being completed) is surprisingly twee considering the massive scale Nash 
favors. Several of the drawings have the whimsical charm of a New Yorker 
magazine cover, and visual puns abound. We see, for instance, a row of trees 
coaxed with the aid of strategic grafting into growing in the form of a ladder. 
Exactly what Nash intends to communicate with this sort of topiary trick is 
anybody's guess. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Louver, 55 N. Venice Blvd., and 77 Market St., Venice, to Nov. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Cryptic Messages: In a show of new work by John Mandel at the Krygier/Landau 
Gallery in Santa Monica, the L.A. artist creates a shrine to a lost language 
called Xiriguana. Without a bit of explanation from gallery personnel, however, 
one would be hard pressed to deduce this from these cryptic paintings. An odd 
series of clues (an anvil, a dog, books, a dead fish) rendered in a neat, 
classical hand, the paintings are freighted with a sense of loss and 
melancholy, but are mostly highly ambiguous. Perhaps it's fitting that 
paintings about a lost language should leave one hungering for an explanatory 
text, but one comes away frustrated and curious to know the significance of the 
symbols that turn up in this homage to a body of knowledge devoured by time. 
</P>
<P>
Also on view is "Take Over," an elaborate conceptual goof on the 
commodification of art and the changing relationship between artists and 
dealers. Curated by Manuela Gandini and Loredana Parmesani, this installation 
originated in Milan, travels to New York from L.A., and evolves with each new 
location. The ghost of Jeff Koons hangs heavy over the show, which investigates 
the career of an archetypal corporation called Oklahoma Ltd. (the installation 
is basically comprised of various bits of bogus documentation). It seems like 
much ado about very little. That the art world is having some problems with 
money is hardly late-breaking news.

ENDOWMENT: MERLE BENSINGER AND HIS DESIRE TO SHARE SURVIVED AN ORPHANAGE 
UPBRINGING, CEREBRAL PALSY, DISCRIMINATION AND THE STRUGGLE FOR AN EDUCATION.

<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Merle Bensinger is sitting in a motorized armchair in his Sacramento home, 
talking about an extraordinary subject -- his life. 
</P>
<P>
There is his childhood spent in a Dickensian orphanage in the 20th-Century 
Midwest; Tom Sawyer-esque flights; episodes of riding freight trains and 
punching out bullies; marriage, divorce and a child; a 42-year career as a 
psychologist; and, this fall, a rare, million-dollar endowment of a 
professorship at the USC's Ethel Percy Andrus Gerontology Center. 
</P>
<P>
Threading through the erratic drama is the fact that since birth Bensinger has 
had cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
In noted autobiographical works, writers with cerebral palsy have driven home 
the point that they are as cantankerous, randy, talented and complex as the 
able-bodied. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Day-Lewis swilled and slugged through last year's Academy-Award-winning 
portrayal of Irish writer Christy Brown in the film, "My Left Foot," drawn 
largely from Brown's book "Down All the Days." In Britain's award-winning novel 
"Under the Eye of the Clock," the severely handicapped writer, Christopher 
Nolan, calls his principal character "crippled" not disabled, and candidly 
describes his physical limitations. 
</P>
<P>
So, too, Bensinger describes the vicissitudes of his 71 years without burdening 
his story with morals or messages. His narration is blunt and brisk, recounted 
in a voice so purposeful his words could be blown out from a bellows. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, as he stops to draw a drink through a straw, an errant spasm 
betrays his faulty muscle coordination. He holds out his right hand, showing 
how his fingers uncontrollably clench, and rests his feet, bare from his 
morning's whirlpool session, on the floor. Walking has always been a 
problematic means of locomotion. A nearby snapshot shows Bensinger standing 
outdoors, his arms outspread for balance like the wings of an airplane in a 
sharply banking turn. 
</P>
<P>
Keen-eyed and grizzled, he is an outdoors-lover who rides his wheelchair into 
the back yard of his suburban ranch-style house, supervising the weeding of his 
vegetable garden and pruning his roses. 
</P>
<P>
"He drives us hard, the same way he drives himself," says June Knedel, who has 
served as his secretary and factotum for 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, however, Bensinger had no motivating force, not even a family 
name he could count on. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother had me in a foundling home," he explains. "She went across the 
river. My father and she weren't married. They had three children. She had to 
adopt us out." 
</P>
<P>
Hiding the shame of her pregnancy, his mother left her Kentucky home to live in 
Evansville, Ind., where she worked in a cigar-wrapping factory until her son 
was born in April 1919. 
</P>
<P>
When he was 6 months old, Bensinger was adopted "the first time," he says. But 
his adoptive mother, Sara Biery, developed tuberculosis, and her husband, a 
mechanic for the Franklin motor car, deserted her. Bensinger was again put up 
for adoption, this time in the Knox County Orphanage in Vincennes, Ind. After 
six months he was claimed, this second time by Commodore and Leona Bensinger. 
Bensinger worked in a restaurant by day and by night labored in the coal mines 
outside Vincennes. But in less than a year, this second home fell apart when 
Leona Bensinger ran off with a traveling salesman. 
</P>
<P>
His adoptive father was taking care of both Bensinger and a little girl the 
family had also taken in. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember he would leave me in bed and hold me until I fell asleep because I 
was afraid of being alone," Bensinger recalls of these moments when he was less 
than 2 years old. Later his adoptive father was obliged to board the children 
out; but "he said people would mistreat us, so he put us back in the 
orphanage." 
</P>
<P>
At the time Bensinger was not yet 3 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"He could only visit one day a month, the last Thursday. He'd bring me candy 
and cowboy suits. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to cry a lot for my father because he was the only person alive I 
knew." 
</P>
<P>
His adoptive father did not understand why spasms coursed through his son's 
muscles or why he could not walk. "He didn't know I had cerebral palsy and 
neither did Aunt Sara, my first adopted mother. They didn't know what cerebral 
palsy was back in those days. They thought I had polio." 
</P>
<P>
As a youngster, Bensinger was pulled to school in a wagon by his classmates. 
When he was 6, he underwent experimental surgery to help him walk. Nerves 
connected to his inner thigh muscles were severed, and for almost a year he lay 
with his legs strapped up on each side of his bed. "I could see these little 
kids up on a hill playing with their goats and their dogs and I thought, 'Oh, 
when I get back to the orphanage and put my bare feet in the sand and dirt, 
I'll feel so good.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bensinger returned to the orphanage with a cowboy gait, swinging out his hips 
as he moved. Still, by the seventh grade he was covering the mile to school by 
himself. "I'd run and fall and run and fall," he says. One day he was arrested 
by a police officer who mistakenly believed he was drunk. The orphanage was not 
a place that coddled cripples, and Bensinger was a lightning rod for bullies on 
the playground. Holding onto the iron fence that surrounded the schoolyard, he 
would slug them back. "I'd get bloody noses and black eyes. Then the other kids 
would join in. But I always had to be punished first." 
</P>
<P>
When he was about 13 years old, Bensinger ran away with two other boys. "We 
wanted to go down the Wabash River into the Ohio River and the Mississippi and 
down to New Orleans like Huckleberry Finn," Bensinger says. 
</P>
<P>
Living on raw sweet corn from the fields, wild blackberries and the fish they 
caught, they slept under the stars as they made their way by hitchhiking and 
riding the freights, the companions Bensinger aboard the moving cars. After 
swiping a rowboat, they were heading down the Ohio River when they got caught. 
</P>
<P>
They had asked for a handout of food from a night watchman at a flour mill in 
southern Indiana. He gave them some stale bread and syrup and tried to sexually 
molest them, Bensinger says. When the boys refused, he called the police. 
</P>
<P>
Bensinger's two companions were sent to reform school, while he was returned to 
the orphanage. 
</P>
<P>
In his sophomore year at Vincennes High School, Bensinger received the DAR Good 
Citizenship Award and honors as the outstanding history student. Teetering to 
the rostrum to accept the awards on Commencement Day, he slipped on the 
polished gymnasium floor and had to crawl the remainder of the way. 
</P>
<P>
"I was embarrassed. They thought I was brave," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Soon afterwards, the orphan again fled his hated confines, this time selling 
newspapers and magazines on the streets of Vincennes and living in back alleys. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lost in my soul. I had too many sets of parents. I had too many things 
happening to me," Bensinger says, his voice briefly cracking. 
</P>
<P>
This time the orphanage did not try to get the 16-year-old rebel back. After a 
year on the streets, Bensinger began a long uphill ascent, leaning on the 
shoulders of a series of social workers and academicians determined to see him 
succeed. 
</P>
<P>
After an IQ test confirmed his intelligence, he was persuaded to enter the 
National Youth Authority training center connected with the University of 
Indiana, where he completed his remaining two years of high school in a single 
year and entered the university. 
</P>
<P>
Intermittently taking time out from college, he worked on a cooperative farm 
run by Goodwill Industries in Massachusetts' Berkshire Hills, doing such odd 
jobs as spraying the apple orchards and mending fences. He helped juvenile 
delinquents in Indiana's inner city and did a stint as a radio disc jockey on 
the swing shift. 
</P>
<P>
Transferring to Whittier College, he majored in psychology and sociology, 
receiving his B.A. degree in 1946, and, with scholarships to USC, earned his 
masters in psychology in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
But in college, his hardships continued. "When I wrote I would break my pencil 
because I had to bear down so hard. I developed a real good memory." 
</P>
<P>
At USC, he met Olga Youngberg, a music student from Nebraska, whom he married 
six weeks afterward. "She helped me type. I was real lonely." Fourteen months 
later their son, Larry, was born, and the couple took turns looking after him. 
"I could do everything but change the diapers, because I couldn't use the 
safety pins." 
</P>
<P>
Following graduation, the pair took jobs on a Navajo reservation in Arizona, 
over 100 miles from the nearest town. After losing their second son in 
childbirth, they resigned their posts and Bensinger was hired as a staff 
psychologist at Norfolk State Mental Hospital in Nebraska. Two years later, he 
decided on an easier life in California's clement climate, and, carrying a 
letter of recommendation from the hospital's superintendent, he began job 
hunting in high spirits. 
</P>
<P>
Months later, he summed up 30 or so interviews to a journalist: "Some of them 
have been franker than others. There was one man who called me and seemed 
enthusiastic about my qualifications. I asked him if he knew of my handicap and 
he said he did and we set up an appointment. 
</P>
<P>
"When I walked into his office he stared at me and said, 'Why you're much worse 
than I thought,' and, of course, that was really the end of the interview." 
</P>
<P>
From eeking out a living doing part-time counseling therapy in positions found 
through newspaper ads, Bensinger began working as a school psychologist and 
marriage/family counselor, and gradually built up his own business in 
Sacramento. In 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower awarded him a national 
citation for outstanding service with physically and emotionally handicapped 
people, and for decades he helped patients who suffered from conditions ranging 
from schizophrenia to typical adolescent Angst. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Bensinger retired after breaking his foot and being confined to a 
wheelchair. He has been divorced for years and lives with a white Alaskan dog, 
Jeffrey, and a cat saved from the animal pound. His son, Larry, 42, is a 
housing contractor in Hartford, Conn., where he lives with his wife and two 
children. 
</P>
<P>
The road to the comfort of his suburban house has been hard. "As I look back 
over it, that's the way life is," he says. "Sometimes you have to suffer. The 
only thing is, you have to have enough experience and knowledge to learn from 
your suffering rather than becoming embittered by it. If you get embittered 
you're a lost soul." 
</P>
<P>
Now Bensinger wants to help older people like himself lead full, creative lives 
by establishing the Merle H. Bensinger Professorship in Gerontology. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he wanted to leave a memorial to the achievements of his life," says 
David Peterson, who directs USC's Leonard Davis School of Gerontology. 
</P>
<P>
"A gift of $1 million or anything in that neighborhood is spectacular," he 
adds. "It allows us to support the research and teaching activities of a 
faculty member in perpetuity. An endowed chair is the pinnacle a faculty member 
can achieve." 
</P>
<P>
Bensinger says he hasn't hit the jackpot to make his million dollars. Since he 
bought his house in 1954, it has increased in value from $16,500 to over 
$200,000. And, he says, "I just kept investing. I worked seven days a week, 
sometimes 14 hours a day. Instead of going out partying, I went out camping and 
hiking." 
</P>
<P>
Another motivation for his gift comes from Bensinger's philosophy of life. "If 
you're alive and growing inside, you attract people to you. You can't do that 
unless you have something to give."

IOTA, La. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mystery begins in this small farming community deep in the heart of Acadia. 
</P>
<P>
The sweet singsong of Cajun French is still spoken here, where the Woodmen of 
the World Lodge and Ritter's Bar and a few other storefronts anchor a town of 
1,200 surrounded by soybean and rice fields. It is where the makings of tragedy 
have been passed down, unbeknown to anyone who lived here, from generation to 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
The killer in this story is Tay-Sachs disease, a genetic affliction that 
attacks the nervous system of children just out of infancy and kills them by 
the age of 5. It is untreatable and marches unchecked through the body's 
functions, causing loss of motor skills, seizures and, eventually, blindness, 
deafness and paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
The mystery is why it appeared here, seemingly with such suddenness. Tay-Sachs 
is associated with East European Ashkenazi Jews and their descendants. It was 
rarely even heard of in this staunchly Catholic slice of the country settled by 
French Canadians. 
</P>
<P>
Then Renee Abshire turned the key and found the first clues of Iota's secret. 
She did so when she found out her baby was going to die. 
</P>
<P>
Abshire's daughter, Maigon, began behaving strangely at the age of 7 months. 
The baby was hesitant to do such things as hold her bottle. Her mannerisms had 
kind of a lazy way to them. It seemed to the parents that Maigon should have 
more strength to hold herself up. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a newborn, you had to give her so much support," said Abshire. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor didn't think at first there was much cause for alarm. But two months 
later, the Abshires enrolled Maigon in a special program for the mentally 
handicapped, convinced their daughter needed special attention. And then came 
the seizures. 
</P>
<P>
One Baton Rouge neurologist thought the baby had cerebral palsy. But then 
another specialist in New Orleans examined Maigon. The doctor peered into 
Maigon's eyes and saw the cherry-red spot that is the sure indicator of 
Tay-Sachs, the disease that strikes only one child in 400,000 in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"I was numb and in shock," Abshire said. "I had never even heard of Tay-Sachs, 
didn't even know it was a Jewish disease. I was born and raised in Texas. My 
husband was from Louisiana. I thought, 'How in the world can this happen to 
us?' I started searching for someone else who was dealing with what I was 
dealing with." 
</P>
<P>
She began calling local doctors. Over time, and after many phone calls, Abshire 
found three other families in which there was a Tay-Sachs baby. No outsiders, 
these. In three of the four cases, at least one parent had attended Iota High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
For such a small town, it was an appallingly high number. How could this have 
happened? 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Abshire had more pressing worries. Maigon died in February, 1989, at age 
3. The costs of caring for the child had left the family bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the mystery of Iota was unsolved. It took a doctor from New Orleans to 
open the door to the mystery just a little wider. His name was Dr. Emmanuel 
Shapira, a geneticist from the Tulane Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
In his role as a genetic counselor, Shapira already had met both the Abshires 
and another family, the McClellands, from nearby Crowley. He had told the two 
families what to expect as Tay-Sachs took hold. And he had explained how the 
disease spread, of how both the man and woman had to be carriers, but that even 
then the chance of having a Tay-Sachs baby was only one in four. 
</P>
<P>
Shapira was not surprised at Abshire's findings in Iota. Louisiana, 
particularly in the southern part of the state, was known as a place where 
isolation and inbreeding over the centuries had produced clusters of rare 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
He decided to take some blood samples in Iota to see how they stacked up 
against the norm. Last July, Shapira brought 230 test kits to the Knights of 
Columbus Hall. He ran out because so many people wanted to know if they were 
carriers of the disease. The results, completed last month, were astonishing: 
Of the 230 people tested in Iota, 17 were carriers. It meant that the carrier 
rate in Iota was roughly twice that of Jews and 20 times the population as a 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
The other part of the test was answering a questionnaire in which the 
townspeople were asked if they had any of the surnames of the three families 
with Tay-Sachs babies. Of the 230 people, 83 had at least one of the surnames 
and 14% were carriers. But even of those 147 people who did not have the 
surnames, five still tested as carriers. 
</P>
<P>
The number of carriers in Iota is so great that Shapira believes parents should 
be tested before the decision is made to have children. And he said he will 
begin looking at surrounding communities to see if there are other clusters of 
people carrying the Tay-Sachs gene. 
</P>
<P>
"In this area, people have continued to intermarry since the 1700s," said 
Shapira, who speculated that other children from past generations may have died 
of Tay-Sachs but had their deaths attributed to something else. 
</P>
<P>
The geneticist has a couple of theories about how Tay-Sachs disease may have 
entered the bloodline of this region, and particularly this town, several 
hundred years ago. Theory No. 1 is that German settlers, some of them Jewish, 
were here in the early 1700s. In a book written in 1909 about the settlement of 
the region, Shapira found a passage that said, "In the beginning of 1720, more 
than 4,000 persons, French, as well as Germans and Jews" sailed to Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
Theory No. 2 is that the Spanish, who were here before the French, may have 
brought the disease with them. He said many Spaniards who were Jews had come 
here during the Inquisition, changing their names to disguise their ancestry 
and converting to Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
Shapira said that in the early years of settling Louisiana, the area around 
Iota had all manner of nationalities. Most were people escaping their previous 
lives. "There was an unbelievable melting pot in that area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The price of that melting pot, followed by the genetic isolation, is being paid 
by Kurt and Gail McClelland and their 2 1/2-year-old son, Jordie. 
</P>
<P>
Jordie is in the advanced stages of Tay-Sachs disease. The other day, Gail held 
her son in the living room of their small, metal-roofed home in Crowley. He was 
wearing a striped shirt, red shorts and tennis shoes. He is a hefty boy for his 
age, and there is in his face the look of total innocence. 
</P>
<P>
Jordie is blind and is unable now to recognize the voices of his parents. He 
sometimes smiles, but at the wrong time, and he stopped laughing last April. He 
responds to pain and doesn't like his face washed or teeth brushed. In three 
recent weeks, Jordie suffered 101 seizures before being put on new medication 
that significantly reduced that number. He requires round-the-clock nursing 
care. 
</P>
<P>
When Gail held Jordie, she had to support the back of his head because, like an 
infant, there is no strength to hold it up. A sign on the front door asked that 
anyone coming to visit with even a sore throat come another time because Jordie 
has just gotten through another round of pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
Then Gail began the familiar story of what had happened to Jordie, of the 
listlessness and inability to sit up unless propped up by pillows. Then came 
the Christmas of 1988 when Gail's mother-in-law looked closely at the child. 
No, she said, something is wrong with this boy. 
</P>
<P>
The McClellands took Jordie to Barbara Golden, a Baton Rouge neurologist. Like 
the doctor who had diagnosed Maigon Abshire's condition, Golden saw the 
cherry-red spot in Jordie's eyes. The Tay-Sachs test came back positive. When 
the McClellands' two other sons were tested, it was discovered they were 
carriers and could pass the disease on to the next generation. 
</P>
<P>
For the McClellands, the last two years have been like living on a roller 
coaster. Gail, like Renee Abshire, called Tay-Sachs "the big lie," because her 
child seemed so normal before the disease began attacking the nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
"The parents, they go through such a bad time," said Ethel Seagraves, one of 
the three nurses who look after Jordie. "There is a tremendous amount of stress 
on a family. They just see their child deteriorate from one month to the next." 
</P>
<P>
Just then, Kurt walked through the door. He scooped up Jordie and held him on 
the couch. 
</P>
<P>
"This has drawn us together as a family," said Kurt. "If you ever want to hold 
an angel, just hold him. He don't laugh and carry on like he used to, but he's 
got a smile worth a million dollars if he'll ever give it up."

Since skateboarding took off in the late '70s, parents and pediatricians have 
tended to worry most about little skaters hitting the sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a new study suggests that older adolescents -- aged 15 to 18 -- are the 
ones to watch. They are most likely to suffer skateboard injuries, followed by 
kids aged 6 to 9 and then kids aged 10 to 14, according to Dr. Robert A. 
Pendergrast, assistant pediatrics professor at the Medical College of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
Pendergrast researched the mishaps of 94 Baltimore skateboarders, 6 to 18 years 
old, and published his findings recently in the Journal of Adolescent Health 
Care. 
</P>
<P>
"These 15- to 18-year-olds are stronger and ride with more velocity and force," 
Pendergrast said. Older skateboarders take their skill for granted, added Dr. 
Alexander R. Lampone, medical director of the emergency department at St. 
John's Hospital and Health Center, Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Short of banning the boards -- a move Pendergrast opposes -- parents and 
pediatricians are asking how skateboarding can be made safer. "Helmet use is 
most important," Pendergrast said. "Street skateboarders don't think about 
wearing helmets; it's just not cool." But helmets are worn at skateboarding 
competitions, and Pendergrast hopes the practice will soon catch on with other 
skateboarders as well. 
</P>
<P>
A bicycle helmet works almost as well as a helmet designed specifically for 
skateboarding, say some doctors. (Skateboarding helmets are harder to find than 
bicycle helmets. One manufacturer that does make a special skateboarding helmet 
is Pro-Tec, (800) 338-6068. It has more padding and offers more head coverage 
than most bike helmets, said a spokeswoman.) 
</P>
<P>
Skateboarding in a "controlled environment" such as a skateboarding park is 
safer than street boarding, Pendergrast added. Protective padding at knees and 
elbows is also advised. 
</P>
<P>
Children younger than the age of 5 should never ride skateboards, warns the 
American Academy of Pediatrics. In a policy statement published last year in 
the journal Pediatrics, the academy said youngsters that age "are not 
developmentally prepared to protect themselves from injury." Their high center 
of gravity impedes their ability to break a fall.

PARIS IN THE RED: You're a $150,000-a-year executive in a $500,000 Newport 
Beach home and you're due for a transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Which do you pick: Toyko, Paris or Dallas? . . . Careful, for according to 
Irvine-based Century 21 Real Estate Corp., your standard of living is in for a 
jolt. . . . Pick Dallas and you can get a bigger, more luxurious house that's 
$150,000 cheaper. But pick Tokyo or Paris and you'll probably wind up spending 
$500,000 to buy an apartment at least 50% smaller than your old house. . . . 
"Some are shocked," says a Century 21 spokesman. "That's why Dallas is so 
red-hot right now." George Frank and Ann Conway

Caltrans' division of aeronautics has established guidelines to control the 
amount of noise generated over residential areas by aircraft using the state's 
airports. Under those guidelines, any area exposed to an average Community 
Noise Equivalent Level of more than 65 in a year is considered to be 
noise-impacted. 
</P>
<P>
To comply with those regulations, John Wayne Airport has set up nine stations 
at locations in Newport Beach, Santa Ana, Tustin and Irvine to monitor noise 
levels. Some stations are on private property and others on public land, at the 
following locations: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MONITOR STATIONS 
</P>
<P>
M-1: 2139 Anniversary Lane, Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
M-2: 1907 Tradewinds Lane, Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
M-3: 2601 Vista del Oro, Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
M-5: 17952 Beneta Way, Tustin 
</P>
<P>
M-8: 1131 Back Bay Drive, Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
M-9: 1300 S. Grand Ave., Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
M-10: Golf Course, 3100 Irvine Ave., Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
M-11: 20152 S.W. Birch St., Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
M-14: 17372 Eastman St., Irvine 
</P>
<P>
The stations monitor the noise levels on a daily basis. The average daily 
levels, which are also averaged for each month, are "the result of a computer 
analysis based on county-provided data including flight tracks, actual traffic 
counts, average SENELs (Single Event Noise Exposure Levels) by aircraft model 
and recorded CNEL values for each monitor station," according to the quarterly 
report from the airport's noise abatement office.

FORMER OFFICIAL'S PENSION TAKES A CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County retirement officials Monday reduced the pension check of a former San 
Juan Capistrano city attorney who had been incorrectly classified for more than 
three years as a full-time employee while he was only working part time. 
</P>
<P>
James S. Okazaki apparently was listed as a regular full-time employee while he 
worked for the city's Capistrano Valley Water District between 1984 and 1988, 
just after he retired as city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Okazaki was the third former San Juan Capistrano city official to have his 
retirement decreased by the Orange County Retirement Board. Former City Manager 
James S. Mocalis and his assistant, E. Phillip Hale, had their retirements cut 
in half two weeks ago. They allegedly had inflated their last year of pay with 
accumulated sick leave and vacation days, thereby doubling their retirement 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Mocalis and Okazaki -- once officials with the Laguna Niguel Community Services 
District -- are also subjects of an Orange County Grand Jury investigation of a 
1988 land transaction in which the public's right to 96 acres of open space was 
deeded to a developer. Both have voluntarily testified before the jury 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
Okazaki acknowledged in an earlier interview that he should not have accrued 
retirement benefits after 1984 when he left San Juan Capistrano to join the 
water district, a quasi city department overseen by the City Council. But he 
contended that it was a "bookkeeping thing," explaining that he apparently had 
been listed in county records as a full-time employee after he switched to part 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Okazaki said he received about $20,000 a year in retirement. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-member Retirement Board voted unanimously to recalculate the number of 
years that Okazaki has in the retirement system and reduce his benefits 
accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
His attorney, J. Gary Germann of Irvine, said Okazaki paid into the retirement 
system between 1984 and 1988 when he worked at the water district. He said 
Okazaki -- who did not appear at the board's meeting Monday -- worked between 
1977 and 1984 as a full-time city attorney and another seven years with the 
city as a contract employee, which did not count toward his retirement. Okazaki 
worked in the county counsel's office for three years, which accrued toward his 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a percentage reduction (in his retirement benefits) that they 
will figure out," Germann said after the meeting. "Somehow it got reported as 
full time and should have been part time. It was a mistake by someone." 
</P>
<P>
Neither county retirement officials nor Germann could say how much Okazaki's 
retirement would be reduced. Germann said the contributions made by the water 
district and Okazaki would have to be calculated to find the difference between 
what he received in retirement payments since he began drawing county pension 
checks in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Germann said Okazaki would repay what he was not entitled to. GEORGE FRANK

COUNCIL TO CONSIDER RENT-CONTROL ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA MASCARO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council tonight will consider a rent-control measure that would reduce 
rents at Anaheim mobile home parks to 1988 levels and limit future increases. 
</P>
<P>
Rent control advocates have collected more than 22,000 signatures in support of 
placing the measure before voters. 
</P>
<P>
A similar 1987 measure never made it to the ballot because the city attorney 
decided the wording of the petitions was improper. 
</P>
<P>
The new measure would limit annual increases in mobile home rents to 75% of the 
increase in the consumer price index, an annual assessment by the federal 
government of increases in the cost of living. Under the measure, a monthly 
rent of $350 could increase no more than $10.50 in a year in which the cost of 
living went up 4%. 
</P>
<P>
The council has three options: immediately approve the measure, place it before 
voters in a special election, or study the issue further. According to the city 
clerk, a special election would cost the city between $100,000 and $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the plan say rents are being increased unfairly, gouging longtime 
residents, especially senior citizens on fixed incomes. They say the rent 
increases prevent mobile home owners from selling their homes because potential 
buyers will not pay such high rents. 
</P>
<P>
Park owners, however, say increases are warranted because park property is 
increasing in value and the cost of living continues to rise.LISA MASCARO

POLICE STILL LOOKING FOR RAPE SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The man who raped a 13-year-old girl Saturday night in the Broadmoor Homes 
development may be the same one who kidnaped and sexually molested a 
29-year-old mentally retarded woman in early October, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pretty sure it's one and the same man, considering the method of tying 
up the girl and all that," Sgt. Richard Downing said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators spent Monday canvassing the Avenida Presidio neighborhood above 
San Clemente High School in search of clues from the Saturday night attack. No 
one has been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, the victim was home alone when the doorbell rang. As she 
approached the unlocked door, the suspect barged inside and forced her into 
another room where she was tied up, blindfolded, gagged and raped. 
</P>
<P>
The attack was interrupted when the victim's mother returned home about 8:30 
p.m., but the suspect managed to escape without being seen. 
</P>
<P>
"We really have nothing new on the case yet," Police Chief Albert C. Ehlow 
said. "We had a female officer question the victim late this afternoon after 
giving her some time to come down emotionally from the incident." 
</P>
<P>
Police said that in the October incident the suspect apparently picked up the 
victim near Avenida Pico. She was blindfolded and tied up before she was 
assaulted in an apartment. She was released later in the Dana Point area. 
</P>
<P>
The only description police have to work with is that the suspect is an 
unshaven Caucasian male, about 20 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Although police declined to say whether the victim of Saturday's attack was a 
student at Shorecliffs Junior High School, Principal Chris Cairns said he will 
ask San Clemente police to give students some crime prevention advice. The 
victim lived in the Shorecliffs attendance area. 
</P>
<P>
"I think an officer could probably educate students regarding locking doors 
when they're home alone, and home safety, things like that," Cairns said. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Dunford, a police community service officer, said the most important 
thing for children to do while home alone is to make sure doors and windows are 
locked. 
</P>
<P>
"Children should also find out who is at the door before letting anyone in," 
Dunford said. "It's always good to have a plan of defense ahead of time so if 
an attack did occur it might be easier to respond." LEN HALL

$334,000 STATE GRANT FOR LEISURE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city has received a $334,000 grant from the state to help build a 
$2.44-million recreation facility that would double the size of the existing 
Cultural Arts and Recreation Center, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Recreation Director Mary Gonye said the expansion would enable the city to 
provide as many as six programs, such as karate, ballroom dancing and ballet 
classes, all at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
The present building has only one main room, limiting the number of groups that 
can use it at a given time. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed 14,450-square-foot facility, to be completed by August, 1992, will 
replace the existing center at the corner of Cedar Street and Katella Avenue, 
City Manager Terry Matz said. 
</P>
<P>
The facility is now in the design stage and will be constructed at the same 
time as the the new civic center at 7800 Katella. Matz said no decision has yet 
been made on whether the two projects will be combined into a single building. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) helped the city obtain the grant, 
which is funded by a state surtax on cigarettes and tobacco and earmarked for 
parks and recreation projects. 
</P>
<P>
"I sense that there's excitement. This has been a demonstrated community need 
for the last several years," Matz said.

SUIT FILED AGAINST FORMER MAYOR KELLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Council candidate and former Mayor Jack Kelly has failed to pay $23,615 
owed to the previous owners of his weekly newspaper, according to a lawsuit 
filed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In the suit, filed in West Orange Municipal Court, Jeff Brown and Allison Okada 
claim that Kelly agreed to purchase their majority interest in the Huntington 
Beach News for $20,000 last year, has been publisher since then, but has never 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
The suit says Kelly was under contract to pay them the full amount by last 
August, a year after he took over the 86-year-old publication. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, who for six weeks this year discontinued publishing the paper because of 
financial difficulties, acknowledged that he has not paid anything for the 
transfer of ownership. 
</P>
<P>
But Kelly said that Brown and Okada's 65% stock shares in the newspaper were 
never officially transferred to him, because state permits required to complete 
the transaction were never filed. 
</P>
<P>
Brown agreed that those documents were never completed, but the suit charges 
that Kelly agreed in a contract with the plaintiffs to submit the necessary 
permits to finalize the transaction. Kelly dismissed that allegation as 
"ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
"It was an illegal transaction. . . . I don't own any part" of the Huntington 
Beach News, Kelly said, although one of his campaign brochures advertises that 
he recently acquired the publication. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that the suit was filed four days before the two-time former 
councilman will again seek election, Kelly said he believes the action against 
him may have been prompted by one or several of his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he wanted to file the case before Tuesday's election to solve the 
matter before Kelly takes office, assuming he wins his bid for one of four 
contested council seats. 
</P>
<P>
"Before he goes off and does something else, we'd like to see him take care of 
this," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also seeks $3,614 from Kelly for a debt the newspaper has incurred 
since he took over its operations. Brown said that a bank has been seeking 
repayment from him and Okada because they remain the legal owners of the 
publication. JOHN PENNER

CULTURE MIX BLENDS AT UCI FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deepa Savani didn't know much about her Indian heritage and felt adrift. 
</P>
<P>
But since joining UC Irvine's Indian Subcontinental Club last year, Savani says 
she has found the missing link to her past. 
</P>
<P>
"It's given me a connection to a culture that I knew was a part of me but I 
didn't know a lot about," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Savani is one of many students on the ethnically diverse campus who are 
learning more about their heritage. This week, the university is holding 
"Rainbow Festival 1990," a weeklong event designed to recognize the various 
cultures represented on campus and encourage interaction among their members. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to introduce the campus to itself," said Corina Espinoza, director of 
the university's cross-cultural center, which organized the event. "We want to 
let everyone know who's on campus and highlight the ethnic diversity." 
</P>
<P>
The festival, in its sixth year, features the food, music and dance of the 
university's various ethnic groups. The festival culminates Thursday with a 
series of seminars about various issues facing multicultural campuses. 
</P>
<P>
This year, UC Irvine enrolled a record 16,761 students, with the number of 
white, Asian and black freshmen on the rise. While whites make up the biggest 
ethnic group with 7,153 students, there are also 4,858 Asians, 1,382 Latinos, 
439 Filipinos, 429 blacks, and 83 American Indians enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment statistics on international ethnic groups were not available. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a student body that is reflective of our surrounding community," 
Espinoza said. "There are different kinds of people out there, and they will 
always be out there. This is not something that will pass." 
</P>
<P>
Recent immigrants said they have found comfort in sharing their culture as they 
adjust to life in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We are here now, but we want people to know where we come from," said Guita 
Tabassi, a member of the Iranian Culture Club. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many Persian students here, so you don't feel like you're in a 
foreign country. There are friends all around, and this helps you not to forget 
about Iran, its music and traditions," said Tabassi, a 20-year-old biology 
major. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Tsay was one of five students who performed the Chinese Fan Dance in 
front of about 75 students on opening day. Although the 20-year-old biology 
major was dressed in a traditional Chinese costume and danced with precision 
and skill, she later confessed that she hadn't ever done the dance before last 
week's rehearsals. 
</P>
<P>
"I never really had the opportunity before," said Tsay, who came to the United 
States from Taiwan when she was in the fifth grade. 
</P>
<P>
"In high school, I just hung around all the other kids but now, it's sort of 
nice going back and learning about all the traditions," said Tsay, a member of 
the Chinese Assn. of UCI. 
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese Students Assn., with its 500 members, makes up one of the 
university's biggest clubs. Member Phong Ta said members feel at home on the 
college campus and are seeking to have an active voice. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the most important things to us is to not lose our identity and to 
share our views with the rest of the campus," Ta said. "We want to create 
harmony among the different groups and share a part of what we are." 
</P>
<P>
Espinoza said that the college is striving to recognize cultural diversity and 
that the sharing of cultural perspectives will help all students grow. 
</P>
<P>
"Cultural diversity should not be viewed as negative," Espinoza said. "Part of 
increasing interaction is making people aware of the differences and respecting 
them." GREG HERNANDEZ

2-YEAR-OLD DIES AFTER VAN-WINDOW ACCIDENT

A 2 -- year-old Santa Ana girl died Monday, a week after she tried to climb 
into the family minivan and caught her neck on a partially opened window, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Vanessa Del Campo, who had been declared brain dead, was taken off life support 
systems about 9:15 a.m. at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Police and family members Monday described her death as a tragic, freak 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
Ana Ramos, the girl's aunt, said the accident occurred Oct. 29 when Vanessa and 
her father were going to meet her mother for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
"Vanessa went outside and tried to get into the car before her father came out 
of the house," Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
Police Lt. Robert Helton said the girl "had taken a chair and placed it against 
the passenger side of her parent's 1988 Ford Aerostar. She climbed up on the 
chair, stood on it and pulled herself up on the window and lost her grip. She 
ended up strangling herself." 
</P>
<P>
Vanessa's father, Sal Del Campo, found his daughter unconscious and dangling by 
her neck from the minivan's window, Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
"She couldn't have been there for more than minute or so," Ramos said, adding 
that her father had tried to revive her. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics arrived at the family's house on the 800 block of South Broadway and 
took the toddler to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. For a week the family 
held vigil in the hospital, hoping Vanessa's condition would improve. 
</P>
<P>
"Her parents were in shock," the aunt said. "They just wanted to wake up from 
this nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
Last week doctors told the family that Vanessa "probably wasn't going to make 
it," Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the Del Campo's brown stucco home Monday, family members mourned the 
girl's death. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a freak accident," Ramos said. "Kids are kids. You can't isolate them 
all the time . . . at the blink of an eye so many things can happen."

FATAL CRASH ON QUIET IRVINE STREET PROBED 
</P>

<P>
Police on Monday continued to investigate the cause of an unusual accident on a 
quiet residential street that killed a man and injured his wife. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunday night accident took the life of Ioannis (John) Doukas, 33, 
co-founder of the Duke's Charbroiler hamburger chain, and injured his wife 
Debbie Doukas, 31. The mishap occurred in Woodbridge Village about 10 p.m. as 
they drove on Stone Creek North, around the corner from their home on Cross 
Creek. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Doukas was listed in stable condition Monday at UCI Medical Center from 
upper chest injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The crash destroyed a 2-by-3 foot cobblestone pillar that was part of the back 
fence of Leroy Morse's home and also destroyed his storage shed. Tire tracks 
began about 20 yards away, showing where the car jumped the curb and knocked 
over a small tree before hitting the fence post and collapsing the fence. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounded like an explosion," said Morse, 66, who was in his den at the time 
of the accident. The couple's 1985 Chrysler New Yorker came to rest about 10 
feet from the den. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I ran outside and I saw the car sitting here," Morse said, gesturing to 
the shattered cement-and-riverstone pillar that lay on his patio. "The whole 
front end was just gone." 
</P>
<P>
Police Sgt. Al Murray, who heads the department's traffic investigation unit, 
said the husband probably suffered fatal injuries because he was not wearing a 
seat belt. Debbie Doukas was wearing her seat belt, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Murray said investigators are not sure what caused John Doukas to lose control 
of the vehicle, which he estimated was traveling about 40 m.p.h. at the time of 
impact. An autopsy on the driver, scheduled for today, may provide more 
information, Murray said, speculating that it could have been a medical 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
The couple have a 13-year-old daughter, a former neighbor said.. 
</P>
<P>
John Doukas and his brother, Sam, founded the Duke's chain in the mid-1970s, 
according to Tony Triantos, owner of the Duke's Charbroiler in Santa Ana. 
Triantos said there are more than nine Duke's restaurants in Southern 
California. The brothers owned the restaurant in Orange while the other stores 
are owned by individual operators who lease the property from the Doukases. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a fine man, a hard worker," Triantos said of John Doukas. "A very hard 
worker."

Costa Mesa Mayor Peter F. Buffa, co-founder of a private group that promotes 
high-technology rail transit, on Monday was awarded a $25,000 contract by the 
Orange County Transit District to produce a video promoting high-tech 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The OCTD board voted 4 to 0, with William E. Farris abstaining, to award the 
contract to Buffa, who owns a video production company. The contract, which was 
not competitively bid, carries the condition that Buffa must raise the 
remainder of the $75,000 production cost from other agencies in Orange and Los 
Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
San Juan Capistrano rancher Tom Rogers, a frequent critic of county 
transportation officials, criticized the contract as an example of government 
insiders' receiving favored treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Buffa could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Board of Supervisors Chairman Don R. Roth is an OCTD member who also is 
chairman of the California-Nevada Super Speed Ground Transportation Commission, 
a bistate panel overseeing plans for a 200 m.p.h. magnetically levitated train 
between Las Vegas and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Buffa has been a leading advocate of the train, and his video will include 
material about it, OCTD officials said. The video will also show light rail, 
monorail, people mover and automated highway systems. 
</P>
<P>
Last March, Buffa accompanied Roth on a 10-day trip to Europe to ride a maglev 
prototype and the French TGV. 
</P>
<P>
"I deplore it," Rogers said of the contract decision. "They should not be 
entering into a contractual agreement with people who may be a factor in future 
votes. . . . It's the height of arrogance, and it leads to the appearance of 
impropriety." 
</P>
<P>
Roth said he did not help Buffa secure the contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not at the last (OCTD) board meeting where they went into an in-depth 
discussion about this," Roth said. "I don't have any problem with putting out a 
video about all forms of transit." 
</P>
<P>
Buffa is a co-founder of Transportation Alternatives for Southern California, a 
private group based in Newport Beach that promotes high-technology rail 
transit. Buffa also is a member of the San Joaquin Hills Transportation 
Corridor Agency, which is exploring rail transit for the median of a toll road 
now being built between MacArthur Boulevard in Newport Beach and Interstate 5 
near San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Farris said he abstained because he had not seen backup materials supporting 
the video proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Orange County Transportation Commission drew fire for hiring 
Newport Beach Councilman John C. Cox Jr. as a lobbyist for Measure M, the 
half-cent sales tax proposal that was defeated 12 months ago and that appears 
again on today's Orange County ballot.

BURGLARS MAY HAVE STRUCK AS MAN LAY DEAD

<P>
Two men have been arrested on suspicion of burglarizing a house where, 
investigators believe, the homeowner's body may have lain decomposing in the 
garage when the crime occurred. 
</P>
<P>
The two were arrested after an investigation into the death of Edward G. 
Stecki, 76, whose body was found last Wednesday at his home in the 1100 block 
of Weatherby Road in Rossmoor, Sheriff's Department Lt. Richard J. Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested on suspicion of burglary and grand theft, auto, were David Lane Neve, 
26, of Rossmoor, and Raymond Wayne Gamboa, 28, of Buena Park, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy revealed that Stecki had been dead for one to two weeks before his 
body was found. Although the autopsy was not conclusive, pending results of 
toxicological tests, there were no obvious signs of trauma, and foul play did 
not appear to be involved, Olson said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
"During the follow-up investigation of the death, family members were contacted 
and it appeared that the victim had a 1985 Chevrolet Corvette that was missing, 
along with a .38-caliber handgun, some coins, miscellaneous jewelry and stereo 
equipment," Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
After further investigation, sheriff's deputies learned that Neve, who was 
wanted on a parole violation, lived near Stecki's home, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Neve was placed under surveillance, and on Friday he was stopped in his 
vehicle, Olson said. Investigators found the stolen coins in the vehicle, Olson 
said. In searching Neve's house, officers also recovered the stereo equipment. 
</P>
<P>
"Investigators also obtained information that led them to believe the stolen 
Corvette was in the Buena Park area," Olson said. Sheriff's deputies found the 
car near Hoffman Street and Lincoln Avenue in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Investigators further learned that Gamboa aided Neve in stealing the Corvette 
from the Stecki residence," Olson said.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK;

<P>
TRIP BACK IN TIME HAS GIVEN EBERHART A NEW PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joli Eberhart got a new perspective on herself as a volleyball player this 
summer, but it took a time warp of sorts for it to happen. 
</P>
<P>
Eberhart, an outside hitter for Golden West College, spent part of her summer 
coaching a group of seventh-graders for the Orange County Volleyball Club. 
</P>
<P>
Her charges were flighty at times, and didn't always realize why their coach 
asked them to do things in a particular fashion. They also reminded her of 
herself a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It made me understand how come coaches ask you to do things certain ways," 
said Eberhart, 20. 
</P>
<P>
She spent the remainder of her summer working harder than ever for the upcoming 
season. And things have gone very well for Eberhart and the Rustlers. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West (14-1, 9-0 in conference) is a victory away from clinching the 
Orange Empire Conference title, and Eberhart has led the way. 
</P>
<P>
She was voted the most valuable player of the Santa Barbara Tournament of 
Champions, one of the most competitive tournaments in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"She always worked hard," Golden West Coach Al Gasparian said. "Now she is just 
better focused." 
</P>
<P>
For Eberhart, mention of the word "focused" brings a smile. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the word," she said. "Maybe I'm getting a little more serious. Before, 
I would be a little spacey, but coaching this summer did me a lot of good. I 
see things a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
Eberhart, 5 feet 7, also found inspiration from first-year assistant Nancy 
Hillman, who is also 5-7. Hillman was a four-year starter for USC at outside 
hitter, a position usually played by women three to four inches taller. 
</P>
<P>
But Eberhart has risen above her competition because of her keen desire and 
powerful legs. She realized she wasn't going to be 5-10 or so when she was a 
freshman at Mater Dei High School, so she devoted time to working on her leg 
strength. But having Hillman at practice each day also gave her great 
incentive. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets me going," Eberhart said of Hillman. "Just seeing her hit on the other 
side of the net, I get motivated, especially because she is my size." 
</P>
<P>
Eberhart came to Golden West after turning down a scholarship to Idaho State. 
She also was recruited by Chapman out of high school. Arizona showed an 
interest in her after last season, but she opted to stay at Golden West. 
</P>
<P>
She is currently being recruited by several colleges, including St. Mary's, 
Loyola Marymount and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
The ever-evolving Orange Empire Conference men's soccer race developed into a 
tie Monday, thanks to action on and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast, the defending state champion, and Irvine Valley, in its first 
year in the league, are tied for first place with 19 points each. Both have 
8-1-3 records. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Valley was a point back after Friday's games, but picked it up thanks to 
a forfeit from Cypress. Cypress announced Monday it had to forfeit four 
victories and two ties, including one to Irvine Valley, because one of its 
players violated the state athletic code by playing on a club team during the 
college season. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came six days after Rancho Santiago, which was tied for first 
place last Monday, had to forfeit 14 victories and two ties for having two 
players who also played with a club team. OCC and Irvine Valley picked up 
forfeit victories from Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago since has disbanded its team for the season's final two 
matches. OCC plays at San Bernardino Valley today and at Cypress Friday. Irvine 
Valley plays today at Fullerton and will finish Friday with a forfeit victory 
over Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
The top two teams from the conference advance to the playoffs. Fullerton 
(7-3-2) is in third place with 16 points.

O.C. EX-BROKER PLEADS GUILTY TO INSIDER TRADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE MICHAUD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
A former Newport Beach stockbroker has pleaded guilty in New York federal court 
to illegal insider trading for using advance information culled from Business 
Week magazine before it was published, federal authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
John L. Petit, 34, a former stockbroker for Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; 
Co. in Newport Beach, admitted that he illegally earned $66,556 using nonpublic 
information provided by a salesman working at a Torrance printing plant where 
the magazine was printed. 
</P>
<P>
He faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Petit also agreed to settle civil charges of insider trading filed by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. As part of the settlement, he agreed to pay 
$195,528 in illegal profits, fines and interest. He also was barred from the 
securities industry for life. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the settlement is a good settlement for the SEC and for the public," 
said Jeffrey Zuckerman, an official in the enforcement division of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Petit is the 11th person in six separate cases to be charged by the SEC for 
insider trading based on advanced data from Business Week, which is published 
by McGraw-Hill Inc. He is also the second Orange County stockbroker caught up 
in the scandal. Both stockbrokers obtained the information from employees of 
R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co. Inc., the Torrance printer. But the cases are not 
connected, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we know, they were separate conspiracies," Zuckerman said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation is continuing, and Zuckerman said Petit has agreed to 
cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
According to the charges filed in U.S. District Court in New York, Petit bought 
stocks from September, 1986, to July, 1988, based on pre-published information 
from a widely read Business Week advice column "Inside Wall Street." A 
favorable mention in the column often resulted in an immediate increase in 
price. 
</P>
<P>
The inside information, which was used to buy stock in at least 42 companies, 
was provided to Petit and others by Shayne Walters, a salesman for Donnelley. 
In exchange, Petit, who now lives in Boca Raton, Fla., gave Walters a discount 
on brokerage commissions and later hundreds of dollars a week in cash often 
paid in Smith Barney's parking lot and a parking lot of a McDonald's 
restaurant. Others who were not identified also made payments to Walters for 
the information. 
</P>
<P>
Walters pleaded guilty in August, 1989, in New York federal court to conspiracy 
to commit fraud and perjury and is awaiting sentencing on those charges. He 
also agreed to settle charges filed by the SEC by paying back $31,033 in 
profits he made, plus an equal amount as a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Zuckerman would not say whether further charges will be brought, but he said 
the investigation is continuing. He said that five of the Business Week cases 
have ended in settlements and that a sixth is still pending in Connecticut and 
involves five defendants. 
</P>
<P>
In May, a federal jury in Los Angeles ruled that an Anaheim stockbroker and a 
print shop worker for Donnelley also engaged in inside trading using Business 
Week.

Bank Holding Company Reports Loss: West Coast Bancorp, a multibank holding 
company that owns Sunwest Bank of Tustin, posted a third-quarter loss of 
$904,000, negating its profits for the year and leaving it $197,000 in the red 
for the first nine months. The loss was a result of a decision by the company 
to add $3.6 million to its reserves against the possibility of loan losses in 
the future, said John B. Joseph, chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, West Coast reported earnings of $761,000 for the third quarter and 
earnings of $1.4 million for the nine months. It had $474.2 million in assets 
at the end of September, contrasted with $468.5 million a year earlier. Much of 
the third quarter was related to loans made by West Coast Realty Finance, a 
mortgage lender that ceased operations in April, when the market for home loans 
dried up.

HOME SALES IN CALIFORNIA ARE DOWN SHARPLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. McCLAIN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California's drop-off in home sales during the third quarter of the year was 
one of the sharpest in the nation, 18.9%, but the state's price situation in 
the three-month period was erratic, the National Assn. of Realtors reported 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The median resale price dropped in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Orange 
County, but it rose 24% in the Sacramento area. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, sales of existing homes from July through September slipped 2.5% 
from their level a year earlier and will remain slow in the first half of 1991 
because of the weakening economy, a real estate trade group said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The realtors group said sales of previously owned homes totaled a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 3.66 million units in the three-month period. Sales 
declined in the year's two previous quarters as well. 
</P>
<P>
The sales slump was worse than California's in other only three other states -- 
Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
California's sales drop of 18.9% for the three-month period covered 409,300 
homes sold. The median home resale price in the July-to-September period also 
fell in most of California compared to the same three months in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest drop was a 4.7% decline in the median price in the Los Angeles area 
to $211,407. The San Francisco area had a 3.1% price decline to a median of 
$261,000. Orange County had a 1.8% price drop to a median of $241,700. 
</P>
<P>
The price increase in the Sacramento area was a 24.4% jump to a median of 
$144,600. And there was a 3% rise in the Riverside-San Bernardino area to a 
median price of $132,400. The median resale price in the San Diego area for the 
three months held nearly steady at $186,600, up .1%. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the West, median home prices were up sharply in Seattle, Portland 
and Phoenix, and the number of home resales rose sharply in Idaho, Utah and 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the realtors association recorded sales of 3.78 million units last 
year, down from 3.95 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Although there were areas of strength in the housing industry during the third 
quarter, sales declined in 28 states and were unchanged in Oregon. Nineteen 
states posted increases. Statistics were unavailable for Alaska and Maine. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, however, "the market will remain slow for the rest of 1990 and into 
the first half of 1991 as the country experiences a mild recession," said 
Norman A. Flynn, president of the National Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
John A. Tuccillo, the association's chief economist, said the availability of 
moderately priced houses boosted sales in the South and kept them from falling 
faster in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
Sales in the Western states fell 8.8% to an annual rate of 580,000, and in the 
Northeast were down 8.5% to a rate of 650,000. 
</P>
<P>
Tuccillo said the decline in the West largely resulted from a sharp drop in 
coastal California markets. The median price dropped 5.3% to $138,200, 
reflecting more purchases in less costly inland markets. 
</P>
<P>
Sales in the Northeast have been sluggish for nearly two years, and "although 
Pennsylvania resale activity appears to be recovering, the rest of the region, 
particularly along the Boston-New York corridor, remains down in the dumps," 
Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
The median price of a home in the Northeast dropped 2.7% to $143,100. 
</P>
<P>
"Home sales along the New York-Boston corridor have been gridlocked by sellers 
who've been reluctant to lower their prices to fit a buyers' market, and by 
buyers who've been waiting for lower prices," Tuccillo said. 
</P>
<P>
The realtors association also reported that the median price of an existing 
home was $96,600, 1.8% above that for the third quarter of 1989. It ranged from 
$375,000 in Honolulu to $49,200 in Saginaw, Mich., among the 96 metropolitan 
areas surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
The median price means half of the homes cost more, half less. The survey 
included detached homes, townhouses, apartment condominiums and cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
The only region experiencing increased sales was the South, where sales rose 
1.4% to an annual rate of 1.42 million. Several oil-patch areas that had 
suffered adverse market conditions in recent years recorded increases. 
</P>
<P>
Texas had a third-quarter increase of 8.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of 246,300 units. Oklahoma, another oil-producing state, posted a 7.3% gain to 
55,100 units. Sales were up 5.9% in Louisiana to 37,100 units. 
</P>
<P>
The median price of a home in the South was $97,200, up 1.8% from a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOME PRICES 
</P>
<P>
Homes sales slumped in California in the third quarter from a year ago and 
housing prices slumped in the coastal counties, including Orange County.

CMS AGREES TO MARKET TRIGEM'S COMPUTER LINE

CMS Enhancements Inc. said Monday that it has formed a joint venture with an 
affiliate of South Korea's largest personal computer maker, TriGem Corp., to 
distribute the Korean firm's computers in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two companies will jointly market TriGem computers in 
the United States. The two firms did not disclose financial details of the 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
"After carefully searching for the right U.S. marketing partner, we have found 
the highest level of synergy between TriGem and CMS," TriGem Chairman Young M. 
Kimm said. "We are now looking at how we can most effectively combine TriGem's 
product development and manufacturing capabilities with the marketing, 
distribution and sales strengths of CMS." 
</P>
<P>
CMS, based in Tustin, manufactures and distributes disk drives and related 
computer equipment. 
</P>
<P>
TriGem manufactures computers for Japan's Seiko Epson Corp., which are sold 
under the Epson name. But it plans to introduce its own line of computer 
products for sale in the United States. Michael Sullivan, a TriGem spokesman, 
said the company has spent more than $15 million developing the product line, 
which will be introduced at the Comdex trade show next week. 
</P>
<P>
TriGem employs about 2,000 people in South Korea and 30 at its U.S. subsidiary 
in Santa Clara. The company contacted a number of potential partners before 
choosing CMS, Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither company would say whether CMS would be the exclusive distributor of 
TriGem products in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
TriGem plans to introduce 21 products, including personal computers, 
workstations, laptop and notebook computers, fax machines and other 
telecommunications products. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very excited about the strong, competitively priced computers that the 
company has developed for the U.S. and look forward to being the marketing arm 
of a very successful and enduring effort," said Jim Farooquee, president and 
chief executive of CMS. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Lackey, a CMS spokesman, said the company viewed the long-term agreement 
as an opportunity to expand its distribution business. He said he did not know 
how much the agreement would contribute to CMS sales. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Matheson, an analyst with the Newport Beach investment firm Cruttenden 
&amp; Co., described the announcement as the "best news from the company I've 
heard in a while." Based on the breadth of the products being introduced, he 
estimated that the agreement could generate up to $20 million in additional 
sales for CMS next year.

FAIRWAY TO SETTLE SUIT ON ALLEGED MISREPRESENTATIONS

The Fairway group of automotive dealerships has agreed to pay about $80,000 to 
settle a civil lawsuit that alleged it fail to tell car buyers that they were 
getting former rental vehicles, the Orange County district attorney's office 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Fairway Lincoln Mercury, Toyota, Volkswagen and Ford were accused of violating 
a state Department of Motor Vehicles regulation by failing to tell more than 60 
customers that they were buying used rental cars. 
</P>
<P>
State authorities also claimed that some salespeople had told used-car buyers 
that they were purchasing former company cars or demonstration models when they 
were really former rentals. 
</P>
<P>
"Salespeople were picking things out of the air to tell people," Deputy Dist. 
Atty. William J. Feccia said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the company agreed to pay a civil penalty of $50,000, it did not admit 
to any wrongdoing. The Fairway group agreed to refund 5% of the purchase price 
of each car, or a total rebate of about $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
Fairway defense attorney John D. McGuire said that the dealerships were not 
aware of the cars' histories and that a prior DMV hearing failed to prove that 
they were knowledgeable. 
</P>
<P>
"We are settling this case because it makes economic sense," McGuire said. "The 
restitution to the customer is a gesture of goodwill." 
</P>
<P>
Fairway Lincoln Mercury -- now known as Fullerton Lincoln Mercury -- and 
Fairway Toyota are both in Fullerton. Fairway Ford is based in Placentia and 
Fairway Volkswagen is no longer in business.

CANCER &amp; PREGNANCY;

<P>
DILEMMA SOMETIMES PITS SURVIVAL AGAINST ABORTION

<P>
The new mother studied the petal-pink baby sleeping beside her. 
</P>
<P>
"I call him my little miracle baby," Pam Baird said as she gazed at 8-week-old 
Nathan. 
</P>
<P>
Miracle indeed. 
</P>
<P>
For Baird learned that she had breast cancer not long after she learned that 
she was pregnant. And a nationally known oncologist urged an immediate 
abortion, then chemotherapy, as her best chance to survive. 
</P>
<P>
But after consulting more than a dozen specialists and a hospital ethics 
committee, Baird, like a growing number of pregnant women with cancer, decided 
to try to beat the disease -- and keep her baby. 
</P>
<P>
After a mastectomy, she began an aggressive course of chemotherapy. Every few 
weeks for most of her pregnancy, Baird reported to the Breast Care Center in 
Orange for injections of three anti-cancer drugs. Sometimes the powerful toxins 
made her throw up. Sometimes her blond curls fell out in handfuls. And 
sometimes -- scared for her baby and whether she would live to raise him -- she 
cried. 
</P>
<P>
But once a month, at the obstetrician's office, Baird was reassured by a black 
and white ultrasound image that showed a normal baby curled tightly inside her. 
</P>
<P>
In August, about five weeks early, Baird delivered a healthy 5-pound, 4-ounce 
boy. And this week, after finishing her last chemotherapy treatment, she and 
her husband Rodger celebrated with champagne. 
</P>
<P>
Baird's cancer is in remission, her oncologist, David Margileth said, adding, 
"Here's a breast cancer patient I feel optimistic about. . . . Here's a woman I 
think will be around to raise her baby." 
</P>
<P>
Cancer is rare in pregnancy. A spokeswoman from the National Cancer Institute 
estimated that a malignancy occurs once in a thousand pregnancies, with breast 
cancer once in every 3,500. 
</P>
<P>
But when it does occur, it raises deep emotional and ethical questions for 
patients and their doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Should the mother-to-be have an abortion? Can she afford to delay cancer 
treatment until her baby is mature enough for delivery? Will the baby be harmed 
by chemotherapy? And will the mother live to care for her child? 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, obstetricians and oncologists said, the standard 
recommendation for breast cancer during pregnancy was an immediate abortion 
followed by mastectomy, radiation or chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, an abortion had been recommended because the physician was 
uncomfortable about doing the treatments necessary for the mother for fear of 
injuring the fetus," said Dr. Frankie Ann Holmes, an assistant professor of 
medical oncology at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Today, some doctors still advocate abortion, but many others like Holmes are 
convinced: "You don't have to terminate." 
</P>
<P>
Radiation therapy is still considered harmful to the baby during all stages of 
pregnancy, and diagnostic abdominal X-rays have been associated with a high 
risk of leukemia after birth and other malignancies, some doctors report. 
</P>
<P>
But chemotherapy is a different story. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-cancer drugs can harm a baby during the first trimester when the heart, 
lungs and other organs are developing, medical articles show. Though the 
articles don't indicate why this is the case, many of the same drugs can be 
used safely in the second and third trimester, Holmes, other oncologists and 
obstetricians have reported. 
</P>
<P>
At the Houston center, for instance, four breast cancer patients who had 
chemotherapy in pregnancy gave birth to normal babies this year, Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some doctors admit that they are very uncomfortable when treating a 
pregnant woman for cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody kind of wrings their hands a little bit," said Dr. Robert Dillman, 
director of the Hoag Cancer Center in Newport Beach. "You really would like to 
get the fetus out." 
</P>
<P>
Margileth said that as Baird's pregnancy continued during the chemotherapy, "I 
tossed and turned about this. . . . Are we doing the right thing?" 
</P>
<P>
Margileth said he was also concerned that the normally happy experience of 
pregnancy had become a troubling one because of the cancer. "Here's this nice, 
3-to-4-month pregnant person that you just wish was shopping at South Coast 
Plaza for maternity clothes -- rather than getting Adriamcyin (a chemotherapy 
agent)," Margileth said. 
</P>
<P>
Another major concern: Doctors around the nation say there is little data 
showing the long-term effects of chemotherapy on an unborn child. Doctors say 
they simply don't know if such children will develop major problems, like 
infertility and leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
"We worry," said Dr. Gerald Gilchrist, chairman of pediatrics at the Mayo 
Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and also chairman of the American Academy of 
Pediatric's section on hematology and oncology. He added: "I don't think anyone 
knows." 
</P>
<P>
Baird noticed a lump in her right breast late last January, shortly after she 
had weaned her first son, Rory, now 17 months. Not long after that, a home 
pregnancy test and then a visit to Orange obstetrician Peter Anzaldo confirmed 
that she was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Anzaldo suggested that the breast lump might be caused by a clogged milk duct, 
Baird said, but sent her to the Breast Center for a more detailed exam. 
</P>
<P>
There a biopsy revealed a large, cancerous tumor. And in March, as Baird 
entered her second trimester, she had a mastectomy. That surgery showed her 
cancer had spread, invading one lymph node. And so the debate began in earnest. 
Should Baird abort? Should she continue her pregnancy and have chemotherapy? 
</P>
<P>
Baird wasn't sure what to do. "I had a 10-month-old son. I didn't want to die 
of breast cancer and leave him without a mother. . . . But I didn't want to 
have an abortion." 
</P>
<P>
Margileth began researching the issue, reading journal articles and contacting 
experts around the country. When his first contact, a renowned breast cancer 
specialist, emphatically recommended abortion, Baird spent a sleepless week in 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
But Margileth continued his inquiries, finding many oncologists who thought 
Baird could continue her pregnancy and start chemotherapy in the second 
trimester. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Baird's family and friends did their own research. Her brother, a 
medical student, sent copies of the few nationally reported studies on cancer 
in pregnancy. A friend, an oncology nurse, talked to experts at the National 
Institutes of Health. Her mother, who was also being treated for breast cancer, 
talked to doctors. 
</P>
<P>
And her husband, Rodger, , an environmental chemist, asked the National Cancer 
Institute for a list of reports on pregnant women with cancer, then wrote their 
authors to see how the babies had fared. 
</P>
<P>
The three doctors who responded offered good news: the babies were normal. 
Exulted Korean obstetrician Doo Sang Kim: "The bottom line is 'The baby is now 
4 years and 5 months old and very healthy!' " Wrote another, Dr. Thomas G. Day 
Jr., director of gynecologic oncology at the James Graham Brown Cancer Center 
in Louisville, Ky.: "I would like to reassure you that if chemotherapy is 
started after 12 to 14 months, it is probably safe." 
</P>
<P>
The Bairds took one more step. At Anzaldo's suggestion, they asked St. Joseph 
Health System's perinatal bioethics committee to review their case. A 25-member 
committee that included doctors, a geneticist, a social worker and a priest 
listened as Anzaldo presented diverse opinions on what to do. The committee 
provided a forum for the issues, but no recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Rodger Baird called the meeting "cathartic. They didn't have any 
lectures for us. I spent half the time asking technical questions of the 
geneticist." 
</P>
<P>
But when it ended, the Bairds had come to a conclusion. Three days later, in 
her 15th week of pregnancy, Pam Baird received her first dose of chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I had it, I just cried," she recalled. "It was scary" to know 
she was pregnant and yet three powerful, toxic drugs -- Adriamycin, Cytoxan and 
an agent called 5 Fu -- were coursing through her veins. 
</P>
<P>
Though she became nauseated and her hair fell out, the treatments never seemed 
to affect the baby, Baird said. Each month, "I just relied on Dr. Anzaldo that 
everything was all right. At each visit, he took a sonogram and I could see the 
baby move." 
</P>
<P>
Nathan Trilling Baird was born prematurely, by Cesarean section, after Baird's 
amniotic fluid began leaking in the eighth month of her pregnancy. Anzaldo said 
he does not believe that the anti-cancer drugs caused the premature birth or 
affected the baby. 
</P>
<P>
The Bairds are thankful, and still a little amazed, that chemotherapy didn't 
hurt their son. "These are really nasty compounds," Rodger Baird said. "But the 
baby's definitely healthy." 
</P>
<P>
As for Pam Baird, she is busy caring for cuddly Nathan as well as trying to 
keep track of Rory, an active toddler. 
</P>
<P>
But if her ordeal is over, Baird has some suggestions for other women who might 
find themselves pregnant and diagnosed with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't just rely on one doctor," she advised. "Take the initiative to research 
it. Don't just go on blind faith." 
</P>
<P>
The Bairds recently wrote the three cancer specialists they had heard from, 
thanking them for their responses and reporting that mother and baby were fine. 
</P>
<P>
And Pam Baird said she was considering sending one more letter -- and a picture 
of Nathan -- to the prominent breast cancer specialist who had urged an 
abortion. The note will be brief, Baird said: "This is the baby we wouldn't 
have had."

BREEDING BIRD: GREEN-BACKED HERON (BUTORIDES STRIATUS) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Description: Small, stocky heron with short yellow legs (males' legs are bright 
orange during high mating plumage); glossy blue-green back; neck is deep 
chestnut. The immature heron is browner above, white chest and neck streaked 
with brown. 
</P>
<P>
Average length is 18 inches, wing span is 26 inches. Formerly called the Little 
Green Heron. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Marshes, ponds, wetlands; often perch in tops of eucalyptus trees. 
</P>
<P>
Diet: Fish, insects, snails, crayfish, shrimp and small amphibians. 
</P>
<P>
Displays: Male raises crest and neck plumes, swells throat and calls while 
hopping from foot to foot in front of female. 
</P>
<P>
Nest: Woven twigs and branches near or over water. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs: Light green with bluish hue. Length is 1 1/2 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Notes: Green-backed herons have been observed using insects, berries or twigs 
(which are often trimmed to size) for bait. After casting the lures onto the 
water, the herons crouch and wait for curious or hungry fish to inspect the 
bait. This is a rare case of tool use and, especially, tool manufacturing in 
ornithology.

KEEPING FIT: INSTRUCTOR THAWS OUT THE USUALLY FROZEN YOGA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By APRIL JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was in the early 1970s that Geo Takoma lost sight of himself as he battled 
the hellish nightmares of running bird dog patrols in Vietnam. Within a few 
months of his honorable discharge, the former Marine sergeant took a long, hard 
look in the mirror. 
</P>
<P>
The frightening image staring back -- an abusive, overweight alcoholic -- shook 
him back into reality. Takoma stopped resisting what Vietnam had given him, the 
desire to live in a peaceful world, and set immediately to work re-creating 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
By adopting a Hindu philosophy, Takoma transformed himself from an aggressive 
individual into one who teaches peace through yoga. His classes attract 150 
students a week around Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, I'm American," said Takoma. "Real American. I played football in 
high school, went to war, and liked the aspect of competition this society 
thrives on. I used to thrive on it, too. The brutal aggression of war closed my 
heart. That was killing me." 
</P>
<P>
Takoma wanted to regain the muscular build and physical endurance he had as a 
football player, but he didn't want to re-enter the competitive side of 
athletics. He was drawn to the nonaggressive philosophy of yoga. 
</P>
<P>
"I absolutely fell in love with yoga," he said. "I wanted to learn everything I 
possibly could about it." 
</P>
<P>
In his study, the wanna-be yogi traveled to India but discovered he disliked 
traditional yoga methods. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine, going all the way to India only to discover that . . . , " he said. 
"India didn't have the intense level of yoga I was seeking." 
</P>
<P>
By 1975, he gained certification under the guidance of Indra Devi, considered 
to be the first lady of yoga. "Now she's 90," Takoma said, "and she's still 
teaching today. 
</P>
<P>
"In studying many different yoga philosophies I began to see that, whether in 
Southern California or India, the morose nature of those spiritual classes 
where you walk around like you're half-dead bores me. And it bores most 
Americans. We're an action-oriented society, so I devised a new American-style 
yoga." 
</P>
<P>
Takoma broke some rules in establishing "Power Yoga," an intense hourlong 
session filled with stretching and visualization exercises. Postures blend 
ancient yoga teachings with the fact that Americans have wider hips, bigger 
legs and tighter necks than the yoga masters of Buddha's day. 
</P>
<P>
The avant-garde meditations are offered at the Girl's Gym in Newport Beach, 
Club Postnuclear in Laguna Beach and Sports Club Irvine, or Takoma will guide 
you through his teachings in the privacy of your home. Classes vary in size but 
average around 20 students, with both men and women participating. The cost is 
$8 a session or $55 a month, in a public or private setting. 
</P>
<P>
"More women than men attend," Takoma said. "But men need to learn to relax. Men 
need to open their hearts and awaken the child within too." 
</P>
<P>
In Takoma's philosophy, to be fully alive is to be fully spirited like a child, 
so he imitates movements a baby makes. Under his guidance, he says the body can 
respond to the arching, twisting yoga postures with the elasticity and the 
enthusiasm of youth. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans carry stress in our necks," he said. "So I reworked the positions to 
eliminate any additional neck stress. But most of the positions are derived 
from a baby's natural movements used to strengthen its newly formed body." 
</P>
<P>
Some of Takoma's poses are drawn from his experiences as a football player and 
weightlifter. In the "linebacker" pose, students maintain a position like a 
defensive linebacker with their legs set shoulder-width apart, knees slightly 
bent, body weight forward, hands out in front. This stretches the hamstrings 
and works the lower back into a fully relaxed position. 
</P>
<P>
The "Russian weightlifter" is designed to strengthen the upper body and tighten 
the triceps. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the students imagine they're one of those Russian weightlifters lifting 
900 pounds," Takoma explained. "With one big breath they hoist the weight over 
their heads. Then we quickly repeat this exercise for 10 repetitions. By the 
last lift, everyone is heaving and puffing from the strain of the imagined 
weight. It's a real high to look out at those straining, grimacing faces." 
</P>
<P>
Looking for a real workout that wouldn't strain her knees led Debbie 
Heussenstamm to "Power Yoga." Advised by an orthopedic surgeon to cut aerobics 
classes from her exercise regimen, which also included swimming and speed 
walking, Heussenstamm decided to give yoga a try. She heard about power yoga 
through a friend. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought this was going to be a class on stretching," she said. "I had no 
idea you could build up such a sweat. Power yoga has even replaced my swimming 
and speed-walking routine." 
</P>
<P>
At first, Heussenstamm attended classes once a week; now she's developed a 
four-times-a-week habit. Debbie, a weaver, and her husband, Paul, an artist, 
open their art-filled home to Takoma and his yoga devotees four mornings a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"Classes used to be held at the fire station in Emerald Bay," Debbie said. "But 
the floors were hardwood and the firemen were noisy. It will be a year ago 
tomorrow that we were told we'd have to cancel class because of the voting 
booths. I have a big living room, so I invited every one up to my house. Pretty 
soon we decided to just move the classes to our house." 
</P>
<P>
Recovering from a severe auto accident led Jan Ernst of Huntington Beach on her 
search for an exercise regimen that could rebuild her sprained back but support 
her weakened spine. Although she was unable to do many of the traditional 
inverted yoga postures, she found she could participate in Takoma's class. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been into yoga for over 20 years," Ernst said. "Geo's program is a 
complete physical and spiritual workout. His techniques build muscles and 
tissues through isometrics and stretching. There's no need for stress-inducing 
equipment." 
</P>
<P>
For Geo Takoma, power yoga is an offshoot of the Love Generation. 
</P>
<P>
"The '60s planted the seed," he said. "The '90s gets rid of the mythology and 
moves toward reality."

THIS DRUMMER ALSO WRITES THE SONGS; 
</P>
<P>
JAZZ: AMONG OTHER WORKS, TONY WILLIAMS HAS WRITTEN A 20-MINUTE PIECE FOR STRING 
QUARTET. HE AND HIS BAND WILL BEGIN A GIG AT CATALINA'S TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tony Williams is just one of numerous jazz drummers who have not only played 
with great musicality but have also composed, in styles ranging from 
unaccompanied solo pieces for the trap set and jazz pieces to extended works 
for orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Others traps players and composers include Louie Bellson, Max Roach, Denzil 
Best, Ralph Peterson and Ndugu Chancler. Among the pieces written by drummers 
are Roach's "Drum Conversation," Best's "Move" and his collaboration with 
Thelonious Monk, "Bemsha Swing," Bellson's "Skin Deep" and Williams' "Sister 
Cheryl." 
</P>
<P>
Williams has been recording his original tunes since his debut album, 1964's 
"Lifetime" (Blue Note). But when he was unable to come up with a tune for his 
1979 CBS LP "The Joy of Flying," the Boston native -- whose innovations in 
rhythm sparked Miles Davis' classic 1960s quintets and were instrumental in 
changing the way modern drummers played -- knew things had to change. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have time to write anything for that album and I was disappointed in 
myself," said Williams, 44, whose quintet plays tonight through Sunday at 
Catalina Bar &amp; Grill in Hollywood. "I didn't have the facility to put 
something together quickly that was quality. It frustrated me and I decided I 
would not continue like that, that I wanted to raise the level of my ability." 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Williams, who lives in San Anselmo in the Bay Area, began a private 
course of classical study with UC Berkeley professor Robert Greenberg that ran 
intermittently until 1987. "I had studied elementary counterpoint on my own, 
and with Greenberg I continued with such areas as double counterpoint and 
fugues," he said at his New York City hotel, where he was appearing recently at 
the Blue Note club. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of his studies, Williams has acquired the facility he lacked a 
decade ago. "I'm able to put notes on paper quickly, analyze and manipulate the 
material better," said the man who has composed all of the modern, mainstream 
songs for his four latest Blue Note albums, including the most recent, "Native 
Heart." "I can get an idea and then develop it into something more, expand it. 
I can look at other's people's material and understand why it sounds the way it 
sounds, which helps me learn." 
</P>
<P>
The teacher-student exchange excited Williams. "I like learning. Taking a 
lesson in, having it graded, finding out what I did right, and wrong, I'd come 
away from that feeling happy," he said, after a draw on his ever-present cigar. 
</P>
<P>
The drummer who composes at the keyboard, Williams recently completed his first 
expanded work, Rituals for String Quartet, Piano, Drums and Cymbals. "It's in 
the classic string-quartet form with four sections," Williams said. "I started 
it in February, and if I had been able to work on it full-time -- I'm currently 
touring about half the year -- I would have finished it in about five months." 
The 20-minute piece was given its premiere Friday by the Kronos Quartet, 
pianist Herbie Hancock and the composer at the Herbst Theatre in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Williams finds himself constantly getting ideas that he distills into songs to 
be played by his long-standing quintet. The members are Bill Pierce, saxes, 
Wallace Roney, trumpet, Mulgrew Miller, piano and Ira Coleman, bass. "I always 
have stuff, ideas, pieces of paper with music on them, some from years ago, and 
I work from that," said the drummer. 
</P>
<P>
The time that Williams is on the road with the band is often employed to shape 
and sharpen these compositions, which run the gamut from hard-driving 
quicksilver works to easy-motoring numbers with a bossa-rock flair. "For 
'Native Heart,' we played the tunes a lot -- at sound checks, at rehearsals -- 
before we went into the studios," he said. "Plus I did a lot of work on the 
tunes myself. I'd see how a tune sounds, then take it and change it. That's a 
luxury that I afford myself because of the writing skills that I have gained." 
</P>
<P>
Since he concocts everything in his group's library, the group's voice is 
really Williams' own. "I don't want it to sound like other bands, and since I 
know why other bands sound the way they do, it's easy for me to make the band 
sound unique," he said. "I am going for things that I haven't heard before, and 
yet I want in certain ways to have the band sound traditional. I am not trying 
to do what people would think would be 'new' with a capital N. I don't put that 
kind of pressure on myself. I'm looking more for quality." 
</P>
<P>
The drummer is adamant about playing only his compositions. "I get a charge out 
of playing my original material," he said. "Maybe it's out of my own insecurity 
or fear, but I want to play music I want to play and that I want people to hear 
me play. This is the Tony Williams quintet that plays the music of Tony 
Williams. I'm proud of that, you bet. I hope the hard work shows."

RICK DU BROW: FOR THE BEST ELECTION COVERAGE, SKIP THE BIG THREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TV or not TV. . . . 
</P>
<P>
STRAIGHT TICKET: This is the kind of night -- election time -- when it pays to 
zap past the Big Three networks. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Jennings, Brokaw and Rather will deliver. 
</P>
<P>
But the best places to be for a story like this are CNN and C-SPAN -- and local 
TV for close-to-home issues. 
</P>
<P>
CNN and C-SPAN will start continuous coverage earlier -- by late afternoon -- 
and end later than the Big Three. 
</P>
<P>
And what's fun about a night like this is seeing how TV has changed, as names 
like CNN's Bernard Shaw and C-SPAN's Brian Lamb pull away network viewers for 
deeper and more rounded coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Invariably, too, old pros like ABC's David Brinkley get the nighttime spotlight 
again and radiate wistful reminders of the genesis of network news. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing is more riveting on C-SPAN than its live, viewer phone-in segments. 
They're often the best thing on TV for snap indications of how the nation 
regarded a political debate or presidential speech -- or election measures. 
</P>
<P>
And C-SPAN says that once again, during tonight's coverage: "Viewers are 
encouraged to call in and voice their opinions on the evening's events." 
</P>
<P>
GONE WITH THE WIND: With ABC now the dominant news network, day in and day out, 
behind such names as Ted Koppel, Jennings and Brinkley, it's mind-boggling to 
think of the bench strength that CBS allowed to get away: Roger Mudd, Bill 
Moyers and, most lately, Charlie Rose. 
</P>
<P>
BLOODY SUNDAY: There's a real network shoot-out this Sunday: CBS' movie "Fatal 
Attraction" goes up against NBC's miniseries "The Big One: The Great Los 
Angeles Earthquake" and ABC's film "Call Me Anna," an autobiographical drama 
with Patty Duke. It's network strategy for the November ratings sweeps, and the 
viewer be damned. 
</P>
<P>
THE NATURAL: CBS is crazy if it doesn't yank "Uncle Buck" from the 8 p.m. 
Monday slot and replace it with Burt Reynolds' new sitcom, "Evening Shade," 
which was strong in a tryout there last week. It's a perfect fit for CBS' 
women-oriented Monday lineup of "Major Dad," "Murphy Brown," "Designing Women" 
and "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill." 
</P>
<P>
ALL THE WAY: NBC keeps throwing everything it has into trying to make a big hit 
out of "Fresh Prince of Bel Air," which was beaten last week by "Evening Shade" 
and "Major Dad" despite airing a special one-hour episode. Latest ploy: a 
nationwide radio promotion contest for "Fresh Prince" starting this week, with 
KIIS-FM (102.7) taking part. NBC has bet the bank on "Fresh Prince." 
</P>
<P>
PEAK INTEREST: The truth is, we missed most of last week's outing of "Twin 
Peaks" -- but as a friend of ours says, how could you tell? In any case, if the 
ratings-troubled series doesn't get a shot in the arm from this Saturday's 
episode -- in which Laura Palmer's killer is supposedly revealed -- will ABC 
start contemplating a memorial service for this wondrously subversive adventure 
in weekly TV? Aw, let it run the season. 
</P>
<P>
THE LONG RUN: For better or worse, the Ed O'Neill-Katey Sagal series "Married . 
. . With Children" has become one of the most influential shows in TV history 
-- putting Fox Broadcasting on the map and changing standards in taste on the 
home screen. It's often funny, sometimes terrible -- and enormously popular 
with young, big-city audiences whose impact on network thinking is tremendous. 
</P>
<P>
TWO FOR THE ROAD: Week in and week out, Kristy McNichol and Dinah Manoff, 
playing emotionally conflicting sisters in "Empty Nest," are as likable, witty 
and talented as any comedy performers on network TV. For a long time now, 
"Empty Nest" hasn't needed the lead-in of "The Golden Girls." 
</P>
<P>
THE PEACOCK NETWORK: There, in Entertainment Weekly, is Brandon Tartikoff, 
chairman of the NBC Entertainment Group, draped in an NBC towel, wearing a grin 
-- and nothing else visible. More formally, Tartikoff said the other day that 
he'll use another Danielle Steele best-seller against CBS' college basketball 
championships April 1, just as he used a Steele miniseries against CBS' World 
Series. This is serious business. 
</P>
<P>
THE TOUCH: What a smashing directing job by Diane Keaton in last Saturday's 
Vietnam War drama "China Beach" -- a flashback tale in which Dana Delany, as 
Colleen McMurphy, simply sizzled in depicting her love-hate relationship with 
her mother. "China Beach" continues to be a splendid series, and Keaton and 
Delany took it to a level not often seen in weekly TV. 
</P>
<P>
TURKEY DAY: Not very flattering for the next "Face to Face With Connie Chung" 
special to be scheduled by CBS for Thanksgiving -- when audience tune-in is 
notoriously low because of the holiday dinner. 
</P>
<P>
MARATHON MEN: Yes, indeed, Rod Serling's "The Twilight Zone" will return for 
its annual Thanksgiving Day marathon on KTLA Channel 5. And hats off to viewers 
who doggedly tracked the Nick at Nite channel's "Alfred Hitchcock" marathon 
last week for that Bette Davis episode that was listed for Wednesday when the 
cable service actually meant early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
WIN SOME, LOSE SOME: Century Cable executive Bill Rosendahl has passed show No. 
200 in his lively series of political specials -- the best in town. There's no 
connection, of course, but I'd feel even better if my monthly Century Cable 
bill hadn't gone up $3. 
</P>
<P>
GOOD NEWS: The American Movie Classics channel finally goes around the clock 
Dec. 1. It'll start with a Marilyn Monroe marathon. For those who may not know, 
films on the AMC channel are unedited, and there are no commercials.

ROCK HUDSON INSURER NOT LIABLE

<P>
A federal judge has ruled that Rock Hudson's insurance company, Aetna, is not 
liable for the $14.5-million judgment awarded by a jury to the late actor's 
lover, a lawyer said today. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima, in issuing his ruling here Monday, 
found that because Hudson never told Marc Christian that he had AIDS, the 
actor's insurance coverage does not apply. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. will have to pay no part of the 
award. 
</P>
<P>
Aetna will also not be responsible for the legal costs of the ongoing appeal of 
the February, 1989, verdict against Hudson's estate, Aetna attorney Michael 
Leahy said.

MAN AWAITING DRIVING TEST RAMS DMV OFFICE

A 72-year-old man in line to take a driver's test today plowed his car into the 
Department of Motor Vehicles building in Canoga Park, injuring four customers 
and two employees before stopping 40 feet inside the office. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the injuries were minor. Four of the six injured were taken to area 
hospitals for treatment, said Pat Marek, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
File cabinets and desks were shoved out of way by the car, said DMV 
Investigator Steve Torres. One woman was dragged underneath the car and another 
went tumbling over the hood, witnesses said. When the car finally stopped, one 
person was pinned against the wall, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred as John Anderson of Reseda pulled his black pickup truck 
up along the side of the building to take a driver's test. Torres said that for 
some reason Anderson drove forward at a high rate of speed, made a large circle 
around the parking lot and crashed into the brick wall of the one-story DMV 
building. Anderson was not injured. The cause of the accident is under 
investigation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The DMV facility in the 20700 block of Sherman Way was closed after the 9:45 
a.m. accident because the computer system was down and employees were visibly 
shaken, Torres said. The building will be closed until the computer system is 
repaired, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"People were yelling it was an earthquake. They were screaming and running 
through to get out of the way," said Jerri Watson of Agoura, who was inside the 
building at the time and was still visibly shaken an hour after the incident. 
</P>
<P>
After the accident, Anderson said he lost control of the truck when the 
accelerator jammed. "I was pulling up to my spot to wait and the throttle 
stuck," Anderson said. "I put on the brakes. What I should have done is turned 
off the ignition, but I guess I panicked." 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Johnston, the registered owner of the truck who had driven Anderson to the 
DMV and was waiting inside for him, said she had never had any problems with 
the accelerator. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care if I ever drive again," Anderson said after the accident.

An elderly man on a behind-the-wheel driving test crashed into a Department of 
Motor Vehicles office today, injuring six people and causing $40,000 damage to 
the building, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"A 70-year-old man really flunked the driving test. 
</P>
<P>
He ran right into the building," said police officer Dennis Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car wasn't injured, but about 80 people inside the building, 
on Sherman Way in Canoga Park, scrambled for safety as the car burst into the 
office just before 10 a.m. and came to rest 30 feet inside. 
</P>
<P>
Two people were treated at the scene for minor injuries and four were taken to 
hospitals for examination. None of the injuries was serious. 
</P>
<P>
"He drove through the north wall of the building, through a counter section and 
into a work area of the building," said Jean Kolterman, the DMV office manager.

COUNTY TURNOUT MODERATE; 
</P>
<P>
PACE AT POLLS IS 1% UNDER '86 ELECTIONS

<P>
Orange County voters went to the polls in moderate numbers this election 
morning, despite predictions that turnout could be among the lowest recorded 
since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
By 11 a.m., 17% of eligible voters had cast their ballots, only 1% less than 
had voted by the same hour in the gubernatorial elections of 1986, said 
Registrar of Voters Donald F. Tanney. The final voter turnout in Orange County 
in 1986 was 60%, Tanney said today. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are going fairly smoothly," Tanney said. 
</P>
<P>
Most voters arriving at the polls this morning clutched sample ballots or crib 
sheets to help them sort through roughly 60 different contests, including the 
tight race for governor, seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and a 
bewildering array of 28 ballot propositions. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Orange County voters were deciding the fate of an incumbent county 
supervisor, district attorney and county superintendent of schools, as well as 
a half-cent sales tax measure for transportation improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard work!" said 84-year-old James C. Pierre of Santa Ana, after 
punching and turning in his nine-part ballot. Pierre, who has cast a ballot in 
every election since 1928, said he voted the straight Democratic ticket. "I 
think I did the right thing, but I don't know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Voters were sparse at Pierre's McFadden Street precinct, a low-income 
neighborhood where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by a margin of 10 
to 1. By 9:20 a.m., only 19 of the 586 registered voters, or 3%, had cast their 
ballots, a lower turnout than last year, poll workers said. 
</P>
<P>
In a Republican-dominated precinct in posh Huntington Harbor, however, nearly a 
dozen people were queued in front of the voting booths by 7:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very heavy turnout," said poll worker Joyce Friedemann, who expected 
this year's turnout to match the 70% average of previous years. 
</P>
<P>
As predicted, many voters of both parties in both precincts said they had voted 
against incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all a bunch of junk," said Joe Cannon of Huntington Beach, who said he 
voted against every incumbent on the ballot. "As far as I'm concerned, none of 
them are worth a nickel." 
</P>
<P>
Alphonso Moore, 56, said he saved his ire for members of the Santa Ana City 
Council, whom he faulted for failing to deliver on promises to repair city 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
"I voted against every one of them because they have been in too long . . . ," 
Moore said. "They sit there and talk with a split tongue, and that's all they 
do -- talk." 
</P>
<P>
Other voters found the ballot propositions so treacherous as to be ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
"We sat there after dinner last night trying to decipher what all this meant," 
complained Sandra Fishman of Capistrano Beach, who said she and her engineer 
husband studied their voter information kits for 4 1/2 hours and were stumped. 
"I simply couldn't figure out if it's what I wanted to vote for or not. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if we are going to get people to come out and vote, we are going to 
have to simplify the ballot so people can understand it." 
</P>
<P>
Polls will be open this evening until 8 p.m.

Mimi, the 17 1/2-pound lobster described as the Elizabeth Taylor of 
crustaceans, died of natural causes days after being shipped to her new home -- 
at a restaurant. She was between 20 and 100 years old, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Mimi, captured last week off the Maine coast and flown to Detroit, died in the 
tank at Carl's Chop House, which paid $320 for the huge lobster. 
</P>
<P>
"She had quit moving. I picked her up. She still didn't move," said Barry 
Hornecker, executive chef at Carl's. 
</P>
<P>
So he chilled and poached Mimi and began making plans for a feast. 
</P>
<P>
"Mimi was like Elizabeth Taylor. . . . She was always beautiful," said Jim 
Richards, owner of the Long Wharf Lobster Co. in Portland, Me., which flew the 
lobster to Detroit.

Heavily armed bandits seeking cash at a wealthy, isolated monastery wounded a 
monk in a gun battle with brothers who had taken up arms after a wave of 
robberies. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Pierre-Marie, abbot of the 19th-Century Trappist monastery Notre-Dame 
des Neiges, said a burglar alarm sounded at the monastery about 3 a.m. Monday, 
an hour before morning prayers. 
</P>
<P>
The bell signaled to the 36 monks, who produce 4 million bottles of wine a year 
on their immense estate in the Languedoc region of southern France, that they 
were being robbed for the third time this year. 
</P>
<P>
The monks have been organizing themselves as a self-defense force the last few 
weeks. In previous robberies, "the telephone lines were cut and we couldn't 
call for help," the abbot explained today. 
</P>
<P>
Arming themselves with shotguns, the brothers raced outside to a nearby 
administrative building where the alarm had sounded. 
</P>
<P>
One brother blasted a round into the air, flushing two masked men. They fled 
down the winding road to the monastery. 
</P>
<P>
The bandits found their way barricaded by a parked car -- and shotgun-toting 
Brother Zepherin, organizer of the monastery's hunting expeditions, who 
demanded they stop. 
</P>
<P>
The robbers pulled out a sawed-off shotgun and a semiautomatic pistol and 
opened fire on Brother Zepherin and other monks approaching in cars. 
</P>
<P>
The monks returned fire. 
</P>
<P>
Brother Zepherin fell with 200 pellets in his leg. 
</P>
<P>
The robbers got into a waiting car with one or two accomplices inside and sped 
off empty-handed, the abbot said. 
</P>
<P>
They were still at large today.

The Postal Service delivered about four-fifths of overnight mail on time in its 
first test by an outside consultant, a performance the postmaster general said 
today earns the agency a "low B." 
</P>
<P>
Mail intended for overnight delivery arrived on time 80.61% of the time during 
a three-month test period that ended in mid-September, the accounting firm of 
Price Waterhouse reported. 
</P>
<P>
"About as low a B as you can get, that's how I would characterize it," 
Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank said after the monthly meeting of the 
service's board of governors. 
</P>
<P>
While the national rating was just over 80%, performance varied widely from 
place to place, with larger cities such as New York "dragging down" the 
average. Overnight delivery of mail destined for the Big Apple was on time just 
46.94% of the time. Los Angeles fared better at 70.29%.

The economic gulf between the eastern and western parts of newly unified 
Germany is widening dramatically, according to new statistics issued today. 
</P>
<P>
The figures show that inflation is rising and umemployment is falling in the 
west, while joblessness is rising rapidly in the eastern part of the country. 
</P>
<P>
West German inflation rose 0.7% in October, bringing the cost of living 3.3% 
above its level one year ago. Separate figures for eastern Germany were not 
given. 
</P>
<P>
Unemployment in former East Germany jumped to 6.1% in October from 5% a month 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 537,800 former East Germans were unemployed, compared with 444,825 
in September, but workers on state-funded short-time work were steady at 1.77 
million. 
</P>
<P>
In former West Germany, unemployment continued to ease, falling to 6.5% from 
6.6% in September. The jobless number fell to 1.69 million from 1.73 million.

<P>
The special early retirement option for eligible managers begins Dec. 1, said

</P>
<P>
"To respond to the increasingly competitive telecommunications marketplace, we 
must continually introduce structural and operating efficiencies," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
Management employees working for BellSouth's regulated and unregulated 
companies will be offered the early retirement, which will include a special 
one-time payment to managers who agree to leave within a designated time frame

COMMODITY EXCHANGES WILL STAY IN NEW YORK; 
</P>
<P>
WALL STREET: THE FOUR HAD CONSIDERED MOVING TO NEW JERSEY IN WHAT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN A BLOW TO THE BIG APPLE.

Wall Street's four major commodity exchanges will remain in New York under a 
plan disclosed today by the chairmen of the exchanges, who had earlier 
threatened to leave the nation's financial center for New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement is a relief for the city, which has been battered by a flurry 
of layoffs on recession-ridden Wall Street over the last several months and is 
confronting an overall economic decline. 
</P>
<P>
The exchanges involved are the Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange Inc., 
established in 1882 and the world's leading market in those commodities; the 
Commodity Exchange Inc., established in 1933 and the world's most active metals 
market; the New York Cotton Exchange, established in 1870 and the world's only 
raw cotton and citrus market, and the New York Mercantile Exchange, established 
in 1872 and the world's dominant energy market. 
</P>
<P>
The four employ about 12,000 people, a figure that is expected to rise sharply 
in coming years as the markets battle for business with rival exchanges in 
Chicago and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
New York also is home to the New York and American stock exchanges, as well as 
headquarters of many of the nation's brokerage firms. 
</P>
<P>
The commodities exchanges, where options and futures for items such as gold, 
platinum, oil, coffee, cocoa, sugar and currencies are traded, are considered 
the hub of an industry that annually generates more than $1 billion in goods, 
services and salaries. 
</P>
<P>
The heads of the exchanges said they'll recommend to the membership that they 
move to a 1.2-million-square-foot building on a city-owned site two blocks 
north of their current home at the World Trade Center complex in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
They said the city has agreed to provide unspecified tax benefits and other 
forms of public support in exchange for their staying. 
</P>
<P>
The exchanges had considered moving to the Harborside Financial Center in 
Jersey City, N.J. Members of the exchanges will be asked to ratify the decision 
in December. If they fail to do so, the exchanges will remain at the World 
Trade Center.

When it comes to selling a brothel, the Internal Revenue Service has a few 
hang-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Condoms and paintings of bare-breasted women are OK at next week's tax sale of 
the Mustang Ranch. But dirty movies are out. 
</P>
<P>
Among the gaudier items to be sold when the auction of the 100-room bordello 
and its contents begins Nov. 13 are teddy bears, pajamas, sequined and 
feathered gowns and pocket-sized ceramic liquor bottles decorated with naked 
women. 
</P>
<P>
What's not for sale at America's best-known legal brothel is a small collection 
of porno flicks that were found in the purple, mirror-walled Orgy Room when the 
IRS seized the property Sept. 21 for $13 million in back taxes owed by Joe and 
Sally Conforte. 
</P>
<P>
"The IRS can't sell anything illegal," said Richard Flakus, chief collection 
agent in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
The defunct house of ill repute has sparked interest for use as a nursing home, 
a halfway house and a girls reform school, said Dierdre Pagni, an IRS manager. 
</P>
<P>
"A religious group expressed an interest as well," she said, declining to give 
details. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Bankruptcy Court trustee had hoped to operate the bordello and pay off 
its debts but came up against licensing and cash flow problems, and the IRS 
padlocked the place before it could reopen. It had operated as a legal bawdy 
house since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
The 50 or so ladies of the night who worked there since the IRS moved in have 
gone on to other ventures. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS hopes to earn at least $1.8 million when the property falls under the 
auctioneer's gavel. 
</P>
<P>
The beds won't be sold individually. They are attached to the floor and linked 
to other parts of the place via buzzers. 
</P>
<P>
But for those who want a little of Mustang's colorful history, there are signs 
posting service charges, Mustang Ranch matchbooks and complementary coupons. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the catalog is a music box from the suite used by the bordello manager. 
It plays "Somewhere My Love."

PATRIOTS WAIVE PERRYMAN, CITE MEDIOCRE GAMES

The New England Patriots have waived Robert Perryman, saying that the fullback 
had put in a mediocre performance in the seven games he played so far this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Perryman didn't handle the ball once in Sunday's 48-20 loss to the Philadelphia 
Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
He has also blocked poorly, though he turned in 15 catches for 88 yards. 
</P>
<P>
On the season, Perryman ran 32 times for 97 yards and one touchdown, a dramatic 
slide from last year. The Patriots, meanwhile, have slipped to a 1-7 record, 
worst in the league. 
</P>
<P>
The third-round draft choice from Michigan gained 187 yards as a rookie, 448 
yards in 16 starts in 1988 and 562 yards in 16 games, 14 of them starts, last 
year. He started 38 of his 49 games with New England. 
</P>
<P>
Perryman was rewarded with a four-year, $2.1-million contract worth $475,000 
this season, making him one of the NFL's highest-paid fullbacks. Patriots 
General Managar Patrick Sullivan said New England doesn't have to keep him on 
the payroll for the next 3 1/2 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a money-saving issue (to cut Perryman). It's a performance issue," he 
said.

The 18th-ranked Clemson Tigers have accepted an invitation to play in the Hall 
of Fame Bowl in Tampa, Fla., on New Year's Day, two newspapers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers, 8-2 under first-year Coach Ken Hatfield, will probably take on 
either Michigan or Illinois in the bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Bowl bids do not go out officially until Nov. 24. 
</P>
<P>
In opting for the Hall of Fame Bowl, the Tigers turned down a chance to play in 
the inaugural Blockbuster Bowl, which pays up to $1.4 million as opposed to $1 
million for the Hall of Fame. But other factors figured in Clemson's decision, 
according to both the News of Greenville and the State of Columbia. Clemson 
apparently wanted to play on New Year's Day and on national television. The 
Hall of Fame is on Jan. 1 and will be televised by NBC. The Blockbuster is on 
Dec. 28 and will be shown by Raycom.

Twelve members of a university lacrosse team were charged with misdemeanors in 
the death of a teammate who overdosed on alcohol during an alleged initiation.

The 12 were arrested Monday and charged by the McDonough County state's 
attorney's office with hazing and unlawful delivery of alcohol to a minor. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Haben, 18, of Oswego was found dead Oct. 19 in a Western Illinois 
University dormitory room. Officials said he was forced to drink a large 
quantity of alcohol. Authorities refused to say how much alcohol was involved. 
</P>
<P>
Haben died after he and other first-year players were led to a wooded area, 
swatted and encouraged to consume "rookie juice," a concoction that included 
beer, schnapps, coffee, tuna, eggs and hot dogs, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The 12 students were released after each posted $100 on $1,000 bonds.

He was released on personal recognizance bond, Murray said.

The misdemeanor is treated the same way as a traffic ticket Enos has 10 days to

"Everything I asked him he vehemently denied," said Clarence Underwood, 
Michigan State's assistant athletic director. "What he's accused of he's not

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: ANTIBIOTICS, BISMUTH FOUND HELPFUL IN TREATING ULCERS 
</P>

Question: I have been taking Tagamet for a couple of years to treat ulcers. 
Unfortunately, when I stop the medicine, my stomach soon starts to hurt and the 
ulcer returns. 
</P>
<P>
I remember reading something in your column about a new approach to curing 
ulcers. My doctor is skeptical. But if there is really a way to cure ulcers, 
I'd rather be done with them once and for all than take Tagamet for the rest of 
my life. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: A controversy over the causes of stomach ulcers has raged for several 
years. Many gastroenterologists doubted that ulcers could be infectious. 
However, a consensus is growing that many ulcers are due to bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
At the World Congress of Gastroenterology, Helicobacter pylori was recognized 
as a major cause of ulcers. Treating with acid-suppressing drugs such as 
antacids, Tagamet (cimetidine), or Zantac (ranitidine) can help heal the 
lesion, but ulcers return in up to 80% of patients when the medicine is 
discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
Treatment with antibiotics and bismuth (Pepto-Bismol) appears to be much more 
successful in eliminating the bug. Dr. Barry Marshall of the University of 
Virginia, quoted in Medical World News, says, "We think we have a cure for this 
bacterium and thus a cure for ulcer disease in probably 90% of patients." 
</P>
<P>
Q: I used to take tryptophan to help me get to sleep, especially when I 
traveled. Ever since the ban I have had to rely on non-prescription drugs, 
which I don't like as well. 
</P>
<P>
I am getting fed up with the government. It seems like a long time has gone by, 
and I haven't heard anything about the cause of the tryptophan problem. Will 
tryptophan become available again? 
</P>
<P>
A: We too are disappointed that the investigation of this problem has gone so 
slowly. Over a year ago the first reports of a rare blood disease called 
eosinophilia myalgia syndrome (EMS) came to the FDA's attention. People 
developed fatigue, fever and severe muscle pain, and some died. 
</P>
<P>
The outbreak was traced to l-tryptophan. Investigators have linked EMS to a new 
manufacturing process developed by one Japanese supplier, and the company has 
recently identified the component associated with the epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
We don't understand why the FDA has not kept the public better informed about 
its progress in this investigation. If contamination from a single source was 
the cause of the problem, it seems reasonable to expect that eventually 
tryptophan could be sold to the public again.

Actress Sarah Brightman was granted a divorce Monday from Andrew Lloyd Webber, 
composer of theatrical hits including "Cats" and "Aspects of Love." 
</P>
<P>
Judge Clive Callman granted the divorce, after six years of marriage, on the 
uncontested grounds that Lloyd Webber, 42, had committed adultery. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the divorce, Brightman, 30, is scheduled to take over the role of 
Rose in the Broadway production of "Aspects of Love." 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Webber has said he intends to marry his girlfriend, Madeleine Gurdon, as 
soon as the divorce is finalized, which usually takes up to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Lloyd Webber nor Brightman, his second wife, were in court for the 
hearing, which lasted less than a minute.

ISN'T ANDREW Lloyd Webber talking to lyricist Carole Bayer Sager about 
collaborating on his musical version of "Sunset Boulevard"? Yes, he is. 
</P>
<P>
And speaking of Carole, aren't she and her songwriter hubby, Burt Bacharach, in 
the marriage doldrums? He recently took off for a month. 
</P>
<P>
Now he is in and out of their house, but friends are extremely concerned about 
this famous couple. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens will give Carole new grist for her lyrics mill. She has said: 
"Fortunately, there is not a simple definition of what 'love' really is. If 
there were, I would not have any songs to write." 
</P>

TED TURNER, the Atlanta TV mogul, will be honored by the Friars Club in New 
York on April 13. And the hot rumor is that when Ted turns up at the Waldorf 
Astoria for his honor, he will be accompanied by exercise queen, Oscar-winning 
actress and new bride, Jane Fonda. Yes, Turner and Fonda are expected by many 
to be married by then. We'll see.

FIRST PEEKERS who have viewed the latest in the screen saga of Rocky Balboa, 
"Rocky V," are raving. They say it has all the qualities that made the original 
such a phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
These advance critics are also praising two new finds. One is Sylvester 
Stallone's handsome 13-year-old son, Sage, who plays his son in the film, and 
the other is 21-year-old heavyweight boxing contender Tommy Morrison, who 
portrays Rocky's protege. Everybody is saying young Morrison has real "star 
quality." Well, if he does, perhaps it's in his genes. Tommy is the grandnephew 
of screen legend John Wayne.

Drawings the late John Lennon made while he and Yoko Ono brought their peace 
protest to Canada are returning to the city for an exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
The one-month show at the Animation Gallery Ltd., which opens Nov. 9, includes 
the simple but sexually explicit line drawings from the Bag One Suite in a 
hotel where they camped in a protest of the bad things in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's Scotland Yard confiscated the drawings in 1970 for being 
pornographic. 
</P>
<P>
"And now we're in an age where Jesse Helms is trying to suppress all kinds of 
artwork, so nothing's really changed," says Ono, referring to the U.S. senator 
who blocked federal arts grants for an exhibit of photos by Robert 
Mapplethorpe. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what politicians think (about Lennon's art), but I know ordinary 
people are far more sophisticated and accepting of it," she said.

This year marks the 50th anniversary of the rock superstar's birth and the 10th

World track and field record-holders Butch Reynolds and Randy Barnes have been 
suspended for testing positive for steroids and could miss the 1992 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
The International Amateur Athletic Federation, the sport's world governing 
body, announced the suspensions Monday and said both athletes have been offered 
a hearing by The Athletics Congress, the U.S. national governing body. 
</P>
<P>
If the suspensions are upheld, Reynolds, holder of the 400-meter record, and 
Barnes, the shot put record-holder, could face two-year bans. Suspensions of 
that duration would keep them out of next year's World Championships at Tokyo 
and the 1992 Olympics at Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
The IAAF said recent tests confirmed that Reynolds tested positive for 
nandrolone and Barnes for methyltestosterone. Both substances are steroids. 
</P>
<P>
The IAAF statement said: 
</P>
<P>
"Randy Barnes was tested on Aug. 7, 1990, at the Malmo meeting in Sweden ... 
where he won the shot put event. 
</P>
<P>
"The Huddinge Laboratory in Sweden revealed metabolites of the banned substance 
methyltestosterone, and a second analysis carried out on Sept. 25, 1990, 
confirmed their presence. 
</P>
<P>
"The case was then investigated by the IAAF doping commission, who confirmed 
the positive result. 
</P>
<P>
"On Oct. 24, the IAAF informed TAC of the result of the second test and 
requested TAC to note the suspension of the athlete in accordance with IAAF 
Rule 59 and to offer the athlete an opportunity of a hearing in accordance with 
the rules and procedures of the IAAF. 
</P>
<P>
"TAC confirmed that this has been done, and the date of this hearing is 
expected to be fixed shortly." 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds, the IAAF said, "was tested on Aug. 12, 1990, at the Herculis meeting 
in Monte Carlo ... where he came third in the 400 meters. 
</P>
<P>
"The Paris laboratory revealed metabolites of the banned substance nandrolone, 
and a second analysis carried out on Oct. 12, 1990, confirmed their presence. 
</P>
<P>
"On Oct. 17, the IAAF informed TAC of the result of the second test and similar 
to the case(of Barnes) above, TAC have confirmed to the IAAF that Harry 
Reynolds has been suspended and offered a hearing, the date of which is shortly 
to be confirmed." 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds set the 400-meter record of 43.29 seconds at Zurich two years ago, and 
Barnes setthe shot put mark of 75 feet 10 1/4 inches last May 20 at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds was quoted as saying he wasn't concerned about flunking the test. 
</P>
<P>
In Monday's USA Today, Reynolds was quoted as saying: "Right now, there's a 
problem with the 'A' sample. I'm not worried. This is crazy. There are some 
formalities to go through." 
</P>
<P>
Under drug testing rules, an athlete's urine sample is divided into "A" and "B" 
samples. If the "A" sample is positive, the "B" is tested, with the athlete or 
a representative entitled to be present. 
</P>
<P>
If the "B" also is positive, the athlete is entitled to a hearing. If the "B" 
is negative, the athlete is exonerated. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had experts look at this," Reynolds told USA Today. "It can't be what 
they say it is." 
</P>
<P>
Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson recently finished a two-year suspension after 
testing positive for use of steroids following his victory in the 100 meters in 
the 1988 Olympics at Seoul. He was stripped of his world record and gold medal.
