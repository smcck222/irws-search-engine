</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two months ago, a frightened Linda Broderick confided to a friend that a bad 
situation was growing worse. 
</P>
<P>
The second wife of well-known attorney and doctor Daniel T. Broderick III, 
Linda had become accustomed to the constant, intrusive role Elisabeth 
Broderick, Daniel's first wife, played in her life. But now, she said, she was 
scared to death. 
</P>
<P>
"Books were disappearing from Linda's bedside stand, right next to the bed," 
said Marshall Hockett, a lawyer and friend of the newlyweds. "She indicated to 
me they were surprised by the ex-wife in the house one night. It scared the 
hell out of her, and she asked me to speak to Dan about it. I didn't, which 
I'll probably regret for the rest of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Early Sunday morning, Daniel and Linda Broderick were shot to death while they 
slept together in the upstairs master bedroom of their large, Colonial-style 
home in Hillcrest. 
</P>
<P>
This afternoon, Elisabeth Broderick is scheduled to be arraigned on two counts 
of murder. 
</P>
<P>
Police Lt. Gary Learn said Monday that Linda Broderick, 28, was shot twice, in 
the back of the head and the chest. She was found lying on her stomach in the 
bed, dressed in her pajamas. 
</P>
<P>
Learn said that Daniel Broderick, 44, sleeping in his boxer shorts, was shot 
once in the back. His body was found lying on the floor, and the lieutenant 
said it was possible that the force of the blast knocked his body off the bed. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the shootings apparently occurred about 5:30 a.m. Sunday. There was 
no sign of forced entry, and police confirmed that Elisabeth often entered the 
house unannounced, sometimes to visit two of her four children still being 
raised by Daniel. 
</P>
<P>
"She entered the bedroom," Learn speculated. "She was in a position in the room 
where she fired these shots, just standing adjacent to the bed and shooting 
over it. Now, as to the movements and who was shot first, we don't know yet. We 
may never know." 
</P>
<P>
He said that, besides the three shots that struck the couple, two more shots 
were fired, one hitting a bedside table and the other pounding into a wall 
beside the bed. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, before Elisabeth Broderick surrendered to police, authorities 
found her car in Pacific Beach. Inside, they found an empty .38-caliber, 
five-shot revolver, Learn said. He added that additional evidence was found at 
the suspect's condominium in La Jolla, but he declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night, Elisabeth Broderick was being held in the County Jail at Las 
Colinas. Her attorney, Ronald Frant, declined to comment on the case, but said, 
"She is OK, and she surrendered yesterday without any incident, voluntarily. 
She was cooperative, but she made no statements to law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
Those who knew Daniel and Elisabeth Broderick and were familiar with the hurt 
caused by their protracted divorce case indicated that it was often feared that 
their differences would end as Daniel Broderick had once predicted: "It's not 
going to end until one of us is gone." 
</P>
<P>
"This is not something that apparently happened overnight," said Robert W. 
Harrison, a defense attorney who knew all three of the Brodericks. 
</P>
<P>
"He was nothing but a shining star through and through, but in his world there 
was something that he did not have control over. It was like a specter hanging 
over him. 
</P>
<P>
Friends of Elisabeth Broderick described her as a woman scorned. After 16 years 
of marriage to Daniel Broderick, a pillar in the San Diego's legal and social 
community, she felt suddenly cast aside when their marriage unraveled. Raised 
in an affluent Catholic family in Connecticut, Elisabeth, 41, suddenly worried 
that she would no longer fit into what one friend called "the prim and proper 
Junior League type." 
</P>
<P>
Further frustrating to Elisabeth was the fact that her ex-husband, through his 
command of the law and influence in local legal circles, was able to obtain 
custody of their four children and court orders sealing their divorce records. 
</P>
<P>
Two friends, one close to Elisabeth, the other close to Daniel, said that 
Elisabeth had most recently been upset about not being able to see the two 
younger children on Halloween night. 
</P>
<P>
According to police and family acquaintances, the two preteen sons who were 
being raised by Daniel Broderick are now being cared for by close family 
friends, and two college-age daughters reportedly live away from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Friends of Daniel and Linda Broderick said their new life together was 
tormented by Elisabeth. They said that Daniel and Linda began a courtship only 
after Daniel and Elisabeth separated. Still, the friends said, Elisabeth 
continued to harass them, even as his career as a leading medical malpractice 
attorney grew. 
</P>
<P>
They recalled how she drove her car into his living-room window, how she told 
friends she was taking target practice with a handgun. The friends said that, 
before Daniel and Linda Broderick were married, Elisabeth stole their wedding 
guest list. And they said she was a familiar face at the courthouse, where she 
allegedly would deface the divorce court records wherever Linda's name 
appeared. 
</P>
<P>
Although the divorce case is closed to the public, the bitterness it engendered 
made headlines in an article in January in the Reader, a weekly newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
According to that article, Elisabeth sought more than $250,000 a year in 
alimony and child support payments from her ex-husband, who she said earned 
more than $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times on Monday, Gerald L. Barry Jr., who represented 
Daniel Broderick in the divorce, said that Elisabeth eventually was awarded 
$16,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
The divorce went to trial in December, 1988, four years after the case was 
first filed. In the midst of the legal proceedings, Daniel Broderick also 
obtained protective orders aimed at keeping Elisabeth away from his new family. 
According to the Reader, Elisabeth Broderick ignored some of those orders and 
was jailed for several days and fined thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Those who know Elisabeth said she remained bitter toward her ex-husband. One 
neighbor of Elisabeth and Daniel Broderick when they lived in La Jolla said 
local housewives were sympathetic to Elisabeth because it appeared she had been 
dumped for a younger woman. 
</P>
<P>
"It destroyed her," said the friend, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas once Elisabeth was a common fixture in La Jolla, driving her kids in 
the family van with the LODEMUP license plates, she felt like an outcast. 
</P>
<P>
"She gained a lot of weight," the friend said. "She used to be so gorgeous, 
always slim. That was the main thing. And, in La Jolla, it's not a pretty 
picture to be a divorced wife. You don't have any status. There's no place for 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn L. Huff, an attorney, described Elisabeth this way: "A very bright, 
intelligent person who felt considerable hurt and betrayal by the second 
marriage and, before that, by Dan's losing interest in her and gaining interest 
in another woman. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people are able to move on in life and take a constructive attitude. Some 
people are not. She was in the second group." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Whitney, an insurance agent who served with Elisabeth on the court-watching 
group, Help Abolish Legal Tyranny, remembered how she stood before their group 
six or eight months ago and described in detail how she felt Daniel Broderick 
had used his legal influence in the court system to beat her in the divorce. 
</P>
<P>
"She mentioned the original court date," Whitney said. "That Dan showed up in 
court, and that the judge said, 'Good morning, Mr. Broderick. To what do we owe 
this honor?' " 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Broderick's legal background was indeed impressive. With an 
undergraduate degree at Notre Dame, he went on to graduate from the Cornell 
University Medical College and to earn a law degree from Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
Admitted to the State Bar of California in 1973, he became an expert in medical 
malpractice cases. He represented the families of National Steel &amp; 
Shipbuilding workers killed and injured in a highly publicized crane accident. 
He represented the late Monte Kobey after the swap meet czar contracted AIDS 
from a blood transfusion. And he won a $1.25-million jury award this year for a 
girl who was sexually molested by her father. 
</P>
<P>
He also served in 1987 as president of the San Diego County Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Even as he grew more prominent, however, his colleagues and friends realized 
that his former marriage was "something that did not get better," said 
Harrison, the fellow attorney. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, according to Barry, his former lawyer, Daniel Broderick decided "he 
couldn't live life looking over his shoulder constantly. He had to look 
forward. It would have paralyzed him." 
</P>
<P>
Laurel Summers, a paralegal who had worked with Broderick, said, "Dan's major 
feeling about (Elisabeth) was that, if he acted in a rational, kind manner that 
she would come around and be that kind of person, too." 
</P>
<P>
Ned Huntington, another attorney and close friend, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"He recognized she was the mother of his children and really didn't take the 
strong measures he could have taken," he said. "It had gone on so long that Dan 
just adjusted to her craziness."

2 ANTI-ABORTION DEMONSTRATORS JAILED; BAIL INCREASED FOR APPEARANCE AT PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While their supporters sang hymns, two abortion protesters were jailed Monday 
after a judge increased their bail from $5,000 to $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, 36 other abortion protesters received varying sentences from 
San Diego Municipal Judge John Thompson on their guilty or no-contest pleas to 
misdemeanor offenses stemming from other demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
The all-day bail review hearing was held for Connie Youngkin, 41, of Poway and 
the Rev. Frank Smith, 56, of Oceanside, who were found guilty Sept. 13 of 
conspiracy to organize blockades for Operation Rescue anti-abortion 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
They were given jail terms last month but were allowed to remain free on bail 
pending appeal of their misdemeanor convictions. 
</P>
<P>
However, both were cited for being present during Operation Rescue's 
demonstration last month at an abortion clinic in La Mesa. A videotape of them 
at the protest was shown to the court. 
</P>
<P>
The judge noted the "potential for violence" at the La Mesa demonstration 
because of the presence of both pro and anti-abortion groups. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's lawyer, Greg Anthony, told the judge his client's actions posed "no 
risk to anybody," and his presence at the rally was protected by his First 
Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
Youngkin, who acted as her own lawyer, said she was at La Mesa to make "a 
political statement," not to break the law. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 36 protesters sentenced, 22 were given 10 days of public service, 13 
agreed to terms of two years' probation that forbids them from engaging in 
picketing with Operation Rescue and a $200 fine, and one agreed to perform 
volunteer work. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the 36 said before sentencing that they demonstrated against abortion 
because of their religious beliefs.

SAILORS HANG UP MITTS AFTER NAVY CRIES FOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A ban on sailors using a San Diego park threatens to disrupt an organized adult 
softball league that raises money for underprivileged and disabled youths. 
</P>
<P>
Blaming gang- and drug-related violence, Navy officials declared Southeast 
Athletic Field off-limits last week. But the area, as well as being an urban 
battleground, also serves 500 ballplayers of Sports America, a nonprofit group 
raising money to build a sports complex. 
</P>
<P>
Sailors have hung up their mitts because of the off-limits ban, and three games 
have been canceled so far, said Gary (Ike) Isakson, president of Sports 
America. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless there's some resolution, and quickly, this will force Sports America to 
close," said Isakson, a former center fielder with a Chicago White Sox 
minor-league team. The group has been unable to obtain permits to play in other 
parks, frequently crowded with Little League and other youth groups, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In its first year, Sports America raised $17,500. Of that money, $12,000 has 
paid for equipment and renting ball fields through next year, and $1,250 was 
donated to Southeast Recreation Council of San Diego to help organize sports 
for poor children, Isakson said. 
</P>
<P>
But Navy officials say the trouble-ridden park warrants a ban. After six months 
of investigation, officials concluded that the park, at 45th Street and Logan 
Avenue, and another one at South Mission Beach, known as the South Jetty, are 
too dangerous to permit sailors to use. On July 29, six sailors from a frigate 
were shot at by a gang in the Southeast Athletic Field. The sailors dived into 
a car and drove a block away, where the driver got out to inspect his car for 
damage -- not realizing that the gang was in hot pursuit. The sailor was shot 
in the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
The commanding officer of the frigate complained that his crew had survived 
deployment in the Philippines and the Western Pacific, only to be attacked in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally we put bans on places for selling drug paraphernalia -- this place 
sells rock cocaine every few feet," said Lt. Steve Rogers, a Navy attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not your basic place to throw Frisbees and walk your dog," said Cmdr. 
Doug Schamp, a Navy spokesman. "I'd rather explain to a guy why he can't play 
ball there than explain to the guy's mother why her son got shot." 
</P>
<P>
The Navy has asked Isakson to send them a letter about the softball league, 
Schamp said. Officials could exempt sailors from the ban for the specific 
purpose of playing in the league, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sailors say that, until the final call, they won't play ball. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Neiffer, a petty officer 1st class, said he doesn't believe the park is 
dangerous. In fact, when he plays, he usually takes his wife and children, ages 
19 months to 9 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The ban shocked me. It's sad -- I have no place to play now, and that was 
basically the only way I stay in shape," said Neiffer, who has lived in San 
Diego seven years. "We've got to honor the ban. I'm not going to jeopardize my 
career just to play softball."

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUPERVISORS OK FUNDS FOR ARMENIAN GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has voted to allocate more than $1 
million in federal refugee assistance grants to three Armenian relief agencies 
in Glendale and Hollywood. The Department of Health and Human Services grant 
will enable the private, nonprofit agencies to expand their English-language 
classes and to provide acculturation services to new emigres. 
</P>
<P>
The money was awarded to Los Angeles County by the health department in July, 
but allocation of the funds to specific agencies was contingent on board 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
County refugee service officials applied for the money in 1988, when more than 
19,000 Soviet Armenian refugees settled in Los Angeles County. More than 12,000 
additional Soviet emigres have settled in the county this year, county 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the grant, the Glendale-based Armenian Relief Society will 
receive $385,000, the Armenian Evangelical Social Service Center in Hollywood 
will receive $385,000, and the Western Diocese of the Armenian Church will 
receive $250,000. The money is expected to reach the service agencies within a 
month.

VOTERS TO DECIDE COUNCIL RACES, SANTA CLARITA ROAD MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAYERENE BARKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Clarita Valley voters will decide today whether to tax themselves to 
build roads, and voters elsewhere in northern Los Angeles and eastern Ventura 
counties will take part in elections for seats on 21 school and community 
college district boards and three city councils. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial Santa Clarita Valley tax initiative, Measure P on the ballot, 
would raise up to $275 million over 40 years for roads in the fast-growing 
valley. The measure, which would raise most homeowners' annual tax bills by $75 
to $200, requires a two-thirds vote for passage. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the measure would create a giant assessment district, known as a 
Mello-Roos district after the state legislators who wrote the law providing for 
their creation. In this case, the district would be administered by the Santa 
Clarita Road Financing Authority, a joint agency to be formed by Santa Clarita 
and Los Angeles County officials. 
</P>
<P>
The tax would be levied in an area lying roughly within the boundaries of the 
William S. Hart Union High School District. Residents of the rural community of 
Val Verde and senior citizens would be exempt. 
</P>
<P>
Measure P has pitted neighbor against neighbor. Although some residents have 
said they will vote against the measure because they oppose any new taxes, 
other opponents have said they will not tax themselves to build roads in areas 
far removed from their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Measure P, say opponents, will benefit Canyon Country and Saugus at the expense 
of the better-planned communities of Newhall and Valencia. More roads will pour 
unwanted traffic onto Valencia's well-planned streets, said one resident. 
</P>
<P>
"Valencia, Newhall -- we don't have a problem there," said Tamsie Irvan, a 
member of Stop Mello-Roos Tax, an organization formed to oppose the measure. 
"All they want to do is siphon traffic through us." 
</P>
<P>
The Chamber of Commerce in Castaic also opposes the tax. 
</P>
<P>
But supporters of the measure say the tax ultimately will benefit all motorists 
in the area because traffic is a valleywide problem. Measure P is a quick way 
to improve movements on the clogged system of roads in the valley, said Lou 
Garasi, a member of the Roads Now Committee, which has spearheaded the campaign 
for the tax. 
</P>
<P>
A study by the Southern California Assn. of Governments predicts the valley 
will need $340 million in road improvements to prevent gridlock by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clarita Valley and Canyon Country chambers of commerce, as well as 
Sheriff Sherman Block and the Los Angeles County Assn. of Firefighters, have 
endorsed the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Measure P proponents -- who raised $86,000, according to campaign-spending 
reports -- sent a last-minute mailing to 20,000 households. The area has about 
68,000 registered voters. The Roads Now Committee said 30 volunteers will staff 
phone banks at election headquarters today to try to encourage voters to go to 
the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of the opposition group, which raised about $1,900, said they 
would take the day off from work to telephone voters. 
</P>
<P>
In Agoura Hills, a political action group largely credited with electing 
Darlene McBane, Fran Pavley and Jack W. Koenig to the Agoura Hills City Council 
in 1985, endorsed McBane and Pavley for reelection last week but withheld 
support from Koenig. The group, For Agoura '89, endorsed challenger Ed Kurtz 
instead. Paul G. (Gary) Mueller and Barry S. Steinhardt also are candidates for 
the three available seats. 
</P>
<P>
In neighboring Westlake Village, six candidates are running for three seats on 
the City Council. Incumbent council members Bonnie Klove and Irwin A. Shane are 
seeking reelection against challengers James E. Emmons, Sybil Nisenholz, Joanne 
Robinson and Douglas R. Yarrow. Emmons, city manager from 1982 to 1988, is 
considered a strong contender. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen candidates are vying for a seat vacated by Lee Laxdal in Thousand 
Oaks. Running for the remainder of Laxdal's four-year term, which expires in 
1992, are Grant W. Peterson, Gregory Lance Spencer, Jim Donovan, Phyllis L. 
Ellis, Bob Lewis, Elois Zeanah, K. Reed Harrison, Charles E. Rittenburg, Frank 
R. Lussier, Gary Tarnowski, Timothy J. Curtiss, Patrick Kellogg and Norm 
(Blackie) Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of candidates are running for school boards in the Ventura County, Santa 
Clarita Valley and Antelope Valley community college districts, and the Conejo 
Valley, Las Virgenes, Moorpark, Oak Park, Newhall, Saugus, Soledad-Agua Dulce, 
Hughes-Elizabeth Lake, Castaic, Sulphur Springs, Lancaster, Palmdale, Wilsona, 
Eastside, Westside, Keppel and Antelope Valley Union High school districts. 
</P>
<P>
Four candidates are competing for three seats on the five-member Ventura County 
Board of Education.

ROCKWELL LISTS 12 RADIOACTIVE RELEASES AT LAB IN LAST 20 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minor releases of radioactive material have accidentally occurred 12 times 
during the last 20 years at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory west of 
Chatsworth, according to a report Rockwell International submitted Monday to 
the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell filed the report in response to an order from NRC Administrative Law 
Judge Peter Bloch, who asked the company for a list of all spills, fires or 
other events since 1969 that involved radioactive releases at the test site in 
the Simi Hills, where Rockwell has done nuclear work for the federal government 
for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
In an affidavit filed with the report, a Rockwell official said the 12 
incidents "plus releases prior to 1969 account for all areas" at Santa Susana 
that have been contaminated by radioactive material. The majority of nuclear 
work at the site occurred before 1969, and thus was not covered by Bloch's 
request. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most recent events was an October, 1986, fire that occurred while a 
nuclear fuel rod was being sawed apart in the heavily shielded "hot lab" at 
Santa Susana. Rockwell said a small amount of radioactivity was released to 
high efficiency air filters at the hot lab. 
</P>
<P>
The list also included the loss in April, 1986, of a small quantity of 
strontium-90 in a sealed radiation source, which Rockwell said was "probably 
disposed as radioactive waste" inadvertently during cleanup work. 
</P>
<P>
One release was listed as "current": the leakage of radioactive tritium into 
ground water at Building 59, which formerly housed a nuclear reactor. The low 
tritium readings were found by an Environmental Protection Agency survey team 
last summer following repeated statements by Rockwell that no evidence of 
radioactive pollution of ground water existed at the site. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell had not tested ground water near the building for tritium, and has 
been criticized by the EPA and others for failing to adequately monitor for 
radioactivity. 
</P>
<P>
Bloch, who will rule on Rockwell's request to renew the nuclear materials 
license for Santa Susana's "hot lab," first asked Rockwell in September for a 
list of all radioactive releases since 1969 "producing anything other than 
trivial results that are very unlikely to cause any detriment to anyone's 
health." 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell responded that there had been no events which met that description, 
since no releases had occurred during the 20-year period that exceeded NRC 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in a second order dated Oct. 4, Bloch requested a list of all releases, 
no matter how trivial. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 12 events cited in its report, Rockwell said it had erred in failing to 
disclose one in its response to Bloch's original request. 
</P>
<P>
This was a 1977 incident in which more than 2,000 gallons of water contaminated 
by radioactivity leaked from a storage pit. Rockwell said soils contaminated by 
the leak were cleaned up, but did not say if ground water was contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell officials refused to answer questions Monday or comment on the report. 
"The list stands on its own," said company spokesman Paul Sewell. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Raskin, a Northridge resident and intervenor in the license case, said 
he got his copy of the report Monday and had not had time to study it. He said 
the radioactive releases seemed small, but questioned the completeness of 
Rockwell's records. 
</P>
<P>
Bloch would not comment on the list, but said Rockwell's performance is of less 
importance now that the firm has greatly scaled back its license request. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell had sought a 10-year renewal of its NRC license in hopes of attracting 
new Department of Energy contracts to declad nuclear fuel -- work that involves 
taking apart fuel rods and removing radioactive uranium and plutonium for use 
at U.S. weapons production sites. 
</P>
<P>
But with almost no current business for the hot lab and vigorous community 
opposition, Rockwell announced two weeks ago that it wanted only a one-year 
license renewal to complete a few current projects and decommission the hot 
lab. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Susana, operated by Rockwell's Rocketdyne division in Canoga Park, was 
once a major nuclear testing and development site for the DOE and its 
predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission. From the mid-1950s to the early 
1980s, 16 small nuclear reactors operated there, and fuel fabrication and 
decladding work was also performed up to 1986. Since then, most of the nuclear 
work has involved cleaning up contamination from past activity. 
</P>
<P>
A DOE report released last May said chemical and radioactive pollution exists 
in several areas of the site, but mostly at low levels. Officials with the DOE 
and state and federal environmental agencies have since said the contamination 
poses no immediate threat to neighbors.

Photo, Unruffled feathers -- Hundreds of songbirds perch on wires near Pierce 
College, all facing the same way. "Birds like to face into the wind," said 
Kimball Garrett, collection manager for ornithology at the Natural History 
Museum of Los Angeles County. "It keeps their feathers from getting ruffled. 
And it probably makes it slightly easier for them to spring into flight, just 
like planes." Rather than peer pressure, Garrett said, they're all responding 
to the same environmental stimulus. JOEL P. LUGAVERE / Los Angeles Times

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SMALL FIRE FORCES EVACUATION OF SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A small electrical fire in a classroom at La Canada Elementary School forced 
evacuation of the school Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries among the 600 students or staff members and the blaze 
was extinguished in 20 minutes, said Los Angeles County Fire Department Capt. 
Harry Thy. 
</P>
<P>
The fire began when a neon light fixture overheated in a 12-inch space between 
the ceiling and roof, Thy said. 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department was called after second-grade teacher Christa Peitzman 
noticed smoke pouring through a light fixture. She was alone at the time, 
preparing for class, and the students were attending a meeting in the assembly 
hall. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials estimated damage at $15,000 for the structure and $5,000 for 
walls, carpet and contents of the classroom.

ATTORNEY, WIFE SENTENCED IN FRAUD SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Agoura Hills attorney convicted of stealing more than $340,000 from an 
insurance company that helped put him through law school was sentenced in 
federal court Monday to a year in prison and ordered to repay the unrecovered 
portion of the money. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors said Steven Segall, 36, and his wife, Andrea Segall, 
defrauded CIGNA Insurance Co. for more than 3 1/2 years by using phony billings 
for paralegal work that was never done. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Segall, who pleaded guilty to five counts of mail fraud in August, could 
have been fined $250,000 and sentenced to five years in prison on each count, 
said Gary Austin, a U. S. postal inspector. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. District Judge William Matthew Byrne Jr., also sentenced Segall to serve 
five years probation after his release. 
</P>
<P>
Andrea Segall, 31, pleaded guilty in August to one count of mail fraud. She was 
sentenced by Byrne to five years probation and ordered to perform 350 hours of 
community service. 
</P>
<P>
The Segalls, who have two children, are both responsible for repaying $254,000 
to CIGNA. The company has already recovered $86,000, which federal 
investigators found in the couple's various bank accounts, Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
Until he was fired in August, 1988, Steven Segall worked for 10 years for 
Childers and Dickinson, a Universal City law firm under contract to CIGNA, 
Austin said. The insurance company helped pay Segall's way through law school 
at Cal State Northridge, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Segalls set up a phony company, called Legal Research, to bill the 
insurance firm for paralegal work and received payments from CIGNA at the 
address of Andrea Segall's mother, Agnes Dora Spiegel, 70, of Encino. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators traced $9,000 to Spiegel, but they could not determine whether 
she was part of the scheme, which was uncovered in a routine company audit, 
Austin said. Spiegel was not charged. 
</P>
<P>
Austin said the Segalls used the stolen money to buy bigger and better homes. 
When the scheme started in 1985, the couple lived in a $167,000 house in 
Northridge, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Three years and two houses later, they were living in an Agoura Hills home they 
purchased for $507,000. The Segalls sold that home in January for $830,000, 
Austin said.

NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST FOUND FOR BURBANK COUNCILMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Fair Political Practices Commission has advised the city of Burbank that 
Councilman Thomas E. Flavin does not have a conflict in voting on issues 
affecting the Walt Disney Co., which pays an annual $1,000 membership fee to 
the nonprofit organization that employs Flavin. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Michioku, a commission spokeswoman, said Monday that Flavin may 
participate in City Council decisions regarding Burbank's proposed Media 
District Specific Plan, which could affect Disney's development plans. Disney 
owns and operates studios and corporate offices in the district, a 1.2-square 
mile area in the southwest corner of Burbank and composed mostly of motion 
picture and television studios. 
</P>
<P>
Michioku said Disney's membership fee in the Economic Development Corp. of Los 
Angeles County, of which Flavin is executive vice president, is not considered 
a source of income to the councilman. The development corporation's main 
function is to assist county businesses in attaining financial assistance for 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank City Atty. Juli Scott said her office requested the advice from the 
commission in July on Flavin's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Flavin said Monday, "I didn't expect that there would be any conflict, but I 
just wanted to be sure." 
</P>
<P>
Burbank is considering the adoption of a Media District Specific Plan as an 
element of the city's general plan. The specific plan is to set strict design 
standards regulating development by the studios and other property owners.

ORLANDO GETS BIT OF MAGIC, BEATS KNICKS

<DATELINE>
<P>
ORLANDO, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The expansion Orlando Magic got its first-ever NBA victory Monday night, 
winning in its second game by beating the defending Atlantic Division champion 
New York Knicks, 118-110. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Theus scored 24 points and Jerry Reynolds and Terry Catledge each added 
19 for the Magic. Orlando broke a 94-94 tie by outscoring the Knicks, 12-2, and 
stayed in front by making 10 consecutive free throws in the final 1:33. 
</P>
<P>
A sellout of 15,077 -- the same crowd that saw the Magic lose its opener to New 
Jersey -- watched Orlando stay close all night. The Knicks, who got 29 points 
from Patrick Ewing, never led by more than three points. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Wilkins scored 21 and Johnny Newman had 19, including a three-point shot 
that trimmed the Magic's advantage to 110-107 with 32 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks (1-2) were hurt nine seconds later when Newman was called for a 
breakaway foul. Theus hit two free throws and Orlando retained possession of 
the ball. 
</P>
<P>
The Magic, 2-6 in the exhibition season including a victory over the Detroit 
Pistons, pulled away during a four-minute stretch midway through the fourth 
quarter.

<P>
San Diego State (14-4-3) will play UCLA (16-3-1) in a first-round NCAA 
tournament match at 2 p.m. Sunday at El Camino Community College. The Aztecs 
are ranked 17th and UCLA is third in the Intercollegiate Soccer Assn. of 
America poll. This is the third consecutive season the Aztecs have been invited 
to the NCAA tournament. Last season, SDSU was defeated by UCLA in the first 
round, 2-1. In 1987, SDSU lost to Clemson in the championship game.

Larry Dixon of San Diego edged former 139-pound world champion Igor Ruzhnikov 
of the Soviet Union in the USSR-USA Heavyweight Boxing Invitational on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The invitational featured the top six weight classes in amateur boxing. 
</P>
<P>
The victory by Dixon, 21, America's third-ranked amateur in the 147-pound 
class, was one of two 3-2 decisions on the 10-bout card. It pulled the USA team 
into a 3-3 tie, but the Soviets swept the next three fights and won the card

CLU KICKER TOES THE LINE AFTER INSPIRED SPEECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was right out of the movie "Knute Rockne: All American." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Maw was at a team meeting the day before the final game of his senior 
season listening to Tom Farmer, an alum who played for Cal Lutheran in the 
early 70's, tell how he once slipped out of the hospital in a malarial fever to 
suit up for a Kingsmen game. 
</P>
<P>
Maw, who severely lacerated two fingers carving a pumpkin before Halloween, had 
been told by his doctor to skip the last game of his collegiate career because 
of the possibility of infection. But after hearing Farmer, Maw decided his 
injury shouldn't keep him from kicking against Azusa Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
With his left hand so heavily wrapped that only the tip of his thumb showed, 
Maw was flawless on three conversions to help Cal Lutheran to a 21-17 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Fann-tastic: Albert Fann of Cal State Northridge Monday was selected offensive 
player of the week in the Western Football Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Fann, a junior from Cleveland High, rushed for 251 yards and two touchdowns in 
28 carries on Saturday to carry CSUN to a 24-13 victory over Cal State 
Sacramento. Fann's effort fell a yard shy of Tom Bonnell's Northridge record 
for rushing yards in a game set in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
The record probably would have fallen had Fann been given another carry with 
CSUN running out the clock. The Matadors got the ball for the last time with 
2:03 left, but reserve Lance Harper carried on CSUN's final three plays. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his rushing total, Fann had 58 yards receiving, 41 yards in 
kickoff returns and completed a 31-yard pass. Fann leads the WFC with 1,195 
yards rushing, but, with one game left to play, he's still 370 yards shy of 
Mike Kane's CSUN single-season record. 
</P>
<P>
Improbable? Yes. But considering his performance on Saturday, perhaps not 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Miller time: Jerry Miller, Cal Lutheran's president, was conspicuous in his 
absence from Cal Lutheran's season finale against Azusa Pacific. Miller is a 
key player in the decision as to whether Bob Shoup will return as Kingsmen 
coach next season or in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters searched for Miller at Saturday's game before finding that he had 
pulled off a nifty end-around. He was reportedly in Palm Springs for a business 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Title game: In a way, Northridge is right where it wanted to be going into its 
final game of the season. The Matadors are playing in the game that will decide 
the Western Football Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the Matadors, win or lose, the title won't be theirs. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Utah State upset Portland State, the WFC's two-time defending 
champion, earlier this season and needs a win against CSUN to earn a share of 
the conference title. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge needs a victory for its fourth consecutive winning season. 
</P>
<P>
Correction: While Valley College defeated Pierce for the third time in a row on 
Saturday, the Monarchs still trail, 14-9, in the series between the rival 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Ground force: Valley's victory against Pierce was its third in a row and fourth 
in the last five games after the Monarchs started the season 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
The emergence of a potent rushing attack has been the key to Valley's rise. 
</P>
<P>
After rushing for only 101 yards in the first three games, Valley has gained 
more than 200 yards a game in its last five. 
</P>
<P>
"I said at the start of the season that we'd be a team to reckon with in 
divisional play," Coach Chuck Ferrero said. "It just took us a while to get 
some experience." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrero also credits consistent play on the offensive line. Early in the 
season, Ferrero never knew which linemen were going to practice because of 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"We're beat up just like everyone else is at this stage of the season," Ferrero 
said. "But it's constant. We're not shuffling guys in and out like before." 
</P>
<P>
The emergence of Cliff Robinson, a former standout at L. A. Baptist High, 
hasn't hurt, either. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson rushed for 107 yards in 17 carries against Pierce and has gained 240 
yards in the last two games. A thigh bruise that sidelined Allen Moore for the 
last two games has given Robinson some time to shine. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a coach's guy," Ferrero said of the 5-foot-6, 160-pound Robinson. "He 
does everything you ask of him. He listens to you and he doesn't complain. He 
didn't carry the ball once in the first three games and yet, I never heard him 
complain. He just kept practicing harder and getting better." 
</P>
<P>
One-man gang: Moorpark linebacker Raymund Mosones seemed to always be around 
the ball Saturday during the Raiders' 47-27 victory over Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Mosones, a sophomore, intercepted a pass for a touchdown, batted down another 
pass, recovered a fumble that led to a Moorpark score and had several tackles 
for losses. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Mosones was at a loss to explain his touchdown run, during which he 
rambled 11 yards then vaulted into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taught to run to the sidelines," Mosones said. "I don't know why I did 
it. I just sort of did it."

Robbins Resigns: Noted choreographer Jerome Robbins will resign as co-director 
of the New York City Ballet on Jan. 1. Robbins, 71, plans to continue writing 
his memoirs and to develop an autobiographical theater piece. "It's important 
at my age to do other things. I'm resigning from the New York City Ballet; I'm 
not retiring from the field," said Robbins, who has worked with the City Ballet 
since 1949. Though he's stepping down as co-director, Robbins is due soon to 
begin rehearsals at the City Ballet for a retrospective of his ballets since 
1944. The Robbins festival is scheduled to be presented next spring. Peter 
Martins, the City Ballet's other co-director, will be solely responsible for 
the company's artistic policy after Robbins' resignation becomes effective. 
Robbins also is considering working in Europe. ALEENE MacMINN

Picasso Artworks Stolen: The granddaughter of famed artist Pablo Picasso has 
been robbed of art works valued at $17 million in what French police call one 
of the biggest art thefts ever. Police declined to reveal the exact number or 
titles stolen Sunday from Marina Picasso's villa in Cannes, but did confirm 
that they included two paintings by Henri Matisse, a bust by Auguste Rodin and 
some works by her grandfather. The break-in took place while Picasso was on 
vacation in Megeve and a housekeeper was out shopping. Picasso returned to 
Cannes on Monday but declined to speak to reporters who had gathered at her 
three-story villa. Picasso inherited the works from her grandfather, who died 
in 1973. ALEENE MacMINN

Operatic Bribes: Officials of Italy's famed La Scala opera charged Monday the 
company's just-concluded tour of the Soviet Union was a "bureaucratic inferno" 
of bribery and corruption and called for the Italian government to lodge an 
official protest. Alberto Rispoli, secretary-general of La Scala, said it was 
"a miracle" the company was able to stage all its performances during the Oct. 
2-Nov. 4 tour in Moscow and Leningrad. "Every day we had to deliver something 
under the table for being allowed to work," Rispoli said. However, officials 
declared the incidents would not hamper relations with the Soviets and that 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will be welcome to visit La Scala during his 
Nov. 29-Dec. 1 trip to Italy. ALEENE MacMINN

Bay Area All-News Channel: A network affiliate and a public television station 
in San Francisco are talking about joining forces to create the first all-news 
channel operated by local stations in the United States. KRON-TV, an NBC 
affiliate, and public television station KQED would like to launch Bay News 
Center in March. It would focus on regional news. The KQED board of directors 
is expected to vote Dec. 7 on the proposal. KQED Inc. owns both Channel 9, on 
which it broadcasts, and the UHF Channel 32, currently on the air as KQEC, a 
part-time sister station to Channel 9. The plan is to use Channel 32 for the 
news station. ALEENE MacMINN

A RUTHIAN CLOUT FOR THE GRAND OLD GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that the baseball season has ended, it's time to talk . . . baseball. 
</P>
<P>
To use sportsspeak, "Forever Baseball" can do it all. Airing at 9 tonight on 
Channels 28 and 15 as part of "The American Experience" on PBS, it's the Babe 
Ruth or Willie Mays of its genre, arguably the best TV program on baseball 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
And, happily, it offers not a single word from a modern player, manager or 
owner. That comes during the season. 
</P>
<P>
After the World Series was interrupted by the Bay Area's recent devastating 
earthquake, the common refrain was: "This puts baseball in context." Wrong. 
This program puts baseball in context -- a lyrical, exhilarating hour using 
wonderful bits of history, old clips and insights from literati to show the 
game's uniqueness in American culture. 
</P>
<P>
Television not only has dramatically changed the economic structure of baseball 
but also has made players seem less heroic through constant exposure. But the 
game's essence remains unaltered. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball is more than America's enduring cliche; it's also America's song. The 
crack of the bat can't be described or explained, it must be heard. And it has 
been heard for 150 years. Producer-writer-narrator Irv Drasnin dusts off a 
quote: "I see great things in baseball. It's our game -- the American game." 
The words are Walt Whitman's. 
</P>
<P>
When troops from the North and South weren't fighting the Civil War, they 
sometimes played baseball. When Custer was being annihilated, somewhere else in 
America people were playing baseball. 
</P>
<P>
It's this historical view -- and the perception of baseball as the nation's 
common denominator -- that makes Drasnin's video essay an upper-deck shot that 
clears the bases. 
</P>
<P>
We see baseball as symbolic: It starts in the spring, a time for renewal. 
Baseball is now universal, not only geographically, but demographically: "Hit 
it right" applies to performance in all areas of life. There is also the 
learned baseball behavior, ingrained since youth. As Drasnin notes: "There is a 
way to talk, a way to stand, a way to move, and when the ball comes at you, a 
way to make it look easy." Yes, and we daydream about it throughout our lives. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball transcends age. Painter Ralph Fasanella, 75, on his newspaper 
priorities: "This morning there are two important things, Poland and China, but 
I gotta go to baseball first." 
</P>
<P>
The game transcends gender. Journalist-historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, on 
absorbing baseball from her father, for whom she kept score on Brooklyn Dodgers 
games: "I felt like I was learning the wisdom of the ages from him." 
</P>
<P>
Big-time baseball didn't always transcend race, however; indeed, it was a 
metaphor for segregation, as Drasnin recalls in an insightful sequence 
comparing the fortunes of Bob Feller and Satchel Paige. 
</P>
<P>
There is extraordinary archival footage here, too -- of the 1905 Giants, of the 
Babe demonstrating his swing to young players, of Lou Gehrig playing a cowboy 
in a movie. 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, "Forever Baseball" defines a game that is hopeful, a game whose 
finality, unlike basketball and football, is not governed by a clock, a game 
that offers the possibility of miracles along with heartbreak. 
</P>
<P>
What grand stuff, a program that hits it right. Break out the Cracker Jack.

'RACE FOR GLORY' FAILS TO GET INTO GEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The motorcycle racing footage in the new movie "Race for Glory" (citywide) was 
shot at Grand Prix events in Paris, Belgium and Yugoslavia and while it's 
fairly colorful, exciting stuff, it doesn't have quite the charge the movie 
makers obviously intended. 
</P>
<P>
It's a film that could use some charge, a conventional male-bonding fable about 
two small-town guys, a tyro racer and his mechanic, who wind up, improbably, on 
the European Grand Prix circuit -- a story revved up with every crisis, every 
cliche, every collision standard to the genre. 
</P>
<P>
The director, Rocky Lang, who also wrote the original story, spent five years 
nurturing this project through the system before making it independently. But, 
since many of the other movies being made five years ago had pretty much the 
same story -- the buddies together, the goal, the prize, the heinous villains, 
the sweetheart, the last-minute mano-a-mano duel -- it's hard to see how any 
executives reading it wouldn't suffer from deja vu. 
</P>
<P>
Here, daredevil biker Cody Gifford (Alex McArthur) and super-mechanic Chris 
Washburn (Peter Berg) are hired by the Japanese corporation, Samurai, after a 
spectacular dirt-track performance and, with eerie inevitability, they go head 
to head with a mean German world champion named Klaus. 
</P>
<P>
Since their cycle is spattered with stars and stripes and is dubbed "American 
Built" and their major adversaries are German and Japanese -- the Italians are 
affable and ineffectual -- there's little doubt the climax is supposed to carry 
a chauvinistic kick. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it doesn't, though director Lang doesn't stint on the melodrama, the hoopla 
or the blarney. The lead actors -- McArthur, Berg and Pamela Ludwig -- all have 
nice presence, and Lang and cinematographer Jack N. Green give it a lucid, 
clear style. But "Race for Glory" (MPAA rated R for sex and language) is like 
every other success-mad ultra-formula '80s fable.

'MYSTICAL OBJECTS, SACRED PLACES' ON DISPLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE McKENNA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whether the world seems like too much to handle or not quite enough, 
spirituality is one of the devices that allows us to adjust it to a tolerable 
volume. Investing the unseen with palpable power and organizing consciousness 
into a coherent, manageable system, the idea that the universe is governed by 
forces greater than those possessed by man has been central to every major 
civilization in history. Just how compelling an idea it is can be seen in the 
fact that the sacred relics of various cultures -- Stonehenge, Easter Island, 
the Mayan ruins at Palenque -- continue to resonate with a mystery and magic 
that's made them a reference point in much contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
In "Mystical Objects, Sacred Places," an exhibition on view through Nov. 26 at 
Security Pacific's Gallery at the Plaza, 11 American artists attempt to tap 
into humankind's psychic past via modern artworks exploring ancient spiritual 
systems. It's a moving idea for a show, and "Mystical Objects" takes on added 
poignancy in its' struggle to be heard in the bustling lobby of a corporate 
high rise. It's hard to imagine a setting less conducive to the kind of 
reflection this work attempts to engender, but a valiant effort is made, and 
some of the work is solid enough to transcend the setting. 
</P>
<P>
It's not surprising that the strongest work in the show is also the most 
simple. The central theme here is so rich and grand that to be ostentatiously 
"creative" would be gilding the lily. Consequently, the straight photography by 
Marilyn Bridges, Macduff Everton and Grey Crawford walks off with top honors. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey artist Bridges is a pilot-photographer who takes stunning aerial 
shots of sites that have held people in thrall for centuries -- Greek temples, 
the Pyramids at Giza, Stonehenge. She also includes a shot of the Manhatten 
skyline's Chrysler Building, suggesting that all us networking maniacs are 
living among the ruins of tomorrow. Everton shoots lusciously colored panoramic 
landscapes illuminated with an eerie light that lends them a supernatural 
quality, while Crawford's black and white images focus on holy sites and 
hieroglyphs. A shot of a disturbing stone formation in England looks as though 
it might've been the setting for the Peter Weir film "Picnic at Hanging Rock." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Felix, Ian Green and Charles Pebworth explore the belief systems of the 
Indian cultures of the American Southwest. Green's mixed media pieces, 
artificially aged to resemble scavenged relics, read as sad memento mori to the 
tragic history of the American Indian rather than the simple dignity of their 
religious beliefs. Felix's mixed media valentines to the spirit of the 
Southwest -- sometimes constructed in the manner of Japanese screens -- are too 
tricky by half; his work feels busy and craftsy. Pebworth's small, impeccably 
crafted totems made of metal and semi-precious stones are so beautiful they go 
beyond being about religious fetishism -- they become the thing itself. 
</P>
<P>
Patterned after the homages to imploding consciousness perfected by Joseph 
Cornell, Janice Lowry makes glassed in wooden memory boxes jammed with the 
collected ephemera of a lifetime -- antique toys, cut-outs, and souvenirs. Jo 
Whalley photographs old santos figures positioned in the foreground of haunted 
landscapes, and reminds us with these battered relics of Catholicism that 
suffering is central to many spiritual traditions. The lurid landscapes of 
George Green (they put one in mind of work by Green's fellow Texan John 
Alexander) employ the bright colors and symbols associated with Mexican folk 
art to create a malevolent view of nature; in Green's world of hysterical 
anthropomorphism, the flora and fauna is strangling and over-ripe. Also on view 
is work by Christopher Tanner who paints on animal bones, and photographs by 
Laura Parker that involve fragments of ancient relics arranged on a backdrop of 
sand. 
</P>
<P>
All told, "Mystical Objects" does a good job of drawing our attention to the 
feelings of pity, fear and awe that are central to many spiritual systems, 
however, the emotion of ecstasy -- the big pay-off in many religions -- is in 
surprisingly short supply here.

A MINI-BAND WITH MAJOR TALENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maynard Ferguson has been justifiably well-known for his high-note trumpet 
playing for nearly four decades. But the latter part of his career has been 
equally significant for his ability to assemble impressive- sounding big bands. 
</P>
<P>
The group he brought to the Strand in Redondo Beach on Sunday night may have 
been a bit smaller than some he has had over the years, but it swung as hard as 
any. Dubbed the Big Bop Nouveau Band, the nine-piece ensemble consisted of two 
saxophone players, two trumpeters, a trombonist and three rhythm -- with 
Ferguson's piercing horn occasionally joining the brass section. 
</P>
<P>
Although he took advantage of a few opportunities to display his 
still-spectacular high note technique, Ferguson's solo spots were brief and to 
the point. For the most part, his role was that of musical paterfamilias, 
corraling and urging on his exuberant young crew. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson wisely gave substantial upfront space to trumpeter Walter White, whose 
playing on "In a Mellow Tone" and "The Fox Hunt" (a classic two trumpet battle 
with Ferguson) suggested the emergence of a major league talent. Tenor 
saxophonist Matt Wallace and baritone saxophonist Glenn Coster also performed 
with strongly original points of view. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, however, the ensemble was the star of the evening. The arrangements 
-- especially those written for this instrumentation -- were energetic and 
contemporary. Ferguson's Big Bop Nouveau Band may not please the more hidebound 
purists, but it's got the kind of crossover appeal to make it one of the best 
bets for broad jazz popularity in the '90s.DON HECKMAN

HOSPITAL AILING IN EAST BERLIN AS DOCTORS FLEE

EAST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sprawling Charity Hospital, hard by the Berlin Wall, is the showplace of 
East German medicine, and it is in serious trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of young East Germans have fled to the West, and this has 
left the hospital short of doctors and, just as important, nurses. 
</P>
<P>
"We have problems," Dr. Siegbert Thomas, the administrative director, admitted 
in a guarded interview, "and we are very much involved in finding solutions." 
</P>
<P>
Other sources said that of the hospital's 5,000 doctors and nurses, about 1,100 
have fled to West Germany in the last two months. 
</P>
<P>
"If that many people have left Charity," a medical student said, "think what is 
happening to the smaller hospitals around the country. We hear that the 
situation in some cases is catastrophic." 
</P>
<P>
East Germany has about 500 hospitals, and the standard of medicine has 
traditionally been high. But now, medical sources say, there are widespread 
shortages of supplies and expert help. 
</P>
<P>
Stories are told of bandages being recycled, sterilized but still bearing faint 
bloodstains; of surgeons performing double the customary number of operations; 
of the doctor-patient ratio falling off sharply, from 1 to 5 to 1 to 15. 
</P>
<P>
The shortage of nurses is described as acute, with medical students and even 
orderlies filling in. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, official East Berlin newspapers reported that 2,000 military 
conscripts will be sent not to the army but to hospitals, where they will be 
assigned to help out. 
</P>
<P>
The flight of young people to the West has damaged the entire East German 
economy, but the deterioration in medical care is much more noticeable than 
gaps on assembly lines. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother has been told she has to wait three years for a hip operation," a 
hospital construction worker grumbled during his lunch period in a nearby pub. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke openly of joining the exodus to West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"A heart bypass operation will take more than three years of waiting," a staff 
member at the hospital said. Like the others, he did not want his name used. 
</P>
<P>
"Only emergency cases -- say acute appendicitis -- will get you into an 
operating room within a week," he said. "If you have connections, it happens 
quicker." 
</P>
<P>
He said that according to a rumor among the junior medical staff members at 
Charity, 23 doctors are being reassigned here from the "special hospital" 
outside the capital used exclusively by senior Communist Party officials and 
"foreign friends." 
</P>
<P>
At least 50 doctors reportedly signed a petition calling for reorganizing the 
Communist regime and the entire socialist society. 
</P>
<P>
Charity is one of the oldest important hospitals in Europe. It was founded in 
1710 as a refuge from the plague, and a few years later it was turned into a 
poorhouse. In the late 19th Century, it affiliated with Humboldt University, 
now the University of Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Charity's Gothic, red-brick buildings are complemented by a 20-story 
high-rise and other modern additions to the vast complex. 
</P>
<P>
Charity is a teaching hospital and a major center of medical research. It has 
2,000 beds and treats patients free of charge. A medical assistant said the 
quality of teaching has been quite good but complained that staff members are 
required to spend too much time listening to Marxist-Leninist lectures. 
</P>
<P>
Medical students are given five hours of political lectures a week, the medical 
assistant said, "and that is too much -- and too irrelevant -- with all the 
other things we have to learn here." 
</P>
<P>
Another student complained that wards are short of personnel and supervised by 
young physicians who are improperly qualified but who nevertheless "have to 
make diagnoses and carry out operations." 
</P>
<P>
A senior nurse admitted that there is a severe shortage of nurses because of 
the lure of higher pay in West Germany. Still, she said, she will stay on here, 
"because I have a very good position and I am very happy." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I could find such responsible work in West Germany," she added. 
</P>
<P>
She said she thought the government could help alleviate the problem by 
allowing unrestricted travel, among other reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"Young people like to travel," she said. "It is quite normal that they should 
want to see the world." 
</P>
<P>
She admitted that the woman who heads the dental department, who was to become 
a full professor at the end of the year, left for the West a few days ago.

COURT CLEARS WAY FOR DALKON SHIELD PAYOUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court cleared the way Monday for nearly 100,000 women who were 
injured by the Dalkon Shield birth-control device in the early 1970s to begin 
receiving compensation for their injuries. 
</P>
<P>
By ending further appeals, the high court brought to an end one of the nation's 
largest and longest-running product liability cases. The new owners of A. H. 
Robins Co., makers of the intrauterine device, earlier agreed to create a 
$2.4-billion fund to settle the outstanding damage claims. 
</P>
<P>
The justices declined to hear an appeal filed on behalf of 600 women who 
contended that the $2.4 billion was inadequate. Attorneys representing another 
18,000 women filed a separate brief urging the court to end the case and let 
the settlement begin. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the women said Monday it will be at least several months before 
their clients receive any money, but they foresaw no major legal problems 
ahead. Distribution of the funds will be administered in bankruptcy court with 
payments based on the severity of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
Introduced in 1971 when women were coming to fear the side effects of birth 
control pills, the Dalkon Shield was marketed as safe, effective and pain-free. 
The nickel-sized plastic shield was inserted into the uterus and acted to block 
the implantation of a fertilized egg. A company brochure claimed its new device 
was "generally well tolerated by even the most sensitive women." 
</P>
<P>
Within a few years, an estimated 2.2 million American women had used the Dalkon 
Shield, as had another 1 million outside the United States. Thousands of them 
began complaining of severe pelvic infections. Hundreds had spontaneous 
abortions, and at least 18 died from various complications. 
</P>
<P>
Medical researchers concluded that the tiny string attached to the shield acted 
as a conduit to spread bacteria from the vagina into the uterus. Without 
acknowledging that the Dalkon Shield was causing these medical problems, the 
Richmond, Va.-based A. H. Robins nevertheless quit marketing the device in 
1974. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of lawsuits were filed against Robins, and for years the company 
chose either to fight them or to settle quietly out of court. By 1985, however, 
the weight of litigation and the outstanding claims grew too great, and the 
company directors sought protection under the bankruptcy laws. 
</P>
<P>
The way was paved for the final settlement when American Home Products Corp. 
agreed to buy out Robins and set up the $2.4-billion fund to settle all the 
outstanding claims. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for women who had used the Dalkon Shield initially counted as many as 
330,000 claims against the company. But more than 135,000 claims were dismissed 
by the court-appointed overseer of the bankruptcy action, and another 80,000 
women were given minimal $725 payouts to resolve their claims. Left to be 
resolved are about 95,000 claims. 
</P>
<P>
Washington attorney Alan Morrison, acting on behalf of about 600 women, urged 
the justices to intervene and rule that former Robins executives could be 
liable in the case. He contended that the settlement approved by the bankruptcy 
court was a better deal for the Robins shareholders than for the women injured 
by the company's product. 
</P>
<P>
"The Robins shareholders will receive $700 million in stock of American Home 
Products, while approximately 195,000 Dalkon Shield victims will be relegated 
to seeking recovery for injuries from a trust fund, which, although quite 
substantial, may be inadequate to satisfy in full all of the Dalkon Shield 
claims." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Morrison complained, the settlement gives a legal immunity to former 
Robins executives who, he argued, should be forced to pay for unresolved 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
However, in an unusual friend-of-the-court brief, several lawyers representing 
18,000 women called Morrison's group a "small group of disenchanted claimants" 
who do not speak for the vast majority of victims. They said they feared 
American Home Products Corp. could withdraw its $2.4-billion offer, leaving the 
women with no settlement fund. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of Dalkon Shield claimants oppose (Morrison's appeal) and 
recognize a substantial risk if the (appeal) petition is granted," they said. 
"Not only will they suffer further delay and a further loss of interest on the 
trust fund, but in all likelihood, they will lose the plan and the trust fund 
altogether." 
</P>
<P>
With Justice Bryon R. White dissenting, the court dismissed Morrison's appeal 
without comment. (Menard-Sanford vs. A. H. Robins, 89-441.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The Dalkon Shield was marketed by the A. H. Robins Co. in the early 1970s as a 
safe, effective birth control device. Instead, for thousands of women, the 
intrauterine device caused infections, spontaneous abortions and even death. 
The shield was withdrawn from the market in 1974. Robins went bankrupt in 1985, 
but a $2.4-billion fund was created to pay the nearly 100,000 women who still 
have damage claims pending.

EVIDENCE LINKED TO CONTRAS IN AMBUSH THAT KILLED 18 
</P>

<P>
The ambush that killed 18 Sandinista soldiers here and led to the collapse of 
the Nicaraguan cease-fire was staged with a Claymore mine, an American-made 
weapon used by the U.S.-backed Contras, foreign military specialists said 
Monday after examining evidence from the scene. 
</P>
<P>
In separate testimony, a local farmer said he was certain that the Contras 
mounted the attack on a truckload of troops on Oct. 21 because members of his 
family had recognized two rebels fleeing the area that day. 
</P>
<P>
President Daniel Ortega called the ambush "the last straw" in a series of 
Contra attacks that led him to end the 19-month truce last Wednesday. U.S. and 
Contra officials have refused to accept his account and have suggested that one 
Sandinista unit might have mistakenly fired on another. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, under questioning last month 
about the incident, noted that the Bush Administration ordered the Contras last 
spring to refrain from offensive operations in return for continued non-lethal 
aid. If that ban is violated, he said, "we have obligations (to Congress) to 
cut off our humanitarian assistance." 
</P>
<P>
The farmer's testimony and two objects taken by reporters Saturday from the 
scene of the attack point strongly, if not conclusively, to a rebel attack. 
They are the first known pieces of independent evidence to emerge since the 
incident occurred near this hamlet in central Nicaragua, 20 miles from the town 
of Rio Blanco. 
</P>
<P>
Claudio Fonseca, the Sandinista chief of state security in Rio Blanco, said his 
men recovered a metal wire apparently used to trigger a mine, along with scores 
of cartridges from FAL and AK-47 assault rifles, from a small hill overlooking 
a curve in the road where the army truck was hit. He did not show the evidence 
to journalists. 
</P>
<P>
But two reporters who went to the scene found a couple of objects the 
investigators had left behind: a small piece of metal half-buried in a shallow 
hole in the hillside and an empty plastic spool hidden amid tall grass at the 
crest. 
</P>
<P>
"There can be no doubt that these belong to a Claymore mine," a military 
specialist in Managua said. 
</P>
<P>
He and two other experts said the metal was one of four legs used to prop up a 
Claymore, a deadly anti-personnel explosive that sprays shrapnel in one 
direction when triggered by a wire. The spool was used to hold the wire, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinistas have never been known to use Claymores, the specialists said. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Adan Fley, a Contra official in Honduras, said Monday that the United 
States stopped supplying Claymores to rebel forces years ago but acknowledged 
that some might still be in stock. If there are, he said, "they must be old." 
He refused to acknowledge rebel responsibility for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The ambush occurred in mid-afternoon as a Soviet-made flatbed truck was taking 
32 army reservists from their base in nearby San Andres to register in their 
faraway hometowns for next year's national elections. Also aboard the truck 
were nine army regulars. 
</P>
<P>
The mine exploded about 10 feet from the truck as it rounded a curve in the 
dirt road, as suggested by a hole left in the hillside by the road. The 
attackers were apparently hidden in high grass several yards back. 
</P>
<P>
The day after the attack, Ortega met with the Sandinista army high command and 
reportedly decided to take the offensive against the Contras. In announcing the 
decision last week, he left open the possibility of re-establishing the 
cease-fire through new talks on demobilizing the rebel army. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, U.N. officials announced that Contra leaders have agreed to meet 
Sandinista government representatives Thursday and Friday for the first direct 
peace talks in more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, Nicaragua's Roman Catholic primate, has agreed 
to attend the talks at the United Nations in New York as an observer. He has 
been a go-between for the Sandinistas and Contras in the past. 
</P>
<P>
While all evidence implicates the Contras in the ambush here, some details of 
the official Sandinista account -- that 40 to 50 Contras staged the attack and 
waged a prolonged gun battle with the survivors after the initial explosion -- 
are disputed. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews last week, three of the eight wounded survivors repeated the 
official version, but two of them said they never saw their assailants and 
doubted that anyone else did. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept shooting for 25 minutes," said Juan Antonio Cantarero, the truck's 
22-year-old mechanic. "But nobody saw them." 
</P>
<P>
According to accounts by medical personnel, all the wounded were hit by 
shrapnel. Farmers here said Sandinista investigators did not recover bullet 
cartridges on the hill, as was officially reported; the journalists found none. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have cast doubt on the Sandinista version by saying there was 
speculation among farmers here that another Sandinista unit was in the area and 
might have attacked the truck by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Accidental clashes have occurred between Sandinista foot patrols, but such a 
clash is unlikely in this case. Armed Contras do not go around in trucks, and 
thus a truckload of uniformed men would not likely be mistaken for rebels. In 
any case, no such rumor was repeated by any of the dozen or so farmers 
interviewed here last weekend. They said three Sandinista light infantry 
battalions that had been patrolling the area left the day before the ambush. 
</P>
<P>
The farmer who reported seeing two Contras fleeing the area said the pair ran 
into his sister-in-law's farmhouse after the attack and asked for water. He 
said they told her they were fleeing the army. She recognized them by their 
noms de guerre, Jamaica and Profeta, and said they were attached to the 
Santiago Meza Battalion, one of several Contra units active here, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Contradicting the Sandinista account, the farmer said no other rebels were in 
the area that afternoon. He said he talks regularly to Sandinistas and Contras 
and that "anybody who moves around here we know about." 
</P>
<P>
The rebel official in Honduras identified Jamaica and Profeta as armed Contra 
collaborators who live permanently in the area, giving information on 
Sandinista movements to any rebels passing through. "They are not under our 
control," he said. "They are autonomous."

TEST SCORES OF CALIFORNIA PUPILS SHOW SOME GAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state's eighth-graders are continuing to make academic gains, according to 
California Assessment Program results released Monday, but falling test scores 
for the third- and sixth-graders gave educators some cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
In tests administered last spring, eighth-graders made across-the-board 
improvements over the scores students at that grade level had achieved the year 
before. The statewide average in reading was 256, up 4 points; in math the 
average went up 5 points to 269; in history and social studies it climbed 6 
points to 259, and in science, the average score rose to 267, a 4-point gain. 
</P>
<P>
For third-graders, the statewide average in reading scores slid to 277, down 5 
points from last year's 282. Written language scores fell 6 points to 278, 
while math scores dipped 3 points to 278. 
</P>
<P>
Sixth-graders averaged 262 in reading scores, a 3-point decline; 269 in written 
language, a drop of 4 points, and 267 in math, down 3 points. 
</P>
<P>
The state also released Monday the average test scores for eighth-graders in 
the state's larger districts. The figures -- which combine all four test areas 
-- included changes from last year and the average change over the last three 
years. The state average was 263, up 5 points over last year and up 16 since 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
The huge Los Angeles Unified School District, comprising 15% of the state's 
students, averaged 219, showing a one-year growth of 6 points and a three-year 
growth of 9. While the district remains well below the state average, its gains 
are nonetheless substantial, said Pat McCabe, administrator of operations for 
the state CAP program. 
</P>
<P>
"The problems they face are enormous," said McCabe, noting that English is not 
the native language for about 40% of the district's students. "It's not 
surprising that things are not going up as fast as we would like." 
</P>
<P>
Among other large districts in Los Angeles County, Alhambra, Arcadia, 
Bellflower, Lancaster, Lynwood and Walnut Valley showed three-year gains of 26 
or more points in eighth-grade scores. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, eighth-grade scores have dropped 10 points in three years in 
Azusa, and Baldwin Park showed no improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Compton's eighth-graders posted the lowest average score of the county's large 
districts -- 165. The next-lowest scorers among the county's big districts were 
Lennox, with 185, and Lynwood, 188. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Honig, state superintendent of public instruction, focused on the 
statewide eighth-grade gains in pronouncing himself "very, very proud of what 
has happened." 
</P>
<P>
Noting there has been steady growth by eighth-graders in all areas tested since 
an intensive effort began in 1986 to beef up junior high school education, 
Honig said: 
</P>
<P>
"Three quarters of a million junior high school students . . . improved an 
average of one-half grade for all subjects tested," equivalent to a 25% 
increase in performance. 
</P>
<P>
"Another way of gauging the magnitude of these improvements is to consider that 
the average Japanese eighth-grader was approximately two years ahead of the 
American eighth-grader in math in 1986," Honig said. "We shaved 25% off that 
gap in three years. If we continue progress at this rate for the next decade, 
we will close the gap." 
</P>
<P>
The performance of U.S. school graduates has been a source of increasing 
consternation among many business leaders, who fear Americans are not well 
prepared to compete in world markets. 
</P>
<P>
The CAP tests have been administered each spring since 1974 to the state's 
third-, sixth- and eighth-graders. High school seniors take the tests each fall 
and the results are released in the spring. The scores, which generally range 
from 100 to 400 points, are used to measure a school's performance rather than 
that of individual students. 
</P>
<P>
Honig said Monday he hopes the lessons learned from shoring up junior high 
school education -- including curriculum overhaul and increased individual 
attention to students -- can be tailored to making improvements at the lower 
grade levels. He said he expects an elementary education task force to make its 
recommendations in about seven months. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the lower grades' achievement levels are still above national 
norms, Honig said state education officials nonetheless are "trying to get a 
handle on the reasons for this decline." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the decline can be attributed to the rapidly increasing proportion of 
students in California who are not proficient in English and to the explosive 
growth in many schools around the state. While students with limited English 
proficiency made strong gains over the last three years, they still lag behind 
those for whom English is the primary language, Honig said. 
</P>
<P>
It is also possible that teachers -- bending over backward to avoid a repeat of 
a cheating scandal that tainted the CAP testing system two years ago -- were 
overly cautious in admonishing students about changing their answers. "We have 
considerably fewer erasures this year," Honig said, adding that officials did 
not mean to discourage legitimate wrong-to-right answer erasures. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, tests at the lower level are somewhat out of date and will be 
revamped in time for 1991 testing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP Later this week, the state Department of Education will release the 
California Assessment Program scores in each of the state's public schools for 
pupils in the third, sixth and eighth grades. The results will enable parents 
to compare the scores of their children's school and district with those of 
other public schools. The Times will publish the scores of local schools.

<TEXT>
<P>
The attorney for a Texas couple who blame their son's crib death on a defective 
respiratory monitor told a House subcommittee on Monday that the monitor's 
manufacturer failed to inform federal authorities about at least 50 such 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
The infant deaths were cited at a subcommittee hearing as evidence of the 
failure of the Food and Drug Administration's "early warning" system to detect 
potentially life-threatening problems with medical devices. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers are required to inform the FDA when medical devices may have 
contributed to a death or a serious injury or when a malfunction could prove 
hazardous. But the company that manufactured the monitor in the Texas couple's 
case initially notified the FDA of only one of 76 death and injury cases in its 
files, said Cage Wavell, who represents Michael and Cory Davis, a Corpus 
Christi couple. 
</P>
<P>
"We were never told there could be any problems with the monitor," said Michael 
Davis, 22, who testified in hushed tones about the March 17, 1987, death of his 
infant son. "The only thing we were told was that we couldn't take our son home 
without the monitor." 
</P>
<P>
The monitor is used for infants susceptible to apnea, a sudden cessation of 
breathing. Davis said that it failed to sound an alarm when his son, whose 
lungs were not fully developed because he was born prematurely, stopped 
breathing. 
</P>
<P>
The inspector general's office of the Department of Health and Human Services 
is conducting a criminal investigation of the company -- Aequitron -- to 
determine whether it withheld required reports from the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
Davis and his wife, Cory, provided the emotional focus of a packed hearing 
before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and the 
environment. They were preceded by Charles Bowsher, the comptroller general of 
the General Accounting Office, who discussed two GAO reports that were highly 
critical of the FDA's oversight of medical devices, ranging from thermometers 
to kidney dialysis machines.

"It's very clear here," Bowsher said, "that . . . there's very little testing 
going on, and when there are problems, they're not reported." 
</P>
<P>
The GAO's analysis of 1,635 medical device recalls between 1983 and 1988 
determined that manufacturers had filed required reports of deaths, injuries or 
hazardous malfunctions in only 22% of the cases. 
</P>
<P>
Bowsher said the GAO found that 33% of the medical device manufacturers said 
they were unaware of the reporting requirement. Manufacturers maintain that the 
reporting regulations are ambiguous and subject to differing interpretations by 
even well-meaning companies. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), subcommittee chairman, used the Davises' 
description of their experience with Aequitron to illustrate what he and other 
critics maintain are the dramatic shortcomings of current regulation of the 
fast-growing $14-billion industry. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the FDA, Aequitron and the Health Industry Manufacturers 
Assn. rebutted the GAO findings and witnesses' testimony as misleading or 
inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
FDA spokeswoman Susan Cruzan said the agency encourages the medical device 
industry to initiate recalls when problems are detected and, "when the agency 
has information, it takes appropriate action promptly and aggressively." 
</P>
<P>
She said that the FDA understood that Aequitron had investigated each death 
associated with its monitors. In addition, she said the agency has begun its 
own inquiry to determine whether "the company's conclusions were valid and to 
ascertain whether some of the nonreported deaths should have been reported 
under the law." 
</P>
<P>
In general, she advised: "Parents should be aware that no apnea monitor is 
foolproof." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Aequitron, the largest maker of infant monitors, said the 
company had reported all required deaths or injuries to the FDA. The Plymouth, 
Minn., firm was aware of 115 deaths of infants for whom the monitor had been 
prescribed, including 24 in which the alarm allegedly failed, Chris Malacek 
said. The company reported eight cases to the FDA, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the course of eight years about 150,000 infants have been monitored," 
Malacek said. During "all those monitoring cycles, it's never been established 
that a defect or a malfunction in one of the monitors caused the death of a 
patient." 
</P>
<P>
Aequitron voluntarily recalled 5,000 of its Model 9200 monitors in June of 1987 
after it determined that an alarm failed to sound at certain voltages. Malacek 
said the device used on the Davises' son, a Model 8200, was subsequently tested 
by Aequitron and "found to be fully functional." 
</P>
<P>
The GAO found that 94% of new products that have come on the market in the past 
13 years were not required to undergo rigorous tests to prove their safety and 
effectiveness because of a widely used loophole in a 1976 law. The law stated 
that manufacturers could avoid the testing process by declaring that the new 
product was "substantially equivalent" to devices already available. Aequitron 
has used this exemption for its infant monitors.

POLITICAL IMPASSE REMAINS AFTER ELECTION IN GREECE; 
</P>
<P>
EUROPE: CONSERVATIVES SAY THEY WILL TRY TO FORM A GOVERNMENT. BUT PRESIDENT 
CHRISTOS SARTZETAKIS ASKS THE CARETAKER PRIME MINISTER TO STAY ON.

<P>
Complete official election returns confirmed Monday that Greek voters had 
failed for the second time in five months to choose a new government, and 
President Christos Sartzetakis asked caretaker Prime Minister Yannis Gravis to 
remain in office while the dust settles. 
</P>
<P>
Conservatives who finished first in Sunday's vote but fell short of the 
necessary majority said they will try to form a one-party minority government 
to break the left-right impasse. President Sartzetakis may let them make this 
long-shot attempt, but the constitution does not require that he do so. 
</P>
<P>
If, as most observers expect, backstage maneuvering fails to produce a stable 
government, Greece must vote again -- possibly as early as next month but 
almost certainly no later than March. 
</P>
<P>
The standoff is as disconcerting to the United States and Greece's partners in 
the European Community as it is to the Greeks themselves. Europe is alarmed by 
Greece's fall into ever greater economic distress. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is eager to resume talks on renewing leases on four military 
bases in Greece. The bases have been put on notice to close in mid-1990, but 
now there is no government with which to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
Constantine Mitsotakis, the 71-year-old leader of the New Democracy Party, said 
he will tell Sartzetakis this morning that he wants to form a government for 
submission to Parliament for a vote of confidence in about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Sartzetakis can agree to let him try or can refuse if he thinks there is no 
chance that Mitsotakis can get Parliament's support for his programs. In 
Sunday's election, New Democracy won 148 of the 300 seats in Parliament, 3 shy 
of a majority. 
</P>
<P>
"Mitsotakis can produce the sort of government plan that can win in 
Parliament," New Democracy spokesman Andreas Andrianopoulous said. "Otherwise, 
we will have to go again to elections." 
</P>
<P>
In Greece, a parliamentary vote of confidence is secret and requires a majority 
of those present and voting. The conservatives hope that they can persuade 
enough moderate Socialists to vote with them, or perhaps cajole an abstaining 
"vote of tolerance" from the Communists, who are the third bloc in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that if Mitsotakis survives in an initial vote, he might limp 
through until scheduled presidential elections in March, but only as head of a 
government too weak to initiate needed economic reforms, or to address pressing 
issues of foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to talks on the bases, the United States seeks Greek government 
endorsement of a judicial deportation order against a jailed Palestinian 
accused of an airliner bombing over Hawaii in 1982 that killed one person and 
injured 15. 
</P>
<P>
Communists joined with conservatives in an interim government after the June 
election, but only for the purpose of investigating corruption in the outgoing 
government of Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou. As a result of the 
investigation, Papandreou and four of his senior ministers face trial. 
</P>
<P>
Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement ran second in Sunday's election, 
winning 128 seats. A Communist coalition won 21 seats, and the remaining three 
went to two independent leftists and a Greek Muslim. 
</P>
<P>
If Mitsotakis cannot form a government, under Greek law Papandreou will be 
invited to try. 
</P>
<P>
He dreams of a grand alliance of the left, but the Communists despise him. 
</P>
<P>
The Greek stock market slumped Monday, apparently out of concern that the 
economic situation will worsen in the absence of a stable government. 
</P>
<P>
Greek economic growth is slower than in the rest of the European Community; its 
inflation is nearly four times higher, its foreign debt is $52.7 billion and 
the public payroll is heavily padded. Conservatives say the Papandreou 
government added 90,000 public workers in the first six months of this year. 
Dozens of state enterprises are uneconomical.

<P>
Lebanese politicians began cementing alliances under a new government as Muslim 
Prime Minister Salim Hoss, head of one of two rival regimes, traveled to 
Syrian-controlled territory in the north to hand over his resignation to Rene 
Mouawad, a Maronite Christian elected and inaugurated Sunday as Lebanon's ninth 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, Lebanon's tenacious military strongman and leader of a 
Christian government opposed to that of Hoss, continued Monday to denounce the 
Parliament's election of Mouawad. Although both Aoun and Mouawad are Christian, 
Mouawad is Syrian-supported, and the general has vowed to drive all Syrian 
troops from Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Mouawad paid a call on the Maronite Christian Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, who 
had been terrorized earlier in the day by rabid followers of Aoun because of 
Sfeir's support for the new president. The two met at the patriarch's summer 
residence in the north, where Sfeir fled after his headquarters in the 
Christian enclave was stormed. 
</P>
<P>
As Lebanese awaited Mouawad's appointment of a new prime minister and cabinet, 
Aoun, surrounded by loyal troops of the national army he commands, stood his 
ground at his presidential palace at Baabda, outside Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a brave man," a Nicosia-based diplomat said, "but he tried to do what was 
politically and militarily impossible" -- drive a Syrian army of 40,000 out of 
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
After 14 years of civil strife and a devastating six-month Christian-Muslim 
artillery war this year, Lebanese politicians finally gave in to outside 
pressure and agreed to a package of political reforms designed to dismantle 
Christian privileges. 
</P>
<P>
Equally important to other Mideast nations, which forced a truce on Lebanon 
through the Arab League, the fighting had threatened any hope of stability in 
the region, most recently as Iraq and Iran carried on their own conflict by 
proxy in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
But the 54-year-old Aoun -- who had said he was willing "to give peace a 
chance" when Lebanon's aged parliamentary deputies were summoned last month to 
Taif, Saudi Arabia, to work out accords -- is not satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not at confrontation with an elected president but will continue our 
campaign against the Syrian occupation," the general declared after Mouawad was 
elected Sunday by the Parliament at an abandoned military airfield under Syrian 
control on the north coast of Lebanon. "We are determined to thwart the 
conspiracy which is being hatched to eliminate what is left of Lebanon's 
sovereignty and territorial integrity." 
</P>
<P>
Syrian troops entered Lebanon in 1976 under an Arab League mandate and at the 
request of Christian President Suleiman Franjieh. The civil war was more than a 
year old, and Christian forces were hard-pressed by Palestinian fighters. Now 
the Syrians and their Muslim militia allies control 70% of the country. 
</P>
<P>
The Taif accord dealt primarily with political reform. A separate document 
pledges the Arab League to work for Syrian withdrawal, but not on a timetable 
tied to reform, as Aoun had demanded. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, even Israel, which over the years has supported Lebanon's army in 
its struggle against the Syrians, joined the international chorus of support 
for Mouawad's election and the prospect of reform. 
</P>
<P>
"We can only hope that this election will bring more relaxation, stability and 
a new Lebanese framework based on today's reality and not on the dreams of the 
past," Uri Lubrani, Israel's coordinator for Lebanese policy, said in 
Jerusalem. "I hope this action will reduce the Syrian presence in Lebanon." 
</P>
<P>
Aoun called on his die-hard supporters to protest the developments, which he 
called constitutionally invalid, in "a civil manner," but hot-headed young 
Christians ran wild in the hours after Mouawad's election. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after midnight, according to police accounts reported in the Lebanese 
press, about 100 protesters stormed the compound of the 68-year-old Patriarch 
Sfeir at Bkirki north of Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
"The rioters broke into the patriarch's bedroom, dragged him out of bed, forced 
him to kneel with two senior aides who rushed to help him and forced all of 
them to kiss posters of Aoun," a police spokesman said. ". . .They were 
hysterical." 
</P>
<P>
According to another account, portraits of Sfeir and Pope John Paul II were 
removed from the walls of the residence and replaced with pictures of the 
general. Other Aoun supporters reportedly broke into at least six other 
churches in the hours after midnight. They fired automatic rifles in the air, 
burned vehicle tires and rang the church bells, the police reported. 
</P>
<P>
Monday morning, caravans of youths cruised the streets of Christian East Beirut 
firing their rifles into the air. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no leader but Aoun!" they shouted. "Mouawad is a Syrian lackey!" 
</P>
<P>
A general strike shut down schools and commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The new president, speaking Sunday after his election, made it clear that he 
supports close relations between Lebanon and Syria, which he said are based on 
common interests and historical ties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The Maronites are the leading Christian sect in Lebanon. They claim 1 million 
adherents there, plus more in Syria, Israel, the United States (where many 
emigrated) and elsewhere. Their leader is Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, 68, of 
Lebanon. The sect traces its origins to St. Maron, a monk who lived in northern 
Syria in the 5th Century. Centuries later, seeking to escape persecution by 
Muslim caliphs, sect members fled to the mountains of Lebanon, where many 
remain today. They allied themselves with the Crusaders and later formed ties 
with France. A massacre of Maronites by Druze Muslims in 1860 led to France's 
first intervention in Lebanon. The Maronite Church is allied with Rome but uses 
Eastern Antiochene rites.

U.S. BALKS AT YEAR 2000 AS DEADLINE TO CUT GREENHOUSE GASES; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE WHITE HOUSE INSISTS IT WANTS TO COMBAT GLOBAL WARMING. IT 
MERELY SAYS THAT NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO SET FIRM GOALS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Although insisting that the United States has led the world in steps to protect 
the environment, the Bush Administration came under intense public pressure 
Monday to adopt an ambitious goal of stabilizing emissions of so-called 
greenhouse pollutants by the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
The heat came from Europeans, the government of the Netherlands and 
environmental activists, as well as the head of the U.N. Environmental Program, 
who warned: "It is almost a virtual certainty that our planet faces 
unprecedented climate change. In the face of catastrophic possibilities, we 
cannot await empirical certainty. We know enough right now to begin action." 
</P>
<P>
But Environmental Protection Agency chief William K. Reilly and White House 
science adviser D. Allan Bromley, appearing at a global warming conference 
convened here by the Dutch government, declared that this is neither the time 
nor the place to set a deadline or limits on the emission of greenhouse gases. 
They are so called because they trap radiation and have been responsible for a 
slow but measurable warming of the Earth's atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Barring an eleventh-hour turnaround, the U.S. delegation will refuse to endorse 
the crucial paragraph of a declaration calling for stabilization of greenhouse 
gases in the atmosphere by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Reilly said the Administration "will be prepared to go as far and 
as fast as the rest of the world" to meet the threat of pollution-caused 
warming of the climate, although "to imagine that we will develop policies in 
total lock-step is illusory." 
</P>
<P>
Crucial language for a declaration to be issued at the end of the conference 
was still being negotiated Monday night. Mostafa K. Tolba, director of the U.N. 
Environmental Program, said there was still movement toward a general accord. 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety-five percent of the countries consider that it is their responsibility 
that they should stabilize the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse 
gases no later than the year 2000," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When the conference ends today, Tolba said, he expects all of the conferees to 
adopt the principle of atmospheric stabilization -- but to include language 
indicating that some of them oppose establishing the year 2000 as a deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the arrival of environmental ministers in this city near The Hague, 
working-level officials from 61 countries spent nearly three days trying to 
shape a declaration that could get a consensus. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the United States, other countries resisting the key provision 
contained in a Dutch draft declaration include Britain, Japan and the Soviet 
Union. The declaration calls for carbon dioxide emissions to be trimmed by 20% 
from 1988 levels by the year 2000, enough to "stabilize" the atmosphere so that 
further measures could produce a reduction of energy-trapping gases. 
</P>
<P>
Although attention has focused on the United States and other world powers 
resisting the deadline and the emission target, Reilly said that a majority of 
Third World countries would resist such a requirement if given a chance to vote 
on it. 
</P>
<P>
Developing countries now produce only about 30% of the carbon dioxide being put 
into the atmosphere, but their share is expected to increase as development 
progresses. The United States alone, with its massive use of fossil fuels, 
produces nearly a fourth of the total. 
</P>
<P>
In a declaration along the lines of the Dutch draft, leaders of private 
environmental organizations from 22 countries urged the ministers to adopt the 
20% reduction and the turn-of-the-century deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Produced after a two-day conference in Rotterdam last week, the unofficial 
declaration called for the wealthier industrialized nations to provide 
technical and financial assistance to enable developing countries to meet the 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
The private groups urged completion of a framework convention on climate change 
next year and adoption of an international accord on carbon dioxide reduction 
by the end of 1992. They noted that 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide have been 
emitted into the atmosphere since the Paris economic summit called for 
"decisive action" on global warming last July. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the environmental groups criticized the United States and 
its allies for opposing a deadline and reduction targets. 
</P>
<P>
"Waiting for scientific certainty," said Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned 
Scientists, "is not responsible policy." Dan Becker, an official of the Sierra 
Club in Washington, charged that decisions for the U.S. delegation were being 
relayed from the White House and that Bromley, the President's science adviser, 
had been sent along to "handcuff" Reilly, the U.S. delegation chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA administrator and the science adviser appeared together at a press 
conference shortly before Reilly addressed the delegates, and Bromley declared 
the two of them in accord on the U.S. position. The Bush Administration is 
conducting a "crash program" of research to understand the greenhouse 
phenomenon and long-term global warming, Bromley said. 
</P>
<P>
"In no way are we hanging back," he said, "and this reflects the President's 
firm personal commitment in keeping the United States in a leading position." 
</P>
<P>
In his address to the conference Monday afternoon, Reilly stressed U.S. support 
for developing a strategy against global warming through the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change, established under the auspices of the United Nations 
and the World Meteorological Organization. 
</P>
<P>
The IPCC is due to meet in Washington in February. After that meeting, Reilly 
told reporters, the United States will be prepared to begin negotiation of a 
framework convention on climate change, if other nations agree. 
</P>
<P>
Tolba, who was working to iron out differences with the holdouts, agreed with 
the U.S. contention that the conference here is not an occasion to negotiate a 
formal agreement. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, it is important that the conference "give a signal" when it 
concludes today, and in his address to the opening session Monday morning and 
in remarks at a press conference, he appeared to be speaking to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that automobiles account for 10% of the fossil fuel burning, he said 
carbon dioxide emissions from motor vehicles will increase by 75% by the end of 
the century if efficiency continues at the current 20-m.p.g. average. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not acceptable," the U.N. official said.

Braniff Inc. announced Monday it was ceasing all scheduled passenger service 
immediately because a severe cash shortage doomed the airline's bankruptcy 
reorganization plan. 
</P>
<P>
William G. McGee, the company's chairman, president and chief executive 
officer, said the action was taken to preserve assets while Braniff continues 
to develop alternatives, which might include selling the airline. 
</P>
<P>
Braniff halted all passenger service at midnight Monday but will continue and 
expand its charter airline service while Merrill Lynch Capital Markets explores 
strategic alternatives, McGee said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
McGee said Braniff employees would be notified of their individual status. 
</P>
<P>
Braniff filed for bankruptcy court protection Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Braniff, which operated 46 of its 256 pre-bankruptcy flights Friday, was the 
first major carrier to file for bankruptcy after airline deregulation in the 
early 1980s.

Despite many press accounts of investigations against the mayor, Lewis' was the 
first on-the-record, under-oath accusation that Barry, the city's mayor for 10 
years, had been given drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The federal investigation began when city police called off an attempt to make 
an undercover drug purchase from Lewis because they discovered that the mayor 
was in Lewis' hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
Barry has acknowledged making at least six visits to Lewis' hotel but has 
steadfastly denied using, seeing or purchasing drugs during those trips. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried at all about this," Barry told reporters at the District 
Building Monday night. The mayor described Lewis, a former associate, as a 
"convicted felon" and said: "He'll say anything in court . . . trying to save 
his own hide." 
</P>
<P>
R. Kenneth Mundy, the mayor's lawyer, scoffed at the defendant's comments. 
</P>
<P>
"We question the credibility of the source," Mundy said. "Charles Lewis is a 
besieged and beleaguered man who knows that his only salvation comes by not 
giving truthful statements about the mayor." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis' statement came as Judge Stanley Sporkin was reviewing a plea bargain 
calling for Lewis to plead guilty to two counts of cocaine possession and 
distribution. 
</P>
<P>
The second count centered on Lewis' activities at the hotel in December and 
referred to Lewis' distributing cocaine to one individual on at least three 
separate occasions. 
</P>
<P>
"Because I don't want to look like a fool, was one of the individuals you gave 
cocaine to the mayor of this city?" Sporkin asked Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis replied: "Yes, your honor, crack cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
Sporkin then accepted the plea agreement and the two guilty pleas under it. 
Sentencing was set for Jan. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $1-million fine for 
each count. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Jay B. Stephens, in a meeting with reporters after the hearing, said 
federal prosecutors had attempted to keep Barry's name out because "this is an 
ongoing investigation . . . . Until people are charged, it seems to me, the 
shield of the grand jury should protect the innocent as well as the guilty." 
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely that federal prosecutors will seek an indictment of Barry on 
charges of possession of cocaine with only circumstantial evidence to back up 
Lewis' statements, or without evidence of other violations of law by Barry, 
sources told the Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
Besides allegations of drug use, investigators are examining whether Barry 
committed perjury when he testified before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was convicted on cocaine distribution charges in the Virgin Islands 
earlier this year. His sentencing in that case was postponed indefinitely as 
part of the plea bargain.

CATHOLIC BISHOPS TACKLING AIDS, OTHER POLICY ISSUES 
</P>

<P>
As the nation's Roman Catholic bishops convened Monday to hammer out policy on 
matters ranging from the Middle East to AIDS, their outgoing president issued a 
ringing call for an end to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Archbishop John May of St. Louis told the 300 bishops meeting here that their 
role as moral teachers is compatible with respect for America's democratic 
tradition and pluralism, but on abortion there is a "clear-cut moral principle" 
that cannot be compromised. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't forget the baby. That's all the Catholic Church is saying to America," 
May said in his final address as president of the National Conference of 
Catholic Bishops. 
</P>
<P>
According to church custom, his successor is likely to be the current vice 
president, Archbishop Daniel E. Pilarczyk of Cincinnati. New officers will be 
elected today. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the nation's 55 million Roman Catholics are celebrating the 
200th anniversary of the Catholic hierarchy in the United States. Among the 
policy decisions to be tackled at the four-day conference are the role of 
blacks in the church and how to conduct Sunday worship in priestless parishes, 
a worsening problem as the number of priests declines. 
</P>
<P>
May was applauded loudly when he blamed the media for "distorting" the issue of 
abortion by referring to supporters of abortion rights as "pro-choice" while 
"refusing to call us 'pro-life.' 
</P>
<P>
"When people say abortion is a matter of choice, they're forgetting someone," 
he said. "Who defends the child's choice, the child's inalienable right to 
life"? 
</P>
<P>
He added: "Every woman in America should know that the Catholic Church is 
willing to care both for her and for the baby she is carrying." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Archbishop Roger M. Mahony presented policy statements on the 
Middle East and on AIDS that are to be debated and voted on before the 
conference ends Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The 54-page statement, "Toward Peace in the Middle East," calls for Palestinian 
territorial sovereignty and the removal of foreign troops from Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"We have analyzed the . . . Israeli-Arab-Palestinian conflict in terms of 
territory, sovereignty and security. These are political concepts, but we 
believe each idea has moral content," Mahony said as he introduced the 
statement. It would be the U.S. bishops' first major statement on the Middle 
East in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The AIDS statement asserts that confining sexual intercourse to marriage is 
"the only morally correct and medically secure" way to avoid the fatal disease. 
"We caution young people not to be trapped into following the 'safe sex' myth, 
which is both a lie and a fraud," Mahony said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed statement would replace one written in 1987 that some interpreted 
as permitting Catholics to include information about condoms in AIDS education 
programs. The new statement "focuses totally on the Roman Catholic position . . 
. and "is very much against prophylactics," Mahony told reporters Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Pope John Paul II sent Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Agostino Casaroli to 
address the conference. While praising the bishops for their attention to 
social and human rights causes, he reminded them that "no particular (national) 
church can function independently" of the Pope. Recent tensions over Vatican 
authority strained relations between the bishops and Rome, but that has eased 
since last March, when 36 of the top U.S. prelates met with the Pope at the 
Vatican, May said.

SADIE ALEXANDER; PIONEERED OPPORTUNITIES FOR BLACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander, the first American black woman to get a Ph.D. 
in economics and to become a lawyer in Pennsylvania, has died in her 
Philadelphia retirement community. She was 91. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Alexander died Wednesday in Cathedral Village of pneumonia. She had been 
hospitalized there with Alzheimer's disease since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
A civil rights leader for more than half a century, Mrs. Alexander was 
appointed by President Harry S. Truman to his Committee on Civil Rights in 
1948, and by former President Jimmy Carter as chairman of his White House 
Conference on Aging in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
She was active nationally in the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans for 
Democratic Action and the National Urban League. 
</P>
<P>
Born Jan. 2, 1898, to a distinguished black family in Philadelphia, Mrs. 
Alexander was the nation's second woman to earn a doctorate, following the 
first by a single day. She became the first black woman to earn a law degree 
from the University of Pennsylvania, a generation after her father, Aaron 
Mossell, was the first black man to do so. 
</P>
<P>
During her college career, Mrs. Alexander founded Penn's chapter of the Howard 
University-based black sorority Delta Sigma Theta, and became its first 
national president. 
</P>
<P>
"I was embarrassed and thrilled at the same time," she once said of her 
ceremonial march to receive her historic doctorate. "Coming up the stairs to 
the platform I heard a voice say, 'Here she comes.' It was the president of 
Bryn Mawr. At that time Bryn Mawr didn't admit black students." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Alexander married Harvard law graduate Raymond Pace Alexander and 
practiced law with him until he became a judge, initiating legal battles that 
opened up restaurants, hotels and movie theaters to blacks in Philadelphia. 
During the 1940s she served as assistant city solicitor. 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband, who died in 1974, helped found the National Bar Assn., an 
organization of black lawyers. In 1986, the Philadelphia Bar Assn. named its 
public service center in the couple's honor. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Alexander was the granddaughter of Bishop Benjamin Tucker of the African 
Methodist Episcopal Church, which was founded in Philadelphia. She was a niece 
of Henry Tanner, the 19th-Century artist. 
</P>
<P>
She is survived by two daughters, Rae Alexander Minter of New York and Mary A. 
Brown of Washington, three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

VLADIMIR HOROWITZ: AN APPRECIATION; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: A LEGEND WHO PLAYED BY HIS OWN QUIRKY, SOMETIMES DUBIOUS RULES, HOROWITZ 
MADE THE TRIVIAL SEEM ELEGANT, THE SIGNIFICANT ETHEREAL. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Vladimir Horowitz, who died on Sunday one month after his 85th birthday, was -- 
well -- Vladimir Horowitz. 
</P>
<P>
There was no other pianist like him. Chances are, there never will be. 
</P>
<P>
He played by his own rules, even at his worst. At his best, he played 
magnificently. That puts it, as they say, mildly. 
</P>
<P>
Once established and universally adulated, he played only when he pleased (in 
later years at the odd hour of 4 on Sunday afternoons). He played only where he 
pleased. He played only what he pleased. Legends can afford to be choosy. 
</P>
<P>
No one played faster or slower, louder or softer, smoother or rougher than 
Horowitz. He respected no conventional limits. 
</P>
<P>
No one played with such nonchalant virtuosity. No one played with such dazzling 
individuality. No one played with such uncanny accuracy. No one played with 
such abiding expressive allure. 
</P>
<P>
Do not misunderstand. They still make great pianists -- pianists who, like 
Horowitz, seem to command at least 40 fingers of flexible steel. However, they 
no longer make pianists with faces like Horowitz. 
</P>
<P>
I am not referring, of course, to his actual physiognomy. His dapper hang-dog 
look exerted its undisputed appeal -- the eyelids drooping soulfully, the mouth 
telegraphing charm in spite of itself, the noble, generous nose dominating 
everything else proudly. But Horowitz's artistic profile was the crucial image. 
</P>
<P>
It was a profile predicated on inspired egocentricity. Horowitz may not have 
been a deep thinker. More important, he was a deep dreamer. Inhibition was not 
his forte. 
</P>
<P>
He made the commonplace seem elegant, and the significant seem ethereal. When 
drama was called for, he thundered until the heavens rattled. When 
introspection was deemed appropriate, he melted into sighs and whispers that 
lent new meaning to the concept of delicacy. Most important, perhaps, he 
understood that dynamic extremes can make little impact without the logical 
reference of a sane and poised middle ground. 
</P>
<P>
At his best, he sustained superhuman control even under unreasonable duress. He 
was a poet -- and a sentimentalist -- who could make a soggy ditty like 
Schumann's "Traumerei" sound like lofty poetry. He could make the sparklets of 
Moszkowski fly like exquisite missiles from another world. 
</P>
<P>
He could almost make "The Stars and Stripes Forever!" -- in his own bravura 
transcription, naturally -- sound like music. He even could convince us that 
Bizet really intended the most seductive of Carmens to be not a mezzo-soprano 
vamp but a cheeky pianist. 
</P>
<P>
No one played a Chopin nocturne as Horowitz did -- with as many moonstruck 
colors, as sensuous a rubato and with as many subtle nuances. No one brought 
the same passion to Rachmaninoff (a personal friend), the same nobility to 
Beethoven, the same sensitivity to Schumann, or the same warmth to Brahms. 
</P>
<P>
Like all giants, he had his detractors. They complained, with good reason, that 
Horowitz played Mozart as if that unfortunate composer had the bad taste to be 
born a century too early. They griped, reasonably, that Horowitz distorted the 
likes of Scarlatti and Clementi with Romantic anachronisms. 
</P>
<P>
His critics lamented his disdain for modernism, although they had to note that 
he did introduce Samuel Barber's Opus 26 Sonata to the world in 1949. They did 
document his abiding tendency toward superficiality, on occasion, for its own 
slick and shimmering sake. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz certainly wasn't a scholar. He wasn't a stylist in matters of 
authentic performance practice. A product of his time, he remained to the end a 
charter member of the I-play-it-this-way-because-I-feel-it-this-way club. 
</P>
<P>
Some of his playing may have been eccentric or misguided or even wrongheaded. 
During periods of fragile or declining health, his playing suffered obvious 
technical lapses. But Horowitz was never boring. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows the lore about his foibles. He commanded, and blithely received, 
astronomical fees. He insisted on traveling -- even to Russia -- with his own 
entourage of sycophants and engineers, his own food, and his own piano. 
Reliable sources insist that it was a carefully doctored instrument that helped 
manufacture the fabulous and possibly unnatural Horowitz tone. 
</P>
<P>
He was a shrewd show-businessman. He made sure that every hemidemisemiquaver of 
his twilight years would be recorded for a grateful posterity on videotapes as 
well as recordings. 
</P>
<P>
He struck poses of disarming modesty on the stage and, sometimes, in 
interviews. But -- spurred ever onward by his stubbornly watchful wife, Wanda 
Toscanini -- he could act like a tyrant or spoiled brat or both behind the 
scenes. 
</P>
<P>
One never saw him at other artists' concerts. On the other hand, he did enjoy 
outings at nightclubs or discos. According to longstanding rumors substantiated 
by his biographers, he enjoyed the company of doting boys as well as adoring 
women. 
</P>
<P>
He seemed indomitable. Amid reports of a nervous disorder, he disappeared from 
public view for a long time in the 1960s, only to return in better form than 
ever before. He played one tour late in his career that seemed to document a 
tragic loss of prowess, then undertook another comeback that made happy liars 
of all the doomsayers. 
</P>
<P>
He hobnobbed with the creme of society, even with royalty, and showed no 
outward signs of awe. According to John Pfeiffer, the long-suffering record 
producer, Prince Charles of Great Britain once visited the Horowitzes after a 
concert and invited the couple to Buckingham Palace for a drink. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't drink," the pianist brashly apologized. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we'll make you some borscht," the Prince countered. 
</P>
<P>
"Ugh," responded Horowitz, making a sour face. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, the prince of pianists did visit the Prince of Wales and Lady Diana 
the next week. Noblesse obliged on several levels. But Horowitz pointedly 
declined any refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
He always adhered to his standards.

KAREN CARPENTER: SHE HAD ONLY JUST BEGUN; 
</P>
<P>
POP: NEW CARPENTERS' ALBUM FEATURES FOUR SONGS FROM KAREN'S ILL-FATED SOLO 
COLLECTION. THE ALBUM SUGGESTS SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD A CAREER AS A SOLOIST.

KarenandRichard. 
</P>
<P>
Those names were linked so often in the 1970s, when the Carpenters were the 
hottest duo in pop music, that many pop fans came to think of the pair as one. 
</P>
<P>
That was fine early in the decade when the Downey brother-and-sister team was 
turning out instant standards such as "We've Only Just Begun" and "Close to 
You," but it started to bother Karen in the late 1970s when the duo's fortunes 
declined sharply. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to establish an independent identity at last, Karen moved to New 
York in 1979 to record a solo album with Grammy-winning producer Phil Ramone, 
whose credits include hits by Billy Joel, Paul Simon and Barbra Streisand. 
</P>
<P>
But the album was never released. Instead, Karen and Richard reteamed to record 
a traditional Carpenters album, which failed to reverse their downward career 
momentum. And in 1983 -- after a brief, failed marriage -- Karen died at 32 of 
complications from anorexia nervosa, an eating disorder which had plagued her 
since the mid '70s. 
</P>
<P>
With her death, the "lost Karen tapes" became even more of a source of mystery 
among fans. But they remained unavailable -- until now. 
</P>
<P>
Four songs from that shelved 1979 album are featured -- along with eight 
previously unreleased Carpenters recordings -- on a just-released Carpenters 
album, "Love-lines." 
</P>
<P>
The recordings -- released to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the 
Carpenters' signing with A&amp;M Records -- suggest that Karen could work 
effectively outside the Carpenters' mellow pop sound and could have gone on to 
a thriving solo career. 
</P>
<P>
The big question: Why was the solo album put in limbo? 
</P>
<P>
The bigger question: If the album had been released and been successful, would 
things have turned out differently for Karen? 
</P>
<P>
The suspicion in some music industry quarters has been that Karen shelved the 
solo album out of loyalty to Richard, who was anxious to get back to work in 
1979 after recovering from a Quaalude dependency. (Richard's dependency was 
revealed in CBS-TV's "The Karen Carpenter Story," the highest-rated TV movie of 
the 1988-89 season.) 
</P>
<P>
In an interview tied to the release of the new album, Richard Carpenter, 43, 
was candid about the conflicts within the Carpenters in the late '70s. 
</P>
<P>
"Karen would mention every now and again that it would be nice to receive some 
accolades as a solo singer," he said in an A&amp;M office in Hollywood. "Of 
course, that made me feel badly, because we were a duo. Lord knows, she was the 
star of the duo, but that's not quite the same." 
</P>
<P>
Richard said that he had a less-than-supportive reaction to Karen's 
announcement -- just after he had begun a six-week drug rehabilitation program 
-- that she was planning to record an album without him. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably said something like, 'You're just abandoning ship, just taking off 
and doing what you want to do.' I was feeling sorry for myself," he said. "It 
was a combination of feeling I was being abandoned -- which was anything but 
the case looking back on it -- and thinking this was a perfect time for her to 
get some treatment for her disorder. So I was not happy, and I told her as 
much." 
</P>
<P>
Richard, who produced and arranged the Carpenters' long string of hits, also 
acknowledged that he felt threatened by Karen's teaming up with another 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm human and it did cross my mind that something could come out of this and 
just explode at which time I would be going through a number of emotions. I'd 
be happy for Karen because I always felt that she should have been in the Top 
5. On the other hand, being sensitive and feeling I'd done a good job for the 
Carpenters I would have been a little bit upset." 
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview from his New York office, producer Phil Ramone 
discussed his and Karen's objective on the album. "We were thinking two things: 
How do we make a record that doesn't sound like the Carpenters, and what could 
we say lyrically in these songs that has a more mature attitude?" 
</P>
<P>
The solo album included a spare, intimate reading of the sexually direct "Make 
Believe It's Your First Time" and a bluesy version of Paul Simon's "Still Crazy 
After All These Years" -- though Karen, mindful of her prim image -- had Simon 
change the line, "4 in the morning / crapped out / yawning" to the more demure 
"crashed out." 
</P>
<P>
"Karen was frustrated by the Goody Two-Shoes image, but she was torn," Ramone 
said. "She wanted to do try new things, but then she'd turn around and say, 
'We're going to do another Carpenters Christmas special.' I kept saying, 'The 
(Andy) Williams family even got past that one.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ramone still remembers the day in early 1980 when he and Karen played the album 
for Richard and A&amp;M founders Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss. 
</P>
<P>
"The silence was deafening," he said. "Richard didn't say much and still 
hasn't. He's accepted these songs kind of like stepchildren. Karen was always 
the sweetheart of A&amp;M, and Herb and Jerry reacted almost like it was their 
teen-age daughter I was messing with." 
</P>
<P>
Alpert, who wrote the liner notes to the Carpenters' debut album and found the 
team's breakthrough hit, "Close to You," declined to be interviewed for this 
story. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Carpenter remembers giving Karen a mixed, but essentially lukewarm, 
review of the solo project. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably said it was very nice," he said. "It certainly is well-produced and 
well-assembled. But some of it was disco, and I'm not a disco fan, and I 
thought she was singing a little bit too high on some of the songs." 
</P>
<P>
And Carpenter applied some not-so-subtle pressure on Karen by telling her how 
eager he was to begin work on the next Carpenters album. "I was much better by 
then and was kicking myself for what I had done to my life," he said. "So I 
mentioned that whenever she was ready, I was ready. I had all the tunes set to 
go." 
</P>
<P>
The deciding factor came when A&amp;M executives asked Karen and Ramone to go 
back into the studio to record a few more songs for the solo project. 
</P>
<P>
"It was up to Karen to decide if she wanted to spend more time on it or not," 
Richard said. "She didn't and that was that. I've gotten a lot of letters 
through the years since Karen passed on kind of accusing me of not releasing 
the solo album. It's not my doing at all. It's Karen's wishes I'm honoring." 
</P>
<P>
In a 1981 interview, Karen said that Richard's desire to get back to work took 
precedence over completing the solo project. But Karen added that she valued 
the solo experience. "It was fun cutting it and seeing that I could do all that 
-- sing a different type of tune and work with different people. I was scared 
to death beforehand. I basically knew one producer, one arranger, one studio, 
one record company and that was it. . . . I'm used to being part of a duo. 
Richard's like a third arm to me." 
</P>
<P>
Stung by the cool reception at the playback session, Ramone and Karen went to 
Mexico for a vacation. "I watched this girl disintegrate in front of me," 
Ramone said. "It was hard for her to express anger, but sometimes she'd be 
sitting there and she'd say, 'Why is this happening? What did I do wrong? 
Should we listen to the tape? Is it the mix?' " 
</P>
<P>
But Ramone said that Karen was ultimately proud of the album: "It was the first 
step to her standing on her own and also the last chance. 
</P>
<P>
"I truly believe that if she had made it through this she could have gone on to 
have a long career," Ramone said. "A lot of the pop songs and movie songs and 
duets of the '80s would have been hers. 
</P>
<P>
"A voice like Karen's -- rich, womanly -- comes along once every 20 years. 
Voices like that should have a chance to do a variety of things."

VLADIMIR HOROWITZ: AN APPRECIATION; 
</P>
<P>
FAME: THE PIANIST WAS A SYMBOL OF ENDLESS PRACTICE, SOLITARY STUDY, THE 
ESSENTIALLY LONELY PURSUIT OF PERFECTION THAT DOES NOT CEASE WITH SUCCESS.

There is a story, possibly not even apocryphal, about Groucho Marx attending a 
celebrity screening of a documentary about Artur Rubinstein, who was in 
attendance. Rubinstein asked Groucho how he liked the film. "I was a little 
disappointed," Groucho said. Rubinstein, who was very pleased with the film, 
asked why. "I always thought you played the fiddle," Groucho explained. 
</P>
<P>
Groucho knew well enough that Rubinstein was a pianist. Everybody did; that was 
the point. But Groucho always believed that a little deflation was good for the 
soul. The joke, which seemed to be on Groucho, had a kind of gentle double 
edge. 
</P>
<P>
What is true is that a handful of musical virtuosi acquire a fame that goes 
beyond the world of music to embrace those who don't know an arpeggio from an 
axle and don't much care. But they know the virtuosi as figures equally of 
romantic extravagance and monastic dedication. 
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein was one such figure, Jascha Heifetz was another, and so was Vladimir 
Horowitz, who died over the weekend and who was one of their shrinking 
pantheon. 
</P>
<P>
They are, or generally were, foreign and therefore exotic (domestic virtuosi 
have a harder time of it). Their auras were of the romantic temperament, a 
grandeur not far short of imperial and with impatience to match. As a 
stereotype, the long-haired musician has populated many a cartoon and many a 
B-movie. 
</P>
<P>
But beyond the plumages, the virtuoso has always had a subtler, deeper appeal, 
or so it has seemed to me. Anyone who has so much as touched a piano, a fiddle, 
even a guitar, knows what sweat sweet music demands. Taking piano, as we used 
to say, we discover in frustration how fast a simple scale exercise separates 
the have-talents from the have-nots, even at a low level of skill. 
</P>
<P>
The genius of the great musicians inspires awe, but it is also a given, the 
gift of God or DNA that allows eye, hands and head to collaborate as they do 
for few on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
But even the gift of genius needs work. And the virtuoso is, with all else, a 
walking symbol of endless practice, solitary study, the essentially lonely 
pursuit of perfection that does not cease with success. 
</P>
<P>
There is something enviable, appealing and exciting about the presence of 
perfection born of long devotion, and the art can be not only musical 
performance but the trapeze or juggling. We stand in awe of what it took to get 
where the artist is. 
</P>
<P>
Soon enough, the musical virtuosi's standards are only their own; they are 
beyond the shaping guidance of teachers and are performing out there where only 
they can identify their personal best. (The critics may confirm or deny what 
the artist feels, but even praise may not alleviate the cold fear that he or 
she is slipping.) 
</P>
<P>
In his last years, it is possible that Heifetz could have continued to enchant 
audiences with the cool elegance of his playing. But a shoulder ailment had 
taken away some of the virtuosity, and while he still played, it was in 
solitude where only he could hear the echoes of his own perfection. 
</P>
<P>
I heard Horowitz in person just once, at his legendary 50th anniversary concert 
at the Music Center. He was not the flamboyant virtuoso of legend but an 
unassuming, almost nondescript figure until his fingers touched the keyboard 
and the fire began. Then one heard what was in every sense the music of a 
lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
The passing of Vladimir Horowitz is a deep sadness; the world is diminished and 
even though the playing lives on in perfect reproduction, the matchless 
presence is beyond electronics. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible to wonder whether the unrelenting childhood discipline where 
virtuosity begins is still possible in a world of such countless distractions 
and such short-circuited attention spans. Yet, there are child prodigies of 
immense gifts and quite remarkable emotional precocity to be heard, for 
example, with the Young Musicians Foundation Orchestra in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
What is true is that tomorrow's virtuosi will be the more impressive because 
they will have had to resist the blandishments of their time to work with the 
fierce, Old World determination that let the in-born genius of Vladimir 
Horowitz reach all the world.

homemade 65-foot pirate ship and setting sail for the South Seas. Instead, he 
ended up with a shipwreck on Culver Boulevard Monday. The 26-ton galleon 
capsized on concrete at about 12:45 a.m. as it was being hauled by trailer from 
a Culver City boat storage yard, creating a massive morning rush-hour traffic

and guide the nation to independence from South Africa next year. The United 
Nations deployed 1,200 poll watchers in an effort to ensure a fair election. 
The South-West Africa People's Organization is expected to outpoll nine other 
parties in the vote. South Africans will be watching the election as a

shooting of his parents. For six years defense doctors have testified that 
Carlson has as many as eight separate personalities; doctors for the state have 
accused him of faking. Meanwhile, Carlson has been hospitalized at University

Sailor Kendall L. Truitt will share a $100,000 life insurance payment with the 
family of a crew mate who the Navy concluded probably had set off an explosion 
in a gun turret of the battleship Iowa that killed 47 men, Truitt's attorney 
said in Miami. Gunner's Mate Clayton M. Hartwig, who died in the April 19 
explosion, had named Truitt as beneficiary of the insurance policy, but payment 
was held up by claims filed by Hartwig's family. That impasse has been 
resolved, Truitt's attorney said, but he would not give details. He did say 
that part of the payment will be spent for a memorial to the Iowa's dead 
crewmen.

MAN DEAD, WIFE HURT AFTER CRASH WITH FLEEING YOUTH

SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 15-year-old youth being chased by police as he drove a stolen 
four-wheel-drive truck at 80 m.p.h. ran a red light early Monday and smashed 
broadside into a compact car that carried a Santa Ana couple, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The truck struck with such force, police said, that the couple inside the car 
were thrown onto the pavement at the intersection of Fairview and First 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Manuel Monroy-Barrales, 32, died shortly after the crash; his wife, 
Maria Garcia Calderon, 33, was critically injured. 
</P>
<P>
The youth -- whose name was withheld because he is a minor -- was treated for a 
minor head cut and taken to Juvenile Hall. He is being held on suspicion of 
murder, auto theft, possession of stolen property and evading a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
The collision ended a short pursuit in which police said the youth drove on the 
wrong side of Fairview before running the red light and striking 
Monroy-Barrales' 1980 Datsun. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Police Lt. Robert Helton said the incident began when an officer 
noticed a Toyota 4-Runner weaving in traffic at 3:45 a.m. while headed west on 
McFadden Avenue, near Raitt Street. 
</P>
<P>
When the driver apparently saw the officer behind him, he abruptly turned into 
the parking lot of a shopping center and speeded up in an apparent attempt to 
evade the officer, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
The officer was still behind the truckwhen it emerged northbound on Fairview, 
Helton said. The teen-ager then drove across a break in the median island and 
headed north in the southbound lanes. 
</P>
<P>
Helton said the officer radioed that he was pursuing but remained on the right 
side of the median in the northbound lanes. 
</P>
<P>
The youth speeded up to 80 m.p.h, Helton said, while the officer continued at a 
slower speed. 
</P>
<P>
Officers discovered that the vehicle driven by the youth had recently been 
stolen in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Monroy-Barrales died at United Western Medical Center-Santa Ana about two hours 
after the crash. His wife remained in critical condition after surgery Monday 
afternoon at UCI Medical Center in Orange.

MEASURE M DRIVE AT ROAD'S END; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: VOTERS WILL DECIDE TODAY WHETHER TO PAY A HALF-CENT SALES TAX TO 
IMPROVE COUNTY ROADS, AFTER AN EXPENSIVE CAMPAIGN. AND A NUMBER OF LOCAL 
ELECTIONS WILL BE DECIDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wooed by what almost surely will be the most expensive campaign in Orange 
County history, voters will decide today whether to pay a half-cent more in 
sales tax to help finance a 20-year plan to make the county's clogged roads and 
freeways more tolerable. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign contributions for Measure M, the transportation improvement plan, on 
Monday hit a near record $2.4 million, most from developers and building 
industry representatives. In the end, supporters say donations are expected to 
exceed the record set in the 1988 campaign against a countywide slow-growth 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Measure M, the transportation improvement plan, will be the only issue on the 
ballot for about 45% of the county's voters. But in several areas of the 
county, voters also will decide numerous school board races and a community 
college district election, determine the outcome of an incorporation effort in 
Laguna Niguel, consider removing gays from protection under the city of 
Irvine's Human Rights Ordinance, and determine the political future of a 
Fountain Valley councilman who was convicted for soliciting a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
With those issues and the countywide transportation measure on the ballot, 
Registrar of Voters Donald F. Tanney will not even venture a guess on how many 
of the county's 1.1 million registered voters will participate in the off-year 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, such elections yield a turnout of just 10% to 12% in Orange County. 
But Measure M proponents have mounted an expensive campaign that already has 
resulted in a record number of absentee ballots -- 27,000 had been received by 
Monday afternoon -- and Tanney has said that all bets are off on the ultimate 
turnout. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the measure -- which would raise about $3.1 billion over 20 years 
to pay for wider freeways and streets, transit projects and other 
transportation improvements -- are confident they will win if the turnout is 
around 20% or below. But if a quarter or more of the electorate casts ballots, 
Measure M proponents reckon that they will have the upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
To reach that goal, Citizens for Yes on M probably will end up raising well 
over $2.5 million, committee treasurer Dana W. Reed said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Receipts logged by Citizens for Yes on M reached the $2.4-million mark Monday. 
Before Election Day in June, 1988, the group opposing Measure A, the countywide 
slow-growth initiative, reported raising about $2 million. But they wound up 
with total receipts of $2,525,000 when post-election reports were filed. 
</P>
<P>
Once the election is over, Reed said Monday, his committee probably will top 
the figure for Measure A, thereby setting a new county record. 
</P>
<P>
"When you stop and think about it, our job was more expensive than theirs," 
Reed said. "They were campaigning against something, not asking people to tax 
themselves like Measure M does. Also, we have to spend more money on getting 
our vote out. In 1988, there was already higher turnout expected because it was 
a regular election. If we get less than a 20% turnout, we're dead." 
</P>
<P>
In Laguna Niguel, the focus of today's election will be Measure O, a referendum 
on cityhood. If a majority votes yes, the South County community of about 
40,000 would become Orange County's 29th city on Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Citizens for Cityhood volunteers were making telephone calls to 
voters, urging a big turnout. The group also will staff a telephone bank today 
and plans to have people standing on street corners with signs, reminding 
people to vote, said Denny Harris, a leader of the incorporation effort. 
</P>
<P>
There is no longer any organized opposition to cityhood in Laguna Niguel. A 
small group called Stop Cityhood folded last week, with its leaders announcing 
that they no longer had doubts about Laguna Niguel's economic viability as a 
city and were switching to the pro-cityhood side. 
</P>
<P>
Since every city needs a city council, Laguna Niguel voters also will be 
electing five council members from among 23 candidates Tuesday. The council 
members would be sworn in only if residents also give them a city to govern. 
</P>
<P>
Another measure -- P -- on today's ballot asks Laguna Niguel voters if they 
want to elect future council members citywide or by districts within the city. 
</P>
<P>
In Irvine, voters will decide a controversial measure that would remove 
protections for homosexuals from the city's Human Rights Ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 volunteers urging passage of Measure N hit the telephones Monday, 
running down lists of thousands of registered voters in the city. Opponents, 
meanwhile, were busy making signs urging people to vote and passing out 
literature at local shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
"At this late point, we're spending very little time educating people," said 
the Rev. Fred Plumer, a leader of the group trying to defeat Measure N. "We're 
just trying to clarify for people what their vote means -- that a no vote means 
the law stays intact. . . . It's amazing how much confusion there is out there 
over that." 
</P>
<P>
If passed, Measure N would repeal a section of the city's 15-month-old Human 
Rights Ordinance that bans discrimination against gays and lesbians. Its 
conservative supporters say the ordinance language legitimizes immorality, 
while critics say it is merely a protection of equal rights for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Voters in Irvine also will elect two Irvine Unified School District board 
members from the following six candidates: Genovica N. Balteanu; Ken Baxter, a 
hotel manager; William M. Dunkelberger, a salesman; Harbans Sraon, an educator, 
scientist and realtor; as well as incumbents Greg Smith and Margie Wakeham. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 61 candidates are vying for 25 positions in nine school and community 
college district board races. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen of those candidates are running to serve on the board of the Orange 
Unified School District, which has been rocked by a corruption scandal and 
labor disputes in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The final days of the race also provided some controversy, when the local 
teachers union, which had campaigned against incumbent Joe J. Cherry, 
complained that its telephone lines had been cut the weekend before the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone service to the teachers union, along with a rental car agency, golf 
repair shop and bread store housed in the same building, was out until about 1 
p.m. Monday, a union official said. Cherry has denied any involvement in the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
"The final two days of any campaign are always crucial," said Steve A. 
McDonald, executive director for the Orange Unified Education Assn. "Whoever is 
responsible knew we were running phone banks and that this was a very critical 
part of our office."

McDonald complained Monday that police had not initiated an investigation into 
the incident. But Orange Police Sgt. Arthur F. Romo said there was little 
authorities could do. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a nice clean cut, so it wasn't an accident," Romo said. But, he added, 
"unless we get a witness or someone tells us what happened, it's pretty much 
dead in the water." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Fountain Valley, City Councilman Fred Voss faces a recall 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Voss, a 52-year-old telephone systems manager, was arrested by Santa Ana police 
in January after offering $20 to an undercover officer disguised as a 
prostitute. He pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of soliciting a 
prostitute, was fined $300 and sentenced to three years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
Voss resigned his post of mayor in the furor that followed the incident but 
refused to relinquish his City Council post. 
</P>
<P>
By July, outraged local residents had submitted the 7,000 signatures needed to 
qualify the recall of Voss for the ballot.

<P>
County voters will go to polling places today to cast ballots on varied 
countywide and local issues, as well as school district races. 
</P>
<P>
* Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
* For poll information, call the registrar of voters at (714) 567-7600.

<P>
ON THE BALLOT 
</P>
<P>
Measure M, the proposed sales tax for transportation projects, is the only 
countywide issue facing all 1.15 million registered voters in today's election, 
but more than a fourth of Orange County's voters also will have a chance to 
decide school board races, cityhood and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
Elections in Orange County today: 
</P>
<P>
Countywide: Measure M, a half-cent sales tax increase to pay for an estimated 
$3.1 billion in traffic improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine: Measure N, an initiative sponsored by anti-gay-rights activists seeking 
to remove homosexuals from protection under the city's Human Rights Ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel: Measure O, a cityhood proposal for residents who now live in an 
unincorporated area administered by the county. Also on the area ballot is 
Measure P, which asks voters to decide whether City Council members should be 
elected by district or at-large, if a majority of voters approve cityhood. 
Voters also will be asked to choose five City Council members from among 23 
candidates. In addition, residents will be asked to vote for two incumbents to 
continue serving on the Laguna Niguel Community Services District, should 
cityhood fail. 
</P>
<P>
La Palma: Voters will consider Measure Q, a proposed 4% utility users tax, to 
raise money for the city's general fund and the Police and Recreation 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach: Measure R would authorize the city to extend for 10 years the 
current lease on property at Coast Highway and Newport Boulevard to encourage 
private redevelopment of the site. The current lease to private businesses 
there expires in 2008. Also in Newport Beach, voters will consider Measure S, 
which would allow the sale of an unused, vacant, $350,000 city-owned lot on 
River Avenue to raise money for libraries and parks. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley: Voters will decide whether to recall City Councilman Fred 
Voss, who was arrested last January for soliciting sex from an undercover 
police officer during a crackdown on prostitution. Voters also will decide 
whether Voss' successor shall be elected or appointed if the recall is 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
Voters will elect two trustees each in the Coast Community College District and 
Garden Grove Unified, Irvine Unified and Santa Ana Unified school districts. 
</P>
<P>
Three trustees each will be selected in the Newport-Mesa Unified, Huntington 
Beach Union High, Anaheim City and Lowell Joint school districts. 
</P>
<P>
In the Orange Unified School District, voters will choose four trustees to 
serve four-year terms, and one to fill the remaining two years of an unexpired 
term. 
</P>
<P>
Voters will elect four trustees in the Silverado-Modjeska Park and Recreation 
District. 
</P>
<P>
Property owners in the Los Alisos Water District will choose two directors from 
among three candidates. The district includes parts of Lake Forest and El Toro, 
and landowners cast one vote for each dollar of their assessed property value 
by mail-in ballot.

Orange County eighth-graders showed significant improvement in California 
Assessment Program results released Monday, but scores fell for third- and 
sixth-graders, according to local educators and the California Department of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
"The scores are kind of a mixed bag," conceded Bruce Givner, the Irvine Unified 
School District's deputy superintendent for support services. "In Irvine, 
they've remained consistently high for the past several years, but we did see 
some slight declines." 
</P>
<P>
Those remarks were echoed countywide, as educators hailed the junior high 
school results while at the same time puzzling over the declines by younger 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's mixed results paralleled scores statewide. State Supt. of 
Public Instruction Bill Honig, who announced the findings Monday morning, 
combined his accolades for junior high school programs with concerns about the 
dip in scores by younger children. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get a handle on the reasons for this decline," Honig said of 
the statewide third- and sixth-grade results. 
</P>
<P>
In tests administered last spring, eighth-graders made across-the-board 
improvements over the scores students at that grade level had achieved the year 
before. The statewide average in reading was 256, up four points; in math, the 
average went up five points to 269; in history and social studies, it climbed 
six points to 259, and in science, the average score rose to 267, a four-point 
gain. 
</P>
<P>
For third-graders, the statewide average in reading scores slid to 277, down 
five points from last year's 282. Written language scores fell six points to 
278, while math scores dipped three points to 278. 
</P>
<P>
Sixth-graders averaged 262 in reading scores, a three-point decline; 269 in 
written language, a drop of four points, and 267 in math, down three points. 
</P>
<P>
The state also released Monday the average test scores for eighth-graders in 
the state's larger districts. The figures -- which combine all four test areas 
-- included changes from last year and the average change over the last three 
years. The state average was 263, up five points over last year and up 16 since 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
The scores -- used to measure the performance of schools, not that of 
individual students -- remained well above the national averages and above 
California scores from several years ago, Honig said. The tests have a possible 
500 points, but generally range from 100 to 400. 
</P>
<P>
Although the state did not release a county-by-county breakdown for third- and 
sixth-grade scores Monday, those figures, as well as the results for individual 
schools, will be made public later this week. 
</P>
<P>
Some state and Orange County educators who have already reviewed their schools' 
test scores indicated that the county appears to track the statewide returns. 
</P>
<P>
"They almost exactly mirror the state," said Patrick J. McCabe, administrator 
of operations for CAP. "They're down three to five points in reading and math, 
which is almost exactly the drop in the state figures." 
</P>
<P>
Although cautioning against reading too much into a single year's sample, 
several educators said they were in the process of reviewing the numbers to 
decide whether curriculum changes are warranted. 
</P>
<P>
Vergil Hettick, director of research and evaluation for Santa Ana Unified 
School District, said the scores would "help us target schools that need help. 
That's what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Unified, the county's largest school district with about 42,000 
students, has often finished near the bottom of the pack among Orange County 
school districts on the CAP results, mainly because the district has a large 
percentage of students with limited proficiency in English. Those students 
often struggle with standardized tests in English, particularly the reading and 
written-language portions, Hettick said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Santa Ana's latest CAP scores rank the district below others in Orange 
County, Santa Ana third-graders and eighth-graders did better than last year, 
educators said, earning the district praise from state and county officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Ana is an excellent example of a district that is doing everything it 
can with the language-proficiency issue," said Fred Lange, director of 
instructional services for the Orange County Education Department. 
</P>
<P>
"Just holding your own under those circumstances has got to be a challenge, 
much less gaining," McCabe added. Large numbers of young students with limited 
English entered California schools last year, he added, so many that more than 
37% of the state's third-graders did not speak English as their native 
language, a factor that several officials blamed for holding down test scores 
in the lower grades. 
</P>
<P>
The huge Los Angeles Unified School District, which contains 15% of the state's 
students, averaged 219, showing a one-year growth of six points and a 
three-year growth of nine. While the district remains well below the state 
average, its gains are nonetheless substantial, McCabe said. 
</P>
<P>
Honig credited the state's "deliberate, planned 'attack' " on junior high 
school deficiencies since 1986 with bringing up statewide scores. A task force 
reviewing the state's junior high schools called for sweeping reforms several 
years ago, and Honig credited the group with ushering in improvements that are 
reflected in the recent test scores. 
</P>
<P>
Honig, who noted that the average Japanese eighth-grader was two years ahead of 
an American eighth-grader in 1986, said the improvements have made California 
students better-prepared. After three years of intensive state attention to 
junior high school education, "we shaved 25% off that gap," he said. "If we 
continue progress at this rate for the next decade, we will close the gap." 
</P>
<P>
The performance of U.S. school graduates has been a source of increasing 
consternation among many business leaders, who fear that Americans are not 
well-prepared to compete in world markets. 
</P>
<P>
The CAP tests have been administered each spring since 1974 to the state's 
third-, sixth- and eighth-graders. High school seniors take the tests each 
fall, and the results are released in the spring. Educators said that declines 
in the third- and sixth-grade scores in part may be due to several peripheral 
factors. In particular, they said the fact that the tests used in those grades 
are several years old may mean that the tests no longer accurately challenge 
what is being taught in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Honig also said some teachers may have overreacted to a cheating scandal that 
tainted the CAP system two years ago. Some test monitors may have prohibited 
students from changing answers, he said, thus preventing them from correcting 
their own mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
Several Orange County districts confirmed that their third- and sixth-grade 
scores had dipped along with the state average, but those declines were matched 
by marked increases in eighth-grade results. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View Elementary and Orange Unified school districts registered the 
county's largest gains in the results released Monday, both increasing by 12 
points. Placentia Unified School District and Los Alamitos Unified School 
District jumped 10 and nine points, respectively, and Irvine Unified School 
District increased by nine points, bringing its average eighth-grade score to 
330 points, the highest in the county. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, eighth-graders averaged seven points better on the current tests 
compared to last year's. 
</P>
<P>
Only Fullerton Elementary School District showed a lower score among 
eighth-graders, and it dipped by only one point. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no statistical significance to that," Assistant Supt. Ron Bennett 
said, adding that CAP scores can misrepresent district's educational progress 
by placing too much emphasis on a few wayward scores, skewing a small 
district's average.

NEW PRO-CHOICE GROUP TO CENTER ON CANDIDATES; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: LARGELY REPUBLICAN ORGANIZATION FORMS WITH EXCLUSIVE AIM OF ELECTING 
CANDIDATES WHO SUPPORT WOMEN'S RIGHT TO ABORTION. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A group of pro-choice Republicans gathered here Monday in what sponsors called 
the county's first meeting of its kind to unveil a new organization aimed 
exclusively at electing state and federal politicians who support a woman's 
right to choose an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Tricia Hunter, the pro-choice Republican whose upset Assembly victory in San 
Diego last month gained national attention, rallied the standing-room-only 
audience with the message that most Republican voters support choice on 
abortion and that choice is consistent with the party's values. 
</P>
<P>
"The Republican Party philosophy has always been to keep government out of 
personal decisions," Hunter said. "I was the mainstream Republican; I was the 
one who was in sync with my district." 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim), who reversed his position and announced in 
September that he will support choice on abortion, also joined the meeting of 
about 150 people at the Balboa Bay Club. Seymour is running for lieutenant 
governor against state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who holds that 
abortions should be illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsors said the new organization -- Pro-Choice Orange County -- will be 
bipartisan in its support of candidates and membership. However, because all 
but one of the county's state and federal officeholders are Republican, the 
group's leaders said they will work hard to find pro-choice Republican 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Schwarz, a Democrat and chairwoman of the group, said the leaders have 
not decided which races they will target next year. Several factors are under 
consideration, including these: 
</P>
<P>
* A special election will be held, probably in March, for the seat of state 
Sen. William Campbell, (R-Hacienda Heights), who will resign in January. On 
Monday, pro-choice Republican Ron Isles, a Brea councilman, announced that he 
will enter the race. Two assemblymen who hold that abortion should be illegal 
have already announced their interest -- Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) and 
Frank Hill (R-Whittier). 
</P>
<P>
* Ferguson's 70th Assembly District seat will be on the primary ballot in June. 
The pro-choice leaders said they may try to find a sympathetic Republican to 
run against him. 
</P>
<P>
* Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) is one of eight politicians 
nationally who have been targeted for opposition by the National Abortion 
Rights Action League. Pringle narrowly beat a Democrat to win his first 
election last year in a race made controversial by the county Republican 
Party's hiring of uniformed security guards at several predominantly Latino 
polling places. 
</P>
<P>
* The pro-choice leaders said they have heard rumors that abortion opponent 
Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) might not seek re-election next year. 
But an aide to the congressman said Monday, "That's probably a wonderful dream 
for them, but there's no reality to it." 
</P>
<P>
Pro-Choice Orange County was formed in answer to the U.S. Supreme Court's 
Webster decision in July, giving states new authority to restrict abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The group's political strength is untested, but since the Webster decision, 
pro-choice forces have gained national momentum that has caused many 
politicians to rethink or modify their positions. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's otherwise-obscure race was watched nationally as one of the first 
tests of fallout from the court's decision. Campaigning on abortion rights, 
Hunter defeated the Republican candidate who had been leading, Dick Lyles, in 
the primary. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have tremendous potential," said Schwarz, Pro-Choice Orange 
County's chairwoman. "Even though we have our work cut out for us in Orange 
County, I think we're going to see this change." 
</P>
<P>
A score card placed near the speaker's podium Monday showed that in the state 
Senate, 19 legislators favor choice on abortion; 16 hold that it should be 
illegal and five have not declared positions. In the Assembly, the group 
reported 38 legislators supporting choice, 29 opposed and 13 unannounced. 
</P>
<P>
John Rau, former director of the county's Republican Lincoln Club, told the 
audience: "Our party should not be dominated by a minority and their personal 
religious beliefs. We should not be giving this issue away to the Democrats. It 
could make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
Isles, who also attended the pro-choice breakfast Monday, said his state Senate 
race against Ferguson and Hill next spring could be a repeat of Hunter's San 
Diego upset. 
</P>
<P>
Because it is a special election to fill a vacancy -- as was Hunter's -- 
campaign laws allow Democrats to cross over and vote for Republican candidates, 
a factor that played a role in Hunter's win. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (choice) is probably going to be a big issue," Isles said. "You can't 
ignore it, it's already there." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Ferguson acknowledged that "if the issue is emotional enough, a 
single issue can win." 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, he does not expect the outside interest in the Senate race that 
there was in Hunter's. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried about it, and I don't think it will be a problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Schwarz said of Ferguson: "I'd like him to be very concerned."

NEW MEDFLY INFESTATION FOUND; MORE SPRAYING SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON and STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even before the first drops of malathion fell over parts of the San Fernando 
Valley on Monday night to fight the county's worst Mediterranean fruit fly 
infestation, officials reported finding more of the crop-destroying pests, 
requiring aerial spraying of a new area of the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest infestation -- the county's fifth this year -- spraying was 
ordered for Thursday night over 12 square miles encompassing Rosemead and South 
El Monte, where two Medflies were found over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
That brought to 131 the number of Medflies found in the county this year, 
according to officials. They have ordered aerial spraying of a total of 75 
square miles for all five infestations and released more than 100-million 
sterile flies to breed the insect out of existence. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the unprecedented number of infestations has caused no major problems 
for the state's billion-dollar agricultural industry because the vast majority 
of the state's produce is grown outside the county, a California Farm Bureau 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
But officials said they are worried about other countries, especially Japan, 
placing California produce under quarantine. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting real ticklish," Deputy County Agricultural Commissioner Bob 
Atkins said. "The Japanese are looking very warily at what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
"The most serious threat to agriculture is the possibility of foreign 
quarantine," said David Keim, plant protection and quarantine officer for the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Although a large part of the county is under quarantine -- prohibiting the 
removal of locally grown fruit and vegetables from infested areas -- crops from 
growing areas to the north can be transported through infested areas to the 
downtown Los Angeles produce market in covered trucks or at night when the pest 
is inactive. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very nervous," the Farm Bureau spokesman said. "Every time we have an 
infestation, it creates the opportunity for the pests to get out into some of 
the agricultural areas of California." 
</P>
<P>
Asked for comment on the latest find, Susan Trowbridge, a press spokeswoman for 
Gov. George Deukmejian, said, "We never like to see Medflies. We will do all 
that we can as quickly as we can to take care of the problem. The Department of 
Food and Agriculture is monitoring the situation and will take necessary action 
to eliminate the Medflies as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Medflies lay their eggs in more than 260 varieties of fruits and vegetables, 
rendering the produce unsalable. The pest is established in Hawaii, parts of 
Central and South America, southern Europe and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal scientists blame the regions's five infestations on illegally 
smuggled "dirty fruit," -- citrus contaminated with Medfly eggs or larva. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists say the area's numerous airports, proximity to the Mexican border 
and large immigrant population provide easy entrance for the pest. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that the fruit fly problem in L.A. is a people problem. People are the 
source of these infestations," said Roy Cunningham, of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture in Hawaii, one of the nation's leading Medfly entomologists. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe that four of the five infestations are independent finds and 
not the result of natural dispersement. During its lifetime, the Medfly only 
travels several hundred yards from it birthplace, and it is not possible for 
the insect to fly throughout Los Angeles on its own. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose its outright smuggling," Keim said, pointing out that inspectors 
have confiscated hundreds of pounds of illegally imported moman, a popular 
fruit in Latin America that is in great demand in Latino neighborhoods in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Keim said that ports of entry into the United States are "well covered." He 
pointed out that dogs are stationed at airports to sniff for fruits and 
vegetables in the suitcases of arriving passengers. 
</P>
<P>
"When people come through the regular ports of entry, we feel we are doing a 
pretty good job of picking up fruits and vegetables," he said. 
</P>
<P>
State officials plan to begin offering a $10,000 reward, donated by the 
agriculture industry, for the conviction of a person "who sneaked in fruit and 
thereby caused an infestation," a state Food and Agriculture spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is becoming far too frequent," Los Angeles County Agricultural 
Commissioner Leon Spaugy said. "We have a problem. We have a seeming disregard 
for the quarantines. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . We always stress the importance of not taking home-grown fruit to Aunt 
May's or someone else's outside the quarantine area," he said. "But we still 
have a number of people who -- either deliberately or through ignorance -- are 
taking fruit outside the area. And there is always the distinct possibility 
that it will start an infestation." 
</P>
<P>
Battling the infestation costs between $1 million and $2 million in each area, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two helicopters loaded with malathion lifted off from Van Nuys Airport at 9 
p.m. Monday to begin the valley spraying operation, which was expected to take 
up to six hours to complete. 
</P>
<P>
In the new area to be sprayed Thursday night, California Conservation Corps 
members will today begin distributing 100,000 flyers to residents advising of 
the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
The area to be sprayed is bounded by the Pomona Freeway, Garfield and Santa 
Anita avenues and Valley Boulevard. The boundaries could be expanded if a fly 
trapped Monday, just north of the proposed spray zone, is confirmed to be a 
Medfly, authorities said.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HUMPERDINCK LAWSUIT AGAINST PAPER DISMISSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge in Los Angeles has dismissed a $50-million lawsuit brought by 
Engelbert Humperdinck against The National Enquirer, which reported that the 
mother of the singer's daughter feared he had the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Consuelo B. Marshall dismissed the libel lawsuit last week, 
said Humperdinck's attorney, Robert Rotstein. Rotstein said Humperdinck would 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Humperdinck, 53, has tested negative for the virus that causes acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome, Rotstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Walker, a National Enquirer editor, said Monday that the Lantana, 
Fla.-based newspaper stood behind the article, which he said was based on a 
court filing and was therefor not libelous. 
</P>
<P>
Humperdinck claimed the Enquirer's story, which ran Dec. 27, 1988, was false 
and malicious.

BUILDERS START WORK ON HOMELESS PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kicking off Homeless Awareness Week, a builders' group Monday launched a 
program to provide new and renovated housing for Orange County's homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Workers began renovating the first of five structures in the HomeAid program, 
run by the Orange County Building Industry Assn., which solicits financial 
contributions and donations of labor and materials. 
</P>
<P>
The work will transform a run-down, low-rent apartment complex in the 12000 
block of Keel Avenue in Garden Grove into a shelter for 20 persons. 
</P>
<P>
The project will force 86 current tenants to move. The city of Garden Grove is 
providing relocation assistance, in either lump sums or rent subsidies, to 
those who are displaced. 
</P>
<P>
Program funds are used to provide not only housing facilities but food, 
clothing, counseling and other services for those who need shelter for up to 
three months. 
</P>
<P>
Other Orange County facilities scheduled for renovation starting this week 
include the Interval House, Midway City; Fullerton Interfaith/New Vista 
Shelter, Fulllerton; El Modena House, El Modena, and the Anchor House in San 
Clemente. JAMES ROBBINS

NEW SIGN-CODE RULES WILL BE CONSIDERED

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council will consider four amendments to the city's sign codes for 
commercial businesses tonight in an attempt to keep up with rapid development 
in the city, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendments would "provide ample advertising for businesses but 
avoid too much clutter," City Manager Frank Benest said. 
</P>
<P>
"The new code will establish the various sizes of signs depending on the amount 
of street frontage available," senior planner Pat Shoemaker said. Signs will be 
limited according to the size of the businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Although the codes will "provide for some flexibility," they will also require 
developers and businesses to submit proposals to the city before erecting 
anything, Shoemaker said. 
</P>
<P>
The amendments, which address commercial and industrial developments, were 
passed unanimously by the Planning Commission in September.JENNIFER MOULTON

DEPOT RESTAURANT LEASE APPROVAL DUE

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council is expected to ratify a seven-year lease today with a new 
operator for a restaurant and bar in the 94-year-old Capistrano Depot. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal to the Community Redevelopment Agency from City Manager Stephen B. 
Julian would have Trackside Dining Inc. take over the business in the aging 
train station which the city bought two years ago for $910,000. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the proposed lease, which has two, seven-year renewable options, start 
at 4% of gross sales for the first year, with a minimum monthly rent of $3,500. 
Rent would increase in the second year to 5% of gross sales with a $6,000 
monthly minimum. For the remaining five years, rent would be 6% of sales, with 
an $8,000 monthly minimum, according to Julian's report. 
</P>
<P>
One of four finalists in the city's two-year search, Trackside Dining consists 
of a partnership between Utah restaurant manager Peter Henderson, and Orange 
County building contractors Eric Hooykaas and Stephen Dahle. The company owns a 
cafe in a former railroad station in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said that once the agreement is final, he would shut the depot in 
January for five months to refurbish the interior and to comply with a city- 
funded asbestos removal project. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that sold me to the property was the architecture," Henderson said 
of the quaint, Victorian-style brick station covered with thick bougainvillea 
bushes. 
</P>
<P>
The station was built in 1895 by the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway 
Co. as a stop between San Diego and Los Angeles. It now serves several hundred 
Amtrak commuters on 16 daily trains along that same route. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, the little-used station was boarded up by the railroad. Brothers 
Jim and Pete Tyson bought it and opened a restaurant in 1975 and continued to 
operate it after the city bought it. Their contract expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started here as a busboy, we used to have to take a flag and run 
up and down the tracks for 250 yards to get the train to stop," said restaurant 
manager Jim Conter, a 14-year employee. WENDY PAULSON

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL BOARD FREEZES SPENDING IN 4 AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with deep budget cuts next year, the Los Angeles Board of Education 
agreed Monday to immediately freeze spending in four areas. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed by Board Member Roberta Weintraub, the freeze prohibits hiring of some 
outside consultants and spending on new programs, unless cuts are made in other 
areas to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
It also requires that regional and central office job vacancies be left vacant 
unless approved by a special district freeze committee, and bars job 
reclassifications that require salary increases. 
</P>
<P>
The freezes could save less than $1 million this year, far short of the $115 
million to $180 million in spending reductions that may be necessary in the 
1990-91 budget, financial experts say.

MANSON'S EX-LAWYER HAS TO BE RESTRAINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Manson's one-time defense attorney was ordered to undergo psychiatric 
evaluation Monday after the Irvine lawyer burst through a security door into 
the Los Angeles County district attorney's office and resisted police officers 
who tried to remove him, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Irving A. Kanarek was taken to Los Angeles County Harbor-UCLA Medical Center 
after the unexplained outburst in the Torrance district attorney's office about 
8 a.m., Torrance police said. Hospital officials declined to describe Kanarek's 
condition or to confirm that he had been admitted. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred as the State Bar of California prepared to take control 
of Kanarek's practice in Orange County after the veteran criminal defense 
lawyer said that personal problems made it impossible for him to practice law, 
a State Bar spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The 69-year-old lawyer gained acclaim when he represented Manson at his trial 
in 1970 and 1971 for the murder of actress Sharon Tate and six others. Kanarek 
also defended Jimmy Lee Smith, one of two men convicted in the celebrated 
killing of a Los Angeles police officer in an onion field near Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
After rushing through a security door that had been opened for an employee, 
Kanarek burst into the office of Deputy Dist. Atty. Jim Pregerson, authorities 
said. "He just said, 'Pregerson, Pregerson! Help me!' There was some urgency in 
his voice," said Pregerson, who had tried a case against Kanarek more than 20 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Kanarek was arrested after he refused demands by police and sheriff's deputies 
to leave the building. 
</P>
<P>
"He is terribly upset by a devastating divorce," said George Denny, Kanarek's 
attorney. "He has two small children and is terribly distressed over what has 
occurred in his life at this point."

UCI RADIO TO MARK ITS 20TH YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHERINE MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty years ago, KUCI, UC Irvine's student-run radio station, was born. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Sunday, the station will celebrate its 20th anniversary with a week 
of special programming and reminiscing, with KUCI alumni serving as guest disc 
jockeys from about 6 p.m. to midnight, Monday through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the alumni have stayed in touch through the KUCI newsletter and through 
personal contact, keeping alive memorable events in the station's 20-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
"I love that place. That place gave me everything," said Sue Simone, a former 
KUCI general manager and now the national sales director for Disctronics Inc. 
</P>
<P>
KUCI alumni, she said, have "taken it upon ourselves to be like the old ancient 
Indians who pass all the myths down verbally, but you just keep passing it from 
generation to generation. . . . For 20 years that has continued and, still, 
(the current) management can recite the whole history of the station and it's a 
wonderful thing." 
</P>
<P>
It was during Simone's stint as general manager that KUCI almost went dark. 
</P>
<P>
In the winter quarter of the 1981-82 school year, the Federal Communications 
Commission allowed radio station KCRW, which shared KUCI's frequency, to 
increase its power. KUCI, operating under 10 watts of power, was easily 
overcome by KCRW. Simone remembers it vividly. 
</P>
<P>
"That midnight I got a call from the person on the air. They couldn't pick up 
the station in the studio . . . all of a sudden, everything stopped that day," 
Simone said. 
</P>
<P>
Intent on keeping the station alive, Simone began a campaign to persuade the 
FCC to change KUCI's frequency. Three months later, the station changed from 
89.9 to 88.9 FM, ensuring its survival. 
</P>
<P>
"The inspiration at the staff level today is a direct reflection of the spirit 
that we had to bring the station back on the air," Simone said. "And it's 10 
times better than it was then." 
</P>
<P>
Another former station manager, Nick Roman, remembered 1974 when 15 students 
ran naked across campus -- a fad called "streaking" -- and when Edmund G. Brown 
Jr., debating Houston Flournoy on campus in their campaign for governor, 
refused to allow KUCI to broadcast the debate live. 
</P>
<P>
Former general manager Mike Duffy, who worked at the station from 1981 to about 
1987, also had his share of memorable events, which included continuing his 
show during a few earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to hold tight and hope," Duffy said. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the anniversary week, a banquet will be held in the Bren Events 
Center on the UCI campus for alumni and campus representatives, followed by a 
reception which is open to all on campus. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we've been on the air for 20 years, we're trying to make the people more 
aware" of the station's history and role at UC Irvine, Danielle Michaelis, the 
current general manager, said. KATHERINE MARTINEZ

COALITION REVIVES INCORPORATION EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As voters in Laguna Niguel cast their ballots for cityhood today, a group of 
residents here is quietly reviving a once-controversial plan to carve a city 
out of a wide county-controlled area in the Saddleback Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by a survey that suggests there may be strong interest in 
incorporating El Toro, Lake Forest and Portola Hills, some residents have 
formed the Community Coalition and hope to take their case to the county's 
Local Agency Formation Commission in January. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Wilson, president of the new pro-city group and a leader of last year's 
unsuccessful Saddleback Valley cityhood effort, said the informal survey, 
conducted by a private market research firm, was completed in August. 
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that more than 50% of 202 people surveyed in random 
interviews at local shopping centers favored incorporation, Wilson said. 
Another 30% said they were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Last November's measure, which would have incorporated El Toro, Lake Forest, 
Laguna Hills and Aegean Hills, was rejected 2 to 1, largely because of 
campaigning by Laguna Hills community leaders who wanted to form their own 
city. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson and other residents of the El Toro and Lake Forest communities said 
in recent interviews that excluding Laguna Hills from the new cityhood plan may 
give them the edge they need. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt real comfortable that this (result) was a good representation of the 
(El Toro-Lake Forest) community," said Wilson, who campaigned for a council 
seat during the Saddleback Valley election. "We were just looking to see what 
the community sentiment was." 
</P>
<P>
The new city also would encompass the yet-to-be-built Foothills Ranch Planned 
Community, which would include 2,200 homes, an industrial complex and a 
commercial center between Portola Hills and El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
The Community Coalition has paid an Oceanside accounting firm $7,500 for a 
financial report to determine whether the new city could survive, Wilson said. 
The report is required by LAFCO as part of a cityhood application. 
</P>
<P>
The group also must gather signatures from 25% of the 28,000 registered voters 
in the proposed city boundaries. Wilson said the group plans to collect 8,000 
signatures in the petition drive, expected to begin in January. 
</P>
<P>
The group, she said, hopes to have the cityhood question on the November, 1990, 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Christiansen, who is conducting the financial study, said he hasn't 
reached a conclusion on the financial viability of the proposed city. 
Christiansen also conducted the feasibility study for Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
But Wilson said informal studies have suggested that the city could collect 
$3.5 million in sales tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The incorporation effort may be hardest fought by residents of Portola Hills, 
an isolated neighborhood that often affiliates itself more with rural Trabuco 
Canyon than with El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and other pro-city leaders met strong opposition at an Oct. 23 meeting 
with members of the Portola Hills Homeowners Assn. The level of opposition, 
Wilson said, could match the fervor of Laguna Hills residents in the previous 
incorporation effort. JAMES M. GOMEZ

43% FEEL BUSINESS SHOULD FOOT BILL FOR CLEAN AIR, POLL FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new poll commissioned by business interests in the state has found that 43% 
of Southern Californians believe business and industry, more than individual 
consumers, should pay for cleaning up the air. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, nearly 60% of those polled said they would support air pollution 
controls even if it meant banning certain businesses and industries from the 
basin that comprises Los Angeles, Riverside, Orange and San Bernardino 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Southern Californians appeared to be so disturbed by smog that 58% said 
they had seriously considered moving out of region during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted at a time when business and industry are facing costly 
new air pollution controls as part of the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District's 20-year plan to bring the region into compliance with federal clean 
air standards. Before the plan was adopted earlier this year, opponents 
repeatedly had warned that it would drive businesses and jobs out of the basin. 
</P>
<P>
Results of the survey, which was conducted by the Wirthlin Group, a public 
opinion pollster, were released Monday at a forum sponsored jointly by Hitachi 
Ltd. and the California and Los Angeles Area chambers of commerce. Financed by 
Hitachi, the telephone poll was conducted in September among 400 respondents. 
</P>
<P>
The findings were seized upon immediately by air quality officials as proof of 
public support for the AQMD's tough new anti-smog controls. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were a member of business, I would be concerned," said AQMD Executive 
Officer James M. Lents. "They need to realize the public is supportive of 
cleaning up the air and the public is supportive of us cleaning up business." 
</P>
<P>
But one top-ranking chamber official said there was no reason for "any great 
apprehension." 
</P>
<P>
"Business is already paying very substantially for cleaning up the air and is 
anticipating paying even more," said Kirk West, president of the California 
Chamber of Commerce. Ray Remy, president of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of 
Commerce, voiced similar views. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of those polled said they would be willing to make certain 
changes in life styles such as car-pooling or riding public transit if it were 
available, fewer than half said they would abide by regulations that outlawed 
back-yard barbecues, aerosol sprays and gasoline-powered lawn mowers. 
</P>
<P>
When they were asked who should be "most responsible" for paying to clean up 
the air, 43% answered major industry, 22% state government, 14% federal 
government, 10% consumers and 5% local government. 
</P>
<P>
When asked which steps they would be "most willing" to take to reduce smog, 25% 
said car-pooling and 24% said using public transit if it were available. 
Another 18% said they would drive vehicles powered by cleaner alternative fuels 
and 18% said they would work flexible hours to reduce traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
But only 9% said they supported increases in taxes or fees to pay for air 
pollution controls. 
</P>
<P>
While the AQMD is not calling for a ban on back-yard barbecues and aerosol 
sprays, there is a perception -- based largely on statements by opponents to 
the air quality plan -- that such restrictions are being contemplated. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if they would follow a law banning back-yard barbecues, aerosol 
sprays and gasoline-powered lawn mowers, 46% said they would abide completely 
by the rule, 43% said they would partially abide, and 9% said they would 
completely ignore the restriction. Another 3% had no opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Based on that finding, Jack Torobin, manager of the Wirthlin Group's Los 
Angeles office, told a press conference: "There is a level of inflexibility we 
probably did not expect to see." 
</P>
<P>
Torobin said later, however, that the willingness among those polled to 
car-pool or use public transit was encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
"The interesting angle here is the fact that we're not totally wedded to our 
cars or existing systems of transportation. There's some flexibility there. . . 
. People see transportation solutions as a way out of the (smog) problem," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, 57% said they would support increasing the gasoline tax 5 cents 
a gallon -- provided the money was earmarked for transportation and highway 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Torobin called the 58% of residents who had seriously thought about leaving the 
Los Angeles area during the past year "sizable." A similar poll conducted in 
the San Francisco Bay Area before the recent earthquake found that only 34% had 
considered leaving, principally because of housing costs. 
</P>
<P>
But even though many had thought of leaving, 65% of those polled believed their 
overall quality of life was good. Among those, 16% said the quality of life was 
very good and 49% said it was somewhat good. 
</P>
<P>
The margin of error in the poll was 5% in either direction, Torobin said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Last March, the South Coast Air Quality Management District approved a 
far-reaching clean air plan for the Los Angeles Basin that is intended to bring 
the four-county region of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties into compliance with federal clean air standards by the year 2007. The 
plan envisions more than 120 different air pollution controls on industry, 
consumer products and motor vehicles. Business interests have worried that the 
plan will be too stringent and will cost as much as $12.8 billion a year, 
driving out jobs and businesses. That point has been vigorously disputed by the 
AQMD, which has estimated compliance costs at $2.9 billion a year for the first 
five years. The AQMD also has said the plan will bring 80,200 more jobs into 
the region by 2007.

FBI LOOKING FOR S&amp;L-ARSON TIE, LAWMAKER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State officials disclosed Monday that the FBI has joined their investigation of 
an arson fire in a state-leased office building in Los Angeles that housed 
regulatory files relating to the troubled Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin (D-Fremont), chairman of the Assembly Committee on 
Government Efficiency and Consumer Protection, said federal agents are 
apparently interested in determining if the fire was connected to the "savings 
and loan scandal in California." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the FBI said the agency would neither confirm nor deny its 
involvement in any investigation of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
The March 2 blaze, which began on the 15th floor of the CNA building at 600 S. 
Commonwealth Ave., loosened asbestos throughout several upper floors in the 
structure, forcing state employees to evacuate their offices. At the time, the 
Savings and Loan Department, the Corporations Department, the Banking 
Department and the governor were leasing space in the building. 
</P>
<P>
Contaminated as a result of the fire were boxes of files relating to 
Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, the financially distressed thrift that 
was seized by federal regulators last April 14. The seizure came one day after 
its parent company, American Continental Corp., filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
In an Oct. 30 letter to Eastin, David Walizer, chief deputy state fire marshal, 
said investigators have determined the fire was arson and that they expect to 
present evidence about their prime suspect to the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office in the next few days. He also noted that the FBI is involved 
in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unknown if the suspect was acting alone or in concert with other 
persons," Walizer said in a letter to Eastin. 
</P>
<P>
Eastin has been conducting hearings on the fire to find out why it took the 
state Department of General Services nearly eight months to retrieve some of 
the Lincoln files from the building. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Savona, the department's chief of real estate and design services, on 
Monday blamed the delay on officials' inability to enter the upper floors of 
the building because of a lease dispute with its owner. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Thayer, senior staff counsel for the Savings and Loan Department, said 
the files covered a period in the mid-1980s which is not the central focus of 
the investigation of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning from Eastin, Thayer conceded that officials have no way of 
knowing if any files were destroyed or tampered with in the months after the 
state offices were evacuated.

In its troubled 28-year life, the Venice Pavilion has never had a heyday. 
</P>
<P>
The senior citizens who were supposed to play shuffleboard and boccie ball 
behind its cement walls were frightened away by a nude beach that flourished -- 
albeit briefly -- nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The theater companies that were supposed to fill its 800-seat auditorium found 
that the structure was too cold and cavernous. 
</P>
<P>
The picnickers who were supposed to flock to the dozens of concrete tables and 
barbecue pits outside the building stayed away when the area began to attract 
drug dealers and the destitute. 
</P>
<P>
But now that talk among some city officials has turned to the wrecking ball, a 
group of about two dozen Venice artists and activists has decided that the 
boarded-up community center on the sand just north of Muscle Beach deserves 
another chance. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with about 4,500 signatures from residents and weekend strollers, the 
Coalition to Save Venice Pavilion is asking the city to open the doors that 
neglect forced shut nearly five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
What they envision for the tan-colored building, however, is a future far 
grander than anything in its past. 
</P>
<P>
In the cobwebbed and graffiti-covered auditorium, they imagine film festivals, 
crafts shows, jazz concerts and poetry readings. 
</P>
<P>
On the nearly forgotten boccie courts, they see a rink for the hundreds of 
roller-skaters who zip past the pavilion each day. And past the dank and 
shadowy passageways where few dare to venture, they speak of a seaside cafe 
serving cappuccino. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't think most people even know what's in there," said the group's 
spokesman, Jerry Rubin, a longtime Venice peace activist (who is no relation to 
the 1960s-era radical leader). "If they did, they'd say, 'My gosh. I can't 
believe this has been left unused for so many years.' " 
</P>
<P>
As part of its preservation effort, the coalition on Sunday tried to draw a 
couple hundred people from the crowd at the beach to form a "human circle of 
unity" around the dilapidated building. 
</P>
<P>
But competing with the usual parade of daredevil roller-skaters, break dancers, 
masseuses, Tarot card readers and incense vendors proved more difficult than 
Rubin had expected. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, just 22 people stood for a few minutes, their linked hands barely 
stretching across the building's entrance. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh well," Rubin said. "This is still more people here than there have been in 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, Rubin presses on. 
</P>
<P>
The group this week is seeking city permission to hold a fund-raiser at the 
pavilion in December. 
</P>
<P>
But officials in the city Recreation and Parks Department, which built the 
structure for about $1 million in 1961, are doubtful that life can -- or should 
-- be breathed into the ailing structure. 
</P>
<P>
More than a year ago, the city and the California Coastal Conservancy launched 
a study of the entire Venice waterfront that included several public workshops 
on the fate of the pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Although one more meeting is planned for next month, officials in both agencies 
said it is clear from those who have attended that many consider the structure 
an incongruous eyesore that blocks their ocean view and robs them of their 
beachfront. 
</P>
<P>
City and conservancy officials have stressed that they will respond to the 
wishes of the public in deciding the fate of the building. And if that means 
tearing it down, that is perfectly acceptable to them. 
</P>
<P>
"Inherently, it is an inappropriate land use," said Joel Breitbart, assistant 
general manager for planning and development in the Recreation and Parks 
Department. "I think the vast majority feel the community would be better 
served if it were sandy beach again." 
</P>
<P>
Dell Chumley, a longtime resident and past president of the Venice Town 
Council, also favors razing the facility. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not some sacred burial ground that can't be torn down," said Chumley, 
who is a member of the SeaSkate committee, which wants to build a 
roller-skating platform in the community. "There are some really nice buildings 
in Venice that we should treasure, but the pavilion isn't one of them." 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first effort to revive the facility, which sits behind a grassy 
area where Windward Avenue meets the boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1960s, the Recreation and Parks Department built a roof over the 
original open-air amphitheater after theatergoers complained about the damp 
cold. Thespians, however, complained that the roof destroyed the acoustics. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the city tried to solicit bids from private entrepreneurs to lease or 
buy the pavilion. But, despite offering as much as $1 million in matching city 
funds, there were no takers. 
</P>
<P>
"The building was just an ill-conceived idea that ought to die," said Los 
Angeles Police Sgt. J. P. Williams, who commands the Venice Beach substation in 
the pavilion's basement. "It should just give way to the natural environment." 
</P>
<P>
Rubin, who also is director of the Los Angeles Alliance for Survival, a 
Venice-based peace organization, thinks there is already enough sand on the 
beach. But there is a dearth, he says, of public spaces for artists, actors, 
musicians and poets to share their talents with the community. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a free-speech issue," said Glenn Hopkins, a playwright who 
directed the last theatrical production at the pavilion in 1984 and supports 
the effort to save the structure. "More than 500,000 people pass by here every 
weekend day, and we have no way to draw on that crowd."

POLICE TRY TO TAKE BACK A DRUG-INFESTED AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
From her Harbor City apartment, Alice can see for miles. Her view includes the 
Vincent Thomas Bridge in San Pedro and the twinkling lights of the Unocal 
Refinery in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
Closer to home, the sights are far less appealing. Graffiti on the sidewalk. 
Drug dealers in the street, flagging down cars and passing out crack cocaine 
like candy. Gang shootings. Chlidren, some as young as 8, handcuffed and carted 
off in police cruisers. 
</P>
<P>
But Alice doesn't want to talk about what she sees. Nor does she, like most who 
live near the intersection of 252nd Street and Marigold Avenue in Harbor City, 
want to give her last name. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you," she says. "I live by myself. I have to think of my life." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department's Harbor Division says the corner of 252nd 
and Marigold, and the blocks that surround it, make up the busiest -- and most 
dangerous -- drug-dealing area in the Harbor Division, and one of the busiest 
in the city. Since the beginning of this year, 205 narcotics arrests have been 
made at 252nd and Marigold alone. A recent sting operation in the neighborhood, 
in which police posed as drug dealers and buyers, netted 54 arrests in four 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a cesspool," said Capt. Joseph De Ladurantey, the division's commanding 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
So police are trying to turn the tide. For four nights recently, half a dozen 
officers barricaded a four-block area and stopped every car that went into the 
neighborhood -- not to make arrests, but to give residents like Alice some 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not here to take people to jail," said Don Linfield, the officer in 
charge of the operation. "We're here as a suppression effort. We're just making 
our presence known, to let these people (gangs and drug dealers) know they 
don't own the streets anymore." 
</P>
<P>
The blockade was the first step in what De Ladurantey said will be a 
months-long effort to restore order to the community, "to take back the 
sidewalks and the streets and give them back" to law-abiding residents. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledges that it will not be an easy task. The dealers have a tight hold 
on the Marigold Avenue neighborhood -- so tight, police say, that dealers have 
ordered residents to lock their dogs indoors at night so they can skip through 
the back yards and alleys to avoid getting caught. And the fearful residents 
have complied. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, people come from all over -- as far as the San Fernando 
Valley and sometimes Orange County -- to buy drugs in this neighborhood. 
Perhaps that's because of its accessible location, just off the Harbor Freeway 
near Lomita Boulevard and Normandie Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood blockade was similar to a recent crackdown in the Pico-Union 
area of Los Angeles, although tiny in comparison. In Pico-Union, up to 160 
officers barricaded a square-mile area. They posted 20 sawhorse barriers with 
large signs reading "Narcotics Enforcement Zone, Residents Only" in 
intersections leading into the district. Some neighbors report that drug 
dealing has declined in their area but has picked up in outlying blocks.

Members of an exclusive London gentlemen's club expressed shock and outrage 
after a new rule was introduced allowing the "American custom" of talking at 
breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
Reporting on the end of one of the most cherished traditions of the 
111-year-old Savile Club, the Sunday Telegraph, a pillar of the British 
establishment, said the death knell was sounded in just 13 words. 
</P>
<P>
"The general committee has agreed to a trial period of conversation at 
breakfast," a club announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
Club secretary Peter Aldersly said members had liked to be able to read their 
newspapers in peace, but times have changed. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some members who want business breakfasts. It's an American custom," 
he explained. 
</P>
<P>
But historian Lord Dacre, a member for nearly 50 years, reacted angrily. "Good 
God! I shall resign at once," he said.

CANDIDATE ACCUSED OF FLYING OLD SCHOOL COLORS UNFAIRLY

Some University of Southern California alumni on Monday accused a Newport-Mesa 
Unified School District board candidate of sending a last-minute campaign 
mailer that misrepresents their alma mater and wrongly implies that USC 
endorses her candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
But candidate Jo Ellen Allen of Corona del Mar defended the mailer, which was 
done in the school colors of cardinal red and gold and went to hundreds of USC 
alumni living in the Newport-Mesa enrollment area of Newport Beach and Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The letters from Allen's campaign committee started arriving over the weekend. 
The letter and the envelope each bear USC's mascot Tommy Trojan and the 
notation, "Attention: USC Alumni." 
</P>
<P>
"I got it in the mail on Saturday and flipped. I was furious," said Patricia 
Hitt, a USC alumna and former assistant cabinet secretary during the Nixon 
administration. "I think it is a deliberately deceptive mailer, and this is 
what turns people off to politics." 
</P>
<P>
The correspondence tells the reader that "a good friend of ours and a fellow 
Trojan" is running for the Newport-Mesa school board. Allen, a lecturer at USC, 
is running against incumbent Sherry Loofbourrow of Corona del Mar. The letter 
describes Allen's qualifications for school board, notes that her husband 
graduated from USC and urges alumni to get behind her candidacy to ensure a 
"resounding victory this Nov. 7." 
</P>
<P>
The mailer closes with the cheer "Fight on," and is signed by builder William 
Lusk and Anita Ferguson, Allen's campaign manager and wife of state Assemblyman 
Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach). At the bottom of the letter in small print, it 
states the mailer is being paid for by the Committee to Elect Jo Ellen Allen. 
</P>
<P>
Allen denied any impropriety Monday and blamed complaints on a "lunatic fringe" 
that wants to undermine her candidacy. She pointed out that the letter contains 
a disclaimer and that there is no USC endorsement of her candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever these people are, are the same people who threatened Mrs. (Anita) 
Ferguson today (Monday)," Allen said. "It is so ridiculous. People can use any 
colors they want to." 
</P>
<P>
Allen said she did not use any USC alumni lists for the mailer and declined to 
name the people who purportedly threatened her campaign manager. Ferguson could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Hitt and USC alumna Mary Lou Gray said they will complain to USC's 
administration about the Allen mailings. Gray said that she talked with USC 
authorities Monday and that they requested copies of the letter to see if there 
was anything improper. 
</P>
<P>
"I was upset because the letter gives the impression that it's a university 
mailing," said Gray, who is backing Loofbourrow. "It doesn't matter what 
candidate I'm backing. A lot of fellow Trojan alumni are outraged that Allen's 
campaign would attempt to trade on the university's name."

ELEMENTS OF EDUCATIONAL 'CHOICE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The idea that parents and teachers should be directly and actively involved in 
children's education is a solid, old-fashioned notion that has been revived 
this year as one of the hot topics of national discussion. Educational 
"choice," giving parents the option of choosing which public schools their 
children will attend, is said to be the reason for leaps in reading scores and 
increased parent and teacher involvement in the once-languishing East Harlem 
school district. That district is regularly cited by the Bush Administration as 
the premier example of choice. But a close look at the East Harlem system, the 
only long-standing national example of choice, points out why it should not 
become the catch-all term to avoid the tough education-funding decisions that 
lawmakers and taxpayers must make. 
</P>
<P>
The idea behind choice is that a free market system can work as well for 
schools as it does for private businesses; the good schools will attract more 
students and the ones that fall short will have to improve or perish. While the 
East Harlem students, teachers and parents do exude an infectious enthusiasm 
and pride in their now famous schools, Times writer Stanley Meisler found that 
it is not at all clear that instituting choice was the key factor in the 
improved test scores. Other factors, including the use of a different 
standardized test and an overall jump in scores throughout New York city, 
apparently played important roles. 
</P>
<P>
The parents of East Harlem know themselves that good will and parental 
involvement in a school are not enough: They assailed Secretary of Education 
Lauro F. Cavazos during a recent visit there because the federal government 
rejected the district's application for a $1.4-million magnet- school grant, 
leaving the local board to struggle to save 30 teaching and staff positions. 
</P>
<P>
School-choice programs are being explored by some 20 states. Already in 
Richmond, Calif., Montclair, N.J., and the state of Minnesota, parents can 
choose another public school if they do not want their children to attend the 
neighborhood school. In Los Angeles, the magnet schools that focus on areas of 
interest and are designed to attract different ethnic groups citywide are a 
successful but limited example of choice. 
</P>
<P>
The full-scale Minnesota program is being monitored to see how well the system 
works; there, as in an "open enrollment" program in Irvine, most parents so far 
have opted to keep their children in schools close to home. In East Harlem, 
even supporters of choice have been careful to point out its limitations. One 
of the early architects of the East Harlem system said that it worked there 
because it came gradually, one school at a time, and successful programs were 
kept small. That observation is a reminder that ideally a parent wants many 
excellent schools to chose from; but absent the ideal, it's far better for a 
school district to offer a few excellent programs than lots of slapdash poor 
choices.

FAMILY PLANNING CLINICS CLOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With cruel, deft strokes Gov. George Deukmejian has signed off on a policy of 
punishing poor women that exemplifies his lack of compassion, sensitivity to 
human rights, common sense and logic (Part A, Oct. 31). 
</P>
<P>
As the family planning clinics targeted for closure begin diverting patients to 
alternate facilities that are even more crowded and less accessible, the 
quality of fundamental health-care services provided to needy women will 
decline dramatically, resulting particularly in increased numbers of unwanted 
pregnancies, incidences of sexually transmitted diseases and cancer. The 
health-care professionals have provided the numbers; the reality of the 
closures is about to be felt throughout Los Angeles County, yet Deukmejian 
insists on ignoring the facts and supporting his "only slightly" misguided 
notion that should a program not report a 100% effective rate for one aspect of 
its function, it therefore does not merit continued funding. To extrapolate his 
theory, why should we bother with public health care at all; people still get 
sick. 
</P>
<P>
The final analysis goes like this: Deukmejian, a staunch anti-choice advocate, 
equates women's general health services with "the taking of human life." 
</P>
<P>
It has been noted by several prominent social theorists that increased abuse of 
women and the status of women, be it rape, battery, denial of equal rights, 
denigration by the media, and so on, signifies an imminent, large-scale 
breakdown in the integrity and stability of the social organization within 
which such abuse occurs. 
</P>
<P>
We may thank George Bush, and, more locally, George Deukmejian, for their 
extensive contributions to the abuse of women.

BUYING TIME IN EAST GERMANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few months ago East Germans paraded in the thousands, petitioning their 
government to adopt a less intrusive, less oppressive role in their lives. Now 
they are demonstrating in the hundreds of thousands, demanding a free press, 
free elections, an end to the "leading" -- i.e., near-exclusive -- role of the 
Communist Party in the political and social life of the country. It is worth 
remembering that for the last two generations the part of divided Germany now 
clamoring for sweeping reform has known only totalitarian rule and 
indoctrination, first under the Nazis, then the Communists. What those who have 
taken to the streets in ever greater numbers are saying is that even after 56 
years of oppression, they remember the language of freedom and what it means. 
</P>
<P>
Until a few months ago, the East German regime felt confident that it could 
resist the wave of change rolling over other Soviet bloc countries. The 
political embarrassment produced by the highly visible flight of tens of 
thousands of East Germans through Hungary and Czechoslovakia -- with the 
cooperation of the Communist governments of those countries -- clearly shook 
that confidence. Some presumed words of warning from Soviet leader Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev no doubt shook it even more. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the regime tried reform at the most primitive level. The Stalinst 
die-hard Erich Honecker was dumped, replaced by Egon Krenz, his protege but 
also someone who at least was prepared to murmur, however vaguely, about the 
need for change. The new tone, however, has done nothing to calm the agitation. 
</P>
<P>
If Krenz has anything more specific in mind than buying time, he has yet to 
reveal it. He has shoved other septuagenarian members of the Politburo 
overboard, and allowed subordinates to talk about the desirability of revamping 
the entire government. As an earnest of his intention to permit freer foreign 
travel, he has reopened the border with Czechoslovakia, but rather than 
reassuring restive East Germans, that gesture has only prompted tens of 
thousands more to decamp to the West. Krenz is now reduced to pleading with 
East Germans not to run away. Suddenly some officials in West Germany, made 
nervous at the prospect of absorbing perhaps hundreds of thousands of 
additional refugees, are starting to echo that plea. 
</P>
<P>
Will people listen? Perhaps, if evidence of genuine change were quickly to 
appear. But the kind of fundamental changes now being demanded -- political 
pluralism, human rights, an end to the Communist Party's exclusive hold on 
power -- is change that by its very nature, as events in Poland and Hungary 
have shown, would spell the beginning of the end for the regime. So far, no one 
in power has suggested that this would be an acceptable course. In the end 
there may be no choice.

EXPANDING COUNTY BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am surprised to see Bill Boyarsky ("Simple Tools in a Complex Era," Oct. 20) 
so easily fall into the "bigger is better" syndrome. Yet there it was at the 
end of his column, a call to expand the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors, elect a county executive and opt for regional government. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing missing from his description of the county today was lace 
doilies. 
</P>
<P>
Voters have already rejected board expansion and an elected executive, and the 
Southern California Assn. of Governments has proven itself a papier-mache 
monument to regional government; paper because reams of reports are about all 
it has accomplished, that and spending lavish amounts of money. In a very real 
sense, "regional government" already exists in the close working relationship 
the county has with the 86 cities in Los Angeles County. Community needs are 
met through the cooperative efforts of local city councils and the county, 
which is responsible in such areas as health, mental health and courts. 
</P>
<P>
Boyarsky is quite correct on one point: Volunteers can't pay for a new jail 
today. Soaring crime rates and construction costs changed that. Still, the 
existing, five-member Board of Supervisors has been modern enough, again with 
the voters' help, to respond to severe jail overcrowding with action to add 
more than 7,000 new jail beds. 
</P>
<P>
It's the same board, responding to the public's demand, that streamlined county 
government and increased efficiency by consolidating an unwieldy 58 county 
departments into a functional 38 and, implemented privatization, hardly acts of 
intellectual and political gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
The commission system is a proven and successful tool. It was the Institutional 
Inspections Commission, for example, whose members brought forward the need for 
the new Catalina Sheriff's Station and jail now in operation. 
</P>
<P>
No, bigger isn't better, an elected executive isn't going to improve county 
government, only divide it, and a larger Board of Supervisors isn't a panacea; 
rather, it's an invitation to the kind of inaction and blame-shifting that 
allows infrastructures to crumble -- at the expense of the taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
There are no doilies in county government, just dedicated staffs working very 
hard to meet the people's needs.

AFTER 50 YEARS, THE 'OUTS' HAVE AN 'IN' IN MEXICO; 
</P>
<P>
SALINAS: THE PRESIDENT'S PLEDGE OF A POLITICAL OPENING HAS A HAPPY DEBUT IN 
BAJA CALIFORNIA. THE TRICK IS HOW MUCH TO ALLOW ELSEWHERE.

<P>
Nearly lost amid the jeers and raised fists of the leftist opposition that 
interrupted President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's first state-of-the-nation 
address last week was one of the most striking and significant political 
developments in recent Mexican history: the emergence of a tacit strategic 
alliance between the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and its principal 
antagonist for half a century, the conservative National Action Party (PAN). 
Nothing symbolized the changed political face of Mexico more dramatically than 
Salinas' bringing the newly elected PAN governor of Baja California Norte, 
Ernesto Ruffo Appel, from Mexico City to his inauguration in Mexicali on the 
presidential plane. No less revealing was the sight of the PRI-affiliated 
president being welcomed as a hero by thousands of ardent PAN supporters, whose 
gratitude to him for recognizing Ruffo's electoral victory could hardly be 
contained. 
</P>
<P>
The PAN's new willingness to collaborate openly with the PRI was signalled two 
weeks ago when the PRI-sponsored version of electoral reform passed in 
Congress. The constitutional amendments will have the effect of guaranteeing 
the PRI's continued control of the Congress beyond 1991, when the next 
congressional elections will be held, and restoring to Salinas the ability to 
amend the constitution without having to depend on opposition-party support. 
The dominant faction in the PAN apparently acceded to this formula in exchange 
for promises of other changes (such as a new system of voter registration, to 
reduce padding by "phantom" voters who invariably support the PRI). 
</P>
<P>
On the left, partisans of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas' had demanded a far more 
fundamental change -- elimination of government control over the federal and 
state entities that run elections and certify the results -- and showed no 
willingness to negotiate with Salinas on alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
With their hard-line position of "all or nothing," as Salinas characterized it 
in his state-of-the-nation address, the Cardenistas continue to lose ground 
both to the government and to the PAN. Widening internal divisions threaten the 
Cardenistas' capacity to mount effective challenges to the PRI in state and 
local elections, while the government promotes further fractionalization of the 
left by bolstering small leftist splinter parties and encouraging the formation 
of additional ones. 
</P>
<P>
After 11 months of Salinismo, it is becoming clear that political reform under 
this government will be neither as rapid nor as across-the-board as the 
opposition hoped and the PRI Old Guard feared. Salinas is still seeking broader 
support, both within his own party and among the opposition parties, for more 
sweeping changes in the political system. He has proven to be a bold 
risk-taker, but he is unlikely to proceed much further with electoral reform 
until he gets that broader consensus. He will not try to manufacture one by 
imposing a radical, Gorbachev-style political reform project of his own. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as he reminded Congress last week, "We have set our course and are 
in command." Salinas' actions since entering office have greatly strengthened 
his presidency, and he is in no mood to make concessions to an opposition group 
that continues to question his legitimacy. He has opted for an incrementalist 
approach to political reform, to ensure a minimum level of cohesion within the 
PRI-government apparatus while still responding credibly to the clamor for 
political change emanating from the public and the opposition and from the 
reform wing of the PRI itself. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas will attempt to steal the Cardenistas' economic banner by keeping 
inflation low, restoring moderate growth and especially by demonstrating that 
his policy of privatizing most state-owned enterprises has a direct social 
payoff. In the remainder of his term, the sale of enterprises like Telefonos de 
Mexico will give the government a huge infusion of capital while freeing up 
additional billions that would have been used to subsidize state companies -- 
funds that Salinas intends to invest in basic human services. 
</P>
<P>
The danger is that as criticism of his government's economic strategy fades and 
as pressure on the PRI to reform itself diminishes, overall political reform 
will begin to lag too far behind the pace of economic change. The already 
fierce resistance to anything that threatens powerful vested interests within 
the PRI apparatus will stiffen. In this scenario, the left and its causes will 
be the big losers, since the political opening -- such as it is -- will remain 
skewed toward the PAN, whose victories in state, local and congressional races 
are more likely to be recognized. The conservative tug on the government's 
economic policies will have no effective counterpoise. 
</P>
<P>
The PRI will suffer, too, since an unreformed party will be ill-prepared to 
compete in the 1994 presidential election without large-scale, highly 
disruptive irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
The shock of the PRI's reverses in the 1988 national elections and the loss of 
a state governorship to the PAN in 1989 opened a historic opportunity to create 
a much more competitive political system. A broader coalition for change must 
be forged in the next five years, however, if that possibility is to be 
realized.

PHILIPPINES: DESPITE PRESIDENT AQUINO'S GOOD INTENTIONS, SO-CALLED DEVELOPMENT 
PROGRAMS ARE VICTIMIZED BY OLD PATTERNS OF CORRUPTION, NEGLECT AND BUREAUCRACY.

<P>
With pin-striped economic advisers in tow, Philippine President Corazon Aquino 
descends on the United States this week to drum up more investment and aid for 
her debt-ridden economy. So frequent have been such borrowing trips that 
cartoonists at Manila's dailies have had a field day lampooning Cory carrying a 
begging bowl from one world capital to another. 
</P>
<P>
Would-be investors, members of Congress and the American public would do well 
to fight the inclination to fill the bowl further as the way to improve the 
lives of the majority of Filipinos. 
</P>
<P>
A year of research across the Philippine archipelago convinced us that Aquino's 
"people's power" agenda is hopelessly stalled as far as the government is 
concerned. And enhanced financial flows from the United States through what was 
originally called a mini-Marshall Plan (and is now known as the Multilateral 
Assistance Initiative) cannot overcome this basic obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino's promise of land to the tiller has degenerated into a program of almost 
comical scandals in which wealthy landlords sell their worst parcels of land to 
the government at ridiculously inflated prices, which 
peasants-turned-landowners must repay in full. This may be the first land 
reform in history in which the rich are getting richer and the poor poorer. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, loggers are tearing down Philippine forests at a rate that is among 
the fastest in the world. The core of the problem is a timber-licensing system 
in which about 90 wealthy individuals have been granted control over most of 
the forests. Time and again they avoid replanting new trees by using part of 
their ample profits to buy off government and military officials. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino did not help the situation earlier this year by appointing a wealthy 
businessman, Roberto Villanueva, to head up an agency created to oversee the 
new aid. Villanueva put together an uninspired policy framework that would 
channel the mini-Marshall Plan to an almost endless list of large projects that 
fail to address poverty and environmental destruction. As Yale economist Gustav 
Ranis recently warned in a critical assessment of the aid plan, giving lots of 
money to Aquino's "return to the same old discredited narrow growth path" could 
"do more harm than good." 
</P>
<P>
News of Aquino's failures is undoubtedly jarring to Americans who invested so 
much hope in the exuberant symbolism of her victory over the Marcos 
dictatorship. Yet we should have realized that improving the prospects of the 
two-thirds of Filipinos who live and die below the poverty line would require 
substantial redistribution away from the small elite who have long controlled 
the Philippines' economy and natural resources. With her family owning one of 
the country's largest sugar plantations (where we observed race horses living 
better than migrant workers), Aquino was ill-positioned to initiate the 
necessary land and other reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, a far more fruitful and inexpensive alternative for U.S. 
assistance was clearly visible as we traveled the Philippine countryside. While 
stalled at the government level, the people's power agenda of social reform 
continues to percolate in pockets of action around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers on the southern island of Mindanao -- men and women, young and old -- 
described to us their fears as they sat down for 11 days and nights to blockade 
logging trucks passing through their town. Mudslides from denuded mountains 
were destroying their fields, and help was not forthcoming from the government 
far away in Manila. The peasants felt that they had no alternative but to act. 
Despite brutal harassment by the military, they eventually forced the 
government to cancel the loggers' licenses. Now the farmers want assistance to 
replant the trees and to halt the logging that continues illegally. 
</P>
<P>
Fisherfolk in the central Philippines are fighting the depletion of fishing 
banks by Japanese trawlers and the destruction of nearby coral reefs in which 
fish live and multiply. They seek assistance to create sustainably managed 
marine reserves and to build artificial reefs from old tires or concrete. 
</P>
<P>
Tribal Filipinos on the northern island of Luzon are fighting loggers and 
mining companies that have encroached on their ancestral lands. They simply 
want recognition of their land rights so that they may continue their 
traditional, sustainable forms of agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
It is these people's power initiatives of the poorer majority in the 
Philippines that should electrify the world. They would benefit from modest 
amounts of outside aid. In this case, more is not better. Indeed, the billions 
of dollars that currently flow through the World Bank and government aid 
agencies toward large projects simply line the pockets of government officials 
and private contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, the United States could cut substantially the half-billion dollars in 
aid it has earmarked for the Philippines next year and use the remainder to 
endow a new foundation in Manila. Administered by experts from non-governmental 
Philippine and U.S. development organizations, the foundation could direct 
assistance toward promising small-scale initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
To Cory Aquino and her well-dressed entourage, the message should be firm: The 
United States wishes to channel its limited aid resources toward people-powered 
programs -- programs that enhance equity, participation and ecological 
sustainability. Until the Philippine government proves by its actions that it 
is unequivocally behind such an agenda, U.S. aid should go directly to those 
who are putting their lives on the line to advance that dream.

MUST WE RUSH THE EXECUTIONER?; 
</P>
<P>
DEATH PENALTY: COURTS MAKE MISTAKES MORE FREQUENTLY THAN WE LIKE TO ADMIT. WE 
MUST BE SURE BEFORE WE DROP THE PELLET.

<P>
By STEPHEN REINHARDT, Judge Stephen Reinhardt sits on the U.S. 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A committee headed by former Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. and 
composed exclusively of federal judges from the South has recommended drastic 
limitations on the rights of condemned people awaiting execution. In California 
alone, there are more than 200 who may be affected by these changes in our 
fundamental procedures. 
</P>
<P>
The Powell committee report, which Chief Justice William Rehnquist submitted 
directly to Congress in a manner that drew unprecedented criticism from most of 
the chief judges of the U.S. Courts of Appeal, would severely restrict the use 
of the writ of habeas corpus in capital cases. Speedy executions, rather than 
fairness and due process, would be the order of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Are we really so desperate to execute people that we can no longer afford them 
the full rights of review that condemned people have always had? Are we really 
willing to sacrifice certainty for speed where life is at stake? Are we really 
prepared to execute people who have been convicted or sentenced in violation of 
the provisions of the Constitution? 
</P>
<P>
If not, someone had better tell the Congress before it enacts the Powell 
committee recommendations. Legislation that would accomplish just that is now 
on a special fast track, which would permit Congress to act before the lessons 
of common sense and history can make their weight felt. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is not, as some seem to believe, whether we should turn criminals 
loose simply because courts make technical errors or admit improper evidence. 
It is whether in capital cases we can afford to ignore fundamental 
constitutional violations that may affect the jury's decision to find the 
defendant guilty or to impose a death sentence instead of life imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
If the error is not of constitutional magnitude or if it does not affect the 
verdict, the federal courts will not intervene. 
</P>
<P>
The writ of habeas corpus, no less, is under attack by the chief justice and 
the committee he appointed. One might expect to hear the alarm bells ringing 
throughout the land. Yet only the American Bar Assn. has thus far shown any 
signs of springing into action. Its litigation section has issued a report 
calling for greater, rather than lesser, protections for the rights of those 
facing death at the hands of the state. The Bar Association itself is scheduled 
to consider the matter early next year, shortly before Congress is expected to 
act. 
</P>
<P>
To understand the significance of these attempts to limit federal-court review 
of state-imposed death sentences, one need only look back over a recent 
seven-year period. During that time, almost 75% of the orders of execution 
issued by state courts were found to be in violation of the Constitution. But 
for federal review and the writ of habeas corpus, a substantial number of 
people would have been executed in contravention of the fundamental principles 
set forth in our Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, the defendant may have been innocent; in others, only the 
fairness of the sentence may have been at issue. Either way, the lesson is 
simple: Courts make mistakes -- even in capital cases. And they make them more 
frequently than we like to admit. This elementary fact should lead us all, 
supporters and opponents of the death penalty alike, to one uncontroversial 
conclusion: We must be absolutely sure that we are right before we drop the 
pellet or pull the switch. We must not deprive any human being of a fair chance 
for judicial review if a reasonable argument exists that reversal of his or her 
death penalty is required by our laws. 
</P>
<P>
This is the very principle that the Powell committee squarely and explicitly 
rejects. The committee's recommendations reflect an understandable public 
frustration over increasing crime, the narcotics threat, the slowness of the 
judicial process and our general inability to control our national and 
individual destinies. We want to strike out -- to act -- to see tangible 
results, at last. 
</P>
<P>
What is more tangible and final than an execution? And what is more difficult 
to understand than why it takes the courts so long to decide that a mass 
murderer should be executed? So, the Powell committee looked for ways to speed 
up the death-penalty process. And it found a simplistic solution. Limit the use 
of the historic writ of habeas corpus in capital cases. Afford condemned 
prisoners fewer rights than persons convicted of lesser offenses. Prohibit 
successive habeas petitions in capital cases, unlike in all other felonies. 
Adopt a rule that if a capital prisoner's lawyer fails to raise an issue in the 
state proceedings, the prisoner is barred from ever raising it in federal 
court. Adopt another rule that any issue not raised the first time the case is 
presented to a federal judge is, except in rare instances, forever waived. 
</P>
<P>
These rules might be helpful and reasonable if all lawyers were perfect. But 
lawyers, like judges, are not. Lawyers make mistakes, too. And the Powell 
committee's view is that it is the condemned man (or woman) who should pay for 
those mistakes -- with their lives. 
</P>
<P>
The Powell committee's report is not entirely without redeeming social value. 
For example, it encourages states to adopt procedures for the appointment of 
counsel for indigents who want to file habeas petitions in capital cases. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it reaffirms the rule that prohibits condemned prisoners 
from asserting constitutional rights that the Supreme Court had not 
acknowledged as of the time the crime was committed. How much fairer and more 
sensible the view of the bar association committee: "We believe it is 
unacceptable to sanction executions under procedures that have been declared 
unconstitutional." 
</P>
<P>
The Powell committee met only six times. It was composed exclusively of judges 
from places in which executions are common. It heard from no witnesses, 
accepting only written comments. Yet it felt sufficiently confident of its 
views to recommend the most radical curtailment of the writ of habeas corpus in 
our history. 
</P>
<P>
It may take years before all the consequences surrounding adoption of the 
Powell committee recommendations become evident. Meanwhile, executions will 
certainly increase -- but at what cost to our Constitution?

GOVERNOR'S RACE TIGHTENS IN LATEST CALIFORNIA POLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH LOVE, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If a new statewide survey is on the mark, it clearly pays to be active in the 
early stages of a governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, in a dramatic turnaround, is now 
essentially even with Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson in a theoretical matchup 
by the independent California Poll. 
</P>
<P>
According to political professionals who have seen the numbers, Van de Kamp has 
44% to Wilson's 43%. The poll of 807 people, including Republicans and 
Democrats, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
Just three months ago Wilson was leading Van de Kamp by 8 points in the 
California Poll, which is conducted by Mervin D. Field of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"What explains this change is that you've had one very active candidate for 
governor since the summer and that candidate is John Van de Kamp," said 
Democratic media consultant Kam Kuwata. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Los Angeles Times Poll also found Van de Kamp and Wilson dead even. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the worst news in the new California Poll was for former San Francisco 
Mayor Dianne Feinstein, who is challenging Van de Kamp for the Democratic 
gubernatorial nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein led Van de Kamp by 27% to 22% in Field's February survey, an 
admittedly early poll that few paid attention to. In the new survey, those 
familiar with the numbers said Monday, Feinstein is now trailing Van de Kamp by 
53% to 35%. 
</P>
<P>
For that matchup, political sources said, 387 Democrats were polled and the 
survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 5.2 points. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in late July, Van de Kamp has generated a lot of headlines, charging 
that a ballot initiative sponsored by Wilson could endanger a woman's right to 
abortion and introducing his own initiatives on the environment, crime and 
political ethics. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein has been quietly trying to raise money and build political alliances, 
neither of which automatically makes news. She also has been without a 
full-time campaign consultant since Clint Reilly of San Francisco quit in a 
huff in August. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Wilson has received some attention by taking on the plight of 
drug-addicted babies and by being very active after the Bay Area earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
But as the senator conceded in an interview last month, his attention to his 
duties in Washington has put him at a disadvantage so far in the governor's 
race. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, being in the state all the time, has been better able to seize the 
initiative at this stage. 
</P>
<P>
"People are responding to our positive discussion of change, to new ideas," Van 
de Kamp said Monday after hearing of the turnaround in the California Poll. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the Wilson camp had its own interpretation of the latest poll 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been anticipating all along that this race was tight," said Wilson 
campaign manager George Gorton. "It is a result of Pete Wilson doing a good job 
as U.S. senator, which is reflected in this same poll, and in John Van de Kamp 
consolidating his left, which will come back to haunt him next year." 
</P>
<P>
The California Poll found that 48% of Californians believe Wilson is doing an 
"excellent or good job" as a U.S. senator, up from 38% who thought that in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
"Our turn will come next year when Pete is out here and people begin to focus 
on the governor's race," said Gorton.

<TEXT>
<P>
In the lore and romance of American football, only a few names of famous 
coaches stand out. Amos Alonzo Stagg, certainly. Tad Jones, maybe. Howard 
Jones, if you're from the West. 
</P>
<P>
Hurry Up Yost was the first of the storied mentors. Knute Rockne was the most 
colorful. They knew something about winning football games no one else stumbled 
onto. Pop Warner was a great innovator. Bear Bryant knew how to play the part 
better than anyone else who tried it. 
</P>
<P>
They were self-perpetuating. Their genius lay in the fact that the best players 
wanted to play for them. The pipeline was always full. 
</P>
<P>
The pros were another matter. George Halas was a great organizer. He built the 
game, not just the Chicago Bears. Halas put in the players. He got someone else 
-- Paddy Driscoll or Clark Shaughnessy -- to put in the plays. 
</P>
<P>
The pros never really had a Rockne till Vince Lombardi came along. Lombardi was 
not an innovator, he was a motivator. Like Napoleon, he considered it the best 
strategy to mass his strongest forces at the opponent's weakness and break 
through. He called it "running to daylight." 
</P>
<P>
It was about as nifty as a cannonball, but it was executed flawlessly, 
meticulously. Lombardi's Green Bay Packer teams ran through the league like a 
hot knife through butter. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Brown's Cleveland Brown teams were, like the coach, impersonal, 
unemotional but efficient. 
</P>
<P>
With the great coaches, the reputation outlasted the man. Rockne perished in a 
flaming plane crash. He was barely 43 years old. Lombardi was struck down by 
cancer in his prime. 
</P>
<P>
This left Tom Landry, the precise, poker-faced master of the finesse game. 
Where Lombardi charged, Landry out-flanked. 
</P>
<P>
When Landry left the Dallas Cowboys unceremoniously this year -- followed 
shortly by Bill Walsh from the San Francisco 49ers, it left Miami's Don Shula 
and Pittsburgh's Chuck Noll as the keepers of the flame. The last of the 
multiple Super Bowl coaches, the last of the super coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Shula was generally conceded to be the successor to the masters. A man of 
uncommon probity who went to Mass every morning of his life, he was so highly 
thought of that, when the Miami Dolphins' owner spirited him away from the 
Baltimore Colts, the Baltimore owner wanted South Florida in compensation. He 
all but wrecked the league in his pique. He knew he had lost the equivalent of 
10 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Shula, with his deep-set eyes and jaw that looked like something cut off a 
granite mountain, took a 3-10-1 team and immediately made it a 10-4 team. 
Within two years he was in a Super Bowl. In three, he was going undefeated -- 
17-0 -- and winning a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
You always had Shula to beat. 
</P>
<P>
But the National Football League is a malevolent overseer. It mandates parity 
in its ranks. It punishes excellence, rewards mediocrity. 
</P>
<P>
Little by little, it dismantles dynasties. You win, you pay. In this game, you 
lose, you go to the windows. Champions get to pick last. Goof-ups get the cream 
of the crop. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, the genius is the coach with the best quarterback. John Unitas, Sammy 
Baugh and Otto Graham made geniuses of a lot of coaches. 
</P>
<P>
But Shula got to a Super bowl with David Woodley. In fact, he made it with five 
different quarterbacks -- Unitas, Earl Morrall, Bob Griese, Woodley, and Dan 
Marino). 
</P>
<P>
Should you quit when you're ahead? Would Rockne and Lombardi have ever seen 
"Goodby Vince" signs, or heard the boos if their careers had gone on? 
</P>
<P>
When Don Shula's team dropped to 6-10 last year, the natives in South Florida 
were not only restless, they were positively mutinous. The gripes grew. Shula 
had lost the touch. He had forgotten the formula. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't the game that had passed him by, it was the draft. Miami had 
become like a fighter with a devastating right hand and not much else. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Dan Marino filled the air with footballs -- 60 in one game, more 
than 50 in three others -- and the team needed 500-yard days from him just to 
stay even. The running game was non-existent to catastrophic. It was like a guy 
who can't putt trying to win an Open. 
</P>
<P>
Finishing 6-10 disturbs the couch potatoes, but it has its privileges. You 
draft from the top of the barrel. 
</P>
<P>
When Shula and the Dolphins picked an injury-plagued running back named Sammie 
Smith as their No. 1 pick, even the league purists were outraged. Miami needed 
cornerbacks, offensive linemen, defensive linemen, free safeties, they felt. 
</P>
<P>
Shula wanted someone to keep the defenses honest. His one-dimensional attack 
was as easy to beat as a low straight in a seven-card game. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, in Joe Robbie Stadium down here, Shula finally had a pass rush and a 
line charge. But most of all, he had a runner who could keep the linebackers 
from pouring in like cops raiding a crap game. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Marino only had to put the ball in the air 26 times. Usually, that's just a 
good half for Marino, never mind a full four quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Sammie Smith carried the ball 25 times for 123 yards. That may not be Bo 
Jackson stuff but that's more yards than the whole team had in all but two of 
the 16 games last year. The team had game totals of 45 yards, 98, 71, 78, 91, 
46, 77, 87, 58, 93 and 82. That's sandlot stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Shula is not claiming to be on the verge of a record sixth Super Bowl. But he 
is setting out to prove that coaching, like playing the piano or riding a 
bicycle, never leaves you, that the joker in the deck is league policy, not 
coaching failure. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way to stay at the top of the hill when you go 15-2 or 14-2," he 
said Sunday after winning a game he had to win, 19-13, over Indianapolis. "You 
have to build things back up through the system. 
</P>
<P>
"But it is not that I have gotten bored or take the game as less important or 
look at less film or live and die less with what we do. If I were to reach that 
stage, I would know it first." 
</P>
<P>
It appears that Shula has the infantry to go with his bomber wing. That's bad 
news for the NFL. It appears as though the road to the Super Bowl may lie 
through Miami again. Don Shula will be drafting last again in no time at all.

FILM SAVES RECORD THAT GOT AWAY; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: A STATISTICIAN'S ERROR GIVES CAL STATE FULLERTON'S MIKE 
PRINGLE SHARE OF NCAA RUSHING RECORD THAT HE THOUGHT HE HAD LOST WHEN COACH 
GENE MURPHY SIDELINED HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Coach Gene Murphy of Cal State Fullerton says now that he made a mistake 
Saturday by not giving Mike Pringle a chance to break the national single-game 
rushing record. 
</P>
<P>
But Fullerton officials found another mistake Monday -- a five-yard 
statistician's error that, when corrected, gave Pringle a share of the record 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy kept Pringle on the sidelines in the final minute of Fullerton's 45-10 
victory over New Mexico State Saturday, choosing to give reserves the playing 
time he had promised them, rather than give Pringle a chance to get the six 
yards he needed to break the record of 357 yards set by Washington State's 
Rueben Mayes against Oregon in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
But in a routine review of game statistics Sunday night, Mel Franks, 
Fullerton's sports information director, noticed a five-yard discrepancy 
between the play-by-play and the tabulation kept by official statistician Dean 
Lohuis. Fullerton reviewed game films Monday and found a five-yard error. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an embarrassing situation," Franks said. "But we'd rather be embarrassed 
than Mike Pringle not have his yards." 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA has been informed of the revision, and will list Pringle as co-holder 
of the record, said Jim Wright, NCAA assistant director of communications. 
</P>
<P>
The error occurred on a third-down play at the end of the third quarter. The 
play began at the Fullerton 41-yard line, and after Pringle's carry, the film 
shows the ball at the 43. But Lohuis' records indicate he mistook the 43 for 
the 38, shorting Pringle five yards. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle, who had borrowed the game films himself Sunday night to watch them but 
did not catch the error, learned Monday afternoon that he had tied the record 
after all. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good about it," said Pringle, who leads the nation in all-purpose 
running and is second in rushing to Florida's Emmitt Smith with 148.9 yards a 
game. "It's not the same high I would have felt on the field, not the same 
excitement. I'm pleased. Now I know my name will be in the record book." 
</P>
<P>
With the correction giving Pringle a share of the record, some people are 
asking why Fullerton can't find another yard to give him the record outright. 
</P>
<P>
But Franks said Fullerton was only correcting a mathematical error, and would 
not question any issues of judgment. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to mess around and look for a yard," Franks said. 
</P>
<P>
Lohuis, an accountant and high school football official, said he was glad the 
error had been discovered. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't bother me," he said. "You want things right. Everybody does make 
mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy spent part of Monday conducting more interviews on his decision, one 
that drew television news crews to the offices of a football program that 
struggles for recognition and drew only 3,000 fans to its game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had known it would cause such upheaval and furor, I'd have let him get 
the six yards," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy had kept Pringle in a runaway game well into the fourth quarter, trying 
to let him get the school record of 301 yards and all the while promising the 
backups they would play as soon as Pringle got the record. 
</P>
<P>
But when Pringle finally broke the record, he did it on a 67-yard run, 
shattering Obie Graves' school record and ending up an apparent five yards shy 
of tying the NCAA record when he was pulled down five yards short of the goal 
line. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy took him out, and never sent him back in. 
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, at the time, I was personally caught up in the emotion of 
wanting to make the substitutions," Murphy said. "Unless you've been in 
coaching, you never know what it is like to watch those kids practice and never 
get to play. . . . I should have let Mike Pringle get the six yards. I 
apologize. I'm sorry." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy regretted his decision Sunday and made apologetic phone calls, first to 
Pringle's mother, Annie Pringle, and then to Mike, who had grown more unhappy 
with the decision the more he considered it. 
</P>
<P>
"I said after the game it would probably hit me later, and it did," Pringle 
said. "It did. . . . I was kind of bitter late Saturday, and all day Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
As the knowledge that he shared a national record set in Monday, Pringle 
thought back to Saturday's game, when he stood on the sidelines waiting to go 
back in. He had stood there, planning to get the record, and planning to hang 
on tight to the game ball. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been nice to be able to run off the field carrying the ball," 
Pringle said Monday. "Now it's, 'Where's the ball?' "

FATAL SHOOTING IS TRAGIC ENDING FOR BOXER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the spring and early summer of 1984, I watched two teen-agers in the 
selection process for the U.S. Olympic boxing team who looked to me like future 
superstars. As it turned out, neither made the Olympic team that year -- 1984 
was too soon for them. 
</P>
<P>
But both left the impression that they were champions in early development. 
</P>
<P>
One was Mike Tyson, a 17-year-old pounder from Upstate New York who was still 
learning to box. An unpolished diamond. 
</P>
<P>
The other was Todd Hickman, 17, a bantamweight from Akron, Ohio. A polished 
diamond. 
</P>
<P>
Both, I was sure, would one day be world champions as pros. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson had immense strength and was surprisingly skilled, but in a crude sort of 
way. Hickman was artistry. He had that rare blend of natural boxing skill and 
knockout power in both hands. 
</P>
<P>
Now, more than five years later: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tyson is the heavyweight champion of the world, undefeated as a pro, the 
highest paid athlete in history. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hickman is dead, shot recently in a drug-related, execution-style shooting 
in Akron. 
</P>
<P>
When he was 17, Todd Hickman had superstar written all over him. 
</P>
<P>
He was tall and skinny -- you could count every rib -- and on his way to being 
a middleweight one day. I've seen every outstanding U.S. amateur boxer since 
1982. Todd Hickman might have been the best. 
</P>
<P>
He was Mr. Personality in 1984, with movie star looks and a smile that belonged 
on billboards. 
</P>
<P>
He was notoriously undisciplined, but when he flashed the Smile, coaches had 
great difficulty remaining angry with him. One reason they were frequently 
angry was his trouble with making weight for important amateur bouts. 
</P>
<P>
Once, on the first day of a 1984 amateur boxing trip to the Soviet Union, 
Hickman, giggling like a child all the while, bought all the candy bars from a 
vending machine at the Colorado Springs airport. He stuffed them in a sack and 
took them along on the plane, hiding them from the coaches and team manager. He 
knew perfectly well he'd have to make 119 pounds in Moscow in four days. 
</P>
<P>
Four days? Four days is next year. That was Hickman. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, however, Wylie Farrier, the team manager on that trip, learned of 
Hickman's candy bars and took them. 
</P>
<P>
Farrier, 63, a retired Cleveland police officer who has been involved in 
amateur boxing in Ohio for 30 years, tried to speak at Hickman's funeral in 
Akron, but couldn't. He broke down and cried. 
</P>
<P>
But the other day, he did talk about Hickman. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a kid who never worked all that hard at boxing and yet, when he was 
17, he beat everyone in the world in his weight class," Farrier said. 
</P>
<P>
"On that trip to the USSR in early 1984, he boxed Yuri Alexandrov in Moscow. 
Alexandrov was the reigning world bantamweight champion, and Hickman beat the 
hell out of him. And he'd eaten half a bag of candy bars on the plane before I 
caught him. I don't know how he made weight for that bout, but he did." 
</P>
<P>
I saw the Hickman-Alexandrov bout that night in Moscow. I had seen Alexandrov 
several times previously. He was a 24-year-old man, a world-class boxer. 
Hickman beat him so easily it took my breath away. 
</P>
<P>
My two most vivid memories of Hickman are of him laughing while he fed quarters 
into the Colorado Springs candy machine, and the joy on his face after they 
took off his headgear, just after the final buzzer when he beat Alexandrov. 
</P>
<P>
Hickman was "a sweet kid," who might have been loved too much, Farrier said. 
"It tears me apart, just thinking of him. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a broken home-type thing. He had great parents, who loved him 
dearly. His dad tried to discipline him, but it was hard for him because Todd 
was such a sweet kid. Every time I saw Todd, he'd give me a hug. 
</P>
<P>
"But he always gave me a feeling that he was in a hurry for some reason, that 
he'd better do everything as quickly as he could, because he wouldn't be around 
too long. 
</P>
<P>
"He fell in with a bad crowd a few years ago. The drug scene started, and that 
was the beginning of the end. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe (it happened) because he was such a gifted athlete . . . that because 
boxing came so easily to him, he thought he could break away from that drug 
scene at any time, just as easily as he became a great boxer." 
</P>
<P>
Hickman served 18 months in state prison on drug and weapons charges about two 
years ago. Police believe that Hickman, who was unarmed, was killed by a man 
with whom Hickman fought in prison. The killer is still at large. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Hickman was shot first in the shoulder, then in the back of the 
head, while he was on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
The Hickman case brings to mind another outstanding amateur boxer from the 
class of '84 who also didn't make the team that year, Michael Nunn. 
</P>
<P>
Now a pro middleweight champion, Nunn can't get a rich matchup with the 
division's marquee names because they make more money fighting each other. 
Current example: Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Roberto Duran. 
</P>
<P>
You wonder then, what might have been if that big show in Las Vegas on Dec. 7 
were Michael Nunn vs. Todd Hickman. 
</P>
<P>
And you wonder, always, why it ended this way.

SHELL ISN'T CONTENDING RAIDERS IN CONTENTION; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: COACH DOWNPLAYS TEAM'S SUCCESS, OTHER THAN TO SAY IT HAS PLAYED 
WELL AT 4-1 SINCE HE TOOK OVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
They're dancing in the hallways at the Raider facility in El Segundo but in the 
coach's office, calm prevails. 
</P>
<P>
A contender at last? 
</P>
<P>
"As I've said to you, I don't even want to speak in those terms," Art Shell 
said Monday, a day after his team, for the second consecutive week, made a meal 
of what was advertised as a quality opponent. 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing good football. We're playing tough football. I don't want to 
predict what we will be. All I know is what we're doing and that's playing 
competitive football." 
</P>
<P>
Shell kicked off this rally by taking the pressure off his players who were 
dragged along into Mike Shanahan's pressure cooker. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Shell is actually up there with the playoff hopefuls, he is 
maintaining his posture of trying to deflect everyone's attention from the 
bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Raiders are contenders, know it and are delighted. 
</P>
<P>
If the season were over, they'd have the first wild-card spot and would play 
host to Cincinnati in the wild-card game. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the way the American Conference wild-card candidates go, with their 
won-lost and conference records, which would break ties: 
</P>
<P>
Raiders, 5-4, 4-3; Cincinnati, 5-4, 4-3; Miami, 5-4, 4-4; Houston, 5-4, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Raiders have a chance to be something the AFC has rarely had 
since the last heyday of the silver and black: a dominating team. 
</P>
<P>
Since Shell took over, the Raider defense has allowed an average of 91 yards 
rushing a game and 3.5 an attempt. Over a full season, this would make the 
Raiders No. 3 in the league in both categories. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders, meanwhile, have averaged 161.6 yards rushing and a startling 4.99 
a carry. Over a season, that would project to Nos. 2 and 1, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
In Shell's tenure, the Raiders have recorded 14 sacks, allowed eight. 
</P>
<P>
Under Shell, the Raiders have taken the ball away 17 times, and given it away 
10. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion of the Raider game owes much, of course, to Bo Jackson and his 
7.4-yard average, but there's more working here. 
</P>
<P>
Fullback Steve Smith, a fine blocker -- his lead block sprang Jackson on 
Sunday's 92-yarder -- and a good receiver, has a 4.1 average, and has had it 
all season. He was at 4.4 when Bo began playing. 
</P>
<P>
The young Raider line, with 28-year-old Don Mosebar the only starter over 26, 
has come a long way. The new left tackle, Rory Graves, has slowed his string of 
holding calls. The new right tackle, Bruce Wilkerson, has been solid. 
</P>
<P>
Against Philadelphia, while helping hold Reggie White to no sacks, Wilkerson 
irritated the dreaded Eagle into accusing Wilkerson of holding, which any 
offensive lineman would recognize as a compliment. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a higher compliment: rookie right guard Steve Wisniewski has been as 
good as the Raiders hoped he would be on draft day. 
</P>

"I told him this morning, 'You're playing at a level of performance that's just 
as good as any guard in this league, whether it's an old guy or a new guy,' " 
Shell said.

<P>
"All his future's ahead of him. He's going to be an outstanding lineman in this 
league. I expect him to play in the Pro Bowl within two years. That's the kind 
of player he's capable of being."

The Steve Beuerlein watch, Week 2: Art Shell says that if Beuerlein's back, 
he'll start. Shell says he expects Beuerlein to practice this week, too. . . . 
Jerry Robinson didn't dress because of his concussion. Shell: "He was on the 
sideline. I told him, 'You're an assistant coach, unofficially.' He asked me: 
'Do I get double pay?' I said. 'Not with the money you earn, you don't.' " . . 
. Safety Eddie Anderson was held out with his hamstring pull, though Shell says 
he could have played, if needed.

DONAHUE DODGES OFF-FIELD CRITICISM; 
</P>
<P>
UCLA: COACH SAYS IT'S UNFAIR THAT HE TAKE THE BLAME FOR PLAYERS WHOSE ACTIONS 
HAVE RESULTED IN CRIMINAL CHARGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the headline writer said, it's hunting season in Westwood. And UCLA Coach 
Terry Donahue, enduring only his second losing season in 14 years, is the prey. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I've become an idiot in a period of about three months," Donahue 
said Monday. "Prior to the season, I was a little smarter than I am today, and 
I realize that. That's football coaching." 
</P>
<P>
Letter writers and columnists have recently taken him to task for his strategy, 
his play-calling, his personnel decisions, his choice of assistant coaches and 
even his work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
None of that, however, seemed to bother Donahue as much as an article published 
last Thursday in the UCLA student newspaper in which reporter Matt Purdue wrote 
that Donahue should be held accountable for the off-the-field transgressions 
that, as much as six losses in nine games, have soiled the Bruins' image this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
"UCLA football is out of control," Purdue wrote in the Daily Bruin. "When 
players' names begin to be seen more on the police blotter than in the postgame 
statistics, all the questions, all the doubts, all the second-guesses are 
directed at one person: The head coach." 
</P>
<P>
Purdue wrote his commentary after defensive tackle Stacey Elliott was charged 
last week with battery, becoming the fourth UCLA player to face criminal 
charges in the last six months. Elliott allegedly grabbed the buttocks of two 
female students in separate incidents last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, linebacker Roman Phifer and cornerback Damion Lyons beat up a campus 
security officer and last September they were convicted of battery. Free safety 
Willie Crawford was found to be in possession of stolen credit cards last June 
and was convicted last August of theft. 
</P>
<P>
Phifer, Lyons and Crawford were suspended for the season. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, cornerback Anthony Burnett flunked out of school last summer and 
split end Kerry Ferrell, who was Crawford's roommate and was with Crawford at 
the time of Crawford's arrest, left the team unexpectedly a week before the 
start of the season and returned home to Piscataway, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Does Donahue feel responsible? 
</P>
<P>
"I think that when you are in a position of responsibility and authority, you 
are ultimately responsible, to some extent, for almost everything that 
happens," he said. "Now, there are some things that are beyond your control. 
</P>
<P>
"For instance, you cannot be with a particular individual who's in your program 
24 hours a day and I think anybody who doesn't recognize that is very immature 
and very naive. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Are parents responsible for everything that their child does? Up to a point, 
they're implicated, certainly. And then there comes a point where that 
responsibility has to fall on the shoulders of the individuals." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue also took exception to an article written last month by columnist Steve 
Bisheff of the Orange County Register. 
</P>
<P>
"(He) said my work ethic wasn't good because I played tennis at noon for one 
hour," Donahue said. "I would tell the press that that's irresponsible 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
"When I won seven bowl games, my work ethic was fine. But I'm having a crappy 
season and my work ethic's lousy because the guy happened to see me coming off 
the tennis court at noon during two-a-days. 
</P>
<P>
"My work ethic hadn't changed, but that reporter decided that it had. Just like 
the reporter from the Daily Bruin decided that I'm responsible (for the Bruins' 
off-the-field problems). . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very, very comfortable with the image and the example that I've tried 
to show as the head football coach by my own personal behavior, by my talks 
with the football players. 
</P>
<P>
"But am I involved (when they get into trouble)? Yeah, I guess I am. I'm the 
head coach." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue said that he is as troubled by the Bruins' tarnished image as by their 
poor record. 
</P>
<P>
But, addressing Purdue directly as he spoke at his weekly meeting with the 
media, he said: "I think what has to be remembered -- and what so often is not 
remembered -- is that a football team is an extension of society. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me ask you this: On a college campus, when they have a rape, is the 
director of admissions responsible for those rapes if they're committed by a 
student he or she admitted to the university?" 
</P>
<P>
The question, of course, was absurd, to use Donahue's term for Purdue's 
criticism. But Donahue, who personally recruits almost every player he brings 
on campus, obviously doesn't feel comfortable taking the blame for all of their 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's off-the-field problems, he said, have hurt the program. 
</P>
<P>
He does not believe, however, that the Bruins' transgressions will have 
long-lasting implications. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that whatever's been broken can be fixed," he said. "And I honestly 
believe that from the soles of my feet to the top of my head. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, fixing it can be a difficult process, but I honestly think that whatever 
has been broken can be fixed and made to be whole again. Or good again. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think, like Chicken Little, that the sky has fallen. There are a lot 
of things that need to be fixed, but I think they're fixable." 
</P>
<P>
The one attempting to fix them, though, is in the line of fire as the Bruins 
have lost four consecutive games for the first time since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he is looking forward to the end of the season, Donahue hesitated for 
a moment. "I would rather end the losing by winning than end the losing by the 
season being over," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
Coach Terry Donahue said he will use both Bret Johnson and Jim Bonds at 
quarterback against Oregon Saturday at 3:30 p.m. at the Rose Bowl. . . . Of 
Bonds, who completed seven of eight passes for 77 yards and the first touchdown 
of his UCLA career last Saturday against Stanford, Donahue said: "He came into 
the season with a real chance to be our starting quarterback and then things 
didn't work out. And now it's not working out for our team, so I think he 
should be given a chance." . . . Emmanuel Onwutuebe, a reserve nose tackle, cut 
his left arm last Thursday in an auto accident and probably won't play again 
this season.

Washington Redskins cornerback Barry Wilburn tested positive for crack cocaine 
use and was placed on the team's non-football injury list, according to a 
published report. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Times said Wilburn recently failed a third NFL drug test, this 
time for crack. 
</P>
<P>
League policy says a third drug-related offense means a "lifetime ban" with the 
possibility of reinstatement after a year.

NEWSWIRE: NEW JERSEY DEVILS NAME CUNNIFF AS NEW COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing uninspired play and the need for "a change of direction," the New Jersey 
Devils Monday fired Coach Jim Schoenfeld and replaced him with assistant coach 
John Cunniff. 
</P>
<P>
Cunniff was a coach for the Hartford Whalers and Boston Bruins before joining 
the Devils in May. Details of his contract were not available. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenfeld, 37, coached the Devils to the Stanley Cup semifinals two seasons 
ago, but the team dropped to 27-41-12 last season and failed to make the 
playoffs.

Chile's standing in international soccer may be in jeopardy in the wake of 
charges of conspiracy by FIFA, world soccer's governing body. 
</P>
<P>
The charges stem from a Sept. 3 match against Brazil, which was leading, 1-0, 
when Roberto Rojas claimed to have been hit by a flare thrown from the stands. 
Rojas later retracted his claims and has since been banned for life. Chile 
abandoned the match, saying its safety was endangered, and FIFA later awarded 
Brazil a forfeit victory. 
</P>
<P>
FIFA General Secretary Joseph Blatter said other Chileans seem likely to have 
colluded with Rojas in staging "the biggest attempt at swindle in the history 
of FIFA," making him "perpetrator and victim at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Possible measures include banning Chile from international tournaments for an 
unspecified period of time.

EL DORADO FILLS TOP SPOT IN 4-A WATER POLO FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three weeks ago, there was little doubt as to the team to beat in the Southern 
Section 4-A water polo playoffs. Corona del Mar High School stood alone. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings were undefeated and the odds-on favorite to win their third 
consecutive 4-A title. The came the fall, three losses which cost Corona del 
Mar the Sea View League title and the No. 1 ranking in the 4-A. 
</P>
<P>
Filling the void is El Dorado, champions of the Empire League. The Golden Hawks 
defeated Corona del Mar twice in the last three weeks, including the 
championship game of the California State tournament. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, El Dorado (22-3) is the No. 1 seeded team going into the playoffs, 
which begin Friday. Villa Park (22-4) is the second-seeded team, Sea View 
League champion Newport Harbor (17-9) third and Long Beach Wilson (17-8) 
fourth-seeded. 
</P>
<P>
And Corona del Mar? For the first time this decade, the Sea Kings are not one 
of the top four seeded teams. 
</P>
<P>
Success is nothing new to the Golden Hawks, who won three consecutive 3-A 
titles from 1985-87. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Hawks, who are led by Matt Maclear and Kyle Utsumi, will play Long 
Beach Poly (10-10) at El Dorado in the first round on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In other first-round games: 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (13-12) at Villa Park; Los Alamitos (13-14) at Newport Harbor; El 
Modena (10-10) at Long Beach Wilson; Buena Park (13-11) at Corona del Mar 
(19-3); University (12-12) at Foothill (16-10); Canyon (15-9) at Sunny Hills 
(17-9); Esperanza (21-6) at Millikan (17-10) 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-A playoffs, El Toro (20-5) is the No. 1 seeded team after defeating 
Capistrano Valley, 10-9, Thursday to win the South Coast League. The Cougars 
(22-1) are the No. 2 seeded team. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro plays Redlands (13-10) in the first round Wednesday at El Toro and 
Capistrano Valley plays host to Downey (13-11). 
</P>
<P>
In other first-round games: 
</P>
<P>
Edison (12-7) at Santa Monica (7-2); Mater Dei (16-9) at Gahr (15-11); Mission 
Viejo (12-10) at Orange (15-8); Woodbridge (20-6) at Marina (20-6); Fountain 
Valley (14-13) at Palos Verde (18-4)l; Costa Mesa (10-15) at Crespi (14-7). 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-A playoffs, Magnolia will try to improve on its best season. The 
Sentinels (20-6) won their first outright Orange League championship this 
season and will play host Don Lugo (12-7) Thursday in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
In other first-round games: 
</P>
<P>
Bolsa Grande (7-4) at No. 1 seeded South Pasadena (21-2); Brea-Olinda (17-7) at 
Alta Loma (20-5); Western (13-12) at Miraleste (19-5); La Quinta (13-6) at Webb 
(10-5). 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy (17-5) will play the winner of Mira Costa (12-14) and Sherman Oaks 
Notre Dame (9-6), which play in a wild-card game today.

MIRA COSTA IS FAVORITE IN 5-A GIRLS' VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With the division's four top-seeded teams sporting a combined 66-1 record, the 
Southern Section 5-A girls' volleyball playoffs figure to be wide open and too 
close to call. 
</P>
<P>
Figure again. 
</P>
<P>
Though 12 of the 14 teams in Thursday's first round have four losses or less -- 
four teams play in today's wild-card round -- there is one clear favorite: Mira 
Costa High School. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa (19-0) made it to the 5-A final last season against Irvine with a 
team of 10 juniors and two sophomores. The Mustangs lost that match, but 
returned everyone, and this season's team has beaten all of its top rivals who 
happen to be the top-seeded teams in 5-A. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar (14-0), the No. 2 seeded team and champions of the Sea View 
League, has played Mira Costa twice, losing a four-game match in the Tournament 
of Champions and a one-game playoff in the San Marcos Tournament. In girls' 
volleyball, tournament losses don't count against a team's overall record. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Brande, Corona del Mar coach, says his team has improved since those 
early-season losses. But he expresses the grim good news/bad news of the 
situation when he said, "I think we're much better, but I know they're much 
better also." 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa plays the winner of today's wild-card game between Bishop Montgomery 
and Trabuco Hills at Bishop Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar plays defending champion Irvine (8-6) in Thursday's first round. 
Laguna Beach (17-1), Pacific Coast League champion, is seeded fourth in the 5-A 
and will be home against Hueneme (10-4) in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
A team to watch is unseeded El Toro (12-4), which finished strong in the 
regular season, including a victory over South Coast League rival and champion 
Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Sunset League champion Fountain Valley is the only Orange County team seeded in 
the 4-A. The Barons are No. 4 and play Long Beach Wilson Wednesday in a 
first-round match at Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Freeway League champion La Habra is the top-seeded team in the 3-A division and 
will be home, Wednesday, against Sante Fe (10-7). Canyon is the division's 
fourth-seeded team and plays Fontana (10-4) at Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita (16-2), Olympic League champion, is seeded fourth in the 1-A 
and plays Pius X (13-7) in Wednesday's first round.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Corona del Mar High School girls' tennis team, the defending 4-A champion, 
is the No. 1 seeded team in the Southern Section 4-A playoff pairings announced 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
First-round play begins Thursday at 3 p.m. in all divisions. The championship 
matches will be played Nov. 21 at the Claremont Club. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar finished the regular season with an 18-1 record, winning the Sea 
View League championship. Last season, the Sea Kings defeated Miraleste for the 
4-A title. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Corona del Mar will face stiff competition from Palos Verdes, 
second-seeded with a 12-2 record, Miraleste (No. 3, 12-2) and Edison (No. 4). 
Edison (15-3 and the Sunset League champion) plays host to Estancia (14-5). 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar, which lost to only Capistrano Valley this season, is led by 
Keri Phebus, who plays No. 1 singles. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings play host to Beverly Hills (9-9) Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley, the 3-A runner-up last season, earned the No. 1 seeding in 
the 3-A and will have a bye. The Cougars, led by singles player Page Bartelt, 
are 16-1 and the South Coast League champions. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley has a bye in the first round and plays the winner of the 
Canyon-Riverside Poly match in the second round Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
San Marino, which beat Capistrano Valley in the title match last season, is 
seeded second. Dana Hills (14-1 and the South Coast League runner-up) is No. 3 
and plays host to Laguna Beach (12-5). Westlake (19-0) is seeded fourth. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-A, fourth-seeded Mater Dei (12-2) is the only seeded team from Orange 
County. The Monarchs play host to Long Beach Poly (7-7). Diamond Bar (20-0) is 
the top-seeded team.

BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: SHERMAN PAYS PRICE FOR HIS CARRIES

For Shane Sherman, success can be painful. The more yards he gains at tailback 
for Edison High's football team, the more often he gets the ball. The more 
often he gets the ball, the more his body hurts. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel it during the game, believe me," said Sherman, a senior. "When you 
carry the ball, you don't feel anything, you don't hear anything, you just see 
things." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, Sherman had a season-high 37 carries, running for 207 yards and two 
touchdowns in a 24-10 victory over Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
Giving the ball to Sherman, The Times' Athlete of the Week, has been a 
successful tactic for the Chargers (6-3 overall, 3-1 in the Sunset League), who 
are tied for first place in the league. 
</P>
<P>
In his first season as the Chargers' starting tailback, Sherman is the 
third-leading rusher in Orange County with 1,361 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Edison won the four games in which Sherman rushed more than 30 times, a 
statistic that isn't lost on Edison Coach Dave White. 
</P>
<P>
"When he's getting a groove going, we keep giving him the ball," White said. 
</P>
<P>
But as Sherman continues carrying the ball, he is torn between the fun and the 
pain. So much so that he is thinking twice about playing football in college. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't made that decision yet," Sherman said. "Ten years (playing football) 
is a long time for me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Brian Lucas of Corona del Mar ran for a school single-game record of 234 yards 
in 26 carries in a 25-8 victory over University Thursday. Lucas broke the 
record of 227 yards set in 1966 by Tom Westgate. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Nicholson of Pacifica scored two touchdowns on defense as the Mariners 
defeated Rancho Alamitos, 41-14, Friday. Nicholson recovered a fumble and ran 
90 yards for one touchdown. For the other, he returned an interception 83 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Trent Julian of La Quinta rushed for 132 yards and a touchdown in 13 carries 
and caught six passes for 62 yards in a 37-3 victory over Los Amigos Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Riddle of Rancho Alamitos carried the ball 52 times and gained 344 yards, 
Orange County's third-best single-game rushing performance ever, in a 41-14 
loss to Pacifica Friday. He increased his county-leading season rushing total 
to 1,938, breaking Rancho Alamitos' season record of 1,926 set in 1987 by Sean 
Cheatham. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Salinas, a Saddleback cross-country runner, won the Sea View League 
championship by running three miles in 14 minutes 53 seconds Friday.

Cara Dane's work around the volleyball net has her up around the clouds these 
days. 
</P>
<P>
After several stellar performances this season, Dane, a senior middle blocker 
at Los Alamitos High School and The Times' Athlete of the Week, is now flying 
the friendly skies of recruiting trips. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, Dane visited Duke University. Soon she will be taking a trip to 
California. In all, Dane said nearly 50 schools have contacted her. 
</P>
<P>
"I get sick of the calls from half of the (recruiters)," Dane said. "But it's 
also important to me because I want to get a scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday against El Dorado, Dane had 28 kills to lead Los Alamitos to a 15-5, 
15-10, 15-6 victory. On Thursday, she had 16 kills in a 15-3, 15-9, 15-4 loss 
to Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
"She can go anywhere she wants," Los Alamitos Coach Jami Moore said. "She has a 
3.8 (grade point average) and there is a scarcity of middle blockers. 
</P>
<P>
As with many top volleyball players, club volleyball has helped improve Dane's 
performance. Dane played with the Mission Valley Club before this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Club is where my whole game is," Dane said. "You have to try out for the team 
so the teams are generally better (than high school teams). It's a lot more 
intense -- but you can do more things with your ability." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the dropoff in competitive level from club play and league play, Dane 
is looking forward to the Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos (10-5 overall, 6-4 in the Empire League) has clinched third place 
and a playoff spot for the second consecutive season. Los Alamitos will play at 
San Gabriel Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

ASHER/GOULD HARD AT WORK ON IMAGE CAMPAIGN -- ITS OWN; 
</P>
<P>
ADVERTISING: A POWER STRUGGLE AMONG NAMESAKES HAS GONE ON FOR YEARS AT THE 
SUCCESSFUL BUT LOW-PROFILE L.A. AD AGENCY. A THIRD PARTY WAS CALLED IN TO RUN 
THE SHOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Few people outside the advertising world have heard of the agency Asher/Gould. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, even some in the business don't know much about this Los Angeles ad 
firm. That's why many executives in the local ad community were more than 
mildly surprised in recent weeks when this usually docile agency snatched the 
$15-million Baskin-Robbins ice cream account and then landed the much 
sought-after $20-million to $30-million Suzuki automotive business. 
</P>
<P>
Although Asher/Gould ranks among the 20 largest agencies in Los Angeles, it has 
traditionally kept a low profile. Its ads don't win many national awards. And 
its leaders rarely rub shoulders with the big shots on Madison Avenue. It 
simply creates ads that sell products. 
</P>
<P>
When Asher/Gould picked up the Suzuki and Baskin-Robbins accounts last month, 
it seemed to some that this suddenly hot agency could do no wrong. There is, 
however, a more complex story at Asher/Gould. With fast growth comes struggle. 
And during the past few years of accelerated expansion, a power struggle 
developed between the agency's two namesakes. 
</P>
<P>
Insiders at the firm say that despite Asher/Gould's recent success, its two 
founders have bickered for years. When one man talks, the other often corrects 
him. The rift reached a crescendo late last year when Harold Asher filed suit 
against his own agency. "It was an internal fight between Gould and myself," 
Asher said. "But we've agreed to make changes." 
</P>
<P>
That suit -- which the court ordered sealed -- was finally settled out of court 
last week, agency executives told The Times. At issue was management 
responsibilities. And in a bid to appease the agency's partners -- and keep 
clients content -- an executive who joined the company just four years ago has 
been named its new president. 
</P>
<P>
"You had two guys with basic differences of opinions," said Bruce Silverman, 
the new president. "Remember," said Silverman, who has been the agency's chief 
creative officer and was previously the creative head of BBDO/West, "this is a 
company that grew incredibly quickly in a short period of time." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, management shuffling and lawsuits are nothing new to the advertising 
world. But what makes these issues at Asher/Gould of particular interest is 
that, right now, the agency is considered one of the hottest on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
In a matter of weeks, Asher/Gould took on an estimated $45 million in new 
business. And in the past four years, the agency has tripled in size, with 
annual billings now of more than $100 million. During that same period, its 
employee roll more than doubled to 104 workers. Even the trade magazine Adweek 
has placed Asher/Gould on its list of "hottest" agencies in the West. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting an automotive account immediately positions you as a national agency 
with full capabilities," said Morley Gould, the agency's co-founder. "This has 
established us as a factor in the national marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
But it came at a price. Asher/Gould executives say they spent more than 
$200,000 to win the Suzuki business -- a massive amount for a mid-sized agency 
to spend for business that it had no guarantee of winning. "Every presentation 
you make is a bet," said Silverman. "We've been betting a lot the last few 
years -- and lately we've been winning." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, he is right. Besides Suzuki and Baskin-Robbins, the agency's client 
list includes advertisers like the Wherehouse record store chain and the 
California Egg Commission. And one of its largest clients is Pabst Brewing Co. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, Asher/Gould executives kept mum about the key management changes -- 
and the lawsuit that was filed by Asher in Los Angeles Superior Court in July, 
1988. After all, up to $45 million in new business was on the line with clients 
Suzuki and Baskin-Robbins. "With all the new business going on, we didn't want 
to confuse the prospects," said Silverman. 
</P>
<P>
The management changes actually took effect several months ago. Under these 
changes, neither Asher nor Gould holds the chief executive title. But it 
appears that Gould has lost some clout in the shuffle. A five-man executive 
committee -- on which Asher and Gould both serve -- will jointly make chief 
executive decisions. Asher, who had been president of the agency, has been 
named chairman of that key, decision-making committee. And Gould, who had been 
president of Asher/Gould, is now chairman of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
This is all a long way from the agency's humble beginnings. Asher and Gould 
have known each other since they were teen-agers. They attended Los Angeles 
High School together. Nearly 30 years ago they graduated from USC and founded 
Asher/Gould. It was decided then that Asher's name would come first, explained 
Gould, "because we wanted to be the top name in the Yellow Pages." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, Asher/Gould is the only agency that either man has worked for. And 
during those years, they have certainly won the respect of some competitors. 
</P>
<P>
"Asher/Gould is an agency that doesn't let artistic fantasy distort its 
mission," said Jack Roth, president of Admarketing, the Los Angeles agency that 
frequently competes with Asher/Gould for retail clients. "The purpose of ads is 
to sell things like cars and ice cream, and these guys understand that better 
than just about anyone." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Roth warned, "a good reputation can turn to a bad one in a 
week if you don't perform." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Asher/Gould has performed admirably for most of its clients. After 
an extensive review, for example, American Savings Bank recently decided to 
keep its annual $25-million account with the agency. Under its former name, 
American Savings &amp; Loan Assn., the S&amp;L required a federal bailout to 
survive insolvency. Asher/Gould quickly created commercials that bragged about 
one of the bank's strongest assets -- its highly rated customer service. 
Officials from the thrift said they were unable to find anyone else that could 
create more effective advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Suzuki said it picked Asher/Gould for one key reason. "They demonstrated a 
strong ability to focus in on who our customers are," said Tom Meyers, national 
advertising manager at American Suzuki Motor Co. The Japanese car maker saw 
sales slump last year after a consumer group said its Samurai sports utility 
vehicles were prone to rolling over. Even though the federal government 
appeared to refute those charges, Suzuki has since been plagued with a nagging 
image problem. 
</P>
<P>
To overcome that, Asher/Gould plans to create an ad campaign that "accentuates 
the positive aspects of Suzuki," said Silverman. "We will not devote any 
advertising to refuting charges that have been refuted enough." 
</P>
<P>
Now the shop that seems to specialize in helping clients overcome image 
problems appears to have one of its own. 
</P>
<P>
But officials at Asher/Gould say the agency always operates best under 
pressure. And that's the way it has always been. "We're a great fourth-quarter 
agency," said Silverman. Even the agency that competed with Asher/Gould for the 
Suzuki business gives the firm high marks. "They're known for one thing -- 
retail advertising that sells product," said Kent Cooper, vice president of 
public relations at Hakuhodo Advertising. "Suzuki badly wants to move product, 
and that's Asher/Gould's strength." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone, however, sings high praises for Asher/Gould. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning they promised us a lot, but in the end they didn't deliver," 
said Ben Frankel, vice president of merchandising at Aaron Bros., the City of 
Commerce-based art supply chain. In fact, Frankel was so unhappy with the 
results from the agency that he fired Asher/Gould after less than one year. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of political infighting among the troops," said Frankel. "The 
inside politics got in the way of good business." 
</P>
<P>
But Asher/Gould executives insist that the inner squabblings are all over now. 
</P>
<P>
"The story isn't the lawsuit," insists Silverman. "The bigger story is that we 
have a new management team and we're all working together now."

ANTI-TAKEOVER LAWS CAN HELP EVEN UP THE ODDS; 
</P>
<P>
BUYOUTS: EXPERTS SAY RESTRICTIONS ON HIGHLY LEVERAGED CORPORATE RAIDS ARE OFTEN 
EFFECTIVE TACTICAL WEAPONS. 
</P>

<P>
The state anti-takeover laws that the U.S. Supreme Court chose not to review 
Monday can be formidable obstacles to highly leveraged hostile takeovers, 
although as a practical matter the laws probably aren't blocking many such 
deals at present, takeover experts say. 
</P>
<P>
The court declined to reconsider Wisconsin's anti-takeover law, which says a 
bidder for a company's shares must wait three years to take full control of the 
firm if the target's board won't approve the deal. Such laws -- which require a 
five-year wait in some cases -- are designed to fight off bids that are 
financed with heavy borrowing and require sales of the target company's assets 
to quickly pay off debts. 
</P>
<P>
These laws became popular in the mid-1980s as companies and their allies in 
state legislatures became alarmed at the seeming ease with which corporate 
raiders could sell high-yield junk bonds, take control of a target company and 
sell off divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Today, about 24 states have such laws, including Delaware, where more than half 
of the nation's largest industrial concerns, the Fortune 500, are chartered. 
California does not have an anti-takeover statute. 
</P>
<P>
Such laws are less of an issue in the takeover world today than they were even 
a year ago, however, because the number of such highly leveraged deals is 
rapidly dwindling. As the failure of last month's bid for UAL Inc. dramatically 
illustrated, it is now harder to raise money for takeovers through the sale of 
junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The junk bond market has become less active, and commercial banks are more 
leery of extending loans to would-be acquirers who rely on junk financing. In 
addition, some tax law changes have reduced the incentives for highly leveraged 
offers, takeover specialists note. 
</P>
<P>
There is evidence that anti-takeover laws have had some effect. In New York, 
only one hostile takeover has taken place since the adoption of such a law in 
1987, according to John Coffee, a specialist in securities law at Columbia 
University. The successful bid was the acquisition of Irving Trust Co. by Bank 
of New York, which could complete the transaction without needing to quickly 
sell off assets. 
</P>
<P>
The laws clearly hinder takeovers in many other cases by making them more 
expensive and more time consuming. 
</P>
<P>
The laws can force a bidder, for example, to try to mount a proxy fight or 
shareholder vote to win a company. Very often, they force the bidder to raise 
his price high enough so that the board of directors cannot justify refusing 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the deals at the margins, the ones where the bidder can't afford the 
delay, or they can't raise the price, that these things affect," said Donald 
Bingle, a takeover lawyer in Chicago. "In combination with other defenses like 
the 'poison pills,' these laws have an important effect." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the laws are far from airtight. For one thing, directors have 
a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders; if board members reject an 
attractive offer, they may be dragged into court by those shareholders. 
"They're bound to accept a fair price, and they keep that in mind," said Stuart 
Shapiro, a New York takeover lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
There are other "outs" in Delaware's version of the law. In that state -- the 
major leagues of the takeover game -- a bidder can defuse the law by 
accumulating 85% of a company's shares. The three-year freeze also won't apply 
if management has approved another offer for the company. 
</P>
<P>
There's also a way for a buyer who's acquired a controlling share in a target 
firm to get his hands on some proceeds from asset sales within the three-year 
limit, Coffee says. While the owner can't sell assets of the target firm to his 
own company, he can order some assets sold to an outside company and then issue 
a dividend to all shareholders, including his own firm, Coffee says. 
</P>
<P>
Shareholder-rights advocates have also claimed that the laws can be 
circumvented if the bidder is willing to offer rich incentives to the target 
company's board of directors. "All they have to do is offer rich severance 
contracts to the management, and they can get the board's blessing," said Ralph 
Whitworth, director of United Shareholders Assn., a group formed by oilman and 
takeover artist T. Boone Pickens Jr. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the law's limited effectiveness, takeover specialists consider the 
federal appeals court decision that upheld the Wisconsin statute to be of great 
importance, because it seems to open the door for other restrictions on 
takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Frank H. Easterbrook of the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals found that 
"because states have the power to authorize takeovers, they also can determine 
the circumstances under which they can occur," said Shapiro.

COMPAQ INTRODUCES 2 COMPUTER SYSTEMS

Accompanied by indoor fireworks, laser lights and booming synthesizer music, 
Compaq Computer Corp. on Monday unveiled two computer systems, including one 
that it is touting as the world's most powerful desktop personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
The personal computer, to be known as the Deskpro 486-25, uses an Intel Corp. 
486 microprocessor as its heart and has three times the computing speed of its 
predecessor, which used a 386 chip. 
</P>
<P>
"Our new product offers true general-purpose flexibility . . . meaning it will 
not become obsolete," Compaq President Rod Canion said. 
</P>
<P>
"You could compare it to the IBM PS-2, Model 80, which is a floor-standing 
unit," he said. "But the Deskpro 486-25 has more expansion capability even 
though it sits on a desk." 
</P>
<P>
The Compaq announcement came one day before rival computer maker NCR Corp. was 
to unveil its 486-based personal computer. Unlike Compaq's, however, NCR will 
use a system similar to the IBM Personal System-2 line of personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
IBM has not introduced a personal computer built on the 486 chip yet, but it 
did come out with a card that lets users plug the 486 chip into their existing 
personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
The 486 chip is so powerful that it will allow personal computers to do certain 
jobs now done by engineering work stations, minicomputers and even mainframes. 
</P>
<P>
Compaq detected some minor problems with the chip last month and informed 
Intel, which has said it would begin shipping a fixed version of the chip by 
the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty about the new chip, combined with slowing sales in the American 
market, prompted Compaq last week to announce that its fourth-quarter earnings 
would be below those of a year ago. That announcement triggered a 15% plunge in 
the price of Compaq stock. 
</P>
<P>
Compaq's stock jumped 75 cents a share Monday in consolidated New York Stock 
Exchange trading, closing at $89.25. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, however, Canion and other Compaq executives were upbeat, telling 
about 1,000 dealers and computer experts who attended the lavish introduction 
that the new computer, along with a new Systempro personal computer system, 
represented another Compaq milestone in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
The Systempro system is designed for network and multi-user situations. It fits 
under a desk, yet has the computing power of minicomputers that require racks 
of equipment, according to Compaq. 
</P>
<P>
The Houston-based company's phenomenal growth came as it made computers that 
followed the IBM standard. Compaq, however, refused to follow IBM in 1987 when 
IBM brought out its Personal System-2 line, which use a new data pathway known 
as micro channel. 
</P>
<P>
Compaq and eight other personal computer makers deny IBM's assertion that micro 
channel is the way of the future and say they have found a way to extend the 
life of the old data pathway, which they call extended industry standard 
architecture, or EISA. 
</P>
<P>
The new Deskpro 486 will be offered in three models, ranging in price from 
$13,999 to $20,499, with first shipments expected at Compaq dealers by late 
December or January. 
</P>
<P>
The Systempro system, also in three versions, ranges from $15,999 to $25,999, 
with shipments to begin in December.

LAWSUIT ALLEGES $20 BILLION IN STEALTH FRAUD; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: UNSEALED COURT PAPERS CLAIM THAT NORTHROP OVERCHARGED THE GOVERNMENT 
FOR THE B-2 BOMBER FROM THE WORD GO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Five former employees of Northrop Corp. and one man who still works there 
asserted in a lawsuit unsealed Monday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles 
that the company has overcharged the government by about $20 billion on the B-2 
Stealth bomber program. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer unsealed an amended complaint in the 
suit, which adds many new charges and includes new plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
The basic thrust of the amended complaint is that Northrop's entire performance 
on the B-2 has been riddled with fraud from its initial work and that it has 
used a host of methods to overcharge the government. 
</P>
<P>
These include giving the government falsified progress reports on its 
production of the B-2, submitting false data on the amount of money spent to 
perform work on the B-2, mischarging labor costs, submitting false vouchers for 
the purchase and procurement of parts and materials and knowingly 
misrepresenting the progress made in the production and engineering status of 
"a crucial electronics system called ZSR-62," which is a classified system, 
according to the plaintiff's lawyers, Herbert Hafif and Philip Benson of 
Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
The original suit, filed in February, 1988, contained 17 counts alleging fraud 
and asserted that there were $2 billion of overcharges. The amended complaint, 
filed Monday, has 44 counts alleging fraud and contends that there have been 
$20 billion in overcharges. The suit does not give a detailed explanation of 
how the $20-billion figure was compiled. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed under the federal False Claims Act, a statute which allows 
private citizens to file suits on behalf of the government and share in any 
damages that the government ultimately recovers. The statute provides that the 
government has 60 days to decide whether it will intervene in a False Claims 
action and allows the government to take over any such suit, though the 
original plaintiffs are permitted to retain an active role in the case. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1988, the Justice Department announced that it had declined to 
intervene in this case. Assistant Atty. Gen. John R. Bolton said that after a 
review and investigation of the plaintiffs' allegations, the department decided 
"that there is not a sufficient basis for it to enter the case at this time." 
The government could still intervene in the case after reviewing the new 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio said Monday that the Beverly Hills-based 
company had just received the amended complaint and thus could not comment on 
it. He would only say, "the last time these people attacked us on the B-2 the 
government spent eight months investigating and found that there was 'not a 
sufficient basis' for government action. The B-2 is meeting its flight test 
objectives." 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs include Jean-Francois Truong, a former controller overseeing 
manufacturing technology on the B-2; Curtis Dane, an avionics engineer who 
worked in the B-2's final assembly plant in Palmdale; Terrence Schielke, a 
former senior auditor at Northrop; Eugene Ottaviano, a former manager of the 
electronic data processing audit department on the B-2; Richard P. Sylvester, a 
lawyer and engineer, who is a former strategic analyst on the B-2 program, and 
Richard Croswell, a former manager of engineering technology at Northrop. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also contains separate allegations that Schielke was unlawfully 
demoted after raising questions about fraudulent activity on the B-2 and that 
all of the other plaintiffs were unlawfully discharged from Northrop after 
raising objections about the alleged fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force plans to build 132 Stealth bombers, a plane that is designed to 
evade enemy radar through a combination of new and sophisticated technologies. 
The Air Force said in July that it plans to spend $70 billion during the next 
decade to buy the 132 planes. 
</P>
<P>
The company has been under considerable heat in Congress for delays in 
producing the plane and cost overruns. In court papers filed Monday, the 
plaintiffs assert that Northrop has garnered $23 billion from the government 
for its work on the program so far and that $5 billion of that sum is cost 
overruns. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most striking allegations in the amended complaint is that Northrop, 
after devising a highly sophisticated computerized conveyor for fabricating 
wire harness systems, took the system apart and used a 20- to 30-year-old 
technology to fabricate the wire harness assemblies. The suit alleges that 
Northrop did this because an examination of the sophisticated system would have 
revealed to the Air Force excessive cost and management system problems that 
were "causing chaos and confusion throughout the B-2 program."

POSTAL SERVICE PLANS PILOT FAX PROGRAM

The U.S. Postal Service, facing rivalry from a fax onslaught at high-tech homes 
and offices around the country, fought back Monday with a plan for a facsimile 
service to lure small businesses and private citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Under a contract with a private company, the Post Office will put fax machines 
in local offices, deriving income from renting the space and sharing facsimile 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
Post office fax users will pay by credit card to send documents worldwide 
around the clock in seconds, bypassing time-consuming, often unreliable postal 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Postmaster General Gordon Morison said the service, to be 
piloted in 54 Northeastern post offices, would be expanded to 263 post offices 
across the country and, if successful, installed in 8,000 post office sites 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we will provide other services of this kind for business to become 
one-stop shoppers," Morison said, referring to efforts to expand other lobby 
services suited to business and personal communication needs. 
</P>
<P>
The program begins today in Manhattan, and in the next month fax machines 
should flank post boxes in 40 New York, 10 Boston and four Rhode Island sites. 
</P>
<P>
Morison said the test locations are high-density business and residential 
areas, but plans also include rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
The first pilot program will be operated by Hotelecopy Inc., whose president, 
Edd Helms, said the self-service fax machine service will be initially priced 
at $12.75 for a three-minute transmission of about seven pages. 
</P>
<P>
Helms said the service is aimed at travelers and others who do not own 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knows that gut-wrenching feeling when you can't get your hands on 
that document that is necessary to consummate the deal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The machines will be able to send and receive fax messages and are aimed at 
small businesses and private users. 
</P>
<P>
"Today less than 25% of businesses and far less than 1% of residences have fax 
machines," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Miami-based Hotelecopy offers electronic communication systems to the public, 
mainly in hotel lobbies. 
</P>
<P>
Helms said MCI Communications Corp. would initially provide telephone 
communications 24 hours a day in 54 post offices. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Edgerton, MCI vice president for government systems, said the two 
companies have also bid jointly to provide the service to 209 additional test 
locations in four other U.S. Postal Service regions across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Helms said the initial contract covers the Northeast for one year, renewable in 
two two-year blocks for up to five years, and that under the contract the 
company would provide for all eventual expanded service in the region. 
</P>
<P>
He said the company would pay the U.S. Postal Service $150 a month per post 
office rental and an undisclosed share of the revenue generated from fax usage. 
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate equal usage sending and receiving," he said, noting that 
existing machines in its network of more than 2,000 hotel sites are used mostly 
for receiving faxes. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Postal Service officials said bids for the other regions are expected to 
close Nov. 15 and would be awarded within 60 days. They said seven bids had 
been placed for the Northeast service and that three bidders had demonstrated 
equipment.

Pepsi Logo Will Appear on Video Game: Next time the kids get thirsty while 
playing Nintendo, Pepsi-Cola has a new ploy to get them to say Pepsi, please. 
The soft-drink maker said the Pepsi logo will appear next year in a new, 
animated electronic video game called "Magic Johnson's Fast Break." The game is 
made by Tradewest, a licensee of Nintendo of America. The logo will appear 
twice in the video game -- once in the game's opening title sequence, and later 
as a court side sign in the animated basketball arena. Details of the agreement 
were not disclosed.

EX-CHIEF OF FAILED INSURER PLEADS INNOCENT TO FRAUD

The former head of Transit Casualty Co., a high-risk insurer that left up to $4 
billion in unpaid claims when it crumbled in 1985, has pleaded innocent to a 
charge of filing a false financial statement. 
</P>
<P>
George Pettengill Bowie, 64, Transit's former chairman and chief executive, 
entered the plea Thursday in Circuit Court after his indictment by a Cole 
County grand jury, county prosecutor Richard Callahan said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Transit's court-appointed liquidator, Burleigh Arnold, said Transit left $3 
billion to $4 billion in unpaid claims in all 50 states from mainly corporate 
customers with high-risk insurance policies, including policies on race horses 
and toxic waste dumps. 
</P>
<P>
That made Transit the biggest property and casualty insurance failure ever in 
this country, said Michael Barrett Jr., staff director for the House Energy and 
Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, which is probing the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Callahan kept the indictment sealed until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The charge stems from the company's 1984 financial statement, which indicated a 
$21.9-million surplus when in fact Transit's records were "incomplete, 
inaccurate, unauditable and in such a state that it was impossible to construct 
an accurate financial statement," the indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
The statement was filed with state regulators. 
</P>
<P>
"Their records were so unreliable they shouldn't have filed anything," Callahan 
said.

LABOR: WORKPLACE DEMOCRACY COULD REVITALIZE DOUGLAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's no doubt about it: The small group of executives at the 
multibillion-dollar McDonnell Douglas Corp. needed tremendous courage when they 
wisely decided earlier this year to revolutionize the way of life at their 
Douglas Aircraft subsidiary in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
They knew that they would create near-chaos initially among both managers and 
the 17,600 Douglas workers when they started trying to make the company a model 
of workplace democracy, probably the largest yet attempted in the United 
States. Workplace democracy means involving workers directly in company 
decision making. 
</P>
<P>
The executives also knew that, like most revolutions, their own would almost 
surely ignite a counterrevolution that could destroy the new system and further 
weaken the financially troubled company. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the revolution succeeded, success could take months and perhaps even 
longer to be realized, and a lengthy time lapse between the first wobbly 
beginning and a thriving workplace democracy could seriously hurt the company's 
already lagging production schedule and its standing on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
However, it was a gamble worth taking. The dramatic changes being made offer 
the best chance for Douglas employees to improve their jobs and incomes and for 
the company to start making substantial profits. 
</P>
<P>
Other giant corporations such as General Motors, Ford, and AT&amp;T have 
introduced workplace democracy in some of their facilities. But the joint 
venture of General Motors and Toyota at the New United Motors Manufacturing 
Inc. (NUMMI) plant in Fremont, Calif., is one of the few using the system as 
extensively as Douglas plans to do. And NUMMI involves far fewer workers. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas' entire organizational structure was streamlined. There was a drastic 
and much needed cut in the number of management levels. The number of workers 
in each team was sharply reduced to an average of nine, and they are headed by 
elected instead of company-appointed team leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Almost every working day at 4:30 p.m., top company executives meet with 
officers of the United Auto Workers or other elected worker representatives to 
jointly make decisions about almost all company policies. 
</P>
<P>
Human resources vice presidents and worker representatives have offices so 
close to one another that they can make daily decisions together by walking at 
most a few feet to talk to each other face to face. Most shop floor decisions 
are made by workers and their team leaders. In sum, Douglas ain't what it used 
to be just a few months ago, and it isn't what it will be in a few more months 
-- if, that is, all goes as the nervy company and union leaders plan. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more troublesome "ifs" is the infighting among members and officers 
of UAW Local 148 that represents most of the Douglas Long Beach workers. 
Another equally troublesome problem is the confusion and bitterness in the 
ranks of management. 
</P>
<P>
UAW Local 148 is badly split over both the concept of workplace democracy and 
the way that it is being implemented at Douglas. They are fighting each other 
more furiously than they often battled management in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Some, like a relatively small faction of UAW members and leaders across the 
country, see the new system as a sellout that allows both company and union 
officers to join forces and unfairly manipulate workers. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of delegates at the million-member UAW's last convention supported 
workplace democracy, but those who fear it continue denouncing those trying to 
make it succeed. 
</P>
<P>
And those who like it, such as UAW Local 148 President Douglas Griffith, have 
nothing but contempt for those trying to either get rid of the system directly, 
or indirectly, by demanding so many drastic changes that the system will die 
from the shock of major surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The naysayers at Douglas belong to a group called RAP (Responsible Action 
Program), and RAP members are linked to a nationwide dissident faction within 
the UAW called New Directions. 
</P>
<P>
One RAP member and former local official, Glen Plunkett, says workplace 
democracy may be able to succeed at Douglas, but not while men like the local's 
president, Griffith, have anything to do with it. That's a clear sign that 
internal union politics are a factor in the system's future at Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
But Griffith exudes confidence: "We want to get to a self-managing work force, 
where managers are coaches, mentors and cheer leaders, not traditional 
policemen." 
</P>
<P>
Also optimistic is UAW Regional Director Bruce Lee, who is an architect of the 
system that is working so well at NUMMI and is helping to make it operational 
at Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
The system can function well if Lee and others in the UAW can minimize union 
politics and get the workers to cooperate both with each other and with 
management. Lee insists that will be done. 
</P>
<P>
The other big "if" in the path of success at Douglas is the cooperation of 
company managers, some of whom are frustrated by the drastic change that has 
already taken away much of their old authority. 
</P>
<P>
That management side of the problem began when key corporate executives shocked 
5,200 managers, supervisors and other company executives last February by 
telling them that they were not being fired but that almost all of their jobs 
were being eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Those who wanted to could stay by reapplying for a job and passing personality 
and other tests to make sure that they really were leaders who could be team 
players, not just order-givers. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, so abruptly announced, that managers must democratize or get out 
badly damaged morale. The goal of bringing about the necessary sweeping 
attitudinal changes could have been handled with more finesse. 
</P>
<P>
But at least Douglas managers are not uncertain now about the general direction 
that they are supposed to be going as managers. And when their roles are 
defined more clearly, they can join Doulgas workers and the union in 
effectively implementing an exciting example of democracy in the workplace.

TREASURY CANCELS AUCTION OVER DEBT CEILING DISPUTE

Congressional inaction on a bill raising the federal debt ceiling forced the 
Treasury to postpone its weekly bill auction Monday and threatened the 
government with its first default in history. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury had planned to offer $16 billion in three- and six-month bills 
Monday, but postponed the sale "because Congress has not completed action on 
legislation to increase the statutory debt limit." 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury lost further borrowing authority Oct. 31 when the debt limit 
reverted from $2.87 trillion to $2 trillion. Because it already has reached the 
lower limit, the government faces default on some of its debt as early as 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said last week that if Congress fails to 
increase the limit by today, "the government will run out of cash and default 
on Nov. 9" when about $13.8 billion in Treasury bills mature. 
</P>
<P>
"Each day that Congress fails to act, however, will cause additional disruption 
in our borrowing schedule, possibly resulting in higher interest costs to the 
taxpayer," Brady said in a speech to Maryland bankers. 
</P>
<P>
"To avoid these potential costs and the prospect of default, immediate 
congressional action is imperative," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The House has passed a $3.1-trillion debt ceiling, but action has been stalled 
in the Senate by Republican demands that it be accompanied by enactment of a 
capital gains tax cut, a top priority for President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The White House abandoned that effort Thursday, and Senate leaders from both 
parties were discussing legislation Monday to increase the limit. However, any 
bill approved by the Senate likely would differ from the House version and 
efforts to reach a compromise would require additional time. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Basham, deputy assistant Treasury secretary, told reporters last week 
that plans for $40 billion in additional borrowing this week probably would 
have to be postponed if Congress doesn't complete action on a new debt limit by 
today.

ADVISERS HIRED FOR POSSIBLE GRADCO BUYOUT 
</P>

Gradco Systems Inc. said Monday that it has hired financial and legal advisers 
in connection with a possible management-led buyout of the Irvine-based office 
equipment manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine firm announced in late September that its chairman, Keith B. 
Stewart, was pursuing a possible buyout of the publicly held company. In a 
statement Monday, Gradco reconfirmed that Stewart was still "actively pursuing" 
a possible buyout. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco, the world's largest supplier of collating and sorting equipment for 
office copiers, said it has retained the Lodestar Group, a Los Angeles 
consulting firm specializing in leveraged buyouts, as a financial adviser. The 
company also said it has hired the Newport Beach law firm of Bruck &amp; Perry 
as its legal counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Gradco disclosed that it has been named in a class-action lawsuit 
filed Oct. 26 in Superior Court in Santa Ana. The suit, filed by Gradco 
shareholder Moise Katz, alleges that Gradco officers and directors may have 
breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the Stewart buyout offer, 
Gradco said. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco officials declined to comment on the suit. Katz could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
A copy of the suit could not be obtained late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Gradco said "management believes the action to be without 
merit, and based upon faulty premises. The company intends to vigorously defend 
the suit." 
</P>
<P>
Gradco also said it has appointed a special committee of the firm's two outside 
directors to review any buyout proposal. The committee has retained separate 
financial and legal advisers. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts have speculated that the buyout plan might involve a Japanese bank or 
investment consortium because Gradco does about one-third of its business in 
Japan and is a supplier to all of Japan's leading office copier makers. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco made its announcement about the buyout after the stock market closed 
Monday. The company's shares fell $1.375 per share to $16.75 in heavy trading 
on the over-the-counter market Monday.

MAJOR JUTE NATIONS OK TENTATIVE ACCORD

<P>
Major producers and consumers of jute have provisionally adopted a new 
international agreement designed to improve export earnings of Third World 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
A previously drafted text was approved at the end of a one-week conference and 
will be open for signing during all of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
It would then enter into force for an initial five years when the current 
international jute agreement expires in January, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Robert van Schaagen of the Netherlands, chairman of the conference, said the 
Soviet Union "gave a very strong signal" that it would sign the new accord. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Soviets are the world's biggest importer of jute with a share of 
around 12%, they did not join the existing agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The new accord, like the existing one, contained no provisions to control 
prices by means of stocking and market intervention. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the five countries that account for 99.6% of annual world exports of 
jute will receive assistance in quality improvement and marketing aimed at 
stabilizing and increasing demand as well as prices. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said prices are improving but consumption last year of 2.9 million 
tons was the lowest since 1975 because of competition from synthetics, although 
jute has the environmental advantage of being biodegradable.

GALLO TAX EXEMPTION WORKS FOR THE VERY RICH; 
</P>
<P>
REGULATIONS: A GRANDPARENT MAY GIVE $2 MILLION TO EACH GRANDCHILD AND PAY NO 
MORE THAN THE STANDARD GIFT-ESTATE TAXES, BUT ONLY UNTIL DEC. 31. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALBERT B. CRENSHAW, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In writing the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Congress devoted a lot of time to 
closing loopholes for the rich. 
</P>
<P>
One that was given particularly harsh treatment was the "generation-skipping 
transfer," a once-common device by which wealthy people shifted assets to their 
grandchildren, thereby cutting out one level of estate tax. 
</P>
<P>
But nobody loves a loophole as much as Congress. In a provision that was 
particularly beneficial to the wealthy winemaking Gallo family of California, 
Congress wrote in a temporary exemption for generation-skipping transfers of up 
to $2 million per grandchild. 
</P>
<P>
Under the "Gallo exemption," as it is known, a grandparent can give during life 
or bequeath at death $2 million to each grandchild and pay no more than the 
standard gift-estate taxes. Those taxes are not insignificant, especially on 
large amounts, but they are still a lot less than the double whammy that will 
be accorded such transfers after the exemption expires. 
</P>
<P>
That expiration date is coming up in just a little less than two months. Assets 
transferred across generations after Dec. 31 will bear the full brunt of the 
1986 law. 
</P>
<P>
There will remain an exemption of $1 million per grandparent for transfer after 
Jan. 1, which applies to other descendants, while Gallo is restricted to 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
For very large transfers, the generation-skipping tax can be staggering. On an 
estate of $20 million left entirely to a grandchild, taxes could reach almost 
$16 million, said Jack Porter of the accounting firm BDO Seidman in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The $20 million would be subject to a 55% ordinary estate tax -- the impact of 
graduated rates applicable to lesser amounts can essentially be ignored when 
the estate is this big, he said -- cutting it to $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
Then a 55% generation-skipping tax would be applied to the $9 million, reducing 
it to $4.05 million, Porter said. 
</P>
<P>
"The moral is, if you have a generation-skipping will or estate plan, it would 
be advisable to die before Jan. 1," he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
The impact at lesser sums is not as spectacular but still worth avoiding when 
intergenerational transfers are contemplated. For most people, other planning 
avenues will be sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes great wealth even to consider" using the Gallo provision, said 
William G. Brennan of Ernst &amp; Young. The $1-million-per-grandparent, 
generation-skipping transfer tax exclusion, an exclusion from the tax for 
payments of tuition and medical expenses -- along with the exclusion of $10,000 
per recipient per year from all taxes -- will cover as much asset shifting as 
all but the very wealthy are likely to make. 
</P>
<P>
"The real point about Gallo," said Sam Radin, president of National Madison 
Group, an estate planning firm in New York, "is if it may apply, consider it. 
Make an informed decision to take advantage of it or ignore it, but don't lose 
the opportunity through the passage of time." 
</P>
<P>
Experts agree that the Gallo provision also has serious disadvantages, said 
Greg A. Nelson of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., and so "a lot of people don't seem 
to be rushing out and using" it. 
</P>
<P>
The first problem is that the grandparent would have to pay gift tax on amounts 
of more than $600,000 (or $1.2 million in the case of two grandparents). These 
rates are stiff, Nelson said, and "nobody tends to be interested in writing 
large checks to the IRS unless they have to." 
</P>
<P>
He added, though, that with assets likely to appreciate substantially, the 
value of escaping estate taxes on the later appreciation may well exceed the 
present value of the current gift taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Giving away a large insurance policy -- which will appreciate at the death of 
the insured -- can be a useful strategy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem is that outright gifts create wealthy grandchildren -- 
something that may not be desirable if they are very young or no good at 
handling money. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible to leave assets in trust and still qualify, but the rules are 
very strict, and the trust must begin paying income when the beneficiary turns 
21. 
</P>
<P>
The rules under Gallo prohibit providing the intermediate generation with an 
income interest, so the grandparent cannot leave the assets in trust for the 
grandchild with the income to go to the grandparent's children.

In what may be the final indignity of man, companies are asking retiring 
workers to leave their brains behind, stored on a computer disk. 
</P>
<P>
"Expert system" developers are picking the brains of longtime employees and 
storing their expertise on floppy disks. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Herrod of Dallas-based Texas Instruments Inc., an expert in artificial 
intelligence, said that not everyone is a candidate for expert systems. The 
best prospects are people who know more about a particular job than anyone else 
-- in other words, experts. 
</P>
<P>
"You build an expert system when you have a significant specialized knowledge 
that exists only in a few people's heads and is acquired through years of 
experience," said Herrod, who recently attended the Instrument Society of 
America's annual conference in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Herrod developed one of his first expert systems for Campbell's Soup Co., where 
Aldo Cimino, an employee with 46 years of experience in the soup sterilization 
process, was about to retire. 
</P>
<P>
Cimino was the trouble-shooter for 72-foot-high sterilizers in which 68,000 
cans of soup at a time are heated to 250 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"If one of those breaks down, you're up to your ears in bad soup," Herrod said. 
"So when there was a problem the people at the plant couldn't fix, they'd call 
in Aldo. He had a lot of little tricks and knew how to figure out the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Cimino, who worked at the company's Camden, N.J., headquarters, said he was 
apprehensive when his boss asked him to put everything he knew about his job on 
a computer disk. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I thought, 'Oh my God, they're going to get rid of me,' " said 
Cimino. "But then I realized that I was 64 years old and getting ready to go 
anyway. They just wanted to save some of what I knew. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt weird at first," he said. "But I got used to it. It's like I left a 
piece of myself at that plant." 
</P>
<P>
It took seven months for a team of so-called knowledge engineers to pump 46 
years worth of know-how from Cimino and store it on floppy disks. When they 
were finished, Cimino retired. He said the company didn't pay him any more 
money for picking his brain. 
</P>
<P>
"I never made a dime, but I'm not complaining. The company always treated me 
good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell's now has a floppy disk that serves as a permanent consultant when 
trouble brews. 
</P>
<P>
"Now when something goes wrong with a sterilizer, the maintenance people can 
stick a floppy disk into an IBM PC, call up the expert system, and interact 
with it much like they were dealing with Aldo on the phone," Herrod said. 
</P>
<P>
But Cimino said the computer knows only about 85% of what he does. 
</P>
<P>
"I picked up a lot of information over the years," he said. "There are certain 
things that have never gone wrong with the cooker that the computer won't know 
how to fix. There's always going to be a human factor." 
</P>
<P>
The expert systems are user-friendly, Herrod said. When the program is called 
up on the computer screen, it displays some basic information, asks the user to 
take some measurements, and provides a selection of replies to various 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
Herrod's team of engineers also has built expert systems for Corning Glass 
Works and the Calgon Corp. But the technology is not limited to factories. 
American Express uses an expert system that reads credit cards and decides, 
based on someone's spending history, if the cardholder can make a particular 
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Instruments developed an expert system for United Airlines that manages 
the assignment of airport gates at Denver's Stapleton Airport and O'Hare 
Airport in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"We captured the experience of their gate-scheduling people and installed 
computers at the workstations," Herrod said.

MGM Grand Inc. plans to pay $123 million in cash and stock for 117 acres on the 
Las Vegas Strip for its movie studio theme-park resort, the Beverly Hills 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
The company had announced Oct. 3 that it planned to buy property at Tropicana 
Avenue and Las Vegas Boulevard to develop the theme park and a 5,000-room 
hotel, but did not say how much it was going to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the project, which would include a working movie studio, is set 
to begin in 1991.

TAX-FREE SAVING PLAN CAN HELP PAY FOR COLLEGE 
</P>

<P>
Starting Jan. 1, parents can take advantage of a savings bond program that will 
allow them to put away money for their children's college education tax-free. 
</P>
<P>
The program involves the U.S. Treasury's Series EE savings bonds, which have 
been around for years. The difference is that federal tax on the bonds' 
interest will be forgiven if the proceeds are used for tuition. Savings bonds 
always are exempt from state and local taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The program is limited to residents at least 24 years old who meet certain 
income requirements: married couples with adjusted gross incomes of $60,000 a 
year and under, and single people with incomes of $40,000 and under. 
</P>
<P>
For those with higher incomes, the tax-deductibility is reduced according to a 
scale. Married couples with incomes of $90,000 and over and singles with 
incomes of $55,000 or more cannot participate. 
</P>
<P>
The bonds may only be bought by parents for their children; other relatives may 
not participate. 
</P>
<P>
Using savings bonds to put away money for college education has long been 
popular, but the 1986 federal tax code revision made it less advantageous. 
</P>
<P>
Before the tax law changes, parents typically would buy bonds in their child's 
name and declare the interest as income on tax forms filed for their children. 
This way, the child usually would pay no tax since the interest income would be 
lower than the child's minimum taxable income. 
</P>
<P>
However, the revised code taxes children under age 14 at their parents' 
marginal tax rate instead of at the children's rate. That eliminated some of 
the tax advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The new program should restore the popularity of savings bonds for college 
tuition funding, said Stephen Meyerhardt, a spokesman for the Treasury's 
savings bond program. 
</P>
<P>
He said the new program is simpler than the traditional way of putting away 
college funds in bonds because there is no need to file annual tax forms for 
the children. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the bonds will be bought in the parents' names and interest will only 
be declared when a bond is cashed in to pay for tuition. He said the Internal 
Revenue Service is still working on rules for how this interest will be 
excluded from taxation. 
</P>
<P>
Series EE Treasury bonds sell for half their face value. The face value is paid 
at maturity. They can be bought for as little as $25 and are sold at most banks 
and savings and loans. 
</P>
<P>
Meyerhardt said the Treasury has been deluged with inquiries about the program. 
"Obviously, the potential audience is huge," he said last week. 
</P>
<P>
While university officials generally praise the savings plan, they say they 
wish it had been extended to grandparents and students as well. 
</P>
<P>
Richard F. Rosser, president of the National Assn. of Independent Colleges 
&amp; Universities, agreed there should be great demand for the program. 
</P>
<P>
"It's simple and it's uncomplicated," he said. "This may very well become an 
important savings program for just taking it out of your monthly wages. People 
have bought EE bonds for years through payroll deductions." 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first college bond program. Several states have marketed some 
of their normal state revenue bonds as tuition savings bonds. 
</P>
<P>
These bonds, like Treasury bonds, are zero-coupon bonds, meaning there is no 
annual interest payment, or "coupon." That's why they're sold at a discount, 
with their face amount paid at maturity.

TV MAKERS GEAR UP FOR THE BIGGER PICTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With television sets getting increasingly larger and cheaper, major 
manufacturers are gearing up to meet what they expect will be intense demand 
for sets with large screens. 
</P>
<P>
Toshiba, Matsushita, Thomson Consumer Electronics and, most recently, Sony each 
have announced plans to build new plants or expand existing plants in the 
United States to supply demand for large TVs, which are defined by industry 
observers as those with screens 30 inches or larger. French-owned Thomson makes 
RCA and General Electric brand TVs. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the large-TV phenomenon is consumers' desire for better picture 
quality, particularly to watch videocassettes. And technology called Improved 
Definition Television, now available, delivers roughly four times better 
resolution than older sets, said David Lachenbruch, editorial director of 
Washington-based Television Digest, an industry newsletter that follows TV 
sales trends. 
</P>
<P>
Price is still a barrier, with top-of-the-line Sony 32-inch sets retailing for 
$2,600. But those prices are partly a function of low availability. Lachenbruch 
and other industry observers expect those prices to drop substantially once 
supply increases after the new facilities begin operating. 
</P>
<P>
According to Television Digest, sales of televisions with large screens will 
total only about 300,000 units this year, less than 2% of the 22 million TV 
sets that will be sold in the U.S. But, by 1995, large TVs will represent 15% 
to 20% of all TVs sold and half of dollar volume, Lachenbruch said. 
</P>
<P>
Television sales in the U.S. now are dominated by 19-inch and 20-inch models, 
which are expected to account for 48% of the TVs sold in the United States, 
Lachenbruch said. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Sony announced plans for a $100-million addition to its San Diego 
TV manufacturing complex in order to transfer production of 32-inch Trinitron 
models from Japan. The highly automated addition will employ 220 workers and 
begin operations next summer, Sony spokesman Stephen Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
Sony now employs 3,600 at its San Diego and Tijuana plants, where the Japanese 
consumer electronics giant makes the bulk of its 13-inch, 19-inch, 20-inch and 
27-inch sets sold to the U.S. market. Sony will ship up to 1.7 million sets 
locally this year. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sony introduced its 32-inch model just one year ago, it now claims a 
20% to 25% share of the large-TV market, Burke said, or 60,000 to 75,000 sets a 
year. On Friday, Sony Corp. of America Chairman Masaaki Morita said the San 
Diego plant will be producing 32-inch sets at a rate of 250,000 to 300,000 
units a year by the end of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Toshiba previously announced plans to expand its Horseheads, N.Y., plant to 
produce 30-inch and 32-inch sets, Lachenbruch said. A joint venture of 
Matsushita Electric and Philips of The Netherlands is building a plant in Troy, 
Ohio to make 31-inch TVs. Matsushita makes Panasonic and Quasar brand 
television sets. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson is expanding its plant in Marion, Ohio, to make 32-inch and 35-inch TV 
sets. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson is the leading manufacturers of television sets in the United States,

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH

<TEXT>
<P>
One takeover does not a market make. Georgia Pacific's unsolicited bid to take 
over Great Northern Nekoosa last week gave the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
hope as it rose 33 points, making up some of the previous week's 92-point 
plunge. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, the market gave it all back and then some. The Dow lost 47 points as 
investors are lowering earnings expectations in the aftermath of disappointing 
third-quarter results, said Irving Katz, director of research at Thomas 
Green/San Diego Securities. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego stocks, particularly savings and loans, have been in their own bear 
market, Katz said. HomeFed continued to plunge as analysts lowered projected 
earnings estimates for 1989 and 1990. The stock closed Monday at $32.125, down 
from its October high of $47.50. Great American Bank hit a new low of $8.25, 
dropping $.375 for the week, while Imperial Corp. of America gained $.75 and 
continued a recovery from the previous week's low of $1.50. 
</P>
<P>
New lows were also recorded by Chart House Enterprises, Rohr Industries, 
Biomagnetic Technologies, Intermark and Mission West Properties. 
</P>
<P>
The only new high by a local stock was the result of a takeover. Chugai 
Pharmaceutical of Japan began a $6.25 per share bid for Gen-Probe stock. The 
stock, which went public in 1987 at $7, was selling in the $3 range when the 
offer was made, causing an instant doubling in price.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: PHARMACY OPERATOR PLANS 'POISON PILL' DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Syncor International Corp., a Chatsworth operator of high-tech pharmacy service 
centers, said it adopted a shareholder rights plan -- a common takeover defense 
often referred to as a "poison pill." The company said the plan is designed to 
ensure that its stockholders get a fair price for their shares should the 
company be the target of a hostile takeover attempt. But it said the move was 
not in response to any specific takeover threat. 
</P>
<P>
Gene McGrevin, Syncor's president and chief executive officer, said under the 
plan, shareholders would receive one "right" for each share owned. If a party 
acquires 20% or more of Syncor's shares without the consent of the company's 
board of directors, each right would give the holder the option to buy a Syncor 
share at half its market price. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Syncor received an unsolicited, $77-million buyout bid from the 
Lisle, Ill.-based investment banking firm Van Kampen Merritt, which said it 
made the offer on behalf of a client identified only as OSW Funding. Syncor 
rejected the bid, which expired a few days after it was offered. ICN 
Pharmaceuticals of Costa Mesa, which owns 8% of Syncor's stock, has also been 
rumored as a possible suitor.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: PERFECTDATA CORP. WINS PATENT-INFRINGEMENT SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PerfectData Corp., a Simi Valley maker of products for cleaning 
computer-related equipment, said it won a patent-infringement suit against a 
Chatsworth competitor. 
</P>
<P>
U. S. District Judge Pamela Rymer in Los Angeles ruled that a device made by 
Head Computer Products Co. infringed on a patent held by PerfectData on a 
similar product that it makes. The device is a diskette used to clean computer 
data-storage equipment. 
</P>
<P>
PerfectData said the court also awarded the company unspecified damages based 
on Head Computer's sales of its device since March, 1986, when PerfectData 
filed its suit. PerfectData President Lee R. Mannheimer said his company had 
not determined the amount of damages involved.

Players International said its net income for the second quarter, which ended 
Sept. 30, increased by nearly 16 times to $423,500 from $26,700 a year ago. 
Calabasas-based Players said its revenues for the period rose 45% to $4.1

<P>
For the six months that ended Sept. 30, Players said its net income soared to 
$3.3 million from $78,100 a year before, but the 1989 six months' figure was 
inflated by a one-time $3.5 million payment from a contract settlement. The 
company's revenues for the period increased 44% to $7.9 million from $5.5 
million a year ago.

SOARING DAVID PARSONS DANCERS SEEM TO DEFY GRAVITY IN PERFORMANCE AT UCSD

<TEXT>
<P>
David Parsons has an easy musicality, an active funny bone,and some interesting 
ideas in his bag of choreographic tricks. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night in San Diego, under blinking strobe lights that created a 
marvelous illusion of flight, Parsons awed the crowd in "Caught," his 
most-celebrated solo. The whistles and screams of approval began as soon as the 
dancer took flight on this exciting airborne romp across the Mandeville 
Auditorium stage. 
</P>
<P>
Parsons came down to earth regularly during the course of the dance, but you 
couldn't prove it by what you saw on stage. Every time the lights flashed on to 
capture the nimble dancer in action, he was hurtling through space in 
gravity-defying, mid-air maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
But Parsons was at his best in "The Envelope," where he revealed a great gift 
for parody; complex, lightning-quick encounters, and quirky motor patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Parsons' inventive signature piece, "The Envelope" takes plenty of shots at the 
dance world's sacred cows, and it hit the bull's-eye Sunday night with its wry 
moves and clever theatrical trickery. A black-hooded ensemble meandered through 
the zany eccentricities of its bent-backed moves with gleeful abandon, and made 
it a splendid curtain-raiser. It's unfortunate that the sound system was 
slightly out of control for this piece. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Parsons danced as a stellar attraction with the world-class Paul 
Taylor Dance Company. This trip, though, he was resident choreographer of his 
own troupe, the Parsons Dance Company, which has drawn itself a spot on the 
international dance map in just two short years. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-member troupe was bogged down with injuries when it made its Los 
Angeles debut last spring (even the boss was sidelined by knee surgery). On 
Sunday, only Dianne Howarth was out, with a herniated disk, and some hasty 
reshuffling was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Parsons danced four of the five works on the program. He even filled in for the 
ailing Howarth in one dance. The other six who joined Parsons for the company's 
premiere performance in San Diego were all nicely in tune with his mercurial 
style of movement. 
</P>
<P>
Parsons chose a representative sampling of his wares, including two of his 
best-known works -- "The Envelope" (1984) and "Caught" (1982), the dazzling 
solo that owes as much to high-tech theatrical wizardry as to Parsons' prowess 
as dancer/choreographer. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, some Tayloresque trademarks were apparent in Parsons' work. 
The Taylor veteran honed his skills with the master for nine years. And at 
times (particularly in the hard-driving dance designs for "Elysian Fields," 
which bombarded the senses with endless outbursts of physical force), Parsons 
ran out of ideas before the dance wound down to a close. "Sleep Study" offered 
a complete catalogue of mattress-based moves -- everything but resting, that 
is. Parsons, like Taylor, has an active comic imagination, and he put it to 
good use in this delightful bit of whimsy. Unfortunately, the poor rake at 
Mandeville makes it next to impossible to discern the floor-bound moves from 
most of the seats. 
</P>
<P>
The weakest offering was "Elysian Fields," which was designed as an outraged 
response to gratuitous violence but ended up as just another confusing example 
of it. The sword-wielding Parsons looked self-righteous as he engaged the 
ensemble with dangerous-looking swordplay. However, it was a case of sound and 
fury signifying nothing. In the end, the message was muddled. 
</P>
<P>
"Scrutiny" had its genesis in a personal experience for Parsons -- a cover 
story in Dance magazine that turned his company debut into a media event. 
Apparently, emotions got the better of Parsons here, because his motional 
patterns never quite caught up with the thematic content, and the dance quickly 
grew as tiresome as the music. 
</P>
<P>
Lighting designer Howell Binkley (who lit the entire program so artfully) 
bathed the dancers in cloudy cones of colored light and provided a suitably 
murky ambience for "Scrutiny," but there were too many overworked images in the 
dance designs (many looking like warmed-over Taylorisms). If the piece were 
half as long, it might have been twice as good. 
</P>
<P>
But Parsons seems to be closing in on what he wants. With a little shaping, his 
choreography career could turn out to be as bright as his dancing days.

'UNOFFICIAL' SOVIET ARTISTS PAINT A SPIRITED PICTURE OF PERSISTENCE; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET ART: THEY ARE ENGINEERS AND FURNACE-STOKERS, WHO CHOOSE TO CREATE 
ARTWORKS WITHOUT BEING MEMBERS OF THE OFFICIAL ARTISTS UNION. IT'S THE PRICE 
THEY PAY TO BE INDEPENDENT.

<P>
Like snapshots of a state of mind, two small images in the exhibition, 
"Contemporary Art from Leningrad," capture the essence of the Soviet artist's 
enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Shinkarov's painting, "Suite of Grief -- One Man Dancing," shows a 
bare room with brown floor, olive walls and gray ceiling. A single bulb dangles 
from its cord, illuminating the room's sole occupant, a man whose lumbering 
frame is bent at the waist, his arms outstretched, one thick leg slightly 
raised. Though oafish, the dance breaks the gloomy spell cast by the dank 
environment. It signals release, expressive freedom and the persistence of 
spirit of those whose conditions would seem to stifle such gestures. 
</P>
<P>
In Valentine Gerasimenko's etching, "Russian Dance," this contrast between the 
bleak and the ebullient resounds again. Here, three figures silhouetted in gray 
and black stand on a stark gray field, staring and motioning toward a spectacle 
in the sky. There, against a faint gray grid, leaps a majestic figure in red, 
blue and gold. His hair flutters and his wings of feathers and flaming patterns 
hold him aloft as he grips a palette in one hand and paintbrushes in the other. 
Like Shinkarov's dancing man, this one, too, revels in his unfettered 
expression, a burst of life and color within a still, empty landscape. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the thawing effects of glasnost and perestroika, the conditions of life 
in the Soviet Union remain remote and mysterious to most Americans. The work in 
"Contemporary Art from Leningrad: The Fellowship for Experimental Art" derives 
much of its power from an understanding of its context, but such striking 
metaphoric images as Shinkarov's and Gerasimenko's transcend any lapses in 
information. Creation, color, movement and imagination will persist, they say, 
even in the most stagnant, gray surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
As non-members of the Soviet Union's official Artists Union, the artists in 
this show -- which is shared by the David Zapf Gallery (2400 Kettner Blvd., 
through Dec. 2) and the San Diego Mesa College Art Gallery (through Nov. 29) -- 
are acutely aware of the value of persistence. Without membership in the union, 
they cannot be considered professional artists, and their incomes are not 
secured by the union's support of their art. Several in the show here work as 
furnace-stokers, engineers and poster designers to be able to pursue their art 
independently. 
</P>
<P>
They belong to the Fellowship for Experimental Art, a group established in 
Leningrad in 1981 to demonstrate, through exhibitions of members' work, that 
significant art is being made outside of the official union. This show, an 
"unofficial" offering of San Diego's Soviet arts festival, confirms that fact 
through a diverse display of paintings -- reverent, violent, melancholy and 
bittersweet, abstract, representational, crude and refined. 
</P>
<P>
Lenina Nikitina's painting, "Famine," pits needy against needy, with one 
woman's outstretched, empty hand answered by another's. A deep blackness 
swallows the figures, leaving them to suffer in a featureless abyss. In 
"Corpses," Nikitina shifts from deep, jarring colors to a somber, dusty palette 
to match the mood of the quiet march to bury the dead. 
</P>
<P>
Nikitina's paintings bear the haunting legacy of World War II, during which 
Leningrad succumbed to a devastating siege. They also serve as a requiem for 
the artist's mother and sister, who died of starvation during the war. 
</P>
<P>
The theme of the prodigal son surfaces twice in this show, once in vague, 
generalized terms and once in a specific, contemporary context. In Elena 
Figurina's painting, "Return of the Prodigal Son," the wayward young man lies 
face down, lifeless, on a solid green ground. Five figures in red stand above 
him in various postures of mourning, sadness and above all, helplessness. 
</P>
<P>
Kiril Miller's painting of the same name updates the biblical tale, casting the 
son as a punk, complete with safety pin earring and studded leather wristband. 
In another twist on tradition, the son here finds solace in the welcoming 
embrace of his mother, while his father looks on with an expression of 
disapproval and mild disgust. 
</P>
<P>
Societal tensions are also implied in the "Heroes Don't Die Series" of Inal 
Savchenkov and in Vladimir Shinkarov's sketchy vignettes of vodka drinkers and 
unmotivated workers. 
</P>
<P>
Other works in the show owe their intensity to the strength of their color or 
composition, rather than their social content. Dmitri Shagin's small landscape 
painting, "Three Trees," contrasts the deep, brooding colors of the land with 
the luminous gold of church domes, visible through equally brilliant yellow 
foliage. In "Lonely Horse," Valentin Savchenko splits the canvas down the 
middle and flattens the space on either side, giving a slight visual tension to 
his poignant view of a white horse on a blood red field. 
</P>
<P>
The most complex and arresting painting in the show, however, is aggressive in 
both form and content. Named after the ancient Roman emperor, Vyacheslav 
Afonichev's "Nero" sets the depraved leader on a plateau overlooking his 
burning city. With one eye ringed in red, the other a blank white dash rimmed 
in black, and his mouth a grotesque red lozenge framing a dense grid of teeth, 
the emperor looks crazed and demented. His arms are outstretched but seem to be 
propped up by thin black rods, and he stands, puppet-like, the balls of his 
feet just barely scraping the ground. 
</P>
<P>
A fury of destruction and despair rages below. Gaping mouths and desperate arms 
appeal to a fiery sky as buildings burn and ladders falter. Afonichev quotes 
from Picasso's monumental painting of the bombing of the Spanish village of 
Guernica to convey the pain of innocents at the hand of evil. Like Picasso, 
Afonichev refers to a specific historical incident but creates an image with 
timeless, terrifying power.

OPRAH SHOW WOWS SOME BUT NOT ALL

<TEXT>
<P>
No wonder Oprah Winfrey's people didn't want The Times to cover her appearance 
Sunday afternoon at the Celebrity Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
We'll spare you the gory details of the labyrinthine misadventure involved in 
just getting in to review the show. Let's just say there was much buck-passing 
and breaking of promises -- we're still waiting for the call from Oprah's 
publicist that was definitely coming Friday. 
</P>
<P>
And after being told that "no still photographers are allowed," it turned out 
that we were among the dozen or so people in the sold-out, 2,500-strong crowd 
without a camera. Flashbulbs popped throughout the presentation; afterwards, 
Oprah actually spent several minutes posing for the shutterbugs. 
</P>
<P>
No one likes what, charitably, might be called a bum steer, but it kinda makes 
sense that we practically had to sneak in, that the Powers That Be wanted to 
keep the press out. They probably knew this thing wouldn't stand up to critical 
scrutiny any more than her tabloid talk show does. 
</P>
<P>
But, heck, we wouldn't have missed it for anything. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's 100-minute extravaganza was not only deeply, deeply moving, but highly 
illuminating -- probably never more so than when Oprah confided: "The fact that 
I can wear Hanes panty hose every day has nothing to do with the kind of person 
I am." 
</P>
<P>
Probably a close second, though, was when she offered some 
spiritual-cum-aeronautical advice: "In order to fly, you've got to clean the 
garbage out of your wings." Uh, right. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Oprah was the only one who shared some very special thoughts. Indeed, 
in the 45-minute audience-participation segment, numerous fans lined up at 
microphones to toss out compliments, relate weight-loss success stories and ask 
meaningful questions. This yielded some award-winning moments. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
* Our Groucho Marx Non Sequitur Award, to the woman who said to Oprah, "Thank 
you for enriching my soul daily. And tell me about the dog and animals in your 
life." 
</P>
<P>
* The Miss Congeniality Award to the lean blonde, who demonstrated supreme 
sensitivity, following all of Oprah's comments about her ongoing struggle with 
weight loss, by saying "I want to show you how good you can look." As she 
stepped toward the stage to give Oprah a better look at her svelte physique, 
the theater became so silent you could hear a pound drop. This was quickly 
interrupted with catcalls and shouts of "Throw her out!" 
</P>
<P>
* The Sing Oprah's Praises Award was won, hands down, by the dark-haired woman 
who allowed that Oprah had been a significant influence and inspiration, then 
began singing "You . . . are . . . so . . . beautiful . . . to . . . me . . ." 
</P>
<P>
This was hardly the first time that Sunday's "show" felt like a "Saturday Night 
Live" sketch gone haywire. Much earlier in the afternoon, the rather amorphous 
presentation had crossed into such surreal territory that a befuddled-looking 
woman -- apparently noticing our note-taking -- leaned over and asked, "Do you 
think this is still the warm-up, or is this the show?" 
</P>
<P>
A reasonable question, even though at that point Oprah had been on stage for 40 
minutes. Heading into the show, it was something of a mystery just what Oprah 
was going to do and that mystery wasn't cleared up right away. 
</P>
<P>
So what was going on? Well, it started out in fairly straightforward fashion. 
After being greeted by a thunderous ovation, she thanked the crowd, saying: 
"I'm really thrilled that you all are here, and you don't even know what you're 
here for." 
</P>
<P>
That's a textbook example of blind faith, but well-placed as it turns out -- at 
least monetarily -- because Oprah announced that "all of the money that will be 
raised here today will be used to do what I call 'empowering' people.' " She 
said that half will go to a new home for battered women and half will go to the 
Brotherhood Crusade, which, she explained, is an organization of men that go 
"into the community and confront drug dealers." 
</P>
<P>
From there, Oprah moved into details about her formative years ("I remember the 
first night I saw Diana Ross; I just wanted to be Diana Ross or somebody 
Supreme.") . . . 
</P>
<P>
. . .early broadcasting jobs, including a detailed account of her stint in 
Baltimore, where the news director had qualms about her hair and looks, sending 
her to New York to be "made over"; after she had a permanent, all her hair fell 
out ("You can learn a lot about yourself when you are bald and black and 
supposedly an anchorwoman") . . . 
</P>
<P>
. . . horror stories about her younger days as a romantic wimp who, on the one 
hand, would never allow a man to strike her but on the other "would sit and 
wait by the phone for 17 hours" for a call from her boyfriend -- and was so 
desperate to prevent him from leaving her place after a visit that she would 
run outside and hold onto the bumper of his Lincoln Continental as he was 
trying to drive away. . . . 
</P>
<P>
But these first few anecdotes, and the ones that followed, were ultimately in 
service of her key theme: "I'm here today, really, to talk to you all about 
grace," she said. "What I believe is that the law of grace is always working in 
the universe -- and I will call it grace today, so as not to try to preach 
religion to you. But power of God, power of grace, power of the universe -- it 
really doesn't matter, because any power that is omnipotent doesn't get 
(ticked) off at what you call it." 
</P>
<P>
And so it went, Oprah espousing the virtue of "backing up, getting out of the 
way and letting the grace move in" in various ways, interspersed with more 
tales (including the one about being applauded by three women upon emerging 
from a bathroom stall at La Guardia airport), and a fistful of overwrought 
poetry recitations. The poems weren't hers. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, she was largely preaching to the converted -- and making a big, 
audible impact. Those who weren't members of her congregation might have been 
nonplussed by some of the evangelical fervor and odd occurrences. 
</P>
<P>
But there's no denying that Oprah is an enormously charismatic, very sharp 
cookie who comes off as relatively down-to-earth -- or tries to, anyway -- and 
is, clearly, immensely inspiring to many women. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the magic of her appeal doesn't speak to us all personally, it is 
tangible, it is recognizable. For instance, it's not hard to see why this show 
was sold-out for weeks, or why there's been frenzied demand for tickets to the 
Los Angeles taping this week of Oprah's ABC talk show. 
</P>
<P>
As one young woman -- who initially was scolding Oprah because she was unable 
to secure any tickets to the taping -- put it: "You're the best -- you're more 
popular than the Rolling Stones!"

Elizabeth McGovern came to Southern California and landed on a rocky beach in 
Scotland. "I really feel that's where I've gone," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based screen actress, sitting alone in an empty theater here, was 
describing her four weeks of intense rehearsals at South Coast Repertory for 
the central role in Sharman MacDonald's "When I Was a Girl, I Used to Scream 
and Shout . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The Scottish play about a difficult mother-daughter relationship, co-starring 
veteran Broadway actress Dana Ivey, begins previews tonight and opens Friday on 
the SCR Second Stage in its American premiere. Simon Stokes, who staged the 
original 1984 production in London, is directing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the story of my character's passage from sexual innocence to sexual 
experience," McGovern said in a recent interview. "That is a journey which I 
think always causes conflict -- particularly between mothers and daughters. I 
don't think there's any woman alive who hasn't known of that." 
</P>
<P>
In this instance, the mother has a conventional attitude toward sex that is 
typical of her provincial Calvinist background. The daughter happens to have 
been a precocious sexual rebel, which naturally exacerbates the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
According to the original script, the play unfolds in 1983 on the east coast of 
Scotland, where Morag and her daughter, Fiona, who is 32, return to their 
hometown for a conciliatory weekend together. But much of the action occurs in 
flashback, taking McGovern as far back as 1955 to scenes of Fiona's childhood 
and up through the 1960s during her teen-age years. 
</P>
<P>
For all the apparent distance separating McGovern's own experience growing up 
in the San Fernando Valley and that of a young woman reared in a Scottish 
seaside town, the 29-year-old actress maintained that the role of Fiona 
reverberates with profoundly familiar sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
"It reminds me of a lot of the things that were resonating within me," McGovern 
said. "I guess it has to do with my being a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant -- a 
WASP, if you will -- which is a heritage that I have in my blood and bones. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Sharman MacDonald really touches on all the voices in a woman's head. 
I recognize them from my own background. These voices are all about the kind of 
guilt women experience about sexual pleasure and having sexual desires. 
Actually, the play is not about sexuality per se, but about these voices." 
</P>
<P>
McGovern looked -- in her pink sweat shirt and faded jeans with ragged knee 
patches -- like nothing so much as an earnest, no-frills girl-next-door. Her 
serious blue eyes sometimes sparkled with sudden mischief, and the sensuous 
shape of her mouth dissolved into a sunny smile hinting at less provocative 
secrets than guilty pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, McGovern's ability to personify a virtual chorus of divergent voices 
has been one of the hallmarks of her career. Her roles in nearly a dozen 
movies, and perhaps as many plays over the past decade, have ranged across a 
wide spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Redford cast her in "Ordinary People," her 1980 movie debut, as Timothy 
Hutton's sensible girlfriend, a model of suburban grace. The next year she 
starred in Milos Forman's "Ragtime" as a kooky former chorine whose good-time 
antics -- nude and otherwise -- scandalized polite society. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, McGovern has played everything from Dudley Moore's psychiatric 
patient in "Lovesick" and Robert DeNiro's brutally raped dream girl in "Once 
Upon a Time in America" to Sean Penn's outsider match in "Racing With the Moon" 
and Kevin Bacon's nagging housewife in "She's Having a Baby." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, she can be seen as Mickey Rourke's blue-collar beauty in "Johnny 
Handsome." And her percolating screen career also includes two forthcoming 
pictures, "A Shock to the System" with Michael Caine and "The Handmaid's Tale" 
with Natasha Richardson, Robert Duvall and Faye Dunaway. 
</P>
<P>
Given so much Hollywood success, why has McGovern shifted her attention to a 
little-known play for a four-week run at SCR's 161-seat Second Stage? 
</P>
<P>
"Because it gives me such joy," she replied. "I can't think of any other 
answer. It's really the most accurate one. Maybe that's a selfish reason. But 
it's so satisfying, and it's such a challenge in a different way from movies." 
</P>
<P>
McGovern noted, moreover, that she often mixes stage roles with screen roles -- 
to the occasional discomfort of her agent. Last year at this time she did Jean 
Anouilh's "Ring Round the Moon" at the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., and, 
several months before that, a Brazilian-style version of Shakespeare's "A 
Midsummer Night's Dream" at the Public Theater in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a question of being dissatisfied with movies," she said. "I am 
basically attracted by the material, the other actors and the director. Whether 
a project is going to be a movie or a play is immaterial to me." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, "When I Was a Girl . . . " appears likely to have another life on 
the East Coast. If the production proves successful at SCR, according to 
Stokes, a group of New York investors led by Richard Frankel intend to import 
it to an off-Broadway theater in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
McGovern's name value "doesn't hurt from the New York point of view," Stokes 
acknowledged. But he said he cast her strictly on merit after several sources 
had recommended her. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen any of her movies, I am ashamed to say," the British director 
remarked. "I met her and liked her. She is right for the part. . . . One needs 
an innocence -- which she has -- to give the play its accuracy." 
</P>
<P>
McGovern, who was born in Evanston, Ill., said she comes from an academic 
rather than a theatrical family. She moved to Encino at age 10, when her 
father, who had taught at Northwestern University Law School, took a job at 
UCLA. Her mother also is a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Although McGovern said she didn't go to plays or movies "any more than other 
kids," she remembered being inspired to become an actress at age 15 by a 
performance Julie Harris gave in a touring production of "The Belle of 
Amherst." 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget that," she said. "There was just something about her -- her 
goodness and charity and her spirit -- that was seminal for me." 
</P>
<P>
"When I Was a Girl, I Used to Scream and Shout . . . " begins previews tonight 
and opens Friday on the Second Stage at South Coast Repertory. Through Dec. 10. 
Curtain times Tuesdays to Saturdays are at 8:30 p.m.; Sundays at 8 p.m.; 
matinees on Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets $14-$16 (previews); $20-$27 
(beginning Friday). Information: (714) 957-4033.

ST. JOSEPH BALLET SCHOOL MOVES TO MARKETPLACE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After five years of slogging it out in the basement of a church, Beth Burns and 
the St. Joseph Ballet school and company moved into a new, grander location in 
Santa Ana's Fiesta Marketplace on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The move came courtesy of five partners in the downtown Marketplace, who are 
providing the 4,000-square-foot facility rent-free for five years. 
</P>
<P>
Additional help came from a $60,000 grant from the city of Santa Ana and 
donations from private individuals that paid for the architectural design, an 
oak floor, floor-to-ceiling mirrors and dressing rooms. 
</P>
<P>
A gift of $55,000 to complete the facility was donated by the New York-based 
Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation. The studio has been named the 
Guggenheim Dance Studio in honor of the grant. 
</P>
<P>
Artistic director Beth Burns founded the troupe in 1984 to offer ballet 
training and dance opportunities to disadvantaged, inner-city youths ages 9 to 
19. She estimates that she has trained more than 800 young people in ballet and 
dance and reached an additional 7,000 through dance programs given in local 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
The company was founded under the auspices of the Sisters of St. Joseph of 
Orange, which Burns joined in 1978. She left the order this summer, she said, 
to "continue (my) spiritual development in other paths." The company, which she 
will continue to head, was incorporated as a separate entity in January. 
</P>
<P>
For five years, classes and dance events had been held in the basement of the 
Episcopal Church of the Messiah in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless they had given us that space free . . . we wouldn't be anything," Burns 
said. "(But) it was small, less than 1,000 square feet, and our classes 
sometime have more than 40 children. . . . We were really overcrowded. This is 
an enormous improvement." 
</P>
<P>
Burns said she plans to increase enrollment and number of classes by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
The budget picture also looks good, with the company only $35,000 short of 
meeting a 2-for-1 challenge grant of $150,000 pledged by two Orange County 
couples. The deadline for meeting that grant is Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"When people see the children perform," Burns said, "it's a real testimony to 
the transformative powers of any classical means of expression. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very exciting and rewarding to see how dance is changing these children's 
lives. . . . We need these children. I don't think doing this is just one way, 
but a two-way street. Volunteers and donors are renewed by what is happening to 
these children's lives."

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Minimum-Wage Increase 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 382 to 37, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 2710) 
increasing the minimum wage for the first time since 1981, raising it from 
$3.35 an hour to $3.80 next April and $4.25 in April 1991. About 4 million 
workers now receive the federal minimum. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the bill is a new sub-minimum wage for youths advocated by 
businesses but disliked by labor. The "training wage," set at $3.35 an hour 
next April and $3.61 a year later, can be paid for up to 90 days to youths 16 
to 19 who are new to the work force. The bill is a compromise between President 
Bush and Democratic leaders, drafted after the House failed last June to 
override Bush's veto of a $4.55-an-hour minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter James Traficant (D-Ohio) said the bill is needed because "it's a sad 
day in America when people work eight hours a day and still qualify for food 
stamps and housing vouchers." 
</P>
<P>
Objecting to the new two-tier wage structure that critics say will take jobs 
away from adults, Carl Perkins (D-Ky.) called the bill "a sellout to the 
President of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the bill.

Airline Takeovers 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 300 to 113, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 3443) enabling 
the Department of Transportation to prevent the sale of major airlines if the 
deal would result in foreign control of the carrier or enough of a debt load to 
jeopardize passenger safety. 
</P>
<P>
Parties seeking more than 15% of an airline's stock would have to get DOT's 
prior approval. 
</P>
<P>
Although foreign control of major carriers is now prohibited, federal officials 
say the bill is needed to plug loopholes in the existing ban. The safety issue 
is raised by fears that leveraged buyouts will leave newly purchased airlines 
with insufficient cash flow to maintain their fleets. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter J. J. Pickle (D-Tex.) said: "We cannot sit back while airlines, our 
national assets, take on billions of dollars in debt. The risks are too great." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) said the bill gives government too much 
power over the marketplace and "is more appropriate for the Soviet airline, 
Aeroflot, not the American airline industry." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted the Department of Transportation to be able to block 
certain airline buyouts.

Nicaragua and the Contras 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 262 to 152, the House endorsed the harsher of two possible 
criticisms of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega for resuming combat with 
American-backed Contras. This meant that a measure later passed by the House 
(HR 221) denounced Ortega's Sandinistas but not the Contras for violations of 
the Nicaraguan cease-fire. The vote swept aside a Foreign Affairs Committee 
measure that blamed both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Walker (R-Pa.) said the committee measure "is a little ambivalent about 
whether or not we are condemning the Sandinistas or ... the Contras." 
</P>
<P>
Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.) said the House should denounce both the Sandinistas and 
"the continuing atrocities . . . of the Contras." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported a resolution criticizing the Sandinistas but not 
the Contras in Nicaragua.

BO AND HIS RAIDERS ARE COMING TO TOWN

The Raiders are coming. The Raiders are coming. 
</P>
<P>
They have won four of five under new Coach Art Shell. And they will play the 
Chargers (3-6) Sunday at 5 p.m. in San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. ESPN-TV will 
televise the game nationally. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the reasons for the Raiders' improvement) are Bo Jackson and the fact 
that Howie Long is playing a great deal stronger than he was," said Charger 
Coach Dan Henning. "Both of those guys have ignited them." 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end Long was injured and not a factor in the first Charger game, a 
40-14 Raider victory in the season opener. Running back Jackson was still 
playing for the Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
As to what effect Shell may have had on the Raiders, now 5-4, Henning said: 
"They've probably got some new feeling about themselves. But I haven't seen Art 
throw any blocks yet. But they're playing better. And they played pretty well 
against us the first time." 
</P>
<P>
Henning praised his battered offensive line Monday for limiting the Eagles to 
two quarterback sacks in Sunday's 20-17 victory over Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"This has got to be a key for any continued progress toward getting big plays," 
Henning said. "They (the offensive line) did better." 
</P>
<P>
Henning's remarks were in stark contrast to the comments made by Steve Zucker, 
the agent for Charger quarterback Jim McMahon, in Monday's edition of The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think Jim's playing well, especially considering that line in front 
of him," Zucker said. "I mean look at it. You won't hear it from him, but how 
can you get anything done with that line?" 
</P>
<P>
Charger defensive coordinator Ron Lynn pays attention to a lot of different 
statistics. But he is especially proud of the fact that the Chargers haven't 
allowed more than 20 points in any of their last seven games. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a pretty good feel each week what we're going to get from our guys," 
he said. "You don't have to put guns to their heads." 
</P>
<P>
"The defense is doing the No. 1 thing it has to," said Henning, who often 
disparages statistics. "And that's keep points off the board." 
</P>
<P>
The Charger defense has allowed 14.2 points per game in the past seven weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said McMahon's health is better than it has been in weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's probably not as vulnerable now because he's gone two and a half 
weeks without a real focused type of malady," Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
The two major injuries out of the Philadelphia game were to defensive end Lee 
Williams and right tackle Brett Miller. Both suffered leg contusions. But 
Henning said both should be able to play against the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
The Charger coaching staff used remarks attributed to Philadelphia Coach Buddy 
Ryan as a motivational tool. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never want to get into a war of words with Buddy," Henning said. "But 
he had an interview somewhere along the line where he said our defense wasn't 
as good as their defense. Our defense took that as a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"He also said that even though they were having troubles on offense, theirs was 
still better than ours. Some of our people on offense took exception to that. 
And for that, we thank Buddy."

Abernathy rebuffed: The board of trustees at the Rev. Ralph Abernathy's alma 
mater, Alabama State University, has reversed a decision to name a new 
dormitory after the civil rights leader. Trustees said the action was taken 
because of allegations in Abernathy's recent autobiography, "And the Walls Came 
Tumbling Down," that Martin Luther King, Jr. had extramarital affairs with two 
women the night before he was assassinated in Memphis, Tenn., in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Setting the record straight: The daughter of Polish President Wojciech 
Jaruzelski is getting lots of media exposure but doesn't like all of it. Monika 
Jaruzelska, 25, declares the Sunday Times of London was off base in saying that 
she and her father argued over imposition of martial law in Poland in 1981. She 
also was less than thrilled with recent photos in the French weekly Paris-Match 
showing her at home with her father, in front of a fireplace, in a limo, in bed 
in a sleeveless undershirt, and wearing a gray fur coat.

YOUR BODY: TOOTHBRUSH SANITIZERS TO WARD OFF FLU? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rinsing a toothbrush with tap water is old-hat hygiene. Toothbrush sanitizers 
are the newest way to zap germs -- and perhaps reduce the frequency of colds 
and flu. 
</P>
<P>
In one sanitizing system called Brushgard, the toothbrush is inserted into a 
small plastic bottle containing hydrogen peroxide and water. "Viruses and 
bacteria cannot live in the solution," claims Jeff Hutner, spokesman for 
Brushgard Systems Inc. The whole system sells for $1.39, but the manufacturer 
recommends that customers replace it every 10 days. Having just introduced 
Brushgard in local health food stores, the Inglewood company expects to 
distribute it nationwide soon. 
</P>
<P>
Dentec 4000, a plug-in sanitizing system that "bathes your toothbrushes in 
ultraviolet germicidal light" sells for $59.95 at department and specialty 
stores around the country, says Joe Bello, Dentec spokesman. He claims the 
ultraviolet light killed germs in independent and Dentec laboratory studies. 
Since the light stays on for only two minutes per half hour, the bulb lasts up 
to five years. Each system holds four brushes. 
</P>
<P>
"Both systems have potential for reducing the number of germs on toothbrushes," 
believes Richard Glass, professor and chairman of oral pathology at the 
University of Oklahoma, who tested Brushgard and Dentec 4000. "The unanswered 
question is: Does either system decrease the organisms enough to have an impact 
on health?" 
</P>
<P>
But the American Dental Assn. isn't convinced the sanitizers are necessary 
because, according to a spokesman, "there's no substantial scientific evidence 
you can be reinfected with a cold by reusing your toothbrush." 
</P>
<P>
What's really needed, say some dental experts, is a more efficient toothbrush 
-- one with fewer nooks and crannies for germs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Soups Vary in Health Benefits, Say Experts 
</P>
<P>
As weather cools, weight-conscious consumers turn to soup to keep warm and 
trim. But all soups aren't created equal. If weight control is your primary 
aim, keep in mind these soup rules: 
</P>
<P>
If you buy canned soups, don't be fooled by names. "Cream of spinach soup isn't 
as healthy as it may sound," says Gretchen Newmark, a Santa Monica dietitian, 
since the cream base adds fat. 
</P>
<P>
If you still can't resist such soups, "make them with low-fat milk," suggests 
Linda Dahl, a dietitian at HCA Los Robles Regional Medical Center, Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
If you order soup in a restaurant, "vegetable or minestrone soups are often 
good bets to avoid excess fat," advises Newmark. 
</P>
<P>
If you have high blood pressure, opt for low-salt or reduced-salt canned soups, 
Dahl suggests. "Or at least mix a can of reduced-salt or salt-free soup with a 
can of salted soup."

ERMA BOMBECK: PRESSURED FOR AIR TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK, Erma Bombeck is on a two-week vacation. This Best of Bombeck 
release originally appeared Feb. 6, 1986. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You'll pardon me if I don't have a clever beginning to this column. I don't 
have time. 
</P>
<P>
There are 24 hours in every day. I used to watch television six hours and 44 
minutes a day, leaving me with 17 hours and 16 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
After I scheduled seven hours and five minutes to sleep and two hours and 15 
minutes to eat, I was left with only seven hours and 56 minutes to write. 
</P>
<P>
Then we got cable television, and what with the news channel, first-run movies, 
MTV, country-Western, spiritual, entertainment and sports, my viewing cut into 
my workday. Then my husband said, "While you're watching that channel, you're 
missing a good show on the other channel," so we bought a VCR so we could tape 
one show and watch another. 
</P>
<P>
But when do you watch the shows you've taped? So I took time away from my two 
hours and 15 minutes eating time and ate in front of the TV set. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, we began to buy cassettes to fit the VCR. I bought Jane Fonda so I 
could get my body in shape. However, I had to take time away from my seven 
hours and five minutes of sleeping time. 
</P>
<P>
On my birthday, a son rented two movies as a present. I panicked. They had to 
be viewed by10 a.m. the next morning. Already I had a stack of taped shows that 
I hadn't had time to view. I put the movies ahead of the tapes, rescheduled 
Jane Fonda for 4 a.m., and watched "Terms of Endearment" and "Easy Money" at 5 
and 7 a.m. It was close, but I made it. 
</P>
<P>
As the weeks go on, I feel the pressure more and more. With the VCR taping 
shows day and night, with my husband running from room to room, 
channel-searching to see what we're missing, with the new cassettes on 
everything from how to repair your plumbing to how to be more assertive, the 
new films and video music, we're falling behind. 
</P>
<P>
We're beginning to cut corners. We've got "60 Minutes" down to 30, "20/20" down 
to 10/10, and anything on World War II we fast-forward because we know the 
ending.

ART BUCHWALD: KNOCKING THE BIG APPLE WITH NARY AN APOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART BUCHWALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Brokaw had to apologize to New York City for knocking the town during a 
news broadcast. I am going to talk about New York today, but I have no 
intention of following his example. The reason for this is that New Yorkers 
never offer me an apology, so why should I apologize to them? 
</P>
<P>
Here are some random notes about the Big Apple that I jotted down on my last 
trip: 
</P>
<P>
The first thing a visitor notices is that all the people on the street are 
talking to themselves. The assumption is that they are mentally disturbed. This 
is not the case. The people talking to themselves are the sane ones -- it's the 
New Yorkers who talk to each other who are crazy. 
</P>
<P>
New York City has won the Nobel Prize for potholes. What makes the potholes so 
special is that they are not only in the streets but also on the sidewalks. In 
New York a person has twice as many chances of breaking an ankle when walking 
than when riding a bus. 
</P>
<P>
It is not generally known, but each New Yorker averages eight fights a day with 
total strangers. The fights are mostly verbal and only in rare cases do they 
become physical. When he returns home at night the family is waiting to find 
out how many he won. This is how it goes: 
</P>
<P>
"So, Dad, how did you do with the fights today?" 
</P>
<P>
"I won five and lost three." 
</P>
<P>
"Not bad for an old man." 
</P>
<P>
"Who are you calling an old man? Show me another New Yorker over 50 who can 
still win 'The Big One' in the subway." 
</P>
<P>
"Who did you beat, Dad?" 
</P>
<P>
"I went up against a cabdriver who drove right through a puddle and splashed 
water all over my pants." 
</P>
<P>
"Did you give him a piece of your mind?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, he sped off. Another cab came along and had to stop for a red light, so I 
yelled at him instead. You should have seen the look on his face." 
</P>
<P>
"Bully for you, Dad." 
</P>
<P>
"Later on I was waiting to make a telephone call at a public phone box on 
Broadway. I stood for 10 minutes while some guy made obscene telephone calls to 
his ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
"He hung up, and I was about to take the receiver when this little old lady 
pushed me aside and grabbed the phone. Being a New Yorker, I said, as polite as 
can be, 'I think I was waiting longer, Shorty.' Do you know what she did? She 
gave me the finger." 
</P>
<P>
"A little old lady did that to you at a public phone booth?" 
</P>
<P>
"They'll do it anywhere they can. So, I lost that one. Next, I went into a big 
department store to buy a pair of socks. The guy at the sock counter was 
nibbling on the neck of the girl selling cologne. 'Please,' I said, 'all I want 
are some socks.' The girl sprayed cologne into the salesman's ear. I got 
impatient and shouted, 'I want socks.' The guy didn't move, but the store 
detective came over, shoved his chest against mine and said, 'Can't you see the 
man is on his lunch hour?' " 
</P>
<P>
"Fifteen years ago you would have won that one, Pop. Salespeople can smell when 
a customer is over the hill and doesn't have any fight left in him any more." 
</P>
<P>
"My greatest victory came after I saw a mugging this afternoon, 10 feet away 
from me." 
</P>
<P>
"Why was it such a triumph?" 
</P>
<P>
"The mugger got away so no one asked me to be a witness."

MYSTERY OVER HORSE AILMENT GROWS; FOOD SUPPLY EXAMINED

<TEXT>
<P>
There are more reports surfacing today of a baffling illness that has killed at 
least 11 horses and badly shaken horse owners and trainers throughout Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Seven horses in Orange County have died and several others have shown symptoms 
of the twitching muscles, rapid breathing and difficulty chewing or swallowing 
that characterize the disease. (Story, A1.) 
</P>
<P>
The mysterious ailment has been reported in several cities in Los Angeles, 
Ventura and San Bernardino counties since surfacing at the Orange County 
Fairgrounds Equestrian Center 10 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We are beginning to get all kinds of reports from other cities going as far 
back as September," Orange County Fairgrounds spokeswoman Jill Lloyd said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
State officials and a team of veterinarians investigating the malady have not 
determined a cause but are looking at the food supply, which apparently is the 
only common link among the stricken equines, Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have scheduled a news conference this afternoon at the Orange County 
Fairgrounds to provide details on the investigation.

BIG ROCK HOMEOWNERS FACING DRAINAGE FEE OF $100,000 EACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously today to assess homeowners in 
Malibu's Big Rock Mesa area more than $100,000 each for a drainage system to 
stabilize their landslide-plagued community. 
</P>
<P>
"The $500 (monthly assessment over 20 years) is going to put some people out of 
their homes," John Murdock, an attorney for the homeowners, told the 
supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners contend that the proposed $13.8-million drainage system is too 
expensive for them to bear alone and does not guarantee against another 
disaster on the order of a 1983 slide that damaged or destroyed 250 homes. 
</P>
<P>
The slide led to 4 1/2 years of litigation, which ended in January when the 
county, California Department of Transportation, dozens of insurance companies 
and attorneys for about 240 Big Rock homeowners reached a settlement that will 
pay the homeowners $97 million -- or about $200,000 each after legal fees -- 
for the damage. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the residents, as well as some who were not part of the lawsuit and 
others who bought homes in the area after the litigation began, were stunned by 
the county's plans to triple their property taxes to help pay for stabilizing 
the slide-prone area.

NIGHT STALKER GETS DEATH;

YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, KILLER SAYS

<P>
Richard Ramirez, the "Night Stalker" who butchered or raped more than a dozen 
people in an outburst of violence that terrorized Southern California in 1985, 
was sentenced to death in the gas chamber today. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Michael A. Tynan pronounced the sentence shortly after 11 
a.m. It carries an automatic appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Before he was sentenced, the 29-year-old Texas killer, wearing dark glasses, 
uttered a rambling, nearly inaudible statement in court that ended with the 
words: "Lucifer dwells within us all." 
</P>
<P>
"You don't understand . . . and you are not expected to, you are not capable of 
it," he was heard to say. "I am beyond your experience. I am beyond doing evil. 
Legions of the night, night breed. Repeat not the errors of the Night Stalker 
and show no mercy. I will be avenged." 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, clad in jailhouse blues and wearing dark sunglasses, rocked back and 
forth and turned to grin at the audience throughout the hourlong sentencing 
hearing, during which several relatives of victims addressed the court. 
</P>
<P>
One of those was Colleen Nelson, the granddaughter of murder victim Joyce 
Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
"For every person he killed, he has put so many others in so much pain," Nelson 
said. "He has forfeited his right to live for what he did to my grandmother and 
all those other innocent people." 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez, who entered unlocked houses late at night to murder people in their

sodomy.

He often left satanic symbols scrawled at the scenes of his crimes and in at 
least one instance, gouged out the eyes of a victim. During his preliminary 
hearing, he appeared in court one day with a pentagram drawn on the palm of his 
hand and flashed it to reporters as he said: "Hail, Satan!" 
</P>
<P>
A dozen people survived the attacks, and some testified at the 16-month trial. 
</P>
<P>
The same jury recommended Oct. 4 that he be sentenced to death. Jurors, some of 
whom said they felt that the defendant tried to intimidate them during the 
trial by sneering and glaring at them, returned death penalty recommendations 
on each of 19 special circumstance counts. 
</P>
<P>
A snarling, gravelly voiced Ramirez had earlier sneered at the possibility of 
being sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
"Big deal, death comes with the territory," he told reporters after last 
month's sentencing recommendation. "See you in Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
After his September conviction, Ramirez flashed a two-fingered "devil sign" at 
photographers and muttered one word: "Evil."

"A guy's got to make a living," President Bush said today of his predecessor's 
$2-million trip to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Bush at his news conference was asked about former President Ronald Reagan's 
recent trip and remarked, "I will not have anything negative to say about 
President Reagan." He said there were positive aspects of the trip, including 
the symbolizing of friendship and the overcoming of trade difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
He sidestepped a question about Nancy Reagan's implied criticism of him. In her 
memoirs, the former First Lady said that she had asked Bush, then vice 
president, to tell her husband that it was time to dump Donald T. Regan as 
White House chief of staff and Bush that replied that it was not his role. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't help you on that," Bush told his questioner. "I don't want to get into 
that."

Turnout was heavy today as L. Douglas Wilder's bid to become the nation's first 
elected black governor went to the voters after a race in which abortion and 
negative campaigning emerged as major issues. 
</P>
<P>
"We're on roller skates," said Alice Lynch, registrar in Richmond, describing 
the activity in her office. "I think it's going to be a record in Richmond 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Wilder, the state's Democratic lieutenant governor, and J. Marshall Coleman, 
the Republican candidate, flew across the state Monday to warn supporters 
against complacency and too much reliance on polls showing Wilder ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"We're absolutely on the eve of a great victory," Coleman told about two dozen 
volunteers at Richmond's airport.

SLIDE CLOSES PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY; 2 DRIVERS INJURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A landslide swept a sheet of tumbling earth and rocks down from a cliff in the 
Pacific Palisades area onto Pacific Coast Highway this morning, injuring at 
least two drivers unable to escape in time and damaging several cars. 
</P>
<P>
The drivers -- a man and a woman -- were taken to Santa Monica Hospital, said 
Ted Braun, a spokesman for the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Braun said the injuries did not appear to be serious. "They are not 
life-threatening injuries," said Braun, who was unable to give the identities 
of the drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Doug Myers, of the West LAPD traffic division, said of the two injured 
drivers: "Basically what they got was an exciting E Ticket ride" down Pacific 
Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Added Judy Lester, a New Jersey resident who was a passenger in a third car, 
which filled with mud: "It was like being in a bumper car at the pier. . . . 
All of a sudden it became dark, and mud started coming in the back window." 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear if there was any serious damage to homes in the 
area. A large piece of concrete, which appeared to be part of a patio from a 
home above the slide area, seemed to be threatened by the earth movement, LAPD 
spokesman Roger Mora said. 
</P>
<P>
A Caltrans spokeswoman, Terrygay Jackson, said the agency is not doing any 
roadwork in the area and is uncertain what might have caused the slide. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Robert Schroeder, a county lifeguard stationed near the slide area, said at 
least two cars overturned as the dirt and rocks spilled over a section of the 
15000 block of the highway shortly after 11 a.m. The two victims were removed 
from those cars. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said that in addition to the two drivers injured at the scene, three 
others were being assisted by lifeguards. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently that strip of highway is (now) just a bunch of dirt," Mora said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, of Caltrans, said agency workers have already begun to try to clear 
dirt from the highway. 
</P>
<P>
While the cleanup continued, police blocked off both sides of the highway to 
oncoming traffic. "We have closed PCH between Temescal (Canyon Road) and West 
Channel Road," Mora said. 
</P>

Times staff writers Steven Braun, Darrell Dawsey and Clay Evans contributed to 
this story.

The general synod of the Church of England voted overwhelmingly today in favor 
of allowing women to become priests. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial question of whether women should be ordained will now be 
considered by diocesan synods, and the change ultimately must be approved by 
both houses of Parliament and by the queen. 
</P>
<P>
Archbishop of Canterbury Robert A. K. Runcie said before the measure was 
approved, "I remain of the conviction that the ordination of women to the 
priesthood ought to be construed as an enlargement and extension of the 
historic Christian ministry." 
</P>
<P>
The vote in favor of women priests in the three-tiered general synod, or church 
Parliament, was 34 to 17 among bishops, 149 to 85 among clergy and 144 to 78 
among laity, with three abstentions. 
</P>
<P>
Women favoring ordination maintained a 24-hour vigil ending Monday night 
outside the church leader's home at London's Lambeth Palace.

Bundled in a black wool coat and a blue fur cap on a damp Moscow morning, she 
watched the annual parade celebrating the Nov. 7 anniversary of the Bolshevik 
Revolution from a stand for special guests at Red Square. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether she planned to travel with Gorbachev for the Dec. 2-3 summit, the 
first lady responded: "If my husband takes me." 
</P>
<P>
She politely declined repeated requests for her assessment of the massive 
economic problems facing her husband.

"It's a holiday," she said. "Let's just relax."

A block of "penny black" postage stamps, issued in 1840, were sold at auction 
today for about $442,680, an auction house said. 
</P>
<P>
The 36 stamps, depicting the young Queen Victoria and originally selling for 
one pence each, were bought by the Royale Stamp Co. for a private collector who 
was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
When the set last changed hands in 1934, it sold for about $2,400, said Ray 
Haffner of the Harmers auction house. 
</P>
<P>
The "penny black" and the "two-penny blue" were the first British postage 
stamps.

Massachusetts First Lady Kitty Dukakis was hospitalized late Monday night and 
placed in intensive care after feeling lethargic and ill, but a spokeswoman 
said today there was no indication that drugs or alcohol abuse were involved. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Dukakis, 52, who has admitted to a 27-year addiction to diet pills and a 
problem with alcohol, was resting comfortably with her husband, Gov. Michael 
Dukakis, at her bedside after undergoing a battery of tests at Brigham and 
Woman's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Dukakis was admitted because she wasn't feeling well," the governor's 
press spokeswoman, Mindy Lubbers, told reporters outside the hospital. "She was 
feeling lethargic. She's been down with the flu for four or five days, and as 
of now the tests that have been done that we have heard results from have 
proven nothing." 
</P>
<P>
The illness occurred on the eve of the first anniversary of her husband's 
defeat in last year's presidential election. Mrs. Dukakis has cited the defeat 
for sparking bouts of depression and exacerbating her alcohol problem. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Mrs. Dukakis had succumbed to drug or alcohol abuse, Lubbers said 
there was "no indication of that. None whatsoever."

MARKET WOES FORCE 2% LAYOFF AT SHEARSON

Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., suffering from a continuing slowdown in the 
financial markets, today began another round of layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
A company source said the layoffs could result in as much as 2% of Shearson's 
work force, or 800 people, being cut in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The layoffs, which are expected to affect all departments in the securities 
firm, would be the largest on Wall Street this year. 
</P>
<P>
Shearson notified its 38,500 employees of its decision Monday in a 
two-paragraph internal newsletter, company spokesman Steven Faigen said. He 
declined to provide details on the layoffs, saying only that "several hundred" 
employees will lose their jobs in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Shearson and other securities firms are expected to show a decline in trading 
profits this year as a result of the stock market's plunge of last month and 
the general pressure on takeover stocks. 
</P>
<P>
The wariness of individual investors since the October, 1987, stock market 
crash continues to hurt the securities industry. Securities firms in New York 
City alone have cut nearly 18,000 jobs from a peak of 163,000 two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Shearson laid off about 1,200 employees, and since then it has 
trimmed another 300 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Shearson, a subsidiary of financial services giant American Express Co., is the 
second-largest securities firm in the nation, behind Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
For the first three quarters of this year, Shearson earned $106 million, or 98 
cents a share, down 3 percent from earnings of $110 million, or $1.05 a share, 
last year. Revenue rose to $9.6 billion from $7.6 billion, but expenses also 
climbed, to $9.4 billion from $7.5 billion.

FED SPURS HOPE; DOW RALLIES FOR 14.96 GAIN

Stock prices rallied from a weak opening amid renewed investor optimism that 
the Federal Reserve might move to lower interest rates. Wall Street analysts 
said the Fed's addition of reserves to the banking system through customer 
repurchase agreements sparked an increase in the bond market that helped boost 
stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 14.96 points to 2,597.13. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 9 to 7 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 811 issues up, 633 down and 506 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 163.00 million shares, against 135.48 million in 
Monday's session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 0.97 to 185.74. 
</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index ended at 368.51, down 
0.17. 
</P>
<P>
Investors interpreted the Fed activity as an indication that the next move 
might involve a cut in the discount rate, the rate the central bank charges its 
member banks, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
The yield on long-term Treasury bonds fell sharply after the Fed's move. The 
federal funds rate, the interest commercial banks charge each other for 
overnight loans, also declined. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices opened weak then waffled through the morning session. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that the Fed might be doing a little easing, and that's why the 
market has rallied," said Ralph Bloch, chief market analyst with the investment 
firm Raymond, James &amp; Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 47.34 points on what analysts 
said was a response to unexpectedly weak third-quarter earnings reports. The 
bleak outlook for fourth-quarter corporate profits and interest rates worries 
had also helped depress prices, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week's better-than-expected unemployment report rekindled worries that the 
Fed would not ease credit soon. Investors hope for a decline in short-term 
interest rates to revive corporate profitability, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts also attributed the day's gains to bargain hunting and technical 
factors after Monday's steep declines. 
</P>
<P>
"We were oversold after yesterday," said said L. Crandall Hays, analyst with 
Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were slightly higher in early trading today. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond gained 3/16 point, or $1.87 for 
every $1,000 in face value, by around midday. Its yield, which falls when 
prices rise, edged down to 7.94% from 7.95% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices got a "little kick" today from talk in the market that Japanese 
investors plan to be active buyers of government securities in future U.S. 
Treasury auctions, said Mitchell Held, chief financial economist at Smith 
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term 
government issues rose 1/16 point to 1/8 point, intermediate maturities 
increased 1/8 point to 5/32 point and long-term issues were up 1/16 point to 
7/32 point.

ABC canceled Jackie Mason's sitcom "Chicken Soup" today and announced that next 
season Oprah Winfrey will produce and star in a series based on her "Brewster 
Place" miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
"Chicken Soup," which will be replaced with last season's "Coach," spotlighted 
Mason's ethnic humor and proposed the unlikely romantic coupling of short, 
Jewish Mason and tall, British Lynn Redgrave. It was scheduled for its final 
airing tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The show is the third dropout of the season's new shows. CBS previously 
canceled "The People Next Door" and NBC dropped "Nutt House." 
</P>
<P>
"Chicken Soup" had one of the best sitcom slots on television, following the 
highly popular "Roseanne," but was not able to hang onto the "Roseanne" 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
The show was also marred by Mason's association with the New York mayoral 
campaign of former federal prosecutor Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
Mason, one-time honorary chairman of the Giuliani campaign, resigned in 
September over remarks he made about the GOP candidate's Democratic rival, 
David Dinkins, who is black. Among other things, the rabbi-turned-comedian said 
Jews would vote for Dinkins out of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
Mason apologized for his remarks, which were reported by the Village Voice. 
</P>
<P>
The comedian said he had learned that "what's funny on stage can be insensitive 
when it's said off the stage and in the world of politics. And for my 
insensitivity, I apologize." 
</P>
<P>
Janice Gretemeyer, an ABC spokeswoman, said the network "has no comment on the 
reasons for the cancellation." 
</P>
<P>
"Coach," a sitcom starring Craig T. Nelson as a college football coach whose 
daughter attends the school where he works, ran as a limited series last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
ABC also announced today that Winfrey will produce and star in a new half-hour 
dramatic series, "Brewster Place," based on the highly successful miniseries 
"Women of Brewster Place" that ran on ABC last season. It will make its 
premiere in the spring of 1990.

Paramount Pictures is launching a worldwide casting search to find a young 
actor-singer or opera singer to play the son of the powerful Don Michael 
Corleone in director Francis Ford Copolla's upcoming third edition of "The 
Godfather." 
</P>
<P>
The film maker is looking for an Italo-American tenor in his mid-20s who could 
play the son of Michael Corleone, who was portrayed by Al Pacino. The pivotal 
role will feature the successful tenor singing two arias from the classic 
Sicilian opera "Cavalleria Rusticana" in the scenes to be filmed on location in 
Palermo, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The third act of "The Godfather" begins in New York City in 1979 and continues 
the story of the Corleone family, first chronicled by Mario Puzo in his 
best-selling novel "The Godfather." 
</P>
<P>
Casting directors have already seen more than 200 candidates, but the role is 
still considered to be open.

MIKE SCOTT FLASHES SIGNS OF GREATNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Waterboys' Mike Scott demonstrated Monday night at the Wiltern Theatre that 
he is a wary but immensely worthy rock hero. 
</P>
<P>
In his first local appearance in four years, the Scottish-born 
singer-songwriter came armed with inspiring songs and uplifting musicianship, 
but early in the show, he and the other six members of his band 
self-defeatingly broke the momentum. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Scott showed in the end that he has the conviction, purpose and talent to 
put him near the forefront of contemporary rockers. The most significant aspect 
of the concert was that Scott seems comfortable in that role. It wasn't always 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
When Scott burst on the scene in England in 1983, he seemed too eager to be 
accepted as the latest in the rock-as-inspiration tradition of Bob Dylan and 
Van Morrison. By the time of the third Waterboys album, 1985's "This Is the 
Sea," Scott had moved toward warmer and more convincing expressions of 
spiritually accented idealism and hope, and he stood on the brink of U2-like 
adoration in England. 
</P>
<P>
But Scott backed away for some soul-searching, eventually moving from London to 
Ireland, where he put together a new band that enabled him to work with the 
bright, flavorful Irish folk trimmings. The result was 1988's much-admired 
"Fisherman's Blues" album, which had a far more personal tone that better 
served his reflections on the search for social and spiritual fulfillment. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's show at the Wiltern -- where Scott will appear again tonight and 
Wednesday, before a concert Thursday at UC San Diego -- was an extension of 
that breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
"We're livin' in a strange time / Workin' for a strange goal / We're turnin' 
flesh and body / into soul," he sang in the evening's second number, "Strange 
Boat," virtually defining his musical destination. But at times the Celtic 
coloring (provided by such instruments as accordion, mandolin and fiddle) 
neutralized the emotions of the songs, and the use of traditional numbers broke 
the momentum of the Waterboys' own punchy songs. 
</P>
<P>
At about the half-way mark, however, Scott picked up an electric guitar and 
went into a series of explosive rockers that had the audience on its feet, 
fully engrossed. By this time, the mixture of folk warmth and rock bite was so 
unified that it seemed only natural when Scott brought out the nearly two dozen 
members of the Scottish Fiddlers of Los Angeles for a jam that offered the 
warm, communal feel that is such a winning feature of Los Lobos concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Scott needs a few more songs of the level of the "Fisherman's Blues" material 
before he can be reasonably ranked with the models he so much admires, but he 
flashed signs of greatness on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A complete review of the Waterboys' concert will appear in Wednesday's Calendar 
section.

LIZ SMITH: HOT PRODUCER READY TO MAKE A BANG AS ACTOR

<P>
HOLLYWOOD'S HOT -- but really hot -- producer, Don Simpson, is making his 
acting debut in James Toback's coming controversial movie, "The Big Bang." This 
one received an ovation at the recent Telluride Film Festival and is all about 
real people baring their souls on the subjects of life, death, sex, and the 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson has grown rich and famous as a producer. He and partner Jerry 
Bruckheimer did "Flashdance," "Beverly Hills Cop," and "Top Gun." But Don 
recently lost about 40 pounds and became a health and fitness nut. 
</P>
<P>
So now he'll also play the role of the racing driver Aldo Benadetti in the 
coming Tom Cruise film, "Days of Thunder." Filming begins Nov. 17 in North 
Carolina, Florida and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
MALCOLM FORBES, Marella Agnelli and Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat laid on 
cocktails in the Forbes gallery in New York for their coming "Masquerade" gala 
happening Dec. 1 to honor AmFAR's Elizabeth Taylor. I had two dates for this 
one -- Hollywood's rising personal manager Keith Addis and his brand new 
partner, Nick Wechsler, who co-produced and produced "sex, lies and videotape," 
as well as "Drugstore Cowboy." These guys have formed a management-production 
company that will be an L.A. organization of note. (Addis manages Sting, Jeff 
Goldblum, Mimi Rogers, Steve Guttenberg and people like that.) 
</P>
<P>
HERE's the real reason why David Rockefeller sold the famous Rockefeller Center 
to the sons-of-Mitsubishis. There are more than 100 accredited heirs to the 
sprawling Rockefeller fortune. Once upon a time, theirs was a name to conjure 
with all over the United States and they were the "masters of the universe" of 
their day. Today, the Rockefellers are considered "pikers" when it comes to 
wealth and are only middling rich by Nouvelle Society standards. 
</P>
<P>
Those in charge felt the tax situation would be onerous upon the deaths of 
Laurence and David Rockefeller. They felt that the other heirs need money NOW 
to protect their futures. 
</P>
<P>
Did the Rockefellers sell cheap? Some insiders think so. These smarties 
estimate that the real value of Rockefeller Center is around $4 billion. The 
Rockefellers sold to the Japanese for only $846 million. 
</P>
<P>
FINALLY CAUGHT up with Faye Dunaway on TNT-TV's "Cold Sassy Tree." Lo and 
behold, this is Faye's most subtle and moving performance in years. She has 
admirably subdued herself. (Those electric gestures and that high voltage 
personality have at times been an albatross around her talented neck. She was 
just too much for audiences to take -- or to take seriously.) 
</P>
<P>
In "Cold Sassy Tree," the star is in complete control. This is miles away from 
the pyrotechnics of "Mommie Dearest" and is a finer piece of work than her more 
recent, acclaimed, but largely unseen movie, "Barfly." 
</P>
<P>
If Faye Dunaway is lucky and gets more good scripts, she could begin to make 
those younger stars -- Streep, Turner, Pfeiffer, Foster -- just a little bit 
nervous.

Prince Charles and Princess Diana arrived in Hong Kong today for a three-day 
official visit, possibly the last by British royalty before the colony reverts 
to China in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
All air traffic was halted before the royal flight touched down at Kai Tak 
Airport, which has one of the world's most spectacular runways, jutting out 
into the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Charles is expected to hear the concerns of Chinese in Hong Kong who are 
worried about their future under Beijing sovereignty. Local fears have been 
heightened by the crushing in June of China's pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had been scheduled to visit China, but the trip was canceled after 
the brutal crackdown in Beijing, and they went to Indonesia instead after a 
last-minute invitation by President Suharto. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Houston the Duchess of York ended a five-day visit to Texas with 
a visit to an inner-city school where she took part in a day filled with 
anti-drug messages. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old former Sarah Ferguson was also serenaded by more than 600 
pupils at Blackshear Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
The duchess, who is married to Britain's Prince Andrew, came to Houston on 
Thursday at the invitation of the Houston Grand Opera, which is saluting 300 
years of British opera.

MURAL OF JIMI HENDRIX TO STAY

<TEXT>
<P>
A mural of the late guitarist Jimi Hendrix at a high school will not be 
whitewashed despite a petition by some students who object to the rock star's 
drug use. 
</P>
<P>
"I hesitate to accept that Jimi Hendrix's life and work can or should be 
condensed into, 'He is a symbol of drug abuse,' " Ridgefield High School 
Principal Elaine Bessette said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Fulkerson, the student who started the petition drive, said he is 
disappointed with the decision but added that more students wanted the mural 
than did not. He had said that it is hypocritical to display a symbol of the 
drug culture in school and collected nearly 100 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
The rock guitarist died in 1970 at the age of 27 when he reportedly suffocated 
after swallowing a large quantity of barbiturates. The petition drive prompted 
the estate of Jimi Hendrix to issue an open letter defending the rock star as 
an artist.

Police today arrested former European heavyweight boxing champion Alfredo 
Evangelista for possession of cocaine, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said a police patrol arrested the 34-year-old, Uruguayan-born 
Evangelista and two women early today in a central Madrid street after they saw 
him throw down a vial. Police say the vial contained nine grams of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1977, Evangelista, then European champion, fought champion Muhammad Ali 
in Landover, Md., for the world heavyweight title. Ali won a 15-round decision. 
Evangelista has not been active since 1987.

With heavyweight challenger Evander Holyfield shouting pointers from the 
audience, Larry Dixon of San Diego edged former 139-pound world champion Igor 
Ruzhnikov of the Soviet Union in the USSR-USA Heavyweight Boxing Invitational 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
It featured the top six weight classes in amateur boxing. 
</P>
<P>
The victory by Dixon, 21, America's third-ranked amateur in the 147-pound 
class, was one of two 3-2 decisions on the 10-bout card. It pulled the USA team 
into a 3-3 tie, but the Soviets swept the next three fights and won the card 
6-4. 
</P>
<P>
After Jerry Lee Williams won a unanimous decision over Andrei Kiselev in the 
165-pound opening bout, Vladimir Ereschenko evened the card with a 4-1 decision 
over Pat Byrd of Flint, Mich., in the 147-pound class. Viktor Akshonov then put 
the Soviets ahead with a 4-1 decision over Rodney Price of Elizabeth, N.J., in 
the 201-pound class. 
</P>
<P>
When Evegni Sudakov floored Raymond Carger of Bartsdale, La., at 1:54 of their 
201-pound bout, the referee awarded Sudakov a technical knockout. 
</P>
<P>
Other decisions went to Alexander Lebziak over Mario Munoz of Denver, Colo., in 
the 156-pound class; Rostislav Zaulichny over Frank Savannah of Spring Lake, 
N.Y., in the 165-pound class; Sergei Kobozev over Eugene Gill of Flint, Mich., 
RSC, at 1:00 of the third round in the 178-pound class; and Eddie Donerlson of 
Camp Lejune, N.C., over Vladimir Belousov in the 201-pound class.

Third-seeded Brad Gilbert of the United States crushed Pieter Aldrich 6-0, 6-1 
in the first round of a men's tennis tournament today, coming within one point 
of blanking the South African. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been close to that situation before, being within a point for 6-0, 
6-0," Gilbert said. "But I was striking the ball pretty good. I did everything 
well today -- I wish I could play like that all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert was the highest-ranked player in action on the opening day of the 
$440,000 men's tournament at Wembley Arena. Fourth-seeded Jimmy Connors was 
scheduled to wrap up the evening session against Alexander Volkov of the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
In other opening-day matches, Wally Masur of Australia beat Kelly Evernden of 
New Zealand 6-1, 6-2; Amos Mansdorf of Israel beat Christian Saceanu of West 
Germany 6-3, 6-3; Guy Forget of France beat John Fitzgerald of Australia 6-3, 
6-2; Michael Stich of West Germany beat American Ken Flach 6-4, 6-7, 6-3; and 
Flach's longtime doubles partner, Robert Seguso, beat Andrew Castle of Britain 
6-1, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Top seed John McEnroe and second-seeded Michael Chang play their first-round 
matches Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert, who won four tournaments in a row last summer and has boosted his 
world ranking to No. 4, toyed with Aldrich in a 46-minute match. 
</P>
<P>
The American lost just six points in the first five games and a total of 26 in 
the match. 
</P>
<P>
Seguso came back from a 3-0 deficit in the second set to wrap up his victory 
over Castle in 53 minutes, winning the last three games.

RACER PROST SAYS ARCHRIVAL DRIVEN TOO MUCH BY SUCCESS

<P>
World driving champion Alain Prost was quoted today as saying archrival Ayrton 
Senna "destroyed" Formula One racing with his obsession with success. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a computer; he sees only the success. He is risking his life just to win 
and to become world champion. I find this price is too high," Prost was quoted 
as saying in the East German newspaper Deutsches Sportecho. 
</P>
<P>
Prost took the Formula One title away from Senna this year in a season marked 
by crashes on the track and clashes between the two McLaren-Honda teammates. 
</P>
<P>
The two barely acknowledged each other through most of the season and Prost 
accused McLaren of favoring Senna, especially after the French driver announced 
that he would compete for Ferrari next year. 
</P>
<P>
Their final battle involved the championship itself. 
</P>
<P>
Senna and Prost collided in the next-to-last Grand Prix of the season, in 
Japan. Prost was knocked out of the race but Senna managed to get started again 
and crossed the finish line first before organizers declared that he had 
re-entered the track illegally. 
</P>
<P>
The victory went to Alessandro Nannini, and Senna's disqualification gave Prost 
the season title. 
</P>
<P>
The International Automobile Federation then fined Senna $100,000 and banned 
him from driving for six months, with the ban suspended on condition that the 
Brazilian show more concern for safety on the track. McLaren says it will take 
the case to court. 
</P>
<P>
Prost, however, said Senna had gone too far. 
</P>
<P>
"Senna destroyed the Formula One by thinking only about success," Prost was 
quoted as saying in the interview. 
</P>
<P>
Prost said he was leaving the McLaren team because he was beginning to miss 
"the human side."

The NFL Players Assn. has informed the league that it plans to disband because 
of a court decision upholding the NFL's free agency system and invalidating the 
union's antitrust suit. 
</P>
<P>
John Jones, a spokesman for the NFL Management Council, confirmed that the 
council had received a letter from Gene Upshaw, the NFLPA's executive director, 
stating the union's intention. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Allen, the union's assistant executive director, confirmed that a letter 
was sent, as reported today by the Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 8th Circuit Court of Appeals last week ruled that NFL owners were not 
in violation of antitrust laws simply because of an impasse in negotiations 
between the union and management. In effect, that 2-1 decision negated the 
union's antitrust suit against the league, filed at the conclusion of its 
unsuccessful strike two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
On the day of the decision, the union said it was considering either appealing 
to the full nine-judge panel or the U.S. Supreme Court. It also suggested that 
it would consider decertification. 
</P>
<P>
"The NFLPA Executive Committee has voted to abandon bargaining rights and begin 
the decertification process," the letter said. "This action was made necessary 
by the Eighth Circuit's decision, which purports to extend the NFLPA's labor 
exemption to your illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not form our union to allow you to illegally restrain trade in the 
market for player services. The players would rather protect their rights as 
independent contractors than to subject themselves to the monopolistic whims of 
the NFL and its clubs." 
</P>
<P>
The players reportedly have to vote on the union's decertification. The union 
assumes, the Globe said, that once decertification is complete, every player 
would become a free agent at the end of his present contract, rendering as 
illegal the college draft, the waiver system and the Plan B form of free 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
However, Jones said that as far as management is concerned, all the NFL's 
contract rules would remain in effect, just as they do for any other business. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Donlan, executive director of the Management Council, told the Globe the 
owners would "have to wait to see how genuine" the decertification move is. 
</P>
<P>
"Are they saying this is some new kind of strategy, or do they really mean it?" 
Donlan said. "Either way, we will find a way to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
"None of us would like to see the union go out of business," Donlan said. "They 
certainly wouldn't be doing what is right for their players, who would lose all 
of their benefits." 
</P>
<P>
If the union folds, the newspaper said, the players would lose about $50,000 a 
year in health and life insurance and pension benefits.
