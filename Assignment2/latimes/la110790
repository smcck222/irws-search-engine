IKE'S WARNING ON MILITARY SPENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the midst of the insanity now going on, along comes Willens with a breath of 
fresh air. The crushing budget negotiations could easily have been resolved by 
further reductions in the military but for our precipitous, saber-rattling 
excursion into the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Having long ago appointed ourselves as world policemen, we continue to maintain 
bloated troops and equipment around the globe, meanwhile living beyond our 
means. And why didn't we send troops and equipment already under arms in 
Europe, Japan, Korea, etc. to the gulf? 
</P>
<P>
Eisenhower warned us of the evils of the military-industrial complex long ago. 
Let us wise up and insist on more realistic cutbacks to finally rid us of this 
cancer in our society. The Japanese and West Germans are not doing too badly 
following such sane policies.

KILLING BIRDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is my opinion the government's actions in killing birds and other wildlife 
in a so-called effort to strengthen its case against Exxon is criminal, 
despicable and indefensible. Exxon's disaster apparently stemmed from 
negligence, while the government's actions were undoubtedly premeditated with 
malice aforethought. Let's forget about Exxon and prosecute the government.

CHORUS LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The life and death of Rabbi Meir Kahane, who was murdered Monday in New York, 
were the sum not only of what he embraced but also of what he rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Kahane was a part of that ugly little chorus that always seems to chant from 
the fringes of the democratic drama. 
</P>
<P>
It is vile company -- America's David Duke, Ulster's Ian Paisley, France's Jean 
Marie Le Pen -- and if they signify anything beyond the imperishability of 
bigotry, it is that democracy is the necessary but not sufficient condition of 
a decent society. 
</P>
<P>
In this connection, it is worth recalling that while Kahane sought to impose 
his racist program on the state of Israel, he himself was born, educated and 
first came to prominence in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
A fraction of the Israeli electorate cast votes for Kahane's wretched Kach 
Party; but the bulk of its funds always have come from Americans. They 
continued to support him even after the Israeli Supreme Court had proscribed 
his party because it was "Nazi-like," "racist" and "undemocratic." Among Kach's 
goals are the forcible expulsion of all Palestinians and criminalization of 
marriage between Jews and non-Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Ordained heir to one of mankind's great and humane juridical traditions -- the 
Talmud -- Kahane also earned a degree in international law from a prestigious 
American university. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, he abandoned both for another law -- the law of the jungle. It was 
in its service that he lived, and by its blind and unfeeling hand that he died.

SUPERVISORS OF THE LOST CAUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tiny cabal of white men who control the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors is really in trouble now. Another court ruled that they 
discriminated against Latinos when they redrew district lines in 1981. Yet the 
board may waste more taxpayers' money to further appeal its lost cause. The 
supervisors should think again. Judge after judge is seeing the county's case 
for the sham it is. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a decision by U.S. 
District Judge David V. Kenyon that ordered an election in a new, realigned 1st 
supervisorial district. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon's decision had the unfortunate effect of nullifying the June primary 
election to replace retiring Supervisor Pete Schabarum. In that election, 
Schabarum aide, Sarah Flores was the top vote-getter against Superior Court 
Judge Gregory O'Brien. Both candidates still could run in a new election 
against any other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
While that's not especially fair to Flores or O'Brien, they knew the risk they 
were taking when they ran while a lawsuit was pending. The fault lies not with 
the courts, which are only upholding the Voting Rights Act, but with the 
stubborn three-man board majority. They've already spent about $5 million on 
this case at a time while denying many decent health care. Now they say they'll 
appeal, if need be, all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Before they do, they should ponder the dissent by a conservative member of the 
three-judge panel that upheld Kenyon. While he questioned the new 1st district 
lines, Judge Alex Kozinski agreed with Kenyon's "careful finding" in the case, 
writing that it showed clear discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"This case will be remembered," Kozinski wrote, "for its lucid demonstration 
that elected officials engaged in a single-minded pursuit of incumbency can run 
roughshod over the rights of protected minorities." 
</P>
<P>
The trio on the county board claim to be conservatives, but they're spending 
public money liberally to protect themselves. If a smart conservative judge can 
see through their case, the Supreme Court could, too. They should drop this 
loser now. L.A. County's changing, boys, and it's time to get with the new 
program.

MORNING AFTER: THE RESULTS SO FAR; 
</P>
<P>
IS THE PROCESS UP TO THE CHALLENGE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What if they gave an election and no one came? 
</P>
<P>
That didn't happen yesterday, of course. But if the general voter trend line 
continues its southward descent, it's theoretically conceivable that the last 
voter will turn the lights out in the polling booth sometime well prior to the 
year, oh, 3000. 
</P>
<P>
TURNOFF-TURNOUT: The reason is fairly simple. This was another one of those 
turnoff-turnout elections. In the nation at large, people were not so much 
inspired to vote as guilt-driven to vote. Nothing is inherently wrong with 
guilt as a motivator, of course, just as there's nothing in the Constitution 
that requires candidates to be intelligent and the issues rationally presented. 
</P>
<P>
But it would be nice. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is there anything in the Constitution requiring television and radio ads to 
educate and illuminate, rather than demean or infuriate. In California the 
airwaves quickly became the functional equivalent of a second-stage smog alert. 
Who can forget the kid with cancer in the TV ad urging you to vote Yes on Big 
Green? (Blunt translation: Vote no and support cancer). Or, in North Carolina, 
the TV ad of the white man getting the termination letter because of hiring 
quotas (Blunt translation: vote for the white candidate Jesse Helms or lose 
your job to them). And notice how candidates everywhere were falling all over 
themselves -- almost stepping happily over dead bodies -- to aver they would be 
the quickest to use the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
True, there's nothing in the Constitution to stop this kind of deception (the 
First Amendment doesn't get into quality control), and there's no reason for 
candidates to absolutely require their handlers to market them as a commodity 
any more magisterial than a bar of soap or an automobile. 
</P>
<P>
But it would be nice. 
</P>
<P>
MAIL CALL: And if many voters across the nation were turned off by the quality 
of the election, in California some turnoff was attributable to the sheer bulk 
of the ballot this time: In some locales the ballot seemed a life's work. No 
surprise that about 20% of voters availed themselves of the opportunity to go 
the absentee route. With the ballot like a political-science take-home exam, a 
large part of the state in effect decided to mail in the election. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt there'll be a groundswell of public support for initiative reform. Not 
only were there too many propositions, too many of them were too complex, 
absurdly detailed, often baffling. Taken all together, the 28 state ballot 
propositions in California were a bit like one large video game -- poisonous 
meanies looking to gobble up the good guys. Nobody is asking for a pristine 
election done to the fine polish of, say, the erudite debating principles of 
the Oxford Union. Life is messy and politics can be, too. 
</P>
<P>
But is it too much to ask politics somehow to rise to the occasion of the 
challenge of our troubled time? It's true that while Americans are guaranteed 
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, they aren't guaranteed a system in 
which the cream necessarily rises to the top. 
</P>
<P>
But it would be nice.

MR. PRESIDENT, WATCH YOUR LIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When all is said and done, the foreign policy of the United States is what the 
President says it is. Experts and advisers help define that policy and carry 
out its goals. But it is the President who has the final word, whose voice is 
given most credence at home and around the world. It is what the President says 
that sets the course of U.S. international relations. 
</P>
<P>
George Bush has been around Washington a long time, long enough to understand 
that even the most seemingly offhand presidential comment can have significant 
global consequences. In recent weeks he has not always remembered that. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the continuing buildup of U.S. and other forces in the anti-Iraq 
coalition and what flows from it. By common military estimate, those forces are 
nearing a level where offensive action could soon be undertaken. By a 
conjunction of events, this has occurred while Bush has been campaigning for 
his party's candidates. Bush has alluded often in the campaign to what is going 
on in the Persian Gulf area, in so doing implicitly describing American policy 
there. But he has tended to do so using the emotional rhetoric of the stump, 
not the carefully weighed sentences of statecraft. The results have been more 
perplexing than illuminating, even to some of Bush's closest aides. 
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein is a dangerous and evil man, and the United States has done the 
right thing in opposing his expansionism. But the Iraqi dictator is not another 
Hitler, let alone -- as Bush would have it -- worse than Hitler. At some point 
there may be no alternative to using military power to repeal Iraq's aggression 
and to punish the aggressor. It is useful and even morally necessary that 
everyone concerned be alerted to that somber possibility. But the campaign 
trail is not the place from which that message should be sent. 
</P>
<P>
Ad-lib remarks made in a partisan context threaten to trivialize issues of 
deadly seriousness. The shaping of U.S. foreign policy requires the most 
careful thought. Expressing that policy requires equal care. Lately, Saddam 
Hussein may have been left confused about what Bush has been saying. So, 
unhappily, have many Americans.

IKE'S WARNING ON MILITARY SPENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For many years I have been paraphrasing Ike's comments with regard to the 
military and the imposition it puts us. 
</P>
<P>
Willens' column outlined how stupid we Americans can be at times. 
</P>
<P>
I think we have the perfect opportunity to evaluate a Stealth bomber. Send one 
across Iraq and if it is detected, scrap the program. 
</P>
<P>
The "pie in the sky fantasy" remark regarding "Star Wars" is a classic and very 
appropriate. Do we really expect the Russians, or anyone else for that matter, 
to send nuclear missiles across the oceans? The Soviet Union can't even put 
bread on the table for all its citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The American people need to wake up to reality. I hope it's not too late.

REPARATIONS FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To black leaders such as Daniels drumming the issue of reparations, I have to 
say that this door you're opening is the lid on Pandora's box, from which great 
evil will arise. Does every white American bear the guilt for enslaving blacks? 
We must, since we are all going to have to pay. 
</P>
<P>
And if so, we have established the principle of racial guilt. I as a white man 
am guilty of wrongs -- not even crimes, for slavery was legal and had existed 
for all of human history before we in the Western world decided it was wrong 
and put a stop to it. But I am guilty of these deeds now perceived to be wrong, 
committed more than a century ago by people with whom I am associated only by 
skin color, not, and I emphasize, by descent -- for my ancestors were not in 
this country 100 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But if I am guilty because of my skin color, we have established a principle of 
jurisprudence of racial guilt, and we had all better think carefully if we want 
to abandon the principle of individual responsibility in favor of collective 
guilt. 
</P>
<P>
I think it is apparent from this formula that what is being proposed is nothing 
less than a recipe for increased strife between the races, which will only 
benefit those who gain power by stoking the fires of hatred, bitterness and 
resentment.

<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: AFTER OPENING WITH TWO IMPRESSIVE VICTORIES AT HOME, THEY GET 
BLOWN OUT BY THE WARRIORS AT OAKLAND, 130-109. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
OAKLAND 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Clippers found the other side of the mountain Tuesday night, the flip side 
to the emotional summit they had reached with their 20-point comeback victory 
two nights earlier. 
</P>
<P>
This time, they played Golden State tough for the first half and then took a 
header. Being outscored by 11 in the third quarter was a start, and this time 
the Warriors made sure they finished it, cruising to a 130-109 victory before 
15,015 at the Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"Sunday's game was in the back of all our minds," said Tim Hardaway, who had 12 
points, 13 assists and six steals for the Warriors. "If we were up by 20 this 
time, we were going to keep the pressure on. We were just doing things tonight 
that we should have done in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't help, of course, that the Warriors were adding by threes -- four 
consecutive possessions midway through the final quarter that resulted in 
either a three-point basket (by Rod Higgins) or a three-point play (by Tom 
Tolbert, Sarunas Marciulionis and Tyrone Hill). 
</P>
<P>
That might have been more spectacular had it really mattered, but they already 
led, 106-85, when the string started. When it ended, the Clippers were 2-1, 
with the Detroit Pistons up tonight at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers got Danny Manning back after two games on the sidelines, and he 
contributed 15 points. But they were without Benoit Benjamin and Charles Smith, 
and this time, more than in Sunday's 109-107 victory, missed a defensive 
presence inside, especially during the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"(The Warriors) came out in the third quarter and were aggressive, no getting 
around that," Clipper Coach Mike Schuler said. "They elevated their play." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers could not reach. Ken Norman finished with 30 points and eight 
rebounds, Bo Kimble had 20 points, and Gary Grant added 12 assists, his third 
game in a row with better than double figures, and it still wasn't enough. Not 
against a team that made 58.4% of its shots to increase its season average to 
55.7% and 133 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
There was no indication of this early for the Clippers. After getting just 18 
and 16 points, respectively in the first quarters of the first two games, they 
went for 31 this time with a carry-over of intensity from the come-from-behind 
win at home. All that got them, though, was a one-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State, playing its home opener, started the second period with a 14-2 
run over 3:57. That gave the Warriors a 44-33 advantage, which they proceeded 
to almost lose, the Clippers drawing to within 51-45 before ending the half 
trailing only by 60-55. 
</P>
<P>
Norman had 15 points by then on six-of-10 shooting. Manning and Kimble both 
made four of seven attempts for nine points. 
</P>
<P>
Looking to break an eight-game losing streak in Oakland, the Clippers pulled 
within four in the third quarter, the last time at 65-61 with 9:28 left, and 
then disintegrated. The Warriors went on 13-0 and 15-2 surges, exposing the 
Clipper defense with apparent ease. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the charge, Chris Mullin did the damage. A short jumper in the lane. 
Following a pair of free throws by Tolbert, a three-point jumper from straight 
away. A layup, the first of four successive trips Golden State would rip 
through for a layin or dunk, Mitch Richmond getting two in a row. 
</P>
<P>
With 6:32 left, some three minutes after the power surge began, the Warriors' 
lead climbed to 80-63 and on the way to 92-69. It was 97-81, heading into the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
That played out without too much more bleeding, all that remained was for the 
Clippers to pack up and head out on a late flight. The Pistons are coming. 
</P>
<P>
"I just told them let's go home," Schuler said. "The expression is, 'Protect 
your own crib.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors apparently know it well. With Mullin getting 26 points, and 
Richmond and Marciulionis each adding 21, they did it. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Benoit Benjamin missed his third consecutive game with a separated shoulder and 
Charles Smith also sat out with a badly sprained foot and ankle. Trainer Keith 
Jones said Benjamin is "questionable to probable" for tonight's game against 
the Detroit Pistons at the Sports Arena and that Smith, who sat out the second 
half of Sunday's win over Golden State, is probable. The Clippers are hoping 
for a rush order on a foot arch that for Smith, who took a mold Monday for the 
process that normally takes four to six days. . . . Danny Manning, Smith and 
Benjamin are on the all-star ballot for February's game at Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Schuler wasn't taking added joy in the Clippers' victory Sunday because it 
came against the Warriors, the team he was an assistant coach with last season 
and whose coach, Don Nelson, has twice hired Schuler for his staff. Coming back 
from 20 points down in the second quarter was enough this time. "If that ever 
occurred, it was the first time we played, when I was at Portland and he was 
still with Milwaukee," Schuler said. "I'll tell you straight up, that was a big 
day, coaching against who I consider the best coach in the NBA. I never 
admitted that in Portland, but that's what it meant to me, because I respect 
Nellie so much." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clipper update -- The team took a charter flight home from Oakland after 
Tuesday night's 130-109 loss to Golden State, rather than get an early wake-up 
call today to return to Los Angeles -- a move the Clippers hope will mean a 
fresh team tonight. They did the same thing last season from Portland and beat 
Detroit at the Sports Arena, 83-79, in one of the Clippers' best showings of 
the season. Charles Smith averaged 20 points and 13 rebounds in the two games 
against the Pistons in 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
Piston update -- Isiah Thomas and Bill Laimbeer have been starting despite 
injuries. Thomas has been wearing goggles to protect a torn tear duct, and 
Laimbeer has been wearing a clear plastic mask over his broken left cheekbone. 
Dennis Rodman is still bothered by a chronic sprained left ankle, but he had 10 
rebounds in each of the first two games and played typically strong defense. 
Before Tuesday night's 100-92 loss at to the SuperSonics at Seattle, the 
Pistons had seven players scoring in double figures in a victory over the 
Milwaukee Bucks and six in beating the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Pistons have 
lost two of their last three games at the Sports Arena.

OVERTIME IS LAKER LOSING TIME; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: THEY BLOW A SIX-POINT LEAD IN EXTRA PERIOD TO FALL TO TRAIL 
BLAZERS, 125-123.

<P>
If you want to know what the Lakers have left, it was enough to grab a 
six-point lead in overtime over the Western Conference champion Portland Trail 
Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
But if you want to know what the Blazers have left, it was enough to score 
eight points in the last 1:39 of the extra period to rally for a 125-123 
victory over the Lakers, ruining their home opener Tuesday night before a 
non-sellout 16,361 in the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson had 22 assists and Vlade Divac had 21 points and 13 rebounds, but 
those are just statistics now. The Lakers are 0-2, their first such start since 
the 1984-85 season. 
</P>
<P>
For Divac, it represented by far his finest recent performance. Divac received 
his all-rookie award before the game, and after the preseason he has had, he 
may be eligible for comeback player of the year, too. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Johnson said he still has some things to work on. 
</P>
<P>
"We just blew the game ourselves," Johnson said. "We beat ourselves. Even in 
regulation, we had control but we were fouling (Portland shot 19 free throws in 
the fourth quarter, making 15) or doing something we shouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Divac) did a good job offensively. Now we have to get him to where he 
doesn't reach and foul. If we can keep him from fouling out, we're going to be 
a good team." 
</P>
<P>
Trail Blazer guard Terry Porter scored his team's last six points, including 
the game-winning field goal with 11 seconds remaining. He went right-to-left 
across the floor with A.C. Green pursuing him. Inside the top of the circle, 
Porter pulled up, took the ball between his legs and made an 18-foot jumper. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers set up for a last shot. Terry Teagle wound up taking it from 
three-point range at the buzzer but hit the side of the rim. 
</P>
<P>
Thus was extinguished a night-long Laker rally of their own. They trailed by 
eight points late in the second period but fought back through the second half, 
finally tying it with 6.8 seconds left when Johnson found Divac under the hoop 
for a layup. 
</P>
<P>
Divac then appeared to take over the overtime, scoring the Lakers' first four 
points on a pair of 20-footers and getting their first four rebounds. A moment 
later, James Worthy laid in a pretty Johnson lob and the Lakers led, 123-117. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the Lakers, they didn't score again. 
</P>
<P>
With 2:08 left, Divac committed his sixth foul and departed. 
</P>
<P>
And before you knew it, here came the Blazers. Clyde Drexler, who took -- and 
made -- back-to-back three-pointers in the first half when he had just missed 
five of his first six shots, rained in another three-pointer. Suddenly it 
wasn't a matter of whether the Trail Blazers would get blanked in the overtime, 
but a game again, with the Lakers up, 123-120. 
</P>
<P>
At the Laker end, Johnson was called for charging. 
</P>
<P>
At the Blazer end, Porter scored on a layup. 
</P>
<P>
At the Laker end, Mychal Thompson was called for moving on a screen. 
</P>
<P>
At the Blazer end, Porter was fouled on a drive and made his first free throw, 
tying it 123-123. He missed the second but Thompson couldn't control the 
rebound, which went out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Blazers then ran a play in which Porter came off a screen and hit the 
game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
When the Lakers ran their last play, it was a two-man game, Johnson coming off 
a center's pick, but with the No. 1 center on the bench, watching. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some plays like that, but they're geared to him (Divac)," Johnson 
said. "If they double on me, he had that shot." 
</P>
<P>
This time the Blazers doubled, the Lakers swung the ball outside and Teagle 
fired to beat the block. Some seasons, it starts out that way. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Play of the night: Clyde Drexler's amazing reverse layup on which he went under 
and far past the board and tomahawked the ball backward. It even compares to 
Julius Erving's oft-replayed reverse layup against the Lakers in the '80 
finals. . . . Mike Dunleavy, on the loss: "As much as you want it to happen 
right away, sometimes it just takes some time." 
</P>
<P>
Two Blazer forwards were forced out of the game. Jerome Kersey cartwheeled 
through the air, fell on his nect and left the game in the first period. He has 
a cervical sprain and will be re-examined in Portland. Later, Cliff Robinson 
sprained an ankle. . . . The Blazers had a terrific night shooting 
three-pointers, making nine of 15. Danny Ainge was four for five and Drexler 
three for four. . . . Next: Lakers host Sacramento Friday night.

MORNING BRIEFING: IF THIS WERE THE WORLD SERIES, THEY'D HAVE THE BROOMS OUT

Pacific Rim alert: Japanese baseball all-stars win first four games against 
touring American all-star team. 
</P>
<P>
They're beating the likes of Cecil Fielder, Dave Stewart, Bobby Thigpen and Rob 
Dibble. 
</P>
<P>
Said Chicago Cub Manager Don Zimmer, who is managing the American team: "I'm 
trying everything to win. We want to win. We all want to win. But they've 
outplayed us." 
</P>
<P>
Japanese commentators have begun to strike a note of parity. 
</P>
<P>
Said Yoshikazu Matsubayashi, a writer for Baseball magazine: "(Japanese) 
pitching is now almost at the American level." 
</P>
<P>
And an announcer on Nippon Television's national newscast remarked: "The major 
leaguers have received a lesson since coming to Japan." 
</P>
<P>
Add Japanese baseball: Time for a reality check. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Whiting, whose book "You Gotta Have Wa" detailed the differences between 
the Japanese and American approaches to the game, told Dan Biers of the 
Associated Press: "Japanese baseball is better than most Americans think. But 
it's not as good as some of these Japanese commentators are starting to say 
now." 
</P>
<P>
The author said that he asked the manager of the Seibu Lions, winners of this 
year's Japan Series championship, how his team would do against the World 
Series champion Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
Said Whiting: "He threw up his hands and said, 'There's no way we'd win.' " 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Sunday's game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas 
Cowboys will be 49er quarterback Joe Montana's debut at Texas Stadium. What is 
the only other NFL stadium where Montana has never played? 
</P>
<P>
Is nothing sacred?: College football purists complain of corporate identities 
being slapped on time-honored postseason games, such as the "USF&amp;G Sugar 
Bowl" and the "Mobil Cotton Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
They can't say that about the Sunshine Classic, which will stage its inaugural 
game Dec. 28 at Miami's Joe Robbie Stadium. Officials recently announced that 
they had signed a sponsorship agreement with a chain of video stores. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, though, it just won't seem the same, calling the Sunshine Classic the 
Blockbuster Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Hedging his bets: Bill Cohen of West Covina is having trouble deciding whose 
predicted order of finish to go with in Big Ten basketball -- Street and 
Smith's annual preview or Dick Vitale's. 
</P>
<P>
Street and Smith's likes Ohio State to win, with Michigan State second. Dick 
Vitale's switches them. Both like Indiana, Minnesota and Purdue for Nos. 3, 4 
and 5, and Iowa and Northwestern for 9 and 10. 
</P>
<P>
But in the Nos. 6, 7 and 8 spots, Street and Smith's has Illinois, Michigan and 
Wisconsin respectively, whereas Dick Vitale's says Michigan, Wisconsin and 
Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Why is Cohen confused? Two magazines have the right to differ, don't they? 
</P>
<P>
Sure, but both predictions were written by Jack Ebling of the Lansing (Mich.) 
State Journal. 
</P>
<P>
Who goofed?: The answer to Tuesday's trivia question should have said that the 
captain of the 1938-39 USC basketball team was Bob Goodrich, not Gail. Gail 
Goodrich, Bob's son, was a co-captain of UCLA's 1964-65 team, as reported. 
</P>
<P>
So make the correction on page 68 of your 1990-91 USC Basketball Media Guide, 
made from 100% recycled (and recyclable) paper. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Cincinnati Red center fielder Eric Davis, on being the first major 
leaguer to wear high-top spikes, now also worn by Kevin Mitchell, Barry Bonds 
and Darryl Strawberry: "I'm no trend-setter. I have bone chips in my ankles. 
They wear them because they look good." TED BROCK

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
Starting Thursday night, a reminder will hang from the north wall of the Forum 
that the Kings had a superstar skater long before Wayne Gretzky and silver and 
black. . . . 
</P>
<P>
His name is Marcel Dionne, a.k.a. Little Beaver and Lou Costello. His purple 
and gold No. 16 sweater will be retired before the Kings' game against Detroit, 
and a facsimile will be placed next to that of Los Angeles' first hockey 
superstar, non-skater Rogie Vachon. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Dionne was a sportswriter's delight. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Oh, what a joy it was to watch him deke a defenseman, skate around another, and 
flip home a wrist shot on his way to 1,771 points, which now is No. 3 on the 
NHL's all-time list. . . . 
</P>
<P>
And, oh, how useful were the quotes volunteered by an outspoken, glib, and 
brutally honest man who said everything except "no comment." . . . 
</P>
<P>
The retirement of Dionne's sweater is another example of the NHL's being one of 
the few leagues where you don't have to be big to excel. Marcel played at 5 
feet 8 and 190 pounds, goalie Vachon at 5-7 and 165. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The opening of the Hollywood Park fall meeting today couldn't come soon enough 
for horsemen after the recent tragedies at Belmont and Santa Anita. The 
Inglewood oval long has been acclaimed as one of the safest in the country. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Desormeaux, who set a national record when he worked primarily on the 
Maryland circuit, proved he could ride with the best when he won the Oak Tree 
jockey title in only his third full Southern California meeting. . . . 
</P>
<P>
An interesting newcomer to Hollywood Park is trainer Billy Cesare, who will 
saddle horses in all three stakes races this week. The 35-year-old from Miami 
played safety with the Detroit Lions, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and three USFL 
teams. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Only two weeks after his surprising second-place finish in the Breeders' Cup 
mile, Itsallgreektome will race in the Hollywood Derby Sunday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Russians are coming! The Russians are coming! The Soviets will be at the 
Bren Center on the UC Irvine campus for the U.S. Badminton championships today 
through Sunday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: Bob Welch and James Taylor. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Wasn't that segment with Vice President Dan Quayle on "Monday Night Football" a 
little long? Well, I guess anything to get the viewer's mind off the New York 
Giant-Indianapolis Colt game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best female sportscaster is CNN's Hannah Storm. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If you're not familiar with the John Hancock Bowl in El Paso, where USC is 
supposed to play Michigan State on New Year's Eve, it used to be known as the 
plain old Sun Bowl. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Comparative scores against common opponents of the nation's No. 1 and 2 teams: 
Notre Dame 37, Purdue 11. Washington 20, Purdue 14. Stanford 36, Notre Dame 31. 
Washington 52, Stanford 16. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Maddox is the first UCLA quarterback to pass for more than 330 yards 
twice in a career, let alone a season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Another Cleveland Brown fall guy could be player personnel director Mike 
Lombardi. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco 49ers have the highest payroll in the NFL, $27.7 million. The 
Pittsburgh Steelers have the lowest, $13.1 million. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If Dexter Manley comes off the suspended list Nov. 18, the Washington Redskins 
will either have to activate him or put him on waivers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Duval Love is a Big Brother to a group of kids at the Child Studies' Center at 
St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica and has invited them to a Ram practice 
Thursday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Dobson will be master of ceremonies for the California Special Olympics' 
Spirit of Friendship awards dinner Saturday at the Beverly Hilton, which will 
honor the 12 very special people who climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro -- Diane Hall, Joe 
Hayden, David Heffernan, Steve Hickey, Patrick Hulsbus, Damon Parker, Jeff 
Scott, Steven Sepulveda, Stoney Sherman, Tim Shorten, Gary Stubblefield and 
Francisco Villasenor. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Riviera Country Club hopes to land the U.S. Open golf tournament sometime 
before the end of the century. The last time the tournament was played in 
Southern California was in 1948 at Riviera. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Who cares if the World Boxing Council doesn't sanction the Evander 
Holyfield-George Foreman heavyweight title fight? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Horse racing movies usually are hokey, but "Phar Lap" was an exception. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton's poor start couldn't have happened to a nicer general manager than 
Glen Sather or a nicer owner than Peter Pocklington. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If the Dodgers don't sign Darryl Strawberry, it could be 1977 all over again. 
That's when they failed to sign another free agent named Reggie Jackson and he 
beat them in the World Series.

SOVIETS NOT IN MOOD TO CELEBRATE ON BOLSHEVIK ANNIVERSARY; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNISM: A TRADITIONAL MILITARY PARADE WILL MARK REVOLUTION DAY. BUT IT WON'T 
BE A HAPPY HOLIDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN and MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MOSCOW 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The headquarters of the Communist Party are lit up like a Christmas tree. A 
huge portrait of Vladimir I. Lenin, founder of the Soviet state, covers the 
facade of the KGB's central offices. Red flags, flashing stars and glowing 
torches adorn buildings across the city. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the Soviet Union has never celebrated a Revolution Day the way it will 
today. Already on the eve of the 73rd anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution, 
the mood in the Soviet capital was far from festive. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer than a third of 2,222 Muscovites polled approved of the planned parade of 
tanks, missile launchers and armed troops through the capital and across Red 
Square in the traditional demonstration of Soviet military strength, according 
to a study by the All-Union Center for the Study of Public Opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous years, the stores have not been stocked full of scarce foods 
for holiday tables, and many people say their economic hardships leave them 
with no appetite for celebration. 
</P>
<P>
And for the first time, people seemed unsure about whether to wish each other 
"happy holiday," as has been the custom for decades. 
</P>
<P>
There were even doubts at the traditional Kremlin celebration of the 
revolution. Normally a meeting of self-congratulation and praise for the 
Communist Party, the gathering of nearly 5,000 readily acknowledged the 
questions that many people have about where the country had gone wrong as well 
as the angry tempers today. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it is difficult today to understand what is what," Anatoly I. 
Lukyanov, the chairman of the Soviet Parliament, said. "It is difficult to make 
a simple decision, to discuss anything civilly." 
</P>
<P>
But the manifest problems of the country should not detract from the importance 
of the Bolshevik Revolution, Lukyanov asserted. "No one has the right to 
belittle the importance of this revolution and its influence on world history 
and the progress of human civilization," he said, answering the Communist 
Party's critics. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was criticism from other speakers. 
</P>
<P>
Describing this as "a time of great trial for the country, of national 
tragedies and an economic disaster," Irina A. Antonova, a museum director, drew 
thunderous applause when she said that the Soviet Union could only emerge by 
being honest about its mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"For many years, we have been living lies," Antonova said. "We must not allow 
people's minds to be poisoned further today with new lies." 
</P>
<P>
The country must distinguish, she argued, between the Bolshevik Revolution and 
"its noble, lofty ideals of freedom, justice, equality and the people's 
happiness" and the mistakes made later as the system grew increasingly 
totalitarian in character. 
</P>
<P>
Leonid Y. Bliznov, a machinist and a member of the Supreme Soviet, the 
country's legislature, turned his criticism on the current leadership, 
including President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Boris N. Yeltsin, the president of 
the Russian Federation, who were both seated behind him. 
</P>
<P>
Asking why the Soviet Union's two most powerful men could not put their rivalry 
aside and work for the good of the nation, Bliznov said: "It is 
incomprehensible who or what stands in the way of these two leaders who know 
the people's needs and whom the people recognize. Both must realize that 
continued opposition will cost them support." 
</P>
<P>
The criticism, supported by resounding applause, had its impact. Gorbachev 
approached Yeltsin after the meeting and, extending his hand, proposed that 
they meet, one on one, after the holiday to discuss their differences. 
</P>
<P>
"People must again look back and pay tribute to what the revolution did and 
what the mistakes were during that period," Yeltsin said, describing the 
holiday as a time for reflection. "The biggest mistake was turning things over 
to a totalitarian regime." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, speaking later at a state awards ceremony, said, "We know that 
people in the factories and in the lines (for food and consumer goods) say that 
we in the leadership know nothing about the situation and do less to change it. 
In fact, we are aware of all the problems, and we are working for change." 
</P>
<P>
All these doubts and disputes aside, the traditional military parade will still 
be held in Red Square today to celebrate the Bolshevik Revolution and the 
achievements of seven decades of socialism, and Soviet leaders will view it 
from Lenin's mausoleum just beneath the Kremlin's red walls. 
</P>
<P>
But two alternative demonstrations, both authorized by the Moscow city 
government, will highlight the darker sides of Soviet history. 
</P>
<P>
The Moscow Voters Assn., which sponsored several large anti-Communist 
demonstrations this year, will hold a "funeral march" from Staraya Ploshad, the 
square in front of the headquarters of the Communist Party, to the apartment 
building where longtime dissident and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Andrei D. 
Sakharov lived until his death in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The organizers say they see this demonstration as a chance to mourn innocent 
victims who died under repression sponsored by the Communist state. 
</P>
<P>
"The outcome of the revolution was that millions of our countrymen were 
murdered," Vera F. Kriger, an organizer of the rally, said. "Because of this, 
our demonstration can be nothing but a funeral march." 
</P>
<P>
In another alternative Moscow demonstration, radicals in the national 
Parliament will lead a march from the Byelorussian railway station to Red 
Square. Its leaders include Oleg D. Kalugin, a former general in the KGB state 
security and espionage agency, and anti-corruption campaigners Telman Gdlyan 
and Nikolai Ivanov. 
</P>
<P>
Across the country, controversies about whether to hold Revolution Day 
celebrations have become a barometer of public opinion about the Bolshevik 
Revolution, the society it created -- and what reforms the country must now 
undertake. 
</P>
<P>
A strike organizer in the Arctic mining city of Inta told the independent 
Postfactum news service that union members will hold posters with 
anti-Communist slogans and the three-color flag of pre-revolutionary Russia 
during the parade there. 
</P>
<P>
"Citizens, by turning this mournful date into a holiday," the Inta trade unions 
said, "we are once again committing an act of outrage with respect to all sons 
and daughters of Russia who perished in the bloody meat chopper started by the 
Communists." 
</P>
<P>
The nationalist government in Armenia canceled the holiday altogether. In 
neighboring Azerbaijan, the military commander called off the parade to avoid 
inciting further unrest in the capital, Baku, the scene of ethnic rioting in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Military parades were banished from main thoroughfares in many other major 
Soviet cities. 
</P>
<P>
In the southern Soviet republic of Georgia, where a bloc of parties calling for 
independence beat the Communists in elections last month, the army will hold a 
parade at a military base rather than in the center of Tbilisi, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council of Kiev, the capital of the Ukraine, ordered the military to 
hold its parade away from the city center so the soldiers would not clash with 
radical students, whose calls for independence from the Soviet Union have grown 
over the last several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In Leningrad, where the 1917 Revolution began, liberal Mayor Anatoly A. Sobchak 
quit his drive to cancel the holiday and sanctioned a traditional celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Patriarch Alexi II of the Russian Orthodox Church, whose followers had been 
persecuted through much of Soviet rule, told the government newspaper Izvestia 
that Revolution Day should be a time of somber reflection. 
</P>
<P>
"Let all the years that have passed rise in our conscience one after another," 
Alexi said, "and persuade us not to pay for politicians' experiments and 
principles with human destinies."

Nawaz Sharif was sworn in Tuesday as Pakistan's prime minister after ousted 
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto repeated charges of vote rigging and led a token 
opposition walkout from the National Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan administered the oath of office to Sharif at the 
President's Palace after he demonstrated his majority in the 217-seat National 
Assembly by getting 153 votes. 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto's candidate, Mohammed Afzel Khan, got 39 votes. 
</P>
<P>
Bhutto and her party deputies also boycotted the oath-taking ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
"My election amounts to the confidence of the people in my person," Sharif told 
the Assembly. "I wish to assure the people of Pakistan that I will do my utmost 
to come up to your expectations." 
</P>
<P>
Before the vote, Bhutto led her Pakistan People's Party deputies from the 
chamber when their demands for a secret ballot were rejected. She later 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
The election of Sharif, the 40-year-old head of the Islamic Democratic Alliance 
(IDA) and former chief minister of Punjab province, ended three months of 
political uncertainty after Bhutto's dismissal in August. Bhutto has charged 
that her loss at the polls Oct. 24 was the result of massive rigging.

IRAQ TO RELEASE 77 JAPANESE, 31 OTHER FOREIGNERS;

Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Tuesday ordered the release of 108 foreign 
hostages, including 77 Japanese nationals, in an apparent response to appeals 
from visiting delegations seeking to chip away at Baghdad's "human shield" 
against military attack. 
</P>
<P>
The release order also included 20 Italians, five Swedes, two Germans, two 
Portuguese and two Australians, according to the official Iraqi News Agency, 
which announced the partial exemption from a travel ban affecting an estimated 
2 million foreigners in Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The move followed a controversial series of visits to the Iraqi capital in 
recent days that have caused growing fears among some European leaders that 
individual hostage negotiations could undermine the international coalition 
against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone held a second day of meetings 
with Hussein in Baghdad on Tuesday, and former West German Chancellor Willy 
Brandt arrived in the Iraqi capital Monday in a visit aimed at winning exit 
visas for all foreigners held in Iraq and Kuwait. The missions follow similar 
private visits by former British Prime Minister Edward Heath and civil rights 
activist Jesse Jackson. Former New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange was 
reported en route to the Persian Gulf region to arrange a meeting with the 
Iraqi president. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, European foreign ministers renewed an earlier stance that 
nations should not negotiate unilaterally to free citizens trapped in Iraq and 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency credited Nakasone's appeals for the release of the 77 
Japanese and said the decision to free the other foreign nationals was based on 
similar outside requests, including one from a delegation of Swedish Muslims 
and another from a parliamentary delegation from Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Nakasone met with Hussein again Tuesday to "thank him for Iraq's decision to 
allow a large number of Japanese nationals -- elderly, sick and students -- to 
travel out," the INA said. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the Foreign Ministry listed only 69 Japanese scheduled for release, 
including 19 captives who were part of an estimated 600 foreigners being held 
as human shields at strategic sites to help fend off a military attack. The 
other 50 are Japanese businessmen who were in Iraq at the time of the invasion, 
according to Japan's Kyodo News Service. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe told reporters in Tokyo that Japan 
has not tried to secure the release of its nationals through individual 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq has already freed about 300 French nationals and smaller groups of other 
Westerners over the last few weeks and has indicated that all foreign "guests" 
might be released under certain conditions, including a commitment from the 
U.N. Security Council's permanent members not to use military action against 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Nakasone's visit was described as unofficial, and the German government has 
shown only lukewarm public support for the effort by Brandt, whose visit was 
"tolerated but not supported," officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt met at a government guest house Tuesday with 150 of the estimated 400 
Germans being detained in Iraq and Kuwait and also with Iraqi Foreign Minister 
Tarik Aziz and Deputy Prime Minister Taha Yassin Ramadan. He is scheduled to 
meet with Hussein today. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt also met unexpectedly Tuesday with Palestine Liberation Organization 
Chairman Yasser Arafat, who also met with Nakasone and later told reporters in 
Baghdad that prospects for peace in the region have improved. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Secretary of State James A. Baker III, meeting in Cairo with Chinese 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, received what he took to be an assurance that 
Beijing would not prevent the U.N. Security Council from authorizing the use of 
military force in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
A senior State Department official, reporting on Baker's meeting with Qian, 
said the foreign minister "didn't rule out" Security Council action. As one of 
the five permanent members of the Security Council, China has veto power. 
</P>
<P>
Although China voted for each of the 10 U.N. resolutions adopted so far 
condemning Iraq, the Beijing regime has been very cool to suggestions that the 
Security Council might authorize force. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters before the meeting if China would support military action, 
Qian said: "We'll still have to wait and see, because all the armed forces have 
two roles to play: One is to fight a war. The other is to seek peace." 
</P>
<P>
Baker also conferred with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.

Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh named a panel of outside managers Tuesday to help 
reform the Immigration and Naturalization Service, attempting to get a jump on 
a congressional report that is expected to direct new criticism at the 
embattled agency. 
</P>
<P>
Citing passage of a sweeping new immigration law in the waning hours of the 
101st Congress, Thornburgh said the immigration agency "must be better able to 
respond to its mission in a more efficient manner." 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the unusual move of recruiting outside experts to assist INS 
Commissioner Gene McNary, a Thornburgh appointee, the attorney general pointed 
to the findings of an internal audit.

DRUG CZAR BENNETT MAY QUIT, OFFICIALS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
ADMINISTRATION: HIS RESIGNATION WOULD BE THE SECOND CABINET-LEVEL DEPARTURE IN 
TWO WEEKS. HE IS EXPECTED TO CLAIM GAINS IN NARCOTICS CONTROL.

<P>
Bush Administration drug czar William J. Bennett plans to resign within the 
next few days, Administration officials said Tuesday. This would be the second 
Cabinet-level departure from the Administration in the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, who served as secretary of education during the Ronald Reagan 
Administration and then took on the drug job for Bush, is expected to claim as 
he departs that the Administration has made substantial progress in its highly 
touted war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
However, many analysts have criticized his approach for focusing too heavily on 
law enforcement at the expense of anti-drug education and drug treatment 
programs. Although funds have increased to attack both the supply and the 
demand sides of the problem, the increases for law enforcement have vastly 
outweighed treatment spending. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett supporters point to recent studies showing a decline in the use of 
cocaine among high school seniors and note that cocaine street prices 
reportedly have increased, while purity levels have decreased. They further 
note the successful prosecution of major drug kingpins during Bennett's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
However, others note that middle class use of drugs was declining well before 
Bennett's appointment and that drug-related violence in the inner-cities has 
shown a sharp and murderous upswing during the 18 months Bennett has presided 
over the nation's anti-drug efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett has been an assertive and outspoken advocate for anti-drug efforts. As 
he did in his previous job, he used his post of director of National Drug 
Control Policy as a pulpit from which to campaign against liberal social 
theorists, the legacies of the 1960s counter-culture and cultural 
permissiveness in general. 
</P>
<P>
At times, Bennett's approach to cultural issues led him into unwanted 
publicity. Earlier this year, for example, he denounced Bart Simpson, saying 
that the popular Fox Television cartoon character set a bad example for the 
nation's youth. The drug czar beat a hasty retreat when his statement became a 
subject of ridicule. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, who delights in combat and relishes being in the limelight, found the 
anti-drug post a perfect job -- at first. More recently, as the economy, the 
Persian Gulf and other issues pushed drugs out of the headlines, aides said the 
drug czar was becoming bored. Over the past two months, he has spent much of 
his time on the campaign trail, stumping for Republican candidates from Florida 
to Hawaii, Republican officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett's chief deputy, Reggie Walton, a former District of Columbia judge, is 
considered a leading candidate to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
As for Bennett's plans, sources said the 47-year-old former academic could be a 
leading candidate to replace his old mentor, John R. Silber, as president of 
Boston University if Silber wins his race to become governor of Massachusetts. 
Silber was Bennett's professor at the University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett's departure will open another vacancy in the Administration for 
President Bush to fill. Labor Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole left the 
Administration late last month to become head of the American Red Cross.

DEMOCRATS WIN GOVERNORSHIPS IN FLORIDA, TEXAS; 7 STATES UNDECIDED; 
</P>
<P>
STATEHOUSES: AT LEAST THREE INCUMBENTS ARE OUSTED. NO SINGLE ISSUE DOMINATED 
THE RACES.

<P>
Democrats Tuesday strengthened their hand heading into next year's 
congressional reapportionment, wresting control of governorships in rapidly 
growing Florida and Texas from the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
But both parties continued to sweat out results from seven gubernatorial races, 
including Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska and the richest prize on the ballot: 
the tight California governor's race between Republican Sen. Pete Wilson and 
former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
Those states will determine whether Democrats expand their current 29-21 margin 
in governorships. 
</P>
<P>
On a night with little turnover in Congress, the battle in the statehouses 
proved far more turbulent, with at least three incumbents being ousted and 
seven open seats changing party control. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats had the most to cheer about, marking gains in all parts of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
In Florida, former Democratic Sen. Lawton Chiles crushed GOP Gov. Bob Martinez, 
leading 1,829,444 to 1,420,418, or 56% to 44%, with 94% of the vote counted. 
</P>
<P>
In Texas, Democratic state Treasurer Ann Richards roared past Republican 
Clayton W. Williams Jr., leading 1,804,091 to 1,690,692, or 52% to 48%, with 
94% of the vote counted. 
</P>
<P>
In Kansas, Democratic state Treasurer Joan Finney ousted Republican Gov. Mike 
Hayden, who was weakened by an unpopular hike in property taxes. With 96% of 
the vote in, Finney led 370,895 to 321,431, or 54% to 46%. 
</P>
<P>
In Oklahoma, where Republican Gov. Henry Bellmon is stepping down, Democrat 
David Walters overwhelmed GOP candidate Bill Price 504,867 to 283,403, or 64% 
to 36%, with 97% of the vote counted. 
</P>
<P>
In Rhode Island, the third time proved a charm for Democratic businessman Bruce 
G. Sundlun who defeated Republican Gov. Edward DiPrete, after losing in both 
1986 and 1988. Sundlun won decisively, capturing 254,391 votes to DiPrete's 
87,573 with 99% of the vote in. In New Mexico, former Democratic Gov. Bruce 
King captured the seat being vacated by Republican Gov. Garrey E. Carruthers. 
With 92% of the vote in, King defeated Republican Frank Bond 204,318 to 
169,788, or 55% to 45%. 
</P>
<P>
For Republicans, the best early news came from Ohio, where former Cleveland 
Mayor George V. Voinovich defeated Democratic Atty. Gen. Anthony J. Celebrezze 
Jr., by 1,874,792 to 1,489,700, or 56%to 44%, with 98% of the vote in. 
</P>
<P>
In Massachusetts, former U.S. Atty. William F. Weld defeated Democrat John R. 
Silber. Weld led 830,608 to 809,438 with 77% of the vote in. 
</P>
<P>
Former Republican Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., running as an independent, won 
election in Connecticut, attracting 455,381 votes, or 40%, to 423,034, or 38%, 
for Republican Rep. John G. Rowland, and 232,048, or 21% for Democratic Rep. 
Bruce A. Morrison, with 99% of the vote in. 
</P>
<P>
With control of redistricting at stake, both parties devoted unusually heavy 
attention to governor's races this year. With results in California and Arizona 
unclear, Democrats enter the decennial redistricting controlling the 
governorships in at least five of the seven states expected to gain seats; with 
Illinois and Michigan still too close to call, Democrats now hold the 
governorship in six of the 13 states slated to lose seats. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, 36 governor's seats were contested Tuesday -- 20 of them currently 
held by Democrats, 16 by Republicans. These included some of the year's most 
closely watched campaigns. In particular, the battles for control of Florida, 
Texas and California -- the three states expected to gain the most new 
congressional seats in next year's reapportionment -- drew enormous national 
focus and set spending records. 
</P>
<P>
For Republicans, the Florida race became a long-shot as soon as Chiles entered 
the contest earlier this year. After a bruising primary victory over Rep. Bill 
Nelson, Chiles virtually coasted to victory over Martinez, who had suffered 
through a rocky first term. 
</P>
<P>
The Texas gubernatorial campaign was as chaotic as the Florida race placid. 
Spending millions of dollars of his own money, Williams held a double-digit 
lead through most of the fall. But a series of gaffes in early October 
undermined his support. CNN exit polls showed an enormous gender gap in the 
race, with men favoring Williams by 10 points, but women giving Richards an 
insurmountable 61-39 margin. 
</P>
<P>
Verbal fireworks also dominated the gubernatorial race in Massachusetts, where 
tart-tongued Democrat Silber outraged liberals with a series of acerbic remarks 
dubbed "Silber shockers." Exit polls showed Weld winning half the vote of 
self-described liberals, and nearly 40% of Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
In the other large industrial states, Democratic Govs. Mario M. Cuomo of New 
York and Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania won reelection, though Cuomo's margin 
of 53% represented a substantial drop from his record-setting 65% tally four 
years ago. But Michigan Democratic Gov. James J. Blanchard struggled against 
Republican John Engler in early returns. And Republicans were in a strong 
position to hold Illinois; with 72% of the vote in, Secretary of State Jim 
Edgar led Democratic Atty. Gen. Neil F. Hartigan 1,156,267 to 1,094,606. 
</P>
<P>
No single issue dominated the governors' races. Abortion appeared to have 
somewhat less of an impact than originally expected. 
</P>
<P>
In 20 states, voters chose between candidates who differed on the abortion 
issue. But those seats split between candidates who favored and opposed 
abortion rights. Democrats Chiles and Richards, both supporters of abortion 
rights, defeated Republicans who opposed abortion in Florida and Texas. But in 
Kansas and Ohio anti-abortion candidates swept to victory. 
</P>
<P>
Perceptions of the local economy seemed to be more decisive. In 10 states where 
control of governorships changed party, 72% of those surveyed by CNN rated the 
local economy weak. But only 40% were so pessimistic in the 18 states where the 
same party has already kept control of the Statehouse. 
</P>
<P>
Both parties were also keeping a close eye on state legislative races in the 
major states expected to gain or lose seats in next year's reapportionment. 
Currently, Democrats control 69 state legislative chambers, and Republicans -- 
who have been frustrated in attempts to translate their national success into 
local gains over the past decade -- just 29, six fewer than in 1980.

FORMER MAYOR BARRY LOSES BID FOR AT-LARGE D.C. COUNCIL SEAT

<P>
Former Washington Mayor Marion Barry, who is appealing a six-month prison 
sentence and $5,000 fine for a drug possession conviction, lost his bid to 
secure an at-large seat on the District of Columbia City Council Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Barry was receiving 19% of the vote, badly trailing two rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Linda Cropp had about 39% and incumbent Hilda Mason of the local 
Statehood party was collecting about 30%. 
</P>
<P>
"Although the election didn't go our way, our campaign has been successful," he 
said in a concession speech. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Democrat Sharon Pratt Dixon, who promised to sweep out all remnants 
of the Barry Administration, defeated Republican Maurice T. Turner, the city's 
former police chief, to become the new mayor. Dixon becomes the first black 
woman mayor of a major U.S. city. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, the Rev. Jesse Jackson was elected as one of the district's two 
"shadow" senators, non-voting positions designed to press the district's 
efforts to become a state. 
</P>
<P>
Barry's defeat may end his roller-coaster political career. The former civil 
rights activist rose from a dashiki-wearing street organizer in the 1960s to 
the well-tailored mayor of the nation's capital during the 1980s. But last 
January, Barry was tried on drug charges. The trial -- which polarized the city 
and led several black leaders across the nation to accuse the federal 
government of a vendetta against elected black officials -- ended with a hung 
jury on several counts and a conviction on one misdemeanor charge.

SAME EXIT POLL USED BY ALL TV NETWORKS 
</P>

<P>
Something was different about those instant network projections of who won and 
who lost Tuesday's elections. 
</P>
<P>
To save money, NBC, ABC, CBS and CNN for the first time pooled their resources 
for a single exit poll. In exit polls, the basis for network projections, 
voters in selected precincts are interviewed as they leave the polling place 
and are asked how they voted and why. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the networks used a commercial polling operation, VRS or Voter 
Research and Surveys, run by former CBS polling director Warren Mitofsky. VRS 
conducted about 60,000 separate interviews in 49 states, including nearly 
10,000 for a separate poll designed to measure what Americans felt about such 
issues as the Persian Gulf and abortion, aside from specific campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the networks, nearly 60 local TV, newspaper and radio news 
organizations bought local results from the poll, making VRS an influential 
source of political data. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference this year is that all the competition is going to be done on 
interpretation and presentation. All the data is the same," VRS spokeswoman 
Susan Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
Although that might still leave room for competition as to when a network was 
willing to project a winner, some network executives said that, with only one 
poll, they intended to be more cautious about the results. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, I wish there were others out there doing this poll," said one 
network polling executive privately. As a result, this pollster said, "we want 
to be careful with what we have" when it comes to making projections. 
</P>
<P>
Polling professionals warned that using a single source could increase the 
possibility of mistakes. In the past, network pollsters would informally 
compare data throughout the evening, which was a check on errors. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, however, it came down to economics. Amid declining network ratings, 
the change will save each network "multimillions," said Mary Klette, who 
directs polling for NBC News. In 1986, the previous midterm election, for 
instance, NBC alone had to conduct 36,440 interviews for its own exit poll.

IN KEY RACES, BUSH HAD LITTLE OR NO IMPACT; 
</P>
<P>
WHITE HOUSE: AN AIDE SAYS GOP LOSS OF THE TEXAS GOVERNOR'S RACE WAS 'VERY HARD 
ON THE PRESIDENT.' BUSH ALSO STUMPED HARD IN FLORIDA TO NO AVAIL. 
</P>

<P>
For politicians, sometimes it is the personal losses that count most. Ann 
Richards, for example. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush spent the last three days of the 1990 election season in Texas 
trying to defeat the woman who ridiculed him in 1988 as "poor George . . . born 
with a silver foot in his mouth." He lost. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also spent three days in Florida, stumping for the Republican candidate 
for governor, Bob Martinez, whose campaign chairman was Bush's son, Jeb. He 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
And at his summer home in Kennebunkport, Me., Bush held a fund-raiser to boost 
the local Republican congressional candidate, David Emery. He lost. 
</P>
<P>
It could have been worse, of course. Bush, a former Republican Party chairman, 
spent weeks on the campaign trail over the last year helping his party's 
nominees. And many won. Republicans held their losses in the House to a minimum 
and won several close Senate contests. Moreover, Republican candidates 
prevailed in several important gubernatorial contests. 
</P>
<P>
But in most of the cases where GOP candidates won, even the White House was not 
claiming that Bush made the difference. 
</P>
<P>
In many states, most notably California, candidates such as Sen. Pete Wilson 
welcomed Bush's aid in raising money, but Administration officials conceded 
early on that Bush would have a minimal political impact on the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Bush and his advisers had hoped the President could make a 
personal difference in a few states, particularly his adopted home of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Losing the Texas governor's race was "very rough on the President," said one 
aide as Bush sat with friends, watching election returns on television in the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
Not so long ago, the President, who got his political start in Texas, and his 
political advisers "were looking for a real break (all the way) down the 
ticket" in the Lone Star State, the aide said. White House strategists had 
hoped Bush's personal popularity would help the party not only capture the 
Statehouse but also several other statewide offices and a couple of 
congressional seats currently held by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
The Republicans had hoped for a similar boost in Florida, one of Bush's 
strongest states and the one in which Jeb, the only one of Bush's sons to 
launch a political career, has major ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent weeks, rising concern about the economy and declining faith in 
Bush's leadership weakened the President's ability to help his party's 
nominees. In several states, in fact, Republican candidates privately told Bush 
to stay away, then embarrassed the White House by leaking that information to 
the press. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, Administration aides were taking some pleasure in noting that 
many of the Republicans who had shunned Bush did no better than the ones who 
had welcomed him. 
</P>
<P>
In Illinois, for example, Republican Jim Edgar was trailing Democrat Neil F. 
Hartigan in their tight race for the Statehouse. Edgar had made a point this 
past weekend of asking Bush not to come to Illinois. And in Oregon, Republican 
Dave Frohnmayer, who had invited Bush to campaign for him early in the year but 
shunned the White House this fall, appeared to have lost his gubernatorial race 
to Democrat Barbara Roberts anyway. 
</P>
<P>
But to round out a bad night for the White House, returns finally came in from 
Hawaii, where Bush had campaigned for Rep. Patricia Saiki to unseat Democratic 
Sen. Daniel K. Akaka. She lost.

STATE-BY-STATE REPORTS OF THE KEY RACES AND ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following are edition-time results of state elections across the country 
Tuesday. The results have been compiled from Associated Press, United Press 
International, Reuters and the Los Angeles Times-Washington Post News Service: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ALABAMA 
</P>
<P>
MONTGOMERY -- Democratic Sen. Howell Heflin, 69, the chairman of the Senate 
Ethics Committee, rolled over Republican challenger Bill Cabaniss to win a 
third term. 
</P>
<P>
With 86% of the precincts reporting, Heflin had 61% of the votes to Cabaniss' 
39%. 
</P>
<P>
In the governor's race, incumbent GOP Guy Hunt, a little-known preacher and 
farmer in 1986 when he won a historic landslide over a divided Democratic 
Party, narrowly defeated Democrat Paul Hubbert, the executive secretary of the 
Alabama Education Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt was winning with 51% of the vote to Hubbert's 49%. He was seeking to 
become the only person other than George C. Wallace to win two successive 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats held on to five of the seven open House seats, with Republicans 
winning two. Five of the seats were contested. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ALASKA 
</P>
<P>
JUNEAU -- Incumbent Republican Ted Stevens won his fifth election to the 
Senate, defeating Democrat Michael Beasley, a union worker. 
</P>
<P>
In the race for governor, former Gov. and Interior Secretary Walter J. Hickel, 
running as an independent, had a slight lead over Democrat Tony Knowles, the 
former mayor of Anchorage. Republican Arliss Sturgulewski, also of Anchorage, 
was trailing by a considerable margin. 
</P>
<P>
Don Young, the incumbent Republican, was far in front in his effort to keep the 
state's lone seat in the House. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ARIZONA 
</P>
<P>
TUCSON -- Terry Goddard was running ahead of Republican real estate developer 
Fife Symington in a race for the state's open governorship. 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Morris K. Udall, who has been in the House since 1961, won what he 
says will be his last term in Congress. Udall has Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbents won the four other House races, leaving the delegation with three 
Republicans and two Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ARKANSAS 
</P>
<P>
LITTLE ROCK -- Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton defeated Republican challenger 
Sheffield Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who ran for President in 1988, appeared to rule out a 1992 
presidential bid when he pledged during his reelection campaign to serve out 
his fifth, non-consecutive term as governor. 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, Democratic incumbent David Pryor, 56, had no opponent. 
</P>
<P>
In House races, former Democrat Rep. Ray Thornton defeated his Republican 
opponent, state Rep. Jim Keet, to fill the open 2nd District seat. Three 
incumbents -- two Democrats and a Republican -- held onto their congressional 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COLORADO 
</P>
<P>
DENVER -- Gov. Roy Romer waltzed to a second term, while Republican Rep. Hank 
Brown was on his way to capturing a Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 50, was leading Democrat Josie Heath, 53, a former Boulder County 
commissioner, by 54% to 46%. The winner succeeds Republican Sen. Bill 
Armstrong, who is retiring. 
</P>
<P>
Romer, 62, who first won office in 1986, faced challenger John Andrews, an 
outside-the-mainstream Republican. Romer had 68% of the vote to Andrews' 32%. 
</P>
<P>
In congressional races, five incumbents -- three Democrats and two Republicans 
-- were reelected. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CONNECTICUT 
</P>
<P>
HARTFORD -- Independent Lowell P. Weicker Jr. defeated Republican John G. 
Rowland and Democrat Bruce A. Morrison to become the state's first independent 
governor since 1856. 
</P>
<P>
The 59-year-old former Republican senator was garnering 41% of the votes. 
Rowland, 33, a three-term Republican congressman from blue-collar Waterbury, 
was running second with 37% and Morrison, 46, a four-term Democratic 
congressman from Hamden, tallied 21%. Democratic Gov. William O'Neill is 
retiring. 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut's sagging economy dominated the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative Republican Gary A. Franks became the first black elected to the 
House since 1935, as former Rep. Toby Moffett fell to a carpetbagger label for 
moving into the 5th District earlier this year. Connecticut has not elected a 
black Republican to the House since before the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats and Republicans now hold three seats each in Connecticut's 
congressional delegation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DELAWARE 
</P>
<P>
DOVER -- Democratic Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., 47, chairman of the Senate 
Judiciary Committee, easily won reelection over Republican state Atty. Gen. M. 
Jane Brady, 39. 
</P>
<P>
With 92% of the vote tallied, Biden had received 103,766 votes, or 63%, to 
Brady's 59,997, or 37%. The incumbent had endured two life-threatening 
operations in 1988 to repair brain aneurysms. 
</P>
<P>
Delaware had one at-large House race, pitting incumbent Democrat Rep. Thomas R. 
Carper, 43, against Republican Ralph O. Williams, 55. With 95% of the vote 
tallied, Carper was far ahead with 110,228 votes, or 67%, to Williams' 54,974, 
or 33%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FLORIDA 
</P>
<P>
TALLAHASSEE -- Former Sen. Lawton Chiles, bouncing back from mental illness 
with an anti-depression drug, regained the Florida governor's seat for the 
Democrats in an upset over Republican incumbent Bob Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
Chiles was leading Martinez 55% to 45%, and Martinez conceded the race. 
</P>
<P>
Chiles, 60, citing burnout, did not seek reelection to the Senate in 1988 after 
serving three terms. He later acknowledged that he was being treated for 
depression with the prescription drug Prozac. 
</P>
<P>
The National Abortion Rights Action League said the voters had repudiated 
Martinez, 55, who was only the second Republican governor in Florida since 
Reconstruction, for his high-profile campaign against abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The Martinez loss was a setback for President Bush, who made three campaign 
visits to the state in an effort to help his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
Voters also appeared to be granting overwhelming approval to a number of ballot 
initiatives, including a three-day waiting period on handgun purchases. 
</P>
<P>
In races for House seats, Democrat Douglas (Pete) Peterson upset U.S. Rep. 
James W. (Bill) Grant, a recent convert to the GOP who was targeted by the 
Democratic Party for defeat in north Florida's 2nd District. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GEORGIA 
</P>
<P>
ATLANTA -- Democrat Zell Miller, Georgia's lieutenant governor for 16 years, 
rode voter enthusiasm over a state lottery to a victory in the governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
With 85% of precincts reporting, Miller led 54% to 43% for Republican Johnny 
Isakson, 45, a prosperous Atlanta real estate company executive and state 
legislator for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
The state's 10 members of the U.S. House, nine Democrats and a Republican, all 
faced opposition. In the 4th District, with 83% of precincts reporting, Ben 
Jones, a freshman Democrat who played "Cooter" on "The Dukes of Hazzard," was 
leading with 54% of the vote over Republican John Linder, 46, who had 46%. 
</P>
<P>
In a neck-and-neck race in the 6th District with 96% of precincts reporting, 
incumbent Republican Newt Gingrich, 47, had 74,145 votes to challenger David 
Worley's 73,065. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn, 52, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, ran 
unopposed for his fourth six-year term. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HAWAII 
</P>
<P>
HONOLULU -- Sen. Daniel Akaka beat back a strong challenge from Rep. Patricia 
Saiki, denying Republicans a longed-for chance to grab a seat in this heavily 
Democratic state. 
</P>
<P>
With 72% of the precincts reporting, Akaka, 66, had 54% of the vote while 
Saiki, 61, garnered 45%. 
</P>
<P>
Akaka had been appointed earlier this year to fill the seat of the late Sen. 
Spark Matsunaga and will serve the four years remaining in that term. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IDAHO 
</P>
<P>
BOISE -- Democratic Gov. Cecil D. Andrus earned an unprecedented fourth 
four-year term, just seven months after he was targeted for defeat by outraged 
anti-abortion forces. 
</P>
<P>
Andrus, who interrupted his tenure as governor to serve as President Jimmy 
Carter's interior secretary, was never really tested in the campaign by Roger 
Fairchild, a former state Senate Republican floor leader. 
</P>
<P>
He was leading 65% to 35%. 
</P>
<P>
Idaho voters maintained their ticket-splitting tradition, reelecting five-term 
Republican Rep. Larry E. Craig, 45, who defeated Democratic state Sen. Ron J. 
Twilegar, 47, for the seat of retiring GOP Sen. James A. McClure. Craig was 
leading 66% to 34%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ILLINOIS 
</P>
<P>
CHICAGO -- Republican Jim Edgar narrowly defeated Democrat Neil F. Hartigan in 
Illinois' first wide-open governor's race in more than a decade -- a race that 
reversed the usual political wisdom on taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Voters sent Democratic Sen. Paul Simon back to Washington, turning a deaf ear 
to GOP Rep. Lynn Martin's anti-tax message and late call for limiting the terms 
of lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Simon was winning 66% of the vote to Martin's 34%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INDIANA 
</P>
<P>
INDIANAPOLIS -- Dan Coats, appointed to the Senate when Dan Quayle was elected 
vice president in 1988, won the race to serve the final two years of the term 
Quayle won in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Coats, who also followed Quayle to the House when the vice president moved to 
the Senate in 1980, defeated state Rep. Baron Hill in a tight contest. He must 
run for reelection in two years. 
</P>
<P>
Seven Democrats and two Republicans were reelected to the House. GOP incumbent 
John Hiler was locked in a tight race in the other contest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IOWA 
</P>
<P>
DES MOINES -- Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin bucked a spirited challenge from 
Republican Rep. Tom Tauke to win a second term after a two-year, $11-million 
campaign that was the most expensive political race in Iowa history. 
</P>
<P>
Harkin was winning with 54% of the vote to 46% for Tauke. 
</P>
<P>
Harkin, 50, had been a target for the GOP since he ousted Republican Sen. Roger 
Jepsen in 1984 and emerged as a persistent and vocal Administration critic. 
Tauke, 40, carved out a reputation as a moderate Republican who represented a 
heavily Democratic district in Congress for a dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
Both entered the contest saying voters were tired of negative politics and 
pledging to bring issues back to the campaign trail. But the campaign was 
marked with a barrage of negative TV commercials as the campaign wound down. 
</P>
<P>
Harkin hammered at Tauke's staunch anti-abortion stand and worked hard to tie 
him to GOP policies Harkin said favored the wealthy and powerful. 
</P>
<P>
Tauke portrayed Harkin as part of "the tax-and-spend crowd" in Washington and 
got three campaign visits from President Bush to help make that point. 
</P>
<P>
In the governor's race, two-term Gov. Terry E. Branstad, 43, defeated 
Democratic House Speaker Don Avenson, 46. 
</P>
<P>
Branstad was ahead with 60% of the vote, while Avenson had 40%. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional incumbents held on to five of six open seats. The GOP candidate 
was leading in the only open race. Three incumbents were uncontested. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
KANSAS 
</P>
<P>
TOPEKA -- Republican Gov. Mike Hayden, 46, blamed for large property tax 
increases, was turned out of office after a single term, losing to Democratic 
state Treasurer Joan Finney, 65, who becomes the state's first woman governor. 
</P>
<P>
Finney was leading Hayden 54% to 46%. He had been narrowly renominated in the 
primary by voters who were angered by a property tax overhaul that sent tax 
bills soaring. 
</P>
<P>
GOP U.S. Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum, 58, the daughter of the late Gov. Alf 
Landon, easily defeated her Democratic challenger, Dick Williams, 56, a college 
teacher. Kassebaum was winning 73% of the votes. 
</P>
<P>
Four incumbent U.S. House members, two Republicans and two Democrats, were all 
comfortably ahead. 
</P>
<P>
In the 5th District, Republican Dick Nichols, 64, was leading former Democratic 
state Rep. George Wingert, 59, by 59% to 41%, thus maintaining the 3-2 GOP 
advantage in the state's U.S. House delegation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
KENTUCKY 
</P>
<P>
LOUISVILLE -- Republican Mitch McConnell, 48, defeated Democrat Harvey I. 
Sloane, the former mayor of Louisville, to win a second term in the U.S. 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Heading into the election, Sloane did not appear to have benefited much from 
voter anger against Congress, and McConnell was favored to win a second term. 
McConnell received 53% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Voters retained every incumbent congressman, returning four Democrats and three 
Republicans to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LOUISIANA 
</P>
<P>
BATON ROUGE -- Voters in New Orleans were poised to send a black Democrat to 
Washington from the last majority black congressional district in the nation 
still represented by a white. 
</P>
<P>
In a tight contest, voters in that state's unusual electoral runoff system were 
choosing between two black Democratic candidates: state Sen. William Jefferson 
and Marc Morial, son of the late Mayor Ernest (Dutch) Morial. The seat is being 
vacated by the retirement of Democratic Rep. Lindy Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
With 85% of the vote tallied, Jefferson led Morial by about 2,500 votes, 51% to 
49%. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbents in seven other House districts were assured of reelection, as was 
Sen. J. Bennett Johnson, who defeated Republican David Duke during the state's 
Oct. 6 open primary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MAINE 
</P>
<P>
AUGUSTA -- Republican Gov. John R. McKernan was is a neck-and-neck battle with 
his Democratic predecessor, U.S. Rep. Joseph E. Brennan, in the culmination of 
a contentious race. 
</P>
<P>
With 49% of precincts reporting, McKernan had 46% of the votes to Brennan's 
45%. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Republican U.S. Sen. William S. Cohen, 50, won a third term in a 
race against Democrat Neil Rolde. 
</P>
<P>
No change was expected in the party breakdown of the state's House delegation, 
although the two races were tighter than expected. 
</P>
<P>
Voters also were approving a referendum plan to repeal Maine's "blue laws," 
allowing large stores and supermarkets to do business on Sundays throughout the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MARYLAND 
</P>
<P>
BALTIMORE -- Five-term Rep. Roy Dyson was ousted from office, losing to Wayne 
T. Gilchrest, a Republican schoolteacher who has never held public office. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the Armed Services Committee, Dyson, 41, had barely survived a 
challenge by Gilchrest, 44, in 1988 when Dyson was hampered by 
conflict-of-interest accusations involving defense contractor campaign money. 
This year, it was disclosed that Dyson had escaped service in the Vietnam War 
by claiming conscientious objector status -- in contrast to his hawkish defense 
views. 
</P>
<P>
With was winning 57% of the vote to 43% for Dyson. 
</P>
<P>
In the governor's race, Democrat William Donald Schaefer held on to his job in 
his battle with William and Lois Shepard, the GOP husband-and-wife team who ran 
for governor and lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
With 93% of precincts reporting, Schaefer had 61% of the votes to 39% for 
Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
The seven other incumbent members of Congress -- five Democrats and two 
Republicans -- all won reelection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MASSACHUSETTS 
</P>
<P>
BOSTON -- In a battle of political newcomers, Republican William F. Weld upset 
Democrat John R. Silber in the race to succeed Michael S. Dukakis as governor. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Weld, a former U.S. attorney, nor Silber, the outspoken president of 
Boston University, had been expected to get past their primaries, but both 
pulled stunning upsets as voters took out their frustrations on party regulars. 
</P>
<P>
Voters decisively rejected Question 3, which would have reduced taxes by $2.6 
billion in fiscal 1992. The measure would have been the nation's largest 
voter-initiated state tax cut in history. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Democrat John Kerry, 46, won his second Senate term, and eight of the 
state's 10 Democratic congressmen -- including Barney Frank, who was 
reprimanded by his colleagues in July for improperly using his office to help a 
male prostitute -- and its lone Republican were returned to Capitol Hill. 
Democratic incumbents were leading in the other two races. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MICHIGAN 
</P>
<P>
LANSING -- Republican John Engler, who hit Gov. James J. Blanchard hard on 
cutting property taxes, was trailing the two-term incumbent by about 19,000 
votes. The lead seesawed throughout the night. 
</P>
<P>
Engler had promised to cut property taxes by 20%. In the final days of the 
race, Engler handed out 5,000 nickels as he campaigned. "That's how much Jim 
Blanchard wants to cut your property taxes each week. I think it's an insult," 
Engler said. 
</P>
<P>
Blanchard also received negative publicity over dropping Lt. Gov. Martha 
Griffiths as his running mate in favor of a younger woman. 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate race, Republican Bill Schuette tried to play up his longstanding 
opposition to taxes -- he has never voted for a tax increase during his six 
years in the House -- but he lost to Sen. Carl Levin, 57% to 43%. 
</P>
<P>
Levin had visited U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf in early September, beaming 
photo footage back home from the deck of the Wisconsin. Schuette reminded 
voters in a TV ad filmed in front of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial that Levin 
voted against reactivating the battleship in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In the House races, all 10 Democratic and five Republican incumbents were 
reelected. In the two open contests, the GOP won one race and was leading in 
the second. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MINNESOTA 
</P>
<P>
ST. PAUL -- Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party Gov. Rudy Perpich, seeking an 
unprecedented fourth term, was locked in a tight race with Republican state 
auditor Arne Carlson despite turmoil and scandal that engulfed the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
Carlson finished second in the GOP primary, but he became his party's 
gubernatorial candidate a week ago to replace Jon Grunseth, who withdrew amid 
allegations by two women who said in sworn statements that when they were 13 
and 14 years old, Grunseth tried to get them to take off their bathing suits to 
join him for a nude swim. 
</P>
<P>
Perpich had 49% of the vote to Carlson's 51%. 
</P>
<P>
Election officials predicted that results could be delayed several hours 
because a switch in GOP gubernatorial candidates forced the printing of 
supplemental ballots, which were counted by hand. 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate race, it was a down-to-the-wire contest, with Republican 
incumbent Rudy Boschwitz trading leads all evening with liberal Democrat Paul 
Wellstone, a college professor. 
</P>
<P>
Wellstone had 51% of the vote while Boschwitz had 49%. 
</P>
<P>
Five Minnesota Democratic congressmen and two Republican House members were 
seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MISSISSIPPI 
</P>
<P>
JACKSON -- Democratic incumbents held onto all five House seats in Mississippi, 
one running unopposed and the four others turning back Republican challengers 
by wide margins. 
</P>
<P>
In the 5th Congressional District, Sheila Smith, wife of the late GOP Rep. 
Larkin Smith who died last year in a plane crash, failed in her bid for her 
husband's former seat, held by Democrat Gene Taylor. With 98% of precincts 
reporting, Taylor had 81% of the vote to Smith's 19%. 
</P>
<P>
No Democrat was willing to take on Republican Sen. Thad Cochran, 52, who was 
reelected to a third term without opposition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MISSOURI 
</P>
<P>
JEFFERSON CITY -- Republican Rep. Jack Buechner was on the verge of being upset 
by Democrat Joan Kelly Horn in the 2nd District race, but incumbents of both 
parties were victorious in the eight other House races. Horn was winning with 
51% of the votes that had been counted in the western St. Louis County 
district. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MONTANA 
</P>
<P>
HELENA -- Democratic Sen. Max Baucus, 48, dashed Republican hopes of an upset, 
gaining a third term over GOP challenger Lt. Gov. Allen C. Kolstad. 
</P>
<P>
State voters were rejecting Constitutional Amendment 55, which would eliminate 
state income, property and sales taxes, as well as license fees and 
registration. The funding was to be generated instead by a 1% charge on every 
$1 business transaction. 
</P>
<P>
In the House races, Republican Rep. Ron Marlenee defeated Democrat Don Burris, 
and Democratic Rep. Pat Williams beat his Republican opponent, Brad Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEVADA 
</P>
<P>
CARSON CITY -- Acting Gov. Robert J. Miller was elected to a full term, beating 
Republican challenger Jim Gallaway. 
</P>
<P>
Miller was winning with 64% of the vote to businessman Gallaway's 33%. The 
remaining votes went to other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
In congressional races, Democratic Rep. James Bilbray, 52, defeated publisher 
Bob Dickinson, 57, in the 1st District race. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2nd District, Rep. Barbara F. Vucanovich beat state Assemblywoman Jane 
Wisdom. Wisdom had moved to the district to challenge the four-term Republican. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEW HAMPSHIRE 
</P>
<P>
CONCORD -- Republican Rep. Robert C. Smith, 49, easily won the U.S. Senate seat 
being abandoned by Gordon J. Humphrey, who left Congress to run for the state 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's Democratic opponent, John A. Durkin, 54, had based his campaign on 
charges that Smith was beholden to special interest groups that poured more 
than $500,000 into his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Smith was winning 67% of the votes to Durkin's 33%. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Gov. Judd Gregg easily won a second two-year term, fending off 
Democrat Joe Grandmaison's charges he was incompetent to lead the state out of 
its economic doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg had 65% of the vote to 35% for Grandmaison. 
</P>
<P>
In congressional races, Republican Rep. Chuck Douglas failed in his bid for a 
second term, losing to Democrat Dick Swett, an architect. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEW JERSEY 
</P>
<P>
TRENTON -- Sen. Bill Bradley, 47, a Democrat often mentioned as a presidential 
contender, scratched out a narrow victory over his relatively unknown 
Republican challenger, Christine Todd Whitman. 
</P>
<P>
With 95% of precincts reporting, Bradley had 52% of the vote to 48% for 
Whitman, a former president of the state Board of Public Utilities. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans did their best to tar Bradley and his fellow Democrats with the 
brush of Gov. James J. Florio's unpopular tax increases. Florio was not on the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
There were two open congressional seats among the state's total of 14, but 
neither contested race was expected to alter the political balance of the 
delegation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEW MEXICO 
</P>
<P>
ALBUQUERQUE -- Former two-time New Mexico Gov. Bruce King defeated Republican 
Frank Bond to regain the governor's seat. 
</P>
<P>
With 79% of the precincts reporting, King had 54% of the vote to Bond's 46%. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gives King and the party the power to dominate next year's 
reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
Popular incumbent Republican Pete V. Domenici, 58, won a lopsided U.S. Senate 
race over Democratic challenger Tom Benavides, an Albuquerque state senator. 
Domenici was getting 72% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
King and Bond were vying to succeed Republican Garrey E. Carruthers, who was 
prohibited by law from seeking reelection. However, a change in the state 
Constitution will allow the winner to seek reelection in four years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
<P>
NEW YORK -- Gov. Mario M. Cuomo breezed to a third term over splintered 
Republican opposition, maintaining his standing as a leader of the Democratic 
Party and potential presidential candidate for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Cuomo's opposition included millionaire economist Pierre Rinfret, the 
Republican challenger who was an unknown in New York politics six months ago, 
and Conservative Party nominee Herbert London. 
</P>
<P>
With 92% of precincts reporting, Cuomo had 53% of the vote to 21% for Rinfret 
and 20% for London. 
</P>
<P>
In the final two months of the campaign, the outspoken, underfunded Rinfret 
spent almost as much time bashing prominent Republicans as he did attacking 
Democrat Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
Of New York's 34 congressional members, 21 Democrats and 13 Republicans, five 
ran unopposed and the others were leading with most precincts reporting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NORTH CAROLINA 
</P>
<P>
RALEIGH -- Three-term Republican Sen. Jesse Helms defeated Democratic 
challenger Harvey Gantt as conflict erupted over broken voting machines and 
court orders that extended voting hours. 
</P>
<P>
Helms, 69, a leading spokesman for the American right, argued that government 
is too large and intrusive and needs to be cut back. He sounded his familiar 
themes, attacking affirmative action programs as unfair to whites and decrying 
pornography and homosexuality as signs of declining moral values. 
</P>
<P>
Gantt, 47, an architect who served two terms as the first black mayor of 
Charlotte, campaigned as an unabashed liberal. His attempt to unseat Helms was 
the most-closely watched, and most expensive, national race. 
</P>
<P>
The national attention for the Senate race overshadowed the state's House 
races, where 10 of 11 incumbents were reelected. 
</P>
<P>
In the 11th District, incumbent Democratic Rep. James McClure Clarke was 
trailing Republican Charles H. Taylor with 81% of the vote tallied. Taylor, who 
had come within 1,529 votes of unseating Clarke in 1988, led with 51% of the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NORTH DAKOTA 
</P>
<P>
BISMARCK -- Five-term Democratic Rep. Byron L. Dorgan, 48, won reealection 
handily over Republican challenger Edward T. Schafer, 44. 
</P>
<P>
With 84% of the vote tallied, Dorgan had 123,780 votes or 66%, to Schafer's 
65,160, or 34%. 
</P>
<P>
Dorgan turned around perceived negatives and focused on the need to improve 
rural health care, expand trade opportunities and assure the survival of the 
family farm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OHIO 
</P>
<P>
COLUMBUS -- Former Cleveland Mayor George V. Voinovich swept to victory over 
Democrat Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr., regaining control of the governor's office 
for the Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Voinovich was winning 55% of the vote compared to 45% for Celebrezze, the 
state's attorney general. Celebrezze was a strong opponent of abortion until he 
switched positions in December, drawing the enmity of his former allies and 
earning a flip-flopper's tag that he never overcame. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Gov. Richard Celeste was prevented by law from seeking a third 
consecutive term. 
</P>
<P>
In House races, each party captured 10 seats, with one undecided. Previously, 
the Democrats held an 11-10 edge. 
</P>
<P>
Voters also were deciding whether to change the state Constitution to permit 
casino gambling. At issue was whether residents of Lorain should be permitted 
to decide in a later election whether to allow construction of a casino. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OKLAHOMA 
</P>
<P>
OKLAHOMA CITY -- Businessman David Walters recaptured the governor's mansion 
for Oklahoma Democrats, winning a bitter and expensive campaign against 
Republican Bill Price, a former federal prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
Walters, 38, outspent Price, 42, and independent Thomas Ledgerwood in his bid 
to succeed Republican Henry Bellmon, who is retiring. Bellmon had defeated 
Walters in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Sen. David L. Boren, 49, chairman of the Senate Intelligence 
Committee, breezed to a third term, winning over Republican Stephen Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma Democrats were expected to maintain their 4-2 edge in congressional 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OREGON 
</P>
<P>
PORTLAND -- Sen. Mark O. Hatfield was leading in his battle for a fifth term 
against a strong challenge from Democrat Harry Lonsdale, a businessman who 
campaigned as a political outsider. 
</P>
<P>
But Republican Rep. Denny Smith, tarnished by links to the savings and loan 
scandal, lost his bid for a sixth term from the state's 5th District, falling 
to Democrat Mike Kopetski in a rematch of their race two years ago. Incumbents 
won the state's other House races. 
</P>
<P>
In the race for governor, Democratic Secretary of State Barbara Roberts was 
expected to defeat Republican Atty. Gen. Dave Frohnmayer, according to exit 
polls. Incumbent Gov. Neil Goldschmidt, a Democrat, did not seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Voters also faced 11 statewide ballot issues. Polls showed voters closely 
divided on a measure that would shut down the state's only nuclear power plant, 
the Trojan plant in northwestern Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PENNSYLVANIA 
</P>
<P>
PHILADELPHIA -- Democratic Gov. Robert P. Casey, who signed tough abortion 
controls and avoided tax increases in his first term, breezed to a second term, 
defeating Republican Barbara Hafer. 
</P>
<P>
Casey, 58, put $4 million in television commercials on the air beginning Sept. 
19 while Hafer had to settle for about $275,000 worth of ads in the last two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
With 91% of precincts reporting, Casey had 68% of the votes to 32% for Hafer, a 
former public health nurse and county commissioner from the Pittsburgh area. 
</P>
<P>
Hafer favored abortion rights and counted on pro-choice advocates to help with 
the race. But Casey never mentioned abortion unless asked, and it never caught 
on as an issue. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats held a 12-11 edge in the congressional delegation. Six incumbents 
were unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RHODE ISLAND 
</P>
<P>
PROVIDENCE -- Republican Gov. Edward DiPrete succumbed to the region's economic 
woes and Democrat Bruce G. Sundlun. 
</P>
<P>
With most precincts in the state reporting, Sundlun had 75% of the vote to 
DiPrete's 25%. 
</P>
<P>
DiPrete, first elected in 1984, enjoyed huge popularity during New England's 
technology-driven boom years, but he lost support when the bottom fell out of 
the state's economy in the past couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Claiborne Pell, 71, a Democrat, won a sixth term after a quixotic 
challenge by Rep. Claudine Schneider. Pell heads the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider, a liberal Republican who often broke with the Reagan and Bush 
administrations during her 10 years in Washington, ended with ads saying that 
she and Pell were alike -- but it was time for a change. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SOUTH CAROLINA 
</P>
<P>
COLUMBIA -- Republican Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. easily defeated Democrat 
Theo Mitchell, who had sought to become South Carolina's first black governor. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell was leading with 71% of the votes while Mitchell had 29%. 
</P>
<P>
Republican U.S. Sen. Strom Thurmond, 87, turned back token opposition from 
Democrat Robert Cunningham, 70, an ex-CIA agent who apparently made no effort 
to campaign. Thurmond, the nation's oldest and longest-serving member of 
Congress, won a seventh term. 
</P>
<P>
Thurmond was winning with 67% of the vote to Cunningham's 33%. 
</P>
<P>
South Carolina's U.S. House delegation, with four Democrats and two 
Republicans, all sought reelection. Four had opposition but none of the 
challengers appeared to pose a threat to the incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SOUTH DAKOTA 
</P>
<P>
PIERRE -- Voters chose incumbents in all three major statewide races. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Larry Pressler topped challenger Ted Muenster as he sought his third 
term in the Senate. Democrat Tim Johnson defeated former state Sen. Don 
Frankenfeld in the race for the state's only House seat. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Gov. George S. Mickelson won reelection by defeating Democratic 
rival Bob Samuelson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TENNESSEE 
</P>
<P>
NASHVILLE -- Democratic Gov. Ned McWherter and U.S. Sen. Al Gore buried weak 
Republican opposition in bids for second terms. 
</P>
<P>
Nine incumbent congressmen also were returned to office. 
</P>
<P>
McWherter beat Republican Dwight Henry, a freshman state legislator. Gore, who 
was a 1988 presidential hopeful, outdistanced Republican William R. Hawkins, 
41, a Knoxville economist and free-lance writer who conducted almost no 
campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
McWherter had 62% of the vote to 38% for Henry. Gore, 42, had 70% to Hawkins' 
30%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TEXAS 
</P>
<P>
AUSTIN -- Democrat Ann Richards pulled off a stunning upset to grab the Texas 
governorship away from the Republicans on Tuesday, defeating gaffe-prone 
millionaire oilman Clayton Williams after a contest that set records for 
spending and mudslinging. 
</P>
<P>
Outspent by nearly a 2-1 margin in a campaign that cost more than $30 million, 
Richards, 57, nonetheless closed the gap with Williams, 58, in the campaign's 
final days, helped by his admission that he had paid no taxes in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Richards had 52% of the vote to 48% for Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Texas voters gave Republican Phil Gramm a second term in the U.S. Senate. 
Gramm, 48, is best-known for his co-authorship of the Gramm-Rudmann legislation 
that threatens automatic budget cuts if Congress fails to meet specified 
deficit-reduction targets. Gramm was winning with 61% of the vote to 39% for 
his Democratic opponent, state Sen. Hugh Parmer, 51, of Ft. Worth. 
</P>
<P>
With Democrats holding 19 of the state's 27 seats in the U.S. House, the GOP 
concentrated on unseating Democratic Rep. Bill Sarpalius, 42, of Amarillo. 
However, with 81% of precincts reporting, Sarpalius held a lead of 63,936 votes 
to 46,146 for state Rep. Dick Waterfield, 51. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UTAH 
</P>
<P>
SALT LAKE CITY -- Democrats won two of three House seats in Utah, normally a 
GOP stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Bill Orton defeated Republican Karl Snow in the race for the 3rd 
District seat vacated by GOP Rep. Howard Nielson. Republican incumbent James 
Hansen fended off challenger Kenley Brunsdale to hold his 1st District seat, 
and Democratic incumbent Wayne Owens held his 2nd District seat against 
Genevieve Atwood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
VERMONT 
</P>
<P>
MONTPELIER -- Bernard Sanders became the first socialist elected to the House 
in more than four decades, winning a rematch with incumbent Republican Rep. 
Peter Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Former Republican Gov. Richard A. Snelling won a return to the job he held for 
four terms, defeating former Democratic state Sen. Peter Welch and two other 
candidates. Incumbent Gov. Madeleine Kunin, a Democrat, did not run. 
</P>
<P>
Snelling had decided to run when it still appeared that Kunin would seek 
reelection. He said he entered the race because he felt the state's fiscal 
affairs were a mess. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
VIRGINIA 
</P>
<P>
RICHMOND -- Republican U.S. Sen. John W. Warner, 63, won reelection to a third 
term in a bid that was virtually unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
His only challenger was independent Nancy Spannaus, an associate of fringe 
political figure Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. 
</P>
<P>
With 97% of the precincts reporting, Warner had 82% of the vote to 18% for 
Spannaus. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 10 House races, Democrat James P. Moran, the mayor of Alexandria, won 
a raucous campaign to turn Rep. Stanford E. Parris out of his House seat after 
six terms from the 8th District. Moran had accused Parris of being more 
interested in the governorship than in serving his constituents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
<P>
OLYMPIA -- By 3-to-1, voters were soundly rejecting Measure 547, or "Little 
Green," a proposal to protect open space, force communities to plan for growth 
and put some distance between growth issues and elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic incumbent Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, 58, who has been on the GOP's hit 
list since her 618-vote victory in 1988 and criticized for her liberal stands 
on taxes and the environment, faced off against Republican challenger Bob 
Williams, 48, a former state legislator and evangelical Christian. No winner 
had been declared in that congressional race or three others. 
</P>
<P>
Four incumbents -- one Republican and three Democrats -- won reelection to the 
House in other contests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WEST VIRGINIA 
</P>
<P>
CHARLESTON -- Sen. John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV, 53, a millionare-Democrat, 
captured a second term against financially outgunned Republican John Yoder. 
</P>
<P>
Rockefeller was winning 73% of the vote to Yoder's 27%. 
</P>
<P>
Rockefeller, a former two-term governer, drew criticism for setting spending 
records in previous campaigns for governor and Senate. He cut back on campaign 
spending this year. 
</P>
<P>
But Rockefeller still reported raising $2.7 million and spending $1.4 million, 
compared with the $19,000 Yoder spent. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia's four congressmen, all Democrats, retained their seats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WISCONSIN 
</P>
<P>
MADISON -- Democratic Rep. Robert W. Kastenmeier, a veteran of 32 years in 
Congress, was upset by Republican Scott L. Klug, a former television news 
reporter who called Kastenmeier "torn, worn and outdated." 
</P>
<P>
Incumbents won win the eight other races for congressional seats. 
</P>
<P>
In the governor's race, Republican incumbent Tommy G. Thompson, buoyed by a 
strong state economy and a commanding popularity rating in public opinion 
polls, was reelected by a decisive margin. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, 48, was winning 58% of the vote to 42% for Democratic challenger Tom 
Loftus. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, 48, served two decades in the Legislature before being elected 
governor in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The race was seen as a referendum on Thompson's welfare reforms, including a 
program that reduces payments to people who don't keep their teen-agers in 
school. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WYOMING 
</P>
<P>
CHEYENNE -- Democratic Gov. Mike Sullivan, benefiting from a slowly reviving 
economy, easily gained reelection over Republican Mary Mead. 
</P>
<P>
Republican U.S. Sen. Alan K. Simpson, 59, coasted to a third term over 
challenger Kathy Helling, a Democrat. The Senate minority whip's margin was 63% 
to 37%. 
</P>
<P>
Recovering coal, trona and oil industries as well as vibrant tourism and 
improving agriculture helped Sullivan, who campaigned on an economic 
development platform four years ago. He was winning 66% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON -- Voters denied scandal-scarred Marion Barry an at-large City 
Council seat, and replaced him in the mayor's office with Democrat Sharon Pratt 
Dixon, a 46-year-old political novice. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Jackson, meanwhile, defeated 10 other candidates for his first elected 
office -- an unpaid, non-voting "shadow" Senate seat from which he will attempt 
to win statehood for the district. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon became the first black woman elected to lead a major American city. She 
was defeating former Police Chief Maurice T. Turner, the Republican, by the 
largest winning share of any mayoral candidate in the district's modern 
political history, 86% to 12%. 
</P>
<P>
Barry, who faces a six-month jail term for cocaine possession, trailed Democrat 
Linda Cropp and incumbent Hilda H. M. Mason of the D.C. Statehood Party in the 
race for two at-large council seats. Barry served three terms as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights activist Eleanor Holmes Norton was elected non-voting House 
delegate, defeating Republican Harry Singleton, 59% to 30%, despite revelations 
that she and her husband had paid no local taxes for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
By a narrow margin, voters opposed a referendum that would restore a 
comprehensive overnight shelter law requiring the city to provide refuge to any 
homeless person who demanded it. The City Council gutted the law earlier this 
year, citing high costs.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angered that San Diego County Sheriff John Duffy set up a secret account for 
money seized in drug raids, the Board of Supervisors decided Tuesday to file a 
lawsuit to regain control of the money. 
</P>
<P>
The civil lawsuit is expected to be filed today in San Diego Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
The board reached a consensus in closed session to go to court over the matter, 
which has further soured the already strained relationship between supervisors 
and the sheriff, who is retiring from office. 
</P>
<P>
The suit could include a request for a temporary restraining order to prevent 
Duffy from making further allocations from the secret account, county officials 
suggested. 
</P>
<P>
The board wants the court to force Duffy to account for the more than $300,000 
seized in drug raids -- called asset-forfeiture funds -- and return the money 
to the control of the supervisors, said county spokesman Bob Lerner.

THELMA ROBINSON; DANCER, TEACHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thelma Robinson, a seminal figure on the Los Angeles dance scene and a longtime 
teacher and choreographer whose students included a young Alvin Ailey, has 
died. 
</P>
<P>
Erwin Washington, a longtime friend and colleague, said Tuesday that Miss 
Robinson died Oct. 27 of cancer at a Los Angeles hospital. 
</P>
<P>
She was 66. 
</P>
<P>
Lured to dance while a young girl in Prohibition-era Kansas City, she studied 
ballet and tap in a studio over a nightclub while listening to the music of 
Count Basie and Benny Carter below. 
</P>
<P>
She turned professional at 17, joining the Katherine Dunham ensemble, then the 
major black American dance company. 
</P>
<P>
After a trip to Los Angeles with the Dunham troupe in 1945, she opted to stay 
here, performing, modeling and later teaching dance. 
</P>
<P>
Among her first students was Ailey, then 18. 
</P>
<P>
She continued to teach and choreograph until her health failed. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include two sons.

JURY DEADLOCKS, JUDGE DECLARES MISTRIAL IN TRIPLE-MURDER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A judge reluctantly declared a mistrial Tuesday in the Thomas Maniscalco 
triple-murder case, the longest in Orange County history, after jurors said 
they were hopelessly deadlocked on the 26th day of deliberation. 
</P>
<P>
Some jurors, who told Superior Court Judge Kathleen E. O'Leary they were split 
10-2, with most voting for a guilty verdict in the 10-year-old case, said they 
questioned the credibility of some of the witnesses for the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
"The prosecutor did the best he could, but I think it is a very, very weak 
case," said Diane Martinez of Fullerton, one of the two holdout jurors. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard M. King told O'Leary he was ready to immediately 
retry the Westminster attorney and biker leader, and a Nov. 13 date was set for 
a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
The Maniscalco trial began with jury selection more than 17 months ago. The 
jury's marathon deliberations continued over two months, surpassing the 
previous record for a trial by at least 11 days. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess to just say thank you is rather hollow at this point," O'Leary told 
the jurors. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Maniscalco is retried, and co-defendant Daniel Duffy is tried at 
the end of 1991, the cost of bringing them to court will run in the millions of 
dollars, although the specific costs have not yet been calculated. 
</P>
<P>
Maniscalco, 45, who helped found the Hessian motorcycle gang, is accused of 
leading a band of killers to the Westminster home of his former best friend, 
Richard (Rabbit) Rizzone, 36, on Memorial Day weekend, 1980, to kill him and 
any witnesses. More than a week later Rizzone, Thomas Monahan, 28, considered a 
Rizzone bodyguard, and Rena Miley, 19, Rizzone's girlfriend, were found dead at 
Rizzone's tract home. Miley had been raped and then shot. The other two were 
also shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecution witnesses said Maniscalco, who describes his legal career as 
"dedicated to counterculture people," mainly bikers, was also running drug and 
counterfeit money operations. Maniscalco was upset with Rizzone, prosecutors 
claim, because he was skimming profits from the illegal operations.

STUDIO FAMOUS FOR SILENT CLASSICS, HORROR FILMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Universal Studios lot, which suffered major damage in a spectacular blaze 
Tuesday night, was part of Hollywood's oldest surviving studio -- first built 
in 1915 on the site of a chicken farm by Carl Laemmle, a German immigrant who 
made the studio a major force in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Laemmle founded the Universal Films Manufacturing Co. on the site in the 
Cahuenga Pass, then an expanse of dry meadows. In its first year, the studio 
produced more than 250 silent films. 
</P>
<P>
In an announcement to a group of theater owners as the lot opened, Laemmle 
proclaimed a philosophy of filmmaking that would characterize Universal for 75 
years: 
</P>
<P>
"See how we blow up bridges, burn down houses, wreck automobiles and smash 
things in general in order to give people of the world the kind of pictures 
they demand." 
</P>
<P>
Among the early silent classics filmed at the studio were "The Phantom of the 
Opera" in 1925, and the silent 1923 version of "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," 
for which a large facade of the famed cathedral was constructed on the lot. 
Both films starred Lon Chaney. 
</P>
<P>
Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi haunted the lot in the 1930s, as Universal 
produced a series of early horror classics -- including "Dracula" and 
"Frankenstein." 
</P>
<P>
Later, the studio lot was the site for many of the comedies of Abbott and 
Costello and more horror classics, such as Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho." 
</P>
<P>
A parade of stars regularly visited the studio commissary in the 1940s and 50s, 
including Jimmy Stewart, Charlton Heston, Burt Lancaster and Rock Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s and '70s, after being purchased by MCA Inc., the studio cranked 
out segments of such television series as "Adam-12," "McMillan and Wife" and 
"McCloud." 
</P>
<P>
The Universal Studios Tour opened in the summer of 1964, with two trams and a 
280-person daily capacity. Then, for an admission charge of $6.50, a couple 
with one child could see an Edith Head fashion show, a makeup demonstration, a 
stunt fight, back lot streets and Frankenstein's monster. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the tour included the original Norman Bates home from the film "Psycho" 
and the suburban television home of the Cleaver clan. 
</P>
<P>
In one memorable tour mishap in 1973, the "Adam-12" squad car was accidently 
engulfed in water while cruising through a park attraction depicting the 
"parting of the Red Sea." 
</P>
<P>
The studio tour became one of the nation's largest and most popular amusement 
parks in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
About 5 million people took the tour in 1989, when the price of a ticket for a 
single adult hit $21.

FIRE RAVAGES UNIVERSAL STUDIOS' BACK LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A spectacular fire ravaged Universal Studios' back lot Tuesday night, forcing 
authorities to evacuate restaurants and theaters on the grounds and to 
temporarily close entrances where Republican Party faithful were trying to get 
to the Universal City Hilton for election-night celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
Tour groups and about 200 studio employees were still on the lot when the fire 
broke out about 7:15 p.m., but no injuries to civilians or firefighters were 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate estimate of damage, but the loss was expected to be in 
the millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Lew Wasserman, chairman of MCA, Universal Studios' parent company, said he was 
"talking to our people every 15 minutes. We won't know how serious it is until 
they knock the fire down." 
</P>
<P>
More than 400 Los Angeles city and county firefighters, assisted by 
water-dropping helicopters, contained the blaze about 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire was under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze destroyed sets known as New York Street; an adjacent alley scene; 
Brownstone Street; Courthouse Square, where "Back to the Future" was filmed; 
the Dick Tracy Building, where that hit movie was made, and the set where "Ben 
Hur" was filmed, said county Fire Inspector Jim Gandee. 
</P>
<P>
The most intense flames were in the set facades, which Gandee described as 
"just like kindling." 
</P>
<P>
The fire also heavily damaged the King Kong exhibit on the Universal Studios 
tour and the tour's Earthquake exhibit, fire officials said, but firefighters 
saved the studio's film archives. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no sound stages lost, but we lost a lot of sets," said county fire 
Battalion Chief P. Michael Freeman. "We had a firestorm in there. The fire was 
whirling with the wind. It was blowing through the whole back lot with . . . 
gusts up to 50 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Studio officials, however, said damage to tour attractions was "minor" and the 
facility will be open today. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known how the fire might affect the proposed $8-billion purchase of 
Universal and MCA Inc., by Japan's Matsushita Electric Industries Corp., also 
known as Panasonic. The studio and other facilities are worth an estimated $500 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic on the nearby Hollywood Freeway and area streets was snarled for hours 
after the fire erupted as police closed streets, temporarily keeping hundreds 
of GOP supporters away from their election-night headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of onlookers lined Barham Boulevard, which runs alongside the 
Universal property, to watch the flames. Emergency vehicles trying to get to 
the fire also were caught in the snarl. 
</P>
<P>
Gusty Santa Ana winds cleared skies over Los Angeles on Tuesday, making a 
column of smoke from the studio blaze visible in Northridge 10 miles away. 
Flames shooting as high as 150 feet into the night sky provided a dazzling 
light show for motorists on the Hollywood and Ventura freeways. 
</P>
<P>
The fire began in a warehouse-type building, then quickly spread on gusty winds 
to at least two other structures and to dry brush on nearby hillsides, Los 
Angeles Police Sgt. Richard Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
The flames raged over a four-acre area, forcing the evacuation of an 
undetermined number of tourists and about 200 employees before it was 
contained, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
A witness who declined to be identified told reporters he was at the top of the 
hill near an office building and was looking down on the set of "Oscar," the 
new Sylvester Stallone movie, when he saw the fire start. "There was a little 
flame that just started spiraling straight up the hill," he said. "The wind was 
blowing so hard that it just shot up the hill. I can tell you there is a lot of 
damage. It's a multimillion-dollar fire." 
</P>
<P>
One man employed on "Oscar," a John Landis production, said he walked onto the 
set while firefighters were putting out the last embers. "That New York set is 
gone," said the man, who asked not to be identified. "We left 40 cars out 
there, antique automobiles, and they're gone. The whole thing is leveled. It 
was a beautiful set, too." 
</P>
<P>
Half a dozen fire helicopters flew within 100 feet of the fire and dropped 
water on the blaze through wind-driven smoke that billowed as high as 4,000 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
Near the Universal City Hilton, where the GOP's election-night party was being 
held, a huge traffic jam limited access, forcing Republican attorney general 
candidate Dan Lungren and his wife, Bobi, to walk up a hill from Lankershim 
Boulevard to the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of state candidate Joan Milke Flores said her driver went the wrong 
way down a one-way street in order to reach the hotel. Others already in the 
hotel watched the flames with an air of incredulity. 
</P>
<P>
GOP gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson told the crowd at the hotel that 
snarled traffic because of the fire had made it "very difficult for people to 
gain entry, so you'll have to be very careful and probably a little patient as 
you depart. But let me just say this. Our good wishes and our thanks go to 
those firefighters. Please be very cooperative with them." 
</P>
<P>
Vehicle access to the hotel was restored shortly after 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
In the 23rd-floor suite of state controller candidate Matt Fong, guests 
listened to Chinese musician Li Guang-Zu play a violin-type instrument called 
the pi-pa as the fire raged in their view beyond the windows. 
</P>
<P>
One Fong supporter, John Woo, a South Pasadena real estate developer, asked: 
"Is it a real fire? I thought it was movie-making. You know, this is still 
Universal Studios." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale High School's band and cheerleaders were stuck in traffic on their bus 
for 20 minutes before finally getting into the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"We were stopped out there on Lankershim in the left turn lane," said one 
student, Dolly McDonald, 18. "The fire was huge. We were afraid we were going 
to have to go home." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, fire destroyed the three-story "Spartacus" set and three other 
buildings at Universal. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Frank Clifford, Michael Connelly, Paul Feldman, Andrea 
Ford, Nieson Himmel, John Kendall, John H. Lee, Patt Morrison, Bob Pool and 
Richard A. Serrano contributed to this story.

</P>
<P>
ELECTION: EXIT POLLS SHOW GUBERNATORIAL CONTEST IS TOO CLOSE TO CALL. THE 
OUTCOME MAY HINGE ON ABSENTEE BALLOTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Democrat Dianne Feinstein and Republican U.S. Senator Pete Wilson were locked 
in a tight battle for the governorship early today after a historic campaign 
that saw Feinstein driving to become the first woman governor in California. 
</P>
<P>
Early absentee returns gave Wilson a slim lead, but exit polls, including one 
by The Times, showed the race too close to call. Ultimately, the outcome may be 
determined by as many as 500,000 absentee ballots that election officials will 
not begin to count until today. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Times exit poll, which surveyed 6,960 voters in 150 precincts, 
Feinstein won among those who voted in person. Wilson, however, appeared to 
have won the heavy absentee vote, which election officials said may total 20% 
of the overall tally. 
</P>
<P>
Victory, therefore, hinged on just how large a margin Wilson held in absentees 
-- a scenario reminiscent of the 1982 race for governor, in which Los Angeles 
Mayor Tom Bradley, the Democratic nominee, won the Election Day vote only to 
lose to Republican George Deukmejian when the absentee votes were counted. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, where he flew after an earlier appearance in Los Angeles, Wilson 
expressed confidence but warned his backers to prepare for a long night. 
</P>
<P>
"Stay tuned, save some of that lung power for later," he told cheering 
supporters. "But for now, let me just tell you, it is not too early for me to 
declare all of you winners." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein, talking to Los Angeles supporters by telephone from San Francisco, 
encouraged them to keep their hopes up. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't over yet," she said, "but frankly speaking, I'm very optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
The ballot-counting was marred by an early foul-up that brought tallying to a 
halt and drove the candidates and campaign workers to fits of worry. 
</P>
<P>
Melissa Warren, a spokeswoman for the secretary of state's office, said the 
computer system that totals returns in Sacramento stopped at 9:08 p.m., just an 
hour after the polls closed, and came back 45 minutes later. The problem was 
traced to an overload in a file, but results came in sluggishly throughout the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state's office said the percentage of registered voters who 
turned out was in the low 60s, with absentee ballots accounting for about 20% 
of the votes. 
</P>
<P>
Both campaigns were setting up for a long night. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to keep our fingers crossed and see what happens when the 
absentees come in," said Wilson's campaign director, Otto Bos. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's campaign director, Bill Carrick, expressed similar confidence in 
the Democratic get-out-the-vote effort. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good, targeted, disciplined effort and I think it'll be reflected in 
the returns tonight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican gathering at the Universal City Hilton was disrupted by the huge 
fire on the nearby Universal Studios lot. Some supporters left the ballroom to 
look at the glow in the sky. Traffic also was disrupted in the vicinity. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats were dominating the other statewide contests, but there were tight 
races for attorney general and state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Arlo Smith held a slim advantage over Republican former congressman 
Dan Lungren in the race for attorney general, a post John K. Van de Kamp 
relinquished to pursue a losing run for governor this year. 
</P>
<P>
And Democrat Kathleen Brown, sister of one former governor and daughter of 
another, held a narrow lead over incumbent state Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes, 
appointed to the post by Deukmejian and seeking his first four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
The first race for state insurance commissioner went to Democrat John Garamendi 
of Walnut Grove, who resigned his seat in the state Senate in the midst of his 
general election campaign against Huntington Beach insurance executive Wes 
Bannister. 
</P>
<P>
Bannister spent only $85,000 on his campaign, including money pumped in by the 
Republican party, and was openly sheepish about his chances. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be the biggest fluke in the whole world if I win," he said, adding, "I'm 
not a household name." 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy of San Francisco apparently won a third 
term, holding a comfortable lead over State Sen. Marian Bergeson of Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
And in a bid for her fifth term, Democratic Secretary of State March Fong Eu 
appeared to defeat Republican challenger Joan Milke Flores, a Los Angeles City 
Council member., 
</P>
<P>
Gray Davis, the Democratic incumbent controller, won his second term over 
Hacienda Heights attorney Matt Fong, Eu's son, but he expressed concern about 
the voter mood this year. "I never worked so hard to nail down what everyone 
thinks is a sure thing," he said, "because I think there is understandable 
unease and in some cases anger." 
</P>
<P>
And with nearly half the vote counted, the Democratic candidate for District 4 
of the Board of Equalization, former state Sen. Paul Carpenter, was winning -- 
despite his recent conviction on federal racketeering and other charges. Even 
if Carpenter wins, he would not be able to serve and replacement would be 
appointed by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
At more than 26,000 polling places across the state, voters arrived armed with 
thick sample ballots containing a daunting array of issues. Besides the 
governor's race, at stake were six other state constitutional offices, 28 
ballot propositions -- some of which canceled out each other -- 45 
congressional seats, 80 posts in the California Assembly and 21 seats in the 
state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
And that did not even count such regional decisions as the four seats on the 
State Board of Equalization and various city and county issues. 
</P>
<P>
Early indications were that voter turnout was on target with the projections of 
Secretary of State Eu that 62.1% of those registered would cast ballots. All 
told, 19 million Californians are eligible to vote by virtue of their age. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's race was guaranteed a place in the history books because of its 
cost. By Election Day, the major participants had spent more than $40 million 
in pursuit of the chief executive's job, not counting millions more spent by 
candidates who did not make the final cut. 
</P>
<P>
The winner is expected to vault onto the nation's political stage. The 
country's national political parties were holding their breath at the outcome, 
for the governor will have a major role in the reapportionment process. 
California is expected to gain seven congressional seats and the lines for 
legislative seats also will be redrawn. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates closed out their races with traditional arguments, Wilson 
alleging that Feinstein would hike taxes and spend frivolously, Feinstein 
countering that Wilson would favor the rich at the expense of the bulk of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Both embraced the notion of change, with Feinstein arguing that she represented 
a leap from the policies of current Gov. George Deukmejian, and Wilson 
asserting that he would be a more activist and flexible governor than his 
predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
Largely lost in the air wars between the candidates for governor and the 
various initiatives were those running for lesser statewide offices. 
</P>
<P>
Smith and Lungren, engaged in the most bitter of the races, bashed each other 
on abortion rights -- which Smith favors and Lungren opposes -- and offshore 
oil drilling, which Lungren favors and Smith opposes. Their fiercest salvos 
were reserved for late accusations by each that the other simply was not 
qualified to serve as attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
The race for lieutenant governor between McCarthy and Bergeson centered mostly 
on crime. McCarthy touted his Proposition 133, the drug-war initiative that 
would add a half-cent to the sales tax and set aside the money to fight drugs 
and crime. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson emphasized her conservative positions on crime and, although she 
opposes abortion rights, criticized McCarthy for once having shared her 
position. 
</P>
<P>
Brown made the most of her family's political traditions and skated through her 
primary race for the treasurer's office. But Hayes, out-financed and battered 
by a competitive primary, fought back by accusing Brown of intending to play 
politics with the state post. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Democrats Eu and Davis were challenged by first-time statewide 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Eu spent most of the campaign for secretary of state ignoring Republican 
challenger Flores, but in the closing days went on the air to counter 
hard-hitting Flores commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Eu's son, Democrat-turned-Republican Fong, played up his family lineage despite 
the fact that his mother was technically neutral in the race. He also hit Davis 
hard, linking him in television ads with controversial investment banker 
Michael Milken. 
</P>
<P>
But Davis presented a largely positive image, keying on issues such as the 
environment and abortion rights and portraying himself as an activist. 
</P>
<P>
In the insurance commissioner's race, Garamendi out-raised and out-spent 
Bannister, who virtually defined the concept of "low profile." The candidates 
differed on a wide range of issues, particularly no-fault insurance, with 
Bannister favoring it and Garamendi, who once sponsored no-fault legislation, 
against it.

'LONE GUNMAN' KILLED KAHANE, N.Y. OFFICIAL SAYS 
</P>

<P>
Authorities said Tuesday that the alleged assassin of controversial Jewish 
activist Rabbi Meir Kahane was an Egyptian-born municipal maintenance worker in 
New York City's criminal courts building who apparently acted alone. 
</P>
<P>
Chief of Detectives Joseph Borrelli said that initial indications were that 
34-year-old El-Sayyid A. Nosair, who arrived in the United States from Egypt in 
1981 and became a naturalized citizen last year, was not part of any conspiracy 
with other individuals or groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, what we have is a lone gunman who committed a homicide in New 
York," Borrelli told reporters at a late afternoon news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Nosair, who remained at Bellevue Hospital in critical but stable condition, was 
formally charged with murder and related charges on Tuesday. Nosair was wounded 
by a U.S. Postal Service guard as he fled the hotel were Kahane was killed. 
Authorities said that it might be several days until Nosair would be capable of 
responding to intensive questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Kahane, 58, a founder of the Jewish Defense League and former member of the 
Israeli Parliament who advocated expelling Arabs from Israel and its 
territories, was shot Monday night. He had just finished addressing a group of 
his supporters known as Jewish Idea at the New York Marriott East Side Hotel 
when a gunman identified as Nosair approached and began shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Police were seeking a search warrant to enter the New Jersey residence where 
Nosair is believed to have lived with his wife, Caren, and three young 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Borrelli said that detectives had questioned Nosair's wife, but that she 
claimed to have no prior knowledge of her husband's whereabouts on the night of 
Kahane's murder or of any possible motive Nosair might have had for the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"In her words, she's a good Muslim wife and never questions her husband," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown said that, despite no signs of a conspiracy, 
authorities were taking extensive precautions to guard both Jewish and Arab 
institutions in the city, including the Israeli and Egyptian missions to the 
United Nations, the offices of El Al Israel Airlines and New York's local 
Jewish publications. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working very closely with the FBI and the State Department and all 
relevant international agencies to determine where the suspect came from and if 
he had any connection with any other individuals . . . or any connection with 
any particular group or organization," Brown said at the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner said that the police investigation was being conducted with a 
view toward the problems in the Middle East and "how those problems may affect 
the safety of residents here in the city of New York." 
</P>
<P>
However, he said, police were unaware of any threats against Kahane prior to 
the shooting and were not providing him with protection. 
</P>
<P>
As police delivered the status report on their investigation, thousands of 
mourners -- some holding signs vowing "Revenge" and "Never Again" -- packed a 
small, yellow-brick Brooklyn synagogue and the street outside during funeral 
services for Kahane. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial Jewish activist was lauded as "a talented leader . . . a 
giant and a sword" during the militant but emotional afternoon ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Security was heavy as police closed the block in front of the synagogue to all 
vehicular traffic. The crowd was so thick that many who wished to pay tribute 
to Kahane were unable to enter the synagogue. After the service, Kahane's body 
was flown from John F. Kennedy International Airport to Israel for burial. 
</P>
<P>
Police and immigration officials said Tuesday that Nosair was born in Port 
Said, Egypt, in 1955 and arrived in the United States from Egypt in 1981. Two 
years later, while residing in Pittsburgh, Pa., he received permanent alien 
status and in 1989, in Newark, N.J., he became a naturalized American citizen. 
</P>
<P>
He met and married his wife, an American who practices the Islamic faith, in 
Pittsburgh. They have two boys and a girl, the oldest of whom is 8. 
</P>
<P>
The family resided at several addresses in New Jersey. However, Nosair listed 
the address of a relative in Brooklyn when he applied for his job with the city 
government. 
</P>
<P>
He has worked as an air-conditioning maintenance man since April, 1988, at the 
criminal courts building in Manhattan, according to a spokesman for the city 
Department of General Services. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, his children attended an Islamic school in Jersey City, just 
across the Hudson River from Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Borrelli said that Nosair's co-workers at the criminal courts building had been 
questioned but they reported "nothing unusual" about Nosair. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not as yet determined and gotten a true motive in this case," Borrelli 
said. "There were no shouts . . . no conversation between the assailant and 
Rabbi Kahane before the shooting." 
</P>
<P>
Kahane was shot just after he delivered a lecture about Israel and the Persian 
Gulf crisis to about 100 people in the hotel. Police said he was struck by at 
least one bullet, possibly two, fired from a .357-caliber Ruger revolver. 
</P>
<P>
Swathed in anti-shock garb by paramedics, Kahane was rushed to Bellevue 
Hospital, where physicians pronounced him dead at 9:57 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Soon afterward, Kahane's supporters arrived at the hospital and held a prayer 
vigil. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that after shooting Kahane, Nosair fled from the floral-carpeted 
meeting room and fled down a hallway, where he encountered Irving Franklin, 73, 
who was selling literature about the meeting. Nosair shot Franklin in the leg 
and continued his flight. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin was in stable condition at Bellevue. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that Nosair commandeered a taxi at gunpoint outside the hotel but 
jumped out after the cab had driven only about 75 feet at East 48th Street and 
Lexington Avenue. There were conflicting reports on why Nosair exited the cab. 
One version said the driver had fled; the other said the cab got stuck in heavy 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Upon leaving the taxi, Nosair was confronted by a uniformed U.S. Postal Service 
police officer, Carlos Acosta, 55. Borrelli said that Nosair fired at Acosta, 
striking him in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, he was wearing his bulletproof vest," the chief of detectives 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Acosta wounded Nosair in the chin during a brief exchange of gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
Nosair was charged with second-degree murder, first-degree attempted murder, 
second-degree assault, criminal possession of a weapon and unlawful 
imprisonment for holding the cabdriver hostage briefly. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the serial number had been obliterated from the revolver Nosair 
allegedly used to slay Kahane. 
</P>
<P>
For more than two decades, Kahane has been a controversial figure, both in the 
United States and Israel, where he was expelled from the parliament after his 
extremist party was banned. 
</P>
<P>
Most mainstream Jewish organizations condemned his philosophy and tactics. 
</P>
<P>
Kahane founded the militant Jewish Defense League in 1968 because of what he 
described as the growing anti-Semitism of black militant groups. 
</P>
<P>
Kahane was arrested many times in New York on charges of participating in 
disorderly protests. In July, 1971, two months before he moved to Israel, he 
was given a five-year suspended sentence and fined $5,000 after being convicted 
of conspiring to manufacture explosives. 
</P>
<P>
The rabbi was an Israeli citizen but had been trying to win back his U.S. 
citizenship in court.

HELMS DEFEATS GANTT IN DUEL OF OLD, NEW SOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

RALEIGH, N.C. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republican Sen. Jesse Helms, icon of ultra-conservatives, defeated Democrat 
Harvey Gantt, the former mayor of Charlotte, winning a fourth term and snuffing 
out his challenger's dream of becoming the nation's only black senator. 
</P>
<P>
With 94% of the vote counted, Helms led 53% to 47%, a comfortable 130,000-vote 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before midnight, a feisty Helms addressed cheering supporters at a 
downtown Raleigh hotel. He hailed a "return to the moral and spiritual ideals," 
lambasted "cheap politicians," the media, his critics and "the mighty liberal 
Establishment" and declared that they "have struck out again." 
</P>
<P>
To shouts of "Give 'em hell!" and "Tell it!" Helms, surrounded by his happy 
family, declared: "Today, you have given me a mandate to continue to say no, 
and I make this covenant with you tonight: If the liberal politicians think 
I've been a thorn in their sides in the past, they haven't seen anything yet." 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, at a nearby hotel, Gantt, clearly disappointed, spoke to his 
supporters, calling for unity and continued pursuit of liberal ideals. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still smiling from way down deep, even though I hurt," Gantt said, as 
supporters chanted: "Harvey! Harvey!" 
</P>
<P>
He asserted that he wanted to "appeal to your best aspirations," and said that 
"it is still important that we address the problems of our children. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
As his wife, Cindy, sobbed at his side, Gantt said, "I'm going to continue to 
hold out hope that one day we'll reach that point in time when we move together 
as a community." 
</P>
<P>
While his aides refused to call his remarks a concession, several admitted 
privately that it was virtually impossible for Gantt to overtake Helms' lead. 
</P>
<P>
Initial analyses showed that Helms drew heavily from less-educated white voters 
and those who are native North Carolinians, while Gantt won support among 
newcomers, black voters and well-educated white voters. Analysts had figured 
that Gantt needed to win at least 40% of the white votes to win. 
</P>
<P>
The contest ended on a fractious note, as a massive failure of voting machines 
caused a judge to order polls in Durham County left open 2 1/2 hours beyond the 
scheduled 7:30 p.m. closing time. Officials also ordered crowded polls in 
Guilford County opened an hour longer. Both are urban areas believed to be 
Gantt strongholds. 
</P>
<P>
While Gantt rushed out to make extraordinary Election Night campaign appeals in 
Durham County, Helms campaign officials tried to get the order reversed and 
threatened to formally protest the election. 
</P>
<P>
The late maneuvering, including charges of voting irregularities, seemed a 
fitting climax in a contest that pitted a black challenger against the 
controversial white incumbent who, during his 18 years in the Senate, has 
symbolized far-right conservatism. 
</P>
<P>
Both candidates watched the election returns here Tuesday night, after Helms 
voted here and Gantt cast his ballot in Charlotte. After voting, Helms stayed 
home, but Gantt stumped for votes throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
Helms, contentious to the end, told reporters after voting that he had just a 
few words for Gantt: "Tell the truth, for once." 
</P>
<P>
After casting his ballot, Gantt said: "We always thought we were going to win." 
</P>
<P>
The two men fought a bitter, bruising battle that, in the end, centered on race 
and became a metaphor for the nation's emotional confrontation with the issues 
of race and racism. More than any other political campaign this year, the 
face-off between Gantt and Helms came to represent a struggle between the Old 
South and the New. 
</P>
<P>
Gantt, in speeches and advertisements, portrayed Helms as ineffective in the 
Senate on a range of issues, including education, the environment and health 
care. He supported women's right to choose abortion and criticized Helms for 
opposing abortion rights. "It's time for a change," he said repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
Helms counted on North Carolinians to be content with the status quo, believing 
that he could win with an appeal based more on what he disliked than what he 
liked. Thus, in his campaign speeches, remarks on the Senate floor, interviews 
and ads he castigated homosexuals, liberals, some artists and women's rights 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
To the end, Helms refused to acknowledge that his campaign centered on the old 
issue of race, insisting that the Senate race simply pitted a conservative 
against a liberal, good against evil. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina was ripe for this confrontation of contrasts. A state of 
contradictions, it is known nationally for its Research Triangle, an area that 
hums with new technology and new residents who migrated to the state. But it is 
also a state that ranks 49th on Scholastic Aptitude Test scores, one that 
routinely suffers racial clashes and hate-group activity. 
</P>
<P>
"North Carolina, without question, has these two sides," said Nancy Neale, who 
directs the undergraduate social work program at Appalachian State University 
and is president of the state chapter of the National Assn. of Social Workers. 
"The mean side divides people up, setting off their worst fears. That's what we 
had in this race." 
</P>
<P>
The combatants were well-matched archetypes -- the white symbol of power 
against the black symbol of hope for power. 
</P>
<P>
Gantt, a 47-year-old architect, was born in Charleston, S.C., one of five 
siblings whose father was a Naval shipyard worker. From an impoverished 
beginning, Gantt rose to mark several firsts, including becoming, in 1963, the 
first black student at Clemson University. He earned a master's degree in city 
planning from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and in 1983 was elected 
Charlotte's first black mayor. He was reelected two years later but lost a 
third attempt in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
During his Senate campaign, Gantt often cited Charlotte, where 75% of voters 
were white, to remind doubters that he had a history of attracting white voters 
and defeating white candidates. 
</P>
<P>
None, however, had ever been as willing as Helms to use race in a campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The 69-year-old senator, a native of Monroe, N.C., son of the local police 
chief, attended Wake Forest College but never graduated. Among his several 
media jobs was a 12-year run as an editorialist at a television station here, a 
position that made him famous as a hardball conservative. 
</P>
<P>
Helms parlayed his notoriety as television commentator into his first 
successful Senate race in 1972, winning reelection in 1978 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, however, his opponents had been white. The 1990 contest, with Gantt 
the first black Democratic nominee, left analysts guessing when Helms would 
make the contest a racial one. 
</P>
<P>
Helms gambled on making the racial gambit late in the race. Up until October, 
he spent little time in the state, working instead on Senate business in 
Washington, running advertisements and using fund-raising letters to take 
swipes at "the special interests -- the ACLU, the homosexual crowd, the 
Hollywood fat cats, People for the American Way, the so-called National 
Organization for Women, Planned Parenthood and the union bosses." 
</P>
<P>
Then, with Election Day about two weeks off, and opinion polls showing that 
Gantt was leading, Helms turned up the heat on race, in speeches as well as in 
advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a wake-up call," said Thad Beyle, a political science professor at 
the University of North Carolina. "That was to tell voters that 'this is an 
important race. Come on out.' That resonates with some people."

3 INCUMBENTS FALLING BEHIND; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: DEMOCRATS BATES AND BOSCO AND REPUBLICAN PASHAYAN ARE LOSING TO 
CHALLENGERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A highly decorated Navy fighter pilot was defeating Democratic Rep. Jim Bates 
of San Diego on Tuesday, and two other incumbents were locked in tight races 
with challengers who had sought to link them with the savings and loan debacle. 
</P>
<P>
Bates, pursuing a fifth term as the representative from the 44th District, was 
trailing GOP challenger Randall (Duke) Cunningham, a colorful campaigner who 
had described the congressman as "just another MiG" ready to be shot down. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bates exuded confidence going into the election, Republicans viewed 
the incumbent as vulnerable because he was reprimanded last year by the House 
Ethics Committee over charges he had sexually harassed female staff members. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the state, incomplete returns showed Rep. Charles (Chip) Pashayan 
(R-Fresno) lagging behind Visalia farmer Calvin Dooley, a Democrat. And in a 
race that may have caught Democrats off guard, four-term North Coast incumbent 
Douglas Bosco (D-Sebastapool), was trailing an underfunded businessman, Frank 
Riggs, in the 1st District. 
</P>
<P>
"The trend is going our way," Dooley said while celebrating with supporters at 
a Visalia restaurant. "It looks good." 
</P>
<P>
Pashayan, appearing nervous, declined to talk with the press and closeted 
himself with aides to monitor the returns. 
</P>
<P>
In two other California races that drew nationwide attention this year, GOP 
stalwart Rep. Al McCandless was holding a narrow lead over television actor 
Ralph Waite in Riverside County's sprawling 37th District, and veteran Rep. 
George Brown (D-Colton) was fending off Robert Hammock, a San Bernardino County 
supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like the numbers are holding up," Brown said while watching returns 
at his campaign headquarters in San Bernardino. But, he added, "I'm not going 
to claim victory until Bob says he's lost." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the handful of close races, most California representatives survived 
with ease this election year. That means Democrats will continue to hold a wide 
edge over Republicans in the California House delegation. Before the election, 
the margin was 27-18. 
</P>
<P>
Only two open House seats were up for grabs in California, and their likely 
winners symbolize the polar extremes of the state's political spectrum. Los 
Angeles Assemblywoman Maxine Waters, a liberal Democrat, was considered a 
shoo-in to succeed retiring Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
And state Sen. John Doolittle, a Republican from Rocklin best known for 
sponsoring AIDS-related bills deemed hostile to gays, had a comfortable lead in 
the race for the 14th District seat vacated by Rep. Norman Shumway 
(R-Stockton). 
</P>
<P>
Accustomed to scoring easy victories throughout their tenures in Congress, 
Bosco -- who won with 63% of the vote in 1988 -- and Pashayan wrestled this 
year with challengers whose campaigns exploited an issue used effectively in 
races across the country -- the savings and loan debacle. 
</P>
<P>
Dooley, 36, sought to link Pashayan with Charles Keating, head of the 
scandal-ridden Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan and the most visible symbol of the 
S&amp;L crisis. In 1986, Keating and his family donated $26,000 to Pashayan, 
and though the congressman returned the money last year, he was recently 
accused of lobbying federal regulators on Lincoln's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging he met with Keating within days of receiving his 1986 
contributions, Pashayan, 49, insisted his letters and phone calls to regulators 
were strictly to aid a thrift in his district. 
</P>
<P>
Dooley, a cotton grower, worked hard to paint himself in contrasting colors, 
emphasizing his ancestors' agricultural history in the San Joaquin Valley and 
pledging, if elected, to pursue water and farming policies favoring the "little 
guy." 
</P>
<P>
Bosco, whose ardent environmental stands have made him popular with many voters 
in the Redwood Empire, became vulnerable after he was unfavorably linked to a 
failed thrift in his district. In the heavily Republican 37th District, 
McCandless, 63, was a favorite to win a fifth term, but two wild cards forced 
the congressman to spend more money in 1990 than he had in all his previous 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
One was growth. Stretching from Riverside east to the Arizona border, the 
district's population has doubled to about 1 million since 1980, and the 
newcomers have eroded the incumbent's traditional advantage -- name 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
The other wild card was Waite's celebrity status: The actor played a 
Depression-era father on "The Waltons," and his image as a hard-working, 
trustworthy fellow was an asset that won him an audience among some 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Waite, 62, tried to persuade voters that McCandless -- a member of the House 
Banking Committee -- deserved blame for the S&amp;L crisis, and he remained 
hopeful despite returns showing McCandless in the lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We predict we're going to get this guy," Waite said as he watched returns with 
25 friends and family members.

LYNCH STRUGGLES AGAINST HAHN; 
</P>
<P>
ASSESSOR: NEWCOMER WITH A FAMOUS POLITICAL NAME INCHES AHEAD OF INCUMBENT IN 
EARLY MORNING RETURNS.

Los Angeles County Assessor John J. Lynch was struggling Tuesday to fend off a 
strong challenge from Kenneth P. Hahn, a political newcomer who benefited from 
a famous name in his bid to seize the office from his boss. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn, who is no relation to County Supervisor Kenneth F. Hahn, was steadily 
inching ahead of Lynch in returns being reported in the early morning hours 
today. 
</P>
<P>
But Lynch, who stressed his support from Supervisor Hahn in his campaign for 
reelection, remained optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew it was going to be a long night," he said from his private room at the 
Universal City Hilton, where about 25 supporters sat quietly watching returns 
on a small television. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere was more festive at the Hahn party at the Biltmore Hotel where 
about 100 supporters chanted "We're No. 1. We're No. 1" when results showed 
Hahn pulling ahead of Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
One of Hahn's co-workers in the assessor's office walked up to Hahn and said 
jokingly, "Please be nice to me, boss." 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like this will take a long time but everything is moving in the right 
direction," said Hahn, 51, a deputy assessor. "I feel very optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
Hahn, waiting for returns, acknowledged that he considered his good fortune a 
fluke when he forced Lynch into a runoff. But after a number of city officials 
endorsed him, "I said, 'My God, I have a chance.' 
</P>

"I find myself a little surprised," Hahn said, "because I had no ambition to be 
a politician. I still don't want to be a politician. I just want to be a good 
administrator." 
</P>
<P>
Hahn, educated as a biologist, has been with the assessor's office for 10 
years, after careers as a chemist and a social worker. He has been working as a 
$42,000-a-year appraiser specialist. The post is slightly senior to the deputy 
assessor position that Lynch held before his 1986 election. 
</P>
<P>
After a strong showing in the primary, money and support began pouring into 
Hahn's campaign. So did endorsements from former Assessor Alexander Pope, 
County Supervisor Ed Edelman and Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, who earlier had 
supported Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch, 53, carried into the election a reputation as a hot-tempered personality 
who was accused of bullying employees and failing to get tax bills out on time. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch spent 14 years as a worker in the lower ranks of the assessor's office 
before his election in 1986. He used his ties as a longtime Republican 
volunteer in the San Fernando Valley and an endorsement from the late tax 
fighter Howard Jarvis to win the job vacated by Pope. 
</P>
<P>
During his administration, Lynch made headlines by kicking county auditors out 
of his office and being accused of assaulting an employee during a heated 
argument over the worker's union activities. 
</P>
<P>
A recent management audit of the office found millions of dollars in billing 
backlogs. Lynch blamed the backlogs on a computer system inherited from his 
predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch's campaign was devoted to getting the word out that his opponent was no 
relation to the supervisor, no easy task in the low-visibility race. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not up against a name," Lynch said Tuesday night. "I'm up against an 
institution." But complicating matters were a couple of mailers sent out in the 
final days before the election. 
</P>
<P>
One was a Hahn mailer dispatched to homes in the final days before the election 
picturing Lynch with a smiling Supervisor Hahn and the supervisor's son, City 
Atty. James Kenneth Hahn. The other was a Lynch mailer touting Bradley's 
endorsement of the incumbent. However, Bradley withdrew his endorsement of 
Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County assessor, who will earn $130,896 a year when the new 
four-year term begins Dec. 3, oversees the largest single property-taxing 
jurisdiction, in land value, in the United States. The assessor oversees an 
office with 1,600 employees who determine the tax bills for 2.2 million 
commercial and residential properties. 
</P>
<P>
The race took on greater importance this year because of redistricting, which 
the Board of Supervisors is scheduled to take up next year regardless of the 
outcome of the pending voting rights litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Should the board fall short of the four votes required for approval of a new 
plan, the issue will be decided by a committee made up of the assessor, the 
district attorney and the sheriff. If elected, Hahn would tip the balance of 
the committee from Republican to Democrat.

DEFEAT LOOMS FOR 4 OF 5 BOND, TAX MEASURES; 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSITIONS: VOTERS EVENLY DIVIDED ONLY ON SALES LEVY FOR TRANSIT PROJECTS. 
MONEY FROM OTHER ISSUES WOULD HAVE AIDED VARIETY OF LOCAL PROJECTS, INCLUDING 
JAILS, HOLLYWOOD BOWL, LOS ANGELES ZOO AND 911 SYSTEM.

<P>
A new 911 emergency phone system, a sweeping parks measure and an ambitious 
jail construction program were among an array of Los Angeles County projects 
headed for defeat Tuesday, but voters appeared about evenly divided on a new 
half-cent sales tax for transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
With more than three-fourths of the vote tallied, prospects for four of five 
tax-raising measures appeared dim, but supporters held out hope for Proposition 
C, the transit tax measure pushed by Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks very hopeful," said Carrie Chasin, a worker on the transit tax 
campaign. Although it was unclear at midnight which precincts remained 
uncounted, Chasin noted that those which depend more heavily on mass 
transportation would weigh in more heavily in favor of the tax. 
</P>
<P>
The measures were largely backed by city and county officials whose budgets are 
strained to their limits. Without the increases, they argued, essential 
services would face cuts and cultural attractions would fall further into 
disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Fox, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn., which opposed most of 
the measures, said, "I think that the voters decided to pick and choose between 
tax increases." In the past, "the voters have been duped into providing good 
money after bad," said county Supervisor Pete Schabarum, an opponent of the 
measures. This time, taxes were rejected because, "the proponents weren't able 
to prove they were going to spend the money wisely," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County and city measures on the ballot were: 
</P>
<P>
Proposition A 
</P>
<P>
County Jail Construction 
</P>
<P>
Voters were asked to approve a half-cent sales tax increase to fund 
construction and operation of new jails and juvenile halls. The measure needed 
approval by a simple majority of the voters. 
</P>
<P>
If passed, the new tax was expected to eventually relieve the jail overcrowding 
that have forced the early releases since mid-1988 of 325,644 people accused or 
convicted of misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents included Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. and Los Angeles Taxpayers 
Assn., who said the measure amounted to an end run around Proposition 13's 
requirement of two-thirds voter approval of tax hikes. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition B 
</P>
<P>
County Parks 
</P>
<P>
The largest bond measure in the county's history would have boosted property 
taxes to pay for an $817-million array of recreational and cultural projects. 
It attracted a wide range of supporters, including such ideological opposites 
as conservative Supervisor Mike Antonovich and liberal Assemblyman Tom Hayden 
(D-Santa Monica). 
</P>
<P>
The key was its novel something-for-everyone approach. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the measure was $50 million for county beaches and harbors, $35 
million for the Hollywood Bowl, $30 million for the Los Angeles Zoo, $13 
million for the County Museum of Natural History, $10 million for the County 
Museum of Art, $13 million for Griffith Observatory and $5 million for trout 
streams. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by two-thirds of the voters, the measure would have added about $20 
a year for 20 years to the tax bill of a home assessed at $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition C 
</P>
<P>
County Transit Projects 
</P>
<P>
The measure would authorize a half-cent sales tax increase to fund transit 
projects, bringing the county's rate to 7%. Like Proposition A, it required a 
simple majority for approval. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would raise an estimated $400 million annually to build and operate 
rail systems, maintain bus service and improve streets. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition J 
</P>
<P>
911 System 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department lobbied hard for the municipal measure to 
raise $235 million to replace its 911 emergency calling and radio systems. The 
department says that as many as 100,000 calls to 911 will go unanswered this 
year because of its outmoded system. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would have cost the owner of the average 1,500-square-foot home 
about $12.50 a year for 20 years. Two-thirds voter approval was required. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition K 
</P>
<P>
Housing Preservation 
</P>
<P>
The $100-million bond measure would have provided $80 million for nonprofit 
groups to buy and rehabilitate 6,000 low-income apartment units that are at 
risk of being lost to earthquakes, demolition or gentrification. Another $10 
million was set aside for building shelters for homeless, and $10 million would 
have gone to loans for low-wage home buyers shut out of the costly Los Angeles 
market. 
</P>
<P>
The measure required a two-thirds vote and would have added about $4.95 a year 
to the average tax bill for 20 years.

S.D. SHERIFF: ROACHE, REVIEW PANEL WINNERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a repudiation of John Duffy and the department he has managed for 20 years, 
reform candidate Jim Roache scored a resounding victory Tuesday as the San 
Diego County's next sheriff, and voters approved a citizens review panel with 
broad power to investigate a variety of possible Sheriff's Department abuses. 
</P>
<P>
Voters rejected another proposition that would have given the County Board of 
Supervisors the option of forming a separate, county corrections department 
that would have operated the jails with civilian employees. 
</P>
<P>
Roache, 45, a sheriff's captain and board member of the San Diego Unified 
School District, had announced that he was running to put an end to Duffy's 
management style, and to sweep clean the sheriff's entrenched upper 
administration and replace it with new faces. Roache has been with the 
department 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at a new era," Roache said Tuesday night. "An era when the 
department lives within its budget, economizes and is open, truthful and candid 
with the public and the Board of Supervisors." 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe the era of the sheriff who believes he has all the answers 
and that nobody else knows what is best for the public has to be put aside," he 
said. "I don't have all the answers, but I'm sure going to work with others to 
find out what the answers are." 
</P>
<P>
His opponent, Assistant Sheriff Jack Drown, 45, who served in upper management 
with Duffy for four years and in the department for 21, sought for nearly a 
year to separate himself from his boss' controversial activities, gaining 
virtually every law enforcement endorsement imaginable along the way. Sheriff's 
deputies overwhelmingly supported Drown. 
</P>
<P>
"John Duffy was my hurdle to overcome," Drown said Tuesday night. "I think 
there were more anti-Duffy votes out there than either anti-Drown votes or 
pro-Roache votes." 
</P>
<P>
Roache said he probably will ask Drown to leave the department when he takes 
office Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe you can make major philosophical and organizational changes 
in a department if you retain the same staff," he said. "The odds are very high 
that I would not ask Mr. Drown to remain with the department." 
</P>
<P>
Proposition A won by a comfortable margin. It will establish a citizens review 
panel appointed by supervisors and empowered to investigate citizen complaints 
of brutality, false arrest, illegal searches, criminal misconduct and other 
potential problems. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition B, a measure that would have allowed supervisors to appoint a 
corrections director and staff the six county jails with civilian corrections 
officers rather than sworn deputies, lost by a wide margin. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's race and both propositions were seen as a referendum on Duffy and 
his management of a department that has tripled in size over two decades and 
serves a population of 740,000, but which has been plagued by problems of jail 
crowding, inmate abuse and Duffy's reputation as an abrasive and vindictive law 
enforcement official. 
</P>
<P>
While Duffy shaped the department's growth and established the agency as one of 
the few in the nation to be nationally accredited, he created a wellspring of 
bad publicity in the past several years, from the questionable way he spent 
public money to his constant bickering with the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, he outraged supervisors by creating a secret bank account for 
funds seized in drug raids, in order to bypass their spending approval. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, it appeared inconceivable that Duffy would not run for a sixth 
term. But, in December, in the midst of a media barrage and facing three 
challengers for his job, a bitter and teary Duffy stunned a packed press 
conference by announcing he would not seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
At the same press conference, Duffy endorsed Drown, but he took no active role 
in his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
With Duffy out of the race, Roache, Escondido Police Chief Vince Jimno, former 
San Diego Police Chief Ray Hoobler and Carlsbad senior Police Officer James 
Messenger, who entered after Duffy's announcement, began to portray Drown as a 
Duffy puppet who would maintain the status quo by keeping the department 
hierarchy intact. 
</P>
<P>
Drown fought back, maintaining his independence from Duffy while trying hard 
not to criticize his boss or the political contributors who had financed Duffy 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
In the June primary, Roache got 32% of the vote and Drown 28%, eliminating the 
other hopefuls. Many political observers had predicted that Drown and Jimno 
would make the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
While Roache continued to draw parallels between Drown and Duffy, Drown amassed 
law enforcement endorsements and painted himself as the choice of his peers. 
</P>
<P>
Two endorsements were especially surprising: Jimno, out of the race, said he 
supported Drown just months after he had chided the assistant sheriff, and 
Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller, who had made only one local political endorsement in 
20 years, backed Drown last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Although careful not to criticize Duffy directly, Drown said he would work more 
diplomatically with the Board of Supervisors and said he is not a professional 
politician. Both references applied to Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
Although he worked nearly two decades in the Sheriff's Department, Roache 
campaigned hard as an outsider and a reform candidate. He strengthened that 
perception even before he entered the race by suing Duffy to become a 
candidate. Duffy said he would have changed the policy if only Roache had 
asked, but Roache made political hay nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Roache nor Drown backed down from a debate, facing off in more than 60 
forums, from women's club audiences of half a dozen or so to joint appearances 
on TV broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
For all of their dozens of speeches, the two men's positions varied only 
slightly. Both favor the citizens review panel and both oppose a separate 
corrections department. 
</P>
<P>
They agreed that jail crowding could not be solved by the new sheriff alone but 
needs help from county supervisors and new money sources. They said the 
physical abuse of inmates will stop altogether only when a new sheriff 
establishes stricter hiring practices, including better screening methods. 
</P>
<P>
Roache, endorsed by the National Rifle Assn., was more pro-gun than Drown. 
Roache dislikes government interference of any sort in regard to gun control, 
although he said he would uphold any state or national law that calls for a 
waiting period for handgun purchases.

ASIAN ELEPHANTS WARM UP TO POOL AT SAN DIEGO PARK

Connie was the first to test the waters, delicately dipping the tip of her 
trunk into the murky water, much as a person might put in a toe to check the 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
She trumpeted loudly. Then, finally, Connie took the plunge. 
</P>
<P>
She was the bravest of the San Diego Wild Animal Park's seven female Asian 
elephants, edging up cautiously to their plush new pool shortly after being 
released into the compound Monday. The pool is designed to provide a more 
aesthetic and natural environment, as well as to get the pachyderms exercising 
more. 
</P>
<P>
"Nita we would have expected to go in right away because she's the dominant 
elephant, and she's usually the one who goes trying something out before others 
will," said Tom Hanscom, spokesman for the park. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Nita and the others took turns getting wet, only to fling dirt on 
themselves with their trunks once they got out. 
</P>
<P>
"Elephants, when they get wet, they get itchy," elephant program manager Alan 
Roocroft said. 
</P>
<P>
A boulder placed in a clearing in the compound is at a height just right for 
them to scratch their undersides after a swim, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The $100,000 Asian elephant pool, which opened to the public Tuesday, has been 
five months in the making and is the first step toward bringing patrons within 
arm's length of the floppy-eared beasts at the park near Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
It replaces an older, smaller pool and is similar in size to one built for the 
African elephants in a neighboring compound. 
</P>
<P>
The park plans to eventually build a deck reaching to the edge of the wading 
pool and to plant grass in parts of the compound. 
</P>
<P>
The pool and the compound, which includes boulders and ficus and bamboo trees, 
was designed for the convenience and health of the elephants, park employees 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A collage of boulders, some of them weighing six tons, were placed in a pattern 
that makes it impossible for them to be dislodged. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like a jigsaw puzzle," Roocroft said. "We want them to be able to 
get to them and use them as scratching posts, but obviously we don't want them 
to be moving them. Given the right terrain, though, they could move those rocks 
quite easily." 
</P>
<P>
The elephants succeeded in rocking one of the boulders forward, but could not 
pull it out. The pool gives the elephants a chance to swim, something they 
couldn't do in their old pool. 
</P>
<P>
"Elephants don't move normally in captivity, and you've got to find ways to get 
them to exercise," Roocroft said. 
</P>
<P>
The pool, which is nine feet deep and has two entrances, is deep enough to put 
the 8-foot-tall elephants through a healthy workout and is designed to 
accommodate their social structure. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were to build a pool with just one entrance, you may have a dominant 
animal at the entrance keeping a sub-dominant one in or out of the pool," 
Roocroft said.

COUNTY WILL SUE SHERIFF DUFFY ON SECRET ACCOUNT

<P>
Angered that San Diego County Sheriff John Duffy set up a secret account for 
money seized in drug raids, the Board of Supervisors decided Tuesday to file a 
lawsuit to regain control of the money. 
</P>
<P>
The civil lawsuit is expected to be filed today in San Diego Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
The board reached a consensus in closed session to go to court over the matter, 
which has further soured the already strained relationship between supervisors 
and the sheriff, who is retiring from office. 
</P>
<P>
The suit could include a request for a temporary restraining order to prevent 
Duffy from making further allocations from the secret account, county officials 
suggested. 
</P>
<P>
The board wants the court to force Duffy to account for the more than $300,000 
seized in drug raids -- called asset-forfeiture funds -- and return the money 
to the control of the supervisors, said county spokesman Bob Lerner. 
</P>
<P>
County auditors discovered the secret account last week. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy has said in a prepared statement that supervisors have no authority over 
the money. Federal guidelines say such funds can be used only for law 
enforcement purposes. He said the money has been placed in a private account, 
where it has earned "substantial" interest, and disbursements have been 
"minimal." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Brian Bilbray said the board adamantly maintains its position that 
the drug-seizure money belongs to the county government -- not the Sheriff's 
Department -- and that the Board of Supervisors is responsible for those funds. 
</P>
<P>
"The county can be held liable and so we have the right to know what's going on 
with those funds," Bilbray said. "(Duffy) wants to control that money but avoid 
the liability. What he's done is an inappropriate use of funds by any county 
employee. . . . He wants to be exempt from the local review process."

The war had already made her a widow. Now horror threatened again. Communist 
troops were on Saigon's doorstep. The city she was raised in and whose 
kindergarten children she taught was in chaos. It would fall the next day, 
April 30, 1975. Frightened, Theresa Do rushed to the airport with her two young 
daughters, other family members and little else. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans and their military planes were waiting. Final stop was the Marine 
Corps base at Camp Pendleton and the beginning of a new life and a new 
commitment. There were hardships, a painful period of adjustment to curious 
American ways and, over the years, success. It was an immigrant tale of hard 
work, pluck and determination right out of the history books. 
</P>
<P>
While Indochinese refugees faced common obstacles, Do's experience -- both 
personal and through her work at the county welfare department -- told her that 
women refugees often suffered more. They were more prone to isolation, had more 
difficulty adjusting, were more ignored. 
</P>
<P>
And so several years ago, she founded San Diego's Refugee Women's Assn., a 
nonprofit, all-volunteer group unlike any other in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Starting was one thing; getting it going was another. 
</P>
<P>
Among the group's goals are advocating women's rights, women's self-sufficiency 
and women's mutual assistance. In a culture where women were taught to be 
submissive to men, this attempt at coaching American-brand assertiveness was 
viewed with some skepticism, particularly by males. 
</P>
<P>
Do sent out 100 letters inviting women to the first Refugee Women's Assn. 
meeting in 1983. Ninety-nine showed up. The women elected officers and 
volunteered a day a week to take calls. 
</P>
<P>
Today the group has about 400 members, prints 5,000 copies of a monthly, 
multilanguage newsletter and is involved in numerous activities, including 
helping refugee women find jobs and assimilate, providing a friendly ear and 
promoting the preservation of Indochinese culture. 
</P>
<P>
The organization, composed entirely of refugee women, represents four main 
Indochinese communities -- Vietnamese, Laotian, Cambodian and Hmong. 
</P>
<P>
Through its newsletter, the group presses the Indochinese community at large to 
recognize its responsibility to help new arrivals. It also has urged those who 
provide health care to give special attention to women who have suffered 
lifelong emotional trauma after being raped and sexually abused during their 
refugee journey. 
</P>
<P>
"Refugees have lots of problems but only their own people can help them 
emotionally," Do said, citing a key reason for her group. "Only our people can 
understand the (native) way of life and things. We understand our own people 
better." 
</P>
<P>
The organization goes about its work quietly, ringing up small but important 
accomplishments for those inside the Indochinese community. For example, it 
printed 20,000 911-emergency calling cards in four Indochinese languages 
telling refugees how to ask for a policeman, a fire truck or an ambulance, a 
task recognized by the city in 1988 when Mayor Maureen O'Connor presented Do 
and her group with a special award. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Rumbaut, a San Diego State University sociologist and expert on 
Indochinese affairs who directs the nation's longest-running study of refugee 
settlement in the United States, said it is hard to overestimate the importance 
of groups like the Refugee Women's Assn. that work within the refugee community 
and provide leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"Our own research has shown the pivotal role of women in the refugee 
community," he said. "Official policies tend to miss that and instead focus on 
the husband or the head of household. The message is that women are somehow 
less important. In my opinion, that's misbegotten. It's bad policy because it 
ignores the absolutely central role of women in helping families meet their 
economic and emotional needs." 
</P>
<P>
It's estimated that nearly 50,000 Indochinese live in San Diego County, 
including about 30,000 Vietnamese, he said. Rumbaut says the county is now home 
to the largest Laotian community in the United States, numbering 12,000 to 
15,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
To understand the Refugee Women's Assn., it helps to know Do, a small, tautly 
muscled woman of 50. She often wears the ao doi, the traditional dress of 
Vietnam. Her delicate features and gracious manners mask a fierce energy. 
</P>
<P>
She needed every ounce when she arrived at Camp Pendleton penniless and with 
barely passable English. She came with nearly 20 of her brothers and sisters 
and her parents. The rest of her siblings -- 23 in all -- would be part of the 
leaky armada of boats that later fled Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Do was educated in Catholic schools and was relatively well-off. She was a 
kindergarten teacher in Saigon and also taught French to high school students, 
skills that didn't count for much in her new country. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the first wave of refugees, most in her family were able to find 
work as dishwashers and waiters and such. 
</P>
<P>
She eventually heard about a job at the county welfare department, which was 
beginning to feel the effects of the sudden Vietnamese migration. Do was hired 
as a case aide, the lowest job on the ladder, and became the first Vietnamese 
refugee hired by the county. Her job: to translate for other refugees seeking 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know how to speak well. I used sign language, I wrote things down on 
paper, I did what I could to make them understand me," she recalls today, her 
accent thick but her words clear and precise. 
</P>
<P>
To learn and improve her English, Do went to night classes at Hoover High 
School in San Diego. She also took work-related training classes and began 
taking and passing various job exams. She became an eligibility worker and kept 
on going. It took three years, working full time during the day and attending 
classes at night, but in 1983, Do earned a master's degree in social work from 
San Diego State University. 
</P>
<P>
It was while working at the county and doing her thesis work on homebound 
Vietnamese women refugees that Do became convinced she needed to help in some 
organized way. 
</P>
<P>
"(Indochinese) women would come to my office at the county all the time. I knew 
their problems and their needs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Do's work has attracted attention. 
</P>
<P>
She was named to the state Department of Education's Advisory Council on Asian 
and Pacific Islander Affairs; she received a migrant and refugee services award 
from the federal government; she conducts a Vietnamese cultural awareness class 
at the Police Academy; she speaks to groups of new refugees, and she promotes 
Indochinese culture to young American-born sons and daughters of refugee 
parents, an effort she says is very important to the Indochinese community's 
long-term stability.

Amnesty International issued two reports quoting first-person reports of 
torture, political arrests and extralegal executions in Myanmar, formerly 
Burma. "Overwhelming evidence of torture and extrajudicial execution on a large 
scale became available" from those fleeing recent government repression, a 
55-page report of the human rights organization said. A four-page report said 
the military junta continued to arrest political leaders as late as last month.

An Election Day storm dumped heavy snow on the Rockies and left highways 
slippery on the western Plains. 
</P>
<P>
"In some counties we've had trouble even getting poll workers to the polls to 
open them up," Nebraska Secretary of State Allen Beermann said. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy snow fell across parts of Wyoming from late Monday into Tuesday. Snowfall 
totals ranged up to 17 inches at Sinks Canyon, 7 miles southwest of Lander; 13 
inches at Lander; 12 inches at Togwotee Pass, 40 miles northeast of Jackson; 
and up to a foot at Casper. Casper Mountain got nearly 3 feet of snow in 30 
hours, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
In Colorado, the National Weather Service said snow increased in coverage and 
intensity in Denver and other Front Range areas during the morning rush hour. 
The snow was driven by wind blowing at 15 to 25 m.p.h., cutting visibility. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado ski resorts benefited, with Winter Park getting up to 10 inches Monday 
and Steamboat Springs 8 inches. Meteorologists said accumulations of 6 to 12 
inches were possible in Colorado's northern and central mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Freezing drizzle iced roads near the Colorado-Kansas line. 
</P>
<P>
Western and north-central Nebraska was hit by snow, rain, wind and cold, and 
many voters needed chains on their car tires just to get to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Most of western Nebraska was covered with 2 to 3 inches of snow, with reports 
of up to 5 inches on the ground in Kimball and 7 inches at O'Neill, said Larry 
Wirth of the weather service office in Scottsbluff. Twelve inches fell at 
Greeley in the north-central part of the state, the weather service said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's snowing some and the wind is blowing and it's cold and icy," said Lincoln 
County Clerk Nadine Heath at midmorning. "I understand in the rural areas it's 
really hard to see." 
</P>
<P>
Another storm dumped up to 8 inches of snow on Michigan's northern Lower 
Peninsula and caused scattered power outages from Monday into early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
State police said snow forced the closing of at least four school districts. 
</P>
<P>
A state police dispatcher at Alpena reported several minor traffic accidents. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still snowing and blowing and it's probably 7 or 8 inches deep close to 
town and as you go out from the town it gets a little deeper," dispatcher 
George Beebe said early Tuesday. "A pretty good percentage of the city is 
without power." 
</P>
<P>
Just four days earlier, Michigan had a spell of Indian summer, making the storm 
hard to take, said hairdresser Michelle Collins in Houghton Lake. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't expecting it. We had such a nice week," she said. "From what the 
customers are saying coming in, it's pretty bad, a lot of sleet, a lot of cars 
in ditches." 
</P>
<P>
Wind gusting to more than 60 m.p.h. whipped through Upstate New York on 
Tuesday, downing trees and power lines. A peak gust of 63 m.p.h. was recorded 
at Buffalo, the weather service said. 
</P>
<P>
In Monroe County, N.Y., where wind was recorded at 59 m.p.h., officials 
reported numerous power outages and trees falling on cars and houses. No 
injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
About a third of a church under construction in Pittsford collapsed, but no one 
was there at the time. 
</P>
<P>
At least 20,000 homes lost power from southern New York state to Niagara Falls. 
All but a few hundred had been restored by noon, said E. Alfred Osborne, a 
spokesman for Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Wind-whipped waves reached 8 feet on Lake Erie and 10 feet or higher on Lake 
Ontario. Minor flooding was reported along the Lake Erie shoreline south of 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
High wind also buffeted parts of Maine, along with heavy rain. Cape Elizabeth 
and the Portland area were lashed with wind averaging 30 m.p.h. and gusts as 
high as 45 m.p.h.

DEMOCRATS POISED TO TAKE TOP POSTS IN 3 STATES; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNORS: REPUBLICAN MARTINEZ CONCEDES TO CHILES IN FLORIDA. GOP EXPECTED TO 
LOSE CONTROL OF OKLAHOMA AND KANSAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Early results showed Democrats on the way to capturing crucial governorships 
Tuesday, as the party won Florida and appeared poised to wrest control of 
Oklahoma and Kansas from the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
But both parties continued to sweat out results from the richest prizes on the 
ballot: the California governor's race between Republican Sen. Pete Wilson and 
former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein and the explosive Texas struggle 
between Democrat Ann Richards and Republican businessman Clayton W. Williams 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
In Florida, with 7% of the vote counted, former Democratic Sen. Lawton Chiles 
led incumbent GOP Gov. Bob Martinez 55% to 45%. Martinez conceded defeat. 
</P>
<P>
In Kansas, with only 1% of the vote in, Democrat Joan Finney led Republican 
Gov. Mike Hayden 59% to 41%, and a CNN survey of voters leaving polling places 
indicated she was running very strongly. 
</P>
<P>
In Oklahoma, where Republican Gov. Henry Bellmon is stepping down, Democrat 
David Walters led GOP candidate Bill Price 59% to 41% with 8% of the vote 
counted. 
</P>
<P>
For Republicans, the best early news came from Massachusetts, where exit polls 
showed former U.S. Atty. William F. Weld running strongly against Democrat John 
R. Silber. 
</P>
<P>
With the decennial redistricting of congressional seats impending, both parties 
devoted unusually heavy attention to governor's races this year. Democrats went 
into the election holding 29 of the nation's 50 governorships, Republicans 21. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, 36 governor's seats were contested Tuesday -- 20 of them currently 
held by Democrats, 16 by Republicans. These included some of the year's most 
closely watched campaigns. In particular, the battles for control of Florida, 
Texas and California -- the three states expected to gain the most new 
congressional seats in next year's reapportionment -- drew enormous national 
focus and set spending records. 
</P>
<P>
Both the California and Texas races are expected to cost over $45 million when 
all the bills are totaled, with Williams and Wilson each topping $25 million. 
In Florida, the totals were lower, largely because Chiles refused to accept 
contributions greater than $100. 
</P>
<P>
For Republicans, the Florida race became a long-shot as soon as Chiles entered 
the contest earlier this year. After a bruising primary victory over Rep. Bill 
Nelson, Chiles virtually coasted to victory over Martinez, who had suffered 
through a rocky first term. 
</P>
<P>
Stressing his refusal to accept large contributions, Chiles successfully 
converted the race into a referendum on big-money, slick-media campaigns, 
offering relatively few specifics about how he would govern the state. In an 
interview last week, Chiles said he hoped his anti-campaign would serve as a 
model for other states. "Everything works the old way until somebody changes 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If Florida pointed toward a different style of politics, the Texas 
gubernatorial race became this year's paradigm of modern slash-and-burn 
campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
At the outset of the campaigning, Williams, the West Texas oilman who won the 
Republican nomination largely on the strength of his slick ad campaign, held a 
double digit lead over Richards, the state treasurer whose image was tarnished 
during the down and dirty Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
Williams lead remained large until early October, when his campaign began to 
fray at the edges, almost completely because of the Republican's own verbal 
gaffes. 
</P>
<P>
When told of a Richards' claim that she trailed by only five percentage points, 
Williams replied: "I hope she hasn't started drinking again." Richards is a 
recovering alcoholic who says she has not had a drink in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Then, at an event in which both candidates appeared in Dallas, Williams refused 
to shake Richards' hand and accused her of being a liar. In late October, while 
being interviewed on a Dallas television station, Williams confessed ignorance 
to a proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot, even though he had 
already voted absentee. Finally, last Friday, the millionaire rancher disclosed 
that he had paid no taxes in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
All this raised fears in Texas that Williams would prove an embarrassment as 
governor; in the days before the election several Republicans publicly worried 
that he might turn out to be another Evan Mecham, a reference to the volatile 
Arizona governor impeached in 1988. Over the last weekend, Williams ran ads 
acknowledging that he made mistakes during the campaign. But his propensity for 
them gave Democrats unexpected new life in the days before the vote, despite 
several appearances on Williams' behalf by President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Verbal fireworks also dominated the gubernatorial race in Massachusetts, where 
tart-tongued Democrat Silber polarized the electorate with a series of acerbic 
remarks dubbed "Silber shockers." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than hurting Silber, many of his intemperate remarks reinforced his 
image as an angry man willing to speak the truth in tough times. Some Democrats 
began to tout Silber as a future national leader of the party, and perhaps even 
a presidential candidate. But last week Silber declared that two-income couples 
were guilty of a form of "child neglect," and his support began to erode. 
</P>
<P>
Holding a nine-point lead in surveys last week, Silber found himself in a dead 
heat on the election's eve.

Gov. Joseph Ada won reelection Tuesday, becoming the first gubernatorial 
incumbent to win consecutive terms in this U.S. territory. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican Ada and his running mate, Lt. Gov. Frank Blas, defeated 
Democratic challenger Madeleine Bordallo and her running mate, Jose (Ping) 
Duenas.

A drug used to reduce the risk of recurrences in about half of breast cancer 
patients may also help the other half, as well as people with other types of 
cancer, researchers said. A new study by Dr. Michael Pollak, an assistant 
professor of oncology and medicine at McGill University in Montreal, published 
in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, found the drug, tamoxifen, 
apparently reduces levels of a protein that promotes the growth of cancer 
cells.

School bus schedules were thrown into disarray in Miami when at least 70% of 
the county's 300 drivers honored a boycott called by black religious leaders in 
protest of the Dade County School Board's choice of a superintendent. Several 
students and teachers also followed the boycott, staged because the board 
passed over Tee S. Greer, a black man with more than 30 years experience in the 
school system, and chose a Cuban who has been in the department about seven

IMMIGRANTS CHERISH NEW FREEDOMS ACHIEVED UNDER AMNESTY PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Viviana Holguin's adult English class in Boyle Heights is any indication, 
the real success of the government's landmark amnesty program in Los Angeles is 
measured in the intangibles of everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
The students said Tuesday that qualifying for amnesty has put an extra bounce 
in their steps and given them a confident air as they go about the smallest of 
tasks, such as going to the grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
"I do everything now with a little bit of confidence that I never had before," 
said Juan Manuel Tenorio, echoing the feelings of fellow classmates who are 
studying English and U.S. history to complete their 40 hours of class work 
required for permanent residency. 
</P>
<P>
"I go to the store without looking over my shoulder. I don't worry about 
hassles at work. I'm very calm these days. I now know I have rights in this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
The students' observations -- aired as they grappled with an English grammar 
class at the nonprofit One Stop Immigration &amp; Educational Center -- added a 
personal dimension to the findings of a two-year independent study released 
Tuesday that generally praised the amnesty efforts of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In the report, the Santa Monica-based RAND Corp. and Urban Institute of 
Washington, D.C., concluded that the INS overcame the historic mistrust in 
Southern California's burgeoning immigrant communities to persuade nearly 1 
million aliens in Los Angeles and the surrounding counties to sign up for 
amnesty. An estimated 3.1 million applied nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The report credited the agency with setting up an aggressive public relations 
campaign and community-based offices to accept amnesty applications from 
eligible aliens who could prove they had lived illegally in the United States 
before Jan. 1, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of INS efforts, more aliens signed up in Los Angeles than anywhere 
else in the country, the study concluded. 
</P>
<P>
While the 117-page report used cumbersome language to explain the Los Angeles 
program's success, the 30 students in Holguin's class said it was the little 
things that made amnesty a success for them. 
</P>
<P>
Words such as soy libre ("I am free") and confianza ("confidence") frequently 
popped out in their comments. 
</P>
<P>
"With this status, I can feel free to do what I want," said 30-year-old Dimas 
Rivera. "I can help my people freely." 
</P>
<P>
Tenorio, 27, explained that the amnesty program even affected a decision 
whether to leave his Eastside home for a stroll with his two preschool 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, I couldn't even leave the house sometimes because I was afraid of la 
migra," he said, using the Spanish slang term for the immigration service. "I 
don't have to worry now. I go everywhere now with confidence. What's to worry 
about?" 
</P>
<P>
"But the most important," interjected fellow Mexican native Jose Vargas, 26, 
"is that we are no longer afraid. Not at work. Not walking down the street. 
Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Vargas, like others in the class, is hoping that the legal U.S. residency 
gained through amnesty will allow them the opportunity to legally bring members 
of their immediate families to this country. 
</P>
<P>
"I want my family here with me," said Vargas, who works for a janitorial 
service. "It's bad enough when you're alone and scared." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the amnesty applicants said the program also meant more pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
Furniture store worker Heriberto Sorieno, a native of the Mexican state of 
Zacatecas, said his hourly wage shot up from $6 an hour to $8.50, partly 
because his boss felt that he was worth more money since the threat of 
deportation no longer hung over him. 
</P>
<P>
"More money puts more food on the table and pays for other things," Sorieno 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the confidence and other intangibles gained through amnesty quickly 
evaporated as Holguin led her English class through the complex world of 
prepositional phrases. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, Marta," began Holguin, a junior math major at UCLA. "What's correct? Do 
you take sugar in your coffee?" 
</P>
<P>
Marta, faltering while listening to whispering near her seat, struggled for a 
bit but finally offered up the correct answer in English. "Yes," she said 
quietly. 
</P>
<P>
It was not lost on any of the students on Tuesday -- Election Day -- that they 
one day could also participate as U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a very major benefit," said Ofelia Torres, who held her baby daughter, 
Myra, during class. "You can have more benefits as a citizen and voting is one 
benefit I want to have." 
</P>
<P>
Added classmate Sorieno, "No one can take advantage of you, truly, if you're a 
citizen."

DEPUTY DENIES STEALING DRUG CASH BUT SAYS HE AND OTHERS SUSPECTED CAPTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MERINA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The first defendant took the stand Tuesday in the corruption trial of seven Los 
Angeles County sheriff's narcotics deputies and flatly denied that he stole 
money during drug raids, but testified that he once suspected his captain of 
skimming drug cash. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Daniel M. Garner, who is accused with his fellow defendants of stealing 
$1.4 million from drug traffickers and money launderers, told federal jurors 
that he and other deputies confronted Capt. Robert Wilber with their suspicions 
after a 1987 drug raid. 
</P>
<P>
Garner said he and other members of an elite narcotics investigations team had 
confiscated nearly "a million dollars" in cash during the raid when Wilber 
appeared at the scene and told his deputies he would take the money in his own 
car to narcotics headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"The captain took the box of money and left," said Garner, who added that 
Wilber arrived late at the bureau headquarters in Whittier to book the money 
into evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"It was in violation of everything we had been told and of his own edict," 
Garner said of Wilber's decision to transport the money alone. 
</P>
<P>
When the deputies later looked at the box of money, some cash appeared to be 
missing, Garner said. The deputies confronted Wilber, who denied skimming money 
but said he erred in transporting it by himself, Garner testified. 
</P>
<P>
Wilber, who headed the narcotics bureau for four years, now is chief of the 
Sheriff's Department Aerobureau. Asked about Garner's testimony, he told The 
Times that he is aware of the theft allegation but that an FBI investigation 
cleared him of any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
"I shouldn't have taken that money alone," Wilber said, "but I was a unit 
commander. I was the boss, and it never occurred to me that anyone would think 
I would ever take anything." 
</P>
<P>
Wilber said he never stole any money and that the FBI probe showed "there is no 
substance" to the allegation. He declined to provide any specifics of the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI could not be reached for comment. But Wilber's statement was the first 
confirmation that investigators had looked at any officers beyond lower-ranking 
deputies and sergeants in the corruption probe. 
</P>
<P>
As the first defendant to testify, Garner sought to blunt federal prosecutors' 
efforts to portray him and the other deputies as co-conspirators in a theft 
ring. Asked by his attorney, Harland Braun, if he ever stole any money from 
drug dealers or from evidence lockers, Garner replied, "No." 
</P>
<P>
"Did you take any money unlawfully?" Braun then asked. 
</P>
<P>
"No," the deputy replied in a firm voice. 
</P>
<P>
Before resting their case on Tuesday, prosecutors had called 155 witnesses in 
an effort to show that Garner and the others not only stole money but spent it 
on condos, automobiles, jewelry and other luxuries. 
</P>
<P>
Garner, however, sought to show that he obtained thousands of dollars in 
outside income from a car restoration business as well as sizable cash gifts 
from relatives and family friends. The car business, which included buying and 
selling cars at local auto swap meets, involved handling large sums of cash, 
Garner said. 
</P>
<P>
A family friend, Ronald Moore, testified Tuesday that his father was like a 
surrogate father to Garner and gave the deputy $20,000 in cash in 1987 that he 
had kept in a bag in a freezer. Moore said his father, who was dying of cancer, 
kept the money in the freezer because he did not trust banks and other 
financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Garner said he followed that example in keeping large sums of cash in his own 
home.

CAR PLOWS THROUGH WALL OF DMV OFFICE; 
</P>
<P>
ACCIDENT: DRIVER WAS GOING TO TAKE TEST TO RENEW HIS LICENSE. DOZENS DIVE FOR 
COVER AS HE AND SIX OTHERS ARE INJURED.

<P>
A 72-year-old man waiting to take a driving test Tuesday accidentally plowed 
his car through a wall and into a Department of Motor Vehicles office in Canoga 
Park, injuring himself and six others, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the injuries, including those to the driver, John Anderson of Reseda, 
were life-threatening, authorities said. DMV officials said about 80 employees 
and customers were in the office at the time. Damage was estimated at $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
DMV Investigator Steve Torres said the accident occurred about 10 a.m. in the 
DMV office at 20725 Sherman Way after Anderson, who has an unblemished driving 
record dating back to 1948, pulled his car into a line for those taking driving 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
As Anderson moved his car forward, it lurched out of control, Torres said. The 
car made a wide circle, hit a hedge and jumped a curb before smashing through 
the brick wall of the one-story building. 
</P>
<P>
The car pushed aside file cabinets and furniture, sending those in the building 
scrambling for safety. The vehicle stopped beneath an eye exam chart and a sign 
that reads, "Report Here for Drive Test." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said he lost control of the car when the accelerator jammed. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pulling up to my spot to wait and the throttle stuck," Anderson said. "I 
put on the brakes. What I should have done is turned off the ignition, but I 
guess I panicked." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson was visibly shaken and slightly bruised but declined medical 
treatment, DMV officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Louella Traub, who works at the eye exam desk, said she "saw the wall coming in 
and thought, 'Oh my God, a car is coming through.' 
</P>
<P>
"I got up and jumped. I made a dive out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
Traub said she bruised her leg in her dive for safety. The desk where she had 
been working was smashed and pushed 10 feet by the car. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Kolterman, manager of the DMV office, said she was in a conference room 
when she heard the screeching of tires and hurried to the public area as the 
car crashed into the office. 
</P>
<P>
"I came out and the car drove right past me," she said. "Everything here can be 
put together again. We're just . . . very blessed that no one was killed." 
</P>
<P>
The incident is being investigated by the State Police, who have jurisdiction 
over state office buildings. Anderson was not cited for any driving violation, 
but officials said the investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
Those hospitalized were Beatrice Archers, 71, who was dragged beneath the 
vehicle, and Ham Nguyen, 49. Both were reported in stable condition Tuesday. 
Archer was at Humana Hospital West Hills and Nguyen at Kaiser-Permanente 
Hospital in Woodland Hills. Others injured included DMV employees Traub, 61; 
Elaine Moschin, 55; Don Swearingen, 52, and Gail Kahn, 37, who suffered bruises 
or cuts but were not hospitalized, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
DMV spokesman Bill Gengler said the office will remain closed until at least 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said he had come to the DMV office to renew his license. DMV 
regulations require drivers over 70 to take an eye examination and written test 
for license renewal. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson was also required to take a driving test because, when he tried to get 
his license renewed earlier, he was told he needed glasses. 
</P>
<P>
As work crews began cleaning up the mess, Anderson was having second thoughts 
about motoring. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care if I ever drive again." he said.

FREEWAY COMPLAINT WAS ALMOST FATAL FOR LA MESA DRIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rented black Chevy Cavalier came out of nowhere, lurching across all four 
lanes of northbound Interstate 5 in Del Mar like a high-speed shoelace 
threading a shoe. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley Steele remembers the driver well, his wiry frame and a baseball cap 
worn backward. But it was the reckless driving that struck him most -- how the 
sedan ventured onto both shoulders to pass cars. And how it barely missed 
driving Steele's Volkswagen Rabbit right off the road. 
</P>
<P>
"My girlfriend thought we should write down his license number," Steele 
recalled of the Sunday afternoon incident. "But I said, 'No, maybe he's on his 
way to the hospital or something.' That's the way I am." 
</P>
<P>
When Steele pulled off the freeway, to the end of the circular exit ramp at Via 
de la Valle, however, he spotted the black sedan with the rent-a-car sticker 
sitting in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
That's when the 29-year-old La Mesa drywaller decided to have a word with this 
reckless driver. It was a snap decision that made Steele another kind of 
statistic -- a victim of the continuing waves of freeway violence in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
But Steele was lucky, because his story has a third main character: a passerby 
who saved his life. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before 3 p.m., Steele stepped out of his car and approached the 
motorist, saying, "Hey, don't you think you better watch how you're driving?" 
</P>
<P>
The answer was an 8-inch hunting knife, which the motorist wielded, severing 
Steele's femoral artery, in the groin area. His attacker stabbed him six more 
times in the back and chest as Steele struggled helplessly, face-down on the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as the occupants of a dozen other vehicles at the red light looked on in 
horror -- behind closed windows and locked doors -- the motorist and a woman 
companion sped off, leaving a bleeding Steele for dead. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Steele's girlfriend, Barbara Lay, screamed in panic, a visiting Santa 
Ana cardiologist in search of a restroom for his two young children took the 
emergency steps that saved a man's life. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jerrold Cantor immediately stuck his hands inside the wound to stop the 
pulsating blood flow from Steele's groin and the numerous gashes in his back 
until paramedics arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"That doctor saved my life, there's no doubt about it," Steele said Tuesday 
from his bed at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla. "Some crazy guy tries to 
kill me, and then he comes along and says, 'I'm a doctor and I can help you.' 
</P>
<P>
"He stuck his hands right in the wound to step the bleeding. And he told the 
paramedics exactly what was wrong with me so we didn't waste time. If he hadn't 
come along, I don't think I would have survived." 
</P>
<P>
Three years after the scary summer of 1987, when California freeways made 
national headlines as a place where armed and outraged motorists unleashed 
their wrath on each other, freeway violence continues to plague San Diego 
County and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
In August, as his father watched helplessly from a trailing car, 19-year-old 
Armando Gill was killed when a car pulled up alongside his pickup on Interstate 
805 near downtown and fired two shotgun blasts at his head. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, two San Diego teen-agers were shot to death on I-805 by an 
assailant who riddled their car with bullets. 
</P>
<P>
And last week, a motorist was shot in killed as he drove along the I-405 
freeway in Orange County, according to CHP officers. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, the California Highway Patrol has received thousands of reports 
statewide involving gunshots, brandished weapons, fistfights, egg and rock 
throwing and rammed vehicles along busy traffic arteries. 
</P>
<P>
"We get more than 50 freeway-violence reports a month from San Diego and Orange 
counties alone," said Officer John Marinez, a CHP spokesman. "It's a real 
problem because the numbers remain consistent. And we've put more officers on 
the road because of it." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities offer many explanations for the violence. American society 
increasingly condones violence, they say. And cars offer anonymity, a feeling 
of power and a chance to escape, lowering inhibitions to aggression. 
</P>
<P>
Also, specially in Southern California, rush hour has turned into creep hour, 
raising drivers' frustrations and blood pressures. Inevitably, something snaps. 
</P>
<P>
"We all face it every day," said Bill Robinson, a spokesman for the San Diego 
Police Department. "People flip each other off, and sometimes it gets more 
violent. . . . While it's sometimes difficult advice to follow, the best thing 
to do is clench your teeth and stay inside your car." 
</P>
<P>
For Bradley Steele, about as far as he thought of freeway violence was tapping 
his brake lights in defiance of drivers who blind him with their high beams. 
</P>
<P>
But, even in five years driving 18-wheel tractor trailers he never gestured at 
any driver who cut him off. None of that violent stuff was going to happen to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not something I planned on happening," he said. "Unfortunately, I look 
at others like I look at myself. And I don't have a rage inside me that would 
make me want to kill someone over a traffic disagreement. I guess I was wrong 
about this guy." 
</P>
<P>
All too quickly, he recalled, a Sunday afternoon trip to a ski equipment show 
at the Del Mar Fairgrounds, turned decidely ugly. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never have done that if I was downtown or in Chula Vista or 
something," said Steele, a muscular man who one day wants to become a 
firefighter. "But I was in Del Mar, not the scroungy part of town." 
</P>
<P>
Steele insists he didn't provoke the driver after he whizzed past him on the 
freeway. He thought the guy was a young tourist, and he just wanted to tell him 
to slow down while visiting San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
As he stepped from his car, he remembers the motorist eyeing him through his 
side-view mirror. Then, without saying a word, the guy jumped out and walked 
quickly toward him. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like he was in a rage, sort of," Steele recalled. "He didn't say 
anything. He just kept coming like he was going to walk right through me." 
</P>
<P>
As Steele put up his hands in defense, the man brought the knife up from behind 
him, slashing the femoral artery. "I felt this thick feeling, like something 
that's in your body that isn't yours," he said. "Then I got all warm and wet." 
</P>
<P>
Steele recalls seeing the faces of the occupants of nearby cars, looking on as 
the man stood over him, stabbed repeatedly. Finally, he yelled out. "I've been 
stabbed." 
</P>
<P>
As a friend in a trailing car arrived to help, the motorist sped off. It was 
only then that people left their cars to look after him, Steele recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't expect anyone to get out of their cars," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's this guy wielding this big knife against a total stranger. And they're 
supposed to get out and tell him to stop?" 
</P>
<P>
Police later found the bloodied knife a short distance away and are still 
searching for the man. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jerrold Cantor remembers the black sedan cutting off cars on the freeway. 
But he didn't witness the stabbing. The Orange County cardiologist was too busy 
looking for a restroom during a weekend visit to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
That's when he saw Steele sprawled by the roadside, blood pouring from his 
groin. He remembers Steele's girlfriend screaming something about him dying as 
Steele sat silently in the road. 
</P>
<P>
Then he went to work covering the holes in a dying man's body while his wife 
called for help on their cellular phone. With the help of a medical intern who 
also happened upon the scene, Cantor kept Steele alive until paramedics arrived 
10 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that if I didn't get him to lie on his side and stop the bleeding from 
the femoral artery, he was going to die," Cantor said. 
</P>
<P>
Cantor, 46, had never seen someone outside a hospital so close to death. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what you train for," he said. "This is what medicine is all about." 
</P>
<P>
The incident, however, has given Cantor pause over the continued specter of 
freeway violence. 
</P>
<P>
As he drove home, his shirt and pants still covered with blood, he fielded a 
barrage of questions from his children, aged 6 and 8. "They wanted to know why 
people stabbed each other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them that, when you drive a car, you can't take things personally. You 
can't hold grudges. And I told them how it was important to help people in 
need, to do the kinds of things you'd like someone to do for you one day." 
</P>
<P>
Cantor's children weren't the only ones shaken up over the incident. So was he. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes you wonder what's going on out there," he said. "Someday, your kids 
will be out there on the road, and they don't understand this kind of behavior. 
I hope they never have to." 
</P>
<P>
Steele is sure of one thing. That's the last time he's going to get out of his 
car to confront another driver -- for any reason. For now, though, he'll stay 
in his hospital bed, recovering from the stab wounds that doctors say almost 
made him a paraplegic. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I had a real bad piece of luck," he said, shaking his head. "When you 
think about about how many people are out there driving." 
</P>
<P>
Then he stopped himself. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'd known I was going to run into him, I would have stayed home and gotten 
the flu or something."

ELECTIONS: SUPERVISORS; 
</P>
<P>
HOWARD BUILDS SLIM LEAD IN 4TH DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a bitter campaign that literally pitted neighbor against neighbor, Vicky 
Howard took a slim early lead Tuesday night over aggressive challenger Bill 
Davis in the 4th District supervisorial race. 
</P>
<P>
Howard, 55, outpolled fellow Simi Valley council member and next-door neighbor 
Davis in the early returns after a race characterized by personal attacks and 
charges of unethical campaigning by both sides. 
</P>
<P>
Howard, who spent the evening at home with friends and family, was cautiously 
optimistic about her lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not there yet, but we're certainly going in the right direction," she 
said. "The lead is so small I wouldn't have any confidence in the numbers right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he was confident that he was going to win despite the early returns, 
"but it's going to be very close. . . . It comes down to the kind of campaign 
voters want to see." 
</P>
<P>
Howard and Davis ran tough, bitter campaigns in their struggle to replace 
retiring incumbent Jim Dougherty as supervisor for the 4th District, which 
includes Simi Valley, Moorpark, Somis and the Santa Clara Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the campaign, Howard emphasized her extensive government experience. 
In addition to her eight years on the City Council, Howard has served four 
years on the County Transportation Commission and two years on the Local Agency 
Formation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Davis has served four years on the City Council and one year on the Planning 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Howard and Davis emerged from a field of five candidates in the June primary to 
qualify for a runoff, with Howard collecting 39.6% of the vote to Davis' 25.4%. 
</P>
<P>
In the months that followed, Davis campaigned vigorously to close the gap, 
raising nearly $13,000 more in contributions than Howard and hiring a political 
consultant to boost his campaign. According to campaign financial statements, 
Davis raised $88,112 since January and spent $89,409 in the race. Howard raised 
$77,169 and spent $76,150. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the two candidates agreed on the issues. Both opposed the 
proposed merger of Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric 
Co., and both backed a proposal for Simi Valley to annex property owned by 
entertainer Bob Hope. 
</P>
<P>
Both have said they are moderate on growth and both have accepted large 
contributions from developers. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton said the primary difference between the two is 
Howard's conservative philosophy. He said if push came to shove, Davis would be 
more likely to raise taxes, but Howard would cut services. 
</P>
<P>
With little difference on the issues, the candidates focused most of their time 
and energy questioning each other's ethics and qualifications for the job. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a Democrat, and Howard, a Republican, accused each other of misleading 
voters by distributing or allowing the distribution of campaign mailers that 
were specifically addressed to voters whose party affiliations were different 
than their own. The mailers failed to mention the candidates' party 
affiliations. Both denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Howard also criticized Davis for initially refusing to authorize release of his 
service record as a Culver City police officer more than 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said his personnel record was his own business. He said he served as a 
police officer for seven months in 1950 but resigned after witnessing the death 
of a young boy hit by a car. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said Howard had known the story for years and was outraged by her attempt 
to cast doubts on his credibility. Just days before the election, Davis 
announced that he would authorize release of his police record, but Howard 
decided not to pursue the issue after Culver City officials said they do not 
keep personnel records for more than 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Howard, who was endorsed by Ventura County Sheriff John V. Gillespie and Dist. 
Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, denied knowing the reason why Davis quit the Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it was Howard who lured Davis into politics 10 years ago, 
encouraging him to join a neighborhood council group. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Howard recommended Davis for a seat on the city's Planning Commission 
and a year later supported his appointment to the City Council.

INCUMBENTS MCCLINTOCK, LAGOMARSINO REELECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Apparently undaunted by any anti-incumbent sentiment, state and federal 
lawmakers representing Ventura County were sweeping to victory in Tuesday's 
election, incomplete results showed. 
</P>
<P>
Despite fear of a backlash from angry voters, the incumbents' superior 
fund-raising abilities and name identification seemed to outweigh any political 
disadvantage of being associated with budget troubles and political scandals in 
Washington or Sacramento. And, with one exception, area incumbents represent 
districts crafted to favor their own political party. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats considered Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) vulnerable this 
year because he narrowly escaped defeat in 1988 in a district that has 23,000 
more Democratic voters than Republican. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, with voter turnout slightly higher than expected, Lagomarsino led Democrat 
Anita Perez Ferguson by a substantial margin in the 19th Congressional District 
that includes western Ventura County and all of Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino criticized his opponent for running a "far too negative" campaign. 
"She shouldn't have attacked my integrity and claimed that I have a bad 
environmental record when I don't," the congressman said. 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino, a political survivor of 34 years in public office, successfully 
blunted Ferguson's attacks on his environmental record with radio and 
television advertisements that trumpeted his role in passing a newly 
strengthened Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
Mindy Lorenz of Ventura, from the fledgling Green Party, a new peace and 
ecology party, ran a distant third as a write-in candidate. Lorenz was the 
Green Party's first congressional candidate in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks), facing the toughest opponent in 
his eight years in office, appeared headed for victory in the 36th Assembly 
district that includes Thousand Oaks, Camarillo, Moorpark, Port Hueneme and 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 51% of voters in McClintock's district are Republican, helping build his 
lead over Democrat Ginny Connell, chairwoman of the county's Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see a little more balance in the way districts are drawn so it 
is possible to upset an incumbent," Connell said. She said she was pleased with 
her campaign's progress and vowed to run again or help someone else challenge 
McClintock. "It's been a good beginning," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Originally dismissed as a lost cause by Democratic officials, Connell impressed 
members of her own party with a spirited campaign that attacked McClintock for 
not supporting abortion rights, the environment or Democratic efforts to 
improve education. 
</P>
<P>
McClintock ran a low-key campaign, emphasizing his efforts to protect taxpayers 
from additional taxes and curb spending of the Democratic majority in the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) and Assemblyman Jack O'Connell 
(D-Carpinteria) appeared on the verge of lopsided victories over their 
under-financed Republican challengers, Carey Rogers and Connie O'Shaughnessy. 
</P>
<P>
Both incumbent legislators represent districts that have at least 20,000 more 
voters registered Democratic than Republican. But they differed greatly in 
their approach to reelection. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell campaigned aggressively in the 35th Assembly District that includes 
Oxnard, even though O'Shaughnessy has been distracted from a forceful challenge 
since the Santa Barbara fire devastated the grounds of her 4 1/2-acre Santa 
Barbara estate. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hart spent little time on campaign matters, he said, after 
recognizing that his Republican opponent failed to raise enough money to send a 
policy mailer to even a fraction of the 326,000 voters in his district that 
stretches across Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties. 
</P>
<P>
Incomplete results showed the same strong margins of victory for Rep. Elton 
Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) and Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley). Both 
lawmakers had tough battles in the Republican primary in June. 
</P>
<P>
Once past that hurdle, both had an easier time in their districts, where more 
than 52% of the voters are registered Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been the shortest campaign of my life," said Gallegly, who was 
challenged by Democrat Richard Freiman, an attorney from Agoura Hills. Tied up 
in Washington on budget matters until last week, Gallegly spent only the past 
six days campaigning in the district that includes Eastern Ventura County and a 
portion of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Cathie Wright said she was so confident of defeating Democrat Dennis Petrie 
that she spent 60% of the last three months helping other Republicans get 
elected.

MAN HELD IN SLAYING OF MOTEL RESIDENT IN FRONT OF 2 BOYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 33-year-old Port Hueneme longshoreman was arrested on suspicion of slaying a 
construction contractor whose children were in the Oxnard motel room where the 
man was shot to death, police and neighbors said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Amilcar Joseph Mondesi Jr. was being held in the Ventura County Jail in lieu of 
$250,000 bail, a jail spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Mondesi is suspected of shooting Ricardo Perea, 46, three times in the chest 
with a .22-caliber handgun about 7:50 p.m. Sunday at the Sunshine Inn in the 
700 block of West Hueneme Road, authorities said. Perea, who hotel officials 
said lived on and off in one of the establishment's $27-a-night rooms, died 
from the wounds less than an hour later at St. John's Regional Medical Center 
in Oxnard, the coroner's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Mondesi and Perea both had lived at various times during the last year with a 
Port Hueneme woman in her Florence Avenue house, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
Perea most recently checked into the motel Oct. 31 as Rick Houston and listed 
his address as the house on Florence Avenue that neighbors said Mondesi lately 
had been sharing with the woman. The woman asked Perea to move out about six 
months ago and Mondesi moved in later, said one neighbor, who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard detectives would not say why Perea was using an alias nor disclose the 
woman's name. 
</P>
<P>
Perea apparently was blasted with gunfire when he answered a knock on the door 
of his motel room, said motel resident Jack Ganza, who rushed to Perea's room 
when he heard the shots. Ganza said he walked into the room and found Perez 
slumped against the bed where his two sons, ages 4 and 6, sat crying. 
</P>
<P>
The boys later told police that they knew the man who shot their father and 
that they had once lived with him, Ganza said. 
</P>
<P>
Mondesi worked periodically at the Port of Hueneme and Perea recently had been 
running a small contracting business doing home remodeling and rebuilding, 
neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives set up a surveillance of Mondesi's Port Hueneme house at 1:30 p.m. 
Monday, said Lt. Robert Kelley of the Oxnard Police Department. When detectives 
Jim Seitz and Ed Neitzel saw Mondesi leaving the house, they followed his 
vehicle to Perkins Road and Cuesta Del Mar Drive in Oxnard, Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of officers from the Port Hueneme Police Department, Mondesi was 
arrested without incident, Kelley said. Mondesi was booked into the jail, 
Kelley said. No weapon was recovered, and an investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley said police are still working on motives for the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
However, Perea's sister Martha Perea, 36, of Santa Maria said she had heard 
that Perea and Mondesi were friends who had had a disagreement several weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Mondesi came to Perea's motel room, they had words and Mondesi opened fire, she 
said. She said she did not know what the argument was about. 
</P>
<P>
She said that Perea's two sons were in the room and that the older boy 
identified Mondesi for police. Martha Perea said she wasn't sure where the 
children are now. 
</P>
<P>
She said her brother was a landscaper and construction worker who had lived in 
the Oxnard area for more than a year. She and her brother grew up in a family 
of eight in Santa Maria, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Perea also had two daughters and a son, all in their mid-20s, from his 
first marriage, Martha Perea said. He was divorced from his second wife and had 
custody of his two young sons. 
</P>
<P>
"He really loved them a lot," Martha Perea said. "He'd do anything for those 
boys."

EARLY COUNT HAS OXNARD MAYOR AHEAD FOR 5TH TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Incumbent mayors in Oxnard and Thousand Oaks widely viewed as pro-development 
held early leads in two of the county's eight city elections Tuesday night 
after tough campaigns fought primarily over growth issues. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard Mayor Nao Takasugi, seeking an unprecedented fifth term in office, was 
far ahead in the early vote. Outgoing Thousand Oaks Mayor Alex Fiore, seeking 
an eighth term as a Thousand Oaks city councilman, had posted a slight lead. 
</P>
<P>
In Simi Valley, two-term Mayor Greg Stratton also held a strong lead against 
his only challenger, Alfred J. Wilson, a retired Los Angeles bus driver. 
</P>
<P>
The local races, fought primarily over the issue of growth, were a test of the 
political clout of Patagonia Inc., a Ventura clothing company that has become 
increasingly active in support of slow-growth candidates throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
Patagonia had endorsed Oxnard council candidate Scott Weiss, Thousand Oaks 
candidate Elois Zeanah, Simi Valley candidate John Etter and Moorpark mayoral 
candidate Clint Harper. 
</P>
<P>
All four Patagonia candidates were behind in early returns. Only Harper and 
Zeanah seemed close enough after early results to have a chance of pulling out 
a victory. 
</P>
<P>
"None of the numbers sound impressive, but we'll have to wait and see," said 
Patagonia spokesman Kevin Sweeney. 
</P>
<P>
Takasugi said his early lead was an endorsement of the direction he has taken 
the city in his eight years in office. He also gave credit to old-fashioned 
door-to-door campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any major changes in policy," he said late Tuesday night. "I will 
follow the same course as I started on eight years ago." 
</P>
<P>
At his home late Tuesday night, Fiore said he believed his early lead was an 
endorsement of the council's current policies. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it shows that people in the city are generally satisfied with the way 
things are run," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This is how the eight city races shaped up as the early returns were being 
counted: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Oxnard 
</P>
<P>
With development and the city's financial woes as prominent issues in this 
year's campaign, six candidates sought the mayor's seat held by Takasugi and 12 
hopefuls ran for two council seats held by Manuel Lopez and Ann Johs. 
</P>
<P>
Running against Takasugi, a retired grocer and four-term incumbent, were 
Dorothy Maron, a 10-year council veteran; Scott Bollinger, a self-employed 
investor; John Cobian, a court interpreter; Deborah DeMoss, a homemaker and 
saleswoman; and John Soria, a semi-retired administrator. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates running against Lopez and Johs were Eleanor Branthoover, Paul 
Chatman, Oscar Karrin, Roy Lockwood, Richard Morrisset, Bedford Pinkard, 
Michael Plisky, Robert Randolph, Fred Schwartz, and Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
Former councilman Plisky had a strong lead, with Lopez and Johs following in a 
neck-and-neck race for the second council seat. Lockwood and Weiss followed 
close behind. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley 
</P>
<P>
Economic growth and the annexation of Bob Hope's Jordan and Runkle ranches were 
among the principal issues as nine candidates vied for two council seats and 
two hopefuls sought the mayor's post. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Stratton and Councilwoman Ann Rock said annexation is worth pursuing. 
Some council candidates were concerned about the environmental effects of the 
housing development for Jordan Ranch and said the Board of Supervisors should 
make the decision. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Rock and Etter, council candidates were Kenneth E. Wenning, 
Bruce Kanegai, Marilyn Mauer, Harold Fick, David McCormick, Judy Mikels and 
Sandi Webb. 
</P>
<P>
Webb, a political novice who injected several thousand dollars of her own money 
to boost her campaign, surprised the field by holding a substantial lead early 
on. Rock was running close behind, behind with Mikels following. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
Traffic, air pollution and crime were the main issues as nine candidates -- 
including incumbents Fiore and Lawrence E. Horner -- sought three open council 
seats. The mayor is selected from among the council members. 
</P>
<P>
Also dividing the candidates was the proposed government center and arts 
auditorium at the former Jungleland site in Thousand Oaks. Fiore supported the 
project, while some candidates called it too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Fiore, Horner and Zeanah, the council candidates were Ray Grams, 
Patricia Halfhill, Bob Hughes, Judy Lazar, Bob O'Brien and Michael Markey. 
</P>
<P>
In early returns, Horner, who is seeking his fifth term, was running 
neck-and-neck with both Lazar and Zeanah. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moorpark 
</P>
<P>
Managing growth and redeveloping the city's downtown area were dominant issues 
as three candidates competed for the mayor's post and two hopefuls sought one 
council seat. 
</P>
<P>
Since the city was incorporated in 1983, the mayor has been selected from among 
the council. This election marks the first time the voters directly chose a 
mayor to succeed Bernardo Perez, who did not seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
The race became increasingly heated toward the end, with Harper criticizing 
Paul W. Lawrason Jr. as a pro-growth candidate. Lawrason rejected Harper's 
charges, saying that he supports moderate growth. Also running for mayor was 
Tom Wheeler, a former parks and recreation commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
The council candidates were Eloise Brown, who is seeking her second four-year 
term, and John Wozniak, chairman of the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
In early returns, Lawrason was holding a tight lead over Harper. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Camarillo 
</P>
<P>
Eight candidates, including Mayor Charlotte Craven, sought three council seats. 
As in other cities, slow growth was the buzzword in the election. 
</P>
<P>
Craven, who is seeking her second term, was the only candidate who did not bill 
herself as an opponent of growth. She has advocated moderate growth. The other 
seven candidates charged that the city's growth has led to traffic, 
high-density housing and crowded schools. 
</P>
<P>
The other two council seats are being vacated by council members Sandi Bush and 
Tom Martin. The mayor is appointed from among the council members. 
</P>
<P>
The other council candidates were William Q. Liebmann, Joel D. Bonfiglio, Mike 
Creadick, Stanley J. Daily, Charles (Ken) Gose, Paul J. Kliebert and Harvey 
Eisenberg. 
</P>
<P>
Gose, a slow-growth candidate who has campaigned for fiscal responsibility in 
City Hall, held a slight lead over Craven, with Daily following close behind. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula 
</P>
<P>
Seven candidates vied for three City Council seats, two of them being vacated 
by incumbent Mayor Kay Wilson and Councilman Carl Barringer, who have chosen 
not to seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates were Wayne Johnson, Co Engelhart, Margaret Ely, Bob Borrego, 
Jesse Ornelas, Flo Zakrajshek and 16-year incumbent John Melton. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, Melton and Ely held close leads over the other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fillmore 
</P>
<P>
Six candidates sought two council seats. The candidates were Ray Wolfe, John 
Pressey, Linda Brewster, Charles (Tom) Robertson, Donald Gunderson and Troy 
Tashima. 
</P>
<P>
Gunderson led in early returns, with Brewster following close behind. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Port Hueneme 
</P>
<P>
Four candidates were seeking three City Council seats. They were incumbents 
Dorill B. Wright, James F. (Jim) Daniels, Ken Hess and challenger Gary L. 
Songer. 
</P>
<P>
All three incumbents held comfortable leads over the only challenger.

HOMELESS SHELTER LOSES U.S. FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
About 40 people from Zoe Christian Center protested the County Board of 
Supervisors' decision Tuesday to withdraw $75,000 in federal funds earmarked 
for the homeless shelter. 
</P>
<P>
The staff and the homeless men, women and children from the Oxnard center 
staged a silent protest after the decision. They stood in the hearing room for 
less than an hour while the supervisors conducted other business. 
</P>
<P>
The financially plagued center was in line for $75,000 in Community Development 
Block Grant funds to help pay for and renovate the women's shelter at 104 N. 
Hayes St. 
</P>
<P>
However, just before the deal was finalized, county officials learned that 
there were two liens totaling $118,000 on the property. Because of the liens, 
the federal funds were withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
"At the last minute we found out the county was not going to do it," said the 
Rev. Jim Gilmer, executive director of the center. "We were depending on it." 
</P>
<P>
Gilmer said in a letter to county officials that one of the liens has been paid 
off and the other, filed by the Internal Revenue Service, is being taken care 
of. 
</P>
<P>
"I really feel that if county staff would have worked more closely with us on 
this matter that the project could have been completed," he said. Now the 
property is in foreclosure and the center must get a loan to replace the money 
that was withdrawn, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Shaw-Halloway, manager of special projects for the county, said the liens 
made it imprudent to give the money to the center because of the possibility 
the property could be taken over by creditors. The liens plus the mortgage 
equal more than the value of the property, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel badly for Zoe. We all do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The center, which opened 15 years ago, provides shelter and counseling for 
about 150 people a day. In 1986, the women's shelter opened with space for 15.

<TEXT>
<P>
A woman pleaded not guilty Tuesday to shooting and stabbing her mother to death 
in a slaying in La Canada Flintridge that also allegedly involved the suspect's 
11-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Madeira, 43, of Anaheim entered a plea of not guilty to the Oct. 14 
killing of Roma Jaul Jacobs, 78, and was ordered by a Municipal Court judge to 
return Nov. 27 for a pretrial hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs was attacked as she sought help by telephone. Madeira was dressed in 
combat fatigues and her son was wearing girl's clothing when deputies arrested 
them in the back yard of the dead woman's home. The boy previously pleaded not 
guilty to murder.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A suitcase containing more than $300,000 in cash, believed to be drug money, 
was found near the belongings of a man who was shot four times in Studio City 
on Monday night, Los Angeles police said Tuesday. The victim, Tony James 
Holmes, 42, of Acton, denied that the money was his, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers responding to a report of shots fired in the 4200 block of Vineland 
Avenue found Holmes lying wounded in the courtyard of an apartment complex, 
said Commander William Booth. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes was taken to St. Joseph's Medical Center in Burbank for treatment of 
wounds to the forearm, elbow, groin and midsection. 
</P>
<P>
The officers followed a trail of blood to a nearby apartment house in the 11000 
block of Aqua Vista Street, where they found "several items of men's clothing 
and a suitcase," Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers opened the suitcase and discovered 13 plastic freezer bags filled with 
money later determined to total $320,345.

CAB DRIVER LOSES EYE AS RIDER ATTACKS WITH KNIFE, CHEMICALS

A Yellow Cab Co. driver lost an eye and was robbed of his money and taxi when a 
woman passenger splashed a caustic material in his face and escaped in the cab 
Tuesday morning in the 4000 block of Swift Avenue, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Oleos Santiago, 35, was in stable condition Tuesday at Mercy Hospital, a 
hospital spokesman said. A police spokesman said Santiago lost his right eye 
from the splashing and was cut under his right eye. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago was responding to a call about 3:25 a.m. to pick up a fare at in the 
4000 block of Swift Avenue in East San Diego, said police spokesman Dave Cohen. 
When Santiago arrived, he found no such address and began looking around the 
neighborhood, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
A woman approached Santiago's cab, got in the back seat, and told him she was 
the one who called and that she wanted to go to 26th and Imperial, Cohen said. 
When Santiago told her there was a $10 deposit, the woman agreed, but instead 
of paying, she splashed or sprayed an unknown caustic chemical in his face and 
tried to strangle him, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago was able to yell "Code Blue" into the cab's radio before breaking away 
from the woman and escaping, Cohen said. As Santiago ran to a nearby Alberto's 
taco shop at Swift and University, the woman got into the front seat of the cab 
and drove off, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police found the abandoned cab shortly before 6 a.m. in an alley in the 4100 
block of 43rd Street, Cohen said. The woman had taken $200 in cash that was 
left in the car when Santiago ran away, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police are still looking for the woman, who is described as black, very thin, 
about 5 feet, 7 inches tall and 30 to 35 years old, Cohen said. At the time of 
the attack she was wearing a red and black winter jacket, blue jeans and a blue 
pullover cap, he said.

2 CAMP PENDLETON FIRES OUT OF CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fueled by dry, strong Santa Ana winds, two fires had consumed more than 500 
acres of brushland within Camp Pendleton by Tuesday night as fire crews from 
San Diego and Orange counties sought to head off the blazes before they reached 
populated areas, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The San Onofre nuclear power plant was reportedly on a standby alert as the 
brush fire raced near it, but officials there could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The blazes -- one at the northern tip of the base, the other in the center -- 
were reported to be burning out of control as of 9:30 p.m., but reports 
differed over their proximity to military complexes and other buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The wind, reported at up to 40 m.p.h. through the afternoon and evening, spread 
the two fires quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"The wind is a big factor for us right now," Camp Pendleton public information 
officer Cpl. Lynda MacTavish said. 
</P>
<P>
George Mangel of the U.S. Forest Service outpost in San Diego County said the 
fire at the center of the military installation was "threatening buildings and 
other military things. We sent a total of 10 engines." 
</P>
<P>
The more severe of the two blazes started about 8 p.m. and appeared to be 
centered about a quarter of a mile east of Interstate 5, near the nuclear power 
plant, slowing traffic on the freeway as drivers watched flames and smoke. 
</P>
<P>
The fire pressed against the northern edge of the base, just south of San 
Clemente. But, as of about 9:30, MacTavish said, no structures were in danger.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ENCINITAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arson investigators Tuesday sifted through the rubble of a duplex in the 3000 
block of Via de Caballo in Encinitas looking for clues into the cause of a 
fast-spreading fire that did $450,000 damage, the Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
It took firefighters from Oceanside, Encinitas, Rancho Santa Fe, Solana Beach, 
Carlsbad and San Diego about two hours to put out the three-alarm blaze, which 
started shortly after 8 p.m. Monday, said a spokesman for the Encinitas Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the three-story duplex home was gutted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the blaze, the spokesman said. Victor Eugene Nikula and 
his wife, Phyllis, were home when the fire started, but their barking dog 
alerted them, and they escaped unharmed, he said.

BOLAND PULLS IN FRONT OF ALLERT IN EARLY RESULTS; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATURE: IN OTHER VALLEY-AREA DISTRICTS, INCUMBENTS HEAD FOR EASY WINS OVER 
POORLY FINANCED OPPONENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Republican Paula Boland appeared to be headed for victory over Democrat Irene 
Allert on Tuesday in early returns for the 38th Assembly District -- the only 
open legislative seat in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In the Valley's only other seriously contested state legislative race, 
embattled Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale) was leading his Democratic 
opponent, Jeanette Mann. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, incumbent Assembly members and state senators in other Valley-area 
districts headed for easy reelection wins over little-known, poorly financed 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Boland, a Granada Hills real estate broker, appeared to be leading Allert, an 
educational consultant from Kagel Canyon, after a campaign in which abortion 
rights and overdevelopment were key issues. 
</P>
<P>
At an election party at the Burbank Hilton hotel, Boland said, "We felt 
confident from the beginning, and I still feel confident we are going to win." 
</P>
<P>
The seat was open due to the impending retirement of Assemblywoman Marian La 
Follette (R-Northridge). La Follette served for a decade in the district, which 
forms a rough horseshoe across the Valley from Hidden Hills to Sunland-Tujunga. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime grass-roots GOP activist, Boland was backed by prominent Valley GOP 
conservatives, including former Rep. Bobbi Fiedler of Northridge. Much of her 
financial support came from developers, oil companies, banks and other special 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
Boland, 50, also drew strong support from conservative Republicans in the 
Assembly, including Assembly GOP leader Ross Johnson of La Habra. Johnson faces 
a reelection vote in the Republican caucus soon, and Boland is likely to back 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Boland, who won the GOP nomination after a furious primary election battle 
against Rob Wilcox in June, spent more than twice as much as Allert -- $131,000 
compared to $55,000 -- between July 1 and Oct. 25, according to campaign 
finance reports. 
</P>
<P>
Allert, 46, relied heavily on women's groups and labor unions for money. 
Although she campaigned extensively and sent campaign mailers to thousands of 
Republicans, Allert apparently was unable to win over enough GOP voters in the 
district, where Republicans outnumber Democrats 84,000 to 73,000. 
</P>
<P>
Allert hoped to score points by trumpeting her support for legalized abortion 
in the upscale suburban district, where a poll last January showed voters 
strongly in favor of abortion rights. Boland opposes legalized abortion. 
</P>
<P>
But Boland buttressed her political flanks with abortion-rights voters, 
particularly women, with campaign brochures emphasizing her support for keeping 
repeat rapists in prison longer and for boosting penalties for crimes committed 
at or near schools. 
</P>
<P>
Hugging and kissing her supporters at a post-election party in Granada Hills, 
Allert said: "I'm very proud of the effort all these people put into the 
campaign. I feel we've made our presence known and helped to find the issues in 
this campaign, and I believe we had an impact." 
</P>
<P>
In the 41st Assembly District, Democrat Mann, a Pasadena City College trustee, 
tried to capitalize on Nolan's involvement with the scandal-ridden savings and 
loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan sponsored a 1982 bill that eased restrictions on S&amp;Ls, a move Mann 
said paved the way for speculative investments that caused the collapse of a 
number of thrifts. According to a study by Common Cause, a political watchdog 
group, Nolan received $154,000 in contributions from S&amp;Ls in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan fought back in the staunchly Republican district by spending $450,000 on 
a campaign that stressed his achievements and endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
Mann also was unable to get much political mileage out of a federal corruption 
probe of Nolan, who was among four legislators whose offices were raided by the 
FBI two years ago. Although the incumbent remains under investigation, the 
probe dragged on without resolution this fall. 
</P>
<P>
In other races, incumbents appeared to be coasting to reelection. State Sen. 
Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) was easily besting GOP nominee David Podegracz, a Van 
Nuys tool salesman who did little campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles) appeared to be beating GOP 
businessman Michael Schrager of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly members Tom Bane (D-Tarzana), Terry Friedman (D-Los Angeles), Richard 
Katz (D-Sylmar), Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles) and Cathie Wright (R-Simi 
Valley) were headed toward victory over token opponents.

COUNCIL DELAYS VOTE ON HOUSING PROJECT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura City Council has postponed a decision on a 147-unit affordable 
housing project in east Ventura after the panel discovered that the developer 
has been involved in significant litigation in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted unanimously Monday to postpone until Nov. 17 a decision on 
the project to give the developer, Ernest T. Mansi of Oxnard, a chance to 
explain why he was involved in so many lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
The project by KNM Development Inc., which Mansi heads, had been tentatively 
approved Oct. 15 but was sent back to the planning staff for minor redesign. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the council learned that Mansi had been involved in at least 10 
lawsuits in the last six years concerning development projects in Ventura and 
Santa Barbara counties, Ventura Mayor Richard Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
Francis said he was especially concerned about two nursing home projects, one 
is Lompoc and one in Santa Paula, that were never completed, and the collapse 
of a roof in a condominium project in Oxnard. Mansi did the engineering studies 
on the Oxnard project. 
</P>
<P>
Mansi was present Monday for the hearing but declined to make any comment.

NEW COUNTY NETWORK TO BOOST PRENATAL CARE FOR THE LOW-INCOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Acountywide plan to vastly improve prenatal care for low-income women was 
approved Tuesday by the San Diego County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
With local hospital emergency rooms handling an increasing number of cases in 
which women have had no prenatal care, the new Perinatal Provider Network was 
adopted to reduce infant mortality and the number of babies born prematurely, 
according to supervisors and health and social service workers. 
</P>
<P>
The existing public and private health care system is fragmented and 
inefficient, the new network will coordinate services and improve access for 
pregnant women who cannot afford prenatal care, said Paul Simms, deputy 
director of physical health services for the county health department. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Medi-Cal reimbursements will be increased for obstetricians, Simms said. 
</P>
<P>
The network will require no county money; state funds and billing fees to 
participating doctors will cover expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot measure the human suffering (of premature babies), and the 
financial impact is tremendous," Board of Supervisors chairman Leon Williams 
said. "This project will prevent many of these problems. . . . It will be 
humanitarian and cost-effective." 
</P>
<P>
The average cost for prenatal care for a healthy woman is $600, while costs for 
a premature baby needing intensive medical care are $2,500 a day. Last year, 
there were 3,889 births to women who had had no prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
Children with low birth weights often have developmental disabilities and 
require years of expensive care in the public health, social service and 
education systems, and are at increased risk for being abused and neglected, 
health experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Although an estimated 72% of San Diego obstetricians refuse to treat Medi-Cal 
patients because of billing problems and low reimbursement, county officials 
hope to change that by increasing physician fees from $650 a patient to $1,000 
and using electronic billing. Doctors will be eligible to participate in the 
new network, which will guarantee reimbursement within 30 days, if they accept 
one new Medi-Cal patient a month. 
</P>
<P>
At first, 12 to 15 workers will be hired to recruit doctors to join the 
program. The network's first-year costs will be paid for with $835,000 in state 
funds. Future expenses will be covered by a 7% billing fee charged to doctors 
for Medi-Cal payments. The time needed to complete Medi-Cal paper work will be 
reduced from five to seven weeks to up to three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The network, which is expected to be running within 45 days, is the product of 
five years of review and several months of study, Simms said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the network, a variety of private physicians and community programs will 
provide patients with medical care and support services from the time of 
pregnancy to 60 days after the birth. 
</P>
<P>
The network will also include an outreach program to educate women about the 
dangers of tobacco, drugs, alcohol and ignoring prenatal care; case management 
to better handle each patient's needs, and follow-up services to detect any 
post-birth problems.

TRAIL MEETING GOES BACK TO DRAWING BOARD IN SEARCH OF MAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A scheduled decision by the Board of Supervisors on whether to create a 
countywide system of riding and hiking trails was detoured Tuesday when board 
members learned there was no adequate map of the existing system to guide them 
in deciding whether developers should be forced to complete the missing links. 
</P>
<P>
County staff presented several maps showing the potential trails system, which 
has been discussed by the county board since 1972, but supervisors rejected the 
diagrams as "wish lists" that fail to specify what trails now exist and how 
much land is needed to provide the missing links. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 speakers voiced opinions on whether the trails system is "just a 
public subsidy for rich horse owners" or "a precious resource that we could 
save for our grandchildren," only to be told by board members that there was 
not enough concrete evidence of the cost of acquiring and maintaining a 
regional trails system. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-trails advocate Barbara Hutchinson pronounced herself "thoroughly 
disgusted" with the lack of a map showing the dedicated trails in the county 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"Where is this map that you have been promising us?" asked Hutchinson, who 
heads a property rights group called Worried Homeowners, Organized and Angry, 
(WHOA). "How can you act on this matter when you don't even know where (the 
trails system) is going to go?" 
</P>
<P>
The board ordered the county staff to present a specific trail system map 
within 90 days and circulate a proposed county policy on acquiring a trails 
system to the dozens of local community planning groups for their comments. 
Supervisors also directed the chief administrative officer to convene a 
workshop for review of the county's regional trails policies by proponents and 
opponents of the trail dedication plan. 
</P>
<P>
A Fallbrook resident who espoused a plan for preserving open space in the 
county's rural areas shook his head in disgust at the supervisors' decision to 
delay action. "If we keep going at the rate we are going, the whole county is 
going to be paved over," he said.

PLANNING HEAD WILL REPORT ON MANAGEMENT OF ECOLOGICAL AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Responding to a request from Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, the 
county's top planning official said Tuesday he will prepare a report on the 
county's 61 Significant Ecological Areas (SEAs), which were designated for 
protection by the county's 1980 General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
In asking for the report, Antonovich criticized a lengthy article in Sunday's 
Los Angeles Times on neglect of the SEAs, which were chosen for their value as 
wildlife habitat or as strongholds for threatened plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Planning Director James Hartl agreed to report back to the 
Board of Supervisors on the county's management of the SEAs. Pam Holt, a 
section head with the Department of Regional Planning, said later that the 
report will probably be submitted in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich attacked the "very one-sided, inaccurate story" on the SEAs, which 
are mainly in private ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning from Antonovich, Hartl said 38 of the SEAs are in 
unincorporated areas, while the other 23 are within city boundaries. Antonovich 
asked if this meant the latter group of SEAs were not subject to county 
land-use regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"That's correct, supervisor," Hartl said. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich also said the story should have mentioned that a large development 
planned for a SEA in Agoura was recently rejected by the county on the advice 
of a panel that advises the county on protection of the areas. 
</P>
<P>
The article said SEAs have been nibbled by development and are now under 
enormous pressure from proposed housing and commercial projects, roads and even 
garbage dumps. 
</P>
<P>
The article reported that supervisors twice declined to fund a proposed study 
on the condition of the SEAs, and did not follow through on a commitment to 
seek funds to buy threatened SEAs. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by Antonovich, Hartl agreed with him that the General Plan 
"does not require" the county to buy SEAs.

COUNCIL REFUSES TO STUDY TAYLOR RANCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura City Council has turned down a proposal by Mayor Richard Francis to 
recommend that Taylor Ranch be included in the list of potential sites for a 
state university in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been a longtime supporter of Taylor Ranch," Councilman Jim Monahan told 
the panel Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"But let's face it -- Taylor Ranch is dead and the university shouldn't be 
spending any more money to study the site." 
</P>
<P>
The council rejected Francis' proposal to spend $100,000 on an environmental 
impact study on Taylor Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
The ranch, a 250-acre hillside site overlooking the ocean, had been the 
preferred site for a proposed California State University campus in the early 
stages of the site selection process. 
</P>
<P>
But last June, university officials bowed to pressure from environmental and 
slow-growth advocates in Ventura and decided to reopen the process. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the university's Board of Trustees recommended that Taylor Ranch be 
scratched from the final list of four potential sites, contradicting an earlier 
decision by the 25-member Citizens Advisory Committee appointed to study 
potential sites. The board of trustees has final say on where the university 
will be built. 
</P>
<P>
Francis, a staunch supporter of the Taylor Ranch site, said he hopes that the 
environmental report will show that the parcel is the best choice. A vote of 
confidence by the city on Taylor Ranch's possibilities might change the 
trustees' minds, Francis said Monday in an impassioned speech. 
</P>
<P>
But Francis gained only Councilman John McWherter's low-key support. In the 
end, the council instructed its two delegates to the advisory committee, 
Councilman Todd Collart and Community Development Director Everett Millais, to 
use their own judgment in deciding which site to support. SANTIAGO O'DONNELL

STATE TO PURSUE SUIT FOR HALF OF FRYMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taking a get-tough tack after unsuccessful attempts to reach an agreement on a 
sales price with the owner of Fryman Canyon in Studio City, the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy has decided to press on with a lawsuit for title to half 
the land. 
</P>
<P>
Conservancy officials confirmed Tuesday that the parks agency has directed its 
attorneys to proceed with a lawsuit to obtain 31 acres of the canyon for 
parkland. 
</P>
<P>
The canyon has been the subject of a lengthy, intense battle between the owner, 
Fred Sahadi, who wants to build a 26-home development there, and 
environmentalists and neighbors who oppose the project, allied with state and 
city agencies that want to buy the land for park purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy, a state parks agency, and Sahadi remain $2.15 million apart on 
a purchase price, the conservancy valuing the land at $8.75 million and Sahadi 
asking for $10.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
"In no way, shape or form are we going to let them keep our 31 acres. Those are 
rightfully ours, for open space," said Carole Stevens, conservancy chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy lawsuit, filed Aug. 31, alleges that the city erred several 
years ago by not enforcing its own requirement that Sahadi donate the 31 acres 
to the conservancy before receiving city building permission. 
</P>
<P>
The action by the conservancy took place late Monday during an executive 
session. The lawsuit was filed by the state attorney general's office, which 
represents the conservancy in litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens said the lawsuit -- if it succeeds -- might affect the profitability of 
Sahadi's proposed project. The 31 acres, which the state claims, separate two 
portions of the planned project, and the developer intends to build a temporary 
road across the area over which dirt will be hauled to build construction pads 
for the homes. 
</P>
<P>
If the conservancy owned the 31 acres, it could block construction of the 
temporary road and force the developer to seek a much more expensive 
dirt-hauling route on city streets that would require new City Hall permits. 
</P>
<P>
Coupled with the new "green-light" directive to the attorneys was a board 
action, also discussed at length during Monday's executive session, to adopt a 
plan to offer Sahadi $8.75 million for his property, located just north of 
Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Sahadi's attorney, Neil Papiano, told the conservancy board Monday that its 
$8.75 million offer was too low. 
</P>
<P>
Sahadi previously said he was willing to accept a $10.9-million buyout plan 
unveiled Sept. 8 by Mayor Tom Bradley and Los Angeles City Councilman Michael 
Woo. 
</P>
<P>
The Bradley-Woo plan envisioned the conservancy contributing $8.7 million of 
its money toward the $10.9-million price, the city kicking in $1.96 million and 
private donors contributing $240,000. 
</P>
<P>
But the conservancy at its Monday meeting received a new state-sanctioned 
appraisal that set the value of the property at $8.75 million. The board 
subsequently adopted a buyout plan that set a $6.7-million lid on the amount 
the conservancy would contribute.

ZONING PANEL REJECTS PROPOSAL TO BUILD TEMPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A city zoning panel Tuesday sided with North Hollywood residents and rejected a 
proposal to build an Orthodox Jewish temple in a neighborhood of single-family 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
The Adat Yeshurun Valley Sephardic Orthodox congregation will protest the 
ruling by the Board of Zoning Appeals to the City Council, which has the final 
say over the project in the 12400 block of Sylvan Street, said Rabbi Amran 
Gabay. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very disappointed," Gabay said. 
</P>
<P>
The congregation of 91 families outgrew its existing synagogue two years ago 
and bought the vacant lot about a block away for $210,000, hoping to get a 
conditional use permit for the temple, Gabay said. 
</P>
<P>
But neighbors have argued that the proposed two-story temple would increase 
traffic on their quiet streets. Some complained that even if most members 
observe the laws of Orthodox Judaism and walk to the synagogue Saturday 
mornings, the extra pedestrians would cause dogs to bark and wake up the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
In September, the zoning board postponed a decision and told both sides to meet 
face-to-face to work out a solution that could include reducing the size of the 
building to allow fewer worshipers. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the temple and the homeowners met twice, but were unable to 
come to an agreement about the size of the building, said Arline DeSanctis, 
chief field deputy for Councilman Joel Wachs. 
</P>
<P>
The congregation wants a 12,000-square-foot building, and would agree only to 
reducing the size by 1,000 square feet. Residents want to limit the size to 
6,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the lack of a compromise, the board voted 3 to 2 against the 
proposed temple. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if this were a Catholic church or a Christian Science reading room, this 
wouldn't be the right place for a religious institution," board Chairwoman 
Ilene Olansky said.

MALL PLAN LINKED TO COMMUNITY CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Moorpark Planning Commission has approved a plan to allow the largest 
developer in the city to enlarge a proposed commercial shopping center in 
exchange for building a $1-million community center elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The commercial shopping center to be built by Urban West Communities, a Santa 
Monica-based company, was originally approved for 7 1/2 acres, with four acres 
designated in 1983 for a community building. 
</P>
<P>
The developer got approval to scrap the community-use acreage on Monday and 
build a 12-acre shopping center that will include a Ralphs supermarket, retail 
stores, medical offices and a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Zanic, a representative of Urban West, said his company had agreed in June, 
1989, to build the community center at a nearby 69-acre park. It also agreed to 
donate land for a new fire station in the Mountain Meadows area of the city, 
which "constitutes community use. We feel it's a trade-off," Zanic said. GERRY

ELECTIONS: SCHOOL BOARDS; 
</P>
<P>
INCUMBENTS APPEAR TO OUTPOLL CHALLENGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Incumbents in school board races across the county appeared in early returns to 
be overcoming anti-incumbent sentiment to take the lead over their challengers. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers from Ojai to Camarillo spent last weekend canvassing neighborhoods for 
candidates endorsed by their unions, but their aid didn't appear to help 
challengers in races where many of the names on the ballot were unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-three candidates vied for seats in nine districts. 
</P>
<P>
In three crowded contests -- Hueneme Elementary School District, Oxnard Union 
High School District and Oxnard Elementary School District -- only one 
incumbent in each race received endorsements from teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Two Latino candidates were seeking seats on the Oxnard elementary board. Some 
Latino teachers charged last year that the board was insensitive to Latinos 
after an incident in which board member Jack T. Fowler requested that a Latina 
parent address the board in English, not Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler, who was seeking his fourth term, appeared to be leading in early 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I will be reelected," Fowler said. "The absentee ballots are a good 
indicator." He said his mission is to educate students, "to teach them to read, 
write and compute -- in English." 
</P>
<P>
Board members William D. Hill and Dorothie J. Sterling were trailing 
challengers Mary Barreto and Jim Suter. Hill was the only incumbent to receive 
a teachers union endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling said she is a firm believer that there is a reason for all things. "If 
I'm not reelected there are other things for me to be doing." 
</P>
<P>
She said it was a fair campaign and "it's up to the voters." She has served 
five years on the board and was a teacher in the district for 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
Suter, who was ahead in early returns, said, "I guess I knocked on a lot of 
doors. I covered the whole city." He also targeted 4,000 absentee voters, he 
said. "It cost me a fortune in stamps." 
</P>
<P>
In Oxnard Union High School District, incumbents Janet Lindgren and Jean Daily 
Underwood appeared to be keeping their seats. Challenger Nancy F. Koch, a 
housewife whose four children have attended Rio Mesa High, appeared to be 
leading the six-person race in early returns. Other challengers were Thomas D. 
Ragan, Roy W. Lockwood and Angie P. Varela. 
</P>
<P>
In the Hueneme district, the last time a new board member was elected was in 
1973, sparking the chief complaint that the entire board, including the three 
incumbents seeking reelection, has been in office too long. 
</P>
<P>
Elaine K. Garber, an incumbent since 1959, received an endorsement from the 
Hueneme Education Assn. She was the only incumbent who appeared to be keeping 
her seat. Challengers Cheryl Hamilton and Darlene A. Bruno were out-polling 
incumbents Jose C. Babauta and James K. Tipton. In the Ojai Unified School 
District, where all three incumbents won endorsements from the teachers union, 
only one challenger, Alan D. Fletcher, entered the race. 
</P>
<P>
The Ojai incumbents were Robert Emhardt, a retired actor, who sought a third 
term; Vincent W. France, a commander with the county Sheriff's Department who 
has served on the board since 1979; and Muriel Sharkey Lavender, a real estate 
broker first elected in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
In other races, including Camarillo's Pleasant Valley Unified School District 
and the Simi Valley Unified School District, few incumbents received union 
endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
In the Pleasant Valley district, discontent has been widespread among teachers 
-- who say that they are underpaid and are not given respect -- and among some 
parents, who say eastern Camarillo schools are overcrowded. Three seats were 
available. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers union did not endorse either incumbent, Barbara Ballard Miller or 
Dolores (Val) Rains. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbents were challenged by Jeanette L. (Jan) McDonald, who was supported 
by a parents group upset by crowded schools in eastern Camarillo. Four other 
challengers also entered the race. 
</P>
<P>
In the Simi Valley district, five candidates, including six-term incumbent Lew 
Roth, battled for two seats. Challengers were Douglas Crosse, Carla Kurachi, 
Don Otto, and Karolyn J. Searight. 
</P>
<P>
Kurachi, a newcomer to Simi Valley, appeared to be the top vote-getter in early 
return. "I'm surprised at that big of a lead," she said. "I've lived out here 
for 2 1/2 years. . . . I think I probably represent change." 
</P>
<P>
Roth appeared to be maintaining his seat on the board. 
</P>
<P>
Three seats were available in the Santa Paula Union High School District, where 
some challengers had complained that the high turnover among the administrative 
and teaching staff is hurting schools. The two incumbents, Donna Nelson and 
Shirley Hendren, faced three challengers, including Robert J. Villa, the 
district's former superintendent and a 20-year employee of Santa Paula schools. 
</P>
<P>
In the 300-student Briggs Elementary School District in Santa Paula, Karen 
MacConell, was the only of three incumbents running for reelection. Challengers 
were Elizabeth Ikeda, Greg Patterson, Lloyd G. Simpson Jr. and Jeff Williams. 
</P>
<P>
In Somis' Mesa Union Elementary School District, Patricia Fontes, a vice 
principal, was the only incumbent seeking reelection. Challengers Fred J. 
Ferro, Ralph A. Marchioni, Tomas Miranda Jr. and Barbara Tweedy Patten also 
sought election in the one-school, 350-student district. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Stassel, Joel Brand, Carol Weinstock and Thia Bell contributed to 
this story.

INQUIRY URGED IN BUILDER'S FAILURE TO KEEP PROMISES; 
</P>
<P>
STUDIO CITY: A COUNCILMAN CHARGES THAT A DEVELOPER FAILED TO PUT IN REQUIRED 
TRAFFIC IMPROVEMENTS IN TWO PROJECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Councilman Michael Woo on Tuesday called for a city investigation into why the 
developer of a problem-ridden Studio City shopping center failed to widen an 
intersection as promised and was then allowed to open another, nearby mini-mall 
with its own set of incomplete traffic improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Woo also called on the city's traffic, engineering and legal staffs to explain 
why they allowed the Ventura Boulevard developer to settle a bond-default suit 
out of court for $205,000 when the cost of the traffic project would have been 
closer to $250,000 -- roughly the amount of the bond. 
</P>
<P>
The case was settled in June, 2 1/2 years after developer Mitch Francis was 
supposed to have paid for installation of a double left-turn lane at the corner 
of Laurel Canyon and Ventura boulevards in return for permits to build the 
"Times Square" shopping center at 12215 Ventura Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
In August, another Francis project, the "California Pavilion" shopping center, 
opened at Ventura Boulevard and Laurel Grove Avenue although a street-widening 
project there also remains incomplete. The shopping center has a temporary 
occupancy permit and a permanent permit is dependent on finishing the traffic 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Francis blamed the city bureaucracy for delays in both traffic projects. He 
also had harsh words for Woo, saying "this is just typical of the way Woo 
operates, where he makes these grandstands to point to bad-guy developers, and 
it's just completely unfair and wrong." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Times Square, Francis, the shopping center's new managing 
partner Stephen Getzoff, and their attorney Fred Gaines all said the city 
engineer's office could not decide what it wanted and repeatedly required 
time-consuming and expensive changes in the plans. 
</P>
<P>
As for the California Pavilion's incomplete street-widening project, Francis 
said his construction crew encountered unexpected telephone lines where a 
traffic signal is supposed to be installed. Again, he blamed the city, saying 
that its maps failed to show the phone lines and its staff was slow to work out 
an agreement with the utility. 
</P>
<P>
Times Square attorney Fred Gaines questioned why Woo was calling for an 
investigation five months after the matter was settled. The $205,000 settlement 
fee was derived by subtracting the money spent on engineering fees from the 
original $247,695 bond, Francis and Getzoff said. 
</P>
<P>
Woo said he was calling for the investigation now because "we still need to 
understand, 'How did this happen in the first place?' " He said he mainly 
wanted to know why the Times Square project received a permanent occupancy 
permit in 1988 when the traffic work wasn't done, and "why the city didn't get 
a larger amount of money" when it settled the foreclosure case out of court. 
</P>
<P>
Woo said it "could've been great" if he and his staff initiated the 
investigation earlier "but we were busy." In his motion before the City Council 
on Tuesday, Woo asked that the city attorney's office, the Bureau of 
Engineering and the Traffic Department submit reports on the matter within 30 
days to the Governmental Efficiency Committee, which he chairs. 
</P>
<P>
The traffic improvements Francis was supposed to have made will cost between 
$214,000 and $244,000, Woo's deputy Diana Brueggemann said Tuesday. The city is 
negotiating with another developer, Ira Smedra, to include the project when he 
makes additional improvements to the intersection for his "Laurel Promenade" 
shopping center at the southeast corner of Ventura and Laurel Canyon 
boulevards.

SHERIFF'S DEPUTY ARRESTED IN FRACAS OUTSIDE BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An off-duty San Diego County sheriff's deputy with a good record was arrested 
and jailed early Tuesday morning on charges of drunken driving and of 
threatening two fellow officers with a handgun, law enforcement officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Jose Raimundo Huizar, 28, had been drinking at a small Lemon Grove 
nightclub, the Nite Life East, when two on-duty deputies made a routine check 
of the club at about 1:30 a.m., Sgt. Glenn Revell said. When club employees 
told them Huizar was being disruptive, the deputies spoke with him briefly, 
then left the club, Revell said. 
</P>
<P>
Huizar was "obviously intoxicated," said the club's general manager, Jeffrey 
Houston, but did not argue when the club's employees asked him to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Revell said Huizar and an unidentified friend were just leaving the club in a 
vehicle when the on-duty deputies returned. They followed Huizar and pulled him 
over in Spring Valley, Revell said, sparking a "confrontation" during which 
Huizar brandished a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
Huizar, a six-year department veteran, was booked on charges of threatening an 
officer with a weapon, battery on an officer and driving under the influence of 
alcohol. He was released on his own recognizance Tuesday and placed on 
administrative leave from the Lemon Grove substation pending the outcome of a 
criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Captain Jim Roache, who is on leave from the Lemon Grove substation 
during his campaign for sheriff, said his staff had informed him of the 
incident early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of those dumb things -- not thinking, consuming alcohol in an 
establishment that I would prefer not to have my personnel frequent," Roache 
said. "He apparently didn't use sound judgment. We expect our officers to 
handle themselves in public as law-abiding, respectable citizens with the 
utmost dignity. It appears this didn't happen in this case." 
</P>
<P>
Roache added: "It's too bad, because the kid has a good record as a patrol 
officer in Lemon Grove." 
</P>
<P>
Huizar could not be reached Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Revell said he could not divulge details of Huizar's personnel record, but said 
he knew of no similar incidents involving him. He said that the Sheriff's 
Department will conduct an internal investigation, but that the criminal case 
will be handled by the district attorney's office. If charges are pressed, and 
Huizar is found guilty, he said, it is unclear what disciplinary measures will 
be imposed. 
</P>
<P>
"That's up to administrative discipline channels," he said. "There is no set 
discipline for each of those offenses." 
</P>
<P>
Huizar is scheduled to be arraigned Nov. 20 in El Cajon Municipal Court, a jail 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Houston, the club's general manager, said his staff was unaware that Huizar was 
a deputy. 
</P>
<P>
"Both my security people and my manager did not know if he was a sheriff. He 
could have been anybody. He could have been a construction worker," Houston 
said.

A Van Nuys man was arrested on suspicion of shooting his wife to death during a

FIRE STARTED BY FUMES SPREADS TO TWO HOMES 
</P>

A Clairemont man escaped injury Tuesday evening while repairing a car's fuel 
tank when the pilot light from a garage water heater ignited gasoline fumes, 
causing extensive damage to the house. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Fire Department Capt. Al McDonald said the fire began at 6:09 p.m. 
and went to a second alarm when flames that engulfed the home threatened nearby 
houses. Damage to the house in the 5800 block of Camber Drive was estimated at 
$110,000, and a neighboring house suffered $15,000 in damage, McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
The names of those living at the home where the fire started were not available 
Tuesday night, but McDonald said the fire began when the gasoline fumes were 
ignited by the water heater's pilot light, causing the vehicle to burn. The 
fire spread to the rest of the house, which was severely damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Department officials said the man had backed the car into the open garage 
and removed a fuel gauge component from the gas tank. The tank began leaking 
and the man attempted to contain the leaking gas in a small can. 
</P>
<P>
A nearby water heater ignited the fumes, causing several small explosions. 
</P>
<P>
According to Fire Department officials, the man "was very fortunate" to escape 
the fire without serious injuries. Apparently, the exploding gas tank also 
created several small fireballs that quickly engulfed the garage and house in 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
One firefighter suffered minor injuries while battling the blaze. McDonald said 
the man had first-degree burns on the face and a twisted ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters from Station 36, just a few blocks away, were the first to arrive 
at the scene. When the blaze knocked down nearby power lines and flames began 
to lick at a neighboring house, firefighters called a second alarm. 
</P>
<P>
Ten vehicles and 48 firefighters were called to prevent the fire from spreading 
to other homes in the heavily concentrated residential area.

BARRIO LIBRARY IS STILL IN DOUBT DESPITE STATE GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Born in controversy, a plan to provide special library service to Carlsbad's 
barrio residents -- many of whom have never been inside a library -- has won 
state funding but still must get City Council approval. 
</P>
<P>
City library officials this week received a $40,000 check from the state 
library, money they hope to spend on opening a tiny satellite operation for the 
Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
But council acceptance of the grant is by no means automatic. When they voted 
to apply for the funding, council members made it clear that acceptance would 
depend on how much the grant might require the city to chip in. 
</P>
<P>
The grant is less than the $157,000 Carlsbad applied for, but local officials 
say that, if the program gets started, the state library is willing to give 
additional funding over a five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
"They said, 'Let's start slowly and we'll commit ourselves to five years,' " 
said Geoffrey Armour, assistant library director. 
</P>
<P>
What that means, if the council accepts the grant, is a unique effort to reach 
the estimated 4,529 residents of the barrio who live near the city's main 
library on Elm Avenue east of Interstate 5, but, culturally, seem miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Many Latinos are conditioned not to use the library, largely because in Mexico, 
the library is used exclusively for university study and not casual or 
recreational use. 
</P>
<P>
"Our ultimate goal is to get them to come here (to the main library) and have 
the right things for them here," said Library Director Clifford Lange. 
</P>
<P>
Word of the state grant has delighted Latino activists who last May formed a 
coalition to encourage bringing the library closer to the city's Latino 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Valenzuela, a coalition member and a part-time Carlsbad library worker, 
said, "I'm really excited about the program. I know there's a need. I'd like to 
mainstream people into the library." 
</P>
<P>
She regards the grant as a sign of progress, especially since the city "has 
really never offered or gone out of their way to serve the Hispanic 
population." 
</P>
<P>
She and library officials believe a satellite operation would make Latinos 
familiar with library service and entice them to the main library. After 
meetings with the coalition, Lange and Armour envision the operation serving 
primarily as an information center. 
</P>
<P>
Staffed by a bilingual person, the so-called Centro de Informacion would offer 
some books, but emphasize brochures and pamphlets to guide Latinos in locating 
medical and legal assistance, find English classes, figure out how to fill out 
tax forms and apply for a driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
The material, Armour said, will focus on "basic coping, self-help and survival" 
information. 
</P>
<P>
Although obtaining the state grant is a big step, the subject of special 
library service for Latinos was initially stalled in controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Latino activists were angered last July when Assistant City Manager Frank 
Mannen decided against putting the grant application on the council agenda. 
Mannen said then that there wasn't enough time before the grant application 
deadline to determine whether the city eventually would be financially 
responsible for continuing the program. 
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from Latinos, some of whom charged the city with racism, the 
council voted the night before the deadline to seek the grant. But the council 
reserved the right to give back the money if the program required too large a 
city subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
Ofelia Escobedo, an activist and business owner in the barrio, is confident 
that the council will accept the grant when it is brought up for approval on 
the Dec. 11 agenda. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they'll go for it," said Escobedo. 
</P>
<P>
However, it's too soon to tell how the council will vote on accepting the 
grant, as the city staff hasn't completed a report on whether the new library 
service could affect the city budget. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pro Tem Ann Kulchin said, "I hate to say it sounds wonderful until I've 
got all the information in my hands." 
</P>
<P>
There's certain to be financial uncertainty over the grant because the state 
library has promised future funding, but not indicated how much Carlsbad will 
get, Armour said. Although the state awards the grants, the money is actually 
from federal sources. 
</P>
<P>
He said state library officials decided, based on past experience, that cities 
seldom use the full first-year grant. So they approved smaller grants to cover 
first year expenses.

RUTLEDGE HANGS IN, GETS REWARDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD JUSTICE, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a long, exhausting summer, perhaps the worst of his life. Jeff Rutledge 
spent four days a week in Washington studying an offense "that was like Greek 
to me" and the other three days in Southern California coaching Little League 
and maintaining some semblance of family life. 
</P>
<P>
Rutledge smiles now, knowing how odd this sounds, especially after his NFL 
career has taken yet another unpredictable turn. He was named the NFC's 
offensive player of the week yesterday, but for a few days last summer, he'd 
very nearly had enough of pro football. 
</P>
<P>
Hadn't he already done it all, or seemingly all he was ever going to do? He had 
started nine games in 11 years, but had made a nice living and a lot of 
friends. He had a good reputation, that of being smart and quiet and willing to 
help any way he could. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches respected him even when they weren't playing him. Teammates respected 
him. Now, he had a family settled comfortably in Southern California, a newly 
opened restaurant to run and no guarantee the Redskins even wanted him. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the first time," he remembered yesterday, "that I had to sit down and 
think, 'Do I want this bad enough? Do I want to be a rookie again?' I knew deep 
down I still wanted to play. It was a matter of whether or not I was willing to 
study harder and work harder. I remember going through minicamp and summer 
school and feeling like a rookie all over again. Thoughts were going through my 
mind I'd never had before as far as retirement." 
</P>
<P>
He discussed the situation with family and friends, and just when he was at his 
lowest, the telephone rang early one morning. He answered and recognized the 
voice of a friend and former coach-Bill Parcells. 
</P>
<P>
"What's this I'm hearing about what you're thinking?" Parcells asked. 
</P>
<P>
Rutledge: "Hey, Bill, I'm just frustrated. I stunk in minicamp and I'm having a 
hard time learning the system. Things aren't going well. I feel like a rookie 
all over again." 
</P>
<P>
Parcells cut him off. "You know you can play," he said. "You know you have 
talent. Work hard. I don't want to hear this." 
</P>
<P>
Other friends told him the same thing, encouraged him not to give up and that 
Redskins Coach Joe Gibbs wouldn't have called if he didn't want him. Rutledge 
said something clicked. 
</P>
<P>
"From summer school to training camp, I worked hard on my attitude and came to 
camp to make the best of it," he said. "If they cut me, they cut me. I'd played 
11 years and there wasn't a lot of pressure. Things started to come more 
naturally." 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins will spend a lot of time this week wondering what they have in the 
33-year-old Rutledge. They'll wonder about those 363 passing yards in that 
remarkable come-from-behind victory Sunday in Detroit. They'll see the films of 
the game and look again at a throwing arm that was surprisingly strong and 
judgement that was impeccable. 
</P>
<P>
The cynic in them will say that the Redskins can never, ever, not in a million 
years be taken to the Super Bowl by Jeff Rutledge. Yet Doug Williams was their 
designated Jeff Rutledge in 1987 and he was never supposed to start, either, 
but somehow ended up MVP of Super Bowl XXII. 
</P>
<P>
They'll remind themselves that sports are full of strange stories, and if 
Rutledge had retired this summer, he would have quit knowing he never really 
had a shot at pro football. 
</P>
<P>
He would have quit knowing that the world perhaps had never seen Jeff Rutledge 
play. He was a wishbone quarterback at Alabama and went there because, growing 
up in Birmingham, it was the thing to do. His brother and father played there, 
and Bear Bryant came to his home when he heard that Rutledge was thinking about 
going to LSU and running Jerry Stovall's pro-style offense. 
</P>
<P>
Rutledge doesn't regret going to Alabama. He won a national championship, was 
the Crimson Tide's quarterback for most of three seasons and met his wife, 
Laura. 
</P>
<P>
And yet ... 
</P>
<P>
"My dad would argue even today he should've sent me to LSU," Rutledge said. 
</P>
<P>
He was a ninth-round NFL draft pick because essentially no one knew him. The 
Rams played him behind Vince Ferragamo, and when he got a chance to play, he 
injured a knee. He was traded to the New York Giants, where Coach Ray Perkins 
immediately told him: "You're here for one reason and that's to back up Scott 
Bruner." 
</P>
<P>
Rutledge eventually backed up Phil Simms, and after losing what he thought was 
an open competition in 1984, asked to be traded. For perhaps the only time in 
his life, he was ready to cause trouble. He wanted out of New York. He wanted 
to start and he didn't care who knew it. 
</P>
<P>
But that was only for a moment. The Giants told him, no, we're not trading you. 
Yes, you'll get your chance. He never did, and the last few years he went to 
every training camp simply trying to hold on. The Giants were looking for a 
young quarterback to eventually replace Simms and each year Parcells would 
shrug and say maybe. 
</P>
<P>
Last year at the end of training camp, Parcells told him to cancel his family's 
flight to New York because the Giants had decided to keep only two quarterbacks 
-- Simms and Jeff Hostetler. 
</P>
<P>
Then after coming off the bench and throwing three touchdown passes in a 
quarter against the Kansas City Chiefs, Parcells called him out of a meeting 
and said: "Tell Laura to get out there. I can't cut you after that." 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't always smooth. The Giants left Rutledge unprotected in both years 
of Plan B free agency and, after he didn't get an offer the first year, cut his 
salary by $175,000. Last spring, he did get an offer, from the Redskins. When 
he asked Parcells for a guarantee he'd be back in New York, Parcells said he 
couldn't give him one. 
</P>
<P>
Rutledge signed with the Redskins and had a tremendous training camp, looking 
like the best of the team's quarterbacks. But Mark Rypien was the starter. Then 
Rypien got hurt. Then Stan Humphries threw nine interceptions in a four-game 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Rutledge with the Redskins trailing the Detroit Lions, 35-14. He 
completed 30 of 42 for 363 yards and a touchdown and the Redskins won, 41-38, 
in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever said he doesn't have a strong enough arm was wrong," Gibbs said. 
"Every ball he threw deep was on the money. He hit Gary Clark twice against 
man-to-man coverage, and those were deep corner routes, the hardest to throw. 
</P>
<P>
"He hit the pump up the middle to Ricky Sanders, another tough one. He threw a 
(40-yard) pump to Art Monk, and there's not many guys around that could throw 
that. He gets the ball very quick. He makes great decisions. He's got great 
timing and a feel for when to get it in there. 
</P>
<P>
"And he has a football awareness that makes him the kind of quarterback that 
can get things done. You don't do all the things he has done unless you have a 
lot to you. He's also extremely mentally tough. I don't think you'll intimidate 
him, which is the No. 1 quality I'd like to have in a quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
Rutledge laughs off any mention of pressure. Pressure? That's playing high 
school football in Birmingham on a team that won 36 straight games. That's 
falling to the ground his junior season and seeing a piece of bone sticking out 
of his left arm. That's going face to face with Bear Bryant in his living room. 
</P>
<P>
He knew he was going to Alabama, but he felt taken for granted. He worked up 
his courage and he challenged the great Bear. 
</P>
<P>
Would he be jerked from games like his brother had been? Yes, Bryant mumbled. 
Would be able to throw the ball more? No. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as I'm winning, I'll do what I want to do," Bryant said, adding that 
if he was really interested in winning games and playing for a national 
championship, Alabama was his only choice. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure is walking into Bryant's office and telling him you're getting married 
a week after a Sugar Bowl game against Woody Hayes and the Buckeyes. 
</P>
<P>
"You had to get his blessing," Rutledge said. "My brother had done the same 
thing and he said it took him two days to work up the courage. He actually went 
one day and turned around and came home. I said I wasn't going to do that. I'm 
going to get married the week after we play Ohio State in the Sugar Bowl, and 
we're fighting for a national championship, ranked No. 4 in the country. We've 
got a legitimate shot at it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a nervous wreck and must have walked down that hallway 10 times, right 
past his office. Finally, I got the guts to go in. I sat down and said: 'I want 
to share with you some plans I've made.' He didn't say anything and I started 
talking and told him. 
</P>
<P>
"That caught his attention and he said: 'Your mind isn't going to be on the 
ballgame.' I said I won't let it come in the way of that. Then he paused and it 
seemed like forever. I'm sweating, nervous and waiting to hear what he's going 
to say. He looks up and says: 'Do you love her?' I said, 'Yes sir, I do.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bryant asked: Does she love you? Did you talk to her parents? Did you talk to 
your parents? Rutledge nodded yes to every question. 
</P>
<P>
" 'All right,' Bryant said, 'but you better have your mind on that ballgame.' 
We end up beating Ohio State, 35-7, and I was the MVP of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"He was so intimidating, and I'm not sure he meant to be. He's the type guy 
that if you saw him coming, you'd try to find the nearest door to hide in. He 
always called me Jack Rutledge. 
</P>
<P>
"There'd be games where he'd ask for players who'd played years earlier, and 
the assistant coaches would go crazy trying to figure who he meant. If the guy 
was a center, they'd get all the centers together. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd have a walk after every pregame meal. He'd say: 'I want to have a walk 
with the quarterbacks.' My brother told me the speech and I knew it verbatim 
before I ever heard it the first time. It hadn't changed from when my brother 
was there. 
</P>
<P>
"It was, 'In crucial situations, run your best ballcarrier behind your best 
blocker. Throw when the defense least expects it.' It was the same thing week 
after week, year after year. We'd take off and be probably 10 yards away and 
he'd turn around and say: 'Be brave, be brave.' " 
</P>
<P>
Rutledge came to Washington having made a nice career out of working hard and 
staying ready. One part of Gibbs surely wanted to enter a season with Mark 
Rypien, Stan Humphries and rookie Cary Conklin. 
</P>
<P>
But what if the Redskins were down by 21 in Detroit? Would that be the time to 
throw Conklin to the wolves? 
</P>
<P>
"I quit complaining after a while," Rutledge said. "Because of the way I was 
raised. If you're supposed to play, the Good Lord can work it out. I didn't 
like it. I didn't like it at all. They tried to get rid of me a lot of years. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill (Parcells) would challenge me in the offseason and I'd come in in great 
shape and wouldn't let him cut me. I haven't been to one training camp in 12 
years that I felt confident at the end of camp I'd be there. I went into every 
one fighting to keep my job." 
</P>
<P>
And he went into each of the last eight seasons playing behind Simms, who was 
becoming one of the NFL's most durable quarterbacks. Now, when he surely 
thought there'd never be another chance, there is one more. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife told me I ought to retire after Sunday's game," he said. "If it works 
out, great. If it doesn't, that's great, too. I'm thankful for the opportunity 
and I've got to be relaxed and go out and do the best I can. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people have really seen me play a whole lot to know if I have 
talent or not. I was labeled a backup pretty early in my career. I knew things 
could change, that I was still one play away. I'm hoping to make the best of it 
now whether it's just against Philly or it can continue."

CSUN LOSES SERVICES OF 2 MORE PLAYERS; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: ROSTER DOWN TO 11 ATHLETES LESS THAN THREE WEEKS BEFORE THE 
MATADORS' DIVISION I DEBUT. 
</P>

Cal State Northridge lost two more basketball players Tuesday, reducing its 
roster to 11 going into its opener and NCAA Division I debut Nov. 23 at 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Starting point guard Eugene Humphrey left the team to concentrate on his 
studies and reserve swingman Erik Cooper was declared academically ineligible 
for the fall semester. Both are seniors. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Kirk Scott is the only player back from last year's team. The 
latest departures bring to eight the number of players who have either left the 
team or become ineligible since last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that I am unable to give 100% to both school and basketball," said 
Humphrey, a transfer from Cerritos College who averaged 6.9 points and 3.5 
assists a game last season. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey was more interested in another number -- his grade-point average, 
which recently dropped below 3.0, a level unacceptable according to Humphrey's 
standards. That, combined with a tough academic load, led to his decision to 
concentrate on school. 
</P>
<P>
"I have four 400-level classes," said Humphrey, a political science major. 
"They all require a lot of attention." 
</P>
<P>
CSUN Coach Pete Cassidy was saddened, if not surprised, by Humphrey's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts," Cassidy said. "But at the same time I honor his feelings about his 
schoolwork. He is an ultra-conscientious kid. He feels like when he is on the 
court he should be in the library." 
</P>
<P>
According to Cassidy, Humphrey set a fine example for a team of newcomers who 
are trying to learn to play together. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a great work ethic," Cassidy said. "He never loafed, ever, and he was 
an excellent listener." 
</P>
<P>
Although Humphrey's role was to push the pace in the Matadors' new run-and-gun 
offense, he also was asked to provide a scoring touch. 
</P>
<P>
"He was shooting the lights out (in practice)," Cassidy said. "He took to that 
one (point) position very well." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Cassidy will move Keith Gibbs, a West Valley College transfer, 
to the point to replace Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
A gifted outside shooter, Gibbs will have to run the offense until either 
freshman Andre Chevalier, of Cleveland High, or freshman Martin Smith, a former 
St. Bernard High standout, emerges to take control. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper's loss will be felt primarily at the offensive end. Although he was not 
expected to start, he scored 25 points in the first intrasquad game and gave 
the Matadors depth at shooting guard. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cooper's grade-point average is above the minimum 2.0, he unwittingly 
repeated a course. As a result, he did not receive credit for it and fell one 
unit shy of the number needed for athletic eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this season, forward Percy Fisher was deemed academically ineligible, 
and Jemarl Baker quit the team to take care of family responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
In the off-season, several players transferred, including Kendell McDaniels 
(Cal State Bakersfield), Bill Mazurie (Cal Poly San Luis Obispo), Sandy Brown 
(Occidental), and Shanan Rosenberg (UC Davis).

academically ineligible for the Cal State Northridge men's team since last 
season was incorrectly stated in Wednesday's edition. The latest departures 
bring to 10 the number of players who will not compete for the team this 
semester.

FILLMORE'S TORY CABRAL EMBODIES SMALL-TOWN FLAVOR OF 80-YEAR-OLD SANTA PAULA 
RIVALRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Drive beyond the endless tract homes west of the San Fernando Valley and head 
up into the sparse canyons of northeastern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Follow the winding road up, up on a bright, brilliant autumn afternoon and 
descend, slowly, into the remote little town of Fillmore, pop. 12,000. 
</P>
<P>
Drive down Central Avenue. Drive past pharmacies and grocery stores, an old 
movie theater and City Hall. Breathe crisper air and look at bluer skies as you 
make your way up the street to Fillmore High, where the hometown Flashes will 
play host to archrival Santa Paula on Friday night in the teams' 80th meeting, 
the latest in the oldest rivalry in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
It is a game that will decide the Frontier League championship. It is a game of 
such importance to the locals that extra seating has been brought in to 
accommodate the expected overflow crowd. 
</P>
<P>
It is a game that Tory Cabral hopes to make his own. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore has been Cabral's town all his life. And Friday night will represent 
the regular-season end of his high school football career -- a career that has 
seen the senior tailback play on two of the best teams in school history and 
set school records by the bushel. 
</P>
<P>
Tory Cabral, 6-foot, 176 pounds, might not be headed to a Division I college 
after this season. It is likely that he will play at a junior college next 
fall, either Moorpark or Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
But for one final Friday night, Cabral will be the big man on a little campus 
-- and the big man in a little town. 
</P>
<P>
He will walk down streets in Fillmore this week, and store owners will ask 
about his ankle, sprained two weeks ago in a win over Bishop Diego and still 
tender in this, the week of the big game. Elementary school kids will play 
touch football in the cool November afternoon, imagining the day they can be 
like Tory Cabral and play in a game for all the marbles. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Curtis Garner of Fillmore (8-1, 2-1 in league play) and Coach Mike 
Tsoutsouvas of Santa Paula (7-2, 3-0) will have little trouble firing up the 
charges for this game. The players know each other well, growing up just nine 
miles apart in, as Tsoutsouvas says, "the towns that time forgot." 
</P>
<P>
Both know that Cabral, who has gained 984 yards and scored 12 touchdowns in six 
full games this season, has the ability to play a hero's role in a game such as 
this. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if Tory doesn't play, it will still be a hard-hitting game," Garner said. 
"But to lose him would take the wind out of our sails. You can't lose a kid of 
Tory's magnitude and not have an effect." 
</P>
<P>
War stories back him up. Especially the one from the 35-28 win over Bishop 
Diego on Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore trailed at one point, 28-7. By the time it was over, Cabral had scored 
all five of his team's touchdowns and kicked three point-after conversions to 
account for 33 of Fillmore's 35 points. After scoring the game's final 
touchdown, Cabral intercepted a Bishop Diego pass to kill the final drive and 
keep Fillmore's then-unbeaten record intact. 
</P>
<P>
"He just took matters into his own hands, so to speak," Garner said. 
</P>
<P>
One gets the point -- Cabral scores a lot of them. In fact, as the team's 
kicker and star runner, he twice has scored all of the team's points in games 
this season and has racked up 104 points to rank second among area scorers. 
</P>
<P>
But try getting Cabral to talk about that and you might as well try to tackle 
him in the open field. He is small-town shy and deflects all praise to the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"After that game, everybody was like, 'You won the game,' " Cabral said. "It's 
nice and all, but it's not me. It's everybody else. It's our line, it's our 
defense. It's everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Although it may take everybody to win, Garner knows that performances such as 
Cabral's are not easy to come by. It is no wonder that Cabral will leave 
Fillmore as one of the 770-student school's most prolific performers. Upon 
review, it is little wonder that Cabral, as a junior, was selected to The 
Times' All-Ventura County team and selected first-team All-Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
In the Bishop Diego game Cabral set a school record for most points in a game. 
A 275-yard performance last year stands as the school single-game rushing 
record. A 92-yard punt return also is a school mark. His total of 1,254 yards 
as a junior is the most in school history, accomplished for a team whose 10-2 
record is the school's best. 
</P>
<P>
The records don't stop there. Cabral holds the school mark for points (104) and 
touchdowns (14) in a season. Seven school records for one player is not bad for 
a school that opened in 1910. 
</P>
<P>
Other coaches know and respect such numbers. Tsoutsouvas expects to see No. 22 
on Friday night hitting holes and gaining yards. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll be ready to play," Tsoutsouvas said. "He's got good quickness, good 
lateral movement. Just having him there will be a real uplift to their team." 
</P>
<P>
Any doubts whether Cabral will play? Bet on it. Cabral has a history of defying 
the medical community -- most recently in the Bishop Diego exhibition. After 
Cabral scored the fifth touchdown that night, he severely turned his ankle in 
the end zone. The pain, as he recalls it, was agonizing. But any talk of him 
leaving the game? Hogwash. 
</P>
<P>
"My teammates came over and said, 'Get up, I'll carry you,' " Cabral said. "I 
said, 'No, no. I feel good. Watch. I'll get up.' " 
</P>
<P>
Cabral stood, tied his shoelaces and sprinted off the field. "I just forgot 
about the pain," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But when he got home that night, the pain didn't forget him. He couldn't sleep 
all night and stayed on crutches the following week, sitting out the Nordhoff 
game. He carried the ball just three times last week against Calabasas, and the 
Flashes were handed a stunning 13-7 upset loss, spoiling their unbeaten record. 
</P>
<P>
This week, however, there will be no sitting out. These two communities have 
been banging helmets since 1910. There's history here -- Tory's father Joe 
played at Santa Paula and his mother Georgia attended Fillmore. Joe now works 
as a foreman in Fillmore. Georgia works as a sewing machine operator a block 
away. 
</P>
<P>
This is the kind of community in which high school football exploits are meant 
to be recounted on lazy afternoons in the local barber shop. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the outcome Friday, they will remember Tory Cabral when he leaves 
Fillmore High. Perhaps even a dedication -- how does Tory Cabral Field sound? 
</P>
<P>
Cabral smiles shyly. He knows that there's no such possibility. But isn't it 
nice to think so? 
</P>
<P>
"Wow," he says. "That would be something, wouldn't it?" 
</P>

BASKETBALL AT MONROE HITS PRIME TIME

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two basketball games will be played today in the Monroe High gym. Fans will 
fill the stands. Referees will control the flow. 
</P>
<P>
School spirit will soar higher than a half-court bomb at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
In the first week of November? 
</P>
<P>
If this sounds a little bogus, it is. In fact, it is all make-believe. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe's basketball team and gymnasium will be featured in an episode of the 
NBC television series "Life Stories," which airs Sunday nights at 8. 
</P>
<P>
According to first-year Monroe Coach Wendell Greer Jr., the episode centers on 
a fictional high school player with a congenital heart problem. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a Hank Gathers type of situation," Greer said. "The player has to decide 
whether to continue playing or whether to quit basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Viking players will be featured in four scenes, Greer said. Two will feature 
the team at practice and two will be of simulated games. The Monroe team will 
be excused from school today for filming. The show is tentatively scheduled to 
air in late December. 
</P>
<P>
The program has provided an early test of Greer's coaching abilities. After 
all, Monroe was 3-14 last season. Will anybody believe this is an actual team? 
</P>
<P>
"That was our biggest acting job right there," Greer cracked. STEVE ELLING

POWAY, MT. CARMEL ADVANCE IN GIRLS' VOLLEYBALL TOURNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The top two seeds advanced to the Division I quarterfinals of the San Diego 
Section Girls' Volleyball Tournament Tuesday, as No. 1 Poway and No. 2 Mt. 
Carmel each won in three games. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Aboyme had 16 kills as Mt. Carmel (12-8) defeated Chula Vista (5-11), 
15-0, 15-13, 15-13. Poway defeated Morse, 15-0, 15-6, 15-5, as freshman Kara 
Milling had six kills. Robin Miller had four blocks and four kills and Heather 
Burke three aces for the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego Section girls' tennis: 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines 18, San Dieguito 0 -- Second-seeded Torrey Pines (21-0) moved one 
step closer to a championship rematch with Poway in the Section 3-A Girls' 
Tennis Team Tournament by defeating San Dieguito (13-9) in the quarterfinals. 
Sophomores Erin Bohrnstedt and Alison McNellis, and senior Krista Kuechler each 
won all but one game in their three singles sets. The Falcons will face 
fourth-seeded Mira Mesa (15-2), a 13-5 winner over Monte Vista, in today's 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Poway 15, Morse 13 -- No. 2-Poway (15-5), which defeated Torrey Pines, 10-8, in 
the 1989 final, also advanced to a semifinal match today against third-seeded 
Bonita Vista (17-1), which defeated Patrick Henry, 16-2. Morse finished 8-8. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla 14, LJCD 4 -- Top-seeded La Jolla (19-1) advanced to the semifinals of 
the 2-A tournament by eliminating La Jolla Country Day (14-6). La Jolla, led by 
Lynn Coakley at No. 1, sophomore Renee Gold and LeeAnn Rostovsky, who did not 
lose a game, swept the singles matches. 
</P>
<P>
San Pasqual 9, Coronado 9 (San Pasqual 80-72, games) -- No. 2-San Pasqual 
(19-1) survived a scare from Coronado (14-6), earning the victory by winning 
more games. San Pasqual singles player Christi Blount overcame a 2-1 deficit to 
win the final set, 6-2. San Pasqual will face USDHS (13-3), a 15-3 winner over 
Grossmont, and La Jolla plays crosstown rival Bishop's (15-5), an 11-7 winner 
over Valhalla, in today's semifinals.

RAINBOW WARRIORS HOPE FOR LOW SCORE

<TEXT>
<P>
Hawaii Coach Bob Wagner figures he knows what it will take to beat the Aztecs 
Saturday at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I think for us to win, it has to be a fairly low-scoring game," Wagner said 
Tuesday in a conference call. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to win if the score is in the mid-30s or higher, I don't 
think." 
</P>
<P>
The Rainbow Warriors are ranked first in the WAC in total defense, allowing an 
average of 306 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU, though, is ranked second in the WAC in total offense, averaging 490 yards 
a game. And on the heels of a 66-14 pounding of Utah, the Aztecs are feeling 
particularly confident this week. 
</P>
<P>
"Offensively, we might be close to Brigham Young or Houston, where the balance 
in our offense is difficult to defend," Luginbill said. "It doesn't matter who 
we're playing." SCOTT MILLER

JAMES FLANIGAN: THE HIGHWAY TO RAISING U.S. PRODUCTIVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For all its importance, the issue that may turn out to be the economic hallmark 
of the 1990s -- public investment in roads and bridges, sewers and airports -- 
attracted little controversy in Tuesday's elections. 
</P>
<P>
When all the returns are counted, they'll probably show that voters in many 
states approved bond issues for water and sewage plants, toll roads and public 
transit, housing, airports and all those other things called infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
That has been the trend in recent years since voters realized that 
shortchanging infrastructure was false economy. Neglect has left bridges 
unsafe, water mains rusting and highways buckling. Voters have been saying yes 
to public works bond issues, since three people died in the 1983 collapse of a 
highway bridge in Connecticut and especially since the Nimitz Freeway collapse 
in last year's Bay Area earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
That trend could accelerate in the '90s for several reasons. First, America's 
public facilities continue to deteriorate, increasing the cost of fixing or 
replacing them. By a conservative estimate of the Government Finance Officers 
Assn. -- 12,000 state, county and municipal budget directors -- public spending 
must double to almost $150 billion a year to bring facilities up to proper 
standards and handle new growth. 
</P>
<P>
But the money would be well spent, say many experts, because it would provide 
America a way out of its economic doldrums. The nation has paid a higher price 
than it realizes for letting infrastructure decay, says economist Alan Blinder 
of Princeton University. 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't been simply inconvenient for trucks to detour around closed bridges 
or flight delays to become common at crowded airports, Blinder suggests. It has 
been unproductive. 
</P>
<P>
Real growth in output per hour -- productivity -- has fallen from 2.3% a year 
in the 1950s and '60s to just about 1% a year in the past two decades. "It's no 
coincidence that public investment -- aside from military spending -- has been 
falling for throughout those two decades," says David Aschauer, an economist 
who developed a new theory on public spending at the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"Public investment in infrastructure inspires private investment," Aschauer 
says. So increased public spending in this decade would revive U.S. 
productivity growth, he says. 
</P>
<P>
History is on Aschauer's side. The Interstate Highway System, begun in 1956, 
gave a big boost to productivity by allowing trucks to move food and 
merchandise faster, and thus to deliver goods more cheaply. The nation got more 
for less: In other words, productivity rose. 
</P>
<P>
The pattern was the same as far back as 1825, when the Erie Canal opened a way 
to get Midwestern farm produce to ports on the Atlantic Ocean. Suddenly, costs 
were cut dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Where it once cost more to ship the grain to port than to ship it across the 
Atlantic, now American farmers and shippers could earn more from the trade and 
whole regions blossomed with new investment. 
</P>
<P>
That may be inspiring history, you say, but how does it apply to the 1990s? 
America may repair its highways, but it won't build a new interstate system. 
And we don't need a new Erie Canal. 
</P>
<P>
No, but America will need new kinds of highways. It will need high-speed 
trains, more sophisticated air traffic control systems and cars that burn clean 
fuel. 
</P>
<P>
And it will need upgraded, fiber optic cable networks for telecommunications, 
if it is to be competitive in the world. "Other countries, particularly France 
and Japan, have made the telecommunications infrastructure the centerpiece of 
their economic planning," says William Davidson, a telecommunications expert at 
the USC School of Business. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Co. -- a partly government-owned 
company -- will spend $210 billion to bring fiber optic cable to every major 
business office by 1995 and to every home by 2000. That will expand the ability 
of companies to efficiently process information, to engineer new designs and 
products, and the ability of Japan's people to communicate and learn. They will 
get more for less. In other words, they will enjoy rising productivity. 
</P>
<P>
And American industry is concerned. "Technological leadership in the 21st 
century will depend on the telecommunications infrastructure," Chairman George 
Fisher of Motorola recently told an audience at Caltech. "And yet our response 
lacks direction, our government has lost its way." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher wasn't calling for government funding for telephone lines. Private 
investment can handle that. But he was calling on government to create a 
framework or, as he put it, to create a modern equivalent of the National 
Weather Service set up 120 years ago this month by the federal government to 
provide weather information for farmers and industry. 
</P>
<P>
He was calling on government to support infrastructure, in other words. And as 
Tuesday's election results showed, the voters are inclined to agree.

PRODUCTIVITY RISES 1.6% IN 3RD PERIOD; HOURS WORKED FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a sign that worried companies are resorting to tough cost-cutting measures, 
U.S. worker productivity rose 1.6% in the July-August period, the Labor 
Department reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The productivity gain underscores the intense pressure faced by many companies 
to stay profitable as business conditions have deteriorated this year. While 
the advance was the sharpest in two years, it also reflected the nation's 
overall economic weakness. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing the effects of companies laying off workers and still managing to 
achieve increases in (work) output," said Lynn Reaser, a vice president and 
senior economist at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. "But I don't think 
it's a sustainable trend." 
</P>
<P>
The gain in productivity -- rising output per hour of work -- occurred at a 
time when hours worked declined by 0.1%, the first decline in more than four 
years. Manufacturing productivity continued to outpace that of overall 
business, rising 5.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Hourly compensation also rose 4.5% -- but actually dropped by 1.8% when 
adjusted for inflation, according to the report, a statistic that suggests wage 
pressures were not contributing to inflation in recent months. At the same 
time, Reaser noted, the data suggest that many workers were not able to keep up 
with the cost of living. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest productivity gains were made by some of the most embattled 
industries -- manufacturers of durable goods such as appliances, furniture and 
other long-lasting products. Productivity jumped 7.3% for that sector. 
</P>
<P>
"We produced more in America with fewer people," observed Joseph A. Wahed, 
chief economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco, adding that "massive 
layoffs in construction and manufacturing" influenced the statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Besides layoffs, employers also have pared their costs by imposing hiring 
freezes and reductions in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Since January, U.S. manufacturing payrolls have fallen by 580,000 workers, the 
Labor Department reports. The labor force that remains is "working fewer hours 
but working harder," Wahed said. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, productivity growth has averaged 1.6% a year -- somewhat higher 
than the performance of the 1970s, but far worse than the 2.5% annual gain 
posted in the decades after World War II. Such gains pave the way for advances 
in living standards without inflation. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, productivity is a key to the nation's economic competitiveness and 
is closely watched by business and government. 
</P>
<P>
The recent advances in efficiency -- while helping corporate bottom lines for

GAS PRICES DIP AS DEMAND SLOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gasoline prices, which gushed after Iraq invaded Kuwait, actually dipped last 
week as demand tapered off during colder weather, the American Automobile Assn. 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The survey of national retail gasoline prices echoed the findings of a separate 
survey released two days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
But the modest decline may be only a momentary respite in an upward price 
spiral that is likely to continue because increases in gasoline prices have 
lagged those of crude oil, from which gasoline is refined, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, light, sweet crude oil for December delivery closed up 67 cents at 
$32.63 a barrel in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the American Petroleum Institute reported Tuesday that stocks of 
crude oil increased for the first time in two months -- to 344.5 million 
barrels in the week ended Nov. 2 from 339.5 million barrels the week before -- 
as crude imports rose strongly to near pre-invasion levels. Crude supplies had 
fallen for seven weeks, as imports dried up under the U.N. embargo on Iraq and 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the automobile association reported that the price of self-serve, 
regular unleaded gasoline, the most popular grade, fell 0.3 cents a gallon last 
week to an average price of $1.377 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first decline since Sept. 18, when prices fell 0.1 cents a gallon, 
the AAA reported. Its survey, released weekly, polls 1,250 service stations 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"The decline is rather modest, but the positive thing that can be said is that 
. . . over the last three weeks, prices have stabilized," said AAA spokesman 
Jerry Cheske in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Two days earlier, the North Hollywood-based Lundberg Survey reported that the 
national average price of all grades of gasoline fell 0.18 cents a gallon over 
the previous two weeks to $1.4691 a gallon as of Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
For Lundberg, it was the first reported decline since the Aug. 2 invasion. The 
Lundberg Survey, released every two weeks, polls 13,500 stations nationally. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a significant stall in the rise . . . that really masks a lot of regional 
differences," said Trilby Lundberg, publisher of the survey that bears her 
name. "Prices on average were still rising on both coasts, while prices in the 
interior were volatile." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the falling national average prices to a seasonal drop in 
demand as motorists cut back driving. "This is the time of the year when 
gasoline prices head south, year in and year out," said Scott Jones, an 
industry analyst and president of AUS Consultants in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
A weak economy and higher prices also are dampening gas demand, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, supplies are ample: the American Petroleum Institute reported 
Tuesday that gasoline supplies rose last week to 221.2 million barrels from 
220.4 million the week before. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the price declines, gasoline remains much more expensive than before 
the invasion. Lundberg said national prices have risen about 29 cents a gallon 
since then; the AAA said prices have gone up 30 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
The two surveys diverged when considering regional price variations. Unlike 
Lundberg, the AAA, while not providing specific figures, reported that the 
price of self-serve unleaded gasoline increased slightly in New England and the 
Great Lakes states but fell everywhere else, including the West. 
</P>
<P>
But Lundberg reported that prices rose on the East and West coasts while 
falling on the Gulf Coast, in the Midwest and the Rocky Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the cash and credit price of unleaded regular self-serve 
gasoline rose slightly to $1.3774 on Nov. 2 from $1.3719 two weeks earlier, the 
Lundberg Survey reported. 
</P>
<P>
Both Cheske and Lundberg said they believed that gasoline prices would probably 
continue to rise in the next few weeks, in part to pass through the increases 
in crude oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
Lundberg said gasoline prices have increased about 25% since the invasion, 
while spot prices for a key crude oil grade have gone up as much as 73% in the 
same time. 
</P>
<P>
But Jones, the Philadelphia analyst, argued that ample supplies, softening 
demand, a looming recession and seasonal slowdowns would combine to move 
gasoline prices even lower. "I expect gasoline prices to continue to fall, and 
I think we'll lose as much as a nickel at the pump over the next four to six 
weeks . . . barring a war," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gasoline Prices Dip as Demand Slows 
</P>
<P>
The Lundberg and AAA surveys measure prices differently, but both indicate a 
slight drop in the national average price of gasoline.

State Tax Rates to Be Indexed for Inflation: Millions of California residents 
whose taxable income was unchanged or increased only slightly this year will 
pay lower state income taxes when they file next year, state Controller Gray 
Davis announced. That is because tax brackets will be indexed 4.8% to account 
for inflation, he said. The state Franchise Tax Board, of which Davis is

2 VOLVO ADS REV UP CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Volvo advertising suddenly appears stuck in reverse. 
</P>
<P>
Just one day after Volvo pulled an advertisement for what company officials 
conceded were misleading statements over how well Volvo cars can stand up to 
giant trucks rolling over them, a spokesman for the Swedish car maker said 
Tuesday that yet another of its newest TV spots is raising the ire of abortion 
rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
That commercial features a video of a fetus -- inside a woman's body -- that 
appears to be waving at the camera. An off-camera spokesman asks, "Is something 
inside you telling you to buy a Volvo?" 
</P>
<P>
That has upset some who favor abortion rights. "My gut reaction is the ad is 
ridiculous," said Renee Schwalberg, a board member of the San Francisco-based 
Committee to Defend Reproductive Rights. "It definitely gives a fetus a greater 
autonomy than it really has. It's clearly a distortion." 
</P>
<P>
Although Volvo has received complaints about the ad from both abortion rights 
activists and abortion foes, it says it will continue to run the spot created 
by the New York ad agency Scali, McCabe, Sloves. "We have no plans to pull the 
spot," said Robert Austin, manager of public relations at Rockleigh, N.J.-based 
Volvo Cars of North America. "Corporately, Volvo does not have a position on 
abortion." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Volvo has pulled from television and magazines an advertisement that 
shows a so-called monster truck attempting to crush a row of cars with only a 
Volvo car remaining intact. Following a lawsuit brought by the attorney general 
of Texas, where the ad was filmed, the company ran an advertisement Tuesday in 
the Wall Street Journal, U.S.A Today and 19 Texas newspapers that acknowledged 
the demonstration in the ad was rigged. 
</P>
<P>
"The advertisement . . . inaccurately characterized the event as a car-crushing 
exhibition when in fact it was a dramatization of the actual event," said an 
open letter from Joseph L. Nicolato, president and chief executive of Volvo 
Cars of North America. "It was never the intention of Volvo to produce an 
advertisement that deceived or misled."

Commissioner Lawrence W. Taggart received a $50,000 consulting fee from 
now-defunct Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan within a week after he left office, the 
San Francisco Chronicle reported. The check was written 27 days after Taggart 
approved a request by Lincoln involving $900 million in taxpayer-insured 
deposits, the newspaper said. Taggart has denied wrongdoing in the case.

In the early 1970s, Monsanto Co. and Harvard University embarked on a 12-year, 
$10-million partnership that was expected to yield a harvest of scientific 
discovery and financial reward. But although the project came up with some 
interesting science, it could claim little in the way of significant commercial 
value. 
</P>
<P>
Undeterred, Monsanto tried again in the 1980s, this time with Washington 
University, which is near the company's St. Louis headquarters. The $62-million 
project included shared decision making and the movement of scientists between 
the two institutions. After eight years, with adjustments on both sides, the 
university and Monsanto say the partnership has worked well; by 1989, more than 
40 patent applications had been filed. 
</P>
<P>
From this experience, in addition to some interesting science, Monsanto has 
learned that partnerships between corporations and universities can be tricky 
endeavors -- and that they can also be highly successful. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, that second perspective is an important one for corporations and 
universities to gain, for the two need each other as never before. 
</P>
<P>
For centuries, business and academe have believed that they have little in 
common. After all, the business of business is to make money, while the 
business of universities is to seek knowledge. Traditionally, academic 
institutions have resisted anything that might corrupt the purity of their 
pursuits. Corporate involvement, it has long been feared, might prostitute 
science to profit. 
</P>
<P>
Business, on the other hand, has often failed to understand the exploratory and 
incremental nature of scientific research and has been frustrated by what it 
sees as the high cost and unfocused activity of academic science. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, those mutual misunderstandings have become costly. Not so long 
ago, the 1990s were being touted as the decade of biotechnology, when the 
scientific discoveries of the previous two decades would be transformed into 
profitable products for U.S. corporations. So far, few of those dreams have 
been realized. The United States is now fifth in the number of patents 
obtained. In recent years, Japan has introduced three times the number of 
biomedical products that we have. 
</P>
<P>
Our inability to gain pre-eminence in the biomedical industry can be traced, at 
least in part, to the failure of our companies and universities to form strong 
and productive alliances. 
</P>
<P>
Misunderstandings between the two have not only been costly for industry, they 
have adversely affected the academic world. Federal money, which has funded so 
many of the major scientific breakthroughs at universities in recent years, can 
no longer sustain the momentum it helped to create. The costs of training 
scientists, acquiring sophisticated instruments and maintaining first-rate 
scientific establishments have grown beyond the means of even the richest 
universities, and seed money to develop promising scientific ideas is almost 
impossible to find. 
</P>
<P>
In short, business and academe can no longer afford to ignore each other. 
Mistrust must give way to mutual understanding. As is often the case, however, 
finding the right chemistry will take time. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, both sides need to understand that they bring different 
strengths to research efforts. Pharmaceutical development, for instance, takes 
years to complete. University laboratories can contribute the most in the early 
stages, by providing ideas, tools and the initial leads that flow into the 
research pipeline. Industry, on the other hand, can provide greater expertise 
later on, when it comes to defining and developing products and securing 
regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
The risks, costs and rewards associated with various stages of development 
differ tremendously. It is important, therefore, that each partner define its 
goals and objectives, the scope of collaboration, terms of ownership and 
provisions for cashing out. Most important, both players need to have realistic 
expectations of the returns appropriate to their level of participation. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, realistic expectations may be the key to success in nearly all 
facets of corporate and academic partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
Any company expecting a quick payoff will be disappointed; it must be willing 
to count the smallest deposit in the bank of knowledge as part of the total 
return. A company should define its "basic science" objectives, be willing to 
learn from the academic team, hold reasonably frequent integrated review 
meetings and, where possible, exchange scientists. 
</P>
<P>
In a successful partnership, a company invests more than money in the 
university lab; it commits time and staff. 
</P>
<P>
Universities, too, need realistic expectations. Those that expect high up-front 
fees and large royalties need to understand that only products well along in 
the development process will produce significant licensing revenue. Early-stage 
products and processes bear too high an investment risk to justify high 
licensing prices. 
</P>
<P>
Academic scientists need to recognize that business partnerships require 
different operating procedures from academic ones. At the very least, most 
entrepreneurial efforts begin with a new budget and staff. Researchers are 
expected to focus -- for sustained periods -- on their projects. And there is 
the expectation that research centers themselves must invest in the products 
they help develop, thereby acknowledging that large rewards often require 
substantial risk. 
</P>
<P>
As Monsanto has discovered during the past two decades, such partnerships are 
not without their problems. But they can, when structured properly, prove 
beneficial for both sides.

America's most famous brothel, the 105-bed Mustang Ranch, goes on the block 
next week at an initial offering price of $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
The brothel in northern Nevada, the only state where brothels are legal, was 
closed by U.S. government tax collectors in September after owners Joe and 
Sally Conforte failed to pay about $13 million in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The brothel will be opened for public inspection Saturday, and the auction 
itself is set for Nov. 13-14, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The property -- about 330 acres of land, several buildings decorated in pinks, 
purples, reds and greens -- carries an opening bid of $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Memorabilia that includes scanty lingerie, huge paintings of nudes and a 
jukebox that plays such tunes as "Let's Do It Again" will be sold individually. 
</P>
<P>
One sign going on sale gives patrons in the mirrored Orgy Room directions to 
the nearest exit in case of fire. 
</P>
<P>
IRS official Diedre Pagni said the sale was being advertised in publications 
nationwide and had already brought inquiries from individuals interested in 
purchasing the ranch, which Conforte turned into a brothel in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Pagni said potential buyers suggested that they might want to turn the "ranch" 
into a nursing home or religious retreat.

CLASS-ACTION SUIT CONTENDS 7 U.S. AIRLINES FIXED PRICES

A federal judge in Atlanta will hear a consolidated lawsuit alleging collusion 
and price fixing by some of the nation's major airlines and their computerized 
fare network. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-one claims filed nationwide were consolidated Friday in the court of 
U.S. District Judge Marvin H. Shoob. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit alleges that the airlines use computers to signal fare changes to 
each other, agree on price increases and threaten fare cuts. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the alleged collusion, the suit charges that passengers are 
forced to pay artificially high ticket prices. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants are USAir, Northwest, Delta, Continental, United, TWA and 
American airlines and a Washington-based computer clearinghouse, Airline Tariff 
Publishing Co. 
</P>
<P>
A panel of federal judges decided that Atlanta was most accessible to all 
parties in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
If Shoob certifies the suit as a class action, a decision expected early next 
year, the plaintiffs could number in the millions. Customers who purchased a 
plane ticket since 1987 could potentially be a party to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1988, 150 million tickets were sold, so that would give you a rough idea of 
the possible magnitude of this case," said W. Pitts Carr, the Atlanta attorney 
who filed the first suit here last July. "There are literally tens of millions 
of people or companies who are potential class members." 
</P>
<P>
The defendants deny the charges. 
</P>
<P>
"Delta denies totally the allegations . . . concerning our participation in any 
conspiracy to fix prices," said Edward B. Krugman, one of the airline's 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
The suit seeks undetermined damages that could be tripled under federal 
antitrust laws. It also asks that the airlines be restrained from further 
violation of antitrust laws and that the computer network be "restructured so 
as to discourage future collusion among airlines."

CONTINENTAL AIR REPORTS LOSS OF $88.3 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Continental Airlines Holdings, which considered bankruptcy two weeks ago, said 
Tuesday that it lost $88.3 million in the third quarter on revenue of $1.5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Continental, the Houston-based parent of Continental and Eastern airlines, 
blamed high fuel costs and soft travel demand for much of the loss. 
Continental's results were also hurt by a $17-million severance payment to 
former Chairman Frank Lorenzo, who agreed in August to sell his Continental 
stock and options to Scandinavian Airlines Systems at nearly three times the 
market price. 
</P>
<P>
The airline said its results were hurt by a $15-million expense related to the 
SAS transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Airline industry analysts said Tuesday that Continental's results were in line 
with expectations. Other airlines, including Delta and USAir, have reported 
large fuel-related third-quarter losses. 
</P>
<P>
Continental Chairman Hollis Harris said in a statement that fuel costs 
"exacerbated our losses." He said fuel had surpassed wages as the airline's 
greatest expense, and that Continental's fuel bill in October was $70 million 
higher than in normal times. Jet fuel prices have risen dramatically since 
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Continental's difficult financial situation caused it to consider, but reject, 
a bankruptcy filing two weeks ago. The company instead said it would sell 
assets to raise money and look for help from a possible investor. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, however, the airline said it was taking its valuable Honolulu-Tokyo 
route off the market. The airline had said earlier that it might sell its Air 
Micronesia unit, which holds the governmental authority to fly from Honolulu to 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Continental's third-quarter loss doesn't include results of its Eastern 
Airlines subsidiary. Eastern, which is in bankruptcy proceedings, has been run 
by a court-appointed trustee since April 10. Continental lost $158 million on 
revenue of $1.7 billion in the third quarter of 1989, a period when Eastern 
posted huge losses. 
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of 1990, the company lost $97 million on revenue of 
$4.9 billion. That compares to a loss of $522.8 million on revenue of $5 
billion in the first nine months of 1989. Continental released the earnings 
statement after the markets closed. The company's stock closed up 12 1/2 cents 
at $2.75 a share on the American Stock Exchange on Tuesday.

ELIGIBILITY SCHEME ALLEGED; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: MONTCLAIR PREP IS ACCUSED OF FAKING FOUR ATHLETES' LIVING 
ARRANGEMENTS IN '85. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Montclair Prep of Van Nuys staged a phony living arrangement in the school's 
dormitory to gain athletic eligibility for four football players when the 
school was investigated by the CIF Southern Section in 1985 on charges of 
eligibility infractions, according to four sources close to that team. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Principal V.E. Simpson displayed to Southern Section officials 
the living quarters of four players who the school said lived in an on-campus 
apartment. After that visit, the Southern Section cleared Montclair Prep, a 
licensed boarding school, of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to a former Montclair Prep assistant coach and a former player, 
the living arrangement was staged expressly for the investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson, who founded the school 34 years ago, denied the charges, saying he 
assumed that the players, recent transfers, lived on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Section Commissioner Stan Thomas characterized the charges as serious 
and said he will include them in the current investigation of Montclair Prep on 
charges of grade tampering and nonpayment of tuition by athletes. Those charges 
were lodged against the school after the transfers of Derek and Leland Sparks, 
senior football players who left Montclair Prep in September for Mater Dei of 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation, the third of Montclair Prep in five years, stemmed from 
accusations by the uncle of the Sparks cousins, who said Montclair Prep did not 
charge tuition for his nephews and changed their grades. No hearing date has 
been set in that investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"If the information given today is true, it puts their program at risk," Thomas 
said about the new charges. "We have an interest in Montclair Prep as long as 
they (are) a member of the Southern Section." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Robb, a Montclair Prep assistant from 1982-85, and John DeRouen, one of the 
transfer students who played for the Mounties in 1985-86, said in recent 
interviews that the on-campus living arrangement was a ploy to get athletic 
eligibility for four transfer students from City Section schools. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Lewis, Robb's roommate in the on-campus apartment for three years, also 
said that the players lived on campus only until the school was cleared of 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three other transfer students, Anthony Pack declined comment, and Alex 
DeHayward and Gabriel Alonzo could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section investigated Montclair Prep in 1985, after three players 
from El Camino Real and one from Chatsworth transferred to the private 
nondenominational school in Van Nuys. Under state rules, a student 
automatically gains athletic eligibility when he enrolls as a boarding school 
student for the first time. The student-athlete must live on campus. 
</P>
<P>
If the investigation showed the students not living on campus, the players 
would have lost their eligibility for one year and the team would have been 
forced to forfeit games in which they played. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson, who also has denied the allegations involving the Sparks family, said 
the school will be exonerated. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said he regularly saw the transfer students pass his office in the fall 
of 1985 on their way to the second-floor apartment in the dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't check them at night, but I saw them going up there every day," he 
said. "They kept their stuff there and as far as I know they were there. I 
don't remember all the details. This happened five years ago." 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section's investigation in 1985 was prompted by a letter from Don 
Thomas, an assistant principal at El Camino Real. He questioned the eligibility 
of DeHayward, a senior, and juniors DeRouen and Pack after the three 
transferred and played for the Mounties at the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Alonzo, a senior who transferred from Chatsworth, also joined the Montclair 
Prep team that fall and entered the school as a boarding student along with the 
three El Camino Real transfers. 
</P>
<P>
Don Thomas contacted the Southern Section after he investigated claims that 
DeHayward still lived at home in the El Camino Real attendance area. 
</P>
<P>
"I drove over to his street in Woodland Hills and sat in my car a few houses 
away from his one morning about the second or third week of school," Thomas 
said. "I saw him leaving his house with school books under his arm and he 
looked just like a kid going to school. And Montclair Prep said he was living 
in their dorms. The thing looked just as phony as it could be." 
</P>
<P>
Robb, the team's offensive coordinator under Hazelton, lived in a two-room 
apartment on campus since joining Montclair Prep as a teacher and coach in 
1982. Shortly thereafter, Lewis, then a 23-year-old struggling actor, moved in 
with Robb. The two lived there alone until the end of the 1984-85 school year 
when Holland Smith, a linebacker and tight end, moved in, according to Robb. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall, before the Oct. 17 Southern Section investigation, the school 
installed four cots for the transfers, who brought along personal items to give 
the appearance that they lived there, according to Robb and DeRouen. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to take down our own stuff from the walls and put up stuff from the 
players," Robb said. 
</P>
<P>
John Hazelton, a Montclair Prep assistant coach now but the team's head coach 
in 1985, said he was unaware of any such arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm totally in the dark and completely shocked by this," he said. "The first I 
knew that the Southern Section was coming (to investigate) was the day they 
came out. I have no idea what arrangement the players had with the school with 
regard to boarding. If they fooled the Southern Section, then we were all 
fooled." 
</P>
<P>
Hazelton characterized the transfers as fringe players on a team loaded with 
more talented starters. Montclair Prep had a 10-4 record in 1985 and reached 
the Southern Section Inland Conference final. The team's stars were Rich 
Swinton, now at Washington State, and Reggie Smith Jr., now at Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
DeHayward, however, was a two-way starter at end and a first-team All-Alpha 
League player who was offered a scholarship by USC. Pack, a receiver and 
defensive back, was a second-team all-league player and later earned a 
scholarship to Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
DeRouen, currently a junior guard on the University of La Verne basketball 
team, also earned second-team all-league honors as a wide receiver. Alonzo, a 
nose guard, was injured in a motorcycle accident and was sidelined most of that 
season. 
</P>
<P>
DeRouen said he doesn't remember who asked him to move in with Robb, but claims 
he lived on campus less than a month. At the start of the semester, he lived 
with his mother in Los Angeles. After he tired of the long commute by bus, he 
moved in with teammate Ronald Walker, whose mother rented an apartment close to 
the school in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Pack also lived with the Walkers, according to Walker and DeRouen. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really remember who fixed the situation, but we stayed at school just 
a couple of weeks or a month and then it was OK to move back home," DeRouen 
said. "I don't know if Doc (Simpson) knew about it, but the school was so 
small, I think everybody knew." 
</P>
<P>
Robb, 31, who currently runs his own bodyguard company and paints portraits of 
athletes, acknowledges he was disappointed when he was passed over for the head 
coaching job when Hazelton left after the '85 season. He added, however, that 
he holds the school in high regard and values his experience there. He 
attributes his role in the 1985 controversy to overzealousness.

WARNER GETS HIS RELEASE FROM RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Curt Warner, the once-dominant running back signed by the Rams as a Plan B free 
agent in the off-season, was released Tuesday, probably signaling both the end 
of his eight-year NFL career and the beginning of Marcus Dupree's. 
</P>
<P>
Warner, 29, started the first three games of the season for the Rams but never 
regained the spark of his years with the Seattle Seahawks and was soon brushed 
aside by the emergence of Cleveland Gary as the Rams' main runner. 
</P>
<P>
After his last game as a starter, Sept. 23 against the Philadelphia Eagles, 
Warner carried the ball only 11 times. Capping a career in which he gained 
6,844 yards, Warner this season carried the ball 49 times for 139 yards, a 
2.8-yard average. His longest run was nine yards. 
</P>
<P>
For a player who signed for a salary of $700,000 this season, it was not 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at a point where we just felt like we had to go with other people in 
terms of getting playing time," Ram Coach John Robinson said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave it a great effort in terms of trying to make the transition and trying 
to re-establish his career, but for a number of reasons, things just seemed to 
go out of whack with our early-season disappointment, and things just didn't 
work out." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Warner nor his agent, Marvin Demoff, could be reached for comment. 
Warner apparently was unhappy with the decision and didn't think he was given a 
fair shot at keeping the tailback job. 
</P>
<P>
Warner spent his first seven seasons with the Seahawks before signing with the 
Rams when Seattle left him unprotected in the Plan B free-agency period. He 
gained more than 1,000 yards four times, led the AFC twice, and made the Pro 
Bowl three times. 
</P>
<P>
"It's disappointing because I think he's a good guy and is a good man and gave 
it everything he had," Robinson said. "And you hate to be part of the end of a 
great player. And he may go on -- but I think that part is disappointing. It 
would've been nice to have it come out the way he and I wanted it to." 
</P>
<P>
Did Warner's salary, one of the highest on the team, affect the decision to 
release him? 
</P>
<P>
"Sure," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The move immediately put Gaston Green into the position of main backup and 
gives Dupree both a roster spot and the chance for some playing time. 
</P>
<P>
"Gaston was thrust into the background (by Gary and Warner), and this will give 
him a shot again now," Robinson said. "And also we have to look ahead to the 
future with Marcus Dupree." 
</P>
<P>
Dupree, the former high school and college star trying to make a comeback after 
a five-year layoff because of a knee injury, probably will be activated later 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
In other roster action, cornerback Mickey Sutton was placed on injured reserve 
after injuring his left knee in Sunday's 17-13 victory over the Houston Oilers 
at Anaheim Stadium. Surgery, which was scheduled for Tuesday, was pushed back 
to Friday. The Rams also activated cornerback Clifford Hicks, who was on 
injured reserve all season with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are considering re-signing newly converted wide receiver Alfred 
Jackson, who was a cornerback just a month ago.

TROJANS SAY 'ALOHA' TO SYRACUSE REMATCH; 
</P>
<P>
USC: BOWL DATE IN HONOLULU IS DECLINED WHEN ORANGEMEN, 34-16 LOSERS IN TEAMS' 
OPENER, EMERGE AS PROBABLE OPPONENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After playing its way out of a New Year's Day bowl appearance, USC talked its 
way out of a trip to Honolulu, a spokesman for the Freedom Bowl said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"When I talked with (USC Athletic Director) Mike McGee on Sunday, he told me 
that USC was leaning toward the Aloha Bowl," said Don Andersen, executive 
director of the Freedom Bowl, to be played Dec. 29 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Andersen, who sought the Trojans, said USC apparently reconsidered because its 
opponent in Honolulu on Dec. 25 would have been Syracuse. The Trojans beat the 
Orangemen in their opener, 34-16, and weren't interested in a rematch. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, USC reached a verbal agreement with officials of the John Hancock Bowl 
to play in the New Year's Eve game at El Paso, a spokesman for that bowl said 
Monday. McGee was unavailable for comment, and other USC officials would not 
confirm for the record that an agreement had been reached. 
</P>
<P>
Bowl invitations cannot be officially extended until Nov. 24, but the John 
Hancock Bowl hopes to match USC (6-2-1) against Michigan State, which is 4-3-1 
and would eliminate itself only if it falters in its last three games and 
finishes with a losing record. 
</P>
<P>
"They say they want to come, and we say we want them," John Folmer, chairman of 
the El Paso game's selection committee, said of the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
USC committed for several reasons, according to sources familiar with the 
negotiations: 
</P>
<P>
 -- It offers national exposure. The CBS telecast of the game, which starts at 
11:30 a.m., PST, Dec. 31 will be unopposed by any other game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It might help the Trojans establish an even stronger recruiting base in 
Texas, where several schools, including USC and UCLA, have made significant 
inroads in recent years against the scandal-ridden Southwest Conference 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 -- USC felt it should make a commitment to John Hancock Bowl officials, who 
told the Trojans last month that, barring a total collapse by the Trojans, USC 
would be extended an invitation. 
</P>
<P>
"They told us a few weeks ago that, unequivocally, they wanted us," a USC 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Coach Larry Smith took Arizona to El Paso to play in the game, 
which was formerly called the Sun Bowl, and came away impressed. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, in Smith's first season, USC was set to play in the Sun Bowl 
before it upset UCLA, 17-13, to qualify for the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been there and I related my experience to Mike (McGee) and the 
(university) president (James Zumberge)," Smith said. "It's an excellent bowl. 
They treated us very, very well. The players and people who went had an 
outstanding time. . . . If that's where we end up, I think we'll all be happy." 
</P>
<P>
USC would have been happier, of course, to play in any of the eight New Year's 
Day bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
But after Saturday's 31-31 tie with California, the Trojans' options grew more 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
"We still showed some interest in them, but it was an outside interest," said 
Thad Foret, a spokesman for the Citrus Bowl in Orlando, Fla., Jan. 1. "The tie 
made (a USC appearance) go from a possibility to an outside chance." 
</P>
<P>
A source said USC also was interested in the Holiday Bowl Dec. 29 in San Diego, 
where its fans could more easily attend and the Trojans would possibly be 
paired against Brigham Young and its All-American quarterback, Ty Detmer. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess you could say they had some (interest)," John Reid, executive director 
of the Holiday Bowl, said of the Trojans. "I don't know how serious it was. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd had an ongoing dialogue with them. Of course, it changed from week to 
week, but the word we got was that they were looking to a New Year's Day game. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't anticipate things happening this early, especially with USC, 
considering they had lots of options. But apparently they felt differently."

MELVIN DURSLAG: MANY IN JAMES GANG ARE COMING HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When one operates in a state in which the whole population runs only about a 
third that of Los Angeles County, one sits down to think about one's problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We need speed," one says. "In Southern California, there is ample speed. USC 
and UCLA have access to it, but there is more speed in Southern California than 
both have need for. Would it not be almsgiving on their part to share the 
excess speed with their neighbors?" 
</P>
<P>
This is how Don James, coach of Washington, goes about collecting material to 
develop outstanding football teams in his precinct. At season's end, bowl bids 
are handed out, and it usually happens Washington is bagging one. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, this is only the first week in November and already Washington 
has arranged a visit to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Soon to turn 58, James is a quiet, unpretentious individual, rarely given to 
discussing his skills, but he is one of the best football coaches in this 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
He has what is called a good touch. His teaching is sound, but not without a 
creative flair unexpected of one so superficially plain. 
</P>
<P>
But then it is said that the best comedy is written by those you would never 
suspect. A Boston baseball writer, famous as a clubhouse wit, used to irritate 
the late Jimmy Cannon. 
</P>
<P>
We were present the day the gregarious writer, launching one yak after the 
other, was interrupted by Jimmy, who growled: 
</P>
<P>
"Be funny in the paper." 
</P>
<P>
The guy didn't know how. 
</P>
<P>
Don James, you might say, is funny in the paper, putting out a team this year 
rising dangerously high in the national ratings and, in fact, judged the best 
by some. 
</P>
<P>
Competing against USC and UCLA for Southern California livestock, supplementing 
what he captures in Puyallup, Snohomish and Yakima, James allows the problem 
isn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to realize that we aren't the only outsiders who work California," he 
says. "The Big Eight is there heavy. So are the Oregon and Arizona schools, 
Notre Dame and other independents. We have to move about in search for talent. 
But Nebraska has the same problem." 
</P>
<P>
Don is asked, "How do you sell Southern California athletes on Seattle?" 
</P>
<P>
"It is easier to sell them on Seattle than on drab places in the Midwest," he 
answers. "There is a livability about Seattle that appeals to people who are 
used to areas hot and crowded." 
</P>
<P>
Completing his 16th year at Washington, where he has experienced but one losing 
season, James hardly has gone unnoticed by owners in pro football. 
</P>
<P>
One such owner we know telephoned Don, establishing clearly that salary was no 
object if he was interested in shifting to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
James never sparred with him, testing how far the owner would go. Don answered 
immediately he preferred to stay at Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I am just more comfortable with college football," he says. "I like the 
environment. I like the players. And while everyone gives thought to money, I 
am taken care of well enough around here to get along fine." 
</P>
<P>
James has weekly radio and TV shows to fatten his income and, it is recommended 
here, that players and their coach receive a winning Rose Bowl share of $64,000 
a man. 
</P>
<P>
To get his team ready for the upcoming game in Pasadena, James plans to ship 
out from Seattle as soon as his scholars finish exams, which could be Dec. 20 
"or even a day earlier." 
</P>
<P>
"Once exams are out of the way, there is nothing to keep us in Seattle," James 
explains. "Our training facilities are outdoors, meaning it's cold and it's 
wet. We will settle down in Southern California, train in the sun and have a 
good time. That's what bowl games are for." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, attitudes on bowl games have changed since Woody Hayes graced the 
scene. Training for a Rose Bowl one time, Woody employed an armed guard at the 
field. Many feared a kid would try to sneak under the fence and the guard would 
shoot him dead. 
</P>
<P>
Woody rejected luxury sedans to drive his players to practice, opting for old 
buses with hard seats. Social functions were mostly out. Interviews were 
entirely out. 
</P>
<P>
Crossing the hotel lobby, spotting one of his troops talking to a reporter, 
Woody stopped in horror. He screamed at the player: 
</P>
<P>
"Tell the son of a bitch about Little Red Riding Hood!" 
</P>
<P>
It was a tale I looked forward to hearing.

A taxpayer-funded stadium for the San Francisco Giants in Santa Clara, promoted 
as the last chance to keep the baseball team in Northern California, trailed in 
early returns. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed 1% utility tax, to finance a $153-million stadium, was losing in 
absentee ballot returns from five cities in Santa Clara County. Also trailing 
was a measure to allow use of city-owned land in Santa Clara for the ballpark.

Dave Justice, who began the season in the minor leagues, was voted National 
League rookie of the year after hitting 28 home runs for the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
Justice, 24, got most of his homers after he took over in right field when Dale 
Murphy was traded in early August. Justice batted .282 in 127 games, with 78 
runs batted in.

The average baseball salary last season increased 19.8% to $586,816, according 
to a study by management's Player Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
It was the largest increase in one year since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The study showed that the Kansas City Royals had the highest payroll in 
baseball, $23,617,090. The Boston Red Sox were second at $22,713,698, followed 
by the San Francisco Giants at $22,456,224, the Oakland Athletics at 
$22,274,834 and the New York Mets at $22,154,333.

TAKING A DIVE; 
</P>
<P>
SKYDIVERS ARE JUMPING FOR JOY AT AN INCREASING RATE AT PERRIS VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Birds were born to fly, fish to swim and humans to walk the earth. The first 
two know their places. 
</P>
<P>
The other's inclination to tempt the order of nature has led 40 apparently 
stable and intelligent men and women to Perris Valley Airport south of 
Riverside, where they have climbed aboard an ancient plane and sit on the floor 
toboggan style, backs toward a wide-open door. All wear grins, goggles, jump 
suits and parachutes, but the 'chutes are only for the last few thousand feet. 
These folks are about to try to fly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember when sex was safe and skydiving was dangerous?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bumper sticker pasted inside a skydivers' DC-3 
</P>
<P>
For an experienced skydiver, stepping out of an airplane is as natural as 
falling off a log -- a log 2 1/2 miles up. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so natural, it takes very little training," says Tim Domenico, who has 
jumped about 600 times. 
</P>
<P>
It's an everyday occurrence at Perris Valley, 365 days a year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're aerodynamic," Domenico says. "We leave the airplane when it's going 85 
or 90, which is more than enough air to control your body with little (effort) 
. . . tilt, tuck a shoulder in, stick your legs out, turn with your hands." 
</P>
<P>
It's not cheap -- $18 apiece for the airplane, every time up. The sport costs 
from $2,000 to $10,000 a year, depending on the level of activity. 
</P>
<P>
"But how much would you pay to feel like Superman for 60 seconds?" Domenico 
asks. 
</P>
<P>
In free-falling at a terminal velocity of 120 m.p.h., or 175 feet a second, 
skydivers say they feel more like they're flying than falling. Since it's 
advisable not to land at that speed, they still have to pull the rip cord -- 
except these days they call it the hand deploy pilot chute, a tiny parachute 
that leads the main chute out of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
There's still a big handle for the rip cord on the reserve chute but, hey, they 
hardly ever need that. 
</P>
<P>
Skydiving has come a long way since the 1960s, when white, round, umbrella-like 
military surplus chutes were standard and people broke legs landing at 17 
m.p.h., the equivalent of an eight-foot drop. Now, everybody uses a rectangular 
canopy in his favorite colors, and it is so controllable that, with a little 
practice, a person can turn into the wind and stall just before settling softly 
onto the ground, like stepping off a bus. 
</P>
<P>
"The sport has changed dramatically in the 15 years I've been in it," said 
Domenico, who publishes Paraglider magazine for a later discipline that takes 
skydiving a step farther into inflated canopies for longer flights. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be a bunch of people would drive a mile out of town to a little 
airfield. Half were drunk. There were very few women. There was a time when a 
third of the jumpers in the sport were Hells Angels. But they wouldn't fit in 
here now. They'd feel terribly out of place." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody seems to have a death wish. 
</P>
<P>
"If they did, they wouldn't do this sport, because this sport is not that 
deadly," Domenico said. "We're not daredevils." 
</P>
<P>
Skydivers say there is a rate of only one chute malfunction every 1,000 jumps 
-- and there's always a mandatory reserve chute, which must be inspected and 
repacked by a rigger certified by the Federal Aviation Administration every 
four months. 
</P>
<P>
Perris Valley leads the world with about 100,000 jumps a year. The only 
fatality there in recent memory occurred in September, and it was listed as a 
suicide by the Riverside County coroner because the diver was believed to be 
depressed over personal problems and apparently made no attempt to deploy 
either of his chutes. 
</P>
<P>
He was not typical. Instead, the typical skydiver now "is 26 to 35 years old 
(and) the average educational level is probably two years of college," Domenico 
said. "Fifty percent are probably independent business people. A lot of these 
people are professionals, college educated, drive nice cars with telephones." 
</P>
<P>
Domenico has described the modern young upscale professional: a yuppie. They 
have found their recreational niche. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Falzone, 30, is a product marketing agent from La Canada with 1,300 jumps. 
Two years ago he was part of the 144-way (person) world-record link-up 
formation at Quincy, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
"My first time I was very scared, but I had a great desire to try," he said. 
"Before my parachute landed me on the ground I was hooked." 
</P>
<P>
About 15% of the 23,000 skydivers registered by the United States Parachute 
Assn. are women. Diana Ransome, 32, a schoolteacher from Moreno Valley, with 
450 jumps, said: "It's a stress release, an escape from reality after getting 
from Monday through Friday. (The other teachers) think I'm crazy. They're all 
happy to see me walk into the lounge on Monday morning." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Scalfano, 25, an engineer at McDonnell Douglas, with 57 jumps, said: "I 
relaxed once I finally got it into my head that this was a fun thing. When I 
finished my student jumps I was really proud of myself -- more than when I 
graduated from college. But I don't bring it up at work because I get tired of 
people asking, 'Why would you want to jump out of a perfectly good airplane?' " 
</P>
<P>
Why, indeed? 
</P>
<P>
Domenico said: "The great misconception about this sport is that we jump out of 
airplanes for the thrill of seeing if our parachutes will open. Equipment has 
evolved to where we don't even think about it. We think about the free-fall." 
</P>
<P>
There are notices posted that anyone reported consuming alcohol -- even a beer 
-- or drugs on the day of a jump will be grounded for 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see that twice a year," Domenico said. "But he will be reported, 
because he's not just risking his life." 
</P>
<P>
One of the older skydivers, who has about 5,300 jumps in 31 years, gave his age 
as 52 and his name only as Mongo. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't drink, don't do drugs," he said. "All the rush in the world is here." 
</P>
<P>
"We're adrenaline junkies," said Kate Cooper, who runs the pro shop at the 
skydiving center. "You don't need anything else. It's the best drug there is. 
Your body creates it, and it's free." 
</P>
<P>
 "Skydivers are good to the last drop." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Skydiver dark humor 
</P>
<P>
Veteran skydivers claim their sport is safer than driving to the airport to do 
it -- not that it's so safe it's boring, but after several hundred jumps some 
of the skydivers look for greater challenges. 
</P>
<P>
The 40 in the DC-3 this day are trying out for the 110-way team that will try 
to set a state record at Perris Valley Dec. 7-9. They must link up for three 
seconds to make it official. 
</P>
<P>
They'll start to break up at 4,500 feet, and "we want to be open by 2,000 
feet," says Mark Pharr, who with Cooper and instructor Jeff Jones is organizing 
the attempt. "That allows us time (11 1/2 seconds) to use the reserve parachute 
if we need to." 
</P>
<P>
Linking up the formation, or "blot," involves six phases -- exit, dive, track, 
flare (slow), lurk (wait) and dock -- during which each diver must find his 
assigned slot. A skilled diver can vary his speed from 60 to 200 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
A photographer and reporter go along for the ride to 12,500 feet -- and the 
ride back down in the DC-3. 
</P>
<P>
"They've told me if I keep you guys from falling out of the airplane I'll get a 
free jump," Domenico says. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the non-jumpers are required to wear chutes, and Pharr offers 
some brief instruction. 
</P>
<P>
The most important thing he says is: "If the pilot goes out, you follow him." 
</P>
<P>
After a 25-minute climb, the DC-3 levels off. Cooper announces "jump run" and 
holds up three fingers -- meaning, three minutes. At "one minute," three 
"floaters" step out the door and hang onto a handhold. They'll let go when the 
first divers exit, the purpose being to get everybody free-falling as close 
together as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The divers inside are standing in a tightly bunched conga line, and at the 
commands "ready . . . set . . . go!" they charge out the door in lock step, 
like a centipede. They're all gone in 10 seconds, leaving the plane's 
passengers to study the skydiving slogans on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "If at first you don't succeed. . ."

<P>
SAFETY OF TRACK IS QUESTIONED AFTER MANY BREAKDOWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sunday morning, before the Yellow Ribbon Invitational at Santa Anita, Neil 
Papiano, one of the owners of Baldomero, was advised by a high-profile 
California breeder not to run the 5-year-old mare. 
</P>
<P>
"He thought there were problems with the track," said Papiano, who declined to 
identify the breeder. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Bill Shoemaker ran Baldomero in the $400,000 stake, and it was the last 
race of her life. On the clubhouse turn, the Irish-bred's left foreleg snapped. 
Jockey Eddie Delahoussaye pulled her up, and minutes later, with the leg 
hopelessly shattered, a veterinarian gave Baldomero a lethal injection. 
</P>
<P>
Baldomero, who at Del Mar had given Shoemaker his first stakes victory as a 
trainer, was insured for $300,000, but her owners would gladly give up the 
money if they could have her back to run again. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't go out there (when Baldomero was injured)," said Ted Goldberg, one 
of Papiano's partners in ownership of the horse. "Both sesamoids were gone, and 
the cannon bone was showing through the skin. It must have been horrible." 
</P>
<P>
There were so many breakdowns during the Oak Tree meeting at Santa Anita that 
about halfway through the 27-day season, which ended Monday, several owners 
asked their trainers to use caution in running their horses. 
</P>
<P>
Reluctant Guest, an Eclipse Award candidate, also suffered a leg injury in the 
Yellow Ribbon and probably won't race again until next spring. In Monday's 
Burke Handicap, Great Communicator, winner of the Breeders' Cup Turf Stakes in 
1988, was destroyed after breaking down. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Charlie Whittingham twice scratched horses from grass races during the 
final Oak Tree weekend, not running She's a V.P. in the California Cup Distaff 
and keeping Live The Dream out of the Burke. Live The Dream is being saved for 
the fall season at Hollywood Park, where he has shown a preference for the 
turf. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham, who was at the Breeders' Cup at Belmont Park Oct. 27 when Go For 
Wand and two other stakes horses had to be destroyed, said racing has had 
enough negative publicity lately and preferred not to comment about the 
problems at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Exact figures on the number of breakdowns during morning training hours and 
afternoon racing at the meeting were not available Tuesday. On one Sunday, 
however, three horses broke down in races on the main track and had to be 
destroyed, and in the Volante Handicap on grass the same day, Mehmetori 
suffered a tendon injury that might end his career. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a day," said Ray Baran, who was the track veterinarian for the Oak 
Tree meeting. "Besides those four, we wound up putting more horses on the vets' 
list (making them ineligible to run because of soreness) than on any day I can 
ever remember." 
</P>
<P>
Cliff Goodrich, president of Santa Anita, was out of town Tuesday and could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"We've run a lot of races over this track, but I think it's in fine condition," 
said Ray Rogers, executive vice president of the Oak Tree Racing Assn. "We've 
taken every possible precaution to make the track safe. We tested both surfaces 
for resilience every day of the meeting." 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Santa Anita spent about $3 million to rebuild its oft-maligned 
grass course. Included was the installation of a mesh material called Netlon, 
which was designed to reduce the number of divots. Before this year's Oak Tree 
season, Santa Anita spent another $1.8 million to rebuild the hillside section 
of the grass course. 
</P>
<P>
Track and world records immediately started falling. Even lesser horses seem 
capable of running exceptional times. On Oct. 13, in an allowance race, 
Shirkee, a 5-year-old Shoemaker-trained gelding, ran the approximately 6 1/2 
furlongs down the hill in 1:11 4/5, equaling a record that was set 20 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Is the course so fast that it imperils safety? 
</P>
<P>
"What Santa Anita has done with its turf course was very creative, but it was 
not the thing to do," said one owner who declined to be identified. "The grass 
is in horrible condition. It's harder than the main track. It's like concrete." 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Doug Peterson was surprised by the appearance of the Santa Anita grass 
course. "It's showing wear and tear," he said. "And this is after a meeting 
that hasn't been that long." 
</P>
<P>
Race tracks have always been easy targets for criticism. Belmont Park is under 
fire, not necessarily because of Go For Wand's breakdown in the Breeders' Cup, 
but because of all the other injuries there this season. 
</P>
<P>
When the Breeders' Cup was held at Gulfstream Park in 1989, some trainers, 
dissatisfied with the inconsistency of the main track's surface, shipped their 
horses to nearby Hialeah for prerace workouts. 
</P>
<P>
The deaths of Go For Wand, Great Communicator and others have provided a sorry 
climax to a year in which Sunday Silence, the horse of the year; Easy Goer, and 
Criminal Type were retired because of leg problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's the tracks, I think it's year-round racing," said Charlie 
Rose, assistant trainer of Plenty of Grace, the 56-1 upset winner of the Yellow 
Ribbon. "It used to be that a trainer had the time to turn out horses for two 
or three months before bringing them back. Horses might not run as many races 
as they used to, but they're sure in training a lot longer. Now a rest for a 
horse amounts to what we call 'light training,' which still isn't as beneficial 
as turning a horse out."

BAFFERT ONE WHO ENJOYS HIS WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SCHUELEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trainer Bob Baffert often says funny things, and always says things funny. 
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old conditioner with the prematurely gray hair, ever-present 
sunglasses and disarming country drawl keeps his stable in stitches with a 
steady flow of hyperbole. 
</P>
<P>
A blend of Will Rogers, Tim Conway and Steve Martin, Baffert looks as though he 
would be as comfortable spinning yarns from a porch in the hinterland as from 
the back of a stable pony. 
</P>
<P>
The Arizona native has 35 quarter horses with assistant Laura Meier at Los 
Alamitos and 15 thoroughbred stabled with assistant Haitham Yakteen at Santa 
Anita. 
</P>
<P>
"He's serious about business," said Yakteen, an associate for four years. "But 
his philosophy is, if you're not having fun at what you're doing, you shouldn't 
be doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Baffert grew up on a chicken and cattle ranch in Nogales, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a quarter horse mare named Baffert's Gypsy," recalled Baffert. "I 
galloped her before school and rubbed her legs three hours each night. She won 
15 races and earned something like $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a friend who knew a trainer who was struggling at a bush track in New 
Mexico. He asked him why he didn't quit and do something different. The guy 
looked at him and said, 'What? And get out of show business? No way!' 
</P>
<P>
"Once it gets in your system, it's hard to get out. I'm not a gambler, but I 
love the action. I love winning and I love having a good horse." 
</P>
<P>
Baffert began training at Sonoita and Rillito in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad that Rillito closed, but it was the best thing to happen to me 
because it forced me to come to Los Alamitos, which I had been reluctant to 
try, in 1983," Baffert said. 
</P>
<P>
He has been one of the track's leaders since and branched into thoroughbreds 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a lot of good horses, but three stand out," he said. "Kelly's Coffer, 
Gold Coast Express and Thirty Slews. 
</P>
<P>
"Kelly's Coffer was the first good horse I had in Arizona. She won, like, 30 
races and $260,000." 
</P>
<P>
Gold Coast Express became Baffert's most important horse, earning World 
Champion honors in 1986 as a 3-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
"When Bill Mitchell turned him over to me, it was like hitting the lottery," 
Baffert said. "I was so nervous the first time I ran him I nearly threw Danny 
Cardoza, his jockey, over the horse when I gave him a leg up in the paddock. 
</P>
<P>
"Gold Coast Express taught me a lot about training. With a good horse, no 
matter what you do to him, he will still win. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest thrill in racing was when he won the Champion of Champions to 
become World Champion. Cash Rate looked unbeatable, and he upset him." 
</P>
<P>
Gold Coast Express, a 7-year-old palomino gelding, now serves as Baffert's pony 
at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
"I can say I have the fastest horse on the grounds," Baffert said. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take a court order to get him back. I just love that horse. He'll lead 
the post parade for the Breeders Championship races Nov. 17 at Los Alamitos." 
</P>
<P>
Baffert bought Thirty Slews, a 3-year-old thoroughbred gelding, at a Kentucky 
yearling sale. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd never been to Keeneland but something about him caught my eye," the 
trainer said. "I didn't know anything about breeding, but he looked like a big 
perfect quarter horse." 
</P>
<P>
Baffert spent $30,000 for the Slewpy colt, a grandson of Seattle Slew. 
</P>
<P>
After two impressive sprint victories last winter at Santa Anita, Baffert took 
Thirty Slews to Keeneland for the Lexington Stakes at 1 1/16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
"I got Derby fever," Baffert admitted. "I stretched him too early and 
overtrained him and he still ran third." 
</P>
<P>
Thirty Slews, sidelined several months with bruised feet, is scheduled to 
return Nov. 24 at Hollywood Park in the Underwood Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to run him in the Breeders' Cup Sprint at Churchill Downs next year," 
Baffert said. "I just want to race him lightly for big money until then." 
</P>
<P>
Baffert has enjoyed stakes success with thoroughbreds Frosty Freeze, Broadways 
Top Gun and unbeaten Theresa's Pleasure, who won the $100,000 California Cup 
Juvenile Fillies race Saturday at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Baffert wore a suit in the winner's circle, looking as misplaced as Pavarotti 
at the Grand Ole Opry. 
</P>
<P>
"I got her from Lester Smith, an old quarter horse owner," Baffert said of 
Theresa's Pleasure. "He's 87, and his caretaker, Theresa Silva, had to do a 
'Mrs. Genter,' explaining the race to him. 
</P>
<P>
"Theresa's Pleasure stands only 14 hands high and looks like a quarter horse. 
She has a strong body, though, like that gymnast, Mary Lou Retton. Watching her 
run is like watching Mary Lou Retton run a mile. 
</P>
<P>
"I brought Gold Coast Express up to the Champion of Champions off a two-month 
layoff and did the same with her. Still, I didn't know if she could get a mile 
and a sixteenth. I asked the stewards if they would let me pack an oxygen tank 
on her back for the last eighth." 
</P>
<P>
Baffert's quarter horse contingent is headed by 3-year-old gelding 
Ourautograph, winner of a division of the recent Garden Grove Handicap, and 
Miss Striking Jet, Dash For Time, Star In His Crown and Merriette. 
</P>
<P>
Baffert is developing a thoroughbred division to increase the stable's income. 
He has won 60 quarter horse races this year for purses of $500,000 and 20 
thoroughbred races for $650,000. 
</P>
<P>
Baffert learns quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"I was stabled next to Ron McAnally at Del Mar and that was really educational 
for me," he said. "He didn't know it, but I was really watching him closely, 
and he's really sharp. I pick up on everything." 
</P>
<P>
Including the best show biz delivery this side of the Pecos.

Trainer Blane Schvaneveldt plans to saddle Wicked Wind, Dash For Speed and 
Wicked Dash in the $125,000 Breeders Championship Classic Nov. 17. Phillips 
Ranch's Wicked Wind, ridden by Luke Myles, scored a three-quarter-length upset 
in the $25,000-added Charger Bar Handicap at 350 yards Saturday. Dash for 
Speed, the 3-10 favorite, finished fifth. The 5-year-old mare carried high 
weight of 127 pounds in her first start since July. 
</P>
<P>
"She had been training better than ever but you go stacking weight on them, and 
they can get beat," said Schvaneveldt of Dash for Speed, a two-time champion. 
"And that other filly can run." Wicked Wind carried 120. All will carry 122 in 
the Breeders Championship Classic. Wicked Dash, 5, and Wicked Wind, 4, are full 
sisters. A third full sister, 3-year-old Wicked Willa, won the Phoenix Derby 
Saturday afternoon for Schvaneveldt with jockey Roman Figueroa. 
</P>
<P>
Schvaneveldt has added an impressive 2-year-old to his stable in Easy Martini, 
who won the $22,250-Grade III Cypress Handicap Thursday by half a length over 
Kipadeucy in his California debut. "I've had him about six weeks," Schvaneveldt 
said. "He had been running in Oregon and Washington and looks like an awful 
nice horse." Easy Martini scored his ninth victory in 10 starts. 
</P>
<P>
The Dream Doctor heads a list of 10 qualifiers for the $46,729 California Sires 
Cup Derby Saturday. The Dream Doctor recorded the fastest qualifying time of 
20:01 for the 400 yards last Wednesday. Also qualifying are Here Comes The 
Band, Casady Cash, Dr. Keen, Requestmesomecash, Nets Cat, His Legacy, Lantys 
Pennant, Zooks Shestheone and Natural Summit.

Hollywood Park's fall meeting, which includes five major races during its 
37-day run, opens today with the $60,000 Allez France Handicap at 1 1/16 miles 
on grass. 
</P>
<P>
With a Wednesday-through-Sunday schedule, plus Monday racing on Veteran's Day, 
Nov. 12, and closing day, Dec. 24, Hollywood will have a first post of 1 p.m., 
with the exception of 11 a.m. on Thanksgiving, Nov. 22, and 12:30 p.m. on Dec. 
24. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Santos, the New York jockey who plans to stay in California through the 
Santa Anita winter season, has landed the mount on Daughter of Wolf, a longshot 
in the Allez France. Santos, the national money champion for four straight 
years, trails Gary Stevens by about $500,000 in the standings this year. 
Stevens is riding Invitation Waltz, an English filly making her American debut, 
in the Allez France. BILL CHRISTINE

SHOWING OFF ECOLOGICAL AWARENESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Consumers searching for environmentally safe products that are not tested on 
animals have a major complaint -- such products are hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
To address that problem, Last Chance for Animals, a nonprofit activist group, 
and the Animals' Voice magazine are co-sponsoring a consumer trade show Sunday. 
The show will feature 85 booths offering personal-care and household products 
that are "cruelty-free," not composed of animal byproducts and are safe for the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's becoming chic to be cruelty-free, but many of the products are not 
readily available," said Bill Dyer of the Tarzana-based Last Chance for 
Animals. "You can find them, but you have to drive all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
The show, entitled Living and Giving Cruelty-Free Holiday Faire, will be held 
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m at the Biltmore hotel downtown. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the product exhibits, there will be booths featuring vegetarian 
food, cosmetic make-overs, clothing and accessories, raffle prizes and a 
celebrity fashion show that includes a recycled-paper wedding dress. Tickets 
are $7 in advance; $9 at the door. Proceeds will go to animal rights groups and 
issues concerning animals. 
</P>
<P>
Show organizers Jack and Dina Carone came up with the idea for a humane 
products show two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
He is director of special projects and marketing for the Animals' Voice 
magazine and co-director of Last Chance for Animals. Dina is a makeup artist 
for the movie and television industry. 
</P>
<P>
Their first show was held at an Encino restaurant, Lalo and Brothers, and had 
just 10 booths. The second, held in May at the Roosevelt hotel, had 34 booths 
and attracted about 4,000 consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"The response was overwhelming. It really surprised us," said Dina Carone, the 
show's producer. "It's definitely an idea whose time has come. That's why we 
decided to do another one so soon." 
</P>
<P>
The show is run by volunteers, she said. "No one is paid, and all the money we 
make goes to help animal issues and human health-related issues." 
</P>
<P>
Exhibitors are asked to sign a statement certifying that their products are not 
tested on animals and contain no animal ingredients, including lanolin, 
collagen or other animal proteins. "Most of the products have recyclable 
bottles, too," Dina Carone said. "People are really becoming aware of all of 
these things." Among the products that will be on exhibit and for sale are 
cruelty-free cosmetics, hair and skin care products, reusable unbleached muslin 
coffee filters, energy-saving light bulbs, non-chlorine bleach, environmentally 
safe dish detergent, cedar pet shampoo, fruit wash, nontoxic weed killer, 
chemically free flea repellent for the carpet, all-natural household cleaning 
products, natural linoleum and recycled paper for fax, adding machines and 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
Evil, a new cruelty-free perfume being marketed by campy television personality 
Elvira, will be featured at the show. 
</P>
<P>
Companies to be represented include Paul Mitchell Systems, Clientele, Aveda, 
Joe Blasco, Earth-Rite, Jerrick Earth Kind Products, Avanza Nature Cosmetics, 
Oxyfresh-Mills, Earth Science, BWC (Beauty Without Cruelty), Paul Penders, and 
Environmental Network. 
</P>
<P>
Richard, a 1-year-old white rabbit that belongs to Animals' Voice operations 
manager Connie Cwynar and is the mascot of the magazine's staff, will make an 
appearance at the show, Jack Carone said, "as the symbol of all the rabbits 
that won't have to go through testing in the future. It's easy to lose sight of 
individual animals when you think of the tens of millions that have suffered 
and died because of testing. Sometimes you have to look back at the individual 
animal. 
</P>
<P>
"People are aware now of these products because of the few people who have been 
making a lot of noise about testing for a lot of years," he continued. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know one person who would use a shampoo used to blind rabbits. If they 
knew, people wouldn't do that. But they didn't know. . . . But issues having to 
do with other species are a concern now. Most people are decent when they know 
the facts." 
</P>
<P>
The Carones hope to expand the show to other cities and teach other 
organizations how to organize such events. 
</P>
<P>
"My big dream is to go on a grander scale, maybe have a show in Las Vegas, and 
I'd be willing to educate other people in how to do it," she said. "I'd also 
like to do a telethon to raise money for spaying and neutering (clinics) all 
over the country." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't necessarily want to be in the trade show business," said Jack Carone. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually there won't be any need for shows like this. We've made tremendous 
strides in getting moratoriums on testing. Soon no one is going to test on 
animals anymore. But I hope people will support those small companies who 
became cruelty-free before it was popular. I hope people will reward them with 
continued loyalty."

TORTURED LEGACY OF HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS; 
</P>
<P>
IN THE SHADOW OF THE HOLOCAUST; THE SECOND GENERATION BY AARON HASS CORNELL 
UNIVERSITY PRESS $19.95, 178 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JONATHAN KIRSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
"He who has been tortured," Jean Amery observed, "remains tortured." 
</P>
<P>
The epigraph, which appears at the outset of "In the Shadow of the Holocaust," 
is an eloquent summing up of the fate of the men and women who, by accident or 
miracle or act of heroism, managed to survive Auschwitz or Babi Yar or the 
Warsaw Ghetto. But what is the fate of the children of survivors, the young men 
and women who call themselves the "Second Generation?" 
</P>
<P>
What we learn in Aaron Hass' "In the Shadow of the Holocaust" is that the 
survivors of the Holocaust were so deeply scarred by their ordeal that their 
own children, too, remain tortured -- in more than a metaphorical sense. 
</P>
<P>
Hass, a psychology professor at Cal State Dominguez Hills and a clinical staff 
member of the UCLA department of psychiatry, styles "In the Shadow of the 
Holocaust" as a psychological study of survivors and their children. But his 
most important credentials, I think, are more intimate: Hass is a child of 
survivors, a speaker of Yiddish, and an heir to the awful legacy of the 
Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
"Events that occurred 50 years ago, before my birth, follow me," Hass writes. 
"Growing up meant being constrained, often paralyzed, by hearing, 'How could 
you do this to me after all I have suffered?' " When asked where he was from by 
someone from the old country, the American-born Hass would respond that he was 
from his parents' hometown. 
</P>
<P>
Hass the psychologist devotes much attention to the technical demands of 
designing a sound psychological study and reaching defensible conclusions about 
his subjects. But it is Hass the storyteller who penetrates the real mysteries 
of the tortured body and soul and allows us to understand the strange and 
terrible burdens the second generation has been forced to bear from earliest 
childhood. 
</P>
<P>
"For survivors, their children were symbols of birth and restoration," he 
observes. "These parents may have harbored unconscious magical expections that 
their offspring would undo the destruction of the Holocaust and replace lost 
family members, provide meaning for their empty life, and vindicate their 
suffering." 
</P>
<P>
Hass allows us to see that the horror of the Holocaust was transmitted to the 
second generation in strange and sometimes contradictory ways. Many children of 
survivors were overprotected by parents who knew that the world was a 
demonstrably cruel and dangerous place; the bogymen of their childhoods wore SS 
uniforms, too. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, parents sometimes nurtured children with a strange fury: "I 
remember having eggs rammed down my throat and vomiting them up, and then 
having more shoved down again," one woman recalls. Another remembers: "My 
brother once dropped a basket of eggs, and my father started chasing him with 
an ax." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Hass suggests, the legacy of the Holocaust for the children of 
survivors is two-edged: guilt and anger co-exist in their hearts. "The 
experience of being a child of survivors," Hass writes, "is reflected by three 
words uttered by almost every such person with whom I came into contact: fear, 
mistrust, cynicism." 
</P>
<P>
At times, the most articulate and moving witness is Hass himself, at least when 
he discards the white coat of the social scientist and bares his own soul in 
confessional prose that is anguished but somehow lyrical. "The idea of God is 
not a comfort to me," he confesses, "but a taunt." And he invites us to ponder 
the impact on a 9-year-old boy of hearing a father recount his wartime exploits 
as a partisan in a darkened apartment on the solemn fast-day of Yom Kippur: 
</P>
<P>
"We found out that a German officer would be at the farmhouse of a Pole who had 
betrayed Jews to him," his father would recite in Yiddish every year. "We tied 
them up and cut a small hole in each one's arm. For hours we put salt in the 
open wound. Then we shot both of them." 
</P>
<P>
I was still reading "In the Shadow of the Holocaust" when The Times published 
an obituary of David McCalden, a benighted man who dedicated himself to arguing 
that the Holocaust never happened. It occurred to me that McCalden may be dead 
and gone, but the lies that he told are still being repeated. And I was 
reminded of the real burden of the Second Generation -- a burden that Hass 
himself does not overlook. 
</P>
<P>
"Most children of survivors were admonished 'to remember,' " he writes. "But 
what must the second generation not forget? Six million is not an impressive 
number. It is abstract and it numbs rather than sensitizes. One person's story 
has the potential for illumination." 
</P>

Ruth Sidransky (St. Martin's Press).

SCREEN STYLE: HIGH-TECH FLASH-FORWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE SHOW: "The Flash"(CBS) Thursday 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
THE SET-UP: Police scientist Barry Allen (John Wesley Shipp, pictured) fights 
evil in mythical Central City in this stylishly noir series that looks 
something like "Batman," the feature film released last year. Amanda Pays plays 
Tina McGee, our hero's budding love interest and a pushy research scientist who 
helps him discover his superhuman power. Pays is on familiar high-tech ground 
here, having played baby sitter for mutant male Max Headroom. 
</P>
<P>
THE LOOK: The coolest article of clothing in the show is Shipp's heroic body 
suit, an eye-catching brick-red number complete with muscle-enhancing black 
shadows air brushed onto the pecs. There are four Flash suits, custom molded to 
Shipp's body at $25,000 apiece. Designer Robert Short, an Oscar-winning special 
effects/makeup artist, says the latex suits were specially treated to play down 
their rubber surface so they would look like basic stretch unitards. And, he 
says, they're hot inside. Shipp gets around that problem by wearing an 
undergarment that is water cooled, like one developed for race car drivers. 
This keeps him from swimming in sweat. Pays may be an aggressive career woman, 
but she wears decidedly unaggressive clothing, especially retro '30s and '40s 
long tapered skirts, pleated slacks and vests. Bob Miller, costumer in charge 
of the show's everyday outfits, mixes modern with vintage styles from Warner 
Bros. wardrobe department. 
</P>
<P>
THE LABELS: A galaxy of designers, from Californian Tina Hagen to Giorgio 
Armani and Ralph Lauren are mixed and matched. 
</P>
<P>
THE STORES: Along with stock from Warner Bros. costume department, and a rental 
shop, the Costume Rental Collection, available only for the trade, Miller shops 
the California Mart and finds suits for male characters at Neiman Marcus (the 
Byblos label) and the Shoe and Clothing Connection in Encino (WilliWear). SUE

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: 'BORROWED LAND': POVERTY IN PHILIPPINES

Matthew Westfall's cool, incisive 51-minute video documentary "On Borrowed 
Land," which screens tonight and Friday at 6:30 and 8:30 at Philippine 
Expressions, 8685 Wilshire Blvd., adds further testimony to the stultifying 
poverty that lies beneath what narrator Willem Dafoe calls a "thin veneer of 
democracy" in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the unfulfilled promises of the Aquino government, Manila's poor 
immigrants from the provinces remain squatters, with more than 50,000 living in 
"Reclamation," a well-organized largely self-sustaining community built on 
dredged lands alongside Manila Bay but now the target of overseas developers 
who envision Manila as the next Hong Kong after 1997. 
</P>
<P>
Westfall and his cameraman David Weisman calmly record hypocrisy and 
indifference on the part of the Establishment, yet they end on a note of hope, 
affirming their belief that the people who fueled the overthrow of Marcos will 
ultimately prevail. 
</P>
<P>
"On Borrowed Time" on which Oliver Stone served as executive producer, screens 
again on Wednesday, Nov. 14 at 7:30 p.m. at USC's Annenberg Auditorium. 
Westfall and Weisman will be present at all screenings, which will benefit the 
Tulong-Sikap Foundation, a Manila-based urban poor advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
Information: (213) 652-8869 or 559-9529; For the USC screening: (213) 737-1804 
as well as 559-9529. 
</P>
<P>
The recently restored 1937 film version of "The Dybbuk" screens Thursday 
through Nov. 20 at the Monica 4-Plex. As a record of Polish-Jewish culture, so 
soon to be all but eradicated in the Holocaust, this film of the S. Ansky play 
is invaluable and rich in ancient folklore and religious ritual, but it's tough 
going. The actors perform as if they were onstage instead of on camera.

DENIED BY THE NEA, ENTER THE LATC; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: THE CENTER GIVES $5,000 COMMISSIONS TO PERFORMANCE ARTISTS JOHN FLECK 
AND TIM MILLER, WHOSE APPLICATIONS TO THE NEA WERE TURNED DOWN. 
</P>

<P>
Los Angeles Theatre Center has ventured where the National Endowment for the 
Arts wouldn't go. 
</P>
<P>
LATC has commissioned new works from John Fleck and Tim Miller, two of the four 
solo performance artists whose applications for NEA fellowship grants were 
rejected in a controversial decision by NEA chairman John E. Frohnmayer in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose is to replace the endowment funding we feel they should have had," 
said LATC artistic director Bill Bushnell on Tuesday, at a press conference 
attended by Fleck and Miller. The LATC leadership was "distressed" by 
Frohnmayer's action, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based artists will receive $5,000 each for the creation of 
hourlong works. The results may be presented as companion pieces at LATC next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer's decision to overturn the recommendations of an NEA panel to award 
grants to Fleck, Miller, Holly Hughes and Karen Finley raised a storm of 
criticism that the chairman was acting out of political reasons rather than 
artistic ones. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt it was important to stand up and state very clearly that the kind of 
overheated rhetoric from the reactionary right could not be allowed to 
intimidate an institution that has made its reputation from being a leader," 
Bushnell said. 
</P>
<P>
The money "will come from places like the Shubert Foundation's $40,000 grant 
(to LATC) for the creation of new work and from other unrestricted funds" that 
have been given to the theater for new plays, workshops and festivals. The work 
might be seen as early as next March, during the theater's annual Festival of 
Premieres, but as with any LATC-commissioned work, Bushnell added, there is no 
guarantee that the work will ever be presented on the LATC main stages. 
</P>
<P>
City money that pays for the maintenance of LATC facilities will not be used to 
support these commissions, nor will any money from the LATC's own recently 
announced $65,000 grant from the NEA, Bushnell said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that a question about the NEA money was "premature" because LATC has 
not announced whether it will accept the grant. He indicated that chances for a 
grant rejection, similar to the one announced last week by the New York 
Shakespeare Festival, were slim, but the final decision will not be announced 
until later this week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why the other two Frohnmayer-rejected artists, Hughes and Finley, were 
not also awarded grants, Bushnell said it was because they are not Los 
Angeles-based, as are Fleck and Miller. "That's Joe Papp's responsibility, or 
Harvey Lichtenstein's," he said, referring to the leaders of the New York 
Shakespeare Festival and the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York, the home 
town of Finley and Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
Bushnell also "talked with" Rachel Rosenthal, a Los Angeles-based performer who 
rejected her own $11,250 NEA grant in protest against the denials of grants to 
the NEA Four. Why not also reward her? 
</P>
<P>
"First, she made a choice," he replied. "I applaud that act, but it's a 
different philosophical act on my part as to whether I should replace (the 
money she turned down)." Also, he added, Rosenthal wanted "substantially more 
than $5,000," and her request "was too rich for our blood." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal was traveling Tuesday and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the LATC commission "is the most practical and helpful thing that 
has happened" since Frohnmayer's decision. He said artists are now trying "to 
find ways to re-authorize not the NEA but their own internal missions." But he 
is also interested "in seeing people get the dough and stick it in people's 
faces." 
</P>
<P>
Miller's new piece "begins with me being thrown hundreds of feet in the air 
after crashing into a Thai food delivery van on my scooter, where I hover over 
Los Angeles regarding this strange basin and share visions of a scary future, a 
handspring by the sea and political transformations through homo/sex," said the 
artist in an LATC statement. 
</P>
<P>
"All four of us went through this period of being called anti-American," Fleck 
noted. He said that he hopes "to get in touch with my concern with American 
values" in his new piece. "Using Mark Twain's river in 'Huck Finn' as the core, 
I will detail my current personal midlife crisis and that of American society 
as the new millennium approaches."

NEW YORK ENSEMBLE AT MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD S. GINELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Without a doubt, the New York New Music Ensemble is a gem of a group. These 
musicians are alert, technically scrupulous, thoroughly prepared to the teeth 
-- and, most notably for a new-music group, passionately expressive no matter 
how difficult or abstract the score. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the hard part: finding something worthwhile to play. On that count, 
only one of the four pieces heard at the group's appearance Monday night in the 
Leo S. Bing Theater of the County Museum of Art -- part of the Monday Evening 
Concerts series -- had anything resembling coherence or emotional power. 
Luckily, it took up about half of the program. 
</P>
<P>
The piece in question is Sir Peter Maxwell Davies' "Ave Maris Stella," a 
mesmerizing, 27-minute, one-movement sextet that finds the composer again 
transforming the seascape beneath his home in the Orkney Islands into sound. 
</P>
<P>
While all players take turns evoking the choppy seas in fragmented bursts, the 
textures change noticeably, and each section of the work is clearly defined. 
Inevitably, everything becomes magically still, with the alto flute simulating 
a distant foghorn. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Black sensitively led a sextet that included ensemble members Daniel 
Druckman (marimba), Christopher Finckel (cello), Jean Kopperud (clarinet), Jayn 
Rosenfeld (alto flute) and guests Cyrus Stevens (violin) and James Winn 
(piano). 
</P>
<P>
Particularly impressive was Finckel's warm, lyrical solo at the beginning of 
"Ave Maris Stella" and the group's amazingly hushed, delicate playing at a 
pianissimo volume level toward the close. 
</P>
<P>
Poul Ruders' "Vox in Rama" for clarinet, piano and amplified violin tries to 
travel the same route from agitation to calm in one-third the time -- and the 
opening does have an appealing, quirky sense of syncopated violence. Yet where 
Maxwell Davies succeeds in imposing form and order over potential chaos, Ruders 
merely allows the momentum to drift away and the music just hangs there, 
waiting for a denouement that never arrives. 
</P>
<P>
The program opened with MEC director Dorrance Stalvey's 
"Exordium/Genesis/Dawn," a shapeless canvas of brittle staccatos for the full 
sextet, relieved somewhat by a few lyrical interludes. Bun-Ching Lam's arid 
"Another Spring" for piano, alto flute and cello also rambles aimlessly from 
episode to episode, busywork without point. For what it's worth, both pieces, 
as well as the Ruders, were receiving their local premieres.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: THE FAMILY THAT WATCHES TOGETHER . . . ; 
</P>
<P>
FILM: BARRY LEVINSON'S 'AVALON' SHOWS THE SAD CONSEQUENCES OF THE KRICHINSKYS' 
ADDICTION TO TV. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
He sank into the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how Jerzy Kosinski describes the protagonist in "Being There," his 
novel about the darkly humorous rise in stature of a dull-witted, illiterate 
man named Chance who spends half his time gardening, the other half watching 
television. 
</P>
<P>
Less a couch potato than a couch sponge, Chance absorbs everything on the 
screen, becoming whatever is before him, changing himself by changing channels. 
His brain contains no thoughts, only impressions. For Chance: 
</P>
<P>
"The set created its own light, its own color, its own time. It did not follow 
the law of gravity that forever bent all plants downward. Everything on TV was 
tangled and mixed and yet smoothed out: night and day, big and small, tough and 
brittle, soft and rough, hot and cold, far and near." 
</P>
<P>
Chance is not us, not quite yet. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is something ominously familiar about him, for as we enter the 
'90s, we can honestly say that just about all of America is sinking into the 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
The A.C. Nielsen Co. estimates that Americans average four hours daily -- 
perhaps two-thirds of their leisure time, not counting weekends -- in front of 
the TV set. And with the coming global expansion of cable, the rest of the 
world may soon follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
Just what this means we may not know until it's too late to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
But there are some dark implications in "Avalon," Barry Levinson's 
just-released semi-autobiographical movie about his family and upbringing in 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
This is not his first movie to touch on TV. There are comic references to TV in 
both "Diner" and "Tin Men," each in a small way suggesting the intimacy of the 
medium and the way it weaves itself through our lives, becoming our common 
folkore. And the severely autistic Raymond in "Rain Man" simply cannot get 
through a day without watching "People's Court," indicating that TV can be 
experienced without really being experienced. 
</P>
<P>
For a grimmer view, however, try "Avalon." It's not only an intriguing story 
about the dissolution of a family, but an instructive one for those Americans 
-- now the majority -- whose entire lives are spanned by TV. Just how much has 
TV changed our lives? 
</P>
<P>
Levinson provides a before and after. 
</P>
<P>
Although the movie's cultural and generational conflicts flow from the 1914 
arrival in America of a character based on Levinson's Russian-immigrant 
grandfather, "Avalon" takes place mostly in the 1950s, evolving simultaneously 
with the evolution of TV. Although this heartfelt homage to Levinson's 
childhood is hardly about TV, he uses TV as a roadmap and makes it responsible, 
along with suburbia, for breaking up this eclectic clan of Krichinskys. 
</P>
<P>
At first the references are humorous. 
</P>
<P>
There is that day all families of the era recall: The first TV set is purchased 
and positioned against a living room wall where it can be revered. The occasion 
of The First Set is so epic for the Krichinskys that the entire extended family 
squeezes together in front of the brown console and stares vacantly at a 
black-and-white test pattern, as if waiting for a curtain to rise. 
</P>
<P>
Thereafter, the flickering pictures and sounds from TV -- from Howdy Doody to 
"Studio One" to ancient movie cartoons shifted to the small screen -- become 
the family's constant background buzz. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately moving to the foreground. 
</P>
<P>
At one point a squabble ends abruptly when everyone flies to the set upon 
hearing the familiar opening for Milton Berle's "Texaco Star Theatre": "Oh, 
we're the men of Texaco, we work from Maine to Mexico. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
TV now looms larger and larger. 
</P>
<P>
The Krichinsky family that ate together had always talked together. These 
weren't profound discussions about literature, politics or the great issues of 
the day. But at the very least this circle of chattering and bickering was a 
way of communicating, what the grandfather terms "dinner talk." 
</P>
<P>
However, "dinner talk" vanishes as the years go by, and later we see the family 
silently taking their meals on TV tables, glazed eyes fixed on the screen, 
chattering and bickering now coming only from the set. 
</P>
<P>
An especially devastating metaphor comes still later, when someone is seated in 
a darkened room, seemingly unaware that off to the side a TV set is turned on 
and that the picture is mostly static. More of the constant buzz. 
</P>
<P>
The grandfather in "Avalon" is an oral historian, mesmerizing children with 
stories of earlier times, of coming to America on the Fourth of July and being 
dazzled by the fireworks, of meeting his wife and making his way in Baltimore 
with his brothers in the paperhanging business, of living in the old 
neighborhood, of trying to assimilate into a culture he never fully 
understands. 
</P>
<P>
One generation learning from another. But in an age when TV fractures the 
attention spans of its viewers, few children have the time or patience for such 
stories of family history. Now it's TV that mesmerizes them.

TOUGHNESS NEEDED IN SEAL TRAINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is in response to Jennifer Crane Hahn in "Letters in View" concerning SEAL 
training. 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Hahn likens SEAL training to "an insane extension of the prevailing 
mentality in high school and college sports." 
</P>
<P>
The military's job is to train men for combat and not for sports. 
</P>
<P>
Sure the training is "brutal" and even "abusive," but as the article pointed 
out, the combat missions are 10 times worse than the training. Gen. William 
Sherman said that "war is ALL hell," so I would say that training best reflect 
the real world. 
</P>
<P>
As long as war is used as an extension of foreign policy, it is criminal not to 
provide the most effective training for our soldiers, sailors and Marines. 
Better to shed some tears now (and perhaps offend Ms. Hahn's tender feelings) 
than to spill blood needlessly later because of poor training. Jennifer Crane 
Hahn and her ilk are living in fantasy land.

WRITING CAN BE DANGEROUS. . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your column "Maiming the Message Is Only Half the Danger" (View, Sept. 19) 
might be subtitled "Cliches, Ill-Thought-Out Assertions, and Timid Fears by a 
Cowardly Writer." 
</P>
<P>
The whole article is a mass of mush about the alleged ruination of civilized 
writing caused by word processors. If you were still teaching English you could 
send one of your Freshman Comp kids to do a library search on the topic and, 
assuming the kid could do research, you would be presented with a list of more 
than 250 similar articles, an average of about one per week for the past five 
years, on the same subject, and all like yours, sans substance and full of 
vague, dumb fears. 
</P>
<P>
It does no good to point to that English professor's conclusions about whether 
using a computer or a typewriter produced better composition. Her test was 
flawed from the beginning because she failed to include a third group of 
writers: Those who write by hand. By logic, by nature, and by sheer mass of the 
evidence, the direct link between brain, arm, hand and fingers onto paper 
produces the best prose and thought. From Plato and Aristotle to St. Augustine, 
St. Thomas, Shakespeare, Hobbes, Locke, Goethe, Jane Austen, Dostoevski, 
Neitzsche, and on and on and on, the really great writers wrote by hand. (The 
only major one whose works would have been improved by using a word processor 
is Leo Tolstoy. War and Peace is just too long.) 
</P>
<P>
So instead of your muttering over the dangers to the nation's literary prowess 
of the computer as a writing tool, you'd show more strength of character by 
renouncing your typewriter and declaring heroically that you are going back to 
basics and henceforth write with a quill pen. Be a real Luddite. 
</P>
<P>
Forty years ago a fountain pen might have been an acceptable alternative, but 
now a Waterman costs from $150 up and is just a status symbol, so a quill pen 
is the only serious choice. 
</P>
<P>
As for your other point, about the potential life-threatening dangers posed by 
electromagnetism from computer screens, that's piddling stuff for real writers 
who historically have been placed in jeopardy by all kinds of hazards: 
stabbing, hanging, beheading, shooting, imprisonment, torture, Siberia, the 
Gulag and other forms of exile such as that currently suffered by Mr. Salman 
Rushdie. The worst you have to worry about as a writer is that at some future 
wine and cheese party there are those Costa Mesa officials who might cut you 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
Nor can it be demonstrated that one writing machine is significantly safer than 
another. Use a pencil and you're apt to get lead poisoning, especially if you 
lick the point; for inspiration. From a pen (whether quill, steel nib or 
fountain) there's a danger of general poisoning -- well-documented in the 
syndrome known as the "poison pen." They say that people have drowned while 
writing under water with their ball points. Even a typewriter is not risk-free. 
I heard of an author whose foot was smashed when she dropped her Underwood on 
it. 
</P>
<P>
What with one thing and another (and I forgot to mention the possibility of 
alcoholism), it's surprising that serious writers can buy health and life 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
So please stop moaning on about another tired old topic.

PHYSICIAN'S TRIBUTE TO AN UNCOMMON BRAVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On behalf of the UCI Clinical Cancer Center faculty and staff, I would like to 
express our sincere appreciation for your tribute to Maria Flores. 
</P>
<P>
Medical professionals and care givers face the difficult burden of losing 
terminally ill patients continually; yet when confronted by the loss of a 
courageous patient -- particularly a young child -- the strain is all the more 
profound. 
</P>
<P>
Your acknowledgement of Maria's uncommon bravery and attitude was a great 
comfort to her family, friends, and care givers. Indeed, they will treasure 
both the June article and September memorial tribute. 
</P>
<P>
Thank you again for your sensitivity and understanding.

ASSISTANCE NEEDED IN FIGHTING GANGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am appalled! On the same day you were glamorizing gangs with three color 
photos of a male model in "street savvy" clothes in front of a graffiti-covered 
wall on the front page of the View section, more than 500 educators, parents, 
law enforcement and judicial authorities and interested citizens were trying to 
learn more about preventive and interventive measures with gangs at the Gang 
Symposium in Downey, sponsored by the Los Angeles County Education Department, 
Downey Unified Schools and the city. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, I searched your paper for a report about the symposium and found 
none. 
</P>
<P>
In that same issue in the Orange County section there was a report of gang 
sweeps by Santa Ana police that stated the gang population in Los Angeles 
County as 71,000 and the number of gangs as over 700, but we were informed that 
the members number 100,000 and the gangs, over 800. 
</P>
<P>
Gangs are a symptom of alienated, turned-off, disenfranchised youth, and the 
results of children being involved in them include canceled lives, terrorized 
generations of families and many times, death. We need to educate citizens on 
how to prevent gang participation and not use any type of media, subliminal or 
overt, to entice them to join a life of destruction. Entire communities need to 
get involved -- parents, teachers, counselors, law enforcement and judicial 
people, businesses, service clubs, churches and government. And we need all the 
help you can give us.

RECONSTITUTED GRAPE A JUICY REMINDER OF THE GLORY DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

They come and they go and then, years later, they come back, either for a 
second shot at stardom or simply to cash in on their legacies. One of the 
latest entries in the comeback sweepstakes is Legendary Grape, previously known 
as Moby Grape, one of the most revered products of San Francisco's fertile 
late-1960s rock scene. 
</P>
<P>
The reconstituted Grape will appear tonight at Winston's Beach Club in Ocean 
Beach. And unlike most oldies groups, they are awfully close to the real thing. 
All but one of the five original members are on board: guitarists Jerry Miller 
and Peter Lewis, bassist Bob Mosley, and drummer Don Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
And they're not only touring throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe, 
but writing a bunch of new songs -- something all too few oldies groups even 
bother with -- in the hopes of getting a record deal. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from recent concert reviews, the new Grape is every bit as good as the 
old. Since their fall from grace, the four have gone through some pretty hard 
times -- at one point, in the 1970s, Mosley was pumping gas at a National City 
filling station -- and thus seem particularly determined to make another go at 
it. Moby Grape was formed in 1967 in San Francisco. Miller, Mosley and 
Stevenson had previously played together as a trio, the Frantics. After hooking 
up with Lewis, who is Loretta Young's son, and guitarist Skip Spence, who had 
briefly played drums in the Jefferson Airplane, Moby Grape made quite a splash 
on the local club scene with its provocative music, a structured hybrid of 
folk-rock and the free-form psychedelia that was the rage in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, record company talent scouts were flocking to San Francisco for a 
wild signing spree, and Moby Grape promptly landed a deal with Columbia 
Records. The group's debut was critically well received, but it was a 
commercial flop, perhaps because it got too much hype: Eight of the 13 songs 
were released simultaneously as singles, creating nothing but confusion for Top 
40 deejays. 
</P>
<P>
A second album, 1968's "Wow," also failed to make much of an impact on the 
charts, and the Grape subsequently disbanded, only to reunite a year later as a 
foursome, without Spence. Five years and countless breakups and reformations 
later, they finally gave up when an old manager, who had obtained rights to the 
name, banned the group from using the Moby Grape name. 
</P>
<P>
Understandably, the group's return last year, after such a long absence, was 
initially met with much skepticism. Since then, however, group members have 
more than proven themselves, cutting an excellent four-song demonstration tape 
in a San Francisco recording studio, which they're still shopping around, and 
earning myriad plaudits for their live shows. 
</P>
<P>
Reviewing a recent Legendary Grape concert in Seattle, where the four now live, 
a critic for the (Everett) Herald wrote, "They were playing their hearts out 
and nobody ever did it with any more savvy and genuine know-how." 
</P>
<P>
Christian rock group Petra, whose latest album, "Beyond Belief," is currently 
one of the best-selling Christian music albums in the country, will appear 
Friday night at the Starlight Bowl in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
But Bob Hartman, who founded the group in 1972 while attending college in 
Indiana, said the problem of pigeonholing that the group has encountered since 
Day 1 has yet to be overcome. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny. You can sing songs about just about every other kind of religious 
beliefs, as in reggae music, and be categorized alongside any other pop 
artist," Hartman said. "But if you walk in a record store, you have to go to 
the Christian section to find a Christian record. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't a big deal to me, but it is saying that music is still segregated to 
the point where a radio programmer might get one of our records and say it's 
Christian and we don't play Christian, even though the music might fit the 
format in every other way." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, you're unlikely to hear Petra's music on any non-Christian radio 
station, Hartman said, which drastically limits its potential audience. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Petra is doing quite well on its current concert tour. Nearly 3,000 
tickets to the group's Starlight Bowl show have already been sold -- more than 
total ticket sales to recent concerts there by such non-religious acts as Dio 
and Los Lobos. 
</P>
<P>
"We get both extremes," Hartman said. "We have some in the church who think our 
music has nothing spiritual at all in it, and then we have people who think our 
music is nothing but holy, holy, holy. 
</P>
<P>
"So there are misconceptions on both sides, and most of those misconceptions 
can be done away with once people actually hear the band." 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: San Diegan Steve Vaus, producer of the second annual "The Stars 
Come Out for Christmas" benefit album, was in Nashville last week, shooting 
three promotional TV spots with country superstar Randy Travis. The spots will 
be broadcast nationally starting Nov. 26, the day the album, a compilation of 
Christmas tunes sung by big-name pop, rock and country acts, is released. This 
year's beneficiaries are chapters of the American Cancer Society in 20 
California cities, including San Diego, and various nonprofit children's 
hospitals in the United States. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Jello Biafra, former lead singer of hard-core punk-rock group the Dead 
Kennedys, will lecture tonight at UC San Diego's Price Center ballroom on 
constitutional rights, censorship and the emergence of a "new right." He'll be 
speaking from experience: In 1985, the Dead Kennedys' controversial 
"Frankenchrist" album cover forced Biafra to stand trial on charges of 
"distribution of harmful material to a minor." The trial ended in a hung jury 
and the case was dismissed. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tickets go on sale Thursday at 3 p.m. for the Waterboys' Dec. 9 show at 
Symphony Hall, and Iggy Pop's Dec. 10 concert, with Alice in Chains, at Iguanas 
in Tijuana. Tickets go on sale Friday at 3 p.m. for the Cocteau Twins' Dec. 10 
concert at Spreckels Theatre downtown. Mazzy Star will open. . . .

CLOSE ENCOUNTERS WITH LERE'S SCULPTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUVAN GEER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Transforming the gallery into a suggestive, but always enigmatic narrative, 
Mark Lere's latest sculptures at Margo Leavin Gallery make a game of reading 
visual language. Instead of cyclone stacks these are abstract objects haunted 
by vaguely familiar secrets. Some hint at figurative form, others at 
utilitarian objects like dumbbells, umbrellas or saddles. Still others recall 
Lere's familiar mobius strip tea cups. They recycle their own emptiness. 
Hovering close to recognition, they all breed a certain cozy familiarity, but 
taken together they build toward an organic, vaguely ominous game of 
strangeness and manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
Lere's objects are refined, purist abstractions with possible philosophic or 
psychological underpinnings. They are also playful. Nearly all of the 19 pieces 
in this exhibit are made of a different material: cork, felt, bronze, aluminum, 
copper or cast rubber. Shifts in color, surface and weight coupled with wildly 
changing scale and construction techniques give each piece its own identity. 
It's a fluid identity, however, as moving among the works seems to alter their 
meaning with each new perspective. 
</P>
<P>
Lere has the ability to make an encounter with sculpture into a physical 
reality rife with intellectual ramifications. Although he strongly suggests the 
work of Barry Le Va, Lere has a more narrative agenda. Yet it is a narrative 
written in the observer as Lere crosses geometry's pure reason with the 
unsettling openness of the unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
 Margo Leavin Gallery, 812 N. Robertson Blvd., to Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Megan Williams taps into a personal unconscious; something tantalizingly comic, 
enigmatic, even sexy. There is something genuinely appealing about the 
absurdity she pumps out in drawings, sculpture and installations even if the 
ideas do feel like they were inspired by Disney's "Silly Symphony." But as her 
drawings at the Santa Monica Museum of Art make clear, the cartoon quality is 
part of Williams' underlying premise that art has a ticklish edge that borders 
on pure, sensual pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
Most installations have a simple, good-time directness that is easy to absorb 
but lacks real depth. Whether that's a result of editing for the exhibit or a 
reflection of the way the artist normally works is unclear. Books fluttering 
around a lectern like pigeons waiting for a handout or crisp white doors 
unfurling like snappy accordion pleated banners need more than surreal enigma 
and cursory nods to mystic number systems to give them unity or staying power. 
More interesting are the standardized female figures carved into a strip of 
rubber and the faceless Dutch bankers with floating hats that hint at issues of 
lost identity. 
</P>
<P>
Thankfully, Williams' sensuality comes through loud and clear in her spiraling 
"Systems to Measure / Three Dimensional Drawing." This drawing in real space 
uses almost invisible monofilament to float silky white and jittery black lines 
into mysteriously unwinding linear cyclones. Tucked into the back of this 
all-white nook is a faint hail of broken lines that makes the entire sight even 
more a fantasy. 
</P>

TREASURES FROM MUNDANE ITEMS;

MAURIZIO PELLEGRIN PROVES THAT IT'S NOT WHAT YOU ARRANGE, BUT HOW YOU ARRANGE 
IT.

<P>
When a child empties his pockets and lines up his treasures -- a key, a gum 
ball, a rabbit's foot, a coin, a stamp -- there's something magical to the act. 
He arranges and rearranges them in rows and sequences, relishes the memories 
that each object embodies and imbues them in his mind with mysterious powers. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian artist Maurizio Pellegrin, a 33-year-old native of Venice who now 
lives in Rome, has preserved this same sense of innocence and ingenuousness in 
his work. He is a collector of incidentals -- a rifle bag, a golf ball, a 
button, a scrap from a broken picture frame, a torn photograph. He is an 
alchemist who turns these valueless treasures into art simply by spreading them 
out, arranging them and installing them on gallery walls in patterns that are, 
in the end, very beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
Pellegrin is well-known in Europe; his work has been exhibited widely there and 
was included in 1988 Venice Biennale, but a selection of six large 
installations that now on view at the San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art in 
La Jolla marks his first museum show in the United States (through Feb. 10, 
1990). The exhibition was organized by Lynda Forsha, the museum's curator. 
</P>
<P>
It is a memorable and evocative first taste. Pellegrin appears to be one of 
those artists who have such an intrinsic sense of design and an ingenuous 
delight in the simple object that their uncluttered arrangements are hard to 
resist. 
</P>
<P>
In the works here he includes as few as one or two objects and as many as 189. 
Each element has a history, although we don't know where they came from or 
whether the artist has owned them for long. All of the parts look old and 
somewhat worn. Often Pellegrin alters the objects by painting black bands on 
their surfaces to add sobriety, like armbands that signify mourning. And he 
numbers everything with stenciled numerals, in no particular order, adding some 
spice though the inexplicable magic of numerology. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a very personal mix; each element of the installations has a 
history, collectively they create unusual harmonies. 
</P>
<P>
As you enter the museum, you are confronted first with a wall-sized 
installation titled "Angolature Selettive (Selective Corners)," 1989. This 
collection of 73 elements line the wall in an arrangement that lacks any 
obvious order, yet the work has its own sense of balance and interplay, an 
intrinsic stability that is evident in all of Pellegrin's work. 
</P>
<P>
The components of the piece are commonplace enough: most are pieces from a 
variety of dressmakers' patterns, blueprints for women's clothing parts. There 
are also a couple of spools of thread, a long-sleeved green knit dress, several 
wooden hangers and a fabric-covered oval form that is dotted with black 
buttons. Amid all this is a pair of framed images, including a photograph, its 
image obscured, and a collage that includes a white glove, a button and a scrap 
of linen fabric. 
</P>
<P>
And always there's the artist's imprint: Every object is stamped with a numeral 
-- again with no order. Sometimes two or even three of numbers decorate a 
single object. 
</P>
<P>
Much of this stuff looks like what you might find in a junk shop. Or at an 
estate sale. The materials are attractive in and of themselves, natural 
materials, good design. 
</P>
<P>
Pellegrin gives no explanations, but none are needed. The objects all are 
familiar, and yet foreign, the numbers are meaningless, but easy to project 
meaning into. This looks like an archeologist's find -- but it's stuff that has 
been found before any significant amount of time has lapsed. 
</P>
<P>
A statement by the artist suggests that he assigns meaning to his numbers: "I 
was born on the 21st day of the month," he once said in an interview, "The 
number 21 stands for the universe, embodying the karmic reward, the success and 
elevation which come after a long battle." Perhaps in Pellegrin's mind there is 
significance to every element, but he tells us nothing. And it doesn't matter. 
We can take pleasure in how the objects look. And we can add our own 
interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
Where "Selective Corners" represents a feminine side of the artist's work -- 
women's clothing -- "Disideri Lontani Oltre il Giardino (Distant Desire Beyond 
the Garden)," 1988, is the sporting side, perhaps the masculine side. Among the 
35 objects hung artfully for this latter work are three rifle bags, two golf 
balls, a leather glove and a selection of boards covered with fabric. 
</P>
<P>
Another work includes numerous score-keeping paddles for billiards, and another 
is made up mostly of broken fragments from 18th- and 19th-Century wooden 
frames. 
</P>
<P>
Each work contains a photograph, in one case a young girl riding an elephant, 
in another what looks like a self-portrait of the artist. All of them are 
altered and aged, too. Some are torn, as if ravaged by time. 
</P>
<P>
There is a seductiveness to this show that is very convincing, and yet, despite 
the beauty, there is a certain consistency and sameness to all of the works. 
The six works here are very satisfying, but one has to wonder what it might be 
like to see more. Would all this mystery degenerate into pretentiousness? Would 
all this history begin to seem empty? Thankfully, the museum had the good sense 
to leave us guessing. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Pellegrin show, a second far more disappointing one-person 
show also has opened at the La Jolla museum (through January, 1991). The new 
York-based conceptual artist John Knight (born in 1945) made a mockery of the 
opportunity to share his work with the public. 
</P>
<P>
Using the museum's windows -- with their splendid ocean views -- as his ground, 
he frosted the glass with fragments of the word "Bienvenido" (Spanish for 
welcome), obscuring the views. Looking out from the museum's Glass Gallery, you 
see only shapes -- frosted window and small areas of translucent glass operate 
like an Ellsworth Kelly abstract painting. 
</P>
<P>
But the method here is not arbitrary. The message -- which is totally illegible 
-- is meant to be three-stories high, and, if the frosting were visible from 
the exterior of the museum -- which it is not -- then that is the only place 
where you could see the relationship between the fragments, the only hint of 
what it is supposed to say. Walls separate windows, and nothing is inscribed on 
them, all that there is is fragments. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the work, which since it is unintelligible amounts just to decorative 
window frosting, takes place in the museum offices, all of which are 
inaccessible to the public except by appointment, and in the museum's basement, 
also inaccessible to the public. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, there is nothing to see and little that you could see even if you 
wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
This show is a violation of the efforts and monies that go into a public museum 
presentation. 
</P>
<P>
Where is the public left after all of this silliness? 
</P>
<P>
Out of it.

N.Y. NEW MUSIC ENSEMBLE IN CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD S. GINELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Without a doubt, the New York New Music Ensemble is a gem of a group. These 
musicians are alert, technically scrupulous, prepared to the teeth -- and, most 
notably for a new-music group, passionately expressive no matter how difficult 
or abstract the score. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the hard part: finding something worthwhile to play. 
</P>
<P>
On that count, only one of the four pieces heard at the group's appearance 
Monday night in the Leo S. Bing Theater of the County Museum of Art -- part of 
the Monday Evening Concerts series -- had anything resembling coherence or 
emotional power. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, it took up about half of the program. 
</P>
<P>
The piece in question is Sir Peter Maxwell Davies' "Ave Maris Stella," a 
mesmerizing 27-minute one-movement sextet that finds the composer again 
transforming the seascape beneath his home in the Orkney Islands into sound. 
</P>
<P>
Although each player takes turns evoking the choppy seas in fragmented bursts, 
the textures change noticeably, and each section of the work is clearly 
defined. 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, everything becomes magically still, with the alto flute simulating 
a distant foghorn. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Black sensitively led a sextet that included ensemble members Daniel 
Druckman (marimba), Christopher Finckel (cello), Jean Kopperud (clarinet), Jayn 
Rosenfeld (alto flute) and guests Cyrus Stevens (violin) and James Winn 
(piano). 
</P>
<P>
Particularly impressive was Finckel's warm, lyrical solo at the beginning of 
"Ave Maris Stella" and the group's amazingly hushed, delicate playing at a 
pianissimo volume toward the close. 
</P>
<P>
Poul Ruders' "Vox in Rama" for clarinet, piano and amplified violin tries to 
travel the same route from agitation to calm in one-third the time -- and the 
opening does have an appealing, quirky sense of syncopated violence. Yet where 
Maxwell Davies succeeds in imposing form and order over potential chaos, Ruders 
merely allows the momentum to drift away, and the music just hangs there, 
waiting for a denouement that never arrives. 
</P>
<P>
The program opened with MEC director Dorrance Stalvey's 
"Exordium/Genesis/Dawn", a shapeless canvas of brittle staccatos for the full 
sextet, relieved somewhat by a few lyrical interludes. 
</P>
<P>
Bun-Ching Lam's arid "Another Spring" for piano, alto flute and cello also 
rambles aimlessly from episode to episode, busywork without point. For what 
it's worth, both pieces, as well as the Ruders, were having their local 
premieres.

O.C. VOTERS APPROVING TRANSPORTATION TAX; 
</P>
<P>
MEASURE M: COUNTY'S FIRST SELF-IMPOSED TAX INCREASE IN ROUGHLY 30 YEARS APPEARS 
TO BE WINNING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County voters were approving early today a sweeping package of highway 
and transit projects, financed by a half-cent sales tax. If would be the first 
self-imposed tax increase here in roughly 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Measure M backers were trying for the third time in six years to aid the 
county's bedraggled motorists, who endure some of the state's most congested 
highways. 
</P>
<P>
Late Tuesday, after continually trailing with only a fourth of the precincts 
counted, Measure M opponents conceded defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't for the life of me believe that they did this," said Bill Ward, a 
spokesman for Drivers for Highway Safety, which opposed the measure. "They 
managed to target the right people this time. . . . I think it would take 
something miraculous to turn it around. I think it's clear 'M' has passed." 
</P>
<P>
Board of Supervisors Chairman Don R. Roth said: "This is the No. 1 surprise of 
the whole election in Orange County. What's happened is that every day 99% of 
us are sitting in traffic jams realizing that something has to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Passage of the measure would mean the half-cent sales tax would be imposed here 
to raise $3.1 billion over a 20-year period. Money would go for freeway 
improvements, reconstruction of the El Toro Y, for regional and local street 
projects, as well as for commuter rail and other transit programs. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would cost each Orange County resident $50 to $75 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Voters in the state's other urban counties -- including all of the counties 
bordering Orange County -- already have approved such sales tax hikes for 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign for Measure M marked the third time in six years that Orange 
County voters had considered such a tax. Last year a nearly identical proposal 
lost by about 14,000 votes -- 53% to 47%. A 1-cent increase was soundly 
defeated in 1984, 70% to 30%. 
</P>
<P>
Reed Royalty, a Pacific Bell executive who chaired the pro-M campaign, said the 
lead gave him confidence. "We did of course have a strong drive to vote by 
mail," Royalty said, "and that's where these votes are from. . . . I hope it 
means we're going to win." 
</P>
<P>
Royalty, who was joined by about 15 supporters at the Measure M campaign office 
in Santa Ana, said that momentum in the past few days shifted in favor of the 
ballot measure. "We have tracked the trend with polls. . . . The last one we 
took was less than a week ago (Saturday) and it showed that with no information 
about the measure being given, 51% of the respondents would vote for it. When 
they were simply read the language that was on the ballot, the figure rose to 
62% -- a bit of a rise from what we had been seeing earlier." 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of Measure M mounted a $1.1-million campaign that included telephone 
calls to voters and computer-generated mail that resembled personal letters 
from a resident of each community to neighbors, and missives from the 
Automobile Club of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The measure included something for everyone -- growth controls, a citizens' 
oversight committee, and a broad mix of projects to appeal to partisans of 
freeways, commuter trains and neighborhood streets. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the campaign dollars came from developers and the construction 
industry, out of concern that worsening traffic congestion would hurt business 
and prompt a decline in Orange County's quality of life.

<P>
But the campaign was low-key, with the mail not reaching voters until the final 
week before Tuesday's balloting. Also, the proponents, led by Royalty, spent 
far less than the $2.4 million consumed in last year's losing effort. 
</P>
<P>
The opponents, an unlikely coalition of anti-tax and slow-growth activists, 
said they spent less than $1,000, held one press conference, and appeared in 
one televised debate on a station with a limited audience. 
</P>
<P>
The opponents split, with some arguing against any tax hike and others claiming 
that it would promote new growth, thus canceling any gains in commute times. 
Still others said that Measure M's funding for car-pool lanes and increased 
commuter rail service lacks merit.

13 OFFICIALS TO STUDY TRANSIT SYSTEMS IN EUROPE; 
</P>
<P>
TRAVEL: A FORMER ORANGE COUNTY SUPERVISOR AND A YORBA LINDA COUNCILMAN ARE 
AMONG THOSE GOING ON THE TRIP.

Two Orange County men will be among 13 of the state's most influential 
transportation and environmental officials who will leave today on an 
all-expenses-paid, 12-day trip to Europe to study high-speed railroads, 
high-tech automobiles and highways and exotic alternative fuel systems. 
</P>
<P>
Former Orange County Supervisor Bruce Nestande, a vice president of Costa 
Mesa-based Arnel Development Co. and a member of the California Transportation 
Commission, is among the globe-trotters, as well as Yorba Linda Councilman 
Henry W. Wedaa, a member of the South Coast Air Quality Management District 
board. 
</P>
<P>
The trip to Paris, Berlin, Stockholm and other cities is being sponsored by two 
California business organizations that say they try to preserve a cautious 
"environmental balance" while combatting environmental extremists. 
</P>
<P>
The California Foundation on the Environment and the Economy, an offshoot of 
the California Council for Environmental and Economic Balance, will pay all 
expenses on the $4,000-a-person trip that are not picked up by European 
industrial hosts, according to foundation director Pat Mason. 
</P>
<P>
Serving as staff for the trip will be two officials of the California Institute 
for Technology Exchange, Don Camph and Yvonne Ryzak. Mason and Camph said in 
separate interviews that far from being a junket, this and other annual trips 
the foundation has sponsored in recent years have been hard-working looks, in 
Mason's words, "at how other countries have dealt with 
technological-environmental issues." 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder when I'm going to get a nap," said Mason of the forthcoming trip. 
</P>
<P>
Said Camph: "Our premise is that one of the ways public policy is formed and 
facilitated is direct exposure of policy makers to what is going on in various 
societies. . . . I'm not going to tell you we're not going to have some fun. 
But it's basically work." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the group will fly economy class and stay in moderately priced 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Among those scheduled to go are three state transportation commissioners who 
have been skeptical of expenditures for rail right-of-way acquisitions and 
commuter rail projects, commission Chairman W. E. (Bill) Leonard and members 
Nestande and Joe Duffel. 
</P>
<P>
Nestande said, "We have a very jammed schedule. . . . We are in Berlin for less 
than a day." 
</P>
<P>
The four legislators are Republican state Sen. Becky Morgan, vice chairman of 
the Senate Transportation Committee; Republican state Sen. Bill Leonard, 
chairman of the Senate Republican Caucus; Assemblyman Jim Costa, a Democrat, 
and Democratic Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin. Costa recently sponsored 
legislation authorizing Caltrans to help privately funded rail and road 
projects with gifts of public rights of way. Easton is a member of both the 
Assembly Transportation and Toxic Materials committees. 
</P>
<P>
Others going include retired Senate President Pro Tem James Mills, now chairman 
of the San Diego Metro Transit Development Board; Norton Younglove, a Riverside 
County supervisor who is chairman of the managing board of the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District; Chris Reed, a Santa Monica city councilwoman who 
is chairman of the Southern California Assn. of Governments; Wedaa, who is vice 
chairman of AQMD; Rod Dierdon, a Santa Clara County supervisor who is chairman 
of the San Jose area's Metropolitan Transportation Commission, and Nello 
Bianco, chairman of BART, the Bay Area Rapid Transit system. 
</P>
<P>
Also going are two businessmen, Jack Coffey, manager of state affairs for 
Chevron, and Steve Baum, senior vice president and general counsel for San 
Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co.

AN ORANGE BUSINESSMAN, CITING HIS 'CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY,' DISTRIBUTED A SMALL 
GUIDE THAT PUT THE MEASURES' PROS AND CONS IN PLAIN ENGLISH.

It might have been a moneymaker, but Daniel J. Scinto was faxing it away for 
free: an informed, opinionated, independent guide to the 28 ballot propositions 
-- and only three pages long. 
</P>
<P>
"This may sound really silly but I really felt I had a civic responsibility to 
do that," the Orange businessman said Tuesday. "The ballots are getting to be 
overwhelming and very few people have the time to really sit down and study the 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
Scinto, a 41-year-old Republican with a Libertarian bent, distributed the tip 
sheet to his 25 employees, then faxed it along to friends. Even voters who 
disagree with Scinto's ideology might have found the guide useful Tuesday as 
they lamented the devilishly confusing wording of the propositions and tried to 
avoid stumbling over the "evil twin" measures designed to cancel each other 
out. 
</P>
<P>
One such stumped voter was Republican Sandra Fishman of Capistrano Beach, who 
spent 4 1/2 hours Monday night trying to decipher her mammoth voter information 
package. 
</P>
<P>
"The ballot was ludicrous, absolutely ludicrous," Fishman said. Even armed with 
the 143-page California Ballot Pamphlet, the 79-page Supplemental Ballot 
Pamphlet, the 35-page Orange County voter information pamphlet, a list of her 
party's recommendations and a college education, Fishman said, "I simply 
couldn't figure out if it's what I wanted to vote for or not." 
</P>
<P>
Among the measures Fishman wrestled with were Propositions 135 and 128, each of 
which promised to regulate pesticides. "If you vote for both of them they 
cancel each other out, so you want to vote for the one you want to vote for, 
and against the other one," Fishman explained. "But it was difficult for me to 
decipher which one was which!" 
</P>
<P>
When she walked out of her polling place, "everybody there was just shaking 
their heads, using works like 'ludicrous, ridiculous, asinine, makes you feel 
like a dummy,' " Fishman said, adding, "If we are going to get people to come 
out and vote, we are going to have to simplify the ballot so people can 
understand it." 
</P>
<P>
Even some voters who did their homework stubbed their toes on the nine-part 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
One Orange County newsman, who asked not to be named to spare himself the scorn 
of his colleagues, arrived at the polls with a crib sheet in hand. The 
green-minded voter had intended to vote for Proposition 130 and against 
Proposition 138 but became confused and "accidently voted so that the timber 
industry can clear-cut away half of California." 
</P>
<P>
Voters who realize they have erred while still inside the booth may request new 
ballots. But the newsman was home before he realized his mistake. He quickly 
called his mother and asked her to vote the opposite way to cancel out his 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
Scinto's self-styled people's guide to the propositions was intended to avoid 
such pitfalls -- as well as the disinformation contained in slate mailers that 
turned out to have been paid for by candidates or special interests. 
</P>
<P>
"Having trouble voting on all the propositions?" Scinto's missive begins. 
"Please do not look at the commercials. All of them are so misleading. 
Especially the ones who have actors and actresses. 
</P>
<P>
". . . If you are in love with 'Flipper' then vote yes," he advised on 
Proposition 132, the Marine Resources initiative, which would ban gill and 
trammel nets. "Otherwise vote no. You decide." 
</P>
<P>
As one might expect, the Harvard MBA and former accountant recommended voting 
against the 10 bond issues, increasing motor vehicle fuel taxes, "Big Green," 
and the "Save the Redwoods" timber initiative -- but the self-proclaimed 
teetotaler suggested a "Yes" vote on the alcohol taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives me the opportunity to vote for a tax that I do not have to pay. . . 
. " Scinto said. "If you are a heavy drinker, you should vote NO." 
</P>
<P>
And, despite the confusion and extra effort voters needed to sift through the 
complex initiatives, Scinto recommended voting yes on Proposition 137, the 
initiative that would reform -- foes say hinder -- future initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
"This referendum will make it impossible for the Legislature to stop us voting 
on referendums," Scinto declared. "This reserves the right for Californians to 
vote. This is without a question a 'Yes' vote."

GOP KEEPS GRIP ON ORANGE COUNTY'S HOUSE DELEGATION; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: EVEN IN THE 38TH DISTRICT, THE ONLY ONE IN THE COUNTY WITH A 
DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY, DORNAN CAPTURES THREE-FIFTHS OF THE VOTE.

Republican incumbents in Orange County's five congressional races took 
comfortable leads in early election returns Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), seeking his fourth term representing 
the 38th Congressional District, garnered about three-fifths of the vote with 
absentee ballots and some precincts counted. 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Barbara Jackson withdrew from the race early on and did not campaign, 
but still managed to draw significant percentage of the vote. Jackson, a public 
affairs director for Planned Parenthood, pulled out of the race because she 
feared her campaign could jeopardize her employer's tax-exempt status. 
</P>
<P>
The 38th District is the only one in the county where the majority of the 
voters are registered Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach), who gained national attention as 
an outspoken opponent of funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, was 
leading Democrat Guy C. Kimbrough in the 42nd Congressional District, 2 to 1. A 
third candidate in the race, Libertarian Richard Gibb Martin, a Long Beach 
contractor, did not appear to be mounting a serious challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher's fellow freshman in the Orange County delegation, Rep. Christopher 
Cox (R-Newport Beach), was also well ahead of his opponent in the 40th 
District, Democrat Eugene C. Gratz of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton), a member of Congress since 1978 who 
is best known for his strident opposition to gay rights, was leading Democrat 
Francis X. Hoffman, a Garden Grove lawyer, with more than two-thirds of the 
absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
In the 43rd District, Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) faced no Democratic 
opposition and was cruising to an easy victory. Packard, who was elected as a 
write-in candidate in 1982, was challenged by Libertarian Richard L. Arnold and 
Peace and Freedom Party member Doug Hansen. Early returns showed him leading 
his challengers, 4 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Congressmen earn $96,600 a year. On Jan. 1, a raise will take effect that will 
raise representatives' salaries to $120,800. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has not sent a Democrat to Washington since 1982.

BATES LOSING IN SAN DIEGO; 2 OTHER INCUMBENTS IN TROUBLE; 
</P>
<P>
CONGRESS: NAVY FIGHTER SHOOTING DOWN VULNERABLE DEMOCRAT, WHILE PASHAYAN AND 
BOSCO ARE LOCKED IN TIGHT RACES.

A highly decorated Navy fighter pilot was defeating Democratic Rep. Jim Bates 
of San Diego on Tuesday, and two other incumbents were locked in tight races 
with challengers who had sought to link them with the savings and loan debacle. 
</P>
<P>
Bates, pursuing a fifth term as the representative from the 44th District, was 
trailing GOP challenger Randall (Duke) Cunningham, a colorful campaigner who 
had described the congressman as "just another MiG" ready to be shot down. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bates exuded confidence going into the election, Republicans viewed 
the incumbent as vulnerable because he was reprimanded last year by the House 
Ethics Committee over charges he had sexually harassed female staff members. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the state, incomplete returns showed Rep. Charles (Chip) Pashayan 
(R-Fresno) lagging behind Visalia farmer Calvin Dooley, a Democrat. And in a 
race that may have caught Democrats off guard, four-term North Coast incumbent 
Douglas Bosco (D-Sebastopol), was trailing an underfunded businessman, Frank 
Riggs, in the 1st District. 
</P>
<P>
"The trend is going our way," Dooley said while celebrating with supporters at 
a Visalia restaurant. "It looks good." 
</P>
<P>
Pashayan, appearing nervous, declined to talk with the press and closeted 
himself with aides to monitor the returns. 
</P>
<P>
In two other California races that drew nationwide attention this year, GOP 
stalwart Rep. Al McCandless was holding a narrow lead over television actor 
Ralph Waite in Riverside County's sprawling 37th District, and veteran Rep. 
George Brown (D-Colton) was fending off Robert Hammock, a San Bernardino County 
supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like the numbers are holding up," Brown said while watching returns 
at his campaign headquarters in San Bernardino. But, he added, "I'm not going 
to claim victory until Bob says he's lost." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the handful of close races, most California representatives survived 
with ease this election year. That means Democrats will continue to hold a wide 
edge over Republicans in the California House delegation. Before the election, 
the margin was 27-18. 
</P>
<P>
Only two open House seats were up for grabs in California, and their likely 
winners symbolize the polar extremes of the state's political spectrum. Los 
Angeles Assemblywoman Maxine Waters, a liberal Democrat, was considered a 
shoo-in to succeed retiring Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
And state Sen. John Doolittle, a Republican from Rocklin best known for 
sponsoring AIDS-related bills deemed hostile to gays, had a comfortable lead in 
the race for the 14th District seat vacated by Rep. Norman Shumway 
(R-Stockton). 
</P>
<P>
Accustomed to scoring easy victories throughout their tenures in Congress, 
Bosco -- who won with 63% of the vote in 1988 -- and Pashayan wrestled this 
year with challengers whose campaigns exploited an issue used effectively in 
races across the country -- the savings and loan debacle. 
</P>
<P>
Dooley, 36, sought to link Pashayan with Charles Keating, head of the 
scandal-ridden Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan and the most visible symbol of the 
S&amp;L crisis. In 1986, Keating and his family donated $26,000 to Pashayan, 
and though the congressman returned the money last year, he was recently 
accused of lobbying federal regulators on Lincoln's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging he met with Keating within days of receiving his 1986 
contributions, Pashayan, 49, insisted his letters and phone calls to regulators 
were strictly to aid a thrift in his district. 
</P>
<P>
Dooley, a cotton grower, worked hard to paint himself in contrasting colors, 
emphasizing his ancestors' agricultural history in the San Joaquin Valley and 
pledging, if elected, to pursue water and farming policies favoring the "little 
guy." 
</P>
<P>
Bosco, whose ardent environmental stands have made him popular with many voters 
in the Redwood Empire, became vulnerable after he was unfavorably linked to a 
failed thrift in his district.

DANA PARSONS: ROCKY MOUNTAIN LOW: A BAD FEELING IS GROWING AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By DANA PARSONS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm not panicking, I'm not panicking, I'm not panicking. 
</P>
<P>
But as Yogi Berra once said, it's deja vu all over again. 
</P>
<P>
In the late '70s, Denver vibrated with promise. To Midwest and East Coast 
transplants, it offered the best of both worlds -- a sophisticated center of 
high-rises and arts centers flanked by some of the most beautiful scenery 
Mother Nature ever laid on anybody. 
</P>
<P>
During the '70s and early '80s, the developers couldn't rebuild downtown Denver 
or Colorado fast enough. At one point, with the building boom in full stride, a 
national publication took a look at downtown Denver construction and suggested 
that the state bird must be the 40-story crane. 
</P>
<P>
If city life wasn't for you, a growing suburbia ringed Denver where you could 
also buy a house and make a bundle in a short time. And whether you lived in 
city or suburb, you could quite possibly stand in your yard and get misty-eyed 
gazing at the snow-capped Rocky Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Baby, if it wasn't paradise, it was close enough. 
</P>
<P>
Like other people who moved to Colorado in the late '70s, I thought I'd caught 
a ride on a golden goose. I bought a house in 1978 and sold it five years later 
for a 70% profit. While there had been talk of Denver historically being a 
boom-and-bust town, everyone thought it would be different this time -- that 
this time, Denver was on an ever-ascending path. Number one with a bullet. 
</P>
<P>
The euphoria went beyond real estate profits. There was a headiness that was 
much written about and talked about -- the notion that we were truly blessed to 
be living in Denver in the late 1970s, as if some kind of anointing had 
occurred and that by the grace of God we had been selected as the chosen 
people. 
</P>
<P>
The front-page logo in the Denver Post -- " 'Tis a privilege to live in 
Colorado." -- was taken as gospel. 
</P>
<P>
They don't talk like that in Denver any more. The 1980s post-mortem is that 
Denver was drastically overbuilt, with commercial office vacancies now at a 
reported 33%. A friend of mine owes $90,000 on a house now valued at $79,000. 
One of the more vivid legacies of downtown is that of a new 37-floor office 
building that was nearly vacant for more than a year after it opened, with its 
most visible tenant being the city Planning Department. 
</P>
<P>
During the '80s, many people who had a Rocky Mountain high left and took their 
dreams with them. When I went back last May to visit friends, I drove to my old 
neighborhood. There was a HUD sign on my townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Sigh. 
</P>
<P>
Thank you for indulging me this burst of personal reminiscence. It was sparked 
a few weeks ago by a Mission Viejo woman who stood before the County Planning 
Commission and spoke in favor of a large residential development in South 
County. Before she did, however, she said that she and other friends felt lucky 
to live in Orange County and that while she wished people would stop pouring 
in, she knew that was unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
I can't tell you how many conversations I had like that 15 years ago. I see the 
same strut here that Denver once had, the same sense that we can be bruised but 
never broken. 
</P>
<P>
But recent reports of ill winds blowing aren't comforting. Foreclosures and 
bankruptcies are rising; corporate earnings and home sales are falling. 
</P>
<P>
And we keep building. And as we do, from Santiago Canyon to the Irvine coast, 
from the ridgelines of Laguna Niguel to Seal Beach, people are asking why. A 
planning commissioner recently chided a developer for seeking approval for a 
large project at such a perilous economic time. He then went ahead and voted 
for the project. 
</P>
<P>
I'm no economic expert, and this soliloquy isn't to suggest that Orange County 
could go the way of Denver. People much smarter than I say Orange County is 
nowhere near as overbuilt as other places in the country that bottomed out in 
the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
They're probably right. But I can't shake these visions of golden geese and 
see-through office buildings and paradises with boards on the windows. 
</P>
<P>
I think from time to time about the magic that was Colorado in the late '70s. 
In his song "Rocky Mountain High," which probably lured more people to Colorado 
in the mid-1970s than anything the state tourism industry ever did, John Denver 
wrote about his love for the beauty of Colorado and his fear for its future. 
</P>
<P>
Though his life is filled with wonder 
</P>
<P>
His heart still knows some fear 
</P>
<P>
Of the simple things he cannot comprehend 
</P>
<P>
Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more 
</P>
<P>
More people, more scars upon the land. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado was a special place in 1977. I know many people have that same feeling 
today about Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
And I'm not panicking, I'm not panicking, I'm not panicking.

Orange County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder maintained an early lead over 
challenger Joy L. Neugebauer early today in her bid for a fourth consecutive 
term in office, according to partial ballot results. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder, who said she spent Tuesday afternoon walking along the oceanfront, 
enjoying the beach and "indulging" herself after voting, took the lead early in 
the evening Tuesday and built on it as the precincts began reporting in shortly 
before midnight. 
</P>
<P>
She said her lead in the election "was something I expected." 
</P>
<P>
"I have credibility with the voters," said Wieder, who spent part of the 
evening at the Westin South Coast Plaza hotel with supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the voters have a great deal of confidence in me. . . . I am a 
representative, not a politician," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Wieder's lead, Neugebauer said she "ran the race to win" and declined 
to concede defeat shortly after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of votes to come in yet and I'm still optimistic," Neugebauer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder was forced into a runoff for her fourth term representing the 2nd 
District when she finished with 47% of the vote in June, far ahead of 
Neugebauer, who had 20%, and three other challengers. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisor's job carries an annual salary of $82,055. It is a four-year 
term. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder hired a new political consultant for the campaign and pumped out 
issue-oriented mail pieces targeted at different voting groups within the 
district, focusing on her achievements during the past 12 years as the first 
and only woman on the Orange County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Early on, it was clear that Wieder would surpass the challenger in raising 
money. According to the most recent campaign disclosure statements, Wieder had 
raised more than 10 times as much money as Neugebauer, amassing a war chest of 
$259,952 to the challenger's $25,055. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Neugebauer borrowed on her homespun, low-key political style that 
has made her a fixture on the Westminster City Council, where she has served 
for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
In the primary, Neugebauer raised only $12,000 while Wieder spent more than 
$80,000. Neugebauer said she knew that it would be an uphill climb, but 
low-budget campaigns have been her trademark and she said being outspent did 
not scare her because she "has always" relied on volunteers to get the word of 
her campaign to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night Neugebauer said there was no problem with her campaign's 
fund-raising efforts because she wanted "a low-budget campaign." 
</P>
<P>
A few days before the election, Neugebauer said she "was optimistic," and that 
she did "not intend to win this election on developer dollars. I will win it on 
my qualifications and grass-roots support." 
</P>
<P>
The election was in sharp contrast to Wieder campaigns of years past, where 
personally embarrassing information was disclosed, such as in 1988 when her 
opponent revealed that the supervisor had claimed a college degree from Wayne 
State University that she never earned. 
</P>
<P>
Neugebauer did use the college-degree disclosure in campaign speeches as part 
of her political strategy to list "Harriett's negatives," including the fact 
that Wieder had missed more meetings and abstained from more votes than any of 
her board colleagues.

VASQUEZ TO BE GUEST IN FRENCH PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez leaves Friday for an all-expense-paid 
trip to France, where he will spend two weeks, courtesy of the French 
government, participating in a new cultural exchange program. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez is one of no more than 10 Americans who will participate in France's 
Invitational Cultural Exchange Programme, begun last year. 
</P>
<P>
Participants are chosen because they "show promise of a brilliant future" in 
their careers within their own countries, according to the French Consulate. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez chose his own subjects to study while in France: local and regional 
government, public transit, national health care and environmental policies. 
</P>
<P>
He said he expects to gain "invaluable insight into French custom and 
governmental operations." 
</P>
<P>
The French government began the program to teach Americans about France "beyond 
the traditional cliches," according to the consulate. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez will meet with Admiral Philippe de Gaulle, a senator and the son of the 
former French President Charles de Gaulle.

SANTA ANAS KEEPING FIREFIGHTERS NERVOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU and MATT LAIT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Strong Santa Ana winds helped ignite a house fire in San Clemente on Tuesday, 
and fire officials are expected to declare a "red-flag alert" today in 
anticipation that the dry, hot gusts will result in more blazes. 
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday evening, gusts had reached highs of 50 m.p.h. in some Trabuco Canyon 
peaks, 40 m.p.h. in El Toro and ranging from 20 to 30 m.p.h. through much of 
the county, according to fire officials and WeatherData Inc.. Highs 
temperatures today in Orange County are expected to remain in the 70s. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Anas were expected to pick up overnight and through this morning, 
losing some of their already-low levels of moisture along the way. In Santa 
Ana, meteorologists reported humidity of 9%, compared to norms of 30% to 40% as 
the dry winds swept through the area, swirling dust and dirt and leaving some 
trees and electrical wiring in their path. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials will be meeting at 7 a.m. today, probably to issue the first 
"red-flag alert" since the fire season began in April, said Orange County Fire 
Department spokesman Dan Young. 
</P>
<P>
That would mean extra fire patrols in the canyons and other dry areas of the 
county, as well as extra public education announcements to try to avert 
dangerous situations. If the Santa Ana conditions worsen overnight as expected, 
Young said, "we'll be prepared for it." 
</P>
<P>
Winds to the north and northeast helped to ignite a San Clemente home on 
Tuesday and skip the blaze along the tops of half a dozen others. Two boys 
playing with illegal fireworks in a back-yard residence around 3:15 p.m. 
accidentally set several palm trees on fire, said San Clemente Fire Department 
spokesman Jack Stubbs. The wind-swept embers then burned one house and ignited 
shake-shingle roofs at six others on the 200 block of Calle Cortez. 
</P>
<P>
"The winds were blowing the embers all over the place," Stubbs said. 
</P>
<P>
The wind also blew the water from firefighters' hoses away from their targets 
initially, but "we were able to jump on (the fires) before they got out of 
hand," said Stubbs. He described damage as minor to moderate. 
</P>
<P>
At John Wayne Airport, the airplanes altered their takeoff routes, flying north 
instead of south at the outset of their flights to avoid the strong gusts. That 
caused a few minutes of extra flight time on some flights, but airline 
officials reported no other problems. 
</P>
<P>
Given the dryness and strength of the winds, Young said the county was "very 
fortunate" to see only the string of fires in San Clemente. ERIC LICHTBLAU and

MALL CLINIC OFFERS FREE HEALTH TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
St. Joseph Hospital of Orange is offering a health-conscious option for 
mall-goers who have shopped until they're ready to drop. 
</P>
<P>
Free and low-cost eye exams, blood tests and skin cancer screenings are among 
the services available to shoppers who stop by the hospital's new clinic at 
MainPlace/Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"We've put ourselves in a place where in a sense people will trip over us," 
said Joan Trezek, the hospital's director of marketing. "This way we can offer 
a quick look at possible health problems that someone may have." 
</P>
<P>
St. Joseph personnel will administer tests for blood pressure and blood sugar 
levels, cholesterol, glaucoma, cataracts and allergies. Screenings for skin 
cancer and breast exams will also be offered at the Testing 1-2-3 clinic. 
</P>
<P>
St. Joseph opened the clinic last month in partnership with E.N. Phillips Co. 
of Woodland Hills as a community service and a marketing tool, Trezek said. The 
clinic is between Robinson's and Spoons on the second floor of the mall. 
</P>
<P>
Clinic visitors who may require further treatment will be referred to a 
physician. 
</P>
<P>
The MainPlace clinic is one of eight Testing 1-2-3 centers operated in 
California by the E.N. Phillips Co., a preventive health marketing company. 
</P>
<P>
Clinic hours are 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
Saturday. MARY HELEN BERG

MAN DIES WHEN VAN PLUNGES OFF FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 31-year-old Westminster man was killed early Tuesday when the van he was 
driving went out of control and plunged headlong off Interstate 5, the 
California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
Hoang Quang Tran died instantly in the 8 a.m. crash south of the La Paz Road 
exit, CHP Officer Patti Gentile said. 
</P>
<P>
Tran, who was transporting a load of fruit and produce, was heading south on 
the freeway at an unknown rate of speed when a tire apparently exploded. The 
van then veered sharply to the right, struck an emergency phone call box and 
sped off the freeway, leaving long skid marks, Gentile said. 
</P>
<P>
The van plunged about 150 feet, rolling over as it fell. At one point, the roof 
was peeled back, and the driver was ejected from the van, said CHP Officer 
Keith Ferguson, who investigated the fatal accident. 
</P>
<P>
Tran's body was found on a grassy patch about 6 feet from where the van came to 
rest, Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
No other cars were involved. Gentile said officers stopped traffic briefly 
while they examined the skid marks.

TESTS TO DETERMINE FUEL POLLUTION LEVEL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Residents driving at night next week through the intersection of Newport Avenue 
and Old Irvine Boulevard may notice some unusual activity as officials test for 
contamination by jet fuel. 
</P>
<P>
In June, officials discovered several leaks in a government-owned pipeline that 
carries kerosene-based jet fuel from Norwalk to Marine Corps bases in El Toro 
and Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
The leaks, which had been suspected because pressure in the line had dropped, 
were quickly found and repaired, Air Force Lt. Col. Pharris Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
But officials are not sure how long the fuel was leaking or how much seeped 
into the ground, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
The leaks in the pipe, which is six feet below ground, were apparently caused 
by corrosion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental tests revealed jet fuel in the soil; the round of tests scheduled 
to begin next week will determine the extent. 
</P>
<P>
Workers from Groundwater Technology Inc. in Torrance will drill seven holes -- 
each two inches wide and up to 120 feet deep -- to take soil samples, Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Merryman, the county's environmental health director, said he is not aware 
of a health or safety risk from the fuel. 
</P>
<P>
"But they are doing a site assessment," he said, "and if the jet fuel got into 
the ground water, then it could lead to a lengthy cleanup." 
</P>
<P>
There has been no indication of contamination in ground water pumped in the 
area, said Merryman, who added that ground water at that level is not used for 
drinking water anyway. SHANNON SANDS

POLICE CHIEF FINALIST FOR SCOTTSDALE SPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police Chief John Robertson is one of five finalists for the top police spot in 
Scottsdale, Ariz., city officials there said. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson, 38, who has served on the Garden Grove force for 16 years, was among 
115 people from 27 states who applied. 
</P>
<P>
Scottsdale and Garden Grove each have about 135,000 residents, but the 
similarities end there. Scottsdale is a resort community near Phoenix which 
covers 200 square miles, two-thirds of which is undeveloped, said Scottsdale's 
director of human services, Dan Schmidt. Garden Grove covers less than a tenth 
of that area at 17.8 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt said a new chief would be named by the end of the month to replace the 
retiring chief. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson declined to comment.

SUPERVISORS TO CONSIDER AN EVEN HIGHER JAIL BOOKING FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Confronted by an increasingly bleak budget picture, county supervisors will be 
asked next month to approve a new fee to area cities and school districts -- 
one more than twice as high as an already-proposed fee that has local 
governments in a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
According to a county administrative office report sent to the Board of 
Supervisors on Monday, auditors have determined that the full cost of booking 
an inmate into the County Jail is between $154 and $183. Ronald S. Rubino, the 
county's chief budget officer, said Tuesday that he intends to recommend that 
the board pass on the full cost to cities, though it will be up to the 
supervisors whether they accept, scale back or altogether scuttle the fee. 
</P>
<P>
Either of those figures is sure to fuel complaints from Orange County cities, 
26 of whom sent representatives to a board meeting last month to complain about 
a proposed $75.50 booking fee intended to make up for shortfalls caused by cuts 
in state funding. Even at the lower amount, they said the fee would force 
cities to consider layoffs and cutbacks in local law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County division of the League of Cities has helped coordinate 
response to the proposed fee, and Executive Director Bill Hodge said Tuesday 
that the new proposal will only stiffen opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like carrying gasoline to a fire," he said. "We were talking 
about how many fingers we were going to lose. Now it looks like we may be 
talking about an arm or a leg." 
</P>
<P>
But rising gasoline prices, a deteriorating local economy and salary overruns 
by several county departments have created a bleak budget picture, and 
officials say they have to consider any option that might raise money to keep 
county services running. 
</P>
<P>
"The county budget is extremely tight, and economic conditions warrant caution 
and careful monitoring," County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider wrote in 
his report to the board. He cited rising unemployment and drops in both housing 
sales and non-residential building permits as examples of areas where a slowing 
economy is squeezing the county's projected revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the rising price of gas could cost the county an extra $1.5 million 
in expenses this year. Projected salary overruns, particularly in the Sheriff's 
Department, also total several million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Don R. Roth, chairman of the five-member board, has continually 
reminded his colleagues during the past several weeks of the county's worsening 
economic picture. Roth supports the jail booking fee, but even though the board 
approved it "in principle" several months ago, supervisors could still reject 
it when the matter comes before them again in December. 
</P>
<P>
After representatives of Orange County cities appeared before the board last 
month to complain about the potential impact of the jail booking fee on their 
operations, several board members said they would consider deferring its 
imposition until the next fiscal year, which begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
If the board declines to levy the fee in January, it will leave the county's 
1990-91 budget short by an additional $2.1 million.

MIKE PENNER: RAM FAN WRITES SCENARIO WITH HAPPIEST OF ENDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The best Ram fan I know keeps one of those week-by-week pro football logs 
folded up in his wallet, partly for reference but mainly for reassurance. 
</P>
<P>
That way, the Rams' road to the playoffs is never more than an arm's length 
away. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rams can still make the playoffs," says the best Ram fan I know. "Sure 
they can. In the NFC, they can. Look at the standings. 
</P>
<P>
"The top three teams -- 'Frisco, Chicago and the Giants -- nobody's going to 
catch them. And the Washington Redskins, they look like they're going to get 
one wild card. But after that, look at all the 3-5 teams you've got. Tampa Bay 
is 4-5, but they've played one more game than the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
"It all depends on what the Rams do these next two weeks, if they beat the 
Giants and Dallas. Now I know with the Giants, they've got to play the best 
game they've ever played, and the Giants are going to be ticked off by being 
knocked out of the playoffs by the Rams last year. That's a big 'if.' 
</P>
<P>
"But if the Rams can win these next two, they'll be right in there. Look at the 
rest of the teams, the rest of their schedules. Green Bay. Tampa Bay. New 
Orleans. Atlanta. They've all got it tougher than the Rams. The Rams have got 
to start winning, naturally, but 8-8 in the NFC just might make the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
The best Ram fan I know has been talking this way ever since he attended 
Sunday's game against the Houston Oilers and watched the Rams play their first 
decent day of defense this decade. 
</P>
<P>
His eyes have seen the glory of a Bobby Humphery pass deflection at the goal 
line. 
</P>
<P>
He has been given a reason to believe. 
</P>
<P>
He has been mapping it out. 
</P>
<P>
"If they win nine games, they're in," he tells me. "That means they have to win 
six more games. That means they're going to have to beat 'Frisco once. They can 
do that. Have you seen any of the 49ers' games this year? 
</P>
<P>
"There have been at least five games that they could've lost as well as won. 
Four of them, Joe Montana gets the ball with less than two minutes to play and 
pulls the game out. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody's going to beat them. New Orleans had 'em beat. I still don't know 
why they didn't run the clock out instead of throwing incomplete passes. New 
Orleans had the ball, 'Frisco was out of timeouts, and there were 58 seconds to 
play. All they have to do is run the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"But they throw a pass, it's incomplete, and they punt to 'Frisco with 40-some 
seconds left, Montana hits a couple of out patterns, and they kick a field goal 
with nine seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell you, they had them beat." 
</P>
<P>
I try telling the best Ram fan I know that the 49ers and the Giants are both 
8-0, and that he's asking the Rams to do something no one else has been able to 
do all season. 
</P>
<P>
Precisely. 
</P>
<P>
"If they put it together, they've got a shot to beat the Giants," he says. "I 
don't know the point spread, I'm sure the Giants are favored, but I used to 
play these football cards at work, and I used to pick the Rams every time they 
were underdogs. Eighty-five percent of the time, I won at that. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ram offense is good enough. They can score some points on that defense. 
Two of the last three times they've played, the Rams have scored 31 and 45 
points. The Giants still have a tough defense and Lawrence Taylor -- they've 
got to keep Lawrence Taylor out of there -- but Irv Pankey usually does a good 
job against him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Rams have a shot. If I was in Las Vegas and somebody gave me four 
points, I just might put a buck-fifty on that one." 
</P>
<P>
I have to tell the best Ram fan I know that I still have my doubts. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at it," he says. "The Rams are the home team, the Giants played Monday 
night, they're coming off a short week, and they have to travel down to 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"Several years ago, I read an article that said the team that plays on Monday 
night and then goes on the road loses a lot more than it wins. It was right 
around 70%. So the Rams have a few things going for them." 
</P>
<P>
I don't have the heart to mention that a month ago, Cincinnati played on Monday 
night, traveled to Anaheim and beat the Rams in overtime, 34-31. 
</P>
<P>
The best Ram fan I know doesn't need any reminding. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rams should've won that Cincinnati game," he says with a tinge of disgust. 
"To come back like that and put the game into overtime. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"That really hurt, especially when you look at the trouble Cincinnati's been 
having ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"But Cincinnati's a team you just can't figure out." 
</P>
<P>
The best Ram fan I know didn't become this way overnight. It has taken more 
than 20 years of offsides calls on Tom Mack and blocked Tom Dempsey field goals 
and crazed Dieter Brock passes into Soldier Field snow drifts to forge such 
fiery devotion. 
</P>
<P>
He still can't understand how George Allen's '69 Rams could go 11-0 and then 
not win another, including that Polar Kapp playoff disaster on Minnesota 
tundra. 
</P>
<P>
He still can't understand how the Rams could ever let go of Chuck Knox, "a 
great defensive coach." 
</P>
<P>
He still can't understand why the Rams can't rush the passer. 
</P>
<P>
But he keeps coming back. That's what it means to be a Ram fan, he figures. You 
have to learn to forgive -- and try to forget. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the last year under Malavasi, when they were 2-7, 2-8, I still rooted for 
them," he says. "I went to the Kansas City game that year, and we were walking 
across the parking lot where there were these girls selling bags with L.A. 
LAMBS printed on them. They wanted you to wear them over your head. 
</P>
<P>
"I said I didn't want one but they kept on pushing: 'Go on and have some fun.' 
I told them, 'No way, they're going to win this game.' And they did. It was the 
only home game they won that year." 
</P>
<P>
A little show of faith can sometimes go a long way, says the best Ram fan I 
know. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine?" he says, pointing out a stat he dug up the other day. "In 
1975, the Ram defense allowed 135 points. That's 135 points in a whole season. 
Can you imagine putting that defense with the offense they have now? Wouldn't 
that be something?" 
</P>
<P>
Such are the dreams Ram fans dream. 
</P>
<P>
And with the defense the Rams are stuck with in real life? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I'm looking for 9-7," says the best Ram fan I know. "That's a wild-card 
spot. We'll know a lot more after these next two weeks. But like I said, I 
think they've got a shot."

<P>
Coach John Robinson and cornerback Jerry Gray continue to have differing 
opinions on the state of Gray's left knee. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson says it might be just a matter of confidence, but he held Gray out of 
the Rams' 17-13 victory over Houston Sunday because he felt it was obvious Gray 
"couldn't function" against the Steelers the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sore knee that he's been ineffective playing on," Robinson said. "We 
want to get him back to where he can be the best he can be. With the present 
set of circumstances, he's unable to be effective." 
</P>
<P>
But Gray says he feels fine and is ready to go. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll play this week," he said. "I felt like I could play (Sunday). I did some 
lobbying, but coach felt it was better if I waited." JOHN WEYLER

O.C. MOTORCYCLIST IS PENALIZED FOR FAILING DRUG TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speedway motorcyclist Shawn Moran of Huntington Beach has been stripped of his 
second-place finish in the World Final and suspended for six months for failing 
a drug test, an American Motorcycle Assn. spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Ammick, AMA communications manager, said a random drug test after the 
final in Bradford, England, detected Moran had taken the narcotic 
dextropropoxyphen napsylate before a race. 
</P>
<P>
Moran admitted he bought an over-the-counter painkiller, distalgesic, to help 
alleviate the pain of four broken ribs he suffered in Sweden three weeks before 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
Distalgesic is on the International Olympic Committee's list of banned drugs, 
and the governing body of the World Final, the Federation of International 
Motorcyclists, follows the IOC list. 
</P>
<P>
Moran appeared at the FIM's board meeting in Hungary last week and was notified 
of the loss of place and suspension. He does not plan to appeal the suspension, 
according to his older brother, Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
Moran, who also has a residence in Bradford, England, was unavailable for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the whole thing was handled very well, because Shawn wasn't 
notified until 90 days after the race," Ammick said. "But the drug he was 
taking is banned by the IOC." 
</P>
<P>
Ammick said Moran's place in the World Final would remain vacant, but that the 
FIM board decided not to strip Moran of his gold medal for being a member of 
the winning U.S. team in the World Team Cup in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
"The board felt it shouldn't punish five other riders for a mistake that Shawn 
made," Ammick said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension is the second for Moran during his 11-year career overseas. In 
May, 1989, he was banned from that year's world championship events for racing 
in Korskro, Denmark, while under the influence of alcohol.

ON THE PREP PATH: FOOTBALL PLAYOFF PAIRINGS WON'T PLEASE ALL COACHES ALL THE 
TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBIE LUDOVISE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In just four days, football coaches from around the county will make their 
annual pilgrimage to the Southern Section office in Cerritos to learn their 
fate. Palms will sweat, brows will furrow and teeth will gnash as they 
nervously brace themselves for that dramatic moment when . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Playoff pairings are announced! 
</P>
<P>
 OK, maybe it doesn't match the anticipation of Rocky XXXIII. But playoff 
possibilities are always intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
Heading into the final weekend of the regular season, here's the Who's Who of 
What's What: 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita. Heading into Thursday's game against Warren, Santa Margarita, 
which plays a freelance schedule, is 9-0. The Eagles' schedule was no fruit 
cup, either. They beat Pasadena and Gahr, both Division II teams, and shut out 
four other opponents. 
</P>
<P>
The question: In which playoff division will Santa Margarita be placed? 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the Eagles -- who advanced to the Division IX title game in 1989, their 
first year of varsity play -- might have a better chance in some piddling 
division such as VIII or IX. But they are capable of competing on much higher 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
Division VI is the natural -- four of the five leagues are from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Interesting note for the money-monger set: Large-school divisions bring larger 
gate receipts, so Santa Margarita could benefit financially from taking a big 
leap to the top. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, when you're a $26 million school such as nta Margarita, who's 
worried about those kinds of details? 
</P>
<P>
"As long as we get into the playoffs, we don't care," Athletic Director Rich 
Schaaf said. "We just want to get in." 
</P>
<P>
My guess: Santa Margarita will be placed in Division VI and make it to the 
title game, where the team bus will be picketed by those opposed to parochial 
schools playing in the same division as public schools. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa. Speaking of just getting in, Mustang Coach Tom Baldwin's team 
already has clinched third place in the Pacific Coast League . . . but it's not 
guaranteed a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Coast is in Division VII, which has six leagues instead of the 
usual five, and can guarantee berths only to the top two teams in each. 
</P>
<P>
Unless Costa Mesa beats Trabuco Hills Thursday, the Mustangs will have to hope 
for a wild-card berth. 
</P>
<P>
My guess: Costa Mesa will win but will be denied a wild-card berth nonetheless. 
Wanting revenge, Baldwin will wait for the Division VII title game, rent the 
Goodyear blimp and pour 10 tons of melted marshmallow goo on the stadium during 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park. Buena Park? Yes, the long-time Freeway League cellar-dweller has 
been resurrected into a playoff-bound team by Coach Marty Luczaj. The Coyotes, 
led by running back Angel Barrios, play Thursday at Fullerton for the league's 
No. 2 spot. 
</P>
<P>
My guess: The (Wile E.) Coyotes will win and then, in a public relations move, 
change their nickname to Roadrunners. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei. The Monarchs must beat St. John Bosco Friday to be guaranteed a 
playoff spot. If Mater Dei doesn't make it, the Derek Sparks debate -- Will he 
stay or will he transfer? -- will be back in full swing. 
</P>
<P>
My guess: Monarchs win, Sparks stays, Mater Dei administrators do the 
boogie-woogie. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia. A 23-21 loss to Brea-Olinda Friday stopped the Tigers' Orange League 
winning streak at 17. If Brea beats Western this week, Valencia will fail to 
win the league title for the first time since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
My guess: Valencia Coach Mike Marrujo, famous for downplaying his team's 
chances, will enroll in a joint Dale Carnegie-Dick Vitale seminar and, after 
many hours of practice, learn to shout at his opponents, "We be better than 
you, Baby!" 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana. At 2-3 going into their Sunset League final Thursday against 
Westminster, the Saints are out of playoff contention, but a victory would be 
Coach Dick Hill's 192nd. That would establish him as Orange County's winningest 
football coach. 
</P>
<P>
My guess: Hill gets the victory, the key to the city and a lifetime supply of 
Raisin Bran -- his pregame cereal choice for the past few decades. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar. The Sea Kings have managed some impressive turnarounds -- in 
1989, they entered the playoffs as a wild-card team and won the Division VI 
title -- but with the loss of quarterback Todd Kehrli to a finger injury, the 
odds are stacked higher than a complete collection of Elvis albums. Corona del 
Mar has to beat University Thursday to advance as the Sea View League's No. 3 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
My guess: Elvis will return from the dead and sing a rap version of "Love Me 
Tender" before Corona del Mar wins the Southern Section title this year. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia question: Which four current Orange County high school coaches were 
assistants under Dick Hill when he was at Santa Ana Valley in the 1960s and 
'70s? 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita is one of four undefeated county football teams; the others are 
La Quinta, Esperanza and Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
Their secrets? 
</P>
<P>
At La Quinta, Coach Roger Takahashi -- one of the county's sharpest minds -- 
has a zinger list of plays that keeps the opponents guessing and Aztec fans 
cheering. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza, traditionally known for its mammoth linemen, features a slightly 
smaller, slightly quicker package that has proved even more effective. 
</P>
<P>
And at Tustin, running back Ron Goods and fullback Visko Ancich make up one of 
the best backfield tandems in the county. Goods, a top sprinter, makes cuts 
like a skier in a giant slalom race, and Ancich plays human battering ram. 
</P>
<P>
Which will go the farthest in the playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
Tustin -- the run-and-ram team. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Mike Rush (Mission Viejo), Gary Meek (Esperanza), Tom Baldwin 
(Costa Mesa) and Tom Meiss (Orange).

HE'S TRYING TO GET SOME RESPECT FOR BADMINTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris Jogis, the top badminton player in the United States, can understand why 
many people don't take his sport seriously. Even he once thought badminton was 
a pastime for picnickers -- not skilled athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I was playing, I was an All-American sports fan and I couldn't imagine 
this being a real sport either," Jogis said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was as ignorant to the sport as America is now. But once I saw the sport, I 
was hooked." 
</P>
<P>
The teen-age addiction has become a way of life for Jogis, who will compete in 
the Carlton U.S. Open Badminton Championships today through Sunday at UC 
Irvine's Bren Center. And that means he often has some explaining to do. 
</P>
<P>
Badminton? Outside the United States, it's one of the most popular sports -- 
second only to soccer in worldwide participants, Jogis says. It takes 
quickness, strength and endurance to master the second-fastest racquet sport in 
the world behind jai alai, he continues. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little trying sometimes," Jogis said. "But as a top player, I'm kind of 
a spokesman for the sport. Sometimes I get tired of explaining, but if I want 
the sport to be more well-known, I have to keep doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Jogis hopes the inclusion of badminton in the 1992 Olympic Games will help with 
the sales job. It was an exhibition sport in the 1988 Olympics. Exposure is the 
key, he said. In his experience, no one who sees competitive badminton for the 
first time leaves disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
Jogis, who works with the planning committee for the U.S. Olympic Festival '91, 
which will be held next summer in Los Angeles, invited some of his co-workers 
from the committee to a match at last summer's festival in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
"They were just stunned how exciting and fun it was to watch," Jogis said. 
</P>
<P>
After being introduced to badminton at 13 in his junior high school in Palo 
Alto, Jogis began playing the sport at the club level. Within his first year of 
serious competition, he and partner Benny Lee won a national championship in 
boys' doubles. 
</P>
<P>
Lee was then the best young player in the nation, Jogis said, taking Jogis 
along for the ride. But by the time he was 17, Jogis had caught up and won his 
first national singles title, defeating Lee in the finals of the 18-and-under 
division in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Jogis continued his success at Arizona State, one of the few schools to offer 
badminton scholarships. He won three consecutive national collegiate titles in 
men's singles and he and Lee also won three men's doubles titles. 
</P>
<P>
While at Arizona State, Jogis took a step up and entered his first 
international competition. He won his first-round match at the 1984 Canadian 
Open but lost to a seeded player in the second. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just an honor to play," Jogis said. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from Arizona State in 1987, he joined the international Grand 
Prix tour, hoping to continue improving his game enough to qualify for the 1992 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Life is hard for touring badminton professionals, but it might be worse for 
Jogis, the top-ranked American who ranks about 50th in the world. Badminton is 
a popular spectator sport in Europe and especially Asia, but there is no glory 
and few financial rewards for Jogis, who has only once advanced to the 
quarterfinals on the international tour. 
</P>
<P>
"Within the circuit everybody knows me as the top American," Jogis said. "And 
if anyone cares about America, they may come out and watch but I wouldn't say I 
have any cult group following me anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Olympic Committee puts aside about $200,000 a year to help develop the 
sport in this country and Jogis and a few of the other top Americans are 
sponsored by Carlton Sports Co., a manufacturer of badminton equipment. 
</P>
<P>
But is still difficult for Americans to develop into world-class players, said 
Tariq Wadood, club professional at Manhattan Beach Badminton Club. The pool of 
American players is so small it's difficult to find good players to practice 
against. It's also tough to find places to practice because badminton courts 
are rare. 
</P>
<P>
Jogis moved to Holland last year to find better practice competition and to be 
closer to the many European tournaments. Upon his return to the States, he 
moved to Manhattan Beach, home of the only all-Badminton Club in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
From this base, he is working toward the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. To 
qualify, he will probably have to be the top player in the Pan American zone. 
Jogis said he currently has that ranking, but will be challenged by the 
Canadians. 
</P>
<P>
Badminton Notes 
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's Fung Permadi, who was ranked 12th in the world last year and the 
highest-ranked men's player in the U.S. Open, is the top-seeded player in the 
competition that starts at noon today. . . . The Open's purse is $15,000, the 
minimum prize money for an event on the $1-million Grand Prix tour. . . . 
Denyse Julien of Canada, who is among the top 10 women's players in the world, 
is seeded first in women's singles. No American woman is seeded in the 
tournament.

STATWATCH: SUPERIOR SPEED HELPS HARDAWAY GETAWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It must be a new decade. A receiver from Chatsworth High is leading area City 
Section receivers in touchdowns and total yardage. 
</P>
<P>
Delvon Hardaway burst upon the scene with a school-record 99-yard scoring 
reception against Kennedy four weeks ago, but that is not the reason he is 
averaging 24.0 yards a catch. 
</P>
<P>
"He can run with anybody," Chatsworth Coach Myron Gibford said. 
</P>
<P>
Hardaway (6-foot, 170 pounds) is a three-year starter at cornerback for 
Chatsworth, but not until this season, when Gibford decided to open up the 
Chancellors' conservative offense, did he get a chance to show his offensive 
prowess. Hardaway, who also plays basketball and competes in track, has been 
timed in the 100 meters in 10.8 seconds. He has 22 receptions for 528 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Consider that Chatsworth quarterbacks passed for 567 yards in 1988 and 1989 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
 "If our offense was a little more consistent, his numbers would be unreal," 
Gibford said. 
</P>
<P>
Streaks: Granada Hills faces El Camino Real on Friday in a game that could 
decide the West Valley League title, and history is definitely on the 
Highlanders' side. Granada Hills has won or shared four consecutive league 
titles -- two North Valley League crowns and two in Valley 4-A League play. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders, who moved to the West Valley this season, have won 11 
consecutive Northwest Valley Conference games and 17 of 18 since the conference 
format was instituted in 1988. From the 1986 season on, Granada Hills is 24-1-1 
in league and conference play. The lone league loss came two years ago at San 
Fernando. El Camino Real has not won a league title since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Records: Westlake set four school records in a 41-41 tie with Thousand Oaks on 
Friday. The Warriors set a team record for first downs (25). Todd Preston threw 
his 20th touchdown pass of the season, eclipsing his record of 19 set last 
season, and he increased his passing-yardage total to 2,055, which breaks his 
1989 record of 2,014. 
</P>
<P>
Seamus Gibbons, the school's all-time leading receiver, broke the single-season 
record of 40 receptions set by Luke Crawford last season. Gibbons, who made 
seven catches against Thousand Oaks, has 45. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo junior Tag Johnson gained a school-record 238 yards in 14 carries and 
the Scorpions rushed for a school-record 469 yards in a 28-24 win over Agoura. 
Johnson, a fullback in the Scorpions' wishbone formation, had rushed for only 
268 yards entering the contest. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi quarterback Cody Smith, (28 of 39 attempts for 380 yards against St. 
Paul) set school records for completions and passing yardage in a game. Dan 
Laufenberg, brother of longtime NFL quarter back Babe Laufenberg, completed 26 
passes in 1974, and Pat Crawley passed for 295 yards in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's favorite target this year, wide receiver Ryan Kieling, also set a mark 
for receiving yardage. Kieling caught 14 passes for 202 yards, one yard more 
than Mike Steele's total in 1970.

Hart kicker Brady Vilensky tied a school record with eight point-after 
conversions against San Gabriel. The senior, who has converted 38 consecutive 
PATs and three of four field-goal attempts this season, set the record last 
year in the Indians' win over Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
Rushing: Ventura's offensive line could open enough holes for two running backs 
to rush for 1,000 yards for the first time in school history. Senior Jack 
Hammond has 1,002 yards and sophomore Derek Swafford has 800. The Cougars lead 
area teams with 2,558 rushing yards and 3,473 total yards.

Defense: Thousand Oaks sacked Preston three times Friday. Preston had been 
sacked twice all season. . . . Poly has picked off 15 passes this season -- 
more than any other area team.

QINTEX COASTAL LAND FACING FORCLOSURE;

REAL ESTATE: AUCTION OF MONARCH BEACH PROPERTY POSTPONED. IT MAY BE SOLD TO A

<TEXT>
<P>
A 232-acre swath of seaside land owned by Qintex, the troubled Australian 
entertainment and resort company, is facing foreclosure by its creditors. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarch Beach property, one of the last large undeveloped coastal 
properties in Orange County, was scheduled for public auction today. But the 
forced sale was postponed pending negotiations between Qintex and its 
creditors. 
</P>
<P>
A source close to the talks said that a sale of the land, possibly to one of 
the creditors, could come within two weeks. Qintex had planned to develop the 
property into a luxury resort-hotel complex. 
</P>
<P>
One group of creditors includes the former owners of the land, Dana Point 
developers Stein-Brief Group and Hawaiian hotel developer Hemmeter Development 
Corp. Stein-Brief and Hemmeter bought the land for $32 million in 1987 and sold 
it to Qintex for $132 million last year. As holders of a first mortgage, they 
are to be paid off first in the event of a sale. 
</P>
<P>
The second group of creditors consists of Japanese and Australian banks and 
Nippon Shinpan, a Japanese credit card company. This group holds a second 
mortgage and stands in line behind the first group of creditors to be repaid. 
They lent Qintex the money to buy the land from Stein-Brief and Hemmeter. 
</P>
<P>
Nippon Shinpan and Mitsui &amp; Co., a huge Japanese trading concern, already 
own half of Qintex's three other resorts and have an option to purchase half 
the Dana Point resort. It is thought these companies, which couldn't be reached 
for comment, may be interested in buying the entire Dana Point parcel and 
building their own resort on it. 
</P>
<P>
The land already has all government permits to build a big, 800-room resort 
hotel and a smaller hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Qintex told the Dana Point City Council this week that it wants to 
build only the smaller hotel and instead build condominiums on the site. That 
is not likely to sit well with a council that wants the sales tax revenue from 
a big hotel, say city officials. And it's not likely to sit well with local 
residents, who fear the condominiums will add to the traffic on local streets. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex officials declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
The only other large, undeveloped piece of land on the coast in Dana Point -- 
the Headlands -- is also up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Qintex had an option to buy that property but lost it when the resort and 
television company became overextended last year. At the time the owners asked 
about $120 million. Now that the property is back on the market, however, the 
asking price ranges as high as $212 million. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the sprawling Qintex corporate structure is in receivership in 
Australia and is being slowly dismembered as assets are sold. 
</P>
<P>
The entity that owns the Dana Point land, however, is not in receivership, 
according to the Australian receiver appointed to oversee the dismantling of 
the parent company.

ACCOUNTANT PLEADS GUILTY TO CONSPIRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Pacific Palisades accountant pleaded guilty Tuesday in U.S. District Court in 
Los Angeles to one count of conspiracy in connection with a fraudulent loan 
transaction that regulators claim contributed to the collapse of Consolidated 
Savings Bank in Irvine in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Phil G. Gilbert, 34, was accused of conspiring with Consolidated Savings to 
disguise a $9.5-million loan to a Texas limited partnership in which the 
thrift's chairman was a shareholder. Gilbert faces up to five years in prison 
and a $250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Consolidated made the loan to CB Financial Corp., an Oklahoma City company in 
which Gilbert was an executive vice president, and the money was then sent to 
the Forest Ridge Partnership of Texas. The money has never been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
The loan would have been a violation of federal thrift regulations had it been 
made directly to Forest because Consolidated owner Robert A. Ferrante was a 
Forest shareholder and the partnership was a major Consolidated borrower. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law prohibits financial institutions from making certain large loans to 
company insiders. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors said the loan was funneled through a third party -- CB 
Financial -- in an attempt to conceal the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
"To circumvent the regulations, they funneled the money through a straw 
borrower," Assistant U.S. Atty. Gregory Schetina said. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert is the third person to be charged with criminal activity in connection 
with Consolidated's failure. He is scheduled to be sentenced Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
In August, a Glendale real estate appraiser pleaded guilty to conspiracy for 
having prepared a phony appraisal that enabled Consolidated to conceal a 
fraudulent $500,000 real estate loan. 
</P>

Advanced Logic Research Inc. said Tuesday that it plans to introduce a 
"dual-processor" personal computer intended to compete with a product 
introduced last year by Houston-based Compaq Computer Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine company said its Powerpro model, based on Intel Corp.'s i486 
microprocessor, can operate the same software developed for the Compaq 
Systempro personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
ALR's new machine will range in price from $7,500 to $25,000, depending on 
storage capacity and other options, said Dave Kirkey, vice president of 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
The Powerpro machine is designed with more than one microprocessor -- the 
central brain of a computer -- to increase its speed and performance.

TV'S 'NEW' REVIEWS OF MACDONALD;

<P>
THE CELEBRATED 'FATAL VISION' MURDER CASE IS REHASHED BY ABC AND NBC. HARVARD 
LAW PROFESSOR ALAN DERSHOWITZ HAS MUCH TO DO WITH THE RENEWAL OF INTEREST. 
</P>

<P>
The case of Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald continues to exert a tenacious hold on the 
American media, particularly television. When Barbara Walters observed recently 
on ABC's "20/20" that the Green Beret, convicted of the 1970 bludgeoning deaths 
of his pregnant wife and two small children, "has fascinated us for years and 
years," she was not exaggerating. 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald, a former Huntington Beach resident now serving three consecutive 
life sentences at Terminal Island federal penitentiary, was the subject of 
another report -- this one on NBC's Nightly News -- earlier the same night, as 
well as a localized rehash of the lengthy "20/20" report on KABC later. The 
case was profiled on CBS's "60 Minutes," on a syndicated documentary and in a 
top-rated and rebroadcast NBC miniseries based on Joe McGinniss' bestseller, 
"Fatal Vision." 
</P>
<P>
An independent production company, Paragon, has announced plans for yet another 
miniseries, this one to raise questions about MacDonald's guilt, using some of 
the same material presented by "20/20" and NBC. 
</P>
<P>
A motion for a new trial was filed in North Carolina on the day of the ABC and 
NBC reports, citing notes from a federal investigator that synthetic blond 
hairs were found at the murder scene in Ft. Bragg, N.C., information that the 
defense says was not made available at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
But what is really "new" about the MacDonald case is not the evidence. Much of 
what this is about, I suspect, is a recent entry from yet another medium. 
Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, riding a crest of celluloid celebrity 
resulting from his portrayal in "Reversal of Fortune," is now representing 
MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
Defending another haughty, arrogant husband, this one convicted of killing his 
wife, may seem like a tempting challenge after his success with Claus von 
Bulow. With his customary hyperbole, Dershowitz said on the ABC report that 
MacDonald may be "one of the most victimized men in American legal history." 
</P>
<P>
Alan Dershowitz is a very good lawyer and "Reversal of Fortune" is a very good 
movie, albeit one that borders on hagiography. But don't count on any reversal 
-- in court or on the screen -- in this case. 
</P>
<P>
The McGinniss book, written with MacDonald's cooperation, led to an infamous, 
on-camera juxtaposition on "60 Minutes," wherein a stunned MacDonald first 
learned of McGinniss' conclusion: that he was guilty of killing his family, 
most likely as a result of a sleep-deprived, drug-induced psychotic episode. 
</P>
<P>
Highly publicized civil litigation followed in Los Angeles between the two men 
-- settled out of court -- which in turn led to a series of articles in the New 
Yorker magazine by Janet Malcolm. Malcolm, who is involved in unrelated 
litigation regarding her own reporting, spun the denunciation of McGinniss into 
a blanket indictment of the journalistic profession, alleging that McGinniss 
seduced and abandoned MacDonald, whom she described favorably. McGinniss 
replied to Malcolm's series in an epilogue to a new edition of "Fatal Vision" 
and in a cover story in the Columbia Journalism Review. 
</P>
<P>
I've been following and covering the MacDonald case for nearly 20 years. I 
lived in North Carolina at the time of the killings and covered the 1979 murder 
trial in Raleigh -- and subsequent appeals -- for publications including the 
New York Times and the Boston Globe. A curious thing I have noticed is the 
difference in coastal perspectives: In general, people on the East Coast seem 
to have accepted the jury's findings, while many on the West Coast have not. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters in the West first came to know MacDonald in his pre-conviction 
incarnation as a charming, dedicated emergency room surgeon at St. Mary Medical 
Center in Long Beach and friend of local police in Huntington Beach, where he 
moved to a waterside condo after the Army initially decided not to try him. The 
reason it may have been so difficult for them to accept Jeffrey MacDonald as a 
killer is simple: He is a handsome, white, middle-class doctor and Princeton 
graduate, not the sort of person we customarily associate with homicide. 
</P>
<P>
It was during this period that McGinniss, an Easterner working as a guest 
columnist for the Los Angeles Herald Examiner, met MacDonald and came to 
question his guilt. This doubt, voiced in a column, led to a meeting with 
MacDonald and the book deal. 
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks to the jury, Assistant U.S. Atty. James Blackburn 
addressed the difficult point of reconciling the image of Jeffrey MacDonald, 
and his otherwise-clean record, with the horrific act he was accused of 
committing, a dilemma that reverberates today. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, though, under cross-examination, those in the courtroom saw a 
very different Jeffrey MacDonald, a cold, sinister, almost menacing presence. 
What became clear during the courtroom questioning was that he was a braggart, 
a liar and a womanizer, a classic Nietzschean tough guy. None of these is an 
indictable offense, certainly, but they did provide the jury with insight into 
MacDonald's character and credibility. 
</P>
<P>
This was difficult to report in a daily newspaper -- because some of it is 
subjective observation and the rest appeared in bits and pieces of testimony -- 
and almost impossible to convey on television at the time. The single exception 
was Gary Cole's chilling portrayal of the doctor in "Fatal Vision." 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald, who still offers a telegenic presence and continues to cut a 
sympathetic figure, shrewdly zeroed in on the miniseries (and the novelistic 
but well-documented book) as his greatest enemy. "I am not that monster" on the 
screen, he told "20/20" correspondent Stone Phillips. "I can never overcome 
'Fatal Vision.' " 
</P>
<P>
But maybe he can. MacDonald's accusers and prosecutors decided not to help 
retry the case on television for NBC and ABC and refused to appear, leaving him 
pretty much of a clear field. For those of you who came in late and are left 
wondering by these new reports, however, let me offer some perspective. 
</P>
<P>
The material presented last week, purporting to offer "new evidence" favorable 
to MacDonald, was very little of the sort. Both broadcasts focused on the 
testimony of a now-dead witness who had confessed, altered and retracted 
versions of her involvement before the trial. 
</P>
<P>
After listening to her testimony with the jury out of the room, U.S. District 
Judge Franklin Dupree found that since no evidence connected her with the 
murder scene, the jury would not hear what she had to say. But it was clear to 
most in the courtroom that she was so addled by drugs and inconsistent that she 
was barely coherent, much less credible -- something not at all clear from the 
edited interviews aired on the two networks. Most of the other living witnesses 
featured on the television reports testified during the trial, and the jury was 
evidently not persuaded. 
</P>
<P>
The jury, the trial judge and appellate judges who sifted through the 
overwhelming mass of physical evidence knew what they were doing when they 
found Jeffrey MacDonald guilty of murder. And if they were right, he is also 
guilty of concocting a story that pandered to prejudices rampant in North 
Carolina. At the time of the slayings, MacDonald was a clean-cut, gung-ho young 
soldier who strongly supported the Vietnam War. Ever the law-and-order 
advocate, he cynically alleged that the brutal killings were the work of a 
drug-using, longhaired, multiracial band -- touching all the hot buttons. As a 
result, in the days after the killings, many crash pads and "hippie houses" 
around the state were rousted by law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Dershowitz's protests about "Reversal of Fortune," that he is not a 
"hired gun" -- and his ongoing concern with two poor, black clients on Death 
Row -- that is essentially what he is. With Jeffrey MacDonald, he is faced with 
a situation similar to that of Claus von Bulow, and he must take the same 
approach he outlines to his skeptical law students in the film. That is, in 
order to safeguard his image as a defender of civil liberties, he not only 
needs to prove some technical or procedural flaws to an appellate court, he 
must demonstrate to the public at large -- now convinced that his client is 
guilty -- that his client is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
Even as skilled and convincing an advocate (and as tireless a self-promoter) as 
Dershowitz will have a tough time with MacDonald on this score.

TOM MCGILLEN BRINGS HIS WIT TO THE LAFF STOP;

<P>
COMEDY: THE COMIC'S SLICES OF LIFE RANGE FROM THE CARY GRANT VOICE PICKING UP 
'THE PROBLEM GIRL' IN A BAR TO THE 'GODZILLA' ROUTINE, HIS GRAND CLOSING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In Tom McGillen's impression-filled act, the Detroit-born comedian takes on the 
role of a macho-stud who tries to pick up a beautiful young woman sitting at a 
bar. Assuming a suave, Cary Grant voice, he approaches the woman and says, "I 
think you're beautiful . . . can I buy you a drink?" 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, why not? I'm celebrating," the woman responds in a less-than-flattering, 
street-wise tone. "I just got divorced and my ex-husband -- he's crazy. He's a 
biker . . . ." From there, she proceeds to run through a laundry list of 
personal problems: She can't pay her rent, her mother's got phlebitis, but they 
can't pay the doctor because the insurance company hasn't paid off on her 
accident yet. . . . 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the uninterrupted recitation, the once suave "Cary Grant" is 
reduced to a shrunken kid who sounds just like Beaver Cleaver: "Well, gee lady, 
sorry life's so creepy for ya." 
</P>
<P>
For McGillen fans, "the problem girl" routine has become something of a cult 
classic. 
</P>
<P>
It's one of several memorable routines the rubber-faced comedian will be doing 
at the Laff Stop in Newport Beach today through Sunday. He's headlining a bill 
that includes Fred Charles. 
</P>
<P>
McGillen, whose TV credits include "Evening at the Improv," "Comic Strip Live" 
and "Showtime's Comedy Club Network," weaves a host of voices and characters 
into his act -- everyone from Don Knotts and Katherine Hepburn (doing a U2 
song) to blacks and Australians may crop up. 
</P>
<P>
"My comedy is basically people oriented," McGillen explained in a phone 
interview from Atlanta. "I observe the public and media and I imitate it. My 
influences are people like Peter Sellers and Lily Tomlin. Instead of doing 
jokes about my dad, I do my dad. My dad doing jokes, actually." 
</P>
<P>
As he says in his act: "My dad's been a dentist since dentists were barbers. . 
. . And remember: Four out of five dentists recommend sugarless gum for their 
patients. Who's the fifth dentist? He's my old man." 
</P>
<P>
Taking on his father's voice: "Go ahead, chew all the sugar junk you want. 
You'll pay for my yacht." 
</P>
<P>
The one-time Chrysler assembly-line worker and former water-bed salesman quit 
his day job as a receiving supervisor for a hardware firm in 1982 to become a 
stand-up comedian. 
</P>
<P>
In writing his own act, McGillen is particularly mindful of staying away from 
overdone topics. "If I hear another 7-Eleven bit or beating-your-kids-in-K-mart 
bit or condom joke I'm going to call the 911 comedy police," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Following the advice of one reviewer who noted that "Star Trek" takeoffs had 
become nearly as common as 7-Eleven jokes, McGillen even dropped his own 
popular -- and some say the best of the bunch -- "Star Trek" routine two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
People still ask to see the bit, he said, "but I say, 'I'm sorry, I have to 
move on.' " 
</P>
<P>
The one bit McGillen refuses to drop is his takeoff on "Godzilla," although 
several other comedians do Japanese movie spoofs in which the characters' 
mouths do not sync with the dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
The routine is not only the "grand closing" for his act, McGillen said, "but it 
was my very first bit," one he started doing for friends at parties when he was 
13. 
</P>
<P>
The triple-character routine includes "Dr. Yamoto," for which McGillen dons 
thick, horn-rimmed glasses and comical false teeth made by his dad, the 
dentist, 30 years ago. (Although some may criticize it for being racially 
offensive, McGillen maintains that he is simply spoofing a movie genre.) 
</P>
<P>
When McGillen first started doing the bit on stage, it was 15 minutes long. 
He's now honed it down to a tight 4 1/2 minutes. "That shows how you start 
whittling the garbage out of your act," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever length, the highly visual routine has always gone over big: "I used to 
do that bit in the first five minutes of my act, and I couldn't follow myself." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tom McGillen and Fred Charles open at the Laff Stop, 2122 S.E. Bristol St., 
Newport Beach. Show time today: 8:30 p.m. Tickets: $7. Through Sunday. 
Information: (714) 852-8762.

MCINNES ENJOYS A RARE CAREER AS VIOLA SOLOIST; 
</P>
<P>
THE VIOLIST, WHO HAS RETURNED TO USC, HIS ALMA MATER, SAYS TEACHING IS HIS 
GREATEST JOY. HE PERFORMS TONIGHT IN COSTA MESA.

The viola plays an important role in an orchestra or string quartet as the 
middle voice between the violin and cello. But it's usefulness as a solo 
instrument is less frequent. 
</P>
<P>
That violist Donald McInnes has built a long and distinguished career as a 
soloist is a remarkable and rare feat. Today, he enjoys the reputation as one 
of America's top viola soloists. 
</P>
<P>
"I originally thought that I'd be happy finding a teaching position at a small 
but good school where I could give a couple of concerts a year," McInnes, 51, 
admitted in an interview from his comfortable home in Alhambra. "As it turned 
out, I still teach, but my career as a soloist surpassed anything I could ever 
anticipate." 
</P>
<P>
Tonight at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, he performs the Bartok 
Viola Concerto with the Pacific Symphony under the baton of Carl St. Clair. 
Also on the recently revised program is the Overture to Rossini's "La gazza 
ladra," excerpts from Bernstein's "Arias and Barcarolles" and Tchaikovsky's 
Symphony No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
McInnes feels a certain closeness with the Bartok Concerto because it was 
commissioned by his teacher, William Primrose. 
</P>
<P>
Memories of another teacher, Stefan Krayk, also continue to influence him. 
</P>
<P>
"It was from Krayk that I acquired my basic musical tastes," he claimed. "There 
are realms of what a performer knows is acceptable to the listener, and if you 
go beyond that, it becomes distasteful." 
</P>
<P>
In 1966 McInnes graduated from USC, not realizing that he would become one of 
the most active viola soloists in the world. He vividly remembers the first 
time his career appeared to be growing in a direction he didn't realize was 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
"The first event that really changed my career was when I was invited by Rudolf 
Serkin to participate in the Marlboro Festival in 1970-71," he said. "The 
second was also in 1971 when I was awarded the Ford Foundation Grant." 
</P>
<P>
Of the $10,000 stipend McInnes received, half was supposed to go to a composer 
of McInnes' choice as a commission to write a new piece for viola. The composer 
McInnes chose was William Schuman, and his Viola Concerto on English Rounds 
went on to become a mainstay of viola repertory. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought long and hard about what composer I should choose," he remembered. 
"I came up with Schuman because he passed three criteria: I wanted a composer I 
liked, one who needed the work and one whose name would help my career as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
After the Schuman Concerto was recorded with Leonard Bernstein, McInnes' career 
took off. But after being in demand all over the world and touring extensively, 
he realized that teaching gives him the most joy. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy academia and working with bright kids because you learn from them and 
are constantly challenged by them," he said. "It makes you really rethink your 
own art." 
</P>
<P>
After teaching at the University of Seattle and the University of Michigan, he 
returned in 1985 to his alma mater, USC, where he still teaches. 
</P>
<P>
"In the original USC string department, there was Jasha Heifetz for violin, 
Gregor Piatagorsky for cello and Primrose on viola," he said. "We have 
graduates active in orchestras all over the world." 
</P>
<P>
But burn-out may be taking its toll with McInnes. He admits that his busy days 
touring the world were fun, but now he wants to relax and spend more time with 
his students. 
</P>
<P>
"I love to be at home," he admitted. "I have enjoyed touring and performing 
throughout my life, but now I'd like to spend some more time relaxing and 
teaching." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Violist Donald McInnes joins conductor Carl St. Clair and the Pacific Symphony 
in music of Bartok, Bernstein, Rossini and Tchaikovsky at 8 p.m. at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $10 
to $33. Also Thursday. Information: (714) 556-2787.

SILVERSMITHS STRIVE TO LEAVE MARK IN MORE THAN METAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA VAN TUYL, CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
To be a silversmith may strike the average person as an anachronism in this age 
of high-tech widget-making. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a small band of contemporary silversmiths across the country 
diligently hammering away in their workshops, using many of the same 
painstaking techniques that Paul Revere did. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is, the handmade wares get lost in a market flooded with 
mass-produced sterling -- and the buying public doesn't realize what it's 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
That's what irks Jeffrey Herman, a Rhode Island silversmith who is standing up 
for his fellow artisans, most of whom are too wrapped up in their work to 
adequately publicize it beyond the collectors and designers who often 
commission it. 
</P>
<P>
To educate people about handmade silver and the range of forms it assumes, 
Herman has joined forces with the 93-year-old Society of Arts and Crafts in 
presenting "Reflections of the Past and Present: Contemporary American Silver," 
an exhibition of hand-wrought holloware and flatware that throws a spotlight on 
a dying art form. 
</P>
<P>
The show assembles for the first time the work of 29 modern silversmiths who 
produce everything from traditional punch bowls to abstract sculpture. They've 
come together as the Society of American Silversmiths (SAS) -- the first 
organization of its kind, Herman says. A total of 48 silversmiths belong to the 
group, founded last year by Herman himself. 
</P>
<P>
Many of today's most talented silversmiths aren't even listed in contemporary 
arts and crafts books. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why a lot have agreed to join the society -- just to leave their mark 
somewhere," Herman says. 
</P>
<P>
Gleaming in their cases are clever candleholders, traditional gravy boats, zany 
teapots, ceremonial chalices, flasks and flower vases, and stunning hollow 
forms serving no purpose other than to intrigue the viewer. Price tags on the 
items are likewise varied, from $250 to $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going back to our roots, bringing us full circle," says Stephanie 
Ehret, director of the Society of Arts and Crafts' Arch Street gallery, where 
the works are on display through Friday. In the early 20th Century, the Society 
of Arts and Crafts exhibited the works of silversmith masters such as Arthur 
Stone, George Gebelein, and Porter Blanchard, when silver was a major force in 
the U.S. arts and crafts movement. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, less than 5% of silver production is done by independent 
silversmiths, says Michael Brophy, who has several pieces in the show. In his 
Watertown, Mass., studio he fashions clocks, boxes, and bowls using hundreds of 
rare and expensive tools filling the shelves. Though many of his items are 
strikingly modern, he uses traditional techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"Most silversmiths today are machine operators and assemblers," Brophy says, 
referring to Gorham and other large companies. Brophy studied in England, where 
the age-old skills of silversmithing are highly valued. Whenever machines are 
used, he says, "you have to compromise and cut down on the details."

Most people looking for a wedding gift or anniversary present think that the 
sterling they see in jewelry or department stores is all that's available, 
Herman says. 
</P>
<P>
"You won't see a huge variety of one-of-a-kind pieces there," he says. "If any 
jeweler wants to stay in business, he has to sell things that have mass 
appeal." 
</P>
<P>
But a handmade sugar bowl or objet d'art, in addition to being unique, is more 
likely to maintain or increase its value over time, says Herman, who 
specializes in silver repair and restoration at his home in Cranston, R.I. "It 
has a look that generally shows more caring and extra effort." 
</P>
<P>
In "The Orator," featured in the show, master Heikki Seppa has fashioned 
sterling into a dramatic one-foot-high teardrop shape. On such a large piece, 
with its brilliant chrome-bumper surface, it is difficult to hide one's 
mistakes, Herman says. 
</P>
<P>
Though women were historically denied training as silversmiths, seven of the 48 
SAS members are women, including 35-year-old Susan Ewing, who has her own shop 
and teaches at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a 20th-Century silversmith going into the 21st Century," Ewing says. Her 
two fanciful teapots, with their striped angular handles and polka dots add wit 
and playfulness to the show. "What you see in the stores are mostly 18th- and 
19th-Century designs," she adds. "They sell to popular tastes, which are still 
pretty far behind where modern design is." 
</P>
<P>
She does some sculpturing in copper and brass, but silver has special 
qualities. "I like the coolness of it -- the hard edge you can get which is 
similar to steel -- yet you can also create great warmth through surface 
treatments." 
</P>
<P>
Though there is stylistic variety in the field of silversmithing, Herman is 
worried that the fine techniques of the trade will soon be lost. The median age 
of SAS members is 50, and not enough design schools are equipped to teach the 
necessary skills, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it has to do with our culture," Ewing adds. "Silver is one of the 
most tedious mediums you can work in. You either have the discipline or you 
don't." The founding of the Society of American Silversmiths, she says, meets 
the need for artisans to communicate with one another. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a heritage I'd like to see saved," Herman says. "The Japanese have their 
national treasures -- their sword-makers, silversmiths, people who work in 
clay. They're revered, and you can't go above their standard. Why can't we have 
that?"

4 KILLED, 2 HURT WHEN TRAINS CRASH IN CORONA

Four railway crew members were killed and two others were injured this morning 
when two freight trains collided before dawn, igniting a brief, spectacular 
inferno, according to authorities and eyewitnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Michael A. Martin, a spokesman for the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway 
Co., declined to immediately identify the dead, pending notification of their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
The deaths occurred about 4:10 a.m. when a Chicago-bound freight train collided 
with another headed from Barstow to Los Angeles, according to Martin. The 
entire crew of the westbound train -- an engineer, a conductor and a brakeman 
-- died. On the eastbound train, the brakeman was killed, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
The two crew members of the eastbound train who survived were taken to area 
hospitals with injuries that Martin described as less than life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
James Dawson, 50, was in fair condition with a fractured knee and head 
lacerations at Riverside General Hospital, nursing supervisor Jane Dolan said. 
Warren Sanders, whose age was not disclosed immediately, was in good condition 
with a fractured ankle at Corona Community Hospital, according to nursing 
supervisor Kathy Stephens. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, the railway spokesman, said the cause of the accident was under 
investigation. Four locomotives and at least six freight cars derailed. Both 
trains were operated by the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe company. 
</P>
<P>
For reasons that Martin said were not yet known, the westbound train, weighing 
8,700 tons and stretching 6,094 feet long, apparently moved forward from a side 
track, its lead locomotive striking the eastbound train near the front of its 
second engine. 
</P>
<P>
The eastbound train, which Martin estimated was traveling up to 65 m.p.h., had 
three locomotives, weighed 3,152 tons, was 4,229 feet long and was composed of 
box cars, tank cars, hopper cars and empty automobile carriers.

SECURITY GUARD HELD IN UNIVERSAL STUDIOS FIRE 
</P>

<P>
A security guard who has worked at Universal Studios less than two months was 
arrested on suspicion of arson this morning in connection with the blaze that 
swept through the Universal Studios' back lot, destroying movie sets and 
causing millions of dollars in damage, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael J. Huston, 40, of Tujunga was booked at the sheriff's West Hollywood 
station for structure arson, spokeswoman Deputy Britta Rodela said. 
</P>
<P>
Huston was arrested about 4 a.m. today "based partially on statements he made" 
to arson investigators, Rodela said. Investigators have not determined the 
exact cause of the blaze, nor have damage estimates been tallied. 
</P>
<P>
Universal Studios officials said early this morning that the fire destroyed or 
damaged 20% of the 420-acre complex's lot, but they said damage to the studio 
tour attractions -- such as the King Kong exhibit -- was less than originally 
believed. 
</P>
<P>
"Kong lives," said Ron Bension, president of Universal Studios-Hollywood. He 
said the fire damaged the exterior of the building where the giant ape 
attraction is housed, but the computers and the mechanical creature were not 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Bension said the damage was centered in the outdoor sets, such as the 
two-block-long New York Street, where such productions as "The Sting," "Dick 
Tracy" and "Kojak" were filmed. Bension said it appeared that the fire started 
on New York Street, but Fire Department officials said that has not been 
confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in pretty good shape," Bension said. "It was pretty scary, but we are 
fairly relieved." 
</P>
<P>
The fire did nothing to deter tourists today. Leaving promptly at 9:30 a.m., 
trams full of visitors rolled around smoldering remains of sets from such 
popular films as "The Sting," "To Kill a Mockingbird" and the "Back to the 
Future" series. 
</P>
<P>
"The show must go on. The show will go on," said one tour driver who gave his 
name only as Larry. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to show you all of our back lot; only a small portion was actually 
damaged." 
</P>
<P>
The only main attraction not operating today was the King Kong exhibit, but 
studio officials said it should be open in a matter of days. 
</P>
<P>
Some visitors said the fire gave the tour, the third most popular theme park in 
the nation, added appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"It encouraged us to come," said Carolyn Garrahan of Cape Cod., Mass., who took 
the tour with her husband, Tom. "We wanted to see the damage. We wanted to see 
what's left of the place." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Bridge, who traveled with his family of four from western Australia, came 
to Universal City especially for the studio tour. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw all the smoke last night," he said. "It was a great show. Much better 
than the elections." 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Dale Underwood of the Sheriff's Department arson unit said Huston was on 
duty when the fire ignited on the back lot. During a routine interview by 
investigators, Huston made statements that "obviously" raised suspicions, 
Underwood said, refusing to disclose a possible motive. 
</P>
<P>
Huston was being held in lieu of $1-million bail.

A panel of scientists today began reviewing Utah's National Cold Fusion 
Institute, with a member saying their study of the controversial research would 
be open and objective. 
</P>
<P>
As the meeting got under way, electrochemist B. Stanley Pons -- who along with 
British colleague Martin Fleischmann claims to have produced nuclear fusion in 
room-temperature experiments -- ducked from television cameras after being 
spotted sitting in the back row. 
</P>
<P>
All the meetings are closed. A sign posted outside the door of the meeting room 
states: "It is required that only those persons who have signed a National Cold 
Fusion Institute confidentiality agreement attend this review." 
</P>
<P>
Last year's claim by Pons and Fleischmann that they had created energy through 
so-called "cold fusion" created a sensation in the scientific world. But 
controversy erupted when many other scientists said they could not duplicate 
the Utah scientists' findings.

ANTI-ARAB VIOLENCE ERUPTS AT KAHANE FUNERAL MARCH

A raucous funeral procession for militant Rabbi Meir Kahane turned violent 
today when hundreds of people broke away from the march to smash shop windows, 
beat Arabs and stone police. 
</P>
<P>
In a shopping district near the central bus station in Jewish west Jerusalem, 
Kahane supporters moved from shop to shop, asking owners whether they employed 
Arabs before smashing windows. 
</P>
<P>
A terrified Arab ran down the street, followed by several Kahane loyalists 
shouting, "Death to terrorists!" Police reported some Palestinians were hurt in 
scattered attacks along the procession's route. 
</P>
<P>
One Arab was beaten to the ground near the cemetery in Givat Shaul, and a 
passing Israeli and two soldiers tried to help him. When he appeared to revive, 
members of Kahane's Kach movement tried to block an ambulance from arriving. 
Police reports said one policeman was injured in the melee. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere along the procession route, hundreds stoned a television building, 
and a mounted policeman trying to disperse the rioters was hit by a stone and 
fell off his horse, Israel radio said. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of police reinforcements had been deployed to prevent violence between 
Kahane's followers and Arabs during the funeral procession by 18,000 people, 
but authorities did not interfere during the window-breaking rampage. 
</P>
<P>
The main procession of men in yellow Kach T-shirts and ultra-Orthodox Jews in 
black coats moved through downtown Jerusalem. Organizers with megaphones led 
chants of "Death to the Arabs!" and "Death to Arafat!" the PLO leader. Vans 
carrying yellow Kach flags led the marchers. 
</P>
<P>
During the earlier memorial service, one Kach activist vowed to avenge the 
slaying of Kahane, who was fatally shot after a speech at a Manhattan hotel on 
Monday night. Police believe an Egyptian-born maintenance worker acted alone in 
the shooting.

DEMOCRATS CELEBRATE ELECTION GAINS

<TEXT>
<P>
Democrats today celebrated their gains in Congress and the takeover of 
governors' offices in two high-growth Sun Belt states. They swiftly proclaimed 
that the midterm election results show that "George Bush is extraordinarily 
vulnerable in 1992." 
</P>
<P>
But Republicans also had victories to hold up, including the biggest prize of 
all as Pete Wilson kept the California governorship in GOP hands. The 
President's party also made inroads in the Northeast and industrial Midwest, 
electing governors in Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Minnesota and Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
In an election framed by fear of recession and war, by unhappiness with taxes 
and politicians, governors of both parties took a beating. That wasn't true in 
the House and Senate, where most incumbents won and where the 102nd Congress 
will look a lot like the late, unlamented 101st. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a lot to smile about," said Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown 
as he surveyed the midterm returns on CBS' "This Morning." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush spent the morning in the Oval Office and offered no comment. But 
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said "all in all, it looks like a pretty 
standard off-year election. . . . You win some and you lose some." 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats cited the poor showing of candidates for whom Bush campaigned. 
Brown said the President "campaigned heavily for 18 candidates, and 14 of them 
lost." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why the Democrats lost the California governor's race, Brown said: 
"George Bush didn't stay long enough." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 32 senators who sought reelection, 31 won easily. Only Republican Sen. 
Rudy Boschwitz lost -- to liberal college Prof. Paul Wellstone. 
</P>
<P>
In the House, the reelection rate for incumbents was 96%. 
</P>
<P>
With several House races still to be decided, the likely outcome would give the 
Democrats a 268-167 majority, a gain of nine seats -- including Vermont 
socialist Bernard Sanders, who is expected to side with the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
John Engler of Michigan and Arne Carlson of Minnesota brightened the morning 
after Election Day for the Republicans, ousting Democratic incumbents. Engler 
beat James Blanchard, and Carlson unseated Rudy Perpich. 
</P>
<P>
In two gubernatorial squeakers, Democrat Ben Nelson narrowly defeated 
Republican Gov. Kay Orr, denying a second term to Nebraska's first woman 
governor, and rising GOP star Jim Edgar defeated Neil Hartigan in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
By late morning, the Arizona governor's race between Democrat Terry Goddard and 
Republican Fife Symington was the only undecided contest. State officials said 
there would be a runoff because neither candidate won a majority of the vote.

Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh submitted his resignation today after 
overwhelmingly losing a vote of confidence in Parliament, ending 11 months in 
office troubled by increasingly violent religious and political upheavals. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the vote, Singh convened his defeated Cabinet, which endorsed 
his letter of resignation to President Ramaswami Venkataraman. 
</P>
<P>
He was to meet with the president Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
He was defeated by a vote of 346 to 142, with eight abstentions. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lok Sabha (lower house) has taken the right decision," said opposition 
leader and former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. "The nightmare is over. The 
important thing is V.P. is out," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
After the vote, many of Singh's former allies who had turned against him 
approached him on the floor and shook his hand. 
</P>
<P>
The vote came at the end of an 11-hour debate in which Singh was accused of 
leading the country deeper into class divisions, failing to control prices and 
ignoring separatist insurrections in border states. 
</P>
<P>
At least 368 people have been killed in Hindu-Muslim riots in the last two 
weeks when Hindu fundamentalists defied Singh and pressed ahead with their 
campaign to replace a Muslim mosque with a Hindu temple in northeast India. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two months, at least 150 upper-caste students have died in suicides 
or protests against the government's efforts to reserve nearly half of all 
government jobs for low-caste Hindus. 
</P>
<P>
The two issues grew into serious crises for Singh and alienated him from many 
members of his own party.

The giant convenience store operator 7-Eleven opened its first shop today in 
South America. 
</P>
<P>
The store in Sao Paulo, South America's largest city, is a joint venture 
between Southland Corp., the Dallas-based owner of the 7-Eleven chain, and 
Esteve SA Exportadora, a Sao Paulo-based commodities exporting firm. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Ososki, the American director of the joint venture, said the store 
represented an investment of more than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Ososki said Southland has controlling interest in the joint venture. He said 
7-Eleven expects to open nine more stores in the Sao Paulo area by the end of 
1991. In the future, 7-Eleven may operate a franchising system to reach its 
goal of 100 stores in Brazil by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
The new store's architectural design is identical to that of the 13,000 other 
7-Elevens around the world.

The Renault-Volvo alliance was the first the commission has cleared under its 
recently expanded powers to vet large mergers among European Community

<P>
The commission said the merger between Volvo and Renault in markets for cars, 
trucks and buses will not create or strengthen a dominant position in any of 
the markets. 
</P>
<P>
It said that the linkup in trucks and buses will not impede competition in the

manufacture of up to 250,000 automobile transmissions a year for export to 
other GM facilities in Europe, as well as the assembly of Opel passenger cars 
for sale in Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Production could begin in late 1992, GM said. The auto maker is also in the 
process of establishing a distribution organization for selling Opels in the 
Slovak Republic. 
</P>
<P>
Following recent developments in Eastern Europe, GM has already established a 
facility for assembly of the Opel Vectra in Eisenach, Germany. Production began 
in early October.

DOW SINKS 44.31 POINTS ON WAR FEARS, OIL PRICE

Stocks fell sharply today, hurt by renewed fears of war in the Middle East that 
drove oil prices higher. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 44.31, or 1.8%, to 2,440.84. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 2 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 452 up, 1,117 down and 440 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 149.13 million shares, against 141.13 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices surged above $35 a barrel today as fears of a war in the Persian 
Gulf swept through the market. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil for December delivery was up a strong $2.77 to $35.40 on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange with half an hour left to trade. Refined oil prices were 
also sharply higher, with December heating oil up 6.22 cents to 92.60 cents a 
gallon. 
</P>
<P>
"There's almost a total consensus we're going into military activity in 
November," said Peter Beutel of Pegasus Econometrics. "I think the groundwork 
is being laid and the next provocation will be used as a premise for invading." 
</P>
<P>
With the U.S. elections out of the way, many traders view war as increasingly 
likely. 
</P>
<P>
"There are intensified rumors the U.S. may go into war really soon now that 
elections are over," said Marc Scullion, an analyst with Gerald Commodities 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
This view was intensified by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's warning 
that time was running out for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"The market jumped about 50 cents on Thatcher's statement," one trader said. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher told Parliament that sanctions against Iraq had been given three 
months to work and yet there was no sign Iraq was loosening its grip on Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Prices were rising before Thatcher's statement on a rumor, later denied, that 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III had passed an ultimatum to Iraq through a 
Chinese official. 
</P>
<P>
Oil prices also rose on the market's ability to shrug off a bearish report of a 
buildup in crude oil stocks. The American Petroleum Institute reported late 
Tuesday that U.S. crude stocks rose 5 million barrels last week to 344.5 
million barrels. 
</P>
<P>
Falling bond prices also hurt the stock market. The bond market was nervous 
because of the Treasury Department's huge sale of new government debt this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
The refunding encompasses a record $34.25 billion in securities with lives 
ranging from three years to just under 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Investor demand for that enormous supply apparently has been bolstered by 
expectations of new moves soon by the Federal Reserve toward a relaxation of 
its monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
Talk has spread in the past week or so that the Fed is worrying more about 
countering the effects of recession and less about combating inflationary 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
Browning-Ferris Industries fell 2 1/8 to 22 1/8 by midafternoon on top of a 
6-point plunge Tuesday, when the company reported a 55% quarterly earnings 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
MCA had dropped 1 1/4 to 61 3/4 following a big fire overnight at the company's 
Universal Studios. MCA said it believed its loss was fully covered by 
insurance.

J. Sainsbury PLC, Britain's biggest supermarket chain, today reported its 
profits rose sharply in the first half of this year, boosted by eight new store 
openings in what was an otherwise weakening domestic economy. 
</P>
<P>
Pre-tax profit for the 28 weeks ending Sept. 29 jumped 27% to $538.6 million 
compared with $423.6 million in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
Sales climbed to $8.43 billion from $7.33 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Sainsbury has built a leading market share with large-format stores supplying 
food staples as well as gourmet items. 
</P>
<P>
Sainsbury said its share of the British market rose to 12.1% from 11.3% despite 
strong competition. "Our exceptional price competitiveness has been fully 
maintained," company Chairman Lord Sainsbury said.

Veteran referee Roger Yanez, who came under criticism for his handling of a 
one-sided fight here last month, will not be allowed to work any more bouts 
this year, state boxing officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Buzz Alston, commissioner of the Arizona State Boxing Commission, said the 
decision was made after a review of Yanez's performance during the Alex 
Garcia-Bernard Benton fight Oct. 9 at the La Mancha Athletic Club. 
</P>
<P>
Benton, a former World Boxing Council cruiserweight champion, was pinned in a 
corner and knocked unconscious by Garcia at 2:42 of the second round. 
Commission officials said that Yanez was not in a proper position to make a 
timely decision and that Benton was left defenseless -- taking 32 unanswered 
punches before falling face down on the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
The fight was televised live nationally on USA Cable, and La Mancha employees 
said their switchboard was deluged with telephone calls in protest of Yanez's 
handling of the fight.

Nick Buoniconti, a former Notre Dame All-American and All-Pro linebacker, was 
selected the 1990 Walter Camp Man of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been a great football player, he has attained outstanding success in 
both law and business and he has contributed immensely to the betterment of 
mankind in his role as a major fund-raiser and supporter of the Miami Project 
to Cure Paralysis," said Kevin O'Brien, Walter Camp Football Foundation 
president.

The Miami Project is an effort to find ways to cure paralyzing spinal injuries. 
Buoniconti has raised millions to finance the project since a football injury

Buoniconti will receive the award at the 24th Annual Walter Camp All-America

Former world junior-welterweight boxing champion Terry Marsh was cleared by a 
jury today of trying to murder ex-Manager Frank Warren in a street shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Loud applause broke out at London's Old Bailey court when the jury of seven men 
and five women found the former International Boxing Federation titlist 
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
He had spent 10 months in jail awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
Warren, one of Britain's leading fight promoters, was shot by a hooded gunman 
outside a boxing arena last Nov. 30. He recovered fully although a bullet 
narrowly missed his heart. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor at London's Old Bailey court alleged that his attacker was 
Marsh, a professional firefighter whom Warren had guided to fame as a world 
champion two years previously. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh retired undefeated in 1988 after 27 professional fights.

Boris Becker tore a muscle in his left thigh and may miss the ATP World 
Championship next week, German Davis Cup Coach Nikki Pilic said today. 
</P>
<P>
If he is forced to pull out of the tournament, Becker will miss his last 
opportunity this season to take the No. 1 ranking from Stefan Edberg. 
</P>
<P>
The ATP World Championship is a $2-million event featuring the top eight 
players in the world. The tournament starts next Tuesday at Frankfurt, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Becker was forced to retire during Sunday's final against Edberg at the Paris 
Open with intense pain in his left thigh. 
</P>
<P>
He was examined Tuesday by Dr. Hans-Wilhelm Mueller-Wohlfarth in Munich. Pilic 
said the injury was diagnosed as a torn muscle. 
</P>
<P>
Becker will undergo a fitness test on Friday and will then make a decision if 
he can play in Frankfurt, Pilic said. 
</P>
<P>
"Becker is feeling better from day to day," Pilic said. "He has not been 
limping since Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
Becker and John McEnroe are staying away, but seven of the top 10 tennis 
players have signed up for the inaugural $6-million Grand Slam Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-man field is led by Stefan Edberg, the top-ranked player in the world, 
chief organizer Axel Mayer-Woelden said today. 
</P>
<P>
No. 3 Ivan Lendl also has signed up for the tournament, which has drawn 
criticism because of its record prize money. The tournament, which will give $2 
million to the winner, is scheduled for Dec. 11-16 at Munich. 
</P>
<P>
The losing finalist will get $1 million and semifinalists are guaranteed 
$450,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
Mayer-Woelden said Becker and McEnroe have turned down invitations. 
</P>
<P>
Becker has described the Grand Slam Cup purse as "perverse," and said long ago 
that he would not play. 
</P>
<P>
But McEnroe, who also has criticized the event, said two weeks ago that he was 
considering taking part in the Munich tournament. He said at the time that he 
would donate his earnings to charity.

HOTSHOT JOCKEY RIDES INTO TOWN; 
</P>
<P>
JOSE SANTOS, THE TOP GUN IN N.Y., TO TRY HIS LUCK IN THE SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN NADEL, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Southern California jockey colony, already considered the strongest in the 
world, gets even stronger today when Jose Santos, the country's leading rider 
the past four years, becomes a resident. 
</P>
<P>
Santos was scheduled for three mounts, including Daughter of Wolf in the 
$60,000-added Allez France Handicap, on opening day of Hollywood Park's 37-day 
fall-winter meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Santos, a native of Concepcion, Chile, has been riding in the United States for 
seven years. In the past four years his mounts have earned an average of $13 
million in purses. 
</P>
<P>
He did most of his riding in that period at Belmont Park in New York and The 
Meadowlands in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Starting today, he'll be a full-time Californian. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a good challenge here, competing with the top jockeys," 
Santos said. "We (Santos and his agent, Frank Sanabria) have been planning to 
come to California for three years, and finally we're here." 
</P>
<P>
Santos, 29, will join a group of riders which includes, among others, Gary 
Stevens, Chris McCarron, Eddie Delahoussaye, Laffit Pincay and Kent Desormeaux. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens currently leads the nation in purse earnings with more than $12.5 
million. Santos is second with over $11.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not nervous at all," Santos said. "I've ridden here occasionally and I 
know the jockeys. I've won some big races at Hollywood Park and Santa Anita. 
I've won some claiming races here, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'll have some real tough competition here. But I'll be one of the top 
guys, too. Everybody respects me. I'm here to win some races. We're planning to 
stay. If we're doing well, we'll buy a house here." 
</P>
<P>
Santos has won a lot of races since arriving in 1984 to ride in Florida -- 
1,886, to be exact. His mounts have earned more than $70 million. 
</P>
<P>
Santos, the son of a jockey, rode his first race in Chile at age 14. He 
admitted he wasn't so confident when he arrived in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came here, I hoped to win at least 50 races a year so I could earn a 
living," he recalled. "Things started out well, (but) I certainly didn't expect 
to do so well. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started winning some races in New York, that's when I became real 
confident." 
</P>
<P>
Santos was the only jockey to win more than one race in the Breeders' Cup last 
month -- he was victorious aboard unbeaten filly Meadow Star and colt Fly So 
Free in the juvenile events. 
</P>
<P>
He'll almost surely ride one or the other in the Kentucky Derby next May. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my goal, to win the Kentucky Derby," he said. "That's every jockey's 
goal. I'm still young. I'll get one, maybe more."

A'S BAN SMOKING IN THE STANDS

<P>
Fans of the Oakland Athletics who feel burned by the team's World Series 
performance may get really fired up about a new ban on smoking in outdoor seats 
at the Oakland Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
The A's announced the ban Tuesday, saying it will make the ballpark a better 
place to watch baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"We have received letters from nonsmoking fans in the past, but this was a 
proactive decision to keep the Coliseum environment one of the better ones in 
which to watch a ball game," said Andy Dolich, vice president of business 
operations for the A's. 
</P>
<P>
One season-ticket holder called cigarette smoke a "part of the ambience of 
night games." 
</P>
<P>
But Dolich said starting next year anyone who lights up during an A's game will 
receive a warning from an usher and a printed card detailing designated smoking 
areas. Militant smokers will be subject to removal.

Coach Dick Motta expects things to get worse for the Sacramento Kings before 
they get better. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings lost starter Antoine Carr to an injury for at least 10 days during 
Tuesday's 102-85 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
Motta was counting on veterans Wayman Tisdale and Carr to help carry the Kings 
while Sacramento worked to rebuild the franchise around four first-round draft 
picks. A dislocated pinky finger on Carr's left hand changed all of that. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll give (Duane) Causwell and all the other young players a chance to play," 
Motta said. "If we're floundering, we might as well as give the young kids a 
chance to grow up." 
</P>
<P>
Motta doesn't expect too much help, though, from first-round pick Anthony 
Bonner who is still sidelined with a left foot stress fracture. 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento has lost nine straight games dating back to April 10. The Kings are 
0-3 so far this season. They play the Lakers in Los Angeles on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure everyone will bring up the fact we've lost 41 straight times to Los 
Angeles," Motta said. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas forward Roy Tarpley is getting a lot of questions about his weight these 
days. 
</P>
<P>
That's not a good sign, but at least it's an improvement over what he used to 
get asked about -- his two trips to drug rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Tarpley, whose health is the key to the Dallas Mavericks' success, reported to 
training camp a month ago nearly 30 pounds over last year's listed weight of 
240 pounds. He says he's at 260 now, about 10 pounds more than he wants to 
weigh, but insists it's unrealistic to expect him to stay at 240. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone has been basing what I should weigh on my first years in the league, 
like I'm supposed to stay the same weight my whole career," Tarpley said.

NEW YORK -- Maxi Priest recently was out shopping in London and decided to buy 
some clothes. He found a nice store, selected a pair of trousers and went into 
the dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
When he came out, a line had formed for autographs. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the attention is there a lot more than it was before," said Priest, 
whose sunny smile and sunny No. 1 single, "Close to You," have made him a man 
worth waiting for. 
</P>
<P>
"When I go to a club, I like to find my little corner and dance and see what's 
going on, trying to enjoy myself the way I used to enjoy myself." 
</P>
<P>
He insists that success will not change him. And even if you've heard that a 
million times before, this time it might be true; Priest has always been the 
center of attention. Aunts and uncles fussed over him. Girls followed him in 
high school. Party guests gave him money. 
</P>
<P>
"I was brought up in a family of nine kids, and I was the second-youngest," 
said Priest, 27, who grew up in southeast London. "When you grow up in a big 
family, there's so many personalities that you learn to deal with all different 
kinds of people. That also helped me develop my personality." 
</P>
<P>
He thinks he's close to becoming a major star. "Just a Little Bit Longer" is 
the next single off "Bonafide," and Priest predicts that if it becomes a hit, 
"All doors are open." 
</P>
<P>
"I know I've been gifted by God," he said. "I think there's a light shining on 
me."

Phil Donahue heads to this once-prosperous Mississippi River town to ask, "Can 
Anything Be Done to Save This Dying City?" 
</P>
<P>
The "Donahue" show will be taped Monday at a high school here. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based syndicated program will look at the transformation from a 
national rail and stockyard center to "a desolate and dying city," spokeswoman 
Alyssa Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
"Thousands of jobs have gone with the closing of factories, leaving the city a 
pocket of hopeless poverty, trash-strewn vacant lots, block after block of 
boarded-up houses, and crime and drugs running rampant," Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
No date has been selected for the segment to air nationally.

BASS JAMES MORRIS RIDING HIGH

American bass James Morris has been described as a bigger-than-life cowboy 
because of his love for wide open spaces and his imposing presence on and off 
the stage. 
</P>
<P>
He has also been described as demanding and aloof. 
</P>
<P>
But after a Monday night season opener for the Opera Company of Philadelphia, 
Morris was in good spirits -- partly because his wife performed in the same 
opera. 
</P>
<P>
Morris sang Count Almavivia ,the philanderer in Mozart's "The Marriage of 
Figaro." His wife, mezzo soprano Susan Quittmeyer, sang the role of Cherubino, 
a page and an unwitting foil for Figaro. 
</P>
<P>
Quittmeyer said the casting didn't happen by chance. 
</P>
<P>
"These are never coincidences," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Morris agreed, saying scheduling was a problem in their personal lives. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great when we get a chance to be in the same part of the country and even 
greater to be together in a production," he said. "I especially like it when we 
can both go to Santa Fe because I love the West, too." 
</P>
<P>
The couple lives in New Jersey.

BO KNOWS;

<P>
LAST FEW YEARS HAVE BEEN PRETTY GOOD FOR DIDDLEY

Bo knows irony. 
</P>
<P>
"You work your buns off all these years -- going up and down the highway, 
riding those raggedy airplanes and stuff like that," Bo Diddley says. "And I 
make a commercial with Bo Jackson and all I say is "Bo, you don't know 
Diddley!' and all of a sudden I'm back up at the top again? 
</P>
<P>
"I ain't figured this out yet." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. The fact is that after several rough decades -- the loss of most of his 
royalties to unscrupulous record label owners followed by years of undeserved 
semi-obscurity -- the past few years have been very good to Bo Diddley. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, he was inducted into the still-unbuilt Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, 
belated recognition for the rhythmic cornerstones Diddley laid as one of rock's 
key architects in the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
Then, MCA put out "Bo Diddley: The Chess Box," gathering crucial recordings 
Diddley made for the Chicago label between 1955 and 1968, which provided not 
only artistic validation but also the first royalties Diddley ever received for 
those classic tracks. 
</P>
<P>
And then Diddley made a Nike commercial with another Bo, last name Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
That commercial -- in which sports virtuoso Jackson unsuccessfully tackles the 
electric guitar -- provided a much-needed boost for Diddley. The Nike ads -- 
Diddley won't say what they earned him -- made him visible again, made him real 
to a new generation of fans who knew him only secondhand when their favorite 
bands did songs like "Bo Diddley," "Who Do You Love?," "Mona," "I'm a Man," 
"Pretty Thing," "Road Runner" and "You Can't Judge a Book by Its Cover." 
</P>
<P>
Diddley in his 60s looks pretty much as he has since the '60s -- squat, genial 
and thoughtful behind the familiar thick black frames of his glasses. 
</P>
<P>
"Phil and Leonard Chess robbed me," Diddley says evenly, of the owners of the 
label that recorded him, Chuck Berry, Willie Dixon and other seminal rock 
figures. "I know they robbed me but I didn't have sense enough to know it at 
the time they were doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Royalty subterfuge and creative bookkeeping that seldom favored the artist were 
all too common practices at small labels in the '50s, though Diddley was also 
"robbed," as he calls it, by subsequent owners of the Chess catalogue -- until 
MCA bought it in 1987. "They've been kicking out a few bucks to Bo Diddley. 
They take care of business, and I'm very happy about it. 
</P>
<P>
"But all the things that I own, I got by working one-nighters, not from no 
royalty checks." 
</P>
<P>
Serious money was usually just out of reach for Diddley, who was born Otha 
Ellis Bates in McComb, Miss., in 1928 and changed his name to Ellas McDaniel 
when he was adopted by his mother's cousin after moving to Chicago in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
He picked up the Diddley name -- a slang term for street savvy -- for his 
boxing prowess; prophetically, it was also the name of an African one-string 
guitar. Diddley began playing a six-string American cousin after starting on 
violin and dropping it when he noticed a dearth of black violinists. He built 
his first guitar in shop class at Foster Vocational School. "I just decided to 
make a square one and see if it worked, and it did, so I used it in my act." 
</P>
<P>
He approached his career with much the same focus he did his guitar playing. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept pounding at it," Diddley said. "It was like being in jail and you've 
got a chisel and a hammer and the chisel is dull, but you keep beating at that 
same spot and eventually you're going to get a hole through there. It might 
take a little while, but you keep pounding. And you might not get out but you 
can see through it, dig?"
