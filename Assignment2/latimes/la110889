Downtown Los Angeles may not qualify as a paradise for athletes yet, but the 
Freeway City does offer a growing number of hidden-away sports facilities above 
the fumes. 
</P>
<P>
The latest is a driving range for golfers on the roof of the L.A. World Trade 
Center off Figueroa Street. Just the thing for the duffer who can't get height 
on his shots -- you start out six stories above the ground! 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a great way to spend your lunchtime -- to kind of get away from 
it all," said Trade Center Director Al Dougal. 
</P>
<P>
The driving range joins such out-of-view attractions as the YMCA's rooftop 
tennis courts (alongside the driving range), the jogging track atop City Hall 
East, and the third-floor bowling alley in Yaohan Plaza in Little Tokyo. (Alas, 
the fitness craze suffered a setback when the avant-garde miniature golf course 
at the L.A. Contemporary Exhibitions gallery recently closed.) 
</P>
<P>
The Trade Center hopes that the driving range, which opened two weeks ago, will 
attract Civic Center types as well as visiting businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
There's even a rooftop pro, Jim Westmoreland, on hand to give lessons. 
</P>
<P>
For those who choose to go it alone (at $5 per half hour), Dougal said: "Our 
two lanes are about 70 feet long so you get a good idea of whether you're 
hooking or slicing." 
</P>
<P>
While errant shots from the Griffith Park courses often land on the Golden 
State Freeway, Trade Center hackers needn't worry about skulling an automobile 
or pedestrian below. 
</P>
<P>
"The lanes," Dougal said, "are double-netted." 
</P>
<P>
When he was 15, John Goddard made a "blueprint for life" of 127 goals, 
including diving in a submarine, landing on an aircraft carrier, riding in the 
Tournament of Roses Parade and walking on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
One of the above has eluded him: The moon walk. Yes, he did survive the terror 
of the post-Rose Parade traffic jam. 
</P>
<P>
Goddard, an anthropologist/explorer who belongs to the Royal Geographic 
Society, says he has accomplished 108 of the goals. His home in La Canada 
Flintridge is filled with mementoes and clippings attesting to his feats, which 
he recounts in lectures and motivational speeches. 
</P>
<P>
After thinking up new projects over the years, he drew up a second list. And 
the other day, he fulfilled a more recent wish -- flying a B-1 bomber. 
</P>
<P>
Goddard, 64, took off from Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene, Tex., with a bomber 
crew, and flew a four-hour training mission. "It was a tremendous thrill," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Joseph Purka, a spokesman for the Air Force, said that Goddard -- a 
pilot during World War II -- was approved for the mission because he "met the 
qualifications." Goddard confessed that he was aided in his dream by a friend, 
former Secretary of the Air Force Verne Orr. 
</P>
<P>
What's next? Goddard isn't sure. But there's always goal No. 127 -- "to live to 
see the year 2000." 
</P>
<P>
On today's City News Service calendar: "6 p.m., Hollywood -- Frederick's of 
Hollywood will hold a ribbon-cutting ceremony for its Celebrity Lingerie Hall 
of Fame. Milton Berle will take part." 
</P>
<P>
That's appropriate. The only question is which old female costume from his 
television days is Uncle Miltie going to contribute?

CORONADO COOL TO PROPOSAL THAT IT TAKE OVER TROUBLED IMPERIAL BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
BROKE: MAYOR OF NEARLY BANKRUPT CITY GETS LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT IN VISIT TO 
RICHER NEIGHBOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Coronado Mayor Mary Herron reacted coolly Tuesday to an idea by Imperial Beach 
Mayor Henry Smith that Coronado take over nearly bankrupt Imperial Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It is time for us to seriously investigate our future options. One of the 
options is the city of Coronado," Smith said in a letter he read to the 
Coronado City Council. "All that I would like to do today is to begin the 
process of our staff looking at the city of Coronado and assessing whether it 
is a viable option to consider our consolidation with your city." 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Beach officials have warned that the city will not be able to pay its 
bills in January, unless new revenue sources are found. To that end, a measure 
to raise $450,000 annually with a 5% tax on each utility bill was put to 
voters, but was defeated, Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But even that wouldn't have guaranteed financial viability for the ailing beach 
town, Smith said, and officials would still seek to merge with Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
If Imperial Beach goes bankrupt, it might be forced to disincorporate, thereby 
coming under county control. Smith and the City Council have also discussed 
consolidating with San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Herron made it clear that Coronado officials are not enthusiastic 
about annexing Imperial Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We would feel very cautious," Herron said. "Coronado has worked long and hard 
to be where we are. It may be more of an undertaking than we can envision." 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Beach, a city of about 25,000 residents, is the only beach city in the 
county that has not developed its beachfront. Many of its residents are 
apartment dwellers, and it has a limited tax base. For almost a decade, the 
city was forced to dip into its reserves to continue providing services, and 
the reserve is now exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Coronado, with its upper-middle-class community, has long 
cherished its exclusiveness and is well-known for the many Navy admirals who 
have retired there. The average cost of a home is $406,000 in Coronado, which 
has a population of about 20,000; the average cost of a home is $174,000 in 
Imperial Beach. The two cities are joined by the Silver Strand. 
</P>
<P>
Herron expressed concern that Coronado's resources would be strained if it were 
required to provide services such as police and fire protection to Imperial 
Beach, which is served by the sheriff and has a tiny fire department. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what the outcome will be. But no mayor will want to be faced with 
the condition you find yourself in," Herron said to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Although Smith requested that Herron allow Coronado's city manager to meet with 
Imperial Beach's city manager to discuss the proposed merger, Herron did not 
make a commitment to the talks. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not going to jump into this, are they? All I ask for is exactly what 
the letter said," Smith said after his brief appearance before the Coronado 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times last month, Coronado City Manager Homer Bludau 
said there is no incentive for Coronado to consolidate with Imperial Beach. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego City Manager John Lockwood said that San Diego city officials would 
be willing to discuss consolidation with Imperial Beach, but he added that 
there were no immediate plans by San Diego to annex Imperial Beach. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County Supervisor Brian Bilbray has argued that the best alternative 
available to Imperial Beach is to consolidate with the county. Bilbray, a 
former Imperial Beach mayor, said the county would become Imperial Beach's 
trustee for three years, then voters would have an opportunity to vote on 
incorporation again. 
</P>
<P>
However, Smith and the majority of the Imperial Beach City Council favor 
consolidating with either Coronado or San Diego.

DUFFY VIDEOTAPE DIRECTIVE SPURS THREAT OF SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All members of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department are being asked to 
view videotapes of a television interview in which Sheriff John Duffy discusses 
his upcoming campaign for reelection, and one local attorney believes the 
arrangement is a violation of the law. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney, Everett Bobbitt, said that Duffy's request in a weekly newsletter 
that his staff view the videotape from KNSD Channel 39's "Headliners" program 
is similar to a previous incident in which the sheriff improperly used deputies 
to pass out post cards calling for the ouster of Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth 
Bird from the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"It's strictly a repeat of the Rose Bird infraction as far as a legal issue," 
Bobbitt said Tuesday. "Only this is worse because now he's doing it for his own 
political benefit." 
</P>
<P>
In the television interview, which aired Oct. 29, Duffy criticized The Times 
for reporting that he has been working for years as a private consultant and 
not disclosing any of his outside income. In another segment of the 30-minute 
program, he discussed the upcoming campaign, in which he is seeking a sixth, 
four-year term as sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy could not be reached for comment Tuesday. In his department's weekly 
newsletter, called The Informant, the staff was told that VHS copies of the 
interview "will be distributed this week to all sheriff's stations and 
facilities." 
</P>
<P>
"The unedited interview was a rare opportunity for Sheriff Duffy to respond to 
adversaries in a news media setting," the newsletter said. "All personnel are 
encouraged to view the tape." 
</P>
<P>
Bobbitt, in a letter this week to Duffy, said he was outraged that 
rank-and-file deputies were being required to view the videotape, which the 
lawyer said was purely political and had nothing to do with law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
He also told Duffy that, if the Sheriff's Department does not stop distributing 
the tape, he will file a lawsuit "to force you and your staff to cease 
political activities." 
</P>
<P>
Bobbitt, who performs legal services for the Deputy Sheriffs Assn., emphasized 
that he would file the lawsuit as a private citizen and not on behalf of the 
DSA. He said he is concerned that county video equipment was used to make the 
copies of the tape, and that government employees were used to produce it and 
distribute it to the staff. He also said it is improper for deputies to review 
the tapes on county time. 
</P>
<P>
"It is illegal for a public official to use public funds or equipment to 
further a political cause," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Rose Bird case, Duffy in 1985 had his on-duty deputies distribute post 
cards as part of the campaign to remove the chief justice from the state 
Supreme Court. Attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union successfully 
sued Duffy over that matter on behalf of the citizens lobbying group California 
Common Cause, and the sheriff and one of his subordinates were later personally 
loaned $36,000 to pay the ACLU attorneys' fees in the case.

CREATIONISM AND EVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the 1930s, the Soviet Union rejected the scientific rules of heredity 
because they did not conform to communist dogma, and substituted an 
ideologically "correct" belief in the views of T.D. Lysenko. The result was a 
disaster for Soviet genetics, including crop breeding, since the Mendelian 
rules of heredity continued to operate in complete disregard for the dogma! 
</P>
<P>
We should learn from history: It is unwise to ignore the truth about nature 
because it does not match ideological or religious dogmas. But this is just 
what Shaver advocates. 
</P>
<P>
That life on earth has at least a 3 1/2-billion year history of hereditary 
descent with modification -- i.e., that evolution has occurred -- is a fact of 
nature with critical implications for all the life sciences. For example, an 
understanding of evolution and its mechanisms immediately explains the rapid 
development of resistance to chemical pesticides and antibiotics on the part of 
crop pests and bacteria, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The evolutionary history of life is a "fact" in the same sense that it is a 
"fact" that the earth is round, not flat. The "fact" of evolution is based on 
overwhelming evidence from geology, paleontology, genetics, molecular biology, 
physics, morphology and other sciences. The evidence is internally consistent, 
in spite of attempts by scientists to find inconsistencies (science is a 
process by which our understanding of nature is constantly re-evaluated in 
light of new evidence). 
</P>
<P>
Shaver misrepresents the scientific process and the depth and richness of our 
knowledge about the evolutionary past and about the mechanisms that cause 
evolution. We would seriously mislead our children by withholding this 
important knowledge from them, and by teaching them that science and religious 
dogma are interchangeable.

CREATIONISM AND EVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Fossilization of Darwin's Pet" by Jessica Reynolds Shaver and 
"Science Is Science, and Faith Is Faith," by Michael Hudson, Op-Ed Page, Oct. 
24: 
</P>
<P>
As a Christian author, I am happy to accept Hudson's proposition that "science 
is science and faith is faith." I have no desire to see even "creation science" 
taught to the next generation by faithless science teachers who, if forced by 
legislation, would present creation in a less than credible light. 
</P>
<P>
As a Christian lawyer, however, I join with Shaver in calling for fair 
treatment of the available evidence. Why do we insist on truth in advertising 
when used cars and toothpaste are the issue, but refuse to insist on truth in 
education when life's origins are the issue? 
</P>
<P>
Let Christian parents teach their children about how God made us in his image. 
But let secular scientists have the intellectual honesty to teach the 
difference between evolution within a species (which obviously can be proved) 
and macroevolution from one species to another (which is a worn-out theory 
teetering on the brink of collapse after more than a century of futile search 
for transitional forms in the fossil record). 
</P>
<P>
What irony that Hudson's People for the American Way, a constitutional 
liberties organization, would insist that only one view of life's origins be 
permitted in institutions dedicated to the search for knowledge. Freedom of 
thought, but only for those who agree with conventional wisdom?

HATE CRIMES IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We commend The Times for its front-page coverage (Oct. 26) of the Los Angeles 
County Human Relations Commission's survey on hate crimes in the county's 
schools. Public awareness of this pressing issue is a very important step in 
developing appropriate response mechanisms to address it effectively. 
</P>
<P>
While the survey is important in counting and publicizing hate incidents, it 
did not -- could not -- gauge the increase in racial prejudice and interracial 
tensions that underlie the incidents. Indeed, these attitudes are nearly 
impossible to measure in a scientific manner, such as incidents and behavior 
are. 
</P>
<P>
Our own programmatic efforts to reduce prejudice and interracial tensions are 
conducted in response to "felt needs" expressed by campus administration, 
faculty and, sometimes, students. The school campuses with which we work in our 
human relations camps and on-campus Project Brotherhood/Sisterhood all report 
tensions between individuals and all racial and ethnic groups. The point is 
that intergroup tensions may well be even deeper and more widespread than even 
the report documents. 
</P>
<P>
Proactive programs to reduce prejudice and intergroup tensions must be put at 
the forefront of our public policy agenda and not just on school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
Must we wait for Los Angeles to experience its own Bensonhursts before our 
community and its public policy-makers see that racial tensions must be 
addressed in a systematic proactive manner?

CREATIONISM AND EVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shaver claims that many evolutionary biologists now are having second thoughts 
about evolution. The standards of accuracy in her column are not high. For 
example, she claims that British paleontologist Colin Patterson publicly 
recanted his believe in evolution in a talk at the American Museum of Natural 
History in 1981, and now admits that evolution is unsupported by the fossil 
record. This "Patterson fable" was first published in June, 1982, in "Impact," 
a four-page insert in the monthly newsletter of the Institute for Creation 
Research of San Diego, and has been copied ad nauseam by creationist writers 
ever since. In a letter written in June, 1982, Dr. Patterson explains what 
happened: 
</P>
<P>
"The story behind the 'Impact' article is that last November I gave a talk to 
the systematics discussion group in the AMNH. I was asked to talk on 'evolution 
and creationism,' and knowing the meetings of the group as informal sessions 
where ideas could be kicked around among specialists, I put a case for the 
difficulties and problems with evolution, specifically in the field of 
systematics. I was too naive and foolish to guess what might happen: The talk 
was taped by a creationist who passed the tape to Luther Sunderland . . . I was 
putting a case for discussion, as I thought off the record, and was speaking 
only about systematics, a specialized field. I do not support the creationist 
movement in any way, and in particular, I am opposed to their efforts to modify 
school curricula. In short the article does not fairly represent my views." 
</P>
<P>
So the Patterson fable has no foundation. 
</P>
<P>
So much for the veracity of Shaver's article. Evolution is far from dead; it 
remains the central working principle of modern biology. Biology without 
evolution would only be natural history, and we haven't taught natural history 
for 100 years. The heated arguments among biologists today and how evolution 
occurs are signs of the life and vigor of the field. It would be a loss to good 
teaching if the eccentric fringe of science and their tape recorders would 
discourage teachers from speaking provocatively for fear that their words later 
would be twisted and tortured out of context, as Shaver has done with Colin 
Patterson.

CALIFORNIA'S UNFINISHED REVOLUTION; 
</P>
<P>
INSURANCE: PROPOSITION 103 IS STILL UNDER SEIGE FROM THE INDUSTRY, THOUGH IT'S 
MORE POPULAR THAN EVER WITH CONSUMERS. NOW MAY BE THE TIME FOR A SUCCESSOR PLAN 
TO END INSURER DEFIANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARVEY ROSENFIELD, Harvey Rosenfield is chairman of Voter Revolt, the 
consumer organization that sponsored Proposition 103. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ramifications of Prop. 103 may ultimately force the voters to re-examine 
Prop. 103, but only if events create an unstable environment where the auto 
insurance system is in continuing turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 -- From a secret memo to the insurance industry from its political consultant, 
Clinton Reilly, three weeks after voter approval of Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
One year ago today, California voters took insurance reform into their own 
hands and passed Proposition 103. But unlike other recent mass uprisings around 
the world, this was a peaceful revolt. 
</P>
<P>
As citizens of a democracy, Californians have the power to override a corrupted 
Legislature and pass needed laws simply by going to the polls. So after 
enduring years of legalized extortion by insurance companies, the people 
approved Proposition 103, reducing auto, homeowner and other liability 
insurance rates to 1987 levels, eliminating arbitrary and discriminatory 
practices and imposing the most stringent controls in the country on this 
rapacious industry. 
</P>
<P>
The intervening 12 months, however, have revealed that the insurance industry, 
and its allies in government charged with enforcing Proposition 103 have no 
more respect for democracy than a Colombian drug cartel. Insurance executives 
and state Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie ridicule the law as the 
product of an emotional, unthinking mob that has no place telling insurers what 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
Addicted to excessive profits and desperate to discourage reformers in other 
states, insurers have plotted revenge against California: a course of 
intimidation, coercion and outright lawlessness designed to punish the people 
for approving 103. The strategy was laid out in the secret memo by consultant 
Reilly. It concluded, "In defeat, the industry may finally win -- if it 
realizes the opportunity and continues to mobilize its considerable resources." 
</P>
<P>
Resources it has. Consumers should have gotten their 20% rollbacks long ago. 
Instead, the "good hands people" have shoved their greedy fingers even deeper 
into our wallets, jacking up rates as if 103 had never existed. Longtime 
customers have had their policies arbitrarily canceled or have been suddenly 
reclassified as higher risks, in flagrant violation of Proposition 103. 
Companies have refused to open their books to independent review, as required 
by 103, or to participate in the hearings mandated by the new law. And, using 
millions of dollars of our money, the insurance industry has hired thousands of 
lawyers -- at an estimated $1 million per day -- to file legal challenges to 
the law, to concoct absurd legal arguments to circumvent its requirements or to 
delay the new regulations. In one particularly reprehensible case, attorneys 
from the same law firm agreed on behalf of one insurer to comply with a 
schedule for implementing 103, then turned around and sued on behalf of another 
company to have the plan invalidated. 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite the turmoil and the industry's continued intransigence, polls show 
that far more Californians support Proposition 103 today than on Election Day 
1988, even though a majority believes that rollbacks will never be extracted 
from insurers. 
</P>
<P>
Why the greater support? Because more than ever, the public knows that 103 is 
necessary for its protection. The insurance industry has, since approval of 
103, proven the wisdom of the initiative: The more the insurers disobey the 
law, the stiffer the resolve of citizens to insist that it be enforced. This 
mounting public support, in turn, fortifies the law in the face of those who 
would otherwise ignore or subvert it. It is no accident that the Deukmejian 
Administration, which only recently was not embarrassed to champion the 
interests of insurers, now finds itself freezing insurance rates to protect an 
outraged public. 
</P>
<P>
In response to a lawsuit brought by Voter Revolt, the Proposition 103 
Intervention Team and other citizen groups, Insurance Commissioner Gillespie 
also agreed last month to scrap every one of the hundreds of exemptions from 
the 20% rollback she had previously granted. Using an approach favored by 
consumer advocates and Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp, she will begin anew the 
process of determining rollbacks and adopting procedures for regulating rates. 
</P>
<P>
And though much of the focus has been on 103's 20% rollback, voters have 
gradually become aware of its other reforms for which there is equally strong 
public support. Polls show that Californians throughout the state are 
particularly supportive of 103's requirement that auto insurance rates to be 
based primarily on characteristics that drivers control, such as safety 
records, rather than zip codes. 
</P>
<P>
Voters also see the opportunity to elect the insurance commissioner in 
November, 1990 -- mandated by 103 -- as a virtual guarantee that the remainder 
of the initiative will eventually be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 (Ralph) Nader wants our Persian rugs off our floors, he wants to cut insurance 
executives' salaries, he wants to cut your commissions as agents and brokers. 
... Like Hitler, there is no appeasement. ... Some may appease you, consumer 
activists, but we at the National Assn. of Independent Insurers ... will fight. 
..." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Insurance executive John Crosby, leader of the industry's unsuccessful 
campaign against 103, in a speech in New York City on Sept. 22, 1989, comparing 
consumer activists to Adolf Hitler and insurers to Winston Churchill. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 103 has ushered in a new era of tough scrutiny and regulation of 
insurers. But its long-term success in reducing rates requires that insurance 
companies accept a fundamental change in their basic purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Before Proposition 103, insurers operated on a "cost plus" basis: The costs of 
claims were simply passed on to consumers, along with an average 56% markup to 
cover insurer profits, multimillion-dollar executive salaries, campaign 
contributions and other expenses. Under this system, insurers perversely 
profited from more accidents, litigation, higher doctor bills, inflated car 
repair and other costs. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of acting simply as middlemen, insurers must be willing to take 
responsibility for controlling the costs of the claims and expenses they pay 
out. By giving the insurance commissioner the power to regulate rates, 
Proposition 103 allows the commissioner to set performance standards that will 
encourage insurers to focus on claims prevention, rather than on maximizing 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, however, the bureaucratic auto insurance industry has demonstrated 
about the same willingness to change as the Chinese government. Instead, 
insurance companies have bulldozed the nation with a $90-million advertising 
campaign designed to convince us that they care about lowering rates and paying 
lip service to the need to control costs. But when a comprehensive bill to 
improve auto safety, limit unnecessary lawsuits, crack down on health-care 
fraud and uninsured motorists and provide a lifeline auto policy for low-income 
Californians surfaced in the California Legislature, the auto insurers' 
lobbyists fought the measure and won a veto from the governor. 
</P>
<P>
The prognosis for change is not good. Industry executives, ensconced in their 
high-rise office suites in Illinois and Connecticut, refuse to let a mere 
California ballot initiative dictate how they should run their empire. But 
their time is running out. Inspired by Proposition 103, consumers in 35 states 
from Nevada to South Carolina have promoted or passed rate rollbacks and other 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
In California, where democracy itself has been invigorated by 103's passage, 
the voters have the power to end the industry's defiance once and for all. One 
option is illustrated by the experience of British Columbia. For every dollar 
consumers there pay in premiums, their insurance company pays a full dollar 
back in claims; investment income covers all expenses and overhead, which 
amount to one-third of what California auto insurers spend. For equivalent 
coverage, rates are dramatically cheaper in British Columbia than in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Why does the system in British Columbia operate so well? Because in 1974 the 
public got fed up with the arrogance and greed of private auto insurance 
companies and kicked them out of the state. They were replaced with a 
citizen-owned company that operates on a nonprofit basis. The Insurance Corp. 
of British Columbia carefully manages claim costs by aggressively promoting 
safe driving, negotiating reduced auto-repair rates and health-care charges and 
really going after fraud. 
</P>
<P>
But most important, the public loves the corporation. Last summer, Allstate and 
other private auto insurers waged a costly campaign to be allowed back into 
British Columbia, begging to serve the market they once scorned as 
"unprofitable." But consumer support for their auto insurance corporation is so 
strong that the state's conservative government refused to let the private 
insurers return.

IN WAR OF IMAGES, A TAXING 'VICTORY'; 
</P>
<P>
ISRAEL: ITS TREATMENT OF THE BEIT SAHUR PROTESTORS NOT ONLY RAISES INDIGNATION. 
IT SUGGESTS A LOSING STRATEGY IN THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES.

<P>
The tax revolt in Beit Sahur is now officially over. 
</P>
<P>
For many months, merchants in the small town just east of Bethlehem have 
refused to pay income or value-added tax to the Civil Administration, the 
official name of Israel's military government in the West Bank. Since Sept. 21, 
Israel has responded by imposing daytime restrictions and a night curfew on the 
town, arresting tax resisters and confiscating property. Since some taxes have 
now been paid and enough property has been attached at least to cover 
outstanding arrears, the Israeli authorities have declared victory and gone 
home. 
</P>
<P>
In the larger scheme of things, Beit Sahur should not be a particularly 
newsworthy story. Tax resistance on the West Bank is not a new phenomenon. Nor 
does the action mean much to the character of the Palestinian uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Other nonviolent aspects, such as strikes and boycotts of Israeli products, are 
far more widespread and prolonged. Nevertheless, the Beit Sahur tax revolt has 
been subjected to some of the most intense media exposure since the outbreak of 
the intifada in December, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the explanation is that this mostly middle-class Christian town is only 
a few minutes away from Jerusalem, where many foreign journalists, consuls and 
church officials are permanently stationed. The main reason is that the tax 
resisters of Beit Sahur have pushed precisely the right buttons to arouse 
Western, and especially American sympathy. By unfurling the slogan "No taxation 
without representation," they have made their struggle into a cause with which 
no patriotic American can fail to identify. This is not just happy coincidence; 
Palestinians are as attuned as anyone else to public relations. If Beit Sahur 
were on the coast, the tea would already be in the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"No taxation without representation" is an ambiguous slogan, and it would be 
interesting to ask whether the Palestinians who raise it are calling for the 
end of taxation or the beginning of representation. But in the present context, 
the question would be pointless. The tax revolt is not a civic protest against 
the denial of the elementary right of representation in decisions about the 
raising and spending of public revenues. 
</P>
<P>
If that is what Beit Sahur and the rest of the West Bank and Gaza wanted, they 
could have had it many years ago; local elections and autonomy have been 
officially on offer at least since the Camp David agreement of 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the tax revolt is part of the struggle for control of the territories 
and its political objectives are the end of Israeli occupation and the creation 
of an independent Palestinian state. It is difficult to blame the people of 
Beit Sahur for acting as they have. Most of them undoubtedly share these 
objectives, as would most other people in similar situations. But while the tax 
revolt is clearly not terrorism, neither is it the purely spontaneous voluntary 
demonstration described in many media accounts. Individuals inclined to settle 
their tax bills were threatened by local "shock forces," especially those of 
George Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
When a group of about 50 merchants and municipal leaders met in the last week 
of October to discuss the possibility of a compromise with the Civil 
Administration, two PFLP activists burst into the room and threatened to kill 
anyone who paid taxes or approved any full or partial settlement of the strike. 
On the way out, they smashed the windshield of the mayor's car. Through such 
means, the sporadic withholding of taxes common elsewhere in the West Bank was 
turned into an organized, general tax strike in Beit Sahur. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, however, appearances matter far more than reality. Israel was 
unable to isolate the enforcers of the strike or to oblige individual tax 
resisters to pay up through normal collection practices, and it was unwilling 
to lose the political struggle for control. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, it resorted to a variety of methods. Most attention has been 
focused on the collective punishments that have alienated the population of 
what had previously been a fairly quiet town and aroused the indignation of 
observers everywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
Israel is fighting a battle for control and a war of images. The outcome of 
Beit Sahur suggests that Israel is winning the battle and losing the war, and 
it will probably go on losing that war until the occupation is succeeded by a 
political settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Even then, the Palestinians will be very lucky if they get democratic 
representation along with their taxation. But at least the redcoats won't speak 
Hebrew.

CLIPPERS CAN'T SHAKE PAST IN LOSS TO WARRIORS 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The inverted Pacific Division flipped Tuesday night when the teams seemed to 
return to their rightful places. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden State Warriors, shooting 39.4% through two dreadful performances, 
were revived in time to appease some anxious fans and a stressed-out coach. The 
Clippers, who seemed so full of life opening the season, went flat. 
</P>
<P>
The result was a 118-94 victory for the Warriors in front of 15,025 at the 
Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Playing without injured Charles Smith and with Joe Wolf again getting three 
fouls in the first quarter, the Clippers went much of the way without two 
starters. That might explain why they had trouble inside against a team 
suddenly deep in 7-footers -- Uwe Blab and Alton Lister being off-season 
additions to complement Manute Bol. But that does nothing to explain 27 
turnovers or 40% shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors, who built a big lead and cruised for most of the second half, did 
everything they were unable to do on the season's first weekend. The Clippers, 
who never got into much of an offensive flow, served as outlets to Golden 
State's frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"They defensed us very well," Clipper Coach Don Casey said. "They took us out 
of a lot of stuff, and we're not very good at improvising right now." 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors, who lost Lister for at least six weeks, and perhaps the season, 
with a torn right Achilles' tendon in the third quarter, also made it tough for 
the Clippers with solid shooting. A 58.7% performance from the field turned out 
to be a good defense. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't run," guard Gary Grant said. "We're never going to run if we 
always have to take the ball out of the net." 
</P>
<P>
The Golden State reputation, shaky after blowout losses to open the season, 
regained its footing, as Chris Mullin made 12 of 18 shots for 32 points and 
Mitch Richmond added 21. The highest-scoring tandem in the league of 1988-89 
made like old times. 
</P>
<P>
So, too, did Michael Young. The 1984 first-round draft choice of the Boston 
Celtics who floated around the NBA and Continental Basketball Assn. since, has 
been a surprise so far. He had 19 points off the bench in the opener and 24 
points and 14 rebounds as a starter Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
At least for appearances, this was an important game for the Warriors. A 
similar showing against the Clippers could have sent a few people reaching for 
the life rafts. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State, after all, gave up 136 points in a season-opening loss to Phoenix 
and 132 in the home opener against Houston. To put that start in perspective, 
the Clippers, the league's third-worst defensive team team last season, gave up 
132 points or more six times in regulation games in all 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
"It was awful," Warrior Coach Don Nelson said after beating the Clippers for 
the sixth consecutive time at home. "I got into a mood like when I was at 
Milwaukee that now we've arrived and we could automatically add five or eight 
more wins and, 'Wouldn't it be wonderful to play like this all the time?' But 
that's not fair to this team. We've got a lot of good pieces, but they're not 
together yet." 
</P>
<P>
This was no time to panic, however. Not with the Clippers in town. 
</P>
<P>
The same team that had an emotional victory in its season opener showed little 
carry-over. Then again, the Clippers showed little of anything, particularly in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden State lead reached double figures with 10:52 to play in the half, 
34-24. After a 14-2 run over 4:04 of the second quarter, it was 18, 44-26 and, 
finally, 21 points, 55-34, on Richmond's layup with 3:13 remaining. By 
halftime, the Clippers trailed, 57-38. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers shot only 38.6% in the first half; the Warriors, 58.3%. Los 
Angeles shot 40% for the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers' early offense, came from Ken Norman, a likely source, and Young. 
Norman, who plays some of his best games against Golden State, had 14 points, 
and Young had 13. The other nine who played combined for 11 first-half points. 
</P>
<P>
Things continued at that pace the rest of the way. The Warriors had passed an 
unexpectedly critical test, but how much had they improved? 
</P>
<P>
Nelson saw great improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Casey saw lots of problems. 
</P>
<P>
"If we dig ourselves a hole, it's not easy to dig back out . . . particularly 
against a team like this who has five little guys who are difficult to trap," 
Casey said. "It had all the markings of a 30-, 40-, 50-point game." 
</P>
<P>
In that sense, at least, they got off easy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Just when his left wrist was finally healing, Ken Norman injured his right hand 
during a fall in the second half of the season opener against Houston. The 
Clippers' leading scorer last season said the second injury hasn't bothered him 
much in practices, even though it is his shooting hand. "I'm just thankful 
there was no game from Friday until now," he said. . . . Golden State's Marques 
Johnson, who made his first regular-season appearance against his former team, 
said there is no special motivation playing the Clippers. He had a drawn-out 
legal battle with the Clippers over compensation from a neck injury suffered 
when he bumped into Benoit Benjamin. "It was more so in the first exhibition 
game," said Johnson, who made the Warriors as a free agent. "Getting there (the 
Sports Arena) and rehashing that collision when I ran into Benoit. But now it's 
just a matter of going out to try and win." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Hardaway, the Warriors' first-round pick who struggled in the first two 
games, was hospitalized with tonsillitis. Winston Garland started in his place. 
. . . The Clippers' victory Friday was their first in a season opener since 
1985, when the team won five in a row.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE HAS A FEW WORDS FOR SENIOR UMPIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARR KLUENDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The main question for the new Senior Professional Baseball Assn. is not whether 
it will succeed, but whether it will survive Earl Weaver's presence. 
</P>
<P>
The league, for baseball players 35 and older, began play in Florida last week. 
Weaver, who was ejected 96 times as a major league manager, was kicked out 
Sunday during an argument with first-base umpire Barry Sholman. 
</P>
<P>
Weaver's Gold Coast Suns lost to West Palm Beach, 6-3, dropping their record to 
0-5. 
</P>
<P>
"We've played five out of 72," Weaver said. "I might get thrown out of the next 
67." 
</P>
<P>
How do the Senior League umpires compare to their major league counterparts? 
</P>
<P>
"These umpires are high school rejects," Weaver said. "The league went for the 
cheapest umpiring association. There should be no league if this continues. 
</P>
<P>
"We have retired major league umpires in the area. At least they know what a 
balk and a half-swing are." 
</P>
<P>
A dispute over those two calls led to Weaver's ejection Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Horrow, president of the league, said its umpires are from the Gulf Coast 
Umpires Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"I assure you they are the best available," Horrow said. "All the umpires have 
at least 15 years of experience, and the average umpire has five years in the 
minor leagues and in major league spring training." 
</P>
<P>
Magic act: Jan Hubbard of Newsday on the New York Knicks' 118-110 loss Monday 
night to the Orlando Magic: "So far, the Knicks have lost only to the world 
champion Pistons and Magic. And Magic has beaten a lot of teams. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately for (Coach Stu) Jackson, the Knicks lost to the wrong Magic -- 
not Johnson, but Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, despite the loss, Knick fans should be encouraged about Jackson's 
head-coaching future because he is a coach who looks at the future and cowers, 
which is a sign of greatness. And he was like that before the game Monday 
night. The best NBA coaches fear failure, fear the opposition, fear 
expectations and fear fear. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a healthy way to feel. When a head coach is scared of everyone, he takes 
no one for granted. The only trick is to convey that fear to the players, and 
have them listen. Jackson told them the Magic would play hard. The Knicks 
apparently didn't listen." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Michael Dokes, who will fight Lionel Washington at the Forum next 
Monday night, registered the second-quickest heavyweight championship victory 
when his bout against Mike Weaver on Dec. 10, 1982 was stopped after 1 minute 3 
seconds. What was the quickest bout in a heavyweight championship fight? 
</P>
<P>
Taking the initiative? San Franciscans voted Tuesday on whether a new ballpark 
should replace Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
Citing a $12,500 campaign gift to opponents of a new ballpark from a contractor 
who worked on Arco Arena in Sacramento, San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos accused 
Sacramento developer Gregg Lukenbill of trying to steal the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
The Sacramento Bee quoted Argos: "We haven't had any looting after the 
earthquake until now." 
</P>
<P>
Lukenbill, owner of the Sacramento Kings and leader of efforts to bring a major 
league baseball team to that city, denied any involvement in the San Francisco 
ballpark initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to have to live with the things he's saying and doing now for the 
rest of his career," Lukenbill said of Agnos. "I'm not concerned with that." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco District Attorney Arlo Smith said he might start a grand jury 
investigation into the charges; the initiative appeared headed for defeat late 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Jim Jeffries knocked out Jack Finnegan in 55 seconds on April 6, 
1900. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Coach Jerry Tarkanian of Nevada Las Vegas, before playing a touring 
Soviet team that lost two players to the NBA: "Sure, some of their good players 
aren't on the team anymore, but they've got the whole rest of the country to 
pick from." GARR KLUENDER

ROHR POSTS 1ST-QUARTER LOSS OF $11 MILLION, LAYS OFF 500 WORKERS 
</P>

CHULA VISTA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blaming changes in government requirements that caused a slowdown in deliveries 
of its aerospace products, Rohr Industries reported an $11.4-million loss 
Tuesday for its first quarter. The Chula Vista-based manufacturer also said it 
has laid off nearly 500 employees, or 4% of its work force, since Aug. 1 in an 
effort to trim overhead. 
</P>
<P>
The loss, which came on revenue of $234.5 million, generally surprised 
investment analysts, and Rohr stock dropped $2.50 to close at $21.25 in New 
York Stock Exchange trading Tuesday. Rohr shares have traded as high as $37.875 
over the last year. Over the same quarter last year, Rohr made a profit of $7.8 
million on sales of $224.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
Rohr spokesman Dick Dalton declined comment on whether Rohr plans more layoffs, 
saying that Rohr does "no projecting of employment levels." The layoffs over 
the last three months were necessary, he said, because Rohr expects to see a 
"leveling off" of sales in coming months after a two-year period of rapid 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 483 Rohr employees who lost their jobs recently, 211 worked at Rohr's 
Chula Vista plant, mainly in hourly manufacturing and on the assembly line, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although it makes a variety of jet aircraft components, Rohr's biggest-selling 
products are nacelles, or pods that house jet engines. About 75% of Rohr's 
aircraft components are sold to commercial aircraft manufacturers and the rest 
to makers of military jets. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, the boon in commercial aircraft orders, a highly 
cyclical business, has caused sales, payroll and plant space at Rohr and other 
U.S. aerospace manufacturers to grow rapidly. Even after the recent layoffs, 
Rohr's current payroll of 11,700 is up significantly from 8,000 workers two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But Rohr's profits have often disappointed Wall Street analysts, leading them 
to question the efficiency with which Rohr is handling its growth. Spokesman 
Dick Dalton blamed the recent quarter's loss mainly on added government 
paper-work requirements that he said have stalled components for military 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Lloyd-Butler, a vice president and analyst with Montgomery Securities in 
San Francisco, said that Rohr's first-quarter loss was "very unexpected" and 
that he is "afraid that the cycle in commercial aircraft orders will be over 
before this company turns a profit. Then they'll really be hurting." 
</P>
<P>
For the fiscal year ended July 31, Rohr reported a profit of $33.5 million on 
sales of $1.045 billion, compared with a profit of $32.5 million on sales of 
$907 million for the previous fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Demisch, managing parter at UBS Securities in New York, said the loss 
demonstrates that there are margin pressures in Rohr's commercial aircraft 
business and that "things will be a little bit tougher." 
</P>
<P>
"Rohr is digesting an unexpectedly huge surge in commercial orders and the 
supply of labor and material is a lot tighter than expected," Demisch said. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd-Butler said he is particularly concerned about the high debt that Rohr 
has taken on to finance its growth. Rohr's interest expense for the quarter 
ended Oct. 30 was $10.7 million, up from $5.6 million the year before. 
</P>
<P>
"If the company is unable to be profitable in both is its commercial and 
military lines of business and generate enough cash to service its debt, they 
are going to go into the . . . downturn of the commercial aircraft cycle in 
very precarious position," Lloyd-Butler said.

has been restated to comply with new life insurance accounting rules, which 
reduced net income by $6.2 million for the year-ago period. Revenue totaled 
$605.1 million, up 14%. The Los Angeles firm attributed results in part to 
increased sales of annuities and guaranteed investment credits.

Rohr Industries: The supplier of jet engine nacelles reported a third-quarter 
loss of $11.4 million, contrasted with a profit of $7.8 million a year ago. 
Sales rose 4% to $234.5 million. The Chula Vista firm attributed the loss to 
four factors, the first two of which it said were non-recurring: additional 
costs due to redefined acceptance criteria on government contracts, commercial 
contract cost performance, program mix changes and increased interest expense.

ABC PUTS THE LID ON JACKIE MASON AND 'CHICKEN SOUP'; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: DESPITE ITS ENVIABLE TIME SLOT FOLLOWING HIGHLY RATED "ROSEANNE," 
THE CONTROVERSIAL SITCOM LOST A THIRD OF ITS LEAD-IN AUDIENCE AND TOOK A 
DRUBBING FROM CRITICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KAYE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
You're a programming executive at ABC and you're wondering what to do with your 
new show, "Chicken Soup." Let's see. It's the highest-rated new show of the 
season, ranking consistently in the top 15 each week. 
</P>
<P>
You decide to cancel it. 
</P>
<P>
That's exactly what ABC did Tuesday, pulling the plug on the high-rated Jackie 
Mason-Lynn Redgrave sitcom about a romance between an Irish-Catholic woman and 
a Jewish man. 
</P>
<P>
But the cancellation was not as far-fetched as it might seem on the surface 
and, in fact, came as no surprise to the show's producers or TV industry 
observers. The ratings were misleading; the show was a flop. 
</P>
<P>
With the most enviable time slot in television behind the top-rated "Roseanne" 
on Tuesday night, the audience drop-off for "Chicken Soup" was unacceptable to 
ABC executives. Every week, millions of "Roseanne" viewers would change the 
channel as "Chicken Soup" came on. Last week, "Chicken Soup" lost one-third of 
Roseanne's audience -- more than 7.2 million households. 
</P>
<P>
Had the series been a critical success, the network might have kept it on the 
schedule, perhaps moving it to another time period, industry executives said. 
But the show had taken a drubbing from the critics and had been criticized by 
Jewish organizations as supporting unfair stereotypes. In addition, Mason was 
criticized for racial remarks he made while campaigning for New York mayoral 
aspirant Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing "Chicken Soup" at 9:30 p.m. on Tuesdays, beginning Nov. 21, will be 
"Coach," a second-year sitcom starring Craig T. Nelson as a college football 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
ABC Entertainment President Robert Iger praised the show and it makers in a 
statement released Tuesday. But he added, "We feel obliged competitively to 
maximize the strength of our programming in that time period, since Tuesday 
night is our key night. Clearly we're disappointed that 'Chicken Soup' did not 
fulfill that objective." 
</P>
<P>
The network's executives were under strict orders not to discuss the 
cancellation Tuesday. But they had maintained since the show's debut Sept. 12 
that they were waiting to see if it would catch on. 
</P>
<P>
"Chicken Soup's" odd status of getting axed despite solid ratings -- it ranks 
13th among the 92 prime-time series that have aired on the four networks this 
season -- was not unprecedented. In fact, it followed the strikingly similar 
circumstances of "Bridget Loves Bernie," a 1972-73 sitcom about the romance 
between a Catholic woman and a Jewish man. Although that program ranked fifth 
for the year, attracting 39% of the audience, CBS canceled it, saying that it 
was losing too many viewers from "All in the Family," which preceded it and 
which was drawing 53% of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
ABC informed "Chicken Soup" executive producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner of 
the cancellation at a meeting Monday. They, in turn, notified the cast and 
crew.

Two Steps Back: How are women portrayed in the 26 new television shows that 
bowed this fall? "From mediocre to awful" is the verdict in a report scheduled 
to be released today at the 11th annual Women at Work Broadcast Awards luncheon 
in Washington. The report, titled "Two Steps Back," was issued by the National 
Commission on Working Women of Wider Opportunities for Women. Actress Linda 
Lavin, a NCWW commissioner who will host the luncheon, says, "At best, the new 
season has given us the status quo. At worse, television has taken a step 
backward from the progress it made last year." Only two shows received good 
marks -- "Life Goes On" (ABC) and "Alien Nation" (Fox). "Major Dad" (CBS), and 
the already canceled "Chicken Soup" (ABC) and "The People Next Door" were 
criticized for "straining viewer credibility." The report said "Doogie Howser" 
(ABC), "Baywatch" (NBC) and "Living Dolls" (ABC) indicate that "double 
entendres and smarmy sex" are still part of the TV picture. ALEENE MacMINN

Bellows Settles Suit: James Bellows, former managing editor of "USA Today on 
TV," has settled his $1.8 million lawsuit against GTE East, a branch of GTG 
Entertainment that makes the syndicated series. Terms were not disclosed but 
the settlement was described as amicable by both sides. Bellows, 66, was hired 
in October 1988 under a two-year contract paying him $275,000 a year, and left 
in March to help develop a new program for GTG. His lawsuit, filed Oct. 2 in 
U.S. District Court, alleged he was fired Sept. 26 without cause, justification 
or warning. ALEENE MacMINN

ORCHESTRA OF 18TH CENTURY AIMS TO SURPRISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some conductors aim for glory. Others collide with it. 
</P>
<P>
Frans Bruggen, who for years was a full-time recorder virtuoso and now conducts 
his internationally mixed, 8-year-old Orchestra of the 18th Century in concerts 
around the world, didn't start out to be a podium figure. 
</P>
<P>
"It just happened," the Dutch musician recalled on the phone from Minnesota, 
where he was guesting with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra preparatory to 
beginning his latest North American tour, which starts tonight at 8 in Los 
Angeles. The 40-member ensemble plays at the Orpheum Theater as part of the 
Chamber Music in Historic Sites series. 
</P>
<P>
A lifelong interest in original instruments culminated for Bruggen when he 
founded the Orchestra of the 18th Century in 1981. After steady expansion, he 
said, the group now makes two tours a season -- "This year, 22 concerts in each 
segment." 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot do more, because our members, who come from 15 different countries, 
mostly in Western Europe, have other commitments." 
</P>
<P>
The specialty of the ensemble is, of course, music of the mid-18th Century. The 
Mozart program Bruggen will lead at the Orpheum will contain the "Linz" and 
40th (G-minor) symphonies and the Sinfonia Concertante for four solo winds and 
orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Does Bruggen look forward to further expansion, into other repertories or 
centuries? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, no," he answered. "You could be busy all of your life on the music of this 
one period. There is no need to look beyond." 
</P>
<P>
Clarity is the main gain, connoisseurs say, when music of the 18th Century is 
performed on instruments built between 1750 and 1760 -- valveless brass, wooden 
flutes, strings and harpsichord. 
</P>
<P>
"Merely the act of playing this repertory on these instruments produces the 
sound audiences must have heard at the time," Bruggen noted. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, we have studied how it was done then, but the instruments 
themselves seem to create the style. It is a sound at the same time less 
massive but more aggressive than modern ears are used to. The instruments 
operate at a softer volume, yet there is more attack in the sound. There is no 
plushness. Surprise is the best word to describe how it affects the listener."

JAZZ NOTES: THE PIANISTS WHO TAUGHT THE BRIDGES BOYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How did Beau and Jeff Bridges learn to look like they were pros for their film 
roles as piano-playing brothers in "The Fabulous Baker Boys"? 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Joyce Collins, who makes one of her occasional nightclub dates tonight 
at Le Cafe in Sherman Oaks, and Lou Forestieri, who backs singer Lois Bolieau 
at the same venue Friday and Saturday, taught the Bridges brothers high-level 
lounge piano from September, 1988, to February, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Beau was a wonderful pupil -- he'd get up at 5 in the morning to practice," 
said Collins, who teaches at the Grove School of Music and whose latest LP is 
"Moment to Moment" (Discovery). We took it piece by piece, starting slowly and 
working up to tempo." 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff is very talented, and has a fondness for all kinds of music, not just 
jazz," said Forestieri, referring to the Bill Evans-ish piano Jeff Bridges 
plays in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
Both brothers studied a videotape that showed the hands of pianists Dave 
Grusin, the film's musical director, and John Hammond. Grusin and Hammond 
recorded the sound track, which was played back while the Bridgeses were filmed 
playing dummy instruments (which look real but make no sound), a practice 
called "sidelining." In one scene, however, it is Jeff Bridges playing a moody, 
unaccompanied piece in an empty resort lounge. 
</P>
<P>
"This music was very hard and they did a great job," said Collins, "and even 
though they sidelined, they still had to know how to play. I think they looked 
fabulous." No pun intended. 
</P>
<P>
To offset medical expenses incurred by his wife, LaVerne, Bay Area pianist 
Andrew Hill will play a solo recital Saturday at the Sherman Clay Steinway 
Hall, 3330 Wilshire Blvd., at 8 p.m. Hill is highly regarded for such early 
'60s classics as "Point of Departure"; his latest release is "Eternal Spirit" 
(both Blue Note). Those unable to attend Hill's concert may send donations to 
Cedars-Sinai Comprehensive Cancer Center, LaVerne Hill Patient Activity 
Account, 8700 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles 90048. Information: (213) 384-1858. 
</P>
<P>
The melodic-bent vibist Bobby Hutcherson, who has appeared on several Hill LPs 
through the years, including "Eternal Spirit," also drops in from the Bay Area 
for a quartet date Friday and Saturday at Marla's Memory Lane. 
</P>
<P>
On the heels of the brand new "Ambos Mundos" (Landmark), a blend of acoustic 
jazz and Afro-Cuban rhythms, Hutcherson will play "some old stuff and some new 
stuff" for this date, which finds him working with his son, Barry, on drums, 
bassist Larry Gales and pianist extraordinaire Billy Childs. 
</P>
<P>
The vibist, whom many remember from his role in Bertrand Tavernier's "Round 
Midnight," is particularly enthusiastic about Marla's Memory Lane, because of 
actress/singer/owner Marla Gibbs. "She's very in tune to what's going on," said 
Hutcherson. And when I perform, she always comes down to the club. That's a 
pleasure."

CALIFORNIA COMPOSERS IN SPOTLIGHT AT GINDI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Californian composers were the focal point of Monday night's Los Angeles 
Philharmonic Chamber Music Society concert at Gindi Auditorium. And, sure 
enough, it was this native music that received the most sympathetic and 
idiomatic readings. 
</P>
<P>
The exotic and inventive Varied Trio (1986) for violin, piano and percussion by 
the Northern California-based Lou Harrison opened the concert. 
</P>
<P>
In this engaging five-movement, 15-minute work, Harrison's simple, repetitive 
melodies and harmonies are given subtle, soft color through an imaginative 
variety of instruments and techniques. The mechanical flavor of the pulsating 
second movement is captured by the use of violin pizzicato, a mallet thumping 
on the wood of the piano and chopsticks clanking against water-filled rice 
bowls. 
</P>
<P>
The finale is a rambunctious Middle Eastern dance -- Igor Stravinsky in Baghdad 
-- using tambourines, tom-toms and, effectively, baker pans. Philharmonic 
veterans Raynor Carroll (percussion), Zita Carno (piano) and Rochelle Abramson 
(violin) performed with attentive bravado and calm assurance. 
</P>
<P>
Ingolf Dahl, who spent the greater part of his life teaching at USC, was the 
other Californian represented. 
</P>
<P>
His "Concerto a Tre" for violin, cello and clarinet is a playful bit of 1940s 
neo-classicism a la Stravinsky. David Howard, exceptional on clarinet, 
violinist Barry Socher and cellist Gloria Lum were the crackerjack soloists. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-climactic closer was a poorly tuned, scrappily played rendition of the 
Piano Quintet, Opus 81, by the non-Californian Dvorak.TIMOTHY MANGAN

CICCOLINI PLAYS ALL-LISZT PROGRAM AT ROYCE HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a gamble for pianist Aldo Ciccolini to play what he did Saturday night 
at Royce Hall. All-Liszt programs are rare these days, and certainly 
out-of-fashion. Add the fact that the program included not a single popular or 
familiar work by Liszt and you begin to have an idea of the magnitude of his 
wager. 
</P>
<P>
Liszt's 'Harmonies poetiques et religieuses," an extended 10-part collection 
virtually never performed in its entirety, was the solitary work on the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Pondered, composed and revised over a considerable span of time, from 1834-53, 
"Harmonies" was inspired by the religious poetry of Lamartine, some of which is 
quoted in the score. The work is unified not by thematic transformation, as in 
Liszt's later works, but by the all-encompassing devotional and serious 
expression of its ideas. 
</P>
<P>
The music shuns empty virtuosity. It builds toward momentous climaxes only to 
break out into noble hymns and solemn orations. "Funerailles," the best-known 
piece in the collection, mounts to a shattering, Mahlerian funeral march. 
Prayers -- a "Pater Noster," an "Ave Maria," simple transcriptions of choral 
works -- dot the score. It's somber, earnest music. 
</P>
<P>
Ciccolini approached the work with utter conviction and technical finesse. 
Though the music often reaches grandiose heights, he wasn't one for 
histrionics. 
</P>
<P>
And it worked. Liszt's sprawling score came vividly to life, its inspirational 
content devoutly rendered by Ciccolini, no apologies. The work deserves more 
hearings, and that was precisely Ciccolini's point.TIMOTHY MANGAN

ROAD TAX FALLS BEHIND IN EARLY SANTA CLARITA VALLEY RETURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A tax initiative to raise $285 million to build and improve roads in the Santa 
Clarita Valley appeared to be headed for an overwhelming defeat in early 
election returns Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
But supporters of the tax held out hope that last-minute campaigning and 
endorsements from a host of firefighter and law enforcement organizations would 
win them the two-thirds majority needed to pass the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Measure P would add between $75 and $200 to annual residential property tax 
bills for all property in Santa Clarita and in most of the surrounding 
unincorporated valley. Commercial and industrial property would pay 7 1/2 cents 
per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
The battle over Measure P pitted many the valley's leading citizens -- 
including City Council members, well-known civic volunteers and business owners 
-- against a ragtag group of political unknowns who waged a campaign relying 
mostly on volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
The Roads Now Committee, bolstered by contributions from developers and 
construction firms, raised $86,000 to push the road-building measure. The 
opposition group, known as SMRT for Stop Mello-Roos Tax, raised only $1,900, 
according to campaign finance reports. 
</P>
<P>
John Machin, a SMRT spokesman, said the early returns showed that a grass-roots 
movement could battle big money. Laurene Weste, a member of the Roads Now 
Committee, said that if Measure P does fail, motorists will be the real losers. 
"We'll continue to sit in traffic jams." 
</P>
<P>
The Roads Now Committee, which hired a political consultant and sent 40,000 
mailers to voters, made a last-minute push Tuesday. About 30 volunteers worked 
a phone bank at the group's campaign headquarters, reminding Measure P 
supporters to vote. 
</P>
<P>
In other valley elections, 42 candidates sought 20 vacancies on school boards 
overseeing seven rapidly growing school systems. 
</P>
<P>
* In the Newhall School District, early returns showed a close race between 
incumbents Pat Willett, Howard L. Hill and Charles E. Payne and challengers 
Zandra B. Stanley, Michael McCabe and Leon Worden. Stanley led a field that was 
separated by a handful of votes. 
</P>
<P>
* The race was equally tight in the Saugus Union Elementary School District 
where Eileen Connolly, a self-described "concerned parent," was leading the 
field. Close behind were incumbents Marilynn K. Blaylock, Betty L. Lund and 
Michael E. Rayfield. Trailing were Antonio M. Martino and Ralph Wilkin. 
</P>
<P>
* At least one new trustee was to be elected in the Sulphur Springs School 
District, where only two incumbents -- Art Wilde and Scott Seamons -- sought 
reelection. Kerry Clegg, a research biologist at Cal State Northridge, was 
leading newcomers Rob Werner and Bill Rattazzi. 
</P>
<P>
* A community volunteer and former PTA president, Jane Pederson, was ahead in 
early balloting for three seats on the board of the Castaic Union School 
District. Trailing were incumbents David E. Worthington, Irene L. Massey and 
Gloria E. Mercado. 
</P>
<P>
* Seven candidates sought two seats on the board of the Santa Clarita Community 
College District, which oversees College of the Canyons. Challengers Andrew 
Martin and Ernest Moreno were leading John D. Hoskinson, the incumbent in Seat 
1. Trailing Hoskinson was Nancy Neff. For Seat 3, incumbent Linda C. Cubbage 
was well ahead of Dan Brown and Donald Gaskin. 
</P>
<P>
* At least two new trustees were elected in the 1,500-student Soledad-Agua 
Dulce School District, where two incumbents did not seek new terms. Nancy 
Kelso, the lone incumbent, led a field that was separated by just a few votes. 
Also running, in order of the most votes, were Ronnie Garner, Laurie Browning, 
Rebecca Ann Small, Jo Ann Baker, Timothy Millen and Mark Samskar. 
</P>
<P>
* In the tiny Hughes-Elizabeth Lake Union School District, high in the Angeles 
National Forest, the early leaders were incumbent Lola J. Skelton Mantooth, Sue 
Page, a teacher, and Steve Nemback, a water plant operator. Trailing were 
Robert Janssen, Wayne Prindle and two incumbents, Richard Lewis and Bryant D. 
Swenson.

CAR-REPAIR SHOP EXPANSION OKD DESPITE PROTESTS; 
</P>
<P>
ZONING: RESIDENTS OF A NORTH HOLLYWOOD AREA FAIL IN THEIR ATTEMPTS TO USE A NEW 
LAW TO DRIVE THE SHOP AND OTHERS LIKE IT OUT OF THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
City zoning officials on Tuesday approved expansion of a North Hollywood 
auto-repair shop, dealing a blow to residential neighbors hoping to force the 
business and others nearby to move from the area. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Zoning Appeals voted unanimously to grant owner Wayne 
Durose a conditional use permit to expand his business at 11307 Burbank Blvd., 
provided that he met certain conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Durose, who wants to knock down a 41-year-old garage and build a larger 
facility, must perform all work inside the new building, ensure that his 
customers' cars are not illegally parked on residential side streets and close 
early on Saturdays. The board limited work at the shop to mechanical repairs 
and prohibited Durose from continuing to perform auto-body repairs, including 
spray-painting cars, which residents said releases fumes in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"I reluctantly, with great misgivings, conclude we are better off" with the 
proposed development than with the older facility, where spray-painting and 
auto-body work was performed, said Joseph D. Mandel, board vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
But neighbors said they will appeal to the City Council, which has final say 
over the proposal. Residents said the proposal's defeat would send a message to 
other business owners in the area to move out. About five residents testified 
Tuesday at the hearing, and the board received letters from several others. 
</P>
<P>
They said they have complained for years about fumes and noise from the 
auto-body shops lining Burbank Boulevard between Lankershim Boulevard and 
Vineland Avenue and are taking advantage of a new city ordinance to contest 
Durose's expansion. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, passed in February to protect residential neighborhoods, 
requires public hearings on development proposals from auto-related businesses 
within 300 feet of residences. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, we have a choice, and we want a better quality of living," 
said Maria Fant, a longtime area resident. "There's no fresh air to be had on 
Martha Street now, and the noise is unmerciful. If they allow the facility, 
we'll have 10 times the problem." 
</P>
<P>
But board members said the proposal appeared to be an improvement over the 
existing business, which Durose wants to expand from 3,000 to about 5,000 
square feet. Their action reversed a decision in August by Zoning Administrator 
Robert Janovici, who had sided with neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Durose has modified his proposal, agreeing to set the new building 
back five feet from residences and plant a landscape buffer, lower the 
building's height to 19 feet, evict a tenant who had been cited for 
spray-painting outdoors in violation of the law and stop all auto-body work at 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman James D. Leewong did not attend Tuesday's meeting.

HARRISON, LEWIS IN TIGHT RACE FOR THOUSAND OAKS COUNCIL SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Planning commissioner Bob Lewis appeared to be edging out former planning 
commissioner K. Reed Harrison in Tuesday's special Thousand Oaks City Council 
election, and incumbents appeared to be leading in races for the Conejo Valley 
and Moorpark Unified School districts, according to early Ventura County 
election returns. 
</P>
<P>
In the Thousand Oaks City Council race, Lewis was leading Harrison, another 
attorney, and both were walloping six other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
In the Conejo Valley school board race, incumbents Mildred Lynch, William Henry 
Jr. and Dorothy Beaubien were in the lead. Richard (Dick) Newman, a Conejo 
Recreation and Parks commissioner, seemed to be capturing a fourth opening on 
the five-member board. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark school board incumbent Lynda Kira also appeared to be leading in a 
six-person race for two seats, followed by city parks commissioner Sam K. 
Nainoa. 
</P>
<P>
In countywide races, the son of Supervisor John Flynn -- Timothy Flynn -- was 
falling behind opponent Pete Tafoya in a close race for a Community College 
Board seat. And in the county Board of Education race, a retired teacher from 
Simi Valley, Al Rosen, was leading veteran incumbent Fauvette Bean Rollyson. 
</P>
<P>
The early returns were based on absentee ballots and mailed-in votes. 
</P>
<P>
In an election season generally lacking in controversy, the Moorpark school 
board race pitted Kira against candidate Pamela Castro, who used a 1988 recall 
movement as a springboard for her own campaign. Kira was one of the four school 
board members that Castro, a day-care center owner, tried to recall. 
</P>
<P>
The other candidates were: construction supervisor John G. Roberts, college 
professor Thomas Bryan and finance executive James D. Stueck. 
</P>
<P>
In other Ventura County elections: 
</P>
<P>
* Eight candidates competed for the unexpired Thousand Oaks City Council seat 
of Lee Laxdal, who moved to Australia last summer. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates were: former sales manager Grant W. Peterson; construction 
supervisor Gregory Lance Spencer; financial consultant Jim Donovan; handicapped 
rights activist Phyllis Ellis; homeowners representative Elois Zeanah; and auto 
mechanic Norm "Blackie" Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
* Ten candidates vied for four full, four-year terms on the Conejo Valley 
Unified School Board, and two competed for an unexpired term vacated last year. 
The district serves Thousand Oaks, Newbury Park and the Ventura County portion 
of Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
Those challenging incumbents for the Conejo school board were: contractor Vance 
(Skip) Rodgers; retired police lieutenant and Conejo parks and recreation 
commissioner Newman; engineer Charles Rittenburg; dental supply salesman Chuck 
Castaing; mother and computer programmer Jeanie Mortensen Savage; mother Martha 
deBurgh; Compton police detective Michael Sean Markey and computer programmer 
Ken Penchos. 
</P>
<P>
Retired teacher Beaubien and small business owner Thomas Murphy vied separately 
for an unexpired term that ends in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
* In the race to represent Oxnard and Port Hueneme on the Ventura County 
College Board of Education, engineer Tafoya, 40, provided some fireworks by 
accusing account executive Flynn, 30, of exploiting the political experience of 
his father. 
</P>
<P>
The junior Flynn, meanwhile, described Tafoya's charges as "a desperate measure 
by a dying campaign." 
</P>
<P>
In the race for the college board's Thousand Oaks seat, dentist Gregory Cole, 
38, of Newbury Park, held a hefty lead against attorney Joel Bryan, 36, of 
Thousand Oaks, according to early returns. 
</P>
<P>
The college board oversees campuses in Ventura, Oxnard and Moorpark that serve 
33,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
* In the county Board of Education election, incumbents Robert Viles and 
Doylenne Johnson ran unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
Rollyson was challenged for the first time in 15 years by Rosen. 
</P>
<P>
The county school board oversees 1,400 students with a budget of $34 million.

ANTELOPE VALLEY VOTERS REELECT INCUMBENTS, ADD SOME NEW FACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Voters in the Antelope Valley went to the polls Tuesday to decide a spate of 
local school races, electing new members to college, high school and elementary 
district boards in the area but also retaining many incumbents in the mostly 
low-profile races. 
</P>
<P>
The most closely watched race came in the strife-torn Lancaster School 
District, where early returns showed three incumbents -- Richard White, Melinda 
White and Michael Huggins -- struggling to fend off four opponents, including 
one who is the wife of the district's recently ousted superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
In other contests, voters were deciding whether to reelect two incumbents in 
both the Antelope Valley Community College District and the Antelope Valley 
Union High School District, while also filling a vacant third seat in each 
district. In the Palmdale School District, meanwhile, three contenders were 
vying for an open seat. 
</P>
<P>
In the 10,700-student Lancaster School District, early returns showed a very 
close race. Board president Richard White, a former district principal elected 
four years ago, was seeking a second term. Incumbents Melinda White (who is not 
related to Richard) and Huggins, who defeated incumbents to win office in a 
bitter February recall election, also were seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
They are being challenged by Maridelle Wright, the wife of former 
superintendent E. Jarold Wright, who was dismissed by the present board in 
July; Parent Teacher Assn. President Jacki Pendleton; air traffic controller 
Joseph Starling, and structural mechanic Keith Wilde. 
</P>
<P>
In the 8,600-student Antelope Valley Community College District, board 
president James Du Pratt Jr. and Herman Kicenski both appeared headed toward 
wins. Du Pratt is a high school teacher elected in 1985, while Kicenski is a 
Lancaster physician who has served on the board since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
The election contest focused on the two challengers seeking a third seat, which 
was vacated by Lynda Gloyd. Seeking to succeed her was Betty Lou Nash, a former 
spokeswoman for the college who held an early lead over Felix Le Marinel, a 
Palmdale insurance agent. 
</P>
<P>
In the nearly 9,800-student Antelope Valley Union High School District, board 
president William Olenick was trailing in early returns, while colleague Larry 
Rucker was headed for his third term. A third seat, vacated by incumbent Bob 
McMullen, drew five challengers into the at-large election. 
</P>
<P>
The other two early leaders were Agua Dulce homemaker Sophia Waugh and Steve 
Landaker, a Palmdale billboard executive. Trailing candidates were Phil Maher, 
a Palmdale phone company manager who tried four years ago; Daniel Fricke, a 
school police officer; and David Von Buskirk, a court financial officer. Fricke 
and Von Buskirk both ran unsuccessfully in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
* In the Palmdale School District, incumbents Velma Trosin, Fay Harrington and 
Frederick Thompson were unchallenged and were automatically reelected. That 
left only a contest among three Palmdale residents seeking to fill the two 
years remaining in the term of Susan Moulton, who resigned in June. Early 
returns showed retired aerospace engineer Dan Hunter in the lead, followed by 
teacher Sheldon Epstein and general contractor F. Don Linde. 
</P>
<P>
* In the Westside Union School District, six candidates -- two incumbents and 
four challengers -- were vying for three at-large seats. Incumbents Lynne 
Murley and Charles Strole were running against challengers Chuck Brandel, 
Howard Brooks, Sandra Engebretson and Larry Lindner. 
</P>
<P>
* In the Eastside Union School District, five candidates -- one incumbent and 
four challengers -- were seeking three seats. Incumbent Martha Johnson was 
joined in the race by challengers Lee Doughty, Gary Holmes, Larry Lake and 
Michael Terry. 
</P>
<P>
* In the Keppel Union School District, seven candidates -- three incumbents and 
four challengers -- were vying for three seats. The incumbents are Patricia 
Conner, Jerry Freeman and Robert Jones. The challengers are Michael Dutton, 
Valorie Gorny, Claudia Moore and Richard Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
* In the Wilsona School District, five candidates -- two incumbents and three 
challengers -- were running for three seats. Incumbents Luis Easterwood and Sue 
Stokka were competing against Frank Donaldson Sr., Michael Brown and Richard 
Foster.

6 IN NARROW RACE FOR 3 AGOURA HILLS SEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Six candidates were locked in a close race Tuesday for three seats on the 
Agoura Hills City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbents Darlene McBane, Fran Pavley and Jack W. Koenig were seeking 
reelection against three challengers. The top three vote-getters of the six 
will be elected. 
</P>
<P>
Early returns showed no candidate assured of victory or far out of contention. 
The early leaders were Pavley and challengers Ed Kurtz and Paul G. (Gary) 
Mueller. McBane, Koenig and challenger Barry S. Steinhardt followed. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig's frequent, sometimes personal differences with his four City Council 
colleagues have made his political style a campaign issue in the city of 
20,200. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig, who has sometimes referred to the four women council members as "the 
girls," was accused last month of helping foster a recall drive against the 
four. He denied involvement in the recall, but the incident alienated some of 
his former supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig was elected in 1985 with the support of a group known as For Agoura '85. 
This year, For Agoura '89 -- which Koenig claimed was different than the 1985 
group -- endorsed McBane and Pavley but dropped Koenig from its slate. The 
group endorsed challenger Kurtz over Koenig. 
</P>
<P>
McBane, a former city planning commissioner, also was elected in 1985. She 
presently holds the title of mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Pavley, a teacher at a Moorpark middle school, has served on the council since 
the city's 1982 incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
Kurtz is a past chairman of a citizens' advisory committee on parks and 
recreation and has coached youth sports. He runs a promotional advertising 
company in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
Mueller is a former president of the Agoura-Las Virgenes Chamber of Commerce 
and owner of an auto parts store in Agoura Hills. Steinhardt is a securities 
representative.

KLOVE, EMMONS, YARROW TAKE EARLY LEAD IN WESTLAKE VILLAGE CITY COUNCIL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Early election returns in Westlake Village showed incumbent City Councilman 
Irwin A. Shane trailing five other candidates Tuesday in a race for three seats 
on the council. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbents Shane and Bonnie Klove sought reelection to the Westlake Village 
City Council, but Mayor Franklin D. Pelletier declined to run again. 
</P>
<P>
Four challengers entered the race for the three at-large seats. They are former 
City Manager James E. Emmons, vocational education teacher Sybil Nisenholz, 
office manager Joanne Robinson and homeowner association president Douglas R. 
Yarrow. 
</P>
<P>
Emmons, Klove and Yarrow were the early leaders, followed by Nisenholz, 
Robinson and Shane. 
</P>
<P>
Emmons, the town's city manager from 1982 to 1988, was considered by many in 
Westlake Village to be a strong contender for the seat left open by Pelletier's 
departure. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake Village voters also were being asked to approve an initiative to raise 
the city's constitutional spending limit, a measure city officials have said is 
necessary to finance a planned new library and city hall. The early returns 
showed overwhelming voter support for the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Klove and Shane were seeking their third terms on the council. Yarrow said he 
viewed Shane as the more vulnerable of the two. 
</P>
<P>
The principal issue in the campaign has been Westlake North, a 131-acre 
development project proposed for vacant land north of the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
A majority of the five-member council -- Klove, Shane, and Pelletier -- have 
said they want to make a decision on Westlake North next week, before any new 
council members take office. 
</P>
<P>
If Shane is defeated, and the council does not postpone the matter, the 
decision would be made by a council with two lame-duck members. 
</P>
<P>
The project is being proposed by Westlake Village Associates, a firm run by 
Daniel K. Ludwig. It would include about 1.5 million square feet of office 
space. Ludwig recently scaled back the project slightly, reducing the maximum 
building height from six stories to five and cutting the number of multifamily 
housing units from 400 to 250. 
</P>
<P>
But the project has remained controversial. 
</P>
<P>
Klove and Shane were elected after the city's 1981 incorporation. Yarrow,

NEWBURY PARK GEARS FOR RIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly a decade has passed since Newbury Park won a Marmonte League title. And, 
even in 1981, the Panthers could not interrupt the aura of Thousand Oaks, the 
neighborhood bully down the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
In the final regular-season game that year, Newbury Park soundly defeated the 
Lancers and for its effort shared the championship -- with Thousand Oaks. Since 
then, Thousand Oaks has won or shared three more titles and is on the verge of 
its fifth of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park, in the meantime, made the playoffs in each of the first seven 
years of the '80s before its recent dry spell of two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
But there has been just one league championship. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks and Newbury Park will meet again Thursday night with Marmonte 
honors in the balance. The Lancers are 8-0-1, 5-0 in league play. Newbury Park 
is 6-1-2, 4-0-1. 
</P>
<P>
George Hurley, in his first year as Newbury Park head coach but his 18th as 
part of the program, figures now is as good a time as any to shake up the 
Lancers and shed Newbury Park's image as the "ugly stepsister." 
</P>
<P>
"Our kids got kind of tired reading about how good their defense is," said 
Hurley, who has a pretty good one himself. "(My players) want to prove there 
are . . . other schools in this valley. 
</P>
<P>
"And they deserve to play in this championship game." 
</P>
<P>
Add Marmonte: Speaking of schools in the Conejo Valley, Newbury Park and 
Thousand Oaks are joined by Westlake in the Division II playoffs -- the 
Warriors' first playoff appearance since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
First-year Coach Jim Benkert was able to rally the Warriors despite an 0-3 
start in which the defense yielded 116 points. Westlake won three of its next 
six games and tied another, primarily because the defense came together in a 
7-3 league-opening win over Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that was the turning point," Benkert said. "I've been saying all along 
that this is a playoff-caliber team. Now it's a sense of accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
The Wolves survive: Van Nuys has quietly slipped into prime playoff contention 
in the Mid-Valley League with its 17-0 win over Birmingham on Friday. The 
Wolves are alone in second place with a 3-2 conference record. The top two 
teams are guaranteed playoff berths. 
</P>
<P>
The 'X' factor in Van Nuys' season has been its defense: The Wolves have posted 
three shutout in five conference games. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Kenji Mochizuki credits lineman Jose Martinez and linebacker Edvin 
Babayovo with anchoring the stalwart crew. 
</P>
<P>
With a win over Monroe on Friday, Van Nuys will assure itself of postseason 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Forfeits: Hoover was forced to forfeit victories over South Pasadena and 
Monrovia for allowing 14-year-old Chris Kalaleh to play. Southern Section rules 
stipulate that a player must be 15 to play varsity football. 
</P>
<P>
Kalaleh, a sophomore who turns 15 in December, caught 12 passes for 104 yards 
in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard's program: Scholastic Sports America, an ESPN program that focuses on 
high school athletics, will be filming the Harvard water polo team's 
first-round playoff match today against Newbury Park, Coach Rich Corso said.

THOMAS CRAMS A SEASON INTO SINGLE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quartz Hill High tailback Erik Thomas, a 5-foot-10, 180-pound sophomore who had 
rushed for 152 yards in eight games, surpassed that total with a 190-yard 
performance against Ridgecrest Burroughs on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank (1-7-1) has passed for 1,262 yards, fifth among Valley teams. Bryan 
Miclette (36 catches, 522 yards, two touchdowns) and Patrick Blazon (33 
catches, 431 yards, one touchdown) are fourth and fifth among Valley receivers. 
</P>
<P>
Montclair Prep ran just 14 offensive plays in its 54-0 win over Maranatha, 
seven of which resulted in touchdowns. Derek Sparks ran for four scores, giving 
him 29 touchdowns this season. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame ran just 32 offensive plays in its 55-6 victory over St. Genevieve. 
The Knights' first team scored on five of six possessions, and the second team 
scored on each of its three possessions. 
</P>
<P>
Streaks: Antelope Valley (2-7, 1-3 in Golden League play) will miss the 
playoffs for the first time since 1979. The Antelopes' seven-game losing 
streak, which was snapped last week, is their longest in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Scoring: Monroe kicker Rachel Gagliano is six of six in point-after kicks but 
has yet to attempt a field goal. The state record for scoring by a girl is 11 
points. Gagliano has two games in which to eclipse that mark. 
</P>
<P>
Rushing: It is a red-hot race that is likely to resume next season. After 
gaining 176 yards in Granada Hills' 17-0 defeat of Kennedy last Friday, 
Highlander fullback Brett Washington has moved to within 15 yards of Ontiwaun 
Carter in the run for the Northwest Valley Conference rushing title. Carter, a 
junior tailback who was held to 55 yards against Granada Hills, has 932 yards. 
Washington, also a junior, has 917. Although Carter has played in one less 
game, he has carried the ball 32 times more than Washington, who is averaging 
8.3 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
Passing: After seven games, three teams in the Northwest Valley Conference have 
yet to pass for a touchdown -- El Camino Real, Chatsworth and Taft. The teams' 
starting quarterbacks have combined for 618 yards (an average per team of 29.4 
yards a game) and 18 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Defense: In its 34-13 rout of Warren, Thousand Oaks gave up 216 yards rushing, 
more than the Lancers had allowed all season. Through their first eight games, 
the Lancers yielded 187 yards -- 23.4 yards a game.

MONROE, VAN NUYS AGREE TO CHANGE KICKOFF TIME FOR MID-VALLEY GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The starting time for the Monroe-Van Nuys football game Thursday at Van Nuys 
High has been moved to 2:15 p.m. in an effort to avoid recent gang activity 
between students of the schools, according to Monroe assistant principal Angelo 
Porco. 
</P>
<P>
Drive-by shootings have taken place between a gang from Van Nuys and the 
"Blythe Street group" from Monroe, Porco said. Administrators from the 
Mid-Valley League schools agreed to move the time from 8 p.m. to the afternoon 
start. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to do is make it safe," Porco said. "It's not giving in. 
It's protecting people through the guise of daylight. We're letting (the gangs) 
know that we're not going to tolerate them doing anything. 
</P>
<P>
"The schools are here for our kids and the hoods are not going to ruin this." 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Athletic Director Rick Rossini was reluctant to attribute the time 
change to gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hesitate to put any definitive label on this," Rossini said. "There's 
a lot of investigating to do before we can make statements like that. (Monroe) 
called us and we responded to the call like any school would." 
</P>
<P>
Monroe is 1-5-1 entering the game, 1-3-1 in league play. Van Nuys is 3-4, 3-2 
and could clinch a playoff berth with a win. BRIAN MURPHY

GASTELUM, AGUIRRE FAVORED IN CROSS-COUNTRY PRELIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE GLAZE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brian Gastelum of Birmingham High and Obed Aguirre of San Fernando figure to be 
the top contenders for the boys' individual title in the City Section 
cross-country preliminaries at Pierce College today at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
In the team race, Belmont's seven-year reign as City champion is on the line 
against Taft, which pounded the Sentinels, 20-43, in a nonconference meet in 
September. Birmingham, the Valley Pac-8 Conference champion, also is expected 
to make a strong bid for the title. 
</P>
<P>
Gastelum has the City's fastest time on the three-mile course this season -- a 
14-minute, 55-second clocking in the Braves' dual meet with Monroe on Oct. 26. 
Aguirre registered a personal-best 15:08 in winning his second Northwest Valley 
Conference championship last week. 
</P>
<P>
The City's top returnee, junior Martin Morales of Wilson, started racing again 
two weeks ago after being sidelined because of injury. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' competition, four of Wilson's top seven runners from a year ago 
have graduated and the Mules will be hard pressed to win their fourth 
consecutive City title. The top four runners in 1988 for Garfield, last year's 
runner-up, also have graduated. 
</P>
<P>
The City finals will be held Nov. 18 at Pierce. MIKE GLAZE

DYSLEXIA CONFUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I'm confused about the term dyslexia. It seems to be applied now to 
every child who has trouble learning. But that doesn't make any sense to me. I 
would appreciate any information about what causes dyslexia, and any other 
information about the condition that you can provide. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Your confusion is understandable because even experts disagree on the 
definition of dyslexia and its cause. The most widely used definition stresses 
difficulty in learning to read despite the person's having the required 
intelligence as well as the opportunity for learning and proper instruction. 
</P>
<P>
Among factors that have been associated with dyslexia are a low socioeconomic 
background and large family. Men appear to be affected about three times more 
often than women, and heredity also appears to play a role. 
</P>
<P>
Dyslexia may give rise to other problems. For example, dyslexia may lead to 
behavior problems because of a child's inability to read. In turn, this may 
cause the child to be labeled as having an "attention-deficit disorder" linked 
with hyperactivity. This would be particularly unfortunate because the approach 
to treatment is different for each of these disorders.

The Movie: "The Fabulous Baker Boys." 
</P>
<P>
The Look: Smoldering. No, we don't mean the standard issue tuxedos worn by the 
boys (Jeff and Beau Bridges). We're talking about Susie Diamond (Michelle 
Pfeiffer), a nightclub singer, whose wardrobe of tight dresses and big, drippy 
earrings are a primer in dressing with sex appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The Labels: New York designer Ronaldus Shamask made the black cocktail dress 
Diamond wears for her first lounge appearance with the boys. Costumer Lisa 
Jensen took in the seams to make sure the fit was skin tight. But, she says, 
that's the only label in Diamond's wardrobe that she can recall. 
</P>
<P>
The Stores: Jensen does remember where she shopped, exactly. The discount 
houses on Santee Street in downtown Los Angeles, thrift shops in The Valley, 
Neiman Marcus in Beverly Hills and Addictions on Sunset. Almost everything was 
priced under $100, since Jensen figured that would be about all Diamond could 
afford on her tight budget. 
</P>
<P>
The Plan: Presumably, the brash, confident Diamond doesn't read Vogue for 
lessons in how to exude sensuality. She just follows the golden rule of sex 
appeal: Don't show it all. Although she has an ideal body, she avoids wearing 
anything obviously sexy, like the predictable, slit-to-the-thigh. As Jensen 
puts it: "You don't always have to go for massive amounts of flesh pushed 
together. You should play hide-and-seek with the body." 
</P>
<P>
The Program: To show off her lithe figure, Diamond's clothes are contoured to 
the body (several are made of Spandex), but still cover enough of her to seem 
subtle, compared with more obvious approaches to sexy dressing. Long sleeves 
make the point, as do bolero jackets that allow just a suggestion of midriff to 
show. The only bits of torso on view are the shoulders, neck, cleavage or back. 
Nothing gaudy about the color schemes either. Diamond goes for rich jewel tones 
or basic black. Instead of slit, sliced and suggestive shoes, Diamond wears 
classy black pumps (OK, so they have stiletto heels), and sheer black hose. No 
rhinestones running up the leg and no patterns. Rings, bracelets, and dangling, 
shoulder-length earrings provide the glitter. 
</P>
<P>
The Payoff: Diamond's garnet-red velvet dress, worn in her slithery "Making 
Whoopee" number on New Year's Eve, is the piece de resistance, a model in 
sex-appeal, and the only garment in the show that Jensen designed. It's a 
'30s-like halter-top number that hugs every curve. And while it suggests quite 
a lot, it doesn't expose much. The snowflake- shaped "diamond" earrings that 
complete the outfit all but beg to be twirled. BETTY GOODWIN

<P>
AN OUTPOURING OF CELTIC SOUL BY THE WATERBOYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Waterboys' Mike Scott demonstrated Monday night at the Wiltern Theatre that 
he is a wary, but immensely worthy rock hero. 
</P>
<P>
In his first local appearance in four years, the Scottish-born 
singer-songwriter came armed with enough inspiring songs and uplifting 
musicianship to put on a snappy and appealing show that at, say, 90 minutes 
would have been a guaranteed knockout. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he and the other six musicians in his band stretched things out to two 
hours, breaking the natural momentum early in the show in ways that seemed at 
times stubbornly self-defeating. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Scott showed in the end that he not only knew what he was doing, but that 
he has the conviction, purpose and talent to put him near the forefront of 
contemporary rockers. The most significant aspect of the concert was that Scott 
now seems comfortable in that role. It wasn't always the case. 
</P>
<P>
Rarely has someone looked stardom in the face so fully as Scott did four years 
ago when he stood on the brink of a U2-like adoration in Britain -- only to 
step back to see if he liked where he was headed. 
</P>
<P>
It was a surprising move because Scott burst on the scene in England in 1983 so 
eager to be accepted as the latest in the rock-as-inspiration tradition of Bob 
Dylan and Van Morrison that he seemed to demand to march at the head the 
nearest rock parade. The problem was that his vision wasn't focused and his 
craft wasn't realized. 
</P>
<P>
Scott wrote so many heavy-handed and overblown "message" songs for the band's 
first two albums that Trouser Press, a magazine that specialized in the 
alternative rock scene, quite reasonably called much of his music "hideously 
pompous" and overproduced. 
</P>
<P>
By the time of his third album, 1985's "This Is the Sea," Scott and the 
Waterboys had begun moving toward warmer and more convincing expressions of 
spiritually accented idealism and hope. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the advances in his songwriting, there was a somewhat anonymous quality 
to the band's music. The songs were still a bit overblown, somewhat adrift in 
the fashionable currents of rock at the time, rather than asserting an 
individual voice. 
</P>
<P>
Almost intuitively, Scott backed away from the stardom mantle that was about to 
be handed him for some soul-searching. He had seen too many other bands reach 
mass acceptance only to flounder because they didn't have a solid or purposeful 
foundation. The break eventually led him to move from London to Ireland, where 
he put together a new band that enabled him to work with the bright, flavorful 
Irish folk trimmings that seemed to instill him with a sense of tradition and 
earthy truth. 
</P>
<P>
His much admired next album, 1988's "Fisherman's Blues," reflected those 
changes. The songs had the ambition of his early albums, but with a far more 
personal, perhaps even humble tone that better served his reflections on the 
search for social and spiritual fulfillment. Here, at last, was music from a 
man's heart -- all dressed in disarming Celtic ribbons and bows. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's show at the Wiltern -- where Scott will appear again tonight before a 
concert Thursday at UC San Diego -- was an extension of the breakthrough in 
"Fisherman's Blues." 
</P>
<P>
For someone with a somewhat reclusive reputation (no interviews please!), Scott 
appeared remarkably comfortable and warm -- if low-key -- on stage, moving 
about as if he were simply providing entertainment at a neighborhood block 
party as he stood at the microphone in his black leather fisherman's cap, an 
old sport jacket and jeans. 
</P>
<P>
The two opening songs -- "Fisherman's Blues" and "Strange Boat" -- outlined the 
gentle message of optimism and faith at the core of Scott's compositions. 
</P>
<P>
"We're livin' in a strange time / Workin' for a strange goal / We're turnin' 
flesh and body / into soul," he sang in the latter number, virtually defining 
his musical destination. The journey itself was sometimes slow -- frustratingly 
so as the Celtic coloring (provided by such instruments as the accordion, 
mandolin and fiddle) neutralized the emotion of the songs (especially a version 
of Bob Dylan's "Girl from the North Country") and the frequent use of 
traditional numbers broke the momentum of Waterboys' own punchy songs. 
</P>
<P>
At about the half-way mark, however, Scott seemed satisfied that he had 
introduced the roots of his music. He picked up an electric guitar and went 
into a series of explosive rockers that had the audience -- which had seemed a 
bit drowsy at times -- on its feet, fully engrossed. 
</P>
<P>
By this time, the mixture of folk warmth and rock bite was so unified in his 
music that it seemed only natural when Scott brought out the nearly two dozen 
members of the Scottish Fiddlers of Los Angeles group for a jam that offered 
the warm, communal feel that is such a winning feature of Los Lobos concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Like Bruce Springsteen, Scott realizes that you can't just go out to serve the 
audience if you are going to have a lasting and meaningful -- as opposed to 
superficial -- relationship with that audience. Scott knows that what he has to 
serve are his own artistic impulses. 
</P>
<P>
It's that realization that fuels his new music and performance with a 
triumphant and liberating edge. He needs a few more songs of the level of the 
"Fisherman's Blues" material before he can be reasonably ranked with the models 
he so much admires, but he flashed signs of greatness on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Opening the bill was Show of Hands, a local folk trio that in its overly 
earnest moments seems too much like a hard-edged, contemporary version of Peter 
Paul &amp; Mary, but at times(especially in the song "Langston Hughes") seems 
to have in a challenging spirit worth exploring.

BLACK ARTISTS: A SOVIET CHOREOGRAPHER IS INTRODUCED TO HER AMERICAN 
HALF-SISTERS DURING A MEETING PROMPTED BY A BLACK ARTS GROUP IN SAN DIEGO.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Monday morning, a thin, curly-haired man stood on the stage at the Educational 
Cultural Complex theater and passionately recited a poem, first in Russian and 
then in English. 
</P>
<P>
The audience of students looked bemused as the poet's foreign phrases filled 
the air, but they listened intently as he launched into the English translation 
of his tale of childhood memories. 
</P>
<P>
Given the current preoccupation with things Soviet, this bilingual reading was 
not that unusual. But what was unusual was that the man was black and a citizen 
of the Soviet Union, and his poem included remembrances of lying in a cradle 
and "hearing Russian and African melodies." 
</P>
<P>
The poet is James Patterson, one of five black Soviets -- three artists and two 
journalists, all children of black American fathers and Soviet mothers -- who 
are in San Diego providing an intriguing and poignant addition to the Soviet 
arts festival. 
</P>
<P>
The visit by the five was dreamed up by the local Organization of African 
American Artists and Writers, which some months back was seeking a way to 
include blacks in the festival. Members of the organization were in touch with 
a Howard University professor who is an expert on blacks in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to let people know that there are people of African descent all over 
the world," said Sylvia M'Lafi Thompson, cultural affairs officer at the 
Educational Cultural Complex and coordinator of the visit. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson is leading the group around town for presentations at area schools and 
colleges. Thursday at 8 p.m. at the cultural complex in Southeast San Diego, 
there will be a final presentation called "Until We Meet Again." The Soviet 
artists will perform along with pianist Cecil Lytle and other local black 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
Black American students and agricultural experts were invited to the Soviet 
Union in the late '20s and 
</P>
<P>
early '30s to learn about socialist society. The theory was that they would 
return to the United States and 
</P>
<P>
promote the the Soviet Union's lack of racism. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of the black visitors married Soviet women there and had families, 
four of which are represented in San Diego. (James Patterson's brother, Tom, a 
television cameraman, is also among the visitors.) 
</P>
<P>
At the Monday presentation, each of the visitors spoke and answered questions 
from the audience of students. 
</P>
<P>
Yelena Khanga, a journalist with the Moscow News and the most English-fluent of 
the group, said little attention is paid to her background in the Soviet Union.

"Only when I'm interviewed by foreign journalists is (color) an issue." 
</P>
<P>
Eleanor Ross Johnson, a classical singer with the Moscow State Philharmony, 
speaks halting English, but the look on her face communicated her joy at being 
here. 
</P>
<P>
The most touching story came from Margie Scott, a choreographer and former 
principal dancer with the Bolshoi Ballet, who just a few months ago discovered 
she had five half-sisters in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Her father, Henry Scott, went to the Soviet Union as a student in 1929. He 
became a well-known tap dancer and married a Moscow woman named Valentina 
Bobsena. They had a daughter named Ulemei, who came to be known as Margie. 
</P>
<P>
Scott divorced Bobsena and married another Russian woman, Olga Larionova. They 
returned to the United States in 1939 and raised five daughters. When Scott 
died in 1945, his oldest American daughter was 7 years old, the youngest just 
an infant. As they grew up, the American-born children learned of their Soviet 
half-sister, but had no idea how to reach her. Margie Scott, the Russian 
ballerina with the unlikely name, didn't even know she had an American family. 
</P>
<P>
In May of 1988, one of the daughters, Nina Robinson was watching television in 
her New York home and happened to see photos of her father on a program 
produced by Essence magazine. There were also photos of a woman whose 
resemblance was unmistakable. It was Margie Scott, the long-lost relative. 
</P>
<P>
Through a friend who traveled to the Soviet Union in March, the sisters were 
able to deliver a package to Scott, who responded with a letter bearing news 
that they have yet another Soviet sister, Yelena. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson and two of her sisters, Scott Brown of New York City and Kirra 
Philpott of Mesa, Ariz., came to San Diego for the reunion. Saturday, the three 
sisters laid eyes on their Soviet half-sister for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been such an incredible story," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
They are all incredible stories. James and Tom Patterson's father, Lloyd, was 
born in New Jersey and graduated from Hampton College. He was a friend of Paul 
Robeson and other black artists. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Patterson did not speak Russian, but he met a Soviet woman who spoke 
English. He learned Russian and became an announcer on Moscow Central Radio. He 
was killed in an explosion in 1942, leaving behind 8-year-old James and his 
younger brother, Tom. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 20 years later, a package arrived at James' Moscow home. It was a 
present -- a book of poetry -- from another one of his father's friends. The 
dedication was addressed to "the dream keeper" and offered "good poetic 
wishes." 
</P>
<P>
It was from Langston Hughes.

NEVE ILAN, Israel 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dooby Salman, Israeli cowboy, fell in love with lassos and Stetsons during the 
filming of a Western in the desert near the Dead Sea. 
</P>
<P>
He went off to California to learn rodeo techniques, dropped the English- and 
cavalry-style riding he had learned at home and came back to Israel a 
self-styled wrangler. 
</P>
<P>
Salman is trying to share his love affair with fellow Israelis, even ones who 
wouldn't know a bronco from a blintz. Last week at this hilltop kibbutz near 
Jerusalem, Salman helped put on Israel's first rodeo. Tame as it was -- there 
were no wild bulls or bucking stallions -- the rodeo was in many ways little 
different from one that might be held in a small town in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Young riders strode bow-legged in Levi's and pointy-toed boots. A duo from the 
Bronx and Brooklyn played bluegrass tunes while a vendor selling hamburgers and 
corn-on-the-cob clanged a triangle and called out "Come and get it." 
</P>
<P>
It was a purely American scene, although there were plenty of non-Americans 
participating, including Salman, who is a native-born Israeli. It was just one 
scene in an Israel that is looking more and more American. 
</P>
<P>
"People here love American things," said Salman, as he made his way to the 
calf-roping event. "The U.S. has a good image." 
</P>
<P>
The American Dream -- at least its consumer life and its wealth of variety -- 
is taking hold in Israel. From fast skateboards to fast food, from suburban 
cookouts to inner-city slang, from Batman to bingo, Israel is nurturing a style 
that is very much made in America. 
</P>
<P>
Although such a phenomenon is far from unique to Israel, it is a cause for 
special vexation here. Israel is a country that has dedicated itself to be the 
Promised Land for world Jewry. Now, in its 42nd year as a state, Israel finds 
itself in a quiet but persistent competition with the United States for the 
body and soul of Jewry. Not only is America beckoning from abroad, it is 
invading Israeli life. 
</P>
<P>
In the view of some Israelis, the embrace of American life styles is a sign of 
a weakening of an Israeli vision once based on self-sacrifice and relative 
simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
"If what we are offering is a kosher version of the American dream, why should 
Jews come here? They can go to the United States and get the real thing," 
remarked sociologist Sasha Weitman. 
</P>
<P>
The difficulty Israel faces competing with America on the field of carefree 
dreams recently became clear with the news that many Soviet Jews, when free to 
emigrate, preferred to bypass Zion and head straight for Brooklyn. Some of the 
Soviet Jews said that if diverted by U.S. immigration restrictions to go to 
Israel, they would rather stay in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this slap in the face, somehow the competition with the United States 
remains friendly, at least in the public mind. In some spheres, the United 
States is a clear model. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em: Among the plethora of 
Israeli hamburger chains is one called McDavid's, after the biblical king, and 
another called King Donald. Something called Turbo Burger just opened in 
Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Friendliness is reinforced by the U.S. government, which remains Israel's most 
steadfast and proven friend, periodic differences of foreign policy aside. 
Europe, by way of contrast, has leaned strongly to the Arab side in Israel's 
conflict with Palestinians, while the Soviet Union has withheld diplomatic 
links with Israel in favor of alliances with some of the country's most staunch 
enemies. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is by far Israel's most generous benefactor. Annual military 
and economic aid amounts to $3 billion a year, a tenth of Israel's gross 
national product. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the aid that Washington hands most countries, this largess comes with 
few strings attached. Israel may spend it as it likes, although much of the 
military aid must be used to buy American equipment. Golda Meir, the late prime 
minister, once joked, "Israel is the only country in the world that loves 
America despite the fact that it gives it military and economic aid." 
</P>
<P>
The strength of the American Jewish community also presents an attractive if 
sometimes irritating model for Israel. American Jews are assertive, challenging 
the notion that Jews dispersed throughout the world -- the Diaspora -- must be 
self-effacing lest they run the risk of attracting aggression from a majority, 
non-Jewish society. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dogma Challenged 
</P>
<P>
The evidence that Jews in America can live a fulfilling Jewish life abroad is 
yet another challenge to Zionist dogma. The Diaspora was, after all, supposed 
to wither away; the exiles were supposed to gather in Israel. In the case of 
America, something of the reverse has happened. Since 1948, about 60,000 
Americans have moved to Israel, but more than 170,000 Israelis have moved to 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"In some cases, the U.S. even gets the cream," noted David Hartman, an Orthodox 
rabbi and director of the Shamol Hartman Institute of Advanced Judaic Studies. 
"America has resources, grants, important universities. It is hard for Israel 
to compete." 
</P>
<P>
At home, a taste for things American flowered from 1977 onward after the 
ascendancy of the right-wing Likud Party in national politics. The socialist 
dogma of the early Zionists, with its emphasis on equality and pride of 
austerity, decayed. Self-reliance, in part buffeted by the increasing levels of 
American aid, fell out of fashion. 
</P>
<P>
The Likud promoted both an aggressive nationalism and a free-market, 
demand-side economy. Consumption and wealth were no longer political sins. In 
effect, Likud called out, "Come and get it," and the population responded with 
a burst of travel and buying based in part on borrowing in an overheated 
economy. More and more, Israel, especially the coastal strip centered on Tel 
Aviv, came to resemble an extended Los Angeles suburb. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night at the mall has become a favorite family pastime. Pastel 
restaurants with waiters who greet customers with, "Shalom, my name is Moshe" 
are all the rage. Soccer is still king, but basketball, complete with a few 
imported Americans, runs a strong second. There may be more to come: Cable 
television is on its way, with its promise of access to the Super Bowl and CNN. 
</P>
<P>
There is little self-consciousness about aping American ways, perhaps because 
Israel has never settled on a uniform cultural model. Although prominent, the 
American style is but one of several molds shaping Israeli life. 
</P>
<P>
The dwindling life style of the cooperative kibbutz continues to attract a few 
adherents, although the legendary uniformity has given way to consumer lust; 
the craze for video tape recorders has reached places where once all families 
watched television in common rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Remnants of high European culture dominate the concert halls of Jerusalem and 
Tel Aviv, although the auditoriums have made room for styles of Western rock. 
Relative newcomers from North Africa and the Near East have contributed a spicy 
Oriental ambiance to many towns and neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The fast-growing religious community has become bolder and bolder in trying to 
press rules of piety on the majority secular society. Even here, American style 
has penetrated. In the religious neighborhood of Bnei Brak, there is a rock 
band that sings praises to the Lord to a heavy metal beat. 
</P>
<P>
The Hebrew language, an open repository of influence from Israel's many ethnic 
groups, is also showing signs of Americanization. Want to offer your friends a 
cocktail at a bar? Ask the waiter for a round of drinkim. 
</P>
<P>
For participants at the Neve Ilan rodeo, acting American seemed to be as 
natural as could be. Some even took the view that engaging in this particular 
pastime was the most Israeli thing you can do. 
</P>
<P>
"Rodeo fits the Israeli character," said Sandy Kessler, 35, a native of Seattle 
and a novice rider. "It's wild and crazy." 
</P>
<P>
The rodeo was the brainchild of Dooby Salman and Anthony Lipschitz, a South 
African who runs a riding school at Neve Ilan, which lies on a high hill 10 
miles west of Jerusalem. Cattle ranching has begun to be big business in 
Israel's north, and so the image of a cowboy on the range is becoming more and 
more familiar to Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a country of immigrants, so there is bound to be variety like this. 
There is no reason for us all to be the same," said Lipschitz, who rode his 
prize stallion, Shades of Silver, in the opening parade. 
</P>
<P>
On rodeo day, Israel's current tribulations seemed far away -- although among 
the prizes were protective windshield covers designed to keep glass from 
shattering in case a Palestinian throws a well-aimed rock. 
</P>
<P>
Young riders raced from barrel to barrel. Teams from farms and ranches put 
their mounts through meticulous trials meant to simulate chores on the range. 
All the while, fiddlers struck up "Tennessee Stud" and "Turkey in the Straw" to 
an appreciative audience. 
</P>
<P>
"Next year, we'll bring in wild bulls," predicted Salman. 
</P>
<P>
The Brahma bulls that make perfect riding stock exist in Israel; what's needed 
is a proper arena with chutes and strong fences, he said, explaining why there 
weren't present this year. 
</P>
<P>
That addition should complete an authentic American afternoon. Just about 
everything else was in place: kids chewing gum and wearing souvenir T-shirts 
from Cape Canaveral and the Hard Rock Cafe; cowgirls wearing belt buckles the 
size of small pizzas, and of course, brisk sales of the cowboy hats -- made in 
Hong Kong.

FBI DIRECTOR MORE HOPEFUL OF SOLVING ROGERS BOMBING 
</P>

<P>
FBI Director William S. Sessions expressed new confidence Tuesday that federal 
investigators will solve the March 10 bombing in La Jolla of the van being 
driven by the wife of Navy Capt. Will Rogers III. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Sessions had said there was less of a chance of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation solving the Rogers' van bombing than the bombing of Pan American 
Flight 103 from London to New York. He indicated to reporters in Washington on 
Tuesday that he now has changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"In connection with 103, I am confident we will in fact present the evidence 
that will allow us to have the strongest possible case that could -- if a grand 
jury chose to indict -- be presented in court," Sessions said at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"As to the comparison between two different investigations (103 and the Rogers 
van bombing,)," he said, "they both have their frustrations." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "I am confident that we will end up solving them both." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Rogers, the wife of the former commander of the guided-missile cruiser 
Vincennes, narrowly escaped death when her van suddenly exploded at a busy La 
Jolla intersection in March. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI assumed jurisdiction in the case on the theory that the Rogers family 
was the target of a terrorist attack in retribution for Will Rogers' mistaken 
order in 1988 aboard the Vincennes to shoot down a civilian Iranian airbus over 
the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Sessions did not elaborate on why he has renewed confidence that the case will 
be solved. But he indicated that the FBI, which has recently investigated an 
American citizen with an alleged personal grudge against Will Rogers, has never 
completely ruled out terrorism as a motive. 
</P>
<P>
"We are continuing that investigation," he said of the Rogers bombing. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a matter of trying to be sure that it is a terrorist incident and was a 
terrorist incident and that we follow through to be able to gain the evidence 
that will allow us to present it to the United States attorney for presentation 
to a grand jury." 
</P>
<P>
His comments came as FBI agents continue to pursue leads involving George 
Marxmiller, a former commercial pilot living in Georgia who surfaced last month 
as a potential suspect in the van bombing. 
</P>
<P>
FBI officials have never commented publicly whether Marxmiller remains a 
suspect, but sources familiar with the matter said prospects of a breakthrough 
involving Marxmiller's arrest appear dimmer than they did a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Will Rogers said Tuesday that he welcomes Sessions' renewed confidence in 
solving the attempted murder of his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"Sharon and I applaud the diligence and tenacity of the investigative 
authorities, and we share their confidence in the ultimate closure of this 
case," Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Sessions said, "I can't express with strong confidence" that federal 
investigators will be able to solve the Rogers van bombing. He also said at 
that time that he was more confident about investigators identifying those 
responsible for the Flight 103 case, which also today remains unsolved. On 
Tuesday, the FBI director also said he supports a bill being sponsored by a San 
Diego congressman to create a reward fund for victims of international 
terrorism who are attacked on U.S. soil. Under the measure being pushed by Rep. 
Bill Lowery, R-San Diego, the first reward of $100,000 would be established in 
the Rogers bombing. 
</P>
<P>
Sessions said he believes that the reward could assist the FBI in the Rogers 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
"There is, of course, a direct concern about being able to solve the case," he 
said. "And rewards often incite people to come and give information where they 
might not have given it before." 
</P>
<P>
Karl Higgins, a San Diego aide to Lowery, said the reward measure was attached 
to a major appropriations bill that has been bogged down in Senate and House 
differences over other parts of the bill not relating to the reward fund. 
</P>
<P>
He said the House reconsidered the bill on Tuesday and voted unanimously again 
to pass the measure, and that Senate action is expected today. 
</P>
<P>
Higgins added that Lowery, a close friend of the Rogers family, has become 
increasingly concerned about terrorist attacks in this country. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Bill was concerned about the larger issue of terrorist acts occurring 
on U.S. soil and wanted to provide an incentive for resolution of these types 
of cases while working in close concert with the FBI," Higgins said. "It just 
so happens that, regrettably, what we believe to be the first incident occurred 
in his congressional district."

MORE MEDFLIES FOUND; SPRAY AREA DOUBLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ and RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More fertile Mediterranean fruit flies were reported Tuesday to have been 
detected in the San Gabriel Valley, prompting at last two state scientists to 
express concern that Los Angeles County faces a full-blown infestation of the 
notorious pests. 
</P>
<P>
The finding of three more of the crop-damaging flies forced agriculture 
officials, who already are battling infestations in five sectors of the county, 
to double the scale of a pesticide spraying operation planned for Thursday and 
to escalate a campaign to persuade the public to honor quarantine boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time Tuesday, two members of a five-member state scientific 
panel, which advises farm officials on how to battle the Medfly, broke ranks 
with county and state agriculture officials and their colleagues, saying the 
infestations in Los Angeles County might be linked and demanding a more 
aggressive attack. 
</P>
<P>
The infestations are "indicative of a larger problem that we have not been able 
to identify," said UC Davis entomologist Richard Rice, one of the two panelists 
calling for stronger action. "Something has gone wrong somewhere, and we need 
to find out why." 
</P>
<P>
Rice and James R. Carey, also a UC Davis entomologist, said that Los Angeles 
County needs to double the application of pesticides sprayed on infested 
neighborhoods and expand the ongoing program of trapping to better determine 
the extent of the infestation. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the panelists and L.A. County officials charged with leading 
the fight, however, maintained a more placid view of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
The view of County Agricultural Commissioner Leon Spaugy and others is that the 
five outbreaks in the last four months are isolated incidents caused by the 
illegal smuggling of fruit. He and other experts said they remain convinced 
that one-time spraying of infested sectors and other tactics are sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
All participants in the debate are well aware of the Medfly disaster of 1981, 
in which a small infestation in Santa Clara exploded into a statewide outbreak, 
leading to international quarantines, the loss of $100 million to growers and, 
some have suggested, irreparable damage to the political career of then-Gov. 
Edmund G. Brown Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Medflies lay their eggs in a wide variety of produce, making it unsaleable. 
</P>
<P>
While Los Angeles County's once-significant role as an agricultural region has 
diminished, it still serves as a vital hub for the state's most important 
industry. An estimated $1.75 billion in agricultural products that could be 
affected by a Medfly infestation passes through the county each year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not ready to accept that," Spaugy said when asked about the possibility 
that he faces a countywide infestation. If the infestations were part of a 
countywide outbreak, he said, hundreds of flies would show up in the 7,821 
traps hanging from back-yard fruit trees throughout the county. So far, 134 
Medflies have been trapped. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the trapped flies were discovered late Monday in the San Gabriel 
Valley; the find was announced Tuesday after the fertility of the pests was 
confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the sector to be sprayed with the pesticide malathion Thursday 
night was doubled in size to 23 square miles to include parts of Alhambra, El 
Monte, San Marino, Temple City and all of Rosemead, San Gabriel and South El 
Monte. 
</P>
<P>
The new spray zone brings to 88 the number of square miles that will have been 
sprayed in Los Angeles County since August. In 1981, a total of 39 square miles 
were sprayed in Los Angeles County. About 230 square miles in the county are 
now under quarantine, which prohibits taking home-grown fruit out of an 
infested area. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County expects to spend $8 million to $10 million this year "just 
on eradication of the Medfly alone," Spaugy said. The unprecedented number of 
infestations -- five in the county this year -- have affected neighborhoods 
around Elysian Park, the northeast San Fernando Valley, West Covina and 
Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
Most experts interviewed said that Los Angeles is vulnerable to Medfly 
infestations because of the large amount of cargo and high numbers of people 
traveling through its airports, harbors and train stations. They also pointed 
to the county's large population of immigrants who bring with them fruits from 
infested countries. But no one can say for sure why the problem is so bad this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"Why all of a sudden?" asked Bob Atkins, the county's deputy agricultural 
commissioner. "Why don't we see it in different areas in California?" 
</P>
<P>
The two UC Davis entomologists said the pest may be gaining a foothold in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers "say to me that there is serious problem and that they are at least 
temporarily established," Carey said. "My gut feeling is that if they were 
random infestations, flies would be popping up in other areas. But these are 
all in the L.A. Basin." 
</P>
<P>
Other regions of the state, such as San Diego, Kern County and the San Joaquin 
Valley, also have large immigrant populations, Carey said. 
</P>
<P>
He and Rice also disagreed with the suggestion by their colleagues that the 
flies are being spread by people. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't convince myself that we can't have that much contraband fruit all of 
sudden arriving at the same time," Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
The latest infestation in Rosemead and El Monte at least has persuaded most 
officials involved in the eradication effort that more needs to be known about 
the root causes. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to talk about what might be done to determine whether or not there is 
an ongoing, long-existing endemic population," said Derrell Chambers, one of 
the state scientists and director of a federal research facility in Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
The expert panel, which is consulted before each aerial malathion spraying, 
will meet with state and county officials in January to devise a scientific 
trapping experiment. 
</P>
<P>
Also, state and county agriculture officials said they have bolstered 
inspection programs throughout the region, with roving squads of fruit fly 
police that are descending on quarantine areas to check that stores and street 
vendors are protecting clean fruit with plastic covers. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, agricultural officials posted guards at a grocery store in 
Koreatown for two days to stop the sale of fruit. The store, despite repeated 
warnings, continued selling fruit in a quarantine area without installing a 
front door, said Dee Sudduth, senior agricultural biologist for the state 
Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the guards there to keep the customers out of the area," Sudduth said. 
"The customers will just ignore you and grab stuff and run. We had one guy who 
snagged a persimmon and made a dash to the cash register, and they stopped him 
and sent him back." Sudduth said that agricultural officials also destroyed 
1,600 pounds of apples and persimmons at the store. 
</P>
<P>
There is a $25,000 fine for anyone found guilty of causing a Medfly 
infestation. "But that necessitates building a case, which is difficult to do," 
Spaugy said. 
</P>
<P>
State officials planned as well to step up their public information program, 
including sending out a mass mailing in English and Spanish to hundreds of 
thousands of residents in infested neighborhoods, urging them to report any 
fruit leaving quarantine areas. "Your cooperation will save millions of tax 
dollars," the notice says. 
</P>
<P>
County officials hope to take advantage of a new federal law to plug up one of 
the possible "pathways" for the pest. The new law, sponsored by a former 
congressman from the agriculturally rich San Joaquin Valley, allows postal 
authorities to inspect first-class mail coming from such places as Hawaii and 
Puerto Rico, where the Medfly is found. 
</P>
<P>
At Los Angeles International Airport, federal inspectors fill about "six large 
garbage cans" a day with confiscated fruit detected by specially trained dogs 
and X-ray machines.

PRESIDENT SEEKS TO DOWNPLAY ABORTION ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
On the morning of an election day in which Republicans suffered losses in large 
part because of the party's anti-abortion stance, President Bush tried to 
distance the GOP from the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We have room in our party for people that feel one way, pro-life or 
pro-choice. The Democratic Party is the same way," Bush said in his press 
conference Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush made clear that he will not back off his own anti-abortion position. But 
he also made clear that he will not harden his views, praising family planning 
programs, for example, which have been a major target of many anti-abortion 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone knows that this is an issue that divides," Bush said of 
abortion. "Is it the most important issue for me? Absolutely not." 
</P>
<P>
Abortion has been a key issue for Democrats over the last several months, and 
the White House has been looking for a way to calm the fears of moderate 
abortion-rights advocates within the GOP without upsetting the anti-abortion 
conservatives whose support Bush needs. Bush appears to have decided that 
downplaying the issue is his best hope. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bush also displayed the strategy his advisers hope to use to diffuse 
conservative concern on another issue -- defense spending. The Pentagon faces 
some $12.9 billion in spending cuts this year under the Gramm-Rudman budget 
balancing law, and at least some conservatives are alarmed that after eight 
years of the Ronald Reagan Administration's resisting military spending cuts, 
Bush's acquiescence in the current round of reductions will set a bad 
precedent. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's apparent defense is to blame the problem on Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no choice" but to allow the cuts to go forward, Bush said. Congress, he 
charged, has failed to send him a deficit-cutting measure that would avoid the 
defense spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Administration does have a choice, and it has been the subject of 
heated internal debate. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and several other Cabinet officials have urged 
Bush to reach an agreement with Congress on a deficit-reduction bill, thereby 
allowing the automatic cuts to be rescinded. The automatic cuts took effect 
earlier this fall after the Administration and Congress failed to agree on a 
deficit-reduction package in time to meet the deadline in the Gramm-Rudman law. 
</P>
<P>
But Budget Director Richard G. Darman has pushed Bush to keep the automatic 
cuts and avoid a deal with Congress. Darman fears any bill that passes Congress 
would be loaded down with budget gimmicks that would not, in fact, reduce the 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Bush said he would sign a deficit-cutting bill, but only if 
Congress meets a series of requirements that seem unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Bush adopted the classic strategy of a President riding high in the polls -- 
distancing himself from controversies by blaming Congress and downplaying his 
own influence. 
</P>
<P>
Asked, for example, what he could do to move his Administration's initiatives 
through Congress, Bush said: "Exhort, what else can I do? Veto and exhort." 
</P>
<P>
"They've got the votes up there," he said, referring to Congress' Democratic 
majority. "Look, I'm a realist." 
</P>
<P>
Bush took a similar position when asked about the negative campaigning that has 
marked the current round of election contests. "I think everybody would prefer 
the positives," he said. "But I'm not sure there's much a President can do 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
The recent emphasis on abortion has been more of a concern to the White House 
than the negativism of campaign advertisements. Until recently, Republican 
politicians had assumed abortion would almost never be a major issue in 
political campaigns against the Democrats. Anti-abortion activists were 
powerful within the GOP, often influencing primary contests, but the abortion 
rights side was poorly organized and unable to exert pressure during general 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
That situation changed radically in July when the Supreme Court opened the way 
for greater state regulation of abortions. The decision galvanized the abortion 
rights side of the debate and led to what political consultants say is one of 
the fastest political turnarounds in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
That turnaround was dramatically in evidence Tuesday. Abortion was the chief 
issue in the two elections for governor, in Virginia and New Jersey, where the 
Democratic candidates support abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Rep. James J. Florio easily defeated Republican Rep. Jim Courter to 
become governor of New Jersey and Democrat L. Douglas Wilder was maintaining a 
narrow lead over Republican J. Marshall Coleman in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Many Republicans, concerned for weeks about polls showing their candidates 
being badly hurt by the abortion issue, have been hoping to reduce its 
prominence. But Bush has been unwilling to move away from his hard-line 
anti-abortion stand and has attracted attention to the issue twice this fall 
with controversial vetoes of major government money bills that contain 
abortion-related provisions. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his evident desire to quiet the issue, the President made clear Tuesday 
that he would continue that veto strategy, repeating a threat to veto yet a 
third money bill later this fall because of abortion. The latest veto threat 
involves the foreign aid bill, which contains money for international family 
planning programs. Abortion opponents say the money might be used to aid 
China's family planning program, which has been accused of including forced 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the bill argue it contains adequate safeguards to keep U.S. money 
from being misused in the Chinese program, but Bush made clear he did not agree 
and would veto the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the pressure from GOP moderates, Bush advisers have warned him against 
altering his position on abortion. Conservatives and abortion opponents 
mistrust him already, they warn, because he used to support abortion rights. 
Any sign of wavering now could lead to fierce attacks from the right, Bush 
aides fear. 
</P>
<P>
Bush favored abortion rights until 1980, when he became Ronald Reagan's running 
mate. In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, published in March, 1980, 
Bush contrasted himself with Reagan: "He (Reagan) opposes me for not wanting to 
amend the Supreme Court decision on abortion: I happen to think it (Roe vs. 
Wade) was right," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1988 campaign, he said: "I support a constitutional amendment that 
would reverse the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision. I also support a human 
life amendment (that would ban all abortions) with an exception for the life of 
the mother, rape or incest."

ELECTIONS: POLITICAL AFTERSHOCKS PUT BOTH BALLOT PROPOSALS IN DOUBT. OWNER HAS 
THREATENED TO MOVE THE BASEBALL GIANTS.

More aftershocks -- this time the political kind -- rumbled through San 
Francisco on Tuesday, but incomplete election returns made it unclear whether 
earthquake-weary residents were in a mood to authorize construction of a new 
baseball park or grant live-in lovers some rights enjoyed by married couples. 
</P>
<P>
With many precincts still to report -- and thousands of absentee ballots yet to 
be counted -- both measures were losing but only slightly late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to stay in San Francisco," Bob Lurie, owner of the National League 
Champion San Francisco Giants said Tuesday night as the nerve-wracking vote 
count continued. But "if this measure goes down, there is really no place to 
play" in San Francisco, he said. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos -- a leading stadium backer -- refused to concede 
defeat but acknowledged that "there's no question that the earthquake affected 
the emotions of the community." 
</P>
<P>
Also too close to call was a controversial proposal in San Francisco to approve 
a so-called domestic partners ordinance, which sought to grant official 
recognition to relationships among gays and unmarried heterosexuals but was 
fought doggedly by religious leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in California, a proposal to raise the sales tax by a half-cent to 
pay for transportation improvements was leading in San Bernardino County with 
about one-fifth of the vote counted. But a similar measure was trailing in 
traffic-clogged Orange County, incomplete returns showed. 
</P>
<P>
Two measures fought bitterly by homosexuals -- a proposal to deny gays 
protections under a civil rights law in Irvine and an effort to repeal an 
ordinance banning discrimination against AIDS victims in Contra Costa County -- 
were winning by narrow margins, early returns indicated. 
</P>
<P>
In the days after the Oct. 17 quake, Northern California campaign workers 
focused their efforts on relief. But no 7.1 temblor could put politics on hold 
for long. Although voter interest and fund-raising lagged, campaigns were 
kick-started back to life within a week. 
</P>
<P>
Giants owner Lurie, advocating the new $115-million baseball stadium, renewed 
his statement that he would sell or move the franchise rather than continue to 
field the team at Candlestick. 
</P>
<P>
A day before the election, Mayor Agnos angrily attacked a last-minute mailer 
critical of the stadium, charging that the financing came from Sacramento Kings 
owner Gregg Luckenbill and represented an attempt to lure the Giants away. San 
Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith vowed to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
Maurice Read, Luckenbill's spokesman, insisted that no money came from 
Luckenbill "directly or indirectly," and said Agnos' claim was part of a ploy 
to increase voter interest. 
</P>
<P>
Backers said a vote for a new stadium would prove to outsiders that San 
Franciscans remain committed to the city. For a small investment, they argued, 
the public could reap several million dollars a year from the stadium's 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents claimed the city could not afford a new ballpark in the light of 
quake-related damage and more pressing needs, such as caring for AIDS victims 
and homeless people. Foes also emphasized that the stadium would be built in 
China Basin, an area of landfill near downtown, and thus might be damaged in an 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Political consultants said the earthquake also shifted attention away from San 
Francisco's other pressing issue this fall -- whether live-in lovers should 
have some of the rights afforded to married couples. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors adopted a so-called domestic 
partners ordinance, making the city one of only a handful to recognize 
relationships among gays and unmarried heterosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
But religious fundamentalists gathered 27,000 signatures, thereby forcing a 
vote on the ordinance before couples could pay $35 and register themselves as 
being part of an "intimate and committed" relationship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Telephone Appeals 
</P>
<P>
Louis Sheldon, director of the Anaheim-based Traditional Values Coalition, 
revealed Tuesday that he took a role in challenging the ordinance, "doing a lot 
by telephone" to direct strategy for the San Francisco pastor and rabbi who 
spearheaded the petition drive. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing arguments put forth by the Anaheim group, San Francisco Catholic 
Archbishop John R. Quinn said the domestic partners measure would undermine 
family and marriage and give live-in lovers rights associated with marriage 
without the obligations. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance sought to allow unmarried couples to register with the County 
Clerk as domestic partners and obtain certificates similar to marriage 
certificates. City employees could get bereavement leaves upon the deaths of 
their lovers, and would be assured the same visitation rights in hospitals as 
married couples when their lovers were near death. 
</P>
<P>
"It simply allows us to identify who we are. That seems very modest to me," 
said San Francisco Supervisor Harry Britt, who is gay and sponsored the 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The measure at issue Tuesday did not address a separate action taken by the San 
Francisco supervisors that directs the mayor to study the possibility of giving 
domestic partners the same health benefits as married couples. A task force is 
studying that idea. 
</P>
<P>
In the waning days of the campaign, supporters of the handful of money measures 
around California feared a statewide quarter-cent sales tax increase for 
earthquake victims -- signed by Gov. George Deukmejian Saturday -- could doom 
their chances at the polls. A statewide gasoline tax scheduled for the June, 
1990, ballot was also viewed as a threat to the local measures. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino and Orange counties were among six counties where voters were 
asked to open their wallets to pay for highway improvements and transit 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters hoped promises of congestion relief would entice disgruntled 
commuters into agreeing to raise the sales tax one-half cent on the dollar. 
Opponents, meanwhile, argued that highway improvements are the state's 
responsibility, and they predicted the statewide sales tax increase would spark 
an anti-spending mood among voters. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, much of the $3.1 billion to be generated by the tax over its 
20-year life was earmarked for the widening of a section of the congested Santa 
Ana Freeway from six to 12 lanes. The expansion of commuter rail service 
between Los Angeles and San Diego was among $775 million worth of transit 
projects planned. 
</P>
<P>
The transportation wish list drawn up in San Bernardino County -- where a 
similar measure was defeated in 1987 -- included freeway widening and extension 
projects and the development of rail service to Los Angeles and Orange 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the live-in lover issue in San Francisco, two other local 
measures pitted California's gays against religious fundamentalists, and both 
were backed by Sheldon's Traditional Values Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
One -- a proposal in Irvine to exclude homosexuals from protection under a 
municipal civil rights law -- was being monitored nationwide as a test of gay 
political influence. When the ordinance was passed about a year ago, Irvine 
became one of about 60 cities and towns in the country to forbid discrimination 
against gays and lesbians in jobs, housing and public services. 
</P>
<P>
But Sheldon and other religious leaders charged the law legitimized an immoral 
life style and warned it would force schools to recruit gay teachers and make 
Irvine "another San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
Voters in the Contra Costa County city of Concord approved a measure to repeal 
a local ordinance banning discrimination against people with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
And at least two communities -- Laguna Niguel in Orange County and Temecula in 
southwestern Riverside County -- became cities as voters overwhelmingly 
approved incorporation proposals. 
</P>
<P>
For leaders of two existing but financially strapped Southern California 
cities, Tuesday's results were less encouraging. Imperial Beach, one of San 
Diego County's poorest cities, and La Palma in Orange County, had asked voters 
to approve a utility user tax to help rescue the municipal governments from 
near bankruptcy. Both measures were defeated. 
</P>
<P>
In Imperial Beach, located near the U.S.-Mexican border, the financial picture 
is so bleak that Mayor Henry Smith has suggested that his city be adopted by 
its affluent neighbor, Coronado.

KITTY DUKAKIS HOSPITALIZED; ILLNESS HELD NOT DRUG-RELATED

Kitty Dukakis, wife of Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, was in a hospital 
intensive-care unit Tuesday as doctors tried to diagnose her illness. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's spokeswoman said initial tests were inconclusive, but indicated 
that the ailment was not drug- or alcohol-related. 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Dukakis is tired of tests, but she's feeling OK. She's up, she's alert," 
spokeswoman Minday Lubber said. 
</P>
<P>
She was taken by ambulance Monday night to Brigham and Women's Hospital after 
several days of flu-like symptoms, Lubber said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it's flu-related. I know she was feeling groggy," Lubber said. 
"She's had the flu. She's been feeling tired. Last night she was feeling 
particularly lethargic." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Kitty Dukakis underwent four weeks of treatment for 
alcoholism. She said previously that she had been addicted to diet pills for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
She also underwent neck surgery last year while her husband was running for 
President. 
</P>
<P>
Lubber said the governor had been at his wife's side much of Monday night and 
Tuesday. He did not immediately comment. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials refused to provide any information, but said admission to 
the intensive-care unit was standard under such circumstances.

CONGRESS VOTES TO RAISE LIMIT ON U.S. DEBT; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATION: BUSH IS EXPECTED TO SIGN IT TODAY. EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO SCALE 
BACK THE MEDICARE CATASTROPHIC CARE PROGRAM. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Congress approved legislation Tuesday night that would ensure the government 
does not default on its debts, although lawmakers were unable to immediately 
resolve differences over how to scale back the Medicare catastrophic care 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The debt bill was approved by the House on a 269-99 vote after being passed by 
voice vote in the Senate. President Bush was expected to sign the bill today, 
allowing the Treasury Department to schedule a Thursday auction of securities. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to approve the must-pass legislation foundered temporarily because 
of an 11th-hour objection from Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.), who demanded that the 
bill include his proposal to remove Social Security from calculations of the 
budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Heinz removed his roadblock to the debt-limit bill when he was promised a 
separate vote on his proposal, which some lawmakers fear would open the 
burgeoning Social Security trust fund to raids from groups seeking to add new 
or expanded programs with the $3 trillion in extra funds that are expected to 
accumulate over the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Without an increase in the debt limit to more than $3.1 trillion, the federal 
government could run out of cash on Thursday, potentially forcing the Federal 
Reserve to order banks not to honor checks issued by the Treasury. Officials 
warned that a default could plunge credit markets into chaos and tarnish the 
government's standing with international lenders who finance the U.S. deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important to our economy and our country that we not risk the adverse 
consequences of default by the government," said Senate Majority Leader George 
J. Mitchell (D-Me.) in pleading with colleagues for a quick settlement of the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Because increases in the debt-ceiling are necessary periodically to keep the 
government operating, lawmakers frequently attempt to attach their pet projects 
to such bills in an effort to ensure they become law. 
</P>
<P>
With its authority to borrow temporarily expired, the Treasury Department on 
Tuesday suspended sales of savings bonds and special state and local bonds and 
postponed auctions of $40 billion in securities. 
</P>
<P>
An amendment to the bill would repeal a provision of the 1986 tax revision law, 
bitterly fought by business, that was designed to prevent companies from 
discriminating against lower-paid workers in providing fringe benefits such as 
health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
An agreement worked out by congressional leaders also called for lawmakers to 
move quickly on a new bill aimed at resolving the controversial issue of 
catastrophic care for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from the Senate and House would be ordered to work out a compromise 
between the House position, which favors total repeal, and the Senate stance, 
which eliminates unlimited coverage for doctors' bills and prescription drugs 
but retains benefits for extended hospital care. Under both bills, the surtax 
of up to $800 imposed on the most affluent 40% of the elderly would be 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bush prodded lawmakers to pass a separate deficit-reduction bill 
that is needed to remove $16.1 billion in across-the-board cuts imposed last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
An acceptable bill, Bush told reporters at a news conference, would narrow the 
deficit gap by at least $14 billion, considerably more than either house has 
yet approved. Moreover, Bush said, "if it's all loaded up with special 
projects, I won't sign it." 
</P>
<P>
The immediate problem facing Congress, however, was the debt bill, which would 
raise the government's borrowing limit from $2.8 trillion to $3.1 trillion for 
the remainder of the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady told congressional leaders in a series of 
meetings and phone calls on Tuesday that the government could not tolerate 
further delay on the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The government has bumped up against its current credit limit and is unable to 
repay owners of about $13.8 billion worth of Treasury bills that fall due 
Thursday unless the higher debt ceiling is approved by then. 
</P>
<P>
Brady told the lawmakers that action on the debt bill is needed by early today 
"at the latest."

Kitty Dukakis was in an intensive-care unit Tuesday under observation for 
nausea and dizziness, but doctors refused to say if her ailment had any 
connection to previous drug or alcohol problems. 
</P>
<P>
The wife of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis said she was feeling "very poorly" and had 
asked that details of her illness be withheld from the public, Dr. Gerald R. 
Plotkin said at an evening news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"Kitty doesn't want to discuss any more about her condition," said Plotkin, the 
governor's personal physician. 
</P>
<P>
Dukakis, 52, was brought to Brigham and Women's Hospital by ambulance Monday 
night, then underwent tests Tuesday, one year after the governor was defeated 
in his presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
After Dukakis was admitted, Dukakis spokeswoman Mindy Lubber said the 
governor's wife was suffering flu-like symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
Plotkin refused to say whether Dukakis was suffering influenza or whether her 
life had at any time been in danger. 
</P>
<P>
"After five days at home during which Mrs. Dukakis experienced dizziness, 
headaches and severe nausea, she was admitted to the hospital . . . she is 
continuing to experience those same symptoms today," Plotkin said. 
</P>
<P>
The governor spent the entire day at his wife's side, and canceled all 
appointments scheduled for today.

E. GERMANY'S SUDDEN SHIFT HAS U.S. OFFICIALS ON GUARD; 
</P>
<P>
FOREIGN POLICY: BUSH IS PLEASED BY THE LATEST REFORMS. OTHER OFFICIALS WORRY 
ABOUT INSTABILITY OR VIOLENCE.

<P>
The Bush Administration, taken by surprise by East Germany's sudden lurch 
toward democratic reform, moved Tuesday to counter what officials called a 
dangerous potential for instability on the front line of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush on Tuesday called the East German government's behavior 
"encouraging" and said he believes that reform in the Soviet Bloc is becoming 
irreversible. "I think it's gone too far . . . to set back the fledgling steps 
toward democracy," he told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
But even as Bush expressed satisfaction and astonishment at the swift pace of 
change in East Germany, other officials said the Administration is worried 
about possible instability and even violence. 
</P>
<P>
"If the opposition runs amok, we've got a potential problem," one 
Administration official said. "It hasn't happened yet, but we have to plan for 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the heightened concern over East Germany, officials say, is 
geography. The country, created in 1949 from the Soviet-occupied sector of 
defeated Germany, is on the front line of the Warsaw Pact-North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization standoff. Long one of the world's most militarized countries, it 
is host to 380,000 Soviet troops. 
</P>
<P>
Another is the swiftness with which the country's political structure has been 
transformed. Until last month, only two men had ruled East Germany during its 
40 years of existence. But then, under pressure from a restive population 
demanding the same kind of reforms as other Soviet Bloc countries, the ruling 
Communist Party changed course. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the expected pace of events, U.S. troops who still occupy part of 
West Berlin have quietly prepared for several scenarios, including a mass 
attempt by demonstrators to break through the Berlin Wall. Officials say that 
possibility is highly unlikely in view of the East German government's decision 
to ease emigration, but they want to be prepared nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials are also discussing ways to help West Germany cope with the 
flood of East German refugees, which has reached about 190,000 this year with 
no sign of abating. And they said the United States is willing to join in a 
West German-led effort to help stabilize East Germany's economy under the newly 
reformist leadership of Communist chief Egon Krenz. 
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to look favorably" on economic aid efforts, one official said. 
"It may not be on the scale of our aid to Poland and Hungary . . . but we are 
willing." 
</P>
<P>
Since coming to power Oct. 18, Krenz has liberalized emigration, allowed 
massive protest demonstrations to pass unmolested, retired seven members of the 
party's Politburo and -- on Tuesday -- accepted the resignations of the entire 
Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, at his news conference, said Krenz's behavior "is quite encouraging and 
really contradicts the very early . . . assessment of the man." 
</P>
<P>
But another U.S. official, while praising Krenz as "reasonably flexible," 
warned: "I don't think Krenz is a reformer. He's just smart enough to know that 
he's not going to stay in power if he doesn't move." 
</P>
<P>
Experts outside the Administration offered even more dire forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are coming apart very fast," said Robert E. Hunter of the Center for 
Strategic and International Studies. "The inner German border (between West 
Germany and East Germany) is the most heavily militarized area in the world. 
What happens if something goes sour?" 
</P>
<P>
"The short-run worry is a real collapse (of the political system) that will 
lead to a flood of refugees and undermine the government's hold on power," said 
Gregory Treverton of the Council on Foreign Relations. "But if it's pushed too 
far, the East German government may decide that it needs to react. . . . There 
is always the possibility of violence." 
</P>
<P>
In the longer run, they said, Krenz's instability has reopened the larger 
"German Question": Are East and West Germany more likely now to bolt from the 
Warsaw Pact and NATO to make their own deal for reunification? 
</P>
<P>
"The German Question has been defused for 40 years," said Robert G. Livingston 
of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies. "What the East 
Germans are doing now has the effect of relighting that fuse." 
</P>
<P>
For more than a decade, he noted, West Germany has been quietly "stabilizing" 
its eastern cousin through direct economic aid and trade concessions under the 
theory that the relationship would some day help the two halves of the country 
to rejoin. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't think they ever had a real plan for what to do if a situation like 
this arose," he said.

Former Rhodesian leader Ian Smith has emerged victorious from a legal battle 
against the Zimbabwean government over his parliamentary salary. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court on Monday overturned a High Court ruling that had upheld the 
refusal of the House of Assembly, the country's Parliament, to pay him his 
salary for a five-month period in 1987 when he was suspended as a member. The 
Parliament took the action against Smith for his comments in praise of South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice Enoch Dumutshena said in his 40-page judgment that the Speaker of 
the Assembly had violated Smith's constitutional rights by suspending his 
salary payments.

One thing the people at Elvis Presley's house never run short of is rumors, so 
they're putting out the word early that the digging set to begin tonight at 
Graceland is nothing sinister. 
</P>
<P>
Crews are resealing the basement wall, that's all, said Todd Morgan, a 
spokesman for the Presley residence and its souvenir shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
The three-story, white-columned home draws 600,000 tourists a year. Rumors that 
Presley, who died 12 years ago, was alive set off a flurry of reported Elvis 
sightings a year or so ago. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever construction projects get under way at Graceland, the phones start 
ringing, Morgan said. "The simplest of household chores at Graceland become 
international headlines," he said.

SENATORS, EX-REGULATOR WAGING WAR OF LETTERS; 
</P>
<P>
ETHICS: LINCOLN S&amp;L CASE GENERATES ACERBIC CORRESPONDENCE. AT ISSUE: WAS A 
DEAL OFFERED? 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
They have not yet attained the notoriety of the Pentagon Papers or the Nixon 
tapes, but the ethics investigation of five U.S. senators tainted by the 
nation's biggest savings and loan failure may be influenced by the Lincoln 
letters. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of heated written exchanges, three U.S. senators and the 
government's former top thrift regulator disagreed over what they had discussed 
during a key 1987 meeting involving the future of troubled Lincoln Savings 
&amp; Loan of Irvine, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Edwin J. Gray, the former regulator, maintained that the senators who met with 
him on April 2, 1987, proposed a deal in which Lincoln would make more 
traditional home loans if Gray would withdraw a proposed investment rule 
opposed by Lincoln's owner, Charles H. Keating Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The senators have denied Gray's charge, and, in a more recent series of 
letters, Sens. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Dennis 
DeConcini (D-Ariz.) argued with Gray over his version of that meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The letters were among a series of exhibits that Gray provided to the House 
Banking Committee before he testified at a hearing Tuesday on Lincoln's 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
On May 25, 1989, McCain sent a letter to Gray that was conciliatory in tone, 
reminding the former regulator that McCain had said at the meeting that he did 
not want to do anything improper. He asked Gray to tell him if "any of my 
comments or actions in that meeting were improper." 
</P>
<P>
Gray responded on May 30 with a five-page, single-spaced letter detailing his 
recollection of the meeting and reasserting his belief that the senators had 
sought a "quid pro quo" for Keating. 
</P>
<P>
"I had never been asked until this meeting with you and your colleagues -- by 
any United States senator -- to withdraw a regulation for any reason, 
particularly on behalf of a friend, and especially in the privacy of a 
senatorial office," Gray wrote. 
</P>
<P>
McCain, who said he had checked with the other senators, wrote back three days 
later to say he recalled no deal or quid pro quo. "I regret that we disagree on 
the events of this meeting, but we do disagree," McCain wrote. 
</P>
<P>
On the same day, DeConcini wrote a blistering message to Gray: 
</P>
<P>
"There is little relationship between the meeting you describe and the one we 
held. Your recollection of the meeting is so distorted as to bear no 
resemblance to fact. . . . Your new allegations of 'a deal' are simply false. I 
am surprised and disappointed that a former high Administration official would 
stoop to this kind of duplicity." 
</P>
<P>
Gray's response was swift. On June 5, he sent DeConcini a one-page letter 
accusing him of using a "selective memory" to recall the events. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that what was said in that meeting is now emanantly (sic) 
embarrassing to you, Senator, does not mean that it did not occur," Gray wrote. 
"You cannot simply shred it because you are a United States Senator and are 
somehow above criticism . . . . Senatorial status does not immunize you from 
truthful disclosure." 
</P>
<P>
On June 7, Cranston wrote to Gray, saying that he was "astonished" by Gray's 
version of the events and that the discussion did not "even remotely" resemble 
Gray's account. 
</P>
<P>
"If Charles Keating had broken any laws, bring charges," Cranston wrote about 
his recollection of what he had said. "But, if a case could not be made against 
Lincoln, then bring a halt to what appeared to be the harassment to which 
Lincoln was being subjected by your regulators. Don't keep Keating twisting in 
the limbo of your bureaucrats' malicious indecision." 
</P>
<P>
Gray, responding in a June 15 letter, again said that his memory was accurate. 
Gray said also that he resented Cranston's reference to regulators as 
"malicious" or harassing, and he contended that "history now clearly shows" 
that Lincoln Savings was harassing regulators. 
</P>
<P>
"Your continuing efforts to, yes, intervene with regulators in behalf of 
Lincoln has occurred at the expense of the taxpayers and perhaps even at the 
expense of thousands of debt holders. I would hope that in the future, the 
taxpayers' interests -- rather than political contributors -- would be given 
the priority," Gray concluded. 
</P>
<P>
About a week later, Cranston called for a government inquiry to determine if 
regulators botched the Lincoln case and if federal deposit insurance funds 
should be used to pay back American Continental's debt holders. The General 
Accounting Office investigation is pending.

STRESSING CONCILIATORY POLITICS AIDED DINKINS; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: DEMOCRAT TURNED BACK GIULIANI'S EFFORTS TO MAKE CAMPAIGN INTO 
REFERENDUM ON CHARACTER.

<TEXT>
<P>
Democrat David N. Dinkins defeated former U.S. Atty. Rudolph W. Giuliani 
Tuesday by stressing the politics of conciliation in the face of Giuliani's 
efforts to turn the election into a referendum on character and competence. 
</P>
<P>
The 62-year-old Manhattan Borough president, who becomes the city's first black 
mayor, forged his winning coalition by building on his solid black base. He 
received virtually all black votes, 21% of all those cast, according to a 
WNBC-TV/New York Newsday exit poll. He also carried 71% of the Latino vote, 8% 
of the electorate. The 31% of the white vote he gained was enough to put him 
over the top. 
</P>
<P>
The election once again underscored the fact that New York is a liberal, 
Democratic city. Fully 56% of the voters called themselves Democrats, and they 
cast their ballots 2 to 1 for Dinkins; 35% labeled themselves as liberals and 
they voted almost 3 to 1 for Dinkins. 
</P>
<P>
"How far we have come since the days when my father was young," Dinkins told 
cheering supporters with his father at his side. "This year voters rejected the 
calls of fear and spoke with voices of hope. Nov. 7, 1989, is a date that will 
live in history." 
</P>
<P>
" . . . We passed another milestone on freedom's road, a victory not for 
African-Americans alone but for all New Yorkers and all Americans. Tonight is 
special in our city for another reason: No matter how tough things got in this 
campaign, we refused to yield the moral high ground," Dinkins said, amid cries 
of "David! David!" 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the final margin, I like to think we won a great victory against 
division and suspicion." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Giuliani telephoned Dinkins to offer his congratulations. 
</P>
<P>
"I have just spoken to Mayor-elect Dinkins," the former prosecutor said in his 
concession speech. Volleys of booing at Dinkins' name rang out in the ballroom 
of the Hotel Roosevelt amid chants of "Recount! Recount!" 
</P>
<P>
Giuliani had to shout to quiet the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"David Dinkins' victory is a historic event," the candidate told his 
disappointed supporters, who shouted back: "No! No!" 
</P>
<P>
"It is very important for this city to come together, we are going to unify 
behind the mayor of New York because that's the Democratic process and we 
believe in it," Giuliani added. "David Dinkins has achieved a historic victory 
here . . . David Dinkins will have a difficult task ahead of him." 
</P>
<P>
Despite intensive campaigning in Jewish neighborhoods, Dinkins failed to carry 
the Jewish vote. Jews -- traditionally loyal to the Democratic Party -- voted 
for Giuliani 3 to 2, according to the WNBC-TV/New York Newsday survey. 
According to the exit poll, 52% of Jews said the Rev. Jesse Jackson's 
involvement in the Dinkins campaign made it less likely they would vote for the 
Democratic contender. 
</P>
<P>
Giuliani, as expected, carried white Roman Catholics handily, winning by a 
better than 3-1 margin. He also carried independents and Republicans, but the 
total of both groups only composed 38% of voters. 
</P>
<P>
The defection of Jews from the Democratic Party was unusual and will present a 
major challenge for Dinkins as mayor. During the campaign, in an effort at 
reassurance, he had pledged before Jewish groups that Jackson would play no 
part in his Administration. 
</P>
<P>
According to the exit poll, Giuliani and Dinkins split the vote among men about 
evenly, while women gave Dinkins a decisive majority. 
</P>
<P>
As the results came in, Dinkins waited in his suite in a mid-Manhattan hotel. 
At one point, the soft-spoken candidate who majored in mathematics in college 
took out a small calculator to add up some of the figures. 
</P>
<P>
The election confirmed that the biggest concerns Dinkins as mayor will have to 
face are crime and drugs. Almost one-third of voters listed those as their 
principal worries. Only 4% cited race relations as the chief problem facing the 
next mayor. 
</P>
<P>
And in the glow of Dinkins' victory, voters already were beginning to remember 
three-term Mayor Edward I. Koch kindly. More than half of those surveyed by 
WNBC-TV and New York Newsday gave Koch a favorable job rating, against 33% who 
found his performance in office unfavorable. A total of 15% said they were 
unsure. 
</P>
<P>
But voters who said they approved of Koch voted for Giuliani, 60% to 38%. 
</P>
<P>
Some 3.2 million registered voters were eligible, and the turnout was heavy -- 
especially in black neighborhoods, where a sense of pride and destiny existed 
about Dinkins, the son of a Trenton, N.J., barber and longtime veteran of 
organization politics. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was looking forward to this day," said Shirlene Carter, after waiting 
a half-hour to vote in Harlem. "I voted for Dinkins . . . I want to see what he 
is going to do for the city." 
</P>
<P>
Carter, who works as a domestic, said she was surprised at the turnout when she 
voted at midday. "I had no idea there would be so many people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
John Del Giorno, a spokesman for the Board of Elections, said about 60% to 65% 
of registered voters cast their ballots in the election. 
</P>
<P>
Dinkins, who defeated Koch in the Democratic primary, ran a careful campaign in 
the mold of Mayor Tom Bradley. He was a non-threatening candidate, stressing 
inclusion and his ties to New York's Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the primary and the election, he described New York's multiple 
ethnic and racial groups as a "gorgeous mosaic" tied together by common needs 
and interests. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike in the primary, Jackson did not campaign for Dinkins. Koch campaigned 
with his fellow Democrat, especially among Jewish groups. 
</P>
<P>
The Manhattan Borough president benefited from strong union support. Bill 
Lynch, Dinkins' campaign manager, said some 12,000 volunteers were on the 
phones and on the street getting his candidate's voters to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a veritable army," conceded Raymond Harding, a key Giuliani adviser. 
In an effort to broaden his base, the former prosecutor also ran as the 
candidate of the Liberal Party. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Giuliani) came across too much as a prosecutor," Harding said, seeking to 
explain his candidate's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to consolidate his Democratic base, Dinkins pictured Giuliani as a 
Republican in the mold of former President Ronald Reagan, uncaring about the 
plight of the city. He charged that the White House was using Giuliani to 
establish a GOP beachhead in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Both the White House and the Democratic National Committee tried to affect the 
outcome of the mayoral election. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush and his wife campaigned for Giuliani, along with three Cabinet 
secretaries and White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the biggest names in the Democratic Party helped Dinkins. They included 
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, 
Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
Giuliani, in his first try at elected office, tried to picture his Democratic 
opponent as a captive of clubhouse politics and less than financially tidy. 
</P>
<P>
He attacked Dinkins for failure to pay income taxes two decades ago, for 
listing conflicting figures on the value of stock in a privately held company 
the Democratic candidate said he transferred to his son, and for not listing on 
a city disclosure form a trip he took to France that was partly paid for by a 
constituent. 
</P>
<P>
And even though he lost the election, Giuliani struck a responsive chord. The 
WNBC-TV/New York Newsday exit poll of 2,308 voters showed 51% said Dinkins' 
handling of his personal and campaign finances made them less confident of his 
ability to be a good mayor, against 36% who said these issues made no 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
Staff writers David Treadwell and Karen Tumulty and intern Kevin Davis also

ONE HAS TO 'MAKE A LIVING,' BUSH SAYS OF BIG REAGAN FEE

<P>
Although he has been in office for less than a year, President Bush has some 
thoughts about retirement income: He has no qualms about a former President 
being paid by private industry. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's got to make a living," he said at a news conference Tuesday in 
answering a question about the $2-million fee reportedly paid to former 
President Ronald Reagan by Japan's largest mass media conglomerate for a 
lecture tour of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
To a second question about the payment, Bush responded: "I will not have 
anything negative to say about President Reagan -- if that's an invitation for 
this -- because I prefer to emphasize the positive parts of that trip, talking 
openly about the need for freer trade, the affection shown to him by the 
Japanese people." 
</P>
<P>
When asked his opinion of payments by private industry to former presidents, 
Bush said: "I have no problem with that, provided it's not overdone." 
</P>
<P>
The President showed similar caution about wading into the question of whether, 
as vice president, he had rejected Nancy Reagan's request to urge President 
Reagan to dismiss Donald T. Regan as chief of staff in early 1987 during the 
depths of the Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Reagan wrote in her book, "My Turn," that she and Bush agreed that Regan 
should depart, but, when she asked him to take such a message to Reagan, he

SHUTTLE DISCOVERY TO LIFT OFF AFTER DARK

The space shuttle Discovery will lift off after dark on Nov. 20 on a secret 
military mission, NASA officials announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The space agency set the launching date after shuttle managers concluded a 
two-day review that assessed the readiness of the orbiter, the payload, the 
global tracking network and all other aspects of the mission. 
</P>
<P>
National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials said that liftoff will 
occur during a four-hour period starting at 6:30 p.m., only the third night 
launching in 32 shuttle flights. The precise time will not be made public until 
nine minutes before liftoff to make it harder for Soviet reconnaissance ships 
to track the shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Martin Marietta Corp. announced Tuesday that it will launch the 
first commercial payloads on its Titan 3 rocket on the night of Dec. 8. They 
will be communications satellites for Japan and Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
NASA earlier had announced the scheduled after-dark launching of the space 
shuttle Columbia on Dec. 18 to deploy a communications satellite and to track 
down and return to Earth a science satellite that has been in orbit for more 
than five years. 
</P>
<P>
The Discovery and Titan flights must be launched in the evening in order to 
place the satellites in desired orbits. The Columbia liftoff is timed to put 
the shuttle on course to intercept the satellite to be retrieved.

JUDGE FAVORS VOIDING PROP. 65 FOOD, DRUG EXEMPTION 
</P>

<P>
A Sacramento Superior Court judge indicated Tuesday that he is likely to throw 
out a state regulation that exempts foods, drugs and cosmetics from the 
requirements of California's antitoxics law. 
</P>
<P>
In a tentative decision, Judge Ronald B. Robie said the regulation granting the 
exemption is "not consistent" with Proposition 65 and therefore "is invalid on 
its face." 
</P>
<P>
But Robie withheld final action to scrap the controversial regulation until 
attorneys representing the state, environmentalists and industry groups can 
file another round of written arguments. 
</P>
<P>
Removal of the exemption, which is sought by environmentalists and organized 
labor, would lead to consumer warnings for products that pose a "significant 
risk" of causing cancer or reproductive harm. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the food, drug and cosmetics industries have fought hard to 
keep the exemption, but they have refused to say what products, if any, would 
fail to meet the standards of Proposition 65. 
</P>
<P>
The state Health and Welfare Agency, after persistent lobbying by the Grocery 
Manufacturers of America and other industry groups, adopted the regulation in 
February, 1988, granting an exemption to all foods, drugs, cosmetics and 
medical devices that meet existing federal standards. The products are all 
regulated by the federal Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
But California environmentalists contend that loopholes in the federal 
regulatory system allow consumers to be exposed to hazardous chemicals, 
particularly pesticide residues, in some of the products. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, environmentalists argue, federal standards are more lax than 
Proposition 65, which requires that there be "no significant risk." They point 
out that the FDA does not test food for the presence of some chemicals 
identified by the state as causing cancer or reproductive harm. 
</P>
<P>
"The FDA regulations have loopholes that Proposition 65 is designed to close," 
said David Roe, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund and a co-author 
of Proposition 65. "If the judge rules the way he is leaning, it will close 
those loopholes." 
</P>
<P>
The Grocery Manufacturers of America have argued that the nation's food supply 
is safe and that the FDA has done a good job of regulating the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Nedelman, a spokesman for the food manufacturers, said the industry is 
fighting to keep the exemption because it believes that food should be 
regulated solely by the federal government without interference from individual 
states. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to protect the confidence of the American people in the food 
supply," he said. 
</P>
<P>
State officials have long insisted that their regulation is not a blanket 
exemption for foods, drugs, cosmetics and medical devices because Proposition 
65 will still apply to those products that do not meet federal standards. 
</P>
<P>
But Robie quickly dismissed the contention, saying from the bench, "You have to 
call it an exemption because that's what it is." 
</P>
<P>
A decision to strike down the regulation would be a major victory for the 
AFL-CIO, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Natural Resources Defense Council 
and other environmental groups that brought the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the same labor and environmental coalition won a decision 
from Robie ordering the state to consider whether as many as 200 chemicals 
should be added to the list of 279 substances so far identified by the state as 
causing cancer or reproductive harm.

RAY JOHNSON; FORMER CONVICT TURNED TALENTS AGAINST CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE McGARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ray Johnson, 62, an ex-convict who dedicated the last 20 years of his life 
trying to prevent the kind of crimes that had landed him in California jails 
and prisons since he was 7, has died at Scripps Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who was born in New York and moved to San Diego with his family when 
he was 1, died Sunday of kidney failure. He had been in poor health for the 
past year, said Steve Casey, a longtime friend and spokesman for the San Diego 
district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Once characterized by a judge as a man "too dangerous to be at large," Johnson 
emerged from the California correctional system as an example of a 
rehabilitated felon who went on to make a contribution to society. 
</P>
<P>
Paroled from Folsom Prison in 1968, Johnson wearied of living outside the law 
and transformed his criminal expertise, developed primarily from burglaries and 
armed robberies, into a tool for fighting crime. He became an anti-crime 
consultant for such firms as the Southland Corp., owner of the 7-Eleven 
convenience stores, and was an internationally known anti-crime lecturer. His 
efforts were credited by 7-Eleven with a 20% decrease in robberies and 
burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was recognized in 1978 by then-San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson for his 
community service and for maintaining a crime-free existence for 10 years. In 
1988, Mayor Maureen O'Connor presented Johnson with a similar honor, 
celebrating 20 years of anti-crime behavior and service. 
</P>
<P>
The reformed felon co-authored an autobiography in 1975 and appeared on the 
"Tonight Show" with Johnny Carson on at least 30 occasions, said Casey, a 
former newspaper reporter who met Johnson when he covered San Diego courts and 
jails. 
</P>
<P>
When he died, Johnson, a resident of Del Mar, was working on an anti-robbery 
program for small businesses and a similar program for the elderly, Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is survived by his wife, Joanna. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service will be held at El Camino Mortuary in San Diego at 1 p.m. 
Monday.

GERALD JENNINGS; RAN WHEELCHAIR FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A memorial service has been scheduled Friday at 2 p.m. at the First United 
Methodist Church in Santa Monica for Gerald M. Jennings, chairman of the 
world's largest manufacturer of wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
Jennings was 70 when he died Sunday at UCLA Medical Center of congestive heart 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
The Everest &amp; Jennings medical supplies corporation, now based in 
Camarillo, was started in a family garage in Los Angeles by Jennings' father. 
Gerald Jennings once estimated that while he was at Everest &amp; Jennings, the 
company produced 3 million wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Topeka, Kan., Jennings moved to California as a youngster and later 
attended Santa Monica College and the Montana School of Mines. He planned to 
become a career officer after World War II military service but returned home 
instead to help his father's fledgling wheelchair business. 
</P>
<P>
Jennings retired as president in 1985 but continued as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Jennings was on the boards of directors of First Federal Bank of California 
from 1967-89 and for a decade before that at Santa Monica Bank. He was chairman 
of the board of trustees of Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center and chairman 
of the board of directors of the Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
He was also chairman of the UCLA School of Dentistry's board of counselors and 
benefactor of the school's Wilson, Jennings, Bloomfield Dental Clinic in 
Venice. He served on the UCLA Medical Center board of advisers. 
</P>
<P>
Jennings is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and two sons.

YUSAKU MATSUDA; PLAYED KILLER IN FILM 'BLACK RAIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yusaku Matsuda, who portrayed a young killer opposite Michael Douglas in the 
current popular film "Black Rain," has died of bladder cancer in Tokyo, Reuters 
news agency reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The news service quoted Japanese media sources as saying Matsuda, who portrays 
a renegade becoming a powerful force in the underworld, died Monday night. He 
was 40. 
</P>
<P>
The tall, chain-smoking Matsuda, who played Douglas' adversary in the picture 
about a macho cop from New York City who is trying to bring back an extradited 
murderer from Japan, was virtually unknown outside Japan until the release of 
the detective thriller, which was set and photographed in the western city of 
Osaka.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STATE URGED TO SPEND MORE TO UPGRADE BRIDGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More money needs to be spent to upgrade bridges to withstand an earthquake, 
state officials and engineers told a special hearing of the State Assembly 
Transportation Committee at Los Angeles City Hall Tuesday. Officials also were 
urged to move faster to make structures safe. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't solve these problems 18 years ago and they came back to haunt us 
last month," said Wilfred Iwan, a member of the State Seismic Safety 
Commission. The lessons learned from the Sylmar earthquake in 1971, which 
toppled a freeway interchange, were not acted upon quickly enough, he said, to 
forestall the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway in the Bay Area earthquake Oct. 
17. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz, committee chairman, said he called the hearing 
because "One of the casualties' of the Nimitz' collapse is public confidence 
that freeways and highways we travel every day will be 'safe' in an 
earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
Information that comes out of the hearing will be used in developing future 
legislation, a legislative aide said. 
</P>
<P>
Although a three-phase Caltrans program was started after the 1971 earthquake 
to shore up 2,500 of the most vulnerable bridges and elevated roadways in 
California, only the first phase has been completed. James E. Roberts, chief of 
the Caltrans structures division, said the money needed to strengthen state 
bridges alone is $300 to $500 million.

BILL BOYARSKY: SUDDENLY, SOMETHING IN COMMON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fear of crime and drugs has created a new and unlikely coalition between 
neighborhoods in the suburban San Fernando Valley and South-Central Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
These two areas, which have had little in common in the past, now confront the 
same problem. Both are experiencing an influx of prostitutes and heavily armed 
drug dealers. Parts of the Valley, in fact, have become as dangerous as some of 
South-Central's inner-city neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The shared threat has created an alliance between two Los Angeles City Council 
members as different as their districts. Nate Holden, a black inner-city 
politician who likes to play rough, and Joel Wachs, a gentlemanly voice of 
prosperous, predominantly white suburbia, want the police to respond by putting 
more foot patrols on the streets of their districts. 
</P>
<P>
The alliance is evidence of how the city is changing. 
</P>
<P>
A decade or so ago, Valley council members and those from South-Central seemed 
to represent different cities. But pockets of poverty and crime gradually 
developed in many parts of the Valley. When district lines were redrawn a few 
years ago, Wachs found himself representing one especially dangerous high-crime 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs came under increasing pressure from residents who wanted the foot cops to 
make their neighborhoods safer. Across town, in the Crenshaw and mid-Wilshire 
areas, Holden was feeling the same pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs and Holden are not particularly close. But circumstances threw them 
together. First working separately, they proposed additional foot patrols. Then 
they joined forces to get City Council approval, something that was needed 
because their proposals required more money. 
</P>
<P>
Setting up a foot patrol is more expensive than putting officers in cars. It's 
not just a matter of sending out a couple of beat cops. These are dangerous 
streets, and officers go out in patrols of eight or 10. Patrols split up into 
teams of two, but everyone must keep in radio contact. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs and Holden needed the support of Mayor Tom Bradley and Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky. As mayor, Bradley approves appropriations. Yaroslavsky runs the 
finance committee, which screens all money matters. 
</P>
<P>
But Bradley and Yaroslavsky said the department had enough funds and officers 
on hand to increase the foot patrols. They noted the department had increased 
in size from 6,900 to about 7,900 in the past four years and was authorized to 
go to 8,400 officers by next year. 
</P>
<P>
Although Holden and Wachs didn't plan it that way, their personalities threw 
them into the roles of the old game of "good cop, bad cop." It was just the 
right game for that moment. 
</P>
<P>
Roughhouse politician Holden, the bad cop, brought angry constituents to the 
council chamber. Although his move was resented by colleagues, council members, 
under the glare of television coverage, voted more money. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley vetoed the appropriation and, with Yaroslavsky helping him on the 
council floor, the veto was sustained. 
</P>
<P>
Then Wachs, the good cop, put together a compromise: Department funds would be 
used for a "pilot program" of more walking patrols until the end of the year. 
Additional foot patrols were ordered for 18 areas around the city, including 
Wachs' and Holden's districts. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Valley half of the coalition savored its victory. Wachs and 
police officers held a press conference on Columbus Avenue near Nordhoff 
Street, a place significant in the fight for more foot patrols. 
</P>
<P>
The street is lined with two- and three-story apartment buildings that were 
Valley luxury when they were built 15 years ago. Most of the residents are 
working-class Latino families. To a stranger, the buildings look peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
But drug dealers also live there, selling from their front doors and on the 
street. Also in the building are prostitutes who work the motel strip on nearby 
Sepulveda Boulevard. The combination terrorizes the other residents. 
</P>
<P>
Foot patrols financed by the pilot program have been on the street for a month. 
While crime went down, violence remained. Now, with support from Wachs, police 
have erected a barricade to keep drug customers away. The press conference was 
held to announce that officers on foot will bar everyone but residents, their 
guests and commercial vehicles from the area. 
</P>
<P>
This is a major test. If the combination of patrols and the barricade clean up 
Columbus Avenue, the council and Bradley will find it difficult to resist 
demands for more money for the foot cops.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PUBLIC DEFENDER MAY SUE OVER SEIZURE IN COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A deputy public defender who was dragged from a hearing and pushed through a 
door by two Los Angeles police officers said Tuesday that he has retained a 
lawyer for possible legal action against the officers and the judge who asked 
them to bring him from another courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Howard C. Waco said he may file a lawsuit against 
Officers Nicholas Titiriga and Gregory Baltad and Van Nuys Superior Court Judge 
Raymond T. Mireles. Waco said he also may file complaints with police and 
judicial authorities over the conduct of Mireles and the officers. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to see that this sort of thing never happens again," he said. "The 
system went amok. When someone from the judiciary calls out the goon squad to 
come get you, you're in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
The two Metropolitan Division officers are already facing contempt of court 
charges in a hearing before Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Alan B. Haber. Waco 
was in Haber's courtroom when the officers dragged him out. Mireles needed Waco 
in his courtroom to discuss scheduling a legal hearing in which the public 
defender was the defense attorney, witnesses said.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANTI-GRAFFITI PROGRAM READY TO BE IMPLEMENTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles, stepping up the fight against graffiti on private 
property, has kicked off a new program that allows city workers to clean the 
offending markings and, if necessary, send a bill to property owners who do not 
cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council unanimously approved an ordinance in August declaring graffiti 
illegal and authorizing work crews to enter private property, clean the 
graffiti and place a lien on the property to recover costs if the property 
owner does not give the city permission to remove it for free. 
</P>
<P>
The new law took effect Oct. 5 and the departments of Public Works and Building 
and Safety are ready to begin implementing the program -- boosted by $500,000 
from the council -- and enforce the law, according to Councilman Joel Wachs. 
</P>
<P>
"We are making a full-fledged commitment to eradicate something that is really 
plaguing the city," Wachs said. "Graffiti really has a detrimental effect and 
shows a total disregard for property rights." 
</P>
<P>
Under the program the Department of Building and Safety's 150 inspectors will 
be looking for violations throughout the city. Letters will be sent to property 
owners telling them of the city's offer to remove the graffiti and informing 
them of the consequences should they refuse to cover it over or allow the city 
to do if for them. 
</P>
<P>
The Public Works Department has awarded contracts to numerous community 
organizations for the graffiti removal.

NEIGHBORHOOD IS BLOCKED OFF TO THE COCAINE TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unable to halt a tide of drive-through drug traffic in a four-block area of 
Sepulveda known by cocaine buyers and peddlers as "C Street," Los Angeles 
officials blocked off the streets Tuesday to prevent the criminals from getting 
in. 
</P>
<P>
At 9:30 a.m. police began setting up barricades at entrances to the Columbus 
Avenue neighborhood at Nordhoff Street, Rayen Street, Sepulveda Boulevard and 
Parthenia Street. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said a force of 12 police officers will man the roadblocks and patrol 
the four-block area on foot and in cars 24 hours a day. Police would not say 
how long the barricades and the officers will stay in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The street blockade is similar to the "Neighborhood Rescue Operation" launched 
by police in a drug and gang-riddled neighborhood near MacArthur Park near 
downtown last month. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the Columbus Avenue neighborhood, just three blocks east of the San 
Diego Freeway, has been the "hot spot" in the San Fernando Valley for drug 
dealing. A Valley narcotics unit had been making about 50 arrests a month on 
the two-block stretch of Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
And while police said the recent addition of officers on foot beats in the 
neighborhood had slowed drug and gang crimes, the problems have stubbornly 
persisted, prompting the roadblocks. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a sad commentary on the state of affairs in our society that we are 
closing streets off," said Police Lt. Gary Rogness, head of a Valley-based 
narcotics unit. "But it is a measure that needs to be taken in that area to 
restore the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
The police received no resistance to the barricades from residents of the 
neighborhood Tuesday. Many who stood by during a press conference at Columbus 
and Nordhoff termed the efforts overdue but possibly not enough. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Greva, 77, said he welcomed the barricades and the increased police 
presence. He said he takes daily walks in his neighborhood, but never at night. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd be a fool to go out at night," he said. "This is a tough neighborhood. 
At night you hear hollering like mad out on the street. There are gunshots." 
</P>
<P>
When police put barricades up in a Pico-Union neighborhood near MacArthur Park 
on Oct. 19, officials reported an immediate slowdown in drug and gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
The same effect was predicted for Columbus Avenue, which has become known as "C 
Street" among the cocaine buyers and sellers, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate it will be controlled almost immediately," said Capt. Mark 
Stevens, commanding officer of the Devonshire Division. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens said the streets were closed under a 30-day emergency permit from the 
city Department of Transportation. He said the Police Department will seek 
approval of permanent closure of the streets through the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens said only residents of the neighborhood, their friends and people who 
have business in the neighborhood will be allowed to enter through a checkpoint 
at Rayen Street and Sepulveda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
However, the checkpoint was informal in practice on Tuesday. Officers did not 
check the identification of those requesting entrance to the neighborhood. 
Those who said they lived there were waved through after being told what the 
roadblock operation was about. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said neighborhood enforcement efforts will continue even after 
visible criminal activities drop. 
</P>
<P>
"It can't be a one-time effort," said Councilman Joel Wachs, whose district 
includes the neighborhood. "It has to be sustained. Today is the beginning of 
an ongoing effort."

TWO WINDOW WASHERS RESCUED 12 STORIES UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASHLEY DUNN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two high-rise window washers dangled 12 stories above Hollywood for half an 
hour Tuesday after a steel beam supporting their mechanized scaffold broke and 
nearly sent them tumbling to the pavement below. 
</P>
<P>
David O'Dell, 33, and Frank Butler, 44, clung to their precarious perch until 
firefighters broke through a 12th-floor office window and brought them inside 
to safety. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one weird experience," Butler said after being treated for a badly cut 
knee at Queen of Angels/Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
O'Dell was not injured, although he was visibly shaken from the experience as 
he waited for Butler in the hospital emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going back to driving," said O'Dell, a part-time truck driver. "This 
death-defying stuff . . . I'm through with it." 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred just before 11:30 a.m. as O'Dell and Butler were 
descending the west side of the Hollywood Center building at 6922 Hollywood 
Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
The men had already washed one set of windows that morning and had moved the 
mechanized scaffold over to wash the next set. 
</P>
<P>
O'Dell, a window washer for eight years, said the scaffold had just started to 
descend when he felt a jolt that dropped one end about three feet. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like the bottom just fell out," O'Dell said. "I just kept thinking: 
'Lights out, curtains, the end.' " 
</P>
<P>
O'Dell grabbed the scaffold's railing and looked up at the broken steel support 
that was snagged on the outside of the building. The support anchors a steel 
cable that runs down the side of the building and holds up the scaffold. 
</P>
<P>
"That thing was just hanging on," O'Dell said. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, the owner of Prestige Window Cleaning, was on the other end of the 
scaffold when the arm broke and he slid a few feet to a corner of the scaffold. 
</P>
<P>
Butler said he tried to get up to climb a rope up to the top of the building, 
but O'Dell yelled at him: "Don't shake! Don't move!" 
</P>
<P>
They sat motionless as they waited for help to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt every second," O'Dell said. "You fall from 12 stories and there's 
nothing to catch." 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred in front of the 12th-floor office of Bob Chasin, a vice 
president with Fries Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Chasin was stunned when he heard the scaffold crash against the building, 
sending buckets of water and window washing brushes against his office window. 
</P>
<P>
Chasin quickly scribbled a note on a piece of paper and held it up to Butler on 
the other side of the window: "Calling Fire Department." 
</P>
<P>
As the two men waited, O'Dell looked down at the crowd of onlookers scurrying 
far below him. 
</P>
<P>
One bystander yelled up to him: "Are you guys all right?" 
</P>
<P>
O'Dell yelled back: "No!" 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters arrived in a few minutes and secured the broken steel arm with 
high-strength rope, Fire Capt. Rick Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
Then they broke through Chasin's office window and brought the two men inside. 
</P>
<P>
O'Dell said he and Butler traded relieved looks and then gave each other a 
quick salute. 
</P>
<P>
In the hospital emergency room, Butler said he has no plans to quit the window 
washing business that he has been in for 17 years. In fact, Butler said he 
intends to go back and finish cleaning the windows on the Hollywood Center 
building as soon as his leg heals. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't going to change the pattern of my business," he said. "Life goes 
on."

COUNTY OKS PLAN TO TAX BIG ROCK MESA RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved a county plan to tax Big Rock Mesa 
homeowners more than $100,000 each to help pay for stabilizing the 
landslide-plagued community above Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Rejecting pleas by residents that the county help pay for part of the project, 
the supervisors gave the go-ahead for an elaborate drainage system to reduce 
the risk of a massive slide such as the one that damaged or destroyed 250 Big 
Rock homes in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"We had hoped that they would realize this is too much of a burden for us to 
bear, and instead the county sold us out," homeowner Dennis Sinclair said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents say the plan to shore up the slide-prone promontory, which will 
nearly triple their property taxes, is too expensive and does not guarantee 
against a disaster on the order of the 1983 slide. The homeowners would have to 
pay the $100,000 over a 20-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Several homeowners said that they may sue the county to try to block the plan. 
However, a spokesman for the Big Rock Improvement Committee, which includes 
most of the property owners, said it was too early for the group to decide its 
next move. 
</P>
<P>
County officials first recommended the $13.8-million improvement package in 
September, but the supervisors delayed approval after a storm of protest from 
Big Rock residents. 
</P>
<P>
After 4 1/2 years of litigation, the county, the California Department of 
Transportation, dozens of insurance companies and attorneys for about 240 Big 
Rock homeowners reached a settlement last January that will pay the homeowners 
$97 million -- or about $200,000 apiece after legal fees -- for the damage they 
suffered as a result of the massive 1983 slide. The county's portion of the 
settlement was about $35 million. 
</P>
<P>
But many of those same residents, as well as some who were not part of the 
lawsuit and others who bought their homes after the litigation began, were 
stunned by the county's plans to increase their property taxes to help 
stabilize the mesa. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 property owners, whose homes on Pacific Coast Highway suffered little 
or no damage as a result of the slide, are upset that their properties were 
included in the assessment district, insisting that the plan to shore up the 
mesa will not benefit them. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want a dime from the county; my house is fine," said Don Tollefson, 
whose home faces the highway. "I don't think it's right that I have to pay $500 
a month for the next 20 years for something that's not going to benefit me." 
</P>
<P>
In a last ditch effort Tuesday, homeowner spokesman Sinclair told the 
supervisors that "a significant number" of residents would drop their protest 
if the county agreed to pay up to 30% of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
But the suggestion drew a chilly response from supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Pete Schabarum lashed out at the residents for having "a narrow 
point of view" and blamed "greedy attorneys" for standing in the way of the 
county's stabilizing the mesa. 
</P>
<P>
However, John B. Murdock, an attorney for homeowners, called the assessment 
"unfair," and he said it violated a promise made as part of the settlement that 
the county would not try to recoup money from Big Rock residents by means of 
new taxes.

'AMERICAN LANDSCAPE VIDEO' EXHIBIT BREAKS NEW GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In case we were becoming complacent, 15 terrible seconds last month gave us all 
the proof we needed of nature's freakish and terrible willfulness. With TV 
images of the San Francisco earthquake burned into our minds by constant 
replay, a new exhibit at Newport Harbor Art Museum seems particularly timely. 
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, "American Landscape 
Video: The Electronic Grove" (to Dec. 31) presents six large video 
installations produced during the last decade by Bill Viola, Rita Myers, Dara 
Birnbaum, Frank Gillette, Doug Hall and Steina Vasulka. 
</P>
<P>
Their landscape imagery ranges from the grandiloquent turbulence and shock 
effects of Hall's "The Terrible Uncertainty of the Thing Described" to the 
cerebral calm of Gillette's "Aransas." 
</P>
<P>
Hall offers large-screen images of raging fire, billowing smoke and torrential 
floods -- and a real jolt of lightning that leaps between two tall metal chairs 
screened off by a high-wire fence in the gallery. Gillette surrounds the viewer 
with monitors displaying peaceful distant and close-up views of the woods and 
marshes of Aransas County, Tex., in a slow, rhythmic sequence. 
</P>
<P>
For many viewers, the idea of a video "portrait" of landscape may be hard to 
reconcile with the familiar, hand-crafted qualities of landscape painting -- or 
even with a stationary photographic image. 
</P>
<P>
But the landscape tradition in American art already has undergone great changes 
during the last century, from abstract painting to Earth Art. By turning to 
video, artists gain a number of advantages lost to cutting-edge art since the 
19th Century, as well as others perhaps undreamed of by earlier generations. 
Video, after all, offers not only intimacy and directness, but also the 
user-friendly, non-elitist quality of TV viewing. 
</P>
<P>
Working outside the loop of TV's consumer culture, however, artists are free to 
use the special features of video medium (including the ability to fragment, 
rearrange and instantly replay footage) to present unusual, unsettling and 
difficult ideas. 
</P>
<P>
In the installations, video monitors either create an "environment" all by 
themselves or function as elements within a larger sculptural or architectural 
setting. 
</P>
<P>
Viola's "Room for St. John of the Cross," from 1983, is a particularly 
evocative blending of video with other media -- a superb example of the power 
of video to convey serious, humanistic ideas as well as flashy, nihilistic 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
St. John of the Cross was a 16th-Century Spanish monk imprisoned by the 
religious Establishment after introducing a new austerity into the Carmelite 
order. 
</P>
<P>
In a darkened gallery, Viola places an imagined replica ofSt. John's tiny cell 
with its thick walls and earthen floor. A small table inside holds a glass and 
pitcher of water -- and a miniature portable TV displaying the image of a 
snow-capped mountain peak. 
</P>
<P>
In Spanish, a recorded male voice softly recites St. John's intensely spiritual 
poetry. On a huge video screen outside the cell, the same mountain peak lurches 
and trembles in black and white, as if laboriously photographed, bit by bit, 
with a hand-held camera. 
</P>
<P>
The small, unchanging view of the mountain is symbolic ofSt. John's 
contemplative state, a serene and focused view of the true purpose of life. The 
jerky large view of the mountain seems to represent the confused, distracted, 
partial understanding we have of life as we rush through it, oblivious to 
higher things. 
</P>
<P>
In Myers' "Rift Rise," images of destruction (fire, charred tree branches) and 
renewal (rushing water, green leaves) play on both sides of opposing banks of 
monitors, one made of sharp-edged black slabs, the other covered with live 
birch trees. At once very simple and very grand in scope, the installation 
offers a five-minute meditation on the cycle of life. 
</P>
<P>
Vasulka's "The West" is the most visually complex piece in the show, though 
ultimately it seems to have less meaning than the others. Images of man-made 
and natural sights from the New Mexico desert play over 22 double-stacked 
monitors for 30 minutes, subjected to lots of fancy cutting and coloristic 
manipulations. But sheer technical wizardry overshadows the inherent wonder and 
grandeur of the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Birnbaum's "Will-O'-the-Wisp" (part of her "Damnation of Faust" series, begun 
in 1983) is the most elusive of the six works. Three color monitors are mounted 
on a 36-foot-wide photographic enlargement that can just barely be read as a 
woman's face. 
</P>
<P>
This latter-day Marguerite (the woman Faust seduces) appears in the video as a 
dreamy face surrounded by green foliage. Eventually, the foliage turns autumnal 
red and there are quick glimpses of children gathered at a doorway. Meanwhile, 
the woman's voice murmurs inaudibly on the sound track, recounting her 
abandonment by her lover. 
</P>
<P>
The piece -- which, to be fair, was partly malfunctioning last week -- seems to 
be about the way the environment colors memory and affects mood. But the clues 
were vague and the repeated image of the woman's face unsettlingly reminiscent 
of insipid commercials for intimate products.

<P>
The Senate approved legislation to create an independent inspector general for 
the CIA who would be nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. At 
present, the inspector general is appointed by the CIA director and reports 
only to him. The measure is a reaction to the impression that the agency 
watchdog may not have been aggressive enough in ferreting out the CIA's role in 
the Iran-Contra scandal. The bill to which the legislation is attached was 
passed on a voice vote. President Bush is strongly opposed to both the Senate 
measure and a different House-passed version and has threatened a veto.

Heavy rain drenched the South, flooding the streets of New Orleans with as much 
as 3 feet of water, while severe weather swept across the Midwest and 
threatened to spawn tornadoes in at least four states. Up to 9 inches of rain 
fell on the greater New Orleans area in a 4-hour period, causing widespread 
flooding in the city and surrounding parishes. Some streets were under as much 
as 3 feet of water. Thunderstorms and heavy rains also swept through Jackson, 
Miss., causing some flash flooding. Thunderstorms produced heavy rain across 
the nation's midsection and threatened tornadoes in eastern Missouri, southern 
Illinois, western Kentucky and west Tennessee.

Potential jurors will be interviewed starting today in Carrollton, Ky., about 
their awareness of drunken driving as the trial starts for a man accused of 
killing 27 people in a fiery bus crash on the night of May 14, 1988. The 
prosecution charged that Larry Mahoney was drunk behind the wheel of his pickup 
truck traveling the wrong way on Interstate 71 when he slammed into a bus from 
a Radcliff church returning from an amusement park outing. Mahoney, 36, pleaded 
guilty to driving under the influence several years ago in another case.

NFL UNION SEEKS DECERTIFICATION; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: GENE UPSHAW INFORMS OWNERS THAT THE PLAYERS HAVE DECIDED TO STOP 
BARGAINING COLLECTIVELY IN ORDER TO GAIN FREE AGENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the last eight years, the average annual salary for a National Football 
League player -- as bargained for individually with club managers -- has jumped 
from about $100,000 to about $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, each player's annual benefits package -- as worked out in 
collective bargaining with the league -- has remained unchanged at about 
$50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Those numbers brought an extraordinary response from the NFL Players Assn. this 
week. The union announced that it has decided to discontinue bargaining 
collectively with the NFL's club owners. 
</P>
<P>
"Our members have been informed by the courts that we must choose one course of 
action or the other," Doug Allen, an NFLPA executive, said Tuesday from 
Washington. "We must choose between the right to bargain for (wages) 
collectively or individually. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a Hobson's choice, of course, but we've made it. Our players have 
found that individual bargaining is much more (valuable). They wish to maximize 
their individual leverage in a free-market environment. 
</P>
<P>
"In other words, we are choosing free agency over (collective bargaining). 
That's free agency after the players' present individual contracts expire." 
</P>
<P>
The union's action was reported in a letter from Gene Upshaw, the NFLPA's 
executive director, to Jack Donlan, who represents the league as executive 
director of the NFL's Management Council. 
</P>
<P>
"The NFLPA has voted to begin . . . decertification (as a union)," Upshaw told 
Donlan. 
</P>
<P>
After releasing Upshaw's letter to the media, Donlan, noting that the National 
Basketball Assn. players' union also talked about decertifying before signing 
another bargaining agreement recently, told NFL club owners in a memo from New 
York: "The NFLPA's decertification threat may be genuine or it may be viewed by 
the union as useful strategy." 
</P>
<P>
Said Allen: "It is not a strategy. It is an action made inevitable in this case 
by (the courts)." 
</P>
<P>
Donlan was similarly emphatic on the point that most affects the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"All players will not become free agents by reason of decertification," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We continue to believe that a resumption of negotiations would best serve the 
players' interests." 
</P>
<P>
Reports that the union is disbanding brought a flat denial from Allen, who is 
Upshaw's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
"As an organization, we'll continue to pursue the rights of our individual 
members in the same sense that bar associations represent lawyers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Upshaw, defining the change in NFLPA function, said: "We will not allow the 
owners to hide behind the union to limit free agency or to impose a veterans' 
wage scale." 
</P>
<P>
Implicit in the NFLPA's action is a threat to the right of the NFL to conduct 
its annual player draft. 
</P>
<P>
The courts have held that the draft and other similarly restrictive NFL 
measures require authorization in a collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Culverhouse of Tampa Bay, the club owner who oversees the Management 
Council, said: "We aren't union-busters. We need the union." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers on both sides have a word for that need: shield. The NFL's draft would 
be blatant restraint of trade but for the shield of an NFL-NFLPA agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Said Upshaw: "The antitrust shield has now been removed. . . . We didn't form 
our union to allow (the NFL) to illegally restrain trade." 
</P>
<P>
As of 1989, the shield has become the key bargaining chip in NFL labor 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it has been at the heart of every recent court decision involving the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
The question the judges all ask is, when does pro football's shield expire? 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a federal court in Minneapolis held that it ends when the 
opposing parties, the NFL and NFLPA, reach a negotiating impasse. 
</P>
<P>
That impasse has apparently long since arrived. These particular opposing 
parties, who weathered a strike two years ago, signed their last collective 
bargaining agreement seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
When, however, the NFL appealed the Minneapolis result to the eighth circuit in 
St. Louis, it got a reversal. Two of three judges there held that as long as 
there is an ongoing relationship between the parties, there is no impasse. 
</P>
<P>
The player response was this week's announcement that the union has severed 
that ongoing relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Does that end the draft? Will it bring free agency? Not yet. The next judge 
still has to be heard. And the next . . .

KNICKS RECONSIDER THEIR COURSE AFTER LOSING TO ORLANDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
ORLANDO, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In one sense, Stu Jackson's record is deceptive. Yes, it is 1-2, but think 
about it. So far, the Knicks have lost only to the world champion Pistons and 
Magic. And Magic has beaten a lot of teams. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Jackson, the Knicks lost to the wrong Magic -- not Johnson, 
but Orlando. The working theory before the Knicks' acutely embarrassing 118-110 
loss Monday night was that the scheduling gods had been nice to the Knicks. 
After the Detroit Pistons, their next seven games had them playing three 
expansion teams, three non-playoffs teams, and the lowest Western Conference 
qualifier from last season. For Jackson, there were enticing possibilities -- 
7-1, 6-2. And the worst seemed to be 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
After Monday night's loss, however, the working theory of a kind scheduling god 
was not applicable. Instead, the working theory, popularized in other parts of 
the country, was the "gutless pig theory." That is a rather crude way of saying 
a team has no heart, and Jackson, in his own way, was saying that about the 
Knicks Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"The Orlando Magic simply wanted the game from an emotional standpoint a little 
more than we did," Jackson said, and went on to criticize his team's effort. 
"They're not battling on the backboards. This is a very disheartening loss for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Still, despite the loss, Knicks fans should be encouraged about Jackson's head 
coaching future because he is a coach who looks at the future and cowers, which 
is a sign of greatness. And he was like that before the game Monday night. The 
best NBA coaches fear failure, fear the opposition, fear expectations and fear 
fear. It is a healthy way to feel. When a head coach is scared of everyone, he 
takes no one for granted. The only trick is to convey that fear to the players, 
and have them listen. Jackson told them the Magic would play hard. The Knicks 
apparently didn't listen. 
</P>
<P>
But now, maybe they will. And the schedule still is polite. The Knicks still 
have games against the New Jersey Nets, Los Angeles Clippers, Sacramento Kings 
and Minnesota Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's only problem right now is that he can't teach heart. But the loss may 
work in his favor. One way to gain credibility with the players is to be 
successful. Despite their outward enthusiasm for Jackson, they had to wonder if 
he was ready for the big time. He had never coached before. Would a rookie 
system work in the NBA? 
</P>
<P>
A few victories would give reason to believe in Jackson. But now the players 
know that Jackson was right about one thing. Before the game, he said the Magic 
was capable of kicking the Knicks' collective butt. And the Magic did. So 
perhaps the other way to gain credibility is to predict doom accurately. 
</P>
<P>
"I know this," Jackson said, "there are no 'gimmes' in this league. In the 
beginning, everybody is tough. It's in the middle of the year when they start 
losing that they get down. That doesn't happen at the beginning of the year. I 
know the public will never buy this, but the schedule looks a lot better on 
paper than it is." 
</P>
<P>
Whether the public buys it or not is insignificant. The important thing was for 
the players to buy it, and they didn't. Maybe they will now. 
</P>
<P>
But besides heart, Jackson also may question the player's mental capabilities. 
Their short-term memories do not seem to be in full working order. It was only 
last season when they visited Charlotte for the first time. They lost. And 
later, they also lost in Miami. They even lost at home against the Hornets. 
Expansion teams lack talent, but they do try hard. They often refuse to give 
up. That's called heart. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been through this," Jackson said. "Evidently we didn't learn our 
lesson." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was clearly disgusted by the lost opportunity. The Boston Celtics have 
won their first two games and are intent on recapturing the division title. And 
one thing is certain. If Larry Bird &amp; Co. loses to Magic, it won't be the 
one in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
Beating the Magic requires no hocus-pocus. It merely requires consistent 
effort, which, coincidentally, is also a trait of champions. If the Knicks are 
not as successful as they were last season, they eventually may question 
Jackson's system. After Monday night, however, it would be appropriate for them 
to question themselves.

BO REMAINS NONPLUSSED BY HIS OWN FEATS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: RUNNING BACK DISMISSES HIS ROLE IN THE RAIDER RENAISSANCE. BUT 
MOST EVERYONE ELSE HAS TAKEN PROPER NOTICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILBON, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The great ones rarely are impressed by their own feats, so excuse Bo Jackson if 
he fails to understand all the ruckus people are making over his 303 yards 
rushing the last two weeks, his 73-yard run against the Washington Redskins and 
his 92-yard run here Sunday against the Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
"My grandmother could have run that play," he said of the 92-yard, team 
record-setting touchdown run. He may believe that, but, truth is, there are few 
backs in the history of pro football who are capable of doing what he has done 
the last two weeks, after just finishing a baseball season in which he hit 32 
home runs and drove in 105 runs. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati Bengals Coach Sam Wyche, a difficult-to-impress man, was nearly in 
disbelief after watching Jackson rush for 159 yards and two touchdowns in just 
13 carries. "Bo is as advertised," Wyche said. "He's one of the rare ones to 
come along. I just hope that he'll be appreciated as long as he's here, 
especially while he's still a healthy, young, frisky back. He's going to be 
talked about as one of the legends of the game, believe you me." 
</P>
<P>
Despite having played only four games and averaging only 16 carries, Jackson is 
on a pace to gain 1,284 yards and is averaging 7.4 yards per carry. By halftime 
against the defending AFC champion Bengals, he had rushed 127 yards. Because 
the Raiders were so far ahead -- they led 28-0 on their way to a 28-7 victory 
at Memorial Stadium -- Jackson carried only four times the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the MVP of the (baseball) all-star game," Raiders cornerback Mike 
Haynes said. "I think this year he's trying to get to be MVP of the Pro Bowl 
and become the answer to a trivia question. He just seems to be possessed this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
The 92-yard run was the crown jewel -- so far. Many great runs involve players 
such as Earl Campbell and Larry Csonka trampling defenders, Jim Brown and 
Walter Payton stiff-arming men to the ground, O.J. Simpson weaving and cutting 
through traffic. Jackson's run didn't have any of that drama because nobody 
touched him. He assumed a Carl Lewis pose and sprinted to the goal line. The 
run was so breathtaking the Raiders were fighting each other to retell the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a great view," quarterback Jay Schroeder said. "Turned around, flipped 
him the ball, made sure there was nobody coming from the back side. By the time 
I turned around again, he's running down the sideline. So I put my hands up 
(signaling touchdown). There's one defensive guy crossing the field to make it 
look good. He's not going to catch Bo. So I put my hands up. Turned around, 
started slapping hands with the offensive linemen. Bo is probably about their 
20-yard line by now." 
</P>
<P>
Even what Bo didn't do was impressive. On the first play from scrimmage, 
Schroeder faked a pitch to Jackson, a move that drew the entire defense toward 
Jackson. Schroeder then threw 63 yards to Willie Gault. Al Davis, the Raiders' 
managing partner, studied film all week and knew it would work. "It was 
incredible," guard John Gesek said. "We talked about that play for four days." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the Raiders and Bengals lined up to praise Jackson. Even after he 
pointed his fingers like imaginary six-shooters, the Bengals had no qualms. 
"Bo'd probably be the best back in the league if he played football full-time 
-- if he isn't already," Bengals cornerback Eric Thomas said. "All I can say 
is, 'More power to him.' " 
</P>
<P>
Raiders defensive end Howie Long said Jackson will only flourish under new 
coach Art Shell, whose offense is simple and whose personality is a lot like 
Jackson's. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year (when Jackson averaged 4.3 yards per carry) the offense was a lot 
more complicated (under recently fired Mike Shanahan) and it would have been 
too complicated for any halfback to come in at mid-season and pick it up 
perfectly," Long said. "We're basically lining up and running the ball down 
your throat now. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo and Art are the same kind of people. Mild-natured, people who produce, 
people who believe strongly in what they do. It's not someone who is verbose or 
loud about it. They're quiet men who get things done." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid to sit down and rest as a defensive player," nose tackle Bob Golic 
said. "Thank God for that new replay scoreboard. Now, I can just sit back and 
catch whatever I miss if I turn my head." 
</P>
<P>
Haynes, a 14-year veteran, was asked if there is there is anybody he played 
with or against with whom he would compare Jackson. "O.J.," Hayne said. "But he 
didn't weigh 235. You start watching closely over the course of a game and guys 
are hoping somebody else gets to him first." 
</P>
<P>
Long thought about two of the league's best, including injured teammate Marcus 
Allen. "Marcus has the ability to change a game," he said, "but Bo has 
Herschel's speed, plus Bo athletic ability. That's what I think Herschel lacks, 
... that notch-above athleticism." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson could hear all the talk around him, and said: "The way I look at what I 
do is that it's not physical. Everything is mental. If I put my mind to 
anything, I can usually do it." 
</P>
<P>
In another corner of the room, Shell was trying to make sense of this 6-foot-1, 
230-pound marvel, who has averaged 11.7 yards per carry the last two weeks and 
helped the Raiders to a 3-1 record since joining the team. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo is a combination of so many backs," Shell said. "He's got the power of Earl 
Campbell, the speed of Eric Dickerson. He's a fullback in the body of a 
tailback, or is it the tailback in the body of a fullback? Whatever he is, he 
explodes and whatever he is, he's tremendous."

AFTER FIGHT, LAKERS STILL STANDING; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: L.A. HOLDS ON FOR A 111-107 VICTORY AFTER MAGIC JOHNSON AND 
KEVIN JOHNSON ARE BOTH EJECTED FOR ALTERCATION IN THE FIRST QUARTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Tempers flared, harsh words and shoves were exchanged, and to the astonishment 
of spectators and participants alike, unlikely combatants Magic Johnson and 
Kevin Johnson were ejected from Tuesday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
That fight between two of the NBA's best and usually level-headed guards, 
occurring just 3 minutes 22 seconds after tipoff, changed the characters and 
character of the Lakers' home opener against the Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
This much did not change, however: The Lakers continued their home-court 
domination of Phoenix by eking out a 111-107 victory, before 17,505 fans and 
behind James Worthy's 35 points, nine rebounds and one crucial blocked shot 
with two seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns still have yet to prove they can beat the Lakers at the Forum. Sun 
Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons had his personal Forum losing streak stretched to 36 
games over 15 years. And, the Suns have not won in Los Angeles in six seasons, 
though they came close Tuesday night under extraordinary conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the game-altering fight was not revealed by the principals. It 
happened after Byron Scott committed a turnover near the Laker bench. Kevin 
Johnson had been guarding Magic, and it is believed they exchanged some shoves 
as Magic backed into the lane. 
</P>
<P>
Scott said he heard Kevin Johnson call Magic a "big punk." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, those were fighting words. The players met near the free-throw line 
in clear view of referees and players. Magic and Kevin exchanged more words, 
walking straight toward one another. Then, they exchanged shoves and talked 
some more. At that point, Magic landed an open-handed blow to Kevin's right 
jaw. Finally, after shoving each other for a third time, the players were 
pulled apart. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Earvin said (Kevin) called him a big punk," Scott said. "That's like 
calling Mike Tyson a pit bull. You just don't do that." 
</P>
<P>
Both players were ejected, the first time that has happened to Kevin, the third 
time for Magic, though it was his first for fighting. Magic also received a 
"punching foul," which resulted in a technical foul. 
</P>
<P>
Fines are expected to be forthcoming. There even is a remote chance of 
suspensions, since the league is cracking down on fighting. Bill Oakes, the 
lead official, said Johnson's ejection was automatic because he threw a punch. 
Kevin Johnson's ejection, Oakes said, was at the officials' discretion. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson said he never actually "punched" Kevin Johnson. He said his 
open-handed shot that landed on Kevin's right jaw was merely a push that went 
higher than Kevin's chest. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't really a fight," Magic Johnson said. "I think you have to define a 
fight. There was some pushing and stuff. They (the referees) may have made a 
quick decision. I think they could have waited and seen whether it was punches 
or pushes. But it's human nature to make an immediate reaction." 
</P>
<P>
Which is what prompted the players to fight -- uh, push -- in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"I did what I was supposed to do," Magic Johnson said. "I'm going to always be 
a man, like he was, too. As long as we were just pushing, I don't see a big 
problem. That's why we didn't throw any punches -- we aren't the type. But 
we're both competitors who won't be pushed." Unless they push each other. Kevin 
Johnson, 6-foot-2, 188 pounds, clearly was overmatched against Magic Johnson, 
6-9, 220. Kevin was pushed backward twice, but kept coming back at Magic. 
</P>
<P>
"It definitely was a mismatch," Scott said. "There were three pushes, and Kevin 
went from the top of the key to the baseline. So, if Earvin really wanted to . 
. . " 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Johnson declined to talk specifically about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he, as Scott claimed, called Magic a big punk, Kevin smiled thinly and 
said: "All the name-calling happened after the incident itself. It didn't cause 
it. I don't think this can be classified a fight. I'm surprised I got ejected, 
because I pride myself on my conduct. I've never had a problem with anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Until now. 
</P>
<P>
The losses of the two Johnsons immeasurably affected the teams. Fitzsimmons and 
Laker Coach Pat Riley each said that both teams were equally hurt by the 
ejections. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers had to use Larry Drew more than usual, put Michael Cooper at guard 
and base their offense almost exclusively around Worthy. The Suns turned to 
Greg Grant, who is even quicker than Kevin Johnson but only 5-7, and also went 
to Eddie Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lakers, just barely, proved deeper without Magic than the Suns without 
Kevin, though it was close for the final quarter and a half. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy, along with Scott's 20 points and Cooper's 16, persevered. The Lakers 
had a five-point lead with 1:30 to play, but the Suns did not fold. Worthy 
almost did. Uncharacteristically, he missed three of four free throws in the 
final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
So, the Suns trailed, 109-107, with 12.9 seconds to play and set up for a 
game-tying shot. Dan Majerle attempted a baseline jump shot with two seconds 
left, but Worthy partially blocked it. Scott retrieved the ball, was fouled and 
sank both free throws with 1.4 seconds to play to improve the Lakers' record to 
2-1. 
</P>
<P>
While the ejections changed the focus, they did not alter the intensity nor 
competitiveness of the Pacific Division rivals. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers led, 59-48, at halftime before opening a 68-50 bulge 2:07 into the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
From there, the Suns outscored the Lakers, 32-13, to take an 82-81 lead into 
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Johnson led the Suns' rally. He scored 12 of his 15 points in the 
quarter. But despite the scoring of Tom Chambers, who had 30 points, and guard 
Jeff Hornacek, who added 21, the Suns could not overtake the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, Worthy continued scoring inside, Cooper added his fourth 
three-point basket, and Scott and A.C. Green also contributed, Green finishing 
with 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
But all anyone in the Laker locker room talked about was the altercation. 
</P>
<P>
Riley thought it something of a metaphor of the Sun-Laker rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
"Both of those players have tremendous emotional stability, and I'm sure they 
both regret it," Riley said. "But I think that (altercation) showed that we're 
going to come out and protect our turf. And I'm sure Kevin wanted to show that 
he wasn't going to back down." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of an unusual night, Magic Johnson was smiling and joking. His team 
won, even though he did not particularly enjoy the night off. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking to Earvin Tyson now," Scott announced. 
</P>
<P>
"No, it's more like Earvin Holyfield," Cooper corrected. "He's not ready for 
heavyweights yet." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson's last ejection came Dec. 26, 1988, at Phoenix. . . . Laker 
forward Orlando Woolridge, recovering after arthroscopic surgery to remove bone 
fragments in his right knee, was examined by Laker physician Stephen Lombardo. 
Woolridge is progressing as expected, trainer Gary Vitti said, but Lombardo has 
yet to give Woolridge clearance to start running. Woolridge is riding on a 
stationary bicycle and receiving electronic stimulation therapy at Centinela 
Hospital Medical Center. "Last week, he still had a little fluid in his knee, 
and inflammation and pain is an indicator that he is not all healed," Vitti 
said. "But (Woolridge) is right where he should be." 
</P>
<P>
The international media is finding its way to the Forum. Two Spanish 
journalists interviewed Yugoslav-born Vlade Divac, and a correspondent from the 
British Broadcasting Company interviewed Laker rookie Steve Bucknall, who was 
born and reared in London before moving to North Carolina for high school.

The handwriting examiner who concluded that Pete Rose's writing is on three 
betting sheets, disagrees with Rose's contention that there is no way to 
determine whether the handwriting is a forgery. 
</P>
<P>
The three sheets include an indication that bets were made on Cincinnati Reds' 
games, and were cited by baseball investigator John M. Dowd as a key piece of 
evidence that Rose had bet on the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
In Rose's authorized biography, author Roger Kahn contends there is no way to 
tell whether the printing on the three sheets is Rose's because the FBI smudged 
the sheets while testing for fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Casey, a retired FBI handwriting expert who was hired by Dowd to study 
the sheets, disagreed. Casey studied photocopies of the sheets with a 
microscope and concluded it was Rose's writing. He said examiners often base 
conclusions on photocopies.

MONEY HELPS BRING CARSON TO RED WINGS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A key element in last week's Jimmy Carson trade, a deal that seems to favor 
Detroit, may be that "undisclosed amount of cash" that the Red Wings sent to 
the Edmonton Oilers in the six-player deal. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, the key element in the Wayne Gretzky trade that sent Carson to 
Edmonton was the $15 million that Bruce McNall sent along with Carson and other 
considerations. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, owner Peter Pocklington "sold" Gretzky for $15 million and he has 
now sold the primary player who was supposed to be the compensation. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, there are lots of players involved. Last Thursday, it was Carson and 
Kevin McClelland to Detroit for Petr Klima, Joe Murphy, Adam Graves and Jeff 
Sharples as well as cash. 
</P>
<P>
But, think about it. The bottom line, now, is that Edmonton gave up Wayne 
Gretzky for Klima, Joe Murphy, Adam Graves and Jeff Sharples. 
</P>
<P>
And lots of money. 
</P>
<P>
When Carson quit, an Edmonton columnist wrote: "Yankee Go Home." That's exactly 
what Carson did. Happily. 
</P>
<P>
Carson grew up in Grosse Point Woods, a suburb of Detroit. Because his father 
owned parking lots around the Olympia, where the Red Wings played at the time, 
Carson watched his beloved Red Wings practice. And he used to sit on Carol 
Dionne's lap during games, back when the future King, Marcel Dionne, was with 
the Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
Carson took a chance when he took that all-or-nothing stand and walked out, 
forcing the trade, and he came up the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Add Carson: The irony of last week's trade is that Joe Murphy was sent in 
exchange for Carson. Murphy had been the Red Wings' No. 1 pick in the 1986 
draft, ahead of Carson, who was crushed. Carson said recently: "I wanted to be 
drafted here No. 1 overall, but this game is a business. There were many other 
hockey clubs that had Joe Murphy rated No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Carson had 49 goals and 51 assists for 100 points in 80 games. 
Murphy had one goal and seven assists for eight points in 26 games. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Peplinski decided to retire from the Calgary Flames a week ago. It might 
seem like a very strange time to retire, but Calgary Coach Terry Crisp said 
Tuesday that it made sense to him. 
</P>
<P>
"Peppy and I talked about it at the end of the playoffs last season. We talked 
about the fact that we would have a lot of new faces, new talent, and that he 
might end up sitting out a lot. But neither of us knew, for sure, how it would 
go once this season got started. 
</P>
<P>
"Once he started getting less ice time and getting scratched, though, he just 
decided it was time. He has a lot of pride. He's accomplished a lot in his 
career, and a guy like that just wants to retire when it's time to retire . . . 
Pride means more to him than money." 
</P>
<P>
Peplinski, 29, was drafted by the Flames when they were still in Atlanta in 
1979. By retiring, he gave up most of the three years remaining on a four-year 
contract worth $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Schoenfeld, who two years ago took the New Jersey Devils to the Stanley Cup 
semifinals, was stunned Monday when he was fired and replaced by his assistant, 
John Cunniff. 
</P>
<P>
The Devils (who finished 27-41-12 last season and did not make the playoffs) 
were 6-6-2 when General Manager Lou Lamoriello made the change. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenfeld told The Star-Ledger of Newark that he couldn't believe he was 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have to look for a reason, the only thing I can figure is somehow Lou and 
Mr. McMullen (owner John McMullen) expected this team to be like 12-0-2 and 
this is way off base. . . . I really don't think second place in the division 
is bad." 
</P>
<P>
Helmut Balderis, a gray-haired Soviet, who at 37 is the oldest rookie in the 
National Hockey League, responded to some ribbing by some of his Minnesota 
teammates after a practice in Toronto by countering: "NHL. What a league! . . . 
Good money. Yaaaaaaaa. What did they have in Rome? Gladiators? I was a 
gladiator before. Now I work for Helmut Balderis." 
</P>
<P>
More Balderis: Regarding allegations of drug abuse by members of the Soviet 
national team in a book written by Igor Larionov (now with Vancouver), Balderis 
confirmed drugs were available. According to an Associated Press story out of 
Toronto, Balderis held out out his left arm, and with his right hand, pretended 
to inject a needle into his arm. Balderis then pointed to his left thigh and 
his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"Ya, I saw it (when) I was with the national team," Balderis said. "Guys I like 
were doing it. Big-pressure world championships, Olympics. Soviets like to win, 
players get money." 
</P>
<P>
Still more Balderis: When he coached in Japan, the Soviet federation would take 
$9,900 of his salary and leave him $1,500. "Now they get no money because money 
is for me," he said. He's still waiting for his wife and daughters to join him. 
It is his theory that the process would have been completed by now if he had 
agreed to give Soviet hockey officials a cut of his NHL salary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
When Alan Eagleson, executive director of the NHL players association, met with 
Pittsburgh players last week he reportedly told them that he doesn't expect the 
league to expand until about 1993, a couple of years later than most had been 
predicting. . . . To the debate over who is the best player in the NHL, Boston 
Coach Mike Milbury adds the name of veteran defenseman Ray Borque. "That man is 
the best player in hockey right now," Milbury said. "Better than Gretzky. 
Better than (Mario) Lemieux. Better than anyone. . . . He takes the game to a 
higher plane, to a higher level. He's really one of the most underrated 
superstars in the sport." 
</P>
<P>
After losing, 4-3, at the Montreal Forum to the Buffalo Sabres Thursday, 
Montreal Coach Pat Burns said: "Some of our guys were more interested in 
scoring than in getting the two points for a win. If it wasn't for (goalie 
Patrick) Roy, we would have been blown out." . . . The Minnesota North Stars 
are wearing the initials J.W. on their helmets for 11-year-old Jacob 
Wetterling, who was abducted at gunpoint Oct. 22 near his St. Joseph home. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis right wing Brett Hull, on his father, Bobby: "My shot is all genetic, 
but I'd give up half the power of my shot to skate the way he did. What I 
remember about my father's skating is just the graceful way he did it -- in one 
fluid motion with no choppiness. He skated like Paul Coffey, and he did 
everything else besides that." . . . The Rangers lead the league in winning 
percentage, at .719. They are winning with a new coach (Roger Neilson) and a 
new general manager (Neil Smith).

MCCARRON, BAYAKOA SHORTCHANGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those who viewed the Breeders' Cup on television last Saturday could have been 
left with two very misleading impressions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- First, that Sunday Silence was all out in defeating Easy Goer by a neck in 
the Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And secondly, that Bayakoa's victory in the Distaff was tainted because she 
was allowed to jog along on a slow early pace. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with a tape of the telecast should take another close look at Chris 
McCarron's ride on Sunday Silence. It was a conservative, highly-calculated 
piece of precision work. At every key point in the race -- the start, first 
turn, far turn and deep stretch -- McCarron used just enough of Sunday Silence 
to get the desired result. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, McCarron actually had stopped riding hard in the final few strides, 
while Pat Day was in a frenzied, whipping drive on Easy Goer. McCarron had 
Day's colt measured more than 30 yards before the finish, and yet, in the heat 
of the moment, announcer Tom Durkin bellowed, "Sunday Silence holds on, and he 
wins by a desperate neck." The desperation belonged to Easy Goer. 
</P>
<P>
The pressure on McCarron can not be minimized. Riding a headline horse for the 
first time in a $3-million race with Horse of the Year on the line is 
tantamount to coming off the bench to start at quarterback in the Super Bowl 
after missing half the season. 
</P>
<P>
McCarron's only job was to win the race, and he did it. Had he known Sunday 
Silence better, he would have ridden with more abandon. Then margin undoubtedly 
would have been greater than that "desperate" neck. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Bayakoa's Distaff win, Durkin and his NBC colleagues were 
victims of misinformation and a malfunctioning teletimer. As a result, Bayakoa 
may not have received the immediate credit she deserved. 
</P>
<P>
All week, the early pace was considered the key to the 1 1/8-mile race. If 
Bayakoa were pressured up front, she would wilt, or so went the logic. If 
allowed to stroll early, she would have plenty left to roll home once again. 
</P>
<P>
Durkin was right to emphasize the first quarter fraction and half-mile split 
during the running of the Distaff. Anything faster than 46 seconds for the 
half, and Bayakoa would have been cooked. Anything slower than 47 seconds, she 
was home free. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, both Durkin and the on-screen graphics were cued by the infield 
clock, which erroneously reported fractions of :24 2/5 and :48 4/5. Durkin 
correctly emphasized the slow pace in his call. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until the Daily Racing Form chart was passed out in the press box 
that the real fractions were discovered: a quarter in :23 2/5, the half in a 
realistic :46 2/5, fully 11 lengths faster than the pace reported. Had the 
commentators known the real circumstances, they could have lent the proper 
drama and interpretation to Bayakoa's remarkable effort. 
</P>
<P>
The Bayakoa connections are back in action today at Santa Anita in the $81,975 
Linda Vista Handicap for 3-year-old fillies. Trainer Ron McAnally will saddle 
Paper Princess, who is owned by Frank and Jan Whitham in partnership with Vern 
Winchell Jr. and Dion Recachina. 
</P>
<P>
Paper Princess has won two in a row and hasn't been out of the money since May. 
But she could be taking a back seat in the 1 1/16-mile event to her own 
stablemate, Affirmed Classic, who comes into the race off an impressive win in 
the Torrey Pines Stakes at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Challenging the McAnally fillies are Darby's Daughter, Tapping Tudor, Beware of 
the Cat, Flower Ridge, Seaside and Approved to Fly. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Mayberry's accomplishment of four stakes wins at Gulfstream Park last 
weekend on the Breeders' Cup undercard was by no means the biggest splash he'd 
ever made at the Hallandale track. 
</P>
<P>
Seven years ago, Mayberry charged out of the grandstand to rescue a filly he 
trained named A Positive Maybe after she had bolted through the inner hedge 
lining the turf course and dove into the vast infield lake. 
</P>
<P>
"My first thought was keeping her from drowning," recalled Mayberry, whose 
grandfather trained 1903 Kentucky Derby winner Judge Himes. "But it was deep 
where she went in, and the edge of the water was lined with razor sharp oyster 
beds. 
</P>
<P>
"She cut herself to ribbons, but somehow we got her out," Mayberry added. "The 
track vet, an old friend of mine, took one look at me after it was over and 
told me to get to first aid. He said he was more concerned about an overweight 
trainer having a heart attack than he was about the filly." 
</P>
<P>
The story has a happy ending. A Positive Maybe needed 300 stitches to close her 
wounds, but she was back to the races for Mayberry and owner Jan Siegel later 
that same year and ended up winning more than $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
A dramatic photo of her mad bolt through the hedge hangs in a grandstand 
display case of memorable Gulfstream Park moments. Too bad nobody got a shot of 
Mayberry after his swim. 
</P>
<P>
If morning clockers and backstretch sharpies are right, fans at Santa Anita 
will be in for a treat this weekend when a 2-year-old colt named Stylish King 
makes his racing debut for Jack Kent Cooke and trainer Jay Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
The son of Epsom Derby winner Roberto has been dazzling in his recent morning 
moves. In a five-furlong workout under jockey Eddie Delahoussaye on Tuesday, 
Stylish King got some unscheduled company from the stakes-winning filly 
Dramatic Joy. They barreled around the turn and through the stretch, with the 
massive colt dwarfing the game filly. The final clocking was a jaw-dropping :57 
2/5. 
</P>
<P>
Stylish King is out of the Exclusive Native mare Stylish Queen, who was trained 
in California by McAnally. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a very talented filly who never really had a chance to get the credit 
she deserved," McAnally said of Stylish Queen. "As I recall, she had to be 
retired because of a bleeding problem." 
</P>
<P>
Good to see that John Gosden has not lost his touch. The repatriated 
Englishman, a California favorite for more than 10 years, brought the 
2-year-old colt Something Different to Gulfstream Park for last Sunday's 
$141,600 Manila Stakes and went home with a 3 1/2-length victory. 
</P>
<P>
Chris McCarron rode the colt for Gosden, who indicated earlier that Something 
Different might remain in America to race as a 3-year-old next year. Something 
Different gave Gosden his first graded stakes win in Europe last summer, in a 
German race sponsored by a champagne maker.

BREEDERS' CUP TELECASTS: SIX MISSES, ONE HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STAN ISAACS, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The NBC telecast of the Breeders' Cup jamboree of championship horse races last 
Saturday recalls this classic line about the erection of faulty Candlestick 
Park: "Don't blame the architect. It was his first ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
NBC has been telecasting the Breeders' Cup since its inception six years ago, 
but this year it was as if it were doing it for the first time because new 
production head Terry O'Neill rearranged his production lineup so that John 
Gonzalez shifted from producer to director and Terry Ewert took over as the new 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
The result was two telecasts. One was a jumble of unfocused rambling through 
the first six races. It was almost as if these races, all worth at least a 
million dollars and featuring championship horses, hardly mattered, so eager 
were the TV people to keep reminding people about the finale between Easy Goer 
and Sunday Silence. 
</P>
<P>
The second telecast was outstanding. NBC captured the drama of the Classic race 
-- before, during and after -- with good pictures and solid reportage. 
</P>
<P>
There was little uniformity to the telecast during the early races. In some 
races, we saw morning-line odds, in some we didn't. Too often they gave us the 
Evelyn Woods School of Speed Reading, with the odds on and off screen in a 
jiffy. Lacking Harvey Pack, there was a sense of betting smarts missing. 
</P>
<P>
There were too many voices, no real focus. Frequent hesitations by host Dick 
Enberg seemed to reflect confusion in the production truck, and we occasionally 
heard instructions from the truck on the air. Synchronization between 
commentary and taped action was spotty. Reporter Trevor Denman was all too 
effusive most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Exultant winning jockey Angel Cordero lit up the screen dismounting after the 
first race, but we never heard from him. Reporters Jenny Ornsteen and Sharon 
Smith frequently interviewed people of no particular news value -- losing 
jockeys and trainers -- only because they were available. 
</P>
<P>
There were few sustained replays of any of the races before the Classic. Tom 
Hammond did an excellent analysis of the Classic in a replay, but they showed 
only snatches of reruns in the other races. With 4 1/2 hours of air time, the 
reruns rated more air time. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, jockey Gregg McCarron, not the most articulate or commanding presence, 
wound up with the most significant role in pre-race analysis. Hammond's 
questioning astutely set up McCarron, who was astride a pony in the post 
parades, yet Hammond might well have provided keener answers than McCarron 
under a different scenario. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer and Sunday Silence, of course, were the star attractions who merited 
the most attention, but NBC went to ridiculous lengths in its star fawning. In 
the midst of early races, they would break in for shots of the marquee aces. 
They inserted taped shots of the respective jockeys, Pat Day and Chris 
McCarron, leaving their hotels in the morning -- heart-stopping pictures, 
those. They even shifted to a look at Sunday Silence while the horses were 
preparing to go into the gate in the Turf race. 
</P>
<P>
They were so obsessed with the Classic, I'm surprised they didn't run a ribbon 
across the screen with proclamations such as "an hour and 27 minutes until Easy 
Goer vs. Sunday Silence," etc. 
</P>
<P>
On the plus side were some good features: close-up shots of Zilzal's sweating 
flanks, good synchronization of Gonzalez' race pictures with Tom Durkin's 
exciting calls and sharp NBC freeze-frame pictures of close finishes. Nix on an 
inane feature on Shug McGaughey's exercising. 
</P>
<P>
When they zeroed in on the Classic, they were all over the event, building up 
tension with tight close-ups of the principals, equine and human; good 
scene-setting with odds talk by Enberg and Hammond, and good on-the-spot 
reportage. After trainer Jack Van Berg's worried remarks about the rained-on 
track being a possible hindrance to Easy Goer, Denman chipped in with 
significant assurance from McGaughey that it shouldn't bother his horse.

The Classic race was thrilling, Durkin's call memorable, the post-race 
conversations with jocks McCarron and Day on the money. NBC faulted again at 
the finish, though, by going off the air in puzzling fashion: running tapes and 
pulsating calls by Durkin -- not of this stirring Classic, but of Breeders' Cup 
races of previous years.

MAYBE IT'S TIME EASY GOER GETS A DIFFERENT RIDER 
</P>

<P>
It is clear by now that Sunday Silence may not be much better than Easy Goer at 
1 1/4 miles, but he is better. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer may still be the better horse at longer distances, but that is 
academic, because 1 1/2-mile races aren't written by racing secretaries that 
much anymore, and even if they were, Sunday Silence's trainer, Charlie 
Whittingham, is too smart to run his colt in them. 
</P>
<P>
There are still those die-hards around, however, who maintain that Easy Goer 
would also be better than Sunday Silence at 1 1/4 miles, if he had someone 
other than jockey Pat Day on his back. 
</P>
<P>
It is the right time for Shug McGaughey, Easy Goer's trainer, to find out. 
McGaughey owes it to himself, the horse and owner Ogden Phipps, to see whether 
Easy Goer will run more consistently and make fewer mistakes with a more active 
jockey. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer and Day have won 12 races together, but after they lost by a long 
neck to Sunday Silence last Saturday in the Breeders' Cup Classic at Gulfstream 
Park, the score for the year was Sunday Silence 3, Easy Goer 1. 
</P>
<P>
Chris McCarron, riding Sunday Silence for the first time because of Pat 
Valenzuela's suspension for drug use, wasn't as worried as Arthur Hancock about 
Sunday Silence protecting his lead in the final strides of the Classic. In his 
box seat, Hancock, the principal owner of Sunday Silence, was on his knees by 
the time the 1 1/4-mile race was over. 
</P>
<P>
McCarron reached the wire with Sunday Silence much the way he finished on 
Alysheba in the Classic the year before at Churchill Downs. Alysheba held off 
another Day-ridden McGaughey colt, Seeking the Gold, by about the same margin 
as last Saturday's, but McCarron never had the feeling that he was going to 
lose that one, either. 
</P>
<P>
If Easy Goer is indeed a horse for the ages, he should have been able to 
overcome Day's tentative handling, because he had dead aim on Sunday Silence 
through Gulfstream's 952-foot stretch. Day hit Easy Goer 15 times through the 
lane, while McCarron, true to Whittingham's prerace instructions, didn't strike 
Sunday Silence once. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great temptation to hit him a few times," McCarron said. "But you 
only want to hit a horse when you feel he's not doing his best. I never felt I 
needed to hit Sunday Silence. When he started to drift in a bit, I just waved 
the stick at him on the left side and he straightened out." 
</P>
<P>
Whereas McCarron's ride was similar to last year's Classic, Day's ride was a 
lot like the one he gave Forty Niner against Winning Colors when the filly won 
the 1988 Kentucky Derby. Perhaps puzzled with what to do with Winning Colors' 
ability to get off to an uncontested early lead, Day stopped and started with 
Forty Niner, and their surge in the stretch left them a neck short at the wire. 
</P>
<P>
For an objective opinion on whether Day needs to be replaced on Easy Goer, Thad 
Ackel qualifies as much as anybody. Ackel trained Great Communicator, who won 
the Breeders' Cup Turf in 1988, and attended this year's races only as a 
spectator. His roots -- and his accent -- are Louisiana, and although he's 
considered a California trainer now, he has no allegiances to the camps of 
either McGaughey or Whittingham. 
</P>
<P>
"I know Pat Day's record but the plain truth is that he doesn't fit this 
horse," Ackel says. "You've got a patient horse and a patient jockey, and 
that's not a very good combination when you're trying to beat a horse as quick 
as Sunday Silence." 
</P>
<P>
Ackel saw Easy Goer up close at Gulfstream for the first time, going to the 
paddock before the Classic, and although McGaughey shrugs off references to the 
colt's puffy ankles, Ackel believes that they should be the source of concern. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a couple of osselets (enlargements of the fetlock joints usually 
caused by excess fluid)," Ackel said. "And it looked to me like there's some 
calcification there. I was surprised that such a good horse could have ankles 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
Whereas Sunday Silence is an easy horse to ride -- Whittingham said that at 
least a dozen jockeys could have handled the assignment if he hadn't given it 
to McCarron -- Easy Goer has given Day problems. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, when he was beaten by Is It True in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, Easy 
Goer broke poorly and then in the stretch run tried to jump track marks from 
the starting gate. 
</P>
<P>
Easy Goer has had several other bad starts -- in the Kentucky Derby, the 
Preakness and now in Saturday's Classic. On Saturday, he also had trouble 
changing leads -- shifting weight by changing lead feet -- coming out of the 
stretch turn. Sunday Silence, by contrast, changes leads so easily that 
McCarron can't even tell the horse is doing it. 
</P>
<P>
"He reminds me of John Henry a lot the way he changes leads," McCarron said. 
"You can't even feel it. He does it effortlessly." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Easy Goer will be a formidable opponent if he meets Sunday Silence in 
next fall's Classic at Belmont Park. The distance won't be 1 1/2 miles, which 
it was when Easy Goer beat Sunday Silence for the only time in this year's 
Belmont Stakes, but those sweeping turns at the New York track will help 
McGaughey's colt. 
</P>
<P>
They have already helped him. Easy Goer ran second at Belmont in the first race 
of his life, but he has won six straight there since then. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Breeders' Cup officials are lucky that On the Line, who was clobbered at the 
start of Saturday's Sprint, was able to be removed from the track without much 
delay after the race. If On the Line's leg injury had required his being 
destroyed on the track, the delay would have taken the Classic, the day's final 
race, past the twilight zone and into darkness. The same thing happened at 
Churchill Downs last year. The Breeders' Cup is playing it too close to the 
vest with its post time for the final race. 
</P>
<P>
Zilzal, the English colt, has been retired and will stand at stud at the farm 
of his owner, Sheik Mana al Maktoum, in Kentucky. Zilzal, the favorite in the 
Breeders' Cup Mile, was typically washed out in the post parade, delayed the 
start when he wouldn't get in the gate and then broke slowly before finishing 
sixth. His jockey, Walter Swinburn, was critical of the way the outriders 
handled Zilzal. "If they had just left him alone, he would have been all 
right," Swinburn said. 
</P>
<P>
Sunshine Forever, who was last in the Breeders' Cup Turf and didn't win a race 
all year after winning the male grass title in 1988, has been retired. . . . 
Star Lift, the French horse who was third in the Turf, has been turned over to 
Wayne Lukas, who also trains Steinlen, the Mile winner, for owner Daniel 
Wildenstein. . . . Caltech, who despite his name has never run in California, 
is headed for Hollywood Park. The Budweiser International winner led until 
mid-stretch in the Turf before finishing fifth.

ATM CARDS TO LET CARL'S JR. DISH UP FAST FOOD, FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANN GALANTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carl's Jr. customers will soon be able to order a burger, fries and a side 
order of cash. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim-based Carl Karcher Enterprises on Tuesday became the first major 
fast-food chain to approve the use of automated teller cards at all 423 
company-owned Carl's Jr.'s in California. (The chain's 60 franchisees have the 
option of joining, but the 48 stores in Arizona, Nevada and Oregon are not 
included.) 
</P>
<P>
As the electronic system is installed over the next year, customers will be 
able to use plastic money -- namely, bank debit cards from four major 
California banks -- to pay for their food purchases. 
</P>
<P>
And patrons can trot off carrying more than just a bag of burgers. Carl's Jr. 
will allow patrons to receive up to $40 cash back with their purchases. 
</P>
<P>
By accepting automated teller machine, or ATM, cards, Carl's Jr. is joining a 
growing list of retailers -- including gas stations, supermarkets and 
convenience stores -- allowing plastic money. 
</P>
<P>
Just about every major competitor -- including McDonald's, Wendy's, Arby's, 
Jack in the Box and Burger King -- has tested or researched the use of bank 
cards. But most of them have small pilot programs that either issue scrip 
redeemable for food or accept credit cards, which charge interest. 
</P>
<P>
Carl's Jr. is "way ahead of everyone" in developing use of bank cards, said 
Carolyn Levy, a restaurant analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
But in the already bloated fast-food market, "everyone is desperate to increase 
customer counts -- so there's no question that the rest will leap in if it 
works for Carl's," Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
Carl's Jr. decided to adopt the ATM system after a two-year test at more than 
120 Carl's Jr. stores in San Diego and Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
At those stores, customers pay 10 cents per transaction to pay for their 
Chicken Clubs and Famous Stars by sliding a bank card through a card reader. 
</P>
<P>
A debit card allows payment to be electronically transferred from the 
customer's bank account to Carl's Jr. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the ATM systems seem to have given card carriers a bigger appetite. 
Customers who use debit cards spend an average of 50% more at Carl's Jr. than 
they did before, said Bob Altman, a company vice president. Overall sales are 
up at the test sites, too, but Carl's declined to provide numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Carl's Jr. thinks that purchases made with ATM cards will account for up to 7% 
of the chain's transactions within two years -- and eventually more than 10% 
once drive-through customers can use plastic money (which the system currently 
doesn't allow). 
</P>
<P>
That's for an investment of roughly $2,000 a restaurant to install the system 
-- which Altman estimates will be paid back within the first 18 months of 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which will be operated through Wells Fargo Bank's Interlink 
system, accepts ATM cards from Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Security Pacific 
and First Interstate. 
</P>
<P>
But starting next spring, the Wells Fargo system will expand to add the state's 
major savings and loan associations and larger credit unions.

EAGLETON QUITS MERC, SAYS IT FAVORS INSIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Former Sen. Thomas F. Eagleton resigned from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's 
board Tuesday with a vitriolic letter that denounced the Merc's self-regulatory 
program and what he said were official efforts to protect a former Merc 
chairman from punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Eagleton attacked top Merc officials' efforts on behalf of prominent trader 
Brian Monieson, 53, who is accused of failing to stop traders at a firm he 
heads after he was warned that they were cheating customers. When the Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission scheduled a hearing on its plan to ban Monieson from 
trading, several senior Merc and futures industry officials asked to testify as 
character witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Eagleton said that, from this year's futures trading scandal to the recent 
Monieson case, "I have grown increasingly dissatisfied with the way the Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange handles decisions relating to the public interest." Whether 
a decision relates to trading procedures "or penalties for thievery . . . or, 
most recently, the Brian Monieson matter, the Merc decision is usually a 
non-Lincolnian decision of insiders by insiders and for insiders," Eagleton 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation of Eagleton, who was Democratic vice presidential nominee in 
1972, is likely to further fuel the controversy over the handling of the 
Monieson case. The outcry has also come at a time when many outsiders are 
calling for more aggressive regulation of Chicago's booming futures markets. 
</P>
<P>
Eagleton said the Merc's investigations department six times had fined or 
warned Monieson's firm, GNP Commodities, and that Monieson himself was fined 
$10,000 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"In Mercdom, an attack on one insider is an attack on all insiders," Eagleton 
wrote. "All of the Merc power has been brought into action to save Monieson's 
neck." He said Merc founder Leo Melamed, U.S. Agriculture Secretary and former 
Merc President Clayton K. Yeutter and Robert Wilmouth, chairman of the National 
Futures Organization, "a supposedly 'regulatory' organization," had asked to 
speak for Monieson at a CFTC hearing set for Monday. Also, Eagleton said, the 
Merc's principal outside attorney, Jerrold Salzman, had gotten special 
permission to represent Monieson. 
</P>
<P>
"As I see it, the Merc has intruded into the legitimate enforcement affairs of 
the CFTC . . . and against the public interest," Eagleton wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Eagleton, a member of the huge futures exchange's board of governors for three 
years, has increasingly opposed Merc officials over how to police the industry 
and limit the stock market volatility that some believe is worsened by 
stock-index futures trading. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from his office in St. Louis, Eagleton said he had 
made clear his views on the Monieson case at a stormy meeting of the Merc's 
board of governors last Wednesday. He had asked that the Merc officials and 
Salzman not take part in the hearing but had been rebuffed by all others on the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
Eagleton said that he did not have pronounced differences with industry 
officials until this year but that "my temperature began to rise quickly after 
January," when the FBI's undercover investigation of trading floor cheating was 
disclosed. "I began to see more and more that was needed," Eagleton said.

Airlines Improve On-Time Performance: The Transportation Department reported 
that major U.S. airlines in September logged their best on-time performance 
since April. The data for September showed that the 12 largest carriers 
reported 79.6% of their flights operating on time, an improvement over the 
74.6% that operated on time in August. It was the best record since April's 
83.4%. Mishandled baggage complaints filed against carriers averaged 7.25 
reports per 1,000 passengers in September, compared to 8.19 in August, the 
report said.

More Indictments Expected in Futures Probe: Federal prosecutors said they will 
charge more traders from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's Swiss franc futures 
pit as a result of the government's probe of illegal trading. Prosecutors said 
in August that their undercover probe of the Chicago Board of Trade and the 
Chicago Mercantile Exchange would spread beyond the 45 traders and one clerk 
initially charged with racketeering, fraud and violating commodity laws. A 
defense attorney representing some of the defendants in the case said he 
expected four to six more traders from the Swiss franc pit would be charged.

12 PACIFIC RIM NATIONS BACK FREE TRADE; 
</P>
<P>
COMMERCE: A CONFERENCE MARKS THE FIRST STEP IN A PROGRAM TO IMPROVE 
COOPERATION. BUT CHINA, TAIWAN AND HONG KONG AREN'T INCLUDED.

CANBERRA, Australia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leaders of 12 Pacific Rim nations, unanimously proclaiming their support for 
free trade, agreed Tuesday to take a coordinated approach to the current round 
of international trade talks and scheduled two more annual ministerial 
conferences. 
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of a three-day meeting in the Australian capital, foreign and 
economic ministers of the 12 nations agreed to meet again next year in 
Singapore in conjunction with the 25th anniversary of that country's 
independence and in 1991 in South Korea. But they put off a decision on 
establishing a permanent Asia-Pacific structure. 
</P>
<P>
They also deferred a decision on inviting China, Taiwan and Hong Kong -- all 
conspicuously absent from this first government-level attempt to promote 
Asia-Pacific economic cooperation. Lee Hsien Loong, Singapore's minister of 
trade and industry, said invitations to any of the three increasingly 
influential Chinese economies to next summer's meeting were "very much in 
doubt." 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official said later that it would be awkward to include China so soon 
after the suppression of the pro-democracy movement last June, and that Hong 
Kong and Taiwan could not be invited without China. 
</P>
<P>
The results, although extremely modest, were all that U.S. officials had 
expected before the conference began. Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
declared the meeting a success. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know whether I would use the term historic yet, but I think this has 
the potential to qualify for that type of description," Baker said at a news 
conference attended by 21 ministers from the 12 countries. 
</P>
<P>
"We made substantial progress, real results. We have agreed upon a process. It 
is quite clear that we haven't completed all of the decisions that hopefully we 
will ultimately take in order to improve economic cooperation in the Pacific. 
But this is, in my view at least, a very clear and substantial step forward 
toward the improvement of international economic relations, in general, and it 
should be welcomed worldwide." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to a commitment to liberalize trade and fight protectionism that the 
12 enunciated in a communique, Baker said the new grouping "can deal with 
(American) trade imbalances that have existed and continue to exist" with Japan 
as well as with others in the group. 
</P>
<P>
The 12 also pledged to reduce impediments to trade among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Gareth Evans, Australia's foreign minister, said the inaugural session of what 
is being called APEC (for Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) had produced "not 
just rhetorical feathers but lots of meat as well." 
</P>
<P>
The most specific commitment for cooperation called for trade ministers of the 
12 countries to meet in September, 1990, and again in early December to work 
together to remove any last-minute obstacles to a successful conclusion of the 
Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations that must be concluded by the 
end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
These two meetings, along with the annual ministerial meeting next summer of 
the Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Singapore APEC conference, 
guarantee that top officials of the 12 countries will meet at least four times 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, composed of the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore, Thailand and 
Malaysia, holds annual consultations with ministers from the United States, 
Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand following its own regular meeting. 
Starting next year, South Korea will attend the post-ASEAN consultations. 
</P>
<P>
All 12 of those nations were represented at the Canberra meeting, which 
Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke called in an effort to set up what might 
become an Asian equivalent of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
On a lower level, the 12 nations agreed to assign officials to begin work on 
two technical projects and study a host of proposals for more than a dozen 
other cooperative ventures. U.S. officials said this process, intended to 
remove impediments to international business, may be the most important outcome 
of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the conference, the United States and Japan went out of their way to 
avoid offending the ASEAN nations, who had feared that their regional 
cooperation might be swallowed up by a new and bigger grouping. A compromise 
was struck by refraining from setting up any new fixed organization to carry on 
APEC projects and, instead, assigning officials from each country to work with 
the ASEAN secretariat to draw up plans for next summer's ministerial meeting in 
Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official said Washington came to the meeting with five modest 
objectives and achieved them all. He said they were to move the "fragile 
process" forward, to develop a mechanism to plan future meetings, to "lock in" 
agreement to hold at least two more meetings, to develop a program of specific 
projects and to "get some specific focus on the Uruguay Round." 
</P>
<P>
In the communique, the leaders said none of them "believes that Asia Pacific 
Economic Cooperation should be directed to the formation of a trading bloc" 
like the European Communities. 
</P>
<P>
Participants said repeatedly that their organization will be open to the rest 
of the world and will not try to establish any barriers that might give an 
advantage to members in their dealings with other nations. 
</P>
<P>
In these circumstances, however, it is not clear what reason a nation might 
have for joining the new grouping. U.S. officials said different countries will 
have different reasons for participating but that the main incentive will be to 
help formulate proposals to break down impediments to economic growth.

The government's debt ceiling problem caused concern among owners of Treasury 
bills and other government securities, but investors had nothing to fear. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco received 
double the normal number of telephone calls after Congress' failure to pass 
legislation to raise the federal debt limit, said Ted Schroeder, assistant vice 
president in charge of marketable securities, savings bonds and Treasury 
accounts. Congress finally raised the government's borrowing authority late 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
During that period, the Treasury had suspended sales of savings bonds, Treasury 
bills and other securities, leaving some investors worried if they could redeem 
securities they already held. But all securities were redeemed as normal, and 
interest rates and payments were not affected, Schroeder said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the sales suspension did affect Treasury bills that were maturing and 
were due to be automatically reinvested by the government. Federal Reserve 
banks held the funds for these maturing securities and were not paying interest 
for the few days the money sat idle, Schroeder said. But investors could 
request their money and reinvest it themselves somewhere else, he said. NANCY

BRANIFF CANCELS ALL FLIGHTS, LAYS OFF MOST OF WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Braniff Inc. laid off most of its remaining 1,800 employees Tuesday, hours 
after it canceled all flights. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas J. Voltz, Braniff marketing vice president, said the troubled airline 
would attempt to reorganize as a charter carrier with 300 to 500 employees. The 
carrier also continued to explore other options, including selling itself. 
</P>
<P>
Cash-starved Braniff filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors Sept. 
28 and reduced its flight schedule by more than 80% from hubs in Orlando, Fla., 
and Kansas City, Mo. The troubled airline had slashed most fares to $99 to 
attract passengers, but without success. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't clear whether Braniff would succeed as a charter airline. "It's 
something that might be viable," Voltz said. "We are really now assessing how 
viable it is." 
</P>
<P>
Orlando-based Braniff currently operates charter flights for two National 
Football League teams, the Kansas City Chiefs and the New Orleans Saints. Voltz 
said those flights would continue. 
</P>
<P>
Though Braniff's stock is traded over the counter, most of its shares are held 
by an investment partnership headed by Jeffrey Chodorow, a Philadelphia real 
estate investor who also owns a large stake in a doll manufacturer. Chodorow 
purchased the airline from hotel magnate Jay A. Pritzker, who rescued it from 
an earlier bankruptcy in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Braniff filed for its latest bankruptcy after the investment firm of Drexel 
Burnham Lambert was unable to raise $100 million in debt and equity to save the 
cash-squeezed airline. Drexel had come to Braniff's aid in April by raising an 
initial $100 million in high-risk junk bonds, priced to yield a whopping 16.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Investment firms that bought Braniff debt from Drexel are now among the 
airline's biggest unsecured creditors. Court documents show that American 
Capital Fidelity Corp., a Century City investment firm controlled by 
millionaire William Belzberg, bought $7.5 million of the notes, and Century 
Institutional Investors, a firm with close ties to ex-Drexel investment banker 
Michael Milken, bought $2.5 million in debt for one of its customers. 
</P>
<P>
Another Drexel customer, Columbia Savings &amp; Loan in Beverly Hills, loaned 
Braniff $15.8 million shortly before the airline sought bankruptcy protection. 
Persons familiar with that transaction said the secured loan was arranged by 
Drexel. 
</P>
<P>
Braniff has hired the New York investment firm of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. to 
explore its options, including a possible sale. Joel Shapiro, one of Braniff's 
bankruptcy attorneys, said Merrill Lynch has been approached by two investors 
who he would not identify. 
</P>
<P>
Persons familiar with Braniff's problems said the two investors were Kansas 
City businessmen spearheading separate efforts to buy the airline. The possible 
buyers were said to be John Latchow, a prominent retired stockbroker for 
Shearson Lehman Hutton, and Farhad Azima, a former chairman of two airlines 
that have entered bankruptcy proceedings, Global International of Kansas City 
and Capitol Air of Smyrna, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Neither could be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Any sale or reorganization of Braniff must be approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Court in Orlando, where the case is filed. 
</P>
<P>
Airline industry analysts said Braniff has few assets that it can sell to raise 
cash since most of its planes are leased, and airport flight-time slots in 
Kansas City are not in great demand. Braniff's biggest potential asset is 
delivery positions for 21 fuel-efficient Airbus Industrie A-320 aircraft, but 
Braniff's ownership of the positions is in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The seller of the aircraft, GPA Group, contends that it no longer is obligated 
to sell the planes to Braniff and is looking for a new buyer for the A-320s. A 
bankruptcy court hearing on the dispute is set for Friday, and the outcome is 
important to Braniff. 
</P>
<P>
Though a decision against the airline wouldn't necessarily affect its plans to 
operate a charter business, "it would affect the amount of cash we have and our 
ability to pay debt," Voltz said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Southwest, Continental and Eastern airlines said they would accept 
Braniff ticket-holders on a standby basis. Braniff advised ticket-holders to 
call (800) 282-5586 for refund information.

PEOPLE: LUCIANI TO OPERATE GRIFFIN'S CASINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Golden Nugget Inc. executive Alfred Luciani has been appointed to run 
Merv Griffin's financially troubled Resorts International Casino Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came at the same time disgruntled bondholders were deciding 
whether to file a lawsuit forcing New Jersey's first gaming company into 
involuntary bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin has asked Resorts bondholders to approve a massive restructuring in 
which the company's two classes of bondholders would receive significantly less 
interest and principal in return for cash and stock. However, unsecured 
bondholders are unhappy with the deal and have been rumored poised to file suit 
by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
Resorts President David Hanlon named Luciani executive vice president and chief 
operating officer of the 680-room Resorts International Casino Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"Al represents a strong addition to our management team," Hanlon said in a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
Luciani held a number of executive positions in the Golden Nugget over an 
eight-year period, including president and chief executive of Golden Nugget Las 
Vegas, where he was responsible for the operation of the 2,000-room casino 
hotel, and executive vice president of Golden Nugget Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
Golden Nugget no longer has a casino hotel in Atlantic City. It is now called 
Bally's Grand. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, Luciani headed A.L.M. Moonstone Inc., a New Jersey company 
formed to buy the Claridge Hotel Casino. However, after months of elaborate 
negotiations failed to culminate in a deal, Claridge officials in September 
pulled out of the transaction.

BARGAIN HUNTERS HELP DOW REBOUND 14.96 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Investors looking for bargains perked up Wall Street on Tuesday, sending stocks 
modestly higher after Monday's sharp decline. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index closed up 14.96 points at 2,597.13, after 
briefly rising above the 2,600 level. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Dow 30-share index dropped 47.34 points -- its sharpest fall 
since Oct. 13 -- after fears of higher interest rates and concern about weak 
corporate profits triggered a wave of selling. 
</P>
<P>
But bargain hunting, notably for blue chips and technology issues, and strength 
in bonds pushed stocks higher Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The bond market getting stronger encouraged people," said Ed Laux, equities 
trader at Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. "A lot of the blue chips moved up. Selling 
pressure is not around." 
</P>
<P>
Bonds rallied on an announcement that the Federal Reserve was adding temporary 
reserves to the banking system. Some analysts said the central bank's move 
suggested it was trying to nudge interest rates lower. 
</P>
<P>
Investors interpreted the Fed's action as evidence that the next move could be 
an easing of the discount rate, said Michael Metz, equities analyst with 
Oppenheimer &amp; Co. The discount rate is the interest the central bank 
charges its member banks. 
</P>
<P>
"Investors were in the mood to listen to favorable rumors and seized on this as 
a rationalization to nibble a bit," said Metz, adding that such an interest 
rate move by the Fed was unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the New York Stock Exchange, with 813 
issues up, 662 down and 496 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume came to 163.00 million shares, up from 135.48 million on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said program trading, a computerized form of buying and selling large 
blocks of stocks, has remained a factor in price movements but did not cause 
wide price swings in the last two sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most actively traded issues on the NYSE, Tosco rose 7 1/4 to 25 1/8 
on reports that several companies had expressed an interest in buying the 
company or its refinery in Northern California. Philip Morris climbed 1/8 to 40 
7/8; Chrysler gained 1/8 to 20, and IBM rose 3/4 to 97 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
Chemical Bank, meanwhile, lost 1/8 to 31 1/8; BankAmerica declined 3/8 to 27 
3/8, and Pinacle West lost 7/8 to 8. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed lower for the third straight 
session, with the Nikkei 225-share average falling a hefty 163.54 points to 
close at 35,270.46. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks in London rose in slow trading. Technical factors and less fear of an 
imminent hike in British interest rates helped prices. The Financial Times 
100-share index finished up 8.6 points at 2,178.2. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices surged in the credit markets as a fickle market reversed its 
perception of what the Federal Reserve's credit policy is likely to be in the 
near future and began to anticipate a decline in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond jumped about a point, or $10 for 
every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which falls when prices rise, dropped to 
7.86% from 7.95% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, speculation that the Fed wasn't likely to relax credit in the near 
future tipped bond prices lower. But analysts said that view was reversed 
around midday Tuesday after the central bank unexpectedly injected $2 billion 
of reserves into the market. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw yesterday's bearishness turn into today's bullishness," said John 
Sebastian, an executive vice president at Clayton Brown &amp; Associates in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Many traders now see increased chances for an easing sometime soon in the Fed's 
credit policy, which would encourage lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The market also got over Monday's nervousness about coming Treasury auctions. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury on Tuesday postponed $40 billion in auctions because of 
congressional failure to raise the debt limit. On Monday, the Treasury had 
postponed its weekly bill sale. 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said leaders are hoping to pass a new 
debt ceiling in time for President Bush to sign it today. 
</P>
<P>
That would mean the auctions could start Thursday or Friday, said Mitchell 
Held, chief financial economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted late in the day at 8.50%, down from 8.688% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar weakened Tuesday against all major currencies, reflecting concern 
that U.S. interest rates are heading lower. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices, meanwhile, rose sharply here and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery closed 
at $386.20 an ounce, up $4.70 from Monday. Republic National Bank of New York 
quoted a late bid for gold at $384.75 an ounce, up $4.50 from Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency traders said worries that the Federal Reserve might be easing its 
credit policies, in the face of recent evidence showing an economic slowdown, 
depressed the dollar's value but supported gold prices. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
closed up at 143.63 Japanese yen from 143.45 yen Monday. It traded at 143.45 
yen in London, and at 142.95 yen in New York, down from 143.85 yen. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was also weaker against the British pound. Sterling rose to $1.5810 
from $1.5795 in London late Monday, and to $1.5865 in New York from $1.5765 
late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Sugar futures prices climbed sharply on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa 
Exchange as demand continues to outstrip supplies on the world market. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, copper and precious metals futures surged, pork and livestock 
futures gained, energy futures were mostly higher and grains and soybeans were 
mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Sugar futures settled 0.22 to 0.50 cent higher, with the contract for delivery 
in January at 14.40 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
The market continued to show concern over the availability of Brazilian sugar 
despite the announcement Tuesday by government officials that Brazil will honor 
492,000 metric tons of export contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the surge in prices was the sale of a large block of sugar to Cuba, 
said Erik Dunlaevy, an analyst with Balfour Maclaine Corp. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Reports that miners at Codelco's Chile operations will vote to strike this week 
sent copper prices up sharply on New York's Commodity Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Jim Steel of Refco Inc. in New York noted that the market was ready for 
a price surge because of the steep decline in copper prices in recent weeks.

SONY COMPLETES $3.4-BILLION ACQUISITION OF COLUMBIA

Sony Corp. said Tuesday that it has completed its $3.4-billion buyout of 
Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., the film and television production giant. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese electronics and records company said that its $200-million tender 
offer for Guber-Peters Entertainment Co., a Hollywood production concern, had 
also expired and that about 99.5% of Guber-Peters' shares were either tendered 
or promised by the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Sony reaffirmed that it intended to name the heads of Guber-Peters, Peter Guber 
and Jon Peters, to top posts at Columbia Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Talks were said to be continuing between Sony and leaders of the Warner Bros. 
studio over releasing the two producers, whose credits include "Batman," from 
an exclusive five-year contract to make movies at Warner. 
</P>
<P>
Sony completed its tender offer for Columbia stock last week, and 99.3% of its 
stock was tendered under the $27-a-share offer. 
</P>
<P>
The second part of the merger was completed Monday, converting the remaining 
Columbia shares into the right to receive $27 a share in cash.

SHEARSON WILL CUT HUNDREDS OF JOBS SOON

<P>
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. will lay off several hundred workers over the next 
few weeks due to the recent slowdown in the financial markets, the brokerage 
company said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts would be the largest since the slew of layoffs that followed the 
October, 1987, market crash. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts predicted that a new round of staff cuts will occur on Wall 
Street due to recent sluggish retail brokerage activity and a slowdown in 
leveraged buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
However, other major brokerages said no such cuts are in the works. 
</P>
<P>
Brokerages are likely to report lower trading profit for the fourth quarter as 
small investors remain on the sidelines. Investors have been jittery following 
the Friday the 13th market plunge last month and subsequent market volatility. 
</P>
<P>
A memo circulated to Shearson employees Monday said the cutback will mainly 
affect New York employees and reflects the slowdown in market activity. 
</P>
<P>
Industry sources estimated that about 800 Shearson employees would receive 
layoff notices. Shearson's work force worldwide totals about 38,500. 
</P>
<P>
Most brokerages began tightening their operations after the October, 1987, 
crash, when they let go an estimated 17,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
One analyst noted that this October was a poor month for the securities 
business and estimated that up to 7,000 workers industrywide could be laid off 
by mid-1990. 
</P>
<P>
This year's Oct. 13 market selloff was initiated on news that a financing deal 
for a takeover bid had collapsed. The transaction involved a UAL Corp. 
pilot-management group that hoped to buy out the United Airlines parent. 
</P>
<P>
The junk bond market, a source of funds for many highly leveraged takeovers, 
has also been troubled. Prices of lower grade high-yield, high-risk bonds have 
fallen since the summer, when some companies ran into problems meeting interest 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson cutback also reflects consolidation of its office facilities in 
New York as a number of Shearson employees are about to move to a new office 
building in lower Manhattan. The new facility, known as Shearson Lehman Hutton 
Plaza, is six blocks north of its World Financial Center headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The memo to employees said the cutbacks would be in "selected areas." 
</P>
<P>
The layoffs were not likely to have a material financial impact on the company, 
one source said.

WOMEN ATHLETES RUN BEHIND MEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MARBELLA, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As remarkable as women's athletic gains have been in recent years -- what with 
their records and achievements inching closer to those of their male 
counterparts -- experts believe that there will always be a gap between the 
sexes in this area. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything else being equal, say a woman had inherited the same genetic stuff 
and trained as much, there would still be a 5% to 10% difference in her 
performance," says Rudy Dressendorfer, professor of human performance and sport 
at New Mexico Highlands University. 
</P>
<P>
The difference stems mainly from two factors: muscle mass and cardiovascular 
capacity. And those two factors underlie the speed, strength and endurance so 
many sports require. 
</P>
<P>
Women are generally smaller than men. But even a woman who is the same size as 
a man most likely will have less muscle mass because she has a higher 
percentage of body fat. 
</P>
<P>
"The quality of muscle is the same," says Robert Stauffer, director of 
physiological research at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point (N.Y.). "If 
you look at a muscle fiber under a microscope, you can't say, this belongs to a 
woman, this belongs to a man. The difference has to do with muscle mass." 
</P>
<P>
Less muscle mass means less strength, he says. This is true even among cadets, 
who rank in the top 2% for their age group as far as physical fitness, he says. 
The academy has found that female cadets have 30% to 35% less upper body 
strength than their male counterparts.

FUTURISTIC: ATM cards are about to conquer Carl's Jr. (D5), but what's next? . 
. . Twenty years from now, one bank official says, ATM cards may contain 
microchips to store such information as your medical history and financial and 
insurance status, to ease the paper-work problem at the doctor's office. . . . 
Already, California consumers can use their ATM cards to shop at 2,800 
locations, including groceries, shoe stores and service stations. Steve Emmons

ABANDONED: Forty to 50 children are abandoned each year in Orange County, but 
just one or two are newborns. . . . The infant found this week (B1) probably 
won't find a permanent adoptive home for several months because of the 
legalities involved in trying to find his natural parents or relatives. . . . 
Had a parent relinquished the baby instead of abandoning him, adoption 
proceedings could begin almost immediately. . . . A happy footnote: The baby 
last abandoned in Orange County has been adopted. Steve Emmons and Dana Parsons

TRANSPORTATION: THE PROPOSED SALES-TAX INCREASE LOST BY 14,000 VOTES IN A 
HIGHER-THAN-USUAL TURNOUT FOR AN OFF-YEAR ELECTION.

<P>
In an election that shattered dreams of a streamlined freeway system in this 
century, Orange County voters decisively rejected a transportation sales-tax 
increase Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Measure M, the half-cent sales-tax boost for traffic improvements, lost by 
about 14,000 votes -- or 53% to 47%. It was the second time in five years that 
Orange County voters had rejected a sales tax-transportation measure, although 
this time the outcome was a lot closer. 
</P>
<P>
Its supporters were disconsolate. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be disappointed. Measure M would have allowed Orange County to 
begin to see its way out of the congestion that's there right now," said former 
county supervisor Bruce Nestande, chairman of Citizens for Yes on M. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, voters in Laguna Niguel handily endorsed a move to become the 
county's 29th city. 
</P>
<P>
In Irvine, anti-gay activists successfully repealed a portion of a new city 
ordinance that offered human-rights protections to homosexuals. Irvine's 
Measure N won by 52.6% to 47.4%. 
</P>
<P>
In another local race that tested the strength of proponents of "traditional 
values," however, candidates backed by religious fundamentalists and 
conservatives lost by a near 2-to-1 margin in an effort to win seats on the 
Newport-Mesa Unified School District Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
And voters in Fountain Valley recalled Councilman Fred Voss, who was arrested 
last January for soliciting sex from an undercover officer on Harbor Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Countywide turnout was 22%, Registrar of Voters Don Tanney said, a county 
record for an off-year election that topped the previous high of 13% in 1987. 
There was also a record use of absentee ballots -- more than 34,000 compared to 
10,856 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"For an off-year election, this is an excellent turnout. Normally an election 
like this would be 12% but the presence of Measure M and the emphasis on 
absentee balloting by Measure M folks accounts for the difference," Tanney 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Voter turnout for recent off-year elections has been averaging about 12%. 
</P>
<P>
While Measure M was losing in Orange County, sales-tax increases were being 
approved by voters in five other counties, including San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
"Measure M had more going for it and a wider coalition than probably you can 
get for any measure," said Tom Rogers, a San Juan Capistrano rancher who 
switched sides and backed Measure M after opposing a similar, 1-cent tax hike 
in 1984. "I doubt very much that there will be any possibility of putting a tax 
increase on the ballot in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Yudelson, one of the leaders of the campaign against Measure M, said its 
defeat shows "you cannot take a bad plan and sell it to the voters, even with 
$2 million. . . . We won a classic David-versus-Goliath struggle." 
</P>
<P>
The half-cent sales tax increase was the only countywide issue on Tuesday's 
ballot, with the election battle reflecting sharp divisions among Orange County 
residents about remedying traffic congestion, the county's No. 1 problem, 
according to public opinion surveys. 
</P>
<P>
Measure M would have earmarked $1.325 billion for freeway improvements, 
including $550 million to widen the Santa Ana Freeway from six to 12 lanes 
about 15 years ahead of schedule. The fixed, 20-year plan also would have set 
aside $1 billion for regional and local street projects, plus $775 million for 
commuter rail and other transit programs, including subsidized bus fares for 
the elderly and handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing a replay of June, 1984, when a proposed 1% sales tax increase was 
crushed, 70% to 30%, proponents of Measure M mounted a $2.4-million campaign 
that included slick, flashy mail, thousands of telephone calls, and precinct 
walks emphasizing that there was something for everyone in this year's measure: 
growth controls; a citizen's oversight committee, and a broad mix of projects 
to appeal to partisans of freeways, commuter trains and neighborhood 
thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the campaign dollars came from developers and the construction 
industry, out of concern that ever-worsening traffic congestion would hurt 
business, lead to economic stagnation and prompt a decline in Orange County's 
quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
The opponents, a ragtag assortment of anti-tax and slow-growth activists, were 
able to raise little more than $10,000, mostly from individuals, for a few 
thousand letters and a few hundred telephone calls. Borrowing a page from the 
playbook used successfully by opponents of last year's countywide slow-growth 
initiative, Measure M's critics tried to pit North County against South County 
by telling residents of each area that the other one would benefit most from 
the sales tax increase, which was expected to cost each Orange County resident 
an estimated $50 to $75 a year. 
</P>
<P>
But opponents also disagreed among themselves about what was wrong with Measure 
M. Some argued against any tax hike. Several claimed that Measure M would 
promote new growth. Others argued that Measure M's growth controls interfered 
with developers' rights. Still others argued that some of the proposed traffic 
improvements, such as adding car-pool lanes to freeways, lack merit. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's Measure N, meanwhile, was aimed at repealing a part of the city's 
15-month-old Human Rights Ordinance that banned discrimination based on sexual 
orientation in housing and employment. 
</P>
<P>
In South Orange County, political attention centered on Laguna Niguel, which 
was seeking to become the county's 29th city in balloting Tuesday. The 
community of 40,000 is one of the last large unincorporated areas in South 
County, where communities increasingly are seeking cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel activists had battled for three years to bring the cityhood vote 
to a ballot. During that time, Laguna Niguel lost a 1.5-mile coastal strip, 
Monarch Beach, to Dana Point when that community incorporated last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills, which borders Laguna Niguel to the north, narrowly lost cityhood 
last June. Opposition was centered in Leisure World, where a majority of 
residents opposed incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, no major opponent surfaced in this fall's cityhood campaign for 
Laguna Niguel. A small group called Stop Cityhood did raise questions about 
whether Laguna Niguel could afford to become a city. But Stop Cityhood leaders 
switched sides last week and joined the pro-cityhood movement because a fiscal 
analysis in October had convinced them that Laguna Niguel could operate 
soundly. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three candidates competed for five seats on the proposed city council 
for Laguna Niguel. The winning candidates would take office and the city would 
become official on Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
In the hotly contested race for the Newport-Mesa Unified School Board, two 
challengers campaigned as so-called Christian candidates seeking to emphasize 
abstinence in sex education. The incumbents countered that the challengers were 
extremists who might censor courses and withhold badly needed information about 
contraception and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
And in the Orange Unified School District, voters swept three incumbents out of 
office and elected five newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
The Fountain Valley voters who recalled Voss were reacting to his arrest early 
this year for soliciting sex from an undercover police officer in Santa Ana.

L.A. COUNCIL CREATES A PANEL TO FIND FUNDS FOR QUAKE SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday approved an emergency measure creating 
an earthquake safety committee to identify unsound structures and find a way to 
finance an estimated $200 million to $300 million in repairs. 
</P>
<P>
The likely source of funding will be a general bond issue that would cost the 
average homeowner about $10 a year for each $100 million in bonds, according to 
Councilman Richard Alatorre, who sponsored the measure. Such an issue would 
have to be approved by the voters in a general election. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre called the bond issue "crucial" to the future of the city and said the 
money is needed to correct serious structural problems before "the Big One 
hits." 
</P>
<P>
The council was jolted into action on earthquake safety after a 7.1-magnitude 
earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay Area three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, officials from a number of city departments and state agencies have 
reported to the council that dozens of bridges, traffic overpasses and 
buildings in Los Angeles might not be able to withstand a similar jolt. 
However, the data on the number of such structures as well as their locations 
has been imprecise. 
</P>
<P>
The measure approved Tuesday instructs the city administrative officer to 
gather information within 15 days from all city departments and agencies and 
come up with an estimate of seismic repair costs. 
</P>
<P>
The committee will focus on public buildings, unreinforced multifamily 
residential buildings and bridges and overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
One issue expected to generate controversy in the committee is how to deal with 
the owners of unreinforced brick residential buildings who have failed to make 
repairs required by a 1981 ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who was appointed to the committee, said Tuesday he 
is hesitant to "bail out a slumlord who has disobeyed the law."

CHALLENGE TO JAILHOUSE INFORMERS DEALT A BLOW; 
</P>
<P>
TESTIMONY: JUDGE REJECTS NEW TRIAL FOR MAN CHARGED WITH MURDER ON BASIS OF 
JAILHOUSE INFORMANTS' FALSE CLAIMS. SHE SAYS THERE WAS AMPLE OTHER EVIDENCE TO 
LEAD TO CONVICTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a serious blow to lawyers challenging the use of jailhouse informants, a 
judge Tuesday refused to grant a new trial to a Compton man who was charged 
with murder only after informants claimed that he confessed. 
</P>
<P>
Despite evidence that the informants lied, Superior Court Judge Judith C. 
Chirlin said Kevin Dykes' conviction for second-degree murder was fairly 
obtained. 
</P>
<P>
Chirlin, who presided at Dykes' trial, said there was ample other evidence for 
jurors to convict Dykes, including Dykes' own testimony that he served as a 
lookout for the killers. 
</P>
<P>
Her assessment clashed with that of both the defense attorney and the original 
trial prosecutor, who said they believed that the informant testimony was 
critical. 
</P>
<P>
But a new prosecutor assigned to the case agreed with Chirlin that the 
informant testimony was not important. 
</P>
<P>
The judge's ruling stunned Dykes' defense lawyer, Steven Hauser, who said: "The 
informants took up 40% of the trial . . . I don't see how the court can say 40% 
of the case was perjured, but it didn't matter to the jury because they had the 
other 60%." 
</P>
<P>
The trial prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Elliot Alhadeff, expressed his opinion 
in an October, 1988, memo to his superiors. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire case against Dykes in the murder," he said, ". . . rested on his 
confession to the informants." 
</P>
<P>
The memo was written in response to a request from top officials in the Los 
Angeles County district attorney's office, who were then attempting to identify 
every case involving informant testimony in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
The officials vowed to investigate the cases in the wake of a demonstration by 
veteran informant Leslie Vernon White, who showed his jailers that he could 
convincingly fake the murder confession of an inmate whom he had never met. 
</P>
<P>
Using a jail phone, White posed as a policeman to gather inside information 
about the murder from law enforcement agencies, then arranged a phony record to 
show that he had briefly shared a cell with the inmate whose confession he 
claimed to have heard. 
</P>
<P>
Dykes, who is serving a sentence of 24 years to life for the 1986 stabbing 
death of his friend, Otis Perry, and two attempted murders, was not present at 
the hearing, which was the first in a series of expected bids by defense 
lawyers to reopen cases because of questionable informant testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles defense lawyer Gigi Gordon, who has coordinated defense efforts 
against use of jailhouse informants, predicted that the denial of the petition 
for a writ of habeas corpus would have a chilling effect. 
</P>
<P>
Dykes was arrested for possessing rock cocaine in 1986, days after he told 
Compton police that he had seen a friend stabbed to death and witnessed two 
other stabbings that were not fatal. 
</P>
<P>
Because he could not immediately post $250 for a bail bond, he was jailed. 
Because he had provided information on the murder case, he was placed in a 
section of the Hall of Justice jail for informants. 
</P>
<P>
Two veteran informants, Willie Battle and Jesse Williams, told police that 
Dykes confessed to them in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Only then was Dykes charged. 
</P>
<P>
Battle testified that Dykes told him that he was a drug dealer who helped his 
"henchmen" stab his friend to death. 
</P>
<P>
Williams testified similarly, saying Dykes admitted ordering his "bodyguards" 
to kill his friend, then helped with the stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
After Battle and Williams came forward, Dykes was moved from the informants 
section of the Hall of Justice jail to the Men's Central Jail and placed in a 
section used for prisoners who need protection. 
</P>
<P>
There he met veteran informant White. White told police and later testified 
that Dykes confessed to him too. 
</P>
<P>
The trial turned into a battle of informants as the defense called informants 
of its own, who testified that Battle, Williams and White were liars. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a matter of the jury deciding whom they believed," Chirlin said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the "jury obviously rejected a substantial portion of the testimony of 
the informants." 
</P>
<P>
Dykes' attorney, Hauser, wanted Chirlin to hear testimony Tuesday from White in 
his bid to reopen the case. 
</P>
<P>
White had said in a sworn statement after the trial that Williams and Battle 
had admitted framing Dykes. White had indicated in the statement, but had not 
actually admitted, that he had framed Dykes too. 
</P>
<P>
However, Chirlin decided that she did not want to hear from White. 
</P>
<P>
She noted that White had testified twice recently as an expert witness for the 
defense in other trials and had answered "no" when asked specifically whether 
he had lied at the Dykes trial. If he said now that he had perjured himself, 
how would she know he was telling the truth, she asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody would know . . . if and when Leslie White was telling 
the truth," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
White, who was not present in court, later called The Times to say that he was 
disappointed that he was not allowed to testify and had planned to admit that 
he committed perjury in the Dykes case. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had conned Dykes into providing him with copies of police reports 
recounting the statements of Battle and Williams. 
</P>
<P>
In rejecting White's testimony, Chirlin said a recantation by White would have 
had no "material effect" on the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
She based her assessment, in part, on the form the verdict took. 
</P>
<P>
She noted that jurors specifically found a "special-use allegation" -- a charge 
that Dykes himself used a knife -- to be untrue. 
</P>
<P>
If they had believed the informants, they presumably would have found it to be 
true and thus found Dykes guilty of first-degree murder, the judge said..

REAGAN APOLOGIZES TO HOLLYWOOD FOR REMARK BUT NOT FOR HIS $2-MILLION FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
Ronald Reagan apologized to Hollywood on Tuesday for saying recently that the 
American entertainment industry should look to Japan to bring back "decency and 
good taste" to American films -- but not for accepting a $2-million fee from 
Fujisankei Communications Corp. for making a trip to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
At the best-attended luncheon in the 42-year history of the Hollywood Radio and 
Television Society, the former President told an audience of Hollywood's most 
prominent entertainment executives that "what a person says in one country is 
often misinterpreted in another" and spurred applause by saying: "I apologize 
to anyone who may have taken offense." 
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Japan late last month, Reagan drew criticism from American 
government officials for defending Sony Corp.'s recent purchase of Columbia 
Pictures, saying in a taped interview that he was "not too proud of Hollywood 
these days" because of immorality and vulgarity in its movies, adding that 
Hollywood "needs some outsiders" to correct the problem. 
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks Tuesday at the Beverly Wilshire, a sheepish Reagan joked 
that he was late because he was delayed at the dentist having "the last piece 
of shoe leather that I acquired in Japan" removed from his teeth. He added that 
the day's lunch menu for him consisted of "crow souffle followed by humble 
pie." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan went on to offer lavish praise for Hollywood's new crop of "family" 
films, as well as its efforts to avoid glorifying drug use on the screen. He 
cited the flow of information into Communist countries as "the best and perhaps 
the only hope" for spurring social reform. "You are truly great communicators," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a question-and-answer session, Reagan denied that his praise of Sony's 
Columbia takeover was spurred by his ongoing negotiations with the corporation 
for a $1-million donation for video equipment for his presidential library. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan also denied that his remarks praising Sony and the Japanese film 
industry represented a "paid endorsement" for Japan because of the $2 million 
he accepted from Fujisankei and the money his library may receive from Sony. 
</P>
<P>
"Sony had nothing to do with my invitation to Japan," Reagan said, adding that 
the Japanese government and "another industry" were responsible for the 
invitation. Reagan also denied that the $2 million from Fujisankei influenced 
his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan chose to make light of the Fujisankei situation. "It is true, that 
(figure) was offered, and I didn't protest," he said, adding jokingly: "And I 
knew there was an actor in Hollywood who got $3 million for doing a Toyota 
commercial. 
</P>
<P>
"Theirs (Japan's) is a society I don't think we can understand. It costs $1 
million to join a country club, $200 for a cab ride to the airport. They have a 
different set of (monetary standards) there than we have here. But I was happy 
at the same time that I was able to carry on what I had been doing in office, 
which was to bring about the elimination of the last few restrictions on free 
trade between our two countries." 
</P>
<P>
Added Reagan, grinning: "I just thought that, for 16 years, I hadn't made any 
kind of money. . . ."

PRO-M CAMP PREDICTS BLEAK FUTURE FOR DRIVERS

The sponsors of Measure M, who invested two years crafting their proposal and 
spent more than $2 million to sell it, said sadly Tuesday that their dream of a 
streamlined Orange County freeway system in this century is dead. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be a substantial setback for transportation in Orange County," 
said a glum Tom Rogers, a leader of the pro-M campaign, as no votes slowly 
overtook an early surge of yes votes. "There seems to be in this county a solid 
number of voters who resist taxes." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Nestande, chairman of the campaign for Measure M, said: "Other counties 
are going to be successful in dealing with their transportation crisis because 
they have the funds to do so, but we won't have that option. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no money sitting out there," he said. "There's no dollar at the end of 
the rainbow." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Ward, who was host of a gathering Tuesday night for the measure's 
opponents, said government officials are to blame for traffic problems, not the 
failure of a sales tax. About predictions of highway gridlock, he said: "If 
they keep control of the transportation in Orange County, that's probably 
true." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Yudelson, another opponent, said those who worked against Measure M "are 
going to be getting together in the next couple weeks to form a watchdog group. 
People who don't like a sales tax approach have got to offer an alternative for 
what you can do with less money." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, a supporter of the measure, said: "We're in deep 
trouble. There are no finances to build the improvements we're going to need in 
the next decade. It puts us in a catastrophic position." 
</P>
<P>
County transportation experts also predicted gloom and gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange and Riverside freeways will remain major problem areas, they 
predicted in interviews Tuesday. And plans to create so-called "super streets" 
such as Katella Avenue, which would zip commuters through cities and serve as 
alternatives to freeways, will -- at best -- be stalled for years, if not 
permanently, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in serious trouble" if Measure M fails, said Keith McKean, director of 
the Caltrans district office in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no funds available for new construction projects," he said in an 
interview before Tuesday's result were in. "By early next year, perhaps in 
January, February or March, we will have committed all of the cash available 
for new construction. We will have to decide how much maintenance to defer, we 
will cut back on consultant contracts, cut back on preventive maintenance, and 
then we'll have to decide how many people to lay off." 
</P>
<P>
Nestande also predicted an abrupt halt in the county's progress toward better 
traffic if the measure is not successful. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that anything where a contract has been awarded is safe," said 
Nestande, who serves on the California Transportation Commission, the state 
board that oversees state transportation spending. "Anything else is up for 
grabs." 
</P>
<P>
Nestande and other transportation officials are hopeful that the proposed 
9-cent-a-gallon increase in the state gasoline tax on the June, 1990, ballot 
will pass. But Orange County's share of that additional revenue, if approved by 
voters, would be far below what Measure M would generate. 
</P>
<P>
"If the state ballot proposition doesn't pass, I don't know what we're going to 
do," Nestande said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said, however, that some highway construction will continue. 
</P>
<P>
That includes the widening of the Santa Ana Freeway and the extension of the 
Costa Mesa Freeway; $240 million in developer-funded roads through southern 
Orange County and three planned tollways.

4 HORSES THAT HAD BAFFLING ILLNESS ARE PUT TO DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
State health officials Tuesday were racing to identify a baffling illness that 
has killed at least 18 horses, stricken several others and shaken owners and 
trainers throughout Southern California since it surfaced 10 days ago in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the horses apparently suffering from the mysterious ailment were 
destroyed Tuesday -- two in Ventura County, one in Los Angeles County and one 
in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
As veterinarians speculated that the illness might be caused by a type of food 
poisoning, some Orange County owners who lost horses criticized managers of the 
Orange County Fairgrounds Equestrian Center for not changing the feed sooner. 
</P>
<P>
Seven horses boarded at the equestrian center have died, and two others are 
showing symptoms of the illness. But officials said Tuesday that they have 
committed all resources available and that they were encouraged that no new 
cases have been reported since Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
State officials and a team of veterinarians held a news conference at the 
equestrian center Tuesday, but they could offer few answers and little solace 
to the angry owners and trainers whose horses succumbed to the malady. 
</P>
<P>
"He was like a part of my family," said Mary Carpenter of her Arabian champion 
show horse Mazerati, which died Sunday. Carpenter, who lives in Huntington 
Beach, attended the news conference and broke down sobbing several times as she 
related his last hours. She said the horse was valued "in the six figures." 
</P>
<P>
"My 10-year-old son was there when he died, and friends and family held prayer 
vigils around his stall," Carpenter said. "He did not die alone." 
</P>
<P>
Veterinarians said they have not determined a cause for the illness but that 
they have focused attention on the food supply, which apparently is the only 
common link among the stricken equines. 
</P>
<P>
At least three horses have also died at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center in 
Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Several veterinarians who have treated the sick horses say the symptoms of 
twitching muscles, rapid breathing and difficulty chewing and swallowing are 
consistent with botulism, a form of food poisoning caused by a bacteria-borne 
toxin. 
</P>
<P>
"Our analysis of the hay is still in the works, and we plan to collect more 
samples from different sources," said Dennis Thompson, a veterinarian in the 
animal health branch of the state Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said investigators are analyzing cubes of compressed alfalfa processed 
by Paramount Cubing of Artesia, a feed company that supplies the Costa Mesa 
center and stables throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said that remnants of fur and hide, apparently from a rabbit, had been 
found in one feed sample, which "leads to consideration of botulism as a 
cause." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said, however, that Paramount Cubing has not been ordered to stop 
distributing its feed. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no conclusive evidence that the (feed) is the cause," he said. "We 
would, however, advise people to be cautious with the cubes of hay. Right now 
we just don't have enough information." 
</P>
<P>
Norbert Bartosik, general manager of the Orange County center, said Paramount 
Cubing officials had been invited to the press conference but declined to 
attend on the advice of their attorney. 
</P>
<P>
However, company owner Ken Rhomberg said earlier Tuesday that his firm has used 
the same procedure to make and distribute cubes for 15 years and that he doubts 
that they are to blame. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Ardans, director of the California Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory 
system, based at UC Davis, said necropsies of five horses showed virtually 
nothing on which to base a diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Equestrian Center established a voluntary quarantine of its 
stables Friday to prevent horses' being taken out or brought in. Bartosik said 
Tuesday that the Huntington Beach Equestrian Center and the Sycamore Trails and 
Rancho Sierra Vista stables, both in San Juan Capistrano, have also agreed to 
quarantine their horses. 
</P>
<P>
Owners and trainers at the Orange County equestrian center have mounted 
round-the-clock vigils to look after their animals, and some blamed officials 
for not acting sooner to remove the feed. 
</P>
<P>
"There are things they should have done that they didn't do," Carpenter said. 
"They should have stopped feeding the horses the cubes immediately, and they 
didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Pamela Gimple, manager of the equestrian center, said officials replaced the 
feed Nov. 3, when they began to suspect a link among three deaths previously 
believed to be unrelated. The first death at the center was reported on Oct. 
28; the other two occurred Nov. 1 and 3. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gimple acknowledged that the cubed feed from Paramount was not 
discontinued until Monday, when the center began using non-cubed alfalfa hay. 
</P>
<P>
Andrea Kary, who has kept her horse, Star, at the Costa Mesa center for four 
years, said several owners took it upon themselves to place "No Feeding" signs 
in front of stalls and to handle the feed chores themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a heartbreaking thing and has been very scary for all of us," Kary said. 
"It's like a nightmare, something that you read about happening on the other 
side of the country but not here." 
</P>
<P>
She said Star had been given the alfalfa cubes but had left many of them 
uneaten and is apparently doing fine. 
</P>
<P>
Maureen McLane of Huntington Beach boards her 12-year-old quarter horse at the 
Costa Mesa center. McLane said she has suspected "the hay cubes from the 
beginning." She said the cubes she saw at the center last week were 
"discolored." They were a "gray moldy color, rather than fresh green," she 
said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; 
</P>
<P>
COUNCIL REJECTS PLAN TO ADD 2 MEMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A suggestion to add two members to the City Council and hold council elections 
by district was rejected by the council Monday on a 3-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John Kelly, who made the proposal, said it would allow better 
representation of the entire community. 
</P>
<P>
"Three of the five present council members live south of Walnut Street," Kelly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Earl J. Prescott supported Kelly's idea but the majority disagreed, 
saying Tustin is too small to warrant elections by district. 
</P>
<P>
"This would make people not accountable to the city as a whole," Councilman 
Ronald B. Hoesterey said. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly and Prescott disagreed with the majority of the council on another 
election issue as well -- the shift of local elections from November to April. 
</P>
<P>
Although the change was approved on a 3-2 vote last month, the ordinance was 
reintroduced Monday for the purpose of making a technical change. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Ursula E. Kennedy and Councilmen Richard B. Edgar and Hoesterey say they 
support the change because April elections allow greater focus on local issues 
and lower campaign costs for candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly and Prescott say they support November elections because they cost the 
city less and draw more voters. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Berklee Maughan told the council that as soon as approval is final, 
Nov. 20, he and other residents will begin circulating a referendum aimed at 
overturning the council's decision. 
</P>
<P>
The council was scheduled to consider another election measure as well, but it 
was continued until the next meeting at the request of Prescott. He had 
suggested asking voters to decide whether they would prefer elections in April 
or November, but City Atty. James Rourke advised him that the law allows only 
an advisory vote. Prescott said he wants a chance to study Rourke's written 
opinion. SHANNON SANDS

'LEMON CAR' SUIT REAPS $80,000 AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman won an $80,000 award from an Orange County Superior Court jury Tuesday 
under the state automobile "Lemon Law" for the trouble she suffered with her 
1987 Sterling, which she sent to the repair shop about 20 times in a vain 
effort to fix a variety of electrical glitches. 
</P>
<P>
Glenda Hauth, 47, said the headlights on the British-made, $25,000 car 
sometimes went out when she went over a bump, and the electric seat adjustment, 
radio and mirrors often failed to work. But mechanics at three dealerships 
couldn't repair most of the problems. 
</P>
<P>
"One time the headlights went out and I had to drive 10 miles in the dark," 
Hauth said. "Eventually, I stopped driving the car because it wasn't safe. 
Every time I took it in, they'd say it was repaired and then about a week 
later, boom, it would hit again." 
</P>
<P>
Hauth's attorney, Lawrence Hutchens of Downey, said he believes the jury award 
is the largest ever under the law, which requires manufacturers to replace or 
repurchase a car if they cannot properly repair a defect that affects a car's 
value or safety. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with Austin Rover Cars of North America, distributor of Sterling, and 
the firm's attorney, Gary Yates, could not be reached for comment on the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Juror Estelle Duncan said she and other jurors thought the auto company "did 
not follow through; they never tried to solve her problems," Duncan said. "They 
passed the buck. . . . It was definitely a lemon." 
</P>
<P>
Hauth said she was pleased with the verdict, but would have much preferred to 
have had the car run properly from the start. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what the award was, it can't compensate for all the anguish that 
they put you through," she said. "I'm glad it's over with; I'm glad that they 
finally were shown that they can't do this to people." 
</P>
<P>
The car began having problems soon after Hauth bought it from an Anaheim 
dealership, but she repeatedly tried to have it repaired because "I loved that 
car," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Hauth stopped driving the car at night at the end of 1988. ERIC BAILEY

COMMUNITY CENTER SITE OKD BY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A community center will open this month in a troubled Disneyland-area 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council decided Tuesday night to rent a two-bedroom apartment for $820 
a month in Jeffrey-Lynne, a five-block apartment area behind the Disneyland 
Hotel. The council voted in June to spend $68,000 for the community center, 
including hiring a full-time employee to staff it. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly two years, residents of the predominantly Latino area have been 
asking for a community center which would distribute information in Spanish 
about health care, immigration, jobs and other services. 
</P>
<P>
Opening a community center was one of the recommendations of a $50,000 study of 
the neighborhood conducted earlier this year by a Santa Ana social service 
agency. The apartment will be rented on a month-to-month basis to "allow the 
city to assess the effectiveness . . . without a long-term commitment," said 
Christopher K. Jarvi, director of Parks, Recreation and Community Services.

MAN DIES AFTER BEING FOUND SHOT IN CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 35-year-old man died Monday after he was found sitting in a car at an Anaheim 
park with a gunshot wound in his head, police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The man, an Anaheim resident whose name was being withheld until relatives 
could be notified, died about 11:15 p.m. at Anaheim Memorial Hospital. He had 
been found about 45 minutes earlier in his car on the north side of Pearson 
Park, at Sycamore Street and Harbor Boulevard, Anaheim police said. 
</P>
<P>
No weapon was found nearby, so the case is being treated as a homicide. Police 
said they have established no motives and have no suspects.

TEST OF DRUNK-DRIVER CHECKPOINT PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a dress rehearsal for the holiday season, the La Habra Police Department 
will establish its first-ever drunk-driver checkpoint somewhere in the city 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to get the kinks out before we run it big-time," Police Capt. John 
Rees explained. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 officers will set up a checkpoint that they hope will snare drunk 
drivers and, by publicity and its visibility, deter other drivers from driving 
while intoxicated during the holiday season, Rees said. 
</P>
<P>
He would not say where or when the checkpoint will be set up on Saturday, only 
that it is expected to stay in operation for about seven or eight hours. 
</P>
<P>
He predicted that if the initial outing is successful, "we'll probably be 
seeing more of them in the future."

DATABASE TO FOCUS ON HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

<TEXT>
<P>
In just a few weeks, Capt. Bob Reynolds of the Costa Mesa Fire Department will 
receive computer equipment he says will make the department more effective when 
faced with hazardous spills. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted earlier this week to approve Reynolds' proposal to buy 
$16,898 in computer equipment that will give the department access to Cameo II, 
a database maintained by the National Safety Council that lists the chemical 
properties of thousands of hazardous materials and tells firefighters how to 
cope with a spill or fire. 
</P>
<P>
"Costa Mesa does not have a specially trained hazardous materials team to deal 
with these incidents," Reynolds said. "But even then, no one person could ever 
be trained to know all that's needed. 
</P>
<P>
"The computer will allow us to make a lifesaving response in an emergency. As 
it is now, if you make the wrong decision just once, a real disaster could 
result." 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds said the computer will also allow the department to create its own 
database, listing what hazardous materials are commonly used by industries in 
the city. JANICE JONES

<P>
CANCER PATIENTS GIVEN FAKE CARE, POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A local physician has been charged with giving bogus treatments to cancer 
patients, police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Glen C. Mahoney gave three cancer patients intravenous solutions of 
hydrogen peroxide, a common disinfectant that also is used to lighten hair 
color, Huntington Beach detectives said. 
</P>
<P>
Mahoney, 61, was charged with three counts of giving fraudulent treatment and a 
single count of insurance fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The charges were filed Oct. 11, but Peterson said police decided not to reveal 
the arrest until after the doctor's arraignment, which had been scheduled for 
Monday in Superior Court. The arraignment, however, was delayed until December. 
</P>
<P>
The filing of charges culminated a yearlong investigation that began when the 
family of an Irvine cancer patient called Huntington Beach police to complain 
about the treatments the doctor gave him. 
</P>
<P>
"He was given some treatments that involved IV (intravenous) solutions 
containing hydrogen peroxide," said police Sgt. Bill Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
That patient, Kenneth Sims, 39, died during the course of the investigation 
from complications arising from his cancer, Peterson said. Detectives twice 
searched the doctor's Main Street offices for medical records and have since 
found two women who were given the same treatment for cancer, Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
Mahoney remains in business. Neither he nor his attorney could be reached for 
comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Hydrogen peroxide is sold in drug stores, but it is not commonly accepted as a 
cancer treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"The effect of giving hydrogen peroxide intravenously may well be the 
destruction of the red blood cells in the blood stream," said Dr. Steven 
Armatrout, professor of medicine at UC Irvine.

The County Board of Supervisors Tuesday ordered the preparation of a long-range 
plan on how county government will provide services in the future to South 
County residents. 
</P>
<P>
In light of the rapid growth in the South County, Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez 
said Tuesday, there is a need to begin deciding immediately how government will 
deliver critical services there. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for various facilities are being discussed, including a new, expanded 
south court and sheriff's substation and a larger social services office in 
Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley and Vasquez, whose districts cover the South County, 
said in a letter to the board that the county in the last two years has tried 
unsuccessfully to find space for the Public Defender and Probation Department. 
</P>
<P>
The county administrative office, General Services and the Environmental 
Management Agency were told to prepare the plan and return it to the board in 
120 days. 
</P>
<P>
The board said it should include: 
</P>
<P>
* An assessment of future needs for services based on population projections 
and demographics for the South County. 
</P>
<P>
* An assessment of the type, size and location of government facilities needed 
in South County. 
</P>
<P>
* A study of available resources and funding methods, including land swaps, 
lease-back arrangements and development agreements with builders. GEORGE FRANK

EVENING TRAIN SERVICE TO BE INTERRUPTED 
</P>

<P>
A $15-million upgrade to the railroad tracks between San Juan Capistrano and 
Del Mar will interrupt evening train service from Santa Ana to San Diego for 
three weeks, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
From Sundays to Thursdays, Nov. 26 to Dec. 21, the last two southbound evening 
trains will operate only between Los Angeles and Santa Ana. Both trains -- 
numbered 586 and 587 -- leave Los Angeles at 8:45 p.m. Amtrak will provide 
buses to shuttle passengers between Santa Ana, San Juan Capistrano, Oceanside, 
Del Mar and San Diego, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen daily trains on the Los Angeles-to-San Diego route may also be delayed 
up to 20 minutes because they will be traveling at slower speeds, said Joanna 
Capelle, spokesperson for the Los Angeles-San Diego Rail Corridor Agency. The 
slowdown is a safety measure in case passers-by create a hazard by placing 
construction materials on the tracks, Capelle said. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time we did repair work we had quite a lot of vandalism," Capelle 
said. "It potentially could cause a serious problem." 
</P>
<P>
Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway company crews will work from 8 p.m. to 
4:30 a.m., Sundays through Thursdays, laying new, smoother rails on a 51-mile 
stretch between the San Juan Capistrano depot and an area in north San Diego 
County known as the Sorrento Valley, about five miles south of Del Mar. WENDY

FAA CHIEF LAUDS EFFORTS TO FIND NEW AIRPORT; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORT: INACTION IN BUILDING MAJOR U.S. AIRPORTS WILL CAUSE WORSENING FLIGHT 
DELAYS MEANING LOST PRODUCTIVITY, INCREASED COSTS, MISSED CONNECTIONS AND 
WASTED TIME, AN OFFICIAL WARNED.

The head of the Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday applauded efforts in 
Orange County to seek an alternative facility to John Wayne Airport, saying new 
commercial airports are urgently needed nationwide in order to meet growing 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
FAA Administrator James B. Busey IV, speaking to a group of private pilots at 
the Westin South Coast Plaza hotel, said no new commercial airports have been 
opened in the country in 15 years, despite a doubling of air traffic during the 
same time. 
</P>
<P>
There are 21 major airports that are now severely congested, Busey said, and 
that number will double in the next eight years unless more airports are built. 
The result of inaction, he said, will be ever-worsening flight delays. 
</P>
<P>
"Delays are costing us billions of dollars a year in reduced productivity, 
increased fuel costs, missed connections (and) wasted time," Busey told 310 
members of the Orange County Aviation Council, an influential private pilots 
organization. "More congestion will mean higher transportation costs for 
everyone. American travelers will pay more, and American businesses will find 
it harder to compete in today's global markets. Our entire economy would be 
affected." 
</P>
<P>
Busey, 56, a retired Navy admiral, was speaking for the first time on the West 
Coast since being confirmed by the Senate on June 23 as the nation's 
top-ranking air safety official. He succeeded T. Allan McArtor, who resigned 
earlier this year to return to the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday morning, Busey visited the Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center 
in Palmdale, which handles high-altitude aircraft in Southern California. In 
the afternoon, Busey toured the new terminal under construction at John Wayne 
Airport and met with controllers in the control tower. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Busey complimented Orange County officials for their 
perseverance in seeking a site for a new commercial airport to relieve 
congestion at John Wayne, which ranks as the nation's fifth busiest airport in 
terms of total flight operations. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Airport Site Coalition, which has been studying a number of sites 
for a regional airport in recent years, is due to make its final recommendation 
by the end of the year to the county's Board of Supervisors. The sites under 
consideration are Potrero Los Pinos in the Cleveland National Forest, Norton 
Air Force Base in San Bernardino County and south Camp Pendleton in San Diego 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, you folks (in Orange County) have your eye on the future," Busey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Busey noted, however, that the FAA has little control over airport site and 
selection, as those decisions are made on the local level. He added that 
support groups such as the Orange County Aviation Council, which has been in 
existence since 1974, are instrumental in influencing local policy makers on 
airport site decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Busey said the kind of community opposition that has greeted some of the Orange 
County site proposals is widespread across the country and has stymied the 
opening of new airports. A new airport scheduled for ground breaking in Denver 
in two weeks is the first to be built nationwide since the Dallas-Ft. Worth 
Airport opened in 1974, Busey said. 
</P>
<P>
"In many communities, we don't have the solid, dependable base of public 
support that we need in order to build or improve airports," Busey said. "The 
unhappy fact is that a lot of people are indifferent to aviation. They would 
have no objection if a shopping mall replaced the local airport. Others are 
supportive of airports, but 'not in my back yard.' " 
</P>
<P>
Airport opponents are so vocal that they influence local decision-makers more 
than airport proponents, Busey said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we want to build support for airport improvements, then, we must speak for 
airport development as others speak against it," he told the aviation council 
members. "I urge you to make yourselves heard in the political arena where it 
counts." 
</P>
<P>
In a news conference afterwards, Busey elaborated on his prepared remarks, 
saying that some existing airports could close because of the proliferation of 
noise abatement procedures set up by local government bodies at John Wayne and 
other airports around the country. 
</P>
<P>
The procedures are so stringent, he said, that only specially equipped jets can 
abide by the noise requirements. Busey said the FAA is considering a national 
noise policy which would supersede the varying local noise limits. 
</P>
<P>
On the subject of crowded skies, Busey told the aviation council that the 
common public perception of "winglock" or "gridlock" in the skies is 
exaggerated. He said the FAA allows only so many aircraft aloft as can be 
safely handled by the air-traffic-control system. 
</P>
<P>
Others are kept on the ground until they can be cleared for takeoff, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA is trying to speed the flow of traffic by changing control procedures 
and redesigning airspace in high-density air corridors along the East Coast and 
in Southern California, Busey said. The FAA is also investing $15 billion into 
an ambitious plan to overhaul aging air-traffic-control equipment. Much of that 
equipment, Busey said, has already been replaced or is about to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Besides speeding up aviation traffic, Busey said the new equipment is improving 
safety in the skies. 
</P>
<P>
"None of us want another midair collision like the (Aug. 31, 1986) Cerritos 
disaster," Busey said. 
</P>
<P>
The collision over Cerritos between an Aeromexico jetliner and a single-engine 
plane killed 82 people, including 15 on the ground, and brought great pressure 
to bear on private pilots because the small plane was found to have strayed 
into controlled airspace, causing that disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to complaints by private pilots that the restructuring of the 
region's airspace is driving them out of the skies, Busey said the FAA would 
make sure to leave enough special corridors open to private pilots so they can 
bypass restricted areas.

An off-duty California Highway Patrol officer was injured Tuesday when his 
motorcycle collided with a car that had just left the parking lot of McGaugh 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Jeffrey Giovinetti was reported in a stable condition at Los Alamitos 
Hospital, where he was treated for cuts to his head, face and both hands, CHP 
Officer Lyle Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
Giovinetti was driving south on Seal Beach Boulevard when his car collided with 
a car driven by Kathleen Gester of Long Beach, as she tried to turn left from 
the school's parking lot. Whitten said Giovinetti was thrown about 37 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Gester suffered minor injuries and was taken to the Long Beach Memorial 
Hospital. Her niece, a passenger, was not injured, Whitten said.

PICKETS AT CARL'S JR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading the news accounts of National Organization for Women supporters 
picketing the Carl's Jr. Restaurant in Irvine (Oct.29) Sande Soloman's 
statement " . . . and we're here to protest Carl Karcher" kept ringing in my 
ears. 
</P>
<P>
If Ms. Soloman and the NOW supporters are telling us not to buy Mr. Karcher's 
hamburgers, are they going to urge all of their families and friends to boycott 
any hospital, shelter, community service or charity funded by the Karcher 
family? Or is it all right to sock it to Mr. Karcher's business but continue to 
take from his ever-extended hand?

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
TIME FOR COMPASSION, NOT FEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is easy to feel bad about the homeless -- there are an estimated 10,000 
without shelter, many of them children, in Orange County alone -- and simply 
leave it at that. But a group of Orange County churches has decided to go 
beyond thinking about the homeless to actually providing shelter and food for 
the winter months to some who are homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The program is modeled after a successful shelter effort in San Diego. It will 
provide a warm bed or cot, showers and meals for up to 24 people who will be 
divided into two groups and be housed at churches for rotating two-week 
periods. Other churches -- 25 of them are involved -- will provide volunteers, 
food and other support services. Initially, at least, the focus will be on 
single people who are employable so that they can also be helped to find work. 
This supplements a county program in which the Santa Ana and Fullerton 
armoriesare opened to as many as 250 people a night when temperatures drop 
below 40 degrees or when there is a 50% chance of rain. 
</P>
<P>
While the numbers involved in the church program are very small compared to the 
need, it must be remembered that behind the overwhelming statistics are 
individuals who would spend the night in a car or under a bench were it not for 
the beds these churches are providing. The program will also promote 
understanding. As one of the organizers of the San Diego program said: "One of 
the most valuable things this program does is break down stereotypes." 
</P>
<P>
The program represents an especially courageous attempt in the face of the 
NIMBY (not-in-my-back-yard) mentality that recently has pervaded some 
neighborhoods where services for the poor have been provided. It should evoke 
compassion and not fear in the communities these churches serve.

AS THE RAMS TURN, THEIR FAITHFUL PREPARE FOR THE WORST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For Dale Hatcher, there was a flash of purple, a second unexpected thump of the 
football, one last glimpse at the back of Mike Merriweather's jersey and, then, 
he was done with it. 
</P>
<P>
For Ram fans, of course, the pain never ends. 
</P>
<P>
Haven't the past 20 years in Ram history been one blocked punt against the 
Minnesota Vikings? 
</P>
<P>
There are love-hate relationships, there are living hells, there is unrequited 
love and there is life as a Ram fan. Within the realm of professional sports, 
there is really nothing like it. 
</P>
<P>
At least the Chicago Cubs promise a few laughs along the way. The L.A. Clippers 
give you Benoit Benjamin, the world's tallest stand-up comedian. The Cleveland 
Indians are never, ever going to win -- John McNamara, a leader for the '90s? 
-- and their fans have come to take great comfort in this knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
But the Rams? 
</P>
<P>
They are just good enough to pique your interest -- Is this, at last, the Super 
Bowl season? -- and just bad enough to tweak your emotions every time the 
stakes get high enough. 
</P>
<P>
The whole essence of the experience was laid out on the Metrodome turf Sunday 
during the last 10 minutes of the latest sucker punch against the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
Hope. Down, 18-7, the Rams rally for one touchdown, force a Minnesota punt deep 
in Viking territory and break through to block that punt. 
</P>
<P>
Despair. The loose football bounces straight into the hands of Viking punter 
Bucky Scribner, who promptly rolls to his left and completes a pass -- good for 
a Minnesota first down with 1:17 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Renewed Hope. Officials wipe out the play, citing illegal receivers downfield, 
and the Vikings punt again. This time, the Rams take possession and drive the 
rest of the way for a 21-18 lead with 28 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Renewed Despair. The Vikings throw two identical Hail Mary passes, complete the 
second for a 43-yard gain and call upon Rich Karlis to kick his seventh field 
goal and send the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
One More Time. The Rams win the coin toss and get first possession in sudden 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Hook, Line, Sinker. Three downs yield nine yards for the Rams. One yard short, 
they are forced to punt again. Here comes Mike Merriweather. There goes the 
ballgame: 23-21, Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
We all saw it coming. 
</P>
<P>
We've all seen it before. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as Merriweather broke past blocking back Mike Wilcher and cast a shadow 
over Hatcher, all the brutal images came rushing back, a cavalcade of Ram 
disasters through the years. 
</P>
<P>
If you squinted a bit, you could see . . . 
</P>
<P>
Joe Kapp hurdling over empty-armed Ram defenders and Roman Gabriel getting 
sacked for that final safety, turning a 1969 Ram season that began 11-0 into a 
first-round playoff washout in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Preece and Eddie McMillan leaping for that underthrown Roger Staubach 
pass and smashing into each other, allowing the ball to float into Drew 
Pearson's hands for the touchdown that clinched the Rams' 1973 playoff defeat 
in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Mack getting flagged for "illegal motion" on the Minnesota half-yard line, 
erasing a Ram touchdown pass in the 1974 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
James Harris throwing an interception in the end zone on the very next play, 
sealing a 14-10 Ram defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Preston Pearson making diving catches in the end zone to lead the wild-card 
Dallas Cowboys to a 37-7 upset of the Rams in the 1975 NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Nate Allen blocking that Tom Dempsey field goal try, Bobby Bryant running it 
back 90 yards and the Vikings beating the Rams again in the 1976 NFC title 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams exulting over the long-awaited opportunity to play the Vikings at 
home, minus Fran Tarkenton, in the 1977 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings bringing Minnesota weather with them and the rain rendering Ram 
quarterback Pat Haden useless in a 14-7 Viking triumph. 
</P>
<P>
John Stallworth outleaping Rod Perry for that Terry Bradshaw bomb in the fourth 
quarter of the 1980 Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Dieter Brock trying to relearn, or re-invent, the art of the forward pass in 
Chicago in early January, one futile step away from the 1986 Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
A question: How many times can you ask someone to pick up his heart off the 
floor? 
</P>
<P>
An observation: If the Rams haven't already pressed their luck in 1989, they 
never will. 
</P>
<P>
So far this season, we've seen the Rams beat the 49ers in San Francisco, go 5-0 
and get the Super Bowl drums beating by mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, we've seen the coming of Frank Reich and the going of the Flipper 
Anderson miracle, the New Orleans disgrace, the lethargy against Chicago and 
too much of the color purple in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Rams are 5-4, awaiting Sunday's encounter with the 8-1 New York 
Giants and barely breathing in the NFC wild-card race. 
</P>
<P>
Are their fans mad as hell yet? 
</P>
<P>
Are they not going to take it anymore? 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, it was announced that Sunday's game will be a sellout. More than 
60,000 souls are gearing up to be thrashed again. 
</P>
<P>
One season-ticket holder explains it this way: "Some people watch soap operas; 
we watch the Rams. They make us laugh and they make us cry." 
</P>
<P>
So they keep coming and they keep hoping, half-knowing how it's going to turn 
out in advance. Just Say No? That would be too easy. 
</P>
<P>
And as any fan of this tragedy in hip pads will tell you, nothing about the 
Rams, even giving up on them, is ever done easily.

BERGEN BRUNSWIG STOCK UNDER SELLING PRESSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Buffeted by rumors of short selling, Bergen Brunswig Corp.'s common stock came 
under selling pressure in unusually heavy trading Tuesday on the American Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said they were puzzled by the activity -- nearly 170,000 
shares were traded, compared to a normal daily volume of about 64,000. Nothing 
the distributor of wholesale pharmaceuticals and videotapes is doing or 
planning would account for the flurry of trading, said investor relations 
spokesman John Fay. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the heavy trading, the company's stock ended the day at $23.75, only 
down 25 cents a share. On Monday, the company's stock fell 75 cents to $24. 
</P>
<P>
Fay said that the reported short selling activity, which involved only about 
50,000 shares, should not have influenced the stock price. There are more than 
34 million Bergen Brunswig common shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
In short selling, a speculator sells borrowed stock, gambling that the stock's 
price will fall by the time the borrowed shares must be replaced, usually 
within five days of the initial transaction. The short seller makes a profit if 
he can buy replacement shares for less than he sold the stock for, and loses if 
the stock price increases. 
</P>
<P>
Several Wall Street investment analysts said early Tuesday that a previously 
announced plan by Bergen Brunswig to offer $410 million worth of convertible 
notes was the likely reason for the stock activity. 
</P>
<P>
Fay declined to comment on the offer, citing Securities and Exchange Commission 
regulations. The industry analysts, however, said that stock speculators might 
be concerned about the additional debt Bergen Brunswig will take on with its 
offering and were selling short in anticipation of a short-term drop in the 
stock price. 
</P>
<P>
The company ended fiscal 1989 in August with $130 million cash on hand and 
expects to realize an additional $151 million from the proceeds of the 
convertible note offering. 
</P>
<P>
Bergen Brunswig officials have said they intend to use the company's hefty cash 
reserves to pursue acquisitions, modernize warehousing and distribution 
facilities, and build inventory to protect against future price increases. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Moody's Investors Service on Monday assigned a BAA1 rating to 
Bergen Brunswig's proposed convertible note offering and upgraded the rating on 
$43 million in outstanding subordinated debt to BAA1 from BAA3. 
</P>
<P>
The BAA group is Moody's "medium grade" investment rating, indicating that the 
credit rating service doesn't attach any serious problems, or significant 
benefits, to investments in the notes. BAA1 is the best or highest of the three 
BAA grades. 
</P>
<P>
Moody's said it had assigned the rating to Bergen Brunswig's proposed notes and 
existing subordinated debentures because of the company's "significantly 
improved operating performance in its core drug wholesale business over the 
past two years," and because of the company's "strong market position and its 
healthy financial posture." 
</P>
<P>
The rating service said it also expects Bergen Brunswig's earnings and revenues 
to increase over the next few years because of the overall health of the 
wholesale drug industry.

EDEN AIR FREIGHT TO BE U.S. PARTNER OF JAPANESE COMPANY 
</P>

<P>
Eden Air Freight of Irvine, the freight forwarder started two years ago by 
Burlington Air Express founder Larry L. Rodberg, has signed a joint operating 
agreement with Sankyu Inc. of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Sankyu is a Japanese conglomerate that plays a big role in that country's air 
freight industry. Sankyu lost its previous U.S. partner to a merger. 
</P>
<P>
Enter Eden, which will handle the U.S. end of all Sankyu air freight shipments 
from Japan, and Sankyu will handle the Japan end of pickup and delivery of 
freight forwarded there by Eden. 
</P>
<P>
The contract is another boost for Eden, which opened its doors on Black Monday 
-- Oct. 19, 1987 -- but does not seem to have been harmed by that coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Rodberg said, Eden has established 21 offices in this country and 37 in 
foreign countries, with most of those in Europe and Asia. Eden's annual gross 
revenue is about $35 million.

1 Some Up, Some Down: The October sales reports for Orange County auto 
importers are a mixed bag. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America in Cypress reported that sales for the month 
-- usually one characterized by lower activity -- hit a record 11,414 passenger 
cars, up 136% from October, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
American Suzuki Motor Corp. in Brea, hit hard last year by a negative Consumer 
Reports review of its Samurai sports vehicle (a review later repudiated by a 
government study), said October sales showed the beginning of a recovery from 
last year's moribund pace, with 2,899 cars and sports trucks sold, up 92% from 
1,509 units a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
In Garden Grove, Hyundai Motor America said it sold 14,663 autos in October, 
down 9.7% from 16,232 units in October 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Mazda Motors of America in Irvine said it sold 24,820 vehicles last 
month, down 3.3% from the 25,680 sold in October 1988.

ATM CARDS LET CARL'S JR. DISH UP BURGERS, BUCKS; 
</P>
<P>
PLASTIC MONEY: RESTAURANT CHAIN JOINS GROWING LIST OF BUSINESSES USING 
ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS. OFFICIALS BELIEVE IT'LL GREATLY HELP SALES. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carl's Jr. customers will soon be able to order a burger, fries and a side 
order of cash. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim-based Carl Karcher Enterprises on Tuesday became the first major 
fast-food chain to approve the use of automated teller cards at most of its 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
As the electronic system is installed over the next year in the chain's 423 
California restaurants, customers will be able to use plastic money -- namely, 
bank debit cards from four major California banks -- to pay for their food 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
And patrons can trot off carrying more than just a bag of burgers. Carl's Jr. 
will allow patrons to receive up to $40 cash back with their purchases. 
</P>
<P>
By accepting automated teller machine (ATM) cards, Carl's Jr. is joining a 
growing list of retailers -- including gas stations, supermarkets and 
convenience stores -- allowing customers to use plastic money. 
</P>
<P>
Just about every major competitor -- including McDonald's, Wendy's, Arby's, 
Jack in the Box and Burger King -- has tested or researched the use of bank 
cards. But most of them have small pilot programs that either issue scrip 
redeemable for food or accept credit cards, which involves interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
Carl's Jr. is "way ahead of everyone" in developing the use of bank cards, said 
Carolyn Levy, a restaurant analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton. But in the 
already bloated fast-food market, "everyone is desperate to increase customer 
counts -- so there's no question that the rest will leap in if it works for 
Carl's," Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
Carl's Jr. decided to adopt the ATM system after a two-year test at more than 
120 Carl's Jr. stores in San Diego and Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
At those stores, customers pay 10 cents per transaction to pay for their 
Chicken Clubs and Famous Stars by sliding a bank card through a card reader. A 
debit card allows payment to be electronically transferred from the customer's 
bank account to Carl's Jr. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the ATM systems seem to have given card carriers a bigger appetite. 
Customers who use debit cards spend an average of 50% more at Carl's Jr. than 
before, said Bob Altman, a company vice president. Overall sales are up at the 
test sites, too, but Carl's officials declined to provide numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Carl's Jr. officials believe that purchases made with ATM cards will account 
for up to 7% of the chain's transactions within two years -- and eventually 
more than 10% once drive-through customers can use plastic money (which the 
system currently doesn't allow). 
</P>
<P>
That's for an investment of roughly $2,000 per restaurant to install the 
systems -- which Altman estimates will be paid back within the first 18 months 
of operation. 
</P>
<P>
The system, through Wells Fargo Bank's Interlink system, accepts ATM cards from 
Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Security Pacific and First Interstate. But 
starting next spring, the Wells Fargo system will expand to add the state's 
major savings and loan associations and larger credit unions. 
</P>
<P>
The system will be added at all 423 company-owned Carl's Jr.'s in California, 
with the chain's 60 franchisees having the option of joining. The 48 stores in 
Arizona, Nevada and Oregon are not included.

An aide to Orange County Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita), a chief critic of 
governmental arts funding, will speak in San Jose on Nov. 18 about the recent 
controversy over federal funding of exhibits of photographs of homoerotic 
material and of a crucifix immersed in urine. Aide David Eisner will address 
the forum, which is part of the annual congress of the California Confederation 
of the Arts, running Nov. 16-18. The confederation is the state's largest 
arts-advocacy organization. The congress will also address the potential of the 
arts to play a key role in the 1990 governor's race. For information on the 
forum or the congress, call (916) 447-7811.

RESTAURANTS RAISE $11,435 DONATION FOR RED CROSS

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County restaurants donated $11,435 to the Red Cross Disaster Fund this 
week, responding to restaurateur Rex Chandler's challenge to donate 10% of 
their take from Saturday's receipts. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler, owner of Rex Restaurant in Newport Beach and the Newport Oyster Bar 
&amp; Grill, also is a board member of the county's American Red Cross chapter. 
Last week he asked fellow restaurateurs to designate Saturday as "Nov. 4 for 
the Red Cross." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Chandler's own restaurants, those participating included the 
Bouzy Rouge Cafe, the Cannery, Marrakesh, Malarkey's Irish Pub and Cano's, all 
in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Others were Ruby's Diners in Fullerton, Balboa, Costa Mesa, Mission Viejo and 
Seal Beach; Back Bay Rowing &amp; Running Club, Costa Mesa; Bangkok 4, Costa 
Mesa; Studio Cafe, Corona del Mar, and Salud! in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler said there has been "a tremendous outpouring of concern" from Orange 
County for victims of the Oct. 17 Bay Area earthquake. He said 200 people from 
Orange County have worked for the Red Cross in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Bill Medley's Oct. 29 earthquake relief benefit show at the 
Righteous Brothers' Hop in Fountain Valley raised about $5,500, according to 
Cherlynn Hurdle, office manager at the Hop. The money, earmarked for San 
Francisco disaster aid, was donated through the Orange County chapter of the 
American Red Cross. Medley's show featured a guest appearance by Jennifer 
Warnes for "(I've Had) The Time of My Life," the duo's hit theme from "Dirty 
Dancing."

ARISTOTLE HAD TV PEGGED ABOUT 23 CENTURIES AGO; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: A POMONA COLLEGE PROFESSOR USES THE PHILOSOPHER TO DEMONSTRATE HOW 
TO SEPARATE THE GOOD FROM THE BAD ON TELEVISION.

Aristotle as the world's foremost TV critic? 
</P>
<P>
The philosopher who roamed the hills outside Athens 23 centuries ago "prepared 
the world for the video revolution like no textbook ever written," contends 
English professor Brian Stonehill. And Prof. Stonehill's course, "Arts of 
Persuasion," at Pomona College here has become one of the most popular on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
It has also won high praise nationwide for rekindling an emphasis on visual 
literacy in an academic setting. The class is intended primarily for TV 
watchers, not for the medium's future producers. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Visual literacy' is a catchword that has been kicking around since the days 
of Marshall McLuhan in the '60s but had sort of run its course," says Howard 
Myrick, chairman of the radio and television department at Temple University. 
Stonehill "is saying academia is not doing enough on the subject," Myrick said, 
"and he's right." 
</P>
<P>
"More English departments should be familiar with the fact that TV, in 
particular, is now the way that our culture is being disseminated," says Garth 
Jowett, professor of communications at the University of Houston. "Part of the 
problem with media studies is that it is all career-oriented, teaching kids to 
turn knobs and push buttons. If one is going to study rhetoric -- and TV is a 
form of it just as literature is -- we should not limit ourselves to literature 
on paper." 
</P>
<P>
When he began his course in persuasion here 10 years ago, Stonehill mined 
classics such as John Donne's sermons, the speeches of Abraham Lincoln and John 
Milton's "Areopagitica." 
</P>
<P>
But he soon became convinced that television was by far the "most persuasive 
instrument of our times" and set out to describe its influence in detail. 
</P>
<P>
His explorations led him straight to Aristotle, who saw every attempt at 
persuasion to be composed of three elements: logos (intellectual content), 
pathos (emotional content), and ethos (authority based on personal charisma). 
</P>
<P>
"For a television context, I updated the lingo to 'smarts,' 'hearts,' and 
'sparkle,' " Stonehill told a recent class. Writing the three words on the 
blackboard, he then plotted a full day's network programming, from early 
morning until past midnight, to show where the daily TV diet falls. 
</P>
<P>
"On the morning news shows, ethos is high," he says, referring to the heavy use 
of celebrity guests whose appeal is personal expertise or character. 
</P>
<P>
"Next comes the morning game shows, whose stock in trade is emotion," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
Afternoon soap operas are high on pathos, too, he says, appealing to audiences 
of homemakers often alone at home. 
</P>
<P>
The triumph of logos doesn't come until the nightly news, Stonehill says, and 
for a while thereafter, "dwindling into non-demanding evening talk shows. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
Sorting out the patterns of TV fare leads us, he says, "to see both how TV 
responds to our (viewing) behavior but also how our behavior is shaped by those 
patterns." 
</P>
<P>
Stonehill is not a naysayer about all things on the screen. "I don't join those 
of my colleagues who say we have to stop our kids from watching TV," he 
explains. "We have to accept the fact that TV has a great, attractive holding 
power and first teach people how to watch critically, how to be informed 
viewers, how to recognize rhetoric, deception and false claims, because 
democracy is both wonderfully served by TV and also deeply threatened." 
</P>
<P>
Besides examining the uses of rhetoric in news programs and speeches, such as 
President Bush's recent speech on national drug abuse, Stonehill asks his 
classes to watch programs with an eye to such limitations as the "fallacy of 
the excluded middle." 
</P>
<P>
"For the sake of drama, cop, lawyer and detective shows overdraw characters to 
give us the extremes of character and neglect the middle ground in which most 
of us live," he says. "Talk shows such as (the now-canceled) Morton Downey 
Jr.'s are well-known for playing off two extremes of opinion. TV news does this 
with issues of rich vs. poor, communism vs. capitalism, abortion, and all the 
rest. It tends to polarize people out of all proportion to the real issues at 
hand." 
</P>
<P>
Other media are susceptible to the same shortcomings, he adds, but the problems 
are exacerbated on TV because of higher pressure to see comparisons visually 
and a pressure for ratings. So a built-in danger for TV is hyperbole, 
overstating a case visually. "TV has a filter that enhances conflict." 
</P>
<P>
Stonehill gives other tips on visual literacy: Be alert to the subtle flattery 
of eye contact by someone who is really reading through a TelePrompTer; be 
aware of unfair conclusions about politicians based on dress that may or may 
not play well under television lighting; be aware of one-window views of such 
countries as Northern Ireland, where most media stories are about a single 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Stonehill also lets his classes know the strengths of TV. "Television is 
unequaled in taking viewers to far places to show them what is going on, to 
show them cultures of other countries." Stonehill says, or the Earth as seen 
from the moon. He says C-Span's telecasts from the floor of Congress "show 
Americans the democratic process they couldn't understand any other way." It's 
a perfect window into such issues as global environment, depicting devastation 
of rain forests or beaches, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Once the good on TV has been identified and sorted out from the bad, Stonehill 
says his students have two obligations -- to "vote" for the good both by 
watching those shows and by writing letters to encourage writers and producers 
to provide more such shows. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very easy to think that our proper response to television is passive," he 
says. "But we can't blame anybody but ourselves for the state of the medium. We 
have to work at it."

A federal appeals court panel today refused to release jailed television 
evangelist Jim Bakker while he appeals his conviction for fleecing millions 
from PTL followers. 
</P>
<P>
A three-judge panel of the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals said a motion on 
behalf of the defrocked minister was not sufficient to refute evidence that he 
might flee if released. 
</P>
<P>
The judges said hundreds of letters from loyal followers did not provide a 
basis for releasing Bakker. The letters were received in U.S. District Court in 
Charlotte, N.C., where Bakker was convicted Oct. 5 of 23 counts of mail and 
wire fraud and one count of conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Bakker, 49, was sentenced Oct. 24 to 45 years in prison and fined $500,000. He 
was immediately taken into custody and is serving his time at a federal prison 
in Minnesota.

NO O.C. PROSECUTION OF RAMIREZ; 
</P>
<P>
NIGHT STALKER: WITH THE DEATH SENTENCE ALREADY ORDERED FOR 13 MURDERS, 'IT'S 
SIMPLY NOT NECESSARY,' OFFICIAL SAYS.

<P>
Night Stalker Richard Ramirez, sentenced to death in Los Angeles for 13 
murders, will not be prosecuted in Orange County on rape and attempted murder 
charges in a 1985 attack on a Mission Viejo couple, Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. 
James G. Enright said today. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to put our victim (the rape victim) through the ordeal of 
testifying again unless we had to," Enright said. "Now that Ramirez has 
received a death sentence, it's simply not necessary." 
</P>
<P>
At a preliminary hearing two years ago, the young woman took the witness stand 
to identify Ramirez as the man who broke into the home she shared with her 
fiance on Aug. 25, 1985. The two had discussed the terror of the Night Stalker 
attacks in Los Angeles County just before falling asleep, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The fiance, William Carns, now 33, was shot three times in the head and has 
been in constant recuperative therapy since then. The assailant told the young 
woman before raping her that he was the Night Stalker, and made her declare she 
loved Satan. 
</P>
<P>
A young boy picked up a partial license plate of a suspicious vehicle near the 
couple's home that night, which helped lead to Ramirez's arrest in Los Angeles 
a few days later. 
</P>
<P>
The Mission Viejo rape victim told a hearing judge in Santa Ana two years ago 
she could identify Ramirez, now 29, a self-proclaimed devil worshiper from El 
Paso, Texas, by his walk, and the unique way he said "jewerly" when he robbed 
the couple. Ramirez had been ordered to repeat the word during a lineup after 
his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The young woman, also now 33, has moved to Northern California, where Enright 
says only her employer knows about the Night Stalker incident. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to her on Oct. 13 and told her that we would not go forward with our 
case if the jury death verdict for Ramirez was upheld by the judge in Los 
Angeles," Enright said. "She was very, very relieved. She did not want to 
testify again." 
</P>
<P>
Enright said that even though Carns will not be a witness -- he has no memory 
of events that night -- he, too, is relieved to know that the Orange County 
case against Ramirez is now over. Enright said the couple are no longer 
engaged. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the many, many tragedies of this whole thing is that their relationship 
is no longer the same," Enright said. "The impact has been incredibly traumatic 
for both of them." 
</P>
<P>
Technically, the Orange County charges against Ramirez could be reinstated 
should he win his automatic appeal of his Los Angeles death sentence. But even 
if an appeal were successful, Enright said, refiling of the Orange County 
charges would be unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
"If he won quickly on an appeal, he would just be brought back to Los Angeles 
for a new trial," Enright said. "But I suspect that his appeal is going to take 
about 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez is next scheduled to be tried in San Francisco for a murder there. 
Enright said his office is attempting to reach authorities there today to let 
them know that the Orange County bench warrant has been withdrawn.

WALL SAYS WEAK S&amp;LS MAY FACE FORCED MERGERS

Federal savings and loan regulator M. Danny Wall warned industry executives 
today that an "arranged marriage" with a merger partner might be the only way 
to prevent a weak institution from closing. 
</P>
<P>
"Thrifts that are undercapitalized are in very grave jeopardy. Understand 
that," Wall told 3,600 delegates at the 97th annual convention of the U.S. 
League of Saving Institutions, the industry's largest trade group. 
</P>
<P>
Wall, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, didn't mention in his 
speech the controversy swirling around his agency's handling of the failure of 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn. of Irvine, expected to cost taxpayers as much 
as $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But, at a news conference, he defended his decision to delay seizure of Lincoln 
by nearly two years, saying he understood he was legally required to keep it 
open unless it was insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Wall's agency issued new regulations requiring S&amp;L owners to 
back their lending with more of their own capital. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift office estimates that about 800 of the nation's 2,600 solvent 
S&amp;Ls will fall nearly $20 billion short of the new standard. Regulators 
have identified 223 of those S&amp;Ls as likely candidates for government 
takeover. Many of the others will be able to meet the requirements by shrinking 
their balance sheets or retaining profits, Wall said. 
</P>
<P>
The rest, about 300, "must consider a merger or the reality of being acquired," 
Wall said, warning weak thrifts not to be too choosy about suitors. 
</P>
<P>
Thrifts not meeting capital standards by the end of 1994 face closure. In the 
meantime, the thrift office will launch a vigorous "matchmaker" program.

SANTA CLARITA SAYS NO TO ROADS; 
</P>
<P>
MEASURE P: VOTERS DECISIVELY REJECTED THE $285-MILLION TAX PLAN. THE WINNING 
CAMPAIGN HAD ACCENTED DEVELOPERS' RESPONSIBILITIES. 
</P>

<P>
Voters in the Santa Clarita Valley overwhelmingly rejected a tax initiative 
that would have raised $285 million to build and improve roads in the 
fastest-growing region of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Final election results today showed that 15,714 voters, just under 80% of the 
total, cast ballots against Measure P. The measure got only 4,000 votes. 
</P>
<P>
The decisive vote against Measure P was a blow to the valley's political 
leadership, which had endorsed the tax and raised more than $86,000 to promote 
the measure. Many of the region's leading citizens, including Mayor Jan Heidt 
and state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), supported Measure P. 
</P>
<P>
A small group of homeowners, all political unknowns, raised only $1,900 to 
fight Measure P. The group, known as SMRT for Stop Mello-Roos Tax, said the 
measure was a developer-backed ploy that would have forced homeowners to pay 
for roads that should be built by developers or local and state governments. 
Mello-Roos refers to legislation allowing such tax proposals. 
</P>
<P>
When campaign spending reports released last month showed that most of the 
money raised by the Roads Now Committee came from developers and contractors, 
SMRT pounced on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The spending reports showed that SMRT was right, said John Machin, a SMRT 
spokesman. "It gave us credibility," Machin said. 
</P>
<P>
The public also knew that SMRT was made up of people not tied to the valley's 
political power structure, he said. "People saw we were just other homeowners," 
Machin said. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Dean, another SMRT member, summed up Measure P's demise: "It's very 
simple," he said. "People are taxed-out." 
</P>
<P>
The measure would have created a joint-powers agency, made up of county and 
Santa Clarita officials, to select the road projects to be supported by the

Miss West Virginia has been charged with brandishing a gun after an auto 
accident damaged the white sports coupe that came with her crown. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Bittinger, a 19-year-old who came under fire after the Miss America 
Pageant for remarks deemed racist, was arrested with another motorist after the 
two swore out complaints against each other Tuesday, Police Chief Ed DeVito 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bittinger and Tammy Boyce, 23, were freed on $200 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Bittinger said Boyce forced her 1989 Chevrolet Beretta off the road and into a 
utility pole, causing damage estimated by police at $4,000. Immediately 
afterward, Bittinger brandished a handgun, police said.

The beauty queen came under fire earlier this year when she said, after failing

"If it's political, it's not my fault. If you look at the top 10, it's quite 
obvious. It was one black, one Korean, one Japanese, one hearing-impaired, one 
kidney implant, and of course Texas and Florida were part of the top 10. It 
makes you wonder."

THATCHER SEEKS U.N. ENVIRONMENTAL PACT

British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called today for the drafting of a 
"good conduct guide for all nations" to protect the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe we should aim to have a convention on global climate change ready by 
the time the World Conference on Environment and Development meets in 1992," 
she said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly. "That will be among the most 
important conferences the United Nations has ever held." 
</P>
<P>
In an address devoted entirely to environmental concerns, she said, "The most 
pressing task which faces us at the international level is to negotiate a 
framework convention on climate change -- a sort of good conduct guide for all 
nations." 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher also announced that Britain, which has some of the leading experts in 
the field, will establish a Center for the Prediction of Climate Change "which 
will lead the effort to improve our prophetic capacity." 
</P>
<P>
The center, providing advanced computing facilities, would be open to experts 
from all over the world, especially from developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
Delivering her first U.N. speech since 1985, Thatcher cited the threats posed 
by over-intensive cultivation, the destruction of forests, the laying bare of 
mountainsides, the burning of fossil fuels that produce so-called greenhouse 
gases and the pollution of rivers and seas. 
</P>
<P>
Every year an area of forest equal to the whole surface of Britain is 
destroyed, she told the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
It was no good squabbling over who was responsible or who should pay, she said. 
Whole areas of the planet could be subject to drought and starvation if the 
pattern of rains and monsoons were to change as a result of the destruction of 
forests and the accumulation of greenhouse gases.

<P>
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's office, fearing a diplomatic snub from 
President Bush, today urged the American leader to invite the Israeli leader to 
Washington during his U.S. visit. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of an invitation from Bush, less than a week before Shamir flies to 
the United States for private meetings, was front-page news in Israeli 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"Bush still balking at inviting Shamir," the Jerusalem Post said in a lead 
article that attributed the delay to U.S. irritation at Israel's position on 
Middle East peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir is to leave Monday for the United States to speak to Jewish 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not yet received word from the White House about a possible meeting 
with Mr. Bush. If invited, of course, Mr. Shamir will go to Washington," said 
Avi Pazner, Shamir's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Pazner described Bush's latest comment on the possible meeting as 
"non-committal" but the Israeli media said Shamir's staff appeared surprised by 
the cool tone. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to feel that a meeting would be held and that it would be 
constructive, that we'd have something positive to talk about," Bush said at a 
news conference Tuesday.

Americans and Soviets have at least one thing in common -- many don't know much 
geography and show "an astonishing lack of awareness of the world around them," 
a Gallup poll showed today. 
</P>
<P>
In the first survey of geographic knowledge conducted in the Soviet Union, 
young Soviets scored significantly higher than their American counterparts but 
didn't do well when contrasted with adults of all age groups in the 10 nations 
where the test was given. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Soviets between ages 18 and 24 correctly identified an average of 
9.3 of 16 locations on a world map, ranking fourth along with Canadians and 
Italians. Young American adults came in last, with an average of 6.9 correct.

Pepsico, eager to boost sales in France to catch up with dominant rival 
Coca-Cola Co., will consider buying Perrier's soft drinks subsidiary if the 
price comes down, a senior Pepsi official said today. 
</P>
<P>
Perrier, the French mineral water group, said Tuesday that it was selling its 
soft drinks unit, which makes the popular Pschitt sodas, for between $272 
million and $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The acquisition of Perrier's soft drinks unit is one among a list of options 
for our activities in France," said Stuart Haugen, Pepsi's general manager for 
France and Belgium. "Other acquisitions, joint ventures and investment to boost 
our own Pepsi brands are also a possibility," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said another possible buyer for the Perrier unit is Britain's 
Cadbury-Schweppes. 
</P>
<P>
Perrier put its soft drinks unit up for sale one day after Pepsi said it would 
end its franchise relationship with Perrier at the end of next year, citing 
poor sales.

PRESIDENT SIGNS BILL RAISING DEBT CEILING;

ECONOMY: GOVERNMENT AVOIDS A FINANCIAL CRISIS. TREASURY RESUMES AUCTIONS OF 
SECURITIES PUT ON HOLD.

<P>
President Bush today signed a bill raising the government's borrowing limit to 
$3.1 trillion, averting a government financial crisis and allowing the Treasury 
to immediately resume borrowing to replenish its empty coffers. 
</P>
<P>
Congress approved the legislation raising the national debt ceiling Tuesday 
night. The bill allows the government to avoid a default on paying its bills. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Department, with the higher limit in place, reacted promptly after 
Bush signed the bill. An auction of $16 billion in three-month and six-month 
bills, originally scheduled for Monday but reset for later today, will permit 
the government to redeem the $13.8 billion in Treasury bills that mature on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The bill's passage also sets the stage for pressurized confrontations between 
the Democratic-controlled Congress and Bush on a range of issues, such as how 
to stem the tide of red ink that has led to the nation's huge debt burden. 
</P>
<P>
"It provides momentum," said House Budget Committee Chairman Leon E. Panetta 
(D-Monterey). Lawmakers will focus on wrapping up some long-contentious issues 
because "there really is a chance to conclude the Congress before 
Thanksgiving," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate, by voice vote, and then the House, by 269 to 99, sent the debt bill 
to Bush Tuesday night. The measure increases the borrowing limit by $300 
billion to finance government operations well into 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such highly touted efforts as the Gramm-Rudman law, government spending 
continues to outpace revenue, recently at a rate of $150 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Treasury has been forced to borrow more and more money to 
finance government spending that exceeds tax receipts. The new statutory debt 
ceiling, an increase from the $2.8 trillion already borrowed, is more than 
three times what it was at the beginning of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The tripling of the national debt since the beginning of the decade is due to 
the huge budget deficits of the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury had said that unless allowed to issue new debt this week, the 
government would have been unable to pay its debts on Thursday. It would have 
been the first-ever default by the U.S. government, a calamity for the world 
financial markets and America's prestige. 
</P>
<P>
The debt bill was passed following days of complex negotiations between the two 
parties on Capitol Hill and the President's representatives. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the talks, divisive issues such as Bush's capital gains tax cut 
and a move to repeal the Medicare catastrophic illness law were kept off the 
debt bill rather than risk default. 
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. government has never defaulted on its debt, it came close on 
several occasions. 
</P>
<P>
For example, it had to dip into Social Security funds to keep its line of 
credit open in 1985. And in 1983, a delay in increasing the debt limit forced 
the government to exhaust its line of credit, leading to a suspension of 
savings bond sales, restrictions on deposits to the Social Security funds and 
cancellation of scheduled securities auctions.

Taiwan will not bow to international pressure to ban the use of drift nets by 
its fishing fleet, the government's top official in charge of fisheries said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot ban the practice outright as it would affect the livelihood of many 
fishermen," said J. C. Lee, acting director of the Fisheries Department. 
</P>
<P>
Taiwan, which Lee said is home to about 260 drift-net fishing boats, has been 
accused by the United States and South Pacific nations of wreaking ecological 
havoc in the Pacific by using the so-called "wall-of-death" nets. They are also 
used by Japanese and South Korean fishing boats.

lawsuit against Paramount Pictures Corp.

In the $5-million suit, set for trial in state court next month, Buchwald

called "King for a Day" that the columnist came up with in 1983. 
</P>

Both stories involve African princes who come to the United States and fall in

Polio, rheumatic fever, hepatitis, an appendectomy, pneumonia, scarlet fever.

"And spinal meningitis," the actor said. "I died. . . . "

A reporter chuckled. Sutherland looked perturbed.

"Yes. I died. For four or five seconds," he said.

<P>
Sutherland overcame the bout of meningitis and says his experience with disease 
since childhood left him with a deep appreciation of the medical profession. 
</P>
<P>
He is the 1989 honorary fund-raising chairman of the Montreal Children's 
Hospital, which hopes to raise $1 million this year to pay for renovations and 
new equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Sutherland said concern for his five children makes him especially sympathetic

Actress Michelle Greene said she was able to get producer Steven Bochco to make 
her "L.A. Law" character independent and more attractive because Bochco is a 
"feminist at heart." 
</P>
<P>
Greene plays lawyer Abby Perkins in the NBC series.

The actress, in an interview for the Nov. 11 issue of TV Guide magazine, said 
she decided to talk to the show's producers about her character after the first 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Abby was "never seen doing anything involving the law," Greene said. "She was 
this mousy creature to whom all kinds of dreadful things kept happening. She 
had an alcoholic husband, she got beaten up, her child was kidnaped, she had a 
messy divorce." 
</P>
<P>
Greene said she confronted the producers, saying, "I guess every show has to 
have the obligatory female victim in it, but I don't want to play the victim 
any more. I don't want to spend all my time crying on camera."

LIZ SMITH: 'THE SCHWARZENSHRIVER' AND OTHER EXPECTATIONS

THAT GRAND actress Sigourney Weaver and her director-hubby, Jim Simpson, are 
expecting their first child in the early spring. They have been married for 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
Down in D.C., the "Charlotte's Web" gossip column of the Washington Star says 
Kelly McGillis, acting with the Folger Library repertory company, and her 
businessman-husband, are also expecting for their very first time. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has never been a daddy before, expects any minute 
via Maria Shriver of NBC and the Kennedy family. Arnold now refers to his 
coming heir as "The Schwarzenshriver!" 
</P>

HAVE A FLASH -- one of the world's best-known, most prolific novelists says he 
is going to hang up his typewriter after he finishes his current one, "The 
Piranhas," for Simon &amp; Schuster. This will mark the 20th work of fiction to 
come from Harold Robbins, who wrote such best sellers as "A Stone for Danny 
Fisher," "Where Love Has Gone" and "The Carpetbaggers." 
</P>
<P>
THEY ARE trooping up the gangplank to get aboard the good ship "National" with 
captains Frank Deford and Peter Price at the helm. The lures these publishers 
are holding must be wonderful ones indeed. The gang now includes the New York 
Daily News' star Mike Lupica, the New York Times' Peter Alfano, the Washington 
Post's John Feinstein, the L.A. Times' Scott Ostler. And get this -- when The 
National daily sports newspaper bows in January, they'll have a gossip 
columnist. Smith grad Kim Cunningham, formerly of World Tennis and US magazine, 
will write a column called "Eagle's Eye."

IT HAS taken Freddie Fields five years to bring his crowning glory, a movie 
titled "Glory," to the big screen. This epic tribute to the first all-black 
fighting regiment in U.S. history, the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, 
has been a labor of love. Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington and Morgan 
Freeman are the marvelous stars of this story of how blacks helped turn the 
tide for the Union Army in the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
Fields has already distinguished himself in many areas of entertainment. He 
founded one of the world's biggest talent agencies, CMA, now ICM. He was 
production chief at MGM/UA. He has managed the careers and presented such stars 
as Judy Garland and her ilk. I'll be rooting for Freddie when "Glory" bows on 
Dec. 10 at the Ziegfeld in New York for the American Film Institute.

I NEVER cease being amazed at how articulate and witty Sylvester Stallone is 
when most people think he goes around yelling "Yo!" In the new M mag, Stallone 
says this about image vs. reality: "I entered this business as an actor, not as 
an icon, not as a rough-and-tumble guy, right-wing, jingoistic, sociopathic -- 
that's not me. I'm subject to the whims and perceptions of a fictional 
character. I am a verbal person and 'Rambo' is an Elizabethan dumb show, almost 
a mime. It isn't as if I'm in the gutter drinking Woolite, but it has jaded and 
distorted the image of who I am."

A construction company has joined 10 other contractors suing "Miami Vice" star 
Don Johnson for allegedly failing to pay bills for work on the mountain 
hideaway where he married actress Melanie Griffith. The lawsuit filed Friday by 
Duddy-Viele Construction of Vail said Johnson owed $95,813 from the $604,085 
bill. It asked for an order that the bill be paid before other liens on the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Ten contractors who helped remodel the home filed liens over unpaid bills 
during the spring and summer, according to the lawsuit filed in Pitkin County 
District Court. 
</P>
<P>
Notification of the lien was sent to Johnson in Miami and at the Vail address 
where he and Griffith were married a second time on June 26.

EAST GERMANY ADMITS THAT 14 ATHLETES TESTED POSITIVE FOR DRUG USE

<P>
East Germany, thrusting its new policy of openness into the sports arena, 
admitted today for the first time that some of its athletes had been exposed in 
dope tests as drug-takers. 
</P>
<P>
Reporting on an unprecedented visit to East Germany's Kreischa doping 
laboratory near Dresden, newspapers said 14 positive results were returned by 
unnamed East German athletes last year in testing at domestic events or in spot 
checks during training. 
</P>
<P>
The report contrasted with outraged denials five months ago, when a defector 
alleged that top stars were routinely using drugs to enhance their performance. 
</P>
<P>
There was no implication today of widespread drug use, but it was the first 
time East Germany had publicly conceded that any of its athletes had been 
caught using drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The admission came as East Germany's media opened up as never before to tackle 
previously taboo subjects. 
</P>
<P>
Junge Welt, the youth daily, said the East German sports federation will 
reverse its policy next year and name offenders as part of a drive to promote 
drug-free sport. 
</P>
<P>
Kreischa, for years off limits even to East German reporters, is one of 19 labs 
around the world approved by the International Olympic Committee, although it 
tends to concentrate on testing its own nationals. 
</P>
<P>
Figures in Junge Welt showed that Kreischa conducted 4,463 tests last year, 
one-tenth of the world total, and that there were 19 positive results, 14 of 
them East Germans. 
</P>
<P>
It gave no figures for previous years. Kreischa has been operating for the IOC 
since 1980 and has 15 employees. 
</P>
<P>
Top sports journalist Volker Kluge, who has hinted previously at doping cases 
but never in the East German media, said officials had previously preferred to 
punish offenders quietly rather than disgrace them publicly. 
</P>
<P>
"Admittedly there was nothing to be found in our press about those 14 doping 
cases in 1988," he wrote.

VOTERS SAY NO TO NEW GIANTS STADIUM; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: THE TEAM WILL PLAY AT CANDLESTICK NEXT YEAR. BUT THEY MAKE NO 
COMMITMENT TO PLAY THERE IN 1991.

<TEXT>
<P>
Giants owner Bob Lurie said the team will play in Candlestick Park next year, 
but he was uncertain where the National League champs will play in 1991 as a 
result of voters saying no to a new baseball stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Candlestick Park cannot stand as a long-term home to the Giants. I can say 
we'll stay at Candlestick next year, as planned. But after that, I cannot say," 
said Lurie. 
</P>
<P>
City voters in Tuesday's election narrowly rejected a measure for construction 
of a new $115-million waterfront ballpark in the China Basin section of San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"There are hundreds of thousands of fans who are deeply disappointed by the 
outcome," said Lurie. "The Giants and their fans now face an uncertain future." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Art Agnos and Lurie conceded defeat of Proposition P five hours after the 
polls closed, although it was mathematically possible then that it could still 
win. 
</P>
<P>
The no votes totaled 86,592 and the yes votes 84,618 -- a 50.5%-49.4% edge. 
There were between 2,000 and 3,000 absentee ballots still to be counted. That 
count will be made today, election officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Those votes are not enough to make a difference," Agnos said. "There are a lot 
of questions about what's next. I don't know, and I'm not even going to think 
about it tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Lurie has vowed for several years that he would move the team to another city 
rather than continue playing at Candlestick. He had an option to move the 
franchise as early as next season, assuming he got the approval of other 
National League team owners. 
</P>
<P>
Another proposition on Tuesday's ballot, calling for the city to consider 
improvements at Candlestick to accommodate the Giants, passed by a narrow 
margin. But Lurie has expressed no interest in such possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Candlestick Park, the team's home since 1960, would still be used by the San 
Francisco 49ers of the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants' Candlestick lease runs through the 1994 season. The Board of 
Supervisors last month granted Lurie an option to get out of the lease at the 
end of this year, however, if the stadium measure failed. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Agnos' endorsement, Proposition P suffered a major blow in the wake of 
the Oct. 17 earthquake. The campaign for the new park was all but dropped while 
residents dealt with the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters said the measure would keep the Giants in San Francisco and give an 
economic boost to the largely industrial China Basin neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Candlestick, known for its cold, chilly winds and poor access roads, holds 
60,000 fans for baseball and slightly more for football.

TENNIS MATCH PRIZE TOO RICH, W. GERMANS SAY

<P>
West German tennis authorities have refused to sanction a proposed $6-million 
season-ending men's tournament, saying the massive prize money being offered is 
bad for the game. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued today, the West German Tennis Federation's board of 
directors and regional committees said they had decided "neither to approve nor 
sanction" the so-called Grand Slam Cup, which the International Tennis 
Federation wants to stage in that country in December, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
International federation spokesman Ian Barnes said that without approval from 
the local German authorities, "it would be very difficult" to stage the event 
there. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, directors of six West German tournaments on the 1990 ATP Tour 
calendar said they are joining the national governing body in denouncing the 
eight-man Grand Slam Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"The winner's first prize of $2 million endangers the long-term stability and 
above all the general image of tennis as a sport," the statement said.

BUDD RETURNS TO BRITAIN, WON'T COMPETE AT INTERNATIONAL LEVEL

Zola Budd returned to Britain today for the first time since fleeing to South 
Africa at the point of anti-apartheid protests and said it is good to be back 
under much different circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
She also said she could never run for Britain again because of political 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see myself competing at the international level again, and certainly 
not for Britain," Budd said. "The political situation and pressure involved 
would make it impossible for me to even think of running for Britain again. It 
would be out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
"The political situation is changing in South Africa, but I think it will be a 
long time before it affects sport." 
</P>
<P>
Budd, described as an emotional wreck when she left her suburban home for her 
native Bloemfontein in May, 1988, looked relaxed and cheerful as she arrived to 
promote her autobiography, "Zola." 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to come back without feeling under pressure," Budd said.

CANTERBURY DOWNS BIDDER PULLS OUT OF THE RUNNING

<P>
The leading potential buyer for Canterbury Downs race track has dropped his 
bid, saying his new job will prevent him from pursuing the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have the time or the patience," said Lawrence Greenberg, the retired 
accountant who has been negotiating a purchase of 61% of the track's stock for 
three months. He is the new president of Northgate Computer Systems. 
</P>
<P>
But one of his partners in the bid for the Shakopee track, Delaware North 
Companies Inc. of Buffalo, N.Y., continues to pursue the deal. Delaware North, 
which is seeking to buy Canterbury Downs' $43 million in bank debt at a reduced 
price, would become its new majority owner if the company can strike a deal. 
The Buffalo firm owns sports franchises and concession operations. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg was first allied with banker Carl Pohlad, owner of the Minnesota 
Twins, whose sons would have bought the bank debt and become the track's 
lenders. But when the Pohlads became leery of the track's continuing losses, 
Delaware North replaced them. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations remain stalled with the track's banks, said Sam Gifford, a 
Delaware North vice president. The most recent offer that has been revealed was 
$8 million in cash plus a share of the track's future cash flow.

GUN STUNS BETTORS AT BRITISH TRACKS; 
</P>

HORSE RACING: OFFICIALS ON LOOKOUT FOR SCI-FI WEAPON THAT MAY HAVE BEEN USED TO 
DISABLE A HORSE IN MIDSTRIDE.

<P>
A cartoon in the Times of London showed a woman walking up to a betting window 
and telling the ticket seller: "Ten pounds to win on any horse that's deaf." 
</P>
<P>
The Jockey Club doesn't think it's funny, and that's why Britain's race tracks 
are on the lookout for the ultrasonic stunner, a sci-fi contraption that may be 
capable of affecting horse races from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
The Jockey Club, which oversees horse racing in the United Kingdom, told the 
Racecourse Assn. today to come up with ways of stopping the stun gun, detailed 
in a London drug conspiracy trial. 
</P>
<P>
"It is recognized that there is the possibility it could upset horses during a 
race," a club statement said. Anyone found with such a device at a track will 
be prosecuted, the club said. 
</P>
<P>
The statement represented a turnaround for the club and the latest development 
in a week of bizarre events touching both the soul and the wallets of a nation 
dedicated to fair play and deeply in love with horse racing and betting on the 
races. Almost 10,000 Britons attend horse racing each day, and about 5,200 
races are run each year, according to Jockey Club figures. 
</P>
<P>
The gun, which looks like a pair of binoculars but hides a high-powered 
ultrasonic transmitter, allegedly was used to stun Ile de Chypre as the horse 
was racing toward victory in last year's King George V Stakes at Royal Ascot. 
</P>
<P>
Ile de Chypre finished ninth in the Breeders' Cup Turf at Gulfstream Park last 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Greville Starkey, the jockey who last year was thrown from Ile de Chypre, says 
tests show the gun works. The Jockey Club, which initially expressed its 
doubts, said Starkey's remarks made it think again. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed prudent to ask race courses to look at the ramifications of this 
device, despite there being no independent evidence available," David Pipe, the 
club's spokesman, said. 
</P>
<P>
The club, in a statement to the nation's 59 flat and steeplechase courses, said 
it still wanted to conduct its own tests to see how the gun worked. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it said, security should be stepped up and plans drawn to combat the 
high-pitched intrusion, which witnesses have said cannot be heard by humans but 
sounds like a firecracker going off in a horse's ear. 
</P>
<P>
"Consequently, the stewards have asked the Racecourse Assn. to consider the 
security implications and to recommend any necessary additions to the Jockey 
Club general instructions," the club said. "In the meantime, security 
arrangements remain the responsibility of racecourses after consultation with 
the local police." 
</P>
<P>
All of this concern stems from a drug trial involving three London area men 
that drew scant attention until a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
James Laming, one of the defendants, testified that he developed the gun to fix 
races or, as it is known here, to "nobble horses." 
</P>
<P>
Describing himself as not a genius but an ingenious man, Laming testified that 
he invented the gun with some basic knowledge in electronics and help from the 
Encyclopaedia Britannica. Containing a 22-watt amplifier and miniature 
loudspeakers, the ultrasonic gun, which looks like the front of a jet engine, 
can direct a high-pitched blast directly into a horse's ear, the court was 
told. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors charge that the gun was financed by $16,000 from a cocaine 
distribution racket. Laming and his co-defendants admit developing the gun with 
the intention of fixing races but deny the drug charge. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants also say they only used the gun once, on Ile de Chypre, and did 
not bet on that race. Laming said he was caught before he had a chance to use 
the gun again.

QUARTER HORSE DERBY TRIALS TO RUN TONIGHT;

Two divisions of the Southern California Derby Trials will be run at Los 
Alamitos Race Course tonight to determine the 10 finalists for the Nov. 18 
final of the quarter horse meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Derby will be run on the closing night along with the 
$200,000 Champion of Champions. The Southern California Derby is restricted to 
3-year-olds and is run over 440 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The first trial is the seventh race. The field (in post position and jockey's 
names): Challenger Seven, Roman Figueroa; Doctor Dobbs, Ron Carrasco; Rich 
Tactic, Juan Limon; California Dash, Kip Didericksen; City Band, Danny Cardoza; 
Making Merri, Joe Meier, and Rambac, John Creager. 
</P>
<P>
Rambac is expected to be the favorite, having won four of five starts this year 
including the Golden State and El Primero Del Ano Derbies at Los Alamitos. In 
his last start, a ninth-place finish in the Pilgrim Handicap, he turned his 
head at the break. 
</P>
<P>
Rambac is owned by David J. Payne of Salt Lake City and is trained by Connie 
Hall. Creager is the gelding's regular rider. The horse has earned $485,625 and 
has won 11 of 21 career starts. 
</P>
<P>
Challenger Seven, a Dash for Cash Derby finalist, should be his toughest 
competition. He is trained by Charles Bloomquist and has won one of his 11 
starts this year. He was fourth in the PCRA Derby Sept. 8 at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
The second division is the eighth race. The field: The Big Kahuna, Scott White; 
Lil Rebel Cash, Figueroa; Secret Meeting, Didericksen; Mary Bobbitt, Eddie 
Garcia; Final Flurry, Henry Garcia; Shillings, James Brooks; Floozie Finder, 
Kenny Hart, and Heres Happiness, Jim Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Shillings is one of the favorites in that race, having won the Paul Ford 
Memorial Handicap on Oct. 13. Shillings, however, is an 870-yard specialist 
with three wins, a second and third at that distance. She is a half-sister to 
champions Calyx and Florentine and is trained by Russell Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Floozie Finder was a close second in the PCRA Derby but has since had trouble. 
He was fifth in a division of the California Sires Cup Derby and was third in a 
$7,000 allowance race. 
</P>
<P>
Final Flurry was third in the Pilgrim Handicap on Oct. 21 behind Mito Native.

WOLFSHEIMER, BERNHARDT S.D. COUNCIL VICTORS

<TEXT>
<P>
In a dramatic victory for environmentalists that will reshape the San Diego 
City Council's philosophical balance, Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer retained 
her seat Tuesday while land-use planner Linda Bernhardt unseated Councilman Ed 
Struiksma in the city's first district-only elections since early this century. 
</P>
<P>
Breaking conservatives' longtime dominance of the council and shifting power to 
a pro-environmental majority, Wolfsheimer narrowly defeated former county 
supervisorial aide Bob Trettin in the 1st District, while her former City Hall 
aide, Bernhardt, trounced Struiksma by a convincing 3-to-2 ratio in the 5th 
District contest. 
</P>
<P>
The victories by Wolfsheimer and Bernhardt, both of whom drew strong backing 
from environmental groups as they faced opponents closely linked to the 
development industry, completed the ideological transformation of the council 
begun in last September's primary by John Hartley's upset of Councilwoman 
Gloria McColl. 
</P>
<P>
Struiksma's and McColl's defeat, combined with Wolfsheimer's narrow victory, 
also vividly demonstrated incumbents' diminished political security, as the 
city's first district-only races since the City Charter was approved in 1931 
produced the bleakest electoral performance by sitting council members in more 
than a decade. Before Tuesday, only one other council incumbent -- Trettin's 
former boss, Bill Mitchell -- had lost a reelection campaign in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"The No. 1 thing that won this election -- and none of us should ever forget it 
-- is the people of the neighborhoods," Bernhardt said. "District elections 
finally gives the power back to the people." 
</P>
<P>
Conceding the defeat that even many of his closest backers regarded as 
inevitable after his dismal primary performance, Struiksma said: "When I get up 
in the morning, I'm going to be able to look myself in the mirror and know I 
did a good job for the people of the city of San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
The opening chapter in Tuesday's election was written last November, when San 
Diego voters narrowly approved a ballot proposition replacing the city's 
two-tiered electoral format -- district primaries followed by citywide runoffs 
between the top two vote-getters -- with district-only contests. 
</P>
<P>
The move transformed the way the San Diego City Council had been elected for 
the past half century. It prompted candidates to rethink traditional 
strategies, added weight to neighborhood-oriented issues, affected fund-raising 
and left other indelible marks on the campaigns for the four council seats at 
stake this year. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond allowing candidates to win outright in the primary -- as Councilwoman 
Judy McCarty did against token opposition and as Hartley did by upsetting 
McColl -- the other major structural change imposed by passage of Proposition E 
is that runoffs now are confined to districts. By virtue of the runoffs' 
smaller geographic area, challengers are better able to neutralize incumbents' 
financial and name-recognition advantages -- which often proved insurmountable 
in citywide races -- through their own door-to-door politicking and grass-roots 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor that made this fall's election especially compelling was its 
potential to alter the council's philosophical balance on growth-management and 
other sensitive issues. 
</P>
<P>
With Hartley's 3rd District upset setting the stage, the runoff campaign began 
with the knowledge that victories by Wolfsheimer and Bernhardt, both of whom 
were endorsed by the Sierra Club, would create a solid managed-growth majority 
on a council that in recent years has been dominated by a conservative "Gang of 
Five." A Struiksma-Trettin tandem win, meanwhile, would preserve the 
conservative coalition's domination, while a split between the environmental 
and pro-development camps would leave the council nearly evenly balanced. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1st District race, Wolfsheimer -- viewing her pro-environmental record 
as her strongest asset in her northern San Diego district -- sought to keep the 
campaign dialogue focused on the politically volatile growth issue. The 
district stretches along the coast from La Jolla to North City West, extending 
inland to Rancho Bernardo and the San Pasqual Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Dismissing her opponent as "Bulldozer Bob" because of his strong financial 
backing from development interests, the 50-year-old former law professor often 
told campaign audiences that her election would help create a "limited-growth 
coalition that will put the needs of the people . . . before the desires of 
take-a-buck, make-a-buck and pass-the-buck." 
</P>
<P>
Unwilling to, in his words, "wear the black hat" on the growth issue, the 
35-year-old Trettin portrayed himself as "every bit the managed-growth 
candidate (Wolfsheimer) is." 
</P>
<P>
Though developers supplied a sizable part of the $211,851 that he had received 
in campaign donations as of Oct. 21, "contributors don't dictate how you vote," 
Trettin said. Most of the money that Wolfsheimer spent came from her own 
pocket, as she loaned $250,000 to her campaign -- more than three-fourths of 
her overall $315,684 contributions total. 
</P>
<P>
A former aide to county Supervisor Susan Golding and, before that, to 
Councilman Bill Mitchell, who was unseated by Wolfsheimer in 1985, Trettin 
stressed in his standard stump speech that the district's population grew by 
35% during the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
"If this is what Abbe calls growth management, the district and the city can't 
stand four more years of it," Trettin said. 
</P>
<P>
The 5th District contest, meanwhile, saw Struiksma attempt to turn the election 
more into a referendum on Bernhardt than a judgment on his own eight-year 
record -- a strategy born of necessity after his disappointing second-place 
finish behind her in the five-candidate primary, 39% to 33%. Bordered on the 
south by Mission Valley, the district extends from Linda Vista north to Mira 
Mesa, passing through Kearny Mesa and Serra Mesa as it reaches east to Scripps 
Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the lukewarm public reception to his "Getting Things Done" slogan, 
Struiksma recognized that his best -- perhaps only -- hope of reversing the 
primary's outcome was to spend more time in the runoff trying to persuade 
voters not to vote for Bernhardt than explaining why they should vote for his 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Describing Bernhardt as "a major question mark" beyond her pro-environmental 
slant, Struiksma criticized the former Wolfsheimer aide as "an inexperienced 
single-issue candidate . . . who would like to keep the questions unanswered 
until after the election" -- a charge he supported by pointing to her refusal 
to attend several debates. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to raise questions about Bernhardt's character, Struiksma, a 
42-year-old former police officer, also accused her of defaulting on a $4,955 
student loan in New Jersey. Though Bernhardt admitted missing several payments, 
she denied ever technically being in default. 
</P>
<P>
Terming Struiksma's attacks an effort to divert attention "away from his own 
build-at-any-cost record," Bernhardt argued that her election would "help 
preserve the open space that's left after eight years of Ed Struiksma." 
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing her diametrically opposed viewpoint, Bernhardt suggested a number 
of growth-control measures throughout the campaign, highlighted by a proposed 
ban on development along the Interstate 15 corridor until traffic is reduced 
and other related problems are alleviated.
