Need a reason to smile? 
</P>
<P>
Just think: No more political commercials! 
</P>
<P>
Election-night glamour was in particularly short supply at the Democrats' local 
command base, the Biltmore Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The highest-ranking candidate to visit, attorney general hopeful Arlo Smith, 
left at 8 p.m. Hollywood types were also scarce, though Smith was collared in 
the lobby by a rap singer who crooned the following ditty: 
</P>
<P>
The A to the R to the L to the O. 
</P>
<P>
 I went to the polls and voted like so. 
</P>
<P>
 The man on the ballot, well don't ya know. 
</P>
<P>
 For attorney general, his name was Ar-lo. 
</P>
<P>
 So I'm gonna make a rap and it goes like so: 
</P>
<P>
 I love this tie, it's burgundy. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, the rapper put his arm around the startled, 63-year-old Smith 
and lifted his tie. The singer gave his name as Casanova Ace and said he was 
originally of New York but now of Paramount (the city, not the studio). 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, mention of an Arlo Smith rap song reminds us that the Doo Dah Parade 
is approaching. And KCOP (Channel 13) is terming itself the only TV station 
"with the guts to bring it to you." The 15th edition of the zany procession 
will be televised live for the first time on Nov. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Doo Dah czar Peter Apanel's strategy is obvious. With turnouts growing so large 
in recent years, Apanel -- in the contrary tradition of the Rose Parade parody 
-- has begun pleading with people not to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, he even recorded a message on his telephone that said: "You 
can't find a place to park. It won't be any fun. It's gonna be too crowded." 
Several alarmed people phoned the city, thinking it had been canceled, and 
Apanel was chewed out by Pasadena police. 
</P>
<P>
So now he's adopted a new ruse. His hope: People will stay home and catch it on 
TV. 
</P>
<P>
And here's an event that sounds like a Doo-Dah joke: 
</P>
<P>
The L.A. Business Council will host a speech today at noon on "The Outlook for 
Real Estate in the 1990s," given by real estate agent Mike Glickman. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the same Mike Glickman whose lavish operation collapsed earlier this year, 
forcing him to file for bankruptcy. Perhaps some of his 157 creditors will want 
to listen to his pearls of wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
miscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
The lot behind 71-year-old Musso &amp; Frank Grill in Hollywood is believed to 
be the oldest continuously open parking operation in the city.

CALIFORNIA: A NEW STATE FOR GOV. WILSON; 
</P>
<P>
A CHORUS OF 'NO'S' AND TERM LIMITS WILL TEST HIS SKILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We welcome Gov.-elect Wilson to the winner's circle with the wish that he is 
able to savor the victory. It was a win so close that it may have surprised 
him. And ahead there are plenty of other surprises waiting for him, few that 
even resemble pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
At least the new governor will not have to eat any campaign words about the 
budget. Neither Wilson nor Democrat Dianne Feinstein promised to do much of 
anything, if elected, that would cost a lot. Nor did either make the mistake 
President Bush made in accepting his party's nomination with a "read my lips" 
promise not to raise taxes. But the state's financial shape, the loss of 
crucial bond issues and the reality of even a mild recession may leave very 
little leeway for action. 
</P>
<P>
FUTURE SHOCK: Sometime between now and Wilson's first few minutes in his new 
office, he will be briefed on the state's financial condition. If the briefing 
is soon, he will learn that he must start drafting his first budget $2 billion 
in the hole. The longer it takes to brief him, the bigger the deficit may get. 
</P>
<P>
The deficit is running high for the same reason that many bond issues were 
rejected by California voters. Unemployment is creeping up in the state and 
housing prices are creeping down. There is, if not a recession, at least enough 
hints of one to make people hesitate to borrow for themselves, let alone the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's caution may be just the ticket for some problems. Economic forecasts 
still say California will outperform the nation as a whole, but a cautious 
approach would lead to careful analysis of the most pressing needs; it also 
would help in shifting state funds around to match the needs. Then, too, money 
will not be the most pressing aspect of the next phase of programs to protect 
California's environment. In these, imagination and diligence can make the 
difference. There's no shortage of diligence, but the governor-elect needs to 
show far more imagination than he did during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
SACRAMENTO SHOCK: Despite predictions that Tuesday would unleash the politics 
of rage and revenge for poor public service, California voters punished the 
state Legislature by a relatively mild 52-48 vote in favor of Proposition 140. 
But a majority wins, and the resulting chaos in the Legislature over 140 may 
make Sacramento's financial troubles seem a welcome diversion for the governor. 
</P>
<P>
In the first year after every federal census, the Legislature has the task of 
drawing new district boundaries for Congress and the state Senate and the 
Assembly. That duty always distracts Sacramento, but this year the distraction 
will rise to near frenzy for the Assembly, whose members will be limited to 
three terms totaling six years, and the Senate, whose members will be limited 
to two terms totaling eight years. The constitutionality of Proposition 140 
will no doubt be challenged in court, but that could merely string out the 
uncertainty for state politicians -- not to mention stringing out the voters 
who assumed that what they voted for would actually take effect. 
</P>
<P>
PROPOSITION SHOCK: National commentators searching for the deep meaning of the 
voters' rejection of 12 of 14 statewide bond issues would be right to cite the 
growing economic uncertainty, a general lack of confidence in an expanding 
government and a legacy from the Proposition 13 era. 
</P>
<P>
But they would be wrong to ignore the daunting complexity of the state ballot. 
It's the wrong way to conduct governmental business and the voters recognized 
it. In no little measure the chorus of "no's" was a vote against complexity. 
Irritation with the long ballot no doubt contributed to the crushing defeat of 
Proposition 128 ("Big Green"). Commentators can complain about the negativism, 
but anyone who braved into the voting booth Tuesday won't find it hard to 
understand.

MAINSTREAMING HANDICAPPED SCHOOLCHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While Sarah Englelmen fights for the right of her daughter to participate in 
"mainstream" education, two families in Hawaii are suing so their children will 
have the benefits of special education. 
</P>
<P>
As an educator, I am frustrated with the single-minded solutions that are 
pushed on school systems whenever the pendulum swings. 
</P>
<P>
The trend now is to mainstream. I support this trend if schools are allowed to 
prepare for this change and if parents of handicapped children are given an 
option. 
</P>
<P>
If mainstreaming is our goal and we want to provide quality education for all 
students, we would be wise to reduce the class size to a sensible 15 students. 
Mainstreaming might have a chance if we have small classes and prepared 
teachers. If we mainstream all students with special needs into the system we 
have now, everyone will lose.

REAGAN STATE BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I can't believe it! "State Dedicates Reagan Office Building," I read. 
</P>
<P>
A President who exited office leaving an ungodly mess: a trillion-dollar-plus 
national deficit, the savings and loan $500-billion-plus disaster, Irangate; a 
man who threw hundreds of thousands of mentally ill into the streets virtually 
single-handedly, who rewarded ultra-rich individuals and corporations with 
generous "trickle-down" tax breaks that caused the record-breaking deficit, 
etc. 
</P>
<P>
I challenge anyone to name a single thing Reagan did while in office that 
benefited anyone but the rich and the powerful. Trickle down indeed! Surely the 
gods must be shaking their heads sadly at these misguided stupid mortals who 
reward misgovernment.

ETHNICITY IN AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "For the Last Time, Darn It, I Am Not a Mail-Order Bride" 
(Campus Correspondents, Opinion, Oct. 21): 
</P>
<P>
I am sadly disappointed and repulsed to see such an article written by 
"American " Anne Kim. 
</P>
<P>
I am a senior at Birmingham High School. 
</P>
<P>
I, along with my parents and sister, emigrated to the United States from Taiwan 
when I was 4 years old. Like the author, I have been raised with a "a messy mix 
of MTV and McDonald's." However, when fellow Americans tease me about being 
"fresh off the boat," I promptly correct them. I am proud of my Chinese culture 
and defend it at all times. I do not believe that anybody should be subjected 
to this type of criticism. My advice to the author: Instead of trying so 
desperately to conceal your Korean ancestry and taking pride in mispronouncing 
your Korean middle name, take a good look around you. Why are you trying to 
identify with the very people who stereotype you? Think about it.

REAGAN STATE BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a governor and President who spent his entire 16 years in public office 
denigrating civil servants and extolling the virtues of the private sector, it 
seems totally inconsistent that the new Los Angeles state building, which will 
house 2,500 state employees, should be named in honor of Ronald Reagan (Oct. 
27). 
</P>
<P>
Only Gov. George Deukmejian, who shares Reagan's philosophies, could be 
sufficiently insensitive to participate in such a sham. A savings and loan or a 
Defense Department building, perhaps; but a state official building? Never!

LOCAL: GETTING MOVING ON TRANSIT; 
</P>
<P>
DESPITE ALL THE FISCAL CONSERVATISM, TWO CRUCIAL SALES-TAX MEASURES DO WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California voters, seeking relief from their worsening commuting woes, 
look to have passed two local measures, which will mean paying a little more in 
sales tax inorder to fund a regional mass transit system. The long-term 
benefits from investing in the badly needed transit system will mean less 
traffic congestion and air pollution foreveryone. 
</P>
<P>
The sole holdouts were voters in Ventura, who rejected a measure that would 
have funded the county's share of a rail transit project. That was 
shortsighted. Ventura County residents and commuters could avoid facing future 
traffic nightmares, at less cost, by working on the transit project now. 
</P>
<P>
Measure C in Los Angeles County and Measure M in Orange County would put the 
financial infrastructure in place to build a regional transit system, which 
will eventually stretch over a six-county area. The $400 million to be raised 
annually by the half-cent sales tax hike in Los Angeles County will mean three 
rail commuter lines -- from Santa Clarita, Moorpark and San Bernardino, all 
going to downtown Los Angeles -- will be in place within two years. 
</P>
<P>
The transit tax translates into tangible benefits. It will provide the Los 
Angeles County Transportation Commission with the money to buy locomotives and 
cars and to build stations. Now the light-rail Blue Line, which runs from Long 
Beach to downtown Los Angeles, will be extended to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Orange County, voters finally approved -- after three tries -- 
Measure M, a half-cent sales tax for transportation projects. M also provides 
the necessary funds to buy and develop the rights of way to rail lines that 
will connect Los Angeles and Orange counties. That will provide the critical 
link in commuter rail service from the south. 
</P>
<P>
The measures in Los Angeles and Orange counties are important to the Inland 
Empire, too. Riverside, which passed a transit sales tax in 1988, and San 
Bernardino, which did so in 1989, have funds to plug into the transit system. 
San Diego, which also has a transit tax, connects via Amtrak trains. Ventura 
now is the only one of the six counties which lacks resources. That means the 
rail line that is to run from downtown Los Angeles to Moorpark in Ventura may 
stop short, at the border between the two counties. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura should take a cue from its more urban neighbors: Sitting in traffic is 
no fun -- and is a lot more costly than a slight increase in the sales tax.

NATION: A MANDATE FOR GRIDLOCK? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The election was as significant for what it did not do as for what it did. 
</P>
<P>
Here's what didn't happen: Until recently, the Republicans believed that they 
might ride the coattails of an historically popular President to historic 
midterm gains. That didn't occur. Until recently, Democrats believed they could 
ride public distaste for the budget fiasco to a midterm landslide. Obviously, 
that didn't happen, either. The Democrats managed an historically unexceptional 
gain of one seat in the Senate and nine in the House. And three of the party's 
leading presidential hopefuls -- New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, New Jersey Sen. 
Bill Bradley and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt -- received only slim 
majorities. 
</P>
<P>
Here's what did happen: President Bush suffered a series of defeats. Four of 
the GOP candidates for whom he campaigned hardest -- Florida's Bob Martinez, 
Texas' Clayton W. Williams Jr., Minnesota's Rudy Boschwitz and Hawaii's 
Patricia Saiki -- lost. Of course, the President also campaigned for Pete 
Wilson and Jesse Helms. However, Wilson, who voted against the bipartisan 
budget agreement, made a point of distancing himself from Bush on the question 
of higher taxes; Helms went on to exploit the President's veto of the Civil 
Rights Act to help legitimize his overtly racist campaign against black 
Democrat Harvey Gantt, thereby converting one of Bush's few successes into an 
embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
The consequences of all this are likely to exacerbate Washington's governmental 
gridlock. The Democrats have an unshakeable legislative majority, but cannot do 
as much as they would like with it because of Bush's extraordinarily successful 
use of the veto. Since taking office, the President has vetoed 15 bills. 
Traditionally, about one-third of all presidential vetoes are overridden; Bush 
has been sustained every time. Administration officials say privately that 
Tuesday's results probably mean Bush will make even greater use of the veto in 
the two years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats hoped to pick up enough new seats to end the President's 
"government by veto." They did not. Now their strategists say they will attempt 
to capitalize on Bush's perceived weakness and win over enough GOP 
congressional moderates to override at least some vetoes. To do that, they will 
have to attack Bush's personal conduct of his presidency -- as the Republicans 
did during the Carter Administration. Remember that a failing presidency tempts 
a lot of people to free lance. 
</P>
<P>
There you have it: an angry electorate, an immobile Congress, an uncertain 
President. An alchemy capable of transmuting them into effective government 
would require either statesmanship or a miracle -- and in the current political 
context that may be a distinction without a difference.

To Arnold Schwarzenegger, it was barbaric that U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia were 
using buckets of sand as weight training equipment. Being a man of action, he 
terminated the practice, ordering a total recall on all buckets of sand. 
</P>
<P>
Reuters reported Tuesday that the bodybuilder-turned-movie star, who also is 
chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, led a 
campaign that persuaded sporting goods manufacturers to donate more than 
100,000 pounds of free weights, bench boards, leg presses, cycle machines and 
treadmills.

Trivia time: Which major league player had exactly 3,000 hits? 
</P>
<P>
Five-minute drill: Jim Shofner, the new Cleveland Browns' coach, is 0-0, and he 
will keep that record intact this weekend. The Browns have a bye. 
</P>
<P>
His first practice Wednesday lasted under two hours. He will hold another 
workout today, then give the team four days off. 
</P>
<P>
Shofner's short-practice philosophy extends to meeting time as well. He told 
Chuck Melvin of the Associated Press: "The whole emphasis is that we get in 
here, do our business and get out. Hopefully, our attention span will be 
better. For me, you can only sit and pay attention about five minutes." 
</P>
<P>
The Browns' fans would agree.

Demographics expert: Philippe Chatrier, president of the International Tennis 
Federation and the French Tennis Federation, told Salvatore Zanca of AP that he 
is still concerned about the controversy ignited by Andre Agassi, who appeared 
in last year's French Open wearing neon-colored shirts and denim shorts. 
</P>
<P>
Said Chatrier: "It's not especially the clothes. What bothers me most about 
Agassi is the long hair and the bleaching (of his hair) and the fact he doesn't 
shave and the earring. It's his general look." 
</P>
<P>
Chatrier added: "I've received many complaint letters from people more than 50 
years old who disagreed with Agassi's outfits. But the ones less than 30 seem 
to love his outfits." 
</P>
<P>
Faster than Franco: If it were up to Raghib (Rocket) Ismail, the Notre Dame 
running back and kick returner extraordinaire, he'd skip the draft and go 
directly to the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
Ismail, who moved to Wilkes-Barre, Pa., when he was 10, told the Pittsburgh 
Press: "When I played sandlot, whatever position I was playing, I was (a 
Steeler). If I was a linebacker, I was (Jack) Lambert or (Jack) Ham. If I was a 
receiver, I was (Lynn) Swann or (John) Stallworth. If I was playing 
quarterback, I was Terry Bradshaw. And if I was a defensive back, I would be 
Mel Blount." 
</P>
<P>
Pass it on: Wednesday, according to AP, the Cincinnati Post reported that Pete 
Rose has sold his home in Cincinnati and is selling a home in Plant City, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also reported that Charlotte Jacobs, a family friend, said Rose's 
wife, Carol, visited him twice a month at the federal prison in Marion, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jacobs: "He's doing good. He looks good. He is skinnier." 
</P>
<P>
Who goofed, indeed: The "correction" in Wednesday's Morning Briefing that said 
Bob Goodrich, not Gail Goodrich, was captain of USC's 1938-39 basketball team, 
was an error. Please do not mark a change in your 1990-91 USC Basketball Media 
Guide.

'RED OCTOBER' HUNTS 'PRETTY WOMAN'

"Pretty Woman," in its second week atop the Billboard rental chart, is already 
under attack from an able new challenger, "The Hunt for Red October." One of 
the year's strongest rental titles, "Red October" could climb to at least No. 2 
next week -- or maybe even splash "Pretty Woman" out of the top spot. 
</P>
<P>
And where did "Q&amp;A" get all this rental appeal? It barreled up to No. 4 in 
just two weeks. Starring Nick Nolte and Timothy Hutton, this violent cop drama 
did just modest box-office business (gross: $10.5 million). "Miami Blues," an 
offbeat thriller, debuted at No. 29. Though not a real box-office hit, look for 
this to do well in the rental market largely because it stars "Red October's" 
Alec Baldwin. 
</P>
<P>
* Priced at $22.95, this animated adventure, based on the '60s TV series, 
should be popular in the sales market throughout the holiday season. The 
movie's box-office run, which generated a mild $17.6 million, was just to whet 
the appetites of youngsters for the video. "Jetsons" debuted at No. 27 but 
isn't expected to do huge rental-market business.

Pope John Paul II appointed a prelate who has condemned the Irish Republican 
Army as evil to be the new spiritual leader of the 4 million Catholics on both 
sides of the Irish border. Archbishop Cahal Daly's denunciation of the IRA and 
pursuit of reconciliation between Ireland's so-called "two traditions" were 
believed major factors in his choice as archbishop of Armagh and primate of All 
Ireland.

COMPUTER FILE: 2 PROGRAMS GIVE ON-SCREEN DATA A REALISTIC LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD O'REILLY, RICHARD O'REILLY is director of computer analysis for The 
Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The graphical powers of Microsoft's Windows 3.0 bring its users a new dimension 
in software in which what you see on the screen is just about what you'll see 
when you print. 
</P>
<P>
That change is especially dramatic in word processing, where users of IBM and 
compatible computers, unlike their Macintosh counterparts, usually have seen 
plain, text-only renditions of documents. The type on the screen always looks 
the same whether or not various sizes and styles of type are called for in the 
printed document. 
</P>
<P>
The two powerhouse word-processing programs for Windows 3.0 are Microsoft's 
Word for Windows, $450, and Samna Corp.'s Ami Professional, $495. 
</P>
<P>
Word for Windows is geared toward high productivity of office word processing, 
from simple memos to complex legal briefs. Its power comes from a set of 
automated templates that cause data to be placed just right in your document. 
For instance, filling in just a few blanks in the legal brief template will 
cause the entire top of the brief to be properly formatted with names of 
plaintiffs and defendants, case number and type of action. 
</P>
<P>
Ami Professional lacks the automation features but lets you draw objects in 
your documents with geometric shapes and create charts as well, neither of 
which are features offered in Word for Windows. It also allows some 
modification of imported graphic images, such as scanned-in pictures, which 
makes the program akin to desktop publishing. 
</P>
<P>
Both programs have all the features of traditional word processing software, 
such as spelling dictionaries, thesaurus, automatic creation of tables of 
contents and indexes, outlining, foot-noting and text annotation. 
</P>
<P>
The latter is a feature that lets a document be locked as-is and then 
circulated among whomever needs to approve it. Each reader can note his or her 
own comments, which can then be incorporated in the final version if desired. 
</P>
<P>
Each program also allows you to create tables within a document. The tables can 
be a mix of text and numbers, and basic math can be performed to add, subtract, 
multiply and divide groups of data. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, for heavy-duty number crunching, you would rely on spreadsheet 
software, and both programs can link to spreadsheet files. 
</P>
<P>
The way text looks on your screen and on paper is controlled in both programs 
by "style" sheets that can define all the variables from margins to the size 
and style of the type. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing the same type on screen as you will see on paper is not always 
beneficial. None of the screen fonts are as clear and crisp as the standard 
text character set that comes on IBM and compatible computers. Thus, the 
letters you see on the screen tend to be thinner than what you see with a 
traditional text-based word-processing program such as WordPerfect or WordStar. 
</P>
<P>
However, for general office word processing these programs can be a real boon. 
For instance, if you don't need fancy embossed stationery or letterheads 
printed in some color other than black, you can use either Ami Professional or 
Word for Windows to print the letterhead at the same time it prints the text on 
the letterhead. 
</P>
<P>
For many users, either program would be satisfactory. Both are quite powerful 
and thus quite complex. Learning how to use all the features is a major 
undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the way each program looks on the screen and the choices of items 
listed in their menus can differ according to the user's wishes. That also 
means it is easy to get lost, especially in the early days of use when you 
can't find the menu choice you want because it isn't in the lists you are 
using. 
</P>
<P>
Ami Professional gets the nod for users who need to draw objects in their 
documents, such as simple organizational charts, or to call attention to 
certain paragraphs of text. The same is true for those who need charts, 
although it is easy enough to import an Excel chart into Word for Windows. Word 
is the more powerful of the two. 
</P>
<P>
The templates included with the program are amazing in the way they can 
simplify creation of complex documents. I would think that law offices in 
particular would benefit. But the templates aren't of use until you have 
modified them to reflect your own needs -- unless of course you work for the 
law offices of Fellowes, Warner, Galen &amp; Thompson in Portland or the Trey 
Film Co., which are the names on many of the templates supplied.

DOW FALLS 44.31 ON WAR FEARS, ELECTION UPSETS

Rising war fears combined with disappointment over a big U.S. Treasury bond 
sale and the election results sent the stock market reeling and knocked the Dow 
Jones industrial index down 44.31 to 2,440.84. 
</P>
<P>
The war worries, which lifted crude oil futures for December $2.68 a barrel in 
New York, rose as British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher declared that Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein faces war soon unless he withdraws from Kuwait. The 
warning mingled with wide speculation that a war is more likely now that the 
U.S. elections are over. 
</P>
<P>
"The talk got oil prices running, and that spilled over quickly into our 
market," said Kenneth Ducey, head of institutional trading at S. G. Warburg 
&amp; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a modest 149.13 million shares, 
compared to 141.13 million on Tuesday. Losing issues outnumbered gainers by 
1,134 to 444, with 441 stocks unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
As the Dow fell 1.8%, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index also fell 1.8%, 
or 5.61 points, to 306.01. The NASDAQ composite index of over-the-counter 
stocks slipped 3.73 to 336.80, a 1.1% loss. 
</P>
<P>
The $2.68-a-barrel spike in the December oil contract brought the contract's 
closing New York Mercantile Exchange price to $35.31. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the fear of Persian Gulf hostilities was the primary force in the 
market, but there was also unhappiness with waning investor interest in the 
U.S. Treasury bond sale. The auction of $34.25 billion in government securities 
began Tuesday and runs through today. 
</P>
<P>
"The auction was not a disaster, but a bit of a disappointment," said Michael 
Metz, market strategist for Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York. He said much of 
the market's optimism about an easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve 
had faded by the end of the session. 
</P>
<P>
The markets also heard several rumors, among them a report that the Western 
allies planned to strike Iraq soon to prevent the country from completing 
construction of a nuclear weapon later this month, Metz said. 
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation for some weeks that the Administration would not 
launch an attack on Iraq before the elections, lest it be accused of trying to 
manipulate the election results, said Chris Pedersen, director of trading at 
Twenty First Securities in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Pedersen said the election results were also a negative for the market, because 
many on Wall Street had hoped that the defeat of a large number of incumbents 
would show Congress that it needed to become more serious about reducing the 
deficit. Instead, 96% of House incumbents were reelected, and all but one 
senator. 
</P>
<P>
Pedersen said the market was also driven by a technical factor. At the close of 
Tuesday's trading, the value of the S&amp;P index fell below its 50-day moving 
average, which, he said, "re-established a downward trend." 
</P>
<P>
Market technicians were also watching a sudden reversal in the Dow utility 
index, he said, noting that some market analysts consider utility prices a 
leading indicator for other averages. Utilities had been gaining in recent 
weeks, but dropped sharply in the past three sessions. Wednesday, the Dow 
utility index fell 1.9% to 209.07. 
</P>
<P>
Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* All of the 30 stocks in the Dow industrial index fell except McDonald's, 
which was flat at 26 3/8. Among big losers, International Paper fell 1 1/2 to 
46 1/2, GE lost 1 3/8 to 52, and Alcoa gave up 1 1/4 to 51 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
* Many financial stocks weakened anew. Insurance stocks were particularly hard 
hit. Santa Monica-based Fremont General plunged 2 to 12 5/8 after a 
disappointing profit report. USF&amp;G fell 5/8 to 11 5/8 after slashing its 
dividend 66%. Other weak insurance stocks included Chubb, down 1 3/8 to 44 5/8, 
and Kemper, off 1 1/4 to 17 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Investors dumped pollution control stocks after Browing Ferris' report of 
dismal quarterly earnings Tuesday. Browning fell another 2 1/2 to 21 3/4 after 
falling 6 on Tuesday. Other losers Wednesday included Waste Management, down 1 
1/2 to 31 1/2, Zurn Industries, off 2 to 30, and Chemical Waste, off 1 1/8 to 
19. 
</P>
<P>
* CBS traded as high as 162 but settled back to close up 1/2 at 158 5/8. 
Speculation mounted about the potential sale of the late founder William S. 
Paley's 8% stake by his heirs. But analysts said Laurence A. Tisch's 25% CBS 
stake makes the disposition of Paley's shares irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
* Circuit City lost 7/8 to 10 3/8 after falling 2 7/8 on Tuesday on a negative 
October sales report. 
</P>
<P>
* Cereal stocks continued to fall on worries about possible product price wars. 
General Mills slumped 2 1/8 to 84 3/8, Kellogg lost 5/8 to 68 1/4, and Ralston 
fell 2 5/8 to 94. 
</P>
<P>
* Oil stocks were hard hit, despite rising crude prices. Mobil lost 2 1/4 to 57 
3/8, Chevron fell 1 1/2 to 67 3/8, Louisiana Land tumbled 2 3/8 to 48 5/8 and 
Unocal fell 1 1/8 to 29 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Pasadena-based Jacobs Engineering gained 1 1/8 to 20 3/4 on a strong earnings 
report. 
</P>
<P>
In Germany, shares dropped 1.9% in thin, nervous trading. It was the seventh 
session in the last nine that the market has declined as traders worried about 
the Mideast. The 30-share DAX index fell 27.09 points to 1,371.15. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices closed lower on London's Stock Exchange. The Financial Times 
100-share index was down 10.6 points at 2,059.2. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stocks closed lower as rumors of war in the Gulf and scandal 
depressed a market already slumping on lower oil prices and a weaker yen. The 
key 225-share Nikkei index fell 465.50 points or 1.9% to 23,500.25. Early 
today, the Nikkei lost another 441.26 points, nearing the 23,000 mark. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT: Mideast Anxiety Hurts Bond Prices 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell sharply Wednesday as a successful auction of 10-year Treasury 
notes was overshadowed by renewed fears of war in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The government's bellwether 30-year bond fell 19/32, or about $5.94 per $1,000 
in face value. Its yield surged to 8.69% from 8.63% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 7.675%, down from 7.688% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY: Dollar Slips Against Mark, Gains on Yen 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell against the German mark, hitting a record low on speculation 
that the Federal Reserve Board may lower interest rates again. 
</P>
<P>
But Mideast war concerns boosted the currency later in the session, and the 
dollar rose against the Japanese yen, which was hurt by rising oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar finished at 1.4874 marks, down from 1.4927 at Tuesday's close, but 
above a historic New York low of 1.4785 set earlier in the session. The dollar 
finished at 128.73 Japanese yen, above Tuesday's close of 128.20 yen. 
</P>
<P>
The British pound rose to $1.9690 in New York from $1.9657 late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES: Gold, Silver Head in Opposite Directions 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures slipped and silver futures rallied modestly on New York's 
Commodity Exchange in lackluster trading. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, soybeans rebounded, grains were mixed and livestock 
and meat futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Platinum fell sharply on the New York Merc, though, erasing most of the gains 
posted in the two previous sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Gold finished 20 to 30 cents lower, with December at $387.90 an ounce, and 
silver was 2.9 to 3 cents higher, with December at $4.287.

"A peacock takes its perch upon the county hall -- 
</P>
<P>
 A sign that freedom comes to many folk in thrall. 
</P>
<P>
 Let the proud, frail peacock, whose feathers daze the sun, 
</P>
<P>
 Proclaim that tomorrow here all will be undone. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomorrow all will change, be changed at last. New eyes 
</P>
<P>
 In new battles will turn with laughter to the skies. 
</P>
<P>
 New winds will make laments in the old Magyar trees, 
</P>
<P>
 While we await, await new Magyar mysteries. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hungarian poet Endre Ady, (1877-1919) 
</P>
<P>
In October of last year, Hungary began to shed its communist skin and transform 
itself on the model of Western democracy. The events of the past 12 months have 
put the country to a test, as its citizens, and especially its artists, 
confront the luxuries and pressures of expanded freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
The test is not a new one, however, for the Eastern European nation has had a 
long history of bitter occupations and brutal invasions. 
</P>
<P>
Today's times could be compared, for example, to the period after the signing 
of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise in 1867, when Hungary was granted internal 
autonomy for the first time in nearly 200 years. With the yoke of the 
Austrian-ruled Hapsburg monarchy loosened, Hungary entered a new era, with a 
new energy. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Hungarians had the chance to rekindle the long-suppressed flame of 
their native culture. "New forges and new fires, new faiths, new holy men," the 
poet Ady wrote, addressing the Magyar people, who had occupied the Carpathian 
basin for a thousand years. "Either you'll come to life, or be nothing again." 
</P>
<P>
Hungarian culture did come back to life, at least until the World War I sank 
the country into yet another abyss. Voluminous evidence of this renaissance can 
be seen in the exhibition "A Golden Age: Art and Society in Hungary 1896-1914," 
opening Saturday at the San Diego Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 paintings, drawings, photographs, sculptures, ceramic objects and 
architectural designs are included in the show, a somewhat smaller version of 
the exhibition originally staged in Budapest several years ago. The Barbican 
Art Gallery in London organized the current show's tour to England and the U.S. 
with the Hungarian Ministry of Culture, the Hungarian National Gallery and the 
Center for the Fine Arts in Miami. San Diego is the final stop on the show's 
four-city tour. 
</P>
<P>
The confluence of forces that came together in late 19th-Century Hungary is 
what makes the period fascinating, according to Robert Frankel, former director 
of Miami's Center for the Fine Arts, and now director of the Chrysler Museum in 
Norfolk, where the exhibition was last seen. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a time when Hungarians were looking for and discovering a national 
tradition and identity. At the same time, they were becoming more aware of 
things happening everywhere else." The art, architecture and design from those 
years, Frankel explained by telephone from Norfolk, "reflect that searching, 
that exploration." 
</P>
<P>
In their search for a distinct national identity, Hungarians peeled back layers 
of foreign influence to revive their own traditional folk art and design. 
During the long Hapsburg rule, native Hungarian culture was supplanted by art 
and architectural styles derived from Austria. As pressure from Austria waned 
after the Compromise, Hungarians began to rehabilitate what they saw as the 
pure, unspoiled art of their forebears, and to integrate it into newer, more 
modern forms of expression. Motifs from 
</P>
<P>
embroidered felt coats worn by Hungarian shepherds, for instance, reappeared as 
decorative patterns in Art Nouveau architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Paintings in the "Golden Age" show reach beyond Hungary's native folk art to 
touch on familiar aspects of Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, Art Nouveau, 
Symbolism, Realism and Romanticism. There is little stylistic unity, but, 
according to Frankel and the show's informative catalogue, a consistently 
strong drive toward independence underlies every artist's work. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary, like most European nations, spent the late 19th and early 20th 
centuries pursuing artistic options outside the rigors and rewards of the 
official academy, an institution which had long trained artists in traditional 
styles and held a monopoly on launching their careers. Modernism and its 
rebellion against authority seduced Hungarian artists, but the pull of 
patriotism was just as strong. This friction between rejection of the past and 
respect for native tradition drew sparks, many and varied. 
</P>
<P>
On one hand there were the urbane psychological portraits of Jozsef 
Rippl-Ronai, on the other the pastoral idylls of Karoly Ferenczy. The nostalgic 
fantasies of Janos Vaszary represented one way to pay tribute to the past, the 
rustic, folk-art-inspired crafts of the Godollo colony reflected another. 
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the shadow of Vienna, whose fin de siecle culture was among the 
world's richest and most sophisticated, posed a perennial challenge to 
Hungarian artists. Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele and Oskar Kokoschka were among 
the many turn-of-the-century Viennese to carve secure niches in the art 
historical canon. In Hungary, however, even the period's biggest names "don't 
slip off the tongue," admits the Barbican Gallery's John Hoole, chief organizer 
of the "Golden Age" show. 
</P>
<P>
When Hoole saw the original exhibition in Budapest, the work was new and 
unfamiliar to him, as it remains to most audiences outside of Hungary. But, he 
discovered, the situation was not that different within Hungary itself. 
</P>
<P>
"The subject was even new to the Hungarians," he said by telephone from London. 
"It was as though they were rediscovering their past. The exhibition came about 
with the thaw that subsequently spread throughout the rest of Eastern Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly one hundred years after the Austro-Hungarian Compromise, the country is 
once again undergoing a rebirth of freedoms. Among the positive effects is a 
new enthusiasm for sharing Hungary's cultural wealth with the rest of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"We were welcomed" San Diego Museum of Art director Steven Brezzo said of the 
Hungarian response to organizers of the British and American touring 
exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
"The motives were different than they had been in the past. Before, the 
emphasis was monetary, the interest was in getting hard currency. Now, they've 
become more interested in the significance of the cultural material."

FLAMENCO TROUPE TO PROVIDE A TASTE OF THE REAL THING

<TEXT>
<P>
Of all the ethnic expressions seen on San Diego stages, flamenco dance is 
arguably the most elusive, despite the city's strong cultural ties to Spain. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't understand it," Rosa Montoya said from her San Francisco home. "I know 
you have a big Hispanic community, and you're so close to Mexico. But most 
people in San Diego don't really know what flamenco is. They may have seen it 
in a nightclub, but they haven't seen good, authentic flamenco. There's much 
more flamenco in San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
Montoya, niece of the master flamenco guitarist Carlos Montoya, and her Rosa 
Montoya Bailes Flamencos have been performing throughout the Bay Area since she 
started the group in 1974. This Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. at the Spreckels 
Theatre, her 12-member troupe of dancers, singers and guitarists will make its 
San Diego debut, under the banner of the San Diego foundation for the 
Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to give a variety of what flamenco is -- different themes," said 
Montoya, a native of Spain. "We'll have a classical Spanish number, a love 
drama from Garcia Lorca (the Spanish poet) and something from the Cafe de 
Chinitas (a classic turn-of-the-century Andalusian cafe). I want people to know 
what real flamenco dance is like." 
</P>
<P>
Real flamenco is earthy and flamboyant, characterized by powerful heel beats 
that pound the floor with the speed and force of a machine-gun volley. It 
features curving, up-swung arms, beautifully expressive hands and rigidly 
arched backs. Flamenco exudes an undercurrent of passion, but that emotion is 
never allowed to simmer too close to the surface. Dancers stalk their partners 
in a stylized battle of the sexes, or strut proudly in solo in response to the 
relentless urgings of the strumming guitars and wailing chants. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend's program will draw on old-style traditions culled from Spanish 
Gypsies, 19th-Century zarzuela operetta and Moorish influences, but some of the 
choreography is contemporary. A common element is woven through all the 
dancing, however. 
</P>
<P>
"You need a complement of singers and guitarists to give more flavor to the 
dancing," Montoya said, "and you have to have good clapping to make it 
exciting. The dancers need this." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego-based Charo Monge is one of two vocalists in Montoya's troupe. She 
helps the dancers ignite the smoldering fires of flamenco through throaty 
chants. 
</P>
<P>
"Flamenco is sort of like jazz," she said. "If you have a clear voice, it 
doesn't work. You have to have a complete disregard for the vocal chords. But, 
if the dancers understand the lyrics, the singing makes a very important 
statement. It sets the mood for the dance, depending on whether the lyrics are 
happy, sad or joking." 
</P>
<P>
Monge is a singer in her own right and performs at clubs and concerts when time 
allows, but, she acknowledges, "I don't enjoy it. The dancer is what makes me 
really sing. I get the emotions from them, and, as a singer, I can push the 
dancers. You don't rely just on choreography. There's a lot of improvisation, 
where you can each express yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Monge said that, when Montoya is dancing, she is challenged to greater heights 
by the vocalists' impassioned chants and the emotion-charged music. 
</P>
<P>
"She breaks all the rules, and by the end of the night you have to practically 
carry her away," Monge said. "She gives in totally to her art. That's why I'll 
do anything to work with her. She's very exciting to watch." 
</P>
<P>
As a release from that excitement and tension, the company will culminate this 
weekend's concert with a comic work, called a buleria. 
</P>
<P>
"We do it as a release, but comedy is really one of the most difficult things 
to do," Monge said. "It's also the most fun."

EXOTIC PERSIMMON GROWS IN POPULARITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KITTY MORSE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No fruit better signals the start of the holiday season than the exotic 
persimmon, known for centuries to Asian consumers as the fuyu. The North 
County's increasing Pacific Rim population has fueled the demand for the 
orange, satiny-skinned fruit, which is fast becoming a familiar item in local 
supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
In this country, the best-known variety of persimmon is the hachiya, which 
looks a little like a large orange acorn thanks to its pronounced conical 
shape. This particular persimmon, however, must be left to soften before it is 
consumed, unlike the oku gosho or giro, which can be eaten out-of-hand like an 
apple. 
</P>
<P>
Although many local consumers have discovered persimmons only in the last few 
years, Jim Bathgate grew up in a persimmon grove in San Juan Capistrano. "I've 
been familiar with the fruit all my life," said Bathgate, a former engineer, 
who has written articles on fuyu, and authored the "Fuyu Primer," a booklet 
published by the California Fuyu Growers Assn. Last year, Bathgate's orchard of 
800 trees in Valley Center yielded approximately 80,000 pounds of persimmons. 
</P>
<P>
"The fruit is definitely becoming more popular," he said, "but the general 
public still has to be educated about fuyu." Bathgate and his wife, Lee, were 
founding members of the California Fuyu Growers Assn., which tries to educate 
consumers to the myriad uses of the persimmon. 
</P>
<P>
Bathgate grows mainly oku gosho, the most popular in North County, and 
"probably the original strain that came from Japan," he said. Giro, a persimmon 
that is usually seedless, also grows well in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the problems for fuyu growers is that some of the original rootstocks 
were mislabeled," said Bathgate. "For example, the California fuyu was named by 
foreign growers who came to California looking for nonastringent strains of 
fruit. They noticed when they returned to their native countries that the 
persimmons didn't taste the same as the original Japanese varieties. They then 
referred to ours as the California fuyu." 
</P>
<P>
The distinction, he adds, was made barely two years ago, since the techniques 
to differentiate among the various strains are still being refined. Bathgate is 
experimenting with an original persimmon tree that came from his family's back 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to turn back the clock to try and propagate an original variety," 
he said. "The giant nonastringent persimmon is attractive in size and 
sweetness, and a great back-yard fruit tree," said Bathgate, "but it has a 
limited shelf-life, which makes it difficult to market." 
</P>
<P>
"People who try fuyus for the first time often make the mistake of thinking all 
varieties are alike," said Sally Sanderson of Rancho Willow Creek in Valley 
Center. "I learned about fuyu persimmons by taking care of our 8-year-old 
grove," said Sanderson, who is a board member of the state fuyu association. 
When fall arrives at Rancho Willow Creek, the persimmons' lush green foliage 
turns a red tone, much like maple trees. Leaves fall, and the deciduous trees 
"look just like sticks for about three months," Sanderson said. In season, 
however, clusters of shiny persimmons weigh down the limbs, many of them held 
up with stakes. Like some other fruits, the fuyu are ripening early this year 
because of the drought. 
</P>
<P>
"When my oku goshos are ripe, I often have to chase away coyotes, and crows, 
not to mention my dogs from eating persimmons," she said with a laugh. "They 
love to feast on the ripe fruit!" 
</P>
<P>
Lindy Arms became aware of fuyu as a wholesale produce buyer in Los Angeles. "I 
can remember when fuyus were in short supply," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Arms planted 300 giro trees in Fallbrook eight years ago. He choosea flat, 
four-sided, seedless variety. "Fuyu are far superior to apples as a snack," he 
said. "They're easier to digest, very crisp and crunchy when ready, and not 
overly sweet. It's a fruit kids love, and there's no waste since it has no 
core." 
</P>
<P>
Keep all persimmons in a cool, dry place, at room temperature. If refrigerated, 
they must be used immediately for cold temperatures hasten the ripening 
process. Do not keep fuyu close to other fruit because that will also hasten 
ripening. 
</P>
<P>
Hachiya are ripe when soft and fully orange, and they will continue to ripen at 
room temperature for about three weeks after they're picked. Many home growers, 
unfamiliar with the Hachiya's tendency to sweeten as it softens, often pick the 
fruit too early. The giro and oku gosho can be eaten out-of-hand. 
</P>
<P>
Persimmons are a good source of Vitamin A, potassium and calcium. Oku gosho and 
giro add crunch to fruit salads, "just like apples in a Waldorf salad," said 
Arms, while the hachiya are best for puddings and cakes. Dried fuyu are also 
growing in popularity.

GROUP OFFERS AID, ENCOURAGEMENT FOR STRUGGLING WRITERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK STENCEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The group gathered in an Escondido living room on a Monday evening, set their 
chairs in a circle and talked earnestly about their habit for several hours. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a group for smokers, alcoholics, nonstop eaters or gamblers. This 
is the North County Writers Workshop, a 6-month-old group of about 15 
compulsive scribes and would-be authors who, despite folders full of rejection 
letters, polish and rewrite their work in pursuit of an elusive, literary 
nirvana: publication. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very lonely occupation. . . . I get very involved in it," said Dan 
Regan, a 40-year-old travel agent from San Marcos who writes short stories and 
mystery novels. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting with other writers to talk about what they do helps keep him going, 
Regan said. "People are there for that little push over to the next time." 
</P>
<P>
The workshop group, which grew out of a National University writing seminar 
last May, meets every two weeks in a different member's living room to critique 
each other's stories, novels, poems and articles. 
</P>
<P>
Most find the other member's suggestions helpful, group leader Rita Favreau 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't take everybody's suggestions and incorporate them into your work, 
(but) they help each other refine their writing to make it publishable," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Favreau says the members also provide the encouragement writers need to stick 
with what can be a lonely and frustrating pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
"If you end up getting 20 rejection notices, you need a little pat on the back 
to keep you going," she said. "What I leave with is a sort of excitement to 
write. . . . You get ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Favreau also belongs to a San Diego writers workshop and says she established 
the North County group because she was tired of having to commute for 
criticism. But she also says she finds the critique sessions so helpful that 
she still goes to both groups' meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The North County group is fairly new and therefore open to anyone who is 
serious about writing, Favreau says. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all from varied walks of life. . . . I'm real pleased with the dynamics 
of the group," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The members, a majority of whom are women, come from all over North County and 
pay $15 a year, which covers the cost of photocopying and mailing information. 
</P>
<P>
Mystery writer Regan, who has been with the group since it was formed, says the 
feedback he gets on his work at the meetings helps him find strengths and 
weaknesses in his writing that he might not see if he was editing himself. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Regan says, he is a glutton for honesty. His only concern is that some 
members are afraid their fellow writers will take the comments and suggestions 
personally. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them tend to not be critical enough . . . but the group is coming to 
that point," Regan said. "There needs to be both sides of it." 
</P>
<P>
Regan says he also learns from hearing what works and what doesn't work in the 
other members' writing. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're reading best-sellers all the time, you're only hearing the good 
stuff. You're not hearing the mistakes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The members of the group are all very different. Some write fiction, others 
write nonfiction. Some write poems, others write prose. 
</P>
<P>
But Teresa Dearholt, 32, of Oceanside says she thinks the diversity is good, 
even when she isn't interested in the type of writing her fellow members are 
producing. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of books in the bookstores that I wouldn't touch with a 
10-foot pole, that I wouldn't pay for or read," she said. "But every story has 
something good about it. Sometimes you have to look for it." 
</P>
<P>
Dearholt, who is buying a used bookstore in Vista, is now working on a romance 
novel. She also writes short stories, children's stories and poems. 
</P>
<P>
"We all want to be published. It's a goal for all of us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And being in the group has given her the confidence to send her writing to 
publishers, she says. "It's made me work harder. It's made me want to write 
more." 
</P>
<P>
Regan, who tries to spend two hours a day writing, says having to sign up to 
read for the group on certain days is a helpful motivator. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes you write. It gives you deadlines, and, if you're writing on your 
own, you don't have those," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Regan says it is surprisingly easy to get hooked, "especially if you're 
having fun with it." 
</P>
<P>
WHAT: The North County Writers Workshop. 
</P>
<P>
WHEN: The first and third Monday of every month at 8 p.m.

WHERE: Different members' homes; call for location.

BEST BET: BELL-BOTTOMS, FONDUE FORKS AND SOUNDS OF 1970 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fondue forks, bell-bottom pants and avant-garde flute music will set the tone 
for a concert in tribute to the year 1970. That transitional year between '60s 
psychedelia and '70s cynicism will be resurrected at 8 p.m. Friday in 
Mandeville Center's Erickson Hall at UC San Diego in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Flutist Laura Koenig and violinist Erik Ulman, both graduate students at the 
university, will perform the avant-garde works of John Cage, Karlheinz 
Stockhausen and Mauricio Kagel. There also will be a medley of other period 
music, including Chicago and the Carpenters. 
</P>
<P>
Ten other musicians will perform, including a pianist, a guitarist, a drummer 
and a trombone player. Lyrics by Jimi Hendrix and Robert Lamm will be read to 
harp music. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the 1970 motif, Koenig says, in the first half of the concert 
she will wear a flower-power gown; in the second half, an "I Am Woman" outfit. 
The men likewise will dress in period garb, including platform shoes and 
bell-bottom pants. 
</P>
<P>
Audience members are encouraged to wear clothing appropriate to 1970 and to 
bring a fondue fork for the "historically correct" reception after the concert. 
</P>
<P>
What: 1970 concert. 
</P>
<P>
When: 8 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Where: Erickson Hall, Mandeville Center, UC San Diego. The hall is in the 
basement of Mandeville Center, in Room B-210. To get to the center, take Gilman 
Drive past the information office and take the first street to the right. 
</P>
<P>
Cost: The concert and reception are free.

DAVID NELSON / ON RESTAURANTS: PLEASING LUNCH ON A MOUNTAINTOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few of this county's restaurateurs attempt to scale the peaks -- far more, of 
course, are content to wallow in the valleys, and these we can ignore at our 
leisure. But the interesting truth is that, for all our mountains, we never 
have had a mountaintop restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The Carmel Mountain Ranch Country Club, whose dining room is open to the 
public, actually does occupy an eminence. The view in all directions extends to 
yet-untrammeled mountains, all of them stony and wild. The drama of the setting 
is lessened somewhat by the ocean of houses that slopes down from the club on 
all sides in regular waves of gray and brownish-umber roofs. The residences, of 
course, supply the raison d'etre for the club, which also offers private golf 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The dining room now serves only lunch and Sunday brunch, although the dinner 
bell probably will be rung as soon as the surrounding population swells 
sufficiently. The lunch menu is quite sufficient for the present. Although 
brief, it is a surprisingly well-considered list that nicely matches the dining 
room, a formal, handsome, high-ceilinged place endowed with huge windows that 
draw in the distant mountains. The service is as gracious as the surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
Chef Douglas Newberry, who served a local stint at The French Gourmet and has 
worked in country club kitchens elsewhere, writes the menu daily. It recently 
opened with a dressy cream of asparagus and continued on with a Caesar salad 
fleshed out with grilled chicken; a second, rather daunting salad of fresh 
fruits with granola and vanilla yogurt; grilled salmon in dill sauce; sauteed 
oysters with mushroom cream sauce and pasta; grilled shrimp in cilantro cream 
sauce and, most atonally, "blackened" chicken breast with roasted red pepper 
sauce. There were several other choices, including the sandwich of the day, in 
this case a vegetable-stuffed round of pita bread spread with avocado and 
herbed cream cheese. 
</P>
<P>
The asparagus cream had an excellent flavor and body, and was likable for its 
classical presentation, which resulted in snipped asparagus tips being added to 
the bowl just before service. This soup is not difficult to prepare, although 
it rarely is done with grace. 
</P>
<P>
The house salad, an a la carte option, was a simple but elegant arrangement of 
Boston and radicchio lettuces with fresh, crisp croutons and a sticky-sweet but 
tasty honey-mustard dressing. There was an old-fashioned "ladies lunch" quality 
to this dressing that jibed with the hats worn at some of the tables. 
</P>
<P>
The entrees this particular day ranged in price from $5.50 (for the fruit 
salad) to $7.25 for a grilled beef tenderloin in brandy and tarragon-flavored 
brown sauce. The portion seemed almost unbelieveably generous at this price, 
which would have meant nothing had the dish disappointed. But Newberry turned 
out a quite credible variation on the standard luncheon tournedos, the meat 
properly cooked and the sauce quite nicely flavored -- tarragon always is happy 
with filet of beef. A melange of sauteed squashes and a hum-drum mound of rice 
pilaf garnished the plate. 
</P>
<P>
The cheese tortellini in a light cream sauce, finished with snipped basil and 
chopped tomato, likewise was virtually shoveled onto the plate. The flavor, 
however, was distorted by the simple fact that, while tomato sauce and cream 
sauce can be successfully blended, raw tomato and cream are not comfortable 
together. The pairing gave the dish an unfinished quality that, oddly enough, 
seemed to echo the skeletal house frames outside the windows. 
</P>
<P>
The dessert tray is catered by an outside supplier and could offer a wider 
selection. The cakes all are on the filling side, and a dish of berries or 
diced mixed fruit would not be amiss.

HAHN HOLDS BACK ON VICTORY CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kenneth P. Hahn apparently won election as Los Angeles County assessor late 
Tuesday night. And Wednesday morning, he laid claim to his own political name. 
</P>
<P>
Many observers attributed Hahn's 51.5% to 48.5% advantage over incumbent John 
Lynch to the name he shares with County Supervisor Kenneth F. Hahn. But Hahn, 
the assessor, said he has heard enough of that. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my name and I'm happy to share it with the other Kenny Hahn," he said 
Wednesday, with a laugh. "I've done this on my own." 
</P>
<P>
Although Hahn celebrated -- and his home phone machine answered "Assessor-elect 
Kenneth Hahn" -- he declined to claim victory outright Wednesday. The 10-year 
veteran of the assessor's office said he thinks his 42,000-vote lead will hold, 
but added he is being cautious because about 100,000 absentee ballots still 
remain to be counted. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch stayed home Wednesday and declined to speak to the press. His spokesman, 
Robert Knowles, said Lynch "expects to make a concession statement today or 
tomorrow. He just feels it wouldn't be prudent to make a statement before the 
absentee ballots are counted." 
</P>
<P>
The county registrar's office said it will not have absentee results until next 
week, at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed, however, that Lynch would be hard pressed to close the 
margin, since a large percentage of voters fail to vote in the assessor race. 
</P>
<P>
While he may have been reluctant to claim victory Wednesday, Hahn, who is not 
related to the county supervisor, acted very much the winner in every other 
way. 
</P>
<P>
After staying up the entire night tracking results, the political neophyte 
received congratulatory calls Wednesday morning and then toured the assessor's 
offices in the County Hall of Administration. He received a hero's welcome, as 
more than 200 employees flooded a hallway to cheer and slap their new boss on 
the back. 
</P>
<P>
Workers said the spontaneous demonstration was a mark of disdain for Lynch, who 
had a reputation for volatility. "Everyone was just extremely happy and 
relieved," said one worker, who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn, 51, also toured city and county offices Wednesday, receiving 
congratulations from Mayor Tom Bradley, Supervisor Ed Edelman, City Controller 
Rick Tuttle and Councilman Richard Alatorre. 
</P>
<P>
It was a heady day for Hahn, who spent most of his career as an appraiser 
specialist answering public complaints at the assessor's Santa Monica office. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 3, he will move from a tiny office cubicle in Santa Monica, with its 
view of a used car lot, to the assessor's expansive executive offices downtown. 
Hahn will leave a job in which he supervises no one and is paid $42,000 yearly, 
to one that controls 1,600 employees and draws a salary of $130,869. 
</P>
<P>
He will oversee the largest property-tax jurisdiction, in land value, in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The enormity of the task is mind-boggling at this time," Hahn said, as his 
victory began to settle in. "But what it needs is a clear head." 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said he is not intimidated by the task and his supporters pointed out that 
he holds a higher rank than Lynch did when he rose from the ranks of the 
assessor's office to the top job in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Observers credited the victory of the then-unknown Lynch to his endorsement by 
tax crusader Howard Jarvis. 
</P>
<P>
The last time around, seeking the office vacated by Assessor Alexander Pope, 
Lynch said he surprised himself by defeating several better known candidates. 
He even managed to beat a Hahn -- Gordon Hahn, the former assemblyman and 
brother of the county supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth P. Hahn may think he has made a name for himself, but the man who 
manages the county's mail is not so sure. Mac McConnell, chief of mail 
services, said he will insist that the assessor use his middle initial to make 
sure his mail reaches his third-floor offices. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he said, it will end up on the eighth-floor offices of the other 
Kenny Hahn.

ANTI-INCUMBENT MOOD BLAMED IN WAKE OF UPSETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unexpectedly strong tide of resentment against incumbents, claims of 
strategic brilliance and admissions of fatal gaffes dominated the day-after 
explanations behind the unseating of one San Diego congressman and two state 
Assembly members in Tuesday's elections. 
</P>
<P>
As campaign consultants, party activists and the candidates themselves 
struggled Wednesday to make sense of the most dramatic political housecleaning 
in San Diego in years, most explanations for the apparent defeat of Democratic 
Rep. Jim Bates and Republican Assembly members Sunny Mojonnier and Jeff Marston 
originated from the belief that the three were victims of a much-predicted 
anti-incumbent mood among the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew there was a sea of discontent -- we just didn't know it was a tidal 
wave," said Karl Higgins, administrative assistant to Rep. Bill Lowery (R-San 
Diego), who narrowly escaped with a 5-percentage-point victory over a 
Democratic challenger whom he had trounced by 2-1 margins in his past two 
reelections. 
</P>
<P>
That sentiment was exacerbated in some of the races, consultants argued, by the 
officeholders' own ethical transgressions, which made them more likely targets 
for voters' wrath against Washington and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Bates and Mojonnier, both tainted by recent disclosures, lost in 
districts where their respective parties hold voter registration advantages so 
overwhelming that partisan elections there normally are races in name only. 
Noting that both had easily triumphed in bruising primaries last June, some 
political consultants argued that their party's failure to nominate an 
alternative to a wounded incumbent produced one of the overriding lessons in 
Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
"The message here is that, if one party doesn't take out its own garbage, the 
other party will," longtime San Diego political consultant Jack Orr said. 
</P>
<P>
With about 43,000 absentee ballots countywide remaining to be counted next 
Tuesday, there is an outside chance that Bates or Marston could reverse their 
982-vote and 1,858-vote deficits, respectively, while Mojonnier's prospects of 
wiping out her 5,821-vote shortfall are dimmer. Officials at the San Diego 
County registrar of voters office said Tuesday it is not known how many 
uncounted absentee ballots remain in each of those districts. 
</P>
<P>
Final unofficial vote totals showed that Republican Randall (Duke) Cunningham 
edged Bates by a razor-thin margin in their 44th Congressional District race, 
46,171 votes (46.1%) to 45,189 votes (45.1%). Two minor-party candidates -- 
Peace and Freedom Party member Donna White and Libertarian John Wallner -- drew 
the remaining 8.8% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
In the 75th Assembly District, Democrat Deirdre (Dede) Alpert blocked 
Mojonnier's try for a fifth two-year term, outpolling the Encinitas Republican 
52,102 votes (45.9%) to 46,281 votes (40.8%), with the other 13.3% of the vote 
going to two minor candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Marston, meanwhile, lost his bid to retain the 78th Assembly 
District seat that he won in a special election last June to the same candidate 
whom he defeated in that race -- former Democratic San Diego City Councilman 
Mike Gotch. Gotch received 37,727 votes (45.7%), Marston drew 35,869 votes 
(43.5%), and two minor candidates attracted a combined 10.8%. 
</P>
<P>
Those losses represent a rarity in San Diego politics. Before Tuesday, the last 
San Diego congressman to be defeated was Democrat Lionel Van Deerlin, who was 
upset by Republican Duncan Hunter in the 1980 Reagan landslide. It had been 
even longer since an incumbent assemblyman from San Diego was unseated, the 
most recent example being Republican E. Richard Barnes' loss to now-Judge Larry 
Kapiloff in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
"This election was the beginning of a revolution that will restore competitive 
democracy to San Diego," said former San Diego Mayor Roger Hedgecock. "What we 
had was a rubber-stamp democracy with 'safe' seats and non-races, and the 
people are finally fed up with it." 
</P>
<P>
Within political circles, the three incumbents' losses, Lowery's scare and the 
surprising results in several other races were widely seen as clear evidence 
that the backlash against incumbents struck with a vengeance here. 
</P>
<P>
Even in several races where incumbents won handily, minor-party candidates, who 
historically draw only several percentage points of the vote, polled 
double-digit totals Tuesday, ranging up to the 28% (38,819 votes) received by 
Libertarian Joe Shea in his 45th Congressional District race against Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to read those strictly as anti-incumbent votes, because most of 
those (minor-party candidates) don't spend a dime or campaign," said Bates 
consultant Rick Taylor. "For whatever reason, voters in San Diego decided it 
was time to tell incumbents, 'Don't take us for granted.' " 
</P>
<P>
Although Marston's 4 1/2-month tenure in Sacramento was dwarfed by Gotch's own 
former eight-year council record, the Democratic challenger went to lengths in 
his mailers to clearly identify Marston as the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
"He kept hammering away at the word incumbent, and that made it very difficult 
for us to get across that I'd been one for only a few months," Marston 
conceded. "When a lot of people heard the word incumbent, that was it." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Bates blames his narrow apparent loss more on "generic 
anti-incumbency" than on voters' specific displeasure with his 1989 sanction by 
the House Ethics Committee on sexual harassment charges lodged by two female 
staff members. Even some of his own supporters, however, acknowledge that the 
controversy weakened Bates' political immunity system, even in a district where 
Democrats hold a 53%-35% registration edge. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in Cunningham, a highly decorated former Navy fighter pilot who 
entered the race with relatively high name recognition and solid financial 
backing from national GOP leaders, Bates faced his most formidable challenger 
since winning the then-newly created seat in 1982. In addition, Bates, an 
indefatigable campaigner noted for door-to-door politicking even in 
non-election years, was severely hampered by being stuck in Washington until 
late October during the budget impasse. 
</P>
<P>
"All of those things . . . offset the tremendous advantages of incumbency," 
said Cunningham, whose upset came in a supposedly "Republican-proof" district. 
</P>
<P>
Alpert overcame similar numerical obstacles in defeating Mojonnier in the 75th 
Assembly District, where the Democratic challenger faced a 52%-33% registration 
disadvantage. But, like Cunningham, Alpert, a Solana Beach school board member, 
was perfectly positioned to capitalize on the embarrassing headlines that 
chronicled Mojonnier's recent years in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Last February, Mojonnier agreed to pay $13,200 in fines and restitution for 
double-billing the state and her campaign committee for business trips, as well 
as for using political donations to pay for fashion and beauty treatments for 
her staff. Along with other state legislators, she also has been faulted for 
routinely using state-paid sergeants-at-arms for personal tasks, such as 
chauffeuring her children and escorting her home after evening parties. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that heavy political baggage, Mojonnier easily survived a 
three-candidate challenge in last June's GOP primary. Alpert believes the June 
victory gave Mojonnier false confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she believed that her real competition was in the primary, and that a 
Democrat just didn't have a chance in this district," said Alpert, who waged a 
vigorous campaign but was heavily outspent by Mojonnier. "Sunny had a lot of 
liabilities, and they finally caught up with her." 
</P>
<P>
Gotch, meanwhile, argues that he might have fooled Marston into underestimating 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Criticized even by some fellow Democrats for his virtual invisibility during 
most of the race, Gotch claimed Wednesday that his so-called "stealth campaign" 
actually was a matter of strategic design -- not, as many thought, reflective 
of his loss of heart after his earlier losses in last spring's special primary 
and runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Gotch said his campaign advisers decided that, if they waged a full-blown, 
nonstop campaign, it would simply prompt Marston to mount a similarly 
high-profile race, thereby raising his name identification. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided to take the hits for the so-called 'stealth campaign,' hoping that 
the other side would take the bait," Gotch said. "And they did." 
</P>
<P>
Marston said he was not deceived by Gotch's low-profile stance, which lasted 
until the final several weeks of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw this very clever strategy for what it was from day one, but couldn't get 
anyone to listen," Marston lamented. "I never believed all this talk about 
Gotch practically throwing in the towel. The problem was, where before people 
had been telling me, 'Jeff, I don't think you have a chance' when I asked for 
contributions, now they were saying, 'Jeff, we don't think you need it because 
you don't have a race.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the closing days of the race, the Republican Assembly caucus in Sacramento 
even withdrew a previous commitment to finance a mailer for Marston -- a 
decision that Marston admitted he was "very, very, very bitter about." When he 
protested, Marston said, Assembly Minority Leader Ross Johnson told him, "We're 
not in the business of financing landslides." 
</P>
<P>
"That was the brilliant decision of the best political minds in Sacramento -- 
just ask them, and they'll tell you," Marston said angrily. "Like they say, 
with allies like that, you don't have to worry about your enemies."

DEFEAT JEOPARDIZES PLANS FOR CAMPUS; 
</P>
<P>
CAL STATE UNIVERSITY: THE REJECTION OF PROP. 143 COULD INDEFINITELY DELAY 
PLANNING OF A FACILITY IN THE COUNTY. MEASURE A'S LOSS PUTS ROAD PROJECTS ON 
HOLD.

<P>
Voters dealt a devastating blow Tuesday to the development of a California 
State University campus in Ventura County and to local transportation funding 
to ease clogged traffic on area highways. 
</P>
<P>
Voters in Ventura County and statewide rejected Proposition 143 to provide $450 
million for building and maintaining new and existing Cal State and University 
of California campuses, throwing into jeopardy the future of a Cal State campus 
in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
County voters also defeated Measure A, which would have increased the sales tax 
one-half cent to raise $500 million over 20 years to improve such traffic 
tangles as the Ventura Freeway's Santa Clara River Bridge, which links Ventura 
and Oxnard; the Saticoy bridge, which crosses the Santa Clara River on 
California 118 through Saticoy; and the intersection of the Ventura Freeway 
with busy Victoria Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State University officials and Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) said 
they believed that the $7 million set aside to buy land for a new campus can be 
retained. But with no new money for capital programs, officials said planning 
and construction of the first phase of an ultimate $300-million campus could be 
delayed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want to predict any opening of a new campus at this point," said 
Cal State Vice Chancellor John M. Smart. Smart said that, if the university 
goes forward with plans to buy a piece of land for a campus, its funds will be 
limited to the $7 million, which will have to cover environmental impact 
reports as well as purchase of the property. 
</P>
<P>
"But I would say the objective is still to acquire a site, so that, if and when 
the state can afford to construct a campus, the site will be there to do it," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a years-long delay for a Ventura campus, Chancellor Ellis E. 
McCune said Cal State may have to halt construction at its new San Marcos 
campus, which was due to open to students in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Hart said he will suggest a special bond election, possibly next year, to 
ensure funding for the university's needs. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County officials predicted that they will have a second chance at 
transportation funding as well, probably in the form of another road-tax 
measure when the economic mood is brighter. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in difficult times right now, and people are uneasy," said county 
Supervisor John K. Flynn, who predicted gridlock in five years without major 
work on area highways. "They're saying they don't want to give any more money 
to government, because they're not sure it has been managed properly." 
</P>
<P>
Flynn and other officials said the overwhelming defeat of the transportation 
tax will place Ventura County in a bad position when the county bids for state 
funding for local projects. 
</P>
<P>
"When you go to the state Transportation Department and ask for money, they 
want to know how we're going to come up with matching funds," Flynn said. 
"We'll say, 'We don't have anything.' And they'll say, 'We don't have anything 
for you either.' " 
</P>
<P>
With all precincts reporting but thousands of absentee ballots still uncounted, 
104,976 people, or 67.3%, voted against Measure A, with only 51,064 people, or 
32.7%, supporting the new tax. 
</P>
<P>
Also, local measures in Moorpark, Fillmore, Santa Paula and Piru that would 
have raised taxes for schools, ambulance service, building repairs and library 
services failed to garner the two-thirds vote needed for approval. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County voters rejected Proposition 143 by 88,436 votes, or 55.8%, to 
69,961, or 44.2%. Statewide, voters were slightly more concerned with higher 
education, defeating the proposition 51.2% to 48.8% 
</P>
<P>
Hart and Cal State University officials stressed the need to move swiftly to 
spend the $7 million on a new site in Ventura County, where Cal State has been 
trying to buy an acceptable location for four years. 
</P>
<P>
The money, which came from a 1986 bond issue, is thought to be secure until 
June 30, 1992. But the Legislature could reappropriate it before then for more 
pressing needs, such as upgrades to make buildings earthquake safe, said Bill 
Whiteneck, chief consultant to the state Senate's Education Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Of the seven sites now being considered for a possible Cal State campus in 
Ventura County, the university would have to exceed its budget to buy at least 
three, university officials said at their Oct. 31 meeting in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
The Taylor Ranch west of Ventura, property owned by the Donlon family at Wooley 
Road and Rose Avenue near Oxnard, and the southern portion of a site straddling 
Foothill Road near east Ventura each would probably cost more than $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Property next to the California Youth Authority near Camarillo, the north half 
of the Foothill Road property, land owned by the Lusk Co. and McLaughlin family 
near Ventura Harbor, and land owned by the McGrath family near McGrath State 
Beach could probably be purchased within the budget, officials and property 
owners said. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State University officials would also have to find funds to keep area roads 
from becoming clogged with students in the absence of local funding for 
improvements to existing county highways. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ginger Gherardi, executive director of the county Transportation 
Commission, the roads that will suffer the most from lack of funding include 
the Moorpark Freeway, which is already crowded during rush hours; the two-lane 
California 118 between Moorpark and the Ventura Freeway; and the narrow 
California 33 at the Casitas bypass. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue will come back again, because the reality in this county is there 
are not the dollars to build the projects that are needed," Gherardi said. 
</P>
<P>
Gherardi cited Orange County -- choked by gridlock -- as an example. After two 
unsuccessful tries in six years, Orange County voters Tuesday approved a 
sweeping package of highway transit projects, financed by a half-cent sales 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Baggerly, a member of the Environmental Coalition, which opposed the 
measure, said the strong defeat has more to do with growth control than bad 
timing. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't want to spend their money on something that's only the backbone 
for more development," she said. "Roads are just growth-inducing, everyone 
knows that."

OFFICIALS READYING CUTBACKS IN SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County and city officials began planning Wednesday for sweeping 
cuts and a funding crunch in mental health programs, jail facilities, the 911 
emergency telephone system and other services after voters rejected a host of 
state and local tax measures on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
With the defeat of Proposition 134, the so-called "nickel-a-drink" tax, the 
county could be forced to cut up to $57 million in public health programs, 
resulting in the closure of most of the 19 county-run mental health clinics, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Ed Edelman said the Board of Supervisors will request a meeting with 
governor-elect Pete Wilson to seek alternative funding sources for the 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a serious setback to county services," Edelman said. "We won't have 
funding for mental health, trauma care, alcohol-abuse treatment and services 
for battered women. . . . It's going to take some state action to keep us 
going. The present governor hasn't done much to help us." 
</P>
<P>
The defeat of Proposition A, a half-cent sales tax hike, is expected to 
exacerbate conditions in the county's already-strained jail system. With the 
county under court order to relieve overcrowding by limiting the jail 
population to about 25,000 inmates, those sentenced to 30 days now serve only 
11. 
</P>
<P>
"We were already in a crisis," Sheriff Sherman Block said. "There is no 
contingency plan. You have only two choices . . . lock them up or let them 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the municipal and countywide initiatives blamed the defeats on an 
angry electorate and a long ballot, crowded with 14 state bond propositions and 
five Los Angeles County and city measures. 
</P>
<P>
The bond measures were at the end of the ballot, following a daunting array of 
initiatives designed to raise money for everything from schools to old-growth 
redwood forests. 
</P>
<P>
"People in this county and this state are upset with the initiative process," 
Edelman said. "The number of the initiatives, the competing (propositions) and 
the complexity. I think that's why they voted no." 
</P>
<P>
With the defeat of Proposition J, police officials said nearly 1 million 911 
calls -- including 100,000 emergencies -- will go unanswered this year because 
the system is hopelessly outdated. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Capt. Greg Berg recalled a recent incident in which the 
mother of a 2-year-old child shot in a drive-by shooting could not get through 
to a 911 operator. 
</P>
<P>
"That happens all the time on the 911 system," Berg said. "It just isn't 
publicized." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Richard Alatorre, chairman of the Public Safety Committee, said 
that despite the defeat, the system still must be replaced. One option, he 
said, is to tap the city's general fund. But with recent budget slashing, there 
is no money available without cutting other programs. 
</P>
<P>
Also defeated Tuesday was Proposition B, a county bond measure that would have 
boosted property taxes to pay for an array of recreational and cultural 
projects, and Proposition K, a municipal bond measure that would have provided 
$80 million for nonprofit groups to buy and rehabilitate low-income housing.

 ANGRY VOTERS EXPEL MANY INCUMBENTS ON SCHOOL BOARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Community college trustees Thomas M. Buchenau and Sydney P. Wiener listed 
themselves as incumbents on Tuesday's ballot for reelection to the board of the 
Grossmont-Cuyamaca district. 
</P>
<P>
Rochelle T. Bastien, an appointed incumbent, decided merely to list her 
profession, as a clinical psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
Bastien was the only board member to survive Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the county, from Poway to San Ysidro, from East County to the North 
Coast, school board members found reelection tough sledding, with numerous 
veterans being turned out by voters expressing anti-incumbent anger and 
reflecting a national perception that too many things are wrong with American 
public education. Out of 36 districts with elections, only Coronado, Borrego 
Springs, Lemon Grove, San Dieguito, San Marcos and Santee returned all 
incumbents to office. The anti-incumbent mood flared in district races with 
sharp debates about locations of a new school or the value of a superintendent, 
as well as in those districts where no burning issues existed. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego Unified, the nation's eighth-largest urban system, John de Beck's 
razor-thin victory over Scott Harvey was due in part to De Beck's reputation as 
an iconoclastic candidate unafraid to lock horns with the prevailing philosophy 
of the existing board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Observers even attributed the mild upset of Kara Kobey over longtime education 
activist Yvonne Larsen for a San Diego Community College seat in part to 
voters' feelings that Larsen's extensive resume as a past city school district 
trustee and overseer for the California State University system gave her the 
aura of an incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
"There was an anti-incumbent mood, and the voters really took it out at (the 
school) level," said David Feldman, a veteran pollster and vice chancellor for 
development and community relations for the Grossmont-Cuyamaca system. "And add 
to that the feeling that schools are problematic anyways." 
</P>
<P>
Feldman said Wednesday no major issues divided candidates for the 
Grossmont-Cuyamaca board. 
</P>
<P>
Superintendents of various elementary and secondary school districts countywide 
made similar points Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We've wondered about this all day," said Warren Hogarth, superintendent of the 
La Mesa-Spring Valley district, where two of three incumbents lost, and where 
the third finished last of the three elected. "I can understand an incumbent 
being overturned here or there, but when it happens countywide . . . this is 
just not normal." 
</P>
<P>
All three incumbents were also-rans in Oceanside. "There were no particular 
issues that were contested here, and we really have no idea of what happened," 
Assistant Supt. Joe Graybeal said. He and other superintendents noted that the 
majority of voters do not have children in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we have to raise the consciousness level of those folks and get them in 
touch with schools so they will know" that educational quality does exist, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Sweetwater high school district, South Bay area voters had clear choices 
between incumbents supporting embattled superintendent Anthony Trujillo and 
those who feel he has poorly administered district finances and personnel 
matters. The two long-time incumbents who supported Trujillo were pasted by 
newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a message there," said trustee Nick Aguilar, a Trujillo supporter who 
was not up for reelection. He said that, although new board members will 
probably moderate their views once they become part of the system, their 
election will probably hasten Trujillo's expressed desire to retire by the end 
of his contract next year. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Weber, a San Diego city school trustee who will head the board next 
year, expressed sentiment for moderation about De Beck, whose views on major 
educational issues in the city diverge sharply from those of current board 
members. 
</P>
<P>
"I know little about the man because I've never met him personally, but I think 
you learn quickly as a new board member that, if you are going to bring about 
positive changes, you have to be collaborative with your colleagues and work 
with others who don't perhaps share your philosophy," Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
De Beck himself said Wednesday that he hopes to sit down soon with trustees -- 
all of whom backed his opponent -- to "try and allay the fears they apparently 
have of what kind of person I am. I want them to understand me better." 
</P>
<P>
De Beck will be joined as a new trustee by Sue Braun, who trounced Lynette 
Williams as expected for the other open seat. Braun, who considers herself much 
more in the mainstream of district policies, said her initial efforts will be 
to solve "nitty gritty problems" of skateboarding, new school openings and 
other constituent matters in her Scripps Ranch-Mira Mesa-San Carlos areas. 
</P>
<P>
Kobey will join fellow winners Maria Senour and Denise Ducheny on the San Diego 
Community College District board of trustees. The three women won the open 
seats and will serve alongside trustees Evonne Schulze and Fred Colby, who were 
elected two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Schulze said that the Kobey name -- she is the daughter of the late swap meet 
magnate Monte Kobey -- as well as her "freshness" compared to Larsen probably 
helped Kobey over the top. 
</P>
<P>
"But all six candidates who ran would have been very, very good," Schulze said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OFFICER SHOOTS SUSPECTED ARMED ROBBER TO 
DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles police officer shot and killed a suspected armed robber who 
police said had pointed a gun at the officer from the cover of a large bush, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was believed to be an accomplice of two other men suspected of 
robbing a man after he withdrew money from an automated teller machine about 
12:30 a.m. Wednesday, Lt. William Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
After the robbery in the 400 block of North La Brea Avenue, police found three 
men who matched the description of the robbers. One of the three escaped into a 
residential area. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Salvador Apodaca, 35, a 15-year department veteran, and his police dog 
found the man hiding in a large bush on Detroit Street, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
The man aimed a handgun at the officer and Apodaca fired twice, hitting the man 
once in the right eye and killing him, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The two other robbery suspects were arrested.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SPORTS SHOW PROMOTER TO PLEAD GUILTY IN 
FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The promoter accused of bilking celebrities and businessmen at a sports 
memorabilia show in Pasadena last September has agreed to plead guilty to an 
unrelated fraud charge from Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Hammack, known to those involved in the "Baseball Legends" event as Ernest 
Dent, appeared before U.S. Magistrate George K. King in Los Angeles Wednesday 
on a 5-year-old charge involving a disabled Laredo, Tex., man who claimed that 
Hammack swindled him out of $67,000. 
</P>
<P>
Hammack signed an agreement to have the case transferred from Texas to 
California so he can enter a guilty plea, according to his attorney, Stephen R. 
Kahn. Pending a judge's approval of the plea agreement, Hammack will serve 366 
days in jail, Kahn said . 
</P>
<P>
Hammack, 43, was accused by celebrities such as Mickey Mantle and others of 
defrauding them of more than $100,000 at the sports show. Prosecutors said the 
Pasadena case remains under review. No charges have been filed.

WARMER WATER BRINGS RED TIDE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A red tide -- thousands of microorganisms nurtured by warm ocean water and fall 
weather -- has invaded the Ventura County coast. 
</P>
<P>
The tide, which shines red during the day and glows green at night, started in 
small patches several days ago. 
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday, the microorganisms called dinoflagellates spanned from the coast of 
Ventura to Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Although some red tides poison shellfish, officials said the tide Tuesday 
appears to pose no health risk. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a naturally occurring phenomenon that occurs during the warm periods of 
the year," Reed Smith of the state Department of Fish and Game said. 
</P>
<P>
"Occasionally, it can create problems with shellfish, but for years the tides 
have not reached high enough concentrations to be harmful in Southern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
Steve White, district lifeguard supervisor, said the Ventura County shore gets 
about a dozen red tides a year. 
</P>
<P>
He said this tide, which could be seen clearly from the Ventura Pier, is the 
largest one this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be some beautiful wave viewing at night," White said. "It makes a 
greenish, luminescent glow. And sometimes, if you walk along the beach, your 
footprints will glow." TINA DAUNT

<P>
A Blue Line train struck and killed a man at Vernon and Long Beach avenues in 
South-Central Los Angeles on Wednesday shortly after 8 p.m., just two blocks 
south of where a woman and her 4-year-old son were killed two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the man, whose identity was not released, had asked them when 
the next train was coming.

PAY, CLASS SIZE KEY TO TEACHERS' CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives of the Simi Valley teachers union are asking the school 
district to continue basing their raises on teachers' salaries in other 
Southland districts and to place a cap on class size, according to the union's 
initial contract proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Under the current three-year contract, teachers in the Simi Valley Unified 
School District receive raises based on a comparison of 10 similar-sized school 
districts in Southern California. The teachers received a 6% raise in 1988-89, 
a 7% raise in 1989-90 and an estimated 8% raise for 1990-91, district officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole purpose of the formula was to get us where we should be. Since we 
got there, we want to stay," said Hal Vick, executive director of the Simi 
Educators Assn., which represents about 750 teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Union leaders have also suggested that the contract contain a cap on class 
size, a change from the current staffing level of 29 students for kindergarten 
through third-grade classes and 31 students per class for all other grade 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
The union has proposed that kindergarten through third-grade classes have a cap 
of 28 pupils, fourth-grade through 12th-grade classes have a maximum of 30 
students, physical education and music classes have no more than 40 students 
and industrial classes, such as science and home economics, have no more 
students than classroom workstations. 
</P>
<P>
In March, the union filed grievances claiming the district violated the 
contract when it laid off 32 temporary teachers and five school nurses to 
balance an $8-million deficit. An arbitrator ruled last month against the union 
in 10 of the grievances, prompting union officials to pursue stricter 
class-size regulations in the new contract. 
</P>
<P>
School district officials are expected to present their contract proposal in 
early January, Assistant Supt. Leon Mattingley said. The existing contract is 
scheduled to expire June 30, 1991, and negotiations could begin in late January 
or early February, district officials said. STEPHANIE STASSEL

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $2,500 IN BOGUS BILLS FOUND ON PLAYGROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal agents recovered $2,500 in "mediocre" counterfeit bills found "blowing 
in the Santa Ana winds" Wednesday on a playground at Crenshaw High School in 
South Los Angeles, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The quality of the bills, in denominations of $20s, $50s and $100s, were 
mediocre and nothing to shout about," said Jim Miller, special agent in charge 
of the U.S. Secret Service's Los Angeles office. Students returned an 
additional $600 after the principal made an announcement, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
The money, found blowing around between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., "obviously didn't 
appear out of the sky, but we don't have any witnesses who saw it being dropped 
there," he said.

DISTRICT TO CONTINUE DRIVER'S TRAINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THIA BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 100 Nordhoff High School students waiting to take driver's training 
classes this year will not be disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
The Ojai Unified School District board has decided to continue the classes 
through the school year, despite losing at least $15,000 in state budget cuts 
to pay for the program. 
</P>
<P>
"If it will help one student who otherwise might not be as safe, then it's 
worth it," board member Robert Emhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
The board's 5-0 vote Tuesday makes Ojai the only school district in Ventura 
County that has not dropped driving practice from its regular curriculum or 
started charging fees for it as an adult education program. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that we're the only district in the county doesn't bother me," board 
member Robert Tholl said. "The fact that almost every year we've had a young 
person killed does concern me." 
</P>
<P>
Nordhoff science teacher Del Garst, who has taught driver's education and 
training at the school for 17 years, said he was relieved that the 48 students 
now enrolled in the first-quarter training session will not be the last to 
receive it free from the district. 
</P>
<P>
"The CHP tells me this is one of the most dangerous areas in the county," said 
Garst, who trained 186 Nordhoff students in vehicles last year. 
</P>
<P>
Board Vice President Muriel Sharkey Lavender suggested that the state's new 
governor might resurrect the $21.2 million for driver's training programs that 
Gov. George Deukmejian cut from the budget. The board decided to wait until 
June to take further action. THIA BELL

FLORES 'NOT UNHAPPY' TO STAY ON COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republican Joan Milke Flores failed Tuesday in her bid to unseat incumbent 
Secretary of State March Fong Eu, but the three-term Los Angeles councilwoman 
said Wednesday that she is not disappointed to be back at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not unhappy that I lost," Flores told reporters after attending a council 
meeting. "I am not unhappy that I have this job. I think it is the best 
district in the city." 
</P>
<P>
Flores, whose 15th district stretches from Watts to San Pedro, collected about 
40% of the vote in her first bid for statewide office, according to unofficial 
election returns. Eu, a Democrat reelected to a fifth term, won 52% of the 
vote, while three other candidates shared the remaining 8%. 
</P>
<P>
Tired but decidedly upbeat, Flores moved to quell any concerns that her run for 
secretary of state somehow reflects a lack of interest in her current post. She 
said she is eager to get back into the day-to-day routine of City Hall, where 
she worked as a council aide for 25 years before winning her current post in 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who would go for a promotion on a job couldn't necessarily be accused 
of not liking the job they have if they wanted to have more responsibility or 
kind of broaden their scopes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Flores was careful not to rule out another run for higher 
office, although she said she has none in mind at the moment. "What I really 
want to do is get some rest and kind of get caught up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
With the election behind her, Flores said her top priorities in the district 
include obtaining public waterfront access in Wilmington from the Port of Los 
Angeles, tackling transportation problems in the harbor area and determining 
whether to expand the downtown San Pedro redevelopment area. 
</P>
<P>
She also plans to hold a fund-raiser to pay off an estimated $300,000 in debts 
from the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Although she was defeated by a comfortable margin, Flores said that she does 
not think of herself as a loser. She credited her campaign with highlighting 
problems in the relatively obscure secretary of state's office and for mounting 
the most serious challenge yet to Eu. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as August, Flores trailed Eu by a nearly 4-1 margin in some polls. 
In the end, Flores held Eu to less than 60% of the vote for the first time 
since Eu was elected secretary of state in 1974. Eu also lost her unofficial 
title as California's top vote-getter, which she had held for four straight 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a new level of consciousness now about the secretary of state's 
office that probably hasn't been there since Jerry Brown was there," Flores 
said, referring to Eu's predecessor who moved on to the governor's office in 
1974. "We focused some attention on the duties of that office, and people will 
now realize that it is more important to them than they suspected." 
</P>
<P>
Eu was said to be resting Wednesday and was not available for comment. But her 
campaign consultant credited Flores with "running a strong campaign." 
</P>
<P>
The consultant, Leo McElroy, also said Flores made a "very respectable showing" 
and predicted that some of Flores' criticisms would lead to changes in the 
secretary of state's office. "When a part of the conduct of an office becomes a 
public issue, it inevitably results in reassessment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that he believes Flores' decision to run a negative 
campaign, centered on hard-hitting television ads, did little to enhance her 
own political image. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the negatives she threw in this campaign add anything to her 
stature or luster," McElroy said. "Many of the votes were not votes cast for 
her, but purely in response to negatives she threw at March Fong Eu."

IN 'ANTI-INCUMBENT YEAR,' ALL 7 SOUTH BAY LEGISLATORS WIN EASILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite apparent statewide anger at legislators generally, South Bay voters on 
Tuesday proved kind to incumbents individually, rewarding all seven Assembly 
members and state senators with overwhelming wins. 
</P>
<P>
State Sens. Ralph C. Dills (D-Gardena) and Diane E. Watson (D-Los Angeles) 
routed their opponents, with Dills collecting 69% of the vote and Watson 
winning 85%. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the vote shares amassed by Assembly members Dave Elder (D-San 
Pedro), Gerald N. Felando (R-San Pedro), Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson), Gwen 
Moore (D-Los Angeles) and Curtis R. Tucker Jr. (D-Inglewood) ranged from 58% to 
85%. 
</P>
<P>
The victories came as the statewide electorate, described in pre-election polls 
as being upset with incumbents, approved Proposition 140. The measure restricts 
state senators to two four-year terms, or eight years in office, and Assembly 
members to three two-year terms, or six years in office. 
</P>
<P>
Approved with 51.8% of the vote statewide -- it drew 53% in Los Angeles County 
-- the measure applies to those elected on or after Tuesday's balloting. South 
Bay incumbents said the disparity between the Proposition 140 results and local 
election returns proves that voters do not hold a grudge against the lawmakers 
they know. 
</P>
<P>
"The attitude was, 'Throw the rascals out, but don't throw my legislator out,' 
" Dills said on election night. "This puts the lie to the so-called voter 
dissatisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
But for the losers, the outcome simply underscored the advantages of incumbency 
-- and the problems facing poorly funded, little-known challengers. 
</P>
<P>
"To reach every person you need to reach is such a monumental task when you 
don't have name recognition," said Republican Rodney D. Guarneri, who lost to 
Elder by a ratio of more than 2 to 1. "People going in to vote would recognize 
one name and not recognize the other. In that situation you tend to go with the 
name you're familiar with." 
</P>
<P>
The most competitive of the South Bay's state legislative races figured to be 
the 51st Assembly District contest between Felando, a six-term incumbent, and 
Democrat Marilyn J. Landau of Torrance. Though the contest was the South Bay's 
closest, it was not much of a horse race. 
</P>
<P>
Landau, a junior high school counselor, made abortion rights the mainstay of 
her campaign. She said voter concern about Felando's consistent backing for 
abortion curbs would help her win significant numbers of GOP votes in the 
largely Republican district, which stretches from Manhattan Beach to San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
But the unofficial tally left Felando with 58% of the vote, Landau with 38% -- 
only slightly above Democrat registration in the district -- and Libertarian 
William N. Gaillard of Redondo Beach, the third candidate, with 4%. 
</P>
<P>
In a subdued election night gathering in Lomita, Landau attributed her loss to 
a simple lack of campaign resources. Though she raised more money -- about 
$45,000 -- than any other South Bay state legislative challenger, Felando 
outspent her by a ratio of more than 3 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Felando said his victory showed that abortion is not an overriding issue in his 
district. Voters, he said, care more about his strong anti-tax and anti-crime 
positions than about his stand on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"She tried to make an issue where it didn't exist," Felando said at a victory 
party at Del Conte's restaurant in Torrance. "This is not a single-issue 
district." 
</P>
<P>
In the 57th Assembly District, which includes Wilmington, part of Harbor City 
and most of San Pedro, incumbent Elder won a seventh two-year term by beating 
GOP challenger Guarneri, 68% to 32%. 
</P>
<P>
Guarneri, a welfare case worker from Long Beach, surprised some of his 
supporters by disclosing at an Oct. 25 candidates' forum that he had used and 
sold drugs as a youth. 
</P>
<P>
But the poorly funded and little-known challenger's chances were already slim 
against Elder, who enjoyed a huge fund-raising lead, a heavily Democratic 
district and broad name recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Given those circumstances, though, Guarneri pronounced himself pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran a campaign with just $2,500 to $2,700, and we still got about a third 
of the vote," Guarneri said. "That's not too shabby." 
</P>
<P>
Asked how his remarks about selling and using drugs may have affected the race, 
Guarneri said: "In some ways it may have been good. In some ways it may have 
been bad. I don't regret telling the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Floyd also rolled up impressive vote totals in the 53rd Assembly District, 
which covers north Redondo Beach, Hawthorne, Lawndale, Carson, Gardena, Harbor 
Gateway and part of Harbor City. 
</P>
<P>
He scored an easy 61% to 39% win over GOP challenger Kevin B. Davis of 
Lawndale, who said his only reason for running was that no other Republican 
would dare to oppose Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
The results were even more lopsided in the South Bay's two northern Assembly 
districts, where Moore, who has served six terms, and Tucker, a freshman 
legislator, exceeded 70% and 80% of the vote, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Moore prevailed over Republican Eric Givens, 74% to 21%, in the 49th Assembly 
District, which includes Playa del Rey, Marina del Rey, Westchester, Culver 
City, Ladera Heights, Baldwin Hills and the Crenshaw area. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates Alice Mae Miles of the Peace and Freedom Party and Libertarian Carin 
Rogers split the remaining 5% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Givens, who two years ago lost to Moore, 23% to 77%, had said before the 
election that it would take an indictment of Moore to give him a shot at 
victory in the solidly Democratic district. 
</P>
<P>
But even that possibility faded Oct. 23, when authorities announced that Moore 
-- scrutinized for more than two years as part of a federal investigation into 
political corruption in Sacramento -- was cleared of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker, who did not draw a GOP opponent, beat Peace and Freedom Party candidate 
Michael L. Long, 85% to 15%, in the 50th Assembly District, which includes 
Inglewood, El Segundo, and Lennox. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker said his lack of opposition proves that voters are not as upset with 
lawmakers as their support for Proposition 140 would indicate. 
</P>
<P>
"I work hard, and I guess people decided that since I'm out there everywhere 
(in the district) that I'm doing the best I can," he said Wednesday. "It's 
nothing new that most of the electorate likes their local representative and 
can't stand the rest of the scoundrels." 
</P>
<P>
Of the South Bay's two state Senate races, the larger victory margin came in 
the 28th Senate District, which includes Inglewood, Hawthorne, and Lawndale. 
Watson, a three-term incumbent, beat lone challenger Ivan William Kasimoff of 
the Peace and Freedom Party, 85% to 15%. 
</P>
<P>
In the 30th Senate District, which includes Carson, Gardena, Harbor City and 
Wilmington, Dills won a seventh four-year term by defeating little-known 
Republican Timothy Poling, 69% to 31%. 
</P>
<P>
Dills said his win had less to do with the advantages of incumbency than with 
the gratitude of voters in his heavily minority district. 
</P>
<P>
"The people, having checked my career, know that I'm not up here to feather my 
own nest," he said. "My job is to represent them, and do for them what they 
can't do for themselves. I truly represent their ideas and wishes."

NEW ERA SEEN AS LAGERQUIST WINS VACANT COUNCIL SEAT IN LAWNDALE; 
</P>
<P>
VOTING: ELECTORATE ALTERED BY INFLUX OF NEWCOMERS FAVORS PRO-BUSINESS CANDIDATE 
OVER LONGTIME RESIDENTS WITH HIGH NAME RECOGNITION.

<P>
Aerospace engineer Norm Lagerquist swept into a vacant seat on the Lawndale 
City Council in an election Tuesday that may signal a realignment of city 
politics in favor of business interests and also appears to reflect a shift in 
the city's demographics. 
</P>
<P>
Lagerquist, 35, a relative newcomer to Lawndale politics who campaigned on a 
pro-business platform, was elected to the council with 40% of the vote, easily 
defeating three opponents, including two longtime residents with high name 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Development consultant Gary McDonald, 30, placed second with 24% of the vote, 
followed by purchasing agent Ron Maxwell, 27, who won 22%, and machine shop 
owner Bob Cerny, 72, with 13%. 
</P>
<P>
Lagerquist's victory was not entirely a surprise. Vice president of a local 
homeowners group, he campaigned vigorously and amassed an impressive array of 
endorsements, including those of council members Carol Norman and Bill Johnson 
and Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson). 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the candidates chose to spend election night quietly with a 
small group of campaign workers, Lagerquist and about 40 supporters gathered 
for a party at the home of Lawndale school Trustee Bob Kruse. Confident of 
victory, they celebrated with champagne and cake after Lagerquist's lead topped 
200 votes around 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Lawndale recreation coordinator Linda Zirpoli said a majority of the city's 
50-odd employees supported Lagerquist because he is a fresh face and because 
they believe he will focus on the issues and bring more professionalism to city 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
"People are tired of hearing, 'We're broke, we're in the hole, the city's 
mismanaged,' " Zirpoli said. "I think everyone in Lawndale just wants a 
change." 
</P>
<P>
Lawndale, which has long been a working-class community with a large base of 
elderly, long-term residents, has recently seen an influx of younger couples, 
many of them employed in the aerospace industry. For the newcomers, Lawndale's 
affordable housing has made it an attractive alternative to the beach cities. 
</P>
<P>
The radical shift toward a younger, white-collar population "is providing a 
different electorate as well as a different base from which to draw 
candidates," Lagerquist said. 
</P>
<P>
Lagerquist's top challenger, McDonald, lost a bid for a council seat in April 
by seven votes. He was endorsed by Mayor Harold Hofmann and Councilman Larry 
Rudolph. A lifelong resident of Lawndale, McDonald initially was considered to 
have an advantage because he is a "local boy." 
</P>
<P>
Although McDonald frequently claimed to have saved the city money and to be the 
strongest anti-gang candidate, some supporters said he was relying too heavily 
on name recognition and his past accomplishments as a civic watchdog and former 
planning commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's campaign took a decisive turn for the worse last weekend when the 
Southern California Caucus, a regional political group that supports 
businesses, issued a mailer raising questions about his personal scruples. 
</P>
<P>
The mailer told voters that McDonald had two outstanding state tax liens 
pending against him as well as an arrest warrant for failing to appear in court 
on a traffic citation. 
</P>
<P>
Although both allegations were confirmed by state authorities, McDonald said 
that the tax liens were a mistake and that he was unaware of the arrest 
warrant. He called the mailer "the worst example of mudslinging and dirty 
politics" he had ever seen and blamed it for his poor showing at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
But even McDonald's staunchest supporters conceded that the mailer wasn't 
solely responsible for his defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a combination of the hit pieces against Gary and obviously that 
Norm (Lagerquist) presented his case out there better than Gary did," Rudolph 
said. "When you get that much of the vote, you must be telling people things 
they want to hear." 
</P>
<P>
According to unofficial tallies with 100% of the precincts reporting, 
Lagerquist received 1,357 votes, McDonald 837, Maxwell 746 and Cerny 449. 
</P>
<P>
Lagerquist will serve for 17 months, the remainder of the term Hofmann vacated 
when he was elected mayor in April. 
</P>
<P>
The showing by Maxwell and Cerny, who both ran as unaligned independents and 
who together earned nearly as many votes as Lagerquist, was perceived by some 
to be a rejection of the bloc voting and partisan politics that have marked the 
city in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"If (Lagerquist) gets in, it'll be 3-2 (votes on the council) all the time, 
with him and Johnson and Norman" voting together, Cerny predicted. 
</P>
<P>
But Lagerquist insists he doesn't owe anything to his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm there to make good decisions, and I think the reason (council members 
Norman and Johnson) supported me is not because I'm committed to vote with them 
on any issue but because of the way I make decisions and also because of my 
values," Lagerquist said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Lagerquist acknowledges that improving relations between the city 
and its fledgling business community is at the top of his agenda. He said he is 
likely to vote with Johnson and Norman to restore funding to the Lawndale 
Chamber of Commerce and to remove parking restrictions along some residential 
streets near Hawthorne Boulevard, the city's main commercial thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
Although Rudolph and Hofmann backed McDonald, both said they expect to be able 
to work well with Lagerquist. 
</P>
<P>
"My personal feeling is that after (Lagerquist) makes his political paybacks, 
we'll eventually get back on track," Rudolph said. "I don't think I'll have any 
problems working with him after that."

UNCOUNTED ABSENTEES STILL TOTAL 43,000 VOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few San Diego County races remained so close Wednesday that there is a 
long-shot possibility that the counting of absentee ballots could change the 
results. And the absentee results won't be known with certainty until next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
According to the registrar of voters, there are about 43,000 absentee ballots 
countywide left to be counted. What isn't known is the breakdown of those 
absentee ballots -- how many come from the city of San Diego or a specific 
legislative district. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) is 982 votes behind Randall (Duke) 
Cunningham in the 44th Congressional District and theoretically could still 
come out a winner, though both of them admit such a turnaround is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Others in similar situations are Mike Gotch and Assemblyman Jeff Marston (R-San 
Diego) in the 78th District, followed by Deirdre (Dede) Alpert and 
Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas) in the 75th District. 
</P>
<P>
Marston finds himself 1,858 votes behind Gotch, while Mojonnier trails Alpert 
by a margin of 5,821, which makes her prospects particularly dim. 
</P>
<P>
In a San Diego school board contest, John de Beck leads Scott Harvey by 2,455 
votes. While De Beck looked forward Wednesday to the new post, he did express 
caution that absentee balloting could change the result. 
</P>
<P>
Another close race in San Diego is over Proposition C, the measure asking voter 
approval to sell $100 million in bonds to pay for open space and new parks. 
Those opposed to the measure lead supporters by 2,004 votes, or 50.43% to 
49.10%, with the absentees still to be counted. 
</P>
<P>
The registrar of voters said that, over the next several days, the remaining 
absentee ballots will be verified and then counted.

SIGNALS OF A RIGHT TURN PROVE FALSE IN SANTA MONICA; 
</P>
<P>
SUBURBAN RACES: ENVIRONMENTALIST-BACKED CANDIDATES WIN WATER BOARD SEATS IN THE 
SAN GABRIEL VALLEY. WEST HOLLYWOOD REJECTS CARD CLUB GAMBLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Santa Monica voters Tuesday refused to approve a luxury beach hotel that noted 
restaurateur Michael McCarty planned to build, and rebuffed an attempt by 
landlords to dilute the city's tough rent control law. 
</P>
<P>
The two issues, coupled with a city ballot measure seen as unsympathetic to the 
homeless, inspired pre-election speculation that the liberal seaside community 
was about to turn toward the political right. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the speculation was premature. All three measures failed. 
</P>
<P>
Other election highlights in suburban Los Angeles County included: 
</P>
<P>
* In the San Gabriel Valley, five environmentalist-backed candidates scored a 
clean sweep on three water boards. 
</P>
<P>
* West Hollywood residents resoundingly rejected card club gambling by a vote 
of 76.6% to 23.4%. 
</P>
<P>
* In Downey, Leo R. Villa, a retired deputy district attorney, lost the 
election for Municipal Court judge after a campaign that attracted widespread 
attention when his 34-year-old son, born out of wedlock, publicly opposed him. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, the voice of the voters was loudest on the subject of 
development. Nearly complete returns showed that, in addition to rejecting 
McCarty's beach hotel, voters approved a ban on new hotels and large 
restaurants on or near the beach and apparently ousted five-term City Council 
incumbent Christine Reed. She was depicted during the campaign as a supporter 
of large commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
Reed clung to a faint hope that an estimated 4,500 absentee ballots would give 
her enough votes for the third-place finish she would need to return to office. 
The top vote-getter was community activist Tony Vazquez, who will be the 
council's first Latino member. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica voters rejected a landlord-sponsored ballot measure that would 
decontrol rents on apartments that are voluntarily vacated. Landlords responded 
by warning that evictions may increase because some property owners who are 
unable to make a profit under stringent rent controls would shut down their 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Also rejected in Santa Monica was a ballot measure to make the city attorney an 
elected position. Supporters of the measure billed it as a referendum on the 
city's lenient policy toward the homeless and on City Atty. Robert M. Myers, 
whom some blamed for not rousting the homeless out of town. 
</P>
<P>
The San Gabriel Valley electorate, unlike voters statewide who turned down 
pleas of environmentalists, cast its lot for sweeping change on water boards. 
They selected five Sierra Club-endorsed candidates in three water districts. 
</P>
<P>
"From now on, every water board seat in the San Gabriel Valley is going to be 
contested," said Hacienda Heights environmentalist Wil Baca, who was not a 
candidate but helped to organize a campaign that focused on the area's severe 
ground water pollution problems, which have forced closure of one-fourth of the 
valley's wells. 
</P>
<P>
The environmentalists say they will be aggressive as board members of the Upper 
San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District, the Three Valleys Municipal Water 
District and the San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District. 
</P>
<P>
In Downey, observers could not agree on whether Leo Villa's opposition from his 
son contributed to his defeat by trial lawyer David W. Perkins, who had 55% of 
the vote to Villa's 45%. 
</P>
<P>
Villa, 62, a part-time court commissioner, was the target of a campaign waged 
by his son, Richard L. Villa, who said he is angry because his father has seen 
him only twice and barely acknowledges his existence. He posted more than 400 
signs urging a no vote on his father. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Villa could not be reached for comment.

CATHIE WRIGHT TAKES WIN IN STRIDE AND IN SONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
On a night of computer breakdowns and torturously late election returns, state 
Assemblywoman Cathie Wright was one happy exception to the bevy of nail-biting 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Confident of success in her low-profile campaign, Wright spent the evening 
feting fellow Republicans in proper style -- hopping her way through Ventura 
and Los Angeles counties in a sleek, dark blue limousine. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping tabs on election results via color TV and mobile phone, the 
velveteen-clad, Dr Pepper-swigging Wright stopped in at several GOP parties, 
capping off the night in Burbank with an a cappella rendition of "God Bless 
America" for her longtime friend and newly elected Assemblywoman Paula Boland. 
</P>
<P>
Boland's eyes brimmed with tears as Wright sang and "it was kind of an 
emotional moment for all of us," said John Theiss, Wright's administrative 
aide. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of Paula's favorite songs, I do believe, and for Cathie to sing it 
to her was a real special moment," Theiss said. Afterward, he said, the entire 
group of well-wishers at the Burbank Hilton sang "We Are the Champions." 
</P>
<P>
Boland and Wright, both winners in the Republican-dominated 38th and 37th 
Assembly Districts, hugged each other and watched the midnight returns 
together. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate broker Boland, who had not acknowledged her victory over Democratic 
teacher Irene Allert until 10% of the vote came in, finally made it official. 
And Wright, who campaigned heavily for Boland, "was right there to show her 
support and welcome her" to Sacramento, Theiss said. 
</P>
<P>
One singer who didn't make Boland's celebration was Gladys Knight, whom Boland 
described as a friend from real estate transactions. Boland said she had 
expected the entertainer to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Losers found solace in small and unexpected places Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
For Allert, a political novice from Kagel Canyon who achieved an impressive 
showing against the well-connected Boland, it came in a bottle of Shalimar 
perfume. 
</P>
<P>
A gift from her friend Sharon Molander, the heady scent evoked more innocent, 
less complicated times together at Immaculate Heart College. Even then, 
Molander said, other women turned to Allert for leadership and support. 
</P>
<P>
"She was one person who didn't fall apart in a crisis," said Molander, who 
joined about 150 Allert supporters, many of them nurses and teachers, at a cozy 
Granada Hills house. 
</P>
<P>
While the scent of Shalimar wafted through Allert's party, cosmetics were 
apparent at Jim Salomon's gathering in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Trade consultant Salomon, who lost the 23rd Congressional District race for the 
second time to incumbent Anthony C. Beilenson, said later he had too little 
time to remove the slightly orange makeup before greeting supporters. Still, 
the Woodland Hills resident reveled in a glowing endorsement from the Malibu 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
The weekly newspaper endorsed eight candidates -- Salomon the only Republican 
among them. He read the endorsement, which called him bright and eager, to 
supporters because he felt his presence alongside seven Democrats "was 
particularly noteworthy." 
</P>
<P>
A healthy sense of realism and a practical spouse served Democrat Richard 
Freiman well. 
</P>
<P>
The Agoura Hills attorney and TV writer may have lost the 21st Congressional 
race to incumbent Elton Gallegly, a Republican institution from Simi Valley. 
But at least he had reservations lined up for a weekend in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman's wife, Leslie, said that even though "we really don't like to gamble," 
she planned the trip months ago "so we don't sit around feeling depressed" 
about the election.

<P>
GOP'S BOLAND STAVES OFF VIGOROUS CHALLENGE FROM ALLERT TO CAPTURE SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Republican Paula Boland, bolstered by a richer campaign treasury and strong 
alliances with GOP power brokers, held off an unexpectedly vigorous challenge 
by Democrat Irene Allert to win election to the state Assembly in the 
Republican-dominated 38th District, final vote counts showed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Boland, a real estate broker who lives in Porter Ranch, won with 52.5% of the 
vote to 44% for Allert, an educational consultant from Kagel Canyon. Peace and 
Freedom candidate Charles Najbergier had 3.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Boland, 50, will succeed Assemblywoman Marian La Follette (R-Northridge), who 
is retiring next month after a decade in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thrilled," Boland said. "The phones haven't stopped. Flowers are just 
pouring into the office. . . . It's a wonderful feeling." 
</P>
<P>
A staunch conservative, Boland won with a cautious, low-key campaign that 
emphasized her tough-on-crime stance. In public comments, she repeatedly 
referred to anti-crime bills that she pledged to introduce as soon as she is 
sworn in. 
</P>
<P>
Boland also capitalized on long involvement in grass-roots Republican circles 
in the San Fernando Valley, enlisting campaign help from local GOP luminaries 
such as Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson and former Rep. Bobbi Fiedler 
of Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
She received endorsements from a string of conservative GOP assemblymen in 
Sacramento, which in turn helped her attract donations from special interest 
groups. Boland spent about $170,000 on the campaign, compared with $100,000 for 
Allert. 
</P>
<P>
Although Boland's campaign handlers expected her to win by up to 15 percentage 
points, she got a surprisingly strong battle from Allert, 46, whose campaign 
stressed abortion rights and scaling down the massive Porter Ranch development. 
</P>
<P>
Allert's percentage of the vote was the highest since 1982 for a Democrat in 
the district, where Republicans outnumber Democrats 84,000 to 73,000. Her total 
vote was about 2% higher than the percentage of registered Democrats, 
indicating that she won over more than 1,500 GOP voters. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned that her opposition to legalized abortion might hurt her, Boland 
tried to appeal to GOP women by calling for crackdowns on rapists and those who 
commit crimes against schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
With limited money, Allert ran a somewhat risky campaign that concentrated on 
persuading Republicans to cross party lines rather than maximizing Democratic 
turnout. For instance, the only precinct-walking that Allert conducted was in 
Burbank, a GOP stronghold, her campaign consultant, Parke Skelton, said. 
</P>
<P>
Allert also aimed all of her campaign mailers at Republicans. Despite her 
smaller treasury, Allert sent out seven mailings, two more than Boland. But 
Allert was forced to cancel two other planned mailings because her campaign ran 
out of money.

DRUNK DRIVER CONVICTED IN DEATH OF MOTORCYCLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Newhall woman who had numerous drunk-driving arrests was found guilty 
Wednesday of vehicular manslaughter for driving drunk and causing a crash that 
killed a Canadian motorcyclist and injured his wife of one month. 
</P>
<P>
But jurors acquitted Patricia Lee Giunta, 41, of gross vehicular manslaughter, 
a more serious charge for which she could have faced a maximum prison sentence 
of 10 years and eight months when combined with other charges. Instead, Giunta 
faces a maximum sentence of six years and eight months in prison when she is 
sentenced Dec. 13 in San Fernando Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jacquelyn Lacey, who prosecuted Giunta, said she had mixed 
feelings about the verdict but said she is glad that Giunta will spend time in 
jail for the crash. 
</P>
<P>
The Oct. 4, 1989, crash on the Golden State Freeway in Sun Valley left David 
Jaggs, 24, dead and his wife, Janine, 21, seriously injured. The couple had 
recently moved to Los Angeles to attend college, Lacey said. 
</P>
<P>
Blood tests taken after the crash showed that Giunta had a 0.29% blood-alcohol 
level. 
</P>
<P>
Giunta testified that she had consumed nearly a pint of vodka before the crash, 
but said she did not feel intoxicated when she entered the Tuxford Street 
on-ramp to the freeway and struck the motorcycle. She said the motorcycle cut 
her off, but Janine Jaggs testified that the motorcycle did not change lanes. 
</P>
<P>
Lacey said that Giunta had been arrested four times for drunk driving before 
last fall's crash and was arrested again for drunk driving while out on bail in 
the case. But she was convicted only once, in large part because she had 
claimed that police had lied in the other cases, Lacey said. 
</P>
<P>
"You can only claim the cops lie so many times, and then you have to look at 
yourself," Lacey told jurors after the verdict was read. "To get arrested only 
30 days after" the fatal crash "made me angry at this woman." 
</P>
<P>
Jurors said they had difficulty understanding the meaning of gross vehicular 
manslaughter. To be convicted of the charge, a defendant must exhibit wanton 
disregard for human life.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: DEL MAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Latino men burned to death when their shack caught fire at a migrant camp 
on Lansdale Drive in Del Mar, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The two men were identified as Alfredo Hernandez, 38, and Miguel Castellano, 
36, the coroner's office said. Both men were from Mexico, but hometowns were 
not known, a deputy coroner said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire started about 11:53 p.m. Tuesday in the shack on a migrant camp 
located in the brush about 100 yards north of Lansdale Drive, less than a mile 
from Del Mar Heights Road, police said. A burning candle that tipped over may 
be responsible, they said.

BURGLARS TAKE JEWELRY VALUED AT $225,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Burglars broke into a Valencia jewelry store early Wednesday and stole more 
than 2,000 rings, necklaces and bracelets valued at $225,000, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies, summoned by a silent alarm at Addie's 
Gold and Jewelry at 24311 Magic Mountain Parkway, found the plate glass front 
door smashed about 12:05 a.m., Lt. Don Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said three glass display cases were broken and emptied of more than 
2,000 pieces. Deputies arrived within minutes of the alarm but found no 
burglars. Shop owner Gary Popejoy said much of the jewelry had arrived recently 
and had not yet been put in a safe. The stolen jewelry was intended for the 
store's Christmas inventory. Popejoy said he closed his shop Wednesday for 
repairs but planned to reopen today.

SAN DIEGO OFFICIALS OPTIMISTIC GAME WILL MAKE A RETURN VISIT

<P>
San Diego re-emerged Wednesday as a contender for the 1993 Super Bowl after the 
National Football League announced that its decision to have Phoenix host the 
game was endangered because of Arizona's failure to pass referenda honoring Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the San Diego Super Bowl Task Force were stunned earlier this year 
when the city's bid to host the '93 event was thrown out on the first ballot. 
But like a phoenix rising from the ashes, San Diego now appears reborn with 
Phoenix on the outs. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post quoted "a source close to (NFL Commissioner Paul) 
Tagliabue" as saying there was an "80% chance" the game would be relocated to 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Phoenix edged out San Diego, San Francisco and Los Angeles for the 
right to host the much-coveted game, which experts say represents a windfall in 
excess of $150 million for the host city. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor sent a letter to Tagliabue on Wednesday, expressing 
interest in having the NFL consider San Diego its alternate host. Paul Downey, 
a spokesman for the mayor, said the $125 million brought into the city by Super 
Bowl XXII in 1988 was a big reason. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if San Diego had a chance to grab the '93 game, Downey said, "Absolutely, 
absolutely. Many of the pundits earlier this year said San Diego and Los 
Angeles were the favorites, but (Phoenix Cardinals' owner) Bill Bidwill 
literally begged fellow owners." 
</P>
<P>
Bidwill's dream of having the game in Phoenix appeared doomed late Tuesday 
after Arizona voters rejected two ballot initiatives, either of which would 
have designated a state holiday in honor of the civil rights leader, who was 
slain in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia Eagles owner Norman Braman, chairman of the NFL's Super Bowl Site 
Selection Committee, said earlier this year that he would spearhead a drive to 
have Phoenix removed as host if the King initiatives failed. 
</P>
<P>
Chargers' owner Alex Spanos said Wednesday he would support Braman in moving 
the game elsewhere -- specifically, to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very disappointed we didn't get it last March," Spanos said from his 
Stockton office. "I thought we had a great chance to get it then. My opinion is 
that it belongs there (San Diego). I'm sorry Phoenix is having the problems 
it's having, but I would love it if we would have it in (San Diego) Jack Murphy 
Stadium." 
</P>
<P>
Spanos said he's hopeful the Chargers will have a team capable of playing in 
the Super Bowl by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be the best thing of all," he said. "But I make no predictions. I 
quit doing that last year." 
</P>
<P>
NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said Wednesday the issue would not be on the agenda 
at a meeting of league owners for next Wednesday in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the new site would be limited to those cities that finished 
behind Phoenix in balloting for the '93 game, or whether a wide-open 
competition would result, Aiello said, "We just can't say. We had no plans for 
an alternate site, for the likelihood that this might happen." 
</P>
<P>
But Leon Parma, a member of the executive committee of the San Diego Super Bowl 
Task Force, said Wednesday he had conferred with several NFL owners who assured 
him the new site would be limited to those cities that finished behind Phoenix 
in the balloting for '93. 
</P>
<P>
Parma said league owners were "high on San Diego" because of the success of the 
1988 Super Bowl, which then-Commissioner Pete Rozelle labeled "the best ever." 
Parma noted that Rozelle is now a resident of Fairbanks Ranch in North San 
Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Eagles' owner Braman, who led the anti-Phoenix lobby, is an officer of the 
Greater Miami Jewish Federation and the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith 
in Miami, one of his two cities of residence. One of the United States' leading 
supporters of Israel, Braman also is active in Miami's black community. 
</P>
<P>
"I know Norman Braman to be a man with a strong social conscience," said Arthur 
Teitelbaum, Southern area director for the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai 
B'rith. "I'm not surprised at all that he's taken a position that expresses 
such concern and sensitivity to the memory of Dr. King." 
</P>
<P>
But, ironically, San Diego has had its own controversies in how to honor the 
civil rights leader, and some community figures speculated Wednesday that its 
reluctance to pay proper tribute may play a role in the Super Bowl sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
Market Street was re-named in honor of Dr. King, then named Market Street again 
after area merchants complained. A proposal to have the San Diego Convention 
Center named after King was rejected. And, finally, a portion of California 94 
was dedicated in King's memory. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the NFL will put the same conditions on San Diego," said City Councilman 
Wes Pratt, who is black. 
</P>
<P>
But Pratt said he supports the city's bid to host the game in 1993 and added, 
"We do honor his holiday in the state and the county, and the city now has a 
floating holiday (in honor of Dr. King). We have a degree of responsiveness 
here that you just don't have in Phoenix. And I certainly urge the mayor to 
rekindle the efforts to get the game here. It represents a tremendous economic 
boon and opportunity for the city." 
</P>
<P>
Pratt said San Diego's chances for bringing the game here as a result of 
Arizona's controversy over King may focus attention "on the memory of the man 
in a positive way. The city is considering a multitude of ideas (for honoring 
King), one of which is a scholarship fund for children. Things are happening 
with this issue. It's not dead, it's not dying, and the city will be forced to 
deal with it further because of this Super Bowl question."

LAMB TOILS THROUGH TURBULENT TIMES; 
</P>
<P>
SDSU: AZTECS' DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR, FRUSTRATED BY OPPONENTS' POINTS PARADE, 
IMMERSES HIMSELF IN FINDING SOLUTIONS. 
</P>

<P>
It was quiet now. Football practice was finished. Darkness was enveloping the 
San Diego State campus on a chilly fall evening, a peaceful moment broken only 
by the frustration that raged through Barry Lamb's mind. 
</P>
<P>
This was earlier in the week, three months and a thousand thoughts away from 
August, a time when the Aztecs wore optimism like a new jersey. Then, there was 
the kickoff banquet at Sea World, when laughs and hopes and dreams were eagerly 
served and devoured along with chicken. 
</P>
<P>
No more. Lamb is the defensive coordinator at SDSU, and the most difficult 
season of his life is painfully trickling away. 
</P>
<P>
Lamb sat in the defense's room at the SDSU football building, a room in which 
he seems to spend most of his hours these days. This is where the Aztecs try to 
resurrect their broken-down defense. 
</P>
<P>
It is also where a tortured man works, fighting to keep his pride and, maybe, 
his job. He has discussed that with Coach Al Luginbill. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU whipped Utah Saturday, 66-14, and played their best defense of the year. 
Now, this Saturday's game against Hawaii is the most important yet. The defense 
must continue to show improvement. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs have spent four weeks this season ranked 106th among Division I team 
defenses. Dead last. They are currently 103rd. Once, they scored 51 points but 
allowed 52. The defense has been awful. 
</P>
<P>
It's that simple. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that simple. 
</P>
<P>
Not when you are working from 6 a.m. until 10 p.m., at times, trying everything 
you can think of to get the job done. Not when you've got a wife and three kids 
and you're working seven days a week for months on end. And most certainly not 
when you talk with your five-year-old son and you hear an innocent voice 
asking, "Daddy, when are you coming home?" 
</P>
<P>
And then you go out and get your brains beat in again. 
</P>
<P>
Lamb, 35, has never been through anything like this, not through previous 
coaching stops at Oregon, Arizona State, Nevada Las Vegas or Idaho. He 
remembers a couple of 2-9 seasons at Oregon, "but at least we were showing 
progress early in the second year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There hasn't been much in his second year at SDSU. In a season that started 
with talk of bowl games, the defense -- his defense -- has collapsed like the 
savings and loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
And soon, it felt like buzzards were circling. Talk began relating to his job 
status. 
</P>
<P>
And was it really a surprise? The Aztecs watched Ty Detmer and Brigham Young go 
for 62 points against them, Wyoming for 52 and UCLA for 45. The Bruins had 35 
at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
After the UCLA game Oct. 13, Lamb felt it was time for a visit with Luginbill. 
</P>
<P>
"We had very frank discussions," Lamb said. "I understand his situation and I 
told him if ever the time comes, I'd look him in the eye, shake his hand and 
wish him well. He likes me, and he likes my family. But business is business. 
If it comes to that, it comes to that. I will accept whatever decision he 
makes." 
</P>
<P>
Lamb has known Luginbill for years. Luginbill recruited him when Luginbill was 
an assistant at Arizona State, and then the two became reacquainted when Lamb 
was a graduate assistant at Oregon in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want our friendship to get in the way of something he had to do," 
Lamb said. "If he needs to make a change . . . I'll respect that decision." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill says no, he is not thinking of making any coaching changes. 
</P>
<P>
"I delegate, but I also accept full responsibility," Luginbill said. "If I 
thought coaching was the problem, I would correct it in a minute. 
</P>
<P>
"If things don't get better, if they don't get better defensively in the next 
couple of years, I'm going to get fired." 
</P>
<P>
Luginbill said he met with all of the defensive coaches after the UCLA game. He 
wanted to make sure they kept their minds on competing rather than on getting 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
A football coach lives with this. He works in a tough world with tough people, 
and firings are part of the package. But then comes a quiet moment at home and 
a glance at his wife, and the lump in his throat feels like it will strangle 
him. 
</P>
<P>
That's the worst part. A man can stand tall, and take criticism, and maybe even 
learn to accept failure. But when it affects his family, it rips out his heart. 
</P>
<P>
It's not as if a pink slip is in the mail to Lamb. But no matter how thick your 
skin is, you hear such talk. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to tell you no, but sure it has," Lamb said. "On one level, it's just 
frustrating because I know what Al is going through. The last thing I want to 
do in the world is fail him. He's been so good to me. I think a lot of the guy. 
That hurts as much as anything. 
</P>
<P>
"And then you have a wife and a family, and something like this happens . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Lamb will tell you that the disappointing season has been difficult on the 
players. He will tell you about the pressure Luginbill faces, and how badly he 
feels for others. He deflects his own problems as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
A big man with a soft, gentle voice -- except on the practice field -- Lamb is 
warm and cordial, with a dry sense of humor, the kind of guy you might enjoy as 
a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Lamb's wife, Karen, suffers with him. Barry can go to work each day and 
release some energy on the practice field. Karen has to watch it all. 
</P>
<P>
She knows what a coach goes through. She played volleyball well enough to be 
inducted into the Brigham Young athletic Hall of Fame. Then she became a highly 
successful volleyball coach at UNLV and then at Washington State when Barry was 
at Idaho. Because of the children, they decided they couldn't both remain in 
coaching. She got out. They moved to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
They have three children -- Mackenzie Curtis, 5, Tanner Alexander, 2, and 
Tucker McKenna, six months. The children have learned early about their daddy 
and football, how a child's game sometimes makes a grown man feel like crying. 
</P>
<P>
"Karen talks to them," Lamb said. " 'Daddy is not feeling very good right now.' 
It affects you. Unfortunately, it's difficult to shield kids from how depressed 
you are and how badly you feel. 
</P>
<P>
"They feel for you, too. That has been difficult. The older boy (Mackenzie) 
picks up on my emotions, and he can tell when I'm sad or upset, and he becomes 
that way, too. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult when you're a coach and that's your identity and it appears 
you're failing. It's pretty unsettling. We can say what we want. There are 
lies, damn lies and statistics. Many times, (statistics) are all people 
understand or want to understand." 
</P>
<P>
There is hope. First, the difficult times have not eroded the players' 
confidence in Lamb. "Everyone has a lot of respect for him," said senior 
cornerback Clark Moses. "He's a great coach. He knows his stuff." 
</P>
<P>
And against Utah on Saturday, the defense played reasonably well, although the 
opponent was weak and Lamb said the Aztecs still missed too many tackles (14). 
But the defense misaligned only once. 
</P>
<P>
"One game does not a season make," he said. "It makes it almost worse, knowing 
our offense is so doggone good. Here we are in a situation where, had we been 
playing average defense, we would have won three or four more games. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sorry for those guys. I feel bad we couldn't have done our part." 
</P>
<P>
Coaches live on time. The contradiction is that time always moves so slowly, 
yet there is never enough of it. The coaches need a few victories now, and yet 
they usually would like more time to work out some kinks. 
</P>
<P>
The irony is that progress sometimes only makes things more frustrating. If 
only we could have played like we did against Utah earlier in the year. 
</P>
<P>
There are reasons why the defense has had a difficult time this season. It is 
young and inexperienced. Maybe there have been a few coaching mistakes. The 
defensive cupboard has been barren for years at SDSU, and restocking it will 
take time.

<P>
Make all the lists you want. None of them matter. The reality is that this 
year's defense has been disappointing. SDSU coaches sit in their offices, bring 
in fast food for lunch and desperately try to repair it. The Aztecs played well 
Saturday. Now, the goal is to put two weeks of solid defense together . . . and 
then three. 
</P>
<P>
"We just need to go out and play well," he said, quietly. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe then, things would be OK. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, he walked out into the chilly autumn air.

SAGAPOLUTELE TO SEE SOME OLD FRIENDS

San Diego State defensive end Pio Sagapolutele will be seeing plenty of 
familiar faces Saturday when Hawaii plays the Aztecs at San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium. Sagapolutele went to Maryknoll High in Honolulu and one of his 
teammates there was Hawaii quarterback Garrett Gabriel. He is also friends with 
several of the other players. 
</P>
<P>
"We're good friends," Sagapolutele said of Gabriel. "I'm good friends with half 
of the offensive team. . . . When I went back this summer, I said (to Gabriel), 
'Yeah, I'll see you in the backfield.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sagapolutele said the only problem is that Gabriel relays his comments to the 
Hawaii offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
Still, during the summer, Sagapolutele and several of the Rainbow Warriors get 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"I go out with them to dances, and watch movies or for a few beers," 
Sagapolutele said. "It's different when we're on the field, though. They act 
like they're not my friends, and I act like I don't know them." 
</P>
<P>
It should be an interesting weekend for the folks from Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
First, the football team. The Rainbow Warriors will fly to Los Angeles today 
and work out at a high school there. They will take the train to San Diego 
Friday and practice that afternoon at the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Hawaii Alumni Association is promoting "UH Alumni Weekend II", 
with festivities ranging from a pre-game tailgate party in the stadium parking 
lot to a post-game party at a hotel. The SDSU ticket department estimated that 
there will be about 2,000 Hawaii fans in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Aztecs' rousing success against Utah Saturday, Coach Al Luginbill 
does not want two weeks off again anytime soon. "If we could, I'd rather play a 
full schedule without a break . . . 11 straight weeks, and then take a break 
before playing a bowl game," Luginbill said. "It's difficult. I'd just as soon 
not do it. It's a grind." . . . Scouts from nearly 10 NFL teams have requested 
passes for Saturday's game, including representatives from Cleveland, Detroit, 
New York Jets, New York Giants, Seattle and the Los Angeles Rams. Former Ram 
running back Lawrence McCutcheon is the Ram scout. SCOTT MILLER

CHARGERS; 
</P>
<P>
ELWAY PROBABLY WILL START SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Denver quarterback John Elway practiced in a limited capacity Wednesday, which 
means he probably will start Sunday against the Chargers at San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Elway, who suffered a strained arch and an injured big toe in Sunday's 27-22 
loss to Minnesota, is listed as questionable on the Bronco injury report. In a 
conference call Wednesday with San Diego writers, Elway said he thought he 
would be ready by Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I think so," he said. "I'll probably know Friday or Saturday whether or 
not I'll be able to go." 
</P>
<P>
Denver Coach Dan Reeves has a policy that if an offensive player doesn't 
practice on the offensive practice day he won't start. Wednesday was offensive 
practice day. 
</P>
<P>
After practice, Reeves said: "I don't know whether we can tell anything until 
he starts taking handoffs, moving around. We didn't do that today because we 
wanted to give him another day's rest. I'm certainly encouraged by the way he 
looked today." 
</P>
<P>
Charger running back Marion Butts was held out of practice Wednesday to rest a 
thigh injury. Butts is questionable for Sunday's game, and Charger Coach Dan 
Henning said Butts probably will miss today's practice but may be ready by 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Safety Vencie Glenn reaggravated his thigh injury in practice but said he'll be 
fit to play Sunday. Glenn, listed as questionable for Sunday's game, has had an 
assortment of injuries this season, including a concussion, a sprained ankle 
and the hamstring pull. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a nightmare year so far for me," he said. "I ain't never going 
to get used to this." 
</P>
<P>
Injuries have forced him to alter his style. "There are certain plays that you 
might make that you gotta make sure you make the tackle instead of going for 
the ball because you don't have that full ability," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other Chargers who are questionable: Safety Martin Bayless (calf), cornerback 
Gill Byrd (ankle), tackle Leo Goeas (knee) defensive end Burt Grossman 
(fingernail). For the Broncos, running back Sammy Winder (foot) is doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
Elway hurt the Chargers more with his vocal chords than with his arm last 
season when the Broncos defeated the Chargers 16-10 in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers were assessed six offside penalties. Each time, Elway drew them 
off by changing the cadence on his snap count. 
</P>
<P>
What bothers Henning is the not the volume control but the head movement that 
goes with it. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the shotgun quarterbacks move around back there and they're moving 
before the snap," he said. "It's a distraction that should be eliminated." 
</P>
<P>
Said quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver: "John is the master at it. Everything is 
legal as long as you don't get caught. When I can get to the point where I can 
do it and feel comfortable you can bet I'll do it until I get caught." 
</P>
<P>
Said linebacker Billy Ray Smith: "It's really pitiful. I'm not even talking as 
far as hurting the defense. I mean, for the fans it's a drag. You're watching a 
team making yards by getting a guy to jump offsides." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers had issued more than 56,000 tickets by midafternoon Wednesday, 
said Jack Teele, the Chargers' assistant to the president. 
</P>
<P>
Teele said he expects the game to be a sellout by kickoff, but not by 1 p.m. 
today, which is the deadline that has to be met to allow a local telecast. DON

STATE TITLE WITHIN REACH OF TALENT-LADEN VALLEY; 
</P>
<P>
WOMEN: A BLEND OF EXPERIENCED PLAYERS AND STRONG NEWCOMERS COULD ENABLE LADY 
MONARCHS TO WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With three consecutive berths in the state final four, the Valley College 
women's basketball team might finish off a fourth by cutting down the nets on a 
state championship. 
</P>
<P>
Sound sweet? That would be Valley's version of a string quartet. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Michelson has combined the area's best recruiting class with several 
returning players from a state semifinalist last season. He has built a team 
that leaves other coaches quaking. 
</P>
<P>
"They're just going to be awesome," Pierce Coach Rob Dimuro said. "They've got 
to be a pretty good bet to win the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
Point guard Sylvia Castaneda (5-foot-9), who averaged 4.3 assists a game, and 
forwards Ericka Miller (5-9) and Claudia Rocha (5-11) played extensively last 
season. Sophomore guard Tisa Rush (5-6), a former All-City Section player at 
Kennedy High, returns after sitting out a season. 
</P>
<P>
"Those four are really high-quality sophomores," said Michelson, who has led 
Valley to the final four in each of his three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Top freshmen include Falicia Stanley (5-5) of Kennedy and Stacie Toon (6-0) of 
Van Nuys, a pair of first-team Times All-Valley selections. Second-team 
All-Valley selection Katina Mines (5-9) of Sylmar also joins a Valley team that 
was eliminated from the state semifinals last season in a double-overtime loss 
to College of the Sequoias. 
</P>
<P>
Mines is out with a hernia until Nov. 20, but Valley recently defeated Biola, a 
four-year NAIA team, by 10 points in a scrimmage. Valley (30-6 overall and 
Western State Conference champion at 13-2 last season) will open Friday at home 
against MiraCosta. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got 10 quality players," Michelson said. "We're going to go at a pace 
where they can't play 40 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Valley likely will set the pace for teams in the region, but Canyons, Moorpark, 
Ventura, Antelope Valley and Pierce should contend for state tournament berths. 
</P>
<P>
* Canyons (25-8, 11-4 in the WSC) has three starters back from the team that 
made the state final eight last season. Sophomore guards Keira Irwin (seven 
assists a game) and Dee Dee Hinson (10 points a game) will be joined by Shannon 
Solway, a transfer from Eastern Montana and a teammate of Irwin's at Simi 
Valley High. The trio gives Canyons a deadly perimeter game. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be tough to zone," Coach Jeff Dunlap said. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Posey (6-0) returns inside but Dawn Coleman, second in the conference in 
rebounding as a freshman, did not return. Canyons will play its first game, in 
the Golden West tournament, next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
* Moorpark has a 44-8 WSC record in Coach Gary Abraham's four years. Starting 
forward Angie Long (10 points, 9.5 rebounds per game) returns, and Amy Chandler 
(5-5), who played for Cal Lutheran last season, will start at point guard. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark (22-9, 10-3 and the WSC Northern Division champion) will open Friday 
with a road game against defending state champion Golden West. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've got probably more talent than we did last year," Abraham said. 
"We're going to find out how bad or good we are from the start." 
</P>
<P>
* Ventura (23-9, 10-4 in the WSC) qualified for the state tournament last 
season. Marli Mactal, a 5-4 point guard who averaged 3.4 assists a game, is the 
only returning starter. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura will play its first game under new Coach Ned Mircetic on Saturday on 
the road against Hancock. 
</P>
<P>
* Antelope Valley (17-11, 11-1), for the first time, won a share of the 
Foothill Conference championship with a late-season surge before losing in the 
first round of the state tournament to Golden West. 
</P>
<P>
First-year Coach Jackie Lott has two players, Anna Quiles (8.1 ppg) and Belen 
Ocegeura (6 ppg), who played last season, and freshman Lu Lu Vasquez averaged 
19 points a game for Rosamond High. Antelope Valley will tip off Friday with an 
away game against Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
* Pierce (11-17, 3-12 in the WSC) adds Valley transfer Lisa Little (6-1) to 
three returning starters. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be real tough," Dimuro said. "We think we're going to be one of 
the top teams in the state." 
</P>
<P>
Pierce's first game is Friday against Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
* Glendale's new coach, Kathy Pudelko, takes over a team that struggled to a 
3-20 record and a 1-14 WSC mark last season. Glendale will open at home against 
Golden West on Nov. 21. 
</P>
<P>
* Oxnard is attempting to bounce back from a 2-14 WSC conference season, 7-21 
overall. Oxnard will open against Rancho Santiago on Friday at Santa Clara 
High.

HOT GRECO FIRES ON ALL CYLINDERS FOR CRESPI; 
</P>
<P>
WATER POLO: CELT SENIOR SCORES 11 GOALS IN 22-3 PLAYOFF WIN OVER THOUSAND OAKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Crespi High senior Vince Greco struck from all points Wednesday. In his team's 
first-round Southern Section 3-A Division playoff match against Thousand Oaks, 
Greco scored on breakaways, in close to the net, from the middle of the pool 
and even by deflecting passes into the Thousand Oaks net. 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, Greco lofted a shot toward the Thousand Oaks goal while 
facing his own goal. The shot missed, but without even looking Greco nearly 
added to his total. He finished with a game-high 11 goals in Crespi's 22-3 
victory at Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
"Vince Greco had just a phenomenal game," said Crespi Coach Jeff Thornton, 
whose team improved to 22-2. "Besides scoring 11, he set up four or five other 
goals and I consider that equally important. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a great all-around player who can do it all." 
</P>
<P>
When Greco wasn't scoring, other Celts were. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Vincze added five goals, Paul Suppa scored twice and Jason Mitchell, Jean 
Michel, T. J. Greene and Rusty King each added one goal. 
</P>
<P>
After sharing the San Fernando Valley League championship with Harvard, Crespi 
won a coin toss to decide the league's top representative for the playoffs. 
Thousand Oaks (11-11) finished third in the Marmonte League behind Royal and 
Agoura, teams ranked in the 3-A top 10 most of the season. Crespi is ranked 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
"When we came in, we knew it wouldn't be a hard game," Greco said, "but we 
wanted to play hard, intensity-wise." 
</P>
<P>
Before even diving into the pool, Thousand Oaks was at a disadvantage. Coach 
Bill Douglas had suspended two starters and three substitutes who had missed a 
practice in preparation for the first-round match. Douglas had to promote four 
players from the junior varsity to replenish the roster, but the second-year 
coach made no excuses about the defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"When our JVs were in the water, they played up," Douglas said. "We did make 
some bad passes, but overall I feel like we were outclassed." 
</P>
<P>
One of the junior varsity players, sophomore Mark McKenna, scored twice for 
Thousand Oaks and Chuck Scherrei added a goal with 20 seconds left.

Bongarra could be one of the Mustangs' key players when they play host to 
Westmont in the NAIA District 3 championship match Saturday at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
With leading scorer Chris Palm (16 goals, 10 assists) suspended for the match 
-- Palm was issued a red card in Tuesday's 7-1 win over Azusa Pacific -- 
Bongarra and teammate Randy Whitfield will need to pick up the scoring slack 
for Master's (8-10-3). 
</P>
<P>
Bongarra, a freshman from Buenos Aires, had two goals and an assist against 
Azusa Pacific, bringing his season totals to seven goals and eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an outstanding dribbler," Master's Coach Mark Schubert said. "He's very 
deceiving. You think he's one place and he's really (in) another." 
</P>
<P>
Master's, without Palm, will need all of Bongarra's tricks to beat Westmont. 
The Warriors are the defending District 3 champion.

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
LONG BEACH'S ALLEN ALL EARS IN SCOUTING NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Among those who apparently could not find a seat at North Campus Stadium last 
week was George Allen, the 72-year-old, first-year football coach at Cal State 
Long Beach, Cal State Northridge's opponent Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Allen was seen standing behind the Northridge bench during the game against Cal 
Poly San Luis Obispo. Well, actually he was reportedly leaning -- so as to 
listen in as Mark Banker, CSUN's defensive coordinator, plotted adjustments 
during the game. 
</P>
<P>
From all indications, Allen and the 49ers are taking the nonconference game 
against Northridge very seriously. And with reason. 
</P>
<P>
It is a nonconference game and the Division I 49ers are heavy favorites over 
the Division II Matadors. But Long Beach needs victories in its final two games 
against CSUN and Nevada Las Vegas to finish with a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps equally significant, Allen has a personal streak going. 
</P>
<P>
The former coach of both the Rams and Redskins never had a losing season in 14 
years in professional football. As a college coach, Allen was 49-33-7 at 
Morningside College (1948-50) and Whittier College (1951-56). 
</P>
<P>
A losing record this season would be Allen's first since Whittier finished 
3-6-1 in 1954. That was also the year in which Allen last scouted a college 
game. Before last Saturday, that is. 
</P>
<P>
Getting offensive: Freddie Bradley of Moorpark College and Jeff Barrett of 
Santa Monica have been selected as the Western State Conference co-offensive 
players of the week. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, who is averaging more than 210 yards rushing a game, gained 279 yards 
in 37 carries and scored five touchdowns in the Raiders' 49-29 win against 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett, a 1988 graduate of Burroughs High, completed 23 of 36 passes for 296 
yards and three touchdowns in Santa Monica's 47-28 victory over Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
Domino effect: Every time Bradley begins rolling, records start to fall. 
</P>
<P>
With five touchdowns and 32 points last week, Bradley set a school single-game 
scoring record and pushed his season scoring total to 148 points, surpassing 
Mike Crawford's 1982 total of 140. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley also moved up on national lists. He ranks second in career all-purpose 
rushing yards, in a dead heat with Estrus Crayton of Rancho Santiago, who has 
3,751 yards. With two games remaining, Bradley is less than 400 yards from the 
career all-purpose running mark and less than 500 yards from the single-season 
all-purpose running record. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has 1,686 rushing yards to rank 12th, five yards behind Blaise Bryant, 
formerly of Golden West, on the single-season list. His 2,952 career yards 
places him eighth on that list. 
</P>
<P>
Statwatch: Tailback Albert Fann of Northridge will need some help to break the 
1,000-yard rushing barrier this season. Fann needs 82 yards to reach 1,000, but 
he is not expected to play in CSUN's regular-season finale against Cal State 
Long Beach. Northridge will have to make the playoffs for Fann to get another 
shot. In addition, Fann needs 80 yards to move into 17th place on the NCAA 
Division II career rushing list. Fann has 4,090 yards. Johnny Bailey, who 
played for Texas A&amp;I from 1986-89, is Division II's all-time leader with 
6,320 yards. . . . Glendale punter Martin Boskovich is ranked seventh in the 
state with a 40.3-yard average. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Lori Mertes, middle blocker for the Pierce women's volleyball team, started the 
week ranked ranked second in the Western State Conference in kill percentage 
(.345), and tied for fourth in stuff blocks (35 in 15 matches). . . . 
</P>
<P>
Shana Wilson, a right-side hitter from CSUN, put away a season-high 16 kills in 
a win over St. Mary's last weekend. The transfer from De Anza College led CSUN 
with a .650 hitting percentage.

RAMONA COACH GALLI QUITTING AT END OF SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One career victory shy of 100, Ramona Coach Mel Galli might have only one shot 
left -- Friday night against Rancho Bernardo -- to reach the milestone. 
</P>
<P>
Galli, the Bulldogs' football coach for the past three years, is retiring from 
coaching at the end of this season. 
</P>
<P>
Galli, 43, has accepted a position as Ramona's dean of students and also will 
relinquish his duties as athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona, which made the playoffs for the first time in school history last year, 
is 4-5, 2-4, heading into Friday's game against Rancho Bernardo at Ramona. A 
victory might put the Bulldogs in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually I decided a couple of years that I was only going to do the job at 
Ramona for a maximum of three years," said Galli, who retired once before after 
stays at Carlsbad High (eight years) and schools in Utah and Washington. "I 
really didn't know if I was going to stay at Ramona or move somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Galli said when he got the job as dean, it became official. He was retiring 
from coaching. 
</P>
<P>
He did, however, add: "This time I'm not quite as naive to think I'll never 
coach again. In the back of my mind, I just can't quite picture (not coaching). 
Everyone that really knows me, knows it will be hard to picture me not 
(coaching)." 
</P>
<P>
In another coaching change, Fred Sills has resigned as girls' volleyball coach 
at Southwest High. Sills, however, will remain as boys' volleyball coach and 
athletic director. JIM LINDGREN

POWAY GETS A THIRD CHANCE AT TORREY PINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Torrey Pines High and Poway High will meet in finals of the San Diego Section 
girls' tennis 3-A playoffs for the second year in a row and fourth time in six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-A finals, La Jolla will make its 12th appearance in 13 years against 
first-time participant San Pasqual. La Jolla has won nine championships. 
</P>
<P>
All four schools advanced by winning semifinal matches Wednesday. The finals 
are Saturday at the Canyon Hills Tennis Club with the 2-A beginning at noon and 
the 3-A at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Torrey Pines defeated No. 4 Mira Mesa, 13-5. No. 2 Poway advanced 
over No. 3 Bonita Vista, 11-7, by winning seven of nine doubles matches. 
</P>
<P>
Poway, the 1989 champion, had just three starters returning this year so it was 
a bit of a surprise to Coach Evi Yarnell that her team again would make the 
finals this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids from the JV worked very hard in the off-season," Yarnell said. "They 
improved tremendously, and we had a very good year." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Yarnell said, it will be difficult to upset Torrey Pines, which soundly 
defeated Poway twice during the regular season. "We have nothing to lose," 
Yarnell said. 
</P>
<P>
Poway's Tasha Frantz won all three of her sets, but the Titans fell behind 4-5 
heading into doubles, where Leah Splavec-Katy Heydon and Jenny Bearden-Missy 
Dulac swept six matches to clinch the victory. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-A semifinals, top-seeded La Jolla (21-1) advanced easily defeating 
three-time defending champion Bishop's, 14-4. The Vikings' LeeAnn Rostovsky, 
Lynn Coakley and Renee Gold swept nine singles sets. Bishop's finished 15-6. 
</P>
<P>
No. 2 San Pasqual, which narrowly avoided an upset Tuesday beating Coronado by 
an eight-game tiebreaker, had another close one Wednesday, winning 10-8 over 
USDHS (13-4). 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles' top two players, Molly Gavin and Britt Stenstrom, swept their 
singles matches to give San Pasqual a 6-3 lead. Paloma Vanderzanden and Amber 
Gonzalez teamed to win two of three doubles sets. Andrea Phillips-Jennifer 
Mulder and Annette Stehly-Summer Tubbs won their final doubles sets to win it 
for San Pasqual (21-1).

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: RANCHO BUENA VISTA'S PARKER SAYS HE'LL ATTEND UCSB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Darryl Parker, one of only two juniors selected to The Times All-County boys' 
basketball team last season and considered one of the county's top recruits, 
has made a verbal commitment to UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, a 6-foot-6 senior at Rancho Buena Vista, said he will sign with the 
Gauchos during the early signing period for college recruits, Nov. 14-21. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, the son of former NBA player Sonny Parker, averaged 24 points and 14 
rebounds in 1989-90, leading the Longhorns to a 16-10 record and the 
quarterfinals of the San Diego Section Division I playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
He chose UCSB, which finished 21-9 last year after a second-round loss in the 
NCAA Tournament, over Cal State Long Beach and Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as a kid being able to do it all, he's the best I've ever had," said 
Rancho Buena Vista Coach John O'Neill, who is in his 18th year coaching. "I 
think he's going to have an outstanding college career. (UCSB coaches) speak of 
him up there as a player who is going to be a starter for three years."

ELECTION LOSSES SEEN AS BLOW TO BUSH PRESIDENCY 
</P>

<P>
Republican losses in Tuesday's elections after heavy campaigning by President 
Bush have weakened not only the party but his presidency, political analysts 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic gains of one Senate seat and nine House seats in an already 
overwhelmingly Democratic Congress will make Bush's job of governing more 
difficult during the remainder of his term, political advisers and observers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
So will the continuing divisions within the President's own party, especially 
the anger of conservatives over Bush's decision to accede to higher taxes as 
part of the recent deficit-reduction package. Many of them already are 
attributing the Republican losses to the tax issue and what they describe as 
the White House's bungling of budget negotiations with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"The presidency is in trouble," said Lyn Nofziger, who served as former 
President Ronald Reagan's political director, "not only because of the fact 
(that) the losses will be placed on the President because he abandoned his 
pledge not to raise taxes, but because, if we're heading into a recession, it 
will be more difficult for him to recoup." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, most analysts said that, barring a deep recession, Bush has 
emerged from the elections in relatively good shape to run for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Although the GOP lost gubernatorial races in the key states of Florida and 
Texas, Republican candidates won in four other states considered crucial in 
presidential races: California, Illinois, Ohio and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
"My presidential election strategy always has been that you can win by carrying 
California and two of the other three (Midwest) states," said Robert Teeter, a 
key Bush political adviser who insisted that Republican candidates "did almost 
as well as could be expected." 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater declared that the history 
of elections in non-presidential election years shows that this year's loss of 
congressional seats by the GOP was not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't do too bad," Fitzwater said. "The President campaigned in a lot of 
races. Some we won, some we lost . . . . When the final record of the 1990 
elections is written, we believe the Republican Party will be strong and its 
leadership secure." 
</P>
<P>
Although the loss of nine Republican seats in the House might not appear 
unusual for an off-year election, it was significant because the GOP entered 
the election holding only 176 of 435 seats. Moreover, the divisions within 
Bush's own party in the House further dilute his influence there. 
</P>
<P>
No one better personifies the division than Edward J. Rollins, director of the 
Republican Congressional Campaign Committee. Right up until the election, 
Rollins was advising GOP congressional candidates to dissociate themselves from 
the President during the campaign because of Bush's reneging on his tax pledge. 
A number of candidates did just that. 
</P>
<P>
Rollins said Wednesday that Bush will find it difficult to bring back into his 
political camp those blue-collar Democrats and conservative Republicans who 
supported him in 1988 but since have defected because of the tax issue. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most bitter losses for Bush occurred in his home state of Texas, 
where Democrat Ann Richards defeated Clayton W. Williams Jr. in the governor's 
race. It was Richards who poked fun at Bush during a keynote address at the 
1988 Democratic convention, declaring that he was "born with a silver foot in 
his mouth." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, known to have been highly incensed over Richards' barbs, put the full 
prestige of his presidency into the campaign to defeat her, traveling to Texas 
last Friday and remaining there to campaign for Williams right up until the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats could hardly contain their glee over the losses that Republicans 
suffered in areas where Bush had campaigned heavily. "He made the Texas race 
his race," said former Democratic Party Chairman John C. White, a Texan who is 
now a Washington consultant. "He didn't invest that much time in any other 
state, and Texas clearly rejected him." 
</P>
<P>
Bush will "have a hard time governing now because nobody will be scared of him 
going into their district to campaign against them," White said. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Party Chairman Ron Brown said that 14 of 18 Republican candidates 
for whom Bush campaigned heavily lost in Tuesday's balloting. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a referendum on the leadership of George Bush, and he failed," Brown 
said. "He went to the American people, almost begging them to send him more 
Republicans. What they did was send him more Democrats." 
</P>
<P>
Brown and other Democrats insisted that the election results show Bush is 
vulnerable in 1992 and could lose in the electoral-rich states of Florida and 
Texas, which he carried in 1988. But other analysts pointed out that 
controlling a statehouse or congressional seats is becoming less and less 
important in determining the winner of a presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who thinks Bush is going to lose Florida or Texas because they won't 
have Republican governors doesn't know what he's talking about," said Peter 
Teeley, a longtime Bush adviser. "He won't, unless the economy really goes 
bad." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the country is on the brink of war in the Persian Gulf and on the 
brink of a recession at home is an overriding factor in assessing Bush's 
reelection chances in the wake of the elections, analysts stressed. 
</P>
<P>
"President Bush is facing some serious challenges in the next two years," said 
Richard B. Wirthlin, a Republican pollster who has advised both Bush and 
Reagan. "There are high political risks in the Middle East, and the economy is 
dicey. He comes out of the election slightly bruised, but clearly not highly 
vulnerable. I believe (that) unless there's a severe recession in '91 or '92, 
he'll be in a good position for reelection." 
</P>
<P>
Polls indicate that GOP candidates would have fared even worse if the election 
had taken place a couple of weeks earlier, when press coverage was still 
focused on the budget negotiations and Bush's attempt to blame Democrats for 
tax increases that he had accepted as part of the deficit deal. 
</P>
<P>
In the final two weeks of the campaign, coverage focused more heavily on Bush's 
attacks on Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and the Administration's threats to 
use force if necessary to drive Iraqi troops out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"If the election had been held 10 days earlier," Wirthlin said, "we could have 
had a Republican-George Bush meltdown." 
</P>
<P>
Wirthlin said that his national polls as of Oct. 22 showed the Democrats with a 
14-point edge in voters who identified with their party. A margin that large 
could have indicated a possible Republican loss of 20 House seats, two or three 
Senate seats and four or five governorships. 
</P>
<P>
"The last five days were good for Bush and the Republicans," Wirthlin said. 
"The President's job rating went from 50% to 59%, and Democratic Party 
identification went from a 14-point edge to 4 points the night before the 
election."

Legislative leaders, angered by voter approval of a measure to limit their 
terms, Wednesday began exploring legal challenges to Proposition 140, 
contending it is unconstitutional to let voters at large kick out lawmakers 
elected by constituents in their home districts. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, lawmakers, their staffs and lobbyists were pondering what the 
fed-up California electorate had wrought by sending most incumbents back to 
Sacramento while handing every member of the Legislature a political pink slip. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to limiting Assembly members to six years in office and state 
senators to eight, the landmark ballot initiative also caps at eight years the 
service of statewide officers, slashes the Legislature's operating budget by as 
much as 50% and eliminates the lawmakers' pension program, all in a move its 
authors predict will return power to "citizen politicians." 
</P>
<P>
But the professionals who were the target of the term-limit movement complained 
bitterly that the measure will usher in an era of amateurism in which the 
public's elected representatives will be outsmarted and outlasted by 
big-business lobbyists and lifetime bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it personally insulting and stupid," said one of the Assembly's senior 
members, Democrat John Vasconcellos of Santa Clara. "Now we won't have an 
independent, well-informed legislative branch of government." 
</P>
<P>
There also was more than a hint of retribution. Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, 
the powerful San Francisco Democrat who has ruled the Legislature's lower house 
for a decade, said he will take out his anger on a handful of Republicans who 
backed the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"The first people to experience staff cuts will be the people who supported 
it," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The measure passed by a margin of about 242,000 votes out of more than 6.6 
million cast. 
</P>
<P>
Some Assembly Republicans, meanwhile, were said to be plotting the overthrow of 
minority leader Ross Johnson of La Habra, who opposed term limits. The party 
had a net loss of two seats to the Democrats on Tuesday, reducing their number 
to just 32 in the 80-member Assembly and providing an ignominious conclusion to 
the GOP's once proud goal of seizing control of the Legislature by 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Bill Jones of Fresno said Wednesday that he has secured commitments 
from enough Republicans to oust Johnson at a meeting scheduled for today in 
Sacramento. But Johnson said he expected to keep his post. 
</P>
<P>
Just five of the 92 incumbent legislators on Tuesday's ballot were defeated. 
Assembly Republicans on the losing end included Sunny Mojonnier of Encinitas, 
Jeff Marston of San Diego and Curt Pringle of Garden Grove, although Pringle's 
result could change as the last of the absentee ballots are counted. Democratic 
Assemblyman Norm Waters of Plymouth in Northern California also was defeated. 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, Democrats gained a seat for a total of 25 with the defeat of 
Republican Jim Nielsen of Rohnert Park by former legislative aide Mike 
Thompson. If the one remaining Senate vacancy goes to the Democrats as 
expected, they would be just one vote short of the two-thirds majority needed 
to override gubernatorial vetoes. In the Assembly the Democrats would need the 
votes of six Republicans to override the governor. 
</P>
<P>
For the vast majority of incumbents who were returned to office, the question 
is whether Proposition 140 will send them packing in six years. Speaker Brown 
and Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti declined to discuss the issue 
with reporters Wednesday. Roberti sent a memo to fellow senators indicating he 
was ready to implement the budget cut part of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
But Roberti's memo also said that the legal issues surrounding implementation 
of the initiative "are under review." Several sources close to Brown and 
Roberti said a legal challenge to term limits was certain to be filed. The 
plaintiff in such a lawsuit would probably be a citizen claiming a violation of 
federal Constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
"What it comes down to is an infringement on the right of the people in any 
district to vote for their own representation," said Joseph Remcho, a San 
Francisco lawyer who has represented Democrats in past efforts to overturn 
voter-approved initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
Remcho said it is one thing for the state's voters to agree to limit the terms 
of statewide officers, such as the governor, whom they elect jointly. But it is 
unfair and unconstitutional, he said, for the voters in one district to decide 
who can or cannot represent voters in another district. 
</P>
<P>
Said Remcho: "The voters in Orange County have told the voters in San Francisco 
that they can't elect Willie Brown. They have told the voters in a whole bunch 
of other districts that they can't elect the representatives of their choice. I 
don't see that they have articulated a state interest compelling enough to 
justify that restriction on my right to vote." 
</P>
<P>
But Lewis K. Uhler, president of the National Tax-Limitation Committee and one 
of the authors of Proposition 140, said a legal challenge by incumbent 
legislators would be "almost an obscenity." And Los Angeles County Supervisor 
Pete Schabarum, who co-wrote the measure, said he would personally lead the 
effort to defend the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not enthusiastic, given the way the courts have been acting these days, 
that we have a guarantee of this whole proposition being sustained," Schabarum 
said. "But we'll do the best we can." 
</P>
<P>
If Proposition 140 does withstand challenge, it will take effect in stages. 
First will come the elimination of future pension benefits for anyone elected 
in Tuesday's balloting and from now on. Then, next year, the Legislature's 
operating budget will be cut an estimated 50%, to no more than $950,000 per 
member. The reduction is expected to result in widespread layoffs, a source of 
anxiety to many Capitol staffers. 
</P>
<P>
The real blow from Proposition 140 will come in 1996, when anyone elected to 
the Assembly this year, along with 20 state senators who now are in the middle 
of a term, will be forced to leave office. Two years later, the rest of the 
state Senate and all statewide officeholders elected this week will be forced 
out.

GUARD IS ARRESTED IN UNIVERSAL STUDIOS FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A Universal Studios security guard who had been on the job less than two months 
was arrested Wednesday in the multimillion-dollar arson fire that gutted part 
of the historic studio's back lot, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze destroyed sets used in such pictures as "Dick Tracy" and "The Sting" 
and delayed production of the latest Sylvester Stallone film. 
</P>
<P>
Michael J. Huston, 40, of Tujunga was booked on suspicion of arson at 4 a.m. 
Wednesday after discrepancies arose in his answers to fire investigators' 
questions, arson experts said. 
</P>
<P>
Huston, an employee of Burns International Security Services, which contracts 
to provide security for the studio, was on duty when the fire broke out shortly 
after 7 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities had no immediate comment on a motive for the fire. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect's half brother described him as a mentally disabled Army veteran 
who was incapable of such a crime. 
</P>
<P>
But Huston's grandmother later told a local television station that the suspect 
told her, "I did it." 
</P>
<P>
Universal officials said 20% of the sets on the sprawling, 420-acre lot -- also 
a popular tourist attraction -- were destroyed in the stubborn, wind-whipped 
blaze. Most of the damage was to wooden facades that burned like matchboxes, 
Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
It took 400 Los Angeles city and county firefighters nearly three hours to 
extinguish the blaze, which offered an eerie sideshow to Republican Party 
election-night festivities held at the nearby Universal City Hilton hotel. 
Firefighters even used water from the studio's Red Sea tour attraction to douse 
the flames. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fire -- and, in some cases, because of it -- tourists flocked to 
Universal Studios on Wednesday to take the trams that guide visitors by sets 
that have formed the backdrop of movie classics for decades. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday's excursions, tourists could see rubble of what used to be sets 
from "To Kill a Mockingbird," "The Sting" and "Dick Tracy." 
</P>
<P>
Universal officials said the most serious damage was concentrated on several 
outdoor sets, including the two-block-long New York Street, Sting Alley, 
Georgetown Avenue, Warehouse Street and Brownstone Street. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Slusser, general manager of Universal Studios, said it would take about six 
months to rebuild the sets. He said an estimate of the damage, which parent 
company MCA said is covered by insurance, would not be available for a couple 
of days but would be in the "millions, not the hundreds of millions." 
</P>
<P>
The fire also interrupted production of the John Landis-directed movie "Oscar," 
a comedy starring Stallone, which had been shooting on the back lot only hours 
before the fire broke out. 
</P>
<P>
The movie's publicist, Spooky Stevens, said the entire set was lost, forcing 
the crew to shut down production for up to 10 days while looking for a new 
location to shoot outdoor scenes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nightmare, but it's not an impossible nightmare," she said. "We've lost 
a lot of our wardrobe, all the camera equipment, 21 vintage cars and all of our 
props." 
</P>
<P>
Replacing costumes and props is complicated, she said, because the film is a 
period piece, set in 1931, with Stallone playing a gangster who tries to go 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens said the production crew had started shooting on the outdoor set last 
Thursday and had only four or five more days of filming scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
A temporary casualty was the King Kong exhibit, part of Universal's popular 
studio tour. It was closed Wednesday, but damage turned out to be less than 
originally believed, studio officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire burned the wooden exterior of the building that houses King Kong, but 
water sprinklers were activated by the heat and helped to save the giant 
mechanical ape and the computers that operate him. 
</P>
<P>
"Kong lives," said Ron Bension, president of Universal Studios-Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
None of the sound stages where many television shows and movies are produced 
were damaged, Universal officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire investigators declined to release further details of their probe into the 
cause of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Dale Underwood of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's arson unit said the 
security guard was questioned as a matter of routine, but his statements 
immediately raised flags. 
</P>
<P>
"In a situation like that you talk to everybody who might know something," 
Underwood said. "We are confident we have enough evidence to arrest and file on 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Huston was jailed in lieu of $1 million bail. 
</P>
<P>
William Ewing, president of the Western states unit of Burns International 
Security Services, said, "We are all saddened as a result of this fire and 
arrest of one of our security officers. Burns International is cooperating 
fully with law enforcement authorities." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Dragusica, 22, who said he is Huston's half brother, was reached at the 
family's home in Tujunga on Wednesday afternoon. He said Huston has been 
mentally disabled since serving in the Army in Vietnam in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
Dragusica said that while it is unlikely his brother would have intentionally 
started the fire, his mental condition might have led him to confess to 
something he did not do. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't do it," Dragusica said. "I know my brother and he would not want to 
harm anybody or hurt anything. The guy has problems. He is mentally disabled 
and hadn't worked a job for 10 years before this. Now they are putting this on 
him. All I can say is that if he did it, it was an accident." 
</P>
<P>
Dragusica said his brother has seen a psychiatrist regularly for seven years 
and has often sought help from the Veterans Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Huston's grandmother, Dorothy Montanari, told KCAL, Channel 9, news that her 
grandson confessed to her. 
</P>
<P>
"He just said 'I did it,' and he said you saw the fire on TV; 'I did it and I'm 
going to jail,' " Montanari said. "I just couldn't believe it. And he said 'I 
love you,' and I said I love you and will help you as much as I can." 
</P>
<P>
Residents along the quiet Tujunga street of small homes, owned mostly by 
retired people, described Huston as a good neighbor who often volunteered to 
help others with household chores. 
</P>
<P>
One neighbor said the suspect worked odd jobs, such as painting and lawn care, 
in the Tujunga area until taking the job as a security guard with Burns about 
two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me he worked at Universal," said the neighbor, George Fluman. "He just 
said he was a guard there. I saw him go to work in his uniform in the 
mornings." 
</P>
<P>
Huston, who is not married and lives with his mother and half brother, once 
told Fluman that he received a disability pension for a respiratory ailment he 
suffered while in the military. The neighbor expressed shock when told of 
Huston's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't believe that," Fluman said. "I know him real well. He is a great 
neighbor. I'd trust him with my bottom dollar."

FEINSTEIN CONCEDES DEFEAT, LOOKS AHEAD

If it was an act, it was the best act of her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
On the day after the 1990 gubernatorial election, Democratic candidate Dianne 
Feinstein strode into a press conference to acknowledge her defeat by 
Republican Pete Wilson with the air of someone who has experienced a minor 
setback. She was upbeat, and her eyes seemed focused already on a race for the 
U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
If tears had been shed, hands wrung, mistakes analyzed and strategies 
second-guessed during the long vote tally that brought her close but not close 
enough, Feinstein gave no hint of it. Instead, she joked with reporters, hugged 
campaign workers and spoke brightly of a future in politics. 
</P>
<P>
"All my life has been public service," she said. " . . . It's what I want to 
continue to do, one way or another. The only question is how, when and where." 
</P>
<P>
While insisting no announcement was imminent, she said a Senate race was 
"certainly an option." In two years, Democrat Alan Cranston's U.S. Senate seat 
is up for election and Wilson's appointed successor also will face the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Although the concession call to Wilson had not been made until nearly 10 a.m., 
campaign chairman Duane Garrett said Feinstein had been quietly advised in the 
early morning that she had no chance of winning. She took the news 
philosophically, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein herself admitted to reporters that she had a feeling she was not 
going to win. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a small sense of foreboding, to be perfectly honest," she said. " . . . 
I've learned to trust my vibrations in this business and my vibrations were 
that it would take an awful (lot) to catch up." 
</P>
<P>
For Feinstein, the election results ended a roller-coaster campaign, one that 
began with even her having little hope of victory. As a former mayor who had 
been out of office for two years, she faced state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de 
Kamp in the primary. Van de Kamp had name recognition in the state and a hefty 
campaign war chest. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, today was not the worst day of this campaign," Garrett said. "I mean, we 
came from nowhere. Early on we had a campaign manager quit by fax. We were 17 
points down in the polls. All of our friends were urging us to drop out. In 
December of 1989 we were within an inch of being out of the race." 
</P>
<P>
He said Feinstein decided she would continue, but conceded to him privately in 
January that her chances of winning were "pretty thin." He said she only began 
to consider victory in November a real possibility when she upset Van de Kamp 
in the primary. 
</P>
<P>
Citing earlier political defeats and misfortunes in her personal life, 
Feinstein's longtime friends insisted her buoyant mood Wednesday was genuine. 
</P>
<P>
"She's dealt with so much tragedy in her life she's learned how to accept it 
and internalize it and deal with it," said Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-South 
San Francisco.) "When she was young she had a mother who was desperately 
mentally ill. She divorced her first husband and was a single parent for a 
period of time. He second husband died of cancer and she lost twice for mayor. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, in Speier's view, Feinstein did not see the election totally as a 
personal defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"She really believes that she has opened the doors for women and that she has 
set the stage for more opportunities for women, and that's a victory."

MIX OF FEAR, FRUSTRATION BRING STRONG VOTER DISCONTENT

Call it bewilderment. Call it anger. 
</P>
<P>
California voters Tuesday cared more about abortion rights than any other 
issue, according to Times exit polls. But Dianne Feinstein, who used the issue 
as a sword in her gubernatorial campaign, lost. 
</P>
<P>
They cared about crime, but hefty anti-crime packages also lost. They did not 
admit to worrying about taxes -- but 12 of 14 bond issues were voted down, 
reversing historic trends. 
</P>
<P>
The political atmosphere in California was rumbling with discontent Wednesday, 
as politicians and analysts read election results like would-be tea leaves. And 
the more they looked, the worse it seemed. 
</P>
<P>
"For the life of me, find a common thread that united the three successful 
initiatives -- gill nets, term limits and prison labor," said Eugene Lee, a UC 
Berkeley political scientist. 
</P>
<P>
Pollsters and politicians said Wednesday that the seemingly quixotic reactions 
were the result of voters' commingling of two emotions -- fear and frustration. 
</P>
<P>
Voters, they said, were angry at public officials and simultaneously fretting 
about the tender economic situation in California and the rest of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The result: Voters approved offering incentives for earthquake retrofitting, 
banning gill nets in fishing, allowing prison inmates to work for private 
businesses, and limiting the terms in office of legislators and state 
constitutional officers -- actions which did not carry a financial burden. 
</P>
<P>
They also sanctioned a $400-million bond issue for veterans' housing and an 
$800-million series of bonds for classroom construction. 
</P>
<P>
But defeated were measures that might have skated through only a few months ago 
-- college and prison construction bonds, housing and parks and recreation 
bonds. All told, six of the 28 measures on the ballot were approved and the 
remainder quashed. 
</P>
<P>
Voter approval, officials in the various campaigns agreed, required a huge well 
of faith this year -- and faith in elected officials was in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
"Those seeking a yes vote walked into yesterday's election with the deck 
stacked against them," said Joel Fox, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers' 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The results marked a huge turnabout from the last statewide election in June. 
Then, $5.14 billion in bonds were on the ballot -- and all were approved by 
voters. This time, $5.77 billion in bonds were up for a vote -- and only $1.2 
billion prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
Defeat was laid largely on the roiling national environment. Since June, when 
California voters doubled their own gas tax voluntarily, the Persian Gulf 
stalemate has sent gasoline prices soaring. Voters have been treated to a 
caustic, months-long federal budget wrangle. Indicators of a national recession 
seem to be multiplying. "You come to the conclusion that now is not the time to 
spend money. And if you lack confidence in those who are going to spend it, 
you're going to be doubly conscious of spending," said Steven A. Merksamer, a 
longtime associate of Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of confidence in elected officials and the direction in which they 
are taking the state rang clearly through Times voters' surveys Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Almost two of every five people, for example, felt that California has "gotten 
off on the wrong track," and only 10% felt that the state was moving in the 
"right direction." Almost twice as many people thought the economy was bad as 
thought it was good. 
</P>
<P>
Almost two-thirds said the quality of life in California in the past decade has 
worsened, while a scant 15% thought life was better than a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
In a September survey by The Times, voters blamed the Legislature for "failing 
to do its job" and, in effect, forcing issues to be dealt with by initiative. 
Against that backdrop, voter approval of Proposition 140, the term limits 
initiative, seemed predictable. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative will limit Assembly members to six years in office and senators 
and constitutional officers to eight years. It also slices legislative pensions 
and operating budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the measure said they are considering a legal challenge to the 
constitutionality of Proposition 140 and blamed voter cynicism for the term 
limits victory. 
</P>
<P>
"If it had been a shorter ballot, we might have had a cleaner chance," 
</P>
<P>
Said Jay Ziegler, a spokesman for the campaign against term limits: "1990 
signals a lot of people being very skeptical about issues appearing on the 
ballot. I think we were a victim of that in the end." 
</P>
<P>
The failure of most bond measures was seen by the anti-tax movement as evidence 
that the state's vaunted anti-tax mood was swelling. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last decade, voters had approved all but three of 47 bond measures 
presented to them. The failure of 12 this time marked the worst such record 
since the tax revolt decade of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
But the defeat of Proposition 136 defied the argument that the ballot of 1990 
saw a resurgence of anti-tax fervor. The proposition requiring two-thirds of 
the state's voters to approve special taxes would have seemed fitting for a 
no-tax mood. Proponents blamed the defeat on a confusing ballot title: "State, 
Local Taxation." 
</P>
<P>
"People read it as a tax increase," said Fox, who backed the measure. 
</P>
<P>
But others suggested that voters were not taking a knee-jerk reaction to 
increasing spending but merely emphasizing their objections to the initiative 
process by voting no so often. 
</P>
<P>
A recent Times survey showed that 72% of voters thought the initiative process 
was "out of control," and 84% said the proliferation of initiatives meant that 
"an average voter cannot make an intelligent choice." 
</P>
<P>
Some saw a sobering development in the low voter turnout -- 54% as of Wednesday 
and expected to rise to 59% at most when all absentee votes are calculated. 
That would be among the lowest turnout rates since the century began, and 
several analysts blamed the initiatives for turning off voters.

Followers of the slain militant nationalist Rabbi Meir Kahane went on violent 
hunts for Palestinians and journalists along the route of his funeral Wednesday 
and mingled shouts of "Death to the Arabs!" with prayers for the dead at the 
burial. 
</P>
<P>
Police estimated the funeral crowd at 15,000, larger than Kahane usually 
attracted over the years at his bitterly anti-Arab political rallies. Small 
groups of youthful members of his Kach movement also chased away an Israeli 
television crew and shattered windows in a Jerusalem shopping center while 
pursuing Palestinian workers. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to head off violence, 2,500 police reinforcements had stationed 
themselves at major intersections on the three-mile funeral route between a 
seminary run by Kahane and the Givat Shaul cemetery on Jerusalem's outskirts. 
Jerusalem and other parts of Israel have been under the sway of a series of 
intercommunal knifings and revenge attacks for the past month. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the police presence, clusters of mourners periodically broke out of the 
procession, urged on by calls of "There's an Arab. Let's get him." 
</P>
<P>
On one street in the Givat Shaul neighborhood, an Arab passenger traveling on a 
bus was pulled out and kicked and trampled by a mainly youthful mob. Police 
intervened, and the man was carried by stretcher to an ambulance as the crowd, 
including men, women and children, surged menacingly toward him and shouted for 
death. 
</P>
<P>
A knifing of another Arab was reported near the vegetable market in central 
Jerusalem and another beating near the cemetery. Police reported four 
Palestinians and two police officers were injured and that 13 rioters were 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the danger engulfing us now -- that Kahane's murder will spark a dizzy 
cycle of further murders," Yediot Aharonot, the country's largest-circulation 
newspaper, warned earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Journalists also were targeted by hostile mourners. A group assaulted an 
Israeli television crew and chased it into its studios, which were then 
bombarded by stones. Marchers also hurled rocks at photographers covering the 
burial. 
</P>
<P>
Kahane supporters complained that reporters ignored the fiery activist while he 
was alive. They also expressed resentment of Israel's political leadership for 
having ostracized Kahane. The Brooklyn-born rabbi was forbidden to run in the 
1988 elections for Parliament on the grounds that his Kach movement was racist. 
Kahane had won a parliamentary seat during the 1984 elections. 
</P>
<P>
The focus of Kach's platform is the removal of Arabs from Israel as well as the 
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Energy Minister Yuval Neeman was shouted away from paying condolences at an 
afternoon memorial service. Later, Rehavim Zeevi, the founder of the 
ultranationalist Faithful of the Israeli Homeland Party, was also jeered at the 
burial site and left hurriedly. Both Neeman and Zeevi are considered 
hard-liners on dealings with Palestinians, and Zeevi favors the expulsion of 
Arabs from the West Bank and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, police sources said the investigation continues to point strongly 
to the theory that El-Sayyid A. Nosair acted alone when he allegedly killed 
Kahane. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said detectives were told by people who knew Nosair well that the 
34-year-old city air-conditioning repairman, who worked in a criminal courts 
building in Manhattan, had been angry and depressed recently. 
</P>
<P>
Nosair's two lockers at the courthouse were opened by detectives and a number 
of papers in Arabic were removed for translation. Other papers and records were 
seized after a search warrant was executed at his home in Cliffside Park, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
But it was understood that translators so far had found nothing in the papers 
to link Nosair to any terrorist group. Also, no group has claimed 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Laboratory technicians examined the .357-caliber Ruger revolver allegedly used 
to shoot Kahane. They found that attempts have been made to obliterate the 
serial number on the gun, and there were signs that attempts also had been made 
to modify the weapon for a silencer. 
</P>
<P>
Late Wednesday, Nosair -- wounded when he was captured -- was arraigned in his 
bed at Bellevue Hospital on five counts, including murder. If convicted, he 
could face 25 years to life on second-degree murder charges alone. 
</P>
<P>
With Kahane's death, the media and politicians that shunned him were induced to 
throw light on his exclusionary politics. Israel Radio gave lengthy 
explanations of how Kahane proposed to expel Arabs: They could take money and 
leave voluntarily or they would be dumped into neighboring Arab countries 
without compensation. 
</P>
<P>
The Knesset, Israel's Parliament, debated Kahane's legacy and the significance 
of his assassination, and liberal politician Avraham Burg declared that Kahane 
believed in the ideology of "thou shalt kill." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the ruling, right-wing Likud Party countered that whatever Kahane's 
beliefs, his slaying was an attack on freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
During the memorial service, a Kach activist vowed revenge.

Ever since Iraq overran the rich oil fields of Kuwait, the phone in Kathleen 
Flanigan's Westwood office has not stopped ringing. 
</P>
<P>
"People keep calling just to ask about our technology," explains the 
spokeswoman for one of the country's most successful solar power producers, Los 
Angeles' Luz International. "It's really picked up since Aug. 2." 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that the Iraqi invasion and the subsequent energy crisis have 
focused new public attention on renewable energies -- technologies such as 
solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and hydroelectric that generate electricity 
without the environmental side effects of most fossil fuels. 
</P>
<P>
But, although producers of renewable energy are grateful for the new attention, 
many are irritated that the public still thinks renewable energy is only a 
dream for the future. 
</P>
<P>
"It's out there already," Flanigan says. "And it does work." 
</P>
<P>
Despite sharp cutbacks in federal research and tax support for renewable energy 
technologies, most of them have left the laboratory and are out in the field 
generating electricity. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, 5% of current production of electricity and one-third of all new 
power capacity installed since 1985 has come from solar, wind, geothermal and 
biomass facilities. In California, a full 12% of the state's electricity needs 
are already provided by these sources. 
</P>
<P>
All the same, although industry advocates and producers are proud of their 
progress in the past few years, they point to technological, government and 
business challenges that will confront each of the new technologies in the 
coming decade. Solar Solar technologies can generally be divided into two 
groups: solar thermal systems, which use sunlight to heat water or other 
fluids, and photovoltaic technologies that convert the sun's light directly 
into electricity. In the 1980s, solar thermal technologies made the leap from 
small, modular units designed to heat individual buildings to large, commercial 
electricity-generating systems. Luz International has had the greatest success 
with such systems, using acres of concave mirrors in the Mojave desert to heat 
a special conducting fluid that then superheats water to spin steam turbines. 
Luz supplies a total of 354 megawatts of power to Southern California Edison, 
enough electricity to meet the needs of half a million residential customers. 
As it unveiled a new 80-megawatt plant last month, Luz reported that its costs 
have fallen from 24 cents per kilowatt hour in 1984 to 8 cents today -- a price 
that is becoming competitive with gas, oil and nuclear power, which cost 
between 3 and 7 cents per kilowatt hour. But, although solar thermal power has 
enjoyed some commercial success, it represents only about 0.1% of U.S. electric 
consumption and is not expected to climb much higher. Experts agree that the 
real advances for solar power will come in the second area of solar technology, 
photovoltaics. Photovoltaic technology uses mirrors to concentrate photons of 
sunlight onto silicon cells. The impact of the photons shakes loose silicon 
electrons, whose movement generates electric current. Although the cost of 
photovoltaics has fallen from $1.50 to 30 cents per kilowatt hour over the last 
decade, photovoltaic systems remain much more costly than other energy sources. 
Still, photovoltaic technology is so promising that the government is 
concentrating most of its solar research dollars on it. But solar shares a 
problem with other renewable energy systems: Although they are usually cheap to 
operate, they are expensive to build. This is because the resources -- 
sunlight, subterranean water, wind -- cost almost nothing, but the high-tech 
facilities that change them into electricity are expensive. Facilities that use 
fossil fuels, on the other hand, are cheap to build but require a continuous 
supply of costly oil, gas or coal.Wind Wind energy got an undeservedly bad name 
in the 1970s, proponents insist. As investors rushed to take advantage of the 
tax shelter the federal government offered for renewables, many projects were 
rushed to completion. "The technology simply wasn't ready," says Randall 
Swisher, president of the Washington-based American Wind Energy Assn. "We moved 
wind into manufacturing too rapidly." But in the mid-1980s, after making small 
but crucial improvements, such as washing the turbine blades periodically to 
remove insects, the industry got back on its feet. Now California's 15,000 wind 
turbines operate reliably enough to provide 1,500 megawatts of power to the 
state, enough to supply the residential needs of the City of San Francisco. As 
with solar, the coming challenges for wind power are not primarily 
technological but commercial. In 10 to 20 years, Swisher estimates, wind power 
could go from supplying 0.2% of the nation's electric needs to a full 10%. But 
Tom Besich, power contracts manager for Southern California Edison, says that 
despite its competitive costs (about 7 cents per kilowatt hour), wind is 
unlikely to get much larger, in part because residents find the turbines 
unsightly and in part because the power source is not sufficiently reliable. 
"The problem is that wind isn't predictable. The wind just doesn't blow when 
you need it,"Geothermal Geothermal technologies, which use the heat of the 
Earth's molten core to generate electricity, are also operating commercially in 
California. The largest system is at The Geysers, a sprawling facility 90 miles 
north of San Francisco in Sonoma and Lake counties, that generates 1,350 
megawatts of electricity for Pacific Gas &amp; Electric. It is the 
second-largest source of renewable energy for California and the cheapest -- it 
costs PG&amp;E only 2 1/2 cents per kilowatt hour, far less than the 6 to 8 
cents it costs for natural gas or oil. But geothermal still supplies less than 
0.3% of the nation's electric power and is not expected to grow much more. One 
reason is that there are not many regions of the country where the 
Earth'Biomass Technologies that fall into this category are a hodgepodge 
ranging from plants that burn wood, agricultural and municipal waste to 
high-tech facilities that gasify shrubs. Some, built on top of landfills, 
create electricity from the methane gas that rises off buried garbage. Taken 
together, biomass technologies form the largest source of renewable energy in 
the United States -- a full 5% of national electric use. But environmentalists 
have mixed feelings about biomass. Because it is based on combustion -- the 
same process that generates heat from coal, gas and oil -- it creates more 
pollution than other sources of renewable energy.Hydroelectric Hydroelectric 
power remains the oldest source of electricity from renewable energy in the 
United States and is a close second to biomass in national output, supplying 
about 4.8% of U.S. energy needs. It is also one of the cheapest sources of 
electricity, costing about 2 cents per kilowatt hour. But hydroelectric power 
generation has fallen out of favor in recent years, particularly among 
environmentalists. Many are concerned about disrupting local fish migration and 
causing erosion. The Energy Department says more than 180 hydroelectric 
projects will come up for relicensing in the next five years, and officials 
expect opposition from residents who would prefer to return dammed areas to 
their natural states. Nonetheless, the department says only 5% of the dams in 
the United States are used for power generation and many more could be tapped 
for energy without increasing environmental risks to the surrounding areas.

Asserting that "the credibility of the United Nations is at stake" in the 
Persian Gulf crisis, Secretary of State James A. Baker III told President 
Turgut Ozal and other Turkish officials Wednesday that Washington soon may ask 
the Security Council for standby authority to use military force against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important that when the United Nations takes action . . . that those 
resolutions and actions be implemented," Baker told reporters after a two-hour 
meeting with Ozal. 
</P>
<P>
A senior State Department official said later that the United States has 
adequate legal authority under the "collective self-defense" provisions of the 
U.N. Charter to take offensive military action against Iraq but that new 
Security Council action would "provide a firmer political basis." 
</P>
<P>
Ozal has said that Turkey will not participate in warfare against Iraq, its 
neighbor to the south, unless the action is specifically authorized by the 
United Nations. Earlier this week, he went so far as to say that Turkey is not 
prepared to launch a "second front" in a U.S.-initiated conflict launched from 
Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Ozal's determination not to get out in front of the Security Council was 
underlined by Suleyman Demirel, leader of the opposition True Path Party, who 
was quoted by the Turkish newspaper Gunaydin: "While war is on the horizon in 
the gulf, Ozal should not make any promises on behalf of the Turkish nation and 
state." 
</P>
<P>
As Baker and Ozal met, Iraq announced that it will free 120 more hostages, most 
of them Germans, after former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt met with 
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. The official Iraqi News Agency reported that 20 
of the hostages being freed will be of other nationalities, including 
Americans, Britons, Italians and others. 
</P>
<P>
The move reflects Baghdad's "appreciation for the German policy, which does not 
support trends toward war," the news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said U.S. officials 
have not yet been notified about plans to free any Americans. But he denounced 
Iraq's "cynical bartering" of captive foreigners, who were trapped by Iraq's 
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 74 Japanese hostages flew to freedom from Iraq aboard a 
charter flight with former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who had 
arranged for their release. Iraq had said 77 Japanese were free to go, but 
three businessmen who had been given permission to leave changed their minds. 
</P>
<P>
In London, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher issued her sternest warning 
yet to Iraq in a speech to a crowded session of Parliament, declaring: "Time is 
running out for Saddam Hussein. . . . Either he gets out (of Kuwait) soon, or 
we and our allies will remove him by force." In that event, she added, "he will 
go down to defeat, with all its consequences." 
</P>
<P>
The senior U.S. official, who talked to reporters aboard Baker's jetliner on a 
flight from Ankara to Moscow, said the possibility of additional Security 
Council action is on the agenda for all of Baker's stops on his weeklong, 
seven-nation swing through the Middle East and Europe. But the issue took on 
additional significance in Turkey because of Ozal's desire to have U.N. cover 
for any action by his formidable army against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The United States holds the presidency of the Security Council this month under 
the U.N.'s rotation system, and the senior official said Washington plans to 
sponsor several new gulf-related resolutions, in addition to the measure 
providing standby authority for military action while it holds the chair. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Baker denied a report, first carried by Israel Army Radio, that he 
had given Iraq an ultimatum to get out of Kuwait within two weeks or face a 
military assault. The Israeli station, quoting diplomatic sources in Cairo, 
said Baker discussed the deadline with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen 
when they met Tuesday at Cairo airport. 
</P>
<P>
In Damascus, a senior U.S. official arrived unexpectedly on Wednesday to brief 
Syrian leaders on Baker's current trip. The official, John Kelly, assistant 
secretary of state for Middle East and South Asian affairs, met with Syrian 
Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh to discuss developments in the gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Baker meets today in Moscow with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and 
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. Both the gulf and arms control are on 
the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
If the United States chooses to ask the Security Council for standby authority 
to use force, Soviet support would be essential.

Every year since he was 20, Anatoly Zhuravlev was ordered to march in official 
parades on Soviet Revolution Day, but on Wednesday the 35-year-old factory 
worker demonstrated proudly against the Bolshevik Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, I feel like a human and not a robot," Zhuravlev said as he 
walked along the Garden Ring Road with his lanky 15-year-old son, Andrei. 
</P>
<P>
"There is something really wonderful about this alternative demonstration -- 
people are marching because they believe in something," Zhuravlev said. 
</P>
<P>
He and his son were among 10,000 liberals who demonstrated against the 1917 
revolution and the society it created in two alternative demonstrations 
authorized by Moscow authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Mournful music played over loudspeakers as people holding homemade signs 
bearing slogans such as "73 Years of Lies and Violence" gathered in downtown 
Moscow on a square in front of Communist Party headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration, called to pay tribute to the victims of decades of 
repression under Soviet rule, took place within view of Red Square, where the 
traditional military parade and march of party supporters was going on. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators called for the resignations of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
and Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, political and economic independence for 
Russia and an end to the Communist Party's control of the government. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd cheered wildly when Russian Federation President Boris N. Yeltsin and 
Moscow Mayor Gavriil K. Popov stopped by after participating in the official 
celebration at Red Square. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a critical moment in the life of our country," Popov said. "Now the time 
has come for each person to rise up and save the country." 
</P>
<P>
Later, the protesters, led by priests and laymen carrying icons, crosses and 
other religious symbols, walked three miles to the apartment building where 
longtime dissident and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Andrei D. Sakharov lived 
until his death last December. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev has had more than enough applause," Mikhail N. Bidosh, 63, a factory 
worker who spent 15 years in Siberian political prison camps under the dictator 
Josef Stalin, said as he walked along. "We need to get rid of him and all 
Communists for good, even if it takes a revolution." 
</P>
<P>
The protesters said they no longer have faith in Gorbachev because he has 
failed to disavow the Communist Party, refuses to share power and has done 
nothing to slow the economic decline.

A U.N. conference ended Wednesday with a declaration committing governments to 
a "global response" to global warming but stopping short of setting targets to 
control the greenhouse gases that cause it. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-point declaration included an appeal for an international global-warming 
treaty with "real commitments" and a pledge to provide developing countries 
with funds to deal with the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-day World Climate Conference, attended by representatives of 137 
countries, was intended to set the stage for negotiations opening in Washington 
in February on an international treaty to be ready for signing in mid-1992. 
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, 40 environmental groups expressed "severe disappointment" 
at the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"In the name of 'compromise,' they failed to meet their responsibility of 
committing industrial nations to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide and 
other greenhouse gases," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, which led opposition against any target-setting, considered 
the U.N. declaration a "good compromise," said its chief delegate, John Knauss. 
</P>
<P>
Knauss said any policy decisions "must be based on the best available economic 
and sociological, as well as scientific, information."

The right-wing Conservative Party gained ground Wednesday against the ruling 
National Party in a parliamentary by-election, indicating that the number of 
whites worried about apartheid reform continues to swell. 
</P>
<P>
The election in Randburg, a suburb northwest of Johannesburg, was seen by both 
parties as an important test of white support for President Frederik W. de 
Klerk's reform initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, the National Party candidate, Marthinus van Schalkwyk, easily won 
the election, 10,882 votes to 1,969. Nevertheless, the pro-apartheid 
Conservative vote in this traditionally liberal district was sharply higher 
than its 755 total in last year's election. 
</P>
<P>
Although that was considerably short of the 4,000 votes that some Conservatives 
had predicted, party leaders said it nevertheless reflects growing 
dissatisfaction with the rapid pace of reform. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk needs to maintain white support for his initiatives as he opens formal 
negotiations with black and white leaders to draw up a new constitution. The 
president has promised to present any new constitution to white voters for 
approval, and the Conservatives hope to muster enough votes to defeat such a 
move. 
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives, who maintain that De Klerk is selling out whites to eventual 
black majority rule, currently hold 40 seats in the 166-seat white chamber of 
Parliament. The National Party controls 93 seats and the anti-apartheid 
Democratic Party 33. 
</P>
<P>
Both Conservatives and Nationalists had gone all-out in the week before the 
Randburg election, with both De Klerk and Conservative Party leader Andries 
Treurnicht addressing town meetings. 
</P>
<P>
The Randburg constituency had been held by Wynand Malan of the liberal 
Democratic Party, who narrowly defeated the National Party candidate last year. 
Malan recently resigned and said he would vote for the National Party 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
The Conservatives never expected to win the election in a district that one 
party official described as "leftist." But party leaders hoped that a strong 
showing would prove that their support is growing, even in liberal areas. 
</P>
<P>
Leonie Steele, the Conservative candidate, campaigned on the theme of swart 
gevaar, or "black danger." A typical Conservative poster read: "FW's New South 
Africa -- Squatters, Economic Collapse, Bloodbath." 
</P>
<P>
"The (African National Congress) already is starting to take over with their 
terrorism in the black townships," said Daan Combrink, a retired oil refinery 
production manager and Conservative campaign worker. "It won't be long before 
it starts in white towns." 
</P>
<P>
Van Schalkwyk, the National Party candidate, relied on De Klerk's coattails, 
urging voters from his party as well as the Democratic Party to vote for him to 
show their support for reform.

U.S. TO WITHDRAW JETS FROM PHILIPPINES;

The Pentagon plans to withdraw all fighter aircraft based in the Philippines by 
September, ending an era at America's oldest overseas military base, U.S. 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the United States will redeploy 48 F-4 Phantom tactical 
fighter-bombers now stationed at giant Clark Air Base, as well as more than 
1,800 military personnel assigned to them. 
</P>
<P>
Despite previous plans, none of the Vietnam War-era jets will be replaced by 
more sophisticated F-15 Eagle aircraft, the officials said. The F-15s will go 
instead to Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
The move, announced shortly after White House special negotiator Richard L. 
Armitage arrived for the third round of talks on the future of six U.S. 
military facilities here, came as a surprise to the Philippine government. 
</P>
<P>
But Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus said he was pleased that the United States 
is removing its 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing in line with previous Philippine 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave us what we wanted," Manglapus said late Wednesday. "We're happy 
about that." 
</P>
<P>
Last September, the Philippines served notice that it wants "full sovereign 
control" of Clark and four smaller communications facilities by the time the 
present bases lease expires next September. Manila said it also wants joint 
military use of Clark by January. 
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon official here said the redeployment was "influenced" by the 
Philippine demands, but more important factors were Air Force budget 
constraints, worldwide force restructuring and changing security demands. 
</P>
<P>
A statement by the U.S. Embassy cited the high cost of new systems required by 
the F-15s, a "long-term investment . . . which the U.S. has concluded makes 
more sense in Alaska, all things considered." 
</P>
<P>
The statement said the United States is reassuring allies that removal of the 
two fighter squadrons "in no way diminishes our commitment or ability to meet 
our responsibilities in the Pacific." 
</P>
<P>
Clark, about 65 miles north of Manila in central Luzon, has about 8,500 U.S. 
military personnel. The sprawling base dates back to the U.S. colonial war here 
at the turn of the century. The first airfield was built in 1919. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Clark was the busiest single-runway base in the U.S. Air 
Force. It has served as a major operations and logistics hub for the western 
Pacific and Indian Ocean since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said they hope to continue using Clark for a Military Airlift 
Command operation and the 44,000-acre Crow Valley bombing and pilot-training 
range in nearby Capas, Tarlac. They want to leave up to 3,000 troops as well. 
</P>
<P>
Philippine officials have said they hope to transform Clark into a new 
international airport and cargo facility. Given the country's current economic 
crisis, those plans are unlikely to be realized any time soon, however. 
</P>
<P>
The current round of talks, expected to end Friday, will focus on the U.S. 
proposal for a 10- to 12-year cutback of operations at the other major base 
here, the Subic Bay Naval Base, a key repair and logistics center for the U.S. 
7th Fleet.

The last U.S. game of the world chess championship ended in a draw Wednesday, 
and organizers and observers declared the American segment of the tournament a 
success. 
</P>
<P>
Game 12 ended after defending champion Garry Kasparov's 37th move. The draw 
left Kasparov and challenger Anatoly Karpov tied at 6-6. Each won one game and 
there were 10 draws. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lowered expectation about turnout when we started, but we've been 
delighted at how many people showed up from all over the world," said Adam 
Black, a spokesman for the tournament organizers. "Interest has not waned. 
People have called and come from all over." 
</P>
<P>
The second half of the championship begins on Nov. 24 in Lyons, France. The 
first player to gain 12 1/2 points wins the championship and $1.7 million of a 
$3-million purse. Opening ceremonies in France are scheduled for Nov. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Serious chess players and casual observers, paying $25 to $100 for tickets, 
crowded the Hudson Theater and adjoining Hotel Macklowe in midtown Manhattan 
for the games. 
</P>
<P>
Grandmaster Patrick Wolff, who did commentary during the matches, said that the 
first four games could be considered the best first four games in world 
championship history. But games six through nine were "terrible," he said. The 
final games were a slight improvement, Wolff said. 
</P>
<P>
Here are the moves in Game 12 of the championship, with Kasparov playing white:

The sexual activity of teen-age girls increased sharply in the 1980s, despite 
the risk of sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDS and an onslaught of 
public-health messages urging them to abstain, according to an analysis of a 
federally funded national survey. The greatest increase was among girls who are 
white or from higher-income families. In 1988, the median age for first 
intercourse for black females was 16.6 years and for whites 17.8 years.

It was like father, like son, for a Udall, a Taft and a Mondale. But a Chafee, 
a Chiles and a Mosbacher found that a famous last name is no guarantee of 
election. 
</P>
<P>
A bumper crop of political offspring ran Tuesday. In Minnesota. Ted Mondale, 
son of Walter F. Mondale, ousted Republican state Sen. Phyllis McQuaid in his 
first bid for office. Hubert H. Humphrey III won a third term as that state's 
attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
Here are other younger-generation winners and losers: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Republican Robert Taft II was elected secretary of state in Ohio, ousting 
Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown. He is the great-grandson of President 
William Howard Taft and the son and grandson of U.S. senators. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Democrat Tom Udall won a race for attorney general in New Mexico. His 
father is former Arizona Rep. and Interior Secretary Stewart Udall. 
</P>
<P>
 -- While his father, Lawton Chiles, was winning the Florida governorship, Ed 
Chiles lost his race for a Florida Senate seat to Republican John McKay. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lincoln D. Chafee, son of Republican Sen. John H. Chafee, was defeated by 
Democrat Charles Donovan in his bid for mayor of Warwick, R.I.

VOTE AGAINST KING DAY MAY COST ARIZONA A SUPER BOWL; 
</P>

RACIAL ISSUE: THE NFL PRESIDENT SAYS HE'LL ASK LEAGUE OWNERS TO MOVE THE 1993 
GAME SITE. BACKERS OF THE HOLIDAY SAY NETWORK TV CAUSED A BACKLASH.

<P>
Arizona's on-again, off-again holiday honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was 
off again Wednesday, the victim of a narrow defeat at the polls that threatened 
to cost this city the 1993 Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the defeat Tuesday of two King Day propositions, National 
Football League Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said it was not "in the best 
interests of the NFL" to hold the football game in Phoenix and he will ask 
league owners to move it to another city. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers blamed the potential loss of the game, first mentioned during a 
televised NFL game Sunday, for setting off a voter backlash that defeated the 
King Day proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"Arizona has not seen the last of this (King Day holiday) issue," said Terry 
Hudgins, campaign president for the Martin Luther King Better America 
Committee, a group that fought for a paid holiday. "We'll be back." 
</P>
<P>
Voters on Tuesday defeated by a 3-1 margin a proposition that would have 
created a King Day at the expense of Columbus Day. And they rejected by a 
percentage point Proposition 302, which called for a paid King Day as well as a 
paid Columbus Day. 
</P>
<P>
With 99% of the precincts reporting, Proposition 302 was losing 522,840 to 
511,017, or 50 to 49%. 
</P>
<P>
Cloves Campbell, publisher of The Arizona Informant, a weekly newspaper serving 
the black community in Phoenix, said black leaders will meet today to determine 
what steps to take next. "They are not ready to throw up their hands" he said. 
"They are ready to talk it over and regroup." 
</P>
<P>
Hudgins and others blamed CBS Sports and the NFL for the defeat after a 
televised report Sunday said Arizona's Super Bowl would be moved if voters did 
not approve the holiday. The news, which aired during halftime of the Phoenix 
Cardinals-Miami Dolphins football game, was denied Monday by local Super Bowl 
organizers. 
</P>
<P>
But Hudgins said voters who perceived the announcement as "economic blackmail" 
may have cast ballots opposing the holiday in protest of the threat. 
</P>
<P>
However, other black leaders said the Super Bowl news could not have made that 
big a difference. State Sen. Carolyn Walker, a Phoenix Democrat who is one of 
three black legislators, said she knew the vote would be within a point or two. 
</P>
<P>
"It simply proves what everyone outside the state has been saying about us. I 
keep saying we are not racist and not bigoted. But the numbers show we are," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The King Day controversy was first thrust into the national spotlight by 
then-Gov. Evan Mecham shortly after he took office in 1987 when he canceled a 
paid King holiday established by his predecessor. Mecham, who was later 
impeached and removed from office, proclaimed the third Sunday in January to be 
King Day/Civil Rights Day. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1989, legislators approved a King holiday and eliminated the paid 
Columbus Day holiday, a move that outraged Italian-Americans. A few days later 
a petition drive was launched, which resulted in the soundly defeated 
proposition creating a King Day at the expense of Columbus Day. 
</P>
<P>
After Phoenix was awarded the 1993 Super Bowl in March, community leaders 
lobbied for further action on the holiday in hopes of avoiding any problems 
with the league. Legislators responded in May by passing another bill creating 
a paid King Day as well as a paid Columbus Day. 
</P>
<P>
But King Day foes, led by Mecham, launched another drive that placed that law 
on the ballot for voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
Walker said legislators could take up the issue again but they might be wise to 
let the matter rest awhile. Leadership from the executive office could be 
lacking, because although both gubernatorial candidates supported a paid King 
holiday, that race was still up in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard, a Democrat, and Phoenix developer Fife Symington, 
a Republican, each garnered 49% of the vote Tuesday in the race for governor, 
forcing an unprecedented runoff election which may not occur until spring. 
</P>
<P>
Retiring Gov. Rose Mofford, the secretary of state who took office when Mecham 
was impeached two years ago, was expected to stay on as a caretaker after her 
term expires in January.

INCUMBENTS' MONEY ADVANTAGE DECISIVE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: ELECTION RESULTS INDICATE THAT CHALLENGERS HAVE LITTLE CHANCE AGAINST 
WELL-FINANCED OFFICEHOLDERS.

<P>
Abortion. Taxes. The budget. All were important in determining the outcome of 
the 1990 elections but perhaps the single most decisive factor in many 
campaigns was something the candidates never mentioned: How much money they had 
to spend. 
</P>
<P>
With a few notable exceptions, the results of Tuesday's election reinforced the 
basic tenet of American politics that well-financed incumbents are almost 
impossible to beat. 
</P>
<P>
Not even the apparent wave of anti-incumbent sentiment that engulfed the nation 
during the recent battle over the budget was sufficient to overcome the 
financial advantage of most incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
"The big story of this election was that incumbents were insulated by money, in 
spite of the incredible frustration that many voters felt," said Ellen Miller, 
executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a think tank that 
specializes in studying campaign financing. 
</P>
<P>
The disparity in spending between incumbents and challengers was worse this 
year than in any recent election, said Fred Wertheimer, president of Common 
Cause, a group that advocates campaign finance reform. 
</P>
<P>
"You've clearly got a rigged political system," he added. 
</P>
<P>
According to Federal Election Commission records on campaign spending through 
Oct. 17, congressional incumbents spent $214.8 million in advance of the 1990 
elections -- nearly four times more than the $60 million available to 
challengers in those same races. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, about 96% of House incumbents were reelected. All but one 
incumbent senator won -- the highest return rate in the Senate since 1856. 
</P>
<P>
"When incumbents in the Senate are able to outspend their opponents by 
three-to-one and House incumbents enjoy a nine-to-one money advantage over 
challengers, there is little reason to expect much turnover in Congress," said 
Joan Claybrook, president of Ralph Nadar's Public Citizen, another advocate for 
campaign finance reform. 
</P>
<P>
"As has been the case in most recent elections, money talked and challengers 
walked." 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere was the advantage of money more apparent than in races where incumbents 
such as Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and Reps. Denny Smith (R-Ore.), Craig T. 
James (R-Fla.) and Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.) were targeted for defeat by the 
opposing party. A surprisingly large number of these targeted incumbents were 
able to withstand strong challenges with the help of a substantial cash 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
There were some exceptions to this rule of financial dominance, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Most notable was the victory of Democrat Paul Wellstone, who spent only 
$781,000 against one of the Senate's most skillful fund-raisers, Sen. Rudy 
Boschwitz (R-Minn.). Boschwitz spent almost $6.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Republican Christine Todd Whitman, with expenditures of $465,000, 
nearly defeated Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), who spent $10.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Political scientist Norman Ornstein said that the Boschwitz and Bradley races 
prove that reformers such as Miller, Wertheimer and Claybrook sometimes 
overstate the role that money plays in guaranteeing the reelection of 
incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a big thing, but it is not everything," he said. "It's not as if you've 
got an electorate that is a bunch of Stepford Wives who are willing to reelect 
every incumbent." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the reformers believe that Boschwitz and Bradley encountered 
trouble at the polls in part because their opponents made an issue of their 
enormous campaign war chests. Wellstone gained attention by joking about his 
lack of funds; Whitman publicly challenged Bradley to adhere to a $3-million 
spending limit, but the incumbent refused. 
</P>
<P>
"Wellstone was able to hang the money issue around Boschwitz's neck like a 
millstone," Miller said. "In Boschwitz's case it became an embarrassment of 
riches." 
</P>
<P>
In Florida, likewise, Gov.-elect Lawton Chiles, who defeated incumbent Bob 
Martinez, capitalized upon voter frustration with big-money candidates by 
refusing to accept contributions in excess of $100. 
</P>
<P>
Challengers in the most hotly contested Senate races were woefully underfunded, 
according to FEC records of expenditures prior to Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Paul Simon spent about $8 million, or twice as much as his opponent, Rep. 
Lynn Martin (R-Ill.); Sen.-elect Hank Brown (R-Colo.) spent $3.1 million, or 
almost three times as much as his opponent, Josie Heath; Helms' $15-million 
expenditure was more than three times the money spent by his opponent, Harvey 
Gantt. 
</P>
<P>
In House races where targeted incumbents won despite expectations that they 
would lose, the incumbent consistently had a spending advantage. Annunzio spent 
$686,670 through Oct. 17, compared to $246,600 spent by his opponent, Walter W. 
Dudycz. 
</P>
<P>
James spent $787,650, compared to $519,000 spent by his opponent, Reid Hughes. 
And Smith spent $696,638, compared to $560,600 by his opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Money appears to have been what saved Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) against a 
tough challenge by Democrat David Worley. Gingrich spent $1 million; Worley 
spent $267,000, and some experts suggested that the challenger could have won 
with more money. 
</P>
<P>
Even incumbents themselves acknowledge that their biggest advantage is often 
money. 
</P>
<P>
"If a guy has a $300,000 cannon to aim at his district, that helps a lot," said 
Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Highland). "It's a horrid difficulty for non-incumbents 
trying to make a crack in this system." 
</P>
<P>
In some rare cases, a challenger actually spent more money than the incumbent. 
In Rhode Island, for example, Republican Gov. Edward DiPrete was defeated by 
Democrat Bruce Sundlun, who outspent him, two to one. 
</P>
<P>
But just as money does not necessarily guarantee victory for an incumbent, it 
cannot save an otherwise weak challenger. Case in point: Jim Salomon spent 
$297,100 to challenge Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles). Beilenson

VOTER TURNOUT NATIONWIDE IS EQUAL TO '86 LOW 
</P>

Experts estimated that only about 36% of eligible Americans turned out to vote 
Tuesday, matching the lowest total of the past 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis B. Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American 
Electorate, a Washington-based group that studies voting trends, said that 
preliminary calculations showed turnout almost exactly equal to the 36.4% in 
1986, a post-World War II low. 
</P>
<P>
But that figure masked wide variations across the country. Relative to 1986, 
the last midterm election, turnout was up substantially in Massachusetts, the 
site of a closely contested gubernatorial race; North Carolina, where 
conservative Republican Sen. Jesse Helms turned back a black Democratic 
challenger, Harvey Gantt; and Minnesota, which saw tight struggles for both 
governor and senator. A higher percentage of eligible voters also came to the 
polls in Kentucky, the District of Columbia, Maine, Connecticut, Ohio and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, California, New York and Florida all saw substantial 
declines. Preliminary figures assembled by Gans indicate that only 32.7% of 
eligible voters came out in California (though he cautions that final 
calculations may slightly raise the total), just 29.1% in New York, and 34.6% 
in Florida. The raucous governor's race in Texas won by Democrat Ann Richards 
produced a slight increase in turnout, but only to 30.7%. 
</P>
<P>
Several other states with close races also fell off. "Oregon, Kansas, Alabama, 
Hawaii, Oklahoma, Illinois -- all had highly competitive races and all of them 
had lower turnouts," said Gans. 
</P>
<P>
In some states, the turnout pattern appeared to be a key -- if not decisive -- 
factor in the results. In Florida, Gov. Bob Martinez suffered from low turnout 
in heavily Republican areas in his ringing defeat by Democrat Lawton Chiles. In 
Michigan, Democratic Gov. James J. Blanchard was undercut by low turnout in 
heavily Democratic Detroit and lost a narrow decision to Republican John 
Engler. 
</P>
<P>
The repeat of 1986's meager showing deepened concerns among experts about the 
apparently inexorable downward trend in electoral participation. "There is no 
reason to believe the bottom has been reached," said Sanford Horwitt, director 
of the Citizen Participation Project at People for the American Way, a liberal 
Washington group. "This is a continuing, ongoing, decline."

TRAGEDY TURNS FUNNY IN 'BROADWAY BOUND' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Out of domestic tragedy, comedy sketches are born. 
</P>
<P>
That's "Broadway Bound" in a nutshell, the bittersweet Neil Simon comedy 
currently enjoying a winning production by the Laguna Playhouse. The trick of 
the play is in orchestrating the tragic and comic strains to create a single 
melody in counterpoint. And director Jerry Evans pulls it off most of the time. 
Though the initial scenes feel forced for humor or mired in pathos, the second 
act is as smooth and sweet and bracing as the cup of honeyed tea Mama Kate 
concocts for her flu-sick boy, Eugene. And when mother and son dance together 
to the strains of Kate's girlhood glory, director Evans' sure hand guides them 
gracefully around the sentimental pitfalls of Simon's confessional portrait of 
the Jerome family. The performances throughout are solid and at times inspired. 
The gem of the evening is Harper Roisman as Grandpa Ben. His face is so 
expressive, his delivery so dry and consummately timed, his character seems to 
have grown organically from the soil of Simon's script. Stubborn, opinionated, 
funny and honest, Roisman's Ben is rather like New York itself: He's a delight 
to visit, but you wouldn't want to live with him. 
</P>
<P>
As Eugene, David Kaufman is bright-eyed and knowing, with a pointed wit born of 
love and a determination to survive laughing. He handles the asides to the 
audience adroitly, and though commenting on events from a future perspective, 
his wisdom never deflates his boyishness. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Collins' Kate has such grace and strength, one can well believe she 
was the finest dancer at the Primrose Ballroom. Collins comes so close to 
realizing the full dimension of this beautiful role, one wishes she would 
reveal a little more of the pain and hope her powerful presence suggests she is 
holding in reserve. 
</P>
<P>
The handsome two-level set by Steven Maddy is impressive, though the 
furnishings, especially in the boys' bedrooms, are far more generic than the 
characters who inhabit the house. The occasionally sourceless lighting is 
disturbing in so naturalistic a setting, but the production is of very high 
quality overall.

"Smile" (1975), directed by Michael Ritchie. 113 minutes. Rated PG. One of a 
series of Michael Ritchie films about America's unbending faith in traditions 
and pageantry, no matter how tarnished. 
</P>
<P>
In this one, it's a beauty pageant that takes it on the chin. Look for an 
18-year-old Melanie Griffith as one of the contestants. D.L.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: ONCE A STRANGER, TWICE FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM COLONNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We're talking pasta. And veal. And steaks and seafood. Oh, yes, and atmosphere. 
Intimate, yet casual. Classy, yet reasonable. And yes, we are talking sauce -- 
deep red, rich, garlic-laden sauce straight from the soul of Sicily. We're 
talking Ristorante Genovese, the oldest Italian restaurant in Orange, opened in 
1957 when Tustin Avenue was still a dirt road. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, it was called the Genovese Steak House. The Genovese family got out 
of the business in the mid-1970s and leased the building to several different 
operators, but five years ago, Al, the youngest of the three Genovese brothers, 
reopened the place with his wife, Marge, and sister Mary. Al's son Chris is the 
bartender; Al's daughter Jill is the lunchtime waitress who also works Friday 
and Saturday dinners. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the crew doesn't carry the Genovese name but is family just the 
same. So, for that matter, are the customers, who never seem to come for a 
single visit. There's a sign over the parking lot entrance: "You are only a 
stranger here once." It's true. Al and Marge seem to make friends with 
everybody. Then there are the waiters and waitresses -- attentive, caring and 
efficient. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, chef Michael Storrer, whose credentials include the Villa Nova 
in Newport Beach, came to Genovese and brought another dimension to the cooking 
-- a variety of lighter fare such as frittata. The man also has a special flair 
with a fish. 
</P>
<P>
Marge herself prepares the sauces daily, makes an incredible minestrone that 
can be a meal in itself, and makes (also daily) mouth-watering cannoli that are 
out of this world. It is difficult to recommend any single dish because it is 
impossible to find one that isn't excellent. But the pasta dishes -- from 
spaghetti and lasagna to linguine and clams and fettuccine Alfredo -- are the 
most popular. And the steak alla Sicilian, made with either T-bone or 
Porterhouse cuts, is extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the pizza, served only at lunchtime. It, too, is made fresh 
daily, and you won't find yourself complaining that there's not enough cheese, 
or anything else, on it. The wine list is limited, but excellent and 
reasonable. A favorite is the Frescobaldi Chianti, as fine as you can find (and 
you can't find it at many restaurants). 
</P>
<P>
Although the servings can be hefty, the prices will be anything but, ranging 
from $8.50 for cheese ravioli to $16.95 for steak and shrimp scampi. A couple 
can enjoy a meal with a good bottle of wine for less than $50. All dinners 
include a choice of salad or soup (do not pass up that minestrone) and 
excellent garlic bread -- with the emphasis on garlic. The veal, chicken, beef 
and seafood dinners come with a vegetable and pasta. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the restaurant itself, a departure from the trendy bright 
strip-mall establishments that are overtaking Orange County. This one is a 
throwback. A whole building with a quaint exterior that looks more like a house 
than anything else, and a tasteful interior that you would expect from an 
Old-World Italian restaurant -- 18 tables and booths, soft romantic lighting, 
and comfortable seats as deep red as the sauce. 
</P>
<P>
But no place is perfect. Ristorante Genovese is closed Sundays and Mondays. 
</P>
<P>
 Ristorante Genovese, 625 N. Tustin Ave., Orange. Open Tuesday through Friday 
for lunch, 11 a.m.-2 p.m.; Tuesday through Saturday for dinner, 5-10 p.m. (714) 
633-5654.

"Hope and Glory" (1987), directed by John Boorman. 113 minutes. Rated PG-13. 
</P>
<P>
War from the perspective of an awe-struck youth, a 7-year-old London boy 
roaming like a terrier, sniffing out fresh shrapnel to add to his collection, 
escaping his basement shelter to see the bombs exploding -- the best fireworks 
ever. Yet Boorman never turns war into something flip or trivial. MARK CHALON

<P>
If you're looking for ferns and mineral water, don't come here. It's strictly 
beer, wine and pool at this, one of the few remaining country bars in Orange 
County, suitably rough around the edges but with an endearing simplicity. Just 
don't be frightened off by the swarm of Harley-Davidsons parked near the patio.

THE CORNER BAR: COLD BEER, CHEAP FOOD, LEVEL POOL TABLES -- AND NO PRETENSE

Sick of taking heat from East Coasters about how every saloon in Southern 
California is some effete nouveau fern bar tarted up to look like it might have 
a pedigree stretching back to ancient times but that still reeks of eau de yup? 
Take them to Joe Jost's and shut them up forever. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Jost's is the oldest saloon in Long Beach, and it is where hunger, thirst 
and pretense go to die. The beer comes in frosted 20-ounce schooners, the eggs 
are pickled on the premises, and the Joe's Special (polish sausage on rye) is a 
true classic. There is pool and snooker in the back room, and freshly roasted 
peanuts and cigars are sold behind the bar. 
</P>
<P>
The wooden rail under the aluminum bar has been worn smooth by men who took 
their sons in for their first public drinks and by the sons who in turn came 
with their own sons. The booths and tables are dark and wooden and bear carved 
initials that have been varnished over again and again. The ceiling fans are 
old and made for function, not show. The walls are cluttered with old photos, 
foreign bank notes and snapshots of patrons in Joe Jost's T-shirts standing 
before the Alamo, the Eiffel Tower and the Great Wall of China. 
</P>
<P>
The place started out as a barber shop in the early 1920s, and Joe, a Hungarian 
immigrant, served root beer and sandwiches to waiting customers during 
Prohibition. After Prohibition was repealed, the local health department told 
Joe that he could either serve food and beer or cut hair, but not both. Out 
went the barber chairs and up went a bar. 
</P>
<P>
Today the place is run by Ken Buck, Joe's grandson. It's not a historical 
landmark, but it ought to be. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Jost's is no longer male-dominated. In fact, it has become something 
patrons call a family bar. On weekends in particular, men and women arrive with 
their kids and share tables with regulars and victorious softball teams. 
</P>
<P>
Sports on TV, good talk, cheap food, cold beer, level pool tables and nearly 
seven decades of experience and unaltered tradition. Mention "urban renewal," 
and hundreds of loyal patrons would cheerfully throw themselves in front of the 
bulldozers. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Jost's, 2803 E. Anaheim St., Long Beach. Open 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. Monday 
through Saturday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday. (213) 439-5446. PATRICK MOTT

PEOPLE: FARMER DOESN'T PINE FOR MAINSTREAM LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Charles Peltzer was considering a career as an aeronautical engineer, a 
prospective employer showed him the workplace. It had 200 desks in a single 
room, each manned by an engineer. 
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked when I looked at the room. I could see myself locked into that 
kind of career jail with no freedom," said Peltzer, who was raised on his 
father's citrus tree farm in Anaheim, part of which is now Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
So Peltzer decided agriculture was his calling, although he was unsure of what 
type of farming he wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
In 1962, a chance drive past a Christmas tree farm near Yorba Linda settled 
that dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
"I drove past this farm where a crowd of 100 people were lined up to reserve 
Christmas trees being grown by that farmer," recollects Peltzer. "I was 
astounded." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take long to settle on his future. 
</P>
<P>
"I immediately recognized that Christmas trees were a strong tradition for the 
whole nation and they were the same as raising citrus trees, except they were 
seasonal," he said. That was in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Today Peltzer has eight leased Peltzer Pines land sites in Orange County where 
he grows thousands upon thousands of Monterey pine Christmas trees. 
</P>
<P>
"The big joy is still the same," said Peltzer, referring to the Saturday before 
Thanksgiving when he starts taking reservations for the Christmas trees that 
take four years to grow. 
</P>
<P>
This year might be an especially good year. 
</P>
<P>
"When you hear talk of recession you find people tend to stay home, and family 
and traditional values seem to come out," he said. "Those are the strongest 
years for the tree industry." 
</P>
<P>
He expects to sell 10,000 Christmas trees this year -- much of it return 
business -- that range in price from $30 to $50. 
</P>
<P>
While this might be a good year, Peltzer's other years were just as fulfilling, 
regardless of sales. 
</P>
<P>
"The actual working of the tree farm is a no-stress, no-deadline business," he 
said, "There's nothing that can't wait until tomorrow, other than the sales 
season." 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact "if I want to go fishing, I go and if I want to stay an 
extra day, I stay," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And that goes for his six full-time employees who care for and trim the trees 
that grow from seedlings imported from New Zealand. "There is no supervisor, 
and they create their own hours and work schedule," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Peltzer said close friends comment that "I don't know if you make any money or 
not but you have a great business lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
There is an added benefit working with trees. 
</P>
<P>
"We are really in a rural environment completely disconnected from traffic. And 
some of the tree sites have a lot of wildlife," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It took a hefty amount of self-sacrifice during the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"We barely survived in the beginning," said Peltzer, who is the father of four 
sons. "We had no luxuries. It was very scary." 
</P>
<P>
It was what farming was all about, he told his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"We're farmers. Maybe in four years we'll be able to do some of the things our 
friends are doing," he said. "You have to sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
But in three years they cut 100 trees out of the crop of 2,000 and set up a 
card table with handmade signs. 
</P>
<P>
"Within a short time every one was sold. I knew it would work well," he said.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
NOW, HERE'S THE GOOD ELECTION NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All in all, it was quite an Election Day for Orange County. The best news: On 
the third try, voters finally approved Measure M, the half-cent sales tax for 
transportation. That means Orange County can move forward on vitally important 
freeway, street and transit projects. 
</P>
<P>
Also very good news: Laguna Beach voters approved a $20-million bond issue, its 
first step in raising $78 million toward purchasing Laguna Canyon from the 
Irvine Co. A year ago, few would have predicted that the city would be within 
striking distance of saving the precious canyon from development. 
</P>
<P>
Passage of these two spending measures, especially given world unrest and the 
threat of national economic recession, was a pleasant surprise, to say the 
least. Orange County, after all, is just about as strongly anti-tax a county as 
one can get. 
</P>
<P>
In other election results, for example, county voters overwhelmingly said no to 
bonds for prisons, schools, housing, water projects, parks and recreation and 
county courthouse construction -- not to mention turning down the "Big Green" 
environmental initiative. 
</P>
<P>
That made the victories of Measure M and the Laguna Canyon bond measure all the 
sweeter. The message: If a strong case is made that a tax will improve people's 
lives in a very specific and visible way, they'll vote for it. 
</P>
<P>
There's other good news, as well. In Huntington Beach, voters made a wise 
choice between two confusing measures. By approving Measure C, they have taken 
a step toward preserving precious oceanfront and park lands. Elsewhere, three 
more cities -- Orange, Costa Mesa and Fullerton -- voted to oppose fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
Voters also were discerning in their choice of candidates. Offered a worthy 
opponent to longtime county Schools Supt. Robert Peterson, they voted for 
educator John F. Dean. 
</P>
<P>
In Costa Mesa, City Councilman Orville Amburgey, who divided the community on 
immigrant and arts issues and who was accused of conflicts of interest, was 
voted out. And Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), whose first term was 
marred by the poll-guard controversy, was defeated by Democrat Tom Umberg of 
Garden Grove. Irvine wisely kept direct election of mayors. 
</P>
<P>
But the vote for Measure M showed the urgency with which Orange County voters 
regard quality of life issues in the 1990s. The money will go for many projects 
aimed at easing traffic miseries that threaten to erode what's best about 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Passage was banner news, indeed.

MAINSTREAMING HANDICAPPED SCHOOLCHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with interest your column that dealt with the civil rights struggle of 
some parents to mainstream their severely handicapped children into regular 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The general assumption here is that the regular teacher has the expertise and 
training to handle all educational needs. 
</P>
<P>
If this is so, why did I spend a lot of time, energy and money at the 
university level acquiring special education credentials? I'd like to think 
that my expertise is worth something. 
</P>
<P>
Regular teachers in my school in East Garden Grove are currently struggling 
with some of the highest caseloads in the nation (30 to 35 per class), not to 
mention the fact that many (of the students) don't speak any English. 
</P>
<P>
We now serve over 13 varying language groups and cultures! The teachers are 
fortunate to get an aide for one hour a day. Add to this the social ills of the 
neighborhood (gangs, drugs, and alcoholism). 
</P>
<P>
Yes, philosophically I agree that our handicapped children need good role 
models. Hopefully, their families contribute to this need. 
</P>
<P>
However, it is unrealistic and impractical to expect regular teachers to take 
on this additional responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Are we prepared to offer all these teachers the critical teaching skills 
needed, to reduce their class sizes drastically and provide well-trained aides? 
Perhaps then we can address these parents' civil right concerns.

ATHLETIC OFFICIAL SUES USC, ALLEGING RACIAL BIAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marvin Cobb, a USC assistant athletic director, claims he was not promoted by 
the university because of racial bias, a suit filed in Los Angeles Superior 
Court this week contends. 
</P>
<P>
The suit claims that USC Athletic Director Mike McGee passed over Cobb, who is 
black, for a promised promotion to associate athletic director because Cobb had 
complained about the treatment of black athletes at the university. 
</P>
<P>
McGee said Wednesday night the school has not received a copy of the complaint. 
He said he would not comment until he reads the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that when Cobb was hired in 1986 he was told by McGee that he 
would have flexible hours and a guaranteed promotion in two years. 
</P>
<P>
After accepting the job, Cobb "complained to USC concerning the treatment of 
African-American athletes," the suit said. After that, "McGee complained to 
(Cobb) that (he) was not keeping firm office hours." 
</P>
<P>
Cobb contends he worked 10 to 14 hours a day on a regular basis and "performed 
at all times his duties in a competent and professional manner." 
</P>
<P>
When two years passed and Cobb was not promoted, he was told it was because of 
his lax office hours, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb alleged that others in the department also did not keep regular office 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, which seeks unspecified damages, alleged violations of labor laws, 
race discrimination and breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
Cobb, a Trojan starter in football and baseball in the early 1970s, has played 
an instrumental role in developing USC's student-athlete academic programs. He 
also assists McGee with NCAA compliance, as well as heading the department's 
drug education program. 
</P>
<P>
He could not be reached for comment Wednesday night. His attorney, Stephanie 
Wells of San Francisco, also could not be reached.

NEWSWIRE: ILLINOIS BANNED FROM '91 NCAA TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Illinois basketball team was banned Wednesday from postseason play in 1991 
by the NCAA, placed on three years of probation and limited to two new 
scholarships in each of the next two years for violating NCAA regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The school, however, missed the "death penalty" when it was cleared of the most 
serious charges -- offering cash and cars to top recruits, including prep star 
Deon Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 1989 recruitment of Thomas that prompted the 16-month investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"If the most serious violations had been found, then . . . the so-called death 
penalty . . . would have been imposed," said David Berst, the NCAA's assistant 
executive director for enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
The death penalty, which bans a school from competition in a sport for a period 
up to two years, can be imposed after a school is sanctioned twice within a 
five-year period for major NCAA infractions. This is Illinois' third penalty 
since 1984 -- the other two involved football and basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois will be banned from off-campus basketball recruiting and from paying 
for visits by recruits to its campus in the first year. TV coverage will not be 
restricted.

<P>
With 46 receptions for 792 yards this season, senior flanker Gary Wellman is on 
pace to become USC's first 1,000-yard receiver. 
</P>
<P>
He needs 23 receptions to break Erik Affholter's school record of 68 in one 
season. 
</P>
<P>
That also would move him into third place on USC's all-time receiving list. And 
if he maintains his average of 88 yards a game, he will break Jeff Simmons' 
school record of 973 yards in one season. 
</P>
<P>
Wellman made 45 catches in his first three seasons at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Brian Tuliau tore ligaments in his left ankle in Saturday's 31-31 
tie with California and may be out for the season, Coach Larry Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Giles Pellerin, a retired phone company executive from Pasadena who has 
attended 699 consecutive USC football games, is expected to extend his streak 
to 700 when the Trojans play Oregon State Saturday at Corvallis, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
The streak started in 1926, when Pellerin was a sophomore at USC. Pellerin, 83, 
will be given a game ball if USC beats the Beavers, Smith said. JERRY CROWE

<P>
The Rams activated Marcus Dupree off the injured-reserve list Wednesday, but 
Dupree and Coach John Robinson cautioned against expecting the 26-year-old 
running back to see much action Sunday against the New York Giants at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to look at it in reality," said Dupree, who is bringing his two sons, 
his mother and his little brother from Mississippi to the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been out of this game for five years, so don't expect to see me go out 
there and bust an 80-yard touchdown. It would be great, but whatever happens, 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson emphasized that he is taking it slowly because Dupree has played fewer 
than 20 college and (United States Football League) games -- and that was more 
than five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like getting on an airplane and having them announce, 'We've got a really 
great pilot, he's got greatness in his future, but it's been five years since 
he's done it,' " Robinson said. "You'd get your . . . off the plane." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said recently waived running back Curt Warner got a fair chance with 
the team. "I thought when we started, he would be the veteran back and 
Cleveland (Gary) and Gaston (Green) would be the younger backs, and there would 
be a mix there. But we got off track somewhere. Whether his skills have 
deteriorated or not, that I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Jerry Gray, who did not play in last week's game because of a sore 
knee, practiced Thursday and said he expects to play Sunday. . . . The Rams 
waived center Rodney Lossow off injured reserve and re-signed running back Fred 
Whittingham Jr., who was assigned to the practice squad. TIM KAWAKAMI

So many bowls, so few great teams. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Not one undefeated and untied team will play in a bowl this season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only Brigham Young, among the bowl candidates, can win 11 regular-season 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only seven others have a legitimate chance at 10 victories, and one of 
those teams, Notre Dame, has to play Tennessee, Penn State and USC. Colorado 
can win 10, but it will have played 12 games and also benefited from the 
infamous fifth-down victory over Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only eight are likely to win nine games, and that might be a generous 
estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only seven will probably manage eight victories and only seven are likely 
to win seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If projections hold true, nine other bowl candidates will have only six 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
There are 19 bowls and, at the moment, about 40 teams available to fill those 
38 openings. Invitations are supposed to be presented on Nov. 24, but nobody 
has ever accused bowl officials of paying attention to their calendars. 
</P>
<P>
Presenting our best guesses . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Big Five: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Orange Bowl. Colorado vs. Notre Dame or Miami, but the Hurricanes will be 
invited only if Notre Dame loses to Tennessee Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sugar Bowl. Southeastern Conference champion (probably Tennessee) vs. 
Michigan, Notre Dame or Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cotton Bowl. Southwest Conference champion (probably Texas, since 
undefeated and untied Houston is ineligible) vs. Miami, Notre Dame or Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fiesta Bowl. Virginia vs. Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rose Bowl. Washington vs. Big Ten champion (probably Iowa). 
</P>
<P>
The Medium Six: Citrus -- Georgia Tech vs. Nebraska; Gator -- Auburn vs. Ohio 
State; Holiday -- Western Athletic Conference champion (probably Brigham Young) 
vs. Texas A&amp;M; Hall of Fame -- Clemson vs. Illinois; Liberty -- Army vs. 
Minnesota or Indiana; Blockbuster -- Florida State vs. Ohio State or 
Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
The Rest: Copper -- Wyoming vs. California; John Hancock -- Michigan State vs. 
USC; Freedom -- Colorado State vs. Oregon; Peach -- North Carolina State or 
Mississippi vs. Indiana or Minnesota; All-American -- Louisville vs. Alabama; 
Aloha -- Syracuse vs. Arizona; California -- San Jose State or Fresno State vs. 
Central Michigan; Independence -- Baylor vs. LSU or Southern Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
Teams on the bubble: Texas Christian and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Notre Dame is the center of attention. A victory over Tennessee will 
allow the Irish to delay a commitment and help the Sugar Bowl's chances of 
landing Notre Dame. An Auburn or Mississippi vs. Notre Dame game remains a 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
If Houston finishes the season undefeated and untied, Cougar fans are calling 
for Associated Press voters to crown the team as national champion. Four 
questions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Does a team on NCAA probation deserve to be eligible for a national title? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Should a team be voted No. 1 without playing a bowl game? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Should a team whose schedule includes Eastern Washington, Nevada Las Vegas, 
Southern Methodist, Rice, Texas Tech, Arizona State, Arkansas -- who have a 
combined record of 21-40 and only one of these seven, Eastern Washington (5-4), 
has a winning record -- be seriously considered as national championship 
material? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Would the best team in the country allow Texas Christian's second-string 
quarterback to throw for an NCAA-record 690 yards against it? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: A No. 1 vote for Houston, undefeated and untied or not, is a vote 
wasted. 
</P>
<P>
One more Houston item: We don't have a Heisman Trophy ballot, but if we did, we 
wouldn't penalize Houston quarterback David Klingler for directing a 
run-and-shoot offense that produces outrageous point and yardage totals. 
</P>
<P>
To do so would be the same as penalizing quarterback Ty Detmer for BYU's 
intricate passing attack, or Darian Hagan and Eric Bieniemy for Colorado's 
option offense, or Raghib Ismail for Notre Dame's plan to get him the ball -- 
by pass, handoff or special teams -- at least 20 times a game. Offensive 
systems and philosophies are nice, but without the right players, they flop. 
</P>
<P>
We also wouldn't dismiss Klingler as a leading candidate simply because former 
Cougar Andre Ware won the Heisman last year. One doesn't average more than four 
touchdown passes and 443 yards a game, as Klingler has this season, by 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
And for those critics who say the run-and-shoot is designed for short gains, 
think again. Of Klingler's seven touchdown pass plays last week against TCU, 
six of them traveled 35 yards or more -- 36, 42, 46, 59, 80 and 88. 
</P>
<P>
Klingler should consider himself lucky. Heisman candidate Shawn Moore, 
Virginia's multitalented quarterback, was scheduled to appear on NBC's "Today 
Show" last Monday. But after the Cavaliers were upset by Georgia Tech, the 
network called Sunday and canceled the request. Never mind that Moore accounted 
for four Virginia touchdowns in the loss. Instead, Ismail and Klingler were 
interviewed. All in all, a classless move by NBC to omit Moore. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing against the Virginia sports information department, but it pushed the 
wrong Moore for the Heisman. Herman, not Shawn, is the best Cavalier player 
and, according to Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Ross, the best wide receiver in the 
country. He caught nine passes for 234 yards and one touchdown Saturday. Moore 
has at least one touchdown reception in his last 10 games and 15 of his last 
16. 
</P>
<P>
And for what it's worth, Kentucky Coach Bill Curry, whose son plays for 
Virginia, said that Cavalier Coach George Welsh had no choice but to kick a 
tying field goal against Georgia Tech with 2:34 remaining. The alternative: a 
fourth-and-goal situation at the Yellow Jacket six-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have done the same thing," said Curry, who attended the game. Of 
course, Georgia Tech got the ball back, drove down the field and kicked a 
game-winning field goal. As for Curry, he couldn't have been too upset. After 
all, he's a Georgia Tech graduate and a former Georgia Tech head coach. 
</P>
<P>
How tough was it to get a ticket to last Saturday's game at Charlottesville, 
Va.? Well, as part of Virginia's annual basketball scrimmage, musician Bruce 
Hornsby and actor Woody Harrelson of "Cheers" fame agreed to serve as honorary 
coaches. Hornsby, who received no cash appearance fee, later said that one of 
the reasons he accepted the coaching invitation was the promise of a 
Virginia-Georgia Tech football ticket. He got one. . . . Alabama isn't going to 
win the SEC, but it might win six games, which is an accomplishment considering 
that the Crimson Tide lost their first three this season. The Tide hasn't 
allowed a touchdown in 12 quarters. . . . Louisville is ranked in the AP poll 
for the first time in 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
After 21 years as a college coach, Notre Dame's Lou Holtz will take his No. 
1-ranked team to Knoxville, Tenn., and 91,110-seat Neyland Stadium for the 
first time Saturday. Already, Holtz has called several colleagues, including 
former Alabama coach Ray Perkins, and asked how to deal with the deafening 
crowd noise. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure I'll call until I find someone who has something nice to say about 
it," Holtz said. "Everybody says don't go unless you absolutely have to." 
</P>
<P>
Holtz already has instructed team managers to play the song, "Rocky Top," a 
Tennessee band favorite, during each of the Notre Dame practices this week. For 
two hours, the song is played again and again. Notre Dame players leave the 
workouts humming the tune. "I went to sleep last night and I could hear it," 
cornerback Todd Lyght said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Holtz of Notre Dame's No. 1 ranking: "I have never worried about No. 1. We 
have a chance to be No. 1. But there are 10-15 teams who have a better chance 
to be No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
Grace Tower is the tallest dormitory on the campus at South Bend, Ind. Whenever 
the Irish are first in the polls, a No. 1 sign is placed atop the building. 
Holtz suggested that the person in charge of hanging the sign might want to 
keep his tools handy. 
</P>
<P>
"That guy's upset," Holtz said. "He knows he might have to go up there in bad 
weather and take it down." 
</P>
<P>
Our top 10: (1) Notre Dame, (2) Colorado, (3) Washington, (4) Houston, (5) BYU, 
(6) Miami, (7) Iowa, (8) Tennessee, (9) Texas, (10) Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
Our waiting list: Florida, Nebraska, Mississippi, Florida State and Virginia.

<P>
LA VERNE'S ORTMAYER, 73, GIVING UP HIS SPOT ON SIDELINE AFTER 45 SEASONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It will mark the end of an era when La Verne's football team plays host to 
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
After 45 years as a college coach, two at William Penn of Iowa and the past 43 
at La Verne, Roland Ortmayer is calling it a career. 
</P>
<P>
Only to Ortmayer, 73, it will simply be another in a series of steps in his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I look at it, this is just another part of my life that I'm going to 
go through," Ortmayer said. "I spent a big chunk of my life, 45 years, as a 
college coach, and I look at this as just another step." 
</P>
<P>
Before Saturday's game, Ortmayer will enter the field through a tunnel of fans, 
and he and his wife of 47 years, Cornelia, will be honored at halftime. 
Ortmayer will also be present after the game when ground is broken for La 
Verne's new football and track facility, to be called Ortmayer Sports Complex. 
</P>
<P>
But if it were up to Ortmayer, who will remain as athletic director, track 
coach and teacher at the university through next May, he would rather people 
didn't get too carried away with his impending departure. 
</P>
<P>
Said Ortmayer: "They ran an article (on me) in Sports Illustrated last year, 
and the last line says, 'Some day in May, I'll just walk away.' Well, that 
really was my plan. I wanted to just walk away and say that was my last year. 
But in order to provide a good transition for everyone, I decided this would be 
the way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer enters the game with a 184-191-6 record, but is three games above .500 
at La Verne. From his perspective, though, winning and losing are not all that 
important. 
</P>
<P>
"If you love sports, that's the way it should be," he said. "The winner can't 
win unless there is a loser to lose. A game in sport always ends at .500." 
</P>
<P>
As a coach, Ortmayer doesn't have a lot of requirements for his team. He 
doesn't use a playbook and doesn't punish players for missing practice. 
</P>
<P>
"On our team, you are not punished," he said. "You don't run laps and you don't 
do push-ups as punishment. You may run a lot or do exercises of resistance as a 
part of your normal work but not as punishment." 
</P>
<P>
He also frowns on players wearing their jerseys anywhere but on the football 
field. "I don't want to see any of my players wearing a jersey on campus or in 
their car or in the classroom," he said. "The only place I want to see a 
football jersey is on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer says that sports should only be one ingredient in the recipe for a 
well-rounded education. "I want sport to be a part of America's educational 
system," he said. "I want it to be just as important as the history we teach or 
the science we teach. But I don't want it to be any more important." 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer has left his mark on players he has coached over the years. 
</P>
<P>
One is Azusa Pacific Coach Jim Milhon, who played for Ortmayer from 1956 
through '58 and has coached against him 13 times. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't coach like him, but there are pieces of Ort that hang around inside of 
me," Milhon said. "There are other people who helped me grow as a coach, but 
he's the one who sparked me. 
</P>
<P>
"I think . . . that down through the years, people get the feeling that because 
he's so low-key, his teams are not prepared, and that's not true. They also 
think that he's not organized, and that's not true. And they think that he 
doesn't care about winning, and that's not true. He wants to win just as much 
as anyone else and maybe more." 
</P>
<P>
While eager to spend more time at his hobbies, such as rafting and fly-fishing, 
Ortmayer admitted that he will probably miss being close to the students. 
</P>
<P>
And the feeling will be mutual. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll be missed, but in the community of La Verne, the stories about him will 
go on forever," Milhon said. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge and Azusa Pacific entered last week's football games with 
hopes of reaching the divisional playoffs for the first time, but each was 
beaten. 
</P>
<P>
CS Northridge lost to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, 6-3, and Azusa Pacific was 
beaten, 27-23, by UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the setback, CS Northridge tied Cal Poly SLO for the Western Football 
Conference title at 4-1. But the Matadors (7-1) will probably need to upset Cal 
State Long Beach, an NCAA Division I team, this Saturday to reach the Division 
II playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
With its victory, Cal Poly SLO advanced to No. 8 in the Division II poll. CS 
Northridge dropped to No. 13 in the rankings. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa Pacific (6-2) may have seen its National Assn. of Intercollegiate 
Athletics Assn. playoff hopes disappear in its loss to UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Redlands wrapped up its first Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic 
Conference football championship since 1980 with a 52-14 victory over defending 
champion Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs (7-1), who play host to winless Whittier Saturday night, are 
ranked No. 5 in the Division III West Region, but must finish among the top 
four to make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
Pomona-Pitzer will play host to the NCAA Division III West Regional in women's 
volleyball today through Saturday. The SCIAC champion Sagehens (23-3, 10-0) are 
seeded No. 2 in the tournament behind UC San Diego. Other teams in the regional 
are La Verne, North Carolina Greensboro, Colorado College and Cal State San 
Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
Junior midfielder Justin Wall, who helped lead Westmont College to the Golden 
State Athletic Conference title in men's soccer, was named the conference 
player of the year. Westmont also placed forward Rob Ring, midfielder Aerick 
Brown and defender Cees Molenaar on the all-conference first team. . . . The CS 
San Bernardino men's soccer team saw its season end with a 1-0 overtime loss to 
UC San Diego in the first round of the Division III playoffs. CS San 
Bernardino, playing in its final season in Division III before moving up to 
Division II in 1991, will have 20 of 23 players back next season. 
</P>
<P>
Behind strong performances by Stephane Franke and Jaime Ortega, sixth-ranked 
Cal Poly Pomona surprised No. 3 Cal Poly SLO and No. 4 Humboldt State to win 
the men's cross-country title in the NCAA Division II West Regional Saturday at 
UC Riverside. Franke finished in first place, Ortega in third to carry the 
Broncos to a 13-point advantage over runner-up Humboldt, with Cal Poly SLO a 
distant third. . . . Cal Poly SLO, eight-time defending national champion, 
placed three runners in the top 10 of the women's cross-country division of the 
NCAA Division II Regional Saturday at Riverside and won the meet by 16 points 
over UC Davis.

EFFECT OF NO-FAIL RULE LINGERS; 
</P>
<P>
PREPS: WITH FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS COMING UP, COACHES AND ATHLETES RECALL THE LOST 
OPPORTUNITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two days before Fairfax High's scheduled first-round game in the Los Angeles 
City high school football playoffs last season, Coach Ron Price told the 
district athletic office that his team would have to forfeit. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions simply didn't have enough players to take the field. 
</P>
<P>
His team clinched the playoff berth Nov. 17, 1989, with a 4-5 record, but Price 
learned three days later that nine of his players had lost their eligibility 
for failing to meet the district's academic requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been coaching on and off in the district since 1969, and I've never had 
to forfeit a game before," said Price, 53. "It was a very tough thing to do. 
Some people were angry with my decision. But I didn't have enough starters left 
to field a competitive team. We basically would have used a junior varsity 
lineup. It wouldn't have been pretty." 
</P>
<P>
Losing players before the playoffs is nothing new to most City coaches, who 
became accustomed to such misfortune when the Board of Education of the Los 
Angeles Unified School District adopted the "No pass, no play" rule in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Under the rule, any student in grades four through 12 who failed a class or 
fell below a "C" average was prohibited from participating in any 
extracurricular activity. Grading periods covered 10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
That changed last January when mounting pressure from coaches and parents 
forced the school board to overturn the rule. Students now can keep their 
eligibility if they maintain a 2.0 grade-point average, even if they fail one 
or more classes. 
</P>
<P>
"The feeling is that we wanted to keep more kids in school, and extracurricular 
activities help kids stay in school," said Julie Korenstein, the board member 
who proposed the change. "They need to do well in academic subjects, but 
activities are important. I think we should help kids if they fail and not give 
them double punishment." 
</P>
<P>
Said Rita Walters, who authored the no-fail rule: "Of course, I'm upset about 
the change. The idea was to put emphasis on academics, and coaches didn't like 
that. But school is about education and not about sports and drama club and 
band. We seem to lose sight of that." 
</P>
<P>
Grades are checked every 10 weeks, and if a student loses eligibility, he or 
she has 10 weeks to improve. The first grading period of the fall semester 
occurs during the opening week of the football playoffs, which begin in two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The effect of the rule change is not yet clear because the district has not 
provided any new statistics on ineligibility rates. There is plenty of emotion 
on the subject, however. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the no-fail rule said it would not motivate students. They said 
the punishment was too severe for a single failing grade, and that it 
discouraged students from taking tougher courses. 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of examples: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fairfax quarterback Rahim Muhammad is enrolled in the school's AE 
(academically enriched) program and has a 2.5 grade-point average. He received 
an "F" in honors' English last fall that cost him an opportunity to finish the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes there's a class you just can't get by," Muhammad said. "I think if 
you can make up for one bad class with other classes, you still should be able 
to play. I hated missing the playoffs. It really hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Darryl Stroh, Granada Hills football coach, tells of a player several years 
ago who got all A's but was struggling in trigonometry. 
</P>
<P>
"He sweated it out the whole semester and ended up getting a 'D.' He shouldn't 
have had to be in such a predicament." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Then there is Roger Cortez, a senior at Belmont High, who hasn't played 
organized football for two years because he failed a biology class his 
sophomore year and a typing class his junior year. His grade-point average is 
slightly above 2.0. 
</P>
<P>
"I would go to games and watch and wish I could be playing. Football is very 
important to me, and I like playing sports. Being out really hurt," said 
Cortez, a starting tight end for the Eagles this season. "But I kept in shape 
and tried to do better in the classroom. Right now, I'm not failing any 
classes. I didn't like being punished that way, though." 
</P>
<P>
But the opponents have also unintentionally fueled some supporters' claims. 
</P>
<P>
Muhammad, for instance, sounds as if the no-fail rule did provide some 
motivation when he says: "The no-fail rule was really bad for me . . . but I 
vowed never to let the same thing happen to me again. I'm not failing any of my 
classes this year." 
</P>
<P>
Price said that the rule put too much pressure on coaches to consider 
academics, but some supporters of no-fail would probably be glad to hear that. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you wonder if you're a coach or a parent," Price said. "It isn't 
easy keeping students eligible. It takes a lot of patience and time. The role 
of the coach certainly has changed a lot over the last few years." 
</P>
<P>
The no-fail rule has received little support from Hal Harkness, district 
athletic commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
"The only justification of that rule is that it was there for punishment to 
those youngsters who failed," Harkness said. "If the rule was made to motivate 
youngsters, then it should have been changed a long time ago because it never 
did that. This rule did not motivate." 
</P>
<P>
Not all coaches agree that the change is a good one. Randolph Simpson, Manual 
Arts basketball coach, was one of the no-fail rule's strongest proponents. 
</P>
<P>
Manual Arts, located across the street from the Coliseum, traditionally fields 
some of the City's top basketball teams. The school has special study halls and 
tutoring programs for athletes. It also has its own grade checks every two 
weeks. The basketball team has not lost a player to academic ineligibility in 
the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
"What this decision does is say to the kids that it is OK for them to fail a 
class and to slack off," Simpson told The Times last January. "Everyone should 
be pushing harder with an attitude that they have to get it done, because it is 
not going to be that way for them when they move into the real world." 
</P>
<P>
The no-fail rule was overturned in a 5-2 vote of the school board last January. 
Walters and Leticia Quezada dissented. 
</P>
<P>
When the no-fail rule was in effect, eligibility losses from the district's 49 
high schools ranged from a low of 16.2% in the spring of 1984 to a high of 
21.8% in the fall of '87. Those who lost eligibility because of the no-fail 
rule fluctuated between 5% and 6%. Statistics weren't compiled for the 1988-89 
school year because of the teacher's strike. 
</P>
<P>
Walters said she would like to get the no-fail rule back on the district 
agenda, but acknowledges it might have to wait for a different board makeup. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a future for this rule here in Los Angeles," said Walters, who 
represents South Central Los Angeles. "People said this rule hurt students. 
That could only be true if they believe that students are incapable of 
learning."

eight-under par 63 Wednesday to take the first-round lead in the Kapalua 
International golf tournament on Maui. 
</P>

barely missed a hole in one and an eagle, each by about one foot, while 
shooting 64. 
</P>
<P>
At 65 are Bob Gilder and Jim Gallagher, with Billy Andrade, Bill Glasson and 
Ted Schulz at 66.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; 
</P>
<P>
ANNUAL REUNION ROMPS IN OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Reversing a trend, on-track attendance was up when Hollywood Park began its 
37-day fall meeting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The count, which wasn't released until 35 minutes after the ninth race, was 
declared official at 13,931, compared to 11,729 on opening day in 1989. This 
was the first time since 1985 that the opening-day crowd wasn't smaller than in 
the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh from their easy victory with Quiet American in Saturday's $638,000 NYRA 
Mile at Aqueduct in New York, trainer Gary Jones and jockey Chris McCarron had 
another laugher with Annual Reunion in the $65,000 Allez France Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Annual Reunion made 4-5 look like an overlay with a five-length victory in the 
1 1/16-mile turf race, easily dispatching Mahaska and six other 3-year-old 
fillies. 
</P>
<P>
The Cresta Rider filly was confidently ridden by McCarron, and the only 
question remaining to be answered at the top of the stretch was by how many 
lengths she was going to win. 
</P>
<P>
This was the first victory on turf for Annual Reunion, but she had run very 
well over this course last summer. In her first start on the grass, she was 
beaten by a head by Materco in the Honeymoon Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
"She's kind of a frail little thing, and she came up to today's race real 
fresh. And she's always run well fresh," Jones said. "She loves this course, 
and we'll probably run her back in the Dahlia (on Nov. 17). We'll take a look 
at it and see." 
</P>
<P>
Riding Annual Reunion for the first time since early in her 16-race career, 
McCarron noticed a big difference. 
</P>
<P>
"She's matured a lot," he said. "She was green back when I rode her. I've never 
ridden her on the turf before, and she used to climb when the dirt hit her in 
the face. 
</P>
<P>
"This grass course is in great shape. It's nice and green for this time of 
year. It's got a lot of bounce, and I feel very comfortable on it. This filly 
obviously loves it. (Around the turn,) I was confident. I had one filly 
(Mahaska) in front of me, and I didn't know whether she'd be able to carry her 
speed or not. I had a lot of horse sitting behind her, and I was able to go 
ahead and get by her." 
</P>
<P>
Making her first start on turf, Mahaska finished three lengths ahead of 14-1 
shot Vaguely Charming. Then came Daughter of Wolf, She's a V.P., Classic Ice, 
Invitation Waltz (the 7-2 second choice who broke very slowly) and Ali's Song. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Santos didn't take long to make himself at home in California. 
</P>
<P>
On his first day after moving from New York, the Eclipse Award-winning jockey 
won with his first mount, riding Paula Revere to a $16.20 upset in Wednesday's 
fourth race. 
</P>
<P>
Julio Garcia was originally named on the 2-year-old Caveat filly, but he began 
a five-day suspension Wednesday for being disqualified aboard Stylish Stud in 
last Saturday's $300,000 California Cup Classic. So Santos was named by trainer 
John Sadler. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to start off on the right foot," Santos said. "I won with my first 
horse here and I won the last race I rode in New York -- Sports View in last 
Sunday's Discovery Handicap at Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
"People have been helping me and everybody wants to give me business. Things 
have started out real good, and it seems like people really respect me here." 
</P>
<P>
A fourth place aboard Daughter of Wolf in the Allez France Handicap was the 
best Santos could manage with his other three mounts. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The stewards still haven't heard from jockey Pat Valenzuela, who called in sick 
Saturday at Santa Anita's Oak Tree meeting and later refused to take a drug 
test. If Valenzuela doesn't meet with stewards Pete Pedersen, Tom Ward and 
David Samuel before Monday, he will be suspended. . . . Annual Reunion's final 
time was 1:41 1/5 and her fourth victory was worth $38,000 to owner John Mabee. 
. . . There's a Pick Six carryover of $48,481.47 for today. 
</P>
<P>
Itsallgreektome, Septieme Ciel and Silver Ending are among the probable 
starters in Sunday's $200,000 Hollywood Derby at 1 1/8 miles on the turf. 
Itsallgreektome was second in the Breeders' Cup Mile; Septieme Ciel is a 
multiple-stakes winner from France, who was a Breeders' Cup Mile also-eligible; 
and Silver Ending won the Pegasus on Sept. 21 at the Meadowlands. Belmont 
winner Go and Go is a possible entrant. 
</P>
<P>
High Hook continued his love affair with Hollywood Park when he won the seventh 
race. The 8-year-old gelding, who had three victories at Hollywood during the 
summer meeting, has won nine of his 19 starts at the track. He completed a 
double for the jockey-trainer combination of Alex Solis and Bill Spawr. Their 
other victory was with Truly Naughty in the third race. Solis, who also won the 
sixth on Van Beethovan, was celebrating the ninth anniversary of his first 
victory as a jockey.

Lauding the Johnsons: Performing arts supporters Roger and Janice Johnson were 
honored by the Volunteer Center of Orange County last week when they received 
its coveted Giving is Living Award. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of guests squeezed into the Hyatt Regency Irvine to honor the couple. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Johnson is on the Orange County Performing Arts Center's board of 
directors. His wife is chairwoman of the Guilds of the Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Kathryn Thompson, attending with husband Gus Owen, presented the 
award to the couple whose names have become synonymous with the local 
performing arts scene. 
</P>
<P>
Janice Johnson thanked the crowd for their gift of friendship. "Many of the 
people in this room have done as much, perhaps even more," she said. "Most of 
the friendships I have were made doing volunteer work. Those people are as much 
a part of my life as volunteering is." 
</P>
<P>
Roger Johnson told guests that the arts were headed for challenging times. He 
said he hoped people would continue to give. When giving is difficult, "that's 
when it's needed most." 
</P>
<P>
On the scene: Center chairman William Lyon with his wife, Willa Dean; Janice's 
mother, Barbara Rowlands; her brother, Rick Rowlands; and the Johnsons' 
children -- Mary Cantor with her husband, Michael, and Eric Johnson with his 
wife, Gloria.

HOW TO: DONATE NON-CASH RESOURCES TO NONPROFIT AGENCIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By APRIL JACKSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In recent years corporations have come under public pressure to become more 
socially responsible. Voluntarism gives corporations the opportunity to 
actively reach out into the community by donating resources beyond the 
traditional cash and grants. Two options are to donate volunteers or non-cash 
resources to one of the 1,200 nonprofit organizations in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"Local businesses give valuables that nonprofits simply can't afford. Wells 
Fargo donates desks, chairs and couches, acquired from redecorating," said 
Vicky Woods, director of the Volunteer Center of Greater Orange County. "Ours 
is the only ongoing program in the country that provides quality office 
furniture to nonprofits." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most successful mergers of workers and companies to aid nonprofits 
is the Corporate Combined Volunteer Project. Last May, nearly 700 volunteers 
representing 30 local businesses pitched in for a day of repainting the 
Discovery Museum and renovating the 90-year-old water tower that was moved to 
the site in 1982. For Mary Ann Barngrover, public affairs manager at Chevron 
Corp.'s La Habra office, the Corporate Combined Project met her company's 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone had their company T-shirt on and worked together. The teams feel 
pride in themselves and in their company's presence in the project," Barngrover 
said. "This project envelops the major positive aspect of corporate 
volunteerism . . . corporations and individuals working together to help others 
in the community." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How Corporations Can Put Voluntarism Into Practice: 
</P>
<P>
* In-Kind Services. Companies or small businesses print flyers and brochures, 
donate lumber and renovation materials, or offer their own services to 
nonprofit agencies. 
</P>
<P>
* Loaned Executives. Corporate staff members are loaned to nonprofits during 
company time, bringing accounting, managerial and other skills to the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
* Non-cash Donations. Businesses donate office furniture, office supplies and 
similar business-related items that can be used at nonprofit offices and homes. 
</P>
<P>
* Workplace Volunteers: Employees are recruited to work in volunteer programs. 
They work within all facets of the nonprofit organizations, from designing 
brochures to heading up major fund drives. 
</P>
<P>
* Corporate Combined Volunteer Project. Corporate volunteers form teams that 
spend a day renovating a nonprofit building. 
</P>
<P>
The Volunteer Center helps corporations set up in-house volunteer programs. "We 
expose them to what everyone else is doing in corporate volunteering and help 
the company choose the right program for their size and needs," Woods said. 
"Last year, we recruited and placed 16,000 volunteers, and recycled hundreds of 
thousands of dollars worth of office furniture." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How Individuals Can Become Volunteers: 
</P>
<P>
* Contact the community services department within your company. Some companies 
(Irvine's Fluor Corp., for example) have set up corporate community involvement 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
* Contact the Volunteer Center of Greater Orange County. There are three 
offices, each serving a portion of the county.

Interviews may be held in person or over the telephone. Be ready to identify 
your interests, skills, hours available for volunteering and causes (elderly,

responses, the Volunteer Center will recommend two or three organizations for 
you to contact.

How To Donate Office Goods To Nonprofit Agencies: 
</P>
<P>
* Contact the Volunteer Center Warehouse at (714) 836-6534. Donations are 
screened before they are picked up. They do not accept any type of office 
machine. To save expenses, the Volunteer Center prefers that companies deliver 
goods to the warehouse, 515 N. Fairview St., Santa Ana.

PRESS CLUB, BOY SCOUTS IN MEDIA VENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Press Club is undertaking a venture with the Boy Scouts of 
America to sponsor a group for teen-agers interested in journalism and related 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Press Club members would serve as advisers for the Explorer 
Post, which would meet two or three times a month. 
</P>
<P>
Activities would include tours of local newspapers, cable television stations 
and radio stations, and probably a production of a newsletter, according to 
Robin Kruger, exploring executive. 
</P>
<P>
Potential members -- girls and boys between 14 and 20 -- are welcome to attend 
the post's first meeting tonight at the Days Inn Santa Ana, 1600 E. 1st Street, 
Santa Ana. The post has an annual fee of $12, payable to the Boy Scouts of 
America for insurance and administrative costs. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Press Club is a nonprofit organization with more than 500 
members. 
</P>
<P>
For more information, contact press club president Jonathan Volzke at (714) 
454-7338.

REUNION REINFORCES REALITY OF VIETNAM FOR A WAR-SCARRED NURSE AND VETERAN

<P>
For 20 years, no one seemed to care that Sharon Deehan had been a nurse in 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Then Deehan, a Kaiser Permanente Woodland Hills assistant administrator, 
attended a company retreat in May, 1988. When someone asked about her stint in 
Vietnam, she felt she "had finally been given permission to open up." 
</P>
<P>
"TV was my only catharsis for a while. There was at least one episode of 
'M*A*S*H' for each of my hospital experiences," Deehan said. 
</P>
<P>
Television also brought back one specific memory. While switching channels one 
day in 1985, Deehan saw a segment on the U.S. Olympic Ski Team. A name from her 
past -- Jack Benedict -- and his picture flashed on the screen. But Deehan 
suppressed thoughts of Benedict until after the Kaiser retreat. 
</P>
<P>
Benedict, an Army captain at the time, lost his legs in 1969 when he stepped on 
a mine in Vietnam. After that, his kidneys shut down and he became Deehan's 
patient for about two months in the renal intensive care unit of the 3rd Field 
Hospital in Saigon. Deehan remembered that Benedict was an officer -- there 
were only a few in her ward -- and he talked about sports. 
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, Deehan contacted Ellie Vargas, Southern California 
coordinator of the Vietnam Women's Memorial Project. Deehan became interested 
in the project as part of coming to terms with her Vietnam experience. (The 
project is raising money for a memorial to the role of women in Vietnam.) 
</P>
<P>
Vargas put Deehan in touch with Benedict, who thought he remembered Deehan. "He 
should," she said with a laugh. "There were only two nurses in the unit. Each 
one was on for a 12-hour shift." 
</P>
<P>
Now, 20 years later, Benedict was reunited Tuesday with his former Vietnam 
nurse in her Westlake Village house. 
</P>
<P>
"Being in each other's presence makes Vietnam a continued reality for me. . . . 
It reinforces the reality that we were both in Vietnam," Deehan said. 
</P>
<P>
"He brought pictures of himself in the hospital, but I don't recognize that 
man. In person, he's like the man I remember. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good that I was part of the team that helped him recover. But he never 
thought he was going to die. He's the chauvinist I thought he'd be. He's a good 
guy and he's friendly. I think we'll see each other again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Benedict frequently gets together with his Army buddies, but Deehan often has 
wished she had had a support group to deal with the losses in her personal and 
military lives. She corresponded with her Vietnam nurse roommate for a few 
years and still keeps in touch with one doctor. 
</P>
<P>
"Vietnam was the most significant event in my life," the soft-spoken 
45-year-old Deehan said. "It made me into an excellent nurse. It gave me my 
professional direction and taught me the value of camaraderie and teamwork." 
</P>
<P>
Deehan, orphaned in her sophomore year of college, joined the Army in 1967 to 
finance the rest of her education. "I knew nothing about Vietnam. I was a 
small-town girl from Phoenix, N.Y., who had lived a sheltered life." 
</P>
<P>
She volunteered for Vietnam, although "it wasn't quite what I thought it would 
be," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We cleaned their kidneys and shipped the men to other hospitals. Antibiotics 
available now were not around then. Many patients died. Most were comatose, and 
I never got to talk or listen to them. We rarely knew who lived or died once 
they left," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Benedict knew that many patients in the medical unit died. After his legs were 
amputated, he came home to a Denver hospital for rehabilitation. He walked on 
prosthetic devices 4 1/2 months after the mine explosion, he said. Within the 
same year, he taught himself to ski. 
</P>
<P>
"Post-Vietnam War syndrome is nonsense," Benedict said. "I'm a tough cookie. I 
had been wounded twice before I lost my legs. Sure, war is traumatic. It messes 
up some minds, but not mine. Everyone can cope. I did. My biggest fear was that 
the Army wouldn't use me anymore and that my fighting days were ended." 
</P>
<P>
Before the war, he earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Nebraska 
and married his college sweetheart. They now have two sons, ages 20 and 24. 
</P>
<P>
He recalls that his younger son, who never saw him with legs, thought all dads 
took their legs off at night. "I've always worn shorts and when someone stared 
at me, the boys wanted to respond. I told them it was OK. The stares were just 
normal curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all wars are immoral, especially Vietnam. As for my own wounds, I've 
never been conscious of super-depression over losing my legs. I was 26, not 18. 
I had traveled and lived. If I had been 18 or 19, I don't know. . . . I 
enlisted because I knew I'd do a good job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He went on to command infantry units in the United States, retiring as a major 
in 1978. Benedict then became competition director with the Handicapped Sports 
Assn. Now, as director of disabled skiers for the U.S. Ski Team, he travels the 
world and will join a team of alpine skiers in Japan in February. 
</P>
<P>
After her stint in the Army, Deehan worked at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in 
Boston, where dialysis and kidney transplantation were developed. She later 
taught medical and surgical nursing at Lawrence Memorial in Medford, Mass., for 
10 years, eventually becoming director of the school. Five years ago, she 
became assistant director of the Los Angeles County School of Nursing and 
joined the Kaiser staff in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Deehan went to Washington to see the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall. 
"It was like opening an old wound," she said. "I was so very sad." 
</P>
<P>
Benedict visits the Vietnam Memorial Wall whenever he's near Washington. He 
knows the names of everyone in his unit who was killed. "I only go to pay my 
respect to men who served with me," he said. "They did their jobs well." 
</P>
<P>
He also teaches scuba diving in Denver. Once a year, he visits California, 
joining fellow scuba instructors who dive for abalone and lobster near the 
Channel Islands off Santa Barbara. This year, Benedict arrived early for the 
dive to spend the day with his former Vietnam nurse.

CRITIC AT LARGE: PHANTOMS OF THE BACK LOT; 
</P>
<P>
FIRE LEAVES EMBERS WHERE MUCH OF UNIVERSAL'S MOVIE MAGIC WAS MADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once, years ago, when I was doing a story on the back lot at 
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for West magazine here at the paper, I imagined what a 
great location it would be for a mystery. With its crazy-quilt of streets and 
structures and cultures, tumbled together like a child's dream, it seemed alive 
with stories, and ghosts. 
</P>
<P>
I even conjured up a quick synopsis about an old actor, crazed by a life of 
failure, who dwelt undetected among those fragments of old plots and foraged 
out to take his revenge on those he imagined had thwarted his career. 
</P>
<P>
And as I watched part of Universal's great back lot go up in those fittingly 
cinematic flames on television two nights ago, I thought of all my roamings on 
Hollywood's back lots over the years, and it struck me again that the back lots 
have always had an eerie, poignant and provocative life of their own. 
</P>
<P>
If you are a movie buff, of course, it is engrossing to walk the back lots and 
try to remember where you might have glimpsed that storefront, that seedy hotel 
entrance, that waterfront cafe, that theater marquee, that picket fence. 
(Didn't Andy Hardy park his first roadster there?) 
</P>
<P>
Where there are embers now on the Universal lot, Robert Redford and Paul Newman 
had conned their way through "The Sting." It had been Kansas City for Clint 
Eastwood and Burt Reynolds in "City Heat" and any place you could wreck a car 
for John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd in "The Blues Brothers." It was made to shake 
for "Earthquake" and Diana Ross filled it with sweeter sounds in "Lady Sings 
the Blues." And most recently, it was the splashy big town backdrop for Dick 
Tracy and his gal Tess Trueheart. 
</P>
<P>
Most back lot sets change roles as frequently as the actors themselves. But the 
Norman Bates "Psycho" house became a landmark, and there are still the false 
fronts and the billboards that created turn-of-the-century Manhattan for 
"Hello, Dolly!" on the lot at Twentieth Century Fox. But at Universal as 
elsewhere there were also the generic shops that became a hundred different 
cities or maybe a thousand, or the clapboard houses that stood on Main Street 
in villages in every state in the Union, the boardwalks that heard the clink of 
spurs and the sound of hoofbeats. 
</P>
<P>
It was the closeness of one culture to another that made the back lots -- I 
suppose Warners must be the most extensive one left -- so bizarrely enchanting. 
Marseilles abuts Manhattan, which adjoined the jungle or who knew what else. 
Tarzan, misjudging a swing, could have lit in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Walking a back lot should have been entirely destructive of illusion. The 
doorways lead to nowhere. Squinting through the grimy shop windows you are 
likely to see only some loose boards or a length of old rope or the ancient 
leavings of some crewman's lunch. The buildings are all sham -- fronts and an 
occasional side, and the enduring granite of the bank building is seen to be 
gray-painted plywood that has begun to curl at the edges. 
</P>
<P>
All illusion, all fakery. But that turns out to be the peculiar and alluring 
charm of back lots like Universal's. Even more than real places, they somehow 
remain suffused, or haunted, with the presences of all those who acted out 
their celluloid tales in those spaces, taking their pratfalls, tearing their 
hearts out, running to embrace lovers, fleeing the stalking peril -- making the 
illusions believable because we wanted to believe them. 
</P>
<P>
In a day that wants even heavier infusions of reality, the back lots have been 
relatively less used. Many of the structures, as you stroll about, look long 
abandoned and perilously dry in a dry climate. It is not surprising that all 
back lots have been prey to fires, despite the fact that the studios maintain 
their own fire departments. 
</P>
<P>
What goes up in flames, or, as at MGM, under the developers' bulldozers, is not 
necessarily that valuable in dollars. But it was the priceless proof of a 
special kind of genius. The "Once upon a time," "Tell me a story" tradition 
that is as old as speech itself was brought up to date in the 20th Century by 
wizardly men and women who imagined how to find Tahiti in a bucket of sand, 
fashion ancient Rome with some plaster of Paris and carved linoleum or create 
the whole world, plus occasional glimpses of heaven and hell, on a chicken 
ranch in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The films live on in their ghostly ways, but the ghosts themselves will need 
new quarters.

'WISEGUY' GETS OLDER -- AND WISER; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: CO-CREATOR STEPHEN J. CANNELL HAS RETURNED TO SIMPLIFY THE CBS 
SERIES, WHICH HAS A NEW STAR AND WRITING STAFF. LAST SEASON, HE SAID, 'YOU 
COULDN'T FIGURE WHAT WAS GOING ON.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's not the same old "Wiseguy" that will be kicking off its fourth season 
Saturday night. The CBS series will boast a new star, Steven Bauer, a new 
female cast member, a new co-executive producer and a new writing staff. 
</P>
<P>
"It is sort of like bringing it back from the dead," said Stephen J. Cannell, 
the co-creator and executive producer who has returned to "Wiseguy." 
</P>
<P>
Though never a ratings blockbuster, "Wiseguy," which followed the exploits of 
an undercover federal agent who infiltrated crime organizations, was a critical 
success that boasted such diverse guest stars as Ray Sharkey, Kevin Spacey, 
Jerry Lewis, Ron Silver, Joan Chen and Tim Curry. After its second season, the 
series received numerous Emmy nominations, including one as best drama series 
and one for leading actor Ken Wahl. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, however, the small-but-loyal audience began tuning out in droves 
because of muddled story lines and the absence of Wahl for several episodes, 
due to an ankle injury. As a result, "Wiseguy" didn't make CBS' fall schedule, 
receiving instead a mid-season pickup for 13 episodes. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, Cannell said, was that "Wiseguy" became too wise for its own good. 
</P>
<P>
"If you didn't watch (regularly) -- and not only watch it, but make a graph of 
it -- you couldn't figure what was going on," he said. "What happened is that 
people would tune in, get confused and stay away." 
</P>
<P>
Cannell wasn't involved much in the show last season, but he is now. His 
intention is "to go back to the same kind of storytelling we did in the first 
and second seasons." Although some story lines will still have an arc over 
several episodes, each installment will also have self-contained stories to 
accommodate casual viewers. 
</P>
<P>
Wahl's exit from the show was the subject of controversy last season. Wahl told 
The Times in June that he was dropped from the show against his will, while the 
producers maintained that the actor had wanted to leave. Cannell acknowledged 
recently that the two did have creative differences. He said that he wanted to 
deal with the moral problems that an undercover agent has, while Wahl, he said, 
"thought it was very difficult for him to be playing a guy who had any naivete 
about his situation." 
</P>
<P>
The upshot is that Saturday's two-hour season premiere finds Wahl's character, 
agent Vinnie Terranova, missing and presumed dead. Agent Frank McPike (Jonathan 
Banks) conducts an investigation that leads him to Miami and to an uneasy 
alliance with Michael Santana (Bauer), a disbarred Cuban-American prosecutor 
who had worked with Terranova. 
</P>
<P>
Santana is drawn into the investigation when it leads to Amado Guzman 
(Maximilian Schell), a powerful Cuban-American businessman for whom Santana's 
father works. Santana gets a job with Guzman's company when he discovers that 
Guzman's freight airline is a cover for illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
"The easiest thing we could have done is the 'Son of Vinnie' and do something 
about another Sicilian American from Brooklyn in the mold Ken Wahl created," 
said Peter Lance, the show's new co-executive producer. "But when Stephen 
finally fixed on Steven Bauer as the new hero, we looked to his roots. He was 
born in Cuba and came to America, so we said, 'Why don't we explore that?' The 
Cuban-Americans, next to the Vietnamese, are the most interesting recent ethnic 
group to come to America. They have completely revitalized Miami, so we 
decided, why not go in this direction?" 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't ask for a more ideal situation," said Bauer, who appeared in such 
films as "Scarface" and the Emmy Award-winning NBC miniseries "Drug Wars: The 
Camarena Story." "The show had loyal supporters and I am part of its new 
chance, its new life. It can only get better unless with me it dies, but I 
don't think that will happen. The character is brand-new and he is coming from 
an ethnic cultural background that is brand new to TV." 
</P>
<P>
Actress Cecil Hoffmann, who appeared on the short-lived NBC series "Dream 
Street," also is joining the cast as attorney Hilary Stein, who was Santana's 
co-counsel and now works with Guzman. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided the show needed the involvement of a woman in a big way," Lance 
said. "Even in the first season, with Vinnie and Susan Profitt (with whom 
Vinnie fell in love), there was a sense that women could watch the show and 
have some franchise in it. It had taken a turn away from that." 
</P>
<P>
Lance said that "Wiseguy" is going to have an uphill climb in order to succeed, 
however. In its regular time slot of Saturdays at 10 p.m., it will be competing 
with "Carol &amp; Company" on NBC and "Twin Peaks" on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
"So many people left the show last year that (CBS) pulled the reruns this 
summer; that's how bad it got," he said. "There's also the Jane Pauley 
Syndrome, which is a valid one: The public gets angry when you change heroes. 
(But) what we have tried to do is so ambitious and so different, I have a lot 
of faith in the American public. . . . Audiences love their heroes and 
heroines, but people also like a good hour of TV."

TELEVISION: ANALYSTS AND ANCHORS JOCKEY FOR POSITION IN EXCITING LOCAL AND 
NATIONAL COVERAGE OF POLITICAL RACES HIGHLIGHTED BY CLOSE FINISHES AT THE WIRE.

"Things are just getting interesting," Jerry Dunphy said at 12:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"As you can see, we're closing the gap," Dianne Feinstein said at 12:50 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of night that makes politics fun," Bill Press said at 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete Wilson is the winner," KCBS Channel 2 said at 1:40 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to bed," I told myself at 1:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
But who could sleep at a time like this? It was the kind of night that made 
politics fun. 
</P>
<P>
In all likelihood, you didn't watch if you didn't vote. Chances are that you 
didn't watch much even if you did vote. 
</P>
<P>
Then what you missed Tuesday -- from early in the evening to 2:20 a.m. 
Wednesday, when Dunphy's KCAL Channel 9 became the last Los Angeles station to 
end its election-night coverage -- was the best, most exciting show on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
Almost like old times. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the Wilson-Feinstein gubernatorial cliffhanger, the evening was an 
all-night poker game, a throwback to a less sophisticated age when Americans 
could enjoy a night of election coverage without having their suspense aborted 
by exit polls and quick-draw projections. In those days, just like Tuesday, the 
trickling in of returns became exquisitely tantalizing foreplay, leading to a 
climactic Big Announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, there were exit polls and projections galore throughout the evening, all 
right, with the networks saving money by collaborating on a single polling 
operation whose data was shared with their affiliates. Even as results from 
other races flashed on the screen, however, the hair-triggers were slowed by 
the extreme closeness of several contests, including the centerpiece 
Wilson-Feinstein race, whose outcome was not projected until early the next 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
And even then, confusion hit the fan. 
</P>
<P>
There was KNBC Channel 4's Bill Lagattuta at Feinstein headquarters, seeking 
the response of one of her aides, Duane Garrett, to Channel 4's projection of 
Wilson's victory. But Garrett emphatically told a perplexed Lagattuta that CBS 
(meaning KCBS, apparently) had called Feinstein the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, KCBS had called Wilson the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Cut to KCAL, which apparently had been monitoring Channel 4. KCAL analysts 
Press and Bay Buchanan, after making their own call for Wilson, then proceeded 
to perpetuate Garrett's misinformation by wondering how in the world KCBS could 
have projected a Feinstein victory. 
</P>
<P>
Which it hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
It was a bizarre way to cap a night in which local stations had to shift gears 
abruptly to cover the fiery inferno at Universal Studios, affirming that 
covering disasters is, arguably, what local TV does best. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest, chopper-view live pictures of the blaze, on Channel 4, Channel 9, 
KABC Channel 7 and KTTV Channel 11, were spectacular, making an emotional 
U-turn in an evening otherwise dominated by election and entertainment 
programming. KCBS was the slowpoke: Although it provided some early 
ground-level coverage, Channel 2 didn't have live overhead pictures until 
nearly 9 p.m., trailing some of its competition by as much as 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
This was a night for anchors. 
</P>
<P>
On most other occasions, showing up and reading a TelePrompTer is about all 
that's required of them. But Tuesday was an exception, not only because of the 
election coverage, but also because of the need to react quickly to the 
Universal fire. 
</P>
<P>
Concerning Universal, Channel 7's Paul Moyer and Ann Martin and Channel 4's 
Kelly Lange get good marks for being especially cool and collected under 
pressure while handling fire inserts.

<P>
Much earlier, when election returns were beginning to come in from across the 
nation, it was Dan Rather who was uniquely arresting, not only because CBS' 
coverage seemed especially clear and crisp, but also because of Rather himself. 
</P>
<P>
In his shirt sleeves and suspenders, lacking only a green eyeshade to complete 
the picture of a small-town editor, Rather sounded like a cross between John 
Wayne and Farmer Dan. Some of Tuesday night's election Danisms: 
</P>
<P>
"He's a comer, now he's a goner." 
</P>
<P>
"Hey Mabel, come in from the kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
"No, sir, he wins re-election." 
</P>
<P>
"Herd 'em up, move 'em out." 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, hello, what's this?" 
</P>
<P>
"He's long gone." 
</P>
<P>
"He's hanging right tight on the taillights." 
</P>
<P>
"You could put a cigarette paper between the two of them." 
</P>
<P>
"Here's one. Well, howdy." 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way, Jose, or anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
And Rather to Connie Chung, after acknowledging he had misspoken about an 
election return: "See if you can pull my made-a-mistake chestnuts outta the 
fire here." 
</P>
<P>
No one had to rescue Channel 4's Jess Marlow and Linda Douglass, who were far 
and away the smoothest and most election-literate local anchors on the air 
Tueday night. Douglass, the station's political reporter, in particular was 
that rare commodity, an intelligent anchor-analyst. And Channel 4's "election 
ticker" -- perpetual election returns running across the bottom of the picture 
-- turned out to be a fine innovation as well. 
</P>
<P>
If Marlow and Douglass were the best, the worst of the night's anchors resided 
on Channel 11, which apparently was trying to hide Patti Davis Suarez's 
ad-libbing deficiencies by having her front election coverage -- as if she were 
stuffed and mounted only for display -- without actually taking part. 
</P>
<P>
Well, she did take part occasionally. But her stilted live interviews -- 
seemingly done from scripted questions a la "Broadcast News" -- were a 
disaster. And curiously, when it came to serious anchoring, that chore fell to 
the able Dave Bryan in Washington for election coverage and to equally able 
Chris Harris for the fire story. 
</P>
<P>
This was an evening where pundits proliferated, with posturing George Putnam 
and Joe Cerell offering low burlesque on Channel 11, for example, in contrast 
to the general intelligence of Stu Spencer and Susan Estrich on Channel 2. The 
latter's conversational analysis, in conjunction with Channel 2's Terry Anzur, 
became more and more seductive as the evening wore on. 
</P>
<P>
The most rewarding of the political chatterers, however, were Buchanan and 
Press (who co-hosts a radio show on KABC-AM radio) on Channel 9. They made you 
feel as if you were joining them around a kitchen table as they hashed over the 
election into the wee hours. 
</P>
<P>
The most scholarly analysis anywhere, however, came from NBC's Andrea Mitchell 
on Wednesday morning's "Today" show. In a year when the electorate was depicted 
as anxious to "throw the bums out of office," why did so many incumbents win? 
Because, replied Mitchell, "the bums who were running against the bums weren't 
as good as the bums who were in there." 
</P>
<P>
Hey Mabel, come in from the kitchen.

Send in your orders now for a hogshead (that's an aging barrel holding the

is charging only $2,700, which works out to a bargain $12 per bottle. Of 
course, you won't get any of it until the scotch has completed its aging -- 
which won't be until 1999. On the other hand, you'll get a newsletter on its 
progress and you can always come to the distillery to inspect your own 
hogshead. For details, call (212) 725-9144.

ON READING FOOD

My first cookbook was a floppy orange thing that came free with a wok as 
something of an owner's manual. The book was useless as a guide to Chinese 
cooking -- as I recall, servants had done all the cooking for the author, who 
was trying to re-create his favorite dishes from an apartment in Ohio -- but 
fascinating as a portrait of American China-hands before the revolution, 
affable, paternalistic businessmen who lived well, spoke no Chinese and were 
completely at a loss to explain the culture on which they depended so much. You 
could read any number of novels or histories of the period -- and I have, from 
Suzie Wong to Jan Morris -- but you couldn't find as direct an expression of 
what the last few colonials really thought of themselves, their daily routine, 
and how they related to their dying colony. A report from the front, no matter 
how unintentional, is more fascinating than a workable recipe for moo goo gai 
pan. 
</P>
<P>
Writers let parts of themselves seep into their cookbooks that they'd sooner 
die than reveal in a novel or business memoir. A library of cookbooks contains 
a thousand secret histories, political manifestoes disguised as recipes for 
tuna salad, love affairs sublimated into showers of garlic and truffles. 
</P>
<P>
Novels are about the extraordinary; cookbooks about the mundane, and you can 
learn more about a man from the way he likes to make scrambled eggs in the 
morning than you might from his battles and affairs. Eating is, after all, one 
of the few human functions whose description excites no censor. 
</P>
<P>
What marks good food writing is passion, often sensual passion displaced from 
its normal course, and not just in Gael Greene-style baring of the loins. Some 
of us consult Mexican-cookbook writer Diana Kennedy because we want to learn 
how to cook posole. But her books also convey the picaresque adventures of a 
high-born foreign correspondent's widow loathe to leave the land of her 
greatest happiness, sadder than Graham Greene novels and more real, a portrait 
of sensual obsession sublimated into food. Food is sexy to M.F.K. Fisher, a 
loaf of good bread inseparable from the firm, white teeth of the man who bites 
into it, and it is this intertwining of food and desire that drives us to read 
her indifferent collections of recipes 40 years after they were written. 
Elizabeth David's best cookbooks, dating from the early '50s, are pure memory 
and desire, making vivid Mediterranean flavors dance for an audience of 
postwar-grim, food-rationing Brits. 
</P>
<P>
In the kind of cookbooks I like -- none of that proscriptive "Diet for a Small 
Planet" stuff, thank you very much -- sensual experience makes for happier, 
healthier, better people, more cheerful because better fed. In the introduction 
to the first Chez Panisse cookbook, an inspiration-seeking Alice Waters pulls a 
bunch of fresh thyme out of her pocket and lays it on her kitchen table; the 
detail rings true -- she must be the kind of person who keeps fresh thyme in 
her pocket, precisely the sort of quirk that makes us fall in love with a 
character in Colette or Muriel Spark -- and we understand her passion for food. 
</P>
<P>
Marion Cunningham's new revision of Fanny Farmer is an enveloping, educated 
bourgeois world, a warm, sensible household where people throw splendid dinner 
parties and know about pies and smoked-tomato sauces and how to steam asparagus 
in the microwave. You can almost see the Volvos parked in the circular driveway 
out front. Victoria Wise's "Good and Plenty" sets down the routine of a loving, 
chaotic family where somebody unexpected always shows up at the supper table, 
all between the lines of a hundred-odd recipes designed to serve six. I've 
never felt the need to use a recipe from that book, but I've read it a half a 
dozen times as if it were fiction. Fred Plotkin's underrated "Authentic Pasta 
Book" seems to be the self-portrait of an obsessive, solitary man devoted 
equally to Italian opera and to exquisite recipes for pasta-for-one. Know how a 
person eats, and you know how he lives. 
</P>
<P>
A good cookbook, like a novel, can make us dream. But while, outside of a Woody 
Allen story, none of us can ever sleep with Emma Bovary, we can, given the time 
and desire, eat Richard Olney's sorrel soup or the cassoulet that Paula Wolfert 
goes on about, in the privacy of our homes. Imagine a copy of GQ or a 
Victoria's Secret brochure as a catalogue of available romantic partners. 
Cookbooks are different from novels, because reading is only the first step; 
the pleasures within are at least theoretically reproducible. 
</P>
<P>
The process of reading a cookbook can be like that of a conductor reading 
through a score. As a skilled musician is able to glance at a scherzo of Brahms 
and hear in his head the spiky shape of a melody, the irregular massing of a 
chord, so is an amateur of food able to see a Sicilian pasta recipe that calls 
for raisins, wild fennel and sardines and anticipate the taste. 
</P>
<P>
When we learn how to cook, we learn how ingredients brown and rise and blend, 
how to make a piecrust and to roast a bird. When we run across something like 
"A Gastronomic Tour of the Scandinavian Arctic," a celebration of haute 
Laplander cuisine filled with recipes for snow grouse, clever things to do with 
bleak roe and the best way to clarify reindeer consomme, we know exactly what 
the book is talking about even if we've never run across those ingredients in 
our lives. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody needs more than a few cookbooks, perhaps, and most people don't actually 
cook all the way through more than a few. (Personally, I've gotten about 
halfway through Paula Wolfert's "Cooking of South-West France" . . . and 
worried more about the general unavailability of goose fat than any Southern 
Californian ought to.) A "Joy of Cooking" for the basics, plus maybe a Julia 
Child, a Marcella Hazan or "Cucina Fresca," and a dog-eared vegetarian cookbook 
left over from college days are sufficient to feed us and our families very 
well. But cookbooks, while they can be useful instruction manuals, are first 
and foremost books -- a man who tires of cookbooks is also tired of life.

COOKBOOK FAVORITES -- THE VOLUMES THAT CHANGED OUR LIVES

In college I lived on hamburgers and tuna casserole like everybody else until I 
found a tattered Indian cookbook in a new apartment. For three years after 
that, I sat at the keyboard of a mighty spice Wurlitzer, glibly varying recipes 
by varying spice mixtures. All flavors were good; all flavor combinations were 
equal. 
</P>
<P>
Then some old college friends got interested in French cooking, which I had 
always thought of as a fussy and probably fraudulent business of truffles and 
cream sauce, and they cooked me some dishes from the English writer Elizabeth 
David's first book, "French Country Cooking." I tried them expecting to mock, 
but found I couldn't. To my chagrin, it had just dawned on me that some flavor 
combinations are actually better than others. 
</P>
<P>
One of the dishes was a variation on the lamb and potato stew known as navarin, 
made with spring vegetables that give it a light, sweet, spring-like flavor. 
Unfortunately, delicate baby turnips aren't available all year and winter 
carrots tend to be thick and coarse, but at least you can always get frozen 
petits pois (though the freezer bag may just call them small peas). Properly 
speaking, then, you should only cook this during spring, but I get a hankering 
for this dish even during the winter because it recalls those dinners that 
changed my life. 
</P>
<P>
NAVARIN PRINTANIER (Spring Lamb Stew) 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
3 pounds lamb shoulder or breast, cut in squares 
</P>
<P>
3 small onions, sliced 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons flour 
</P>
<P>
2 1/4 cups chicken or beef broth 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon black pepper 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons rosemary 
</P>
<P>
1 crushed clove garlic 
</P>
<P>
1 bay leaf 
</P>
<P>
1 pound new potatoes, as small as you can find 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups diced carrots 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup diced turnip 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 pounds frozen small peas 
</P>
<P>
Melt butter in stewpot. Brown meat over medium heat, remove and then brown 
onions. Remove onions, fry flour in butter until light brown, then slowly add 
broth, stirring until smooth. 
</P>
<P>
Return meat and onions to pot with salt, pepper, rosemary, garlic and bay leaf. 
Simmer covered until meat is nearly cooked, about 1 hour. 
</P>
<P>
Add potatoes, carrots and turnip and cook slowly for another 35 to 40 minutes. 
Then add peas and cook until done. Makes 6 servings.

COOKBOOK FAVORITES -- THE VOLUMES THAT CHANGED OUR LIVES

I was at a loss to come up with a favorite cookbook until a co-worker posed the 
following question: "If you were moving to some obscure place and could take 
only one cookbook, what would it be?" It took me only minutes to decide on 
"Cooking A to Z" (Ortho Books, 1988: $32.95). 
</P>
<P>
This volume -- edited by Jane Horn, with recipes created in consultation with 
the chefs of the California Culinary Academy -- is an encyclopedia of terms, 
techniques, ingredients, equipment and more than 600 recipes. It's one of the 
books I use extensively in researching my weekly Back to Basics and You Asked 
About . . . columns. 
</P>
<P>
The book is anything but trendy. But by using its solid base of information, my 
past experience in recipe development and testing, and observations of current 
trends, even if I lived in a remote area, I'd still have an edge on keeping up 
with the culinary scene. 
</P>
<P>
Take the pate maison recipe, for example. It uses classic techniques: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lining the pan with pork fat 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mixing the forcemeats with herbs and spices 
</P>
<P>
 -- Layering the ingredients 
</P>
<P>
 -- Baking the mixture in a bain marie 
</P>
<P>
 -- Weighting the cooked pate 
</P>
<P>
 -- Storing the finished recipe a day or more before serving. 
</P>
<P>
By applying these guidelines but substituting ingredients currently in vogue, 
you can create variations that might show up on some of the hottest menus in 
town. 
</P>
<P>
PATE MAISON 
</P>
<P>
1/2 medium onion, minced 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons Cognac or Armagnac 
</P>
<P>
1 pound ground pork 
</P>
<P>
1 pound ground veal 
</P>
<P>
1 clove garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
2 eggs, slightly beaten 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon dried thyme 
</P>
<P>
1 chicken breast, boned and skinned 
</P>
<P>
1 pound pork fat, cut into 1/8-inch slices 
</P>
<P>
2 ounces pistachio nuts, shelled 
</P>
<P>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a small skillet saute onion in butter over 
medium-high heat until translucent. Pour in 1/2 cup Cognac. Cook until Cognac 
is absorbed into onion (mixture will measure about 1/3 cup). Remove from heat 
and place in a large mixing bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Add pork, veal, garlic, eggs, salt, pepper and thyme. Mix with hands until 
thoroughly blended, or blend in food processor until light in texture and well 
blended. 
</P>
<P>
Cut chicken breast into 1/2x3-inch slices. Put slices in a small bowl and add 
the remaining 2 tablespoons Cognac. 
</P>
<P>
Line a 2-quart terrine or (12x4 1/2-inch) loaf pan with slices of pork fat. 
Press one half of ground meat mixture into pan. Cover with Cognac-soaked 
chicken, then pistachios. Press remaining ground meat mixture on top. Cover 
with another layer pork fat. 
</P>
<P>
Cover terrine with aluminum foil. Set in a pan of boiling water. Place on rack 
in center of oven. Bake until juices run clear yellow and pate has shrunk from 
sides of pan (about two hours). 
</P>
<P>
When pate is done, remove terrine and set on cooling rack. Place another loaf 
pan on top of pate; fill with 3 to 4 pounds of weight (canned good or bricks 
work well). Let pate cool at room temperature several hours, then pour off 
liquid, recover and weight. Refrigerate 2 to 3 days before slicing. To serve, 
unmold and slice. Serves 10 as a first course. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Sliced bacon may be substituted if pork fat is unavailable.

COOKBOOKS VERSUS CHEFS' BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By LAURIE OCHOA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Jean-Louis Palladin's "Cooking With the Seasons" might be the most beautiful 
cookbook you can buy. In it, Palladin's food is photographed in such sensuous 
detail that browsers in bookstores often blush when they're caught staring too 
long at photographer Fred Maroon's depiction of a lobster mousseline. Foie 
gras-stuffed duck hearts, larger than life, seem more like postmodernist 
sculpture than something to eat; puddles of intensely colored sauce appear to 
float in space. It may be the most useless and, at the same time, influential 
cookbook to come out in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
For the home cook, the Palladin book functions mostly as an art book -- an 
impressive, large and pricey show of good taste. This is a book that doesn't 
even pretend that the person who buys it will be able to recreate the food in 
it. Where even the most impractical books by three-star French chefs look like 
cookbooks, Palladin's seems strictly for the coffee table: Recipes are in small 
type, several to the page, just before the index. Their function is similar to 
that of the footnotes in a scholarly biography. To eat what one sees in the 
pictures, a reader must eat in Palladin's restaurant, Jean-Louis, in 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
But to professional chefs, Palladin's conception of color and space on the 
plate, his aesthetics of food, may serve as inspiration. Chefs read cookbooks 
differently than the rest of us. They cook differently than we do. And they 
write cookbooks differently than other cookbook writers, most of whom make 
their living teaching food, not cooking it in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
The weekend before last, Alice Waters cooked at home. She planned a multicourse 
menu, much as she often does at her restaurant, Chez Panisse. But things didn't 
turn out the way she thought they would. "I never sat down at the table," she 
says over the phone from her home in Berkeley. "I was just standing at the 
stove. It was ridiculous!" 
</P>
<P>
Waters first book, "The Chez Panisse Menu Cookbook," included a long chapter of 
special menus served at Chez Panisse through the years. But she's only now 
discovered just what a home cook brave enough to attempt, say, "A Dinner for 
Ridge Winery" -- which includes, among other things, an onion tart with a puff 
pastry crust and chicken steamed with black truffles under the skin -- might go 
through in an ordinary kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
"When I look back on my first cookbook," Waters says, "at the sort of menus we 
did in the restaurant, I realize how unrealistic the recipes were. I look at 
them now, and . . . agggh! . . . I'm appalled. The way you think about food for 
cooking in a restaurant is not the way you think about it for home." 
</P>
<P>
"If I cook at home," Campanile chef Mark Peel says, "I've got a good hour's 
worth of cleaning up to do because of the habits I've picked up over the years 
in restaurants. I'll scoop leftover ingredients on to the floor. If I need a 
spoon, I'll grab a clean spoon, stir it around a little bit, maybe use it to 
taste the food, then throw it in the sink. If you're a really experienced home 
cook, you use one spoon and one pot, maybe two. That's it. If you're a 
restaurant cook you use them like disposables."

Peel and his wife and partner, Nancy Silverton, are in the final stages of 
writing a cookbook on family cooking. They've tried to create a book with 
simple, understandable recipes, but it hasn't come naturally. 
</P>
<P>
"We put a recipe for ratatouille in the book, which is pretty easy," Peel says. 
"But to make it really good, you have to saute all the vegetables separately. 
That way each vegetable retains its own texture and color and flavor, yet the 
juices marry. If you stew all the vegetables in one pot, some things are mushy 
and some things are raw. 
</P>
<P>
"So as I was making the dish for Edon (Waycott, Peel and Silverton's 
collaborator), she stopped me and said, 'Wait a minute . . . for this one dish 
you've just used six saute pans.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Even something like washing lettuce can take ten minutes," Silverton says. 
"You have to take that into consideration." 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, when Silverton's book, "Desserts," came out, she felt 
differently. "My cookbook is completely impractical," she says. "The people who 
love it are pastry chefs. But my attitude at the time, was, well, they want the 
desserts that I make, so this is what I'm going to give them." 
</P>
<P>
One caramel tart in the book involves 14 complex steps. It took one man, who'd 
attended a class Silverton taught, eight hours to make. "It was a point of 
pride for him that he did it," Peel says. Another recipe calls for 35 passion 
fruits. 
</P>
<P>
"Who would do that?" Silverton asks. "Do you know how much passion fruit costs? 
They're something like a dollar a passion fruit." 
</P>
<P>
"And when you go to Ralph's," Peel says, "they only have something like 6 of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
"That cookbook probably wouldn't get done today," Silverton says. "An editor 
would look at the recipes and say, 'forget it.' " 
</P>
<P>
There are two conflicting forces at work when a chef writes a cookbook. To be 
successful in the bookstores a cookbook must be accessible to home cooks. At 
the same time, chefs are uncomfortable with simplifying, some say compromising, 
their food. Palladin's book may not tell you how to make a fool-proof chicken, 
but years from now it's possible that his book will be referred to in the same 
way that aspiring chefs now look to the books of the great French chef Fernand 
Point. 
</P>
<P>
"What I love about cookbooks is the whole kind of aesthetic they present, which 
is something that somehow comes to a restaurant in a nonverbal way," Waters 
says. "When you have to put that into a book, it's hard. It's just very 
complicated to get those smells in there. You have to create something else 
that is the book, because the book is not the restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
"I think a cookbook should be like a storyteller," Citrus chef Michel Richard 
says. But in writing his yet-to-be released cookbook, Richard, prodded by his 
publisher, decided to write an accessible cookbook. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to make everything very simple," Richard says. "The fish, for 
instance, had to be available in any market in the country." Even so, he found 
it difficult to adjust his food for the home. "We tried the recipes six, seven 
times," he says. "But sometimes we'd test and adjust the recipes so much I 
didn't recognize the food as mine." 
</P>
<P>
"I think chefs' books are on the way out," says Trumps chef Michael Roberts. 
"They have interesting ideas, but no one can really cook the way chefs do 
unless they have a battery of cooks at home and a battery of stoves. You have 
to translate restaurant food into a home context. And if it doesn't translate, 
then it has no reason being in a cookbook." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts' two books -- "Secret Ingredients," a book that explores how flavors 
work together, and the newly released "Fresh From the Freezer" -- are more than 
pages of restaurant recipes from his successful West Hollywood bistro, Trumps. 
"I'm not interested in just listing a bunch of recipes, that's boring to me." 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that I'm a chef in a restaurant is secondary to my books," says 
Angeli chef Evan Kleiman. "Also, my philosophy about food and the way I like to 
cook in a restaurant is almost anti-chef." Her cookbooks, "Cucina Fresca," 
"Pasta Fresca," and "Cucina Rustica," sell well throughout the country. "But 
even now," she says, "my publisher won't allow me to do an Angeli cookbook. 
Publishers don't like chef cookbooks unless you're a superstar." 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose, in one sense," Silverton says, "it's really a rip-off to go through 
all the work of following a chef recipe." 
</P>
<P>
Chefs books can do something better; chefs books can make you think. "You can 
consult other books to get the technical information you need to make the 
food," Waters says. 
</P>
<P>
"People think that somehow you get a recipe and you can cook. But most people 
need to have their senses reawakened. They need to come in contact with and 
understand the source of where their food comes from. Then, maybe they can use 
a recipe. You really can make the evaluations that are necessary to tell what 
is real and genuine and what is not. And what really tastes good . . . and what 
doesn't."

LIFE ON THE ROAD: A COOKBOOK WRITER PAYS HER DUES ON A 10-DAY ODYSSEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"What have you got in this thing, lady?" asked a porter. He was lugging my ice 
chest toward the ticket counter as if he were pulling an Egyptian pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
Who could blame him? A cookbook author on a 10-day, 10-city tour has to take 
along just about everything! 
</P>
<P>
What I had in that thing was this: Pots. Pans. Bowls. Pastry board. Paper 
towels. Oil (to spruce up food that has dried out under hot television lights). 
Ice packs (to keep foods from developing ptomaine). Detergent and sponges (to 
wash dishes in ladies' rooms just in case the television studio "kitchen sink" 
is a fake -- which it usually is). And, of course, food. 
</P>
<P>
"Break a leg," my publisher said, sending me off with a smile. I smiled back. I 
had no idea what was in store. 
</P>
<P>
"Arrive 8 p.m. Monday," said my itinerary. "XYZ TV station demonstration 7 a.m. 
Tuesday." My plane, in fact (delayed due to weather), arrived at 1 a.m. At 6 
a.m. I was in the bowels of the hotel whipping up a quick bastilla. At 7 a.m. I 
arrived at the television studio, food chest in tow. 
</P>
<P>
"You must be the food act," said a grip as I lugged my one-ton ice chest across 
the studio floor. No one lifted a finger to help. "Union rules, you know," said 
the grip, leading me to a fake -- and filthy -- "kitchen counter" set against a 
fake Chicago skyline that doubled as a news team's desk. 
</P>
<P>
Then I had two minutes before it was time to be gorgeous and witty and put out 
a 10-course meal. 
</P>
<P>
It might have been easier had I not chosen a dish using filo. Most of the dough 
I had brought with me dried out after a few days on the road, and I ended up 
doing the entire demonstration substituting sheets of legal-size typewriter 
paper for the dough. "Neat trick," said the television host. 
</P>
<P>
At least it kept the camera crew from devouring the props before show time. On 
another occasion, an entire meal for a morning show disappeared when my back 
was turned. We had to resort to close-up photographs from the book. 
</P>
<P>
But who's complaining? Every author has his road stories. The late Dione Lucas, 
a French chef and one of the first women to go on the road with a cookbook, 
told of carrying a fresh pig's head that was leaking droplets of blood as she 
stepped off the New Haven Railroad. She was stopped by the police and her bag 
was confiscated. The policeman fainted when he opened the bag. She never did 
get her pig back. 
</P>
<P>
Missing ingredients have actually been known to kill books. One author 
promoting a book on a Los Angeles television show ran out of eggnog. She 
substituted colored water thickened with egg white. The host tasted it -- and 
spit it out -- before millions of viewers. That ended the interview -- and the 
book. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid these little problems, many publishers provide an assistant to do the 
shopping, cooking and chauffeuring for the visiting author. "It's important to 
have the day run smoothly," says Lisa Ekus, president of Lisa Ekus Public 
Relations, which specializes in food books. After all, sending an author on a 
tour is not cheap. A single day on the road can cost a publisher $1,000 for a 
novelist and about $1,500 for a cookbook author (because of higher 
out-of-pocket expenses for food and materials). Nevertheless, Ekus estimates 
that touring by cookbook authors has quadrupled in the last five years.

Nevertheless, Ekus estimates that touring by cookbook authors has quadrupled in 
the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
Not every author gets to tour: Publishers look for "mediagenic" personalities. 
"An author has to be effervescent and an intelligent spokesperson who can 
answer interviewer's questions articulately," says Stuart Applebaum, senior 
vice president of publicity and public relations for Bantam Doubleday Dell 
Publishing Group Inc. Adds Ekus: "Some authors may be wonderful writers or 
cooks, but they are duds on the screen." 
</P>
<P>
But help is available -- even for duds, at a price: Ekus offers two-on-one 
media-training sessions to prepare food writers for television appearances at 
$2,000 a session. 
</P>
<P>
"Most television studios want to see what they're getting before they commit to 
having them on the show," says Ekus, who has trained Jasper White, author of 
"Jasper White's Cooking From New England" (Harper &amp; Row); Nicole Routhier, 
who authored "Foods From Vietnam" (Stuart, Tabori &amp; Chang), and Sally 
Schneider, author of "Art of Low Calorie Cooking" (Stuart, Tabori &amp; Chang). 
</P>
<P>
But some old pros don't need Ekus' help. Consider veteran Maida Heatter, author 
of several cookbooks. "I don't carry anything anymore," she says. While 
promoting "Maida Heatter's Book of Great American Desserts" (Alfred A. Knopf: 
$25), Heatter carried only a single jar of chocolate sauce. "All I need to do 
is heat it up and reuse it for the next interview."

THE MAKING OF "CITY CUISINE" 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE OCHOA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger started out they had one tiny 
restaurant, City Cafe. Now they've built an ethnic food empire: Their Border 
Grills serve Mexican cooking influenced by yearly visits to the marketplaces of 
Mexico. At City, their world view expands. When it came to cooking, they found 
instant success doing things their way. But they found cookbook publishers have 
their own ideas: 
</P>
<P>
 FENIGER: When we started talking about doing a book we both felt sure that we 
really wanted a book that would represent us, the restaurant. We wanted a book 
that would work in the kitchen, that would be really functional, that would lay 
flat, that people could use in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
MILLIKEN: But there were a lot of battles to be waged. The publishing business 
is so different from being a cook. The agents we talked to wanted to sell a 
cookbook, but they didn't want to sell our cookbook. Finally, Susan and I went 
to New York and we met with 12 publishers, just the two of us. We had Mike 
Fink, who does all the graphics for us here, do a comp-up of what we wanted. It 
had a spiral binding and acetate covers . . . 
</P>
<P>
FENIGER: It was wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
MILLIKEN: You could go in the kitchen and lay it down on the counter, and it 
wouldn't get all scummy. You could just wash it off. 
</P>
<P>
TIMES: What were the reactions of the publishing people? 
</P>
<P>
FENIGER: Absolutely terrible. 
</P>
<P>
MILLIKEN: They laughed us out of their offices. 
</P>
<P>
TIMES: And said what? 
</P>
<P>
MILLIKEN: This is ridiculous . . . 
</P>
<P>
FENIGER: This is way too expensive. They didn't ask us about the food; the 
issue was the design. 
</P>
<P>
MILLIKEN: We were willing to work with the budget and make it work. But it 
didn't make sense that it couldn't be spiral bound. Everywhere you go there's a 
junior league with a spiral-bound cookbook. When we met Anne Bramson, who 
became our editor, she was more interested in convincing us to do a little 
paperback Border Grill cookbook. We were able to convince her though and she 
really believed in us, she was great. 
</P>
<P>
FENIGER: But we had to convince her . . . 
</P>
<P>
MILLIKEN: At least she was open to it. 
</P>
<P>
FENIGER: What ended up really surprising us, was the actual process of testing 
the recipes. I think we really both felt that . . . 
</P>
<P>
MILLIKEN: . . . it would be a lot easier than it was. 
</P>
<P>
FENIGER: We thought we'd test the first five, six, maybe ten recipes. After 
that we thought we could have one of our strong people in the kitchen test the 
rest. We would just taste. Well, after we did the first ten we thought, there's 
no way. 
</P>
<P>
MILLIKEN: We're very control-oriented people anyway. It was just really 
apparent that no one else could make those decisions about a quarter teaspoon 
of salt, or whatever. Since it's going to be something that's around and living 
for years and years, the recipes had to have exactly the flavor we wanted. 
</P>
<P>
FENIGER: The cooking process was a lot slower than we're used to, just because 
you have to keep track of everything. We couldn't just throw stuff in. 
</P>
<P>
MILLIKEN: And then also, because there are two of us, we'd say, "Do you like 
this?" "Yeah I like it." "Well I don't like it." We had to both agree that we 
liked it. I remember with a couple of dishes it was like, "but this is 
delicious . . ." And then, "No, I don't like that. And I was shocked at how 
much cream we used in some things. Our collaborator Helene (Siegel) kept 
saying, "No more cream! No more cream! But we're always automatically just 
pouring more in. I think the rigatoni and the gnocchi had the most cream. 
</P>
<P>
TIMES: How did the publisher react to the finished book? 
</P>
<P>
FENIGER: Everyone liked it. But they wanted us to come up with those words. 
</P>
<P>
MILLIKEN: We had the cover designed just as it came out, but the marketing 
department had these strips of white going across that said, "Over 250 
mouth-watering recipes!" like some used car salesman. 
</P>
<P>
FENIGER: Or else, "Thai! Japanese! Indian!" It was like, are you kidding? We 
argued it and argued it. 
</P>
<P>
MILLIKEN: For two hours we were in the office at Morrow. We lost the argument. 
But then, we get into the elevator to go downstairs, and we're dejected -- 
really , really . . . 
</P>
<P>
FENIGER: . . . disgusted. 
</P>
<P>
MILLIKEN: Upset. And the elevator door opens and our editor says, "Oh, this is 
the vice president, or the president of the company, and Susan, she's so 
brilliant, she goes up to him and says, "What do you think about the cover of 
this book? Do you think this is good like this?" And he says, "Yeah, I think 
that looks pretty good." Then she says, "Well, do you think it needs like a tag 
line? And he says, "No, absolutely not, it's good just like that." 
</P>
<P>
FENIGER: So I looked at Anne and said, "Anne, that's the answer. He said we 
don't need it." So we didn't have it. It was really great. 
</P>
<P>
MILLIKEN: We were lucky. But you know, even still, Williams-Sonoma won't carry 
the book. They think the cover's too ugly . . . they said it doesn't match 
their store.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: URBAN CUBAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a while I went every Sunday afternoon to El Colmao, a thriving big-city 
Cuban restaurant set among the bodegas and Spanish-language record stores of 
Pico-Union, and I listened to the cumbias that blared from the big jukebox, and 
I got pleasantly drunk on half-liters of cold red wine. El Colmao seems to be 
to Los Angeles Cubans what Ratner's on New York's Lower East Side is to Long 
Island Jews: a good old place in the old neighborhood frequented mostly by 
suburban people who want to feel ethnic once in a while. 
</P>
<P>
My girlfriend at the time, Cuban-born, had an interesting sense of humor: she 
coerced me to order meals for the two of us in sputtering menu Spanish, which 
she mocked to the waitress. She once taught me to ask for the check by saying 
"El check-O, por favor," which busted up the owner and amused everybody in the 
dining room but me. She'd comment loudly on the tight skirts of the women who 
came into the restaurant, in a way that implied she was responding to something 
I'd said. (I was young and inexperienced enough to be a good sport.) After we 
broke up, she got to keep my WWII officer's cape and I got the Sundays at El 
Colmao. 
</P>
<P>
Each time I went to the restaurant I ordered the same things, and after a 
while, the waitresses would just recite my regular order back to me and save me 
the embarrassment of mispronouncing aguacate once again. It was a huge, greasy, 
splendid lunch. 
</P>
<P>
There was always an avocado salad to start -- cool, ripe chunks garnished with 
thin slices of raw onion, which I dressed with splashes of vinegar and torrents 
of good Spanish olive oil; then a heaping plateful of thin, pounded circles of 
unripe plantains, fried crisp as potato chips and dusted with salt. Sometimes I 
ordered an 80 cup of delicious caldo Gallego, a thick, Galician-style 
white-bean soup spiked with shredded collard greens and smoky chunks of ham and 
sausage, that made even the dry, puffy Cuban rolls taste good. 
</P>
<P>
And then the food would come: Pla-Doh-textured boiled yuca, the color of a 
legal pad, sauced with oil, lemon and a truly astounding quantity of garlic; a 
big plateful of moros y cristianos (Moors and Christians), which is a tasty 
miscegenation of black beans and rice fried with garlic and gobbets of fat 
pork; piles of fried fresh ham, pierna de puerco, crisp and brown on the 
outside and meltingly tender within, topped with an immoderate portion of 
caramelized onions, all washed down with cold red wine served in those flared 
jugs pizzerias use for Almaden, poured into chilled glasses that still had bits 
of crushed ice clinging to their rims. (The wine was pretty bad, but anything 
subtler would have been lost in the avalanche of garlic.) For dessert there was 
good flan and torpor and cups of strong Cuban espresso to wake us up a little. 
The check rarely exceeded $20 for two; it seems to average about $25 now. 
</P>
<P>
Even thinking about that meal makes me want to reach for a breath mint and take 
a nap. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, though I've cut back to about one El Colmao meal a month, and I 
still order the same thing every time -- I've tried to vary it a couple of 
times, but the only time a waitress believed me was when I ended up with a 
plateful of dryish turkey-roll asada -- I've managed to try most of the things 
I'd only seen sail by before. 
</P>
<P>
Various fried steaks and chops are garlicky and fine, if a little dry sometimes 
(the pierna asada can sometimes be dry, too). The arroz con pollo is about the 
best thing: a big, fragrant bowl of rice, stained Easter-chick yellow with 
achiote, studded with pimientos and the meat of at least a quarter-chicken, and 
of a pure chicken flavor. Chicken is also available sauteed with garlic and 
tomatoes (you can also get a big hunk of halibut done that way too), or sauteed 
and glazed with an intense sauce of sherry and fried onions. There's a good 
version of the shredded-beef stew called ropa vieja, and a delicious smoked 
pork chop served only at weekday lunch. There's real, fizzy Asturian cider 
served in flat Champagne bowls. 
</P>
<P>
And as it turns out, you can order in English. 
</P>
<P>
"I was wondering when you'd figure that out," the waitress said. 
</P>
<P>
 El Colmao, 2328 W. Pico Blvd., Los Angeles, (213) 386-6131. Open Wed.-Sat and 
Mon., 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.; Sun., noon to 9:30 p.m. Cash only. Lot parking.

<P>
Sometimes, after a long, busy work day, you need a luxurious meal. Served with 
wine and lit by candlelight, this easy dinner lets you pamper yourself without 
the fuss and expense of eating out. 
</P>
<P>
The main course is easy and fast. Simply pop the Dungeness crab, covered, in 
the microwave on HIGH for several minutes to steam. Melt some butter with 
crushed herbs, lemon juice or garlic and along with French bread, serve with 
the crab. 
</P>
<P>
With the time you save, you can make dessert. Dress up packaged angel food cake 
with espresso-flavored whipped cream and colorful berries. Chopped praline made 
from caramelized sugar and cashews adds crunch and sweet flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Whipped in the food processor, the cream won't be as fluffy as real whipped 
cream but it's smoother, richer and more stable. However, watch carefully -- 
whipped cream that spends too much time in the food processor turns into 
butter.

YOU ASKED ABOUT: BAGELS, MUFFINS: SWEET DELIGHTS OF SOURDOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Question: I'm enjoying the sourdough starter I made from a recipe in the Los 
Angeles Times some time ago. We like the pancakes, bread and biscuits, but I've 
been unable to find a recipe for sourdough English muffins. Can you solve my 
problem? Also, is it possible to make a sourdough bagel? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: We found recipes for both in "Sourdough Cookery" (HP Books: 1981) by 
Rita Davenport. 
</P>
<P>
SOURDOUGH ENGLISH MUFFINS 
</P>
<P>
1 package dry yeast 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup warm (105 degrees) water 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons yellow cornmeal 
</P>
<P>
2 3/4 cups flour, about 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon baking soda 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1 cup sourdough starter 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup buttermilk 
</P>
<P>
Shortening 
</P>
<P>
Sprinkle yeast over water. Set aside to soften 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Cover large baking sheet with wax paper. Sprinkle with 1 tablespoon cornmeal. 
Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Stir together 2 3/4 cups flour, 1/4 cup cornmeal, baking soda and salt in large 
bowl. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Combine sourdough starter, buttermilk and softened yeast mixture in medium 
bowl. Stir into flour mixture until blended. 
</P>
<P>
Turn out onto lightly floured surface. Knead 5 to 8 minutes or until smooth and 
elastic. Add more flour if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Roll out dough 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick. Cut muffins with 3-inch biscuit cutter or 
top of 3-inch-wide drinking glass. Arrange muffins on prepared baking sheet. 
Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon cornmeal. 
</P>
<P>
Cover muffins with cloth and set aside in warm place free from drafts. Let rise 
45 minutes or until doubled. 
</P>
<P>
Place griddle over medium to medium-high heat until drop of water bounces over 
surface. Light grease griddle. Turning often, cook raised muffins on medium-hot 
griddle about 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Cool on rack. Serve warm or at room temperature. Makes 12 to 14 muffins. 
</P>
<P>
Variation: After cooking 15 to 20 minutes, split muffins and place cut side 
down on griddle. Turning often, cook 3 to 4 minutes until lightly browned. 
</P>
<P>
SOURDOUGH BAGELS 
</P>
<P>
1 package dry yeast 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup warm (105 degrees) water

<P>
3 to 4 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
Shortening 
</P>
<P>
4 quarts water 
</P>
<P>
Sprinkle yeast over water. Set aside to soften 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Beat eggs in large bowl. Stir in sourdough starter, salt, 2 tablespoons sugar, 
oil and softened yeast mixture. Stir in enough flour to make stiff dough. Turn 
out onto lightly floured surface. 
</P>
<P>
Clean and lightly grease bowl. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Knead dough 8 to 10 minutes or until smooth and elastic. Add more flour if 
necessary. Place in greased bowl, turning to grease all sides. Cover with cloth 
and set aside in warm place free from drafts. Let rise 1 1/2 to 2 hours or 
until doubled. 
</P>
<P>
Grease and flour large baking sheet. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Punch dough down and turn out onto lightly floured surface. Knead again about 3 
minutes. Divide into 12 equal pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Flour hands. Shape each dough piece into ball. Use thumb to press hole in 
center of each ball. Gently enlarge hole by turning ball in hands and form 
dough into doughnut shape. 
</P>
<P>
Arrange shaped dough on prepared baking sheet. Cover with cloth and set aside 
in warm place free from drafts. Let rise 15 to 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Preheat broiler, if necessary. Bring water and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar to 
gentle boil in 5-quart sauce pot. Meanwhile broil bagels 2 minutes on each

</P>
<P>
Herb Bagels: Add 2 teaspoons dried leaf marjoram before adding flour. 
</P>
<P>
Onion Bagels: Add 1 teaspoon dried minced onion before adding flour. 
</P>
<P>
Raisin Bagels: Add 1/2 cup raisins before adding flour. 
</P>
<P>
Whole-Wheat Bagels: Replace 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour with 1 1/2 cups 
whole-wheat flour. Stir into sourdough mixture. Stir in enough remaining 
all-purpose flour to make stiff dough.

INCUMBENTS WINNERS IN MAJOR RACES; 
</P>
<P>
CHALLENGERS WIN SEATS ON WATER BOARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON and IRENE CHANG, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<P>
Although voters statewide rejected major environmental measures, a slate of 
five Sierra Club-backed candidates swept to victory Tuesday in the San Gabriel 
Valley, winning seats in three water districts where severe ground-water 
pollution fired a lively campaign debate. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, voters in four western San Gabriel Valley cities elected the first 
Asian to the board of the Alhambra City and High School Districts, which serve 
an area increasingly populated with new immigrants from Asia. Monterey Park 
businesswoman Sophie C. Wong, 53, attributed her victory partly to the use of 
absentee ballots written in Chinese and English and sent to targeted Asian 
households. 
</P>
<P>
And voters in two of the San Gabriel Valley's safest cities, San Marino and La 
Verne, overwhelmingly approved an increase in local taxes to help pay for 
police, fire and paramedic services. 
</P>
<P>
The victory of environmental candidates in water district races, where 16 
candidates sought six seats, irritated some ousted incumbents and members of 
the San Gabriel Valley water establishment. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sierra Club put on a good campaign," said Robert H. Nicholson Jr., 57, a 
water company executive who was defeated in his reelection bid to the board of 
the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District. "But I'm not sure their 
interests are in line with the people of the San Gabriel Valley." 
</P>
<P>
But Cal State Fullerton faculty member and El Monte resident Anthony R. Fellow, 
who beat Nicholson by winning 53.9% of the vote, said he and other 
environmentalists now can make significant changes in speeding the region's 
cleanup efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"People know the water quality in this district is not good . . . and that's 
why Nicholson was defeated," said Fellow, 40. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Azusa's Carol A. Montano said her victory over Donald F. Clark, a 
pillar of the water establishment since the early 1960s, signaled the public's 
desire for more decisive action on water pollution, which has worried residents 
since cancer-causing chemicals were discovered in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Montano, 43, citing a voter mandate throughout the San Gabriel Valley, said: 
"Water quality is the real important issue, and it can't be ignored." She 
blamed local water officials for failing to cope adequately with the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Montano will replace Clark, 66, on the five-member San Gabriel Valley Municipal 
Water District, which serves Azusa, Sierra Madre, Alhambra and Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
Also backed by environmentalists, El Monte attorney Marvin Joe Cichy, 50, 
defeated Baldwin Park incumbent Alfred R. Wittig, 67, and three others for a 
seat on the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District, thus giving 
environmentalists control of that five-member board. 
</P>
<P>
Wittig, a 10-year board member who was kept from campaigning due to an extended 
hospital stay that recently ended, said: "I wish I had used the word 
environmentalist to describe me in the campaign. I actually was the 
environmentalist on that board." 
</P>
<P>
In the Three Valleys Municipal Water District, environmentalists backed two 
incumbents, Muriel F. O'Brien, 68, of Claremont and Paul E. Stiglich, 38, of 
Diamond Bar, who won easy victories. Three Valleys Board Chairman William H. 
Koch, 71, defeated Nolie E. Glover, 64, in a landslide race in which 
environmentalists had taken no position. 
</P>
<P>
The environmentalists' victories are just the beginning, according to Wil Baca, 
a Hacienda Heights environmental activist involved in the campaigns, which 
stretched from El Monte to Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
"From now on, every water board seat in the San Gabriel Valley is going to be 
contested," he said. "We have turned the water board seats into something 
meaningful for the public." 
</P>
<P>
In other local races, Dora Padilla, 56, led the field of five candidates 
seeking two seats in the Alhambra City and High School Districts. Padilla 
received 15,874 votes, or 35.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Wong will also join the five-member board. 
</P>
<P>
Wong will replace Charles C. Scanlon, who did not run for reelection. Wong 
received 10,564 votes, or 23.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing her were Jeff Schwartz, with 7,949, or 17.8%; Ronald Hirosawa, 7,623, 
or 17.1%, and Charles C. Ling, 2,669, or 6%. 
</P>
<P>
There are 20,000 students in the districts, which cover 13 elementary schools, 
three high schools and one continuation school. The districts cover all of 
Alhambra, and parts of Monterey Park, Rosemead, and San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
Wong said she received support from Asian voters, especially after her campaign 
mailed 7,200 absentee ballots written in Chinese and English to Asian 
households. Forty-seven percent of the districts' students are of Asian 
descent. 
</P>
<P>
For the second time in four years, Alhambra Councilman Michael A. Blanco easily 
beat Sonia McIntosh, a homemaker, in a low-key race for the 5th District post 
that serves the western part of the city. Blanco, a 41-year-old attorney, 
received 7,219 votes, or 64.7%, and McIntosh, 3,935, or 35.3% 
</P>
<P>
Worried by attacks on San Marino's Proposition P, supporters of the tax measure 
there expressed pleasure that voters easily gave the necessary 
two-thirds-majority vote. It passed with 3,372 votes, or 74.8%, in support and 
1,136, or 25.2%, against. 
</P>
<P>
The tax will raise up to $1.5 million a year for police, fire and paramedic 
services and will increase property owners' bills from $266 to $722 annually. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Le Sage, co-chairman of the San Marino Citizens for Public Safety 
Committee, said it is impressive "that any city could get 75% of their voters 
to agree on any issue, including a (tax)." 
</P>
<P>
Despite current economic conditions, he said, "San Marino residents want a safe 
neighborhood . . . and recognized that it'll cost money." 
</P>
<P>
But Proposition P opponent Ben Austin, founder of the San Marino Fiscally 
Conservative Assn., said the tax will hurt many older residents on fixed 
incomes. "Everybody thinks San Marino is rich . . . but there are widows on 
pensions, and older people living on Social Security, and this is an expensive 
place to live." 
</P>
<P>
With no organized opposition to La Verne's Proposition H, voters easily 
approved the measure, which is similar to San Marino's. It will result in 
raising $1.2 million in local taxes a year. The vote was 5,234, or 57.2%, in 
favor and 3,918, or 42.8%, against. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was only advisory, but City Council members have indicated they would 
follow the electorate's wishes. The measure could increase homeowners' taxes a 
maximum of $96 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pro Tem Tom Harvey interpreted the results this way: "It was tapping into 
what was a real concern -- that we keep a very low crime rate."

RESIDENTS' PLAN TO SCALE BACK HILLSIDE TRACT MAY BACKFIRE; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: OFFICIALS CONSIDER AN ALTERNATIVE SUGGESTED BY A GROUP THAT REALLY 
DOESN'T WANT THE PROJECT BUILT AT ALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale homeowners who have spent months using angry rhetoric to fight a 
hillside subdivision tried a new tactic last week -- they redesigned the 
project themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The Glenoaks Canyon Homeowners Assn. got help from building experts who live in 
the neighborhood in seeking to discredit developer Ken Doty, who wants to cut 
scenic ridgelines and destroy oak trees to build 25 houses off Sleepy Hollow 
Place. 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners said their detailed maps and computer printouts proved that Doty 
was wrong when he said it was impossible to create a smaller project, which 
would cause less environmental damage. 
</P>
<P>
But the strategy may have backfired. Although the association is on record as 
opposing any development on the Sleepy Hollow site, the City Council has seized 
upon the association's 12-house plan as a possible compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Weaver, association president, said his group put together the 12-house 
plan only to show that the environmental impact study and Doty were incorrect 
in saying that only a 25-house subdivision is viable. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a calculated gamble," Weaver said. "All we were trying to do was prove 
that other alternatives could be found. We were not trying to say that this was 
the alternative we want built. If we had presented none and simply said that it 
could be done, it would have been a gamble as to whether the City Council would 
have believed it." 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing last Thursday, the council delayed a vote on Doty's design while 
city planners evaluate the homeowners' more modest building proposal. The 
project will be reviewed again Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to have to take a second look at the 25 homes," Mayor Larry Zarian 
said after Thursday's meeting. "The people that put this thing together are 
very well-respected. It sheds a different light" on the proposed subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have been prepared to take a vote" on Doty's original proposal, 
Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg said. "But the homeowners themselves were the ones 
who presented the alternative. I think they probably introduced it as an 
example of what could have been done. But by introducing it, it became part of 
the evidence." 
</P>
<P>
The environmental report on Doty's project said a smaller, 14-lot subdivision 
could be built. But it would require trucking almost 75,000 cubic yards of dirt 
through the neighborhood and into the canyon -- a proposal that residents have 
strongly opposed. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Kemp, a lifelong Glenoaks Canyon resident whose architectural firm has 
designed more than 300 school buildings, said he modified the plan presented in 
the EIR. By tucking 12 houses deeper into the canyon, no earth would need to be 
brought in and no ridgelines would be cut, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Association leaders introduced Kemp to another canyon resident, developer Larry 
Russell, who was able to run computer programs that fine-tuned Kemp's plan and 
proved that the smaller development would not require trucking in fill dirt. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp acknowledged that houses built deeper in the canyon would have less 
impressive views and might sell for less money. Yet the architect claimed that 
Doty "should be able to make a handsome profit, even with 12 homes." 
</P>
<P>
But many of the 170 residents who attended last week's hearing said they 
believe even one house would disrupt the scenic hillside area where deer and 
other wildlife are often spotted. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see no development," said Richard B. Lewis, an amateur biologist 
who showed the council slides of the trees and wildflowers that flourish in the 
canyon. "It's an outstanding wilderness area that is used extensively by local 
residents." 
</P>
<P>
Doty said Monday that he had not seen the association's plan and declined to 
comment on it. "There's no way to know what we're going to do until we see it," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
He speculated, however, that his subdivision might not work financially if he 
is allowed to build only 12 houses. 
</P>
<P>
Several council members said they want fewer houses and less ridgeline damage 
than Doty originally proposed. But Councilman Jerold Milner said he thinks it 
is unrealistic to expect the council to block development of the site. 
</P>
<P>
Milner said prohibiting development would undoubtedly trigger a lawsuit. In 
such cases, he said, the courts usually rule that a government body cannot take 
away legitimate property development rights. 
</P>
<P>
Although the council plans to consider the homeowners' proposed alternative, 
association leaders said they do not intend to help Doty or the city evaluate 
or modify the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"The homeowners who continue to want no development would accuse us of selling 
out if we sit down and work out a plan with them," Weaver said. "The burden of 
proof is now on somebody else."

BEST BETS: CHILLS AND THRILLS FOR SKI BUFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Skiers, anticipating your first opportunity to swoosh down snowy slopes this 
winter? Between watching endlessly blue skies and waiting for enough of the 
white stuff to blanket ski runs at your favorite resort, you may want to check 
out renowned ski bum-filmmaker Warren Miller's latest film. 
</P>
<P>
Written and narrated by Miller, "Extreme Winter" -- his 41st feature film -- 
journeys through some of the most challenging, untamed slopes in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen cameramen traveled more than 584,000 miles to 24 locations on four 
continents, offering viewers the chance to glide down untracked powder, thrash 
through moguls, fly over giant cornices of snow and witness aerial-freestyle 
and aerobatic competitions. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County enthusiasts will have two opportunities to catch Miller's ski 
follies. The Westlake Village Theater, at Lakeview Canyon and Agoura roads in 
Westlake Village, will show the film at 7 and 9 p.m. Wednesday. The Ventura 
Theater, 26 S. Chestnut St., Ventura, will have showings at 7 and 9 p.m. Nov. 
16. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are $7 for both venues.

AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: THE RESERVOIR LOOKS CURIOUSLY LIKE AN ACRE OR SO OF 
SUBTERRANEAN GREENHOUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a simple announcement, put out so quietly by the Department of Water and 
Power last week that it nearly obscured one small triumph of diplomacy in the 
agency's greatly maligned program to upgrade its reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
The notice said that the Highland Reservoir, one of the oldest in the city, is 
about to be drained and replaced with a steel tank. 
</P>
<P>
There was reason for the department to downplay the news. Almost every 
neighborhood which has a reservoir is mobilized these days to prevent the DWP 
from either covering or tanking it. 
</P>
<P>
Reservoirs were originally made to store water for distribution to the city. 
But several of them offered such splendid views they came to be regarded as 
essential to the character of neighborhoods around them, most of which also 
happened to be quite wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
Silver Lake in particular, taking its name from the man-made gem in its midst, 
faced a kind of extinction if the DWP proceeded with a plan to cover part of 
the blue surface with gray, synthetic rubber. 
</P>
<P>
Collectively, homeowners from Silver Lake to Pacific Palisades have put the DWP 
through a public lashing that seems to have drawn the mammoth agency to a 
stalemate. Its reservoir program has largely been on hold for re-evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, just a hop over the hills from Silver Lake, a scrappy little 
community group called the Highland Park Heritage Trust took on the DWP all by 
itself in a more traditional game of hardball politics. It produced what both 
sides agree is an acceptable, if rather odd, compromise. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP will tear out the existing 20-million-gallon reservoir and replace it 
with a 3-million-gallon tank. It will retain a 1907 Mission Revival pump house 
in its original condition. The keystone of the deal is that the agency will 
cover the new tank with a simulated old wooden roof. 
</P>
<P>
To appreciate why that is a deal, you must know that Highland Park, though now 
bursting with immigrant people, still retains the fierce loyalty of old-stock 
residents whose hobby it is to trace every building back to the original tract 
map. 
</P>
<P>
They well remember, for example, that the north end was once the township of 
Garvanza, whose name is kept alive today only by Garvanza Elementary School and 
Garvanza Hardware. 
</P>
<P>
The town was founded in 1886 by developer Ralph Rogers and annexed into Los 
Angeles in 1899. Its water came from what was then the Garvanza reservoir, 
purchased by the city in 1902. A tract map of that year shows it had a wooden 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
The city expanded the reservoir in 1909, building a field of interconnected 
slat gables to cover the water. It is still there today, warped and splintered 
by time. 
</P>
<P>
From the street, the reservoir looks curiously like an acre or so of 
subterranean greenhouses. Tucked away behind Luther Burbank Junior High School, 
it attracts little notice. 
</P>
<P>
But it has been carefully monitored over the years by DWP engineers and by 
Charlie Fisher of the Highland Park Heritage Trust. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP became alarmed recently by numerous breaches in the roof, which allowed 
sunlight to strike the water. Fisher, in turn, became alarmed that a link to 
the original Garvanza would be lost. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher, who owns an old house in the center of Highland Park, is an expert at 
digging up historical portfolios. He and his associates in the trust have 
presented dozens of homes to the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission for 
historic cultural monument status. 
</P>
<P>
Fearful of losing one of the last relics of Garvanza, Fisher struck 
preemptively, nominating the reservoir as a monument. Los Angeles Councilman 
Michael Woo borrowed this technique several months later in nominating Silver 
Lake as a monument. 
</P>
<P>
A few days before Fisher's nomination was to be heard, the DWP sent someone to 
negotiate with him. They met at the Eagle Rock Municipal Building in January, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
"They said the roof is deteriorated," Fisher said. "My comment was, 'Replace 
it.' " 
</P>
<P>
The DWP isn't used to such ultimatums. But it had a good comeback. The dam 
itself is seismically inadequate and could fail in an earthquake, it said. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided that was something we didn't want to deal with," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
He proposed nominating the reservoir as a historic site, rather than a 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
That subtle distinction would allow the DWP to retire the lake. All Fisher 
asked in return was a new wooden roof to conceal the tank. 
</P>
<P>
Since the tank will stow away in one corner of the lake bed, the new roof 
should actually more closely resemble the original, smaller reservoir of the 
days of Garvanza, not an unhappy circumstance for a group that prefers things 
as they were. 
</P>
<P>
"That was our goal, to get the tank taken out of view and leave something 
looking like the roof," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
In its announcement last week, the agency mentioned nothing about a roof. It 
merely said the unused portion of the existing lake would be landscaped. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher said he still hasn't seen any plans for the new roof. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, I'm taking their word for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He isn't especially worried. Because the reservoir site is a historic cultural 
monument, the tank plans will have to be approved by the Cultural Heritage 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
And that's his arena.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 SUFFER KNIFE WOUNDS; 2 HURT IN SHOOTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Street violence injured three people last weekend and a fourth person late 
Tuesday in northeast Los Angeles, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Alonzo Dominguez, 21, of Atwater Village received a small puncture wound in the 
stomach late Friday after he turned away a drug dealer who was trying to sell 
him drugs, Los Angeles Police Detective Ron Whitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez told police that he was talking to friends in the parking lot of the 
apartment building where he lives in the 3400 block of Drew Street when the 
incident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
In another incident Friday night, Jose Mendoza, a 14-year-old gang member from 
Highland Park, was grazed by a bullet while he rode in a car headed south on 
Avenue 52 between the Pasadena Freeway and Figueroa Street. 
</P>
<P>
The youth said he heard two shots from behind the car. One hit the rear 
windshield and the other hit him in the back of the head. 
</P>
<P>
Early Saturday, Nelson Magana, 29, of Silver Lake was beaten and stabbed by two 
men after he stopped his car in the 1300 block of Lake Shore Terrace to check 
the tires. 
</P>
<P>
Magana was bending down to see if he had a flat when two men approached him 
from behind. They struck him twice on the head and, as Magana got into his car, 
stabbed him in the left side. 
</P>
<P>
Late Tuesday night, a fourth person was wounded in a drive-by shooting, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Suspected gang member Keokhonsavahn Rattanachahn, 17, of Echo Park was at a 
family gathering when a car drove up to the front of the house and fired one 
shotgun blast through a window.

2 ASSEMBLY INCUMBENTS COAST TO WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The power of the incumbency showed no sign of weakening Tuesday in the 
Democratic strongholds of northeast Los Angeles as Assemblymen Richard Polanco 
and Mike Roos swept to victory. 
</P>
<P>
Polanco, unopposed by a Republican in the 55th District, won a third term with 
79% of the vote, enlarging his 1988 tally by 4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
The district stretches from Pasadena to Atwater Village. 
</P>
<P>
In the 46th District, which includes Silver Lake, Los Feliz, Echo Park and the 
mid-Wilshire area, Roos easily weathered an unorthodox challenge by opponents 
of his 1989 legislation banning assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
A group calling itself Californians Against Corruption had flooded the district 
with a chain-letter-style mailer criticizing Roos' extensive campaign 
contributions from special interest groups and reminding voters of his past 
ties to fireworks magnate W. Patrick Moriarty, who was convicted of corruption 
in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Though Republican challenger Geoffry Church raised the corruption issue in a 
debate with Roos last week, the attack had no visible effect on the voters. 
They returned the Assembly Speaker Pro Tem to a seventh full term with 68% of 
the vote, an increase of 2 percentage points over his 1988 showing.

JAIL PROPOSAL APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prisoners sentenced to county jail may soon be able to pay Pasadena $75 a day 
to serve their time in the city's new $3-million jail under a proposal approved 
Tuesday by the Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal allows for lower payments for those who can't afford $75 a day. 
</P>
<P>
But directors were reluctant to approve a similar proposal that would enable 
the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service to house convicted illegal 
aliens in the city jail. Directors felt that objections might be raised to city 
participation in INS activities, and the matter was referred to a 
police-resident advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
The two programs would bring the city an estimated $85,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal approved by the board, individuals convicted of misdemeanors 
and who are nonviolent offenders without medical problems can spend their 
sentence in Pasadena for periods ranging from 48 hours to several months. Up to 
seven beds in the 70-bed jail would be allocated for these prisoners.

All commercial and industrial projects larger than 25,000 square feet will have

Although the city has had a public art requirement since 1988, it applied only

EVEN ON SUNDAY, POST OFFICE DELIVERS FOR THE POLITICIANS

<P>
Hindrances such as snow, rain and gloom of night are not supposed to stay the 
intrepid couriers of the U.S. Postal Service from the swift completion of their 
appointed rounds, or so the saying goes. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, a blizzard of a different kind -- political junk mail -- 
forced them on Sunday to make some unappointed rounds too. 
</P>
<P>
Postal officials said they were so inundated with political mailers -- some 
voters reported receiving more than two dozen in a single day -- that they had 
to make the Sunday deliveries to reduce the backlog. 
</P>
<P>
A heart transplant patient who insisted on voting Tuesday died unexpectedly, 
shortly after casting his ballot from his hospital bed. 
</P>
<P>
J. D. Livingston, 65, of the Sun Valley section of Los Angeles was a steadfast 
Republican who told workers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center that he had never 
willingly missed an election. 
</P>
<P>
Recovering from his third episode of rejection of his second transplanted 
heart, Livingston cast his absentee ballot about noon. He went into cardiac 
arrest a half-hour later, and was pronounced dead at about 2 p.m., according to 
hospital spokeswoman Peggy Frank Shaff. 
</P>
<P>
"He was an incredibly patriotic man," said Shaff. "This was very important to 
him. It is just unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Livingston, a retired real estate developer and dairyman, was one of about 100 
hospitalized people at Cedars-Sinai to request absentee ballots from employees 
at the Westside hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica City Atty. Robert M. Myers is not known for his sense of whimsy, 
but the oh-so-serious lawyer demonstrated that he is not all business by naming 
his family band after a slur made against him by supporters of Proposition Y, 
the ballot measure that proposed making the city attorney's post an elected 
one. 
</P>
<P>
The group called itself the "Habitual Criminals," which is what opponent Leslie 
Dutton called Myers because of his arrests during anti-nuclear power plant 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
The band, in which Myers plays lead guitar and his wife and 11-year-old twins 
handle the vocals, performed at campaign fund-raisers, singing appropriately 
original songs about political life in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Among them was a ditty called "Love Me, I'm a Santa Monica Liberal," sung to a 
tune by '60s folkie Phil Ochs.

EVICTIONS PREDICTED AS LANDLORDS FAIL IN BID TO EASE RENT CONTROL; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MONICA: LANDLORD-BACKED PROP. U IS DEFEATED. TENANTS RIGHTS ADVOCATES' 
RIVAL MEASURE, PROP. W, WILL BE DECIDED BY ABSENTEE BALLOTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, Santa Monica landlords came up empty at the polls in their quest 
for relief from the city's tough rent-control law, and they warned of a 
probable surge of evictions by property owners who decide to quit the rental 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Landlords also failed to break a consecutive winning streak by tenants rights 
advocates in the race for four seats on the city Rent Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
Voters on Tuesday decisively rejected a landlord-sponsored ballot measure, 
Proposition U, that would have lifted rent controls from apartments that are 
voluntarily vacated. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the fate of a competing measure backed by tenants was still 
undecided Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The tenants' measure, Proposition W, was ahead by less than 100 votes with 
results from all precincts tabulated. But the final outcome will not be known 
until sometime next week, after an estimated 4,000 to 4,500 absentee ballots 
are counted. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition W proposed allowing rents of voluntarily vacated apartments to 
increase to specific "threshold levels." These levels would allow for 
significant rent increases for some apartments, but the threshold levels the 
measure called for would still be well below the free-market rates sought by 
the city's landlords. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city's powerful tenant organization, Santa Monicans for Renters' 
Rights, maintained its tight grip on the Rent Control Board, there were 
predictions that the new panel would consider giving landlords some economic 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
If Proposition W loses after absentee ballots are counted, rent board 
commissioner Jay Johnson, who won reelection Tuesday, said he wants to 
determine how tenants -- as compared to homeowners -- voted for Proposition W 
before deciding what measures the board should take. 
</P>
<P>
The board has the authority to implement the provisions of Proposition W, but 
Johnson said he would not want to enact measures "that fly in the face of the 
will" of tenants. 
</P>
<P>
However, Johnson said he expects the new board to have a better relationship 
with landlords than the outgoing board, whose members often fought among 
themselves as well as with landlords. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said that the issue of landlords who are stuck with very low rents is 
likely to be addressed quickly. Under the city's rent control law, rents are 
based on 1978 levels, and annual rent increases have ranged from 3% to 6% over 
the last decade. As a result, some landlords collect as little as $400 for 
two-bedroom apartments. Comparable apartments in nearby parts of Los Angeles 
rent for twice that. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants rights advocates have been prodded to make changes because landlords 
have recently been fighting back by taking advantage of a 1986 state law, the 
Ellis Act. It allows landlords to evict tenants and go out of business, 
provided they give adequate notice and pay relocation fees. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of more than 1,100 units have filed notice with the city of their intent 
to go out of business, although not all of them have followed through on their 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Lambert, an attorney and landlord, predicted that as a result of Tuesday's 
election, many landlords will now go forward with their evictions, and that 
other landlords will also begin the eviction process rather than continue to 
accept low rents. 
</P>
<P>
"More evictions under the Ellis Act are going to occur," Lambert warned. "The 
tenants are the victims." 
</P>
<P>
The streak of electing only SMRR-backed candidates to the Rent Control Board 
continued. In addition to Johnson, voters elected tenant attorney Lisa Monk 
Borrino and child development specialist Suzanne Abrescia to four-year terms. 
Teacher Robert Niemann, who was also endorsed by SMRR, was elected to a 
two-year term. 
</P>
<P>
Three other housing-related issues were on the Santa Monica ballot, all of 
which passed: 
</P>
<P>
* Proposition R, which will require that 30% of all new multifamily housing on 
an annual basis be set aside for low- and moderate-income people. 
</P>
<P>
* Proposition V, which essentially places the city's existing condominium 
conversion law into the City Charter. 
</P>
<P>
* Proposition X, which exempts state-owned property from the city rent control 
law. The measure won by less than 1%, which baffled many election observers. It 
was directed at resolving a question of whether cabanas at the former private 
Sand and Sea Club fell under rent control.

SIGN ORDINANCE SOFTENED

<P>
The City Council on Tuesday softened its English-language sign ordinance, 
angering some residents in the audience, who complained not only of Chinese 
language signs, but also of an Asian "invasion" in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The council's action comes in response to a report from City Manager Denise 
Ovrom, who wrote that the law had to be changed because of a U.S. District 
Court decision against Pomona. Both cities had similar ordinances requiring 
that 50% of a sign be devoted to Roman letters and/or Arabic numerals. 
</P>
<P>
The new Temple City ordinance requires only that businesses be identified in 
English with letters at least nine inches high in colors compatible with the 
background.

The Cabrillo Music Theater will present its version of the rollicking musical 
comedy "Hello, Dolly!" for a three-day run at the Oxnard Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Producer Betty Sullivan says that audiences won't be sitting still during the 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very musical production with lots of singing and dancing and 
spectacular choreography. People will really be excited. It's a fun, upbeat 
play with not much dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan and director Dianne Leigh have recruited local performer Linda Hall to 
fill the Dolly bill. 
</P>
<P>
"Linda lives in Thousand Oaks and is a veteran to the stage, a really wonderful 
performer," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides "Dolly," the production includes a cast of eight, plus 40 singers and 
dancers, full orchestral accompaniment and the Newbury Park High School 
Marching Band. 
</P>
<P>
Performance times are 8 p.m. Friday and Saturday and 3 p.m Sunday. Tickets are 
$10, $12.50 and $15. Senior citizen and student discounts are available, as 
well as group rates.

SOUTH PASADENA: THE NEW INTERIM CHIEF WANTS A WRITTEN POLICY AND ASKS FOR CALM 
IN THE WAKE OF A SEPTEMBER INCIDENT THAT IS STILL BEING INVESTIGATED. 
</P>

SOUTH PASADENA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As an investigation continues into police handling of a noisy drinking bash 
last September, the city's new interim police chief is developing guidelines on 
"how to shut down a party." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Price, a retired Bakersfield police chief who will serve in South 
Pasadena until a permanent chief is selected, said this week that he hopes a 
more definitive policy will alleviate some of the bad feelings -- among 
officers and party-goers -- that recent gatherings have sparked. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no standard procedure on how to shut down a party . . . or even what 
is a party," said Price, 58, who took over the chief's post Oct. 22. "The 
officers just sort of go on their own." 
</P>
<P>
Price said the new policy will probably include a section on the use of video 
cameras to document the conduct of police and party-goers. The camera, he said, 
"doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody's picture and what everybody says." 
</P>
<P>
The attorney for the South Pasadena Police Officers Assn., angry that a private 
investigator was hired by the City Council to look into allegations of police 
misconduct at the Sept. 14 party, said the guidelines are long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
"The officers feel that since there's no written policy, anything they do could 
be considered wrong," attorney Sylvia E. Kellison said. "We've been requesting 
those directions for over two years." 
</P>
<P>
The investigation, which is being conducted by a former Pomona police 
lieutenant, is expected to be completed within a month, officials said. It was 
ordered by the City Council after two people complained that police used 
excessive force in breaking up the Stratford Avenue party. 
</P>
<P>
One of them was John Bernardi Jr., the 22-year-old son of the city manager, who 
was arrested that night for disturbing the peace and resisting an officer. Also 
arrested were Bryan Lee Prentiss, 22, son of a former mayor; Thomas D. Ramos, 
20, son of a former Chamber of Commerce president, and Scott D. Josephson, 21. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors threw out the case last month when they decided that there was 
insufficient evidence to charge the four suspects with disturbing the peace. 
Prentiss, though, was charged with one count of destroying public property for 
allegedly kicking a jail telephone off the wall and stomping it to pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Price, who will probably remain as police chief for at least three months, took 
over when William Reese retired from the department last month after 29 years, 
the last 5 1/2 as chief. 
</P>
<P>
Price, who is earning $5,276 a month, said he views his role as that of a 
caretaker. He said he hopes to calm the city until a new chief is named. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a problem in that there are some bad feelings between some members of 
the community and the police," Price said. "I don't want to assess blame. But I 
want to find out what's causing the problem and alleviate some of those 
feelings."

For the seventh installment in our series of theater reviews, we visited the 
Mann Buenaventura at 1440 Eastman Ave. in Ventura. We went there on Halloween, 
so we are pretty sure the cobwebs and spiders were decorative. 
</P>
<P>
Food: An interesting combination of items for the health-conscious (bags of 
dried apricots, cashews and yogurt-covered raisins) and the 
not-so-health-conscious (free M&amp;Ms when purchasing a large coke and 
popcorn). 
</P>
<P>
After the first bite, which was typically salty, the hot dog was quite edible. 
In fact, it could even be called tasty. The popcorn, however, was less of a 
surprise, once again drowning in bogus butter. 
</P>
<P>
Restroom: Another surprise. It was clean. All the urinals flushed (really, we 
tried all of them). The colors were, as usual, ugly -- but if you run into the 
restroom straight from the theater, before your eyes adjust, it's hard to see 
anything anyway. Best feature: Towel dispensers are low enough so that water 
doesn't drip down your sleeve while you are reaching for the paper. 
</P>
<P>
Pre-movie entertainment: Again, the trivia slide show, but this time without 
any background music. Silence, except for the clicking of the slide projector. 
</P>
<P>
Pre-movie ads: One. 
</P>
<P>
Previews: One. 
</P>
<P>
Special feature: Garbage cans in each theater. Garbage is still discarded on 
the floor, but that isn't the fault of management. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the Ojai Film Society will show the 1990 film "Longtime Companion," 
which follows the lives of 11 homosexual men and how those lives change when 
they are affected directly or indirectly by AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The story begins in 1981, when the first information about the AIDS virus came 
out. The movie was acclaimed for its frankness on a controversial subject 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
"Longtime Companion" will be shown at 4:30 p.m. at the Ojai Playhouse, 145 E.

OPENING CEREMONY FOR STUDENT CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica College will celebrate the official opening of its new student 
center Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
The 12,000-square-foot facility, called the Cayton Associated Students Center, 
houses student government and other offices, a computer laboratory, a lounge, 
and a reading room. 
</P>
<P>
The center, which has been in use since the beginning of the school year, is 
named for James and Lucille Cayton of Pacific Palisades, who donated $100,000 
to the $1.5-million project. The college's Associated Students gave $675,000, 
plus $175,000 for furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
The opening, which includes a ceremony honoring the Caytons, will begin at 11 
a.m. with a processional from the clock tower on campus to the new center, 
which is in the Student Activities Building, at 1900 Pico Blvd.

NIGHT LIFE: WARREN ZEVON: TOUR DE FARCE; 
</P>
<P>
THE GOOD HUMOR MAN OF ROCK, WITH A NEW BATCH OF BACKUP MUSICIANS, IS COMING TO 
VENTURA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
He has 10 albums. He's funny and witty. He rocks. He sings as if he swallowed a 
badger and a Toro lawn mower. Famous rock stars play on his albums. He had a 
hit song about a werewolf. He's coming to the Ventura Theatre Saturday night. 
Hey, it must be Warren Zevon. 
</P>
<P>
The tour is billed as the Warren Zevon Acoustic Trio, or, according to Zevon, 
the Patrician Home Boys. Dan Dugmore, who plays with Linda Ronstadt and James 
Taylor, is the guitarist and Gurf Morlix from the Michael Penn Band is the 
final third. Either he has no friends or simply likes variety because Zevon's 
backup musicians always change. "It's always been that way," Zevon said in a 
recent telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of albums ago, on "Sentimental Hygiene," Zevon's supporting cast 
included Bob Dylan, Don Henley, Neil Young, Jennifer Warnes, George Clinton, 
Brian Setzer and three members of R.E.M. The latest album is an unrehearsed, 
let-the-tape-roll effort titled "Hindu Love Gods." This one features covers of 
classic blues rockers such as Willie Dixon's "Wang Dang Doodle." There are also 
covers of tunes by Prince, Woody Gutherie and Robert Johnson. The album 
features the same three members of R.E.M. -- Bill Berry, Peter Buck, Mike Mills 
-- and no Michael Stipe. Maybe he's on loan to Wilson Phillips, who knows? 
</P>
<P>
"I've known those guys for years," Zevon said. "My manager for eight years, 
Andrew Slater, met Peter Buck when they were both in school at Emory University 
in Georgia. Anyway, the 'Hindu Love Gods' thing was just this spontaneous, 
unplanned thing. And for whatever reason, it's selling surprisingly well. 
'Sentimental Hygiene' did OK, while the next one, 'Transverse City,' was on the 
other side of OK. As a trio, we'll do some 'Hindu Love Gods' stuff, but mostly 
my songs." 
</P>
<P>
So what do they have planned for the local crowd? 
</P>
<P>
"There's no playlist or anything; we just do it and see what happens. For 
example, we were doing 'Ain't That Pretty at All' last night in Seattle and Joe 
Walsh came up from out of the crowd and jammed with us. Tonight, we're in San 
Francisco -- maybe we can do that song for four hours, if you know what I 
mean." 
</P>
<P>
A lifelong musician, Zevon switched from piano to guitar after high school and 
played folk rock for a while, then graduated into writing and performing 
commercials and playing as a studio musician. He toured with the Everly 
Brothers as a pianist in the early '70s, and released his first album in 1976 
with help from his buddy, Jackson Browne. Ronstadt recorded several songs off 
the album, including "Poor, Poor Pitiful Me," which was a big hit for her. 
Zevon's next album, "Excitable Boy," contained his biggest hit so far, 
"Werewolves of London." 
</P>
<P>
"I've been playing music since I was a little kid," Zevon said. "When I was in 
junior high school in San Pedro, my teacher took me to meet Igor Stravinsky, 
who became sort of the Elvis influence for me. I also liked Bob Dylan and Van 
Morrison a lot. Then I got into the folk/hootenanny scene for a while, playing 
at the local pizza parlors and like that. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the first time someone bought me a cheeseburger is when I technically 
became a professional. Later, I got to tour with the Everly Brothers. That was 
a dream job. I went all over the world with two guys who sang great every, 
single night. That was a lot more fun than the time I ended up singing country 
songs before 60,000 punks in Denmark waiting for U2." 
</P>
<P>
Zevon's witty lyrics are often buried by the ubiquitous loud guitars. Since he 
and the others will be performing as an acoustic trio this time, perhaps there 
will be more people laughing in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really nice when the audience gets the joke," Zevon said. "And they 
usually do -- sometimes before I do. I love going on the road. It gets me out 
of my apartment in Hollywood, and I'm able to write a lot of songs. At least 
that's what I tell the record company. As a trio, we'll just tour for a few 
months, then I'll start working on a new album the day I get back."

POOR EATING AND EXERCISE HABITS SPELL DECLINING STUDENT FITNESS

<P>
With the profusion of gyms, bike paths and health food stores found on the 
Westside, you might expect local students to be trim, fit and active. But 
recent fitness tests by the respected California Assessment Program show that 
our children are just the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
More than 900,000 California students took fitness tests that included sit-ups, 
pull-ups, a mile run, a sit-and-reach flexibility test and an optional body-fat 
measurement. Only 21% of seventh-graders and 26% of ninth-graders were able to 
meet four of the five requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, the results were even worse. In Los Angeles County, only 17% of 
seventh-graders and 19% of ninth-graders satisfied four of the five 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Local physical fitness teachers are not surprised by the CAP results. They 
agree that fitness and health among teen-agers are declining, and they cite two 
causes: lack of exercise and a poor diet. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell Miller, a fitness teacher at Marina del Rey Junior High School, 
contends that television is the greatest temptation away from exercise. 
"They're not getting involved in activities outside school as much as they used 
to," he said. "Now they just go home and watch TV." 
</P>
<P>
My own students seem to fit this trend toward inertia. Only three of the 19 
students on my school newspaper staff said that they exercise regularly. But 
those who did not blamed school work -- not television -- as the main obstacle 
to exercising. "I don't really have time for it because I always have so much 
homework," said Liza Potter, 15. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that students' eating habits are as harmful as their exercise habits. 
The main source of teens' dietary problems are the fast-food chain restaurants 
that surround many schools, Santa Monica High School basketball coach Debbie 
Skaggs contends. "The kids are eating too many high-cholesterol foods, 
fattening foods and fried foods," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Most public junior and senior high schools allow students to leave campus at 
lunchtime. As a result, the students often eat their largest meal of the day at 
a hamburger or fried chicken stand. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these negative influences, however, parents can still help their 
children shape up with a few simple and inexpensive steps. 
</P>
<P>
Begin by purifying your child's diet. "They need more of the basics," said 
Steve Gould, Miller's colleague at Marina del Rey Junior High. "Give them more 
carbohydrates like potatoes, bread, rice, beans and pasta." 
</P>
<P>
Skaggs agreed. She recommended a diet that included fruit and a good cereal for 
breakfast, and lean meat, such as chicken, for dinner. Above all, "stay away 
from fried foods," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Encourage your child to avoid fast-food lunches by packing a decent bag lunch. 
Surprisingly, my students said that a good homemade lunch would actually keep 
them out of burger joints. 
</P>
<P>
"I start out the day wanting to eat right," said Rob Baker, 16, "but if there's 
nothing at home to pack for lunch, I always end up eating fast food." 
</P>
<P>
Keep a bowl of fruit on or near the television since, like it or not, your 
child probably spends a lot of time there. No-mess fruit, such as apples or 
bananas, are most attractive because they're easy to grab and eat. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, it would be a losing battle to try to eliminate sweets, but 
sweets can be minimized without undue stress. Ration the junk food as though it 
were spending money. Instead of just leaving an open box of cookies in the 
cabinet, hide it in a safe place and distribute the sweets after dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Once the diet is on track, help your child vent some of that new energy by 
making an exercise program. "It just takes 30 minutes a day, three times a 
week," said Skaggs. "That's not much."

"Take an active part," suggested Gould, "and show them that you care about 
exercise too." Bike riding, bowling, jogging or just walking after dinner can 
be pleasant parent-child activities. 
</P>
<P>
Enroll your child in a sports program at a nearby park. Most city programs 
offer a variety of sports, including basketball, swimming, volleyball and 
softball. These programs are usually free or inexpensive. 
</P>
<P>
If it's financially feasible, try the YMCA, which is popular among the teens 
who do exercise. "They have weight machines to build muscles and a Stairmaster 
for cardiovascular health," noted Kim Einhorn, 17. The YMCA also offers 
swimming and gymnastics lessons, basketball and other sports. 
</P>
<P>
Pop Warner football, Little League baseball and Bobby Sox softball are old 
favorites, of course, but not all neighborhoods have these programs, and 
equipment costs can run $100 or more per season. 
</P>
<P>
Starting your child on a fresh diet and exercise program may seem drastic and 
time-consuming. But consider the alternative. "Twenty years from now," Skaggs 
predicts, "I think there's going to be a higher rate of heart disease. (These 
kids) will be obese adults who are having a lot of heart attacks, and that's 
sad because we now have the facilities and knowledge to prevent that."

Dear Diary, 
</P>
<P>
Wigs are in. At least, that's what some fashion magazines are saying. Even 
supermodels such as Paulina Porizkova and Naomi Campbell are collecting them. 
They're being touted as the new fashion accessory, like belts or different 
colored panty hose. 
</P>
<P>
If the trend has hit Ventura County, I never noticed it. So I called a few 
local wig store owners to find out. "Wigs were popular in the '60s and early 
'70s and then kind of phased out, but they're definitely back," said Debra 
Bulman, owner of Debra's Wig Fashions In Oxnard. "Just yesterday a teen-ager 
came in with hair to her shoulders. She wanted hair to her waist." 
</P>
<P>
Rosie Wedermann, owner of the Oaks Wigs store in Thousand Oaks, said she's also 
seen an increase in sales, particularly to women in their 20s and 30s who want 
a different color or style. "Just in the last few months, we've been selling a 
lot more," she said. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't want to be left out in the fashion cold, so I told Rosie I wanted to 
try a different look too. From the rows of wigs on the wall, I pointed to 
several light brown versions not unlike my own straight, shoulder-length hair. 
</P>
<P>
Rosie shook her head. "How are you going to know what it feels like to be 
someone else if you keep looking like you?" she asked. This, I thought, was a 
valid point. So I summoned my pinprick of an adventurous spirit and pointed to 
three others. 
</P>
<P>
"You might as well stand on a street corner with that one," she said as I tried 
on a long blond wig. "That one makes you look old," she said about a short 
brown wig. "That one makes you look washed out," she said about a fiery red 
one. 
</P>
<P>
Rosie pulled a shoulder-length, auburn-colored wig off a Styrofoam head and 
helped me put it on. "You'd pay $150 for a perm like that," she said. "Believe 
me, men like this one." I felt like Rosanne Rosannadanna on a bad day. But 
Rosie told me to trust her. For some reason, I did. 
</P>
<P>
With her help, I made two other selections and then left with my purchases in a 
paper bag. One -- a blond pageboy wig similar to the one Julia Roberts wore in 
the movie "Pretty Woman" -- was on my head. 
</P>
<P>
Was everyone really looking at me strangely? Would my husband like me better 
this way? Would the Santa Ana winds make me die of embarrassment? Would I ever 
get the courage to wear this to work? 
</P>
<P>
Filled with questions, I arrived at my children's day-care center. My youngest 
son flattened himself against a wall and looked at me accusingly. "You're not 
my mom," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Diary, 
</P>
<P>
Rosie was right. Yesterday I wore a light brown fall and no one noticed a 
thing. Basically, it was the same old me. So today I put on the permed auburn 
wig and wore it to work. I looked as if I just got out of bed -- after not 
brushing my hair for a year. 
</P>
<P>
All through the morning, men in the office told me how much they liked it. They 
didn't have a clue. "It makes you look wild," one said with a wink. "I think 
I'm in love," another said. 
</P>
<P>
The women were savvier. Most suspected immediately that the locks weren't my 
own. One said she didn't remember my hair being long enough to reach my 
shoulders. Another wondered where I'd had it done. Most salons, she noted, 
don't color and perm your hair the same day. 
</P>
<P>
By the middle of the afternoon, I wanted it off. It was hot. It itched. The 
novelty of being called "Wild Woman" was wearing thin. How, I wondered, did 
British barristers stand it? 
</P>
<P>
Dear Diary, 
</P>
<P>
I spent all day yesterday lying or giving evasive answers about my hair, so 
showing up for work today in the short blond "Pretty Woman" wig was actually a 
relief. The gig was definitely up. Unfortunately, most co-workers weren't 
reminded of Julia Roberts. Donna Reed was more like it. 
</P>
<P>
I asked several men how they felt about women wearing wigs. Surprisingly, none 
of them saw anything deceitful about it. If they found out that a woman they'd 
been dating had been wearing one, they said, it wouldn't matter that much. 
</P>
<P>
At home, after my wig was safely back on its Styrofoam head, I asked my husband 
how he would have felt if I'd worn a wig when we first met. He mumbled 
something husbandly about being attracted to me and not my hair. But when I 
persisted, he finally broke down and told me a story. 
</P>
<P>
In his bachelor days, he said, he met a woman with waist-length blond hair at a 
nightclub. He asked her out. When he went to her house the next evening, she 
had dark, close-cropped hair. His feelings instantly changed. 
</P>
<P>
"Because she deceived you?" I asked, anticipating his indignation. 
</P>
<P>
"No," he said, looking rather sheepish. "Because she didn't have waist-length 
blond hair." 
</P>
<P>
As I got ready for bed, I thought about how something as superficial as hair 
could change the way people perceive who you are. But then, I suppose, the 
chance to look like someone else is probably a wig's greatest appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Personally, though, I think I'll pass on this particular fad. 
</P>
<P>
Wigs may be the hot new fashion accessory, but there's nothing inherently 
dishonest about a belt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE PREMISE 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County is teeming with the fashionable and not so fashionable. There 
are trend-makers and trend-breakers. There are those with style -- personal and 
off the rack -- and those making fashion statements better left unsaid. Twice a 
month, we'll take a look at fashion in Ventura County -- trends, styles and 
ideas -- and ask you what you think. If you have a fashion problem, sighting or 
suggestion; if you know a fashion success or a fashion victim, let us know. We 
want to hear from you.

FINALLY -- ORDER IN THE COURT; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: ON TUESDAY, THE TRAFFIC AND SMALL CLAIMS DIVISIONS OF WEST L.A. 
MUNICIPAL COURT WILL LEAVE BEHIND THEIR SHABBY QUARTERS AND MOVE INTO A NEW 
BUILDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Judges in Division 97A hear their traffic cases in the back room of an old shoe 
store. A sign on the second floor says: "All Sales Final! No Refunds." 
</P>
<P>
Next door on Santa Monica Boulevard, outside a former pharmacy, defendants wait 
on the sidewalk for their moment of justice. "DO NOT Knock," warns a crudely 
lettered cardboard sign. "If you are late you will not be seen today. NO 
EXCEPTIONS!!!!" The last two words are underlined in pink nail polish for 
greater effect. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal misdemeanor cases are held in temporary trailers. 
</P>
<P>
The decrepit annexes of the West Los Angeles Municipal Court are hardly a 
showplace of American jurisprudence. 
</P>
<P>
"It's extremely crowded, ramshackle, tumble-down," said Presiding Judge Richard 
G. Berry. 
</P>
<P>
But a change is on the horizon. When the West Los Angeles traffic and small 
claims courts open for business Tuesday, it will not be at their current shabby 
locations, but in a new office building at 3000 S. Robertson Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
"These will be regular, nice courtrooms," said Robert Quist, Los Angeles 
County's deputy court administrator for branch operations. "We've been quite 
embarrassed about the facilities we've forced our customers to come into." 
</P>
<P>
The move is also expected to relieve a chronic parking shortage at the West Los 
Angeles Civic Center, where only 30 public spaces are now available. 
</P>
<P>
"When we open on Robertson, over 50% of the workload will leave the West L.A. 
courthouse, so we expect tremendous improvement," Quist said. 
</P>
<P>
At the new location, people will be able to pay traffic tickets, sign up for 
traffic school, schedule hearings and argue traffic cases before a court 
commissioner or judge pro tem. Small-claims filings and hearings will also be 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
With the growth of population on the Westside in recent years, there has been a 
steady increase in business at the West Los Angeles Municipal Courthouse, which 
handles about 120,000 traffic cases a year, along with 8,000 small-claims 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
"From the time I first came here up to now, (the workload has) at least 
doubled," said Berry, who has been there for six years. 
</P>
<P>
The courthouse, designed for four judges, houses 11 jurists in its main 
building and its temporary annexes. 
</P>
<P>
The area covered by the court includes all of the city of Los Angeles west of 
La Cienega Boulevard, south of Mulholland Boulevard and north of Los Angeles 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The temporary trailers and old shops on Santa Monica Boulevard will make way 
for a parking lot, Quist said. 
</P>
<P>
The trailers are slated for removal early next year, when 5,000 square feet of 
space will be leased for three courtrooms in a city-owned office building 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
By 1995, plans call for a new building to be built at the West Los Angeles 
site, plus another courthouse at 111th Street and Aviation Boulevard in the 
airport area, which will take on some of the workload now being handled at 
Purdue Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Crawford, an aide to County Supervisor Deane Dana, said the two new 
courthouses are expected to include eight to 10 courtrooms at the Purdue site 
and 12 to 18 courtrooms on Aviation Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"When both are finished, there should be a net decrease of caseload at Purdue," 
said Jon M. Mayeda, chief presiding judge of the Los Angeles Municipal Courts. 
</P>
<P>
While the cost of the new buildings has yet to be determined, Quist said that 
the Robertson site will cost just under $1 million for renovations and a 
five-year lease. 
</P>
<P>
"None of this is tax money," he said. "It's all fees that people pay when they 
pay traffic and parking fines and bails."

AZUSA QB HUNT IS ARMED, DANGEROUS; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGES: THE SENIOR, WHO IS A TRANSFER FROM BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY, IS 
RANKED AMONG TOP PASSERS IN THE NATIONAL ASSN. OF INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS 
DIVISION II. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Quarterback Brian Hunt of Azusa Pacific University had every reason to be 
distracted during the Cougar football team's game against UC Santa Barbara on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
After all, his wife Colleen was two days past her delivery date for the 
couple's first child. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt had even taken to wearing a beeper so his wife could alert him when she 
was about to go into labor. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt responded with the best passing performance of his college career. He 
completed 40 of 62 passes for 416 yards and shattered six school records. 
</P>
<P>
Record-setting performances have become the rule rather than an exception for 
Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago against La Verne, the 24-year-old senior set single-season school 
records for pass attempts with 364 and total offensive plays with 410. 
</P>
<P>
In the game against Santa Barbara, Hunt established single-game marks for pass 
attempts, completions and passing yards. He also surpassed single-season 
records for completions with 197, passing yards with 2,342 and total offense 
with 2,357 yards. 
</P>
<P>
He entered the week ranked No. 5 in the National Assn. of Intercollegiate 
Athletics Division II in passing yardage at 290.5 a game and No. 6 in total 
offense with an average of 294.6. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers are especially impressive when you consider that Hunt had passed 
for only 1,461 yards in his first two seasons with the Cougars. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot, 180-pound Hunt didn't benefit from the fact that Azusa Pacific's 
offense had been built around its rushing attack the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
So the quarterback admits he was more than a little surprised when Coach Jim 
Milhon informed him in fall practice that he would be passing a lot more this 
season. "I think Brian may have thought that I wasn't committed to the pass," 
Milhon said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that was a question at first but it was answered early on when we'd 
come out and throw the ball five or six times in a row and sometimes we'd throw 
on 14 or 15 straight plays," Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
Milhon and Hunt agree that offensive coordinator Doug Barnett, a former lineman 
for the Los Angeles Rams, has had a significant contribution to the offense's 
success. 
</P>
<P>
Barnett's offensive scheme has given Azusa more passing options this season. 
The Cougars have five players with 15 or more receptions and eight with 10 or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
"That's probably one of the main things about the differences between this year 
and last year," Hunt said. "We have more guys to throw the ball to. We'll send 
five guys out in the pass pattern and we've gone from throwing 15 to 20 times a 
game to throwing it 40 to 50 times a game. You can see the difference between 
this year and last year. Last year it was strictly run and this year we're 
mostly passing." 
</P>
<P>
He said the shift in emphasis to the passing game may have helped the team 
early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It may have helped us at first but now (opponents) see us on film and they 
know what to expect a little more," Hunt said. "I think we've had a few games 
where they knew we had our passing strategy and they tried to stop it. But we 
designed plays to stop specific places where we knew they would try to come at 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Milhon said the team's passing success has enabled the Cougars to keep their 
offense on the field longer and keep their defense fresh. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had defensive success but the offense has controlled the play," he said. 
"They've helped us hold the ball (79) plays a game." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the credit for that belongs to his quarterback, Milhon said. 
</P>
<P>
"He has great leadership ability," he said. "The kids really believe that when 
he throws the ball it's going to get to them." 
</P>
<P>
The coach said Hunt's leadership ability comes from the fact that he is older 
and more mature than most small college quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"Brian's played a lot of football," Milhon said. "He's 24 years old and he's 
got a lot of experience behind him. He's not a 19-year-old kid just out of high 
school. He's seen a lot out there. I'm not knocking any 19-year-old players, 
but a 24-year-old just knows a lot more about football." 
</P>
<P>
Hunt has demonstrated his maturity as a quarterback by mixing up his passes. 
</P>
<P>
"When he first came here, he wanted to throw the ball down the field a lot and 
now he's more willing to throw a short, five- to seven-yard pass or go to 
someone out of the backfield," Milhon said. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt has come a long way since he played at Glendora High, where he was more of 
a run-oriented option quarterback. But after earning All-Baseline League honors 
as a senior at Glendora, Hunt decided to attend Brigham Young University in 
hopes of developing into a passing quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
He spent his freshman season in Provo, Utah, as quarterback of the junior 
varsity team. 
</P>
<P>
"I started on the JV team and did a little traveling on the (varsity) squad 
that first year," Hunt said. "Then I went for two years on a mission for the 
(Mormon) church and redshirted a year." 
</P>
<P>
It was during his redshirt year that he decided to transfer to Azusa Pacific in 
hopes of receiving an opportunity to start. 
</P>
<P>
"After I came back, I just decided that I wanted to start playing ball again 
and I knew Coach Milhon from when I was in high school so it was an easy 
decision to transfer here," Hunt said. "We had talked when I was in high school 
and I felt comfortable coming back. I thought it was a place where I could come 
in and play right away and finish my career." 
</P>
<P>
Hunt said he had enjoyed his stay at Brigham Young. "I was comfortable at BYU," 
he said. "I guess the main problem was I didn't see much chance for me to play 
there." 
</P>
<P>
After sitting out three seasons, he said he went through a period of adjustment 
when he first started playing again as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
"Because I was out for three years, maybe the biggest adjustment was getting 
back physically and adjusting to actually playing again," Hunt said. "During my 
redshirt year I was already getting myself in a position to get back and play." 
</P>
<P>
Milhon said Hunt demonstrated promise in his first game with the Cougars as a 
sophomore against Occidental, when he led the team on a game-winning touchdown 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
"That first game against Oxy, he came in and drove the team down the field in 
the last minute and a half to win the game," Milhon said. "That has to say 
something about him." 
</P>
<P>
He said Hunt might have provided the first hint that he could be a successful 
passer in a game against Humboldt State as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
"I remembered that he threw a lot in that game and was very accurate and that 
told me he could do this," Milhon said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he showed flashes of brilliance in his first two seasons as a 
part-time starter, Hunt has saved his best for last. 
</P>
<P>
He has been enjoying a record-setting passing season and the Cougars have also 
flourished with six victories in eight games. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really excited about all the things that are happening," he said. "We're 
having a baby and we're doing well in my last year of school. It's an exciting 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Hunt might be a little happier if his team had defeated Santa Barbara. Azusa 
lost, 27-23, which might have ended its hopes of qualifying for the NAIA 
Division II playoffs for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
But Hunt has few complaints. After sporadic success in his first two seasons, 
he has finally received an opportunity to play regularly.

SPORTSCOPE: AZUSA PACIFIC FOOTBALL TEAM STILL SEEKING DIVISION II PLAYOFF BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clinging to faint hopes for a National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics 
Division II playoff berth, the Azusa Pacific University football team will play 
host to the University of San Diego in its season finale at 1:30 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars, who were ranked 20th in Division II last week before suffering a 
27-23 loss to UC Santa Barbara, are 6-2. San Diego, one of the top teams on the 
West Coast in the NCAA Division III, is also 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to tell our kids that with a win against San Diego, at 7-2, we're 
not out of the national playoff picture," Azusa Coach Jim Milhon said. "And 7-2 
is a lot better than 6-3." 
</P>
<P>
But Milhon expects a difficult game from the Toreros, who defeated Azusa, 24-6, 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
"(San Diego) beat Menlo at Menlo and did it handily (28-14 on Oct. 27)," Milhon 
said. "That's something we have not done well." 
</P>
<P>
He is also concerned about San Diego's passing game and its defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Their quarterback, Brian Murphy, is a senior and plays very well," Milhon 
said. "He really handled us last year. Their defense is active and our offense 
will face a challenge against them. We've got to shake ourselves from the Santa 
Barbara loss and come back and play well in order to win." 
</P>
<P>
Azusa quarterback Brian Hunt has established several school passing records in 
the past two weeks. Hunt, a senior and former Glendora High standout, completed 
40 of 62 passes for 416 yards -- all school single-game records -- in the loss 
to Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
He also became the school's single-season leader in completions with 197, 
passing yardage with 2,342 and total offense with 2,357. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars have also received strong play from their defense, which is ranked 
in the Division II top 10 in rushing defense and total defense. 
</P>
<P>
After finishing a disappointing 23rd at the 1990 Air Force Premier tournament 
in Colorado Springs, Colo., last week, the Cal Poly Pomona women's volleyball 
team will return to California Collegiate Athletic Assn. play when it visits 
Cal State Los Angeles at 7:30 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos (27-11 overall and 4-2 in the conference as the week began) are 
ranked 10th in NCAA Division II by the American Volleyball Coaches Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State L.A. (13-18, 1-6) has been sparked by senior outside hitter Patty 
Lomeli, who leads the conference in hitting percentage at .312. She is also 
ranked No. 5 in Division II with an average of 4.01 kills. 
</P>
<P>
Among the leaders for Pomona have been sophomore outside hitter Alicia Burns, 
senior outside hitter Jody Fee and senior middle blocker Linda Tschasar. 
</P>
<P>
The East Los Angeles College men's soccer team, ranked No. 2 among state 
community colleges with an 18-1 record, will wrap up its schedule with a game 
against visiting Mt. San Antonio at 3 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies' only loss was to Cal State San Bernardino, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
East Los Angeles has been led on offense by freshman forward Julio Umana with 
16 goals and freshman midfielder Jose Moran with 14 goals. The top defensive 
player has been freshman sweeper Jose Umana, Julio's twin brother.

"We think he's the finest sweeper in Southern California," Coach Bob Oseguera 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies, who have allowed only 11 goals, also have an outstanding 
goalkeeper in Diego Reyes. The sophomore has 10 shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
Oseguera expects his team to be one of the favorites when the state regional 
playoffs start Nov. 17. The Huskies lost to Orange Coast, 2-1, in the Southern 
California final last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we're a better team this year," he said. "Depth has been a real plus 
for us this year."

BEAUHUNKS AND GOOBS OF PRETTY PEOPLE U;

<P>
SLANG: A UCLA LINGUISTICS PROFESSOR HAD HER STUDENTS COLLECT CURRENT HIP 
PHRASES. THE RESULTING BOOK IS THE TALK OF THE CAMPUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Not too long ago, linguistics professor Pamela Munro didn't know a "beauhunk" 
from a "goob." 
</P>
<P>
Then she started assigning her students at UCLA to collect slang terms. And 
last fall, after students in her Linguistics 88A seminar had collected and 
compiled an extensive list, they decided they had the makings of a book. 
</P>
<P>
The result, a dictionary called "U.C.L.A. Slang," is a hot item in the 
bookstore at "Pretty People University" (UCLA). Now, even the most uncool 
"remos" (nerds) on campus who may "jones for" (really want) popularity can use 
the dictionary to learn what's hip. 
</P>
<P>
More than 2,300 copies have been sold locally. The dictionary has been so well 
received that Harmony Books, which is a part of Random House, has picked it up 
for publication and will release a more comprehensive version under the title 
"Slang U," expected to reach bookstores by early February. 
</P>
<P>
Although excited over the dictionary's success, Munro is taking the hoopla -- 
not to be confused with "brewhaha," which at UCLA means beer -- in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody is interested in slang," she said. "A lot of the expressions 
in the dictionary are funny." 
</P>
<P>
The dictionary is popular not just among the school's "beauhunks" (gorgeous 
men) and "bettys" (gorgeous women), "goobs" and "dweebs" (nerds of any sex), 
and "way fashionable studs." Parents are also getting in on the action. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a number of parents say they bought the dictionary so they could 
understand what their child is saying," Munro said. "Some read it and say they 
can't believe people are saying these things." 
</P>
<P>
A linguistics professor at UCLA since 1974, Munro said she was turned on to the 
richness of slang in 1981 by Connie Eble, a professor at the University of 
North Carolina at Chapel Hill who publishes papers on campus slang each year. 
</P>
<P>
The use of slang is nothing new, Munro noted. One of its functions is to help 
define distinct social groups. 
</P>
<P>
Munro said the ephemerality of slang is unpredictable. "Some slang words stay 
around and some don't," she said. "It's really hard to say which ones will 
last." 
</P>
<P>
Although some of the entries in the dictionary are common to campuses across 
the nation, Munro said many are unique to "Joe and Josephine Bruins" (UCLA 
students). 
</P>
<P>
Slang, she said, comes from a variety of sources. Some terms are adaptations of 
existings words, some are compounded or come from standard vocabulary, and 
others are words picked up from television and movie characters. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Munro cited a popular saying that is not listed in the campus 
dictionary but will be in the Harmony Books version: "Sally," a name given to a 
woman who is compulsive and meticulous. It comes from the movie "When Harry Met 
Sally," Munro said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the study of slang is only a small portion of her work, Munro said it 
has been enlightening. 
</P>
<P>
"If you study any kind of language, you learn a great respect for the human 
brain," she said. "There are clever minds that come up with these slangs, and 
you think, 'How did someone come up with this?' " 
</P>
<P>
No doubt the students at UCLA think it's "no biggie." They come up with slang 
terms "24-7" (all the time, derived from 24 hours a day, seven days a week).

AFTER BRUSH FIRE, DIAMOND BAR ACTS TO BAN UNTREATED SHAKE ROOFS

DIAMOND BAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday took the first steps toward creating an ordinance 
that would ban untreated wood shake roofs in new construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing a presentation by fire officials during a special study session, 
the council directed City Atty. Andrew Arczynski to work with the Los Angeles 
County Fire Department in drafting an ordinance banning untreated wood shake 
roofs and requiring fire-resistant roofs instead. 
</P>
<P>
The council's direction comes a month after a brush fire gutted three Diamond 
Bar homes and scorched three others. All of the homes had untreated wood shake 
roofs. 
</P>
<P>
A public hearing on the issue will probably be held Dec. 18, City Manager 
Robert Van Nort said.

WHAT'S FRESH BUYING OPPORTUNITIES: SIMPLE SCALLIONS; 
</P>
<P>
THEY ARE EASY TO GROW AND EASY TO EAT. GREEN ONIONS ARE GOOD FOR GARNISHING AND 
IN STIR-FRIED DISHES. 
</P>

<P>
No matter what month of the year it is, you can almost always count on there 
being a healthy supply of locally grown scallions. 
</P>
<P>
The green elongated, tubular cousin of the bulb onion is right at home basking 
in Ventura County's moderate year-round climate. 
</P>
<P>
Scallions don't rely on heat "like other onion varieties do for growth and 
flavor," said Bill Queen, a Somis ranch owner. And winter's extreme frost 
doesn't normally pose a danger for the green onion either. 
</P>
<P>
"During the winter, as a precaution, I just plant them at an area of my field 
that is higher elevated -- moving them to an area less susceptible to frost," 
Queen said. 
</P>
<P>
At Queen Ranch, after scallion seeds are sown it takes about 90 days before 
they reach maturity. 
</P>
<P>
"When they reach the point where they're ready to be picked, we basically just 
jerk them out of the ground, bunch them up and send them on their way," Queen 
said. "There's nothing too exciting about it." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other crops that need painstaking field preparation and one eye on the 
harvest at all times, green onions do best when you "just let 'em grow," Queen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are favorable to grow in that there's not much to worry about. The one 
thing I have to watch for is to keep the weeds under control. If they grow too 
much, the scallions are done for." 
</P>
<P>
Weed growth left unchecked can choke the green onions, Queen said. 
</P>
<P>
As for utilizing scallions in food, we turned to chef Jeffrey Axl of the Hyatt 
Westlake Plaza Hotel Restaurant for advice. 
</P>
<P>
"I use them a lot for garnishing and in Oriental dishes -- especially 
stir-frying," Axl said. 
</P>
<P>
"Lately I have been grilling them. Just brush them with olive oil along with 
some garlic and basil. Leave them on the grill for about a minute and turn over 
for another minute." 
</P>
<P>
Axl said the grilled scallions add a colorful -- and flavorful -- embellishment 
to any number of dishes. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh local scallions can be had at the Ventura Farmers' Market and numerous 
Ventura County roadside stands, including: 
</P>
<P>
Queen Ranch, 3400 Los Angeles Ave., Somis; Central Market, 505 Wood Road, 
Camarillo; Somis Farm, 3766 Somis Road, Somis; and Underwood Ranch, 5696 Los 
Angeles Ave., Somis. 
</P>
<P>
Have you been wondering what the latest word is on the would-be Camarillo 
Farmers Market? Well, here it is: 
</P>
<P>
We recently spoke with organizer Jane Rozanski and she said the tentative 
opening date will be March 2, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"We're planning on the market being open every Saturday from 8 a.m. to noon," 
she said, "and right now it looks like it will be located at the parking lot of 
the Senior Nutrition Center on Ventura Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
Rozanski, who is also executive director of the Camarillo Hospice, said the 
organizers have contacted about 75 farmers on the prospects of bringing part of 
their harvests to the market "and we're getting good response." 
</P>
<P>
Rozanski said the idea of organizing a farmers market was born from more than 
just making money. 
</P>
<P>
"We were looking for a way to raise funds to benefit Camarillo Hospice and the 
Pleasant Valley Hospital Auxiliary since we depend on contributions to run the 
organization," Rozanski said. 
</P>
<P>
With public interest running high for a farmers market outlet in Camarillo and 
given the city's proximity to an agricultural haven, "it seemed like a good 
idea," Rozanski said. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers who are interested in talking to organizers about joining the growing 
list of sellers can call Rozanski at 484-2831, Ext. 698. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
SERVING SUGGESTION: PERSIMMON STICKS 
</P>
<P>
Back on Oct. 25, we gave you a recipe for Persimmon Gnocchi and now we've come 
across another suggestion to serve up those ripening mushy persimmons that have 
been plucked from your tree: Peel them, put them on a Popsicle stick and freeze 
them. Ours came out tasting like fruity ice cream. These are definitely not 
junk food, but your kids may be fooled into eating them.

GOINGS ON SANTA BARBARA; 
</P>
<P>
SOUNDS OF SILENTS; 
</P>
<P>
AN 1,800-PIPE THEATER ORGAN, ONE OF FIVE ITS SIZE EVER BUILT, WILL BE FEATURED 
IN CONCERT.

Once used to provide music and sound effects for silent movies, the theater 
organ is now a thing of the past. 
</P>
<P>
But, as always, there are a few souls out there who want to preserve history. 
And so it is with the Santa Barbara Theatre Organ Society, which found, 
restored and installed in the Arlington Theatre one of the few remaining 
theater organs in the country. This pipe organ is one of only five of its size 
ever built. The society will present the next performance of the Pipe Organ 
Pipe Concert series Saturday at the Arlington. 
</P>
<P>
Ty Woodward of Los Angeles will perform classical and jazz as well as marches 
at the 2 p.m. concert. The performance will also feature young violinist Orin 
Hildestad. 
</P>
<P>
"That man is incredible, he plays everything on the organ except for maybe rock 
'n' roll and rap," said John Oien, founder of the society and current 
concertmaster. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1928, the organ has 1,800 pipes, which can produce a full range of 
orchestral sounds as well as those of a marimba, glockenspiel, sleigh bells, 
cymbals, tom-toms, a Chinese gong and other assorted sounds. For movie effects, 
the organ has a doorbell, train whistle and a Model T Ford horn, and can make 
the sounds of horse's hoofs, a 1928 airplane motor and surf rolling up the 
shore. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the special concerts, three local organists will take turns 
performing during the 7 p.m. intermission when the Arlington is showing movies. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for Saturday's show are $8 and $12 available at the Arlington 
(963-4408) and Baldwin Piano and Organ Center (687-6605). 
</P>
<P>
The next concert is a free "Christmas at the Arlington" show on Dec. 15 at 9:30 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
A contemporary dancer and actor as well as a choreographer and writer, John 
Goode brings "The Disaster Series," a dramatic mix of postmodern dance and 
experimental theater, to UC Santa Barbara on Wednesday. The show starts at 8 
p.m. in Campbell Hall. Tickets are $11, $13 and $15. Goode will participate in 
a question-and-answer period following the performance. Call 893-3535. 
</P>
<P>
Also at UCSB, "The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui" by Bertolt Brecht opens the 
department of dramatic art's 1990-91 season tonight. Brecht uses the imagery of 
the 1930s Hollywood gangster to illustrate the rise of German fascism. The show 
runs Thursday to Saturday and Tuesday to next Thursday Nov. at 8 p.m. at the 
Studio Theatre. Tickets are $7. Call 893-3535. 
</P>
<P>
After more than two years of touring, Access Theatre's production of "Storm 
Reading" will return Friday and Saturday to the Lobero Theater, where it 
premiered. The play depicts life from the perspective of disabled playwright 
Neil Marcus. Tickets for the show are $14.75. Call 963-0761. 
</P>
<P>
A reception for The Contemporary Arts Forum's new exhibit "Spirit of Our Time" 
will be at 5 to 7 p.m. Saturday at the Paseo Nuevo shopping center gallery. The 
exhibit was organized with the intention of showing the diversity of styles and 
tastes of Southern California. Fifteen people active in the arts, media, 
business, science and politics -- from Santa Barbara to San Diego -- were asked 
to recommend two Southern California artists each: a favorite artist and an 
artist whose work they recently discovered. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting array of painting, sculpture, photography, video and more will be 
on display until Dec. 29, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., Tuesday through Saturday. No 
charge. 966-5373. 
</P>
<P>
An afternoon of traditional Irish music, dance and poetry will be celebrated at 
the Victoria Street Theater on Saturday at 3 p.m. Tickets are $8.50, $7.50 in 
advance. Call 563-0662. MAJA RADEVICH

AUSSIE MAKING WAVES IN WATER POLO; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGES: GEOFFREY CLARK IS CONSIDERED BY SOME OBSERVERS TO BE THE TOP 
COLLEGIATE PLAYER. HE HAS HELPED PEPPERDINE TO THE NATION'S NO. 5 RANKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Geoffrey Clark, a Pepperdine University water polo standout from Australia, 
doesn't have a car and hasn't seen much of the United States. Because water 
polo and study take up most of his time, the only traveling he's done has been 
to Disneyland a couple of times and on a brief trip to the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches of opposing American college teams, however, have seen all they want of 
Clark -- although he is only in his second season with the Waves. 
</P>
<P>
Last year he led Pepperdine with 90 goals -- 23% of the team's scoring -- and 
was named an All-American by the American Water Polo Coaches Assn. as well as 
the Big West Conference Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Without Clark, the Waves stumbled to an 8-17 record in 1988. With him in 1989, 
Pepperdine tied Cal State Long Beach and UC Irvine for first place in the Big 
West, came in fourth at the NCAA championships and finished 24-8. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, a 6-foot-7, 205-pound junior from Sydney, couldn't play for Pepperdine 
in 1988 because he had other commitments. A member of the Australian national 
team since he was 16, he competed in the Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't play for the Waves in his freshman year of 1987 because he hadn't 
taken the Scholastic Aptitude Test before entering college. He said his first 
grade-point average at Pepperdine was a 1.5 (on a 4-point scale). 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine Coach Terry Schroeder said Clark's poor performance in the classroom 
was partly a result of his not being allowed to play during his freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said he has raised his GPA to 3.1. He is majoring in biology and wants to 
pursue a career in sports medicine, either as a physician or as a researcher in 
exercise physiology or biomechanics. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he came to America almost as a lark after he was recruited by 
Schroeder, the former Wave who was captain of the U.S. national team from 1983 
through 1988. Schroeder, who led the U.S. team to second-place finishes in the 
1984 and 1988 Olympics, had played against Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said he noticed that Clark, who plays the two-meter or hole position, 
"had great size and tremendous swimming speed. He could probably go to the 
Olympics for Australia in swimming. 
</P>
<P>
"He had such raw physical talent at two meters (a position similar to a center 
in basketball), and he had only been playing water polo for a few years and 
just a few months with the (Australian) national team. I thought he was an 
incredible two-meter man. This was a guy I thought could be one of the best in 
the world if he really worked at it and wanted to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Clark may have been willing to work on his water polo at Pepperdine, but said 
that he didn't work much on his studies during his first semester. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the usual view of America as 'Animal House' (the comic film about a 
hell-raising American college fraternity)," he said. But he soon learned that 
there was more to college than having fun. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, 21, was having fun with the Waves in a match with UC Santa Barbara this 
season until he broke a finger on his right hand. One of his teammates threw 
him the ball, but he lost sight of it when someone splashed the water in front 
of him. The hard pass hit him on the tip of his finger and broke it. 
</P>
<P>
It was fortunate that the ball didn't hit him on his left, or shooting, hand. 
Though in pain, he continued to play against Santa Barbara -- and scored seven 
goals in the match, six after his injury. But he missed several games after the 
injury was diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
He had fun when Pepperdine surprised top-ranked California, 12-11, although he 
missed the last three minutes of the match after he fouled out. Clark said he 
thinks that Cal "did not expect us to be any good, had no respect for our 
abilities -- so we beat them. I guess they'll have respect for us the next 
time." 
</P>
<P>
When Clark was sidelined with his broken finger, sophomore Henry Rabello of 
Brazil took over the scoring leadership. Rabello has 75 goals, but Clark is 
pushing him with 68. 
</P>
<P>
Clark's scoring prowess has caused opposing defenses to key on him. 
</P>
<P>
"Most teams drop back their defenses, which kind of prevents me from getting 
the ball," he said. "It's the water polo version of a zone defense, and 
sometimes I sit there and watch everyone else play. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't get too frustrating, unless the rest of our team is not scoring. It 
doesn't really bother me who scores, if someone else does -- and we win." 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine, ranked fifth nationally last week in the American College Water 
Polo Coaches poll, is 19-8 overall and 8-1 and in first place in the Big West 
Conference. It has won 13 of 14 matches. Last week Pepperdine swept conference 
matches from Fresno State, Pacific and UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Clark thinks the Waves have jelled and have a good chance of winning the NCAA 
championships, which will be held Nov. 23-24 in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a good, strong team, if we pretty much play to our potential as we have 
in the past," Clark said. "When some guys aren't firing we have other guys who 
step forward and take up the slack." 
</P>
<P>
Some people regard Clark as the best player in American collegiate water polo. 
Schroeder said that some "might argue that Chris Humbert of UC Berkeley is 
right there too." 
</P>
<P>
But Schroeder said that in Pepperdine's upset of Cal, Clark and Humbert guarded 
each other and that Clark dominated the matchup by outscoring Humbert, 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, however, has no use for being called No. 1. "I guess some people say I'm 
the best, but I don't know," he said. "It doesn't matter how good you are, if 
you don't have someone to throw the ball to. You need teammates." 
</P>
<P>
Clark thinks he will continue to compete in water polo for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll play probably through the 1992 Olympics, and then stop and see what I've 
got," he said. "I might keep playing after that -- I probably will. I don't 
know what I'd do with all that spare time (if he weren't playing)."

"We were tired of being excluded" from leadership positions in the Chicano 
movement, Francisca Flores recalled, explaining why the Comision Femenil 
Mexicana Nacional was formed in 1970. "Women were never nominated for executive 
offices, so we went off on our own," said Flores, the comision's founder, now 
77 and retired in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The group's first project was the Chicana Service Action Center, "an agency 
serving low-income, working Chicanas," said Magdalena Beltran, vice president 
of the group's Los Angeles chapter. With 23 chapters, the comision today 
sponsors a variety of community service projects and numerous programs to 
develop leadership among Latinas.

Frank J. Alderete was functionally illiterate when he entered East Los Angeles 
College, but he went on to earn his Ph.D. in education from USC. Alderete, 47, 
is the new president of the Los Angeles County Board of Education, an 
intermediary between county school and community college districts and the 
State Department of Education. That post and his temporary duties with the 
Workforce L.A. civic alliance goes well with his interest in ensuring that 
education meets the needs of the future labor force. "Otherwise," he said, "we 
are going to hurt our young people if we're not moving in that direction."

Raul Yzaguirre, president of National Council of La Raza, had hoped that the 
months of hearings and information-gathering by a presidential task force on 
Latino education would yield significant results, such as a national report on 
its findings. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought there would be a report" from the task force, said Yzaguirre. "That 
is a disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Yzaguirre's organization isn't going to dwell on the absence of a 
report. Instead it is focusing on what did result from the task force: an 
executive order from President Bush aimed at improving the educational 
achievement of the nation's 20 million Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
"It took over two years of very hard work to finally get something that was 
fairly compelling. We did it. We finally got it done; it is one of the most 
important events in terms of policy so far," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a number of Latino leaders expressed disappointment at the 
order's lack of specifics, including funding sources. They say that an 
important hurdle remains -- getting funds to implement the order's objectives. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's signing of the executive order came Sept. 24. The occasion was a 
Hispanic Heritage Month event at the White House Rose Garden attended by more 
than 1,300 Latino leaders, Civil Service members, politicians and community 
organizers. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's directive, known formally as the Executive Order on Educational 
Excellence for Hispanic Americans: 
</P>
<P>
* Establishes a Latino advisory commission in the Education Department to give 
advice on parental involvement in student education, the promotion of early 
childhood education, the removal of barriers to their success in education and 
work, and helping students to achieve their potential at all education levels. 
Commission members are to be appointed by the President. 
</P>
<P>
* Creates an Education Department office called the White House Initiative on 
Educational Excellence for Hispanics. (Gilbert D. Roman, an Education 
Department official, later was named to head the office.) 
</P>
<P>
* Directs "Cabinet agencies to be actively involved in helping advance 
educational opportunities" for Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven months ago, Bush directed Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos to 
form the Presidential Task Force on Hispanic Education. At the time, Bush said, 
"Sadly, Hispanic Americans are especially undereducated. As Hispanics become 
the largest minority group in the United States in the next century, it becomes 
more and more important to overcome the crisis in Hispanic education." 
</P>
<P>
Bush pointed out that among Latinos 25 and older, "an alarming 52% have not 
completed high school education, compared to 21% of non-Hispanics." 
</P>
<P>
The task force held public meetings that began last April in San Antonio to 
hear the testimony of educators and parents. Other hearings followed in Boston, 
Chicago, Miami and, last June, in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Cavazos presented an oral report of the task force's recommendations to the 
White House's Domestic Policy Council, which in turn drew up the executive 
order for the President. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the expectation of many Latino organizations, the task force was not 
required to issue a written report of its findings, said Etta Fielek, a 
spokeswoman for Cavazos. Yet Cavazos is "considering how to discuss in a more 
public way the feedback he got from citizens," Fielek said. Information 
gathered at a series of public hearings last summer may be compiled into "some 
sort of departmental report," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's executive order brought guarded optimism from other Latino leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"You need to build, and this is the cornerstone. It's a big step in the right 
direction," said Mario Moreno, director of the Washington regional office of 
the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. "We were looking for 
something with a little more teeth in it, such as money. It's pretty broad." 
</P>
<P>
Moreno said his group did not "harp on how much money" the educational programs 
would cost because "it was a concept we were trying to get accepted first." 
Still, he said, "the problem won't be solved by reshuffling existing monies." 
</P>
<P>
Leticia Quezada, the only Latino school board member of the Los Angeles Unified 
School District, said, "I'm very pleased with the advent of a presidential 
executive order . . . but I can't help but feel that I'm still waiting for 
something else. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep saying, 'Well, what did you find out, and if what you found out is that 
there's going to be another commission, that means more fact-finding.' How long 
are we going to keep researching before we get to some action? After a while, 
you wonder how many people are going to drop out and how many generations are 
going to get lost because of that waiting," Quezada said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no response yet on those hearings and what the secretary intends to do 
with the findings. There's nothing there yet that's concrete. I want to be able 
to have a program. I want to be able to have a date for some initiative," said 
Quezada, who intends to submit her name for the commission. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Goldberg, president of the Los Angeles Board of Education, lamented that 
the order lacks specific directives. The problems, she noted, are well 
documented. "If they want to come and study the issue again, they can save 
their time, their money and their energy." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Goldberg said, the fact that the order was issued at the top 
level could have a positive impact on the effectiveness of any programs that 
may result. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg and Gabriel Alvarez, a Los Angeles parent who has served on a school 
district advisory committee, said parents should not be blamed for the poor 
performance of Latino students, referring to controversial remarks Cavazos made 
last spring in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the high Latino dropout rate, Cavazos said that while Latino cultures 
traditionally have considered education important, "somewhere along the line 
we've lost that . . . we really have not cared that youngsters have dropped out 
of school." 
</P>
<P>
But Alvarez argued that parents "don't have the doors open to them at the 
schools and that needs to change because they are interested in education on 
all levels." 
</P>
<P>
The signing of the executive order culminated a two-year lobbying effort by a 
coalition of Latino organizations. They called for an executive order requiring 
federal agencies to assess the level and equity of Latino participation in 
federal education-related programs, something that Bush's order does only for 
the Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
Yzaguirre said the coalition's suggested order called on other federal 
agencies, such as Health and Human Services, for support in Head Start programs 
and in Social Security programs that have educational and medical education 
benefits. The coalition had even looked to the Department of Defense, for its 
proven expertise in the armed services in "imparting vocational training to 
people in an efficient way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other key differences between the coalition's suggested executive order and the 
one issued by Bush include "some reference to higher education and colleges 
with high levels of Hispanic enrollment," Yzaguirre said. "We had also hoped 
that the executive order would've mentioned issues of civil rights 
enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
Besides making sure that productive and sympathetic educators, business and 
community leaders are named to the commission, the Latino coalition must lobby 
for funds to implement Latino educational programs, Yzaguirre said. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Anne Perez contributed to this report from Los Angeles.

<P>
School Facts 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Education paints this picture of Latinos in nationwide 
education: 
</P>
<P>
* Among Latinos 25 and older, 52% have not completed high school, compared to 
24% of non-Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
* Between 9% and 11% of Latino students in high school drop out each year, the 
highest rate of any major racial or ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
* In 1984-85, Latinos earned only 3% of all U.S. bachelor's degrees awarded.

THE LEGACY OF MILITARY -- LESSONS FOR LATINOS 
</P>

<P>
After 53 jobs and 20 years of trying to make sense of life since his two tours 
in Vietnam, Bernardo thought it was an inappropriate question. 
</P>
<P>
"Knowing what you know now about combat," I had asked him, "would you approve 
of a son or daughter volunteering for the U.S. armed services?" 
</P>
<P>
In view of recent events in the Persian Gulf, it seemed to be a good question 
to ask a veterano who had seen the good and bad during six years in the Army. 
With the observance of Veterans Day looming, the query had, as reporters like 
to say, a timely hook to it. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. military service has been a proud tradition for many Mexican-American 
families, some of whom can trace their soldiering back to the Mexican 
Revolution of 1910 and before. Pictures of loved ones in uniform are a common 
sight in living rooms and dens from East Los Angeles to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The participation of Mexican-Americans during World War II and Korea was so 
significant that they received 17 Medals of Honor. In Vietnam, they won about a 
dozen more, and they accounted for 20% of all casualties from the U.S. 
Southwest. It also was not surprising to learn recently that a two-block 
stretch of La Verne Avenue in East L.A. has sent at least four sons to the 
Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardo Jordan -- a Chicano from Douglas, Ariz., whose two brothers also 
served in Vietnam -- is part of that tradicion. But he would not respond to my 
question. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, that's not a fair question," he protested. 
</P>
<P>
I wasn't surprised by Bernardo's reluctance. He's always been a little vague 
when it came to things he didn't want to discuss. "I was doing the Lord's work" 
was his way, for example, of describing lengthy, unexplained absences in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
He's been that way since we first met in Vietnam in 1971 at an artillery base 
in the Central Highlands village of Tra Bong. I was a seasoned first 
lieutenant, all of 23, who had left a company of combat-weary grunts to take up 
duties as a fire direction officer at Tra Bong. Bernardo was a sergeant on his 
second tour who sized up people quickly when he wasn't tending to his job as 
chief of an 8-inch howitzer artillery gun. 
</P>
<P>
"I never seen no mexicano officer before," he declared when he first saw me. 
"You sure the gringos saben que tu estas aqui fighting for them?" 
</P>
<P>
I laughed because I hadn't seen a Chicano officer in action either. 
</P>
<P>
The question that Bernardo dodged had been on my mind, especially since coming 
back from La Verne Avenue. Reporters are taught to be objective observers who 
record the views and events of news makers and ordinary citizens. Historians on 
the run are what some reporters like to be called. 
</P>
<P>
But I couldn't shake the thought: 
</P>
<P>
Why do Latinos continue to join the military in droves? And is there anything 
in the Vietnam experience that might temper the enthusiasm for joining up? 
</P>
<P>
In a recent article for The Times, I reported on the thoughts of the parents on 
La Verne who had sons in the Middle East. Their pride, I reported, came not 
only because the tiny street had sent so many to the Persian Gulf but also 
because their sons thought military service was a good thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
One parent, Rachel Reyes, has hoisted a black Navy SEAL banner on her modest 
stucco home until mi'jo, who is a member of that elite Navy group, comes home. 
In late August, she and a friend charged up La Verne to the site of the 
Whittier Boulevard bar where newsman Ruben Salazar was killed, and she hooted 
at marchers during the Chicano Moratorium 20th anniversary protest. 
</P>
<P>
She took heated issue with marchers who thought Iraq was "another word for 
Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
"We are so proud of him," she said of son Timothy. "I mean proud. . . . You 
know what I mean?" 
</P>
<P>
Mom and Dad were just as proud that I went overseas despite the prevalent 
anti-war sentiment that swept the country during the Vietnam conflict. 
</P>
<P>
They never talked about whether the pride would have turned to bitterness if I 
had come home in a coffin. 
</P>
<P>
But there are some veteranos, survivors of Vietnam, who are bitter. On the 
question Bernardo passed on, these vets are outspoken and to the point. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, clearly, we didn't learn the lesson," said David Valladolid, a 
Chicano white-collar state employee who was a rifleman with the 199th Light 
Infantry Brigade in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
The large number of Latinos still volunteering for the military "reflects the 
fact that young people to a large degree do not know about Vietnam," he said. 
"I don't see (military service) as a tradition for Chicanos who out of pride 
serve this country. To a large degree, it is the result of the condition that 
they find themselves in -- incredible lack of skills, the dropout rate (from 
school) is still high. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, parents still believe it provides a passage toward manhood." 
</P>
<P>
Valladolid, who grew up in San Diego, frequently networks with another Vietnam 
vet who also works for the state. David Rodriguez, a refugee from the San 
Joaquin Valley, now commutes to downtown Los Angeles from Corona. 
</P>
<P>
As he reflected on the question, Rodriguez, who was a grunt with the 9th 
Infantry Division in the Mekong Delta, was angry, too. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was drafted," said Rodriguez, "I was tapado," using the Chicano slang 
to emphasize that he was uninformed and not "savvy about politics." 
</P>
<P>
"(After the service) . . . I went to talk to about 100 members of a Chicano 
student group at a junior high school, and I was warned by the instructor that 
these kids were pro-Rambo, mesmerized by Rambo in the mold of John Wayne. I had 
to go through and explain that war isn't like it is in the movies. 
</P>
<P>
"People right now are getting bombarded by the media, which is glamorizing war 
all over again," Rodriguez said. "People think that's fashionable. I think it's 
disgusting. How are these people going to be received (after the service)? Will 
they be received like we were? Refused service at restaurants? Called 
baby-killers? 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of pride in what I did. I fought for my country and I'll do it 
again. I'm an American. But all through school, I was taught to speak up when I 
see something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Treviso, a Vietnam veterano whose grandfather rode with Pancho Villa 
during the Mexican Revolution, thinks young Latinos need to be repeatedly 
reminded that military service is not the only way out of the barrio. 
</P>
<P>
"After high school," said Treviso, who is working to create a memorial in 
Southern California for Latino veterans, "you should go to college. We don't 
have enough of those role models who go to college. We have a lot of the other 
role models who went into the service. Go to college first. Then maybe think 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
"You sound like a dove," I told him. 
</P>
<P>
"Very much so," he replied. "I have a lot of bitterness of what (Vietnam) did 
to our community. The individuals who will argue most vehemently for peaceful 
solutions to an international crisis will be those who have been to war." 
</P>
<P>
Bernardo doesn't let me get away with very much. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of our conversation, he turned the table on me. "Pues, Jorge," 
he asked, "what about you?" 
</P>
<P>
I didn't answer him right then. But I think Ruben Treviso is right. 
</P>
<P>
We do need to think about other options besides volunteering for the service. 
We do need to think about college even when it seems a remote possibility for 
many impoverished Latino families. Otherwise, we'll be doomed to another 
generation of veterans telling stories of what it was like "over there" and 
what has not happened here since they got back. 
</P>
<P>
As I'm writing this, I'm looking at a poster I pinned up next to my desk six 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
It features a brown-skinned veterano with an M-16 slung on his shoulder. It 
says, "The Hispanic Veteran -- valor, loyalty and pride." 
</P>
<P>
It's only one of many legacies Latinos should have.

Jose Jose's current BMG-Ariola album is aptly entitled "En las Buenas . . . y 
en las Malas" (In Good Times . . . and Bad"), a reflection on the artist's past 
personal and professional troubles. Now, things could not be better for the 
charismatic performer, who kicked off the celebration of his 25th year in show 
biz at the Greek Theatre, with an audience that included Mexican sexpot Olga 
Breeskin. The singer, known as "The Prince of Song," continued his tour with a 
series of concerts in his native Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Spain's Rocio Durcal, on a U.S. tour until December, is celebrating her 30th 
year on international stages. She will perform at the L.A. Sports Arena Nov. 
11, her second recent local engagement. Durcal's 46th birthday coincided with 
her October appearance at Universal Amphitheater. A largely Mexican audience 
there was treated to a repertoire of Mexican music, including cuts from her 
latest album, "Si Te Pudiera Mentir" ("If I Could Lie To You"), produced by 
Marco Antonio Solis of the musical group Los Bukis. Argentine pianist Raul Di 
Biasio opened the concert. 
</P>
<P>
Spectators at France's Deauville Film Festival selected "Aunt Julia and the 
Scriptwriter," based on a novel by Peruvian author Mario Vargas Llosa, as their 
favorite American movie of the year. The film, which stars Peter Falk and 
Barbara Hershey, recently opened nationally with its title changed to "Tune in 
Tomorrow" for U.S. distribution. The romantic comedy is set in the 1950s, with 
Falk playing an eccentric writer of radio scripts. 
</P>
<P>
Julio Iglesias and Veronica Castro (who stars in Univision's soap-opera "Mi 
pequena soledad") were chosen as the favorite performers of Latinos living in 
the United States. The recent survey, conducted by Market Development Inc. in 
six major cities, showed the top five "Favorite Musical Performers" to be: 
Iglesias, Los Bukis, Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound Machine, Jose Jose and 
Jose Luis Rodriguez. The five leading "favorite actor/actress" ratings: Castro, 
Charles Bronson, Vicente Fernandez, Sylvester Stallone and Lucia Mendez. 
</P>
<P>
Top rated KTNQ-AM radio personality Humberto Luna received his star on 
Hollywood's Walk of Fame, the first Latino radio announcer to be so honored. 
Luna expressed his appreciation saying, "This award is important because it 
shows the growing number of Latinos in Los Angeles. Spanish-language radio has 
grown tremendously, and it is because of its amazing evolution that I am being 
honored today." Another Latino entertainment figure, Puerto Rican recording 
star Tito Puente, received his star in August. ELENA KELLNER

NORTHROP WILL CUT 800 JOBS AND CLOSE A PLANT; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: THE NEWBURY PARK FACILITY WILL BE SHUT DOWN BY 1991, AND MANY OF ITS 
1,800 WORKERS WILL BE TRANSFERRED. THREE UNITS WILL BE COMBINED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Northrop Corp. said Wednesday that it would close its Newbury Park plant in 
Ventura County, eliminate another 800 jobs and consolidate key divisions. 
</P>
<P>
The news wasn't unexpected. In May, Northrop said it would lay off 3,000 
workers and hinted that further cutbacks were possible. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the 1,800 Newbury Park workers will be transferred to the company's 
aircraft plant in Hawthorne, where Northrop produces fuselage sections for the 
Boeing 747 jetliner, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop said the 28-year-old Newbury Park plant would be closed by 1991, and 
production of drone aircraft -- used for gunnery training by the military -- 
would be moved to Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Harris, an aerospace analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in 
Los Angeles, said the shutdown of the Newbury Park plant wasn't a surprise, 
especially in light of previously announced cutbacks at the defense contractor, 
including closing a plant in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"This move has been under study for some time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop didn't say how much it expected to save by consolidating and shrinking 
its operations. The company said it would eventually sell its Newbury Park 
plant and the 100 acres of land around it. The plant and property are estimated 
to be worth $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
The 800 jobs to be cut will come from Northrop's entire aircraft division, 
including the Newbury Park facility and other plants, Northrop said. About 400 
of those jobs will be eliminated through attrition and retirements, the firm 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop is streamlining in response to cuts in defense spending and to make 
its operations more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, the aerospace firm announced Wednesday that it was combining 
its three separate electronics units into a single new electronics and avionics 
division to be headed by Wallace C. Solberg, the vice president who currently 
runs one of the electronics units. Its headquarters will be in Rolling Meadows, 
Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, a Northrop spokesman said that David N. Ferguson, a high-ranking 
executive who oversaw the electronics operations and was close to former 
Chairman Thomas V. Jones, has retired. 
</P>
<P>
Jones retired in September after 27 years with Northrop amid allegations of 
fraud and bribery. The company is said to be the subject of 12 separate probes, 
including one that centers on a charge that it paid a $6.25-million bribe to a 
Korean power broker to sell its F-20 jet fighter to the Korean government. 
</P>
<P>
The consolidation moves are part of an effort by Ken Kresa, Northrop's new 
chairman and chief executive, to make the defense manufacturer more efficient 
in what is shaping up as a hostile environment for defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
"We are making Northrop a new kind of company for the environment we have ahead 
of us," Kresa said in a statment. "We are going to be sized right for the 
future and, even more important, we are going to be focused right."

Aerospace analyst Paul H. Nisbet with Prudential-Bache Securities in New York 
said the electronics consolidation made sense. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the last two or three years, Northrop has moved up rapidly as one of the 
technical leaders in the business, but management didn't keep up with that," 
Nisbet said. "Since Ken Kresa took over from Jones, he's been moving to correct 
that situation and bring up the quality of management, along with the good 
technology they already have." 
</P>
<P>
The consolidation may in part be designed to address some recent criticisms of 
the company's management structure. A special military review of Northrop's 
operations made public last month said the company operates "as a loose 
federation of autonomous divisions" with little or no management development. 
One military supervisor said he could not identify a single Northrop program 
that operated without difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop said the consolidation of the electronics units -- in Hawthorne and 
Norwood, Mass., wouldn't affect employment. 
</P>
<P>
One analyst said, however, that the consolidation might in part reflect the 
loss of business in one of the electronics units. Harris, the Bateman Eichler 
analyst, said the electronics unit in Hawthorne will lose to Rockwell the 
contract for an inertial measurement device that is used in the guidance system 
of the MX missile. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps some shrinkage is going on," he said. At the same time, he added, 
Northrop's work on an electronic system for the F-15 fighter might compensate 
for the loss. 
</P>
<P>
A Northrop spokesman said the consolidation wouldn't affect a government ban 
imposed on one of its electronics units. The precision products division, which 
is based in Massachusetts and makes gyroscopes and other devices, faces 
criminal fraud charges and has been under Air Force suspension since July, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop, which is fighting the suspension, said the government ban would 
spread to its other electronics units after the consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Northrop Corp.'s move to close its 28-year-old, 670,000-square-foot Newbury 
Park facility in Ventura County follows earlier decisions to shut its 
electronics operations in Anaheim and the sale of its corporate headquarters in 
Century City. The retrenchment has occurred amid declines in a number of 
Northrop's businesses as the national defense budget decreases. It also occurs 
in the context of severe operational and legal problems at Northrop, which has 
experienced massive cost overruns and technical difficulties on the B-2 Stealth 
bomber.

FOR THE RECORD

<P>
Northrop -- A story in Wednesday's editions incorrectly described legal actions 
involving a division of Northrop Corp. and the impact of a U.S. Air Force 
suspension. In February, the company pleaded guilty to criminal fraud charges 
that it falsified tests on a device made by the precision products division. An 
Air Force suspension imposed on the division will not affect other units of the 
company. In addition, the name of Northrop's chairman was misspelled. He is 
Kent Kresa.

Black Journalists Won't Sell List to News: Striking New York Daily News workers 
have pressured a black journalists organization into rescinding its offer to 
provide management with a list of potential replacement workers. At one point, 
the National Assn. of Black Journalists had agreed to sell its list for $400. 
Association President Thomas Morgan announced the decision after striking 
workers held three news conferences, sent him a telegram and telephoned him.

Citicorp to Redeem Stock: The bank said it would redeem $275 million of the 
$950 million of money market preferred securities that it offered just two 
weeks ago at record high interest rates. The move succeeded in driving interest 
rates down: When Citicorp auctioned similar paper, it produced an interest rate

Investor Buys Caesars World Stake: San Diego real estate investor M. Larry 
Lawrence has purchased about 400,000 shares of Los Angeles-based Caesars World 
Inc., the casino operator. 
</P>
<P>
The stake, less than 2%, is an investment accumulated over four months, said 
Alan Aiello, investment manager for Lawrence, who owns the Hotel del Coronado 
in San Diego. "We bought it not as a shot at a buyout, but as a core holding," 
Aiello said. There has been speculation that Caesars is a takeover candidate. 
Caesars stock fell 12.5 cents to $15.125 Wednesday.

Fujitsu to Unveil Smallest Pocket Phone: The world's smallest pocket cellular 
phone -- a 10.2-ounce package slightly larger than a box of deluxe cigarettes 
-- is expected to be unveiled today in Los Angeles by Fujitsu America Inc. 
Although it is only slightly smaller than Mitsubishi and Motorola models, its 
aggressive $1,195 price is sure to bring new competition to the pocket phone 
market, already the fastest growing segment of the cellular equipment industry.

Daily News Plans Layoffs: The Daily News plans to lay off nine editorial 
employees, according to an official of the Los Angeles Newspaper Guild. 
Rochelle Howe, a guild organizer, said an attorney for the Daily News, based in 
Woodland Hills, told the union of the impending layoffs. Editorial employees, 
who include reporters and photographers, elected the guild in April, 1989, to 
represent them in contract negotiations with management, but the two sides have 
yet to reach an agreement.

SABER RATTLING PUSHES OIL PRICES UP $2.68 A BARREL

<P>
Oil prices shot up nearly $3 per barrel Wednesday after British Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher warned that war could be imminent in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The surge gained momentum when a confidante of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak 
said the countdown for confrontation had begun, resurrecting anxiety among oil 
traders that the flow of petroleum supplies would face disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
Traders were also responding to reports that Secretary of State James A. Baker 
III had given Iraqi President Saddam Hussein an ultimatum for vacating Kuwait, 
though Baker denied the reports. 
</P>
<P>
Light, sweet crude closed $2.68 higher at $35.31 per barrel for December 
delivery contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil had opened 28 cents 
lower at $32.35 a barrel, then moved ahead by more than $3 to the day's high of 
$35.45 before settling back. 
</P>
<P>
Contracts for delivery in later months all moved higher, many by the daily 
limit imposed by the exchange of $1.50 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
The escalating words of war on Wednesday injected new life into a crude market 
that had been sluggish for more than a week.

BROKERAGE IN FLUOR HEADQUARTERS SALE AWARDED $6 MILLION BY JURY

<P>
After three days of deliberation, an Orange County Superior Court jury 
Wednesday awarded an Irvine brokerage at least $6 million as a commission for 
its role in the 1985 sale of Fluor Corp.'s headquarters to a Texas developer. 
</P>
<P>
The jury ruled in favor of Lee &amp; Associates in the closely watched, 
5-year-old lawsuit filed against Fluor, the large Irvine-based engineering and 
construction firm, and Trammell Crow Co., the Dallas-based office builder. 
</P>
<P>
The case, which went to trial in late July and continued intermittently until 
Friday, drew widespread attention because of the corporate names involved, the 
large sums of money at stake and the complex issues in question. 
</P>
<P>
Lee was seeking a $9-million commission. The finding of fraud allows the firm 
to make a claim for punitive damages.

POMONA FIRM SUING MICROSOFT OVER FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Z-Nix, a tiny Pomona supplier of personal computer "mice," on Wednesday filed a 
lawsuit against giant Microsoft Corp. for restraint of trade and breach of 
contract. The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, seeks damages 
of at least $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that Microsoft, after agreeing to license its popular Windows 
software to Z-Nix for $27.50 per copy, sought to double that fee when the 
Pomona company wanted to pair the software with its own product, a mouse device 
used to point to material on personal computer screens. Z-Nix alleges that 
Microsoft's fee hike, which effectively prices the Z-Nix product out of the 
market, is an attempt to protect its own brand of competing PC mouse devices. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time for us to stand up to Microsoft's unfair trade practices and stop 
the slow death of innovation in the industry," said Thomas T. Chan, the Los 
Angeles attorney for Z-Nix. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Microsoft said the Redmond, Wash., company had no comment on 
the suit. 
</P>
<P>
As Microsoft's revenue grows to more than $1 billion a year and its product 
reach expands, the firm is increasingly coming under intense criticism within 
the PC industry for what often-envious rivals claim are unfair competitive 
practices. Many of the complaints stem from Microsoft's ownership of the most 
popular personal computer operating system, MS-DOS, and the favorable position 
it affords the company when it develops personal computer software programs. 
</P>
<P>
Microsoft extended its reach in the PC industry with the release earlier this 
year of the latest version of Windows, a software program that doubles as an 
operating system. Windows has proven a huge success for Microsoft, and is 
forcing other software publishers to scramble to develop programs that work 
with it.

BALLROOM DANCING MAKES A COMEBACK, SOMETIMES WITH A WEST COAST SPIN

Three feet. That was the lean margin that saved Betty and Gene Taylor's lives 
the night that two elevated walkways above the lobby of the posh Hyatt Regency 
Hotel in Kansas City collapsed during a crowded swing dance contest, killing 
114. 
</P>
<P>
Dancing to the Duke Ellington standard "Satin Doll," Gene Taylor had just 
"thrown" his wife out into a twirl when the Santa Ana couple heard a roar and 
turned to see a huge cloud of smoke arise from the crashing debris. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just three feet from where the skywalks fell," recalls Betty, who 
can't talk about the narrow escape, even nine years later, without getting 
goose bumps. Waiting under freeway overpasses for lights to change gives her 
the jitters, too. 
</P>
<P>
Grave as it was, however, the hotel disaster did not dampen a zest for dancing 
that Betty, 62, and Gene, 70, have kept alive since high school. 
</P>
<P>
"Tired? No, just warm," said Gene, after nimbly leading his partner through a 
round of under-the-arm dance turns at Costa Mesa's Red Lion Hotel on a recent 
Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"We write it down on the calendar: 'Go dancing,' " he said above the brassy 
strains of the 19-piece Tracey Wells Big Swing Band. "I feel 40 years younger 
when I'm dancing. I really do." 
</P>
<P>
The Taylors' passion for social or ballroom dance is shared by enthusiasts 
nationwide who have fueled a resurgence in the avocation's popularity over the 
past several years. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, where a throng of 1,000 is typical at one monthly dance fest, 
the pastime is practiced day and evening by devotees who flock to busy 
nightspots, dance academies and competitions, whether to rumba, swing, fox trot 
or waltz. 
</P>
<P>
"Our mailing list has grown by leaps and bounds over the past two years," said 
Ken Allan, who books big bands into the Irvine Marriott Hotel's Rendezvous 
Ballroom about once a month. 
</P>
<P>
"I go dancing every day and twice on Sunday," said Bettye Murphy, part of a 
capacity crowd that filled the spacious lounge at Fullerton's Dia mond 
Restaurant by 8:30 on a recent Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it. It's good exercise, it's good for meeting people and I love the 
music," said Murphy, 55, whose partner, Joe Ciraulo, had just brought her head 
within inches of the floor in a slow, sweeping dip. 
</P>
<P>
Rock 'n' roll may have temporarily rendered touch-dancing passe, but couples 
have begun to return to each others' arms, said Kevin Richardson, co-owner of 
the Fred Astaire Dance Studio in Costa Mesa, where enrollment has quadrupled in 
the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether it's husbands and wives, girlfriends and boyfriends, boyfriends and 
boyfriends or whatever, couples are wanting to dance together because it's 
something they can share, and they don't have to compete with each other," 
Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
Swing, which became California's official state dance last year, is 
particularly popular. While other fads -- such as the pelvis-friendly lambada 
-- have come and gone, the lively dance widely known by its jitterbug and Lindy 
Hop variations seems here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been into clubs all over the country for the last 30 years, and in the 
last two to three years, I haven't seen lambada danced at all," said Robert L. 
Bryant, president of the Phoenix-based United States Swing Dance Council. 
"Swing has been around for at least 50 years, and it's getting nothing but 
stronger and stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Swing dance conventions or competitions -- often up to three on a weekend -- 
are held just about every month throughout the country, where members of about 
200 swing clubs meet regularly to dance, Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County hosts the annual U.S. Open Swing Dance Championship, the nation's 
biggest contest of its kind, to be held for the eighth time over Thanksgiving 
weekend at Anaheim's Disneyland Hotel. And about 1,000 individuals belong to 
the county's two swing clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Wetzel of Anaheim is president of the 10-year-old Rebels Swing Dance 
Club, whose initiates dance to the discs he spins on weekends at Westminster's 
Press Box. 
</P>
<P>
Wetzel, 61, one of five inductees into the U.S. Swing Dance Council Hall of 
Fame, says swing temporarily took a back seat to the twist in the '60s and the 
hustle in the '70s. "But it bounced back, and it's probably bigger than ever 
now," he said. "It never died." 
</P>
<P>
Swing first surfaced in the 1930s in New Orleans, Wetzel said, then found its 
way into Mississippi "juke joints" and finally to New York City's Harlem. 
</P>
<P>
During World War II, when big bands reigned, swing "really became the dance of 
the U.S. because it represented freedom of movement, and that's what we were 
all about: freedom," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several Orange County spots for swing and other social dances attract a 
clientele that's 40 and over. The 55+ Club meets at the Red Lion Hotel's Sunday 
afternoon big-band dances, says club founder J. Bud Morris, who organizes the 
socials. The average age at Press Box weekends is 45, Wetzel said. 
</P>
<P>
But swing has lured younger followers, too, such as Keldee Bjerknes, 21, who 
eschews the freestyle solo dancing she used to do. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a lot more challenging, and you're working with another person, which 
makes it a lot more fun," said Bjerknes, dabbing the sweat from her brow as she 
took a break at a recent Press Box dance. 
</P>
<P>
One of about a dozen people there who were under 35, Bjerknes loosely adhered 
to a basic swing pattern. But the Lancaster resident, sporting a short 
blue-jean skirt and bare midriff, gave a contemporary spin to traditional 
swing. Whether to '40s big-band classics, R&amp;B tunes or Top 40 hits, she 
added so-called body waves -- undulating from her hips to the top of her head 
-- as well as freezes and hip rolls, which look like they sound. 
</P>
<P>
Bjerknes, a mother and secretary, also prefers the friendly, unthreatening 
atmosphere she finds when she goes out to swing dance. As is typical of other 
local social dance spots, she finds that few patrons drink, smoke or stay 
seated. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a meat market. People come to dance," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Another magnet for younger dancers is Anaheim's Band Stand, where 700 patrons, 
most aged 25 to 35, regularly jam three dance floors on Sunday country-Western 
nights. Some stick to the Texas two-step made famous by the movie "Urban 
Cowboy," but plenty perform an updated swing, letting bolos fly, ruffled 
miniskirts swirl and cowboy boots kick. 
</P>
<P>
Bellflower-based swing teacher and dancer Phil Adams said the dance has evolved 
since its early days. 
</P>

"Old-time" swing dancers emphasize footwork, smoothness of style and a more 
rigidly erect torso, said Adams, 32. "But we don't care if we're facing 
shoulder to shoulder or not. The music makes us want to move, so why stay so 
conformed? We're having more fun." 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the number of dancers taking to West Coast Swing, the style most 
practiced locally, "is probably growing greater in the country community than 
anywhere else," Adams said. He explained that the versatile dance can be done 
to any sort of music, from blues to Top 40 to country-Western, that "gives you 
that pumping, bouncy feeling," and he added that country-Western fans dance as 
couples to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
Another swing arena attracting younger -- sometimes much younger -- dancers are 
dance competitions. 
</P>
<P>
About 15 Orange County couples have entered November's U.S. Open Swing Dance 
Competition, more than half of them in a Young America category for 6- to 
18-year-olds, said Jack Bridges, director of the event. 
</P>
<P>
"The Young America Division was the first to fill up this year," Bridges said. 
"You have a whole generation of kids that never learned how to dance, they just 
stand apart from one another and gyrate. They never had the fun and intimacy of 
partner dancing." 
</P>
<P>
Bret Dieball of Costa Mesa, a 10-year swing veteran at 18, won the U.S. Open in 
1987 and will compete this year. It all started in elementary school when a 
classmate begged him to appear in a dance recital as Little Boy Blue. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kinda sketchy on it because a guy dancing is thought to be a weirdo or 
something," Dieball said. "But I went and tried it out and enjoyed it, so I 
stayed with it." The Orange Coast College student, who likes to dance at 
Disneyland where big bands play on Saturday nights, said it's great for his 
social life, too. 
</P>
<P>
"With swing, you get to lead the ladies and they like it. It's new for them," 
he said.

FIRST STEPS TO SWING

Beginners who want to learn to swing dance should don comfortable shoes and 
head straight to class, rather than wing it in a nightclub, says Betty Ladwig, 
president and co-founder of Orange County's West Coast Swing Dance Club. 
</P>
<P>
"If they've never danced before, I'd recommend beginning swing lessons with a 
good teacher," says Ladwig, 54, who's been dancing all her life. 
</P>
<P>
To find a good teacher, the Placentia resident suggests asking good dancers 
where to go. Orange County has plenty of teachers, but not all are top-notch or 
even acceptable, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, two lessons a week plus one independent practice session should 
suffice. "You need to become uninhibited," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A "street dancer" who never had a lesson, Ladwig surmised that it could take 
from three months to a year before tyros are able to go out in public and 
confidently hold their own. "It all depends on the person's individual 
ability," she said. Zan Dubin

ORANGE COUNTY GOP CLAIMING CREDIT FOR VICTORY BY WILSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County Republicans may have meant the difference in Governor-elect Pete 
Wilson's narrow victory over Dianne Feinstein, and they might still prove 
decisive in the neck-and-neck race for attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
But they didn't support any of the other GOP's statewide candidates in large 
enough numbers to put them over the top, and county Democrats scored a big 
victory in local legislative races. 
</P>
<P>
Based on unofficial returns, and with 50,000 absentee ballots in the county 
still to be counted, Wilson won the county by about 193,000 votes -- almost 
identical to his statewide margin of about 186,000 votes. 
</P>
<P>
"That means Orange County delivered the state once again for a Republican 
governor," county GOP chairman Tom Fuentes said. 
</P>
<P>
State party chairman Frank Visco agreed. "Obviously, Orange County played a 
significant role in his (Wilson's) election," Visco said. "They say you can be 
guaranteed a win with a 200,000 margin in Orange County, and he may well end up 
with that after the absentees are counted." 
</P>
<P>
The only other Republican candidate who won overwhelming support among Orange 
County voters was attorney general candidate Dan Lungren, who tallied about 
177,000 more votes here than Democrat Arlo Smith. Smith was leading statewide 
by about 30,000 votes but, with up to half a million absentee ballots as yet 
uncounted statewide, that race remained too close to call Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Other statewide GOP candidates, including those from Orange County, did not 
fare so well here. State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), easily 
defeated by incumbent Leo T. McCarthy in her bid for lieutenant governor, won 
the county by just 147,000 votes. Former Huntington Beach City Councilman Wes 
Bannister eked out a 40,000-vote lead in the county over Democrat John 
Garamendi in the race for insurance commissioner, but Garamendi swamped 
Bannister statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of state candidate Joan Milke Flores, state controller hopeful Matt 
Fong and incumbent Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes also won Republican Orange County 
by insufficient margins to turn the tide against the rest of the state. 
</P>
<P>
And in the only competitive state legislative race in the county, the 
Republican incumbent, Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), was defeated by Democrat 
Tom Umberg -- despite a heavy Republican voter registration drive and visits to 
Pringle's 72nd Assembly District by President Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle, 
former President Ronald Reagan and many other Republican luminaries. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they certainly came through for Pete Wilson," Eileen Padberg, 
political consultant for the county GOP, said about Republican leaders. 
</P>
<P>
But, she added: "I understand they spent a ton of money to get out the vote and 
didn't get the results they claimed they could produce. . . . There probably 
will be some changes." 
</P>
<P>
In the heated battle for the 72nd Assembly District, Umberg beat Pringle by 
about 1,300 votes, reclaiming a seat firmly held by Democrats until 1986 and 
giving them their first foothold in the county since that time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wonderful victory for us," said County Democratic Party chairman Mike 
Balmages. "It gives us a lot more credibility in the county and a lot more 
power. . . . It's what we needed to invigorate the party." 
</P>
<P>
The county's Sacramento delegation will have one other new face next year: 
Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays, who beat Long Beach public relations 
executive Luanne W. Pryor in the 58th Assembly District race. Mays, a 
Republican, finished with about 54% of the vote, defeating Pryor both in the 
Los Angeles County and Orange County portions of the district. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Pringle, Orange County's incumbent legislators easily 
held on to their offices, although by somewhat smaller margins than they did in 
1988 -- evidence of anti-incumbent sentiment that, in a county with two more 
closely matched parties, might have resulted in more turnover. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange), for example, was reelected with 66% of 
the vote, down from almost 75% two years ago. Similarly, winning total of 
Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress) dropped from 69.5% in 1988 to 60% this 
year. Assemblyman Nolan Frizzelle (R-Fountain Valley) finished with about 
62.5%, down from 70.4% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In county government races, Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder easily beat back a 
challenge from Westminster Councilwoman Joy L. Neugebauer, winning election to 
her fourth consecutive term, 55% to 44%. 
</P>
<P>
Appointed Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi is now an elected district attorney, 
having defeated Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. James Enright, 55% to 45%. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime county Supt. of Schools Robert Peterson, however, lost in a landslide 
to Whittier College Prof. John F. Dean, who garnered more than 62% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most startling turnaround from recent years was the vote for 
Measure M, a half-cent sales tax increase to pay for transportation 
improvements. The measure, almost identical to one that failed a year ago, 
passed easily, winning more than 54% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
"That presents absolutely a major milestone for transportation solutions in 
Orange County," Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said. "To have turned that corner 
was a tremendous stride in progress." 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez attributed the measure's success this year to voters' better 
understanding of what the increase would pay for. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 28 statewide ballot measures that made voting a true exercise in 
democracy this year, the county voted opposite from the rest of California in 
just three cases: 
</P>
<P>
True to its anti-tax tradition, Orange County strongly approved Proposition 
136, which would have made it more difficult to increase special and local 
taxes or impose new ones. The measure was defeated statewide, 52% to 48%. 
</P>
<P>
County voters also favored Proposition 137, which would have required that 
changes in initiative or referendum procedures be submitted to the electorate. 
Voters statewide shot down the measure, 55% to 45%. 
</P>
<P>
The county was consistent in its opposition to bond measures, voting against 
all but Proposition 142, the Veteran's Bond Act. Voters statewide, however, 
also approved Proposition 146, a bond for school facilities, 52% to 48%. County 
voters opposed it, 56% to 44%. 
</P>
<P>
Further distinguishing themselves from the statewide trend, county voters much 
more convincingly favored strict limits for state officeholders than did the 
rest of California. The measure, Proposition 140, was narrowly approved, 51% to 
48%. But Orange County voters, perhaps recognizing an easy way to clear 
Democrats out of Sacramento, backed the initiative, 60% to 40%. 
</P>
<P>
While voters countywide resoundingly rejected Proposition 128, the Big Green 
Initiative, 70% to 30%, Laguna Beach residents approved an environmental 
measure of their own by an even greater margin.

TAXES: CANNY STRATEGY, WORSENING TRAFFIC, GOOD VOTER TURNOUT COMBINED TO LIFT 
O.C. TRANSIT INITIATIVE, EVEN AS OTHER POCKETBOOK MEASURES WERE REJECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It took ever-worsening Orange County traffic, relatively high voter turnout and 
a canny campaign strategy to pull Measure M from the ashes of last year's 
defeat, political experts said Wednesday as they sifted through nearly complete 
election returns. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the controversial half-cent sales tax overcame formidable obstacles 
-- including a sluggish national economy and recent increases in state and 
federal gasoline taxes -- and still managed to pass, 54% to 46%, on a night 
when statewide voters resoundingly rejected measures that took aim at their 
pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
"In many respects, Orange County came of age last night," said Newport Beach 
political analyst Harvey Englander. "The voters here decided to shoulder 
responsibility for themselves, which is actually a very conservative thought." 
</P>
<P>
Measure M's victory was made more remarkable by the failure of two state 
alcohol-tax proposals and two initiatives that proposed taxing residents to pay 
for fighting crime and drug abuse. All four of those measures went down to 
defeat in Orange County as well, but Measure M escaped being lumped together 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
A transportation sales tax in Los Angeles County passed as well, but voters 
there had previously backed a transportation tax, so observers were less 
surprised by that election. Ventura County voters soundly rejected a sales tax 
on their ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of Measure M's victory and the statewide rejection of most tax 
proposals created an extraordinary moment in Orange County politics: Voters 
here, traditionally the most conservative in the state, found themselves ahead 
of many Californians in voting to charge themselves more for government 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ironic on the surface," Reed Royalty, the Pacific Bell executive who led 
the pro-Measure M campaign, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think what it shows is that Orange County people aren't necessarily 
averse to paying taxes," he said. "I think they're willing to pay taxes when 
they know what they're getting. . . . I'm not against paying for groceries when 
I know what they are. It's when I go to the grocery store and am asked to buy 
an unmarked can of goods that I'm averse to it." 
</P>
<P>
Armed with the conviction -- and the polling data -- that other county voters 
would share that view, Measure M's backers directed their 1990 campaign toward 
informing residents of exactly what they would get for their half-cent on the 
dollar. Supporters also benefited from reasonably strong voter turnout, unlike 
that of 1989, which guaranteed a broader cross-section of voters at the polls 
rather than a concentration of Orange County's deeply conservative core 
electorate. 
</P>
<P>
And in the time from last year's defeat to this year's victory, traffic 
continued to get worse, feeding the frustration that Measure M promises to 
combat. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the tax credited that combination of strategy and circumstance 
for their victory; opponents, tenacious in their underfunded efforts to derail 
the tax, were bitter in defeat. Voters, they said, were duped. 
</P>
<P>
"The people were fooled into believing that these projects have merit, when 
most of them don't," said Bill Ward, a spokesman for Drivers for Highway 
Safety, which opposes Measure M partly because it will help pay for car-pool 
lanes. "They were just plain fooled." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Rogers, a San Juan Capistrano slow-growth advocate and leader of the anti-M 
campaign, likewise said voters mistakenly embraced a poor remedy to the 
region's increasingly snarled traffic: "I think that people were so desperate 
that they were willing to tax themselves for any solution to the traffic mess, 
good or bad." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike last year's campaign, in which a county-record $2.5 million was spent in 
defeat, the 1990 effort consistently kept a lower profile. Supporters still 
raised more than $1 million this year, most of it from developers and big 
business interests, but the lower-intensity campaign drew less attention to the 
measure's developer backing. 
</P>
<P>
Still, as Election Day drew near, prospects for Measure M remained uncertain. 
Polls in the closing days of the campaign showed that the proposal enjoyed a 
narrow lead, but support was still short of a majority. The poll numbers, in 
fact, closely resembled those in the closing days of the 1989 race. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Measure M took a narrow poll advantage into the election only to fail, 
53% to 47%. A 1-cent tax proposal in 1984 was even more overwhelmingly 
defeated, with 70% of county voters who cast ballots voting against it. 
</P>
<P>
Confronted with a shaky lead, Measure M backers waged a low-key, last-minute 
mail and telephone campaign that many observers credited with putting the 
proposal over the top. The mailers were informational and understated, part of 
the campaign's intentional desire to steer away from a furious rhetorical 
battle as Election Day drew near. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran a low-profile campaign targeted to voters willing to listen," said 
David J. Townsend, a Sacramento-based political consultant who advised the 
Measure M campaign.

CRIME, ENVIRONMENT HAD ROLES IN RACE

<P>
Voters have filled four City Council seats with two candidates backed by 
environmental organizations and two viewed as more sympathetic to developers. 
</P>
<P>
The reelection of Grace Winchell and the addition of Linda Moulton-Patterson to 
the council will create a pro-environment bloc of three on the seven-member 
council, counting incumbent Peter M. Green, whose term isn't up until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Moulton-Patterson, president of the Huntington Beach Union High School District 
Board of Trustees, led the 11-candidate field in the City Council race. 
Winchell easily won a second four-year term on the council. 
</P>
<P>
Voters also elected Earle Robitaille and Jack Kelly, both of whom were seen as 
pro-development candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Robitaille is a former police chief and Kelly is a former two-term councilman. 
They and Moulton-Patterson emphasized crime control in their campaign mailers. 
The late-blooming law-and-order issue, according to some observers, may have 
been more decisive than environmental concerns in Tuesday's election. "Law and 
order is clearly the No. 1 issue on people's minds," Robitaille said. "There's 
a lot of concern about the gangs that have been spilling over into the city, as 
well as concern about narcotics." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, a former television actor who co-starred in the old "Maverick" series, 
prominently used a policeman's photo in one of his campaign mailers. Kelly, 
Robitaille and Moulton-Patterson also enjoyed the backing of the Huntington 
Beach Police Officers' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
But a fourth candidate backed by the police officers, Ed Mountford, finished 
sixth behind environmental candidate Mark Porter. 
</P>
<P>
Voters overwhelmingly supported Measure C, a citizens' initiative that would 
prohibit the city's selling or leasing park or beach land without a citywide 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
The measure was passed just a week before the city's most controversial 
development, Pierside Village, is scheduled to come before the City Council. 
Pierside Village would include new restaurants on beachfront land near the 
pier. Environmentalists say that passage of Measure C now means that the city 
cannot lease this land, but some officials, including Mayor Thomas J. Mays, say 
Pierside Village is protected by a previous lease. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, the city Planning Commission voted 4 to 3 to approve Pierside 
Village. The City Council is scheduled to take up the project on Nov. 19. BILL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HMS BOUNTY SAILS TO REUNION OF SAILORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A famous ship that once served as the setting for a big-budget Hollywood movie 
spent most of Wednesday sailing in the waters of Newport Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The HMS Bounty, which was built for the 1962 MGM film "Mutiny on the Bounty," 
arrived in Orange County around noon to give the ship's 16-member crew the 
chance to attend a private dinner at the home of Newport Beach resident Dan 
Elliot. 
</P>
<P>
"At 169 feet, it's probably one of the biggest sailing vessels that's ever been 
in this harbor," said Elliot, a petroleum geologist. 
</P>
<P>
Last March, Elliot discovered that the ship would be sailing through Newport 
waters following a promotional stop in San Pedro. Elliott, who sailed in yacht 
races for 45 years, thought the ship's arrival offered the occasion for a 
reunion of old sailing friends. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought this would be a good way to bring a lot of old sailing friends 
together who have drifted apart over the years. More than 200 people have come 
from as far as San Francisco and San Diego to be here," Elliot said. 
</P>
<P>
The ship, now owned by media mogul Ted Turner, is a re-creation of the 
ill-fated ship that left its mark on maritime history more than 200 years ago 
when a small group of its crewmen didn't want to leave Tahiti and mutinied. 
</P>
<P>
The replica cost $700,000 to build and is now valued at an estimated $6 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The famous vessel was scheduled to leave the bay at sunrise today and will next 
sail to San Diego, where it is expected to remain for two months for repairs, 
Elliot said. 
</P>
<P>
Turner acquired the boat in 1986 when he purchased MGM's properties. He has 
since put the ship and its two 220-horsepower engines to work on promotional 
tours across the country, including a just-completed 20-city tour of the West 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to appearing in "Mutiny on the Bounty," the HMS Bounty was also 
featured in the 1983 film "Yellowbeard," which starred the late Marty Feldman 
and members of the Monty Python comedy troupe and in a 1990 remake of "Treasure 
Island," which starred Charlton Heston.GREG HERNANDEZ

ABSENTEE VOTES MAY DECIDE COUNCIL SEAT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Absentee ballots may decide who fills one City Council seat, with Wednesday's 
election tallies showing incumbent Walter Bowman leading challenger Chuck Hicks 
by just 213 votes. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman, a real estate agent, placed third in the race behind former Councilman 
Richard Partin and challenger Joyce Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
It was Bowman's first test at the polls since being appointed to the council in 
June, 1989, by a court order. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past we haven't had a lot of deviation" from election night totals, 
City Clerk Lillian Haina said. "But you never know." 
</P>
<P>
Hicks said he didn't think the absentee ballots would make a difference in the 
race. "I am happy with the campaign that I ran," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The final tally should be available by next Tuesday, Haina said. 
</P>
<P>
Three four-year terms were up for grabs in Tuesday's election. Councilwoman 
Margaret M. Arnold decided not to seek reelection and Councilman John Kanel was 
prohibited from running again because of the city's limit of two terms for 
council members. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson, also a real estate agent, led all candidates in the balloting. She 
has been active in the city for several years and is president of Concerned 
Citizens of Cypress, a powerful grass-roots group. 
</P>
<P>
"I am so happy," said Nicholson. "I was just hoping to place." 
</P>
<P>
However, Nicholson's strength wasn't enough to carry challenger John 
Standiford, who ran on a slate with her. Standiford, a former staffer with 
state Sen. Cecil Green (D-Norwalk), finished last, behind Judith Pineda. 
</P>
<P>
Voters also defeated a proposal to re-establish the city's defunct Planning 
Commission. The commission was abolished several years ago to offset 
Proposition 13 cutbacks. LYNDA NATALI

VARDOULIS CAPTURES OPEN COUNCIL SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A conservative former councilman won his bid to fill an open council seat, 
defeating two slow-growth candidates. 
</P>
<P>
With some absentee ballots still being counted Wednesday, unofficial results 
showed that Bill Vardoulis, 52, won the special election to fill the council 
seat vacated by Sally Anne Sheridan when she was elected mayor in June. 
</P>
<P>
The other major item on the Irvine ballot, Measure E, went down to defeat by 
more than 3 to 2. The measure would have scrapped the city's two-year-old 
system of having voters select the mayor. Measure E's failure marked the third 
time since 1986 that voters have said they want to elect their mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Vardoulis' victory over his slow-growth competitors, Michael Tague and Carol 
Yocum, continues a trend by Irvine voters to elect more conservative leaders. 
In June, voters threw out Mayor Larry Agran and his council allies, who 
supported a slate of social, environmental and slow-growth proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Vardoulis promised to cut spending and return Irvine to its more conservative 
past. Vardoulis was on the council between 1976 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The other item on the ballot, Measure F, was passed by more than 2 to 1. The 
measure will move the city's regular elections from June to November. 
</P>
<P>
Measure E's defeat means city officials will be left to grapple with the very 
problem that led to Tuesday's election: how to fill a council seat if a sitting 
council member is elected mayor. The two possible methods of filling the seat 
under Irvine's laws have prompted lawsuits and opinions by judges that the 
city's process probably violates the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan said she will propose a workshop for the public to suggest 
alternatives, such as requiring a council member to resign before running for 
mayor. TOM McQUEENEY

ELECTION TILTS CITY BALANCE OF POWER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The election of two candidates supported by Councilman Robert A. Curtis has 
tilted the balance of power in this South County city, and political observers 
believe that the change may lead to a testy relationship with the city's sole 
developer, the Mission Viejo Co. 
</P>
<P>
The new council members are Sharon Cody, the chairwoman of a citizens' 
committee that opposed the failed effort to recall Curtis, and Robert Breton, 
another Curtis ally. Susan Withrow, an administrative intern with the city of 
Dana Point, also won a seat on the council. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis, a prosecutor with the Riverside County district attorney's office, said 
Wednesday that he was thrilled by the results and that some previous council 
decisions, including the acquisition of a Mission Viejo Co. building for a 
permanent civic center, may be reversed. 
</P>
<P>
"The days of business as usual where the (Mission Viejo Co.) policies went 
unquestioned are over," Curtis said. "The new leadership will have the courage 
to stand up to the Mission Viejo Co. whenever necessary and wisdom to negotiate 
with it whenever possible." 
</P>
<P>
The Mission Viejo Co. was a major financial supporter of the campaign to recall 
Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis is a favorite to be elected mayor when the new council holds its first 
meeting on Nov. 26. "If I am asked to take the job, I will accept and try to 
lead the council into a new era of harmony and effectiveness," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Wetzel, the company's director of corporate affairs, said she did not 
think the election of Curtis' two allies would affect the developer. 
</P>
<P>
"The residents have chosen and we're hoping to work with the new council," 
Wetzel said. "The candidates all pledged to be independent. I would hope that 
they would independently look at each decision and work for the best." Mayor 
Christian W. Keena and Councilwoman Victoria C. Jaffe did not seek reelection. 
Councilman Norman P. Murray, 72, the only incumbent seeking reelection, 
finished eighth in a field of 14 candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Withrow said she is optimistic that the new council will work as a team. "By 
virtue of new blood on the council we'll see a new style of business," she 
said.DAVAN MAHARAJ

Economic growth will likely become the focus of the City Council when two new 
members, who were heavily backed by the Chamber of Commerce, are sworn in later 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
Newcomers Joe Anderson, a former chamber president, and Truman Benedict, a 
retired superintendent of the Capistrano Unified School District, plus 
incumbent Thomas Lorch were elected to four-year terms in Tuesday's election. 
Incumbent Brian J. Rice was defeated, and incumbent Holly Veale did not seek 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson and Benedict ran on a strong pro-business platform and received $1,500 
donations in the campaign's final days from the San Clemente Political Action 
Committee, which is affiliated with the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, the top vote-getter, said his priority will be to attract businesses 
to the city in an attempt to expand its tax base. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been preoccupied with residential development in this city and have 
neglected building up our economic base," he said. "We need to change that 
emphasis somewhat." 
</P>
<P>
Benedict also campaigned for broadening the city's tax base, including building 
light industry and a luxury hotel within its limits. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the voters showed they want growth, but managed growth, and that the 
business community wants greater attention," Benedict said. 
</P>
<P>
Lorch, who did not receive chamber backing, said he hopes he will be able to 
work with Anderson and Benedict, but he fears their election will give the 
chamber too much influence on the council. 
</P>
<P>
"The chamber's PAC gave them a lot of money and is going to expect them to 
listen to them," Lorch said. "Some might say the chamber is going to run this 
city." 
</P>
<P>
Rice blamed his loss on unethical campaigning by his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran a clean campaign, but the people who won were the ones who were the most 
negative," he said. "They also posted their signs illegally all over town. 
Running a clean campaign cost me the election." TERRY SPENCER

STANTON'S AIDE BEATS COUNCIL INCUMBENT

<P>
The city's voters ousted one incumbent and reelected two others after one of 
Santa Ana's most bitter campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Challenger Robert L. Richardson, an aide to county Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, 
decisively defeated one-term incumbent Ron May, a Santa Ana High School 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
May said Richardson's campaign was Stanton's "vendetta" against him. May had 
challenged Stanton in the 1988 supervisor's race and lost. 
</P>
<P>
"I was fighting more than one man in this race. It was too tough," May said. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson, who is also a member of the Santa Ana school board, said his 
campaign had nothing to do with his employment at Stanton's office. Richardson 
polled 44.4% of the votes to May's 37.1%. 
</P>
<P>
"The campaign had more to do with people who wanted leaders in Santa Ana to do 
something to improve the city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson, who will give up his school board seat, will take his oath for a 
four-year term on Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Miguel A. Pulido Jr. survived a brutal race against challenger Coween 
Dickerson, whose barrage of weekend mailers accused him of criminally misusing 
campaign funds and alleged that he had drug connections. 
</P>
<P>
Pulido has filed a $250,000 libel and slander suit against Dickerson. "It was 
one of the most deceitful campaigns run in the history of the city," Pulido 
said. "It was impossible for me to reply to all those allegations and charges 
that were brought about in the weekend." 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson said on election night that she will pursue complaints she has filed 
with the state Fair Political Practices Commission against Pulido, who polled 
52.9% of the votes to Dickerson's 46.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Richards L. Norton narrowly defeated challenger Glenn Mondo, a lawyer 
at one of the county's most prestigious law firms, by 787 votes. 
</P>
<P>
Norton said he plans to file a complaint against Mondo, whose mailers described 
the councilman as "the Puppet Master of Santa Ana." 
</P>
<P>
Mondo said the close count indicates that residents want another 
representative: "Given that I am a relatively unknown candidate, perhaps 
residents are thinking that Mr. Norton is not showing concern with issues that 
are important for the people who live here." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Daniel H. Young easily won over automotive engineer Richard Moser, with 
69% of the vote.LILY ENG

EX-LA HABRA LINEMAN LIVING A DREAM; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: DAN OWENS NOW PLAYS FOR THE DETROIT LIONS. HIS FORMER COACHES SAY HE 
WAS DESTINED FOR STARDOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These are the best of times for Dan Owens. 
</P>
<P>
Owens, a former all-Orange County lineman from La Habra High School and 
four-year starter at USC, is living a childhood dream as a starting defensive 
end for the Detroit Lions in his rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
Owens was the 35th player selected in the NFL draft. He was nicknamed "Big 
Money" by his teammates after reportedly receiving a three-year contract at 
$370,000 per season. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, he married his high school sweetheart, former La Habra cheerleader 
Susie Tannahill. They recently bought a home in Aliso Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Owens broke into the starting lineup in the Lions' second game against the 
Atlanta Falcons and has started four of eight games. 
</P>
<P>
And his future? 
</P>
<P>
"Barring injury or something ridiculous like that, the kid can play in this 
league for 10 years if he wants," Lion Coach Wayne Fontes said. 
</P>
<P>
That's the same kind of thing Owens' coaches have been forecasting since he was 
a standout two-way lineman at La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
Some samples through the years: 
</P>
<P>
* Bob Rau, La Habra coach during Owens' senior season: "I coached three future 
NFL players at Lowell," Rau said. "Dan Owens compares favorably with those 
three (Brent Boyd of the Vikings, Kirk Dodge of the Lions and Dean Barnett of 
the Broncos) at a similar stage in their careers. He has a fine future ahead of 
him." 
</P>
<P>
* Tim Devaney of Sunny Hills, North coach for the 1985 county all-star game: 
"We had to take Dan off the field (during practices), because we couldn't run 
our offensive plays with him on the defensive line. I knew right then he was 
going to be a great college player." 
</P>
<P>
Owens was named the player of the game. 
</P>
<P>
* Kevin Wolthausen, defensive line coach at USC: "I'm not surprised at anything 
Dan Owens does. Dan showed us from the first day he was here that he had all 
the qualities to become a great college player, and he's obviously taken those 
qualities one notch higher to play in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
Coaches say Owens' commitment, work ethic and competitive drive eparate him 
from many other players. Fontes must have known something about those 
attributes when he called to tell Owens he had been picked in the draft's 
second round. 
</P>
<P>
"Like you guys at USC, all we want to do is win," Fontes said. "Do you want to 
be a Detroit Lion?" 
</P>
<P>
"Sure do," said Owens, who has never been long on words. 
</P>
<P>
End of conversation and beginning of an NFL career. 
</P>
<P>
Owens is a gifted athlete who combines size and strength with quickness. He 
weighs 275 pounds, but Fontes says he's the Lions' most agile lineman. 
</P>
<P>
"He moves laterally along the line better than anybody we've got," Fontes said. 
"He has the ability to play left end, right end or even nose guard." 
</P>
<P>
Owens held his own last week against Washington Redskin lineman Jim Lachey. 
After dominating opponents in the Pacific 10, he finds the NFL a real 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost everybody you play against is better, bigger and stronger than you've 
known," Owens said. "In some ways, it's like starting all over again." 
</P>
<P>
It's a familiar feeling for Owens. He redshirted his freshman year at USC but 
broke into the lineup the following year in the team's opener against Illinois. 
He was a fixture on the line for four years. 
</P>
<P>
"My first game was sort of weird, because I hadn't played since my senior year 
in high school," he said. "I was only nervous about messing up." 
</P>
<P>
Owens played in the shadow of USC teammate Tim Ryan for four years, but Ryan 
said he wasn't surprised that he was drafted after Owens, in the third round by 
the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's really an underrated player," Ryan said. "I've seen him do things 
to other guys on film that I haven't seen done to other players. He takes guys 
five yards into the backfield and just throws them." 
</P>
<P>
Owens said playing in the NFL is everything he expected and more. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot different here than playing against 18- and 19-year-old freshmen 
when I first started at USC," he said. "Last Sunday, I was up against Lachey, 
who is one of the best tackles in the NFL. I thought I did OK." 
</P>
<P>
Owens had two sacks, including one that dropped Redskin quarterback Jeff 
Rutledge at his own two-yard line in overtime. But Rutledge completed a 40-yard 
pass on his next play, and that paved the way to a Washington field goal and a 
41-38 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit has struggled to a 3-5 record after winning all four of its exhibition 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a lot of breaks in the preseason that we aren't getting now," Owens 
said. "We could have easily won our games against Tampa Bay, Green Bay and 
Washington. It's a little frustrating after being on a winner at USC for four 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if, while at La Habra, he dared to dream of playing in the NFL, Owens 
said his only goal initially was success in college. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got to USC, I put all my energy into becoming a good college lineman," 
Owens said. "After my junior year, I started thinking, 'I can play in the NFL.' 
</P>
<P>
"My roommate (Brad Leggett) and I would watch NFL games and see all these guys 
we had played with or against in college. I'd see somebody and say to Brad, 
'That guy wasn't really that good, and he's playing in the NFL.' 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I realized what it's all about. Your success depends a lot on 
being the right guy in the right situation . . . being in the right place at 
the right time. 
</P>
<P>
"After playing three years, I should be set financially. I have a good 
opportunity in Detroit. Hopefully, I'll be around for 10 years."

TWO FORCES SPARK A REVIVAL AT BUENA PARK; 
</P>
<P>
PREP FOOTBALL: POWER RUNNING OF BARRIOS, HARD-NOSED COACHING OF LUCZAJ HELP PUT 
COYOTES IN THE PLAYOFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
BUENA PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a league that features such perennially strong teams as Sunny Hills and 
Fullerton, Buena Park rarely has been taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, before this season, the Coyotes had won only one Freeway League game 
since 1983 and had not qualified for the playoffs since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, Buena Park swaggered into the season with a two-fisted 
confidence that caught more than one opponent off guard. The Coyotes stunned La 
Habra, 54-0, in the seventh game and secured a playoff spot with a 28-13 
victory over Troy last Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in recent memory, the Coyotes (5-4, 3-1 in league) are 
ranked in the sportswriters' divisional polls. Tonight, they play Fullerton, 
also 3-1 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Two keys to Buena Park's new-found success are Angel Barrios, a 6-foot-2, 
215-pound junior running back, and Martin Luczaj, the team's first-year coach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE PLAYER 
</P>
<P>
Barrios, a soft-spoken, hard-running 16-year-old with sleepy eyes and 
short-cropped hair, has been a major factor in the Coyotes' turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
He is among Orange County's leaders in rushing (1,030 yards, an 8.9 average) 
and (16 touchdowns). He has run for more than 100 yards in three consecutive 
games, including 211 against Troy and 196 (and three touchdowns) against La 
Habra. 
</P>
<P>
"He's big, strong and fast," Troy Coach John Turek said. "He runs with 
determination and doesn't let one tackler bring him down. He just runs with 
authority." 
</P>
<P>
Lineman Gavin Molinar, one of Barrios' best friends, says: "I love to block for 
him. We're like a pair. When I block for Angel, he does something and that 
motivates me. 
</P>
<P>
"After he has a big run or scores, he always comes back to the huddle and says, 
'Good job, linemen. Good job.' And because he's so modest about it, it makes 
you work that much harder." 
</P>
<P>
"Barrios is a real talent," Luczaj says, "and the kids rally around him just as 
anyone would rally around a talented athlete." 
</P>
<P>
Football isn't the only sport in which Barrios has found success. He also plays 
basketball and, in the same season, plays baseball and runs track. If he 
continues at his current pace, he would be one of the top varsity 
letter-winners in Buena Park history, with nine. 
</P>
<P>
Barrios usually excels at any sport he tries. Recently, Molinar took Barrios to 
play racquetball. Molinar had been playing for about six months; it was 
Barrios' first time. 
</P>
<P>
"Angel beat my socks off," Molinar says. "That's just Angel, though. Every time 
he picks up a ball, he wins." 
</P>
<P>
On the Buena Park campus, the Barrios legend is growing. Some have started 
calling him "Bo," a reference to professional football and baseball player Bo 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
But it hasn't been all touchdown runs and end zone celebrations for Barrios, 
who transferred from Servite to Buena Park after his freshman year. He has 
struggled in the classroom. His parents separated, and he has moved back and 
forth between them. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how he does it," Molinar says. "But he's always there for 
everybody. I think he does it a lot to please his dad. If his dad's happy, then 
Angel is happy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE COACH 
</P>
<P>
If Barrios is one of the instruments that has helped turn around a withering 
program, then Luczaj is the conductor who has orchestrated it all. 
</P>
<P>
These days, he is looking more and more the hero, although if you call looking 
for him at the athletic offices, an assistant coach might answer good-naturedly 
that Luczaj's head is too big to fit indoors these days. 
</P>
<P>
Luczaj admits he likes being in charge. That, he says, is why he left Fullerton 
College and came to Buena Park, where is also athletic director and a physical 
education teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Resuscitating a dying program is not new for Luczaj. He did it at Fullerton 
High School, which had had a 3-17 record in the two seasons before Luczaj 
arrived in 1981. Three years later, Luczaj led the Indians to a Central 
Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
At Buena Park, the change has not come easily, though. "Coming in, I've had to 
be a hard-nosed coach, who instilled discipline," Luczaj said. As he expected, 
the players responded negatively at first. 
</P>
<P>
Not until the Coyotes defeated La Habra did they begin to realize things were 
getting better. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to give up by the middle of (the nonleague games)," Barrios says. 
"At first we didn't believe in him. Now, we believe." 
</P>
<P>
Says Molinar: "We wanted to be better than (Luczaj's) old team, Fullerton. We 
got tired of hearing Fullerton this, Fullerton that. We just wanted to shut him 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Luczaj says some people perceive him as brash and egotistical, and he is not 
without detractors. But the team's play has helped quiet them. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew there was going to be grumblings," Luczaj says. "I don't even hear it 
any more after 17 years coaching in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm older and wiser. I've stopped worrying about what others think. I just try 
to do the best job possible for the kids to help them experience success. What 
others think, I'm not really concerned about. It's high school football and 
sometimes it gets blown out of proportion." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Luczaj believes Buena Park's success on the field speaks volumes. 
</P>
<P>
"For Buena Park to be playing for a spot in the playoffs eight or nine games 
into the season says a lot about what we've been able to accomplish."

When Edison faced Fountain Valley, the game was considered the biggest in the 
county because: 
</P>
<P>
 -- It was for the Sunset League championship. 
</P>
<P>
 -- For the seventh consecutive season, it was played at Anaheim Stadium to 
accommodate the 15,000 fans the game averaged. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It got top billing over the Rams-Miami game on the message board at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Edison was the CIF champion in 1979, Fountain Valley in 1978. Many involved 
in the game would have rather won it than a CIF title. One sportswriter called 
it "The Super Bowl of CIF." 
</P>
<P>
"Winning the CIF title in 1978 was great," Fountain Valley Coach Mike Milner 
said. "But beating Edison is better. I think our game with Edison outdrew the 
CIF finals two years ago." 
</P>
<P>
The best thing was that the game lived up to its billing. Edison won, 15-14, 
with an exciting, almost bizarre, ending. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley opened a 14-0 lead behind the passing of junior quarterback 
Matt Stevens, who wore a towel that said "FV Air Force." 
</P>
<P>
But Edison came back and pulled within one when quarterback Ken Major scored on 
a three-yard run with 15 seconds left. Edison then called the same play to 
score a two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley did not give up. Stevens completed a 61-yard pass to Keith 
Richards as time ran out, moving the ball to the Edison six. A penalty flag was 
thrown because Edison piled on during the tackle. 
</P>
<P>
A game cannot end on a defensive penalty, but official Jim Patterson said: 
</P>
<P>
"The clock had run out when the ball was in the air, and the game ended when 
(Richards) hit the ground." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5 YEARS AGO 
</P>
<P>
The Marina special teams were known for the quality of their play, and for 
their size. 
</P>
<P>
Marina's special teams' players averaged 5-feet-8, 155 pounds, fairly small by 
football standards. 
</P>
<P>
"Westminster was laughing at us on the sidelines," said special teams player 
Dean Loghry. "They were saying, 'Who are these little guys?' " 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the group decided to call itself the Smurf Patrol, after the 
popular cartoon series. It was also an allusion to the diminutive Washington 
Redskin receivers who called themselves the Smurfs. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see them out there, you don't think they can hurt anybody," defensive 
back Sean Barbosa said. "But they put some good licks on people."

Apparently. Marina opponents averaged just 13.5 yards per kickoff return, with 
a longest of 38, as the Vikings went 6-3-1, 4-1 in the Sunset League. 
</P>
<P>
The players weren't chosen because of their (lack of) size. It just worked out 
that way because Coach Dave Thompson believed in using players who didn't start 
on offense or defense for his special teams. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a good place for a kid to get on the field," Thompson said. "If he's a 
junior, he'll get a lot of hits and gain a lot of confidence. If he's a senior, 
he'll at least feel like he's contributed to the team." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
1 YEAR AGO 
</P>
<P>
Running it up: Rancho Alamitos' Dana Riddle gained 144 yards in 34 carries to 
end the regular season with 2,082 yards, the fourth-highest total in county 
history behind Servite's Derek Brown (2,301, 1988), Edison's Kerwin Bell 
(2,226, 1979) and Valencia's Ray Pallares (2,085, 1985). 
</P>
<P>
Tough ticket: As expected, Capistrano Valley's stadium was packed for the 
showdown between top-ranked El Toro and No. 2 Capistrano Valley. Fans began to 
fill the stadium at 5 p.m., and the 3,500 bleacher seats were taken by 6. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Mission Viejo Mayor William Craycraft how hot a ticket it was. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Craycraft had telephoned Capistrano Valley Principal Tom 
Anthony and asked if Anthony could reserve a couple of seats and a parking 
space at the school for his family. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony politely declined. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor missed a good game. Capistrano Valley won, 22-21.

IRVINE CO. PLANS MAJOR PROJECT CUTS, LAYOFFS; 
</P>
<P>
DOWNTURN: THE DEVELOPER BLAMES THE ACTION ON A CASH-FLOW CRUNCH CAUSED BY THE 
CREDIT RESTRICTIONS FEDERAL REGULATORS HAVE IMPOSED ON BANKS AND SAVINGS AND 
LOANS.

<P>
The Irvine Co., the big Orange County developer, said Wednesday that it will 
dramatically curtail new projects and lay off about 11% of its work force as 
its prepares for a lengthy economic downturn. 
</P>
<P>
The action by Orange County's premier developer underscores the mounting 
problems of the real estate industry in Southern California, which is being 
hurt by a slumping economy and financing difficulties related to bank and 
thrift problems. 
</P>
<P>
The giant land company, owner of one-sixth of Orange County, blamed the layoffs 
-- 40 of its 370 workers -- and its need to slash expenditures on a cash-flow 
crunch caused by the "onerous credit restrictions" federal regulators have 
imposed on banks and savings and loans. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. is dependent on land sales to builders to finance ongoing 
activities, and the national credit crunch has made it difficult for builders 
to find financing, company officials said in a memo circulated to employees 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The savings and loan debacle has led to severe constraints on financing for 
new construction," the company said in the statements signed by Irvine Co. Vice 
Chairman John M. Galvin, Executive Vice President William H. McFarland and 
Senior Vice President Gary H. Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
"As a consequence, many of us are witnessing the most difficult time in memory 
in the relationship between the real estate and the banking industry. As we 
look into the future . . . the prospects for a continued strong real estate 
market are slim." 
</P>
<P>
The memo announcing the layoffs and reduction in new activity said the company 
still is "very much in business" and doesn't plan to shut down ongoing projects 
-- which include the Irvine Spectrum, a 2,600-acre commercial and industrial 
park, and four major residential communities ultimately planned for more than 
30,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
The size of the layoffs were mitigated because the company went through a major 
restructuring from 1986 through 1988 in which more than 1,000 employees were 
slashed from the payroll. 
</P>
<P>
The company then shed its active involvement in land development and became 
what owner and Chairman Donald L. Bren has referred to as an "executive 
developer." In that role, the company is a landowner, planner and investor. It 
plans entire communities and then sells the residential land and sells or 
leases the commercial property to other developers. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co.'s latest layoffs will hit hardest in the company's finance and 
land-planning units, company spokesman Larry Thomas said. Most of those to be 
laid off will receive notices Friday, he said, and will be given several months 
of severance pay as well as job placement assistance. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co.'s layoffs are minor contrasted with others occurring in the real 
estate and development industries over the past six months. In Orange County 
alone, more than 1,000 construction workers have lost jobs in the past two 
months. Industry insiders say most builders have been quietly laying off both 
construction workers and administrative and financial personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The action by the Irvine Co. did not come as a surprise to real estate experts. 
The memo announcing the cutbacks "pretty much says it all," Alfred Gobar, a 
real estate industry consultant, said. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the Irvine Co. only sells lots and doesn't build homes, it is dependent 
on home builders, and since home builders can't get financing to buy land, they 
are in a crunch. They are at the bottom of the food chain," Gobar said, "and 
the food chain has been interrupted by the federal government and its 
regulation of the banking industry." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas declined to identify specific proposed projects that would be delayed 
under the new economic plan but said they would mainly be income-producing 
projects including apartments, industrial parks, office buildings and retail 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
But he said development of the high-profile Newport Coast residential-resort 
project on the last major stretch of raw coastal land in the county should not 
be affected because most of the residential acreage already has been sold to 
developers and has cleared escrow. 
</P>
<P>
Any delays in the project, which is to include two golf courses, three hotels, 
2,600 homes and 7,200 acres of open space, would be the decision of an 
individual development firm. 
</P>
<P>
The company retains title to most of the income-producing property on its vast 
64,000-acre holding and has more than 125 separate income properties, including 
the lucrative Newport Center office complex and its Fashion Island mall. 
</P>
<P>
Major projects now under way include: 
</P>
<P>
* The 9,400-acre Newport Coast, where the first lots for custom homes are now 
scheduled to go on sale early next year. 
</P>
<P>
* The new 2,600-unit Westpark II planned community approved last week by the 
city of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
* Tustin Ranch. About 9,000 homes are planned on the 1,740-acre parcel between 
Tustin and East Orange, and about 1,500 have already been built. 
</P>
<P>
* East Orange. Planning is still in process on the 7,000 acres the company owns 
in the hills just east of Orange. The company wants to build as many as 12,350 
homes and several small retail and commercial projects. Construction isn't 
expected to begin until 1993, and company officials say they hope the current 
economic crunch has ended by then. 
</P>
<P>
* Anaheim Canyon. A total of 7,900 homes are proposed for several thousand 
acres in the canyons east of Anaheim. An environmental impact report was 
recently filed with the city. Construction is several years away. 
</P>
<P>
* Irvine Spectrum. The 2,600-acre project, billed by the company as the world's 
largest business park, is about two-thirds completed. The company has sold some 
of the land and leased other parcels. A major regional shopping mall is 
proposed for the project, but the company has been hard-pressed to find major 
tenants and admits that construction is a long way off.

JURY GIVES BROKER $6-MILLION CUT OF FLUOR COMMISSION 
</P>

After three days of deliberation, an Orange County Superior Court jury 
Wednesday awarded a local brokerage at least $6 million as a commission for its 
role in the 1985 sale of Fluor Corp. headquarters to a Texas developer. 
</P>
<P>
The jury ruled in favor of Lee &amp; Associates in the closely watched, 
5-year-old lawsuit filed against Fluor Corp., the large Irvine-based 
engineering and construction firm, and Trammell Crow Co., the Dallas-based 
office builder. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Marvin G. Weeks said Wednesday that the jury found that 
some of the defendants had interfered with Lee with "fraud, malice and 
oppression" by depriving the broker of a sale's commission. The finding of 
fraud allows the firm to make a claim for punitive damages, which could amount 
to an award of millions more. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing on the awarding of punitive damages will begin today before Weeks and 
the same jury. The arguments will likely include information on the net worth 
of Trammell Crow, one of the nation's largest commercial developers and 
building managers. 
</P>
<P>
Lee was seeking a $9-million commission. It was unclear Wednesday whether 
interest would be paid on the jury award, but sources close to the case said 
the final award would be closer to $8.2 million than $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys and parties on both sides of the case refused to comment late 
Wednesday on the jury verdict. They noted that Weeks had previously warned the 
parties involved in the contentious battle about talking to the press until the 
case is concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The civil case, which went to trial in late July and continued intermittently 
until Friday, drew widespread attention because of the corporate names 
involved, the large sums of money at stake and the complex issues in question. 
</P>
<P>
The jury began deliberations Monday in the complicated case. They were asked to 
decide between two versions of the huge deal so divergent that the lawyers at 
times seemed to be describing two different transactions. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said Fluor executives had agreed to pay the brokerage a $9-million 
commission, or 3% of the $300-million deal. Instead, Lee said, Fluor stood by 
while Trammell Crow executives cut Lee out and took a $5-million commission for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
When Lee protested, the brokerage said, Fluor did nothing, and Trammell Crow 
offered the brokerage $2.5 million to drop its claim while threatening to 
prolong any lawsuit for years. 
</P>
<P>
Lee admitted that there were no written contracts with Fluor that specifically 
mention the sale of the building. But, the brokerage said, it did have an oral 
agreement with Fluor. 
</P>
<P>
Trammell Crow, on the other hand, said two Lee brokers visited the developer's 
offices in 1984 and promoted a deal without Fluor's knowledge. Trammell Crow 
was interested but asked to negotiate directly with Fluor. When the deal 
closed, Trammell Crow offered Lee a $2.5-million commission. 
</P>
<P>
But when Fluor learned that Lee was seeking a commission, it denied it had any 
agreement with Lee. Trammell Crow withdrew the $2.5-million offer and Lee filed 
suit. Trammell Crow alleged Lee hoped to collect a "windfall" for doing 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
While such suits are still far from common, they are increasing in Southern 
California. For that reason -- as well as the size and prestige of the 
litigants -- this case was watched closely by the local brokerage industry.

Texas Instruments Delivers Advanced Chips: The company said it has begun 
providing selected customers with sample quantities of advanced memory chips 
that can store more than 16 million bits of data. That's four times the 
capacity of the most advanced chips available in larger quantities from chip 
makers. The Dallas-based firm said it expects to be among the leaders in 
supplying low-volume shipments of the 16-megabit chips, possibly by late next 
year.

SOVIETS SEE COUNTY AS LAND OF OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE THEIR ECONOMY

As Soviet officials surveyed a 725-acre state-of-the-art landfill site at Bee 
Canyon one recent morning, Alexandre A. Nesterov took a deep breath and smiled. 
The landfill, bordered by lush hillsides and orange groves, offered a stark 
contrast to the disarray and stench of most Soviet dump sites. 
</P>
<P>
The air is clean, Nesterov noted, and "the ambience is beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
The Moscow mechanical engineer is one of a growing number of Soviet technicians 
and business people who are flocking to this country to look for better ways of 
doing things -- battling air pollution, manufacturing more reliable computers 
or improving the quality of medical care. 
</P>
<P>
This flood of Soviet visitors is reflected in the record number of 
non-immigrant visas that have been issued to Soviet citizens this year. The 
federal government issued 103,000 non-immigrant visas in the fiscal year that 
ended Sept. 30, up from 59,673 last year, according to State Department 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
These Soviet delegations usually visit Los Angeles, New York and other major 
metropolitan centers, but Orange County has also seen a big increase in Soviet 
visitors in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
A group of Soviet hoteliers toured the county last week, and two trade 
delegations representing Soviet environmental and medical technology interests 
were making the rounds early this week. On Saturday, another Soviet delegation 
of medical and health care officials is arriving with the objective of forming 
a joint venture with local companies. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Lentz, executive director of the World Trade Center Assn. of Orange 
County, has never seen so many Soviet trade groups before. She said only one or 
two Soviet groups have visited the county during the five years that she has 
been active with the association. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet government's move toward a free-market economy has forced Soviet 
companies to compete with less government help. It has also fostered 
entrepreneurship and encouraged Soviet enterprises to strike their own overseas 
deals. And an easing of U.S. visa requirements has made it easier for Soviet 
citizens to travel abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago, it was impossible for me to come to the United States because I 
could not get a visa," said Vladimir Fishelev, president of Systempribor Inc., 
a Moscow electronics company. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets "are trying to turn their economy around, and they realize they 
can't do it themselves," said Michael Liikala, director of the Commerce 
Department's Bureau of Export Administration's office in Newport Beach. "I'm 
sure they have delegations all over Europe, but I'm sure also that the Soviets 
have respect for American technology and management expertise. That's why 
they're here." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Disneyland, Soviet officials say, the county is an attractive 
destination because of its concentration of computer, medical technology, 
pharmaceutical and environmental products companies. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials say they are coming to the United States to learn about 
Western management and marketing practices and to acquire manufacturing 
know-how. They are seeking U.S. partners for manufacturing ventures in the 
Soviet Union and American firms interested in distributing Soviet products in 
this country. 
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. companies, such as medical equipment maker Beckman Instruments in 
Fullerton, have gone out of their way to forge ties with Soviet companies. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Beckman hosted a Soviet medical delegation, which resulted in a 
$2-million sale of clinical systems to 11 diagnostic centers in the Soviet 
Union. The company is hoping for future orders as the Soviets modernize their 
health-care system. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Beckman has hosted three Soviet delegations, including one from 
Siberia that has indicated it will purchase clinical analyzers worth at least 
$1 million, said Robert Crittendon, a Beckman spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a transition from the importance of the central government to 
the various republics in the U.S.S.R.," he said. "We're developing relations 
with various regions and republics." In 1988, the Fullerton firm opened a trade 
office in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Some companies have found that it's not always necessary to invite a large 
delegation of Soviet visitors to foster business ties. Sometimes it's more 
important whom you invite. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, an Anaheim division of Minneapolis-based Medtronic Inc. hosted the 
head of the Bakulev Institute of Cardiovascular Surgery in Moscow. That visit 
resulted in a $6-million order for Medtronic's Maxima blood oxygenators in May. 
</P>
<P>
Liikala, the Commerce Department official, cautions that U.S. companies be 
selective about the Soviet officials with whom they negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not clear what authority these various Soviet representatives carry 
because now you have the republics and city officials suggesting they'd run 
their own economies," he said. "And then you've got the central government 
officials saying that they run the economy and can provide the commitment to 
make the deals work." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials hope that gaining business expertise from abroad will help the 
nation rebuild its badly struggling economy, said James F. Bauer, vice 
president of Science Solutions Inc., a San Diego company that helped organize 
the Soviet group's visit to the Irvine landfill and other local sites. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect more delegations to come in the years ahead as U.S. and Soviet 
relations warm up," he said, adding that he expects Soviet delegations to 
someday be as "common as those from China."

WELLS FARGO CARVES OFF RETAIL DIVISION FOR ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>

<P>
Wells Fargo Bank said Wednesday that it has created new retail divisions in 
Orange and San Diego counties, carving up its huge Los Angeles-based Southern 
California division in an effort to decentralize operations and improve 
customer service. 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring is part of a statewide plan that will give California's 
third-largest commercial bank seven divisions to coordinate 558 branches, once 
it completes the acquisition of 92 offices of troubled Great American Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The new Orange County retail division, with headquarters in Irvine, will 
oversee 70 branches -- 37 Wells Fargo offices in Orange County, 21 Wells Fargo 
branches in southern and eastern Los Angeles County and 12 Great American 
offices in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Six more branches will be added to the Irvine division at the end of the year, 
when Wells Fargo's acquisition of Citizens Holdings in Anaheim is expected to 
be completed. Citizens owns Citizens Bank of Costa Mesa and El Camino Bank in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Vice President Larry Crabtree, 42, a graduate of Cal State Long Beach 
with a degree in criminal justice, will manage the division. He joined Wells 
Fargo as a branch manager in 1983 after serving 13 years on the Downey and Los 
Angeles police forces and, later, as the head of his own security company. 
</P>
<P>
At Wells Fargo, Crabtree has managed four branches and four districts in the 
Los Angeles area, including most recently the Wilshire district, which covers 
West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo appointed Senior Vice President Drew Tanzman, 33, to manage the San 
Diego division, which will have 77 offices, and Executive Vice President Lois 
Rice, 50, as head of the 85-branch Los Angeles division. 
</P>
<P>
"We're giving each division a manageable number of branches because we don't 
want the division heads out of touch with district managers and branch 
operations," said Kathleen Shilkret, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman. "This 
emphasizes our renewed importance on the retail side of the bank." 
</P>
<P>
Retail banking is aimed at providing such financial services as checking 
accounts and auto loans to the general public. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo has agreed to buy Great American and its 130 branches. It hopes to 
acquire 92 Great American branches in Orange, San Diego and Riverside counties 
by Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, Wells Fargo had three divisions -- Northern, Central and Southern 
California -- but its recent growth through acquisitions has forced it to 
realign its branch network, Shilkret said.

pleaded guilty Wednesday in federal court here to charges of embezzling about 
$1.2 million from the institution. 
</P>
<P>
In the plea agreement, Darrell Dean Knox, 46, of Fallbrook admitted that he 
engaged in conspiracy and bank fraud by concocting a scheme to cash more than 
200 checks from Sterling Builders Inc., the thrift's real estate division. 
</P>
<P>
Three other individuals -- Richard Russell, 44, of Murietta; Allen Zane 
Frazier, 38, of Midland Tex.; and Daniel Day O'Brien, 39, of Fontana -- were 
indicted in the Sterling case in September and are scheduled to stand trial 
Nov. 20. 
</P>
<P>
"Monies were embezzled from Sterling Builders and laundered through banks in 
Texas and California and then sent around in a great loop that began with Knox 
and ended with Knox with each of his co-defendants taking a share of the 
proceeds along the way," said Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven E. Zipperstein in 
a proceeding before U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts. 
</P>
<P>
Knox, who was controller of Sterling Builders in 1988, issued checks to 
fictitious entities and then had friends assist him in laundering the money 
through several bank accounts. Sometimes he forged the endorsement signatures 
on checks made out to Sterling Builders contractors and then deposited those 
checks into bank accounts he or the three remaining defendants controlled, the 
indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
Knox continued embezzling after he was fired by Sterling, using 23 blank checks 
he stole from the thrift's subsidiary and making them out to himself on a 
periodic basis. Those stolen checks accounted for about $200,000 of the 
$1.2-million scheme. 
</P>
<P>
He could receive as much as 15 years in jail and be fined $750,000, though new 
federal sentencing guidelines indicate he will most likely receive somewhere 
between three and five years in jail and would not be eligible for parole. He 
is scheduled to be sentenced on March 7. 
</P>
<P>
Knox was indicted in September on 16 counts of bank fraud, conspiracy, money 
laundering and interstate transportation of stolen property. Under the plea 
agreement, he admitted guilt on two conspiracy counts and one bank fraud count. 
</P>
<P>
Zipperstein refused to say whether Knox was cooperating with federal 
authorities in the cases against his former associates, who have all pleaded 
not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Knox was hired by Sterling Builders in 1986 as a computer consultant and 
promoted to controller in January, 1988. He was fired by the end of that year 
because he "had fallen behind in his work and was not cooperating with SBI's 
outside auditors," according to an affidavit filed in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling Savings discovered the scheme early this year after making a routine 
call to a supplier to confirm that he had gotten paid. The supplier said he 
hadn't received a check and hadn't done any work for the thrift or its 
subsidiaries in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Knox, wanted for months by the FBI, was arrested outside Denver on Sept. 5 with 
a loaded revolver in his car and clips of spare ammunition. He was living there 
under the alias of Darrell McCormick. 
</P>
<P>
Holtby was arrested in the same area that day and the FBI said he was carrying 
a .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol and a 16-inch machete in his car.

FLIGHT ON RESTORED B-17 IS A JOURNEY TO THE PAST

<P>
The air in the radio compartment throbs angrily and the tentative shudder of 
the fuselage at low revolutions becomes a shake and then a wild cacophony of 
rattles and growls and blasting roars as, on the other side of the bomb bay, 
David Tallichet presses the four throttles forward. The old plane strains 
against the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Tallichet releases the pressure on the rudder pedals and Number 
44-83546 begins its takeoff run, rapidly accelerating toward the hills in the 
west. Still ground-bound, the plane continues to buffet and wind begins to howl 
through the open hatch above the radio compartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, almost imperceptibly, we are airborne, and Tallichet begins the slow 
climb out of Chino Airport. It is an exalting sight to look backward out of the 
hatch, down the fuselage and past the tail and see the dairy farms recede in 
the crackling air as Number 44-83546 thunders into the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Below, on the roads, brake lights wink on and cars slow as the drivers see the 
great green ghost rising. It is an awesome object, out of place and time, and 
it leaves an indelible print on the mind's eye. 
</P>
<P>
 The eyes below squint to see the writing on the nose, beneath the gun. Does it 
really say "Memphis Belle?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It was a visit to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington in the 
early 1960s, along with some encouragement from another collector, that did it, 
Tallichet says. 
</P>
<P>
"I left Washington excited," he says. "I said, by God, that's what I'm going to 
do. I'm going to collect airplanes." 
</P>
<P>
Tallichet had the means to do it, and the flying background. He flew 21 
missions over occupied Europe in early 1945 as the co-pilot of a B-17 Flying 
Fortress heavy bomber. After the war he remained on active Air Force reserve 
status until 1957, flying a variety of aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1958, after a dissatisfying stint as a supply officer, he went on 
inactive status and opened his first restaurant, the Reef in Long Beach. It was 
the first of what would become a nationwide network of restaurants operated by 
Anaheim-based Specialty Restaurants Corp., of which Tallichet is today 
president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
As the money came in from the successful restaurant business, Tallichet and his 
partner at the time bought a pair of vintage planes, a Stearman and a T-34. 
Shortly after, Tallichet bought his first P-51 Mustang fighter for $13,000 and 
the promise of extensive spare parts that could be sold to pay off the loan. 
The seller skipped with the parts, leaving Tallichet to pick up the tab. Today, 
he said, he still has the restored P-51, which is now worth about $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
After his Smithsonian visit, Tallichet began collecting and swapping planes 
throughout the world with the elan of a horse trader. He created the 
Chino-based Military Aircraft Restoration Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of 
Specialty Restaurants, specifically to handle the traffic in vintage military 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"In relation to today," he says, "the planes were quite cheap and business was 
good, and I made quite a few trips" to places like New Guinea, the Yukon 
territory of British Columbia, India -- all to buy or sell old airplanes. He 
has owned, bought, traded or restored -- and, for the most part, flown -- such 
historical craft as B-25 Mitchell bombers, Korean-era MiG jets, P-40 Tomahawk 
fighters, F4U Corsairs, even giant B-29 bombers. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the 68-year-old Orange resident, through his company, owns about 100 
planes in various stages of restoration, most of which are World War II vintage 
military aircraft. The majority of the collection is at Chino Airport. Between 
30 and 40 of them, he says, are fully airworthy. By any yardstick, it is an 
impressive collection. 
</P>
<P>
But, Tallichet says, none of the planes have gotten quite the amount of 
attention that Number 44-83546 has received in the past couple of months. It is 
a fully restored B-17G heavy bomber -- and Tallichet flew it during the filming 
of the current film "Memphis Belle." 
</P>
<P>
The plane played the title role. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-six years ago, combat pilots loved this plane. It was easy to handle. It 
was forgiving. It was tough. Some called it a tank with wings. Dozens of them 
got shot to pieces in the ferocious battles over Europe and still flew their 
crews home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an easy, gentle, sweet airplane to fly," Tallichet says. "You'd have to 
have a lot of bad luck or stupidity or both to hurt yourself in a B-17." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was built for function, purely. Creature comforts in this restored 
model are few. To walk from the radio room amidships to the cockpit, one must 
traverse the bomb bay on a catwalk barely the width of one's shoe. 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond the darkness of the bomb bay is the brilliance of the cockpit, 
where Tallichet watches the gauges as the plane makes a left climbing bank. The 
whirling propellers are only inches away, but it is less noisy here because the 
engines are now behind us and no wind rushes in. It is perfect flying weather 
and the sun floods in. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is not the sort of flying that commercial airline passengers are 
used to. The four huge, 1,200-horsepower Wright Cyclone engines vibrate every 
inch of the airframe, and the cabin is not pressurized. There are sudden and 
unexpected small surges in altitude that force the knees to bend if one is 
standing up and it makes crawling under the cockpit and into the nose a 
stop-and-go task. 
</P>
<P>
 But the nose holds several revelations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tallichet acquired his B-17 the same way he got many of his planes: though a 
series of sales, deals, horse trades, some coincidental, some intentional. The 
brief version holds that Tallichet acquired and restored an Air Force B-29 
bomber and the Air Force, in return, gave him a huge C-123 transport, which he 
then traded to a firefighting company for a B-17 they were using as a plane to 
drop water and chemicals on forest fires. 
</P>
<P>
He began to scour the world for parts: a top turret, a ball turret, war surplus 
radio gear, bomb bay doors, a Norden bombsight. Everything it would take to 
restore the plane to its wartime configuration. That was eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Several months later, Catherine Wyler, daughter of the filmmaker William Wyler, 
began to piece together a plan for a fictionalized film based on her father's 
widely seen wartime documentary film about the combat career of the real 
Memphis Belle and her crew. As the production began to take shape and the 
search began for airworthy B-17s -- there are only a handful left in the world 
-- Catherine Wyler called on her uncle, David Tallichet. 
</P>
<P>
"She knew her uncle had gone through many years of his life and never found 
that hero status he wanted, being kind of a nobody in the war," Tallichet says. 
"So she said, 'Would you like to fly in my movie?' And I said, 'You bet I 
would.' " 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Tallichet flew his B-17 to England, where it was modified and 
painted to resemble the real Memphis Belle. (The real Memphis Belle is today 
restored as a static exhibit in Memphis.) 
</P>
<P>
Robert Morgan, the pilot of the original Memphis Belle, made a flight at the 
controls of Tallichet's version of the plane while in England to observe the 
filming, his first flight in a B-17 since the war. A studio press release 
quotes Morgan as saying at the time that the flight "was like five Christmases 
all on the same day." 
</P>
<P>
The nose, like everyplace else in the plane, is cramped, but it doesn't feel 
that way, at least not on the bombardier's seat. The seat is a small, padded 
swivel chair and it is at the very tip of the nose, just behind the Plexiglas 
bubble and the black metal Norden bombsight. The view of the ground is 
unimpeded and panoramic. It is like being hurled through space independent of 
engines, airplanes, physics. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the sort of view -- and feeling -- you get when you fly in your dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 It is even quieter here, farther forward of the engines, in the area airmen 
called the greenhouse. Still, it's not difficult to visualize what a terrifying 
place it could have been while flying through fields of greasy flak or head-on 
fighter attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 On this flight, however, there is nothing but bright sun and the comforting 
sight, just out of the tiny side windows, of the giant engines drumming away 
relentlessly. It is very easy to fall in love with this airplane. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How much does it cost to keep a B-17? That depends, Tallichet says, on whether 
it works. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going good until you lose an engine," he says. "That'll cost you 30 
grand." 
</P>
<P>
And the parts are out there, somewhere, "in a garage, in a back yard. 
Someplace, somebody has the part if you have the money to pay for it," 
Tallichet says. 
</P>
<P>
The aviation fuel the plane gulps by the hundreds of gallons usually is paid 
for by those who hire Tallichet to fly the plane at air shows and other 
aviation events. 
</P>
<P>
He says he doesn't know what his B-17 is worth, and he doesn't want to sell it. 
But, he says, the last airworthy B-17 sold in the United States probably went 
for between $400,000 and $500,000 two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The modern version of the Memphis Belle has kept Tallichet's Military Aircraft 
Restoration Corp. out of the red for the first time in its history, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost money every year but last year," he says. "That's when they made 
'Memphis Belle.' The money we got from that gave us our first profitable year." 
</P>
<P>
Tallichet jokingly calls his passion for planes "an idiot's hobby." But for the 
man who says he never saw a propeller-driven fighter from the pilot's seat of a 
bomber until the filming of "Memphis Belle," it is an enterprise that keeps him 
young. 
</P>
<P>
"You fly it for the challenge, I think," he says. "I'm 68, and it's kind of fun 
to be flying in 1990 when most of my colleagues have long ago given up flying." 
</P>
<P>
The wind and the prop blast rush into the waist ports and over the mock-up 
.50-caliber guns, and the muscles in the thighs work harder to keep the body 
standing as Tallichet makes a final long, lazy bank to set up his final 
approach. The wind, the gently changing view out the open window, the pounding 
of the engines, the gold of the setting sun, all combine to become achingly 
exhilarating. 
</P>
<P>
 The wheels ($1,350 each) screech quickly on the runway and Tallichet turns the 
giant plane onto a taxiway. The propellers immediately raise a huge cloud of 
dark brown dust from the adjacent dirt infield. Out on the ramp, knots of 
people stand and stare, still transfixed, at this apparition from the past that 
comes thundering slowly toward them. It is too loud, too insistent, too 
overpowering to be a ghost. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is almost too wonderful to be real. 
</P>

<P>
The changes in her country have been "tremendous," and in some ways quite 
astonishing. 
</P>
<P>
"I began to feel I would never live to see the African National Congress 
unbanned," said Nadine Gordimer, the novelist who has been called the 
conscience of South Africa, on a recent visit here. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I would never live to see (Nelson) Mandela and the other leaders out 
of prison." 
</P>
<P>
Since adolescence Gordimer has been an outspoken foe of the white South African 
government and its systematic repression of blacks, by far the majority of its 
population. With an increasingly angry yet always eloquent voice, her seven 
collections of short stories and 10 novels have scrupulously documented the 
human side of her country's racial injustice. 
</P>
<P>
If fellow South African novelist Alan Paton's works have given the world an 
almost progressive view of the country, Gordimer's books have seethed rage. On 
the subject of racial separation, Gordimer has no use for gentleness. Her most 
recent novel, "My Son's Story" (published this month by Farrar, Straus &amp; 
Giroux), begins when the son of a "colored" activist discovers that his father 
is seeing a white woman. 
</P>
<P>
Gordimer read a short story, "Home," to an audience of Harvard University 
students on a recent visit here. When she finished reading, the audience sat, 
immobilized. Her tale of racial tension had captivated them to the point of 
silence. No one would speak. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess there's nothing else to say," Michael Blumenthal, chairman of the 
school's creative writing program, finally said. 
</P>
<P>
One day later, Gordimer sat in the living room of her old friend Harry Levin, a 
retired professor of literature at Harvard. She is 66 years old, small and 
delicate, almost birdlike, with hair that is perfectly white. 
</P>
<P>
Gordimer is gracious, but keeps a cool distance. The daughter of a Lithuanian 
immigrant watchmaker and his British wife, Gordimer exudes a sense of quiet 
impatience. She has little time -- and less inclination -- for small talk. 
</P>
<P>
For her, the urgency of South Africa cannot be underestimated. To that end, she 
all but dismisses questions about literature and directs the discussion toward 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
She would concede that, at least on the surface, South African president F. W. 
de Klerk has made strides toward racial justice. 
</P>
<P>
"He has gone farther than anyone else," Gordimer said. "But people have to 
understand that the basic underpinnings of apartheid are still there." 
</P>
<P>
As an example she cites the popular registration act, "which says what color 
you are when you born marks you for life. It's still there," Gordimer said. 
</P>
<P>
"The two acts that deprived blacks of their right to own land are still there," 
she said. "Nominally, schools are supposed to be open to people of all colors 
-- but this depends on the wishes of the majority of parents, so this is not 
really open education to all." 
</P>
<P>
While many people outside South Africa laud the developments there, many, many 
problems remain, she said. "De Klerk reassures everyone in this country by 
saying the end of apartheid is irreversible; it is here. But the ANC, people 
like Mandela and me, say it is not irreversible. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be pegged at the level that it is now," she said. "And that would not 
be the end of apartheid." 
</P>
<P>
Imprisoned for 27 years, liberation leader Nelson Mandela was De Klerk's "trump 
card," Gordimer said. Mandela's release earlier this year was De Klerk's most 
dramatic gesture toward black South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The event brought jubilation but also some concerns. With Mandela, Gordimer 
said, "of course there was always a question mark. After you have been in jail 
for over 27 years, and are over 70 years old, there was a question if he would 
be up to it all." 
</P>
<P>
As it happened, Mandela was up to it, "and more." Gordimer offered a slight 
smile. "One begins to wish that some other politicians could go to prison for 
27 years, if they could turn out like that." 
</P>
<P>
For Mandela "is not just intelligent and honest, he is -- and one doesn't use 
this word very often -- he is a wise man," Gordimer said. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela became an instant symbol of change and hope for South Africa. On a 
visit to the United States in August, he was greeted with near-adulation. 
</P>
<P>
But Gordimer cautioned that Mandela's ecstatic reception here must be viewed 
with some cynicism. 
</P>
<P>
"The ticker tape is not enough," she said. "That gets swept away the next 
morning. The ANC needs strong financial support." 
</P>
<P>
Gordimer signed up as a member of Mandela's party, the African National 
Congress, almost the moment that it was unbanned and recognized as an official 
political organization in South Africa. It was the first political party she 
had ever joined. 
</P>
<P>
Gordimer gave another small smile. "I'm happy to be a card-carrying member of 
the ANC," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She warns that progress toward racial equality in South Africa is also 
threatened by right-wing opponents of the De Klerk government. "At a 
conservative estimate, 90% of the political base does not support De Klerk and 
does not support constitutional debate, but does support the right-wing 
breakaway party," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For a time, "it was easy to dismiss them as a bunch of cranks wanting to turn 
back the clock," Gordimer said. "But now we have to accept that they are 
dangerous and have to be dealt with." 
</P>
<P>
The precariousness of the situation in South Africa is not widely understood 
outside that country, Gordimer said. "Somehow, the outside world expected that 
once Mandela was out of jail, everything would be all right," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"But what power has Mandela got?" Her voice rose in indignation. "He hasn't 
even got a vote! He is a world statesman and he hasn't got a vote. What an 
extraordinary position." 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, Mandela called Gordimer to seek advice about publishing his 
autobiography. Their meeting spawned rumors that Gordimer would write it for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
The rumors are nonsense, she said. Beyond briefing him on the workings of the 
publishing industry, she has no involvement in the writing of Mandela's 
autobiography. "I told him, 'you are a great statesman, but you don't know 
anything about publishing.' 
</P>
<P>
"What could happen to you as a writer?" she said she asked Mandela. "You could 
be banned, and I am three times banned. But no writer in South Africa was put 
in prison" for writing. 
</P>
<P>
Three of Gordimer's own books have been banned in South Africa for as long as 
12 years. In 1979, her novel "Burger's Daughter" was seized in South African 
bookstores and blasted by the government as "a full-scale attack against the 
Republic." 
</P>
<P>
But since Gordimer has seen many of her political friends imprisoned or exiled, 
the government's actions against her seemed relatively minor. 
</P>
<P>
She shrugs at the notion that writing books that offend the Establishment is in 
any way courageous. "If I have had any courage -- and I am aware that it is 
never enough -- it is for the way I have lived my life, and not for what I have 
written," Gordimer said. 
</P>
<P>
But her writing has served her in her political activism in South Africa. "As I 
became known through my writing, then I would always be asked political 
questions," she said. "I really felt it was my opportunity" to speak out. 
</P>
<P>
"So many people were banned," Gordimer said. "Blacks had no opportunity to 
speak out. So I had a responsibility to speak out. I could not not have done 
it. I could not have had any self-respect as a white person living there." 
</P>
<P>
Gordimer has also put her principles into action as a founder of the Congress 
of South African Writers, which has about 5,000 members scattered around that 
country, she said. COSAW is closely allied with the ANC and most of its members 
are black. 
</P>
<P>
"We have tremendous problems because so many people who want to write, they 
have the talent and the imagination, but are so poorly educated that they don't 
have the words," Gordimer said. COSAW brings "suitcase libraries" to aspiring 
black writers in the countryside. It offers encouragement and education, even 
providing typewriters -- a luxury for many who would choose to write. 
</P>
<P>
"There's such a lot of talent among black writers in South Africa," Gordimer 
said. "But it is so hard to get them published." 
</P>
<P>
If there is any praise to be given, Gordimer said she will accept some 
recognition for what she has done to help foster liberation in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"But not as a writer," she insisted. "As a writer, I'm just doing what I know 
how to do."

ARTS OFFICIALS TAKE CRITICS' ELECTION VICTORIES IN STRIDE

The arts couldn't have been too high on the minds of voters who gave a 
comfortable victory Tuesday to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach), a key foe 
of federal arts funding whose district includes parts of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Local arts officials, commenting on this and other races pertinent to their 
communities, were neither surprised nor devastated by Rohrabacher's triumph, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course I'm disappointed that some of the most repressive voices seem not to 
have been silenced by the recent election," said Charles Desmarais, director of 
the Laguna Art Museum and president of the Committee for an Orange County Arts 
Council, a group working to establish a countywide arts service organization. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, I don't think people are single-issue voters," Desmarais 
said. "It wouldn't surprise me at all if some people, who voted for people I 
wouldn't have voted for, might still have been offended by certain of their 
actions." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Felz, director of the Fullerton Museum Center and a member of the Orange 
County Coalition for Freedom of Expression, an arts advocacy group, agreed that 
Rohrabacher's success at the polls was a disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
"But," Felz added, "it wasn't unexpected." 
</P>
<P>
The coalition -- formed earlier this year in response to a nationwide 
controversy over the National Endowment for the Arts, which came under attack 
by Rohrabacher and other conservatives for funding what critics called obscene 
or sacrilegious artworks -- also had targeted Costa Mesa Mayor Peter F. Buffa, 
who also won reelection Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The NEA brouhaha trickled down to a local level in Costa Mesa in July when the 
City Council voted to forbid the use of city arts grants for "obscene matters" 
or for religious or political activity. 
</P>
<P>
Donning masks of Buffa, coalition members said they believed the restrictions 
would stifle expression and "impose homogeneous cultural standards upon the 
entire community." 
</P>
<P>
But Felz said Wednesday that the guerrilla art demonstration wasn't meant as an 
attack against Buffa as an individual. Rather, he said, Buffa was singled out 
as the city's representative. 
</P>
<P>
"Now," Felz continued, "we're just going to keep watching the City Council and 
looking at (how council members enforce) their grant restrictions, and what the 
new council makeup is like. Hopefully, we'll work with them to look at their 
policies regarding the arts." 
</P>
<P>
A more upbeat response to the election results came from Barbara Hammerman, 
managing director of the Grove Shakespeare Festival. In September, the 
financially strapped troupe canceled the final production of its current season 
when the Garden Grove City Council refused to allocate emergency funds. 
</P>
<P>
The season since has been reinstated with help from an anonymous donor and the 
Garden Grove Fire Fighters Assn., among others. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond T. Littrell, the most vocal of the councilmen opposing the funds, did 
not run for reelection. Mayor W. E. (Walt) Donovan, who voted for the financial 
support, was reelected Tuesday and newcomer Mark Leyes won a council seat. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor has been supportive of us and the arts in general, so we welcome 
that election," Hammerman said. "Mark, in his statements during his campaign, 
has been highly complimentary of the arts in Garden Grove, and was instrumental 
in getting $3,500 from the Fire Fighters Assn. during our recent crisis. So 
we're encouraged."

O.C. POP BEAT: TRACING MISSING LINKS IN COUNTY'S ROCK PAST; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER DICK DALE, HIS CHANTAYS AND THE RIGHTEOUS BROTHERS, THERE IS A GAP IN 
ORANGE COUNTY ROCK HISTORY. A FULLERTON MAN IS TRYING TO FILL IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It doesn't take a great expense of ink to tell the history of Orange County's 
impact on rock music in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
The decade started off promisingly enough, with Orange County surf rockers such 
as Dick Dale and the Chantays making a national mark with guitar-driven, 
high-drama instrumentals that defined the surf sound. Then came the Righteous 
Brothers, who got together in 1962 and soon showed the world that white 
suburbanites could have soul. 
</P>
<P>
After that, virtual silence. While all sorts of fresh rock sounds exploded 
across the globe, touched off by the British Invasion of 1964-65, no more was 
heard from these precincts. The proverbial Orange Curtain had descended. 
</P>
<P>
It's a history that sits so poorly with Tracy Sands that he has decided to do 
some archeological digging. Sands, who runs a tiny record company from his 
cluttered garage in Fullerton, thinks he can add a small footnote to rock's 
history, one that will prove Orange County did not hibernate through the 
post-Beatles '60s. 
</P>
<P>
At 40, Sands still wears his hair in a modified Beatle cut, plays keyboards a 
couple of nights a week in a pickup rock band and earns his living fixing 
broken amplifiers for local musicians. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the mountain of boxes, tubes and electronic innards that fill his garage, 
Sands is also trying to reassemble the lost past of Orange County rock. Dubbing 
the project "Behind the Orange Curtain," he aims to publish a book and release 
a record album that will tell the story of the Orange County rock scene from 
1964 to 1970. 
</P>
<P>
There is plenty of music to uncover, Sands insists, and many tales to tell 
about the youthful bands that created it. Sure, the garage rockers and 
psychedelic teens of Orange County never made it into rock's annals. But that 
doesn't mean they weren't trying. And Sands is certain that some of the music 
they left behind is well worth bringing to light. 
</P>
<P>
Sands was an Anaheim teen-ager when he saw the Beatles on television. Like a 
lot of his local peers, it made him rush right out and start a band. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a guitar player on every corner," he recalled. "Behind me, next door 
to me -- everyone wanted to be a Beatle. And the people who didn't want to be a 
Beatle wanted to be a Stone. I got in a band right away. But with all the 
flurry of activity we had here, not one band became famous." 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for that, Sands said, were bad luck and Orange County's image as a 
bastion of ultraconservatism. It was not a fashionable address for anybody 
trying to establish credentials within the counterculture. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County bands had a stigma attached to them," recalled Bob Ellis, who 
was the drummer for the Fabs, a strong Fullerton garage band that Sands plans 
to include in his "Orange Curtain" project. "When we played in L.A., we would 
say we were from L.A., and everything went just fine. Once they learned we were 
from Orange County, it was, 'John Birchers. White Protestants. You're not a 
rock 'n' roll type of guy.' " 
</P>
<P>
Brian Carman, who played guitar with the Chantays, thinks it wasn't a matter of 
sociopolitical prejudice that accounted for Orange County bands' failure to 
thrive after the early '60s surf rock era, but simply the difficulty that 
musicians based in any suburban area encounter in forging connections in 
big-city music centers. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those obstacles, rockers such as Sands and Ellis persisted. 
</P>
<P>
The Fabs, who played garage rock dominated by a rinky Farfisa organ sound, put 
out one single on a small Texas label before evolving into the Stack, a 
Cream-style heavy-rock band that Ellis says received a good deal of attention 
from record companies in the late 1960s. The Stack made an album for Charisma 
Records in 1968, but only a few promotional copies came out. The band toured 
the West Coast with the then-unknown Alice Cooper, and it also appeared on 
bills with the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Three Dog Night. But when Stack's 
album was stillborn, the group fell apart. 
</P>
<P>
Sands played in bands with names such as the Lords, the Invasions and Jubal's 
Children, getting the occasional look from a big label but no substantial 
offers. 
</P>
<P>
After moving to Ohio for a few years in the early '70s, he returned to Orange 
County and got the notion of starting his own record company. The result was 
Torchlite Records, which recorded local talent on a modest scale, selling 
several hundred copies of each release, which, says Sands, was enough to break 
even and keep the company going. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Sands took his first stab at an Orange County '60s revival release, 
getting approval from his old friend, Ellis, to put out a single featuring two 
songs by the Fabs that were originally released in 1966 (the songs, "Dinah 
Wants Religion" and "That's the Bag I'm In," both stand up well as examples of 
the sort of rough-and-ready garage rock popularized by more successful Southern 
California groups such as the Seeds, the Leaves and the Standells). While the 
45 sold only about 200 copies, Sands decided to become more involved in what he 
sees as a small but solid market for obscure '60s collector's items. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Sands formed a partnership with Swak Records (Sealed With A 
Kiss), a British label devoted to '60s reissues. With help from Swak, Sands 
said, his Orange County compilation should receive wider distribution than he 
could have managed on his own. 
</P>
<P>
Now all Sands has to do is dig up those lost Orange County rock artifacts, and 
hope they will gain currency among collectors. He has been trying to get in 
touch with as many '60s Orange County rockers as he can find, in hopes that 
they'll have old tapes worth dusting off and presenting on his "Behind the 
Orange Curtain" collection (he plans a limited-edition run of 1,000 albums). 
</P>
<P>
Sands also wants to sit down and interview as many band members as he can find 
for his book, with the idea of writing a separate chapter on each band. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Sands said, there have been some disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
"I know a lot of the names of the bands; I knew the people but most of them 
have disappeared," he said. "Some of them I contacted flat out told me they 
would be embarrassed by it. They have a position now in the business community, 
and they don't want it known" that they once played in a '60s rock band. 
</P>
<P>
But Sands has also found some '60s rockers who are eager to have their old 
tapes heard. One of his discoveries is Aardvark, a British Invasion-influenced 
band from Buena Park whose only remaining relic is a homemade tape of a song 
called "The Good Things." 
</P>
<P>
"A friend of ours had just gotten a tape recorder and he wanted to try it out," 
recalled Dale Miller, who played guitar in Aardvark. "It was recorded in an 
apartment house on a two-track recorder. It was very rushed, because you didn't 
want to make a lot of noise and disturb the neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Miller is pleased at the idea of having Aardvark resurrected through 
Sands' "Orange Curtain" project. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping the theme throughout the album will be, 'Hey, there was some good 
material here. There was something worthwhile.' " 
</P>
<P>
Brian Carman, the former Chantay, is giving Sands access to tapes he made later 
in the '60s, after surf music had run its commercial course and he turned to 
vocal music influenced by the Byrds, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. 
</P>
<P>
After the Beatles arrived, Carman recalled, the Chantays were pegged strictly 
as an outdated instrumental surf band. So they adopted different names -- the 
Ill Winds and the Leaping Fearns -- in hopes of getting a shot at duplicating 
their earlier success while moving with the fast-changing musical times. 
</P>
<P>
Sands wants to hear from other Orange County rockers who have other stories, 
and other songs, to share. He can be contacted at P.O. Box 2425-119, Anaheim, 
Calif. 92814-2425. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of people who made tapes in the '60s and these are just 
sitting in the closet gathering dust," Sands said. "If they want to come 
forward, if they want to be part of the book, if they want to get exposure for 
something that they thought should have been a hit, I'll listen to it." 
</P>
<P>
Three bands who record for Orange County-based Dr. Dream Records -- the Swamp 
Zombies, Food for Feet (which includes John Avila and Johnny (Vatos) Hernandez 
from Oingo Boingo) and Eggplant -- will play free shows Nov. 17 at Tower 
Records, 306 N. Beach Blvd. in Anaheim. Another Dr. Dream act, Andy Prieboy, 
will be on hand to chat and sign autographs starting at about 1 p.m., but will 
not perform. The music starts at 2:30. 
</P>
<P>
The Mighty Flyers, a longtime presence on the local blues scene, have signed 
with Black Top Records, a New Orleans-based blues and R&amp;B label. Black Top 
has scheduled a Jan. 15 release for the Flyers' album, "Blues in the Dark." 
</P>
<P>
Tuxedo Cowboy, a folk-country-classical trio from Costa Mesa, will record its 
debut album next month for a new San Clemente-based record label, Audioquest. 
</P>
<P>
The album, to be recorded live in a Santa Barbara church chosen for its 
acoustics, will probably be out next spring, said Joe Harley, Audioquest's vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Audioquest's main line of business is selling state-of-the-art cable for 
audiophile sound systems. But the company has begun to branch into producing 
and marketing music as well. 
</P>
<P>
The first release under the Audiophile name will be "Usin' Man Blues," a live 
solo acoustic album that Huntington Beach blues singer Robert Lucas recorded 
last summer in the same church that Tuxedo Cowboy will use. That album is due 
in December. Harley said that Lucas and his electric band, Luke &amp; the 
Locomotives, are scheduled to record an album next month in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
A classical group, Trio Galanterie, and jazz saxophonist Chico Freeman also are 
scheduled to record for Audioquest, Harley said. The Audioquest roster further 
includes a flamenco-oriented duo, Strunz and Farah. 
</P>
<P>
Harley said the label will sell its releases through audiophile electronics 
stores and by mail but is trying to develop a distribution network to move into 
regular record shops as well.

THIS COMIC KEEPS HIS BACK AGAINST WALL; 
</P>
<P>
STAND-UP: TODD GLASS' PORTABLE STAGE -- COMPLETE WITH IMPROV-STYLE BRICK 
BACKDROP -- MAKES HIM INTO THE MOBILE COMEDIAN. THERE'S NO TELLING WHERE HE'LL 
TRY HIS SHTICK.

<P>
There are a lot of comics working the clubs out there, but Todd Glass must be 
the only one who has performed for a herd of cows. 
</P>
<P>
Glass, who has dubbed himself the Mobile Comedian, has a portable stage -- 
complete with Improv-style brick wall -- on the back of his truck, so he can do 
his stand-up routine when and wherever he wants. 
</P>
<P>
His impromptu bovine gig came somewhere on the road between here and Salt Lake 
City. Glass thought that the cows looked kinda bored and, well, a little comedy 
seemed just the thing to perhaps liven their day. As he asked rather 
rhetorically during a recent interview at the Improvisation in Irvine, "When do 
you think the last time they got a show was?" 
</P>
<P>
The Fountain Valley resident also does al fresco performances on the beach and 
even outside the clubs where he performs. He has performed at colleges, at 
parties and outside the Department of Motor Vehicles. He tried his shtick in 
moving traffic, but a cop put a stop to that. 
</P>
<P>
"To be driving down the road and see an eight-foot brick wall is a strange 
sight," Glass allows. 
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old started his Mobile Comedian gigs in April, not as a gimmick or 
to get more work, he says (he's a regular middle act at the Irvine Improv and 
other Southland clubs), but just because he thought it sounded like fun. 
</P>
<P>
"It's, like, the corniest idea in the world. I know it's stupid," Glass admits. 
</P>
<P>
But, he says, people seem to respond: "They see this guy trying to do something 
new, and they support it." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike his more structured stage act, Glass' Mobile Comedian performances rely 
heavily on audience interaction and a man-on-the-street approach. 
</P>
<P>
Glass' freewheeling style and quick wit have a risky side: Comedy club 
audiences may be prepared for his sometimes-pointed remarks, but what about the 
unsuspecting public at large? 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you totally annoy somebody," Glass says, but, he adds: "They're so 
few that they're funny. And of course, I only get more annoying and louder and 
more obnoxious." 
</P>
<P>
Most people, though, catch on quickly. "Everyone knows the brick wall from TV," 
Glass says, and they associate it with the prototypical comedy club. 
</P>
<P>
While Glass started the project as a lark, he's beginning to get wise to its 
promotional possibilities. He envisions the Mobile Comedian taking on a persona 
of his own and paving the way for TV work. In fact, camera crews from the 
Comedy Channel followed Glass around San Diego last month and will begin airing 
brief segments during commercial breaks and between shows. 
</P>
<P>
Many comics say they disdain TV, but Glass freely admits that he'd love to land 
a regular gig on a TV show, no matter how bad. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's goal is to get into people's living rooms," Glass says. "Even if 
it's the worst thing in the world, I would be in people's living rooms." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, though, Glass is not ready to let the Mobile Comedian 
overshadow his regular stand-up act. On the contrary, he is apt to use his 
impromptu outdoor shows to promote his stage appearances, in which he covers 
material ranging from his jealousy of traffic cops ("That's my dream in life -- 
to drive real slow and have no one pass me") to impersonations of the painfully 
contorted expressions his dad took on when smoking. 
</P>
<P>
Glass is also given to rushes into the crowd, as he does in a bit where he 
parodies a fan who relates a little too strongly to the comedian on stage 
(Comic: "I was talking to my girlfriend the other day . . ." Fan: "He has a 
girlfriend?! I have a girlfriend! This guy is just like us!"). 
</P>
<P>
Glass sees the Mobile Comedian as a logical adjunct to his stage career, which 
started when he began frequenting open-mike nights in his native Philadelphia 
at age 16. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a stage hog," he says, "and I can't get enough stage time."

Soft Pedaling Ecology 
</P>
<P>
These days when people talk about conservation and ecology, they usually say 
something such as, "I'm saving water and recycling, but I'm not riding my bike 
to work or anything." 
</P>
<P>
The disclaimer is meant to show that although these people are in favor of 
doing what's expected, they aren't raving-green nut cases or anything. 
</P>
<P>
But Larry Krikorian rides his bike to work -- from Silver Lake to Pierce 
College in Woodland Hills, where he is an English instructor -- but he's not a 
raving-green nut case either. He says it's fun. 
</P>
<P>
"A friend gave me my first racing bike about four years ago when I was really 
down and out, and I found that riding it made me feel better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For the past nine months, Krikorian, 32, has been following a schedule in which 
he drives his car the 25 miles to school on Monday, with the bike on a rack. 
Monday night, he leaves his car at school and pedals home, and Tuesday morning 
he rides back. Tuesday night he drives home and Wednesday drives back. That 
night and the next morning he bikes, and so forth. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a Benotto bike that has Italian styling, is made in Mexico, with 
Japanese parts and French wheels, and I really feel good riding it," he said. 
"I'm like one of those anorexic runners that has to go farther and farther to 
get the same high." He would really like to pedal both ways every day, but he 
holds it down to every other day because he says clothing is a problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I get out of my riding clothes and shower in the faculty center when I get to 
school, but I'm always wearing the same thing I wore the day before because I 
forget to bring a change of clothing." 
</P>
<P>
Krikorian says the route from Woodland Hills over Oxnard Street to the 
Sepulveda Dam area over Burbank Boulevard to Lankershim Boulevard, down to 
Riverside Drive, over to Forest Lawn Drive and through Griffith Park is scenic, 
but not necessarily carefree. 
</P>
<P>
Because Daylight Saving Time ended, "I have to leave school earlier to get home 
before dark," he said. "It usually take me about 90 minutes to make the trip -- 
which is faster than some people do it by car in rush hour. But darkness is too 
much of a hazard to risk." 
</P>
<P>
He also doesn't ride in the rain. "It doesn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest hazard in pedaling to work has nothing to do with nature, however: 
It's lunatic motorists, Krikorian said. 
</P>
<P>
"There just seem to be some car drivers out there who want to give bike riders 
a scare," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sky Watch 
</P>
<P>
There are people who are plane junkies, who just like to watch anything that 
goes up, up and away. 
</P>
<P>
You can find these people around any small airport, Van Nuys Airport being no 
different, except that it is among the busiest in the nation for small-plane 
traffic and has a lot of old flying military hardware that takes off 
occasionally, so the watching is about as good as it gets. 
</P>
<P>
For almost 20 years, plane junkies have been hanging out at the 94th Aero 
Squadron restaurant at 16302 Raymer St. in Van Nuys, but the real hard core 
don't dilute their sky watch with dinner or drinks. They take it straight, at 
the minute Airport Observation Area, which is open to the public but almost 
impossible to find. 
</P>
<P>
To get to the observation area take a left off of Woodley Avenue onto Waterman 
Drive and go to the end, where there is a tiny parking lot next to the field. 
There, you can sit in your car and just watch. 
</P>
<P>
Finding the place is a challenge because the sign announcing it is small if 
you're going north on Woodley, and unreadable if you're going south. And, if 
you do see the sign, there is another sign that says Waterman Drive is a 
private road, which it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
Kyoto native Hidenhiko Saki, who left Japan six months ago to live in the 
United States, is working at a nearby hotel. He spends Sundays watching the 
planes take off and touch down, and he brings along a radio so he can listen in 
on what the tower is saying to the pilots. He says it helps him to learn 
English. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe High students Sean Dolezal, 16, and his brother, Michael, 14, live with 
their mom in Van Nuys. But when their dad comes for a visit from his home in 
Colorado, they take him to watch the planes. 
</P>
<P>
It's something of a busman's holiday for Steve Dolezal. He's a corporate pilot 
for McClosky Enterprises flying out of Aspen. "But you really see a lot of 
interesting aircraft here," the father said. "We saw a Gulfstream II take off a 
while back. It's a 12- to 14-seat corporate jet that probably costs about $7 
million."

Generation Gap Rap 
</P>
<P>
Judy Kass is a professional do-gooder who has spent most of her career working 
with hard cases. 
</P>
<P>
She has worked with mentally ill criminals, with battered women and children, 
with the mentally ill homeless. Now Kass, who has a master's degree in marriage 
and family counseling from UCLA, is working with two groups she thought should 
get to know one another, teen-agers and the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Every Tuesday between 11:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m., the elders from the Pacoima 
Senior Citizen Multi-Purpose Senior Center and young people who attend the 
Pacoima Skills Center, a continuation high school, meet at the senior center 
for something called a Generational Gap Rap. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my thought that getting the two groups together might possibly be good 
for a number of reasons, which it has," Kass said. "The teen-agers, many of 
whom have never had a caring adult listen to them, are very willing to open up 
about their problems to the seniors. The children, many of whom have children 
of their own, respond to the kindness and mature thinking of adults who have no 
ax to grind." 
</P>
<P>
What is particularly poignant, the counselor said, is hearing the youngsters 
talk about how pressured they feel to join gangs, and their elders pointing out 
that there are always choices. 
</P>
<P>
And the elderly get their opinions heard, as well. "The older participants have 
tried to explain to the young people how hard they have worked for what they 
have and how frightened they are by vandalism and other crimes against people 
and property," Kass said. "I think seeing it from the older person's 
perspective has been a real eye-opener for the youngsters." 
</P>
<P>
At first, Kass said, the elders were a bit slow to respond, but now the 
sessions have limited to 15 youngsters and 15 seniors.

NEWINGTON, CONN. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three months after she got out of therapy for a broken back at Newington 
Children's Hospital here, Sheri Martin returned to work at Windsor Federal 
Savings and Loan. 
</P>
<P>
Martin was paralyzed from the chest down after a snowmobile crash in January, 
1989. Before the accident, she was a teller at the bank. When she returned to 
work in August, she rolled her wheelchair behind a desk to work as a 
customer-service representative. 
</P>
<P>
"The bank set up the desks differently for me, and they already had a 
handicapped bathroom," Martin, 22, said. 
</P>
<P>
She worked at the desk for nearly a year, but now she wants to train tellers at 
the new computer terminals the bank has set up "behind the line," where tellers 
wait on customers. 
</P>
<P>
The terminals are at eye-level -- eye-level for tellers who stand up. So Martin 
has to stand up, too. 
</P>
<P>
That is what brought her to Seamus Donnellan, owner of A&amp;L Mobility in 
Windsor, Conn., and distributor of wheelchairs that unfold to allow the user to 
stand. After seeing a demonstration of different standing devices at the 
hospital, she decided to buy Donnellan's product. 
</P>
<P>
Like Transformers -- those children's toys that convert from a car or plane to 
a robot -- the wheelchairs lose their traditional look with a tug on two 
spring-loaded bars. 
</P>
<P>
Martin first folds the padded chair arms around her chest. Then she reaches 
back to grasp the two bars near the back of the chair's wheels, and tugs 
gently. 
</P>
<P>
The metal frame begins to move and change shape. Martin's tug is aided by a 
gas-filled spring that resembles a miniature shock absorber. The spring helps 
her push. The back of the wheelchair rises, with the seat sliding up so her 
lower back rests against it. 
</P>
<P>
The small front wheels lift off the ground, and an L-shaped stand replaces 
them. The large back wheels are braked to keep Martin firmly in place. 
</P>
<P>
She is not quite erect: She leans at a 75-degree angle, her arms resting on 
what used to be the chair arms, her knees getting an extra lift from padded 
braces. But a lot of her support comes the old-fashioned way: from her feet. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not gimmickry at all," said Cindi Jones, publisher of Mainstream, a San 
Diego-based magazine for consumers with disabilities. "It has medical benefits, 
and there are self-esteem issues." 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Zlotnick of West Hartford, an advocate for the disabled, agreed: "For 
multiple sclerosis and certain spinal-cord injuries, it has validity." 
</P>
<P>
For someone paralyzed by a spine injury, standing can improve blood 
circulation, lessen muscle spasms and contractions, and prevent calcium loss in 
bones, or osteoporosis, which makes the bones brittle. ("I couldn't do this 
with someone who had been paralyzed for 20 years. His leg bones would snap," 
Donnellan said.) 
</P>
<P>
It also helps reduce the risk of pressure sores, once known as bed sores, which 
extended sitting can produce on the behind; reduce bladder infections; and 
reduce the occurrence of kidney stones. 
</P>
<P>
As for those self-esteem issues, "If you stand up, you can look someone in the 
eye," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Donnellan's Lifestand, invented in France, is one of several brands in what 
Jones calls "a growth industry" among the 2 million to 3 million wheelchair 
users in the United States. There's also Levo U.S.A., IMEX Healthcare Inc. and 
the all-electric HiRider, a $12,000 to $16,000 device that can roll you down 
the street in a standing position. 
</P>
<P>
Lifestand chairs cost $4,800 to $4,900, depending on the model and size, 
Donnellan said, compared with $1,000 to $2,500 for a "standard" wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
Jones warned: "Disabled consumers tend to be at the mercy of their durable 
medical equipment dealer." Her magazine tries to give consumers an idea of the 
alternatives, she said, and has published articles comparing stand-up frames 
and wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
The standing wheelchairs must be prescribed by a doctor; they should not be 
used if there are any cardiac or orthopedic problems or bone brittleness. 
Donnellan said that 75% to 80% of the chairs are bought through health 
insurance, Medicare, Medicaid and workers' compensation. 
</P>
<P>
Devices for standing are not new: Stationary "standing frames," available for 
years for residential or office use, have allowed disabled people to lift 
themselves to their feet. Such frames resemble tall tables with straps or other 
supports to hold a user up. 
</P>
<P>
Although Dr. Philip Arnold, director of the Department of Rehabilitative 
Medicine at Newington Children's Hospital, prescribed the chair for Martin, he 
is wary of the newer devices. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a lot more expensive and a lot more mechanically complicated than a 
simple standing frame," Arnold said. "They are usually prescribed when they can 
help in terms of business or the workplace." 
</P>
<P>
They are heavier and more awkward and harder to get in and out of a car than a 
lightweight chair, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about physiological benefits, he said, "There is no benefit they have for 
circulation, osteoporosis or anything else that cannot be accomplished with a 
lightweight wheelchair accompanied by a simple standing frame." 
</P>
<P>
He said standing frames cost one-tenth the cost of a standing wheelchair.

INDIAN LEADER REFLECTS ON TRIBAL LIFE IN 1990S; 
</P>
<P>
TRADITIONS: THE SPIRIT SUFFERS AT THE HANDS OF TECHNOLOGY ON TODAY'S 
RESERVATION.

WINNEBAGO, Neb. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To the truckers traveling U.S. Highway 75 through the hilly Nebraska 
countryside from Sioux City, Iowa, to Omaha, the Black Hawk Community Center 
probably seems like just another one-story street-front building in yet another 
struggling rural community. 
</P>
<P>
To Reuben Snake, however, it's home -- the focus of activity here on the 
Winnebago Indian Reservation, the center of his own earlier work as chief of 
the Winnebago Tribe and a place from which to look outward on the values and 
ethics of the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
What he sees both troubles and encourages him. 
</P>
<P>
"By and large, the traditional teachings are not occurring at a level at which 
they need to occur," he said during an interview at the one-room office of the 
tribe's weekly newspaper. "Most of our children are bombarded by the media -- 
they get their messages from the television." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he says, "it's real hard to be an Indian in this present day -- a 
real spiritual person, the way that we're taught to be." 
</P>
<P>
The challenge for Snake arises because of "this great struggle between the 
technologically oriented thinkers and the intuitive thinkers," he said. "There 
are a lot of us intuitive thinkers left, but at times I get the feeling that 
we're fighting a losing battle -- because as each generation gets sucked into 
the use of technology, they get lazy." 
</P>
<P>
He worries that "European people," preaching the dominance of technology, are 
eroding native patterns of thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"What does it add to the quality of life to have a TV in every room, and drive 
four cars, and fly across the continent in three hours? It doesn't make me a 
better human being to be in contact with all of that," Snake said. 
</P>
<P>
What spawned that technological thinking? Snake, whose first and last names 
reflect the mixture of Christian and Indian traditions in which he was raised, 
blames a literal interpretation of the biblical teaching that God gave man 
dominion over the Earth. That idea, says Snake, has led people to think that 
"they can control nature" through technology. That gives them "a false sense of 
superiority." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, he says, "the Indian is a part of the creation, and we're supposed 
to fit into and be harmonious with the creation, and not to have the thought 
that we can dominate any part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Born on the Winnebago reservation, Snake grew up in Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota 
and Kansas, attending mission schools and a federal boarding school. In 1965, 
he became chairman of the radical American Indian Movement and was known for a 
time as the most militant Indian in Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
But in what he calls a "180-degree turn," he served on the American Indian 
Policy Review Commission, as president of the National Congress of American 
Indians, and as tribal chairman of the 10,000-member Winnebago nation for 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Looking at the challenges facing the United States and the world, Snake sees 
the need for "a major attitudinal shift" in values. What values would he put 
forward from his own culture? In answer, he recalls the ethical education he 
received from his grandfather, who taught him that there were "three things 
that made the enjoyment of human life possible -- three things that people were 
supposed to exhibit in their everyday activities:" 
</P>
<P>
* Respect. "The first one is respect for your fellow man. Each one of us is 
endowed by the creator with his spirit," Snake said. "The spirit that makes you 
stand up and walk and talk and see and hear and think is the same spirit that 
exists in me -- there's no difference. So when you look at me, you're looking 
at yourself -- and I'm seeing me in you." 
</P>
<P>
* Compassion. "When you look at all the other parts of creation, all the other 
living creatures, the creator endowed them with gifts that are far better than 
ours," Snake said. Compared to the strength of the grizzly bear, the 
sharp-sightedness of the eagle, the fleetness of the deer and the acute hearing 
of the otter, "we're pitiful human beings. We don't have any of those physical 
attributes that the creator put into everything else. For that reason, we have 
to be compassionate with one another and help one another -- to hold each other 
up." 
</P>
<P>
* Honor. "It's easy to point fingers at one another for our shortcomings," 
Snake recalls his grandfather saying. "But to show somebody the feelings of 
pride that you have in them for what they do that's beneficial to their fellow 
man -- that takes effort. But if you go to that kind of effort, then you're 
going to have that good feeling that we have to have one for another. And 
that's what makes life enjoyable." 
</P>
<P>
Snake, a deeply religious man, is active in the Native American Church, which 
is known for the ritualistic use of peyote, a hallucinogen derived from cactus. 
Federal law exempts the religious use of peyote from criminal narcotics laws, 
although the issue is now before the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Snake notes that Indians share some of the key biblical teachings about 
killing, stealing and sexual morality -- although they see them slightly 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
"The Ten Commandments -- 'Thou shalt not kill,' 'Thou shalt not steal' -- to my 
way of thinking, I don't know of any particular group of people that really 
abided by those," he says. Indian communities are not free of warlike thinking: 
"Probably the most serious shortcoming of tribal governments is their inability 
to effectively resolve conflict within the tribe and externally," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Yet resolving conflict is essential to maintaining a sense of community, which 
is an important aspect of Indian thinking. "A tribal person's mentality is 
different from that of a non-tribal person," he says. "In a non-tribal 
environment, the well-being of the individual is predominant. . . . As a 
Winnebago Indian, I first of all think, of any of my actions, 'How is that 
going to reflect on my people?' " 
</P>
<P>
Native American society required its members to make whatever they needed, 
Snake says. This, in turn, was related to the codes governing the relations 
between the sexes. "People were taught not to seek marriage until they were 
capable of going out and getting their food, building their own lodge and 
making their own clothing -- both male and female." He worries that the 
acceptability of divorce now threatens the very concept of family, which he 
regards as "the root of every social order." 
</P>
<P>
What, finally, does Snake see as the need for the future? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you guys all need to go back to Europe," he says with a laugh. Then, 
turning serious, he notes that "our ethics, our moral principles, come out of 
our spiritual and religious training." Central to the Indian teaching, he says, 
is a sense of oneness. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody -- I don't care what color, creed, ethnic origin their roots are -- 
we're all the same. We all have common roots. In spite of all of these 
technological achievements, we're beginning to understand that there is a 
oneness to the whole universe -- there is a oneness."

TOURISM: THE GROUP GIVES ATLANTIC CITY, N.J., A LUKEWARM 3 1/2-PINEAPPLE SCORE 
AFTER RUN-INS WITH A JITNEY DRIVER AND A WAITRESS.

<TEXT>
<P>
The jitney driver in Atlantic City, N.J., who snarled at Geraldine Reynoso when 
she took up an extra seat on his local bus, would have been wise to hold his 
tongue. His words would come back to haunt him. 
</P>
<P>
Reynoso, as it turned out, was a detective. Hospitality detective, that is. 
</P>
<P>
She and a dozen fellow honors students at Johnson &amp; Wales University were 
in the resort recently to sample restaurants, hotels, transportation, casinos 
-- all the city had to offer its visitors. 
</P>
<P>
When the sleuthing was done, a news conference was called and the hospitality 
verdict delivered: 3 1/2 pineapples. 
</P>
<P>
On a scale of one to five pineapples (the students' symbols of hospitality) 
that was not bad. But the marketing director for the Atlantic City Convention 
and Visitors Bureau said it clearly showed room for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"We are talking to the jitney association to see if they can spruce up their 
temperaments a bit," John Fox said. "We're in a strong state of transition 
here. There is no excuse for not being polite, but I think we have some of the 
same problems as big cities do around the country." 
</P>
<P>
Atlantic City was the first to be officially put to the test by the students at 
Johnson &amp; Wales, a Providence, R.I.-based school that specializes in 
travel, tourism and culinary arts. 
</P>
<P>
It will not be the last, though. The students plan to visit about 20 cities 
with well-established tourism industries or plans to develop them. Ultimately, 
their efforts will yield a book informing readers whether a town offers 
top-drawer service (five pineapples) or is simply a traveler's nightmare (one 
pineapple). 
</P>
<P>
"The 1980s was a marketing era," said Paul Lacroix, chairman of the Travel 
&amp; Tourism Department at Johnson &amp; Wales and the guiding force behind 
"America's Most Hospitable Cities Survey." 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone went marketing," he said. "Now we have the customers, and my question 
to students is, 'What do we do with them?' I think the '90s is going to be an 
era of service. I think it's a very natural follow-up to what has happened in 
the '80s." 
</P>
<P>
Lacroix began toying with the idea of a nationwide hospitality survey in the 
fall and students developed the mechanism in class work, Lacroix said. 
</P>
<P>
They tried it out in Providence, a city trying to build its tourism industry, 
then modified it considerably before setting off for Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson &amp; Wales sent four faculty advisers and 13 students to the resort 
city, where the students were set loose. 
</P>
<P>
"I call them my SWAT team," Lacroix said. "They're my pineapple SWAT team." 
</P>
<P>
In all, students stopped at nearly 700 restaurants, casinos, hotels and other 
tourist attractions, and racked up 1,748 "service encounters." 
</P>
<P>
Reynoso, from River Vale, N.J., said the casinos, hotels and tourist 
attractions such as historic Smithville made Atlantic City worth the trip. But 
she and other students discovered several service problems. 
</P>
<P>
Reynoso had a brusque encounter with the driver of a jitney, a small bus 
resembling a milk truck that is common in Atlantic City. The driver became 
angry when Reynoso's easels and packages took up an extra seat. Another group 
of students recalled that a waitress mocked them because she thought the tip 
they left was inadequate. The students were actually not finished and planned 
to leave more, Reynoso said. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked it attraction-wise, but for service it was around average," Reynoso 
said. "They could use a lot more training." 
</P>
<P>
Student sleuths each spent $300 to $400 of university money checking out the 
city, making them the envy of a number of fellow students back in Providence. 
But, Reynoso said, the survey was more work than they could have imagined. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very tired," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Students involved in the hospitality survey kept a daily log and reported on 
each service encounter. At the end of the weekend, they called a news 
conference, gave their pineapple rating and discussed their findings. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the review was quite fair," Fox said. "Atlantic City is a city in 
strong transition." 
</P>
<P>
Lacroix declined to say where the next hospitality survey will take place but 
revealed that it will probably be in New England. The program will concentrate 
on smaller cities such as Worcester, Mass.; Hartford, Conn.; Portland, Maine; 
Manchester, N.H.; and Newport, R.I., before taking on cities such as Atlanta, 
Los Angeles, New York, and Miami, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lacroix expects that the guidebook based on the visits will be as helpful to 
the service industry and the cities as it is to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, one like it does not exist," he said. "There are a lot of 
articles in terms of service quality slipping in America, but nothing as far as 
an organized program like this."

BUILDING ON A COMPLEX PARTNERSHIP

<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES Whiteson is a Los Angeles architect and 
author whose most recent book is the Watts Towers of Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most architects find their clients by referral or through social connections, 
but Eric Moss met Frederick Smith -- the man who was to become his most 
important patron -- purely by chance. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in 1987, I rented studio space in Culver City in a run-down industrial 
structure owned by Fred's father," Moss recalled. "Fred and I got to talking, 
and discovered we had many interests in common. One thing led to another, and 
we ended up working together to transform a whole complex of old Culver City 
buildings, that could take us the rest of the decade to complete." 
</P>
<P>
The complex developed by Smith and designed by Moss already has won several 
architectural awards, including a recent merit citation from the Los Angles 
chapter of the American Institute of Architects. But it is only one of several 
rundown Culver City properties that Smith and Moss are upgrading. 
</P>
<P>
Through their collaboration, an untidy collection of industrial structures is 
being converted into upscale office space for a wide variety of professional 
and commercial tenants, from designers to insurance agents. 
</P>
<P>
Though their meeting was accidental, Smith described his choice of Moss, one of 
Los Angeles' leading avant-garde architects, as "somehow inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
"Ben Smith, my father, had a simple rule I always follow: Work with people who 
are as good or better than you are," Smith said. "When we met Eric, we knew he 
was our man." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the common ground Smith and Moss established early on, it took some 
time for the developer and his architect to overcome the adversarial attitudes 
that often charge the client-designer relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"Fred's father was a tough guy," Moss said. "He made his priorities known 
upfront and that meant a strict accounting of costs as well as a plan to create 
something memorable out of the raw material of the old buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning, there was a lot of mutual tension and apprehension. But as 
Ben, Fred and I got to know one another, our egos meshed and things began to go 
more smoothly." 
</P>
<P>
The Smiths had a vision that fused a shrewd financial investment with a desire 
to create a work of architectural art. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Smith, who died last year, had told his son he was "after an artist" with 
the imagination to transform the decaying district next to the old Culver 
Studios into an attractive office environment, without betraying its muscular 
character. 
</P>
<P>
The Smiths' financial vision foresaw that as studio space for smaller design 
and professional firms became expensive in nearby Venice and Santa Monica, 
Culver City would offer an affordable and accessible alternative. They 
understood that to attract such image-conscious tenants, the architecture would 
have to be special. 
</P>
<P>
The Culver City properties are composed of two groups of industrial buildings 
dating from the 1930s and '40s. One group on Ince Boulevard consists of the old 
Paramount Laundry, the Lindblade Tower that houses Moss' studio, and a complex 
of renovated offices for the Gary Group, an international public relations 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
The second cluster of buildings on National Boulevard consists of about 300,000 
square feet of old workshops and warehouses that Moss is converting into small 
studios and offices. 
</P>
<P>
Described by Architectural Record magazine as "a choreographic tour de force," 
the National Boulevard complex epitomizes the way in which Moss has transformed 
the simple sheds into a series of sophisticated spaces without betraying their 
workday character. 
</P>
<P>
In the L-shaped main gallery that Moss carved out of the old factory buildings, 
the original rough timber posts and trusses remain intact, flanked by new white 
walls. Wide skylights and internal glass walls are energized by architectural 
extravaganzas, including a series of formal rotundas that help visitors find 
their way through the jumble. 
</P>
<P>
"On National and on Ince, we found a direct and affordable way to galvanize a 
ramshackle bunch of old buildings," Moss said. "We did this by carefully 
judging where we should add something spectacular -- like the rotundas -- and 
where we should leave well enough alone. Fred's contribution is to have found a 
way to make all this financially compute." 
</P>
<P>
"My role is to create the practical context for Eric to do his thing," Smith 
said. "As we've come to know and trust and like one another, the boundaries 
between what he does and what I do becomes blurred. The collaboration is now 
more or less seamless." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Smith, who had never worked with an architect like Moss before, said he 
quickly came to respect him. Despite Moss' reputation as a quirky architect 
prone to such eccentric gestures as the use of angled sewer pipes as structural 
columns, Smith found him to be "thoroughly practical" in his approach. 
</P>
<P>
"My only regret is that we can't allow Eric to be as creative as he could be," 
Smith said. "The complex financial and social ecology of development such as 
this is so fragile, an extra butterfly could unbalance it. My job is to see 
that doesn't happen, without killing the creativity." 
</P>
<P>
Smith attributes his sensitivity to art and artists to his mother, a noted Los 
Angeles collector. Before her death, Dorothy Smith supported the work of 
avant-garde painters and sculptors long before they were famous. 
</P>
<P>
As a young man, Smith discussed the interaction of art and architecture with 
his parents at the family dinner table. 
</P>
<P>
"When I met Eric, it was the ideas my mother had expressed that made it easy 
for me to sympathize with his aspirations," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Now in his 50s, Smith has a halo of gray hair and a soft face dominated by 
brown eyes. After a restless youth traveling in Europe and the United States, 
he joined his father's development firm. His lifestyle, still unconventional, 
includes a dislike of neckties and a fondness for the weathered 1974 Cadillac 
De Ville that is his mobile office. 
</P>
<P>
Moss, 46, is craggy and awkwardly eloquent. He described his hope that people 
who visit or work in the Culver City spaces he is creating would feel "like 
somebody punched a hole in the sky." He talks passionately of creating 
"insights into the idea that things are discoverable," and sees his approach to 
architecture as similar to James Joyce's way with language in "Ulysses." 
</P>
<P>
"Joyce took an ancient, Homeric form and transformed it into a modern idiom by 
revitalizing the language," Moss said. "He both honored Homer and recreated his 
epic style by creating a very contemporary sense of discontinuity. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Hearing this, Smith smiles. "We often have chats like that," he said. "In fact, 
I think Eric is more articulate about books than about buildings. Architecture 
is too close to his heart for him to be entirely lucid about it." 
</P>
<P>
Both men are deeply engaged in what they see as a vital act of urban 
recolonization with their conversion of derelict buildings into thriving work 
environments. 
</P>
<P>
"We've learned a lot from one another, and from the hard lessons of the project 
itself," Moss said. "I guess we've both learned how to make art within the 
demands of the market without compromising one or the other, and without 
antagonism." 
</P>
<P>
As the years pass, Moss said, he and his client have become more and more 
compatible. 
</P>
<P>
"Fred's become part of me, and I've become part of him. It's a true marriage of 
minds."

BOOKS: JAPANESE-BORN AUTHOR KAZUO ISHIGURO EXPLORES POWER AND SELF-DECEPTION 
FROM A UNIQUE AND VERY BRITISH VANTAGE POINT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH VENANT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An observer watching Kazuo Ishiguro serve small cups of Japanese tea in his 
hotel suite would assume that this is a right and hereditary ritual. 
</P>
<P>
The connection between the crushed tea leaves steeping in the blue china pot 
and the man with the Japanese name is due, however, solely to the well-meaning 
courtesy of the hotel management. 
</P>
<P>
"There's very little you can do to resist these stereotypes," the novelist 
laments in a distinctly British accent, wondering what sort of refreshments 
would have awaited him had he registered with a French or a Russian name. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Nagasaki, Japan, Ishiguro, who is 35, has lived in England since he was 
5 years old. Last fall he was awarded that country's highest literary honor, 
the Booker Prize, for his novel, "The Remains of the Day," which uses as its 
narrator the quintessentially English stereotype, the butler. 
</P>
<P>
So convincing is the portrait that an article in the Sunday Times of London, 
Ishiguro notes, quoted a source close to the queen as reporting that after 
reading the novel, she fretted, "Is this really how it was for the servants?" 
</P>
<P>
The book has also attracted Harold Pinter, who is halfway through writing a 
film script, and Mike Nichols, who is set to direct the movie for Columbia 
Pictures. Meanwhile, the novel has been published this fall in paperback by 
Vintage International Books, bringing Ishiguro on tour to Los Angeles, where he 
is pouring Japanese tea and discussing stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
With due respect for his royal, as well as his ordinary, readers, Ishiguro 
calls concern for his butler, Stevens, "slightly beside the point. I was never 
really interested in what it was like for real butlers," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The gentleman's gentleman -- most widely known in the stylized personages of 
Jeeves in P. G. Wodehouse's books and Hudson in the television series, 
"Upstairs, Downstairs" -- offered a comically cardboard figure through whom 
Ishiguro could explore the introspective themes of self-deception and betrayed 
ideals. English author Doris Lessing has commented that such a contrast has 
produced a book, "which is very funny and one of the saddest I can remember." 
</P>
<P>
While on a scenically restful trip through the English countryside, Stevens, 
who has served for 35 years in one of the country's greatest houses, struggles 
painfully to justify his unfaltering professionalism and thereby accord a 
dignity to his life. By seeing that the silver gleamed in the sideboard drawers 
and the port was served to the gentlemen in the drawing room -- even as his 
father lay upstairs dying -- Stevens rationalizes that he has contributed to 
the important events of the between-war years being decided within his master's 
house and readily subsumes any personal desires into the cause of serving "this 
land of ours Great Britain." 
</P>
<P>
But as stealthily as the shadow of a killer creeping across the pages of a good 
mystery thriller, shards of Stevens' disillusionment quietly lodge themselves 
in his consciousness as he "motors" on in his terrible voyage of 
self-discovery. 
</P>
<P>
For his creator, however, Stevens' anguish is but a practical means of 
exploring the suppression of emotions and the relationship of small, ordinary 
people to political power. 
</P>
<P>
"In British and Japanese society, the ability to control emotions is considered 
dignified and elegant," Ishiguro points out. In Stevens, there is "the tendency 
to mistake having any emotions at all with weakness." 
</P>
<P>
"Ultimately," he says, "the book is about the tragedy of a man who takes that 
thing too far, who somehow denies himself the right to love and be human. This 
is something the middle-class and upper-middle-class English do a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Ishiguro attributes the historical source of classic British restraint to 
mandatory stints in boarding school, endured by generations of boys and girls 
who were separated from their parents at an early age. 
</P>
<P>
"Any boy who spent all his time crying would very rapidly become the butt of 
all his fellows. The ability not to show your emotion must have been paramount 
to surviving with any kind of reputation." 
</P>
<P>
This early emotional discipline was deliberate, Ishiguro thinks, "because the 
British public schools were a training ground for people who would go out and 
administer the colonies. So people were taught how to maintain a stiff British 
exterior in far-flung corners of the world where they'd feel desperately 
homesick. But they must never show that the British were weak." 
</P>
<P>
A similar outward reserve in the Japanese has different origins, he believes. 
While British restraint is based on "a fear of revealing how human you actually 
are," he says, Japanese formality derives from "a fear of offending." 
</P>
<P>
It is "about avoiding at all costs anything that might lead to open conflict," 
says Ishiguro, adding, "I know less about Japanese society, but my guess would 
be that it has to do with a lot of people living on top of each other in very 
confined circumstances, which the Japanese have always had to do. . . . You 
have to learn not to say what you feel sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond social mores, however, Ishiguro has delved into the more universal 
impulse to protect "that very vulnerable terrain in all of us where we expose 
ourselves to feelings and put ourselves at risk in the search for friendship 
and love." Often what appears to be the exercise of dignity and restraint, he 
observes, "is merely a kind of alibi for cowardice." 
</P>
<P>
The subject of self-restraint was brought to Ishiguro's attention by his 
critics. Reviewers almost universally commented that his first two novels, "A 
Pale View of Hills" and "An Artist of the Floating World," both set in Japan, 
were written in an understated style in which meaning was to be found in the 
spaces between what was said. 
</P>
<P>
"I started to wonder where this was coming from," says Ishiguro, who decided to 
make understatement part of his theme rather than a mere accident of style. 
</P>
<P>
The author's concern for participation in political systems is a more conscious 
outgrowth of his experience in coming of age in the late 1960s and early '70s, 
when an idealistic generation thought it was destined to better the world. 
</P>
<P>
"As time has gone on, I've felt this growing frustration that on the one hand 
it's ordinary people such as ourselves who are supposed to be responsible for 
the way a country is run because we are supposed to live in a democracy. On the 
other hand, most of us don't live in the big world where these big decisions 
are made. We just struggle with everyday life. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"So I was drawn to this figure of the butler who tries to gain his dignity by 
doing these menial things very well. . . . What he says is what most of us say, 
that we're offering our little services up to an organization or an employer. . 
. . Our little contribution is going up there somewhere. We all hope it is 
going to be used in a way we approve of. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the position I felt most of us who had been radical and idealistic had 
ended up in -- social workers, teachers, journalists, writers. . . . what 
happens to our contribution is often out of our hands." 
</P>
<P>
Educated at the University of Kent, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 
philosophy and literature, and the University of East Anglia, where he received 
a masters in creative writing, Ishiguro was part of the scene of student 
sit-ins and rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
Taking time off from his studies, he worked in a housing development project in 
Scotland for six months and later worked for several years helping the homeless 
in London, and living for a time in a hostel, while campaigning for housing 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
In one year he worked as a grouse beater, driving birds from cover during hunts 
at the Queen Mother's holiday castle, Balmoral, on the Scottish moors, and 
hitchhiked across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time in England it wasn't such an eccentric thing to want to do 
something useful," he says. "We were as competitive as the would-be Trumps of 
today, but in other terms. . . . In those days we used to vie with each other 
about how worthily we were living our lives. We would actually pull rank on 
each other. We'd look down on somebody who got a regular job at a bank. 
</P>
<P>
"This is why I'm fascinated by that -- wanting to live your life well rather 
than simply wanting to live your life comfortably." 
</P>
<P>
Ishiguro's technical apprenticeship to becoming a novelist came as a songwriter 
and guitar player in a student band. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of these wild experimental splurges where I'd be playing 
thousands of jazz chords and writing this free-form, free-association poetry 
with lots of brilliant pyrotechnical images flashing around," he says. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of his musical career, Ishiguro had settled down to the artistic 
economy of form and expression that mark his literary work. "I try to say 
things as simply and cleanly as possible," he says, "rather than trying to 
reach out for some meaning that's just beyond your grammar." 
</P>
<P>
In the abstract art of music, he also learned to trust his instinct."Because 
you are a writer working in the medium of words, there is sometimes a tendency 
to think you have to logically justify everything you do. You have to think of 
some kind of argument, why one passage is better than another possible passage. 
You just know that's the way you conceived it when you are a musician." 
</P>
<P>
Turning to the subject of his Japaneseness, Ishiguro is on less solid ground. 
Ishiguro's father, an oceanographer sent to England to do research related to 
the North Sea, and his mother, planned every year to return to Japan. Their son 
received monthly packages of educational material about his homeland. 
"Throughout my childhood I had grown up with this very precious country that I 
called Japan, which was a very intense and real place in my imagination." 
</P>
<P>
By the time he was 22, and the family had made no move to return, Ishiguro 
decided to commit this ever-fainter mix of memory and imagination to paper, 
which he did in his first novel. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until he won the Booker Prize a year ago, however, that he made his 
first trip to Japan. "When I went back to Nagasaki I felt I was returning 
home," he says, noting that this "beautiful place of hills and sea" was as 
different from Tokyo as Portland, Ore., is from New York. "That was quite a 
nostalgic visit." 
</P>
<P>
But, Ishiguro states firmly, "I couldn't survive in Japan. It's as alien a 
place (for me) as it is for the next person." 
</P>
<P>
But unlike bona fide foreigners, Ishiguro's predicament is being Japanese-born. 
"I would have to keep explaining myself," he says. "I would not be exempt from 
the very complicated social etiquette." 
</P>
<P>
As a successful Japanese living abroad, Ishiguro says, he is the embodiment of 
the people's "worst nightmare and their best dream." Nightmare because he is "a 
child who went away with his parents and lost his Japaneseness and became 
contaminated," and dream because "they think, 'Oh, but that can happen to our 
children. They can be accepted and successful in other countries.' 
</P>
<P>
"Precisely at this moment in Japanese history, people like me hit an odd sort 
of nerve. It's a country opening up psychologically long after it has done so 
commercially. . . . They're having to redefine Japaneseness." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Ishiguro plans to continue to live in London, where he owns a 
house with his wife, Lorna MacDougall, a social worker, on the south side of 
the city. They manage the house together, doing quite well, he says, without a 
butler.

KICKING UP A STORM; 
</P>
<P>
THE GOALIE WAS A GIRL, BUT ONE PARENT WANTED PROOF. OTHERS WONDERED WHY THE 
ISSUE WAS EVEN RAISED.

LEWISVILLE, Tex. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At halftime of a recent soccer game here for girls under 12, two fathers of 
players on one team walked onto the field. Talking to the referee and the rival 
coach near the goal, one parent allegedly made a unique request. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted his wife to take three of our girls . . . into the bathroom and 
verify that they were girls," said Joe Johnson, coach of the Lewisville Blaze. 
"I said 'No way!' and probably a few other vulgar things. I got very upset. . . 
. The request was absurd." 
</P>
<P>
The story made its way into the local newspaper, the Lewisville Leader, and to 
the papers in Dallas and Ft. Worth, about 25 miles to the south. Soon it spread 
to Newsweek, Sports Illustrated, the Boston Globe and the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
Dudley Green, managing editor of the Leader, said the incident focused more 
attention on the rapidly growing community of 47,000 than any event since a 
Woodstock-style concert in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone in town has been talking about it," said Mike Wood, president of the 
Lewisville Soccer Assn. "Last year we had about 1,900 kids playing soccer. You 
have roughly double that in parents, and you have grandparents and referees. 
It's been all over town." 
</P>
<P>
But the "panty check" story did not end there. Although the two fathers angrily 
denied the allegations, the North Texas State Soccer Assn. suspended one father 
from all games until the end of the fall season and banished the other until 
next September. 
</P>
<P>
And the incident raised perplexing questions about the future of girls' sports. 
Were the Texas fathers accused of making the remarks part of a small minority, 
or do they speak for a large but less vocal community of men who still can't 
accept girls as exceptional athletes? And would this highly publicized episode 
affect girls' willingness to compete, undermining decades of growing female 
participation in sports? 
</P>
<P>
Among a pediatrician and a dozen sociologists and psychologists contacted by 
The Times, a few said the incident could affect girls sports negatively. 
</P>
<P>
"If that thinking (of the fathers) prevailed," said Anne Marie Bird, chair of 
the physical education department at Cal State Fullerton, "little girls 
wouldn't go into sports because their femininity would be questioned. I think 
it would be very threatening (to women's sports.)" 
</P>
<P>
But the overwhelming majority viewed the alleged remarks of the Texas fathers 
as an aberration. 
</P>
<P>
"The kind of incredulity that these men demonstrated borders on irrationality," 
said Don Sabo, a sports sociologist at D'Youville College in Buffalo, N.Y. and 
co-author of a recent book, "Sport, Men and the Gender Order." 
</P>
<P>
"The surveys done during the last decade indicate a tremendous shift in 
attitudes toward girls' participation in athletics," Sabo said. "Overall, 
parents are supportive." 
</P>
<P>
Marjorie Snyder, a sports psychologist who is programs director of the Women's 
Sports Foundation in New York, said she didn't think the remarks would hurt 
girls' athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's the same kind of incident as when (Los Angeles Dodgers general 
manager) Al Campanis made his remarks about blacks," she said. "We look at it 
and say it's outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be vigilant and make sure the opportunities are there for girls, 
but I don't think there is going to be a backlash." 
</P>
<P>
That was good news to Natasha Dennis, 10, the Lewisville Blaze goalie who was 
only 9 when she was apparently asked to prove she was a girl in the Sept. 29 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Next to Dennis' house, a few blocks east of Interstate 35 in Lewisville, is a 
wooden garage with paint chipping from the white siding. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis has appreciably aided the chipping on one wall by frequently lining up 
15 soccer balls on the dirt and kicking them one at a time against the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes she kicks for hours at night under the bright light extending upward 
from the garage roof. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent evening two fire trucks lumbered up her block, sirens screaming and 
bright lights flashing, and stopped in front of her house. Neighbors poured out 
of homes on both sides of the street to see what was wrong. Natasha never 
stopped kicking her soccer ball. The trucks had been called for a small stove 
fire in a house across the street. But for Dennis, only the competitive fires 
burned. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis, who stands 4-feet, 5-inches, has been playing soccer five years. In 
addition to performing on Lewisville Soccer Assn. teams twice a year, she is 
the only girl who plays in boys soccer games at her school during recess. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it when other players come in on me getting ready to kick," said 
Dennis, who wore black soccer shoes with shorts and a T-shirt as she talked to 
a reporter in her living room recently. "I like being able to stop that. I like 
the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"I think girls can play better than boys if we try our best and practice." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Carpenter, a professor of physical education at Brooklyn College, said 
that the dedication Dennis shows is a hallmark of exceptional athletes -- male 
and female. 
</P>
<P>
"Excellence takes commitment and it takes the same kind whether you're male or 
female," said Carpenter, who attended Dorsey High School in Los Angeles and 
earned her Ph.D. from USC. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you'd have to look pretty far to find an exceptional athlete who grew 
up not putting an extraordinary effort into that part of their life." 
</P>
<P>
Specialists say men are beginning to understand the efforts women make to 
excel, and that their understanding may be reflected in attitudes supporting 
girls athletics. 
</P>
<P>
Sabo and Snyder base their optimism about men's attitudes in large part on a 
1987 telephone study for the Women's Sports Foundation. Researchers contacted 
1,004 parents and 513 of their 7- to 18-year-old daughters. 
</P>
<P>
The study found that "parents show very little concern that sports may be 
unladylike." Ninety-seven percent of the fathers and mothers agreed that sports 
provide important benefits to girls. The idea that sports are equally important 
for boys and girls was generally accepted by 87%. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors, sociologists and psychologists said there was every reason to believe 
that girls 9 and 10 years old could play as well as, if not better than, boys. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Barbara Lippe, a professor of pediatrics and chief of the division of 
endocrinology at the UCLA Medical Center, said that the hormones that change 
boys' strength, such as testosterone, don't appear until puberty, which usually 
starts at 11 1/2 or 12. 
</P>
<P>
At the Women's Sports Foundation, Snyder agreed. "In third- and fourth-grade 
class pictures, girls are the tallest and often the strongest, and its not 
unusual for girls to be better athletes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you took a bunch of girls and trained them exactly the same as boys until 
they reached 11 or 12, there's a good chance girls would beat boys." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to possessing abilities similar to boys, many young American girls 
have honed their skills in recent decades by competing in rapidly proliferating 
teams and leagues. 
</P>
<P>
The Women's Sports Foundation study reported that 87% of girls 7 to 10 and 84% 
of girls 11-14 are involved in sports. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder added that 294,000 girls competed in high school sports in 1971, but the 
number increased to 1,839,000 girls along with 3,417,000 boys in 1988-89, the 
last year for which figures are available. 
</P>
<P>
"If you take out 950,000 (boys) playing football, we're getting a lot closer to 
parity," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Noting girls' improvement in gymnastic scores and times for track events, 
Snyder said, "It shouldn't be surprising to anybody . . . that when you begin 
making opportunity available, girls have been improving at all levels of 
competition at a much faster rate than men over the last 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
Carole Oglesby, a sports psychologist who chairs the department of physical 
education at Temple University in Philadelphia, says record-setting performers 
or other superb athletes won't be affected by disparaging remarks about their 
femininity. 
</P>
<P>
"If a young woman shows spectacular promise," Oglesby said, "then her parents 
and coaches will pick up on that and see all that collegiate or Olympic 
competition might offer. She's going to stay with it and get all the positive 
support that goes with those activities." 
</P>
<P>
Oglesby, a graduate of Baldwin Park High School and UCLA, said she's concerned 
that the barbs may drive away average performers who will miss the joys and 
lessons of competition. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a large group of people in the middle of the normal curve of girls 
who will say if people are going to hassle me about this (femininity), I'm not 
going to stay," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the spectacular athlete is the one that men have most trouble accepting, 
Sabo said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I think about these two fathers in Texas, I picture them as very 
traditional males who have difficulty accepting a girl's athletic ability in 
non-stereotypical terms," Sabo said. 
</P>
<P>
"When this man sees a woman who can bench-press 220 pounds or run a 5-minute 
mile, or who can kick his butt in volleyball or baseball, he has no category in 
his mind to put that kind of woman. So he has to turn her into a male to deal 
with her." 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Harris, a sports psychologist and a professor of exercise and sports 
science at Penn State University, said many men think women are inferior 
athletes because those men have confused notions of skill and size or strength. 
</P>

"Look at Steffi Graf, Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati . . . who are superb 
tennis players and will be ranked as the best in world, and yet a male ranked 
50th could probably beat a woman ranked No. 1," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The men can have unorthodox strokes and be less skilled, but can compensate 
through strength and quickness. In many cases, women's matches are more 
interesting because there is more strategy." 
</P>
<P>
While Natasha Dennis can boot a soccer ball 40 or 50 yards, the slender goalie 
would hardly be considered powerful. 
</P>
<P>
She plays soccer because she likes it -- better than skateboarding, better than 
jumping on her trampoline and better than playing football with her 
neighborhood friends. 
</P>
<P>
She also likes it better than wearing dresses or skirts, which she has refused 
to do for two years. On a recent evening, Linda Dennis said her daughter was 
old enough to choose her clothing style, but that she would love Natasha to put 
on a blue jean skirt with a ruffle on the bottom and a pink blouse. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly a gagging sound was heard from the other side of the room where 
Natasha was sitting on the rug. She had a finger in her mouth, reacting in mock 
horror to her mother's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like dresses. They're dorky," said Natasha, whose hair is short and 
curly with a wisp of a ponytail in the style of Joe McIntyre of New Kids on the 
Block. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Dennis continued describing the loafers and the long hair with French 
braids she'd like for Natasha. This time a quiet voice said, "Now you're going 
a little too far." 
</P>
<P>
Natasha had left the living room but had partially returned, sticking her head 
in the doorway to protest. 
</P>
<P>
On the field, Natasha's practice is paying off. She is one of the best players 
on her team and had allowed only seven goals in her first seven games while her 
team had scored 39. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Linda Dennis was surprised and angered when she heard that 
fathers on a rival team had requested that Natasha prove she was a girl. 
</P>
<P>
"If they had sent me into the bathroom with a mother to look down Natasha's 
pants," she said, "that mother wouldn't have come out. She would have been torn 
up and flushed down the toilet." 
</P>
<P>
After the Lewisville team refused the request for a gender check and won the 
game, 3-1, Linda Dennis walked her daughter across the field to meet her 
purported accuser. 
</P>
<P>
"I approached one of the men and said, 'I'd like you to meet my daughter, 
Natasha,' "Dennis said. "He stopped and took a step back -- like he'd seen a 
ghost -- and said, 'Nice game, boy!' " 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'No, it's good game, girl, or good game, kid.' " 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Good game, son,' and reached over and patted her shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
One of Natasha's teammates had trouble understanding the father's attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"We're girls, not wimps!" said Nina McIntosh, 9. 
</P>
<P>
Natasha was nonplussed, as if she'd just made an easy save and booted the ball 
50 yards downfield. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they should go somewhere and check and see if they have anything 
between their ears," she said.

COMPTON DOUBLES UTILITY TAXES AT SPECIAL MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE FUETSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Utility taxes for residential and commercial users were doubled this week from 
5% to 10% at a special session of the Compton City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The tax hike, which passed on a 3-1 vote, takes effect immediately and is 
expected to generate $3.6 million in badly needed revenue for the city. 
</P>
<P>
In a memo to the council, City Manager Howard Caldwell said that without an 
increase in the utility tax, he would have no alternative "but to recommend 
significant layoffs in order to remain financially solvent as a municipality." 
</P>
<P>
The utility tax, Caldwell also said, is the only significant revenue source 
that will stabilize the General Fund, out of which most salaries are paid. Over 
the last two years, budget shortfalls have forced the layoff of more than 100 
people largely because of increased costs and the failure of redevelopment 
projects to generate anticipated revenues. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Legislature passed on new costs to the cities, Caldwell said 
after the vote. Lawmakers allowed counties, which desperately need money for 
social services, to begin charging cities for prisoners they put in the county 
jail and also to charge cities for collecting their property taxes. The jail 
fees alone, Caldwell said, could cost the city $150,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
The vote on the tax hike occurred at a special meeting of the council Monday 
afternoon, which was held immediately after a council workshop on the city's 
financial health. 
</P>
<P>
However, the council had decided more than a week earlier to schedule the 
emergency vote on the utility tax in order to beat the vote Tuesday on 
Proposition 136. The proposed constitutional amendment, which was defeated, 
would have required city or county governments to get voter approval to raise 
any taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia A. Moore was the only member of the council to vote against the tax 
hike. She said the council has a responsibility to find other ways to generate 
revenue. Compton is in such poor financial health because city leaders in the 
past mismanaged redevelopment, she said after the council vote on the tax. 
</P>
<P>
"We have spent millions of dollars redeveloping parts of the city but not seen 
any return on the money," Moore said. She cited as examples the transit center, 
which has failed to attract significant numbers of tenants; a hotel, which is 
not drawing enough business to generate revenue, and the auto plaza, which has 
only one dealership left. 
</P>
<P>
"So who has to now help the city stay solvent? The taxpayers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Moore also said she was upset that the council had passed the tax at a special 
meeting designed to circumvent Proposition 136, which she said reflected 
legitimate concerns of the taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Moore is one of three council members seeking to replace Mayor Walter R. 
Tucker, who died last month of cancer. A special mayoral election will be held 
in April. Her two mayoral rivals on the council, Bernice Woods and Maxcy D. 
Filer, voted for the tax hike. 
</P>
<P>
"It's needed by the city and that's the only reason we enacted it," Filer said 
after the utility tax vote. 
</P>
<P>
He said he did not worry about a probable voter backlash against him and the 
rest of the council because it voted on the utility tax the day before the 
statewide vote on Proposition 136. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thinking of the total city," Filer said. "I studied the issue. I don't 
look to the election to see how I'm going to vote." 
</P>
<P>
In Lynwood, about 200 residents tried to squeeze into the tiny council chambers 
Tuesday to protest the city's passage of a 10% utility tax last week. Los 
Angeles County sheriff's deputies removed two people, and others demonstrated 
outside the building. 
</P>
<P>
More than 10 residents spoke to the council, urging officials to rescind the 
tax. Council members scheduled a public hearing on the issue at 5:50 p.m. 
Monday in Bateman Hall, a large auditorium in the city's civic center. Some 
council members indicated they would be willing to reduce the tax percentage.

NO SURPRISES IN VOTING: INCUMBENTS WIN EASILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
A national push to "throw the rascals out" didn't materialize in Southeast-area 
congressional races this year. 
</P>
<P>
Seven incumbents, some of them fending off spirited attacks by challengers, won 
reelection by solid margins in Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a conservative Long Beach Republican, won handily 
despite being stung in recent weeks by allegations that he used drugs as a 
youth and by the defeat in Congress of his proposal to withhold federal funding 
for art he considers obscene. Rohrabacher defeated political science instructor 
Guy Kimbrough in District 42, which stretches from Huntington Beach to 
Torrance. Rohrabacher also defeated Kimbrough two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been a very outspoken congressman," Rohrabacher said. "If I can do that 
and still have a solid victory, it's a signal from the voters to our elected 
leaders that they should come out with strong stands." 
</P>
<P>
Four Democratic incumbents and two other Republican lawmakers easily prevailed 
in Southeast-area congressional races over an array of opponents. 
</P>
<P>
The only non-incumbent elected was Maxine Waters, a veteran Democratic 
assemblywoman who recorded a lopsided victory in District 29 to succeed the 
retiring Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles). Hawkins has occupied the 
seat in the heavily Democratic district since 1962. The district covers 
South-Central Los Angeles, South Gate, Huntington Park and part of Downey. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher's race against Democratic challenger Kimbrough heated up following 
the allegations of drug use, which first appeared in an article in New Republic 
magazine. But on Tuesday the congressman said the drug issue wasn't a factor 
because "it was so long ago." 
</P>
<P>
He called the controversial debate over funding for the National Endowment for 
the Arts a "wash" in the election. "It alienated some wealthy Republicans who 
go to the symphony," Rohrabacher said, "but it gave me support from some of the 
blue-collar Democrats." 
</P>
<P>
In his second term in Congress, he said, he plans to concentrate on expanding 
the opportunities for employee ownership of companies in the United States and 
developing a plane that will take off from a runway and fly into space. 
</P>
<P>
"Whichever nation controls that technology will dominate the world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran Rep. Glenn M. Anderson (D-San Pedro) also rolled up a solid victory, 
despite being accused by his challenger of being a once-vigorous legislator who 
no longer had the energy to do the job after serving 11 terms. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a little tougher election, especially for incumbents," said Anderson, 
77, whose victory margin was a bit smaller than two years ago. "Normally when 
we have elections we don't have several hundred thousand troops someplace where 
there might be a war. People are unhappy about that and there was lots of press 
about throwing the rascals out." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who defeated Republican Sanford Kahn, said he didn't believe voters 
were swayed by the attack on the veteran lawmaker's ability to do the job. "I 
feel I'm much better now than I was 10 years ago," Anderson said. "I know more 
about the problems." 
</P>
<P>
District 32 covers San Pedro, Harbor City, Wilmington, Lakewood and parts of 
Long Beach and Downey. 
</P>
<P>
At a victory celebration at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles, Waters, 52, told 
a crowd of about 300 cheering supporters that she was going to Congress to 
continue fighting for the poor and disadvantaged as she had done during her 14 
years in the state Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to do what I've always done," she said. "I'm going to be a voice for 
the people who sent me." 
</P>
<P>
One of her first priorities, she said, will be passing a civil rights measure. 
President Bush recently vetoed the Civil Rights Acts of 1990 and the move to 
override his veto failed by one vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I plan to talk with all of (the congressmen) and let them know that we're not 
going away on this issue of civil rights," Waters said. "I'm going to fight and 
fight and fight to ensure that we pass a civil rights bill." 
</P>
<P>
Waters' Republican opponent, Bill DeWitt, a former South Gate councilman, said 
he had no illusions about winning in a district where Democrats outnumber 
Republicans 7 to 1. "I went into it with my eyes open," he said. "I knew the 
demographics and statistics. I ran because there was an opening and no 
Republican had filed. I had fun." 
</P>
<P>
Other Democratic winners included Matthew G. Martinez of Monterey Park, who 
defeated businessman Reuben D. Franco in District 30; Mervyn M. Dymally of 
Compton, who won handily over former Long Beach councilwoman Eunice N. Sato in 
District 31, and Esteban E. Torres of La Puente, who easily fended off a 
challenge by John Eastman, an official with a Newport Beach land investment 
company. 
</P>
<P>
On the Republican side, David Dreier of La Verne defeated Georgia Houston Webb, 
a college admissions official, in District 33, and in District 38, Republican 
Robert K. Dornan of Garden Grove outdistanced Barbara Jackson, public affairs 
director for Planned Parenthood in Santa Ana. Though her name remained on the 
ballot, Jackson had dropped out of the race early and did not campaign.

ANTI-INCUMBENT MOVE NEVER MATERIALIZES; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: NORWALK ASSEMBLYMAN BOB EPPLE WAS EXPECTED TO HAVE A BATTLE BUT WON 
HANDILY. FOUR OTHER INCUMBENTS ALSO SCORED EASY VICTORIES. 
</P>

<P>
Assemblyman Bob Epple (D-Norwalk) had just declared victory early Wednesday 
morning when he laid out his legislative agenda for his second term in 
Sacramento -- fight drugs and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to work to make sure we have the resources in (the 63rd District), 
that includes law enforcement and education," Epple said at his victory 
celebration in Santa Fe Springs. 
</P>
<P>
The race for the 63rd District Assembly seat was supposed to be a battle but 
turned out to be more of a massacre as Epple easily defeated Republican Diane 
P. Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
The 63rd District includes Artesia, Cerritos, Downey, Hawaiian Gardens, Santa 
Fe Springs, most of Norwalk, and parts of Lakewood, southern and eastern 
Whittier and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Epple won his first term two years ago by a mere 220 votes over 
then-Assemblyman Wayne Grisham. The race was so close that it took election 
officials two weeks to count all the ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans were expected to push hard to recapture Epple's seat because of the 
slim margin. The conservative nature of the district's Democrats also makes the 
63rd District attractive to Republicans. Democrats outnumber Republicans 55.7% 
to 36.3% in the district, but have provided crossover votes in the past that 
accounted for GOP victories. 
</P>
<P>
Epple, 41, had geared up for a tough fight, amassing more than $291,000 for the 
race, according to campaign disclosure statements. 
</P>
<P>
The former Cerritos College trustee spent his evenings during the past couple 
of months walking precincts in the district and attending community functions. 
He ran as a law-and-order candidate and called attention to his "drug-free 
zone" legislation, which stiffens penalties for anyone convicted of selling, 
using or possessing drugs near schools. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs, a Downey councilwoman, acknowledged she was running uphill when she 
announced her candidacy earlier this year. She used $50,000 of her own money to 
jump-start her campaign and hoped to pick up strong Republican Party support. 
</P>
<P>
That appeared to be the case when the California Republican Party sent out a 
mailer, signed by Gov. George Deukmejian, listing the 63rd District race as one 
it would target. But strong party help never arrived -- Boggs was able to raise 
only $74,876, including her own $50,000, according to a campaign disclosure 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Four other incumbents and four new assemblymen -- two Democrats and two 
Republicans -- scored easy, and anticipated, victories Tuesday in area races. 
The newcomers won seats that were vacated by incumbents, who moved on to higher 
offices and other endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
The much-ballyhooed prediction that voters, tired of the status quo, were going 
to oust incumbents never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Willard H. Murray Jr. (D-Paramount) easily won a second term in the 
54th District. Republican Emily Hart-Holifield, a 49-year-old Compton College 
trustee, had the breakdown of registered voters and a lack of funds working 
against her. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats account for 64.1% of the registered voters in the 54th District, 
while Republicans represent 28%. Murray, 59, raised $80,953, while 
Hart-Holifield had $17,145, according to campaign disclosure statements. 
</P>
<P>
Libertarian Arthur C. Olivier and Peace and Freedom candidate Norman E. Lynn 
finished well back. 
</P>
<P>
The 54th District includes Compton, Paramount, Lakewood, Bellflower and a small 
part of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In the 57th Assembly District, incumbent Dave Elder (D-San Pedro) won a seventh 
term in Sacramento by beating Republican challenger Rodney D. Guarneri. 
</P>
<P>
Guarneri, a welfare case worker from Long Beach, surprised some of his 
supporters by disclosing at an Oct. 25 candidates' forum that he had used and 
sold drugs as a youth. 
</P>
<P>
But the poorly funded and little-known challenger's chances of victory were 
already slim. The longtime incumbent raised more than $120,000, while Guarneri 
raised less than $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Elder also benefited from the district's voter registration: Democrats 
outnumber Republicans 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
The 57th District covers much of Long Beach, San Pedro, Wilmington and Harbor 
City. 
</P>
<P>
Party registration and fund raising also weighed decisively in four area 
districts that had no incumbents seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
The most bitter of those races was in the 52nd District that stretches from La 
Mirada and Whittier into the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Paul V. Horcher, a Diamond Bar councilman, used more than $300,000 
of his own money to score a victory over Democrat Gary Neely, a marketing 
consultant from Diamond Bar. The seat was vacated when Frank Hill (R-Whittier) 
was elected to the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Voter registration in the district is 48.1% Republican and 42% Democrat. But a 
bitter primary left Republican voters fragmented and Horcher tried to unify the 
party. Two Republican groups came out in opposition to Horcher, whom they 
accused of flip-flopping on various issues. In addition, three of Horcher's 
Republican primary opponents refused to endorse him, saying he had alienated 
them with his campaign tactics. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the race, Neely, a marketing consultant, had hoped to benefit from a 
divided Republican party. On Monday, he claimed that 30% of the Republicans his 
campaign contacted by telephone said they would vote for Neely. 
</P>
<P>
But the anti-Horcher camp wasn't influential enough to defeat Horcher, who 
stressed that he favors abortion rights and portrayed himself as an 
environmentalist. 
</P>
<P>
Horcher raised $441,740, and Neely raised $32,589. 
</P>
<P>
In the 58th District Assembly race, Republican Thomas J. Mays defeated Luanne 
Pryor, a Long Beach public relations executive and longtime community activist. 
The 58th District seat was vacated by Dennis Brown (R-Los Alamitos), who left 
after six terms to become a minister. 
</P>
<P>
The odds were against Pryor, a Democrat seeking a seat in a district where 
voter registration is 50% Republican and 39% Democratic. Mays, the mayor of 
Huntington Beach, also outspent Pryor by more than 3 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
A third candidate, Libertarian Scott Stier, trailed with only a small 
percentage of the votes. 
</P>
<P>
The district includes parts of Long Beach and Huntington Beach, and all of Seal 
Beach, Signal Hill and Santa Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
The battle between two political newcomers for the 59th Assembly District ended 
as little more than a cake walk for Democrat Xavier Becerra, a deputy district 
attorney who ran a law-and-order campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Drawing upon support from Democratic voters who vastly outnumber Republicans, 
Becerra, 32, won his first political seat over Republican Lee Lieberg, 27. 
</P>
<P>
He will take the office formerly held by state Sen. Charles M. Calderon 
(D-Whittier), who in April won a special state Senate election to replace 
Joseph B. Montoya. Montoya resigned after being convicted of political 
corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
Becerra's war chest swelled to nearly $220,000, while Lieberg raised about 
$15,000. 
</P>
<P>
The 59th Assembly District includes Alhambra, Montebello, Monterey Park, and 
parts of Pico Rivera and Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, Marguerite Archie-Hudson won an easy victory over Republican 
Gloria Salazar in the 48th Assembly District, replacing Maxine Waters. Waters, 
who held the seat for 14 years, was elected to Congress on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Voter registration proved decisive: Democrats outnumber Republicans 8 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
Archie-Hudson said she would concentrate on legislation dealing with job 
training, education programs and economic development of small businesses in 
the district, which includes Lynwood, South Gate and South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Maxine began the process and I'm going to pick up the mantle and carry it on," 
said Archie-Hudson, a former chief of staff for Assembly Speaker Willie Brown 
(D-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
In the area's final two Assembly races, Assemblywomen Lucille Roybal-Allard 
(D-Los Angeles) and Teresa P. Hughes (D-Los Angeles) ran uncontested. 
</P>
<P>
Roybal-Allard has held her seat since 1987. Her 56th District includes 
Commerce, Maywood, Bell Gardens, Vernon and part of East Los Angeles. Hughes 
has been in office since 1975. Her 47th District covers Huntington Park, Bell, 
Cudahy and parts of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
There were three races for state Senate in the Long Beach and Southeast areas; 
the incumbents won easily. 
</P>
<P>
The districts include parts of Bell Gardens, Commerce, Maywood, Montebello, 
Pico Rivera, Paramount and parts of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In the 30th Senate District, incumbent Ralph C. Dills (D-Gardena) won a seventh 
four-year term by defeating little-known Republican Timothy Poling. 
</P>
<P>
Dills asserted that the results in his and other state Assembly and Senate 
races showed that despite the passage of tough legislative term limits Tuesday, 
voters are pleased with their individual lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
"The attitude was, 'Throw the rascals out, but don't throw my legislator out,' 
" Dills said on election night. "This puts the lie to the so-called voter 
dissatisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
In the 24th Senate district, Republican opposition attacks on incumbent Art 
Torres' (D-Los Angeles) drunk-driving convictions evidently had little impact 
as Torres beat Republican Keith Marsh. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh, 47, had hoped to score points against Torres by sending out mailers that 
highlighted Torres' problems with alcohol. Torres was arrested twice on 
suspicion of drunk driving, but has undergone treatment for alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
Torres said he plans to concentrate on alternatives to the extension of the 
Long Beach Freeway through Pasadena and plans for the Los Angeles River basin. 
</P>
<P>
In the 26th Senate district, Calderon, who in April won a special election to 
fill the seat of Montoya, won the right to serve a full term as senator in the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon, 40, who had served as state assemblyman until April, faced weak 
challenges from Republican Joe Aguilar Urquidi and Libertarian Kim Goldsworthy. 
Calderon had defeated both Urquidi and Goldsworthy in the April primary.

PLAY REHEARSAL IS LESSON ON REAL-LIFE HOMELESSNESS 
</P>

On the small stage of Long Beach Wilson High School's theater, a group of drama 
students portrays destitute people living in a train station. But for this 
production, the young actors did more than just rehearse the part. 
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the play, the students spent a day at a homeless shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"It really touched our hearts," drama student Jeniffer McCraine said. "We found 
out not all homeless people are on drugs or choose to be that way. They really 
don't have any place to go." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, McCraine and about 15 classmates helped prepare and serve meals, 
and talked to people living at the Long Beach Rescue Mission. Their teacher, 
Randy Bowden, said he wanted his students to research their characters by 
dealing directly with the people they are portraying. In the process, he also 
wanted to teach them about a serious social problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an educator, and that's part of their education here," Bowden said. 
"They've been affected by this. They made the human connection." 
</P>
<P>
The Wilson High drama department periodically presents plays dealing with 
social problems. Last year, a school production focused on teen-age suicide, 
which led to several group discussions with members of the audience after the 
shows, Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
The school also has put on plays about handicapped people and mental 
retardation. To research those subjects, the students volunteered their time at 
the local Veterans Administration hospital and at a school for children with 
learning disabilities, Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
"These are very current issues and the students are wide open to them," Bowden 
said. "We're also educating the audience. They are touched by this, too." 
</P>
<P>
The latest play, "In the Middle of Grand Central Station," opened last weekend 
in the school's Rainbow Playhouse, a small theater with a Greenwich 
Village-type atmosphere. A second cast will be featured in the concluding 
performances this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The play, based on a true story, deals with the life of a 15-year-old homeless 
girl living in New York's Grand Central Station, which she describes as a place 
where the rates are reasonable, there's no commute and the decor is done by "le 
public works." 
</P>
<P>
The homeless girl is nicknamed "The Angel of Grand Central" by other homeless 
people because she helps them before she helps herself. 
</P>
<P>
McCraine, who played the protagonist last weekend, said that she prepared for 
her role by dressing like a bum and strolling through downtown Long Beach with 
a friend who was better attired. The reception she received was less than 
friendly. 
</P>
<P>
"People were looking at me strangely. One lady refused to stand next to me at a 
checkout line. It really hurt my feelings, because I wasn't expecting that," 
McCraine said. 
</P>
<P>
As with the other students, McCraine said she also was influenced by her 
experiences at the shelter, especially after talking with a woman who was there 
because her stepfather tried to molest her. "She said that instead of killing 
him and going to jail, she left the house," McCraine said. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the students said they wanted to volunteer again, and the group has 
held a couple of donation drives for the rescue mission. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so much more sensitive to them now. I'm not scared to approach homeless 
people now, because I know they're not all crazy," McCraine said. 
</P>
<P>
The students had watched several videos about the homeless, and they had held 
class discussions. But for most, this was the first time they talked with 
homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of hard. I felt scared," said student Jose Ramirez, who was a 
policeman in the play. "I didn't know what to expect. But they were nice." 
Ramirez said he talked to a man who spoke of returning to Texas. "He said he 
came here and lost everything." 
</P>
<P>
Before visiting the shelter, several students said their typical reaction to 
the sight of homeless people was to look away. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to sort of just pass them by," said student Donald Straub, who played a 
mentally ill homeless man who had once been a college professor. "But now, 
whenever I see one of them, I realize they're humans too. It's made me more 
aware that more needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
"(Becoming homeless) could happen to anyone," Ramirez said. "I didn't used to 
think that." 
</P>
<P>
After the show Saturday night, Bowden thanked the crew and reminded the 160 
people crowded into the theater that "it doesn't take a lot between where we 
are and where they are." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

public Saturday and attracted enthusiastic visitors, attributed in part at 
least by the heightened interest in military activities since the Persian Gulf 
crisis. Nicolaas Lyke, 6, of Lakewood, protected with earmuffs and goggles,

tie-down holes on the deck, top right. Sailor Richard Radeke, below right, 
explains the ship's mission to a group on the deck. Free tours are offered on 
the first and third Saturdays of the month from noon to 4 p.m. Entrance is 
through Gate 17 off Ocean Boulevard on Terminal Island. The next scheduled ship 
visitation is Nov. 17 aboard the Ingraham, a guided missile frigate. MARC

VOTERS PASS FIREWORKS BAN, REJECT HIGHER FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bellflower voters have said no to higher business license fees, while Cerritos 
voters said no more Fourth of July fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos voters on Tuesday rejected an advisory ballot measure that sought to 
continue the sale and use of the holiday novelty items. Fireworks companies had 
waged a campaign against a ban. 
</P>
<P>
Although the vote on Proposition G was advisory, the Cerritos City Council has 
promised to abide by the results. 
</P>
<P>
A last-minute campaign by a handful of community activists was credited with 
helping pass the ban. Cerritos Citizens For Safety assembled last week and 
passed out about 2,000 flyers telling residents that even "safe and sane" 
fireworks were dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people were really ready for (a ban)," said Leora Einson, who helped 
organize the effort. "We just live so close together here and we don't have 
room to take a chance with everything catching fire." 
</P>
<P>
For two summers, houses in Cerritos have been destroyed after fireworks ignited 
their roofs. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-fireworks faction distributed literature telling voters that in cities 
where "safe and sane" fireworks have been banned, unsafe devices have been used 
and resulted in an increase of fires. 
</P>
<P>
Those who supported the continued sale of fireworks largely were affiliated 
with the various charitable and civic groups that sell the fireworks each 
summer to help finance their activities. 
</P>
<P>
In Bellflower, Proposition E was defeated handily, despite strong backing from 
the Chamber of Commerce and the City Council, which put the measure on the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would have hiked business license fees from $25 to $100 a year and 
generated an estimated $400,000 in revenues for the city. This marks the third 
time in three years that Bellflower voters have rejected a proposed increase in 
the business license fee. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very disappointed that it was unable to pass," Councilman Bob Stone said 
Wednesday. "I really don't understand the thinking of some of the voters." 
</P>
<P>
Stone said he and other council members worked hard to inform voters that the 
state is cutting aid to cities, that most Bellflower business owners do not 
live in the city, and that business license fees have not been raised since 
1973. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us on the council felt pretty secure that we would be able to get this 
business license fee," Stone said.

ILLEGITIMATE SON CLAIMS VICTORY IN FATHER'S DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A candidate for Downey Municipal Court judge whose illegitimate son campaigned 
against him was defeated in Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
Observers, however, were unable to agree on whether Leo R. Villa's son was 
instrumental in causing Villa's loss Tuesday to trial lawyer David W. Perkins. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Villa, a 62-year-old part-time court commissioner and retired deputy 
district attorney, was the target of a campaign waged by his son, Richard L. 
Villa, who was born out of wedlock 34 years ago. Richard Villa said he was 
angry because his father has seen him only twice and barely acknowledges his 
existence. Three weeks ago he took to the streets of Downey, Norwalk and La 
Mirada, posting more than 400 campaign signs that read, "Leo R. Villa's son 
says vote no on Villa." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Villa attributed his father's defeat to his campaign. He said, "(It) 
looks like voters are looking at morals as an issue when electing a judge, and 
my campaign was effective." 
</P>
<P>
But Perkins downplayed any effect Richard Villa's campaign might have had on 
the race. "I don't think it (the campaign) had that much to do with the final 
result . . . . My perception is that I would have won anyway. If I am going to 
win, I win because of my record." Perkins added that he was not involved with 
Richard Villa's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Perkins said voters based their decision on his experience in civil and 
criminal law. Leo Villa's background is mainly in prosecution. "I think voters 
wanted someone with a wider range of experience," Perkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Villa could not be reached for comment.

AIMING FOR AN 'IOWA BY THE SEA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Does the city of Long Beach need to spend $16 million on banners, painted logos 
and "barriers" to hide dangerous-looking buildings (Times, Nov. 4)? Does 
changing the language we use to refer to downtown Long Beach give the 
appearance of improvement? This has got to be the most bonehead idea that the 
City Fathers have ever pursued. 
</P>
<P>
Especially when in the same section of the paper was an article titled "Murders 
Up 25% in L.B. from the same period in '89." Instead of spending $16 million to 
give the appearance of an interesting and livable city, use the money to 
improve the police force. Maybe "Iowa by the Sea" is something to strive for.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
TO EXTEND CONSUMER AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a vote of 375 to 41, the House sent to the White House a bill to keep the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission alive with budgets of $42 million in fiscal 
1991 and $45 million in 1992. President Bush was expected to sign the measure 
(S605). 
</P>
<P>
The agency has been slowed in its mission by battles between consumer and 
business interests over how far it should go to keep hazardous products off the 
market. This bill makes it easier for it to obtain a quorum to conduct 
business. Among other provisions, it requires manufacturers to inform the panel 
if they lose a threshold number of lawsuits over their products, and mandates 
safety standards for a few risky products, including garage door openers and 
cigarette lighters that are easily ignited by children. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Doug Walgren (D-Pa.) said the bill has strong backing from consumer 
groups and the agency itself. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Howard C. Nielson (R-Utah) said: "The bill outrageously mismanages, 
micromanages, this agency." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to reauthorize the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

Immigration Reform 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 264 to 118, the House gave final congressional approval of a bill 
(S358) reforming the process of legal immigration into the United States. 
President Bush was expected to sign the bill, under which the current limit of 
500,000 immigrants annually will be raised to 700,000 between 1992-94, then 
drop permanently to 650,000. The majority of the new visas will go to people 
with needed job and professional skills or who come from European and African 
countries that have had low quotas in recent decades. One innovation is a 
set-aside of 10,000 visas each year for investors of at least $1 million in 
new, job-creating businesses in America. 
</P>
<P>
The bill eases restrictions based on ideology and sexual preference, gives the 
Department of Health and Human Services power to admit immigrants who may be 
infected with AIDS, and is more protective than current law of political 
refugees from El Salvador and elsewhere in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to pass the immigration reform bill.

Clean Air 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 401 to 25, the House gave its final approval of a bill (S1630) 
accelerating federal efforts to make the air healthier to breathe, protect the 
Earth's ozone layer against further depletion and curb the damage acid rain 
inflicts on lakes and forests. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush was set to sign the first upgrade of the Clean Air Act in 13 
years. Supported by much of the business community and environmentalists, the 
750-page measure relies on economic incentives and tough civil and criminal 
penalties to achieve its goals. The bill curbs toxic emissions from motor 
vehicles, power plants, factories, dry cleaners and all other significant 
contributors to air pollution. It seeks to cut acid rain by curbing high-sulfur 
coal emissions from Midwestern power plants, mandates cleaner gasolines and 
tighter exhaust controls on motor vehicles, and requires the more than 100 
cities with the dirtiest air to lower pollution to acceptable levels over the 
next five to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote supported the bill.

49ERS' CENTER GROWS IN MUSCLE, MATURITY; GLENN TO PLAY FOR TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal State Long Beach basketball team, a group of talented players who seem 
fast as ever despite cumbersome-looking new black shoes, performed in an 
intra-squad game last Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The star with 51 points was Lucious Harris, the 6-foot-5 guard who was the Big 
West Conference's freshman of the year last season. 
</P>
<P>
But almost as eye-catching to the fans who filled the stands on one side of the 
university gym was Frankie Edwards. The 6-8 center has increased his size to 
blacksmith proportions since last March when the 49ers lost to the University 
of Hawaii in the National Invitation Tournament in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to break a backboard, he's got the arms to do it," a spectator said 
after Edwards, up 25 pounds to 250, assaulted the basket with a powerful dunk. 
</P>
<P>
In scoring 22 points, Edwards also displayed finesse. He hit soft half-hook 
shots and showed the moves he learned the last two years from Seth Greenberg, 
who is now the head coach. 
</P>
<P>
After the scrimmage, Greenberg said Edwards and Harris are the only two players 
who have won starting positions. 
</P>
<P>
Of Edwards, a junior whom Greenberg recruited from Millikan High School, the 
coach said: "He's probably worked harder to develop his body and his game than 
anyone on the team. We had a strength and conditioning program over the summer, 
and Frankie took it like a religion." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards' fanaticism extended beyond that program. "I hung around with my 32 
cousins; they all lift weights," said the native Samoan. "We'd lift in gyms or 
back yards. One of my cousins has 24-inch arms." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, who has 19-inch arms, has expanded more than his body, and appears to 
be better equipped to handle the highs and lows of a long season. 
</P>
<P>
"I've grown a lot as far as maturity," he said, crediting time spent with 
Greenberg and assistant coach Matt Ruiz over the summer. "When I wasn't playing 
well (last season), I'd get mad and take it out on my teammates." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, after losing the ball or making a bad pass or trying an 
ill-advised shot, Edwards would lose his composure and have to be benched. As a 
result, he played only about 16 minutes a game last season, averaging 5 points 
and 4 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We spent a lot of time with him just talking about growing up and being more 
mature," Greenberg said. "You can't coach a kid unless you really know him. You 
have to make him realize he's more than just a basketball player." 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg said he anticipates Edwards' playing 30 minutes a game and averaging 
between 15 and 20 points and 7 and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"He gives us a dominating presence inside, he's our Karl Malone," said 
Greenberg, referring to the star of the Utah Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards doubts that he will shatter a backboard, although the thought still 
brightens his eyes. "I used to dream about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers will play an exhibition game at 7:30 p.m. Saturday against Taby, a 
professional team from Stockholm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wounded Player Gives Inspiration to Glenn 
</P>
<P>
The Glenn High School football team may have an inspirational edge tonight when 
it plays intracity rival Norwalk for the Suburban League title in La Mirada 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Attending the game on crutches will be Robert Ernster, a senior linebacker and 
tight end who is recovering from gunshot wounds to his legs. 
</P>
<P>
Ernster, one of the team's three best players, was shot by three suspected gang 
members Oct. 19 in the parking lot of a Santa Fe Springs hotel where he and 
some teammates were continuing a celebration of a 13-7 victory hours earlier 
over La Mirada. Authorities said the players were innocent bystanders mistaken 
for rival gang members by the assailants 
</P>
<P>
For Glenn Coach Willie Norman, it was not the first time one of his players had 
been shot. In May of 1989, Juan (Chaka) Enriquez, who had been a teammate of 
Ernster, was killed in a drive-by shooting in the barrio section of Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little tough when your kids get hurt out on the street," Norman, 38, 
said at the school this week. "I'm tired of looking into the faces of moms and 
dads after something like this. I've done it twice now, I don't know if I can 
do it again. There's nothing you can tell them." 
</P>
<P>
But in the face of heartbreak and a roster size of only 30, the Eagles, 8-1 
overall and 4-0 in the league, keep winning. 
</P>
<P>
"They're extremely dedicated," Norman said. "They have an overall concern for 
the program. Our strength is togetherness." 
</P>
<P>
This is a special group for Norman, a former assistant coach at El Rancho who 
has coached Glenn for four seasons. The 25 seniors were freshmen when Norman 
was new at the Norwalk school. He is proud that, to his knowledge, none of his 
players is in gangs. "I like to think we offer them opportunities to do 
something else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Norman said the shooting of Ernster was, at first, emotionally devastating to 
the team. "A lot of the kids had been there and saw it," he said. "They were in 
shock. Now we're starting to focus more on the original objective. We go see 
Robert every day." 
</P>
<P>
Lately, additional misfortune has befallen the team. Paseko Teo, a hard-running 
back and an emotional leader, is doubtful for tonight's game because of a 
separated shoulder that has prevented him from playing the last two games. In a 
21-20 victory over Mayfair last Friday night, Norman said: "We had to hold onto 
him to keep him from going in last week." 
</P>
<P>
Star back Jerry Jornadal has strained knee ligaments and could also miss the 
big game. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been rough the last three weeks," Norman said. "We're missing three 
all-leaguers, but we're going to show up anyway." 
</P>
<P>
If Norwalk (7-1, 3-1) wins, the teams will have tied for the title for the 
second consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
If Glenn wins, the Eagles are not likely to go out celebrating as they did 
after beating La Mirada. "What happened has made us stay home, that's for 
sure," Norman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Valley Christian Coach Records 100th Victory 
</P>
<P>
Mike Wunderley, football coach at Valley Christian High School, recorded his 
100th victory at the Cerritos school last Friday night as the Crusaders 
defeated Brethren, 33-21. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some good years and some good kids," said Wunderley, 44, who has a 
100-39-1 record in 12 seasons at Valley Christian. He has won five Olympic 
League titles and a CIF championship. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Crusaders (4-5) had a rare off-year this season, Wunderley said, 
"I'm still having a good time. I don't envision going anyplace else, but I 
don't envision doing this forever either." 
</P>
<P>
Wunderley said that one of his most valued assets has been Rich DeBie, who has 
been an assistant coach all 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
It was homecoming last week at Valley Christian, an event that touched the 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw kids who are now at MIT or UCLA. You can't believe they're college 
seniors now. Time just moves on down the road." 
</P>

SLOW-GROWTH BACKERS STUMBLE IN CITY RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Slow-growth forces in Ventura County lost momentum Tuesday while incumbents and 
fiscal conservatives gained strength in eight city races that focused primarily 
on finances and growth issues. 
</P>
<P>
In Oxnard, Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley and Moorpark -- where issues of growth 
were prominent in the campaign -- officeholders widely viewed as advocates for 
strong or moderate growth retained their seats with comfortable margins. 
</P>
<P>
The exceptions were the victories of slow-growth candidates Elois Zeanah in 
Thousand Oaks and Margaret Ely in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Fiscal conservatives such as former Councilman Michael Plisky in the Oxnard 
City Council race and Charles K. (Ken) Gose in the Camarillo City Council race 
won big in cities plagued by financial woes. 
</P>
<P>
"The voters are saying they are not as interested in frills -- even important 
frills such as improving the ecological system -- as they are in keeping their 
jobs," Bill McAleer, chairman of the Ventura County National Bank, said of the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
The election results also seemed to be a blow to the political clout of 
Patagonia Inc., a Ventura clothing manufacturer that endorsed four slow-growth 
candidates in races throughout the county. The only Patagonia candidate to win 
was Zeanah. 
</P>
<P>
"Our problem is that environmentalists have failed to deal effectively with 
economic and fiscal issues. We need to find a solution," said Russ Baggerly, a 
spokesman for the Environmental Coalition of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Patagonia spokesman Kevin Sweeny said many voters were unaware of the Patagonia 
endorsements of slow-growth candidates because there were so many initiatives 
and candidates on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"Our support of candidates got lost in the crowd," Sweeny said. 
</P>
<P>
Countywide, voters elected 10 incumbents and two former council members, 
despite a perceived rise in anti-incumbent sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara campaign consultant John Davies, chief strategist for Oxnard 
Mayor Nao Takasugi, suggested that the anti-incumbent feelings were more a 
media perception than reality. "We've always hated Congress but loved our 
congressmen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
County election officials released semiofficial results Wednesday but said they 
would not have a final vote tally until today or later. 
</P>
<P>
In Oxnard, Takasugi was elected to his fifth term in office with a comfortable 
margin, despite criticism of his pro-growth policies. 
</P>
<P>
His closest challenger was Councilwoman Dorothy Maron, who said her campaign 
was the victim of the mayor's mudslinging, an allegation Takasugi denied. 
</P>
<P>
Plisky, a vocal advocate for financial responsibility in City Hall, will join 
three-term Councilman Manuel Lopez in filling two seats on the council. Ann 
Johs lost a bid for her second full term. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Weiss, the founder of a slow-growth movement who won Patagonia's support, 
finished sixth in a slate of 12. 
</P>
<P>
In the 4th District supervisorial race, Vicky Howard defeated fellow Simi 
Valley council member and next-door neighbor Bill Davis in a race that revealed 
few differences between the two on growth and other issues facing the east 
county. 
</P>
<P>
Howard's election to the county board was in sharp contrast to the election in 
June of Maria VanderKolk, a slow-growth advocate and political novice who won a 
surprising victory over incumbent Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer in the 2nd 
District. 
</P>
<P>
While VanderKolk opposed a proposal to have Simi Valley annex entertainer Bob 
Hope's Jordan Ranch, Howard supports the plan because of Hope's offer to sell 
and donate 5,700 acres of surrounding wilderness to park agencies if his 
development is approved. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who spent Wednesday morning cleaning out his campaign headquarters in a 
Simi Valley shopping center, sounded more relieved than disappointed with the 
election results. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to look at it realistically," said Davis, who has two years remaining 
on the City Council. "I think we did the best we could do, and we lost. That's 
all there is to it." 
</P>
<P>
In Simi Valley, incumbent Mayor Greg Stratton won a third term in office, while 
political novice Sandi Webb garnered the highest number of votes in the council 
race. 
</P>
<P>
Webb attributed her victory to local television ads and old-fashioned, 
door-to-door campaigning. "I walked my feet off and talked myself hoarse," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Mikels, chairwoman of the Planning Commission, had a slight edge over 
incumbent Councilwoman Ann Rock. Election officials, however, said there are 
enough uncounted absentee ballots to sway the final results. 
</P>
<P>
In Thousand Oaks, longtime, pro-growth Councilman Alex Fiore won the largest 
number of votes in a race that focused primarily on development and the 
construction of a new civic center. 
</P>
<P>
The two other council seats in Thousand Oaks will be filled by Zeanah, 
VanderKolk's former campaign manager, and Judy Lazar, a planning commissioner 
and advocate for moderate growth. 
</P>
<P>
In Moorpark, where growth and redevelopment of the city's downtown were the 
dominant issues, voters elected Paul W. Lawrason Jr. to be the city's first 
elected mayor. Lawrason beat Councilman Clint Harper, who was endorsed by 
Patagonia. 
</P>
<P>
John E. Wozniak, chairman of the city Planning Commission, won a council seat 
with a comfortable margin. 
</P>
<P>
In Camarillo, a city hard hit by state budget cuts, Gose will join incumbent 
Charlotte Craven and former Councilman Stanley J. Daily to fill three council 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Paula, where candidates shared a vision of creating more jobs by 
strengthening the town's retail and light industry sectors, voters reelected 
16-year incumbent John A.F. Melton to the council, along with Planning 
Commissioner Wayne Johnson and Margaret Ely, a legal assistant. 
</P>
<P>
In Fillmore, where newcomers dominated the campaign and where growth was the 
main issue, Linda Brewster, a housewife, and Donald Gunderson, a retired Navy 
captain, were elected to fill two council seats. 
</P>
<P>
Port Hueneme voters gave big margins of victory to incumbent council members 
Dorill B. Wright, James F. (Jim) Daniels and Ken Hess.

A pair of Los Angeles men stopped for speeding by California Highway Patrol 
officers were arrested this morning in connection with a La Jolla jewelry store 
burglary, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Darrington and Kevin Smith, both 24, were taken into custody and 
booked on suspicion of burglary about 4:30 a.m., half an hour after they were 
stopped on the San Diego Freeway, CHP Officer Patti Gentile said. 
</P>
<P>
The two were later turned over to the San Diego Police Department, which is 
investigating the early morning looting of Slavick's Jewelry, where about 
$50,000 was taken, Gentile said. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the officers) made a speed stop and one thing led to another," Gentile 
said.

President Bush said today that he has ordered a new wave of U.S. troops to the 
Persian Gulf area to give the multinational military force there an "adequate 
offensive military option should that be necessary." 
</P>
<P>
The President's announcement at a White House news conference did not specify 
how many more American forces will be added to Operation Desert Shield, but 
Pentagon sources said it could be more than 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said the extra troops will include armored divisions from U.S. 
bases in Germany and possibly from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he does not need to get U.N. approval to launch a military action 
against Iraq but indicated that the Administration will first seek out that 
support. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we have the authority but we've been great believers in going to the 
United Nations," Bush said in a question-and-answer session after his 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he still holds out hope that the confrontation over Iraq's invasion 
and occupation of Kuwait can be settled short of war. But he also said he wants 
to give the American ground commander in Saudi Arabia, Gen. H. Norman 
Schwarzkopf, a credible offensive option. 
</P>
<P>
"I would love to see a peaceful resolution to this question and that's what I 
want," the President said as Defense Secretary Dick Cheney stood nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union today again gave its qualified approval to the use of military 
force to push Iraqi occupiers out of Kuwait if peaceful measures fail. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III came to Moscow seeking at least Soviet 
acquiescence to the Bush Administration's intention of having the U.N. Security 
Council authorize the use of force to liberate Kuwait as a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether or not the use of force could be ruled out -- probably this could not 
be ruled out -- and a situation may emerge which effectively would require such 
a move," Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said after talks with 
Baker. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze stressed that any decision to use force against the Iraqis should 
be taken by the United Nations. "We should not doubt the ability of the 
Security Council to take wise and mature decisions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker also met with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at his official 
country residence outside the city and had sessions with Shevardnadze before 
and after that meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile today, it was learned that Saddam Hussein has dismissed his military 
chief of staff for opposing the occupation of Kuwait and analysts said the move 
indicates growing dissension in his armed forces hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi army's Al Qadissiya daily reported that Lt. Gen. Nazir al Khazraji, 
chief of staff since 1985, has been replaced by Gen. Hussein Rashid, commander 
of the elite 120,000-strong Republican Guards force. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper did not say what happened to Khazraji or when he was dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
But several Western military and intelligence sources said Khazraji had opposed 
the Kuwait occupation. They also believe that Hussein may be seeking to 
surround himself with relatives and loyalists as the standoff with the 
multinational gulf force enters its fourth month. 
</P>
<P>
A Western intelligence source said Rashid is a hard-liner in Iraq's Baath 
Socialist Party who would be expected to support Hussein's policies. Rashid had 
been Khazraji's deputy chief of staff for operations. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials in Washington said Rashid is considered a "very competent" 
commander who led an armored brigade in the 1980-88 war against Iran. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very ominous," said Hans-Heino Kopietz, a former analyst with London's 
International Institute for Strategic Studies who is now with Control Risks, an 
international security firm in London. 
</P>
<P>
"Khazraji's dismissal now is indicative of some opposition to (Hussein) within 
the military," Kopietz said.

BRITISH NOVELIST DURRELL DIES IN SOUTH OF FRANCE

<P>
Lawrence Durrell, the British novelist whose works evoked the exotic imagery of 
the Mediterranean, has died at his home in southern France, his family said 
today. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of his death on Wednesday was not disclosed. Durrell had been 
fatigued for about two weeks, a family member said. Durrell told the Washington 
Post in 1986 that he was suffering from emphysema. 
</P>
<P>
Durrell, who was a close friend of American novelist Henry Miller, died in 
Sommieres, a small town in the Provence region near the Mediterranean coast 
where he had lived for 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
His best-known work was the Alexandria Quartet series, the elements of which 
came from the time he spent in Alexandria, Egypt, during World War II. The 
novels, written from 1957 to 1960, were "Justine," "Balthazar," "Mountolive" 
and "Clea." 
</P>
<P>
Durrell's verse -- romantic, taut and often humorous -- began appearing in 
1938. It includes "Red Limbo Lingo" and "Vega and Other Poems." 
</P>
<P>
Durrell was born in 1912 in India and spent his boyhood in the northern city of 
Darjeeling near the Tibetan border. His father, an Irish-Protestant engineeer, 
had gone to India to help build the country's first railroads. 
</P>
<P>
Durrell said in a 1982 interview: 
</P>
<P>
"When I was looking back the other day to what the hell my career had been, I 
found I was really trying to find my way back to India. I think I really must 
have been marked by that enormous silence up in the mountains." 
</P>
<P>
At the age of 18, he left India for London, where he dabbled in jazz and poetry 
without much success. In 1935, he first encountered Greece, the inspiration for 
some of his works. 
</P>
<P>
Durrell moved to Corfu, an Ionian island off the west coast of Greece. It was 
from there he began a lengthy correspondence with Miller. Letters between the 
two were published in two volumes in 1963 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was the inspiration for his work "Bitter Lemons," written in 1957, while 
living in southeastern France. The book is a vivid, many-faceted account of 
Cyprus during the British-Turkish-Greek struggles there. 
</P>
<P>
It was also while living in France that Durrell wrote the Alexandria Quartet. 
The series -- written in a lush, baroque prose style -- took as its theme love 
as a means of self-discovery. 
</P>
<P>
Durrell once said: "I regard writing as a fascinating bore and wish it were 
better paid. I intended to die young and have the following words on my tomb: 
'Lawrence Durrell wishes you great passions and short lives.' If I die old it 
will only need altering one word."

A man considered a suspect in the slayings of five Gainesville college students 
should be put in a mental facility, not a prison, for beating his grandmother, 
a judge said today. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Theo Yawn told lawyers for both sides that he wants to consider 
sentencing alternatives for Edward Lewis Humphrey, 19, between the extremes of 
prison or freedom. 
</P>
<P>
He had been expected to sentence Humphrey today. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey was convicted last month of the Aug. 30 beating of his 79-year-old 
grandmother in Indialantic. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey, a sometime University of Florida student, has been labeled as one of 
several suspects in the murders of four college woman and one man, which took 
place in three separate instances near the university campus in Gainesville 
during the last week of August. But he has not been charged in those cases.

Albanian President Ramiz Alia has called for radical constitutional reform that 
would curb his party's power in Europe's last orthodox Communist state and 
could reopen mosques and churches shut for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
In a blunt speech that also painted a picture of economic woes, public 
disaffection and hard-line opposition to change, Alia warned a Communist 
Central Committee plenum in Tirana that the party must become more democratic 
to survive. 
</P>
<P>
His speech, carried in full by the official news agency ATA today, gave no hint 
that Albania will legalize opposition political parties and was tempered by a 
warning that reform has to be cautious to avoid "haste, passions, anarchy." 
</P>
<P>
But Alia's call for constitutional change that would redefine the party's 
leading role and scrap bans on religious worship and foreign investment marked 
his boldest departure yet from the rigid legacy of his Stalinist predecessor 
Enver Hoxha.

Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. is dropping personal auto and homeowners'

little hope for much improvement.

Aetna stopped selling new auto and homeowners' policies in New Mexico and Idaho 
Nov. 2. Starting in February, the company will not renew policies in New 
Mexico; in March it will not renew them in Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
The decision is the latest move by Aetna to improve dreary financial results in 
personal insurance lines nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Aetna has also stopped writing new personal auto policies in Rhode Island, and 
is challenging laws in Massachusetts that make it very expensive for the

Northern Telecom, a leading Canadian telecommunications firm, said today it has 
launched a $3.75-billion takeover offer for the British electronics firm STC, 
one of the biggest takeover bids this year. 
</P>
<P>
Northern Telecom already owns 27% of the British firm, and analysts had been 
expecting a full bid. 
</P>
<P>
The takeover would give Northern Telecom a foothold in the European markets for 
communications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
STC, involved in restructuring this year, is selling its ICL computer business 
to Fujitsu of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The takeover bid marks one of the largest of 1990 and one of the biggest 
cross-border deals ever in telecommunications.

NCAA PUTS MISSOURI BASKETBALL ON PROBATION

Missouri's basketball team was put on two years' probation today, banned from 
the NCAA Tournament in March and hit with severe restrictions on recruiting and 
scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
About an hour later, the school announced that assistant coaches Bob Sundvold 
and Rich Daly had both resigned, effective at the end of this season. 
</P>
<P>
Haskell Monroe Jr., Missouri chancellor, said at a news conference the coaches 
resigned voluntarily and that they would coach the current season because 
"there have been enough disruptions in the program." 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA said Missouri was guilty of major violations between 1985 and 1989 
concerning recruiting, benefits for athletes and academic irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the postseason ban for the 1990-91 season, Missouri cannot 
provide expense-paid recruiting visits during 1991; only one member of the 
coaching staff can engage in off-campus recruiting and evaluation for 1991; and 
the school can give only one basketball scholarship during the 1991-92 academic 
year and no more than two in 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, the NCAA placed the Illinois basketball program on probation for 
three years, including an NCAA Tournament ban next March. Also, the school is 
banned from off-campus basketball recruiting and from paying for visits by 
recruits to its campus the first year. The school also will be limited to 
awarding just two basketball scholarships in each of the first two seasons of 
the probation. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Smrt, NCAA director of enforcement, said the penalties against Missouri 
were lighter because the school had no history of NCAA violations and accepted 
responsibility for violations that were uncovered. Illinois was hit with NCAA 
sanctions five previous times since 1967. 
</P>

The probe began nearly two years ago into the basketball program of Norm 
Stewart, who has a 552-273 collegiate record in 29 years and a 455-231 record 
in 23 seasons at Missouri. He is the winningest Big Eight Conference basketball 
coach, with 197 victories. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA announcement said Stewart "delegated many of his responsibilities to 
his assistants, and neither the assistants nor the head coach maintained 
records, checks and balances or identifiable processes for institutional 
control, which could have been used to reconstruct their actions." 
</P>
<P>
Sundvold and Daly were not named in the NCAA release. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation began in February, 1989 after a tape-recorded conversation 
became public between Sundvold and the mother of former Missouri player P.J. 
Mays. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Stewart collapsed on the team plane en route to Oklahoma for a 
Big Eight Conference game. He missed the rest of the season while undergoing 
treatment for ulcers and colon cancer and Daly took over the team, directing it 
to victories in the first two rounds of the NCAA Tournament.

U.S. Open champion Pete Sampras withdrew from an indoor tennis tournament today 
with shin splints and said he may have to skip next week's ATP Finals in 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation is that my shin is as bad as it's ever been and I can't move to 
the ball like I'd like to," Sampras said. 
</P>
<P>
"If it stays as it is now, Frankfurt is up in the air." 
</P>
<P>
Sampras, of Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., who had been scheduled to play 
Christian Bergstrom in a second-round match today, said that he had experienced 
throbbing pain in his left shin for several days and that it was getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
Sampras had X-rays on Sunday that did not reveal a stress fracture, but doctors 
advised him to get a bone scan before playing again to determine if there was a 
micro-fracture. 
</P>
<P>
"If I played today, there could be a chance of more serious injury," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, fifth-seeded Aaron Krickstein was beaten 7-5, 6-4 by Peter 
Lundgren in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
No. 3 seed Michael Chang had more success than his American compatriot, 
advancing to the quarterfinals by defeating Jeremy Bates 6-3, 6-3.

Pro wrestler Andre the Giant was fined $100 for doing to a TV cameraman what he 
does to opponents in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
A judge found Andre Roussimoff guilty of criminal mischief for scuffling with 
Ben Hildebrandt last year after losing a match. The 7-foot-4, 540-pound 
wrestler on Tuesday was also ordered to pay $233 to KCRG-TV to fix the camera. 
</P>
<P>
The scuffle broke out when Roussimoff, who acted in the movie "The Princess 
Bride," contended that Hildebrandt videotaped the match without his permission. 
</P>
<P>
Hildebrandt said he was just shooting crowd scenes when the wrestler put him in 
a headlock. 
</P>
<P>
The judge found Roussimoff innocent of assault, saying the wrestler didn't mean 
to harm Hildebrandt.

Guitarist Pete Townshend of The Who says his 1980 song "Rough Boys" was a 
"coming out, an acknowledgment of the fact that I'd had a gay life." 
</P>
<P>
Townshend, who has been married to Karen Astley since 1966 and has three 
children, divulged his bisexuality in the book "Rock Lives: Profiles and 
Interviews." 
</P>
<P>
"I know how it feels to be a woman because I am a woman," Townshend said in the 
book, a collection of interviews by music writer and radio host Timothy White. 
It was released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Townshend said in September, 1989, on White's radio show that "Rough Boys" 
showed his aversion to the macho rock star ethos. 
</P>
<P>
He said the song meant "I understood what gay sex was about."

The artist daughter of Chinese Communist leader Deng Xiaoping, whose work was 
described by one Chinese official as "just average," is in Tokyo to publicize 
an exhibition of her paintings. 
</P>
<P>
The 13-day exhibition opening Tuesday at a gallery in Tokyo could earn Deng 
Lin, 49, an estimated $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Deng started painting in 1959, graduated from the Central Arts College in 
Beijing in 1967 and held her first overseas exhibition in Japan and New York in 
1979. Her favorite Western painter is Van Gogh. 
</P>
<P>
"Her standard is just average, not outstanding," a Chinese official at a 
publicity gathering said. "If she were not the daughter of her father, none of 
us would be here."

Comedian Bill Cosby isn't laughing about what he perceives as a media vendetta 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand why people are picking on me, and that's essentially what 
this stuff is," the entertainer said about media coverage after "The Cosby 
Show" dropped a mural from the NBC-TV series' opening credits. 
</P>
<P>
A Harlem teacher protested the use of her students' artwork as a backdrop so 
Cosby eliminated the offending opening credits using the background. Cosby 
complains the dispute was slanted by the media to attack him personally. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very, very upset and I'm not going to take this kind of treatment. 
Celebrities are very, very easy to take a shot at," Cosby told "A Current 
Affair."

HOW TO READ THE SCORES 
</P>
<P>
These are results of the California Assessment Program test for third, sixth 
and eighth grades. 
</P>
<P>
State officials say the scores are intended to provide a way to assess 
schoolwide academic performance. Students do not receive individual scores. 
</P>
<P>
Schools are listed alphabetically by district. Scores are scaled between 
approximately 100 and 400, although a few scores may be higher or lower. A 
school's scores may be compared to district and state averages. For example, if 
the third grade at your school scored 295 in math, and the state average is 
283, children at your school are performing at a higher level than most 
third-graders statewide. 
</P>
<P>
In general, a fluctuation of 10 points or less should not cause alarm, although 
state education officials say that the margin of error varies depending upon 
the size of the school. 
</P>
<P>
Students in grades three and six last spring were given multiple-choice tests 
in reading, written language (including grammar and spelling) and mathematics. 
Last spring's eighth-graders were tested in reading, math, history-social 
sciences and science. Eighth-graders also took an essay test to assess their 
writing skills. Results of the essay test are expected next month. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases a specialized or "magnet" school has its campus on the grounds of 
a regular school. State officials have combined the scores, so separate results 
are not available. 
</P>
<P>
Schools in this section generally are in the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and 
Antelope valleys. Scores for the rest of Los Angeles Unified will appear over 
the next several days. Additional scores will will appear in appropriate 
suburban sections over the next several days. 
</P>
<P>
Schools in this section generally are in the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and 
Antelope valleys. Scores for other area school districts appeared Thursday and 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STATEWIDE AVERAGES 
</P>
<P>
These statewide averages may be useful in comparing the performance of students 
in elementary and junior high or middle schools.

Results were mixed, and so were the responses of local administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Coeur d'Alene Avenue School in Venice got test scores that might have induced 
apoplexy in Beverly Hills, whose schools routinely rank among the state's best. 
But although Coeur d'Alene ranked in the bottom half of California schools, 
Principal Beth G. Ojena said she felt pretty good about the scores. 
</P>
<P>
As she pointed out, students at the Venice elementary school -- a quarter of 
them homeless and a third newly arrived immigrants -- showed slight to 
significant gains over last year in all areas tested: reading, written 
expression and mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
Coeur d'Alene sixth-graders did better than the Los Angeles Unified School 
District average. Ojena attributed some of the school's improvement to the 
donation last year of a writing-to-read laboratory that helps the youngest 
students get a good foundation in language skills. She also noted that the 
school, which has one of the highest homeless populations in the country, 
received a $50,000 grant from the Weingart Foundation that allowed it to hire a 
tutor for its transient students. 
</P>
<P>
Tutoring is especially important for homeless students, Ojena said. Learning is 
sequential, she pointed out, and homeless students often drop out of a 
particular school, sometimes for as long as a year. 
</P>
<P>
According to the principal, writing has become a schoolwide priority. Teachers 
try to have students write daily, whatever they are studying. Students also 
correct each other's written work as a way of developing editorial skills. 
</P>
<P>
Ojena said she believes that performance on the CAP tests has to be viewed in 
context. For a student who is preoccupied with adjusting to a new culture and 
mastering English, the tests may not be especially relevant. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that it's not important," she said. "It is. But when we test across 
the board, it's irrelevant to a lot of the kids, and that's why they test as 
low as they do." 
</P>
<P>
Given the complex needs of the student body, she said, "sometimes it's 
incredible to me we do as well as we do." 
</P>
<P>
Other administrators also urged that CAP scores be viewed in context. 
</P>
<P>
Vera Jashni, assistant superintendent for educational services for the Culver 
City Unified School District, said CAP scores can be a useful measure of how a 
school is doing, but only if other measures are also evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
"When you take any test in isolation, that's not good," she said. "It's only 
one part of the picture, and you've got to take the whole picture into 
consideration." 
</P>
<P>
Culver City's scores changed little from last year's, placing the district near 
the middle statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Jashni said her district looks at several measures in evaluating how well a 
school is performing. In addition to looking at CAP scores in written 
expression, for instance, the district may also evaluate portfolios that 
contain examples of students' writing over a period of time. 
</P>
<P>
Jashni said Culver City does no special preparation for CAP testing besides 
notifying parents and giving students the usual pre-test advice: Get a good 
night's sleep, eat breakfast and try to relax. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, she said, the district hopes test day won't be too hot or rainy. 
</P>
<P>
Either one brings down scores. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW TO READ THE SCORES 
</P>
<P>
These are results of the California Assessment Program test for third, sixth 
and eighth grades. 
</P>
<P>
State officials say the scores are intended to provide a way to assess 
schoolwide academic performance. Students do not receive individual scores. 
</P>
<P>
Schools are listed alphabetically by district. Scores are scaled between 
approximately 100 and 400, although a few scores may be higher or lower. A 
school's scores may be compared to district and state averages. For example, if 
the third grade at your school scored 295 in math, and the state average is 
283, children at your school are performing at a higher level than most 
third-graders statewide. 
</P>
<P>
In general, a fluctuation of 10 points or less should not cause alarm, although 
state education officials say that the margin of error varies depending upon 
the size of the school. 
</P>
<P>
Students in grades three and six last spring were given multiple-choice tests 
in reading, written language (including grammar and spelling) and mathematics. 
Last spring's eighth-graders were tested in reading, math, history-social 
sciences and science. Eighth-graders also took an essay test to assess their 
writing skills. Results of the essay test are expected next month. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases a specialized or "magnet" school has its campus on the grounds of 
a regular school. State officials have combined the scores, so separate results 
are not available. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SAMPLE QUESTION FOR SIXTH-GRADERS 
</P>
<P>
 Illustrative social studies passage: 
</P>
<P>
In 1860, a Midwestern stagecoach company let people know about an exciting new 
plan which would affect our entire country. The company planned a faster mail 
service to California -- the Pony Express, which would deliver the mail in 10 
days or less. 
</P>
<P>
Strong young men were the riders. Buffalo Bill was one of the famous ones. 
These men had to have courage. Every day they faced many kinds of danger. They 
had been told, "Remember, you travel alone and the country is wild and rugged. 
You may be cold, hungry, wet and tired, but you must go on! The mail must go 
through!" And it did go through! 
</P>
<P>
Over the saddle of the Pony Express horses was hung a leather blanket or 
"mochila." In the four pockets of it were the tissue-thin letters. Five dollars 
was the usual price for sending a letter. 
</P>
<P>
The route cut directly across from Missouri to Sacramento. Each rider rode 
nonstop for about 100 miles, and then a new rider took over. The horses used 
were chosen for speed and were changed every 10 miles. Quickly the mail was 
thrown over the saddle of the fresh horse, much like a relay race. Horses were 
saddled and ready to go at every station. With a leap, the rider was in the 
saddle -- and off like the wind! 
</P>
<P>
 Illustrative test questions: 
</P>
<P>
What do you think would usually happen when the rider reached Sacramento? 
</P>
<P>
a. He would go to New York. 
</P>
<P>
b. He would eat and rest. 
</P>
<P>
c. He would brand horses. 
</P>
<P>
d. He would meet Buffalo Bill. 
</P>
<P>
The "mochila" used by the Pony Express rider can best be compared to the 
</P>
<P>
a. sleeping bag used by the camper. 
</P>
<P>
b. sandpaper used by the carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
c. mail pouch used by the mail carrier. 
</P>
<P>
d. pen used to write and letter. 
</P>
<P>
You can conclude from the passage that 
</P>
<P>
a. someone at each station prepared a fresh horse for the rider. 
</P>
<P>
b. Buffalo Bill was bored by the Pony Express. 
</P>
<P>
c. the worst danger was from the cold. 
</P>
<P>
d. few people ever heard about the Pony Express.

<P>
It is a longstanding cliche that Californians have a love affair with cars, but 
it is now true that we have love affairs in cars. 
</P>
<P>
Engaging in a cute meet at the junction of Interstates 5 and 805 is a natural 
extension of the way we live our lives. The lyric from an old Manfred Mann tune 
"There she was just a-walkin' down the street," could be rewritten as "There 
she was just a drivin' down the freeway." (Okay, so the meter's off, but you 
get the point.) 
</P>
<P>
This is the age of AIDs, mass consumption and overextended credit. We are 
forced to work long hours far from home. Thus, the scenario formerly played out 
in sleazy-but-fun singles bars now takes place on interstate highways. 
</P>
<P>
There you are nonchalantly driving your late model machine. The car gleams and 
screams out your financial and professional success. 
</P>
<P>
You look across a crowded four lanes of commuting traffic and, like Paul on the 
road to Damascus, you are struck by a vision. She's in a white Volkswagen 
Rabbit or a red BMW. She wears sunglasses, the kind that make her look just a 
little flashy. She looks good. She looks fine. And you nearly lose your mind. 
</P>
<P>
She's not looking at you, but you begin to sidle over. First one lane, then 
two. You match her speed. She looks over. Your eyes lock at 65 m.p.h. She 
smiles. You wink. She smiles wider. You wave. 
</P>
<P>
Ahhh. Time for a cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
Because you are both sealed in climate controlled cars with great stereo 
systems hurtling down a concrete strip, there's no chance for deadly diseases 
to pass between you. 
</P>
<P>
The whole affair has lasted 15 seconds, so there's no commitment. There's no 
impossible decision about which movie to see -- the artsy one with subtitles 
that shows off your bohemian side or the male-bonding kickboxer flick that 
proves you've got testosterone. You don't even have to agonize over whether 
picking up the dinner check is sexist. No doubts about whose career takes 
precedence, whose mother should come for Thanksgiving or who should clean up 
the food processor after making pesto. This, finally, is the perfect romance. 
</P>
<P>
But take heed. It does have its own dangers. You could, literally, crash and 
burn. 
</P>
<P>
"A man flirted with me and got in an accident when he rear ended the car in 
front of him," reported Paula Jefferson, who happens to be an officer with the 
California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Although the CHP does not keep records listing "flirting" as an accident cause, 
many officers have witnessed episodes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm positive it happens," Jefferson said. "It's usually around the commute 
times, especially in the evening." 
</P>
<P>
"There's no reliable data," said Chuck Hurley, vice president of the Institute 
for Highway Safety in Arlington, Va. "I'm sure it happens, but that data would 
only come from self-reporting and not only would it be embarrassing, but there 
are financial incentives (due to higher insurance rates) not to own up to 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Jefferson cites other things we do in cars that cause accidents, like putting 
on makeup and even reading the morning paper while on the way to work. 
</P>
<P>
With car phones, faxes, books on tape and even portable water heaters, it is 
now possible to run through most of life's events while rolling a mile a 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
Suppose a freeway romance blossoms, and you decide to travel down life's 
highway together with a little spare tire of your own. We've all heard stories 
of babies being born in cars. Now, there's a legal provision to allow for 
nursing them in cars. 
</P>
<P>
"The child restraint laws have an exemption for nursing mothers," explained 
Hurley. "In theory it was put in because mothers wanted to nurse during a car 
trip, and the child couldn't do it in a car seat. We take the position that 
there should be no exemptions. A person should pull off the road." 
</P>
<P>
Just as romance can blossom on the freeway, so can it wilt. Suppose your car is 
British and hers is French. You find right away you are incompatible. 
</P>
<P>
It's almost certain that more than one divorce has been decided on the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Once, while connecting with the 405 at El Toro, commuters witnessed twin 
Mercedeses playing a high-speed game of checkers as they switched lanes and 
wove in and out of traffic. The man in the red Mercedes seemed to be pleading 
for the woman in the white Mercedes to come back to him. She shook her fist. He 
screamed. She gestured in several languages. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other drivers gazed skyward, looking for a film studio helicopter 
they figured must be shooting the scene for Knotts Landing. 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult to drive when you have stars -- or tears -- in your eyes. Love, 
like all those other drivers on the freeway, can take unexpected twists and 
turns.
