<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), whose illustrious, 32-year career in California 
politics has been tarnished by the savings and loan scandal, announced Thursday 
that he has cancer of the prostate and will not seek reelection in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
He also will abandon what has become an uphill bid to continue as Senate 
majority whip for two more years. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston, 76, said medical experts will determine shortly whether he should 
undergo surgery or radiation treatment for a type of cancer that is considered 
highly curable if detected early. 
</P>
<P>
"A positive factor is my otherwise robust health," Cranston, an avid runner, 
said in a statement. "The physicians tell me that the cancer is apparently 
totally curable, but immediate treatment is necessary." 
</P>
<P>
His surprise withdrawal is sure to unleash a wild scramble to fill two 
California Senate seats in 1992 -- both Cranston's and the one to be given up 
by Republican Sen. Pete Wilson when he becomes governor. Wilson soon will 
appoint a successor to an abbreviated, two-year term. 
</P>
<P>
Among the many potential candidates for the Democratic nomination are former 
Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., recently defeated gubernatorial candidate Dianne 
Feinstein and Reps. Mel Levine of Santa Monica, Barbara Boxer of Greenbrae and 
Robert T. Matsui of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) called Cranston's 
announcement "a sad one for all his colleagues, but especially for me." He said 
that he knows the California senator will battle cancer with "the same courage 
he has always brought to his legislative career." 
</P>
<P>
In a brief interview, Cranston declined to discuss why he has decided to end a 
political career that began when he was elected California comptroller in 1958, 
brought him to the Senate in 1968 and included an unsuccessful presidential bid 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed to his written statement, which said that "I must concentrate now on 
defeating this thing (cancer)." In a cheerful aside he added, "More than 90% of 
the people who get this are cured." 
</P>
<P>
But Cranston's medical problem, detected in a routine annual physical 
examination and confirmed by a biopsy Oct. 15, may not have been the only 
factor influencing his decision to bow out of politics. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's political popularity plummeted last year when the Senate Ethics 
Committee began investigating charges that he improperly helped S&amp;L owner 
Charles H. Keating Jr. battle federal regulators in exchange for large 
financial contributions to various political causes. 
</P>
<P>
A TV network poll of California voters Tuesday found that the Keating affair 
had left Cranston's reputation in shreds. Only 10% thought he should run for 
reelection; 33% said he should not run and 24% said he should resign now. The 
others refused to respond. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran senator also faces the almost certain prospect of losing his whip 
job to Sen. Wendell H. Ford (D-Ky.) at a Senate Democratic caucus election 
Tuesday. Cranston, who won the post in 1977 largely for his nose-counting 
skills, acknowledged that he had lined up only 19 of the 29 Democratic senators 
needed to keep him in the job. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Cranston is one of five senators who have been summoned to Ethics 
Committee hearings next Thursday to answer charges that the lawmakers 
improperly aided Keating, a major contributor and fund-raiser who has been 
indicted on fraud charges in connection with his ownership of the failed 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn. based in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston has acknowledged that he solicited hundreds of thousands of dollars 
from Keating while defending him in dealings with federal regulators. But the 
senator has defended his action, saying that he did nothing illegal or 
unethical but rather that he was assisting a constituent whose business 
employed many Southern Californians. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Cranston's recent difficulties, he will leave a legacy of broad 
legislative accomplishment that has mixed liberalism with moderate pragmatism. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning with his founding of the California Democratic Council in the 1950s 
and continuing through his four-term Senate career, Cranston has been an 
outspoken advocate of liberal causes. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the scenes, he has also labored hard for business interests, ranging 
from defense and aerospace contractors to growers, movie makers, vintners, 
independent oil companies, real estate agents and savings and loans. 
</P>
<P>
He has shown a passionate interest in improving civil rights, halting the 
spread of nuclear weapons, preserving the environment, improving the nation's 
housing and providing more benefits for veterans. He chairs the Veterans 
Affairs Committee and serves on the Foreign Relations and Banking, Housing and 
Urban Affairs committees. 
</P>
<P>
In the 101st Congress that adjourned recently, Cranston was the primary force 
behind the first housing bill in 20 years -- a measure that is expected to 
provide a blueprint for housing reform over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
An avid environmentalist, he has been responsible for creating numerous 
wilderness areas in California and recently has been a leader in the battle to 
restrict the use of the Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
During the Vietnam War, Cranston made a name for himself by sponsoring 
legislation that improved the care that returning soldiers received in the 
nation's veterans hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
As whip, or assistant Democratic leader, he played a major role in ratification 
of the Panama Canal Treaty in 1978 and the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty 
in 1987 and helped to delay ratification of the 1979 second Strategic Arms 
Limitation Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
He also was a leader in the Senate's rejection of the nomination of Judge 
Robert H. Bork in 1987 to serve on the Supreme Court. And he has been an 
outspoken advocate of sanctions against South Africa, a proponent of nuclear 
non-proliferation and a staunch supporter of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Cranston indicated that he intends to pursue his goals 
vigorously for the remainder of his career. 
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to two years in the Senate free of the burdens and the perils 
of campaigning and fund raising," he said. "I intend to make them years of 
great achievement for the people of California and the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's political difficulties began with his failed bid for the presidency 
in 1984, according to many analysts. His approval ratings back home in 
California took a nose-dive after he finished fourth in the Iowa caucuses and 
seventh in the New Hampshire primary. As a result, he barely won reelection to 
the Senate in 1986 against a tough challenge from Republican Ed Zschau. 
</P>
<P>
It was the endless quest for political contributions that eventually led to 
Cranston's problems with the Senate Ethics Committee. A tireless fund-raiser, 
the California senator raised a then-record $13 million for his 1986 campaign. 
One of his chief contributors was Keating, who has since become a national 
symbol of the fraud and mismanagement that destroyed the U.S. thrift industry. 
</P>
<P>
To help Cranston in his 1986 reelection bid, Keating contributed about $35,000 
directly to the senator's campaign and another $85,000 to the California 
Democratic Party for a get-out-the-vote drive. After his reelection, the 
senator solicited another $850,000 from Keating for voter registration projects 
designed to help Democrats around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Keating had good access to Cranston, who with four other senators intervened 
with federal regulators on behalf of Lincoln in April, 1987. The others are 
Sens. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), John Glenn 
(D-Ohio) and John McCain (R-Ariz.). 
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Cranston, who has staunchly maintained his innocence from the 
start of the Ethics Committee investigation last December, recently became 
discouraged when it appeared that the investigation would continue into next 
year. Special counsel Robert Bennett, who conducted a preliminary inquiry, has 
recommended that the committee conduct a more extensive investigation of 
Cranston, Riegle and DeConcini. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's involvement with Keating came as a shock to many of his California 
supporters, who knew him only as a liberal Democrat and were unaware of his 
close ties to banking and business interests. At a House Banking, Finance and 
Urban Affairs Committee hearing last year, several elderly California women who 
had lost money in the Lincoln collapse declared that the senator had betrayed 
their trust in him. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did Cranston's popularity in California suffer as a result of the 
investigation, but fund raising for his 1992 campaign appeared to be lagging. 
Cranston's last report to the Federal Election Commission showed that he had 
$564,808 in his war chest, which he will be permitted under law to distribute 
to other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Even Cranston's personal life appeared to be affected by his political 
troubles. After divorcing his invalid second wife last year, he fell in love 
with a Beverly Hills woman, Cathy Lee Pattiz, 49. The two even took out a 
marriage license last December, but the wedding was called off when Cranston's 
sister objected to the match. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Cranston has been a frequent companion of Diane Wolf, 36, a 
New York socialite and a member of the federal Commission on Fine Arts. Last 
month, Cranston was unable to win passage of legislation promoted by Wolf that 
would have required the redesign of the penny, nickel, dime, quarter and 
half-dollar.

JAN. 22 ELECTION ORDERED FOR REDRAWN 1ST DISTRICT; 
</P>
<P>
SUPERVISORS: LATINO POLITICIANS BEGIN JOCKEYING TO RUN FOR THE SEAT. WINNER 
WOULD SUCCEED SCHABARUM.

<P>
A federal judge who ruled that Los Angeles County's supervisorial boundaries 
discriminated against Latinos ordered Thursday that an election be held Jan. 22 
to choose a successor to Supervisor Pete Schabarum in a redrawn 1st District. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon set the election during a hearing attended 
by Latino politicians who are considering running for the powerful board, 
including U.S. Rep. Esteban Torres, Los Angeles City Council members Richard 
Alatorre and Gloria Molina, and Sarah Flores, a former Schabarum aide. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about time," said Flores, whose campaign was thrown into limbo by the 
historic voting rights case. "I'm ready." 
</P>
<P>
Flores was the top finisher in the 10-candidate June primary to succeed the 
retiring Schabarum and had been slated to face Superior Court Judge Gregory 
O'Brien in a runoff Tuesday. But the supervisorial election was postponed in 
August by a federal appellate court. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Kenyon's ruling that 
the all-white board diluted the voting power of the county's 3 million Latinos. 
The appeals court let stand a new political map drawn by civil rights groups 
and directed Kenyon to schedule an election in the redrawn 1st District. 
</P>
<P>
The new district -- stretching from El Sereno and Lincoln Heights east to 
Irwindale and La Puente and southeast to Santa Fe Springs -- is 71% Latino. 
Democrats outnumber Republicans, 66% to 23%. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon set today as the opening day for candidates to file papers to run for 
the seat. To qualify for the ballot, candidates must collect 20 voters' 
signatures and pay $943.44, or gather 3,774 signatures. Candidates have until 
Nov. 30 to file papers. 
</P>
<P>
The race is expected to lead to the election of the first Latino supervisor in 
115 years, making the new board member one of the nation's most powerful Latino 
elected officials. The election also could tip the balance of power on the 
five-member board, now controlled by conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courthouse, Alatorre, Molina and Torres held a joint press 
conference to announce that they will hold a private meeting today in an effort 
to agree on a single Democratic candidate they can get behind. 
</P>
<P>
But all three politicians said they want to be that candidate, and an aide to 
Rep. Matthew Martinez (D-Montebello) said his boss also is considering running. 
</P>
<P>
"I have every intention of running," Alatorre said. 
</P>
<P>
Torres, a Democrat from La Puente who was reelected Tuesday, said, "Yes, I'm 
running. There's no question about it." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ed Roybal (D-Los Angeles) said in a telephone interview that he will 
attend the meeting but does not plan to run for supervisor. Roybal said he 
wants to prevent a "blood bath" in the Latino community in which two or more 
popular Democrats split the vote, allowing a Republican to win. 
</P>
<P>
As the Democrats were gathered outside the courthouse, Flores, a Republican, 
was off to the side saying, "Don't count me out" of the race. Flores, backed by 
conservative Supervisors Mike Antonovich and Deane Dana, raised about $400,000 
for the primary, but she spent it all. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien said Thursday that he does not plan to run again. "I'm from the East 
San Gabriel Valley," he said. "I don't think the people in that new district 
would see me as anything but a carpetbagger." 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum is eligible to run but has said he will not. Under the judge's order, 
candidates of the old and new 1st Districts are eligible to run. 
</P>
<P>
The election schedule approved Thursday was drawn up by the Mexican American 
Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union, 
which along with the U.S. Justice Department are plaintiffs in the voting 
rights suit. The schedule provides for 50 days for campaigning after the filing 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
If no candidate receives a majority of the vote Jan. 22, the top two finishers 
will face off Feb. 19. If a candidate wins a majority of the vote in the 
primary, he or she will take office Feb. 8. Otherwise, the winner of the runoff 
will be sworn in March 8. 
</P>
<P>
In its continuing effort to block the new redistricting plan, the board's 
conservative majority hopes to win a review of last week's decision from an 
11-member panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals or, failing that, the 
U.S. Supreme Court. If the review is granted, the election could again be 
postponed. 
</P>
<P>
During the court hearing, MALDEF attorney Richard Fajardo alerted the judge 
that Antonovich and Dana have asked Gov. George Deukmejian to determine if 
Schabarum has violated requirements that he live in the district he serves. If 
the governor finds that Schabarum has violated the residency requirement, the 
two supervisors want Deukmejian to appoint Flores to the 1st District seat. 
Schabarum contends he lives in the new 1st District. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon said, "Let's cross each bridge as we get to it."

MOVE WIDENS RANGE OF U.S. OFFENSIVE OPTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
STRATEGY: IT'S ALSO AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT IRAQ'S FORCES CANNOT BE DEFEATED BY 
AIR POWER ALONE.

The stunning decision to roughly double the U.S. deployment in the Persian Gulf 
allows for a range of offensive strikes on multiple fronts that would have been 
impossible with the current 238,000 U.S. troops, defense officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The move represents an acknowledgement that Iraq cannot be defeated by air 
power alone and that large numbers of tanks, artillery, infantry and Marines 
will be required to break through elaborate Iraqi defenses if a war is 
launched. 
</P>
<P>
Military commanders in Saudi Arabia told Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. 
Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that while they could 
adequately defend Saudi Arabia with the current force, they would need a huge 
increase in ground, air and naval forces to confidently launch an attack on the 
430,000 Iraqi troops entrenched in fortified positions in Kuwait and southern 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the senior commander in Saudi Arabia, told Powell 
two weeks ago that he wanted "overwhelming force" before contemplating an 
attack on the Iraqi army to minimize U.S. casualties, defense officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, senior military officers in Washington said, Schwarzkopf had warned 
that the current allied force could be defeated or suffer unacceptable losses 
if it were to stage an attack without substantial reinforcements. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said the additional troops, including 4 1/3 new divisions of ground 
troops and Marines, "clearly will give us the ability to conduct offensive 
military operations." 
</P>
<P>
The addition of three aircraft carriers and another battleship strike force 
will permit the United States to wage continuous air operations and shore 
bombardment against Iraq and Kuwait, naval officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"This force now has incredible offensive punch," a senior Army officer said. 
"It's fast, it's well-equipped, it's well-led. It has the capacity to punch 
through Iraqi defenses and bypass and cut off Iraqi forces in short order. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question: Once this force is assembled . . . it is going to be up 
to the task." 
</P>
<P>
Another consideration behind sending the massive reinforcements, which is 
whispered in the Pentagon but not spoken aloud, is that U.S. military leaders 
do not believe they can rely on the majority of the military forces sent by 
allied nations. 
</P>
<P>
Serious command and control problems remain unresolved. Also, the troop 
deployments by the other two dozen nations in the anti-Iraq alliance, numbering 
now more than 100,000, not including the Saudis, are for the most part symbolic 
at this point, officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
Powell tacitly acknowledged these problems when he said at a Pentagon news 
conference Thursday that "once a political decision is made (to attack Iraq), 
I'm confident that military command and control arrangements would fall into 
place." 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials did not say how many of the troops already in Saudi Arabia 
might be coming home as part of a rotation policy once the new forces begin 
arriving. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney and Powell did not rule out the dispatch of even more forces once the 
new deployment is complete, sometime in January. Cheney also said that 
additional Air Force units likely will be sent to bolster the 450 combat jets 
now in the region, although he did not announce any new deployments. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never put an upper ceiling on the deployment," Cheney said. "We're not 
putting an upper ceiling on the deployment now." 
</P>
<P>
The new deployments include: 
</P>
<P>
A full Army corps from Europe, including two armored divisions and an armored 
cavalry regiment. A corps comprises roughly 110,000 troops, 1,000 tanks and 
several hundred armored personnel carriers. 
</P>
<P>
The Army 7th Corps, which is being sent from Germany, will deploy with air 
assault helicopters, hundreds of artillery pieces and a broad range of support 
troops and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
An additional mechanized division from the United States, the 1st Infantry 
Division from Ft. Riley, Kan. The unit will bring about 400 tanks and armored 
personnel carriers and about 16,500 soldiers to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Three brigades of Army National Guard combat troops, each comprising about 
3,000 men and several hundred tanks and armored vehicles. The troops will be 
sent to Ft. Irwin, Calif., for training and evaluation before the Pentagon 
decides whether to dispatch them to the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney and Powell have expressed doubts about their combat readiness, and this 
deployment essentially will be a test of the military's increasing reliance on 
the guard and reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Three aircraft carrier battle groups, each including a carrier and about seven 
escort and support ships. There are already three carriers in the region -- one 
in the eastern Mediterranean, one in the Red Sea and one in the Persian Gulf or 
the northern Arabian Sea. A carrier has a crew of 5,500 men and an air wing of 
about 80 jets, including F-14 fighters, F/A-18 fighter-bombers and A-6 bombers. 
The escort ships generally include a guided-missile cruiser and several 
destroyers or frigates. 
</P>
<P>
The battleship Missouri and its escorts, which will complement the battleship 
Wisconsin, now in the region. The World War II-vintage battleships are manned 
by 1,500 sailors and carry nine 16-inch guns, cruise missiles and a variety of 
other weapons for attacking shore targets. 
</P>
<P>
The 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force from Camp Lejeune, N.C., and the 5th Marine 
Expeditionary Brigade from Camp Pendleton -- a total of about 60,000 troops. 
The new troops will reinforce the 46,000 Marines already in the theater, 
bringing the Marine total to 106,000. The figure is more than half the total 
197,000-troop strength of the Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
They will be joined by a squadron of supply ships sailing from Norfolk, Va., 
which will allow the entire force to fight for 30 days without additional 
ammunition, food, fuel or other supplies, Marine Corps officials said.

BISHOPS RAISE MORAL BARRIERS TO FORCE IN GULF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES RELIGION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Catholic bishops for the first time have raised moral objections to the 
possible use of military force by the United States in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Archbishop Roger M. Mahony, acting as chairman of the bishops' 
international policy committee, warned Secretary of State James A. Baker III in 
a letter Wednesday that a war "would jeopardize many lives, raise serious moral 
questions and undermine the international solidarity against Iraq." The letter 
was released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony "strongly" urged the Bush Administration "to stay the course" with 
multinational economic sanctions against Iraq because of its Aug. 2 invasion of 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The bishops, whose 54 million Catholics constitute the nation's largest 
religious group, have joined a growing number of mainline Christian leaders 
opposing the use of military force to resolve the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish groups generally continue to support the Administration's action in the 
gulf and to urge that Iraq be forced to retreat from Kuwait in order to 
neutralize the power of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
But leaders of such religious bodies as the Episcopal Church, the Evangelical 
Lutheran Church in America and the National Baptist Convention U.S.A. are 
insisting on a diplomatic solution and questioning the moral basis for U.S. 
military action. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to President Bush last week, the Rev. Paul H. Sherry, president of 
the United Church of Christ, criticized the "steady drumbeat of war messages" 
from the White House. "Do not lead the U.S. into war with Iraq," Sherry wrote. 
"War is not the solution to Iraq's immoral invasion of Kuwait and will lead to 
severe suffering for untold numbers of people." 
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the Catholic bishops had praised the U.S. decision to "oppose 
aggression" while urging that Iraqi civilians not be deprived of food and 
medicine, said Bob Bennemeyer, the Washington-based director of the bishops' 
Office for International Justice and Peace. 
</P>
<P>
"But because of the (Bush Administration's) heightened rhetoric lately about 
using the military option, the bishops feel it is premature to consider war 
without certain moral tests being met," Bennemeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
The four-page letter from Mahony to Baker was replete with ethical terminology 
and pointed practical questions. Mahony was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"Is there 'a real and certain danger' which can only be confronted by war?" 
Mahony wrote in reference to Catholic principles of "just cause" for engaging 
in warfare. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to meet the just-cause criteria, U.S. policy would have to clarify 
its precise objectives, measure them by ethical values and demonstrate that 
they can only be achieved through the use of force," Mahony wrote.

<P>
While Catholic tradition does not absolutely rule out force, "There is a clear 
presumption against war," Mahony said. 
</P>
<P>
"The military means used must be commensurate with the evil to be overcome and 
must be directed at the aggressors, not (at) innocent people," Mahony said. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony said the bishops realize that "a strong military presence" by U.S. 
troops in Saudi Arabia "can give credibility to a vigorous pursuit of 
nonviolent solutions." 
</P>
<P>
But he said he is concerned that "the pressure to use military force may grow 
as the pursuit of nonviolent options almost inevitably becomes difficult, 
complex and slow." 
</P>
<P>
Mahony said he offered the Catholic perspective as part of the "necessary and 
growing public debate about whether the use of military force could be morally 
justified and under what, if any, conditions." 
</P>
<P>
In mid-October, 26 Catholic bishops, acting on their own, signed a statement 
highly critical of the U.S. military buildup in Saudi Arabia, saying that the 
forces already constituted an "offensive threat" to Iraq.

ON CALIFORNIA: ABOUT PROP. 140: HISTORY SUGGESTS IT ISN'T OVER YET

On the evening the bad news came to Sacramento, Willie Brown threw a party. 
This was the usual election night party, up on the second floor of the state 
Capitol. In Willie's office. 
</P>
<P>
I say "Willie's office," but you should understand what that implies. The 
Speaker of the Assembly commands most of the south wing of the second floor. 
Like the Capitol itself, Willie's office constitutes something of a period 
piece. The rooms are relics of the Gold Rush, with mahogany doors rising 20 
feet, old gaslights fitted with electric bulbs, and many potted palms. These 
rooms are grand, ornate, and have all the sugary splendor of a South American 
brothel. 
</P>
<P>
Here the Speaker placed big-screen televisions so the faithful could watch the 
will of the people express itself. The chief clerks and secretaries and liaison 
men all mingled amid the splendor, munched their canapes and learned, fairly 
early in the evening, that the people of California wanted to throw them out. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 140 had passed. You might think that this news would have converted 
Willie's party to something of a wake. Pensions and jobs had just disappeared. 
Many jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But oddly it did not. The regulars swigged their Calistoga water, cheered 
loudly when elections went their way, and disappeared into the cool night 
looking inexplicably happy. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe they know something we don't. And maybe it's this: The reform game in 
Sacramento is a very long one. The struggle over 140 is not over, it's hardly 
begun, and the odds, if anything, rest with them. 
</P>
<P>
That is the peculiar history of reform by initiative. Bill George, the 
assistant chief clerk of the Assembly, has made a minor hobby of documenting 
campaigns to reform Sacramento. The lesson, he says, gets repeated over and 
over. 
</P>
<P>
Take the year 1911, for example. That was the year the initiative process 
itself was established. How was it established? By a constitutional amendment 
placed on the ballot. And it came complete with ballot arguments, just like 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The argument in favor of the initiative promised that the mere presence of this 
weapon in the hands of the people would change forever the way lawmakers 
conducted themselves in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"Honest business will not have to bribe a legislature to get a square deal," it 
said. "Dishonest business will not be able to 'influence' a legislature and get 
more than a square deal." 
</P>
<P>
All right. We know how that promise turned out, so let's move on to 1974 when 
Californians passed the Political Reform Initiative. This was a crackdown on 
campaign spending, on conflict-of-interest in the Capitol, on the big-money 
boys. 
</P>
<P>
"It is time politicians are made directly responsible to the people -- not to 
purchased demands of special interests," the ballot argument said. "In 
Sacramento, lobbyists can provide secret favors to help pass new laws. In 
California politics, money speaks. 
</P>
<P>
"It is time for political reform which can only be accomplished by Proposition 
9." 
</P>
<P>
We got Proposition 9 but, as you've probably noticed, we did not get political 
reform. So in 1988 we had another go with Propositions 68 and 73. These were 
also crackdowns on campaign spending and the big money. The sponsors of 
Proposition 68 wrote most of their ballot promises in capital letters. They 
were very enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
"CALIFORNIA'S TAXPAYERS CAN NO LONGER AFFORD A GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED BY SPECIAL 
INTERESTS. MONEY IS CORRUPTING THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS! IT'S GOT TO STOP NOW!" 
they wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later the courts decided that Propositions 68 and 73 were not so 
democratic themselves and threw out both. Whatever it was that had to stop in 
Sacramento, did not. 
</P>
<P>
Now we're starting a new decade with Proposition 140. On Wednesday, the day 
after the election, Willie Brown called two meetings: one for the legislative 
staff and one for the Democratic legislators. 
</P>
<P>
The staff meeting was held in the Capitol auditorium. Don't panic, Willie told 
them. There's lots of time before anyone loses their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The legislators' meeting was held at the Firehouse restaurant downtown. Don't 
panic, Willie told them. There's lots of time before anyone's term runs out. 
</P>
<P>
Willie was thinking about the possibilities with the courts. He was thinking 
about new initiatives. Willie didn't get to be Speaker by missing the lessons 
of history, and he knows the game is not over. 
</P>
<P>
So if you tend to relish the housecleaning promised by Proposition 140, you 
might keep the celebration to a minimum for now. As Willie says, and as history 
proves, there's lots of time.

DEUKMEJIAN CHIDES PUBLIC FOR SPLIT VOTE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: HE BLAMES DIVIDED GOVERNMENT -- SUCH AS STATE'S REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR 
AND DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATURE -- FOR BOGGING DOWN THE SYSTEM.

A relaxed but defensive Gov. George Deukmejian said Thursday that voters must 
share the blame for governmental gridlock when they elect a governor of one 
party and a Legislature controlled by the other, as they did on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, when the public says they're unhappy about the fact that a lot of 
major issues are not solved in Sacramento or in Washington, they also sort of 
have to look at the way in which they themselves voted," said Deukmejian, 
holding what aides said would be his last press conference in Los Angeles as 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you expect a governor or a President to get his programs through when 
you send (to the Capitol) a Legislature and (state) constitutional officers of 
the other party who are virtually opposed to everything he said he was going to 
do? We had that same problem (in Sacramento) and now we see it in Washington. 
And here again we see it in this upcoming (Pete Wilson) Administration." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, California voters elected a Republican governor and a Democratic 
lieutenant governor, placed Democrats in most other state offices and 
strengthened the Democrats' grip on the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Political scientists increasingly in recent years have blamed divided 
government -- both in Washington and Sacramento -- for government stalemate. In 
California, this also has led to a glut of ballot initiatives sponsored by 
special interests. 
</P>
<P>
"There just needs to be a lot more discussion about this," the outgoing 
Republican governor insisted. "People shouldn't be quick to blame a governor or 
blame a legislature and say, 'What's the matter with you guys? Why can't you 
get along? Why can't you resolve it? Why can't you all recognize there are 
problems that need to be resolved?' When, in fact, through their votes, they're 
sending people up there (to Sacramento) with diametrically different approaches 
and philosophies." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian is particularly sensitive about this because his public popularity 
steadily declined in the past year. The governor's image -- as well as the 
Legislature's -- took a big hit during the summer because of a monthlong budget 
stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
A statewide survey of registered voters last week by The Los Angeles Times Poll 
found that only 41% approved of "the way George Deukmejian is handling his job 
as governor," while an equal number disapproved. In mid-September, a Times Poll 
showed 50% approval and 42% disapproval. Last December, Deukmejian's 
"negatives" were significantly lower: Only 25% disapproved of his job 
performance, although 41% approved and 34% said they did not know enough about 
the two-term governor to offer an opinion. 
</P>
<P>
The Times Poll also recently found that voters do, indeed, favor divided 
government. By 4 to 3, people said they prefer that "one party controls the 
Legislature and the other party controls the governor's office so they can keep 
a check on each other," rather than having one party control both branches of 
government "so they can work together and achieve the party's goals." 
</P>
<P>
Asked at his press conference whether he felt he had been unfairly criticized 
for inaction, Deukmejian unhesitantly replied: "Every hour. Every hour. You 
know, all the time. I mean, we get criticized without any reference, really, to 
what the situation is." 
</P>
<P>
Based on the argument against divided government, a reporter told the governor, 
voters on Tuesday should have elected Democrat Dianne Feinstein to work with 
the Democrat-controlled Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"No, they should have elected a Republican-controlled Legislature because they 
were voting for a governor who went before all of the people of the state. He 
got the majority (of votes) so he should really have a Republican-controlled 
Legislature to support his program," Deukmejian answered. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the the world, this is called a parliamentary system, but Deukmejian 
stopped short of advocating that. 
</P>
<P>
The lame-duck governor said Republican Wilson's election meant that voters did 
not want to steer very far from the course he has set in Sacramento for the 
past eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian also denied that Wilson will inherit a budget deficit, contending 
that there are ample funds in a state reserve to end the present fiscal year in 
the black. Other state officials, however, have estimated that the deficit 
could climb as high as $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he thought Californians would remember his legacy, Deukmejian 
deadpanned: "I think they're going to miss this wild and crazy guy."

QUEEN LUCY LEADS A TIRELESS LIFE IN HUB OF THE DESERT

PEARSONVILLE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sign approaching town proclaims: "Pearsonville -- Hub Cap Capital of the 
World." 
</P>
<P>
This is the home of "Hubcap Lucy" Pearson, 63, the "Hubcap Queen." 
</P>
<P>
Hubcap Lucy has been collecting hubcaps since she and her husband, Andy, 65, 
founded Pearsonville in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
Pearsonville is a wide spot in the middle of the desert on U.S. 395 in Inyo 
County, 60 miles north of Mojave. 
</P>
<P>
Hubcap aficionados all over America know about Hubcap Lucy. She has 80,000 used 
hubcaps all over the place in Pearsonville. 
</P>
<P>
They hang from the walls in Mom and Pop's cafe, they are in grocery store 
shopping carts, in huge drums, hanging on fences, piled high in the Hubcap 
Yard, on shelves in the Hubcap Shop, and stored in a huge Hubcap Trailer. 
</P>
<P>
"If I don't have them, nobody does. I ship hubcaps all over the country, as far 
as New England," Lucy said. 
</P>
<P>
She buys, sells and trades hubcaps. She is a walking encyclopedia on the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
Hubcap Lucy and her granddaughter, April Hamlin, 18, make hubcap clocks that 
they sell for $35. "We will make a clock to fit any kind of hubcap," Lucy said. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the Pearsons' wrecking yard where Whoopi Goldberg and Jim Belushi met 
in the movie, "Homer and Eddie." 
</P>
<P>
Lucy, Andy and their two children, Janice and Donald, came to California from 
Irvine, Ky. The Pearsons paid $8,000 for 80 acres here 31 years ago, and that 
was the beginning of Pearsonville, population 100. 
</P>
<P>
"First year we were here, we lived in a 12-foot-by-12-foot shack Andy put up; 
no electricity, no water, no telephone," recalled Lucy. 
</P>
<P>
Because so many wrecks occurred on the busy Los Angeles to Reno road that 
passes through Pearsonville, Andy, a mechanic, went into the wrecking business. 
</P>
<P>
"When Andy salvaged tires and wheels from wrecks, he'd throw the hubcaps away. 
I hate to see anything go to waste so I started collecting hubcaps and I've 
been doing it ever since," Lucy said. 
</P>
<P>
It has become an obsession. 
</P>
<P>
Pearsonville has come a long way. The Pearsons own all the businesses -- the 
wrecking company, garage, gas station, mini-mart, cafe, auto parts shop, hubcap 
shop and race track, where stock cars race every other Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Cars in many places sport bumper stickers asking "Where the hell is 
Pearsonville?" and the Pearsons have sold thousands of T-shirts with drawings 
of hubcaps and the eye-catching message "Pearsonville -- Hub Cap Capital of the 
World." 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to still be doing hubcaps when I'm 100," mused Hubcap Lucy.

Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
President Bush said he has ordered a new wave of U.S. troops to the Persian 
Gulf to create an "adequate offensive military option should that be 
necessary." Pentagon sources have said the reinforcements could number as many 
as 240,000. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein fired his army chief of staff -- the third 
high-level dismissal since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kuwait's exiled defense minister said Iraq has 650 U.S.-made Hawk 
missiles, and another Arab official said Iraq is creating a deadly strain of 
biological weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Hostage Front:

In Warsaw, more than 240 freed Poles returned home from Iraq. Former West 
German Chancellor Willy Brandt, meanwhile, secured the release of 50 more 
Western hostages.

SOVIETS BACK U.S., WON'T RULE OUT USE OF FORCE; 
</P>
<P>
STRATEGY: BUT SHEVARDNADZE INDICATES THAT MOSCOW HAS FAR MORE PATIENCE THAN 
WASHINGTON.

<P>
With Secretary of State James A. Baker III looking visibly relieved by his 
side, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said Thursday that the Soviet 
Union agrees with the United States that military force cannot be ruled out in 
the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze made it clear that Moscow still has far more patience than 
Washington in awaiting a peaceful end to the crisis. But his agreement that 
Moscow would not stand in the way of military action gave Baker the minimum 
required at this stage of the U.S. campaign to convince Iraq that the world 
community is determined to reverse the invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Baker and Shevardnadze spoke at a brief news conference after Baker met for 
more than two hours with Shevardnadze and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
at Gorbachev's secluded dacha outside Moscow. And the two men said their 
countries are determined to present a common front in the gulf -- even if that 
means that either or both will have to compromise on issues of timing and 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
"As for questions of whether the use of force could be ruled out, well, 
probably this could not be ruled out," Shevardnadze said. "A situation may 
emerge which effectively would require such a move. 
</P>
<P>
"Any decision should be taken in the framework of the Security Council and the 
United Nations," he added. "I think the Security Council resolutions have 
demonstrated enough maturity that we should not doubt the ability of the 
Security Council to take wise and mature decisions. I would advise against 
looking for some differences in the position between the Soviet Union and the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
Baker, who had seemed to hold his breath when Shevardnadze started his answer, 
allowed himself a tightly controlled smile before the Soviet foreign minister 
had finished speaking. 
</P>
<P>
He insisted that he got all he wanted in the Moscow stop of his weeklong tour 
of seven countries in the Middle East and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"This was not intended to be a decision meeting," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Gorbachev, Shevardnadze and other Soviet officials have expressed 
hope for a peaceful resolution of the conflict while glossing over the question 
of whether it may become necessary to use force if the U.N.-imposed trade 
embargo and other economic sanctions do not force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
But President Bush, Baker and other U.S. leaders have warned repeatedly that 
military action will be used to end the Iraqi invasion if more peaceful methods 
fail. 
</P>
<P>
According to a senior State Department official, a primary purpose of Baker's 
trip to Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, the Soviet Union, Britain and 
France is to sound out world leaders on a proposed U.N. Security Council 
resolution to provide standby authority for the use of military force if the 
Iraqi occupation of Kuwait continues. The official said the United States would 
like action on such a resolution this month during its term in the council 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
But Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union is not yet ready to take that step. 
Instead, he said, the proposed resolution is "a possible future course of 
action which would be subject to further consultations and discussion. It is 
too early to discuss that right now." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he took that answer as a rebuff, Baker said, "I do not consider that a 
'no.' " 
</P>
<P>
Such a resolution would require extensive consultation among the five permanent 
Security Council members as a first step, and Chinese diplomats indicated 
privately they had reservations about supporting the use of force while a 
glimmer of hope for a peaceful solution to the crisis through diplomacy 
remains. 
</P>
<P>
The specificity of any use of force resolution also was delicate. One issue 
would be whether the resolution would give broad authority for action or 
whether it would be more limited in scope with conditions written into the 
document by the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain say authority for military action already exists 
under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, which establishes the right of individual 
or collective defense until the Security Council acts. 
</P>
<P>
But in order to ensure the preservation of the coalition it has built, U.S. 
diplomats would prefer the council to pass a resolution authorizing collective 
force. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering is president of the Security Council for 
November, and Western diplomats see this month as a timely period to seek to 
put additional U.N. pressure on Hussein. The president of the council in 
December is the ambassador from Yemen, which initially was skeptical of council 
action against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Baker and Shevardnadze met for a total of 11 hours at the Foreign Ministry's 
ceremonial meeting room in Moscow, sandwiched around their trip to Gorbachev's 
dacha, located in a birch and fir forest about 10 miles west of the capital 
overlooking the Moscow River. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gorbachev is believed to do much of his work in the two-story, 
mustard-colored, stucco house, he seldom receives American guests there. It was 
believed to be the first visit by a secretary of state, although former 
President Ronald Reagan was entertained there during the 1988 summit in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
At the dacha, reporters admitted to the first few minutes of the meeting asked 
Gorbachev if he believes the world community should set a deadline by which 
Iraq must end its invasion or face additional action. The Soviet president 
replied, "Thank you for a good question" -- but he made no attempt to answer 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, the Bush Administration has 
tried to make Iraqi President Saddam Hussein believe that every night when he 
goes to bed, he could be awakened by the blast of American bombs. So far, 
Washington's actions have not matched its bellicose rhetoric, but the United 
States has moved more than 230,000 military personnel to the gulf and made 
other preparations for possible combat. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Soviet Union has voted for all 10 Security Council resolutions 
condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Gorbachev and his aides have been far 
less belligerent in their rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Baker and Shevardnadze said they consider U.S.-Soviet solidarity 
on the issue to be far more important than any specific strategy.

DACHA OPENED FOR RARE VIEW BY REPORTERS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the end of a road, clearly marked with a "Do Not Enter" sign, Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev gets away from the cares of Moscow in a 
two-story, mustard-colored dacha set in the middle of a birch and fir forest. 
</P>
<P>
Western reporters were given a rare glimpse of the house Thursday when 
Gorbachev met there with visiting Secretary of State James A. Baker III. 
</P>
<P>
The dacha itself is not imposing by the standards of international heads of 
state. Architecturally, it is of a late 19th-Century style that is popular all 
over Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The house has a green roof, topped by a tin-roofed cupola with a weather vane 
displaying the numbers 1956. A Soviet official said that is the year it was 
built. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev met Baker in a small room set with a round wooden table and 
surrounded by what appeared to be empty bookcases, giving the appearance of a 
library without books. The room has a panoramic view of a marble terrace that 
overlooks the Moscow River and an expansive grass field, dusted in snow 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Camp David, the U.S. presidential retreat in Maryland, there is no sign 
indicating that Gorbachev's dacha is at hand. However, there is a high green 
wall with an ornate, mustard-colored gate house that indicates something 
important must be going on inside. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union has never announced the location of the dacha, and reporters 
are seldom allowed near it. 
</P>
<P>
A photographer from Tass, the Soviet news agency, previously had taken photos 
of the building and its grounds, but they were never published. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gorbachev is known to have an apartment in the fashionable Lenin Hills 
section of Moscow and an office in the Kremlin, he is believed to do much of 
his work at the dacha. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials who accompanied reporters to the dacha declined to say where 
it is.

DESERT DUST, FIRE HUMBLE U.S. HIGH-TECH STRATEGY FOR COPTER OPERATIONS AT

LANDING ZONE EAGLE, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Using ultra-sophisticated vision equipment that seemingly dissolves the 
darkness, the huge Sea Stallion helicopters were to come whirling in through 
the desert night, landing with pinpoint precision to airlift a company of 
soldiers assigned to destroy an "enemy command post." 
</P>
<P>
The operation, a training exercise carried out in a remote area of Saudi 
Arabia, was supposed to embody one of the central principles of U.S. strategy 
in the Persian Gulf: that high-tech equipment and superior training will enable 
American troops to defeat a vastly larger Iraqi foe without incurring fearsome 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the exercise earlier this week turned out to be a humbling lesson of a 
sort the United States has learned on many battlefields before. 
</P>
<P>
The mission, like many in actual wartime, was a race against time. The American 
troops had to get in and get out of the command post before Iraqi 
reinforcements could move in and wipe them out. 
</P>
<P>
But trouble began to develop as soon as the Sea Stallions arrived at the 
blacked-out landing zone where the troops waited to embark. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers assigned to guide the choppers in were equipped with luminescent 
chemical lights. But nobody had completely reckoned on the dense cloak of dust 
that was kicked up by the choppers' rotor blades, obscuring the guides on the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
"Those chem lights are about impossible to see," complained one frustrated Sea 
Stallion pilot as he peered through his night vision goggles into the 
blackness. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the unexpected glare of burning gas at a nearby oil field, 
compounded by orders that the pilots must land facing the flames. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the dust was settled and the pickup completed, the mission was 
nearly half an hour late. That meant that the Marines would arrive at the 
command post just in time to be blown away by arriving enemy reinforcements. 
</P>
<P>
"You have just seen some of the limitations we've been talking about," 
concluded a disappointed Lt. Col. T. J. Frerker, a Camp Pendleton-based Huey 
squadron commander. 
</P>
<P>
If war comes to the region, American commanders want it to come at night, when 
U.S. aircraft would be far less vulnerable to hand-held Iraqi missiles. 
</P>
<P>
But a series of nighttime accidents involving Army and Marine helicopters in 
Saudi Arabia has raised concerns about U.S. night-fighting capabilities in the 
unfamiliar, featureless terrain, where pilots have found it difficult to 
distinguish between land and sky. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the accidents, most of them affecting Marine helicopters, both 
services have imposed restrictions on night-flying operations. However, both 
Army and Marine commanders have said they would have no qualms about fighting a 
war at night. 
</P>
<P>
In disclosing for the first time the restrictions on Marine operations, Brig. 
Gen. Granville Amos, assistant commander of the Marine Air Wing, stressed that 
their primary purpose is to keep helicopters "out of the dust" to avoid sand 
erosion of rotor blades and engines. 
</P>
<P>
By permitting reporters to witness Marine night helicopter operations here, 
U.S. officers made clear that they hope to defuse a new round of criticism over 
the night goggles, stressing that pilots are well aware of the devices' 
vulnerabilities. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot more to these things than just putting them on your face and 
going out flying," Frerker, the Huey squadron commander, acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
The $25,000 goggles, known by their technical name of AN/AVS6, magnify 
available light about 25,000 times through 1.5 million microscopic glass tubes. 
The yellow-green image that the user sees is, in fact, a projection on a 
phosphorous screen. 
</P>
<P>
In the first 45 days of their deployment here, Marines used the goggles in 
training missions even on moonless nights, when their capabilities are most 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
But after the series of night-flying accidents, commanders ordered that pilots 
revert to a normal operations standard permitting training only when 
illumination from the moon is at least one-eighth its full strength. 
</P>
<P>
On this night, however, the moon was more than three-quarters full, permitting 
the devices to function at what officers described as near-optimum levels. 
</P>
<P>
In briefings before the exercise, pilots said their biggest problem in desert 
operations is dust, which can obscure their vision. Another problem, they said, 
is that too bright a light -- such as the flame from flared gas at an oil field 
site -- can wipe out vision by causing the goggles to "shut down." The Marines 
said that these factors are "not problems," but "limitations" with which they 
are learning to cope. They noted that the sandy, flat desert terrain also 
provides pilots with an advantage by reflecting more light than grass or 
forest. 
</P>
<P>
From the cockpit of a Huey, pilots demonstrated the contrast between the 
yellow-green glow of a goggle-viewed world and the darkness of the desert 
without it. They discounted safety concerns and said that they believe that 
they are far safer using the goggles at night than not using them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the difference between this," Frerker said later, pressing his palms 
tightly over his face, "and this" -- pulling his hands away and opening his 
eyes as wide as they could go. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the dust and oil-fire glow of the sky above Landing Zone Eagle, however, 
the practical effect of wearing the goggles appeared to be something in between 
-- similar perhaps to peering through a gauzy blindfold. 
</P>
<P>
While Marines on the ground flashed their chemical lights again and again, 
hoping to launch their mock raid on an Iraqi command and control center on 
time, pilots circling in the air had to guess which was the proper pickup zone. 
</P>
<P>
The first two choppers were set down in the wrong place, forcing the second 
pair to abort. Then the clouds of sand kicked up by the helicopters enveloped 
the landing zone. Even with night-vision goggles, the pilots could do little 
but orbit till the dust cleared. 
</P>
<P>
Even after the exercise ended, one pilot was overheard on the radio asking 
another crew: "Did you guys ever see any chem lights in the pickup zone? We 
never did." 
</P>
<P>
Back at the airfield after the operation, pilots said the ground troops had 
ignited the lights too soon. By the time the helicopters arrived, the lights 
were too dim, they said. The lead Sea Stallion pilot, Maj. Rick Rogers, said he 
had given the Marines two boxloads of brighter lights in hopes of improving 
their visibility in the future. 
</P>
<P>
But Frerker said the principal problem had been caused by bright lights, 
particularly the oil-field fire, which "pretty much shut down the goggles." 
Later, he said, "We could not see each other through the dust." 
</P>
<P>
Even earlier in the operation, he acknowledged, the helicopters overshot a 
lake-bed landing site because they mistook its dark-sand characteristics for 
shadows cast by nearby highway lights. 
</P>
<P>
Maj. Jim McClain, a Marine public affairs officer, noted that problems related 
to artificial light likely would be minimized in the blackout conditions of 
combat. But he acknowledged that fires could be a principal feature of the 
battlefield here, with Iraq having made preparations to set its defensive 
barriers aflame. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line, according to a rueful Frerker, is: "We need to practice it 
some more."

A man who opened fire on Red Square a short distance from President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev during the Revolution Day parade has been charged with committing a 
terrorist act, a spokesman for the KGB secret police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander A. Shmonov, 38, of Leningrad, will undergo psychiatric tests to 
determine whether he was sane at the time of the shooting Wednesday, said 
Alexei Kandaurov, deputy director of the KGB public relations office. 
</P>
<P>
He gave no other details on the case. 
</P>
<P>
No one was hurt in the incident, in which the man pulled out a hunting rifle in 
the heavily guarded square about 80 yards from Gorbachev. The shooting came 
during a Communist Party march that followed the military parade. 
</P>
<P>
A plainclothes officer knocked the weapon away as the man fired once into the 
air and again into the ground, newspapers said. He then was subdued by about 20 
plainclothes officers and carried into the GUM department store across the 
square from Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze played down what may have been an 
assassination attempt, denying that it indicated a loss of public support for 
Gorbachev's perestroika reform policies. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this incident should be taken very seriously," Shevardnadze told 
reporters before meeting with visiting Secretary of State James A. Baker III. 
"This is a huge country where something is always happening somewhere."

GERMANY, POLAND READY TO SIGN TREATY TO GUARANTEE BORDER; 
</P>
<P>
EUROPE: KOHL MEETS WITH THE POLISH PRIME MINISTER. HE ALSO PROMISES POLES 
VISA-FREE TRAVEL BY CHRISTMAS.

<TEXT>
<P>
In a significant concession on timing, Chancellor Helmut Kohl agreed Thursday 
that Germany will sign a treaty with Poland within the next few weeks 
guaranteeing their common border. 
</P>
<P>
He also promised Poles visa-free travel into Germany by Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came at a news conference following nearly four hours of talks 
between Kohl and Polish Prime Minister in this German-Polish border city. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the wish of the Polish side that the border treaty be signed this year, 
and I've agreed to that," Kohl told reporters. "We will sign the border treaty 
in Warsaw in November." 
</P>
<P>
Kohl's reluctance to deal with the Polish border issue earlier this year 
angered and upset Polish leaders and stirred worries elsewhere in Europe about 
the future intentions of a united Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Although both Kohl and the German Parliament have since committed themselves to 
the treaty legally recognizing the 45-year-old border originally fixed by the 
victorious World War II Allies, he had hoped to postpone the signature until 
after next month's German national elections. 
</P>
<P>
The treaty has been opposed by a small but important minority of German voters 
who have strong cultural and emotional links with former German territories 
lost to Poland after the war. 
</P>
<P>
This minority has long held the dream of regaining the 43,500 square miles of 
German land that became western Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's announcement reflects the growing confidence among Kohl's campaign 
strategists that his position in the run-up to the Dec. 2 elections is 
virtually unassailable. His center-right coalition parties hold a clear 
majority in all major opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the concession is an important boost for Mazowiecki, in the thick 
of his own electoral race -- a tightly contested fight with Solidarity trade 
union leader Lech Walesa for the Polish presidency that will be decided Nov. 
25. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl and Mazowiecki also agreed to push ahead with a so-called "grand treaty" 
that would shape the future bilateral relationship between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
Building a positive relationship with Poland is widely regarded as one of 
Kohl's most difficult diplomatic challenges as he shapes policy for a newly 
united Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Difficult, often emotive problems -- including the question of compensation for 
wartime atrocities; the prospect of German financial aid to help Poland 
restructure its former Communist economy; the future of the estimated 750,000 
to 950,000 ethnic Germans in Poland, and the border issue -- all plague a 
relationship already loaded with centuries of mistrust and conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Genuine German-Polish reconciliation is viewed as vital, both for the future of 
the two countries and for the stability of Central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But interviews along the border and among Germans living in Poland earlier this 
week indicated the depth of the differences between the two peoples -- 
differences that unification has only widened. 
</P>
<P>
Since unity, for example, the border has become largely a one-way affair. 
</P>
<P>
As Mazowiecki's black Volvo limousine sped him to his meeting with Kohl across 
the so-called Friendship Bridge connecting the two countries over the Oder 
River, German shoppers with crisp new deutschemarks streamed across the same 
bridge in the opposite direction to pick up bargains at the Polish markets just 
across the river. 
</P>
<P>
Poles, unable to cross without visas, could only watch from their end of the 
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Standing with his infant son, 27-year-old truck driver Wilhelm Kowalsky said he 
felt a growing sense of separateness between Poles and Germans. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it was because I was younger, but before, we didn't feel they were 
Germans," he said. "Now, it threatens me a bit because they are such a power. 
</P>
<P>
"When I go over there I feel so tiny," he added. "They have money; I don't. 
When I go (to buy something), they look down on me." 
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt an der Oder, an elderly German woman said the city's facilities 
were already overloaded and that when Poles did come over, they tended to buy 
excessively. 
</P>
<P>
"The Poles are aggravating," she said. 
</P>
<P>
While some Germans said they prefer an open border, an equal number said they 
would like it to remain closed for Poles. 
</P>
<P>
The comments, made matter-of-factly and without overt bitterness, reflected a 
sense of growing distance between Poles and Germans who live in frequent 
contact. 
</P>
<P>
So far, incidents have been few and relatively minor. 
</P>
<P>
"If nationalist feelings don't get the upper hand, then all will go well," 
noted Wolfgang Globisch, a Roman Catholic priest for the German minority in the 
area of Kreuzburg, about 200 miles southeast of here. "But if these forces 
gather strength, then it could go bad."

MAN GUILTY IN SEX ASSAULT ON WOMAN WITH 46 IDENTITIES

A man was convicted Thursday of sexually assaulting a woman who doctors say has 
46 personalities after he testified that she consented to sex and he learned 
only later that she was mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
Mark A. Peterson was convicted of second-degree sexual assault and could be 
sentenced to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
He remained free on $5,000 bond. Sentencing was scheduled for Dec. 10 and he 
said he will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors heard psychiatrists disagree over the 27-year-old woman's contention 
that she was unaware that one of her personalities -- described as a fun-loving 
20-year-old woman -- was having sex. She said she learned of it from another 
personality, a girl the age of 6. 
</P>
<P>
The woman had testified Wednesday that Peterson, 29, manipulated the 
personality prevalent at the time to have intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
She summoned six different personalities to the witness stand. Four of them 
were sworn in individually. 
</P>
<P>
Under Wisconsin law, it is a crime to have sex with people known to suffer from 
a mental illness that makes them incapable of understanding their conduct.

TIME TO RETHINK ALBANIA'S HARD LINE, LEADER STRESSES;

EASTERN EUROPE: PRESIDENT ALIA SIGNALS A FURTHER SHIFT AWAY FROM THE COUNTRY'S 
ORTHODOX COMMUNIST PAST.

Albanian President Ramiz Alia says his hard-line Communist country should 
rethink enshrining the Communist Party's leading role and policy of atheism in 
the constitution, the state news agency reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Signaling a further shift away from the country's orthodox Communist past, Alia 
said the ruling Party of Labor of Albania "should not and cannot exert state 
power directly" but should respect the rule of law, according to remarks 
published by the official news agency ATA. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the establishment of normal diplomatic relations with the United 
States awaits only an announcement from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Alia, who is trying to introduce cautious reforms and bring his Balkan country 
slowly out of self-imposed isolation, also decried bureaucracy and a lack of 
discipline. 
</P>
<P>
The comments by Alia appeared to be another cautious step toward reform. 
</P>
<P>
The speech also seemed timed to influence a Paris summit that will decide later 
this month whether to admit Albania to an all-European system of cooperation 
and human rights. 
</P>
<P>
In the speech, Alia did not say the Communists should give up power or legalize 
a political opposition, nor did he suggest a specific constitutional amendment. 
</P>
<P>
The constitution refers to the party as the "only leading political force in 
the state," but Alia said that the Communists won that status "through 
struggle, work, self-denial, and adherence to the interests of the people and 
the homeland." 
</P>
<P>
That echoed Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's rationale earlier this year 
for calling on the Soviet Communist Party to give up its guaranteed monopoly on 
power.

The University of Utah chemist who says he produced nuclear fusion at room 
temperature emerged Thursday from a mysterious absence to defend his disputed 
work before the state oversight panel he angered by failing to appear last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Pons told the Utah Energy-Fusion Advisory Council that he remains 
committed to fusion research and dismissed concern about his whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
The state, which has appropriated $5 million to fund his fusion work, became 
concerned when Pons failed to appear before the panel amid reports he had taken 
his son out of school, sold his home and left the country. 
</P>
<P>
Pons said the furor surrounding his absence was regrettable. "People who want 
to contact us do not seem to have any problem," he added.

Pons said he wanted to take a leave of absence to work full time on fusion 
research. 
</P>
<P>
"I have requested sabbatical leave from the university to enable me to donate 
my full attention to our research," Pons said, adding that he would split his 
time between the university and working in France. "I intend to pursue our work 
in several labs with Martin Fleischmann" of England's Southampton University. 
</P>
<P>
Pons and Fleischmann stunned the scientific community in March, 1989, when they 
claimed to have produced a nuclear fusion reaction at room temperature in a 
relatively simple table-top experiment. The claim raised hopes that such a 
reaction could supply a cheap, plentiful source of power. 
</P>
<P>
The claim has since been dismissed by most scientists because they have been 
unable to reproduce the results, although some continue to report unexplained 
findings from their experiments. 
</P>
<P>
Pons said his recent work with Fleischmann "has led to the filing of a new 
patent application which we consider to be very important. We have also written 
two new papers describing this work which we expect to submit as soon as their 
release does not negate granting of patent protection." 
</P>
<P>
Fritz Will, director of the National Cold Fusion Institute at the university, 
said Pons' research would be separate from but complementary to work at the 
institute, which has a staff of about two dozen scientists.

EDUCATION: SPECIALTY SCHOOLS HAVE LONG OFFERED INNOVATIVE MATH AND SCIENCE 
PROGRAMS FOR TOP-NOTCH STUDENTS. NOW SOME ARE BROADENING THEIR ADMISSION 
POLICIES.

<P>
Ask any prominent American scientist or mathematician where he or she went to 
high school and you're likely to hear one of two places: Bronx High School of 
Science or Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Between them, these two New York public high schools have graduated half a 
dozen Nobel Prize winners. In their more than 100 years of operation, they have 
by most measures educated more top-echelon scientists and mathematicians than 
any other schools in the United States, public or private. 
</P>
<P>
While these schools, with their innovative curricula and highly gifted 
students, have become a subject of enormous scrutiny and controversy in recent 
years because they systematically exclude the vast majority of students, there 
are many scientists and educators who extol high-powered specialty science high 
schools as one of the most important solutions to the nation's growing problems 
in science and math. 
</P>
<P>
Only by identifying "the best and the brightest students" in a city or region 
and giving them "heavy doses of science and math at an early age" can the 
nation hope "to avert a crisis in science and technology," argued Nobel 
laureate Glenn T. Seaborg. 
</P>
<P>
Seaborg, the son of poor, Swedish immigrants, began his scientific education at 
David Starr Jordan High School in Watts in the 1920s. He managed to rise above 
his humble educational beginnings to go on to be a member of the Manhattan 
Project, chancellor of UC Berkeley, chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy 
Commission and winner of the 1940 Nobel Prize in chemistry for the discovery of 
plutonium. But his early schooling was not, he said, "the sort of beginning 
anyone can count on to produce a scientist or mathematician." 
</P>
<P>
Believing as Seaborg does that highly competitive specialty schools may be 
among the best and most reliable places to produce world-class researchers and 
inventors, many states over the last decade have been creating new schools 
modeled after Stuyvesant and Bronx Science. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, the country's 
first public boarding school, opened in Durham. In 1982, another public 
boarding school, the Louisiana School for Math, Science and the Arts, opened in 
Natchitoches, La. In 1985, a regional public day school, the Thomas Jefferson 
High School, a Governor's School for Science and Technology, opened in 
Alexandria, Va. on the outskirts of Washington. In 1986, the Illinois 
Mathematics and Science Academy began operations in Auroa, Ill., outside 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the South Carolina Governor's School for Science and Mathematics 
was created in Hartsville, S.C., and the Mississippi School for Mathematics and 
Science started in Columbus, Miss. Just this fall, California opened its first 
public, competitive science and math high school, the California Academy of 
Mathematics and Science at Cal State Dominguez Hills, near Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"These schools do not represent what's going on in the rest of the country, but 
they do represent our best hope for the future," said E. G. Sherburne Jr., 
publisher of Science News magazine and president of Science Service Inc., which 
administers the Westinghouse Science Talent Search, a prestigious nationwide 
competition for teen-age students of science. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason these schools work is quite simple," said Abe Baumel, who has been 
principal of Stuyvesant for more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
And despite what most people think, it has nothing to do with the 
qualifications of teachers or the quality of equipment or even the design of 
the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at this place," Baumel said. "The building is as old and broken down as I 
am. We have one chemistry lab and one physics lab, and they are both in 
abominable shape. The equipment is older than I am -- and in worse shape. The 
oak tables date back to 1904. The machine tools are so obsolete, they belong in 
the Smithsonian." 
</P>
<P>
The key to the success of a school is simply a matter of the quality of the 
student body. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the kids," Baumel said. "They're incredible. . . . There is a joke that 
it's harder to get in here than it is to get into Harvard. But it's no joke. 
</P>
<P>
"When you bring a group of these kids together, when you get a critical mass of 
them in one place, magic starts to happen." 
</P>
<P>
While not wanting to dilute this magic in any way, many of the specialty 
schools -- old as well as new -- are trying to reach out to students who might 
not ordinarily be expected to excel in science and math. 
</P>
<P>
Bronx Science, for example, has begun a special admissions programs for 
disadvantaged students and summer classes for students in regular public high 
schools who are interested in science and math, but who do not score high 
enough on entrance exams to be admitted to the regular academic program. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Jefferson has been trying to devise entirely new admissions criteria 
that emphasize motivation and grades rather than scores on standardized 
admissions tests. And the California Academy of Mathematics and Science has 
insisted on recruiting its first class not just from the top 1% or 2% of the 
student population but from the top 25%, drawing no more than two or three from 
each of 60 feeder schools in Los Angeles's South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that nearly 70% of the 116 entering freshmen are members of 
under-represented minority groups -- blacks, Latinos, Cambodians, Vietnamese -- 
and over half are female. 
</P>
<P>
Most specialty schools have been able to get as many as 80% of their graduates 
to pursue scientific careers, said Kathy Clark, principal of the new academy. 
"If we get anywhere close to that and yet serve the kind of population we are 
serving, surely we will have proved something very important."

MAIL-BOMB CASE DEFENSE SEEKS SPECIAL JUDGE

A man charged in mail bombings that killed a federal judge and a lawyer refused 
Thursday to enter a plea, pending his attempt to bar any federal judge from 
hearing the case. 
</P>
<P>
In a hearing before a federal magistrate, lawyers for Walter Leroy Moody Jr. 
said the fact that a federal judge was one of the victims damages the 
impartiality of all federal judges. 
</P>
<P>
Moody's attorneys requested in a court motion that the Senate Judiciary 
Committee appoint an independent officer to hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Magistrate William Harper referred the case to U.S. District Judge Richard 
Freeman for trial. No hearing was scheduled on the motion. An innocent plea was 
automatically entered for Moody because of his refusal to enter a plea. 
</P>
<P>
Special Assistant U.S. Atty. Howard Shapiro would not comment on the motion, 
which said every federal judge in the country has altered working habits and 
lifestyles because of the mail bombings last year. 
</P>
<P>
A federal indictment issued Wednesday includes a murder charge against Moody in 
the slaying of Judge Robert S. Vance in Alabama and explosives charges related 
to the death of Georgia civil rights lawyer Robert E. Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama officials said that Moody, 56, also may face state murder charges in 
the slaying of Vance, a member of the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities in Georgia said they have not seen enough of the evidence, most of 
it developed by federal authorities, to decide whether to press state charges 
against him in the death of Robinson in Savannah. 
</P>
<P>
The murder charge in the 70-count indictment carries a maximum penalty of life 
in prison and a $250,000 fine. No murder charge was included for Robinson's 
death. Moody was charged with transporting explosive material with intent to 
kill in that death. 
</P>
<P>
Moody also is charged with a variety of other offenses related to the bombings.

LAWRENCE DURRELL; AUTHOR OF 'ALEXANDRIA QUARTET' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lawrence Durrell, the India-born British novelist best known for his 
"Alexandria Quartet," has died at his home in Southern France. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
Durrell died Wednesday in the village of Sommieres, where he had lived for more 
than 30 years, his family announced Thursday. The family gave no cause of 
death, but Durrell had acknowledged in recent years that he suffered from 
emphysema. 
</P>
<P>
Born of British parents in India on Feb. 27, 1912, Durrell grew up in 
Darjeeling and lived internationally, drawing on his travels as inspiration for 
his books and poetry. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving India when he was 18, Durrell studied at Canterbury, settled briefly in 
London, then moved to the Greek island of Corfu. As a Foreign Service press 
officer, he lived in Athens and Cairo, and then spent the World War II years in 
Alexandria, Egypt. He later lived in Argentina, Yugoslavia and Cyprus before 
moving permanently to France. 
</P>
<P>
Based on his experience in Alexandria, Durrell wrote his famous quartet in 
France between 1957 and 1960. The four novels, which have been translated into 
20 languages, are titled "Justine," "Balthazar," "Mountolive" and "Clea." 
</P>
<P>
Durrell himself described the quartet, based on a theme of love as 
self-discovery, as "a continuum of words" and "a relativity poem." 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, Durrell spent a semester as Andrew W. Ellon visiting professor of 
English at Caltech -- primarily to be close to his good friend, American 
novelist Henry Miller, who died in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The two men exchanged letters for more than 40 years, providing mutual 
inspiration, encouragement and admiration. The letters were published in two 
volumes in 1963 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Miller had praised his friend as the master of the English language. 
</P>
<P>
Once asked by The Times how the two passed their time together, Miller said 
they engaged in such amusements as turning the color television set entirely 
green, tuning in professional wrestling and laughing their heads off. 
</P>
<P>
During his tenure at Caltech, Durrell lived in the faculty club, known as the 
Athenaeum, in a room once occupied by Albert Einstein. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I've been secreted away to some strange Pasadena monastery created 
for the retirement of Rudolph Valentino," he observed. 
</P>
<P>
The well-traveled writer enjoyed exploring Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"I actually went to Forest Lawn to mock," he told The Times, "and came away 
humbled. Despite the fairground atmosphere, the beauty of the landscape was 
touching. The statuary was awful, but public statuary everywhere is awful. 
</P>
<P>
"No one could criticize Forest Lawn," he added, "who has seen Lourdes, which is 
the most awful demonstration of religious vulgarity I can think of." 
</P>
<P>
He saw nothing unusual about the engagement of a wordsmith by a major center of 
science education and research. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very excited to teach literature at a great center of technology like 
this," he said, "because rather than a vast separation between two cultures, I 
see science as a force that has greatly altered poetry, literature and our 
whole understanding of humanism. At nearly the same time, the atom was split 
and the ego was split -- our age takes off from that point." 
</P>
<P>
Durrell was married three times and had two daughters, one of whom has died. He 
is survived by his daughter, Penelope Berengaria.

DAVID STIRLING; STARTED BRITAIN'S WWII SPECIAL AIR SERVICE UNIT

<P>
David Stirling, who founded Britain's elite Special Air Service in World War 
II, a unit that relied on stealth and skill to kill Germans and, years later, 
to free hostages, has died, his biographer reported. 
</P>
<P>
Stirling was 74 when he died Sunday night in the London Clinic after what Alan 
Hoe, a former SAS major and Stirling's biographer, described only as a long 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
The SAS, whose motto is "Who Dares Wins," has maintained its reputation for 
swift, clandestine and effective action. One of its more recent exploits was 
its assault on the Iranian Embassy in London on May 5, 1980, to end a siege by 
gunmen holding hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Born Archibald David Stirling, the son of a Scottish brigadier general, he 
joined the Scots Guards at the outbreak of World War II. Six months later he 
transferred to No. 3 commando group of the Brigade of Guards and went with them 
to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
He persuaded military authorities that "an army within an army" was needed to 
make swift, secret raids against the enemy. They gave him six officers and 60 
enlisted men to try out his theories in the Western Desert. 
</P>
<P>
Stirling became known as the "Phantom Major" among the German troops of Field 
Marshal Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps after destroying 250 enemy aircraft and 
scores of fuel and ammunition dumps in attacks on the enemy rear. 
</P>
<P>
His tactics of operating so far behind German lines that his men could 
virtually walk into their targets -- and then "retreating" even farther into 
enemy territory against all expectations -- helped gain him legendary status. 
</P>
<P>
In 1943, Stirling was taken prisoner in Tunisia. He escaped, was recaptured and 
was transferred to Colditz Castle prison camp, where he remained for the rest 
of the war.

Three of the four Santa Fe railway workers killed in a crash here, including a 
woman brake operator working her first shift ever, burned to death after 
jumping from their locomotive just before it rammed an oncoming freight train, 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"The indications to me are that they had gotten out and then the explosion 
occurred," said Deputy Riverside County Coroner Alan Wesefeldt. 
</P>
<P>
Officials believe that the Wednesday morning accident occurred because the 
6,094-foot westbound train, for reasons that remain under investigation, failed 
to fully stop within an 8,370-foot-long side track and veered into the 
oncoming, Chicago-bound freight. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. on Thursday 
confirmed the identities of all four workers who were killed. On the westbound, 
they were brake operator Virginia C. Hartzell, 29, of Baldwin Park; engineer 
Gary R. Ledoux, 35, of Highland, and conductor James S. Wakefield, 55, of 
Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
The one crew member killed on the Chicago-bound freight was brakeman Ronald A. 
Westervelt, 52, of San Bernardino. Westervelt, whose body was found aboard his 
locomotive, died from massive head injuries and burns, according to Wesefeldt, 
the deputy coroner. 
</P>
<P>
Westervelt's two surviving colleagues on the eastbound, engineer James Dawson, 
50, and conductor Warren Sanders, 51, remained hospitalized at separate 
Riverside County hospitals with various broken bones and cuts. A nursing 
supervisor described Dawson's condition as serious; Sanders was listed in fair 
condition.

JOSEPH TOY; INSTRUMENTAL IN L.A.'S GAY PRIDE FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joseph Toy, 44, past president of Christopher Street West, the principal 
sponsor of the two-decade-old annual Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Pride Festival 
that last June drew 300,000 people and about 300 participating units to the 
streets of West Hollywood. The nonprofit group -- named for the street in 
Greenwich Village where 20 years ago police raided a homosexual bar, sparking a 
demonstration and the birth of the gay rights movement -- each year awards more 
than $100,000 to gay and lesbian support groups. Toy was an administrator for 
the Automobile Club of Southern California when he died Monday of complications 
of AIDS at a Long Beach hospital.

MAURICE MANN; FORMER HEAD OF STOCK EXCHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maurice Mann, who served as chairman of the Pacific Stock Exchange until last 
January, has died of a heart attack, his family said Thursday from San 
Francisco. He was 61. 
</P>
<P>
Mann, who lived in San Francisco, was flying from Miami to San Diego for an 
investment conference when he was fatally stricken aboard a plane Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Mann served this institution and the many others with which he was 
affiliated throughout his career with distinction," Leopold Korins, Mann's 
successor, said in a memo announcing the death to the exchange's 450 employees. 
"His passing is a loss that will be deeply felt throughout this exchange and 
around the country." 
</P>
<P>
After Mann stepped down as chairman, he had continued as a consultant to the 
exchange. 
</P>
<P>
During his three years at the helm of the regional stock exchange based in San 
Francisco and Los Angeles, Mann had worked to improve the organization's 
identity and establish its place in the growing Pacific Rim economy. 
</P>
<P>
To streamline the exchange, he phased out its money-losing stock clearing and 
depository operation, and encouraged trading links and joint ventures with 
other exchanges. He also added directors of marketing, planning, public 
relations and governmental affairs to boost the exchange's image and clout and 
to develop new products. 
</P>
<P>
After the Dow Jones Industrial Average's dramatic plunge in October, 1987, Mann 
tried to exert a calming influence, holding eight news conferences in one week. 
Despite "one of the most significant events in U.S. financial history," he said 
repeatedly, "the system is still working." 
</P>
<P>
A longtime investment banker, Mann had served as vice chairman of Merrill Lynch 
Capital Markets, and a company it acquired, Becker Paribas, before going to the 
stock exchange in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Mann also regulated savings and loan associations as president and chief 
executive officer of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco from 1973 to 
1978. He was credited with introducing new lending products to help member 
thrifts deal with deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very innovative in an industry that had not shown much innovation," 
said Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. "He 
told them their world was changing (in ways) that would make their life more 
difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Early in the Administration of President Richard M. Nixon, Mann was assistant 
director of the Office of Management and Budget. He participated in President 
Gerald R. Ford's economic summit conference on inflation in 1974, and was a 
member of President Ronald Reagan's commission on housing from 1981 to 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Mann also served as vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and 
vice president of Equibank in Pittsburgh, and taught economics for a time at 
Ohio Wesleyan University. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Peabody, Mass., he earned his bachelor's degree at Northeastern 
University in Boston, his master's at Boston University and his doctorate at 
Syracuse University. 
</P>
<P>
Mann is survived by his wife, Betty; two daughters, Debbie and Pamela, and one 
granddaughter, Melissa Mann Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Services are scheduled for 1 p.m. today at Temple Emanu-el in San Francisco. 
The family has asked that any memorial contributions be made to a donor's 
favorite charity.

GROUP FILES SUIT AGAINST SCE OVER FISH, KELP LOSSES; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: EARTH ISLAND INSTITUTE DEMANDS THAT THE SAN ONOFRE NUCLEAR PLANT 
EITHER FIX ITS COOLING SYSTEM OR SHUT DOWN.

<P>
Charging that the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station is violating federal 
law by killing off tons of fish and kelp, an environmental group filed suit 
Thursday against Southern California Edison Co. demanding a stop to the 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed about a year after a 15-year, $46-million study found that 
the nuclear plant north of Oceanside is, indeed, killing tons of fish and kelp. 
</P>
<P>
But since then, neither Edison nor state regulatory agencies have taken action 
on the findings, according to the suit, filed by Earth Island Institute, a San 
Francisco-based environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in federal court in San Diego, demands that Edison either fix 
the plant's cooling system, which the study said is responsible for most of the 
fish and kelp kills, or shut the plant. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also says Edison should be ordered to establish an environmental trust 
fund to restore fish and kelp levels, and asks for unspecified monetary 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pie-in-the-sky until we win, which we intend to do," said one of Earth 
Island's San Diego lawyers, Charles S. Crandall. "But we want the plant to 
comply and to make restoration for the damage it has done -- and it has done 
damage, clearly." 
</P>
<P>
An Edison spokesman, David Barron, said the utility's lawyers had not seen the 
suit. But he said the utility is in compliance with all federal environmental 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
"The marine life offshore is thriving, despite some limited effects from 
operation of plant, as one would expect," Barron said. 
</P>
<P>
The San Onofre plant is on the beach about 12 miles northwest of Oceanside, 
within the Marine Corps' base at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
Edison operates three nuclear-powered units at the plant. The first opened in 
1968, while the second and third opened in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that Rosemead-based Edison, a subsidiary of SCECorp., has been 
violating the federal Clean Water Act simply by operating the plant. 
</P>
<P>
According to the suit, fish are killed when massive amounts of water are taken 
in to the plant to cool the reactors. Kelp, according to the suit, dies from 
particles that return with the water and either land on the fronds or block 
sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law requires Edison to obtain a permit to operate from the state Water 
Quality Board and from the California Coastal Commission. Operation of the 
plant (in such a way as to kill marine life) technically violates the water 
board's permit, the suit contends. 
</P>
<P>
The suit relies heavily on the study, which was ordered by the Coastal 
Commission and issued in August 1989. 
</P>
<P>
It found that the nuclear plant had caused a 60%, or 200-acre, reduction in the 
area covered by the nearby kelp bed. 
</P>
<P>
It also found that the plant's cooling system sucks up and kills 21 to 57 tons 
of fish yearly, then discharges debris-filled water into the ocean, reducing 
natural light levels on the ocean floor by as much as 16%. 
</P>
<P>
The study was issued by a panel created in 1974 by the Coastal Commission as a 
condition of its granting Edison a construction permit to expand from one 
reactor to three. 
</P>
<P>
The study, completely financed by Edison, was intended to provide an 
independent scientific review of the plant's impact by appointing one biologist 
for each special interest -- Edison, the environmentalists and the Coastal 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Edison spokesman Barron said the study was not designed to compel compliance. 
Besides, he said, it "did not find an ecological disaster."

HONK IF YOU VOTED FOR POWAY'S SNESKO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a busy Poway street corner Thursday, B. Tony Snesko was waving a sign and 
savoring the fruits of victory. His sign said simply: "Thank you." 
</P>
<P>
The sound of motorists' horns honking a hello sounded like trumpets to him and 
the waving shouts of passers-by were music to his ears. He let out a hearty 
"har, har, har" reminiscent of St. Nicholas and waved his thank-you sign in 
response. 
</P>
<P>
Snesko, 44, a self-proclaimed born-again Christian and anti-abortionist, tossed 
his 10-gallon hat in the ring for a Poway City Council seat last summer and 
devoted all of his time and energy, and a little bit of money, to his first 
political campaign. 
</P>
<P>
For weeks, Snesko rose before dawn and was out on one of Poway's busy streets 
by 5:30 each morning, setting out his rhyming Burma Shave-style signs, then 
positioning himself in a prominent place to wave a poster urging people to 
"Vote for Tony Snesko." 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I'd take four hours off in the middle of the day to attend to other 
campaign matters," he confessed. "But I was out there every day on the street, 
dawn to dusk." 
</P>
<P>
He used his Burma Shave signs to sum up the issues. One of his favorites: 
"Traffic bad?" "Development, too?" "Promises broken" "Got you blue?" "Vote Tony 
Snesko." 
</P>
<P>
Why did he take to the streets to get his campaign message across? Because 
Poway is a commuter community, and Snesko knew he could get more name and face 
recognition on one of the three main streets than he could knocking on doors. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor-elect Jan Goldsmith paid him an oblique compliment after the election: 
"The face of politics in Poway has been changed forever," Goldsmith said of 
Snesko's cowboy attire and street-corner campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic congestion, Poway's main gripe, was Snesko's main campaign theme. He 
started off in July by announcing his candidacy for Poway City Council in front 
of the barricades placed across a popular Poway "shortcut" to San Diego -- 
Pomerado Road -- and blasting incumbent council members for "taking a 
wait-and-see attitude toward problems of growth, traffic, the city's youth and 
housing for the elderly." He criticized the council for not filing suit against 
San Diego City Council to force reopening of Pomerado Road. 
</P>
<P>
After his unexpected victory in Tuesday's election, Snesko was back on his 
street corner, this time with his thank-you sign. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was out early this morning it was so cold that the breeze from the 
passing cars brought tears to my eyes, which froze on my cheeks," he said, "but 
I had to say thank you to my friends who voted for me."

CUBAN SPY SEEKING ASYLUM IS FREED FROM JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A self-described Cuban double-agent, who says he duped Washington spymasters 
for years but has now renounced communism, was ordered freed on bond Thursday 
in San Diego, despite objections from U.S. authorities, who maintain he is a 
security risk. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Immigration Judge John Williams ordered the release of Juan Manuel 
Rodriguez Camejo on $7,500 bail after rejecting U.S. government claims that 
Rodriguez poses a threat to U.S. security and should remain in jail. 
</P>
<P>
The decision is the latest twist in the perplexing case of a prospective 
defector who is clearly not being welcomed by U.S. officials, despite his 
acknowledged affiliation with Cuban intelligence services and his proclaimed 
conversion to capitalism and democracy after being a strict adherent of 
Cuban-style communism and authoritarianism. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, who U.S. authorities say remains a Cuban agent, is expected to be 
freed today from federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez has portrayed himself as the product of a worldwide democratic tide, 
contending that he is now a sworn enemy of Fidel Castro, the Cuban president, 
whom he once idolized. He says he faces certain death if returned to Cuba and 
now seeks to defect to the United States, adopted home of his wife's father, 
Inocente Montes de Oca, a wealthy, Cuban-born businessman who lives in Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"Fidel must go," an exultant Rodriguez, dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit, 
declared in an impromptu interview shortly after the judge's decision. "We are 
seeing the collapse of communism everywhere. . . . I am part of this movement." 
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities vowed to appeal the decision to the Board of Immigration 
Appeals and to the U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, 40, described himself in court papers as a Cuban 
counter-intelligence agent with two decades of experience who was recruited by 
the Central Intelligence Agency as a double agent, in 1979 or 1980. He said he 
remained with the CIA in Havana until 1987, but actually worked to rid Cuba of 
CIA influence and "foreign interference," using his knowledge of the agency's 
extensive Cuban networks. 
</P>
<P>
CIA officials have declined to comment on his story, but an attorney for the 
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization service said in court Thursday that 
Rodriguez is still an unreformed "agent" of Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
"Being in the United States would be an excellent cover for him," said Joseph 
Ragusa, the U.S. immigration service attorney who argued, unsuccessfully, that 
Rodriguez should remain jailed while his application for asylum in the United 
States is being adjudicated. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez and his attorney, Judith L. Wood of Los Angeles, have suggested that 
the CIA has a grudge against him because of his activities against CIA 
operatives in Cuba, thus explaining the unreceptive posture of the U.S. 
government. Mark Mansfield, a CIA spokesman in Langley, Va., declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. immigration authorities have rejected Rodriguez's initial bid for 
political asylum, contending that he is still a Cuban spy and has not 
demonstrated the likelihood of persecution if he returns to Cuba. The case 
could drag on for a year or more. 
</P>
<P>
The latest chapter in Rodriguez's saga began to unfold on Oct. 21, when 
Rodriguez, his wife and his 6-year-old daughter presented themselves at the 
U.S.-Mexico border in San Diego. They requested safe haven on U.S. soil. 
Immigration officials and agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
questioned Rodriguez. But authorities initially rejected his request, and 
Rodriguez and family were escorted back to Tijuana, according to court 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, Rodriguez, his wife and child illegally entered the United States 
from Tijuana and were apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol officers. Rodriguez, 
saying he feared Cuban intelligence agents in Mexico, had grown a beard as a 
disguise and had his daughter's hair dyed orange, according to his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The family's efforts to enter the United States began in Europe last spring, 
Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said he approached U.S. consular officials in Hamburg, Germany, in 
May, unsuccessfully seeking U.S. political asylum. By then, he stated in court 
documents, suspicious Cuban agents were monitoring his moves, and he and his 
family were harassed and threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said he was in Germany working for a pharmaceutical company. The U.S. 
government maintains that was a cover for his spying. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez described himself in the interview and in court papers as a onetime 
Communist hard-liner who has come to see the error of his ways and who even 
began to plot against Castro's leadership, drawing the suspicion of Cuban 
security forces. He contends he was part of a much-publicized 1989 conspiracy 
to oust Castro, an effort that led to the executions of several high-ranking 
Cuban officials implicated. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, Rodriguez said in a court declaration, he has sought to leave Cuba, 
along with his wife, Mimna Montes de Oca Aldavert, 30, and the couple's 
daughter, Paola Rodriguez Montes de Oca. 
</P>
<P>
But the opportunity to leave did not present itself until Oct. 17, when the 
three flew to Mexico City with the intention of defecting to U.S. authorities 
in California, according to Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
"I plan to continue fighting for the freedom of my people," Rodriguez told 
reporters after the judge's decision, explaining that he seeks to join the 
swollen anti-Castro ranks in the United States. "Now democratic forces are very 
strong; he (Castro) has lost the battle." 
</P>
<P>
Judge Williams made his decision to set bond for Rodriguez after recessing 
court for 15 minutes and returning to his chambers to review a secret, 
eight-page U.S. document presented in support of the government's contention 
that Rodriguez should remain jailed. The report was not persuasive, the judge 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez's wife and child were previously freed from detention on $2,000 bond 
each. 
</P>
<P>
The would-be defector's wealthy in-laws in Beverly Hills hired a public 
relations firm to put a positive light on Rodriguez's plight. The firm 
scheduled a noon press conference Thursday outside of the Metropolitan 
Correctional Center in downtown San Diego, but Rodriguez never showed up. 
</P>
<P>
"Inmates just do not call press conferences," said Ron Roberts, warden of the 
850-prisoner federal jail, where Rodriguez was being held. "If we allowed 
inmates to have press conferences, can you imagine what kind of a madhouse I 
would have?"

GRACEFUL EXIT FOR DUFFY? VOTE IS STILL OUT; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: JIM ROACHE MAY FIND THE GOING ROUGH AS HE TRIES TO TAKE THE REINS 
FROM THE SHERIFF, WHO ONCE PREDICTED A PERIOD OF 'MALICIOUS OBEDIENCE' IF 
ROACHE WERE ELECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several weeks before Tuesday's election, Sheriff John Duffy weighed the 
possibility of reform candidate Jim Roache replacing him. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy described a period of "malicious obedience" within the department, 
whereby the rank-and-file would do what was asked of them and nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll be left with 2,300 Civil Service employees with a tenured right to be 
in the department who don't want to be led by him," Duffy said. "That's not 
serving the public well." 
</P>
<P>
Now Roache is sheriff-elect, and many somber deputies who staunchly supported 
Jack Drown are trying to make peace with their sheriff-to-be. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy is another matter. The morning after Tuesday's election, Duffy flew to 
Hawaii for a criminal-intelligence conference. A spokesman said he would not be 
back in the office until next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody knows just how Duffy will react once he contemplates Roache taking over 
the department he has tightly controlled for the past 20 years. Some have 
speculated that Duffy will spend his last days making a series of promotions, 
transfers and other decisions right up until noon on Jan. 7, when Roache is 
sworn in. 
</P>
<P>
Or at the very least, they say, Duffy might make it difficult for Roache to 
move in early and get started. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst he can do is not provide Jim the access he needs and the ability to 
be part and parcel of the decision-making process," said Assistant Sheriff Jack 
Drown, whom Roache defeated Tuesday by nearly 60,000 votes. "I don't think 
he'll go out of his way to help, but he's not going to go out of his way to 
subvert anything." 
</P>
<P>
"I think Duffy will go out with the throttle full speed ahead," said Everett 
Bobbitt, an attorney who represents sheriff's deputies and has been tapped as a 
member of Roache's transition team. "In what direction he'll go, it's hard to 
say, but he'll bear watching." 
</P>
<P>
Roache said he will ask Duffy next week for a face-to-face meeting, at which he 
will try to make amends. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be me asking him for his assistance in making this transition 
smooth and making sure operations continue unabated," Roache said. "I want him 
to know that, in the best interests of the department, we both have an 
obligation to do the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
It is important for him to have his staff in place on Jan. 7, Roache said, and, 
to do that, he needs to have access to budgets, flow charts, manpower levels 
and other documents. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy made it clear in earlier interviews with The Times that he did not 
consider Roache qualified. He said it was impossible for any captain to take 
over as sheriff after skipping three levels of command. 
</P>
<P>
The very best captain of the 17 he had couldn't do it, Duffy said, and Roache 
was ranked "in the lower third." 
</P>
<P>
"If he is elected, he is not competent to run this department," Duffy said. "He 
has no relationship with the (Board of Supervisors) offices. He's never had 
anything to do with the budget process. He's never been in our weekly executive 
management team meetings. He's never formed policy, nor has he suggested one 
policy change." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy said it would be a terrible mistake for Roache to fire Drown, two other 
assistant sheriffs and the undersheriff, because those administrators have the 
most experience running the department. All four serve at the sheriff's 
pleasure and are not protected by Civil Service regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Roache said he doesn't know who will go and who will stay, but made it clear 
during the campaign that he intended to make a clean sweep. Sheriff's Capt. 
Maudie Bobbitt, who is also on Roache's transition team, has been mentioned for 
Drown's job. Poway Capt. Jay La Suer, who won a seat Tuesday on the La Mesa 
City Council, has been mentioned as undersheriff. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Sheriff Richard Reed, who has been with the agency nearly 22 years 
and is likely to be replaced, said Thursday that it would be a mistake to 
promote out of the department's chain of command. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll throw John Duffy's good old boys out and bring in his own good old 
boys," Reed said. "Everyone who has been promoted here has done so within the 
sworn ranks. Everyone in our administration has held every rank within our 
chain of command. Bringing people in from the outside would be a radical 
departure from what we've been doing." 
</P>
<P>
Reed said he is not sure what tone the department will take in the last two 
months of Duffy's administration. He said Duffy blames Roache for many of the 
press leaks that have occurred over the past year, particularly information 
about whether Duffy used public funds for a home-security system or other 
details of Duffy's house. 
</P>
<P>
Drown said there is little Duffy can do. Although there were rumors of Duffy 
making last-minute promotions, there are few vacant positions within the 
officers' ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Bobbitt said there are no openings for captain or lieutenant and no current 
list of applicants who have passed the sergeant's test from which to choose. 
Bobbitt said Roache could negate any transfers Duffy might make. 
</P>
<P>
"What could he do?" Drown asked. "In the grand scheme of things, he couldn't 
put too much sugar in the gas tank. We're pretty bound by the constraints of 
bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
In his final 60 days, Duffy still must deal with the Board of Supervisors. The 
board is planning to take legal action today against Duffy over his creation of 
a separate bank account established to bypass their spending authority over 
hundreds of thousands of dollars the department has seized in drug raids. 
</P>
<P>
County counsel is expected to seek a court order to make Duffy immediately list 
all deposits in the secret account, return the full amount, including the 
$70,000 he spent on his legal fees, and prevent him from setting up any new 
secret accounts, said county spokesman Bob Lerner. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy has maintained that the money is his to spend because it comes from the 
federal government. He said the county has no jurisdiction over the funds. 
County supervisors, who say Duffy has violated a county ordinance by refusing 
to turn over the money and for spending it without county approval, want Duffy 
to return the money, estimated at over $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Many have suggested that a wave of negative publicity about Duffy last month 
helped Roache beat Drown and tarnished Duffy's 20-year career.

CAMP PENDLETON BLAZE FULLY OUT, FREEWAY OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Camp Pendleton fire that forced the closing of Interstate 5 between 
Oceanside and San Clemente on Wednesday was contained at daybreak Thursday and 
was expected to be fully out by the end of the day, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic along I-5 was moving normally, despite some lingering smoke from the 
last few hot spots, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak service also returned to normal, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire burned 4,800 acres of grass and brush, said Cpl. Ray Sears, a Camp 
Pendleton spokesman. Earlier estimates that the blaze blackened 7,000 acres 
were overstated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cause of the fire, which started near the northwestern corner of the sprawling 
Marine Corps base, remained under investigation. The area is used for maneuvers 
and training but not as an artillery target, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire erupted Tuesday evening, and the CHP closed I-5 about 2 a.m. 
Wednesday. It remained closed until about 5 p.m. Wednesday, frustrating tens of 
thousands of motorists and forcing some Amtrak trains between San Diego and Los 
Angeles into long delays. It was the longest the freeway had ever been closed, 
the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire approached the San Onofre Nuclear Power Plant and prompted a low-level 
alert, but operations there were not affected. Structures at the U.S. Border 
Patrol checkpoint were singed but otherwise undamaged. 
</P>
<P>
The fire also swept through the popular San Onofre State Beach, burning 
shrubbery but not destroying any buildings, said park aide Mindy Walker. She 
said the park will be closed for about a week for cleanup, and those with 
camping reservations are being sent instead to the San Clemente State Beach 
Park.

MORE THAN 1%, DESPITE EARLIER CUTS.

Torrance teachers, frustrated by prolonged contract negotiations, will meet 
with school district representatives next week in what one union official calls 
a "budget summit" to examine district spending plans. 
</P>
<P>
"A budget conference is a necessity at this point if we're to move forward to 
resolve the contract dispute that's in front of us," said William A. Franchini, 
executive director of the Torrance Teachers Assn. The two sides will see if 
they can agree on what money is available, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A wide gulf separates teachers from administrators at the bargaining table. The 
teachers have asked for an 8% salary increase, but district officials say a 1% 
raise is all they can afford. 
</P>
<P>
That gulf was dramatized Monday when more than 250 teachers picketed outside a 
meeting of the Torrance school board, chanting, "Contract, contract" and "We 
want new leadership." 
</P>
<P>
But as teachers raised picket signs on the sidewalks below, school 
administrators and trustees were discussing problems with the district's 
$80-million budget for 1990-91. The Los Angeles County Office of Education told 
Torrance school officials in a letter Nov. 1 that it could not approve that 
budget because the district hadn't set aside enough money in its reserve fund. 
</P>
<P>
District officials have already trimmed nearly $3 million from the budget this 
year. Last month they laid off 39 non-teaching employees. The officials say 
they will be able to meet the county's budget standards without further layoffs 
but cannot grant the teachers' salary requests. 
</P>
<P>
Some teachers argue, however, that money can be found for larger raises. They 
warn that teachers' morale is sagging because of large classes, long hours and 
pay that they say is not keeping pace with medical and other costs. 
</P>
<P>
To communicate their concerns, teachers organized a post-card writing campaign 
last month aimed at school trustees. 
</P>
<P>
One high school teacher wrote: "I am working longer hours than ever before, but 
because of health-care costs, my take-home pay is less than last year." 
</P>
<P>
Two elementary school teachers interviewed during the picketing Monday said 
they deserve more than a 1% increase. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people don't realize the amount of hours you do put in," said Theresa 
Pruitt, who teaches at Lincoln Elementary School. "You get to work two hours 
before (classes) and stay two hours afterwards." And teachers are not paid 
overtime, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In a presentation to the school board, union President Bert Ladre called on the 
district to allow its bargaining representatives to be more flexible and 
creative. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't send them to the table with the necessary tools to get the job 
done, then we are headed down a path which will be educationally disruptive and 
unfortunately unavoidable," Ladre said. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers' three-year contract with the district expired June 30. Teachers 
received a 4% raise in 1987-88, a 7% raise the following year and 8% last year, 
Franchini said. 
</P>
<P>
A 1989-90 survey by the county showed that a teacher with a bachelor's degree 
and no experience earned a beginning salary of $24,869 in Torrance, placing the 
district 22nd among 43 unified school districts in the county. The maximum 
salary for a teacher with 25 years' experience was $48,090, placing the 
district 16th in the county. 
</P>
<P>
This year, school officials say they simply cannot afford to give teachers 
another 8% raise. It would cost the district $3 million, compared to $370,000 
if the teachers get a 1% raise, said Supt. Edward Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
The district's current offer includes a $250,000 increase in medical benefits 
and the promise of another 1% salary increase if state school aid increases. 
The district lost $995,000 when Gov. George Deukmejian set the cost-of-living 
adjustment for schools at 3% instead of the 4.76% approved by the Legislature. 
School officials are hoping Gov.-elect Pete Wilson will restore the funds. 
</P>
<P>
Two school board members said in interviews Thursday that the district cannot 
afford 8% raises for teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"They seem to think we've got money squirreled away. Hey, fine. If you find 
some, let me know," said board Vice President David Sargent. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have the reserve to fall back on," said Trustee John Eubanks. "That's 
why I think going out on a limb to offer a raise . . . could get us in real 
trouble. You can't take back raises. All you can do is lay more people off." 
</P>
<P>
The district laid off the 39 employees, including many maintenance workers, 
last month during a round of cuts totaling $1.46 million. In March, the board 
had made $1.5 million in cuts. 
</P>
<P>
But its final $80-million budget was still not conservative enough for county 
budget inspectors. In particular, the county criticized the designated reserve 
of $2.25 million, saying it should be higher. 
</P>
<P>
In its letter, the county Office of Education said the district needs a larger 
reserve because it overbudgeted its lottery income by at least $317,000 and 
failed to include money for an additional $440,000 fee the district may need to 
pay the county for collecting and distributing property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The board will take up the issue at its Nov. 19 meeting, Richardson said. He 
said he does not anticipate any more layoffs because of the budget problem. 
</P>
<P>
The county letter is part of a new, more stringent budget review process 
instituted last year, said Max Carrigan, assistant director of financial 
management services at the county education office. 
</P>
<P>
"It's to be sure that the district remains solvent and doesn't run out of money 
by the end of the school year," Carrigan said. Of the 82 school districts in 
the county, about one-third probably will get review letters like that sent to 
Torrance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The letter was made public at the Monday night board meeting as some picketers 
still milled on the sidewalks below. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame that the teachers picketing out there didn't have that (letter) 
in hand," Sargent said.

PALMDALE PICKS DOWNTOWN SITE FOR NEW CIVIC CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Palmdale officials decided Thursday that the $60-million Civic Center complex 
they hope to build should be located in the same area as the present City Hall 
to reclaim the decrepit downtown area and expand facilities to serve a 
fast-growing population. 
</P>
<P>
By a 5-0 vote, the Palmdale City Council accepted a consultant's recommendation 
that a new Civic Center should be developed in the downtown area, not on either 
of two proposed westside sites that are now vacant. 
</P>
<P>
The council also gave the go-ahead for city officials and consultants to 
develop more detailed plans for the downtown site at the southeast corner of 
Palmdale Boulevard and Sierra Highway. 
</P>
<P>
But how the city would raise the needed money, and how soon, remained major 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
Given the reduction in the city's income from dwindling development fees, the 
project may take many years, warned City Administrator Robert Toone. 
</P>
<P>
A city consultant last month recommended that the city proceed with the Civic 
Center project in three phases. The first, which city officials hope to 
complete by 1994, would consist of a 125,000-square-foot City Hall and an 
11,000-square-foot county fire station. 
</P>
<P>
The report by the ROMA Design Group of San Francisco said those projects and 
related work, including the demolition of six houses, would cost nearly $30 
million. Actual costs are expected to be higher, though, since all the 
estimates are at 1990 prices. 
</P>
<P>
The second phase would be a new 63,000-square-foot city library and related 
parking area, costing about $14 million. The $16-million third phase would 
consist of a town square area, a 66,000-square-foot recreation center and the 
start of a downtown park. No timetable was set for either phase. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they need the new facilities to cope with a city population 
that has grown from 12,277 to 65,357 in the past decade, and is expected to 
double again to about 125,000 by the year 2000. Palmdale's current City Hall, 
library and related facilities were built in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The city's municipal work force, which expanded from about 182 to 270 employees 
in the past four years, has already outgrown the current city buildings. 
Earlier this year the city bought a nearby school building for office space and 
set up several portable buildings on nearby land. 
</P>
<P>
The new Civic Center project, in addition to displacing the houses and some 
businesses, would require the demolition of the old county fire station and the 
city's planning annex. But the current City Hall, library and Cultural Center 
could be kept and used for other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and consultants said the main reason for locating the planned 
Civic Center on the same downtown site is to try to revitalize the decrepit 
area, which is plagued by vacant lots, a run-down shopping center and old strip 
commercial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"A Civic Center at this location has an excellent potential to create a real 
Town Center for Palmdale -- both as a physical landmark, a gathering place for 
the community, and a new mixed-use center of activity," said the consultants in 
their report to the city. 
</P>
<P>
The city owns about 11 of the 25 acres needed in the area bounded by Palmdale 
Boulevard, Sierra Highway, 10th Street East and a line north of Avenue R. 
Buying the remaining 14 acres is expected to cost about $8 million of the 
$60-million total. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night's decision eliminated two alternative sites for the civic 
center, which would have cost more, the consultants said. The Trakell Corp., 
developer of the auto mall now being built in Palmdale, had offered a nearby 
site of 20 to 24 acres on 10th Street West for $9 million to $10 million. 
Another private owner had offered a 25-acre site on Palmdale Boulevard at 5th 
Street West for about $14 million.

NEIGHBORS OF CSUN COMPLAIN ABOUT NOISE; 
</P>
<P>
NORTHRIDGE: UNIVERSITY ACCREDITATION TEAM MEMBERS ARE TOLD THAT WEEKEND NIGHTS 
HAVE BECOME UNBEARABLE SINCE NEW DORMS WERE OPENED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Neighbors of Cal State Northridge complained to an educational oversight team 
Thursday that they are besieged with the byproducts of unruly students: 
excessive noise, empty alcohol bottles, food wrappers and even discarded 
underwear. 
</P>
<P>
The 17 Northridge residents who attended the open forum of the Western Assn. of 
Schools and Colleges, which assesses and certifies the performance of academic 
institutions, said that since the newest CSUN dormitories opened two years ago, 
weekend nights have become unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
They said the university has been largely unresponsive to their complaints -- 
over everything from gang violence to car radios blaring until 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they know how to run what is really a small city," said Mike 
Chambers, a CSUN alumnus who has lived one block from the college for six 
years. "I feel that this university is running its community relations program 
with the neighborhood kind of like ostriches with their heads in the sand." 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the campus housing director acknowledged that there are 
problems, especially on weekends, but she said they are caused mostly by 
non-students and students who live off campus but come to the school in search 
of parties. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Gruendler, director of housing services for the 2,000 dormitory 
residents, said she had noticed a slight increase in complaints this fall. 
</P>
<P>
"Every call that comes in is handled," she said. "We are just as concerned as 
they are about people who drive up and down the streets at 2 a.m. We get 
complaints from students about that too." 
</P>
<P>
The two accreditation team members who attended Thursday's forum said they were 
alarmed by the neighborhood complaints. 
</P>
<P>
As part of their weeklong investigation of the campus, they are studying its 
relationship to the surrounding community, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at this as a student governance issue," said Cecilia Burciaga, an 
associate dean at Stanford. "I want to know what are the student alcohol 
policies on campus, what is the honor code, what kind of morals are these kids 
being taught?" 
</P>
<P>
Raymund Paredes, vice chancellor for academic administration at UCLA and also a 
member of the accrediting team, said he would bring the neighborhood complaints 
to the attention of CSUN administrators, who he said had assured him earlier in 
the week that the university's relationship with the community was "extremely 
good." 
</P>
<P>
Paredes also urged the neighbors to form a homeowners association so their 
concerns could be funneled through one spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Such organizations in Westwood led to many changes in UCLA's growth plans, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Campus spokeswoman Ann Salisbury said after the meeting that CSUN also had 
modified its expansion plans based on community comments during planning 
meetings held in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
That expansion includes the scheduled opening of a dormitory to house 928 more 
students next fall. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN President James W. Cleary has formed a committee to investigate ways to 
limit access to the campus by outsiders, Salisbury said.

VICTIMS IN PLANE CRASH IDENTIFIED AS AGOURA HILLS FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Agoura Hills couple and their 3-month-old daughter died in a single-engine 
plane crash in northern San Diego County that went undiscovered for four days, 
authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Vander Heide, 40, his wife, Nancy, 38, and their daughter, Willow, died 
Oct. 28 after their Piper Colt crashed in a canyon about a mile north of 
Oceanside Airport, San Diego County Deputy Coroner George Dickason said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a flight plan filed by Vander Heide, he planned to fly his 
two-seat plane from Oceanside Airport to Camarillo Airport in Ventura County, 
about an hour away. Federal Aviation Administration Inspector Larry Lehr said 
Vander Heide's plane crashed and burst into flames shortly after taking off 
about 10:45 p.m. in heavy fog. Camarillo Airport has no control tower. 
</P>
<P>
The crash is being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
There were no witnesses to the crash and the burned wreckage went undiscovered 
until a man hunting rattlesnakes in the canyon found it and told authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Lehr said the family was not missed immediately because they had no close 
relatives in Southern California. The family was identified Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives said Richard Vander Heide was a used-textbook distributor who aspired 
to be a commercial pilot. His father, Ralph, said his son moved to California 
from Michigan about five years ago because he thought he could fly more and 
because he "loved the coast." 
</P>
<P>
The couple was married about eight years. Nancy Vander Heide was a homemaker, 
said Kathryn McDonald, Vander Heide's sister. Willow was their only child. 
</P>
<P>
The couple, badly burned in the accident, was identified by dental records and 
injuries sustained in another plane crash four years ago in Northern 
California. Lehr said the couple required surgery after their Cessna ran out of 
gas over Ukiah and crashed into a redwood tree in January, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County Deputy Coroner Max Murphy said there was no way to positively 
identify the baby through medical or dental records, but that investigators 
were certain the child was the couple's.

BUILDER WINS $3-MILLION JUDGMENT FOR PROJECT COUNTY BACKED OUT OF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Orange County development company has won a $3-million judgment against San 
Diego County over a failed project to build 223 units of low- and 
moderate-income housing in Spring Valley. 
</P>
<P>
A jury made the award Wednesday, after a Superior Court trial over a lawsuit 
filed by G &amp; S Properties Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
II, a limited partnership. 
</P>
<P>
G &amp; S and the county signed a contract in January, 1983, authorizing the 
developer to build the housing project on 11 county-owned acres at the 
intersection of Sweetwater Lane and Jamacha Road. The 55-year lease was 
approved by the Board of Supervisors on a 3-2 vote despite heavy opposition 
from neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
But, in October of the same year, the county withdrew the lease because the 
state, through its Rental Housing Construction Program, had decided not to 
finance the project. 
</P>
<P>
The developer claimed the state's funding was not a condition of the county 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the lawsuit went to court, but a judge ruled that state financing was 
a condition of the lease. But, in 1987, the state Court of Appeal reversed the 
ruling and sent the lawsuit back to Superior Court for another trial. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome of that was Wednesday's $3-million judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Richard (Duke) Pekin Jr., the San Diego attorney representing G &amp; S, said 
in a prepared statement that, "while we are pleased with the verdict, in a case 
like this everyone really loses -- from the taxpayers and the developer to the 
223 families who would have benefited from this project." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy County Counsel Mark Beesley, who handled the case, was not available for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Pekin said he expects the county to file an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The property remains undeveloped.

POWAY TO SUE OVER POMERADO ROAD; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: CITY OFFICIALS ARE FURIOUS AT SAN DIEGO'S RECENT BACKTRACKING 
ON PLANS TO REOPEN THE SHORTCUT. THEY AUTHORIZE LEGAL ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Poway City Council members held a 20-minute closed door session Thursday 
afternoon and emerged to announce they have authorized City Atty. Stephen Eckis 
to sue the city of San Diego to force reopening of Pomerado Road, a popular 
shortcut south to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The action came on the second anniversary of the closure of Pomerado Road by 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego annexed several hundred acres through which Pomerado Road runs and 
announced that the road would be closed for reconstruction to bring it up to 
city safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Poway council went into executive session to authorize legal 
action against San Diego, but emerged to announce that the San Diego City 
Council had voted earlier in the day to reopen the road. 
</P>
<P>
But, on Monday, San Diego council members voted 9 to 0 to keep Pomerado Road 
closed after receiving a new opinion from City Atty. John Witt and Asst. City 
Atty. Curtis Fitzpatrick contradicting earlier advice to the council that such 
an action could not be defended in court. 
</P>
<P>
Poway Councilwoman Linda Brannon called the San Diego council's recent action 
"outrageous" and pointed out that the city of Poway had suffered "impossible 
traffic congestion for two years" because of the closure, which forces all the 
city's southbound traffic onto Poway Road. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Scripps Ranch, an upper-income San Diego suburb on Pomerado Road, 
have fought to have Pomerado closed permanently, or at least until another 
east-west highway is built to link Poway to Interstate 15. 
</P>
<P>
Poway Mayor Don Higginson said Thursday that "it has always been the intention 
of our city that the road be reopened as soon as it was completed, and 
apparently that is not going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Higginson said the suit will be filed next week.

S.D. POLICE FLOUT THEIR OWN POLICY AND SCATTER MIGRANT SQUATTERS WITH A WARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concerned about the possible presence of thieves in an immigrant squatter 
encampment, San Diego police recently requested that a landowner provide 
authorities with a letter authorizing officers to cite the 100 or so residents 
for trespassing on the otherwise-vacant parcel east of Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Police also visited the site and warned squatters of an impending cleanup, and 
issued a similar warning to a nearby nursery that employs some camp dwellers. 
Police told the general manager at Village Nurseries that U.S. immigration 
authorities might shortly be raiding the site, according to a nursery official, 
prompting the nursery to circulate a memo advising workers of "arrests and 
possible deportations." 
</P>
<P>
Although police and the landowner say no actual cleanup was planned -- and a 
police lieutenant now describes the episode as a "major misunderstanding" -- 
the effect of the multiple warnings was to panic many of the 100 or so camp 
residents and send many packing into more isolated nearby canyons, where they 
built new dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
"Why are they chasing us off?" asked Crispin Duran, a 40-year-old father of six 
from Mexico's Guerrero state who was among those who moved his shack down the 
hillside in anticipation of bulldozers and police officers. "We can't afford to 
live anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Officially, San Diego police have a hands-off policy on immigration issues. 
They do not detain anyone solely because of his immigration status, nor do 
officers actively enforce trespassing laws on migrant encampments or move 
squatters out of the sites without first being contacted by landowners or 
obtaining court orders authorizing action. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrant advocates have long pressed local police agencies to adopt such 
hands-off policies on issues involving immigrants. Critics say police lack the 
needed expertise and training and that cooperation with U.S. immigration 
authorities could prompt immigrants to avoid contact with police on other, more 
serious matters. 
</P>
<P>
"Our policy is we don't get involved with immigration matters," said Manuel C. 
Guaderrama, deputy San Diego police chief in charge of all field operations. 
"Our position is we're not going to go around soliciting permission from owners 
to move migrants." 
</P>
<P>
That, however, is exactly what happened recently at the approximately 2-acre 
encampment off Black Mountain Road and Lansdale Drive in the North City West 
community, east of Del Mar, in an area being rapidly developed. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials defended the action, maintaining that it was motivated by 
fears that thieves may be residing in the encampment -- not by the immigration 
status of camp-dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
"That was good, pro-active police work," Lt. Randy L. Nisleit of San Diego 
police Northern Division said of one of his officer's decision to request the 
letter from the landowner, contact the nursery and visit the camp warning 
residents of a cleanup. "We want our officers on the beats to respond 
pro-actively to crime problems, and I'm sure that's what the community wants." 
</P>
<P>
But he conceded that no police cleanup of the site was planned, despite an 
officer's warnings to camp dwellers of such an action. The lieutenant also 
conceded that police had identified no specific suspects residing in the 
encampment. He described the panic induced at the site as a "major 
misunderstanding." 
</P>
<P>
Chief Guaderrama said there was nothing wrong with contacting a landlord when 
potential thieves had been identified among a group of migrants. "It didn't 
have anything to do with immigration; they had a crime problem up there," 
Guaderrama said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Guaderrama also acknowledged that the effect of the trespassing 
warnings would likely have been only to move the residents -- including any 
suspected thieves -- to more isolated spots. "They're going to move to another 
canyon nearby," Guaderrama said. 
</P>
<P>
When suspected criminals are identified as living in a camp, Guaderrama said, 
the standard police response is to question the suspects -- not to issue 
trespassing citations and move all the residents elsewhere. "If 
</P>
<P>
we hear shots are fired, we try to find out who fired the shots," Guaderrama 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The parcel is part of a 9.4-acre undeveloped lot owned by The Children's 
School, a 180-student private elementary and preschool in La Jolla. The 
encampment, one of dozens in northern San Diego County, is unusual in that its 
wood-and-plastic dwellings are visible from the road. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Oct. 26, school officials said, officer Shari Ortega from the San 
Diego police northern division telephoned Peter Christian, the school's 
business manager, and requested that he provide a letter authorizing police to 
cite the squatters for trespassing. Police routinely keep such letters on file, 
although the documents are usually sent after landowners contact authorities 
about a problem, said police Lt. Nisleit. 
</P>
<P>
"Police contacted the school and requested that the school write a letter 
authorizing them to clear the land," said Michael Steres, president of the 
school's board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
School authorities were unaware of the camp's presence until the police call, 
Steres said. The school now plans to provide the letter to authorities, Steres 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems appropriate for us to cooperate with the police," Steres said. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 27, camp dwellers said, two police officers visited the site and warned 
residents of a cleanup that was scheduled in a few days. "Everyone was really 
scared," said Honorino Villa, 26, who drives a catering truck and supplies food 
to the camp.

INSURANCE FRAUD RINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner is to be congratulated for uncovering 
one of the biggest auto insurance scams in the country (Metro, Oct. 18). 
</P>
<P>
Doing more real investigative work than anyone else anywhere, Reiner has 
indicted dozens of people who have been reportedly bilking the insurance 
industry of millions of dollars. I hope these people understand that by 
committing this kind of massive fraud they are stealing from every single 
California driver. 
</P>
<P>
According to the DA's estimates, if the state were rid of this criminal 
element, auto insurance premiums could be reduced at least 50%, making 
insurance affordable without taking away the rights of people with legitimate 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
The California Trial Lawyers Assn. is particularly interested in this issue 
because it has repeatedly supported the toughest anti-fraud legislation 
anywhere in the United States. Unfortunately, these bills have consistently 
been vetoed after passing the state Assembly and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers in this state should not be forced to abdicate their rights so 
criminals can act with impunity and pocket millions, perhaps billions, of 
dollars in fraudulent auto insurance claims. 
</P>
<P>
I hope law enforcement agencies throughout California join in the effort to 
uncover these scams, put these criminals behind bars and stop the endless 
effort to destroy our civil justice system and inalienable right to a jury 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
It's time we put the rights of consumers ahead of the rights of criminals.

INSURANCE FRAUD RINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your story about the auto accident fraud brought a question to mind. Does the 
insurance company that paid out the money for the claims now check all those 
cases and return their insureds to a list of "good drivers"? 
</P>
<P>
Many of these insureds have been placed with assigned-risk companies, forcing 
them to pay higher premiums. If they were not at fault, the insurance company 
should be prohibited from this action. 
</P>
<P>
My own insurance -- liability only on a 9-year-old compact car -- is more than 
$100 per month, due to just such an accident a year ago. I need a new car, but 
I cannot afford the insurance premium for full coverage. I believe the incident 
was a fraudulent one, but I could not convince the insurance company. If it 
really was fraudulent, should I not be reimbursed for the extra premiums I have 
paid? 
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies have become lazy and non-caring because they are so well 
protected by the state.

HOW NOT TO PICK A U.S. SENATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Adaptability, the human species' greatest biological strength, also is the 
source of some of our most pernicious failings, for it too often allows us to 
accommodate what should not be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
A striking case in point is the dominant influence money has come to exert on 
this nation's electoral politics. Whatever we may say we desire of our leaders, 
the system by which we choose them insists that they be not statesmen or 
philosophers or law-givers, but financiers. 
</P>
<P>
Take, for example, the situation with California's two U.S. Senate seats. When 
he takes office, Gov.-elect Pete Wilson will appoint his own successor to the 
Senate. During the campaign, Wilson said he would seek someone "as nearly like 
myself as possible." That is to say, a Republican who is pro-choice, pro-death 
penalty, opposed to offshore drilling and fiscally conservative -- a man or 
woman of the reticent, rather than raving, right. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, however, GOP insiders told The Times that the single most important 
criterion for appointment probably would be the ability to raise $6 million or 
$7 million over the next two years and, perhaps, $20 million over the next four 
years. That is because the appointee will have to run in a confirmation race in 
1992 and again in the 1994 general election. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, California's senior senator, Democrat Alan Cranston, announced 
Thursday that he is ill and will not seek another term. It is sad that 
Cranston's distinguished career should end in the shadow of personal 
misfortune; it is absolutely tragic that it ends in the shadow of disgrace. 
Cranston is one of five senators alleged to have intervened with federal 
regulators on behalf of Charles H. Keating Jr., former head of Lincoln Savings. 
The accused swindler contributed $850,000 to political groups controlled by 
Cranston. As a result, Cranston seemed certain to lose his post as majority 
whip and probably his seat in the next election. 
</P>
<P>
There is an antidote to all this: It is genuine campaign finance reform 
consisting of spending limits, caps on contributions and affordable public 
financing -- the sort of program the city of Los Angeles already has adopted. 
The alternative is simply to adapt.

RESCUERS SUED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Some Hero's Welcome: Rescuer Sued" (Metro, Nov. 2): 
</P>
<P>
The article about the rescuers being sued by the person they rescued is quite 
upsetting but typical of today's sue-happy mentality. 
</P>
<P>
Here we have two men, one a Los Angeles police officer, Loran Dale Turner, and 
one an average citizen, Jim Campbell, who stop, put their lives in jeopardy by 
being on foot on the San Diego Freeway with the danger of being struck by an 
oblivious driver, and by being in a pool of gas gushing from the victims' 
overturned car with the danger of an eminent fiery explosion. 
</P>
<P>
These were two men rising to the challenge who could have just as easily called 
the Fire Department or ignored the situation altogether. And what happens: They 
get sued because one of the persons whom they dragged from the car was struck 
by that oblivious driver while they were dragging out others. 
</P>
<P>
It is unfortunate that the 17-year-old was injured in the second collision, but 
had the officer and good Samaritan not removed her from the car, she would have 
gone up in the fireball of that inevitable crash. And to suggest a flare 
pattern first before rescuing, or a flare pattern at all with all that gas, is 
naive at best. Please keep publicizing names of plaintiffs' attorneys. It makes 
the public aware of who is really behind such despicable suits. 
</P>
<P>
The girl would do better to send a thank you note than a summons.

KRAUTHAMMER ON RAP MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Krauthammer's column is an accurate expose of the messages of Western culture 
and its media of today. I do believe that there is a light at the end of the 
long, dark, undeniable tunnel he describes. That light flickers in each one of 
us in the very undeniableness of the problem. The only way to treat culture's 
pathology is to treat the multiple components of that culture. We are beginning 
to see the enemy and it is us! 
</P>
<P>
Adults of today are feeling the pain and emptiness of our microchip and luxury 
dip, instant gratification society. Expression of grief and making amends for 
grief caused are beginning to emerge from the dark tunnel of "looking good" and 
"having it all." 
</P>
<P>
As more and more of us become willing to look at our own individual parts in 
our culture's pathology, we become able to begin healing that part which is 
ours. As small parts begin healing, larger parts such as relationships begin to 
change, and perhaps heal. Relationships build families that then have to adjust 
to the healing of the fundamental relationship. And then a family learning to 
be caring, expressive and dynamic goes out to work, shop, school and maybe even 
the polls. Caring people who value life, who recognize the value of other's 
lives, can be the route to entertainment selling when it's about dreams of 
happiness and wholeness, love and caring and growth and adventure. 
</P>
<P>
We do have free will, and that will is expressed in what we make our culture. 
We won't change Western society overnight, any more than we got to this 
violent, destructive, object-focused version of it overnight. But amid the 
darkness of this seemingly endless tunnel, I do see some evidence of a route to 
emergence.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE PERSIAN GULF; 
</P>
<P>
GULF WAR ISN'T POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE U.N.; 
</P>
<P>
THE CHARTER PRECLUDES UNILATERAL MILITARY ACTION. THE REALITIES ON THE GROUND 
BEAR THE SAME MESSAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABRAM CHAYES, Abram Chayes is a professor of law at Harvard University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost from the beginning of the Persian Gulf crisis, a chorus of pundits, 
often relying on (not-for-attribution) statements by high U.S. officials, has 
maintained that only military action will achieve America's objectives. And 
last week, for the first time, President Bush and Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III expressly broached the possibility of the use of force against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
An unspoken assumption of this discussion is that the United States, even in 
the absence of another attack by Iraq or authorization by the Security Council, 
is legally free to take military action unilaterally. The argument is that the 
United States was exercising the inherent right of collective self-defense 
guaranteed by Article 51 of the U.N. Charter when it deployed forces in Saudi 
Arabia and the gulf after the attack on Kuwait. It is for the United States to 
decide, therefore, whether the measures taken so far are sufficient and, if 
not, what more is needed. 
</P>
<P>
The United States took the same position in August on the use of naval force in 
the gulf to enforce U.N. sanctions. U.S. naval vessels fired shots across the 
bows of two Iraqi tankers. But in the end the President thought better of it. 
He did not order more action, and the ships continued on course. After a day or 
two, the Security Council authorized member states with naval forces in the 
gulf "to use such measures commensurate to the specific circumstances as may be 
necessary . . . to ensure strict implementation" of sanctions. The interception 
and boarding of vessels heading to or from Iraq was carried out under the 
authority of that resolution. 
</P>
<P>
That seems to be what is required by Article 51 itself. It says that the 
inherent right of self-defense persists only "until the Security Council has 
taken the measures necessary to maintain international peace and security." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, if Iraq attacks, the United States would be free to respond. But 
without further provocation, the critical question is, who is to judge whether 
the actions taken so far by the council are sufficient to maintain 
international peace and security? Article 39 says that the council "shall . . . 
decide what measures shall be taken . . . to maintain or restore international 
peace and security." Even more telling, Article 42, which empowers the Security 
Council to order the use of force, begins: "Should the Security Council 
consider that measures provided for in Article 41 (that is, diplomatic and 
economic sanctions) would be inadequate or have proved to be inadequate . . ." 
then it may order military action. 
</P>
<P>
In the larger scheme of the charter, it is the Security Council that has 
"primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and 
security." To carry out that responsibility, the council must have the 
authority to make the political judgments and to take the measures necessary to 
deal with the situation. This conception of the Security Council's role 
reinforces the fundamental aim of the charter to limit unilateral use of force 
to the narrowest possible range. 
</P>
<P>
During the Cold War, when the Security Council was immobilized by reciprocal 
vetoes, states exercising the right of self-defense could not be expected to 
forgo continuing action simply because the council was debating the situation, 
with no likelihood of a serious substantive outcome. Today, however, the 
President himself has acknowledged that the Security Council is working "as it 
was supposed to work." The council addressed the situation promptly, adopted 
measures with real impact, including comprehensive and binding economic 
sanctions, and strengthened those measures as the need became apparent. 
</P>
<P>
If the United Nations is working as intended, judgments about the ultimate 
objectives of its action, the adequacy of measures to be taken, the amount of 
time needed to give sanctions a chance to work and the like should be answered 
by the council. The United States has a very important voice in the process of 
reaching those decisions. To date, the President and U.N. Ambassador Thomas 
Pickering have exercised impressive leadership in the council's deliberations. 
But if they cannot induce the others to agree that the use of force is 
necessary, the clear meaning of the charter is that unilateral action is 
precluded. 
</P>
<P>
"Realists" often dismiss this kind of analysis as "legalistic" -- an effort to 
impose abstract legal constraints on practical and decisive action. And lawyers 
who advise presidents are understandably reluctant to reduce options or 
otherwise tell him that he can't do what he wants to do. In the gulf, however, 
as is so often the case, the international legal analysis highlights the 
practical realities of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Visions of surgical strikes and costless decapitating attacks may dance in the 
heads of armchair strategists and Pentagon planners, but in real life they 
almost never come off. A large-scale attack on Iraq, even if "successful," 
would run high risks of significant casualties, including many noncombatants in 
Iraq and elsewhere, the destruction of major oil installations, which would 
send oil prices skyrocketing; severely negative long-term affects on the U.S. 
position with the Arab states and escalation to a general Middle Eastern war. 
</P>
<P>
As a practical matter, it is no longer possible for the United States to use 
force in the gulf without the concurrence of the others engaged there. They, 
too, will be exposed to the military, political and economic consequences of 
any U.S. military action. Indeed, the first consequence of such action would be 
to shatter the international consensus that has so far given legitimacy and 
strength to the enterprise. Among the first defections could well be the Arab 
states that requested the U.S. presence in the first place, and without whose 
continuing support the enterprise could not be sustained. Secretary Baker's 
current round of consultations in the Middle East and Moscow recognize these 
legal and practical realities. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. actions in the gulf will have far-reaching implications for the new world 
order President Bush is trying to build. In a sense, we are beneficiaries of a 
second chance, something that doesn't often happen in the inexorable world of 
international politics. It is almost as if the Security Council had been in 
suspended animation since 1945, and is now stirring to life new and untouched. 
</P>
<P>
The most important long-term impact of the crisis may well be on this new and 
still fragile growth. If the Security Council is to be preserved and 
strengthened for the role it was designed to play, it cannot be used simply as 
a forum for consultation, even less so to provide legal cover for unilaterally 
mandated ends. As the organ of the international community with primary 
responsibility in situations threatening international peace and security, it 
must have the powers to decide when force is to be used. That means that the 
United States must abide by the council's decisions even when we don't agree 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
In a world where power is increasingly diffused and mobilization of power on 
the basis of ideology is increasingly unavailable, the requirements of 
international law and practical international politics on this issue are one 
and the same.

<P>
It is becoming harder to end a visit to the Soviet Union in an optimistic mood. 
As shortages increase and the risk of hyper-inflation grows, the Soviet Union 
can no longer afford to move slowly to economic reform. Popular discontent is 
growing and if there should be not just shortages but hunger, it is by no means 
to be ruled out that a strangely variegated anti-reformist coalition could be 
put together that might command considerable public support. 
</P>
<P>
If shock therapy is going to be needed for the Soviet economy -- and the more 
serious Soviet economists increasingly think it is -- then as broad as possible 
a "center-left coalition" (the "left" in current Soviet terminology meaning the 
most enthusiastic marketeers) needs to be put together as a matter of urgency. 
When Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin set their principal economic 
advisers to work on a common program, it looked as if this might have been 
achieved. But Gorbachev's desire to keep Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and 
key ministers within that coalition turned out to be the rock on which the plan 
foundered. 
</P>
<P>
However good were Gorbachev's reasons for this tactical retreat -- and he has 
over the past 5 1/2 years been a master of political timing -- Yeltsin felt 
deceived as, indeed, did some of Gorbachev's more radical supporters. Yeltsin 
reacted brusquely by categorizing Gorbachev's revised economic guidelines as 
"catastrophic" and a Gorbachev-Yeltsin alliance began to recede into the Moscow 
mists. 
</P>
<P>
Yet what neither Gorbachev nor Yeltsin fully realize is how much they need each 
other, whatever difficulties flow from their contrasting personalities and 
conflicting ambitions. If they remain rivals rather than allies, then on top of 
all his other problems a major political crisis faces Gorbachev in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The draft of a new constitution for the Russian Republic, which has not yet 
been approved by the republic's Supreme Soviet nor officially published, but 
which I read here last week, renames the chairmanship of the Supreme Soviet of 
the Russian Republic the "President of the Russian Federation" and describes 
him as "head of state." It also stipulates that this person be elected by the 
citizens of Russia for a period of four years. 
</P>
<P>
The potential significance of this can hardly be overstated. What it means is 
that in March or April of next year, Boris Yeltsin has every chance of being 
the first popularly elected leader of Russia in the whole of Russian history. 
Gorbachev will still be leader of the Soviet Union, but one who was indirectly 
elected in March, 1990, by a legislature that was chosen a year earlier, before 
the radicalization of the Soviet political process had gone so far. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of Gorbachev's justifiably high international standing, his domestic 
authority vis-a-vis a popularly elected Yeltsin will be weaker than ever next 
year. He will come under strong pressure to move up the next election for the 
president of the Soviet Union and run against whatever competition may be 
forthcoming. If, in those circumstances, he refused to hold an election, his 
decrees would be less and less likely to be obeyed. If he did hold it, he would 
-- as things stand now -- be very hard put to defeat Yeltsin, should he decide 
to stand for the presidency of the entire country. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Gorbachev's and Yeltsin's informal advisers are now trying to impress 
on both men how much they need each other. But while Gorbachev badly needs a 
cooperative rather than competitive relationship with Yeltsin, why should 
Yeltsin be prepared to compromise with Gorbachev when he has everything to play 
for? 
</P>
<P>
Judging by some of his words and actions, Yeltsin himself may be inclined to 
see things that way. However, his popularity owes almost everything to being 
perceived as the anti-Establishment candidate, untainted by policy failures and 
a declining standard of living. Yeltsin in power could, however, achieve a 
stabilization of the currency and begin to make the necessary changes in the 
Soviet economic system only at the expense of initially greater hardship than 
exists at present. He would, moreover, if he lost the support of the Gorbachev 
group, have to attempt to govern with an inexperienced team of administrators. 
He would begin to learn what Gorbachev has been up against. The eventual 
outcome would be rather more likely to be an authoritarian counterrevolution 
than the continuing evolution of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
For those who wish to see both the further democratization of the Soviet 
political system and the marketization of its economy, in the face of mounting 
difficulties a formal or informal alliance between Gorbachev and Yeltsin is now 
more essential than ever. But do they yet fully realize that they must hang 
together or (figuratively, one hopes) hang separately?

THIEVES ROB MAN OF $100,000 IN GEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three men broke into an apartment in Paradise Hills on Thursday afternoon, 
taped the hands and feet of the man living there and robbed him of more than 
$100,000 in assorted gems and precious stones, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, who lives in the 3000 block of Alta View Drive, was surprised by 
three men about 2 p.m., Sgt. Fred England of the San Diego Police Department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The men knocked on the door, pushed their way in, held a knife to the victim's 
throat and taped his hands and feet before demanding his automatic teller card, 
England said. They demanded the code, "which was wrong, or he gave them the 
wrong number," after which they ransacked the apartment, England added. 
</P>
<P>
The thieves stole a .22-caliber pistol, a .22-caliber rifle and a footlocker 
containing more than $100,000 worth of jewels, England said. They taped the 
victim's eyes and mouth before leaving the apartment.

<P>
Fires damaged homes in Tierrasanta, Encanto and Vista Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana winds fanned a fire in a Tierrasanta canyon, causing more than 
$100,000 in damage, San Diego fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, still under investigation, began shortly before 2:30 p.m. Wednesday 
in canyon brush but quickly spread to the wood-shake roofs of 15 homes on Via 
Cascabel, Rueda Court, Valiente Court and Cascajo Court near Tierrasanta 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
A home in the 10800 block of Via Cascabel suffered the worst damage -- $70,000 
worth, fire officials said. About 75 firefighters with six fire engines, eight 
brush rigs, a water tanker and other equipment brought the two-alarm fire under 
control about 4 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Food cooking on an unattended stove sparked a fire that swept through a 
single-family home in Encanto on Thursday. The fire, which began shortly before 
noon, caused $205,000 damage to the home and its contents in the 800 block of 
Marjorie Drive, fire officials said. Alerted by a smoke detector, a 30-year-old 
mother escaped unharmed with her four children. 
</P>
<P>
The Vista home of a woman in her 80s was destroyed by a fire that swept through 
the home Thursday shortly before noon. The cause of the fire, near Monte Vista 
Drive and South Santa Fe Avenue, is under investigation. The woman was not at 
home at the time of the fire.

with last year's $85.8-million loss, which reflected a $127-million writeoff. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue rose to $476.5 million from $470.1 million. The company cited a 5% gain 
in publishing revenue, which helped offset a 15% drop in its insurance unit,

DOW INCHES UP 2.97, ENDING TWO-DAY SLIDE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After a jittery day of Mideast war rumors and worries over a huge Treasury bond 
auction, stocks eked out small gains Thursday, ending a two-day losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials edged up 2.97 to 2,443.81 after falling 
44.31 points Wednesday. In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered 
declines in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 
834 up, 654 down and 510 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume came to 155.57 million shares, up from 149.13 million 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Continued hopes for a new wave of interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve 
lured some buyers, as did a decent reception for the 30-year Treasury bond 
auction -- which underscored the hopes for lower rates. A late rally in the 
rumor-roiled oil market failed to rout stock traders. 
</P>
<P>
But concern over the economy and the Mideast crisis continued to weigh on the 
market, while the repeated delay of a news conference by President Bush further 
ate into confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"There were concerns about and rumors of a war in the Mideast," said Kenneth 
Spence, technical analyst at Salomon Bros. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the close, defense officials denied a rumor that a U.S. plane 
had been shot down in the Persian Gulf region. However, Bush, who finally spoke 
to reporters after the close of trading, said more troops would be sent to the 
Middle East to ensure the nation's offensive capability. 
</P>
<P>
Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* NCR jumped 5 7/8 to 53 7/8 on speculation that it and AT&amp;T may be 
exploring the possibility of merging their computer businesses. AT&amp;T fell 
1/2 to 33 1/8, but other tech stocks were buoyed, including IBM, up 1 to 107 
1/2, and Compaq, up 1 3/8 to 47 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
* SmithKline Beecham tumbled 4 1/2 to 53 3/8 after it reported third-quarter 
results. Analysts said investors were disappointed with the 4% growth in sales. 
Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. removed its recommendation from the stock. 
</P>
<P>
* Two waste-disposal companies that fell sharply during the past two days 
rebounded. Browning-Ferris rose 5/8 to 22 3/8 and Waste Management gained 3/4 
to 32 1/4. The stocks had been hammered on a weak Browning earnings report. 
</P>
<P>
* Shearson Lehman downgraded ratings and cut estimates on Alcoa and Reynolds 
Metals. Alcoa dropped 1 1/4 to 50 1/2 and Reynolds fell 2 1/4 to 49. 
</P>
<P>
* Cisco Systems rose 3 7/8 to 33 7/8 after the computer networking firm 
reported better-than-expected earnings. 
</P>
<P>
* Among Southland stocks, good earnings reports lifted Vons supermarkets 1/4 to 
18 1/4 and Jacobs Engineering 1/4 to 21. But computer maker Teradata slumped 
3/4 to 7 1/4 after announcing new cutbacks to deal with falling orders. 
Elsewhere, Telecredit gained 1 1/2 to 36 1/2 on word that it is renegotiating 
merger terms with Equifax. Western Digital lost 5/8 to 4 5/8, but there was no 
news. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo stocks were knocked down in volatile trading on expectations of war in 
the Mideast after bellicose comments by British Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher. The key 225-share Nikkei index closed down 530.44, or 2.3%, to 
22,969.81. The decline continued today, as the Nikkei fell another 346.23 by 
midday. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices closed lower on London's Stock Exchange, as investors found little 
inspiration from Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major's autumn statement on 
public spending. The Financial Times 100-share index closed down 23 points, or 
1.1%, at 2,036.2. 
</P>
<P>
German share prices recovered to close only slightly below the previous close, 
after dropping sharply in early trading. The DAX index rose 1.71 points to 
1,369.44. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT: Auction a Success, but Bond Prices Dip 
</P>
<P>
Government bond prices slipped slightly despite a successful conclusion to the 
Treasury's quarterly refunding auction. Observers blamed the slump on President 
Bush's harsher words about the Persian Gulf stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
The price of the government's bellwether 30-year bond fell 3/16 point, or about 
$1.88 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield advanced to 8.7% from 8.69% late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The $10.75 billion in new 30-year bonds sold yielded an average 8.71%, down 
from 8.87% at the last auction Aug. 9. James Marshall, a bond trader with 
Clayton Brown &amp; Associates, said the yield was "pretty much as advertised," 
indicating demand for the bonds was adequate. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, the government sold 10-year notes at an average yield of 8.52%. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 7.625%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY: Dollar Up Sharply Against Yen, Mark 
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended sharply higher against most other major currencies as worries 
about war in the Persian Gulf shook the market. 
</P>
<P>
"Rumors were flying around about conflict in the Gulf. The unrest does nothing 
but help support the dollar," said Jack Griffin, a dealer at Banque Indosuez. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar finished at 130.35 Japanese yen, against Wednesday's 
128.73. The dollar rose to 1.493 German marks, up from 1.487. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese yen suffers most from concerns about war, Griffin said, because 
Japan is seen as being most vulnerable to a cutoff of oil. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES: Growth in Soybean Crop Shocks Traders 
</P>
<P>
Analysts predicted a sharp drop in soybean futures prices after the government 
shocked the experts Thursday with an unprecedented 4.4% increase in its 1990 
U.S. soybean crop estimate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a killer," said analyst Doug Jackson of Farmers Commodities Corp. in Des 
Moines, Iowa. He said soybean prices probably would open 10 cents a bushel 
lower Friday in reaction to the report. The November contract closed at $5.83 a 
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
The new soybean estimate represented the largest October-to-November increase 
ever in the USDA's harvest projections. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, light sweet crude oil settled 
50 cents to $1.28 higher in a late rally sparked by rumors of imminent U.S. 
action in the Gulf. The December contract gained 22 cents to $35.53 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze joined a growing number 
of world leaders in proclaiming military force may be necessary to oust Iraq 
from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold futures settled 70 cents to $1 higher, 
with November at $387.30 an ounce; silver was 0.9 cent to 1 cent lower, with 
December at $4.27 an ounce.

CMS Enhancements Inc., the computer products manufacturer and distributor, said 
its first-quarter earnings plunged 98% to $17,000, from $857,000 in the 
year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 fell 23% to $33.2 million, from 
$42.9 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The company attributed the lower financial performance to intense competition, 
high inventory costs at its Singapore plant and the costs of moving its 
headquarters from Tustin to Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The expenses at the Singapore plant are related to continuing inventory 
problems at the plant, said Bill Lackey, a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
For its fiscal year ended June 30, CMS earned $407,000 on revenue of $187.7 
million, contrasted with earnings of $4.8 million on revenue of $200.4 million 
a year earlier.

EIP Microwave Inc.: The Newport Beach manufacturer of test and measurement 
instruments said net income for its fiscal year ended Sept. 30 dropped to 
$127,000 from $771,000 for the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
The year-earlier results included a pretax charge to operations from the 
write-down of assets as well as a gain of $748,000 from an accounting change. 
Sales declined 18% to $11.3 million from $13.8 million. In the fourth quarter, 
EIP lost $107,000, contrasted with net income of $293,000 in the year-earlier 
period. Fourth-quarter sales decreased 39% to $2.2 million from $3.6 million. 
The company attributed the drop primarily to a significant decline in 
defense-related business.

<P>
You've seen them in magazine ads. He reclines on a black leather couch, dressed 
in a striped shirt. She perches by his side, leaning over him in an oversize 
sweater and comfy sweat pants. His right hand caresses her trim upper thigh. A 
wash of natural light illuminates his gleaming white teeth. 
</P>
<P>
There's an obsession here -- but it isn't Calvin Klein's. It is Sam Edelman's 
for Libby Edelman, and Libby's for Sam. The husband-and-wife business team has 
created a sexy corporate image that, hard as it may be for cynics to believe, 
seems to reflect reality. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being the "perfect" couple, they are the founders and owners of Sam 
&amp; Libby, a $51-million footwear business just 3 years old. Their faces are 
plastered across double-page ads in fashion magazines promoting their product, 
though nary a shoe is pictured. This has some people wondering: Who is that 
couple? 
</P>
<P>
Ask the women and children of America who wear 3 million pairs of bow-adorned 
ballet flats, a mainstay of the collections. Those customers know Sam &amp; 
Libby as a label that provides comfortable, under-$50 styles in stores such as 
Robinson's nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
(The girls' shoes sell for $20 to $34 at children's specialty stores such as 
Bernans in South Coast Plaza. Designs for little boys are scheduled to debut in 
a few months.) 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many designers who raise prices as the cachet of their label catches on, 
the Edelmans have lowered theirs. Men's styles, launched in August, were priced 
$50 to $70 but now sell for less than $50. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all about affordable fashion; people don't want to spend a week's salary 
for the clothing on their backs or the shoes on their feet," says Sam, 38, the 
financial strongman of the company. His impish grin and expressive brows are 
quick to charm, but business colleagues soon find out he watches the bottom 
line. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to keep prices down keeps loyalty high. About 75 letters per week 
arrive in the company's Bay Area offices. Many compliment the comfortable fit 
and low prices of the shoes. Libby maintains she answers every letter 
personally, a task she completes in flight on business trips. 
</P>
<P>
Libby, 37, is a striking blonde with a natural, winning smile and an easy 
laugh. As head of the company's six-person design team, with offices in Italy 
and France, she is constantly on the lookout for inspiration. The weathered 
pink structures of a seawall in Panama influenced her spring color palette. 
Closer to home, the contrasting trim on historic San Francisco buildings 
prompted her to add piping to a few designs. 
</P>
<P>
Sam handles 15-hour days -- overseeing corporate business and maintaining 
contact with production offices in Brazil -- so Libby can spend more time with 
their children. On a recent morning, Libby was up at 6 a.m. to jog. Later, she 
quizzed Jesse, 7, for a spelling test. Daughter Callie, 4, and Max, 1, watched 
as she dried her hair, dressed, climbed into her car and headed to the office 
before taking off on a business trip to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
The designer's life isn't all fashion-show glamour and business dinners. She 
gets down on her knees to fit customers with Sam &amp; Libby shoes, the only 
kind she wears -- except for a pair of equestrian riding boots. (An impromptu 
inspection of her semi-organized closet verified the claim, and revealed a soft 
spot for Donna Karan belts.) Although the children stay behind during business 
trips, they help entertain VIP customers invited to the family home. 
</P>
<P>
Home is a sprawling four-bedroom farmhouse built in 1920. Next to the main 
house is a guest house and a separate garage, all situated in a wooded setting 
surrounded by green, rolling hills. Horses bred for jumping (an Edelman 
pastime) meander about the property, which also includes a swimming pool 
circled by lounge chairs. Inside, tasteful French-country furnishings are 
surrounded by dozens of kitschy equestrian paintings. 
</P>
<P>
The couple met 11 years ago in New York when Libby, then an editor for 
Seventeen magazine, called on Sam at his father's now-defunct shoe company to 
borrow footwear for a photo shoot. The attraction was immediate, but it took 
about eight weeks for a serious relationship to develop. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God for the shoe market," Libby says, recalling the occasion that 
brought the two together again after their first meeting, "when it really 
became love." 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, after the couple were married, Libby headed Calvin Klein's 
public-relations department while Sam worked for Kenneth Cole and El Greco, 
among other shoe companies. They headed West when San Francisco-based Esprit 
offered both Sam and Libby a job in its shoe division. Sam served as president, 
Libby as merchandising manager. The Edelmans left in July, 1987, to start their 
own business. 
</P>
<P>
Transforming the dream into a reality was no easy project. Though Sam had spent 
years in the industry, he was unsuccessful in obtaining outside backing. 
</P>
<P>
"I sent out business plans, got short haircuts -- but nothing," he recalls, now 
able to laugh about it. 
</P>
<P>
To make Sam &amp; Libby happen, the Edelmans took out a second mortgage on 
their home. They sold some property behind their house, "right up to the 
doorstep." They unloaded their cars and drove rentals. They borrowed money from 
relatives. Sam even drove Libby to what he calls "a very different 
neighborhood" and showed her a small two-bedroom apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her if we lose the house this is where we'll be living," he recalls. 
"And Libby says to me, 'it's great, comfy -- we could have a lot of fun here.' 
It was then I realized we really could be happy anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
The risk paid off. The Edelmans did $3 million their first year, $25 million 
their second year and $51 million their third. Today, Sam admits he heartily 
relishes turning down the investors who once thumbed their noses at his 
fledging venture. 
</P>
<P>
Not every married couple can work together successfully. The Edelmans' stint at 
Esprit, then headed by Doug and Susie Tompkins, offered a glimpse of what 
doesn't work. (Susie Tompkins bought out her estranged husband and now runs the 
U.S. company solo.) 
</P>
<P>
"We know the classic mistakes that husband-and-wife teams make and we try to 
avoid them," Sam says. "Many times, if the wife is the designer and you have a 
bad season, you can't blame everything on her. Instead of blaming each other, 
we say, 'let's do better next time.' " 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, their holiday offering looks like a hit. Black velvet and metallic 
leather shoes are the leading styles. There are traditional ballet flats as 
well as sexy, T-strap heels. And gold and silver matte metallics are catching 
on as neutral choices for daytime. 
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, the Edelmans plan to launch next March a casual sportswear 
collection, a venture they believe will be even more successful than their shoe 
empire. The line, with jeans priced under $40 and tops tagged from $19 to $29, 
will be ideal for travel, Libby says. "We're thinking of giving away a little 
suitcase with a whole outfit" as a promotion, she says. 
</P>
<P>
The Edelmans' enthusiasm is both catching and telling. That confidence, they 
say, is a direct result of constant communication at home and work. Although 
they don't always agree, each knows the other's strengths and weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had my choice, I could spend a Saturday afternoon organizing all our 
books by category, height and color," Sam says, completely serious. "Libby, if 
she could, would sit around the pool eating Hostess Twinkies." 
</P>
<P>
She agrees.

It's Official: Jane Fonda and Ted Turner will wed, probably sometime in 1991, 
according to a representative of the actress. The couple shopped at Tiffany in 
Beverly Hills Tuesday and picked out a ring with an opal stone (her favorite) 
flanked by two diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
Turner will give Fonda the ring on her birthday, Dec. 21. The couple will 
probably keep the ceremony small with just family and friends, and set the date 
sometime after her son, Troy Hayden, graduates from high school next June. No 
location for the wedding has been named. The two, who have been an item for 
about a year, will probably maintain their commuter relationship after the 
wedding; he has property in Montana and Georgia, she has property in Los 
Angeles. This will be the third marriage for both; Fonda was married to French 
film director Roger Vadim and politician Tom Hayden; Turner's former wives were 
Judy Nye and Jane Shirley Smith.

Run, Don't Drive: Wanda Panfil said in Warsaw she likes running so much she 
doesn't have a driver's license and will not get behind the wheel of the 
Mercedes Benz she won in the New York City Marathon. Panfil, 31, said Wednesday 
that she will "subordinate everything" to winning the world championship in 
Tokyo next year. She won the New York race Sunday.

Run for Cover: There has been such a run on formal morning suits ahead of 
Emperor Akihito's enthronement that Japan's protocol chiefs have had to strike 
extra-tall and extra-short employees off their VIP-welcoming roster. So many 
people have bought the long-tailed "penguin suits" for next week's festivities 
that a Tokyo department store is completely out of non-standard sizes. Which 
means officials are giving priority to "standard-size" people. Compiled by YEMI

The New York Times' editor Max Frankel should be forced to wear a muzzle for 
his own safety. How can he possibly edit others when his own mouth is a 
disaster area? If it is indeed true that his women and black employees are 
given the "nod," and "put on the fast track," he shouldn't rub the white males' 
noses in it.

DON'T PASS CHILDHOOD; GO STRAIGHT TO ADULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Well, since I read it in The Times it must be official -- we have now decided 
to do away with childhood altogether (at least for the rich). I see in the 
"Haute Tots" feature (Oct. 19) that children as young as 3 or 4 are being 
dressed in $300-and-up designer evening wear so they can look just like their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
We are told that this is now a requirement for being "socially correct." 
</P>
<P>
I guess the old-fashioned idea that childhood was a time for exploring, 
imagining, playing, laughing and enjoying a few brief years of freedom before 
taking on the burdens of adult responsibility is now just for us unfashionably 
poor and socially incorrect people. If you've got enough money, you can 
completely skip all the mess and inconvenience of having kids and simply turn 
them into miniature adults. 
</P>
<P>
As for me, I guess I'll just have to struggle along with my old-model children. 
Well, at least here in backward San Bernardino, I won't have to worry about 
running into those women who turn up their noses at kids who don't have "the 
look." Ah, what a world, what a world.

MAX THE MOUTH FROM THE N.Y. TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
N.Y. Times Executive Editor Max Frankel's bloopers on affirmative action were 
truly amazing. Frankel makes ex-Interior Secretary James Watt sound in 
retrospect like a polished diplomat ("Editor Is Back in Hot Water," Oct. 24). 
</P>
<P>
If the president of General Motors or IBM had made statements like Frankel's, 
it's a safe bet that the media would have mounted a crusade against such 
hopeless insensitivity. In the vanguard would be the New York Times, which 
could be counted on to weigh in with at least three scornful editorials (op-ed 
pieces excluded). 
</P>
<P>
However, when Frankel ricochets from one affirmative action gaffe to the next, 
we hear mostly silence. Professional courtesy, no doubt. The Los Angeles Times 
is to be commended for running the story.

PLANAS WEARS ART ON HIS SLEEVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAILE ROBINSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jon Planas is a painter. His works on canvas are owned by Ivana Trump and Cher. 
His other patrons, from the ranks of the bold-faced names in the gossip columns 
-- Allan Carr, Robin Williams, Sandra Bernhard, Bob Geldof and Deborah Harry -- 
wear their Planas originals on their backs. 
</P>
<P>
That's because Planas paints jackets -- tuxedo jackets, bombers, whatever style 
his clients favor. 
</P>
<P>
(Madonna chose a bolero style with embroidered lapels and painted with roses 
spilling from an Art Deco vase on the back.) 
</P>
<P>
Planas launched his career on the rocks in Waikiki. Surfers saw his painted 
stones and brought their surfboards to him. The jackets were the result of a 
public humiliation. 
</P>
<P>
Once, when he was attending a formal affair, he was mistaken for a waiter. He 
immediately painted his white dinner jacket -- and began taking orders for 
apparel instead of drinks. Carr wanted one so desperately that he had his own 
jacket flown to Hawaii from Los Angeles by private jet so Planas could 
embellish it. 
</P>
<P>
Planas uses acrylics and oil-based metallics, and embeds mirrors on the lapels 
and sleeves to create the pop images of Marilyn Monroe, peace signs and symbols 
of New Age mysticism, such as his signature sphinx. 
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian Planas is a hot number, one of those artists-as-celebrity that are 
a hybrid of the Manhattan art scene. He is a shameless self-promoter in the 
style of Andy Warhol, traveling the art circuit with gallery shows in 
Manhattan, Scottsdale and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He has been included in the newest Absolut Vodka advertising campaign, "Artists 
of the '90s," also including Andre Mirapolsky in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Planas recently moved his studio from Manhattan to Scottsdale. "Living in the 
desert has slowed me down to a deeper level," he says. It's also added 
furnishings to his list of painted pieces. 
</P>
<P>
His jackets ($400 to $2,000), chairs, cabinets and altarpieces ($800 to 
$8,000), which he calls "his quest for instinctual conceptualism," are 
available in Los Angeles through art dealer Edward H. Davis. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Planas can be seen at the nightclub Arena with his performance art 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, Planas, never one to miss an opportunity, will have his jackets and 
a new line of T-shirts with him.

COSTNER'S MAGIC WITH 'WOLVES'; 
</P>
<P>
IN HIS DIRECTORIAL DEBUT, HE CREATES A FRONTIER EPIC RICH IN CHARACTER, ACTION 
AND SPECTACLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kevin Costner opens his stirringly fine "Dances With Wolves" (selected 
theaters) by pitching us without prologue or apology into the thick of 
character and action. 
</P>
<P>
Costner's Lt. John Dunbar, a wounded Union officer, is next in line to have his 
foot sawed off at a Tennessee field hospital; preferring to die intact rather 
than mutilated, he steals back to his men. Nearly hallucinating, he chooses 
death by galloping between the stalemated Union and Confederate troops, drawing 
rebel fire and ending his pain. 
</P>
<P>
During his final, full-tilt charge, muttering, "Father, forgive me," Dunbar 
drops his reins and throws his arms up and out, looking like a circus rider or 
a Christ figure, or both. It's a marvelous moment of cinema, but a dangerously 
risky one when the star is also the director, and a first-time director at 
that. It practically invites the professionally cool in the audience to drawl, 
"Well, who does he think he is?" 
</P>
<P>
Yet played off against Dunbar's incredulous entry in his journal, "In trying to 
produce my own death, I became a living hero," the moment carries exactly the 
aura of half-mad heroism it's supposed to. Quite clearly, Costner knows exactly 
who he is, what he is doing, and how to do it. 
</P>
<P>
He may have studied the way Akira Kurosawa splits his screen with a horizon 
line or sets a character a little off-center in the vastness of a plain; there 
are movements of cottonwoods and buffalo grass that may recall "Dersu Uzala," 
and figures against a flaming sunset that bring back "Kagemusha," but there are 
far worse directors to study if one is starting out. 
</P>
<P>
"Dances With Wolves" is a clear-eyed vision. Authentic as an Edward Curtis 
photograph, lyrical as a George Catlin oil or a Karl Bodmer landscape, this is 
a film with a pure ring to it. It's impossible to call it anything but epic, 
not with scenes like the ground-shaking buffalo hunt, photographed with the 
camera moving at the same breakneck speed as the buffalo, while Dunbar and the 
young Sioux maneuver among them. The work of the buffalo-hunt camera crew is 
extraordinary, supplementing Dean Semler's painterly cinematography overall. 
</P>
<P>
Yet somehow, because the film's screenplay, by Michael Blake, concerns itself 
with character, not spectacle, its epic quality is engaging, frequently 
punctuated with gutsy humor, never self-congratulatory. Considering the scope 
and the ambitiousness of the material, the success of Costner and every one of 
his team seems monumental. (The film is rated PG-13 for its violence and brief, 
discreet nudity.) 
</P>
<P>
With his act of suicide seen as reckless bravery, Dunbar, not dead and not 
footless, is rewarded with any post he wishes. He asks simply for the frontier 
and is dumped at South Dakota's Ft. Sedgewick with a wagonload of supplies. The 
eerily deserted fort is two crumbling sod huts and a broken-down corral on a 
treeless plain. There's nothing around for miles, nothing but duty to keep 
Dunbar there and only his smart horse, Cisco, and a canny wolf for company. And 
though he doesn't know it, two deaths have obliterated any official knowledge 
of his existence out there. 
</P>
<P>
It's clear from Dunbar's first night that man and country suit each other. The 
screenplay may not spell out precisely why, but Costner is good at suggesting a 
deep, settling-in quality to the reckless Dunbar, jumpy but unafraid out here 
under an orange Dakota moon. 
</P>
<P>
A poker-faced stickler for regulations, Dunbar assigns himself clean-up duty, 
carries on dry conversations with Cisco, names and tames his wolf, Two Socks, 
records his impressions in his journal. And slowly, we come to the essence of 
this thoughtful, complex man, his character leavened by just enough goofiness 
to balance his undeniably heroic streak. After seeing these facets in earlier 
Costner films, solidity without dullness, uninsistent manliness, a measured 
watchfulness, one might suspect that the Dunbar/Costner fit, as tailored to him 
by his friend and screenwriter Blake, is pretty close. If so, Costner's moments 
undercutting his own image are especially charming. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in a hilarious cross-cultural encounter, the solitary lieutenant is 
discovered by his Sioux neighbors. Following this confrontation, the filmmakers 
have made absolute magic; curiousity replaces unease, each side tests the other 
gravely and is not disillusioned. Dunbar, fascinated, begins to learn something 
about the character of the Sioux people, tactfully teaching us at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
As the Sioux come alive, a handful stand out: Kicking Bird (Graham Greene), the 
tribe's holy man, his hair like a falcon's top-knot; the hotly combative Wind 
in His Hair (Rodney A. Grant); tribal leader Ten Bears (singer Floyd Red Crow 
Westerman), masterly at imposing his knowledge without appearing to, and young 
Smiles a Lot (Nathan Lee Chasing His Horse), witness to the best and worst in 
the white strangers. They are a collection of exceptional talents. 
</P>
<P>
In a bow to Western movie tradition, there's also the luminous-eyed Stands With 
a Fist (Mary McDonnell), the white-child-raised-by-the-tribe, who moves from 
mourning widow to reluctant translator to the woman Dunbar loves. Since these 
people so clearly possess the values and qualities Dunbar has instinctively 
been drawn to -- only heightened and refined -- the dawning knowledge of where 
he truly belongs emerges. 
</P>
<P>
One might remark on the even disposition of every soul in this huge encampment. 
The natural dangers of their lives aside, these people really have a good day, 
every day. It's the Pawnee who are the movie's "bad Indians." In the same 
crabby vein, one might question why there's no other Army man who shares 
Dunbar's humanity, or even curiosity. But as a student of the period remarked, 
the West wasn't settled by humanitarians. 
</P>
<P>
Dunbar is given his name Dances With Wolves after a singularly unbuttoned 
moment, not unlike the one in "Lawrence of Arabia" as Lawrence runs preeningly 
in his floating white robes, only to find to his mortification that he's being 
watched by an Arab stranger. More important is Dunbar's ecstatic private dance 
at his own campfire -- done with the sort of rapture Lawrence would understand 
-- marking just how far this authentic hero has moved from the stoic Western 
tradition. It is exactly in the path Kicking Bird has described: the trail of a 
true human being.

Video Royalty: Prince Charles plays an environmentally friendly heir to the 
British throne in his comic video debut with John Cleese. 
</P>
<P>
The royal thespian has a key role in "Grime Goes Green: Your Business and the 
Environment." The 30-minute video premiered Thursday at a meeting sponsored by 
Business in the Environment, which published an environmental guidebook for 
industry. Cleese plays James Grime, a decidedly un-green industrialist who is 
shown frantically cleaning his plant ahead of a royal visit. The prince tells 
him that "if everybody's going to wait for a royal visit before they clean up 
their act, we'll never get anywhere. . . ." CLAUDIA PUIG

'SAINTS' OFF TO SIZZLING START

Though "Rhythm of the Saints," Paul Simon's follow-up to his smash hit 
"Graceland" album, was expected to be a solid long-term seller, its sizzling 
start is somewhat of a surprise. "Rhythm" rocketed to No. 5 on Billboard's pop 
album chart in just three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
ZZ Top's "Recycler" is red-hot too, shooting up to No. 6 in just three weeks. 
Since Bette Midler turned to crooning sentimental, uplifting songs, she has 
become a major force in the record market. Her "Some People's Lives" moved up 
to No. 12. Debuts: The Cure's "Mixed up"(No. 33) and Traveling Wilburys' "Vol. 
3" (No. 40). Mariah Carey's "Love Takes Time" is still the No. 1 pop single. 
</P>
<P>
* Sales of this Led Zeppelin retrospective set have been phenomenal. Though it 
sells for $55 in tape and $65 in CD, it's going faster than most albums. No. 40 
last week, it's jumped to No. 18.

Auction Falters: Willem de Kooning's Abstract Expressionist painting, "July 
1956," sold for $8.8 million to New York dealer Larry Gagosian on Wednesday 
night at Christie's New York. The price exceeded Christie's most optimistic 
estimate of $7 million, but the De Kooning was one of the few bright spots in a 
dismal auction of blue chip contemporary art. Twenty-eight of the 58 items 
offered failed to find buyers, and sales totaled only $36.7 million -- 
considerably less than the predicted total of $41.7 million to $65.4 million.

MICHAEL CRAWFORD TO RETURN TO 'PHANTOM' ROLE; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER: THE ORIGINATOR OF THE TITLE ROLE IN 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' WILL 
RETURN TO THE AHMANSON ON DEC. 31 TO PLAY THE PART AGAIN FOR AT LEAST THREE 
MONTHS. 
</P>

<P>
A big New Year's Eve party is being planned for Michael Crawford fans in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The originator of the title role in "The Phantom of the Opera" will return to 
the part at the Ahmanson Theatre on Dec. 31 for a run of at least three months. 
</P>
<P>
The original Phantom left the show with a grand flourish on April 29, after 
1,070 performances in London, New York and Los Angeles. He donated three pairs 
of house seats at his April 29 performance to charities; the top bidder paid 
$27,500 for a pair of seats at what was billed as his final bow. 
</P>
<P>
But now it appears that it wasn't so final. 
</P>
<P>
When Crawford left the role, he was planning on starring in the film version, 
with shooting scheduled for the fall. However, shooting of the movie has now 
been delayed until next summer. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued through a spokeswoman, Crawford said he is "delighted to 
have the opportunity to return to the Los Angeles company . . . Due to the 
delay in filming the movie version of the Phantom, it is now possible for me to 
do this. I've missed all my friends at the Ahmanson very much, and can't wait 
to see them all again." 
</P>
<P>
Four North American companies of the Andrew Lloyd Webber maxi-musical are 
reportedly selling nearly $3 million worth of tickets each week. 
</P>
<P>
When Crawford left the Ahmanson, he was replaced by Robert Guillaume, whose 
contract expires Dec. 30. Asked on Thursday how Guillaume felt about the return 
of Crawford, Guillaume's manager Hillard Elkins quipped, "He (Guillaume) 
couldn't have picked a better guy to go in and follow him." 
</P>
<P>
Does that mean Guillaume is ready and willing to leave the role? 
</P>
<P>
"Enough, already," replied Elkins. "He's going to go out and make some money." 
He added that while Guillaume was "delighted" to have played the Phantom, 
"there is a reason why the producer (of 'Phantom') is a millionaire and Michael 
Crawford is just a rich guy." 
</P>
<P>
Elkins said a television project featuring Guillaume is being assembled at 
Disney.

'MR. FROST' A LUKEWARM CHILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Mr. Frost" (selected theaters) is a minor genre piece with major names -- Jeff 
Goldblum, Alan Bates and Kathy Baker. Although this thriller of the 
supernatural is not nearly thrilling enough to warrant a trip to the theater, 
it's worth renting for admirers of its stars when it becomes available at the 
video stores early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Written by Philippe Setbon and Brad Lynch and directed by Setbon, "Mr. Frost" 
is simplicity itself, a struggle of wills between a brilliant mass murderer 
(Goldblum) and his strong, open-minded psychiatrist (Baker). Bates, the 
policeman who arrested Goldblum, is convinced that Goldblum is the devil 
incarnate, and there's no denying Goldblum wastes no time wreaking havoc at a 
posh asylum. 
</P>
<P>
It's too bad that the film isn't remotely as witty as Goldblum, who has lots of 
fun playing an insinuating, sexy tempter who calmly tries to explain that he's 
not mad, just plain evil. Indeed, what pleasure there is in watching this very 
standard item, vague and a bit flat as so many international co-productions can 
be, is derived from watching a fine cast doing a thoroughly professional job of 
trying to make something out of nothing. 
</P>
<P>
A Franco-English production handsomely photographed by Dominique Brenguier, it 
has an extraordinary lineup of players in addition to its stars, including a 
sinister Vincent Schiavelli, "Three Men and a Cradle's" Roland Giraud in his 
English-speaking debut (as the rigid chief of the mental institution) and the 
veterans Jean-Pierre Cassel, Daniel Gelin and Henri Serre (who was Jim to Oskar 
Werner's Jules).

STORIES OF WOMEN'S LIVES -- ESPECIALLY HER OWN; 
</P>
<P>
FILM: ACCLAIMED FRENCH WRITER-DIRECTOR DIANE KURYS COMES TO TERMS WITH HER 
CHILDHOOD IN 'C'EST LA VIE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"C'est la Vie," her fifth film, opened the Women in Film Festival two weeks 
ago. But if you call Diane Kurys a woman director, be prepared for some verbal 
fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a woman so I have to be a feminist," Kurys says, in excellent if heavily 
accented English, sipping coffee at the Four Seasons Hotel as she awaited the 
L.A. opening of "C'est la Vie." "But I resent the idea of being grouped with 
women. I'd rather belong to a club of short filmmakers or blue-eyed filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
"Focusing on the misogyny breaks my confidence, impedes my work," says the 
41-year-old director. "I don't want to use it as a weapon or an excuse. 
Besides, in many people's minds, a "women's film" is smaller, intimate -- a 
synonym for boring. Categorizing minimizes my work, reducing it in scale and 
putting it in a ghetto." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout her career, Kurys has tried to tap universal themes. Using her own 
life as inspiration, she combines a heavy dose of autobiography with touches of 
comic and dramatic invention. Reading biographies and listening to friends adds 
to the mix. "I'm like a sponge," she says with a smile. "I steal other people's 
memories too." 
</P>
<P>
"Peppermint Soda," which won the French equivalent of the Oscar for Kurys in 
the late '70s, tackled her coming of age at a stuffy Parisian high school. Two 
years later, she recorded her immersion into the radical politics of 1968 Paris 
in the less well-received "Cocktail Molotov." "Entre Nous" (1983), an Oscar 
nominee for best foreign-language film, documented the dissolution of her 
parents' marriage, while 1987's "A Man in Love" grappled not only with the 
subject of filmmaking and writing, but the death of her mother from cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"C'est la Vie" picks up where "Entre Nous" left off, exploring the divorce -- 
and consequent loss of innocence -- from the daughters' point of view. Written 
in a month, it's a melange of memories consciously stored on the beach in 1958 
Brittany: playing "doctor" with a family friend, tying her shoelaces for the 
first time, abandoning the family dog -- a vivid record of a summer vacation 
away from Lyons, to which Kurys, her mother and her sister never returned. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to capture the pain and desperation of the time," she says. "The 
adults whispering behind us. The feeling that something big, something we 
couldn't understand, was going on. Some scenes, such as the one in which my 
father beat my mother, were made up. But all the emotions were real." 
</P>
<P>
A movie addict as a child, Kurys still finds filmmaking a source of release -- 
a form of cinematic therapy. Still, she says, it was working with young people 
again -- not exorcising the demons of divorce -- that was the primary appeal. 
"If you direct them well, children have an innocence and vulnerability, a 
natural star quality with which even major actors have difficulty competing," 
says the effervescent Kurys, looking quasi-adolescent herself with her oversize 
charcoal-gray sweater, black stretch pants and mop of caramel curls. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something between spiritual and chemical." 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, she became pregnant herself during the first week of the shoot, 
giving birth to her first child (fathered by her companion of 25 years, 
director Alexandre Arcady) in May. 
</P>
<P>
"This film helped me come to terms with my childhood at the same time as I 
became a mother. It's very bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
Like "Entre Nous," the $5-million "C'est la Vie" features Lena (Natalie Baye), 
a character based on Kurys' mother, a strong-willed woman who deserted a 
devoted husband to search for fulfillment in Paris. As always, Kurys sidesteps 
the tendency to paint culprits and victims, opting instead for shades of gray. 
</P>
<P>
"I try not to take sides with any of my characters," she says. "I put myself in 
each of their shoes. Mother was very courageous and independent, but also quite 
selfish. She killed my father, destroyed his life. He became a wounded bear and 
never married again. 'Entre Nous' ended on a note of hope, the promise of a 
better life. This one ends sadly -- a child looking at a father who is 
suffering, starting to realize that she'd be suffering herself." 
</P>
<P>
Kurys felt pain of another sort when critics lashed into her last film, "A Man 
in Love." Starring Peter Coyote and Greta Scacchi as illicit lovers on an 
Italian movie set, it was her first English-language film and the only one to 
take place in the present. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hurt by the reaction," she says, "because the film was so personal. I'd 
been an actress who took up writing. I'd lost my mother to cancer. In previous 
films, I had exposed myself as a child, but in that one I was an adult. I felt 
like I was putting myself out there naked . . . and that they didn't like my 
body at all." 
</P>
<P>
Kurys turned down a chance to direct the version of "Les Liaisons Dangereuses" 
that was eventually directed by Stephen Frears because "as a French classic, it 
intimidated me." She also walked away from a picture about photographer Diane 
Arbus after being bypassed as screenwriter in favor of biographer Patricia 
Bosworth. Anyhow, working in Hollywood has never been a goal of hers. 
</P>
<P>
"In France, the writer-director has the power," Kurys says. "In Hollywood, it's 
the money people. You start feeling useless, like just another Kleenex in the 
box. That's a bad feeling for an artist, who relies on ego, to have. Hollywood 
is becoming less of an art and more of an industry. If Picasso were working for 
them, they'd tell him to put more blue in his pictures because the Blue Period 
sold well. They'd tell him that with no shame. It's common-denominator, 
million-dollar ideas, not personal vision." 
</P>
<P>
Her next vision? 
</P>
<P>
"I have no plans," she says with a shrug. "I can't have two pans in the oven at 
the same time. And perhaps I'm a little bit lazy. I don't sleep all day, but I 
need to travel and live. I'm not a workaholic like Woody Allen . . . and I feel 
a sense of guilt about that. I think if I'm that much of an artist, I should be 
at my desk every morning at 7. That's what a real artist is all about."

'C'EST LA VIE' PLEASANT BUT FORGETTABLE FARE FROM KURYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
French writer-director Diane Kurys has an enviable precision to her memory, and 
in "C'est la Vie" (AMC Century 14, Cineplex Beverly Center) she recalls the 
summer of 1958 when she was 13, down to the corks that decorated a beach 
vendor's hat and the lies her mother told her. 
</P>
<P>
It's extremely clear and sensual recall, covering this autobiographical young 
girl's first, clumsy kiss and her realization that her mother has a lover, but 
unlike Kurys' superb "Entre Nous," which was this same shattering summer from 
another point of view, it's nowhere nearly as affecting. 
</P>
<P>
As "C'est la Vie" opens, the mother, Lena Korski, this time played by Nathalie 
Baye, is busy with motherly, petit-bourgeois lies. Buying a half-price train 
ticket from Lyons to their customary Brittany beach resort, La Baule Les Pins, 
she says that her younger daughter, Sophie, (Candice Lefranc) is 6, not 8. 
</P>
<P>
She deceives both Sophie and 13-year-old Frederique, (Julie Bataille) by 
pretending she is going with them, then at the last minute sending them on 
their family vacation with their extremely put-out young maid, Odette. 
Over-brightly, she promises she'll be along "very soon." Freedom for mamas 
sometimes comes at a price; Kurys exacts hers now by the anger she can still 
resurrect toward her deceptions, minor and otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
She seemed more forgiving in "Entre Nous," when Lena was played by Isabelle 
Huppert and the story dealt with her deepening friendship with another woman. 
Here, Lena, her young artist-lover (Vincent London), even her angry husband 
Michel (Richard Berry) are in the background; it's the seismographic reactions 
of Frederique to the changes in herself and her family that are the film's 
minute concerns. 
</P>
<P>
There's a comfortable charm to these kids' pranks; to their excitable uncle, 
Leon (Jean-Pierre Bacri), and their indulgent, lovely aunt, Bella (Zabou), 
pregnant for a fifth time, and to the complicity among the young cousins, 
especially the one Frederique has a crush on. 
</P>
<P>
The French seem to have perfected this Colette-like sense of recall: the smell 
of a certain suntan oil, the Bobby Darin record everyone loved; whispered 
conversations between adults, secrets between terribly knowing children. 
Mostly, the French have the absolute conviction that such memories are of 
fascination to the rest of the world too. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes they are. Truffaut walked that line all the time. The marvelous "36 
Fillette" combined truth with total recall to create adolescent sexuality as it 
really is. "Murmur of the Heart's" precise observation of one specific summer 
gave Louis Malle the background for a classic film. In "Le Grand Chemin," 
another bucolic, explosive summer -- this time from the point of view of a 
young city boy -- cathartic emotions emerged between warring parents. 
</P>
<P>
Far less goes on here, certainly less that's fresh or arresting; enough to keep 
one awake but not really held. Kurys' first in this trio, "Peppermint Soda," 
had its own young fizz; "Entre Nous" was perfume, with haunting under-notes; 
"C'est la Vie" is cologne, pleasant but ephemeral.

YOU'VE HEARD 'BLUES IN NIGHT' BEFORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What could sound more inviting to a blues fan than an entire evening of blues 
songs from the '20s and '30s? With such composers as Bessie Smith, Ann Ronell 
and Jimmy Cox and such performers as Freda Payne and Obba Babatunde, how could 
it go wrong? 
</P>
<P>
"Blues in the Night," which opened Wednesday at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, 
does not exactly go wrong. It just does not really go right. The problem lies 
not with its performers (which also include Leilani Jones and Joanne Jackson) 
but with what they're made to do -- or not -- by director Sheldon Epps. 
</P>
<P>
Epps, who conceived the show eight years ago and has produced it off and on 
Broadway, in London and on tour, has taken the straightest, shortest road from 
point A to point B. It's a road paved with cliches. "Blues" is not a book 
musical, but there is a standard-issue situation and some recycled linkage 
about memories and having seen better days. 
</P>
<P>
You've heard it all before. 
</P>
<P>
The characters, too, are stereotypical, nameless people down on their luck. 
What they share is the loneliness of the cheap hotel they inhabit. They are a 
still-dashing Saloon Singer (Babatunde), an upbeat Big Mama known as the Lady 
From the Road (Jackson), a mysterious Woman of the World (Payne) and a young if 
not-so-fresh Girl With a Date (Jones). 
</P>
<P>
No question that what you're promised is what you get: Plenty of blues, which 
means plenty of gorgeous Bessie Smith, but also Johnny Mercer, Andy Razaf, 
Alberta Hunter, Vernon Duke and Duke Ellington. Among many others. 
</P>
<P>
If this were a straight cabaret act, the music and the singing would suffice. 
Both are strong, and Sy Johnson's orchestrations, Perry Hart's musical 
direction and the superior group of five musicians headed by Rahn Coleman 
provide a solid backbone. It's when Epps tries to string it all together and 
make each segment connect that he gets into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Have we ever known a Big Mama who was not full of bounce and optimism? Jackson 
does the best she can with the trite patter she's given about remembering, 
leafing through the old scrapbook and pulling something out of the trunk that 
she can wear, attach a song to and cheer herself by. 
</P>
<P>
Payne's Woman of the World has no such doggerel to contend with. Only exposed 
nerves. Hers is the tortured silence (except when she sings) of the jilted 
woman. As for Jones, her Girl With a Date hovers between eager innocence and 
lonely disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
Babatunde's Saloon Singer is the least encumbered of the characters, a handsome 
devil who knows his powers of seduction and believes in the brightness just 
around the corner. Not only is the singer a stylish dancer for whom Patricia 
Wilcox has devised some happy-go-lucky choreography, but he has some of the 
sharpest numbers in the show. 
</P>
<P>
While Epps does mix it up, allowing the singer/dancers to team up or intercut 
one song with another, there is too much symmetry to the show. Most of the 
numbers are given equal weight and presented unimaginatively in a sequential 
manner, separated by Douglas D. Smith's dark lighting scheme or that 
unenlightening patter mentioned earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Smith also did the evocative hotel set that provides rich context with Marianna 
Elliott's sexy or satiny costumes in an array of moody colors: mauve to brown 
to fuschia and soft pink and yellow. But the effect can misfire. In "Take Me 
for a Buggy Ride," Jackson is decked out like a bumble bee in a yellow and 
black stripe, with bustle and pink bows, that steals all the thunder. Her song 
seems hollow under the lavish decor. 
</P>
<P>
When the songs make a clean breast of the situational garnish, they're much 
tastier, as with the haunting "Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out," sung 
by all three women. But it doesn't happen enough. Has its age caught up with 
it? Perhaps Epps needs to do revamp his format to catch up to some of the 
classiness of more recent revues -- including "The Joni Mitchell Project." 
</P>
<P>
At 514 S. Spring St., Tuesdays through Sundays, 8 p.m., with matinees Saturdays 
and Sundays at 2. Special holiday schedule. Ends Dec. 23. $22-$27; (213)

HOME TECH CD CORNER: 2 ALBUMS OPEN ED SULLIVAN COLLECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quite amazingly, one of the nation's most celebrated pop music treasure chests 
-- the Ed Sullivan television show library -- has never been available on 
record. Until now. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Clark's "American Bandstand" may have been the everyday TV home of rock 
'n' roll in the '50s and '60s, but Sullivan's Sunday-night CBS variety show was 
the most important TV showcase for all music -- from rock and jazz to country 
and classical. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Gottlieb, a former Wall Street lawyer who made a splash in the record 
business in the mid-'80s with a series of albums devoted to television theme 
songs, has arranged with the Sullivan estate to release music from the shows in 
a series of 25 or more albums. 
</P>
<P>
The first two volumes in the series, which is titled "The Sullivan Years" and 
is available through Gottlieb's TVT Records, are devoted to jazz great Louis 
Armstrong and the '60s British rock invasion. 
</P>
<P>
The Armstrong package features 18 performances, including "Mack the Knife" and 
"Hello, Dolly!" The "British Invasion" album consists of 16 tunes by such '60s 
rock groups as the Animals, Billy J. Kramer with the Dakotas and Herman's 
Hermits. 
</P>
<P>
The next volume, titled "The Mod Sound" and due next week, features 17 songs by 
such '60s outfits as the Mamas &amp; the Papas, the Fifth Dimension and Spanky 
&amp; Our Gang. 
</P>
<P>
Why has this music -- an estimated 9,000 performances -- remained stored all 
these years in a vault at a CBS warehouse in New Jersey? 
</P>
<P>
"Some people approached (the estate) with the idea of skimming the catalogue . 
. . just using Elvis or the Beatles or (Barbra) Streisand," said Gottlieb, who 
spent two years pursuing the rights. "Our approach was to put together a 
comprehensive series."

JAZZ NOTES: SOFTER SOUND AT GRAND AVENUE BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beginning with December's bookings, changes will be made in the music policy at 
the Biltmore Hotel's Grand Avenue Bar. Instead of the room's established 
strategy of name-jazz combos and big bands, the bar will feature such duos and 
trios as Second Street, 20th Century Jazz Band and Mainstreet. 
</P>
<P>
"We are changing the jazz format because our customers seem to want jazz, but 
soft jazz in the background, so they can have conversation," said Randall 
Villareal, the hotel's managing director. "We've been trying to do performance 
quality jazz but we can see from the way that the clients talk that a lot of 
people don't want that after work. They want to be with their friends; they 
don't want to be competing with the music." 
</P>
<P>
Villareal indicated that Diane Varga, who had for four years been the producer 
of the Grand Avenue Bar's entertainment, will no longer function in that 
capacity. "We will continue to work with Diane on special events," he said. 
Villareal added that Varga "has done a great job for the room and we're very 
appreciative of her efforts." 
</P>
<P>
Varga, who recently started booking Lunaria in West Los Angeles, was obviously 
not pleased by the decision but took the news well. "It's always a painful loss 
with a room that has that many memories," she said of her leaving. "I'm just 
grateful for the four years and trying to keep my chin up and stay involved in 
the world of jazz. The (Grand Avenue) was one of the greatest experiences of my 
life because of all the wonderful friends I made there." 
</P>
<P>
On the Mend: Renowned jazz writer Stanley Dance, author of "The World of Duke 
Ellington" and "The World of Count Basie" (Da Capo) and six other books, is at 
his home in Vista, recuperating from an attack of angina he suffered while 
cruising the Caribbean on the S.S. Norway earlier this month. "He's fine, he 
had no damage to the heart," said Helen Oakley Dance, Dance's wife and author 
of several books on music herself, including the just-out-in-paperback "Stormy 
Monday: The Story of T-Bone Walker" (Da Capo). "Now the only thing I have to do 
is keep him from running around like mad. 
</P>
<P>
"We had quite an adventure," said Helen Dance. "There were two more days left 
on the cruise when Stanley became ill and the ship had to be diverted to San 
Juan, Puerto Rico, where Stanley spent four days in the hospital." 
</P>

HOME TECH: WHAT'S NEW IN VIDEO: 'ROCKY SHOW' FINALLY ARRIVES ON THE RACKS; 
</P>
<P>
THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"The most-requested unreleased movie of all time" is what CBS/Fox is calling 
"The Rocky Horror Picture Show"--meaning unreleased on videocassette, of 
course. Now the 1975 film version of the musical comedy that played L.A.'s Roxy 
Theatre the year before is finally available on video--from CBS/Fox, natch. 
</P>
<P>
Will the fans that saved "Rocky Horror" from initial flopdom by making it the 
all-time midnight-show sensation (the movie still grosses between $225,000 and 
$350,000 every week, according to producer Lou Adler) be content with watching 
it at home? Will they rent or buy the 400,000-plus copies ordered by dealers? 
</P>
<P>
With the horror-flick spoof drawing the most loyal repeat crowd in cinematic 
history--one fan is in the "Guinness Book of World Records" for attending the 
film 873 times--why not? Look for the "Rocky Horror" video-show party in your 
neighborhood this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Adler doesn't want people to stop showing up for those midnight 
showings--the video starts off with a short prologue trumpeting the advantages 
of seeing the film in theaters (where fans dress up in imitation of the wild 
"Rocky" characters, sing along with the songs, and shout things at the screen). 
Those characters include transvestite Dr. Frank N. Furter (Tim Curry) and 
innocent Janet Weiss, played by a pre-stardom Susan Sarandon. 
</P>
<P>
The devotion of "Rocky" addicts who want to buy rather than just rent the 
R-rated cassette will be severely tested, though: The price is a steep $89.98. 
</P>
<P>
This week's other big release is the 1990 theatrical hit "Back to the Future 
III" (MCA/Universal, priced for rental, PG) throws Michael J. Fox and the other 
regulars into the Wild West. 
</P>
<P>
And, along the campy mad-scientist lines of "Rocky Horror" but a lot gorier, 
there's the 1990 cult film "Frankenhooker" (SGE, $89.98) in both R-rated and 
unrated versions. There's also horror of a different, more realistic sort in 
"Chattahoochee" (HBO, $89.99, R), a 1990 drama about mistreatment in a mental 
institute, starring Gary Oldman and Dennis Hopper.

SAN NICOLAS DEVELOPS ENDLESS WATER SUPPLY; 
</P>
<P>
DROUGHT: THE NAVY INSTALLS A DESALINATION PLANT THAT USES A REVERSE OSMOSIS 
PROCESS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On San Nicolas Island, the four-year-old drought is over. 
</P>
<P>
The barren, treeless island still hasn't seen the first drop of winter rain, 
and its shallow wells have all but dried up. 
</P>
<P>
But San Nicolas' 225 residents are surrounded by the Pacific Ocean. And last 
month, they started drinking it. 
</P>
<P>
With the opening of the state's first major desalination plant on Oct. 11, San 
Nicolas Island is getting 12,000 gallons of drinking water per day from the 
ocean -- half of what's needed. A second plant will open next year, allowing 
the 27-square-mile island to cap its wells and get all its water from an 
unlimited source. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to lower the level of the Pacific Ocean," said Lt. Cmdr. Steve 
Buske, who is in charge of the Navy-controlled island 65 miles southwest of 
Point Mugu, as he greeted reporters on a tour of the plant Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
That potential for a boundless supply of water is prompting many coastal areas 
to look into desalination. Santa Barbara is studying the feasibility of a 
1-million-gallon-a-day plant. A plant due to open on Santa Catalina Island next 
year will be capable of supplying more than 600 condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
"If the drought continues, we'll be seeing these plants all along the coast," 
said Ted Kuepper, an environmental engineer for the Naval Civil Engineering 
Laboratory in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
"The technology is there," he said. "You just have to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
Desalinated water costs about $7 per 1,000 gallons, Kuepper said. By 
comparison, the city of Ventura charges about 88 cents for the same amount. 
</P>
<P>
For the Navy, desalination was much cheaper than the alternative -- bringing in 
water by barge to serve the 60 enlisted personnel and 165 civilians who help 
track missiles from the Pacific Missile Test Center at Point Mugu. No families 
live there, but dozens of workers and contractors who commute to the island 
increase the demand for water. 
</P>
<P>
This past summer, when as many as 600 people were working on the island some 
days, the water shortage was getting desperate, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In a normal year, San Nicolas gets only about six inches of rain, less than 
half the normal rainfall on the Ventura County coast. Since the drought began, 
San Nicolas has received even less rain. 
</P>
<P>
This past summer, water had to be turned off except for two three-hour periods 
a day. Flights to the mainland were increased to cut down on the number of 
people staying overnight, and family members were no longer permitted to visit 
the island. 
</P>
<P>
Mess halls switched to paper plates and plastic utensils to cut down on washing 
dishes. Car washing was banned, despite severe corrosion caused by the island's 
salty air. 
</P>
<P>
The solution was found in a desalination plant developed by the Marines in the 
early 1980s, after the Iranian hostage crisis prompted military planners to 
prepare for desert warfare. Today, the Marines have hundreds of similar plants, 
many of which are being used to supply troops in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
There are several ways of removing the salt that makes up 3.5% of salt water: 
distillation, freezing, electrodialysis and reverse osmosis, the process used 
on San Nicolas and in most commercial plants. 
</P>
<P>
Reverse osmosis may sound high-tech and exotic, but it is actually just the 
reverse of a process that occurs everywhere in nature. The body's cells absorb 
water by osmosis. So do the roots of a plant. 
</P>
<P>
Under normal conditions, when salt water and fresh water are on opposite sides 
of a membrane or filter, the fresh water flows through the membrane into the 
denser salt solution. In effect, the fresh water wants to dilute the salt 
water. 
</P>
<P>
By exerting pressure on the salt solution, however, the osmosis process can be 
reversed. If the pressure on the salt water is great enough, the natural flow 
is turned around. Fresh water flows out of the salt solution, creating more 
fresh water and saltier salt water. 
</P>
<P>
The San Nicolas plant, housed in a building the size of a two-car garage, takes 
salt water from wells on the island's northern beach and runs it through a 
series of filters under pressure. For every gallon of fresh water that emerges, 
about three gallons of water with a 5% salt content are produced. 
</P>
<P>
The saltier water is returned to the beach. Kuepper said tests have shown that 
the saltier water is so diluted by the time it reaches the water table that it 
has no environmental impact. 
</P>
<P>
The fresh water, meanwhile, is stored in tanks. It contains virtually no iron 
or other minerals and tastes sweet. Residents say it tastes a lot better than 
water from the island's wells. 
</P>
<P>
"The well water doesn't taste too good," said Scott Mullaley, a civilian 
firefighter who lives in Oxnard but works six-day shifts on San Nicolas. 
</P>
<P>
Mullaley said the end of the island's water crisis has raised expectations 
among residents. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a pool," he said, "but it's not operational -- yet."

MINISTER FOUND GUILTY IN THEFT OF $1.7 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Ventura County Superior Court jury convicted an Ojai minister Thursday of 
using a phony investment scheme to swindle approximately $1.7 million from 
about 30 people, including several of his own parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
Robert J. Brancato, 55, a minister with the Church of Christ, stood 
expressionless as a court clerk read guilty verdicts on 23 charges of grand 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
The jury in the monthlong trial, which Judge Kenneth Yegan called "lengthy and 
complicated," acquitted Brancato on one charge of grand theft and three charges 
of tax evasion in connection with the operation of National Preferred Business 
Services, a company he ran from 1984 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Deputy Dist. Atty. John L. Geb, who prosecuted the case, said he was 
happy with the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Geb said Brancato funneled half of the money to himself. Another 25% was used 
for office expenses, and the remaining 25% was sent to investors to make them 
believe they were earning substantial interest on their investments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Geb said prosecutors learned of the scheme from concerned investors, who became 
suspicious of Brancato in 1988. A grand jury indicted Brancato in December, 
1989, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite an impassioned argument from defense attorney George Dyer that Brancato 
would not leave town, Yegan ordered the minister held in Ventura County Jail 
without bail until a sentencing hearing Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Geb argued that Brancato could be sentenced to 10 years in prison and is at 
risk of fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
"He could be hundreds of miles away from here in a day or two," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As Brancato was led away by sheriff's marshals, several of his relatives, who 
sat in the front row of the courtroom, waved and smiled. "I love you," an 
elderly woman called out to him. Brancato smiled and waved back. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Dreema Brancato, gave her husband a thumbs-up signal as he was taken 
through a back door. 
</P>
<P>
Brancato's relatives declined to comment after the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Clinton Storm, a minister at the Church of Christ in Ojai, called Brancato a 
"maverick preacher" who was not affiliated with any Church of Christ in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
Storm said Brancato held services for almost a year in a rented hall at a 
junior high school. He said Brancato told him that he did not want to preach at 
the Ojai church because he wanted to pursue his own "special views on the 
church." Storm said he could not elaborate on those views. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the trial, Dyer had argued that Brancato's only crime was trying to 
operate a "risky and foolhardy" venture that eventually failed. 
</P>
<P>
"He tried some sort of venture . . . even I could never comprehend what it was, 
but it was not illegal," he said after the verdict. "I think the guy intended 
to help people and it didn't work out, and this is where he ended up." 
</P>
<P>
Geb said Brancato began his operation by selling insurance. Through 
applications, he determined which clients had a great deal of money to invest, 
the deputy district attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently those with the most liquid assets he would try to present 
investment offers," Geb said. 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, Brancato bilked most of the investors out of 
$25,000 to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
One investor, Michael Harris of North Hollywood, testified earlier in the trial 
that he got back less than $14,000 of the $130,000 he invested in a five-year 
"debt-security" plan through Brancato's company. 
</P>
<P>
"I was agitated because I had not received a return on my investment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Geb said Brancato promised investors that their money would go toward projects 
to help reduce unemployment and mortgage rates and benefit military veterans.

FIRE IN CONVERTED GARAGE BURNS RESIDENT; 
</P>
<P>
MEINERS OAKS: OFFICIALS SAY THE 70-YEAR-OLD MAN WAS SMOKING IN BED AT THE 
BOARD-AND-CARE FACILITY, WHICH HAS BEEN CITED FIVE TIMES FOR SAFETY AND 
MAINTENANCE VIOLATIONS. 
</P>

<P>
A 70-year-old man housed in a garage that had been converted to a bedroom set 
fire to his room while smoking in bed Thursday and was burned severely as he 
lay helpless in the Ojai Valley board-and-care facility, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The smoke detector had been disconnected in Victor Rose's room in the 
Shangri-La Guest Home in Meiners Oaks, and the fire was not detected until it 
blew out the windows in the converted garage, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Rose was listed in critical condition Thursday evening in the burn center of 
the Sherman Oaks Community Hospital, where he was transferred from the Ventura 
County Medical Center, a hospital spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Second- and third-degree burns covered 90% to 95% of his body, said Norm Plott 
of the Ventura County Fire Department. Rose, whose nostrils and mouth were 
singed, also inhaled a great deal of smoke, Plott said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very traumatic fire that the victim was not able to escape, and the 
only way he was able to get out was because of the efforts of the caretaker," 
Plott said. 
</P>
<P>
Caretakers at the residential home -- which has been cited by the state five 
times this year for violations of safety and maintenance regulations -- gave 
Rose a cigarette at 8 a.m., authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Rose probably fell asleep and either his clothing or the bedding caught on 
fire, Plott said. The man, who used a walker to get around, was probably unable 
to move quickly when he became aware of the flames, Plott said. The fire 
further incapacitated him, apparently imprisoning him in the bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
The caretakers, who were in the main house, said they realized that something 
was wrong when they heard a loud bang about 9:25 a.m. That probably was the 
sound of windows bursting out from the fire's extreme heat, Plott said. 
</P>
<P>
Rose was pulled from the room by Alberto Trocio, 62, who tends the facility 
with his wife, Magdalena, 62. 
</P>
<P>
Trocio said he was in the kitchen when he heard a loud sound from Rose's room. 
</P>
<P>
"We had just finished our breakfast in the kitchen and heard a big bang from 
his unit," Trocio said. "I ran in there and the flames were already over him 
and his bed. I grabbed him and pulled him out." 
</P>
<P>
Trocio helped put out the fire on Rose's body. He also tried to quench the 
flames in the bedroom, sustaining second-degree burns to his hands, Plott said. 
Trocio sought treatment from a private physician, Plott said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Magdalena Trocio said she and passersby in the neighborhood of 
well-tended houses helped usher three other residents from the house. Three 
more clients were housed in a separate building, Magdalena Trocio said. 
</P>
<P>
John McCarty, 29, who lives a couple of blocks from the care home, said he was 
on his way to work when he saw the fire and pulled over to help. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy was on fire," he said. "His skin and hair was all on fire." 
</P>
<P>
McCarty said he helped pull Rose farther from the building and a couple of 
times put out the fire that threatened the man. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept telling him, 'Hang in there, buddy,' " McCarty said. "His eyes were 
open, and I think he heard me." 
</P>
<P>
An off-duty Ventura County sheriff's deputy then rushed from his house across 
the street to offer first aid. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Rick Jones, who works at the Ojai station, said he had finished work at 
7 a.m. and was asleep when his wife told him that there was a fire at the 
board-and-care facility and a man lying outside on fire. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of another passerby, he pulled pieces of burning clothing from 
Rose's body. When firefighters arrived with first-aid supplies, Jones, who 
formerly worked as an emergency medical technician, poured water on the burning 
man. 
</P>
<P>
Rose was taken by helicopter to the Ventura County Medical Center as 
firefighters continued to investigate the blaze that caused $10,000 damage to 
the structure and a $2,000 loss in contents. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, who formerly lived in Ventura, had been staying at the facility for about 
a year, Magdalena Trocio said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ojai facility is one of three operated by Celestina Pascual, according to 
the state Department of Social Services Community Care Licensing Agency. The 
other two, which are licensed to house five people and six people, are in Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Pascual refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Ojai facility was cited by the state five times in 1990 for regulation 
violations, said Janet Seely, a licensing program analyst. 
</P>
<P>
The agency, which licenses and monitors residential board-and-care facilities, 
cited the Ojai facility in June and in September for having a non-ambulatory 
person in a room that was cleared for fire safety only for ambulatory 
residents, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Other citations were restraining a client in a chair, the malfunctioning of an 
emergency call signal in a client's room and the absence of a ramp on the 
kitchen steps, Seely said. 
</P>
<P>
Pascual received five other citations for a Simi Valley facility on Languid 
Lane. All of the citations in Pascual's facilities were cleared, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The state will investigate the fire, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
All clients were relocated to other facilities or relatives' homes, said Ron 
Laux, supervisor of the state agency.

U.S. REFUSES TO GIVE $7.2 MILLION FOR TENT CITY; 
</P>
<P>
JAILS: THE COUNTY'S GRANT APPLICATION, WHICH SOUGHT FOUR TIMES THE AMOUNT OF 
AVAILABLE FUNDING, IS REJECTED. 
</P>

<P>
A plan to jail Ventura County's casual drug users in a tent city, which would 
cost nearly four times the money available under a nationwide federal program, 
has been rejected as too expensive and outside grant-application guidelines, 
U.S. officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Office of Justice Programs sent a letter, dated Oct. 22, to Sheriff John V. 
Gillespie denying the $7.2-million grant application that he and Dist. Atty. 
Michael D. Bradbury submitted last spring, said the project's grant 
coordinator, Sheriff's Lt. Michael Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Of 63 applicants for the $2 million available nationwide under the Innovative 
Neighborhood Oriented Policing Programs, nine were awarded grants of $100,000 
to $200,000 each, said Velva Walter, spokeswoman for the U.S. Bureau of Justice 
Assistance. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Drug Control Strategy, as local officials have dubbed the 
tent city plan, was rejected because putting it into action would be too costly 
and would not focus primarily on drug education as required under the federal 
program, Walter said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he had been unaware that the grant application was out of line 
because the office of Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) had assured the 
sheriff last spring that $58 million was available and had encouraged the 
county to apply for some of it. 
</P>
<P>
"We were never told there was any kind of limit placed on the application," 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
A $7.2-million grant would have paid for more police officers to arrest casual 
drug users, more court staff to process their cases, a tent jail to house them 
and education programs to deter others from becoming casual drug users, Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"You get the feeling that maybe they're not serious about the war on drugs," 
Brown said of the Justice Department's rejection of the county's application. 
"But they can't fund all of them. There were 63 applications." 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie could not be reached for comment Thursday. But Assistant Sheriff 
Richard Bryce, chief of the department's custody division, expressed 
disappointment that the county program had been turned down for funding. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to get upset," Bryce said Thursday. "We're not going to give up on 
trying to find some sort of funding. We thought it was an opportunity for the 
federal government to show a direct link with local government in the war on 
drugs." 
</P>
<P>
But Bryce said there are few options now that the federal request has been 
denied and anti-drug-campaign funding was rejected Tuesday by California 
voters. Plus, he said, the Navy's refusal last month to let the county build 
the tent city on land at the Naval Construction Battalion Center in Port 
Hueneme further frustrates the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury said the government's rejection was "disappointing but not unexpected. 
. . . We did not have high hopes of that kind of funding from the federal 
government." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury said Gillespie told him Gallegly would see that the Ventura County 
plan was presented to William Bennett, head of the president's office of 
National Drug Control Strategy. Bradbury said he attended a recent political 
function with Bennett, who announced Thursday that he plans to resign, and that 
the drug czar had not heard of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I specifically asked him about our plan because I had been told it was going 
to be presented to him," Bradbury said Thursday. "He was unaware of it but 
seemed very interested and asked me to get all the information to him, which I 
did 10 days ago." 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly said he does not know what led to the plan's rejection. "But our 
office had corresponded with Bill Bennett's office in an effort to get this 
into the hopper." 
</P>
<P>
However, Gallegly said he does not remember personally mentioning the plan to 
Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) said he and Gallegly wrote letters in 
support of the program to the Justice Department on June 19 but heard nothing 
more until this week when they learned that the plan had been rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Upon learning of the grant application's failure, Ventura County Public 
Defender Kenneth I. Clayman said: "That's good. I think it would have been a 
very wasteful thing." 
</P>
<P>
Clayman said he would rather the county focus on anti-drug education in the 
schools. "But to create a system to pump a whole new bunch of people into the 
criminal justice arena is not a good idea," he said.

MAN WHO DUMPED BRAKE FLUID GETS JAIL

<TEXT>
<P>
A former employee of a Ventura auto repair shop was sentenced to 90 days in 
jail and fined $5,000 Thursday after pleading no contest to a charge of dumping 
more than 100 gallons of used brake fluid alongside the Ventura Freeway in the 
Seacliff area. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Wayne Glaze, 24, now a resident of Utah, also was placed on 36 months 
probation by Municipal Judge Herbert Curtis III. 
</P>
<P>
Glaze pleaded no contest to a charge of unlawful disposal of hazardous waste. A 
second charge against him was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Linda S. Groberg said 21 five-gallon cans of the fluid were 
found near the freeway Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the material had seeped out, but most was still in the cans, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Brake fluid has a high lead content and could pose a public-health danger if it 
contaminates the drinking water supply, said Nicholas Guzik, a hazardous waste 
investigator for the California Highway Patrol. JACK SEARLES

A reputed Oxnard gang member denied he killed a 17-year-old clerk after 
exchanging dirty looks with a passenger in the victim's car in a gang-related 
incident of "mad-dogging." 
</P>
<P>
Jessie Casares, 20, pleaded not guilty in Ventura County Municipal Court 
Wednesday to charges of murder and possession of a firearm in the Oct. 22 
shooting death of William F. Leadbetter of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Casares also denied a charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm, which 
stemmed from an earlier conviction for possessing a dagger, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Donald C. Glynn said. 
</P>
<P>
William was driving along 5th Street with a passenger, Joey Ramirez, 20, an 
alleged member of the Trouble Street El Rio gang, when the two passed a car 
driven by Casares, an alleged member of the rival Colonia gang, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Casares and Ramirez began exchanging dirty looks or "mad-dogging," police said, 
and both cars pulled into the parking lot of a coin-operated laundry. Casares 
got out of his car and began shooting a .25-caliber pistol, hitting William 
once in the eye, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Steven Hintz ordered Casares held in lieu of $250,000 bail pending a 
preliminary hearing next month. MACK REED

BOARD SEEKS BROADER PROTECTION FOR TREES

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County Board of Supervisors has sent a proposed ordinance aimed at 
preserving oak and sycamore trees back to the drawing board, urging that it 
cover a broader area. 
</P>
<P>
As drafted, the ordinance would have affected 26,000 acres in unincorporated 
areas of the county. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural and open space lands were excluded from the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of several residents and community organizations, the ordinance 
will be redrafted to include all unincorporated areas of the county, which 
would add an additional 500,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance would regulate the removal and trimming of the trees. 
Property owners could seek permission to remove trees if they are diseased, in 
the way of public utilities or a threat to public safety. 
</P>
<P>
If property owners want to remove trees to build or expand a building, a more 
stringent permit process would be required. 
</P>
<P>
Also, property owners would be required to apply for a permit to trim larger 
oak or sycamore trees. JANE HULSE

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BABY-SITTER GETS 15 YEARS TO LIFE IN 
CHILD'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Van Nuys baby-sitter was sentenced Thursday to 15 years to life in prison for 
shaking an 18-month-old girl so violently that the child died. 
</P>
<P>
Nova Marcia Thompson, 35, sat quietly as Judge Judith Meisels Ashmann sentenced 
her for the June 9, 1989, death of Jasmine Lynn Sanders, who lapsed into a coma 
after being shaken and scalded with water. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Thompson shook the toddler because she was not chewing her 
food properly. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson pleaded guilty in October to one count of second-degree murder, 
averting a trial in which her own daughter would have been the main witness 
against her. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for Thompson's plea, prosecutors dropped one count each of felony 
child abuse and corporal infliction of injury stemming from a severe burn on 
Jasmine's foot and bruises on her face, head and torso.

Armed with protest signs and buttons, about 50 Conejo Valley teachers objected 
Thursday night to slowed contract negotiations with the district. 
</P>
<P>
The contract for the Unified Assn. of Conejo Teachers expired June 30. 
</P>
<P>
The union is seeking a 10% raise for the 1990-91 school year, while the Conejo 
Valley Unified School District officials have offered 4% this year and 3.2% for 
each of the following two years. 
</P>
<P>
There are 712 teachers represented by the union. The next negotiating session 
is scheduled Dec. 11. 
</P>
<P>
The protest came before the biweekly meeting of the Conejo Valley Unified 
school board. 
</P>
<P>
Later at the meeting, district officials presented their proposal for a new 
contract affecting 600 classified employees, including secretaries, custodians 
and maintenance and food workers. The pact calls for raises to be based on the 
amount of money the district receives from the state. STEPHANIE STASSEL

BILL BOYARSKY: KATZ: SETTING A COURSE FOR NEXT TIME 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
You can lay on thick layers of emotional writing about the agonies of political 
defeat and the joys of victory. 
</P>
<P>
Elections lend themselves to that. And there was plenty of material on election 
night at Democratic headquarters in downtown Los Angeles' Biltmore Hotel. The 
old hotel was just loaded with winners and losers. 
</P>
<P>
But amid all that pathos was something more interesting: a politician who was 
looking ahead, rather than celebrating or mourning the past. Democratic 
Assemblyman Richard Katz of Sylmar, oblivious to the tumult around him, was 
putting in a hard night's work, unsentimentally charting his own future. 
</P>
<P>
Katz wasn't part of the sad scene in Suite 438. There, Atty. Gen. John K. Van 
de Kamp presided over the gloomy hospitality room for Proposition 131, the 
losing term-limit and public campaign finance measure he had backed. With a few 
breaks, luck or better tactics, Van de Kamp -- not Dianne Feinstein -- would 
have been the Democratic nominee for governor. 
</P>
<P>
Things were happier in other places. For the sheer joy of victory, you couldn't 
beat the party for Assemblywoman Maxine Waters of Los Angeles, just elected to 
Congress. A band played and people cheered. "I love my work," she told 
supporters. "I love it better when I win." 
</P>
<P>
And then there was Katz, pursuing his tunnel-vision course. He's considering 
running for mayor of Los Angeles in 1993 and his evening at the Biltmore was a 
small but important step in the long, obstacle-strewn path ahead. 
</P>
<P>
This is when campaigns begin, long before the election, when the candidates 
meet the contributors, Chamber of Commerce types, labor leaders, lobbyists, 
neighborhood activists and all the others who form a campaign organization. 
</P>
<P>
He was all over the hotel, a man in motion. Into the Gold Room, where Kathleen 
Brown was celebrating. Over to the Crystal Room, into the despair of the losing 
Big Green campaign. Out into the hall again, over to the bar. Katz shook hands 
with labor leaders. He shook hands with business people. He shook hands with 
fellow pols, with neighborhood leaders. Why, he even shook hands with me. 
</P>
<P>
Katz is a slender man of 40 with dark hair and a mustache. He's been in the 
Legislature a decade and now feels ready to move on. He has immersed himself in 
issues important to his San Fernando Valley district and to the city as a 
whole. He has proposed paving over the Los Angeles River for another freeway to 
the Valley. He's also pressed for light rail and tried to bring some order into 
the confused political organization of L.A. public transit. 
</P>
<P>
But he's got his liabilities. For one thing, some people who know him wonder 
whether he has the temperament. Katz affects sort of a laid-back, old-Valley 
country style, wearing cowboy boots and riding horses. But he's intense -- 
often tense -- about his work. When things go bad in the office, I'm told, he 
explodes at his staff. 
</P>
<P>
He's also not as well-known as potential rivals. State lawmakers are politics' 
unknown soldiers. Los Angeles television disdains state Capitol news. And there 
are so many senators and Assembly members that individual lawmakers find it 
hard to make the newspapers unless they've won a major legislative victory or 
been accused of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly in an attempt to fathom reluctant editors' minds, Katz has just hired 
one to be his chief of staff. He's Doug Dowie, former managing editor of the 
Daily News, whose temper is supposed to be as hot as that of his new boss. 
Those who know them expect the sound waves to hit the Grapevine if they ever 
clash. 
</P>
<P>
There was no sign of that Tuesday night when the Katz-Dowie team hit the 
Biltmore. 
</P>
<P>
He finally sat down for a drink in the bar. Katz had a coke. Dowie and I had 
beer. "I'm still interested in running for mayor," he said. "I'm looking at it 
very seriously." 
</P>
<P>
As Katz sees it, his strength against the other contenders is his Valley base. 
He figures he'd win the Valley over any of the other possibilities -- Mayor Tom 
Bradley, council members Zev Yaroslavsky, Gloria Molina, Richard Alatorre and 
Joy Picus or City Atty. Jim Hahn and Assemblyman Mike Roos. 
</P>
<P>
I asked him if he thought being a state legislator would hurt him. "No," he 
said, "I'm not in the City Council and that hurts you more." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Katz's attention started to wander. He'd given me all he wanted -- and 
all I could use. Further conversation would be a waste of time. He jumped up 
and joined a large party a couple of tables away. 
</P>
<P>
If Katz keeps on with it, he'll be table-hopping for another 2 1/2 years, until 
the election in the spring of 1993. So will the others. Then it will be their 
night to celebrate, or to mourn.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BANK OFFICE CLOSED BY METHANE BUILDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Wells Fargo Bank office in the Fairfax District -- near the site of a 1985 
methane gas explosion that injured 21 people -- remained closed Thursday after 
an apparent buildup of methane was discovered inside a bank wall. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Kellogg, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco-based bank, said about 15 
employees of the branch were evacuated Wednesday after an inspector monitoring 
the building for methane odors removed an electrical plate from the wall and 
was hit by heavy fumes. 
</P>
<P>
The office, at Beverly Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue, will remain closed until 
the source of the fumes has been pinpointed, Kellogg said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1985 explosion occured a few blocks from the bank branch in the basement of 
a Ross Dress for Less store across from Farmers Market. 
</P>
<P>
The entire neighborhood lies above a gas pocket formed from decomposed plant 
materials buried 100 to 200 feet underground. The pocket has been seeping gas 
to the surface for thousands of years.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To Extend Consumer Agency 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 375 to 41, the House sent to the White House a bill to keep the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission alive with budgets of $42 million in fiscal 
1991 and $45 million in 1992. President Bush was expected to sign the measure 
(S605). 
</P>
<P>
The agency has been slowed in its mission by battles between consumer and 
business interests over how far it should go to keep hazardous products off the 
market. This bill makes it easier for it to obtain a quorum to conduct 
business. Among other provisions, it requires manufacturers to inform the panel 
if they lose a threshold number of lawsuits over their products, and mandates 
safety standards for a few risky products, including garage door openers and 
cigarette lighters that are easily ignited by children. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Doug Walgren (D-Pa.) said the bill has strong backing from consumer 
groups and the agency itself. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Howard C. Nielson (R-Utah) said: "The bill outrageously mismanages, 
micromanages, this agency." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to reauthorize the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

Immigration Reform 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 264 to 118, the House gave final congressional approval of a bill 
(S358) reforming the process of legal immigration into the United States. 
President Bush was expected to sign the bill, under which the current limit of 
500,000 immigrants annually will be raised to 700,000 between 1992-94, then 
drop permanently to 650,000. The majority of the new visas will go to people 
with needed job and professional skills or who come from European and African 
countries that have had low quotas in recent decades. One innovation is a 
set-aside of 10,000 visas each year for investors of at least $1 million in 
new, job-creating businesses in America. 
</P>
<P>
The bill eases restrictions based on ideology and sexual preference, gives the 
Department of Health and Human Services power to admit immigrants who may be 
infected with AIDS, and is more protective than current law of political 
refugees from El Salvador and elsewhere in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to pass the immigration reform bill.

Clean Air 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 401 to 25, the House gave its final approval of a bill (S1630) 
accelerating federal efforts to make the air healthier to breathe, protect the 
Earth's ozone layer against further depletion and curb the damage acid rain 
inflicts on lakes and forests. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush was set to sign the first upgrade of the Clean Air Act in 13 
years. Supported by much of the business community and environmentalists, the 
750-page measure relies on economic incentives and tough civil and criminal 
penalties to achieve its goals. The bill curbs toxic emissions from motor 
vehicles, power plants, factories, dry cleaners and all other significant 
contributors to air pollution. It seeks to cut acid rain by curbing high-sulfur 
coal emissions from Midwestern power plants, mandates cleaner gasolines and 
tighter exhaust controls on motor vehicles, and requires the more than 100 
cities with the dirtiest air to lower pollution to acceptable levels over the 
next five to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote supported the bill.

They are Chargers, but without the aid of a uniform or an American Express 
card, they would have difficulty proving it. 
</P>
<P>
They practice, they get paid and sometimes they even play. 
</P>
<P>
"Two plays against Seattle," said Mike Zandofsky, while holding two fingers in 
the air, but who noticed? 
</P>
<P>
And who's Mike Zandofsky? 
</P>
<P>
He's a Charger, just like Mark Rodenhauser. Who? You know, like Tony Savage and 
Anthony Shelton. Who? 
</P>
<P>
While Billy Joe Tolliver and Billy Ray Smith play leading roles for the 
Chargers, there's also a who's who roll call of who are these guys residing in 
the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my life being unknown, no respect," Richard Brown said. "I would like 
to see the spotlight someday . . ." 
</P>
<P>
But who is Richard Brown? 
</P>
<P>
They don't get interviewed very often, if at all. They don't get seen on 
television unless fans make it back from the bathroom or refrigerator in time 
to view the kickoff. They don't get asked for their autographs, because they 
aren't Billy Joe or Billy Ray. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, they are free agents. They are at the bottom of the 47-man 
roster, and in time they will either replace Billy Joe and Billy Ray or be gone 
without fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
During the week, they practice as actors and assume the role of the opposition 
so the Chargers' better-known players can prepare themselves properly for 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Someone such as Zandofsky might begin practice wearing the blue jersey of a 
defender and work at defensive tackle or defensive end against the starting 
offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
Then it's off with the blue jersey to wear white and play dummy guard against 
the likes of Lee Williams or Burt Grossman. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Zandofsky warms up like Williams and Grossman, and then after the 
national anthem, they separate. Williams and Grossman go to work; Zandofsky 
stands on the sideline waiting for opportunity to beckon. It will be a long 
wait. 
</P>
<P>
They are all Chargers, but contributions vary. There are starters, and there 
are key substitutes, and there are special teams assignments. And although some 
of these big-time players may finish the afternoon with more fingers than plays 
in the ballgame, they can still make the difference between victory and defeat. 
</P>
<P>
You may even notice one of them, and recognize the number on his back. But the 
name, well, it escapes: 
</P>
<P>

No. 64 
</P>
<P>
Next to Jeff Bridges, who gets to make movies with Michelle Pfeiffer, Mark 
Rodenhauser has the best job in America. He will earn $112,500 this year for 
snapping the ball on punts, field-goal attempts and PATs. Thanks for showing 
up, Mark. Last week against the Seattle Seahawks he hiked the ball 11 times to 
earn his $7,031.25 weekly paycheck. And he's single, and so all that is his. 
</P>
<P>
He has played in 34 NFL games because he can do one thing: snap the football. 
"If I hadn't learned how to do that, I'd be working at my construction company 
in Illinois right now," Rodenhauser said. "My coach took me to the side in high 
school and said, 'You're going to be a long snapper.' He started me on some 
drills, and I was really horrible on it. Couldn't do the drills, and still 
can't, but I could snap the ball." 
</P>
<P>
He knows the other side of professional football: He played for the Chicago 
Bruisers in the Arena Football League before signing as a replacement player 
with the Chicago Bears during the 1987 strike. He stuck around to cash a 
playoff check before being released before the 1988 season. He played 16 games 
as a punt snapper for the Minnesota Vikings, but was left unprotected as a Plan 
B free agent. 
</P>
<P>
Charger General Manager Bobby Beathard was out of town when Rodenhauser arrived 
for a tryout. Billy Devaney, director of personnel, took a gander and 
immediately signed him. "You could say that's the easiest job on the field in 
total work output," special teams coordinator Larry Pasquale said. "But the 
responsibility is pretty awesome." 
</P>

<P>
The NFL fairy tale of the year begins in Tarbaro, N.C., and ends in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Frank is a strong safety at Winston Salem State, and Devaney is there to 
look him over. "I'm looking at videotapes and there isn't anything to get 
excited about, so I go over to Wake Forest," he said. "I figure I might as well 
accomplish something while I'm down here, so I also get in a good run before 
going back to Winston Salem State later in the day. The field they have is real 
clumpy, so I time him running on the tennis courts. 
</P>
<P>
"He runs like gangbusters, but the thing that strikes me is he looks like a 
bodybuilder. I say to him, 'You don't mess around with any of those illegal 
substances to make you bigger?' Shock of all shocks, he says, no. But that's 
how he works out. He's stiff, so I say, get off the weights. And in my infinite 
wisdom, I go back and say, 'Shoot, he might be a decent free agent, but I don't 
think he's worth a draft choice.' You can see, we were right on top of that 
one." 
</P>
<P>
After the draft, Frank's agent couldn't find any other takers, so he agreed to 
have his client sign with the Chargers. After two days of practice at safety, 
the Chargers concluded that he had little chance to make the team, so why not 
move him to corner? "The rest they say, is mini-history," Devaney said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank has started two games as a rookie free agent and has an interception, 
"and is the talk of the league," Devaney said. "We figured we'd sign him, give 
him some reps in training camp, it's been real, and then send him back to 
Tarbaro in three weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Said Beathard, "It's a fluke. Every once in a while you have to get lucky, and 
we got lucky with Donald Frank." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

"He's a certified psycho," Devaney said. Some folks have business cards, Steve 
Hendrickson inspires nicknames. Teammates have nicknamed him "Rockethead." He 
made the first tackle in last year's Super Bowl for San Francisco, and although 
he missed five games, he was the 49ers' special teams player of the year. It 
takes a rare athlete to turn the heads of other athletes, but when Hendrickson 
runs down the field in kickoff coverage, they all watch. 
</P>
<P>
Hendrickson plays on all four major special teams (kickoff coverage and return, 
punt coverage and return), and would play every day if they let him. He's 
listed as a linebacker, but is being used as an H-back. He practiced as a 
fullback with the 49ers, but he has yet to carry the ball in an NFL game. If he 
ever scores, look for him to spike the ball so hard that it sticks in the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in Indianapolis this year when the Plan B free agent list came out," 
Devaney said. "And as soon as we saw the 49ers didn't protect him, he was the 
first guy we called. It was a matter of 10 minutes after the list came out. We 
called his agent and said we'd do anything, and he said, 'no, he's still with 
the 49ers.' " 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers had worked out a deal behind the scenes to keep Hendrickson from 
going elsewhere. "I had 18 teams call me and San Diego was first, but . . . I 
had made an agreement with the 49ers that I would stay and they would increase 
my salary," Hendrickson said. 
</P>
<P>
Hendrickson said he came close to making John Madden's All-Madden team last 
year, but was advised by the CBS broadcaster that he'll be in the running down 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he'll ever be a superstar, but he's going to play a long time in 
this league," Devaney said. "He adds so much to a team. His enthusiasm is 
infectious." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

No. 70 
</P>
<P>
The rap on Mike Zandofsky in Phoenix, besides that he was a disappointment on 
the field, was that he gave dull interviews. The Chargers went ahead and traded 
for him anyway. 
</P>
<P>
He was a third-round pick for Phoenix and started seven games as a rookie, but 
the Chargers got him for a ninth-round choice in 1991. And it will be 1991 
before the Chargers find out if he can play. 
</P>
<P>
No need to wait that long to find out if he provides good quotes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No. 79 
</P>
<P>
He played four years in high school, four years in college and now Tony Savage 
trails Coach Dan Henning on the sideline making sure the coach doesn't trip 
over the wires coming from his headset. "It's something you don't want to make 
a career out of," Savage said. 
</P>
<P>
Savage was a fifth-round pick of the New York Jets this season, and was 
released on the final cut before the start of the regular season. He needs only 
a Spanish class to earn his degree in sociology from Washington State. He was 
prepared to return to school when the Green Bay Packers, Seahawks and Chargers 
called. "I was going to go to Kansas City, too, for a tryout, but the Chargers 
signed me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of Joe Phillips gave Savage a chance to earn a steady NFL paycheck, 
and follow Henning on the sideline. The last guy to carry Henning's wires, Mike 
Withycombe, lasted three games and then was cut. Tough business. 
</P>
<P>
"We picked him up based on what he did his junior season in college," Beathard 
said. "He was one of the highest-rated defensive lineman, but he got too heavy. 
The Jets wanted to keep him, but at his junior weight of 285. He came in there 
at 305. We may want to take a look at him as an offensive guard, but we'll find 
out first what he can do on defense." 
</P>
<P>
Said Savage: "That's news to me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No. 90 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers had chance to sign Richard Brown as a free agent two years ago, 
but passed. "Rudy Feldman (Chargers' director of pro personnel) wanted me, but 
I guess the man (Steve Ortmayer) who is no longer here didn't like me. But I'm 
here now and that's all that counts." 
</P>
<P>
When Brown was selected the Chargers' special teams captain he acted like 
someone who was called on stage by Bob Barker of "The Price Is Right." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who was defensive MVP in the Holiday Bowl for San Diego State, went on 
to become the Rams' top special teams performer. He bought a house near Rams 
Park, played for the Rams in 1987, and then again in 1989, and now says of the 
situation, "as far as the Rams are concerned, I don't care about them anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Since joining the Chargers, he has had to contend with ticket requests from 
former San Diego State friends. "I see them at grocery stores and see them 
around town, and I give them tickets," he said. "I want everyone to come and 
see the Chargers' improvement. I spent like $300 on tickets for the Raiders' 
game for people . . . some people I really didn't know . . . but that's just 
something I like to do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No. 23 
</P>
<P>
The Charger scouts focused their off-season attention on Tennessee State 
cornerback Tony Stargell. The Chargers had the 57th pick in the draft, and were 
prepared to take him, but with the 56th selection the Jets announced they were 
grabbing Stargell. San Francisco, meanwhile, waited until the 11th round to 
take Stargell's Tennessee State teammate, Anthony Shelton, and that's what got 
the Chargers' attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a tip before we played the 49ers in the preseason that they really like 
Shelton," Beathard said. "He started our game and I watched him the whole game. 
They were going to waive him and then bring him back, but we claimed him." They 
stole him. 
</P>
<P>
Stargell, meanwhile, has been a bust with the Jets. You remember, Lou Brock? 
</P>
<P>
Shelton played only 13 games in college, and suffered a broken ankle in his 
junior season. But the 49ers are Super Bowl champs, and they saw fit to make 
the safety play corner, and who are the Chargers to argue? 
</P>
<P>
While with the 49ers, that left the upstart corner trying to follow Jerry Rice. 
Thanks for the memories, Anthony. "He made me look bad some days, but he's made 
everybody look bad," Shelton said. "Once you stay with him a couple of times, 
it builds up your confidence. Once you know you can guard him, you feel like 
you can guard anybody in the league." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No. 24 
</P>
<P>
If he were any quieter, Lester Lyles would be declared a statue. 
</P>
<P>
He played in approximately 35 of the team's 51 defensive plays at Seattle, 
while also contributing on each of their special teams. And how many people 
knew he made the trip? 
</P>
<P>
"I always make the joke they are saving my legs to a certain degree and I'm not 
getting beat up as much if I were playing more," Lyles said. "I'm basically a 
role player wherever they want to roll me." 
</P>
<P>
He was a 220-pound linebacker at Virginia when the Jets took him in the second 
round of the 1985 draft. He started 14 of 16 games at strong safety for the 
Jets in his second season, but his career took a nose dive in 1987 as a result 
of the NFL strike. 
</P>
<P>
"I got labeled a militant of sorts," Lyles said. "I said one thing in a 
players' meeting, and it should have stayed in a players' meeting, but some 
individuals went to the head coach and said their piece." 
</P>
<P>
Lyles was released by the Jets in 1988 and signed with the Cardinals. Left 
unprotected in 1989, he was signed as a Plan B free agent. He has started three 
games this season, including the last two for the injured Martin Bayless, "and 
you'll notice," secondary coach Jim Mora said, "there hasn't been much of a 
dropoff." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No. 28 
</P>
<P>
He's done more traveling than some pilots. Let's see, Donnie Elder has played 
for the Jets, the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Detroit Lions, the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers and now the Chargers. Bad breath or bad breaks? 
</P>
<P>
"He's really helped us," Mora said. "He's given us that spark on special teams 
and we're using him in third-down situations on defense." 
</P>
<P>
Nicknamed "Bump," for aggressive play on receivers, Elder has played in 59 NFL 
games after being a third-round draft pick of the Jets in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"I was up in the coaches' box during the Houston game, and we got a couple of 
guys hurt," Devaney said. "We got on the phone and started looking for Donnie." 
</P>
<P>
They found him. And he's already grabbed an interception for the Chargers, and 
has averaged 22.3 yards a kickoff return. He led the NFC in kickoff returns 
with a 22.7-yard average in 1988, and so how come he's always moving? 
</P>
<P>
"He's a good guy; you get a guy into the season like that, and that's rare," 
Mora said. "I don't know, maybe he didn't make the right first impression in 
some places. All I know is that since the day he's gotten here, he's been 
impressive."

Holyfield had just decked Douglas, and Terry Orr was shooting pool with former 
Redskins' teammates in Washington at the home of wide receiver Ricky Sanders. 
And the phone rang. It was Redskins' tight end Don Warren, and he was helping 
out his old buddies, who are now working in the front office for the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was about 11 o'clock back east when we found him," Devaney said. "Joe 
Caravello had gone down with a knee injury that day, and so we told Terry there 
was a prepaid plane ticket waiting for him at the airport for a 5:45 a.m. 
flight." 
</P>
<P>
One day out of work, the next a professional football player. 
</P>
<P>
While in college, he played for Texas as a running back and gained 1,279 yards 
in 274 carries and then was taken in the 10th round by the Redskins. A Bobby 
Beathard special. "Bobby worked me out at Texas and told me I'd be moved to 
H-back if they took me," Orr said. "And the third day of mini-camp I was 
switched to H-back, and he was right." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it's not who you are, but who you know, what you do, and how well 
you do it. 
</P>
<P>
"When (the Redskins) went to the Super Bowl in 1982, we went with 26 free 
agents on our roster. A lot of guys nobody had heard of then," Beathard said. 
"We had no draft choices and lots of open jobs, so we brought a lot of people 
in. 
</P>
<P>
"But if you don't have the right coaches, like the Joe Bugels and the Alex 
Gibbs of the world, then all those free agents don't end up doing anything. It 
takes good coaches and good people together -- then who knows what might 
happen."

ROBINSON NEEDS MIRACLE TO WIN GT TITLE 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The bottom line is Chip Robinson must win. There's no way around it, just as 
there is no easy way around the 1.62-mile road racing course at the Del Mar 
Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson and the International Motor Sports Assn. have come to where the turf 
meets the surf for the fourth Camel Grand Prix of Greater San Diego, the last 
stop on the 15-city tour. 
</P>
<P>
To win the title, Robinson, who trails Nissan teammate Geoff Brabham, must win 
his third Grand Touring Prototype race of the year and Brabham, the two-time 
defending GT champion and winner of five races this season, must finish out of 
the top 10. A race victory is worth 20 points and Robinson, the 1987 GT 
champion, trails by 19, 188-169. They are the only two who can win the 
championship for the turbo-charged GTPs. 
</P>
<P>
"(The GT championship) means a tremendous amount to me and my career," Robinson 
said. "I can't begin to say how much. Geoff has won the championship for two 
years for Nissan. I think the momentum has been with him, and for me to win 
would be a pretty dramatic upset." 
</P>
<P>
He paused, then said, "I'd like that." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, 36, has won twice this season, at Watkins Glen, N.Y., and Miami, and 
finished second six times. 
</P>
<P>
But Sunday, in the 1 hour, 45 minute feature race that begins at 2:05 p.m., 
second place won't be good enough. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very competitive series and the only thing you can do is go out and 
run hard the whole day," Robinson said. "There are some great drivers out here 
-- my teammate Geoff, Juan Manuel Fangio II, Davy Jones -- you can't give those 
guys an inch. You give up a little bit and it's so hard to get it back." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Brabham, Fangio and Jones, the race features GT Series non-regulars 
John Andretti, Martin Brundle and Al Unser Jr., who is coming off six Indy-car 
victories this season and competing at Del Mar for the first time. Unser 
figures to make his presence known to Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Though Unser will make it interesting, much attention will be directed toward 
Robinson, Brabham and the quest for the $150,000 that goes to the GT 
championship winner. 
</P>
<P>
For the second year in a row, they have won the manufacturer's championship for 
Kas Kastner's Nissan team. And for the second year in a row, they are running 
one-two entering the season finale. Last year, Robinson led Brabham by four 
points, 219-215, but broke a driveshaft on the 59th lap and finished 17th. 
Brabham finished second and took the money. 
</P>
<P>
But Robinson's chances of returning the favor are practically nil. It would 
take a virtual miracle. And he knows it. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to be this brazen about it, and in a lot of ways I feel like it is, but 
it's a little like the U.S. hockey team beating the Russians in the Olympics," 
Robinson said. "Whoever thought that that would happen?" 
</P>
<P>
Not Brabham, whose worst finish this year is fifth. 
</P>
<P>
"The odds are in my favor, there's no question about it," Brabham said. "That's 
the way I like it, too." 
</P>
<P>
Brabham, 38, said the Chevrolet-powered Spices are better suited to the race, 
and it will be tough for either member of the Nissan team to reach Victory 
Lane. 
</P>
<P>
"But," he said, "(Robinson) will throw caution to the wind and try to win. I'm 
glad I'm not in that position and glad that he is." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't have to be that way. 
</P>
<P>
Had IMSA scored its races this season the way it will in 1991 -- with the 
driver who starts the race being the only one who can earn GT championship 
points -- Brabham might be chasing Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
At the season's sixth race, the Camel Grand Prix of the Heartland in Topeka, 
Kan., Nissan unveiled its 1990 GTP, the NPT-90, and handed it over to Brabham 
and teammate Derek Daly to get it up to racing specifications. The plan called 
for Daly to begin the races with Brabham relieving. But, whenever the new 
prototype experienced problems with Daly driving, Nissan put Brabham in 
Robinson's car, a durable 1988 prototype, the GTP-88, so both Brabham and 
Robinson could earn points. 
</P>
<P>
Twice that happened, at Topeka, where Robinson and Brabham each earned 15 
points for second place, and at Lime Rock, Conn., where they both earned 12 
points for third. At Miami in February, before Nissan debuted its new 
prototype, Brabham co-drove with Robinson and they won, each earning 20 points. 
The other GTP-88, with Daly, finished 10th. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the insurance policy," Brabham said. "If I was going to be scheduled 
to ride the new car, I wasn't going to start. If you start a car and it doesn't 
finish, you don't get the points. That's why I never started. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question Chip has had a better run from a mechanical point of view. 
I've had quite a few little problems." 
</P>
<P>
Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Electrical problems at Watkins Glen, where the NPT-90 was not raced. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Throttle and oil cooler problems at Portland in July, when it did not 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Split an intercooler near the end of the race in San Antonio, but finished 
third. 
</P>
<P>
The only way Brabham won't crack the top 10 is if his ride breaks down. It's 
happened in the past. But can it happen again? 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely," Robinson said. "Absolutely. No doubt about it. No doubt about it. 
I'm real confident that way. My car has been very reliable and I have all the 
faith in the world in my crew guys. 
</P>
<P>
"You hate to say it, but (a breakdown) is what it's going to take for me to win 
the championship." 
</P>
<P>
Brabham: "The problem race-car drivers have is that a lot of things happen that 
are totally out of their control. If my car broke, there's nothing I can do 
about that. You don't hear about Ivan Lendl not winning Wimbledon because the 
strings of his racket broke. If that happens, it just happens." 
</P>
<P>
Brabham will be careful not to push his GTP too much, though. To wrap up the GT 
championship in Tampa, all he needed to do was finish one spot behind Robinson. 
Instead, he tried to win the race. During a squall with about 10 laps to go, 
his aggressiveness cost him. He hit a fence, went from first place to fifth and 
Robinson moved from fifth to second. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be less aggressive than Chip will be," said Brabham, who must 
complete 70% of the race to score points. "I imagine he'll be going for it. 
I'll hang close until I feel safe and score my points, then mount a late-race 
charge. I must go into this race thinking the championship is No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
Auto Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Chip Robinson was the pole-sitter at Del Mar in 1987, when he drove Al 
Holbert's Porsche 962, but completed only 10 laps and finished 23rd. In 1988, a 
few weeks after Holbert's death in an airplane crash, Robinson did not compete 
at Del Mar out of respect for the five-time GT champion and all-time race 
winner. Last year, with the four-point lead over Geoff Brabham, a broken 
driveshaft stuck him in 17th place and cost him the GT championship. . . . Some 
of the drivers participated in a local bowling tournament Thursday to raise 
funds for the local Big Brothers/Big Sisters chapter. Chip Robinson is a 
national spokesman . . . The GT championship is the only one that hasn't been 
decided. Tomas Lopez, in a Buick Spice, has already secured the Camel Lights

DAVE DISTEL: MCGWIRE SHOULD BE A BIG DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not that he would be inclined to the contrary, but Dan McGwire better stay on 
the straight and narrow. 
</P>
<P>
He would never last if he took to a life of knocking over banks or liquor 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, officer," the victim would explain, "the guy had red hair, freckles and 
a strong, athletic build. Oh yes, and he stood about 6-8." 
</P>
<P>
Where would a person like that hide? 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, McGwire has a place. He can put on his San Diego State football 
uniform, go out to San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium on game nights and know there 
won't be many witnesses. Jimmy Hoffa may be in the stands in Mission Valley, 
rather than buried under the end zone at the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
Who would know it? 
</P>
<P>
Of all the numbers SDSU football has put on the board this fall, the most 
perplexing may be 19,179 and 19,704 and 25,504. Those were attendance figures 
for the first three home games. The fourth comes Saturday night against Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire, having started his career at the University of Iowa, was not 
accustomed to such apathy. 
</P>
<P>
"People come from all four corners of the state to see the Iowa Hawkeyes," he 
said. "Here, I guess there are so many side distractions. But what else is 
there to do on Saturday night at 7 o'clock? Movies? I'm baffled." 
</P>
<P>
McGwire is a guy worth watching. Forget the trivial stuff, like he is the 
tallest quarterback in college football history. Consider instead that he 
triggers an offense ranked fourth in the nation in both scoring and passing. 
</P>
<P>
A quarterback like that in an offense like that should be enough to turn a 
community upside down with excitement. Put a passer like this in a place such 
as Knoxville or Baton Rouge or South Bend and there wouldn't be a person within 
100 miles who didn't know how many freckles he had on his right arm. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, McGwire is ranked third in the nation in passing efficiency and two of 
his receivers, Patrick Rowe and Dennis Arey, rank first and sixth, 
respectively, in yards per game. These guys can move the football. 
</P>
<P>
And yet . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Dan and Patrick are almost better known outside of San Diego than they are in 
San Diego," said John Rosenthal, SDSU's sports information director. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire, in fact, may be the best quarterback in town, though Mark Vlasic's 
supporters might disagree. McGwire figures to be a first-round choice in the 
1991 draft, and his name has popped up among contenders for the Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
There is no way, of course, that Dan McGwire is going to win the Heisman 
Trophy. SDSU will never have such an animal as long as it persists in playing 
night games, which are reported a day late and many details short in most of 
the nation. It would help, too, to have a winning record and a bit of 
television exposure, but the starting times damage the latter as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sort of the quiet guy out West," he said. "Ty Detmer (BYU) and Shawn Moore 
(Virginia) have gotten the national exposure. They've had more press and TV 
time. I'm just honored to be part of that group." 
</P>
<P>
Even as a part of that group, generically known as Heisman hopefuls, he has had 
to cope in a pleasant way with another shadow. He was on the cover of one 
national publication because (a) he is exceptionally talented and (b) the other 
person on the cover was his brother Mark, one of the Oakland Athletics' stars. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll always be the little brother of Mark McGwire," he laughed, "but I'm 
starting to earn my own identity." 
</P>
<P>
Part of his identity problem, if you can call it that, has more to do with the 
team than with him. SDSU has a 3-4 record, mainly because the offense has 
scored 34, 51 and 31 points in losing causes. 
</P>
<P>
The crusher was the 52-51 loss to Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
"If we would have beaten them," McGwire said, "we'd be in a good situation as 
far as a bowl bid." 
</P>
<P>
In truth, the Aztecs might still be marginal. Even if the record was 5-2 
instead of 3-4, bowls always take community support into consideration, and 
SDSU football has precious little. 
</P>
<P>
Reality is that the Aztecs have four games remaining, three at home. Maybe they 
can do something in the next three weeks, like win three in a row, to awaken 
the sleeping multitudes for Miami's Dec. 1 visit. 
</P>
<P>
"That," said McGwire, "will be our bowl game. We should be on a high for that 
game. Personally, it will be my bowl game." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that game will get San Diegans out of the theaters, or wherever they 
spend their Saturday nights, and out to the stadium. Anyone who does not like 
the Chargers' 1990 offense can see what looks an awful lot like the Chargers' 
1980 offense when this Dan and these Aztecs are playing. 
</P>
<P>
It will be a shame, of course, if it takes the community until the last game of 
Dan McGwire's SDSU career to get out and take a look at what he can do with a 
football. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe then, Dan McGwire won't walk into a convenience store and have someone 
say: "Gee, you must be a basketball player." 
</P>
<P>
Giggle giggle.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTES / IRENE GARCIA; 
</P>
<P>
EL CAMINO RUNNER IS ON THE RIGHT TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sharette Garcia has proven to be one of the most versatile runners ever at El 
Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
After breaking several school track records, the sophomore from Belize started 
running cross-country last fall in order to improve her track performances. She 
got the idea after placing second in the 1,500 meters at the state meet as a 
freshman. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of that race suggested that Garcia compete in long distances to get 
in better shape. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia took her competitor's advice, although she didn't join the Warriors' 
cross-country team until the end of the 1989 season. But despite the lack of 
distance training, she finished in the top 20 at the state meet, the Southern 
California Championships and the South Coast Conference meet. 
</P>
<P>
This year she has finished in the top two in every race. On Oct. 27, Garcia led 
the Warriors to the SCC title with a first-place finish in a field of 45. She 
ran the 3.1-mile course at La Mirada Park in 17:37. Shortly after that she was 
named the SCC co-athlete of the year along with teammate Diana Tracy and Mt. 
San Antonio's Karen Talamantes. 
</P>
<P>
"She has improved steadily throughout the season," El Camino cross-country 
Coach Dean Lofgren said. "She's a definite lead pack runner. I can't say enough 
about her talent." 
</P>
<P>
The petite athlete from Manual Arts High is expected to lead the Warriors at 
the Southern California Championships today at 2 p.m. at Irvine Regional Park. 
The field will include the top 14 teams from Southern California. The top five 
teams in today's event will qualify for the state meet Nov. 17 at Mt. SAC. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia is going for her sixth state championship. In her two-year community 
college track career, she has won two 800-meter state titles, a 1,500-meter 
title and has been on two state champion mile relay teams. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino strong safety Donovan Gallatin, who suffered a concussion in a game 
against Fullerton Oct. 13, has come back strong. 
</P>
<P>
The freshman from El Segundo High returned to action in the second quarter of 
the Oct. 27 game against Pasadena after sitting out the Oct. 20 game against 
Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
"When something like that happens, you always wonder when the kid comes back 
and takes his next shot what it will be like," El Camino defensive coordinator 
Walt Justice said. "But he came back with the same intensity." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-1, 195-pound Gallatin has earned Mission Conference honors two weeks 
in a row. In El Camino's 39-29 victory over Pasadena, Gallatin had 13 tackles 
(10 unassisted) and a fumble recovery. In last week's 40-21 victory over Mt. 
SAC, he had 10 tackles (six unassisted), two pass deflections and an 
interception that he returned for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"He's unique because he has exceptional strength and speed," Justice said. "We 
haven't had a kid around here with that kind of size and speed." 
</P>
<P>
Since John Featherstone took over El Camino's football program six years ago, 
the Warriors have been known for their passing offense. At the start of this 
season, however, Featherstone knew there would be more running since the 
inexperienced and untested Rod Harvey would be the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
In comes Anthony Daigle, a redshirt freshman from Arizona State who came to El 
Camino with his friend Bryan Reeves, a Carson High graduate. Reeves was a 
redshirt wide receiver at Arizona State last year who was unhappy with the 
program. Tailback Daigle was a walk-on from St. Patrick High in Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that the 6-foot-1, 195-pound Daigle was what the El Camino offense 
needed. He is second to Rancho Santiago's Estrus Crayton in Mission Conference 
rushing (117.7 yards a game) and is tied with Crayton with 16 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"He's had a tremendous year for us and he's been a great part of our team," 
Featherstone said. "Anthony has great feet and a great feel. All he needs is a 
crease and he can get through the hole. He's a magician and he's been fun to 
watch." 
</P>
<P>
Last week Daigle became the first player to rush for more than 1,000 yards in 
Featherstone's tenure at El Camino. He was named Mission Conference player of 
the week for gaining 135 yards on 25 carries and scoring three touchdowns (one 
on a pass reception) in the Warriors' 40-21 victory over Mt. SAC. 
</P>
<P>
"Plus he's an excellent receiver," Featherstone said. What more can a coach ask 
for? 
</P>
<P>
Louis Perez has made quite a comeback in the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino's reliable kicker struggled with field goals through most of the 
season, but lately he has been on a roll. The sophomore from Carson High has 
hit all of his field goal and extra point attempts in the past two games. In 
last week's victory over Mt. SAC, he made field goals of 41 and 33 yards. Two 
weeks ago against Pasadena, he kicked a 42-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
That improved his season extra-point total to 36 of 38 and his field-goal total 
to eight of 11. Featherstone said there's one simple reason for the 
improvement: "He quit playing soccer. Now his foot isn't as tired." 
</P>
<P>
Perez was also a part-time player for El Camino's soccer team last season and 
most of this season.

SNAFU IN SOCCER LEAGUE SCHEDULING DELAYS HEAT DECISION ON HOME FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The process of selecting a home field for the Los Angeles Heat was dealt a 
major setback Thursday when an official of the American Professional Soccer 
League West said that the league's playing schedule would not be completed for 
at least two months. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week Heat General Manager Dick White said that he will not 
announce where the team will play next year until the league schedule is 
completed. But he also said he wanted a league meeting later this month to 
finish the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for Bill Sage, APSL West chairman, said that the league schedule 
would not be finished until "shortly after the first of the year." 
</P>
<P>
As for a meeting later this month, White may not get it. According to Donn 
Rissolo, APSL West publicist, "It is still to be decided if we have a meeting 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
The Heat is considering Murdock Stadium at El Camino College in Torrance or 
Veterans Stadium in Long Beach as home fields. 
</P>
<P>
"Why go talk (to either facility we are considering) when I can't tell them 
when or how many games we will need to play there," White said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week White supplied the league with a list of possible home dates, along 
with the team's $6,000 entry fee. Ironically, some officials from other teams 
appear to be waiting to see where the Heat chooses to play before agreeing to 
play the league's 1991 schedule. Last season the Heat played at West Torrance 
High, which league officials and team owners have said is too small. 
</P>
<P>
Heat owners appear to favor a move to Veterans Stadium, which has a license to 
sell beer and is less expensive to rent than Murdock Stadium. White has said 
he'd like to keep the team in the South Bay at El Camino. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation that the Heat will play a few games at each site are unfounded, 
White said. Bobby Sibbald, White's choice to remain as the team's coach despite 
some opposition by owners, said he would support such a plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Dick it's a good idea to play a few games at each place," he said. "If 
you ask the players, they'll tell you they loved playing at Long Beach." 
</P>
<P>
The Heat drew an announced crowd of 3,500 at Veterans Stadium in September for 
its leg of the APSL West championship series against the San Francisco Bay 
Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
APSL West franchises in Phoenix and Portland folded and another pair (Santa 
Barbara and San Diego) are contemplating moving. That has further complicated 
the scheduling process. The league season has reportedly been pushed back from 
April to May and will run until mid-October, although White could not confirm 
that report. 
</P>
<P>
White said pushing the schedule into October would cause scheduling problems at 
facilities where American football games are played. White said that in 
September there are two scheduling conflicts with Long Beach City College and 
one with Cal State Long Beach at Veterans Stadium. At Murdock Stadium there 
would be a single conflict with an El Camino football game.

HE TRADED ORANGES FOR ROSES; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: FORMER BANNING HIGH STANDOUT TYRONE RODGERS WENT TO OKLAHOMA 
TO PLAY IN THE ORANGE BOWL, BUT TRANSFERRED TO WASHINGTON AFTER THE SOONERS 
WERE PLACED ON PROBATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY JONES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Overcoming obstacles is familiar to University of Washington nose tackle Tyrone 
Rodgers, even if it means trading in a longtime dream for a new experience. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers is in his first year with the Huskies after transferring from Oklahoma. 
The former Banning High standout backs up senior John Cook on a unit that is 
ranked first in the nation in rushing defense, allowing 65.7 yards per game. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers' contributions -- 14 tackles, two fumble recoveries and two sacks -- 
have helped Washington earn its first Pacific 10 Conference title and Rose Bowl 
berth since the 1981 season. The Huskies (8-1 overall and 6-1 in conference 
play) are ranked second nationally and have a shot at the national title. They 
play host to UCLA (4-5, 3-3) on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers, a 6-foot-3, 265-pound junior, underwent surgery on his left knee last 
spring after being injured in a full-contact scrimmage. But he made it back, 
clearing several hurdles along the way. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from Banning, everything appeared in order. Rodgers wanted to 
attend college outside the Los Angeles area, so after narrowing his choices to 
Arizona State, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Louisiana State and Washington, he selected 
the Sooners. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, I liked Oklahoma's football program," he said. "The Sooners were 
known for a winning tradition. Washington was second on my list, but the 
thought of playing in the Orange Bowl was probably the main reason I chose 
Oklahoma." 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers appeared in 12 games as an Oklahoma reserve in 1988, including the 
Citrus Bowl loss to Clemson. He had eight tackles during the season and six in 
the Citrus Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers was looking forward to getting more playing time in the 1989 season, 
but the NCAA sentenced the Sooner football program to three years' probation 
for several violations. 
</P>
<P>
"(The probation) was hard to deal with," Rodgers said. "For three years, we 
wouldn't be playing in any bowl games. I wanted my family to see me play in the 
Orange Bowl, because I felt that we would have made it." 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers had a decision to make: Would he remain at Oklahoma, or transfer and 
have to sit out the season? It turned out to be his final year at Norman. 
</P>
<P>
"After (the NCAA's decision), I had second thoughts about staying at Oklahoma," 
Rodgers said. "Besides, Norman is a lot slower than L.A. I felt it wasn't my 
kind of town. Washington was the next school on my list of choices, so I 
decided to transfer there. It rains a lot, especially during the (football) 
season, but there are more fun things to do here than in Norman." 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers' move to Seattle went smoothly. He joined former Banning teammate 
Terrance Powe, a reserve defensive lineman. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was unable to play during his first year at Washington, Rodgers 
practiced with the team. 
</P>
<P>
He was ready to challenge for a starting position at nose tackle, but an injury 
to his left knee forced him to the sideline and back to the waiting game. 
</P>
<P>
"It was frustrating," he said. "I was ready for spring practice. . . I wanted 
to make a big impact on the team. I felt I had a good chance of playing 
regularly, but I was back to where I was nearly a year before. I didn't want to 
quit, though." 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Rodgers spent most of the time rehabilitating his knee. In late 
August, he was listed No. 2 on the depth chart behind Cook, a position he has 
held throughout the season. 
</P>
<P>
"He's making progress each week," Washington defensive line coach Randy Hart 
said. "He's an excellent football player. He's very physical against bigger 
offensive linemen, but he relies on quickness and finesse. I'm glad he's here." 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers' knee passed its first test in Washington's home opener against San 
Jose State. He played 25 downs. 
</P>
<P>
"It feels great to be back on the field," he said. "I guess my patience 
eventually paid off." 
</P>
<P>
All it took was an exchange of goals: Out with the oranges and in with the 
roses.

RIVALRY: AFTER COOLING THEIR HEELS FOR TWO YEARS, NOTRE DAME AND CRESPI ARE SET 
TO MEET AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A statue of Mary, mother of Jesus, was defaced at Notre Dame High. A year 
later, some highly unflattering words about Notre Dame were burned into the 
school's lawn and caused quite a stir among the school's clergy. 
</P>
<P>
The same year, a pickup truck allegedly occupied by Notre Dame students roared 
past the Crespi parking lot and unloaded an arsenal of water balloons onto a 
group of previously dry Crespi students. 
</P>
<P>
And very shortly after that, late in 1987, one of the Valley's most intense and 
stirring football rivalries came to a sudden halt. A game that annually 
attracted as many as 5,000 fans was no more. 
</P>
<P>
"Athletics are not that important that we act toward each other like we're not 
even Christians," proclaimed Sister Christopher Miller, a former Notre Dame 
vice principal. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that the fairly regular practice in football of trying to separate a 
ballcarrier from his head doesn't seem to be condoned anywhere in the Bible, 
either. But Miller had a point to make, a point with which any decent person 
would agree. 
</P>
<P>
Defacing a religious statue is an ignorant and hateful act, any time, any 
place. 
</P>
<P>
And anyone who chars obscenities into someone's lawn is likely lugging around 
the IQ of a pine tree. 
</P>
<P>
As for water balloons . . . well, water balloons are always funny. 
</P>
<P>
No one died because of the rivalry, and no one was injured, either. 
</P>
<P>
But the relationship with Crespi, Notre Dame decided, was a bad one. Notre Dame 
called for a two-year "cooling-off" period and jumped from the Del Rey League 
to the San Fernando Valley League, apparently to get away from the Celts. 
</P>
<P>
The cooling-off period has ended. Tonight, inside a Pierce College stadium that 
is expected to rock with 5,000 or more fans, the two most prominent Catholic 
schools in the Valley will bang helmets once again. Crespi leads the series, 
11-4, and won the most recent meeting, 54-14, in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Both schools returned to the Mission League this year and at stake tonight is 
the league championship. Notre Dame is 6-2-1 overall, 4-0-1 in league play, and 
can clinch at least a tie for the title with a victory. Crespi is 7-2, 4-1 and 
has a shot at the crown if it wins and St. Paul is beaten. 
</P>
<P>
But just knocking Notre Dame out of a chance for the title might give the Celts 
enough satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if two years of cooling off was long enough. I don't know if 20 
years would be long enough," said Rich Lawson, a former Notre Dame player and 
coach who is now the head coach at Chaminade. "I don't know that any 
cooling-off period was appropriate. There would seem to be other ways of 
handling the extracurricular problems than shelving the whole rivalry. The 
administration should be able to deal with those things." 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade Athletic Director Bernie Kyman, a longtime observer of sports in the 
Valley, has a similar opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that any games that create large fan support are good," he said. 
"The administration then has the responsibility of controlling any problems. 
There will be more than 5,000 fans at this game, and that has to be good for 
everyone." 
</P>
<P>
At Notre Dame, the principal seemed to be feeling a bit of pressure as the game 
approached. 
</P>
<P>
"I was misquoted badly two years ago and am really shy about saying anything," 
Brother Stephen Walsh said. "Let's leave it like this: I would rather make no 
comment about any of this. 
</P>
<P>
"However, I feel very comfortable with playing football against Crespi and look 
forward to this game and being in the same league again. I have a lot of 
respect for Crespi High School, and I am not interested in going over all the 
past problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody was fine and pure in all of our past problems. But to go back over the 
whole thing, I just won't do that." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Notre Dame athletic director and football Coach Kevin Rooney was 
forced to walk an awkward line when his school's administration made its 
no-Crespi decree. 
</P>
<P>
"As the football coach, I am disappointed," he said at the time. "We like to 
play local teams and it's a rivalry. We compete well with Crespi. This is an 
administrative decision." 
</P>
<P>
This week, he is still walking that awkward line. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad we have the opportunity to play them again," he said. "It will be 
fun. But I don't want to stir up any controversy over the decision to have the 
cooling-off period. And I haven't talked to my players about the rivalry aspect 
of the game. There is no need. Everybody here knows about the Crespi-Notre Dame 
rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we all understand that the rivalry needs to be kept in perspective. 
It's a football game, and we want to make sure it's just that and not anything 
more." 
</P>
<P>
At Crespi, there always has been the feeling that the Notre Dame-initiated lull 
was a case of blowing things out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still not sure what Notre Dame wanted to accomplish with the two-year 
layoff," Crespi Athletic Director Paul Muff said. "We felt that things really 
weren't that bad. I felt the rivalry had reached a good point. 
</P>
<P>
"Our coaching staff knows the Notre Dame coaching staff very well and we all 
have a tremendous amount of respect for Kevin Rooney, and we always felt we 
could work things out. In my 15 years here, I always felt the rivalry brought 
out the best in both teams, in all sports." 
</P>
<P>
Muff said the faculty at Crespi has reminded the students this week of the need 
for proper behavior at the football game. Just like the school administration 
does before every football game. 
</P>
<P>
"We purposely did not want to single this game out as anything different," Muff 
said. "There are many students here now who have never been to a Crespi-Notre 
Dame game. But it's such a natural rivalry. The kids from the two schools know 
each other from grammar school and the faculty and alumni know each other so 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to have the rivalry back. I'm just hoping that some semblance of the 
rivalry that we used to have comes back."

DONATELLI FINISHES WHAT SAPERGIA STARTS AS GULLS TOP KANSAS CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A tap dance might be appropriate, but leave the heavy combat boots at home. 
This was more Fred and Ginger than Rambo. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls (7-7-2) tickled and teased 3,647 fans Thursday night before winning 
their third home game of the season, a 6-3 International Hockey League victory 
over last-place Kansas City (2-12-0) at the San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Sapergia, the driver of the Gulls sometimes mean, sometimes lean -- 
always unpredictable -- scoring machine, scored twice early and set the tone as 
the Gulls jumped to a 4-2 lead after two periods. 
</P>
<P>
But Kansas City reeled in the Gulls and controlled much of the third period, 
before a breakaway goal from center ice by Clark Donatelli sent a collective 
sigh of relief through the crowd and gave the Gulls a 5-3 lead at 13:15 in the 
third. 
</P>
<P>
"We stopped skating in the third," Gulls Coach Mike O'Connell said. "We were 
lucky to get that goal by Donatelli. We have to come out (tonight, when the 
Gulls gain play Kansas City) and skate a lot better than we did (Thursday), or 
we'll be in a lot of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls started the third with a 4-2 lead, but Scott White scored at 5:24 
pull Kansas City within one. 
</P>
<P>
Goaltender Glen Halon kept a seemingly inevitable tying goal out of the net 
when he stopped Kansas City's Mike Hiltner on a breakaway at 11:45. 
</P>
<P>
Donatelli, who hadn't been heard from since his second two-goal game Oct. 26 
against Salt Lake, gave the Gulls a 3-1 lead on the power play at 7:24 in the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls were 0-for-3 on the power play before Donatelli scored from the left 
wing on a two-on-one perfect pass from Steve Martinson. Donatelli sent the to 
the top corner of the net, giving him his third two-goal game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Martinson chalked up his second assist of the night, his fifth in the last two 
games, on a bizarre play, courtesy of Donatelli. 
</P>
<P>
From the right circle, Donatelli passed to Martinson, who waited in the left 
wing, only to have his shot deflected. It ended up on the stick of teammate 
Darcy Norton, who scored from the slot at 15:31, making it 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Two minutes later, with the Gulls' Taylor Hall on the bench for a slashing 
penalty, Jeff Jablonski scored his second goal on the night to pull Kansas City 
to 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
"We were sluggish," said Sapergia, who now has 13 goals for the season. "I've 
never seen a team like this. We're terrible at home, and great on the road. I 
don't know, we just didn't have that killer instinct." 
</P>
<P>
Jablonski gave Kansas City the early 1-0 advantage, scoring 1:54 into the game 
from outside the left wing, on a delayed penalty against the Gulls. 
</P>
<P>
Something about playing catch-up has this strange appeal to the Gulls, who are 
the worst in the league in first goals allowed. They own the IHL record, with 
13 allowed in 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
After that was out of their system, Sapergia came in and scored the Gulls' 
first two goals, the first at 3:33 on a breakaway from the slot and the second 
at 7:20. A muffed attempt from the right wing made its way to Larry Floyd, who 
passed from the left circle, who tapped in the goal for the 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City pulled its goalie with 33 seconds remaining, and Martinson scored 
on a slapshot from the left point with 23 seconds left to make it 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Gulls Notes 
</P>
<P>
There in spirit: Charlie Simmer, the Gulls' left wing/assistant coach, was 
unable to attend the retiring of former Los Angeles King teammate Marcel 
Dionne's number Thursday night at The Forum, but he did attend a dinner 
Wednesday night to honor Dionne, who along with Simmer and Dave Taylor, made up 
the famous "Triple Crown Line," of the early 1980s. . . . Double good: Kansas 
City's Jeff Jablonski, who scored the Golden Blades' first goal Thursday, has a 
twin brother, Pat, in the IHL. Pat is league-leading Peoria's No. 2 goaltender. 
. . . The road can be lonely, as Kansas City is finding out. Entering 
Thursday's game, the Blades were winless on the road (0-4) and are only three 
games into a 10-game trip. . . . Goalie Mark Reimer, who is the property of 
Detroit, was loaned to Adirondack Thursday, the Red Wings' top farm team. 
Reimer, 23, was 3-2-1 and had a 4.28 goals-against average this season. The 
Gulls have two goalies on their roster: Glen Hanlon and Scott Brower. . . . 
Promotions: The first 2,500 fans to arrive at tonight's game will receive 
souvenir keychains.

VON BULOW CASE: HEARTS OF DARKNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Claus von Bulow stinks!" a furious young law student explodes, near the 
opening of the seductively entertaining "Reversal of Fortune" (throughout San 
Diego County.) "He's obviously guilty of something pretty despicable, and if we 
free him, we become partners in his crime." 
</P>
<P>
Audiences for whom the name Von Bulow and his still-comatose wife, Sunny, have 
any meaning at all may go into the film agreeing completely. Only a few other 
men, Donald Trump perhaps or Idi Amin, have courted bad press with such 
singular avidity. During Von Bulow's appeal -- to reverse his previous 
conviction on charges of assault with intent to murder his wife by injections 
of insulin -- he and his current girlfriend posed smirkingly for Helmut Newton 
in biker's leathers: the aristocrat as sadomasochistic stud. 
</P>
<P>
As his defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz clarifies succinctly for the movie's Von 
Bulow, "You got one thing in your favor . . . everybody hates you." 
</P>
<P>
All this is background to why the brilliant "Reversal of Fortune" becomes such 
a complete reversal of expectation. Screenwriter Nicholas Kazan, director 
Barbet Schroeder ("Barfly") and, especially, Jeremy Irons -- in a glittering 
performance as the divinely decadent Dane -- have chosen to treat this social 
death spiral as a tragicomedy of manners. It's an inspired tone. 
</P>
<P>
By the film's end, Von Bulow may still be emotionally inaccessible, but the 
heart of the poisonous darkness in which he and Sunny co-existed has been laid 
bare. In the process Von Bulow, self-mocking but -- crucially -- self-knowing, 
has gone from a character of reptilian fascination to one it's even possible to 
be moved by, an emotion he would undoubtedly loathe. 
</P>
<P>
"Reversal of Fortune" has three points of view and two playing teams, each 
jaw-droppingly exotic to the other. On the one side, Von Bulow and the 
unimaginable richness and peculiarity of life at Clarendon Court, his wife's 
Newport "cottage." 
</P>
<P>
Captaining the lively home team is Alan Dershowitz (Ron Silver), Harvard Law 
School's scrappy, high-profile civil libertarian and defender of tricky cases 
from Death Row inmates to Patricia Hearst and Harry Reems. The flamboyant 
"Dersh's" reasons for taking Von Bulow's case are part of the film's complex 
underpinnings. 
</P>
<P>
As he meets Dershowitz, Von Bulow's inadvertently hilarious non sequitur about 
his deep respect for the intelligence and the integrity of the Jewish people 
raises the question that the case may also be the ultimate personal test for 
the lawyer himself. The joke between Dersh and his son Elon about defending 
Hitler is hardly in there by accident. 
</P>
<P>
The film's third, quite objective viewpoint is presented by Sunny herself, the 
icily splendid Glenn Close, narrating from her comatose state. From her 
floating nether world Sunny can muse about her beautiful life with Claus before 
the notoriety as evenhandedly as she can catalogue her own medical 
eccentricities: her consumption of Valium, Seconal, aspirin, alcohol, 
cigarettes, sweets, even the 24 laxatives she'd taken daily since she was 16. 
</P>
<P>
If such detached observations recall the opening of "Sunset Boulevard," spoken 
by its dead hero face-down in a swimming pool, it's not surprising. "Reversal 
of Fortune" is the most deeply sophisticated American-made film since Billy 
Wilder or Ernst Lubitsch were in the business of shaking up our screens. Its 
sophistication comes from what it accepts as a given: the Von Bulows' design 
for living, domestic arrangements that might have seemed decadent to the 
Hapsburgs. 
</P>
<P>
This unflappability about such things come from three sources: From the deeply 
European sensibilities of director Schroeder -- who not coincidentally once 
made a juicy documentary about Idi Amin; from Irons, who has more than once 
drawn the soul of some very odd ducks indeed, as in "Dead Ringers," and from 
the inordinately talented Kazan. 
</P>
<P>
As a writer, Kazan seems drawn to lives somewhat off the norm: his previous 
screenplays were "Patty Hearst," written originally as a comedy, and "At Close 
Range," about a pair of sons and their alluring, sociopathic father. 
</P>
<P>
Dershowitz creates a defense team, a cross-section of his most brilliant 
students and colleagues, who strain against a deadline to annihilate every 
point of the prosecution's case. The vague love interest between Dershowitz and 
a lawyer ex-love (Annabella Sciorra) is awful, but this legal detective work 
gives the film its lively motor. 
</P>
<P>
The performances of Close and Silver are flawless, but it is Irons' portrait 
that remains behind, an enigmatic after-image. Ashen-gray and whippet thin in 
his all-black costumes, his hair meticulously thinned, Irons is never unaware 
that there is a comic as well as a tragic view of these haute goings-on. As 
befits their arrangement, Von Bulow is an endlessly accommodating consort: when 
his wife chooses to sleep in near-freezing temperatures, he simply wears a knit 
watchcap to bed; Irons wears his with the air of an elegant terrorist. 
</P>
<P>
Irons' achievement is to suggest that there is steel as well as rot; that Von 
Bulow's tragedy was to be kept like a turtlenecked lapdog, whether or not he 
had fought to get the job. His Von Bulow, first with the street's sick jokes on 
himself, is a man on intimate terms with his own very dark soul -- even though 
he himself may flaunt it, it is nonetheless very, very real. 
</P>
<P>
Under Schroeder's direction the film may be morally ambiguous, but its 
performances and observations are absolutely on-target, from its most subtle 
gradations of art direction or costuming to Christine Baranski's hilarious turn 
as Von Bulow's "angel" girlfriend. "Reversal of Fortune" (rated R for no 
discernible reason) is a delectable tour through facets of the lives of the 
rich and famous that Robin Leach wouldn't touch with a forked stick.

KPFK TO BROADCAST SERIES OF MULTICULTURAL STAGE PLAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six of Los Angeles' most recent cultural stage plays will be broadcast in radio 
form over KPFK-FM (90.7) during the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a special series, the North Hollywood public radio station has 
brought in original cast members to perform before the microphone. Each play 
represents a different faction of Los Angeles' multicultural population. 
</P>
<P>
"The only problem was in selecting only six productions," said Sharon 
Rosewoman, an independent radio producer who worked on the series for KPFK. 
"There are many plays that are very good, but they are very visual and didn't 
translate to the ear. What I selected was based on content. The plays needed to 
be literate and have something important to say." 
</P>
<P>
Among the first broadcasts will be Alan Drury's "The Man Himself," a one-man 
production filled with the musings of a British working-class type. Ian Ruskin 
will reprise his Stages Trilingual Theatre role, which Times' reviewer T.H. 
McCulloh called "deliciously comic, heartbreakingly sympathetic." 
</P>
<P>
Other plays that have been recorded for broadcast include: 
</P>
<P>
* "Bricktop" -- the story of Prohibition jazz baby Ada Smith, a musical that 
was at the Inner City Cultural Center in August and follows the life and times 
of black entertainers of that era. 
</P>
<P>
* "The Mission of Mother Jones" -- a one-woman drama, starring Deborah Marsh, 
about the Irish woman who organized miners in Pennsylvania and West Virginia at 
the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
* A 30-minute monologue by Manazar Gamboa from Daniel Martinez' "Ignore the 
Dents," which he describes as a micro urban opera Times' music critic Martin 
Bernheimer wrote that this "communal sociopolitico-musico-theatrical 
extravaganza" suffered from "much noise, little harmony." 
</P>
<P>
The KPFK series is also scheduled to include productions of Luis Valdez' 
"Soldado Razo," which was at the Japan America Theater last summer, and Dan 
Seymour's Burbage Theater production of "A-Bomb Beauties," based on the true 
story of 25 Japanese women who were disfigured by the bombing of Hiroshima and 
later brought to the United States by a group of philanthropists to undergo 
reconstructive surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the plays were slightly rewritten for radio. The project was funded by 
a Los Angeles Cultural Affairs grant.

Vietnam is leaving Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
Indian Dunes, the popular 200-acre movie and television location just north of 
Six Flags Magic Mountain, will turn from filming into farming by the end of the 
year. From stargazing to cattle grazing. From sets for "China Beach" and "Call 
to Glory" to land for barley and broccoli. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Rawlins, director of the California Film Commission, has already fielded 
complaints from numerous production companies who had hoped to film at the site 
-- two miles west of the Golden State Freeway and east of California 126. 
Rawlins said the jungle-like overgrowth and creek tucked in the middle of brown 
desert terrain "has a great Vietnam look."

And it has a tragic history. In 1982, actor Vic Morrow and two child actors 
were killed by a helicopter during the filming of a Vietnam War battle scene in 
the film, "Twilight Zone." 
</P>
<P>
The incident brought publicity and lawsuits -- director John Landis and four 
others were acquitted of manslaughter charges -- but didn't diminish the 
attraction to Indian Dunes. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Steven Spielberg's "The Color Purple" (1985), and Jack 
Nicholson's "The Two Jakes" (1990) have staged scenes at the site, and ABC's 
"China Beach" does most of its location shoots there. The TV movie and series 
"Call to Glory" used Indian Dunes from its debut in 1984 until it was canceled 
a year later. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Franco, executive producer of Disney's "Rocketeer," which wrapped up 
shooting last week as the final film to use Indian Dunes, said the site 
afforded filmmakers plentiful options. "It was a place with all kinds of 
freedom," Franco said. "You have wide open spaces, and you can easily stage 
pyro effects." 
</P>
<P>
Indian Dunes is also prized, Franco said, because nighttime scenes can be 
filmed without city lights showing in the background, plus there's a long 
landing strip. "You can be high up," he said, "and not see anything behind it. 
And you can't land a glider on a real roof in a big city." "Rocketeer," due to 
be released next year, tells the story of a World War II aviator who discovers 
a rocket pack, allowing him to fly anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The ABC-TV drama "China Beach" began filming at Indian Dunes in 1988, its debut 
season. Rob Harland, the show's production executive, said it will miss the 
running stream that helped lend the location its Southeast Asia appearance. "It 
was hard to find that water, and it will be hard to duplicate it, especially in 
the zone," Harland said. 
</P>
<P>
The "zone" is the studio zone, the imaginary line 30 miles from Beverly and La 
Cienega, the former headquarters of the Alliance of Motion Picture and 
Television Producers, who negotiate labor contracts with the studios. Once 
outside the zone, companies have to pay union cast and crew transportation 
costs. Production executives will do everything possible to shoot their movies 
within the zone, which made Indian Dunes so attractive. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a huge factor," said Franco, who also produced "Escape From New York" in 
1979 at Indian Dunes. "If you're not in the zone, it becomes an ordeal to 
transport people to the location area. Then you have to pay for their time to 
drive to the location, and you get behind on your shooting day. Indian Dunes is 
expensive, but by being close, it far outweighs the cost of shooting there." 
</P>
<P>
Harland said companies might have to make compromises to offset the loss of 
Indian Dunes. "China Beach," for example, might be forced to shoot without the 
stream next year. 
</P>
<P>
Added Franco: "You have to ask yourself if it is worth it to shoot something 
outside the zone versus L.A." 
</P>
<P>
Lindsley Parsons Jr. may not shoot anywhere. His scheduled film, "The Day 
Before Midnight," based on a novel by Stephen Hunter, has been delayed, and may 
never start production. Parsons, the producer, spent thousands of dollars and 
more than two months searching Western states for the ideal site for his story 
about a terrorist group who seizes control of a United States missile site. In 
July, he settled on Indian Dunes. 
</P>
<P>
"I sent location scouts to almost every Western state," Parsons said, "and had 
stills sent back from all over the country. Indian Dunes worked for us. I 
photographed it from the air. I went there many times by car. I made sketches. 
It had water, brown hills, cliffs. It had a place where we could build a 
missile site." 
</P>
<P>
Already, Rawlins said, the commission has begun searching for alternative 
filming sites. She said one of them, the Polsa Rosa ranch in Acton, which has 
already been used for episodes of the daytime TV soap opera, "Santa Barbara," 
offers many of the natural advantages of Indian Dunes, such as mountains and 
greenery. But she admits that it's not another Indian Dunes. "In terms of sheer 
size for the mesas that Indian Dunes has, you can't truly match it." 
</P>
<P>
Marlee Lauffer, a spokeswoman for the Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co., which 
owns Indian Dunes, stressed that the company has 10,000 other acres in the 
Valencia area available for filming, but, according to Rawlins, "it doesn't 
have the unique appeal" of Indian Dunes. 
</P>
<P>
Until the early 1980s, mostly commercials were shot at Indian Dunes, Lauffer 
said. The television show, "Rawhide," starring Clint Eastwood, filmed at the 
location from 1959 to 1966. 
</P>
<P>
From the mid-1960s until the mid-1980s, it was primarily used as Indian Dunes 
Park, a motorcycle and off-road vehicle track. Because of insurance liability 
problems, the Newhall company decided to use the terrain only for filming. Its 
most recent decision to convert it to farming came about gradually, Lauffer 
said, as the demand for crops began to increase. 
</P>
<P>
"Our primary purpose is, and always has been, farming," said Lauffer. "We have 
a demand to increase our crops, and this is good land." 
</P>
<P>
But Harland and Franco suspect that the company plans to use the land for real 
estate development. "They're going to develop the spot immediately, believe 
me," Franco said. Lauffer admitted that the company hopes to develop other 
areas of the Newhall Ranch, but now has no plans for Indian Dunes. 
</P>
<P>
"China Beach" has a contract to use the site through the end of its fourth 
season of shooting next spring. Only "China Beach," she said, will continue to 
do filming as farming begins. 
</P>
<P>
Harland said it's too early to search for new sites. He may never need to 
start; unless ratings improve, the show might be canceled this season. Harland 
said the crew will miss Indian Dunes for emotional and practical reasons. "I'm 
sure it will be difficult for them," he said. "They became attached to the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
"And I can remember the mornings when it was colder than a well digger's toe, 
and by afternoon, you're sweating your tail off. We'll miss that variety of 
climates too." He said the show also frequently benefited from using other sets 
on the property, such as the one constructed for "Tour of Duty," which aired on 
CBS from 1987 till this year. "But everyone's always been flexible, and if the 
network wants us, we'll find a way to adjust." 
</P>
<P>
Franco worries about the effect on the film industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The first place anyone thinks of when you want to be in the zone and have a 
lot of choices is Indian Dunes," he said. "You drive right there and you have 
got everything. I don't know where the next best place will be." 
</P>
<P>
Rawlins said the full extent of the loss won't be known for months. 
</P>
<P>
"The complaints we're getting now are from people who wanted to shoot there in 
the near future," she said. "I think it will be missed a lot when people in six 
months call to ask about it and find out it can't be used anymore."

A SMALL MAN, A BIG TRADITION; 
</P>
<P>
25 YEARS AGO, MIKE GARRETT GOT THE BALL ROLLING AT USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-five years ago this month, a compact, iron-willed man from the Maravilla 
public housing projects in East Los Angeles won the Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Garrett established the benchmark for all the USC tailbacks who have 
followed, from O.J. Simpson to Clarence Davis, Anthony Davis to Ricky Bell, 
Charles White to Marcus Allen, Ricky Ervins to Mazio Royster. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the one who set the standard, in terms of saying, 'Give me the ball; I 
want the ball,' " said his coach, John McKay. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett was the first Trojan to average more than 25 carries a game, a practice 
that later became commonplace, and the first since Morley Drury in 1927 to rush 
for more than 1,000 yards. 
</P>
<P>
It was Garrett who justified McKay's faith in the power-I, which has remained 
USC's basic offensive formation through three other coaches, but at the time 
was in its developmental stages. 
</P>
<P>
His influence was such that in 1979 -- after White joined Garrett and Simpson 
as Heisman Trophy winners -- former assistant coach Dave Levy said: "Without 
Mike Garrett, we might never have come to the place we are now." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson, who was raised in San Francisco, has said that it was Garrett's 
success that attracted him to USC in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
Although some considered him undersized -- UCLA, in fact, stopped recruiting 
him because it thought him too small -- the 5-foot-9, 180-pound Garrett never 
missed a start in three varsity seasons, rushing for a then-record 3,221 yards, 
including 1,440 as a senior in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
He was, wrote columnist Jim Murray in The Times, "as elusive as a collar 
button, as indestructible as a bride's first set of biscuits." 
</P>
<P>
His nickname was Iron Mike. 
</P>
<P>
Only White, among the tailbacks that have followed him to USC, averaged more 
yards a carry than Garrett, who averaged 5.27. 
</P>
<P>
"I still say Simpson was the best player I ever saw, but Garrett was 
unbelievable," McKay said. "He had a great ability to just bounce off people 
and run and run. We were criticized at that time for running him too much, but 
he never complained. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not a loudmouth. He would not be in fashion today, where everybody 
slaps hands every time they make two yards. He just did the job." 
</P>
<P>
McKay first realized Garrett's ability in the days leading up to the 1963 Rose 
Bowl game, which matched the unbeaten Trojans against once-beaten Wisconsin for 
the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
A freshman, Garrett was ineligible to play for the varsity, so he was asked to 
emulate Wisconsin's Louis Holland in practice. 
</P>
<P>
USC's defense had held opponents to 55 points in that '62 season, but it 
couldn't tackle Garrett, who had been hurt most of the season and was only then 
rounding into shape. 
</P>
<P>
"He was so damn good that we said, 'If Wisconsin has a better back than him, 
we're really in trouble,' " McKay said. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, few teams had backs as good as Garrett. 
</P>
<P>
With McKay calling his number more frequently each season, he ran for 833 yards 
as a sophomore and 948 yards as a junior before reaching the 1,000-yard level 
as a senior, when he scored 16 touchdowns in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that if we were going to win anything, he was the guy we were going to 
win with because he was not surrounded by other great players, as (the 
tailbacks) have been since," McKay said. "He was the first guy who we said, 
'Let him hit every time we get a chance.' 
</P>
<P>
"We ran the ball and ran the ball, and he didn't seem to mind it. So, being a 
very astute person, I said, 'Well, let him have it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Garrett, in fact, loved the way the Trojans used him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm one of those slow learners in the sense that the more I get to do 
something, the better I get at it," said Garrett, who lives in Pasadena with 
his second wife, Suzanne, and two children, Sara, 8, and Daniel, 4. He is the 
director of boxing and business development at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
"I always felt comfortable in the fact that I would have X number of chances to 
carry the ball, and I loved carrying the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Garrett had been struck by the glamour of the Heisman Trophy when he watched 
winners Alan Ameche of Wisconsin and Howard (Hopalong) Cassady of Ohio State 
play on television in the mid-1950s. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth of six children, he was an All-City running back at Roosevelt High, 
where he ran for 1,467 yards and scored 153 points as a senior, and dreamed of 
playing for UCLA, which had always been his favorite team. 
</P>
<P>
During the recruiting process, however, UCLA soured on Garrett, and Garrett on 
the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
"UCLA, I didn't feel, was being forthright," Garrett said. "I didn't like the 
feel I got from their people. USC people were more genuine, and the UCLA people 
were more affected, nouveau riche kind of people." 
</P>
<P>
Garrett enrolled at USC, where McKay was tinkering with an I-formation attack 
that would make the tailback as much a focal point of the offense as the 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out to be a perfect marriage of system and athlete. 
</P>
<P>
"Garrett was the prototype USC tailback," a Sports Illustrated reporter wrote 
many years later. "He brought to the new offense the quality a great actor 
brings to a great part -- Olivier playing Othello, Bogart playing Charlie 
Allnutt." 
</P>
<P>
In the I formation, the tailback starts from a standing position, several yards 
straight behind the quarterback, where he is able to see the best running 
angles and read the blocks of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
It was perfect for Garrett, whose greatest strengths as a runner were his 
agility and vision. 
</P>
<P>
The plays were uncomplicated, "but if you stopped the power (blast), I might 
jump across and run to the opposite side of the field," Garrett said. "Because 
of that, our three basic plays became six or seven plays." 
</P>
<P>
McKay at first called the offense a shifting-T because, although the Trojans 
usually lined up in an I, they often shifted out of it. 
</P>
<P>
But the more Garrett carried the ball out of the basic I formation, the more 
McKay was convinced of the attack's potential. 
</P>
<P>
Said Garrett: "When he realized I had the ability to read the linebackers and 
the flow of the defense, he said, 'I'm going to leave this sucker behind the 
fullback and let's play it.' " 
</P>
<P>
That much settled, McKay shifted his attention to another question: How often 
could Garrett carry the ball without breaking down? 
</P>
<P>
Garrett said that in the Monday practice after USC's opener in 1965, a 20-20 
tie with Minnesota in which Garrett carried 33 times for 146 yards, McKay 
wouldn't stop staring at him. 
</P>
<P>
"It was piercing," Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, McKay approached and asked if he felt abnormally sore. 
</P>
<P>
When Garrett told him that, in fact, he felt great, McKay apparently came to 
the realization that Garrett could carry the ball as often as was asked of him. 
</P>
<P>
He averaged 30 carries in USC's first five games, rushing for 852 yards and 
seven touchdowns to gain national attention. 
</P>
<P>
In 10 games that season, only Notre Dame and California held Garrett to fewer 
than 100 yards rushing -- and in a 35-0 victory over Cal, Garrett returned 
punts 87 and 74 yards for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
He carried 40 times against UCLA, gaining 210 yards in a 20-16 loss that 
deprived the Trojans of a Rose Bowl bid. 
</P>
<P>
USC was 21-8-1 in three seasons with Garrett but never played in the Rose Bowl. 
McKay called it one of his greatest disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
Still, "he convinced us (the offense) would work and that it was a great 
system," McKay said. 
</P>
<P>
Using the I, USC won national championships in 1967, 1972 and 1974 under McKay, 
then won another in 1978 under John Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett signed with the Kansas City Chiefs and played eight seasons in the NFL, 
the last four with the San Diego Chargers. He ran for 5,481 yards and scored 49 
touchdowns as a pro and was the first player to run for more than 1,000 yards 
with two teams. 
</P>
<P>
He played in Super Bowls II and IV with the Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
An outfielder and .300 hitter at USC, Garrett announced his retirement from 
football after the 1970 Super Bowl, saying that he planned to sign with the 
Dodgers. But the Dodgers, he said, never made him a reasonable offer. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to the NFL, playing until he retired in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
He worked for several years as a counselor for juvenile delinquents and earned 
a law degree in 1985. In 1982, he ran an unsuccessful write-in campaign for 
Congress. In 1983, he ran an unsuccessful campaign for the San Diego City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his duties at the Forum, Garrett also works as a commentator on 
Prime Ticket's telecasts of USC football games. 
</P>
<P>
He is best known, however, as the forerunner to Simpson, Davis, Bell, White, 
Allen, et al. 
</P>
<P>
It was Garrett who put the power in the power-I.

<TEXT>
<P>
Diamond Strawberry, daughter of Darryl, wiggled and squiggled in her Dodger 
daddy's arms and didn't really listen to what he had to say. Everybody else in 
the dining room did, and this is what he said: 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, my life is headed in the right direction. I'm only 28 years old 
and my career is on the uprise. All I want to do is what Darryl Strawberry does 
best -- and that's bangin' on that ball." 
</P>
<P>
Any questions? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there were questions. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry fielded them cleanly Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Why did you leave New York?" (To get to the other side.) "If the Mets offered 
you the same money as the Dodgers, would you still be a Met?" (No.) "What will 
the pressure be playing in your hometown?" (Pressure? In Los Angeles? What 
comedy club do you work in?) "What position will you play in Los Angeles?" 
(Outfield.) "What will your number be in Los Angeles?" (Probably 1-900.) 
</P>
<P>
A lot of New Yorkers were in the neighborhood, here for Sunday's Giants-Rams 
game. They had lots of questions for The Darryl. As I was leaving, somebody 
even stuck a microphone into the face of Diamond Strawberry, who is 2. She 
tried to eat it. 
</P>
<P>
About the only thing Strawberry did not get asked was whether Edwin Moses, 
Willie Gault and Bo Jackson had contacted him yet about that bobsled thing. 
This is a big bobsled town, Los Angeles. Strawberry can tell you. It's what 
your typical Crenshaw High guy wants to grow up to do. 
</P>
<P>
Anyhow, anybody who loves baseball or who loves or hates Los Angeles or New 
York must have a question or two for Dodger Darryl. We have a few, too. 
</P>
<P>
Let's play 20 Questions, shall we? 
</P>
<P>
1. OK, why DID he leave New York? 
</P>
<P>
Darryl says: "I just wanted to get away from it all." If you ask me, though, I 
still think it was that La Guardia flight-pattern thing. At Dodger Stadium, the 
loudest noise pattern he will encounter is Lasorda burping up those milkshakes. 
</P>
<P>
2. What did Fred Claire do that no Met would do? 
</P>
<P>
Darryl says: "He sat down and talked to me like a person." That darned Fred 
Claire. Guy knows every trick in the book. 
</P>
<P>
3. OK, if New York had matched L.A.'s offer, which team would Straw be 
stirring? 
</P>
<P>
Darryl says: "The team I'm standing here with right now, the L.A. Dodgers." 
Yeah, and I know why. It's our world-famous affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
4. Why does California keep picking on New York? 
</P>
<P>
We took away the Dodgers. We took away the Giants. We took Dave Winfield. We 
took Kevin Mitchell. Now Strawberry. And I hear that, in the divorce 
settlement, we get Ivana. 
</P>
<P>
5. What will New Yorkers do to get even? 
</P>
<P>
Hey, they already took Steve Sax. They could go after Fernando. They could even 
take Juan Samuel. (Please.) 
</P>
<P>
6. OK, what position WILL Strawberry play? 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda says: "Any position he wants." (Pa-rump-bump.) But seriously, ladies 
and germs, Darryl says: "I'll play where they put me. I don't want to be 
recognized as a person with an attitude. I don't have an attitude." Fortunately 
for Darryl, in California we have many fine attitude enhancement centers. 
</P>
<P>
7. What did Strawberry's buddy Eric Davis have to say about all this? 
</P>
<P>
Darryl says: "His comments were: 'What a lineup!"' That's an impressive comment 
coming from someone who plays for the World Series champions. Doubly impressive 
is that the Valley's own Eric, of Woodland Hills, did not say to his best bud 
Darryl, who lives in Encino: "Whoa, what a lineup, Straw dude! Excellent!" 
</P>
<P>
8. What will Strawberry hit for the Dodgers? 
</P>
<P>
Baseballs. Many, many baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
9. OK, what number WILL Strawberry wear? 
</P>
<P>
Darryl says: "I have to speak with Bill Russell about that. I want 18, but he's 
got it. There's also 44 because that's what Eric wears for the Reds, but I 
don't know." Well, I know, Darryl. Aaron, Reggie, Eric . . . haven't we had 
enough 44s? Do what Carlton Fisk did, man. Turn your old number backward. The 
Dodgers haven't even retired 81. 
</P>
<P>
10. Will the fans in L.A. treat Darryl different than New York's? 
</P>
<P>
Darryl says (after he eventually stops laughing): "Time will tell." Yes, it 
will. When the time is 7:30 p.m., Dodger ticket-holders will be cheering as 
Darryl comes to bat. When the time is 9:30 p.m., Dodger ticket-holders will be 
tuning those AM radio dials to KABC-790 in their cars, to hear Darryl bat in 
the bottom of the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
11. Is Darryl ready for life in L.A.? 
</P>
<P>
He wore a gray suit to his press conference Thursday -- with no socks. You tell 
me. 
</P>
<P>
12. Did Darryl get Jose Canseco's kind of money? 
</P>
<P>
Yes. Green. Lots. His contract is worth $20,250,000. It will be renegotiated to 
$20,250,100, soon as Darryl remembers that California requires his car to have 
a smog check. 
</P>
<P>
13. What does Strawberry think of the Dodgers? 
</P>
<P>
Darryl says: "It's probably the finest organization in baseball." Boy, are 
those Seattle people going to be ticked off when they hear this. 
</P>
<P>
14. Does the 1991 Strawberry come with a guarantee? 
</P>
<P>
Darryl says: "Fred Claire has taken a lot of heat. But I'll tell you what: He 
won't take no heat for this. I'll make sure of that." He'd better, too, because 
sometimes those California sportswriters get so vicious, they'll write an 
entire bad sentence about a guy. 
</P>
<P>
15. What is Kirk Gibson's role in all this? 
</P>
<P>
1988. 
</P>
<P>
16. Is it fair for one town to have Magic Johnson, Wayne Gretzky, Bo Jackson 
AND Darryl Strawberry? 
</P>
<P>
No, and I hear Fay Vincent's got that John Dowd guy working on it. 
</P>
<P>
17. Will Eric Davis join the Dodgers someday? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, and I hope that Marge Schott has to pay his plane fare. 
</P>
<P>
18. What in New York will Strawberry miss most? 
</P>
<P>
162 games. (Pa-rump-bump.) 
</P>
<P>
19. How will he remember New York most?

Darryl says: "I got criticized a lot, but I'm not that bad of a person." 
Darryl, speaking for sportswriters everywhere, after dealing with Kirk Gibson 
and Eddie Murray, I wouldn't call you a bad person if you set fire to the 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
20. Any other questions for Darryl? 
</P>
<P>
Yes. Would you promise never to refer to $20,250,000 as "20 million and 
change?" Thanks. Now sit down and talk like a person.

KINGS HAVE A NIGHT FOR DIONNE, DEFENSE; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: TEAM BARELY MISSES SECOND CONSECUTIVE SHUTOUT WITH 5-1 VICTORY OVER RED 
WINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Marcel Dionne, on hand at the Forum Thursday night to have his number retired 
by the Kings, might have had trouble recognizing his former team. 
</P>
<P>
Different colors. Different owner. Different defense. 
</P>
<P>
Much different defense. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing to remake the poor defensive image formed through years of futility, 
the Kings beat the Detroit Red Wings, 5-1, in front of a sellout crowd of 
16,005. 
</P>
<P>
Goalie Kelly Hrudey came within 1 minute 44 seconds of equaling the shutout 
performance turned in by Daniel Berthiaume Sunday against the Chicago 
Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Yzerman finally scored on a power-play goal to end the Kings' hopes of 
getting their first back-to-back shutouts in almost 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
When Yzerman put the puck in the net, defenseman Larry Robinson, who had tried 
to swat it away with his gloved hand, smashed his stick on the ice in 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
That alone demonstrates how far the Kings have come. In the old days, a 
one-goal defensive effort would have been a cause for celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"It just shows," said Coach Tom Webster of Robinson's outburst, "how much pride 
everyone is taking in the defensive game." 
</P>
<P>
Hrudey, however, was not upset at giving up the first goal against the Kings 
since the Washington Capitals' Michal Pivonka scored a game-winner 3:34 into 
the final period last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have been disappointed if we lost," Hrudey said. "I'm never 
disappointed when we win." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings almost lost Hrudey when a shot off the stick of Steve Chiasson in the 
second period hit him squarely in the mask, dropping Hrudey to the ice. 
</P>
<P>
Time was called until Hrudey was able to return to his feet, but he refused to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
"That never entered my mind," he said. "It was not that severe a blow. It just 
knocked me silly for a minute. When I knew it was going to hit me in the head, 
I cringed." 
</P>
<P>
By the time he was finished, Hrudey had blocked 28 shots, enabling the Kings to 
improve to 11-4-1. They remain one point behind the Smythe Division-leading 
Calgary Flames. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit is 7-7-3, 0-6-3 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Wings should have sensed it wasn't their night when the Kings' Tony 
Granato was slapped with a double minor for high-sticking Yzerman in the first 
period. 
</P>
<P>
The four-minute advantage produced four shots -- all by the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles had three opportunities for a short-handed goal. But Bob Kudelski 
missed on a breakaway and Scott Bjugstad and Steve Duchesne both missed on 
three-on-two rushes. 
</P>
<P>
When the Kings finally did break through, it came at even strength at the 15:48 
mark of the first period. Mike Krushelnyski, along the right boards, passed 
through the crease to the onrushing Jay Miller, charging from the left. Miller 
smashed the puck over the stick of goalie Tim Cheveldae for his second goal of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings doubled their margin when Chiasson lost the puck in his own zone. Luc 
Robitaille, in the slot, fed Todd Elik, camped by the right post. 
</P>
<P>
With Cheveldae out of position, Elik was staring at an open net. He didn't 
stare long, flipping the puck in for his seventh goal. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky added to the scoring by collecting his team-leading 11th goal on 
the Kings' first shot of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Taking a pass through the crease from Tomas Sandstrom, Gretzky scored from the 
right circle at 2:54, extending his point-scoring streak to 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky turned to his other specialty, the assist, to set up the Kings' fourth 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
His behind-the-back pass wound up on Granato's stick in the slot. Granato left 
a drop pass for Sandstrom, enabling him to score on a 50-foot slap shot at 5:32 
of the third period, his ninth goal. 
</P>
<P>
Duchesne made it 5-0 with his third of the season at the 10-minute mark of the 
final period. 
</P>
<P>
The way the Kings were playing defense, that was more than enough. 
</P>
<P>
"We are doing the things that make teams winners," Gretzky said. "We are doing 
things this team hasn't done before." 
</P>
<P>
At least not since the days when Dionne was young and the greatest one in town. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
The sweater of Marcel Dionne, bearing the number 16, was retired before the 
game. Dionne, a King for 12 seasons, is the team's all-time leader in games 
(921), points (1,307), goals (550) and assists (757). Dionne who started with 
the Red Wings and finished with the New York Rangers in a career that spanned 
17 seasons, is also third in NHL history in points (1771), behind Wayne Gretzky 
and Gordie Howe, and second in goals (731) behind Howe. Dionne is the second 
King to have his sweater retired. His No. 16 hangs beside Rogie Vachon's No. 
30. . . . On hand for the ceremony were former teammates Mike Murphy, Butch 
Goring, Gary Simmons and Vic Venasky. . . . Among the gifts Dionne received 
were a clock from the league, a gold plate from the Red Wings, a trip to Europe 
from King owner Bruce McNall, and a trip to Hawaii from the King players.

The Rams announced Thursday that their game against the New York Giants Sunday 
at 1 p.m. at Anaheim Stadium is a sellout, allowing it to be televised locally 
on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
The network could have found itself in a jam in Los Angeles had the Raiders' 
home game against Green Bay sold out as well. CBS, also televising the Raiders 
because the Packers are an NFC team, would have had to make a choice.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: SUPERFAN WASN'T INVULNERABLE TO RATINGS, RUMORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Ed (Superfan) Bieler went to work for radio station KABC in 1973, he was a 
novelty. In an era dominated by housemen and apologists in the electronic 
media, Bieler took on the Establishment. He fought for the little guy. 
</P>
<P>
Bieler, a former trucking executive, came out of nowhere to become a star and a 
ratings success, No. 1 in his time slot. 
</P>
<P>
But the station fired Bieler in 1976, saying he was irresponsible. He was 
threatened with several lawsuits. He also criticized the Dodgers and, worse 
yet, Dodger Dogs, which didn't go over too well with the team that helped make 
KABC one of the top-rated stations in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
All was forgiven last year when George Green, KABC general manager, rehired 
Bieler. Green, who was the station's sales manager during Bieler's earlier 
stint, was well aware of his ratings success. 
</P>
<P>
But Bieler, try as he might, failed to repeat it. 
</P>
<P>
In a different climate, with more announcers not afraid to be critical, Bieler 
was no longer a novelty. He was no longer the only one going against the grain. 
</P>
<P>
And he seemed to have lost touch with the L.A. market. He made more mistakes 
than he should have, and his critics and competitors were quick to point them 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, almost from the start, there were rumors of his demise. Who would 
replace Superfan? Would it be Lee Hamilton of San Diego's XTRA? Or would Stu 
Nahan come back? Or Fred Wallin? Would it be Eric Tracy? Or Joe McDonnell? 
</P>
<P>
Some of the rumors were believable, others were not. But they took a toll on 
Bieler. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Bieler was given a short contract extension, running through early 
1991. But after the baseball season, his "Sportstalk" show was cut from four 
hours to two. 
</P>
<P>
It is known that station management talked with Hamilton and McDonnell, and 
Tracy submitted a proposal in which he suggested that he and McDonnell work 
together. 
</P>
<P>
So maybe Bieler was on the way out, anyway. Whatever, he finally threw in the 
towel. 
</P>
<P>
Bieler declined interview requests but said on the air that he and station 
management had different ideas about the direction of the show. 
</P>
<P>
Bieler's manager, Ron Bain of San Diego, said there were a lot of factors 
behind his client's decision, and the rumors were among them. 
</P>
<P>
While in Las Vegas for the Evander Holyfield-Buster Douglas fight, Bieler told 
people he was "gunning for Hamilton," whom he apparently viewed as a threat. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said he has no idea why Bieler would feel that way toward him. 
</P>
<P>
Bieler made his decision to quit while in Las Vegas, and he told KABC 
management shortly thereafter. He made his on-air announcement last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton, some people figure, is the favorite to become the host of 
"Sportstalk." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we've talked," Hamilton said. "But I've got some other possibilities to 
consider." 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton, who is also the voice of the San Diego Chargers, is under contract to 
XTRA, but he has an out clause that would allow him to leave the San Diego 
market after the NFL season. 
</P>
<P>
His other offers include one from radio station WWWE in his hometown of 
Cleveland, a position in Minneapolis as the voice of the Minnesota Vikings, and 
a play-by-play job with the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said he may decide to stay at XTRA, a station he has put on the sports 
map during his four years there. "They'd like me to stay," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ira Fistell, the interim "Sportstalk" host who is doing double duty while 
continuing as host of his 9 p.m.-to-midnight show on KABC, is another solid 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't know if I could continue to do both shows," Fistell said, 
although he did both for a year and a half in 1979-80. 
</P>
<P>
Asked which he would choose if it came to that, Fistell said, "I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Tracy, a workhorse who has been at KABC for nine years, and McDonnell, of KFI, 
are longshots. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Fox, KABC program director, said: "We're being upfront about this. 
We're going to open it up." 
</P>
<P>
Fox said some of the candidates will be used on the air. "We plan to take a 
look at a lot of people," he said. "We aren't working under any timetable." 
</P>
<P>
NBC debut: Pat Riley made his first full-fledged appearance as co-host of NBC's 
"NBA Showtime" telecast last Saturday and, all things considered, came off 
pretty well. 
</P>
<P>
He appeared a little uncomfortable, as anyone would trying something new, but 
to his credit, he didn't try to be overly cute or opinionated. He seems to be 
smartly easing into his new role. 
</P>
<P>
Riley did get in a jab at new colleague Bob Ferry, former general manager of 
the Washington Bullets, after co-host Bob Costas said Ferry had a career 
shooting percentage of .439. "That's better than he was as a general manager," 
Riley chided. 
</P>
<P>
After a feature on the Lakers and the relationship with their new coach, Mike 
Dunleavy, Costas asked, "You rode the lads -- were you cracking the whip too 
hard?" 
</P>
<P>
Riley, laughing, said he broke only one blackboard last season. 
</P>
<P>
After returning home, Riley said: "That was just a throwaway line. Yeah, sure, 
there were times I got pretty mad, but for some reason, I've been turned into 
Atilla the Hun." 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
Early favorite for NBC's NBA rookie of the year is commentator Mike Fratello. 
He's tremendous. And what a catch for the Clippers and Channel 5. He and Ralph 
Lawler are an excellent team. . . . The weak link in NBC's NBA lineup may turn 
out to be sportswriter Peter Vecsey. He doesn't have good television presence, 
his beard looks awful, and he could use some diction lessons. Last Saturday, he 
called arenas "areners". . . . Someone should have told NBC newcomer Steve 
Jones not to try to speak over the national anthem before the Laker-San Antonio 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The announcers for Sunday's Ram-Giant game at Anaheim will be Pat Summerall and 
John Madden. . . . The NBC game at 10 a.m. is Seattle at Kansas City, with Jim 
Donovan and Paul Maguire. Donovan is filling in for Marv Albert, who has the 
weekend off. . . . ESPN takes over Sunday night games from TNT this weekend, 
with San Francisco playing at Dallas. Mike Patrick and Joe Theismann are the 
announcers. . . . The Cowboys' lone victory last season, against Washington, 
came on ESPN. . . . ESPN announced this week that the Hearst Corp. has 
purchased 20% of the network. 
</P>
<P>
ABC has a college football doubleheader Saturday. Originally, the network was 
planning to show Michigan vs. Illinois at 9 a.m., but has switched to Ohio 
State at Iowa. The second game, at 12:30 p.m., will be UCLA at Washington. 
Brent Musburger and Dick Vermeil will work the first game, Keith Jackson and 
Bob Griese the second. . . . No definite word yet on whether ABC will televise 
the USC-UCLA game at the Rose Bowl next Saturday. Washington-Washington State 
is a possibility, particularly if Notre Dame loses to Tennessee Saturday and 
the Huskies beat UCLA and become No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Roggin's new syndicated show, "Roggin's Heroes," set to make its debut in 
January, has been cleared in 125 markets, representing 85% of the nation, MCA 
TV announced. . . . The Kings' Bob Miller has been nominated for an ACE Award, 
his second nomination for the cable television honor. He was also nominated in 
1988, when Chick Hearn was the winner. Marv Albert won last year for his work 
on the Madison Square Garden network. Other nominees this year are Jim Lampley 
for his HBO work, Jon Miller of ESPN, and Bob Neal of Turner Broadcasting.

SAVANNA DEFEATS MAGNOLIA, CLINCHES BERTH IN PLAYOFFS

<P>
Anaheim Savanna, once one of the least successful high school football teams in 
Orange County and last season among the most notorious, erased some bad 
memories Thursday night at Glover Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
By virtue of a 42-0 victory over Magnolia, the Rebels clinched a spot in the 
Southern Section Division VI playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
It will be their first playoff appearance since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the Rebels finished as the Orange League's co-champion with 
Valencia. However, they had to forfeit all of their games because of an 
ineligible player. The team's booster club attempted to get a court order to 
reinstate the Rebels, but were denied. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Belanger led the Rebels by completing 16 of 20 passes for 217 yards and 
four touchdowns. Belanger had 155 yards passing the first half, throwing 
touchdown passes of 14 and 20 yards to Hien Nguyen and nine yards to Scott 
Bird. 
</P>
<P>
Savanna is 6-2-2 overall and 3-1-1 in the league play. Magnolia is 1-9 and 0-5.

<P>
HOMECOMING: FORMER CRENSHAW HIGH STAR STRAWBERRY HAS OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE AS A 
ROLE MODEL FOR CITY KIDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If he ever needed more notoriety, Darryl Strawberry will always have this: In 
1980, he became one of the few high school players to hit a home run at Dodger 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhat appropriately, it landed in the right-center field seats, just over 
the 385-foot mark. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Dodgers are banking on the former Crenshaw High player to hit more of 
those home runs, this time in a greater, more national sphere. But the real 
payoff of Strawberry's return to Los Angeles may still be local. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry's worth to the Dodgers could be rivaled by his contribution as a 
role model to Los Angeles students at an inner-city high school, where dreams 
of greatness struggle to survive on the fields and playgrounds where Strawberry 
once played. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw may look like any other city school. The buildings are old, the walls 
white, and most of the students are either Latino or black. Within its walls, 
there is a history of athletic achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry, Chris Brown and Ellis Valentine went there. As did football player 
Wendell Tyler and basketball star Marques Johnson. They were all students at 
the "Shaw" at one time. And most of them still visit. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry spent last Friday afternoon at Crenshaw's football homecoming game. 
During basketball season, he attends many of the afternoon games. He donates 
sports equipment to the school, keeps in touch with his coaches and talks to 
the students. "I don't forget my roots," said Strawberry, who grew up near 
Crenshaw and Slauson. 
</P>
<P>
But now that Strawberry will be playing in Los Angeles, Crenshaw basketball 
Coach Willie Westbelieves Strawberry's impact on the students will be far 
greater. 
</P>
<P>
"Darryl was the No. 1 draft pick in 1980, but this is 1990, and he's more of 
just a name to these kids," West said. 
</P>
<P>
"Because he's played in New York, we didn't get too many stories about him, 
just box scores. Now, he'll be here. That is sure to be more of an inspiration 
to the kids." 
</P>
<P>
Some hope that Strawberry will get involved in a newly organized city baseball 
project. "The inner city program needs an injection of some type, and, I can't 
speak for Darryl, but I don't think he will let us down," said Brooks Hurst, 
Strawberry's baseball coach at Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
"He has kept his ties to the area. Every winter he still works out at Harbor 
Park with (San Diego Padre) Chris Brown and about five other players." 
</P>
<P>
In Strawberry's sophomore year, he was quarterback on the football team. His 
junior and senior years, he started as a forward on the basketball team, 
including Crenshaw's City championship team in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry played baseball all three years, mostly in right field, and 
sometimes as a pitcher. He wanted to play center field, but Hurst said he 
already had a talented center fielder, Derwin McNealy, who went on to play in 
the New York Yankee organization. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati's Eric Davis, Strawberry's best friend, grew up a few blocks away 
from him and attended Fremont High. They played in summer leagues together 
dating back to Little League. 
</P>
<P>
"Our best team was a Connie Mack team that won our division and went to 
Washington for the finals," Davis said from Cincinnati. "Darryl played center 
field and I played shortstop. We needed to win a doubleheader for the 
championship, but lost in the finals to a team from OrangeCounty." 
</P>
<P>
When it came time for Strawberry to decide the direction of his future, there 
was no question. He signed a letter of intent to play basketball and baseball 
at Oklahoma State, but signed with the New York Mets as the No. 1 draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
But the transition to professional baseball was tough. Before joining the Mets' 
minor league team at Kingsport, Tenn., Strawberry's longest trip away had been 
the week he went to Washington with Davis and his Connie Mack team. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry struggled early in the minors, and the criticism began quickly. 
Still, at 18, Strawberry strove to be his own person. 
</P>
<P>
"All I've ever thought about is doing well," he said in an 1980 interview. "I 
never thought about being anybody else but myself. If I try to have an idol in 
someone else, if I try to carry myself like Dave Parker or Ted Williams, I'll 
never do the job myself." 
</P>
<P>
But Hurst said Strawberry always had expectations placed on him, even when he 
was 13 years old. "I remember when his older brother (Michael) was playing for 
me at Crenshaw, it was still always Darryl, Darryl, Darryl," Hurst said. 
</P>
<P>
"The expectations on Darryl as a child were tremendous because he was very 
good. He was always supposed to get the critical hit, always score the run. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big challenge to him but because of it he never had a chance to learn 
it was OK to fail. It's just been the last couple of years he has been able to 
deal better with the situation and not fear failure." 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry's career in New York was characterized by criticism of unfulfilled 
expectations. Now, he hopes that is over. 
</P>
<P>
"My baseball life is just starting now," Strawberry said Thursday. "A lot of 
the fun was taken away by the expectations in New York. I think you're going to 
see Darryl Strawberry going at a different level."

BIG NEWS IN BASEBALL TRAVELS FAST; 
</P>
<P>
REACTION: EVERYONE GETS THE WORD ABOUT STRAWBERRY'S DEAL WITH DODGERS AND THE 
WORD FOR THE MOST PART IS 'WOW.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Nick Leyva, manager of the Philadelphia Phillies, heard it on the golf course 
from his partner, Whitey Herzog. 
</P>
<P>
Joe McIlvaine, San Diego Padre general manager, was awakened by a telephone 
call from a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Bonilla, Pittsburgh Pirate right fielder, heard the news flash on the 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
Three different people, three different teams, three different occupations, but 
all in the same league in the same business. And all had the same initial 
reaction as Padre Manager Greg Riddoch after learning that the Dodgers had just 
signed free-agent outfielder Darryl Strawberry to a five-year, 
$20,250,000-contract. 
</P>
<P>
"Those SOBs," Riddoch said. "Can you believe it? 
</P>
<P>
"I was teaching school today when I came in during lunch break, and everyone 
starts saying, 'You're in trouble now. You're in big trouble.' 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'What, what are you talking about.' They said, 'Darryl Strawberry just 
signed with the Dodgers.' 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't feel like eating after that. Wow! They already have a good team 
anyway, and if they get Orel Hershiser and (Tim) Belcher back, and you throw 
Strawberry in the middle of that lineup, oh my gosh . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Who wouldn't be upset?" 
</P>
<P>
Said Roger Craig, manager of the San Francisco Giants: "It was pretty bad news, 
let me tell you. When he gets going, and wants to play, he can carry a 
ballclub. He's gotten into problems with management, front office, and all 
that, but I really can't think of a manager who wouldn't want him." 
</P>
<P>
The signing of Strawberry boggled the baseball industry, with phones ringing 
among agents, owners, players, and yes, those managers and general managers in 
the National League who now have to find a way to knock off the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have enough problems without having that guy in our division," said Bobby 
Cox, manager of the Atlanta Braves. "That's a hell of a team, right there. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the only hope is past history. I remember last year when San Diego got 
Joe Carter, everybody picked them to win it, but they didn't even play .500 
baseball. So who knows what will happen?" 
</P>
<P>
Still, no one is diminishing the Dodgers' potential. 
</P>
<P>
"What a force they're going to be," Leyva said. "You throw that guy in the 
middle of their lineup, and they get the two pitchers back, they could be the 
dominant team in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept thinking about that a good team they'll be while I was playing golf, 
and then Whitey (Herzog) reminded me, 'Hey, at least you got him out of your 
division. Now you only have to face him 12 times instead of 18.' 
</P>
<P>
"I started feeling a whole lot better after that." 
</P>
<P>
Folks in the East Division at least have the consolation of knowing that the 
Mets probably won't be a factor for the next couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
"I guarantee you, no one in the Pirate organization is losing any sleep over 
this one," Bonilla said. "If he had stayed, I'm sure everyone would have picked 
the Mets to win our division. As it is, we might not have to worry about Darryl 
until the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
And who knows, perhaps now that Strawberry is a Dodger, Eric Davis, Cincinnati 
Red outfielder, will eventually join him. Strawberry said two years ago that 
his ultimate dream was to play in his hometown with Davis, his best friend. 
They grew up a couple of blocks from one another in Los Angeles and have the 
same agent. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, you know, I can't elaborate on anything like that yet," Davis said. 
"Let's just say Darryl's taking the first step to making that dream come true. 
Now, if (the Reds) don't sign me to a multiyear contract . . . "

SHELL SYMPATHIZES WITH MANDARICH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coach Art Shell can sympathize with offensive tackle Tony Mandarich of the 
Green Bay Packers, the second player selected in the 1989 NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
A Hall of Fame offensive tackle, Shell thinks it takes time for a player to 
develop at that position. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy to come up to this level and play, especially at tackle," Shell 
said. "Youcan hide a guy at guard inside, but a tackle is out there by 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
Is Mandarich making progress? 
</P>
<P>
Packer Coach Lindy Infante said: "Far too much has been written about his 
progress. He was analyzed so severely that there's no way he could ever live up 
to the expectations that people wanted to place on him." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Don Majkowski of the Packers sprained an ankle in the 24-20 loss to 
the San Francisco 49ers last week, but he is expected to play Sunday against 
the Raiders at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Keith Woodside (ankle injury) and linebacker Brian Noble (foot 
injury) of the Packers are listed as questionable. CHRIS BAKER

GRAY SAYS HE'S READY TO PLAY

<TEXT>
<P>
Cornerback Jerry Gray, who was held out of last Sunday's game because of a sore 
left knee, practiced again Thursday and said he did not plan to stay on the 
sideline against the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll play Sunday -- I'll play Sunday, believe me," Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened is that I had a lot of fluid on my knee going into last week. 
This week, I have little to none." 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson, however, wasn't so sure about Gray's availability. "We're 
not exactly sure what to do, to be honest with you," Robinson said. "It's not 
one of those things that's an obvious decision." 
</P>
<P>
Although a great deal of attention has been focused on the possibility of an 
11-0 Giant team playing an 11-0 San Francisco 49er team in their Candlestick 
Park matchup on Monday night, Dec. 3, New York Coach Bill Parcells doesn't want 
to hear anything about it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no mention of the 49er game around here," Parcells said. "The only 
people who have said anything about that are the newspapers. I can assure you 
that our players are paying absolutely zero attention to the 49ers." TIM

MARKET BEAT: L.A. BROKERS MAY START GETTING THE AX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The broom is about to sweep through many Southland brokerages, as Wall Street 
again cuts staff to deal with its continuing business slump. 
</P>
<P>
To many corporate treasurers, money managers and individual investors, the 
latest purge of brokers and investment bankers may just seem like more 
comeuppance for an industry that enjoyed an orgy of riches in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
But the new round of layoffs may hurt more than those getting the pink slips. 
The financial services industry's deep retrenchment is threatening to create a 
vicious circle that will make it even tougher for many companies to find 
financing, more difficult for investors to trade stocks and less likely that 
the investment business will ever return to a sense of normalcy. 
</P>
<P>
"Up to now, the industry has cut fat," says Frank Baxter, president of 
brokerage Jefferies &amp; Co. in Los Angeles. "Now, they're starting to cut 
into the muscle." 
</P>
<P>
In the latest Wall Street purge: 
</P>
<P>
* Prudential-Bache Securities will slash its nationwide investment banking 
staff of 180 by about two-thirds. The Los Angeles staff of about eight 
investment bankers apparently will be reduced, but a spokeswoman in New York 
insisted that Pru-Bache "will continue to have an active investment banking 
presence in Los Angeles." However, sources say the firm's San Francisco 
investment banking office will be closed. 
</P>
<P>
* Merrill Lynch this week cut 50 investment bankers nationwide, including 
several in West Coast offices, a spokeswoman said. Since the beginning of the 
year, Merrill has cut its banking staff by 18%, to 575 now from 700. 
</P>
<P>
* First Boston, which trimmed its Los Angeles staff earlier this year, may soon 
lose more people here as the firm begins a new round of cutbacks across the 
board. Some rival investment bankers believe that First Boston may ultimately 
pull out of Los Angeles. The firm won't discuss its plans. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an unknown number of Southland brokers are leaving the business one 
by one as clients continue to hibernate from the depressing bear market. "The 
guys we're losing are the younger ones who have been in the business two or 
three years," says Bob Juneman, senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds 
in Los Angeles. "They're finding it very difficult to get enough people on the 
books to make a living." 
</P>
<P>
What's significant about the latest cuts is that they follow already severe 
brokerage staff reductions that have taken place since the 1987 stock market 
crash. Nationwide, securities industry jobs have plunged 19% since 1987, to 
210,000 from 260,000. 
</P>
<P>
Yet brokers' business has fallen even faster, as investors have continued to 
flee the stock market and as corporate merger activity has dried up with the 
slumping economy. Wall Street's desperation to cut investment bankers -- the 
people who advise companies on takeovers, stock offerings and other finance 
needs -- suggests that brokerage chiefs see no recovery in the economy soon. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, if there's no business for those former hot-shot investment bankers, 
it makes sense for them to find something else to do. But the downside for 
Southland companies is that Wall Street's bloodletting is further aggravating 
the longer-term problem of shrinking liquidity -- the availability of money. 
</P>
<P>
For example, area companies will have fewer financing options if more 
investment banking firms pull out of the market. Likewise, the loss of more 
stock traders and brokers can make it tougher for investors to buy or sell 
stocks. That, in turn, feeds on itself: As big investors in particular find it 
more difficult to trade stocks, they trade less. That cuts brokerage revenue 
further, which forces the brokerages to launch new cutbacks. On it goes. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Akin, managing director at Merrill Lynch in Los Angeles, says his 
institutional trading department has already been cut 15% to 20% over the past 
two years, to about 60 people currently. To cut more would damage the 
department's long-term prospects, he says. "We're at the point now where you 
either rethink your entire business strategy or you hold," Akin says. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, corporate and individual clients alike also may begin to suffer 
simply because brokers and investment bankers are under such extreme mental 
pressure -- the ultimate threat of being out of work at any moment. "Fear and 
paralysis have reduced the intensity of service," says Jefferies' Baxter. 
</P>
<P>
Yet some major Southland companies say that, so far, they feel more pampered 
than ever by Wall Street brokerages. The shrinking market is leading many firms 
to pound on every door. "They've been very aggressive for our business," says 
Bruce Jaffe, executive vice president at electronics distributor Bell 
Industries in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Mattel Inc. Chief Financial Officer Jim Eskridge says "they (brokerages) are 
all coming in and giving us proposals. Every one of them has a toy company they 
think we should buy." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, if there's any benefit in Wall Street's shrinkage, it's that the people 
left should be the best at service, ideas and stamina. 
</P>
<P>
The question is whether that much smaller field will be interested only in big 
companies such as Mattel. If so, smaller Southland companies could find it more 
difficult to get the financial help they'll need down the road. 
</P>
<P>
But Lloyd Greif, corporate finance chief at brokerage Sutro &amp; Co. in Los 
Angeles, believes that regional firms such as his can fill the needs of smaller 
firms. In fact, he argues that the cutbacks at major brokerages will help 
smaller area businesses rediscover regional brokerages' financial capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
As long as the economy keeps eroding and the stock market keeps falling, 
however, the outlook for every brokerage remains troubled at best. Don't count 
on the latest firings to be the last. Says one L.A. brokerage chief: "I would 
expect there are going to be a lot more bodies floating face down in the pond 
between now and February." 
</P>
<P>
Briefly: Another sign of the times on Wall Street: Stockbrokers just entering 
the business -- however few there may be in the current market -- will be 
getting a special "ethics brochure" mailed to their homes from the National 
Assn. of Securities Dealers. The brochure stresses "the need for 
professionalism and fair dealing with investors," especially in periods such as 
this one, NASD says. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure Wednesday that San Diego real estate investor M. Larry Lawrence 
has taken a 2% stake in Caesars World doesn't answer the big question: Who was 
buying in early October? That's when a flurry of activity sent the stock up 25% 
to $13.625 a share. Alan Aiello, Lawrence's investment manager, says he wasn't 
buying then. Caesars continues to move higher on takeover speculation, up 50 
cents to $15.625 on Thursday.

</P>
<P>
RETAILING: GAS IS HIGHER, AND CONSUMERS ARE WORRIED. ANALYSTS FEAR AN OFF YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the latest sign of a weak U.S. economy, shoppers are cutting back purchases 
at department stores, some of the nation's best-known retailers reported 
Thursday. The trend provides further evidence that this year's Christmas 
shopping season could be a dud. 
</P>
<P>
"This will probably be the worst Christmas for retailers since 1982," said 
Bruce Steinberg, an economist with the Merrill Lynch investment firm in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, such retail firms as Sears Roebuck, J. C. Penney, Limited Inc. and 
Carter Hawley Hale, owner of the Broadway, reported sales declines from last 
October in stores that had been open at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, consumer credit rose at a modest 4.9% annual rate in September, the 
Federal Reserve Board announced. The $3-billion increase appeared to reflect 
the higher cost of gasoline as well as decisions by hard-pressed Americans to 
pay off their debts more slowly, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the overall sales picture was marginally better than last year by some 
estimates, few analysts found much to cheer about. "The theme here is that 
consumers are being very cautious and their rate of spending is slowing down," 
Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
The consumer slowdown comes amid growing anxiety about the economy, as labor 
markets weaken and Mideast uncertainty persists. Gauges of consumer confidence 
have fallen to their lowest levels since the early 1980s, the time of the last 
official recession. 
</P>
<P>
The news from major retailers "says to me very clearly that indeed we are in a 
recession, and it's most directly being caused by consumers," said Cynthia 
Latta, a financial economist with DRI/McGraw Hill in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending is closely watched because it amounts to two-thirds of U.S. 
economic activity. Thursday's report is limited to activity at major retail 
stores. Next week, the government will release a broader measure of consumer 
purchases, which also includes autos, gasoline and many other items. 
</P>
<P>
The news of weak retail sales follows a recent stream of negative data on 
employment, income and other important features of the U.S. economy.

"Every factor that has influence on consumer spending is negative," said Sandra 
Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group, a private economic research firm 
in Washington. "We're talking about the job market. We're talking about income 
gains, inflation and home prices. It's difficult to see how there could be any 
more strength in consumer spending than there is." 
</P>
<P>
The gloomy picture has led to predictions that the coming Christmas shopping 
season will be disappointing for retailers, many of whom rely on the holidays 
for up to half their annual sales. Faced with paltry consumer demand, stores 
tend to slash prices -- and profits -- to keep inventories from piling up. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas could turn out "pitiful" for stores, said James E. Newton, president 
of Economic Perspectives, a retail consulting firm in Delaware, Ohio. 
"Retailers are not going to enjoy it at all." 
</P>
<P>
A separate key to consumer behavior is the amount of credit sought by the 
public. In September it rose at a 4.9% annual rate. While hardly minuscule, the 
level suggests a retrenchment in spending and is somewhat smaller than the 
credit increases of past months, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Revolving credit, for example -- reflecting credit-card use -- grew in 
September by $1.9 billion, smaller than August's $2.35-billion increase. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumers are trying to buy a little time and maintain their living standards 
by not paying off their credit so rapidly," said DRI's Latta. Also, people in 
September may have put more costly gasoline purchases on their Master Cards and 
Visas, pushing up the credit figures, she said.

Mizlou Seeks Investors: Mizlou Communications Inc., seeking to calm reports 
that the company was in financial trouble, said it is negotiating with several 
cable companies about investing in Sports News Network, its fledgling cable TV 
channel. SNN was launched last February as an all-sports news channel but has 
been plagued by cost overruns for 10 months. Mark Wenzel, chief financial 
officer of Mizlou, said SNN is available in 8 million households and has 
contracts for another 10 million with cable system operators. In an effort to 
cut costs, SNN reduced its program staff to 150 from 180 and moved to new 
facilities in Edison, N.J.

Two Insurers to Withdraw From 3 States: ITT Hartford Insurance Group and Aetna 
Life &amp; Casualty Co. said they plan to withdraw from various insurance 
markets in three states. Aetna is dropping personal auto and homeowners' 
insurance in New Mexico and Idaho, saying the business is unprofitable with 
little hope for much improvement. Hartford, which writes only 0.2% of 
Michigan's personal auto insurance, wants to stop selling it there because of 
financial losses and regulatory restraints.

ANALYSTS DOUBT AT&amp;T, NCR MERGER IN OFFING; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: A PUBLISHED REPORT SAID A COMBINATION WAS BEING CONSIDERED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. is considering combining its computer 
business with NCR Corp. to boost its computer operations, according to a 
published report. But Wall Street analysts Thursday discounted the validity of 
the accounts and questioned the wisdom of such a deal. 
</P>
<P>
Neither AT&amp;T, whose efforts to become a major presence in the computer 
business have faltered over the last six years, nor NCR, best known for its 
computerized cash registers, would comment on the possibility of a combination. 
An acquisition by AT&amp;T of NCR could be valued as high as $6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said rumors of the deal may have started because AT&amp;T, the world's 
largest telephone company, has repeatedly evaluated the wisdom of taking over 
NCR as a way of winning a larger piece of the computer market. But they noted 
that over the years, AT&amp;T has also looked at acquisitions of other computer 
makers, including Unisys Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp., and done nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Since entering the computer business in the mid-1980s, amid fanfare that it 
would soon rival giant International Business Machines, AT&amp;T has struggled 
and lost billions of dollars. That failure, analysts say, is largely because 
the company -- steeped in the traditions of a monopoly operation -- has been 
unable to keep pace with the rapid technological innovations in the computer 
industry. AT&amp;T's computer operation, a $2-billion-a-year business, is still 
losing money, despite company promises that it would be profitable by this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said, AT&amp;T doesn't need to gain a stronger market 
presence through an acquisition. "AT&amp;T needs a better computer sales force 
into corporate America and a greater market presence outside the United 
States," said Stephen K. Smith of Paine Webber in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Added Ulrich Weil, a technology analyst in Washington: "AT&amp;T doesn't need a 
multibillion (dollar) acquisition to gain access to computer manufacturing. 
AT&amp;T seems to me more likely to get out of the computer-making business 
than into it." 
</P>
<P>
Although discounting the possibility of an AT&amp;T-NCR merger, analysts said 
they could not rule out entirely some sort of deal between the two companies. 
One possibility, analysts said, is a manufacturing agreement under which NCR 
would make computers for AT&amp;T's private label.

SEATTLE AGENCY, CREATOR OF ALASKA AIRLINE ADS, TO OPEN OFFICE IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ad agency that put Alaska Airlines on the map now plans to place itself in 
the Los Angeles atlas by opening an office here. 
</P>
<P>
Livingston &amp; Co., the Seattle agency that creates those passengers-as-saps 
ads for Alaska Airlines and the 1950s-themed ads for In-N-Out Burger, will open 
in Los Angeles by Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot ignore Los Angeles and practice advertising in Western America," 
said Roger Livingston, the president and chief executive who will move here to 
oversee the office. 
</P>
<P>
Although 7-year-old Livingston &amp; Co. is regarded as one of the top firms in 
Seattle, its move to Los Angeles comes at a precarious time. The ad industry is 
in a deep slump. Three Los Angeles ad firms have closed since Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're going to be shocked at the competitive level in this market," 
said Gene Cameron, president of BBDO/Los Angeles. "They've got to find some 
point of distinction." 
</P>
<P>
Livingston, 54, insists that his agency will do just that. He says he will 
strip most management layers and operate the Los Angeles office more as a 
"workshop." Instead of using a commission system, the office expects to write 
contracts for individual projects. Livingston said he regards this office as a 
prototype that, if successful, could be duplicated in Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
"The agency that looks, acts and smells like a law firm is passe," said 
Livingston, who plans to eventually lease space in a refurbished warehouse. 
"The days of agencies trying to look like their most prosperous clients are 
over." 
</P>
<P>
For the hundreds of laid-off agency employees in Los Angeles, Livingston's move 
is a glimmer of hope. The firm plans to hire about a dozen employees. But for 
the mass of local agencies fighting desperately for new business, the 
additional competition is hardly welcome news. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of agencies see a large pot of gold at the end of the rainbow in Los 
Angeles," said Larry Postaer, executive vice president at Rubin Postaer &amp; 
Associates. "But the funny thing is, it never rains here and there is no 
rainbow." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Livingston opened a San Francisco office that has struggled for 
business. But that has not stopped plans to move to Los Angeles. He had hoped 
to enter the market by purchasing the agency Keye/Donna/Pearlstein, a very 
creative shop that has run into a spate of bad luck over the past few years. 
Those negotiations, however, fell through. 
</P>
<P>
With annual billings of about $50 million and little room to grow in Seattle, 
Livingston decided to make the move anyway. Besides, In-N-Out Burger, its 
Baldwin Park-based client that spends $5 million annually on advertising, is 
poised for growth. 
</P>
<P>
To show he is serious about the market, Livingston will move to Los Angeles. 
"If you go into New York or Los Angeles, you'd better send the guy whose name 
is on the door," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly two decades ago, Livingston cut his teeth in the ad business in Los 
Angeles as a copywriter for what's now Chiat/Day/Mojo. He was later sent to 
Seattle to open Chiat/Day's first branch office and, in 1981, he purchased the 
unit. Now, he will be competing with Chiat/Day head-on. 
</P>
<P>
"Roger is an advertising aficionado," said Jay Chiat, Chiat/Day/Mojo chairman. 
"He'll contribute to raising the creative standards in the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
Livingston may be best known for the more than 30 TV commercials it has created 
for client Alaska Airlines over the past 12 years. Most of the spots feature 
off-the-wall examples of what can happen to people who fly other airlines. One 
ad showed a guy whose pants and shirt are literally sucked off at baggage 
check-in. Another featured a man who runs up and down the aisles of a plane 
pleading with passengers for change for the pay toilet. 
</P>
<P>
Although regarded by many peers as a bubbling optimist, Livingston can also be 
a realist. "I believe advertising is a real simple business," he said. "It's 
still a couple of guys sitting in a room dredging their minds for an original 
way to say something."

Damage Award: An Orange County Superior Court jury levied $1 million in 
punitive damages against four partners of Trammell Crow Co. for cutting a local 
brokerage out of a commission in the 1985 purchase of an Irvine office 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the jury had ruled that the partnership should pay $6 million to Lee 
&amp; Associates for fraudulently cutting it out of the $340-million sale of 
Fluor Corp. headquarters. The total award, with interest, will be $9.2 million. 
Attorneys for the partners -- William Lane Jr., Thomas A. Bailey, Joel C. 
Peterson and J. McDonald Williams -- did not comment on the verdict, which is 
expected to be appealed.

SMALL BUSINESS: FINDING THE PHOTOGRAPHER BEST FOR YOU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Jackie Lederfine, director of marketing for Franklin Brass Manufacturing Co. in 
Culver City, set out to create a trim, fold-out color brochure highlighting her 
company's bathroom accessories. 
</P>
<P>
Five months later, the project had turned into a nightmare. The agency she 
hired to do the project was not responding to her calls. She knew that she had 
a real disaster on her hands when the first set of photographs arrived for her 
review. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of our bathroom fixtures were shot upside down," Lederfine said. 
</P>
<P>
Although she insisted that the photographer reshoot some of the towel bars, 
robe hooks and tumbler holders, the photos were never quite right. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned through trial and error," said Lederfine, who asked a friend who is 
a professional photographer to help her with the brochure and give her some 
tips for future reference. 
</P>
<P>
Many small-business owners don't realize that good photographs of themselves 
and their products can be an affordable and valuable marketing tool. But most 
people have never hired a professional photographer, except to shoot a wedding, 
christening or bar mitzvah. 
</P>
<P>
"Photographs can be used in a company newsletter, to send to a trade magazine, 
for a brochure or to send to your local newspaper," said Alan Berliner, a Los 
Angeles portrait photographer who shoots pictures of many executives, 
celebrities and socialites. "Your image is really your stamp. People want to 
know what you look like." 
</P>
<P>
Savvy business owners who have a good portrait on hand are often surprised 
about the number of ways they can use the picture. Many small publications 
prefer to use material that comes with a photograph because the pictures 
brighten up the page. Every photograph you send out should be accompanied by a 
fact sheet describing yourself and your business. 
</P>
<P>
Free-lance photographer Joel Mark frequently advises and works with 
small-business owners. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I have to tell people to stop because their product isn't ready to 
be photographed," said Mark. "I also tell them that if it's ugly in reality, it 
will be ugly in the photograph." 
</P>
<P>
Because it takes much longer to set up the lights and plan the photography 
session than to actually shoot the pictures, Mark recommends asking a 
photographer to shoot several products or people at once. 
</P>
<P>
"I spent a lot of time educating business owners and explaining how to avert a 
photographic disaster," said Mark, who has a studio in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he was recently asked to shoot photographs of an upscale 
condominium project where units were listed for $350,000 to $600,000. The 
brochure was supposed to highlight the luxurious features, but because the 
condos were dirty and unfinished, Mark knew that the usual architectural photos 
wouldn't work. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he focused on the details and highlights of the floor plans, 
showcasing the best features without actually showing an overall view. 
</P>
<P>
Once you decide that you need pictures to enhance your business, finding a good 
photographer is easy, even if you live in a small town. Ask the photo editor of 
your local newspaper to recommend competent photographers who do free-lance 
work. You can also ask friends and colleagues to refer you to a photographer 
whose work they admire. 
</P>
<P>
Many local colleges offer photography classes. Try to hire the teacher, or ask 
the teacher refer you to the best students. 
</P>
<P>
When you interview photographers, ask to see current samples of their work. 
Explain exactly what kind of pictures you want and set a deadline to see the 
proof sheets and receive the final prints. If you need both black-and-white and 
color prints, have them shot at the same time to save money. 
</P>
<P>
Ask the photographer if he or she will sell you the negatives and the copyright 
or whether you will have to buy prints from them for specific uses. 
</P>
<P>
Before hiring a photographer, call a few clients and ask whether the job was 
completed satisfactorily and on time. Make sure you understand exactly what you 
will be billed for and how and when the photographer expects to be paid. 
</P>
<P>
"Looking at the photographer's work is not enough because they only want to 
show you the prettiest pictures," said Lederfine of Franklin Brass. Because 
dealing with photographers has become a significant part of her job, she has 
been going to seminars on advertising and photography. 
</P>
<P>
Although creating the point-of-purchase brochure was a major headache for 
Lederfine, she said that more than 100,000 copies are in circulation and that 
customer response has been extremely positive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meeting to Focus on Raising Capital 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
* Show the photographer ads or brochures you like to give him or her an idea of 
what you are looking for. 
</P>
<P>
* Display photos of key employees and managers so customers can get to know 
your staff. 
</P>
<P>
* Be sure to photograph any special event or promotion your company hosts. 
</P>
<P>

HOME INVADERS STRIKE AGAIN IN YORBA LINDA

Outraged city officials Thursday denounced a brutal attack by suspected Asian 
gang members and said they intend to stamp out gang activity before it takes 
root in this quiet, wealthy suburb. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want gangs in this city," Mayor William E. (Gene) Wisner said 
Thursday. " . . . It's time to put this gang stuff to a screeching halt." 
</P>
<P>
In what police have dubbed a "home invasion" robbery, three armed youths broke 
into the home of Yorba Linda physician James Lin on Wednesday. They tied up 
Lin's 14-year old daughter, and bound and pistol-whipped his wife before making 
off with an undetermined amount of cash, jewelry and other personal belongings, 
Brea Police Lt. William Lentini said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects were described as Vietnamese males in their late teens or early 
20s, all wearing identical white dress shirts and brown pants, Lentini said. 
The attack came eight weeks after masked Asian youths attacked and terrorized 
another Yorba Linda family. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 home invasion robberies have been reported in California since 
1988, and some law enforcement officials believe the attacks are becoming more 
violent. The invaders often bind, gag, beat or threaten to kill their victims, 
so terrorizing them that authorities believe many such incidents go unreported. 
</P>
<P>
The stylized attacks are often carefully planned and executed. Both the 
perpetrators and the victims are nearly always of Asian heritage. 
</P>
<P>
In Westminster and Garden Grove, where Orange County's Asian gang activity has 
been concentrated, six home invasions have been reported since August, police 
said. Several recent attacks have also been reported across Los Angeles County, 
said Westminster Police Detective Marcus Frank, who monitors Asian gang 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
"The gangs draw throughout Southern California, in both affluent and 
non-affluent areas," Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
After the Sept. 15 attack, Yorba Linda Mayor Wisner had asked the council to 
approve a $20,000 reward for information leading to arrests. City staff members 
recommended against such a move, however, saying that it would set an 
inappropriate precedent. But on Thursday, after learning of the second attack, 
Wisner and other council members said they would reconsider offering the 
$20,000 reward. 
</P>
<P>
"It's extremely frustrating for me personally, because it seems it can happen 
to anybody," said Councilman Irwin M. Fried, adding that he was meeting with 
city and police administrators to discuss the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Lentini said that at 3:45 p.m. on Wednesday, three men knocked on the door of 
Lin's Deodar Drive home, and when Gale Lin, 47, answered, they asked her if 
they could use the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Lin and her daughter) did not give permission for the suspects to enter 
until one of them convinced Mrs. Lin that they were friends of the older 
daughter," Lentini said. 
</P>
<P>
The older daughter was away at college at the time, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside, the three men drew pistols, Lentini said, and bound the hands and 
feet of the mother and daughter. 
</P>
<P>
They then began tearing up the inside of the house, overturning furniture and 
rummaging through drawers in search of jewels and other personal belongings, 
James Lin said. 
</P>
<P>
"They even tore the mattress and springs up," said Lin, 50, who has a private 
practice in Brea. After searching the home, the suspects then beat Gale Lin in 
the face with their pistols and carried the daughter into a back bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
Police were called to the scene when the daughter managed to free herself and 
climb out a window. The suspects fled after one of them spotted the daughter 
running from the back yard toward a neighbor's house. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very upset," James Lin said on Thursday. "We live in a nice, quiet 
neighborhood. Nothing happens here." 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 15, a band of Asian teen-agers stormed into a home, tying up five 
members of a Chinese family and pistol-whipping the mother before fleeing with 
jewelry. Suspects in that attack were never identified, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"The kind of M.O. that was used is certainly consistent with activities of 
certain Asian gangs," Brea Police Chief Don Forkus said. "There are certainly 
some strong similarities, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Forkus said that both attacks seem to have been well planned and that the 
attackers knew something about each family. The only marked difference is that 
the suspects wore masks in the first crime. 
</P>
<P>
"They were specifically targeted for the crime," Forkus said, suggesting that 
the attackers may have befriended the older daughter some time earlier, perhaps 
to make it easier to get into the house. 
</P>
<P>
"This was not a crime of happenstance," Forkus said. "They deliberately sought 
out people." 
</P>
<P>
Even before they learned of the second attack, City Council members Wednesday 
night had authorized a "We Tip" hot-line reward of $1,000 for information about 
the September attack. Citizens are asked to call (800) 472-7766. 
</P>
<P>
City and police officials have said that some Asian-Americans, who may fear 
reprisals, have been reluctant to cooperate with police investigating the 
robberies.

PASSING THE BUCKS: The grand jury testimony released last week reveals a new 
side to the way Charles Keating handled money. . . . An employee testified that 
soon after Keating bought now-defunct Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, he gathered 
employees at the Irvine office to present bonuses. Keating walked in with about 
$30,000 in $100 and $50 bills and threw the cash into the air. . . . "It was 
later divided up, and each was given $100," the employee testified. . . . 
Keating's lawyers are back in court today to ask that securities fraud charges 
against him be dismissed. Laura Michaelis and Dallas M. Jackson

NEWPORT MUST PAY $300,000 TO VICTIM OF POLICE SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A federal jury Thursday awarded $300,000 to a man who was shot in the back by a 
Newport Beach police officer, the second time in six months that the city will 
have to pay a substantial sum to a person shot by one of its officers. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Patrick Miller, 28, was awarded $200,000 compensatory damages and 
$100,000 in punitive damages against Officer Jun Payoyo. Miller charged in his 
lawsuit that Payoyo acted negligently and violated his constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach City Atty. Robert Burnham said the city was "disappointed" with 
the jury's decision and will discuss a possible appeal at its next council 
meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham added that the damages were the largest awarded by a jury against a 
Newport Beach police officer in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, however, city officials agreed to pay $1.5 million in an 
out-of-court settlement to a man who was shot and critically wounded by another 
police officer who mistook the victim's portable radio for a sawed-off shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
That settlement, paid to Sundaga Bryant, 27, for the Sept. 4, 1988, shooting, 
represents the largest amount the city has paid for a police-related lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest case, Miller's attorney, Douglas Applegate, argued during the 
weeklong trial that his client was intentionally shot by Payoyo on the morning 
of Jan. 23, 1988, near 39th Street and West Balboa Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Applegate was unavailable for comment after the jury's decision. 
</P>
<P>
Payoyo's attorneys contended that Miller, a known felon, was stopped by Payoyo 
during a routine investigation of a string of burglaries that had occurred in 
the area. As the officer led Miller to his patrol car, Miller got scared and 
fled from Payoyo, attorneys from both side said. 
</P>
<P>
After a lengthy chase, Payoyo caught up to Miller, who started wrestling with 
the officer, causing his gun to accidentally discharge, Burnham said. 
</P>
<P>
The bullet entered Miller's back, punctured his right lung, exited through his 
chest and left one of his arms partially paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that the shooting was an accident," Burnham said following 
the jury's decision. 
</P>
<P>
He said the city had been dropped as a defendant before the trial, but will 
assume financial responsibility for Payoyo.

3 YOUNG BOYS HIT BY CAR IN BUSY STREET; 
</P>

ACCIDENT: SIX-YEAR-OLDS WERE RETURNING TO THEIR PRIVATE SCHOOL FROM A NEARBY

Three young boys returning from an outing in the park with their schoolteacher 
were seriously injured Thursday evening when they were struck by a car while 
crossing a busy street near their school, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred at about 5:20 p.m. as nine first- and second-graders were 
returning to Fairmont Private School, at 4757 Valley View Ave., from Valley 
View Youth Park, a small area within Hurless Barton Park, across the street, 
Brea Police Lt. Cliff Trimble said. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified teacher was at the head of a single line of students and had 
just crossed the southbound lanes of Valley View Avenue in a section of the 
street not marked by a crosswalk when the last three children in line, all 
6-year-old boys, were struck by a car. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the children were taken by paramedics to UCI Medical Center in Orange 
and were being treated for "critical trauma" injuries, according to Michele 
Palmer, a dispatcher for the Orange County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
The third child was taken to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana and was listed in 
serious condition, Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the victims were identified. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the vehicle, a late model Camaro, was taken to police 
headquarters for questioning and then released. 
</P>
<P>
Trimble said the accident was under investigation but would not say whether the 
driver might be charged. 
</P>
<P>
The accident shocked teachers and students at the school, a private academy 
that offers preschool through second-grade education. 
</P>
<P>
School director Lynn Thatcher said it is a part of the daily school regimen for 
teachers to take their students to the park for a play period. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher said students are commonly escorted across the street to the park, 
which is directly opposite the school, even though there is no marked 
crosswalk. The closest crosswalk is about 100 yards north of the school near 
Orange Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents and business owners near the school said traffic conditions can 
be hazardous at dusk because vision is obscured by a glare from lights on 
playing fields at the park. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a difficult time to see, and cars are always speeding through here," said 
Michael Castillo, who owns a video-production business near the school. 
</P>
<P>
Castillo, a Corona resident, said his 3-year-old son attends the private 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen them cross the street before. They look like little ducks all lined 
up behind the mother duck," he said. "They are very careful; it's a routine." 
</P>
<P>
However, Castillo's wife, Jettie, said many residents have worried that an 
accident might occur. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, something will be done because of this to make it more safe," she 
said. "We all walk across that street and I know that cars go too fast."

DANA PARSONS: SHATTERED PEACE . . . AND THE DOGGED PURSUIT OF A RAPIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Like countless other streets in Orange County, Avenida Presidio in San Clemente 
winds slowly up into what once was a hillside but is now a full-grown 
residential tract. When the Broadmore area was built up 15 years ago, it 
offered the California dream: a house you could afford and elevated views of 
the Pacific Ocean once thought to be the sole province of the rich. The notion 
of isolation was built right into the Broadmore plan -- most of the streets 
were "single-loaded," meaning homes were built on only one side of the street 
with the natural terrace of the hill on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
A walk through the Broadmore neighborhoods on a weekday morning still seems 
more like a stroll across the canvas of a still-life painting -- the quiet in 
the streets is deafening, the sense of solace reassuring, the views of the 
Pacific inspiring. It's easy to imagine that residents who make the gentle 
climb up Avenida Presidio from Avenida Pico and into Broadmore think they're 
being delivered into a secluded, tranquil world removed from the madness below. 
</P>
<P>
It's now Police Detective Gary Logalvo's job to find out who made that climb up 
Avenida Presidio last weekend, not to escape the madness but to bring it with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Around 8:30 last Saturday night, a man rang the doorbell of a house in 
Broadmore. As a 13-year-old girl approached, the man burst in, bound and gagged 
her, and raped her. The girl was home alone, and the man ran off when the 
girl's mother returned a few minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
About a month earlier, a 29-year-old woman was kidnaped off the street in the 
same general part of San Clemente and driven to an apartment where she was 
sexually assaulted but not raped. 
</P>
<P>
Logalvo, a 13-year veteran of the San Clemente Police Department, believes that 
the same man committed both assaults. He's now doing all he can to get to know 
him. 
</P>
<P>
It's probably not happening fast enough for the citizens of San Clemente, which 
has a relatively low crime rate among cities in the county and which has 
averaged only one or two rapes a year. 
</P>
<P>
Logalvo is now trapped in that world of pleasure and pain that detectives live 
in. Like the rest of us, they don't like to see someone brutalized by a crime; 
on the other hand, once it's done, the thrill of the hunt for the criminal is 
the reason they're in the business. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to get a sense of who he is, what he is, why he does what he does," 
Logalvo says. 
</P>
<P>
The assailant obviously knows the cat-and-mouse game with police has begun. "He 
knows somebody is on his trail looking for him," Logalvo said Thursday in a 
room where police have scratched notes on a big board to compare the two 
crimes. "I think he will try to do it again." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Logalvo has followed up leads that vaporized before his eyes. 
Dozens of tips have been pursued and then abandoned because they fizzled. One 
that looked too good to be true proved to be just that when the trail led to 
someone already in jail. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean Logalvo has no idea of whom he's seeking. 
</P>
<P>
"He probably seems very normal. He probably has a job, he probably works with 
other people, he's out there mingling with people, gets along with people. But 
in the back of his mind, he's got this black spot." 
</P>
<P>
The young girl wasn't much help because she only saw the man for a split 
second, Logalvo said. The victim of the other assault is mentally retarded and 
was also blindfolded through much of her ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
But police know they're looking for a white man of average build, believed to 
be in his 20s. For now, that'll have to do for Logalvo. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I've got him focused as to what he looks like, possibly what he 
does, and I feel if I get real close, I'll know it's him." 
</P>
<P>
This rapist has some traits that intrigue Logalvo. "With most rapists, there's 
either the threat of force, or they use force and beat on their victims. This 
one is very cool, calm; he's not really offensive. He just ties them up, nice 
and easy, blindfolds and gags them, and does his thing. There's no foul 
language. Rape is a crime of violence, not a sex thing, but there's been no 
violent assaults with these two (assaults)." 
</P>
<P>
The rule of thumb for cops is not to get personally involved in a case. It's a 
rule Logalvo tries to abide by. "I still go home after work and do my normal 
things," Logalvo says. "But I'm still thinking about it when I'm relaxing or 
watching TV. There are some things you don't block out; you just don't." The 
residents of Broadmore probably don't want him to block it out. Not until peace 
is restored to their once-quiet sanctuary in the hills.

HUNTINGTON BEACH

<TEXT>
<P>
Debbie Cook sat outside her home Thursday in northwest Huntington Beach. On her 
lap were a pad and legal documents. 
</P>
<P>
A frown crossed her face. Despite the historic passage of a beach and parks 
preservation law Tuesday, she fears pro-development forces on the City Council 
will try to get around the voter mandate and build on beach and bluff land. 
</P>
<P>
"The people don't want it," she said. "Look at that vote on Tuesday. People 
don't want more buildings on the beach." 
</P>
<P>
Cook was referring to the voters' 3-1 passage of Measure C, a City Charter 
amendment that forbids sale or lease of park or beach land without a citywide 
vote. The citizens' initiative, only the second in Huntington Beach's 81-year 
history, swept to victory despite a determined counterattack by the City 
Council majority and representatives of major developers. 
</P>
<P>
The grass-roots victory has been hailed by environmentalists around the county. 
And it has also focused political attention on Cook, the key person behind 
Measure C. Praised by friends as being courageous and indefatigable, she is 
scorned by political enemies, who accuse her of being elitist and radical. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always wondered where she's coming from," said Tom Duchene, executive 
vice president of a commercial mailing service who led the opposition to 
Measure C. "Some of her talk is more like the People's Republic of Santa Monica 
than Huntington Beach." 
</P>
<P>
Added Councilman John Erskine: "I think there's a certain degree of elitism 
about her proposals." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Councilman Peter Green and Councilwoman Grace Winchell praise her 
leadership in fighting for park preservation and against many development 
projects. "People have no idea how much time she gives of herself and how 
thankless it is," Winchell once said of Cook. 
</P>
<P>
Who, then, is Debbie Cook? For starters, she is a 36-year-old manufacturers' 
representative, housewife and mother who had never been actively involved in 
politics before September, 1989. She grew up in Newport Beach, graduated from 
Corona del Mar High School and obtained a geology degree from Cal State Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been involved in politics before," she said Thursday. "In college, 
I was more interested in volleyball and hiking." 
</P>
<P>
But last year, Cook -- who uses her maiden name -- and her husband, John 
Fisher, became alarmed by City Council plans to convert a rough-hewn part of 
Central Park into a commercial golf course. Cook, Fisher and their 14-year-old 
son, Jody, live in a new home in Country View Estates, a subdivision near 
Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
Cook and Fisher met with other residents of the Ellis-Golden West streets area. 
They decided to form an organization, called Save Our Parks, to block the lease 
of parkland for a golf course. Save Our Parks had no formal president or 
chairman, but Cook served as its spokeswoman and political lightning rod. 
</P>
<P>
"We became concerned because the city had so many development proposals 
affecting parks and beaches," she said. "Pierside Village is the big reason we 
decided to seek a City Charter amendment." 
</P>
<P>
Pierside Village is a long-proposed plan to build some new restaurants on paved 
land abutting the beach at the pier in downtown Huntington Beach. Supporters, 
including the city's Board of Realtors, say it would be an attractive addition 
to downtown. Critics, including Save Our Parks, Huntington Beach Tomorrow and 
other environmental groups, claim the plan would ruin the view of the beach and 
hamper public access to it. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Green and Winchell, both foes of Pierside Village, supported 
Save Our Parks from the beginning. They tried to get the rest of the 
seven-member council to put a Charter amendment on the ballot but failed. 
Opponents said it would be "good experience" for Save Our Parks to "test the 
waters" by having to seek voters' signatures for an initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Initiatives seldom qualify for the ballot in Huntington Beach. "There have only 
been two to make it to the ballot in the city's history," noted City Clerk 
Connie Brockway. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Save Our Parks last fall began its street-corner efforts to get 
16,000 voter signatures and to get a parks and beaches proposal on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
By June, when the petition was turned in, Save Our Parks believed it had more 
than enough valid signatures. But a check by the county registrar of voters 
office found duplications. Cook was told that the petition had failed. "That 
was a dark day," she recalled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Something unexpected then happened. City Clerk Brockway began poring over the 
state lawbooks. "Sometimes the statutes are slightly differently worded," 
Brockway said. 
</P>
<P>
Brockway found an obscure section of state law that requires fewer voter 
signatures for a proposed City Charter amendment than for a regular initiative. 
Brockway notified the city attorney, who double-checked the law and agreed. The 
initiative was saved. "Connie Brockway is the best city clerk in the world," 
Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
After making its cliff-hanging way to the ballot, the initiative became Measure 
C. Then, the City Council majority decided to put a rival issue, Measure D, on 
the ballot. It would have only prohibited the sale of park and beach land -- 
not leasing of such property. Cook said Measure D was a "developers' sham" and 
an "attempt to confuse the voters." 
</P>
<P>
Some developer money did go into the Measure D campaign, but the issue failed 
to get as many votes Tuesday as Measure C. City Atty. Gail Hutton said that 
Measure C thus becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said the battle is not over, and that developers are still pushing the 
City Council majority to try to ramrod Pierside Village to final approval. She 
said the developers are arguing that Measure C has not yet been certified. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been told by our attorneys, however, that certification is only a 
technicality and that the measure is effective the date it was passed," Cook 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Cook added, Save Our Parks will be vigilant about enforcing the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
Does the success of Measure C now mean that Cook will seek an elective office? 
She laughed at the question. "No way," she said. "I have no interest in that." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher, her husband, said there is a good reason Cook eschews running for 
office. "Debbie has found out she can do more just as private citizen," Fisher 
said.

In fiscal year 1989, ending in September 1918, Orange County was the seventh 
most popular distination for newly-arrived legal immigrants. Last year, 15,759 
people came here from more than 30 countries. 
</P>
<P>
The majority, however, were from just fourn places: Vietnam (26%), Mexico 
(13%), Korea (8%) and the Philippines (7%). The 1989 total was a 12% increase 
from 1988, which had an 8% increase from 1987. Here's a look at the numbers 
from each country last year:

'ROUTINE' STOP NETS JEWEL THEFT SUSPECTS

<P>
Two California Highway Patrol officers making a routine traffic stop Thursday 
morning arrested a pair of Los Angeles men in connection with a La Jolla 
jewelry store burglary. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Darrington and Kevin Smith, both 24, were arrested on suspicion of 
burglary about 4:30 a.m., half an hour after they were stopped for speeding on 
the San Diego Freeway, CHP Officer Patti Gentile said. 
</P>
<P>
The two were later turned over to the San Diego Police Department, which is 
investigating the early-morning looting of Bailey, Banks &amp; Biddle Jewelers, 
where about $50,000 worth of jewelry was stolen, Gentile said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers "made a speed stop and one thing led to another," Gentile said. 
</P>
<P>
Patrolmen Steve Young and Mike Clare spotted a white, 1988 Nissan Sentra 
speeding north at the Pacific Coast Highway exit. The car was traveling about 
80 m.p.h., Gentile said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers pulled the car over at the Avery Parkway off-ramp. One of the 
officers who approached the Nissan noticed two pillowcases full of jewelry on 
the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the burglary charge, Darrington, the driver, was cited for 
speeding and not wearing a seat belt, Gentile said. Smith was also ticketed for 
not wearing a seat belt. JAMES M. GOMEZ

Although votes for write-in candidate Wally Linn have not been fully tabulated, 
incumbents Larry A. Herman and Orbrey Duke are claiming victory after this 
week's election. 
</P>
<P>
The top vote-getter was Duke, a retired chief of police, followed by Herman. 
</P>
<P>
Challengers Christian Basquette and Kenneth Tipton finished in third and fourth 
place in the race for two open seats. 
</P>
<P>
The county registrar of voters won't finish counting Linn's votes until 
Tuesday. Linn, 51, is seen as a possible threat to the incumbents by some 
political observers. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is going to be waiting anxiously for the count," said Linn a real 
estate broker. "I am certainly optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
However, Herman disagreed. "I don't think it will be a factor. I am looking 
forward to another four years." 
</P>
<P>
Tipton, a controversial former councilman who resigned his seat in 1986 after 
being censured by the council, ran an on-again off-again campaign. In early 
October he announced that he was pulling out of the race, only to resume his 
campaign a few weeks later. However, his name remained on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Never really serious about his candidacy, Basquette, 21, said he was running 
because he wanted to do more than vote.LYNDA NATALI

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; 
</P>
<P>
NEW COUNCILMAN TO LEAVE SCHOOL BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert L. Richardson's successful bid for a seat on the City Council has 
resulted in a vacancy on the Santa Ana Unified School District Board of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson, who has served on the seven-member school board since 1987, won a 
council seat by defeating incumbent Councilman Ron May. Richardson will begin 
his four-year term on the council on Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
The board will decide on Tuesday whether to fill the vacancy by appointment or 
special election, said Diane Thomas, district spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
A special election would cost the district about $49,000, according to Doug 
Mitchell of the county registrar of voters office. 
</P>
<P>
If the board decides to appoint a successor for Richardson, it will begin 
accepting applications immediately, Thomas said.

COURT OPINION TO BE ASKED ON RIDGELINE LAW;

<P>
LAGUNA NIGUEL: SOME RESIDENTS CLAIM THAT THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE WOULD AFFECT 
THEIR RIGHT TO BUILD.

<P>
The City Council late Thursday night voted to ask a Superior Court to 
"invalidate" an ordinance proposed by residents to protect the city's last 
remaining ridgelines. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 2 to 0, with two abstentions and one council member absent, 
to ask the court to support the council in its decision not to take action on 
the Ridgeline Protection and Preservation Ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Thomas Wilson and Larry Porter voted in favor of the motion, while 
Mayor Patricia Bates and Councilman James Krembas abstained, citing their 
ownership of ridgeline property as a conflict of interest. Councilman Paul M. 
Christiansen was absent. 
</P>
<P>
The vote followed 3 1/2 hours of testimony by some of the more than 400 
residents who turned out for the special council session. 
</P>
<P>
According to the city staff, the council had three choices on the issue: Adopt 
the ridgeline ordinance without change, submit it to city voters at a future 
election, or seek a court opinion on its constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the city had decided on the third option "to remove the cloud that 
now exists over the city." 
</P>
<P>
During the council session held at the YMCA gymnasium on Crown Valley Parkway, 
the attorney for Las Vegas casino owner Jack B. Binion said that the Las Vegas 
union that has assisted some residents in promoting the proposed Ridgeline 
Protection and Preservation Ordinance has agreed to withdraw from the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International was involved in a 
bitter seven-month labor dispute with Binion, who owns the Horseshoe Club 
casino in Las Vegas and 22 acres of land on ridgeline in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
Binion's attorney William C. Holzwarth said the union and Binion had settled 
their labor dispute earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the settlement, union officials have agreed to pull out of the city 
and to divulge to Binion who was in involved in the original ridgeline 
community. Binion will pass on the information to the city and to the Orange 
County district attorney's office, which is investigating the matter, Holzwarth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Ridgeline Protection Committee, the proponents of the 
initiative, boycotted the hearing, with its chairman, Richard Taylor, calling 
the meeting a "political spectacle." 
</P>
<P>
More than 4,000 residents have signed a petition supporting the Ridgeline 
Protection and Preservation Ordinance, which would prohibit building on the 
city's dwindling ridges without voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
Other residents have protested, saying the proposed law would affect individual 
lot owners in partially developed communities, such as Bear Brand Ranch and 
Monarch Point. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 2, the council voted 2-1 to delay action until another hearing could be 
held. Proponents criticized the delay, saying the normal procedure for 
initiatives under state law would have been to either approve the ordinance or 
put it to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the Oct. 2 session, all council members except Christiansen, who 
supports the measure, were presented with recall notices. Christiansen was 
presented with a recall notice at a later council session. 
</P>
<P>
To encourage public participation in Thursday night's meeting, the city bought 
full-page newspaper advertisements in local newspapers, mailed notices to 
15,000 property owners and rented 500 chairs at a total cost of $9,000, City 
Clerk Juanita Zarilla said. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Rose, the leader of the recall effort against four of the council 
members, stood outside the entrance of the building and asked residents to sign 
his recall petition. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a trumped-up meeting," Rose said. "All these people here have been put 
together by the City Council to deny the people of Laguna Niguel their 
constitutional right to vote." 
</P>
<P>
Inside, speaker after speaker spoke out against the ordinance, saying that it 
would affect their right to build on their property. 
</P>
<P>
The city staff has predicted that the ordinance could have a much wider impact, 
possibly affecting more than 1,000 existing homes citywide.

MAN IN CUSTODY AFTER PELLET RIFLE INCIDENT;

An 18-year-old San Juan Capistrano man who allegedly pointed a pellet gun at 
motorists on Interstate 5 at the La Paz Road exit was taken into custody 
Thursday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured during the incident, which occurred on the dirt embankment 
south of the La Paz Road off-ramp, and it was not certain whether the man 
actually fired his weapon at any of the passing cars, California Highway Patrol 
Officer Gary Alfonso said. 
</P>
<P>
Alfonso said a highway patrolman fired his weapon toward the suspect when he 
was taken into custody, but no one was hit. 
</P>
<P>
Alfonso said CHP officers received a call about 11:50 a.m. from a motorist 
reporting that a man was walking along the embankment pointing a rifle at 
southbound traffic. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officers and Orange County sheriff's deputies surrounded the suspect, 
identified as Isauro Gonzalez Giles, after a short foot pursuit and ordered him 
at gunpoint to drop his weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Giles, 18, complied with the officers' order but then, for unknown reasons, 
made a move to pick up his weapon again, officers at the scene said. Before 
Giles could grab the rifle, a CHP officer identified as Toni Kodera fired one 
round in the suspect's direction, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Giles later told investigators that he was walking along the embankment 
"shooting at birds," Sheriff's Department Lt. Richard J. Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
Olson said Giles, who had not been booked late Thursday, could face a charge of 
suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon. Giles' weapon was later determined 
to be a pellet rifle, Olson said, adding that no motorists have reported being 
hit by pellets.

COUNTY'S PROPOSED JAIL BOOKING FEE OF $183 DRAWS ANGER FROM CITIES; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: STATE SLASHES FORCE THE COUNTY TO RECOVER THE 'FULL COST' OF JAILING 
PRISONERS. BUT CIVIC LAYOFFS AND POLICE CUTS MAY RESULT.

<TEXT>
<P>
Representatives of several Orange County cities emerged from a tense session 
with county budget officials Thursday complaining that a proposed jail booking 
fee would force layoffs and serious cutbacks in city services, including police 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a financial disaster," said Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young, who 
did not attend the meeting but was told of the county proposal. "It would 
result in complete chaos in our Police Department and would force layoffs at a 
time when we've been adding officers." 
</P>
<P>
"This would not only be a financial disaster for the city of Santa Ana, but it 
would create a public safety crisis in Orange County," added Young, whose 
concerns were echoed by outraged officials in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
If the fee is approved by county supervisors in January, city and school 
district police will for the first time have to pay for booking suspects into 
county jails. And though city and county officials have discussed such a fee 
for months, the county has developed new cost estimates that have increased the 
proposed fee from $75.50 per inmate to $183. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana, which would be hit hardest by the proposal, would lose more than $3 
million over a full year, according to the county estimate presented to city 
officials Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But Young said the cost would be more than twice that because county officials 
underestimate the number of suspects Santa Ana places behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana's police budget for this year is about $40 million. Young said the 
city would lose about 20% of that if a $183 booking fee is imposed. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the $183 figure was developed, city officials were in uproar and 
had banded together to resist the new fee under the banner of what they called 
Operation Budget Freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, after they received official word of the proposed higher figure, some 
city officials were angered and demanded answers for how the cost estimates had 
jumped so dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. said: "I'm not going to stand still for 
losing police officers or cutting services in our community because the county 
has been hit with a cut in its budget from the state. I can't understand this. 
They need to justify this to us." 
</P>
<P>
Robert F. Dinsen, a councilman from Garden Grove, said layoffs, salary cuts and 
the loss of a fire station could be the price that his city would pay if 
slapped with the fee. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have a devastating effect on the city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have been sympathetic to those concerns, but they face huge 
budget problems of their own, many of them caused by the state. Without some 
sort of fee, the county could be forced to consider layoffs, the postponement 
of a long-sought earthquake safety renovation or other cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
The jail booking fee arises from this year's budget debate in Sacramento. 
Desperate to make up a huge shortfall, the state government dramatically 
slashed funding for counties in its 1990-91 budget. To make up for the funding 
it took away from counties, the state allowed them to begin charging fees for 
jail booking and other things. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new state law, counties are allowed to recover the "full cost" of 
booking. Orange County officials, who have spent the past several weeks 
studying the cost of placing inmates into the jail system, now estimate that 
$183 per inmate would represent recovery of full costs, including medical 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand that they (county officials) have a budget problem, but this is 
crazy," said Bill Hodge, executive director of the Orange County division of 
the League of Cities. "We want to try to help out, but first we were talking 
about $75.50, and that was bad enough. Now staff's saying that the real number 
is 2 1/2 times that." 
</P>
<P>
Hodge added that city officials are confronting many of the same fiscal 
problems faced by the county. 
</P>
<P>
"They talk about the slowdown in the economy and the rising price of energy," 
Hodge said. "But we have the same problems. It's not like city cars don't run 
on gasoline." 
</P>
<P>
Vicki Stewart, an official in the county administrative office and one of those 
who represented the county at Thursday's meeting, declined to comment on the 
session. 
</P>
<P>
"We're negotiating with them, and I'm not at liberty to release any 
information," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Other officials who attended the meeting, however, provided a copy of a county 
document estimating the revenue that could be generated from imposing the fee. 
All told, the $183-per-inmate levy would raise $9.7 million for the county over 
one year, according to county projections. 
</P>
<P>
If imposed in January and not made retroactive to July 1, the fee could add 
$4.8 million to this year's strapped county budget and could help save several 
embattled programs. But while that money would help the county out of a 
difficult impasse, city officials say that the cost to their programs could be 
devastating. 
</P>
<P>
For some city officials, particularly troublesome is the concern that the 
county may be artificially inflating its costs to give supervisors bargaining 
room when they consider the matter in January. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a possibility we have contemplated and that we have met to talk about," 
Brady said. "All I can say is I hope they're not playing games with us." 
</P>
<P>
Times correspondent Jon Nalick contributed to this report.

</P>
<P>
IMPACT OF JAIL BOOKING FEES 
</P>
<P>
County budget officials want to charge cities for every suspect they place in 
the Orange County jail system. To recover all costs, the fee would be $183 per 
inmate, county officials say. City officials said that would cripple their law 
enforcement budgets. At $183 per booking, fees for 22 county cities would 
amount to:

PSYCHIATRIST CALLS RAPE SUSPECT UNFIT FOR TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Beverly Hills policeman accused of raping an 11-year-old Irvine girl 
suffers from manic depression, which for years has caused erratic behavior and 
delusions that he is being pursued by enemies, a psychiatrist testified 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Based on examinations he performed in July, Dr. Stephen M. Petty said Steven 
Rush McCoy, 36, is not able to stand trial because he cannot recall his 
whereabouts during the March 26 incident or help his attorney prepare a 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
Petty's testimony came during a pretrial hearing in Municipal Court in Newport 
Beach, where a jury will decide whether McCoy is competent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy, who worked for two years in the Beverly Hills Police Department in the 
late 1970s, has pleaded not guilty to the charges of rape, sexual assault and 
burglary. 
</P>
<P>
Petty told the jury that during visits at the Orange County Jail, McCoy was 
showing signs of manic behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"He said that if he could just be released from jail, he could prove his 
innocence like something in a TV show," Petty said. "There wasn't much emotion. 
He wasn't able to connect with it (criminal charges). His ability to work with 
his attorney is significantly impaired; his memory is impaired; his perceptions 
are impaired." 
</P>
<P>
In responding to questions by Deputy Dist. Atty. Debbie Lloyd, Petty said it 
was possible McCoy possessed the ability to seduce medical professionals into 
thinking he was incompetent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
When the hearing resumes Wednesday, Lloyd said, she will ask Dr. Kaushal K. 
Sharma, a Newport Beach psychiatrist, to present results of his examination of 
McCoy which reportedly will indicate that the defendant is competent to stand 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd said Sharma's examination was conducted July 8, one day after Petty's 
examination. 
</P>
<P>
McCoy was experiencing hallucinations while under his care in January of last 
year, Petty said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was believing people were trying to harm him," Petty said, adding that 
McCoy was hospitalized for a month during that time. "These were actual beliefs 
that could not be shaken." 
</P>
<P>
In a jail interview shortly after his arrest, McCoy proclaimed his innocence, 
telling reporters that law officers should "be looking for the suspect over at 
the San Diego Zoo in the orangutan section." 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever did this," he said then, "was an animal."

MIKE PENNER: EARTH MOVES, BUT NO TEAM COMES FORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE PENNER

<TEXT>
<P>
The gold-plated spades dug into the earth, but they might as well have been 
shoveling cash. One hundred million dollars for the construction and operation 
of Anaheim Arena. They weren't just breaking ground Thursday, they were 
breaking the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Rest assured, this will be no white elephant. That's what the Anaheim Arena 
planners, with no NBA or NHL franchise in tow or in sight, kept telling the 
congregation at the corner of Douglass and Katella, where Thursday morning's 
kickoff ceremonies were held. 
</P>
<P>
No, the color scheme also includes beige and green. 
</P>
<P>
Happy talk and gaudy promises made the rounds, along with plastic cups of 
orange juice-and-champagne -- just as tasty, and just as disposable. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel very confident that we'll have both hockey and basketball franchises 
by the time we're ready to open," said Neil Papiano, project coordinator for 
Ogden Corp., the financial heavy hitter in this operation. "We are currently in 
intense discussions with existing teams in both sports." 
</P>
<P>
"The teams are coming," proclaimed Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter. "The economics 
are here, the standard of living. The economics are crying out for professional 
hockey and basketball teams in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
"We're in an absolutely great market," said Anaheim City Manager Jim Ruth. "One 
franchise will get us very close to breaking even. With two, we'll make money 
from Day 1. The Ogden and Nederlander corporations wouldn't be putting up $100 
million if they weren't optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
Optimism and realism, though, live in different time zones, and getting there 
from here won't be easy. The NBA has just completed its latest round of 
expansion, having added four teams the previous two years. The Clippers are 
apparently set on a long-term living arrangement with Los Angeles. And on the 
risk scale, the idea of three NBA teams competing for the same Southland dollar 
ranks right there with the Denver Nugget defense. 
</P>
<P>
Hockey is a difficult proposition, too, what with the NHL's eye-popping 
expansion fee of $50 million. Why, for the cost of two expansion teams, you 
could buy another Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
But an interesting presence at the arena groundbreaking was Bruce McNall, owner 
of the Los Angeles Kings and member of the NHL's expansion board. McNall is the 
Johnny Appleseed of West Coast hockey. Tired of the isolation in the California 
hinterlands, McNall lobbied hard for the San Jose Sharks, who begin operation 
next season. He'd also like another West Coast rival, preferably in San Diego, 
but in a pinch, he could be talked into Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"The game plan of the NHL is to add seven teams by the year 2000," McNall said. 
"I'm in favor, definitely, to expand to the West Coast. This is a bit close to 
home, but we have to take a look into it. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is certainly there. I'm friendly with all the people at Ogden. I 
think we can work out an agreement on the territorial rights." 
</P>
<P>
Therein lies a major obstacle for Anaheim in its pursuit of the pro franchise, 
be it hockey or basketball. As owner of the Kings, McNall could block any 
proposed move into Anaheim. Likewise, Laker owner Jerry Buss could block a 
similar move by the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
Now, here's the catch. 
</P>
<P>
Buss is an applicant for the San Diego/Orange County NHL entry. McNall would 
like to add an NBA team to his collection. 
</P>
<P>
They soon could be in position to scratch each other's back. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a situation in the New York area where people are supporting three 
teams -- the Nets, the Knicks and Philly," McNall said. "It's possible here, 
too. I might personally look into it. It would depend on Jerry Buss granting 
the territorial rights." 
</P>
<P>
Right after, of course, McNall grants Buss the territorial rights. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain possibilities there," McNall said, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
McNall still has doubts about the hockey end of the deal. He knows this is no 
hockey hotbed. His Kings play to sellout crowds now, but it took an 
extraordinary measure -- trading for Wayne Gretzky -- to get it done. 
</P>
<P>
There's only one Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
Are there another 20,000 hockey fans out there? 
</P>
<P>
"That's a question," McNall conceded. "I don't know for sure. Maybe it would 
help with a rivalry situation. Would a rivalry help us attendance-wise once 
Gretzky's gone? 
</P>
<P>
"I still have to look into season-ticket applications, printouts, demographics 
-- to see what kind of impact it would have on the L.A. market. Right now, 
roughly 20 to 25% of our fans come from Orange County. That's some significant 
support. 
</P>
<P>
"Would we miss it? That's something I have to take a look at." 
</P>
<P>
Some factors recently have moved in Anaheim's favor. The stiff $50-million fee 
has scared off one prime expansion site, Milwaukee, and is currently shaking 
some knees in Seattle. San Diego is having trouble putting together the land 
deal for a new arena. 
</P>
<P>
If blind zeal means anything, Anaheim could have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
It had better hope so. According to Ruth, Anaheim Arena will need to schedule a 
minimum of 162 dates per year to break even. With no hockey or basketball, how 
many WWF cards can you book? 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Arena is expected to open in March of 1993. It is expected to be state 
of the art, with lean architectural lines, a sleek arching entrance and plush 
private suites. 
</P>
<P>
Will it be all dressed up, with nothing to show?

WESTMINSTER MAKES HILL WAIT FOR RECORD

SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The season ended Thursday night for Santa Ana High School's football team, not 
with a record for its coach and cheers from its fans but with hands on hips and 
heads hanging low. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana was trying to give Coach Dick Hill his 192nd career victory, an 
Orange County record. 
</P>
<P>
But Santa Ana couldn't stop Westminster quarterback Matt Bailey, who threw 
three touchdown passes and ran for a fourth score to lead the Lions to a 27-7 
victory at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Westminster (5-4-1, 4-1-1) clinched second place and a berth in the Southern 
Section Division I playoffs, which begin next week. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, who has coached in Orange County for 25 seasons, the last seven at Santa 
Ana, has a county mark of 191-82-3. He remains tied with former Loara Coach 
Herb Hill (no relation). 
</P>
<P>
"Every win is great. I've had 191 and I've enjoyed every one," Hill said. "The 
losses I hate. So I hated this loss." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana, which stayed close only until halftime, ends its season 3-7, 2-4 in 
Sunset League play. The mark tied Hill's worst at Santa Ana, in 1984, his first 
at the school after four years away from coaching. Hill also coached at Santa 
Ana Valley from 1959-79. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew Santa Ana would be emotionally high," said Stan Clark, Westminster 
coach. "We had to be just as high. Bailey matured a lot tonight. He showed a 
lot of poise." 
</P>
<P>
Bailey completed six of 12 passes for 86 yards and touchdowns of eight and 21 
yards to tight end Eric Wilkins and 20 yards to Enrique Gonzalez. He also ran 
eight yards around left end for another touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
After trailing, 6-0, Santa Ana rallied for a 7-6 lead on Kevin Pola's one-yard 
dive and Gus Plasencia's extra point. But Westminster took the lead for good on 
Bailey's 21-yard scoring pass to Wilkins with 15 seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana could scratch out just 19 yards of offense in the second half as 
Westminster's defense, tough all game, belted the Saints' running backs 
repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
Pola, who had 38 yards in 11 carries by halftime, finished with 36 yards in 15 
carries. Dasy Tech had 35 yards in three carries, including a 24-yard gain, the 
longest of the game for Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas Jones rushed for 98 yards in 16 carries and Vance Senteno had 53 yards in 
six carries for Westminster.

CANYON TAKES ADVANTAGE OF SECOND CHANCE

Canyon High School wrecked Santa Ana Valley's hopes for an automatic Southern 
Section Division III playoff bid with a 16-7 upset of the Falcons Thursday 
night at Fred Kelly Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The loss dropped Santa Ana Valley to fifth in the Century League and ended the 
Falcons' hopes of tying Orange (2-1-1) for third. 
</P>
<P>
Their only hope of advancing is the one wild-card berth in the 16-team draw. 
</P>
<P>
With just under nine minutes to play and Santa Ana Valley leading, 7-6, the 
game's pivotal play came on fourth down and 11 when Canyon's Greg Lawrence 
shanked a 41-yard field-goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
But officials flagged Santa Ana Valley (4-4-2, 1-3-1) for an unsportsmanlike 
conduct penalty on the play, giving Canyon (4-6, 2-3) a first down at the 12. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen a call like that," Santa Ana Valley Coach Dan Castanon said, 
"The official told me that one of our linemen was trying to disrupt Canyon's 
snap count." 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to explain to him that on kicks, teams don't even use snap counts. The 
holders just use hand signals to the center." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon Coach Loren Shumer still made it interesting, settling for a 23-yard 
field goal. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

THIS COACH ISN'T AFRAID OF A HIT . . . OR TWO; 
</P>
<P>
PREP FOOTBALL: BRETHREN CHRISTIAN'S MIKE ROARK SEES HIS SHARE OF ACTION DURING 
SCRIMMAGES WITH HIS OUTMANNED, BUT SELDOM OUTPLAYED, TEAM.

<TEXT>
<P>
He's not exactly wild about the idea, but Mike Roark knows there are days when 
he must strap on a football helmet and shoulder pads and scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
It's a tough way for a high school coach to make a living. But sometimes Roark 
doesn't have a choice. 
</P>
<P>
Roark is the first-year coach at Brethren Christian, a private school of 290 
students located in Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors have only 17 players on the varsity, five shy of what they need to 
scrimmage. So Roark, a few assistants and a couple of junior varsity players 
fill in. 
</P>
<P>
"The coaches have to dress up now and then," said Roark, who is 30 and 
counting. "I usually play a little nose guard or linebacker." 
</P>
<P>
While the Warriors have lacked quantity this season, they have more than made 
up for it with quality. 
</P>
<P>
The team nicknamed the "Sweet 17" will play Whittier Christian for the Olympic 
League championship tonight at Lakewood High School. 
</P>
<P>
Brethren Christian (7-1, 2-1 in league) is playing for its first league title 
since 1982. The Warriors haven't been to the playoffs since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
When Roark took over last spring, they were coming off consecutive 2-7 seasons. 
Last year, Brethren Christian lost successive games to Montclair Prep, Valley 
Christian and Whittier Christian by a combined score of 175-0. 
</P>
<P>
Roark's first job was to convince the players they could win. It wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
Said quarterback Brandon Stott: "The coaches have a new attitude. It's fun when 
they get out there and practice with us. Last year, when we went out there on 
Friday nights, we knew we were in for a long night. This year, it's different." 
</P>
<P>
Said flanker Brian Joseph: "This has turned into a football program now. 
Before, it was just something to do. Everyone thought football was a joke. Not 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps a change of scenery had something to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors moved their campus from Paramount to a 20-acre parcel on the 
southwest corner of Orange Avenue and Grindlay Street in Cypress last summer. 
It is more centrally located for the school's students, many of whom live in 
the Lakewood-Long Beach and Cerritos areas. 
</P>
<P>
Roark made sure the players took advantage of the school's new weight room with 
mandatory conditioning during the summer. When a player makes a mistake in 
practice, Roark makes him run a half mile as punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Conditioning is a must with only 17 players. 
</P>
<P>
"Our practices are like cross-country in shoulder pads," Joseph said. "We're in 
great shape." 
</P>
<P>
But Roark's conditioning and discipline also trimmed Brethren Christian's 
roster to 17. He had high hopes, and 34 varsity players, when he arrived on 
campus last April. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of philosophical and personal differences," Roark said. "Some 
of the kids felt another coach should have been hired. Then I came in and laid 
down a lot of rules." 
</P>
<P>
They were simple: If you don't come to spring practice, summer passing league 
or conditioning, you don't play. 
</P>
<P>
One by one, players began to quit. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys out here are the ones with heart," Stott said. "With all the 
discipline and conditioning, coach weeded out the guys who didn't really want 
to play." 
</P>
<P>
After Brethren Christian opened with a 44-0 victory over Capistrano Valley 
Christian, many who quit wanted to return. Roark said no. 
</P>
<P>
But there's one player Roark wishes he could have back: senior Tim Nichol. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, Nichol, a running back and linebacker, was hospitalized with 
what doctors thought was a torn heart valve. Now the doctors believe the valve 
was only bruised, and Nichol might be back in time for basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
The team rallied around Nichol during his hospital stay. He was on the sideline 
for Brethren Christian's 17-14 homecoming victory over Orange Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
"That was an emotional game," tailback Frank Brady said. "In the locker room 
before the game, our intensity really showed." 
</P>
<P>
Roark said Nichol brought the team together. 
</P>
<P>
"These 17 guys are the best of friends," Roark said. "When Tim was in the 
hospital, all the players showed up the morning after he got hurt. The next 
Monday, we brought a VCR to his room so he could watch game films. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing football is nice, but these kids know that when you put it in 
perspective, it's even better." 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors have been outnumbered in every game. Most Olympic League teams 
range from 30 to 40 players, allowing coaches to substitute freely. 
</P>
<P>
But not Roark. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I look down the sidelines, and my assistant and I are the only ones 
standing there," Roark said. 
</P>
<P>
No player has a single role. Stott, for example, plays quarterback, defensive 
back and kicker. Brady, the team's leading rusher with 699 yards, also plays 
defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
On kickoffs, Stott's job is to make sure the Warriors have 11 players on the 
field. He finds it easier to count the six reserves on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
"A referee suggested I do that in our second game of the year," Stott said. "He 
was a pretty funny referee." 
</P>
<P>
Roark, the defensive coordinator at San Diego West Hills before coming to 
Brethren, built the Warrior offense around Stott's passing. 
</P>
<P>
Stott has thrown for 1,376 yards and 13 touchdowns out of the Warriors' 
run-and-shoot, which is surprising teams in a league known for two-back rushing 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a wide-open offense in this league," Roark said. "We don't have a 
lineman over 200 pounds. We don't have the numbers. We have no choice. We have 
to go to a lot of razzle-dazzle."

MCCLURE'S INTERCEPTION PAYS OFF FOR CORONA DEL MAR

Bud McClure pays his son, John, $100 for every interception or sack he makes 
for the Corona del Mar High School football team. 
</P>
<P>
But John McClure's interception Thursday night against University will be worth 
more than the $100 bill his father will hand him this morning. 
</P>
<P>
The defensive back intercepted Brad Vail's pass at the Corona del Mar 12-yard 
line with 43 seconds remaining to preserve a 17-13 victory over University in a 
Sea View League game at Irvine High School. 
</P>
<P>
The victory guaranteed third place in the league and a spot in the Southern 
Section Division VI playoffs for the Sea Kings (5-4-1, 2-2-1 in league). 
University dropped to 4-6, 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
"That was McClure's biggest play of the year," Corona del Mar Coach Dave 
Holland said. "It put us in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
University nearly stole the game, and the playoff berth, away in the final 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar's Tom Hess kicked a 36-yard field goal with 1 minute 12 seconds 
remaining to give the Sea Kings a 17-13 lead. 
</P>
<P>
University then marched from its five-yard line to Corona del Mar's 17 in only 
37 seconds. Vail completed four consecutive passes for 61 yards on the drive. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Vail's last pass that mattered. 
</P>
<P>
Vail rolled to his left and lobbed the ball to the left side. With no 
University player close to the ball, McClure shot under it and pulled it in. 
</P>
<P>
"I was rolling out with the quarterback," McClure said. "It (the ball) was 
tipped and I was the lucky guy to get to it." 
</P>
<P>
McClure's interception capped a strong second half for Corona del Mar, which 
rallied from a 13-0 halftime deficit with two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Murphy scored on a one-yard run with 2:12 left in the third quarter to 
cut the deficit to 13-7. George Dickson caught a nine-yard pass from Chad 
Woolsey to put Corona del Mar ahead, 14-13, with 6:07 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference was that we were able to move the ball in the second half," 
Holland said. "In the first half, University was running the ball at will on 
us." 
</P>
<P>
University scored on its first two possessions and outrushed Corona del Mar, 
162 yards to 27, in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Walker put University in front, 7-0, on a one-yard run with 5:05 left in 
the first quarter. University pushed the lead to 13-0 with 10:14 remaining in 
the half when Jerry Apana caught a nine-yard touchdown pass from Vail.

Los Alamitos High School decided to go with its running game to defeat El 
Dorado, 16-0, Thursday at Gahr High School. 
</P>
<P>
The victory assured Los Alamitos (6-4, 3-2 in the Empire League) of a playoff 
berth as the league's third-place team. 
</P>
<P>
LaQuon Beckton, who scored on a two-yard run in the fourth quarter, gained 117 
of the Griffins' 249 yards rushing in 22 carries. Andrew Fuentes added 113 
yards in 14 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback John Collins, who scored Los Alamitos' first touchdown on a 13-yard 
run at the end of the first quarter, completed six of 14 passes for 84 yards. 
Three of his passes were intercepted, two by Jim Beck. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado (2-8, 1-4) was held to 117 yards rushing and 79 passing. Bryan 
Warner, who gained 74 yards in 16 carries, also had two receptions for nine 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Two first-quarter interceptions cost the Golden Hawks scoring opportunities, 
and the second set up Collins' touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado reached the Los Alamitos' 12-yard line in six plays after the opening 
kickoff, but lost the ball on Josh Beeney's interception of a Jason Bluth pass. 
El Dorado regained possession two plays later on Beck's interception. Seven 
plays later, a Bluth pass was picked off by Scott Cronin at Los Alamitos' 44 
with 3:46 left in the quarter. BOB BORSUM

Costa Mesa High School had four interceptions and a safety as the Mustangs 
defeated Trabuco Hills, 16-13, in a Pacific Coast League game Thursday at 
Mission Viejo High School. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa (6-4, 4-1 in league) clinched a berth in the Southern Section 
Division VII playoffs with a second-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
The loss left Trabuco Hills (4-5-1, 3-2) as one of six third-place teams in the 
division vying for four remaining playoff spots. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa's defense scored the deciding points when it tackled Trabuco Hills 
running back Ben Rooker for a safety to make the score 16-7 with 7 minutes 42 
seconds left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills cut the deficit to three when Jeff Clayton ran 19 yards for the 
touchdown. Trabuco Hills' two-point conversion pass failed, making the score 
16-13 with 4:24 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa sealed the victory when Ryan McEvoy intercepted Shane Weintraut's 
pass with 1:04 remining in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills took a 7-0 lead when Julian Ford caught a 19-yard pass from Pat 
Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa came back to tie it, 7-7, when Jermaine Jackson scored on a 
five-yard run. Jackson finished with 115 yards in 16 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa took the lead, 14-7, when McEvoy ran one yard for touchdown in the 
second quarter. JOE WOJCIECHOWSKI

SANTA MARGARITA FINISHES UNDEFEATED;

PREP FOOTBALL: AFTER THEIR 33-6 VICTORY OVER WARREN, EAGLES PREPARE FOR

<P>
Santa Margarita High School made its second season of varsity football a 
perfect one with a 33-6 victory over Warren Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Josh Ireland, a junior tailback, and David Shearer, a senior defensive back, 
led the way at Orange Coast College. Ireland rushed for 166 yards and two 
third-quarter touchdowns. Shearer had three interceptions, including one he 
returned 45 yards for a touchdown with 55 seconds left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita (10-0) and its hurry-up offense had stalled at the Warren 39, 
where the Bears took over on downs near the end of the second quarter. 
Quarterback Jon Miller threw into the right flat, but Shearer sprinted up to 
make the interception and race down the sideline for the score to give Santa 
Margarita a 13-0 lead at the half. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita's Mike Farris returned the second-half kickoff 57 yards to the 
Warren 33. And Ireland, who had 47 yards in nine carries in the first half, did 
the rest. 
</P>
<P>
He had runs of 13 and 20 yards and Santa Margarita had a 20-0 lead. Warren 
followed with three plays and a punt, and Ireland pulled off another two-play 
drive. He started with a run of 36 yards and ended with a 12-yard touchdown 
run. 
</P>
<P>
"We got back to what we do well," Santa Margarita Coach Jim Hartigan said. "Run 
the football. Ireland said, 'Coach, I need the ball,' and when he said that we 
listened; he's a talented player." 
</P>
<P>
Ireland started the game third in Orange County in rushing with 1,069 yards and 
ended the regular season with 1,235. 
</P>
<P>
Farris scored on a one-yard run to start the scoring for Santa Margarita in the 
first quarter, and quarterback Trevor Yankoff scored on a 12-yard scramble with 
three minutes left in the third quarter to give Santa Margarita a 33-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Shearer had two fourth-quarter interceptions, one in the end zone, to halt 
Warren (2-8) drives. His three interceptions give him five for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its undefeated record, there is still a major question left for Santa 
Margarita: In what division will it be placed for the Southern Section 
playoffs? The divisions are made up of leagues, but since Santa Margarita 
played a free-lance schedule, it will be up to the Southern Section seeding 
committee to place the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
The pairings will be announced Sunday, and Hartigan is hoping for nothing 
higher than Division VII. But there is a good chance Santa Margarita might end 
up in Division VI. Santa Margarita outscored its opponents, 283-83, and had 
victories over Pasadena and Gahr, both Division II teams. Division VI would 
also make geographical sense because four of its five leagues are from Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"We've worked really hard for this (undefeated season)," Hartigan said. "Now, I 
just hope they're fair to the kids."

PARCELLS KEEPS GIANTS' VISION NARROWED TO A GAME AT A TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The focus never wavers, the glare in his eyes never softens, and his team never 
loses. At least it hasn't lost in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Coach Bill Parcells, the grumpiest winner around, has his 
undefeated New York Giants playing and thinking just the way he demands them 
to: One victory at a time. 
</P>
<P>
And while prognosticators and network visionaries are jumping ahead excitedly 
to the Giants' Monday night matchup with the San Francisco 49ers on Dec. 3 -- a 
possible unprecedented game between 11-0 teams -- Parcells chooses to ignore 
all such talk. He wants his team thinking only about this Sunday, playing the 
Rams, a team that he pointedly reminds them has beaten the Giants three 
consecutive times. 
</P>
<P>
Around the Giants, nothing else is allowed. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no mention of the 49er game around here," Parcells said. "The only 
people who have said anything about that are the newspapers. Our players aren't 
thinking about that. We've got the Rams, who've given us a lot of trouble; 
we've got the Eagles coming up, who've given us a lot of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you that our players are paying absolutely zero attention to the 
49ers." 
</P>
<P>
But clearly, the 49ers and the Giants are showing that they are the class of 
the '90 pack, two teams that seem destined to play each other not once but 
twice -- the second meeting in the NFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers' perfect record is not surprising -- the 49ers are expected to 
achieve. The Giants' swing at a 16-0 season is shocking, coming as it does on 
the heels of a down season for 35-year-old quarterback Phil Simms and general 
murmuring that the Giants' nucleus had gotten old together. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with Simms the NFL's highest-rated passer and an old-fogy defense 
shackling opponents to just 229.5 yards a game, the Giants are stirring echoes 
of their dominant 1986 team's run to Super Bowl XXI. 
</P>
<P>
Are they better now than they were then? 
</P>
<P>
"No, I don't think so," Parcells said. "We've gotten through a couple of tough 
games in our division, but I still think it's still a little early to tell 
where we are as a team. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been pretty fortunate to be in the position we're in, and I certainly 
don't think we're anywhere near what we were, particularly at the end of '86, 
when we were pretty dominant in several areas. 
</P>
<P>
"But we have improved our team in several areas over last year, I think. One of 
them is the secondary; they've played much better this year, we're intercepting 
more balls, and our pass defense is much better. And our special teams are 
better. So I think those two factors have enabled us to be a little bit better 
off than we were last year at this time, although last year I think we were 
7-1." 
</P>
<P>
Parcells says his team has gradually been reformulated, step by step, since the 
1986 season, and just as gradually, it has been making steps back to where it 
is threatening to swamp the league once again. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been through two transitions here since I've been the coach," said 
Parcells, whose first year was 1983. "One started in '84, when we really 
basically rebuilt the whole team with the exception of two or three players who 
were really young -- (Lawrence) Taylor, Simms -- at that time. Then after the 
'86 year, we had to kind of start over again after that. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been making pretty steady progress from a record standpoint since then. 
So hopefully, we can continue to improve this year and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Jerry Gray, who was held out of last Sunday's game with a sore knee, 
practiced again Thursday and said there was no way he would stand on the 
sideline against the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll play Sunday, I'll play Sunday, believe me," Gray said. "What happened is 
that I had a lot of fluid on my knee going into last week. This week, I have 
little to none. It's letting me go out and make plays and make cuts, and I'm 
not even wearing a brace on it." 
</P>
<P>
Gray first injured his left knee in the last exhibition game, missed the Rams' 
first three games, then came back and played in the next four without ever 
feeling 100%. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I think in Week 9, I think I'm back," Gray said. "I just have to go 
out and make plays and prove it to Jerry. I'm more critical on myself than a 
lot of people because I want to make the plays I know I can make. The games I 
played, I was frustrated because my body wasn't letting me make them, and now, 
my body's back in tune." 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson, however, wasn't quite so emphatic about Gray playing 
Sunday. Robinson has said he doesn't want Gray starting again until he is 
completely ready. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry's doing OK. We're going to wait and see how he is tomorrow," Robinson 
said Thursday. "He's not accelerating particularly well. He could not play 
again (Sunday). It's such a difficult thing when you're straggling out there. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not exactly sure what to do, to be honest with you. It's not one of 
those things that's an obvious decision. The guy has struggled with the leg and 
we hope rest will be the answer." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson did say that even with cornerbacks Darryl Henley and Clifford Hicks 
coming back after injuries, he was not considering moving Gray to safety at any 
time this season. Before the season, before the spate of injuries, the plan was 
for Gray to be the starting free safety.

An Orange County Superior Court jury Thursday levied punitive damages of $1 
million against four partners of Trammell Crow Co. for fraudulently cutting a 
local brokerage out of a commission in the purchase of an Irvine office 
building in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The award came a day after the jury ruled that the Irvine-based partnership 
should pay $6 million to Lee &amp; Associates for fraudulently denying the 
Orange County broker a commission from the $340-million sale of Fluor Corp.'s 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
With interest, the total award to Lee will be $9.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
"This underscores the relationship of brokers and developers in the Orange 
County community," said Rick Fahrney, an attorney for Lee &amp; Associates. 
"Basically, it says that when you have a relationship that is about to ripen 
into an agreement, to interfere with that is wrongful, and you run the risk of 
being sued." 
</P>
<P>
Fluor, the Irvine-based engineering and construction firm, originally was a 
defendant in the case, but was dropped on Oct. 19. The company said Superior 
Court Judge Marvin G. Weeks ruled that "Fluor had no liability whatsoever for 
any commissions or damages which may be awarded in the case." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the Trammell Crow partners -- William Lane Jr., Thomas A. Bailey, 
Joel C. Peterson and J. McDonald Williams -- quickly left the court and did not 
comment on the verdict. However, Fahrney said he expected the partners would 
appeal the hotly contested case. 
</P>
<P>
The case, which has dragged on for five years, has been closely watched because 
of the prestige of the firms involved, the large sums involved and the 
potential it had to redefine brokers' rights. 
</P>
<P>
Lee contended that it was representing Fluor when the company decided to sell 
its headquarters because of financial pressures in late 1984. Lee contacted 
Trammell Crow as a potential buyer and the partners of the Dallas-based office 
builder expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
The Trammell Crow executives negotiated the sale directly with Fluor and agreed 
to acquire the building and land for $340 million in 1985. Lee demanded a 
commission of $9 million. But Trammell Crow offered only $2.5 million and later 
withdrew that amount when Fluor said it had no written or oral deal with Lee. 
</P>
<P>
After several months of testimony, the jury deliberated three days before 
deciding Wednesday that Trammell Crow had interfered with Lee's relationship 
with Fluor. The jury said that the Trammell Crow partners had acted with "fraud 
and malice" in the transaction, thereby paving the way for an award of punitive 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
The jury heard nearly four hours of evidence Thursday about the net worth of 
four Trammell Crow partners. The public and press were barred from the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
The damages -- $250,000 for each partner -- were levied individually instead of 
against Trammell Crow as a corporation because the company is organized as a 
series of partnerships. Nine jurors voted in favor of the damages, three 
against. 
</P>
<P>
Fahrney said that Lee's biggest regret over the case is its lost relationship 
with Fluor. "It was a very close one," he said.

COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the stocks of many local companies floundering, now may be the time to go 
bottom fishing. 
</P>
<P>
That, at least, is the opinion of Newport Securities. The Costa Mesa brokerage 
has compiled a list of 15 Orange County firms whose shares are selling below 
the company's book value because of "exaggerated pessimism" in the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Kilpatrick, president of Newport Securities, said he believes that the 
firms on the list are fundamentally sound and offer "excellent investment 
opportunities in anticipation of a market improvement." 
</P>
<P>
He said most of the stocks -- real estate and computer industry firms -- have 
been hurt by market fears of a recession at home and war in the Middle East. 
Others have been adversely affected by restructurings or specific industry 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The current political and economic uncertainties have had an unprecedented 
effect on the values of Orange County's public companies," the brokerage said 
in a circular it is distributing to customers. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the company added this note of caution: "In many cases, stocks which 
trade below their book value do so for good reasons." Book value is the net 
value of all assets, including real estate, cash, equipment, investments and 
inventory, minus all liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Bottom fishing is the age-old investment tactic of buying stock at its lowest 
ebb -- when the price theoretically has nowhere to go but up. Orange County is 
a good place to look, because many of the publicly traded companies are small 
and quick to feel all the negative impacts of investor nervousness. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index of 30 blue-chip industrial stocks, 
has dropped 11.2% so far this year, falling 309.39 points to 2,443.81 at the 
close of trading Thursday, from 2753.2 on Dec. 31. And the NASD Composite 
index, which tracks the smaller stocks traded in the over-the-counter market -- 
has plunged 26%, off 118.45 points to 336.37 Thursday, from 454.82 at the close 
of trading Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
The big question is where is the bottom. Many stock analysts, including 
Garfield Logan, a partner in the Newport Beach investment banking firm of 
Hagerty, Van Mourick &amp; Logan, said he believes that the current bear market 
has further to fall. 
</P>
<P>
"So even though some of these companies' stock looks cheap, it doesn't mean it 
can't get cheaper," he said, adding that a stock can fall more no matter how 
cheap it appears. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in the 1920s, Anaconda Copper fell from the mid-$20s to $1, and the 
grandfather of a friend of mine figured it couldn't go any lower," Logan said. 
"So he hocked the family farm and bought Anaconda stock. It fell to 50 cents a 
share right after that." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Kilpatrick thinks that there are some bargains out there for investors 
willing to buy and hold for future appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
Among the stocks on Newport Securities' list are five real estate firms -- 
three builders, a mortgage banker and a title insurance company -- that are 
hampered by the overall economic downturn. In addition, many have been hurt by 
sluggish local real estate sales caused by the area's high prices and by a 
credit crunch that is making it increasingly difficult for builders to obtain 
financing for projects. 
</P>
<P>
Two real estate firms recommended by Newport Securities are home-builders 
Standard Pacific L.P., and J.M. Peters Co. 
</P>
<P>
Standard Pacific is selling for $4.75 a share but has a book value of $9.54. 
And the company, a builder specializing in medium- to high-priced homes, has 
traded as high as $15 a share this year and hit almost $20 at its peak last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
While most industry experts do not expect a turnaround in the local housing 
industry until at least late next year, the stock could prove a wise buy if the 
company weathers the current downturn, Kilpatrick said. 
</P>
<P>
A riskier investment would be J.M. Peters Co., which is trading at a historic 
low of $1.25 a share, down from an all-time high of $14.88 last year. The 
Newport Beach builder of luxury homes has been hit hard by the buying slump and 
recently stopped building as it tries to sell more than 300 homes in its 
inventory. In addition, the company's majority owner, ailing San Jacinto 
Savings in Houston, is in danger of being seized by the government. 
</P>
<P>
Kilpatrick cautioned that the depth of the real estate slump makes it 
especially critical that investors study individual companies' financial 
performance records before making decisions to buy stock. 
</P>
<P>
In the computer area, Newport Securities lists four stocks that investors might 
consider. The firm said several have taken charges against earnings to 
restructure. "With these changes behind them, (the four) offer excellent 
investment opportunities," the company said. 
</P>
<P>
One example is Emulex Corp., a Costa Mesa manufacturer of computer data storage 
systems. The company recently took a major writeoff, as it disposed of products 
that were in development when the market for them disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
The losses that resulted from that writeoff and from the overall slump in the 
computer industry has helped drive Emulex common stock to an all-time low of 
$4.38 a share, down from $8.50 earlier this year and far below its historic 
high of $27.75. 
</P>
<P>
But the company's book value is $5.80 a share -- almost $1.50 a share above the 
stock's current selling price. Kilpatrick said Emulex "is now beginning to 
benefit from its efforts to lower costs." 
</P>
<P>
Kilpatrick said he is marketing his euphemistically titled "special situations" 
stock picks to clients he considers sophisticated investors -- generally local 
business executives or owners looking for for personal and corporate investment 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Newport's sales pitch, he said, is that "bad times provide some of best 
opportunities in local markets like Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
When times are good and the market is soaring, it is difficult to determine 
that a stock really is worth the price, often two or three times book value, 
that it is selling for, Kilpatrick said. 
</P>
<P>
"But it is not hard to see that a company's stock is worth its book value or 
that there may be a bargain when it is trading at book or lower," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When a stock's price falls below book value, "the market is suggesting that 
only the company's physical assets have any value and that there is no value in 
a company's market position, reputation or in the experience and abilities of 
its employees, and that's not true," Kilpatrick said. 
</P>
<P>
"With this kind of strategy, the key is to buy a little bit of a lot of 
different stocks, and then wait for a general recovery," he said. "I don't 
think it is a question of whether these companies' stocks will trade higher, 
but when."

INGRAM SEES AUSTRALIAN INTEREST AS FOOTING IN PACIFIC RIM MARKET

Hoping to gain a strong foothold in the fast-growing Pacific Rim computer 
market, Ingram Micro D said Thursday that it has tentatively agreed to buy a 
33% interest in a large Australian computer distributor. 
</P>
<P>
Ingram Micro D, the nation's largest independent distributor of personal 
computer products, said it will pay $2.4 million for a one-third interest in 
Imagineering Technology Ltd. of Sidney, Australia. Under terms of the deal, the 
Santa Ana company also would provide $9.4 million in capital to the Australian 
firm, said Linwood A. (Chip) Lacy, Ingram Micro D's chairman and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
Lacy said the deal would fulfill a key company goal to establish itself as a 
major overseas supplier of computer products and gain a strong presence in the 
Far East. 
</P>
<P>
"Our strategy is to have three worldwide markets in North America, Europe and 
the Pacific Rim," Lacy said. "We also like having a partner that knows Asia. If 
you consider Imagineering as part of our group, then we'll be larger in 
international sales than any other distributor." 
</P>
<P>
Ingram Micro D posted sales of $367 million for the third quarter ended Sept. 
30, and it expects to report annual sales $1.45 billion. The privately held 
company does not report earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Ingram Micro D's partner in the deal is First Pacific Co. Ltd, a diversified 
Hong Kong company with real estate, banking and telecommunications interests. 
First Pacific, which currently owns 42% of Imagineering, would invest $17.9 
million in capital and increase its stake to 67% if the deal goes through. 
</P>
<P>
Together, Ingram Micro D and First Pacific will offer 47 cents a share to 
shareholders who hold the 58% of Imagineering stock not owned by First Pacific. 
That represents a hefty premium over Imagineering's current trading price of 21 
cents a share, 
</P>
<P>
The deal is subject to several conditions, including Australian government 
approvals, the renegotiation of Imagineering's current loans, and a due 
diligence review by Ingram Micro D, Lacy said. The deal is expected to close 
between Feb. 15 and March 1 next year. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement with First Pacific, Ingram Micro D has the option of 
increasing its stake in Imagineering to up to 49% between 1993 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
The Australian firm distributes computer products in the Pacific Rim, including 
Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, the Philippines 
and Indonesia. It expects to report sales of $202 million this year.

SPACE STATION CUTS CLOUD MCDONNELL HIRING PLANS; 
</P>
<P>
AEROSPACE: ITS SPACE SYSTEMS CO. SUFFERED A SETBACK WHEN CONGRESS TRIMMED 
CURRENT YEAR FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM FROM $2.45 BILLION TO $1.9 BILLION.

<TEXT>
<P>
A redesign of the space station Freedom resulting from congressional cuts in 
the $37-billion project has clouded the hiring plans of McDonnell Douglas Space 
Systems Co., a major contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Congress last month slashed space station funding to $1.9 billion from a 
proposed $2.45 billion for the current year and ordered NASA to come up with a 
simpler, less costly design. As a result, about 2,000 new space station jobs 
will not be added this year, said Mark Hess, a spokesman for the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
But the impact of the cuts is unclear for McDonnell Douglas, which employs 
2,000 people on the program in Huntington Beach and Houston, said Tom Williams, 
a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, the Huntington Beach division and several subcontractors have been 
awarded contracts worth more than $4 billion to build major segments of the 
station. 
</P>
<P>
These include the main framework or truss structure, propulsion system, air 
locks, communications and tracking system, data management system and several 
other systems. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said NASA told the company in August to freeze space station hiring. 
But he said the employment picture for all contractors will be unclear until 
NASA releases details of the redesign. "We stand ready to do what we have to do 
for NASA," he said. "The redesign could change work orders. Until then, we 
don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Among the proposals that NASA is said to be considering is shortening the 
length of the 508-foot station, said a consultant familiar with the program. A 
redesign of the station's main framework could have a significant impact on 
McDonnell Douglas' work force as well as its subcontractors, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
But Williams said a redesign of the truss would not necessarily force the 
company to change its employment plans. 
</P>
<P>
"It could affect our work but not necessarily our people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
NASA has already ordered one contractor, General Electric Corp., to stop its 
work on external attachments to the space station, Hess said. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 people employed by GE and its subcontractors at the Goddard Space 
Center in Greenbelt, Md., either will be reassigned or laid off, Hess said. 
</P>
<P>
Over five years, Congress directed NASA to reduce the cost of the $37-billion 
space station by $6 billion. The agency still hopes to begin launching elements 
of the station by 1995, Hess said.

<P>
The sizzle has gone out of Luther Campbell and 2 Live Crew. The Miami rap 
group's concert on Wednesday at Vertigo was mostly a non-event -- like watching 
someone in his 16th minute of fame. 
</P>
<P>
You get an idea how limited these guys are as rappers when you realize that the 
most lively performers on stage weren't even on the payroll. 
</P>
<P>
After an uneventful opening half-hour, four female fans voluntarily climbed on 
stage and began dancing as Campbell and his two male sidekicks went through one 
of their typically ribald tales. 
</P>
<P>
Caught up in the intoxicating glare of the spotlight and the urgings of the 
crowd to "take it off," two of the women began competing aggressively for 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
In a marvelous test of the women's exhibitionist instincts and the audience's 
penchant for voyeurism, the pair began peeling off clothing -- including sexy 
lingerie -- and ended up rubbing suggestively against the rappers. 
</P>
<P>
The sequence only lasted about five minutes in the hourlong concert and it 
probably wasn't much more outrageous than what happens at the neighborhood bar 
during an especially lively wet T-shirt contest. But the dancers added some 
spontaneity to what was otherwise a tired routine. They also provided the only 
real touch of the sexual tease that many in the curious crowd -- about 
two-thirds male -- no doubt associated with 2 Live Crew performances. 
</P>
<P>
If the trio of rappers had played here last summer right after their arrest in 
Florida on obscenity charges, there would have been a lot more sense of 
occasion. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the Crew was something of a mystery. Because its X-rated party 
records don't receive radio air play, the only thing most pop fans knew about 
the group was what they had read. The question: Just how wild are these guys? 
</P>
<P>
The Crew would have also benefited at the time from being the underdog in a 
worthy fight against censorship. Its "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" was the first 
recording in America ever declared obscene by a U.S. court. 
</P>
<P>
Even Bruce Springsteen came to their aid, allowing Campbell to use the melody 
of "Born in the U.S.A." for an anti-censorship record called "Banned in the 
U.S.A." 
</P>
<P>
But 2 Live Crew -- which continues its tour tonight at the Celebrity Theatre in 
Anaheim -- has become an old story. Anyone curious enough to pay $20 see the 
group Wednesday had probably already bought one of its albums or seen its 
video. So, they were all too familiar with the group's raunchy, stag-party 
flavor -- a basically one-joke attack. 
</P>
<P>
One sign that the curiosity has waned was that only 250 of the 1,100 tickets 
for Wednesday's concert had been sold by 8 p.m., according a Vertigo employee 
who was hoping for a strong walk-up business. Yet there didn't seem to be any 
last-minute stampede, leaving the room far less crowded than on a typical 
Friday or Saturday dance night. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd tried good-naturedly to pump some spirit into the evening by 
repeating Campbell's bawdy slogans and rhymes, but the material was simply too 
one-dimensional for any of it to catch fire. The only inviting moments 
musically occurred when the Crew relied on the melodies of two old rock hits, 
Manfred Mann's "Do Wah Diddy Diddy" and the Kinks' "All Day and All of the 
Night." 
</P>
<P>
If Campbell proved weak as an entertainer, he came across as likable enough as 
a person -- both in a press conference at the club before the concert, where he 
defended his music quite articulately against the censorship charges, and on 
stage, where a constant smile showed that he doesn't take the whole thing too 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
What was also clear was that the performance was exactly what Campbell has 
maintained from the beginning: a comedy show, not -- as has been charged -- a 
serious attempt at the kind of hard-core pornography that arouses an audience. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest emotion raised by the show, perhaps, was anger at the legal and 
law enforcement authorities around the country who have wasted their time and 
taxpayers' money (as much as an estimated $500,000 in Florida alone) to try to 
stop this group, whose act may be juvenile but is clearly not obscene under 
U.S. Supreme Court guidelines of community standards, prurient interest and 
artistic merit. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it's hard to feel sorry for Campbell, who has made millions 
of dollars because of the added record sales created by the controversy. How 
appropriate that the two most common words in his stage vocabulary rhyme with 
luck and rich. 
</P>
<P>
 2 Live Crew and Kid Frost play tonight at 8 at the Celebrity Theatre, 201 E. 
Broadway, Anaheim. Tickets: $20.50. Information: (714) 999-9536.

FLAMENCO TROUPE TO DANCE IN SAN DIEGO; 
</P>
<P>
STAGE: THE ROSA MONTOYA BAILES FLAMENCOS, BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO, WILL PERFORM 
TONIGHT AND SATURDAY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Of all the ethnic expressions seen on San Diego stages, flamenco dance is 
arguably the most elusive, despite the city's strong cultural ties to Spain. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't understand it," Rosa Montoya said from her San Francisco home. "I know 
you have a big Hispanic community, and you're so close to Mexico. But most 
people in San Diego don't really know what flamenco is. They may have seen it 
in a nightclub, but they haven't seen good, authentic flamenco. There's much 
more flamenco in San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
Montoya, niece of the master flamenco guitarist Carlos Montoya, and her Rosa 
Montoya Bailes Flamencos have been performing throughout the Bay Area since she 
started the group in 1974. Tonight and Saturday at 8 p.m. at the Spreckels 
Theatre, her 12-member troupe of dancers, singers and guitarists will make its 
San Diego debut, under the banner of the San Diego Foundation for the 
Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to give a variety of what flamenco is -- different themes," said 
Montoya, a native of Spain. "We'll have a classical Spanish number, a love 
drama from Garcia Lorca (the Spanish poet) and something from the Cafe de 
Chinitas (a classic turn-of-the-century Andalusian cafe). I want people to know 
what real flamenco dance is like." 
</P>
<P>
Real flamenco is earthy and flamboyant, characterized by powerful heel beats 
that pound the floor with the speed and force of a machine-gun volley. It 
features curving, up-swung arms, beautifully expressive hands and rigidly 
arched backs. 
</P>
<P>
Flamenco exudes an undercurrent of passion, but that emotion is never allowed 
to simmer too close to the surface. Dancers stalk their partners in a stylized 
battle of the sexes, or strut proudly in solo in response to the relentless 
urgings of the strumming guitars and wailing chants. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend's program will draw on old-style traditions culled from Spanish 
Gypsies, 19th-Century zarzuela operetta and Moorish influences, but some of the 
choreography is contemporary. 
</P>
<P>
A common element is woven through all the dancing, however. 
</P>
<P>
"You need a complement of singers and guitarists to give more flavor to the 
dancing," Montoya said, "and you have to have good clapping to make it 
exciting. The dancers need this." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego-based Charo Monge is one of two vocalists in Montoya's troupe. She 
helps the dancers ignite the smoldering fires of flamenco through throaty 
chants. 
</P>
<P>
"Flamenco is sort of like jazz," she said. "If you have a clear voice, it 
doesn't work. You have to have a complete disregard for the vocal chords. But, 
if the dancers understand the lyrics, the singing makes a very important 
statement. It sets the mood for the dance, depending on whether the lyrics are 
happy, sad or joking." 
</P>
<P>
Monge is a singer in her own right and performs at clubs and concerts when time 
allows, but, she acknowledges, "I don't enjoy it. The dancer is what makes me 
really sing. I get the emotions from them, and, as a singer, I can push the 
dancers. You don't rely just on choreography. There's a lot of improvisation, 
where you can each express yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Monge said that, when Montoya is dancing, she is challenged to greater heights 
by the vocalists' impassioned chants and the emotion-charged music. 
</P>
<P>
"She breaks all the rules, and by the end of the night you have to practically 
carry her away," Monge said. "She gives in totally to her art. That's why I'll 
do anything to work with her. She's very exciting to watch." 
</P>
<P>
As a release from that excitement and tension, the company will culminate this 
weekend's concert with a comic work, called a buleria. 
</P>
<P>
"We do it as a release, but comedy is really one of the most difficult things 
to do," Monge said. "It's also the most fun."

PACIFIC SYMPHONY HAILS BERNSTEIN;

DIRECTOR CARL ST. CLAIR PAID TRIBUTE TO HIS RECENTLY DECEASED MENTOR AND

<P>
With emotion audible in his voice, Pacific Symphony music director Carl St. 
Clair prefaced the second half of the orchestra's concert Wednesday at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center with dedicatory remarks to the memory of 
Leonard Bernstein, his mentor and teacher who died on Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair said he selected works on his first two programs this season with the 
Pacific that he strongly associated with Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed surprising, then -- or was the personal meaning too great? -- that 
the new music director offered an expressively muted reading of Tchaikovsky's 
expansive and triumphant Symphony No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
This was a no-nonsense, no-heart-on-sleeve, almost anti-Romantic account. St. 
Clair drew compacted, driven, strongly pulsed lines. He refused to indulge in 
swooping, sculpted or blossoming phrasings, and so dampened the composer's 
expressive range. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra, which continues to sound more unified and purposeful in 
ensemble, offered energetic climaxes but failed to respond with lushness and 
precise attack. James Thatcher played the horn solo of the second movement with 
uncharacteristic dryness. 
</P>
<P>
The conductor forestalled premature applause by barely pausing between the 
first two movements. But the clap-happy audience found opportunities to express 
approval between the second and third movements and again after the pause 
before the final grand march in the last. Other audiences have similarly been 
misled, despite the pause on the dominant chord. 
</P>
<P>
St. Clair opened the second half of the program with "Greeting," a portion of 
Bernstein's last work, "Arias and Barcarolles." Carla Connors brought a creamy 
soprano to the low-lying tessitura of this gentle, four-minute lullaby. 
</P>
<P>
Bartok's Viola Concerto, completed from sketches after the composer's death by 
Tibor Serly, formed the centerpiece of the first half. The dazzling soloist was 
Donald McInnes, who holds the William Primrose chair in viola at USC. (Primrose 
had commissioned the concerto from Bartok.) 
</P>
<P>
McInnes commanded a range from big, full-bodied tone to spectral, filigreed 
lightness, and tossed off the challenges with ease. He proved lacking only in 
the demonic Hungarian folk accents in the final movement. St. Clair accompanied 
with mesmerizing attentiveness. 
</P>
<P>
The conductor opened the program with a jaunty, if at times boomingly 
percussive, account of the Overture to Rossini's "La Gazza Ladra," a 
not-very-satisfactory replacement for the originally announced Prelude to 
Wagner's "Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg." Again, a Bernstein connection was 
offered as the reason for the change. St. Clair had conducted the Rossini in 
joint concerts with his mentor on tour in Europe in 1989.

"I Vitelloni," the title of Federico Fellini's third film, loosely translates 
into "The Overgrown Teen-Agers" or "The Big Loafers." Taken from the Italian 
word for veal, it's a gentle idiomatic put-down of men in perpetual 
adolescence, hanging out on the corner, stalking girls, avoiding as much 
responsibility as they can. 
</P>
<P>
In typical Hollywood fashion, "I Vitelloni" (screening at UC Irvine tonight) 
was saddled with the title "The Young and the Passionate" when released in 
America after its 1953 European premiere. That title doesn't work -- Fellini's 
movie is about youth and passion, but it's hardly heroic or arch, as that one 
implies. 
</P>
<P>
"I Vitelloni" is, perhaps, Fellini's most ironic movie. Just about everything 
this expressionistic, humane and inventive (sometimes to the point of 
distraction) filmmaker has created is ironic, from the unjust human comedy of 
"La Strada" (1955) to the picaresque freakishness of "Fellini Satyricon" 
(1970). But this one is especially sardonic in its soft-edged way. 
</P>
<P>
Many think it's among his two or three best films primarily because of the 
strength of the ensemble acting and the personalized feel of the story. Fellini 
has been accused of making impersonal movies, but that's not the case here. The 
five actors who compose Fellini's vitelloni offer characterizations that seem 
more like living than performing. 
</P>
<P>
Fellini uses a narrator to introduce them to us. We first spy them cruising 
through a town square, possibly Rimini, Fellini's hometown. The director has 
said that much of the movie is autobiographical and captures those he knew in 
Rimini. The narrator tells us that Fausto (played by Franco Fabrizi) is the 
group's "leader and spiritual guide"; it's a sarcastic aside, considering that 
the womanizing Fausto is, at that moment, trying to pick up a young lady. 
</P>
<P>
His comrades are Moraldo (Franco Interlenghi), a character usually identified 
with Fellini himself; Alberto (Alberto Sordi); and Leopoldo (Leopoldo Trieste) 
and Riccardo (Riccardo Fellini, the director's brother). "I Vitelloni" follows 
them through pointless days and nights. At one point the narrator says, "In the 
next few months, the most important things that happened were that Riccardo 
grew a mustache and Alberto grew sideburns, while Fausto shaved his mustache 
off." 
</P>
<P>
When not shaving, Fausto gets his girlfriend (Eleonora Ruffo) pregnant and they 
have to marry. He still chases other women, his pals often at his side, trying 
to do the same. Later, Fellini gives us a drunken carnival scene -- the image 
has become his most familiar trademark, a metaphor turning up in many of his 
movies, most notably "8 1/2" (1963) -- that highlights these men in all their 
abject foolishness. 
</P>
<P>
The imagery is vivid and salty. But while Fellini can't resist making fun of 
them, he never becomes censorious. His customary use of camera angles to locate 
intimacy is obvious in this scene and throughout "I Vitelloni." By dwelling on 
them just so, he involves us in their lives -- you agree that they're silly, 
but condemnation seems far too harsh. 
</P>
<P>
 Federico Fellini's "I Vitelloni" will be shown tonight at 7 and 9 at UC 
Irvine's Student Center Crystal Cove Auditorium as part of the UCI Film 
Society's Directors' Personal Portraits series. Tickets: $2 to $4. (714) 
856-6379.

A Garden Grove man was killed early this morning when he apparently failed to 
make a turn at a San Diego Freeway off-ramp and slammed into a brick wall, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Eiji Morimoto, 27, was pronounced dead at the scene of the 12:39 a.m. accident, 
Fountain Valley Police Sgt. Larry Griswold said. The cause of the single-car 
accident was under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Griswold said Morimoto drove his car off the southbound side of the freeway at 
the Ellis Street exit. For an unknown reason, he failed to slow down, sped 
through a red traffic signal and slammed into a brick wall, destroying the car, 
Griswold said. 
</P>
<P>
Morimoto was not wearing a seat belt, Griswold added.

A truck driver and a mechanic were seriously injured when a suspected drunk 
driver veered his car off the Golden State Freeway near Castaic and struck them 
as they were working on the engine of a tractor-trailer rig that had broken 
down, the California Highway Patrol reported this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Gerardo Sandoval, 30, of Salinas and Paul Mangold, 46, of Lancaster were both 
in stable condition at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia after 
the accident Thursday afternoon, CHP Officer Jim Swearingen said. 
</P>
<P>
Both men suffered broken legs and other injuries, and Sandoval had a head 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car that hit the men, Gerald Wick, 53, of Frazier Park, was 
arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence, Swearingen said. 
</P>
<P>
Swearingen said Sandoval was driving the big rig south on the freeway when it 
broke down about two miles south of Templin Highway and he pulled onto the 
shoulder. Mangold then arrived and began working on the engine of the truck 
while Sandoval stood nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Wick was driving southbound when his car veered off the freeway, sideswiped the 
truck's trailer and then hit the two men who were standing on the driver's side 
of the truck cab, the CHP said. He stopped and aided the injured men until 
paramedics arrived.

<P>
A dispute over whether there is a settlement in a racketeering lawsuit brought 
against Imelda Marcos by the Philippine government requires an evidentiary 
hearing, a federal judge in Los Angeles ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit is an attempt by the Philippines to recover some of the billions of 
dollars that the government of President Corazon Aquino alleges were stolen 
during two decades of rule by the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney representing Marcos' widow claims Manila agreed to settle in 
exchange for 60% of funds in Hong Kong bank accounts controlled by the former 
first lady. The amount was not revealed, however. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer scheduled the hearing for Dec. 10.

"The year 1991 will not be easy, and there will continue to be wide mood swings 
in public and business confidence," said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the 
Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. "But don't get depressed, because we look 
for the area's economy to gather momentum in 1992, and to perform quite well

As Germans celebrated the first anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed a historic nonaggression treaty 
with Chancellor Helmut Kohl today and got a hero's welcome for letting the wall 
and the Iron Curtain collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Both Kohl and Gorbachev stressed the importance of the historical changes that 
have allowed closer ties as they signed the broad agreement that is to serve as 
the foundation of future relations. 
</P>
<P>
"Having signed this document one could hardly . . . think about until recently, 
we have officially ended a whole historical process and opened a deep 
perspective for ourselves," Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
In the treaty, both nations pledge not to attack the other and to honor the 
borders of all European nations. 
</P>
<P>
The upper house of Parliament, the Bundesrat, met in Berlin for the first time 
since 1959 to commemorate the opening of the wall that signaled the collapse of 
East Germany's Communist Party system and the triumph of democracy movements 
across Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But there was a commemoration of a somber sort, too, as the date is the same as 
the anniversary of a 1938 Nazi pogrom in which Germans set fire to synagogues 
and wrecked Jewish-owned shops, a foretaste of the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
"In our history, Nov. 9 is an ambivalent date -- a day of joy, a day of horror 
and of shame," Bundesrat President Henning Voscherau said. But, "A year ago, on 
Nov. 9, 1989, the people overthrew a dictatorship in Germany for the first time 
in our history," he continued. "Since then, Nov. 9 has become a shining light 
in our history as well." 
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony commemorating "Kristallnacht" (The Night of Broken Glass), German 
Jewish leader Heinz Galinski indirectly criticized the government's recent 
decision to halt Jewish immigration from the Soviet Union after a wave of 
applications for asylum. 
</P>
<P>
"To allow Jewish life in this country to wither away would mean bowing once 
again to the will of the Nazi state," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Berlin artist Ben Wagin laid the foundation stone outside the Reichstag 
building for a memorial to more than 190 Germans killed trying to cross the 
East-West German border, 80 of them at the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
The wood and stone memorial will stand in the former "death strip" beside the 
wall, once a deadly obstacle course of dog runs, tripwires, searchlights and 
guard towers manned by troops with orders to shoot would-be escapees. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few sections of the 107-mile wall still stand. And those sections have 
been chipped away by souvenir hunters.

Sheriff's deputies rushed into a home with guns drawn in response to a series 
of 911 calls but found out they had been summoned by a tomato. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities became interested last weekend when a Montgomery County dispatcher 
traced repeated emergency calls to the home of Linda and Danny Hurst. 
</P>
<P>
The Hursts were not home, so police figured someone might have broken in. 
Deputies went in with their guns drawn and found the house empty. 
</P>
<P>
Then Danny Hurst, who had been called to the scene, found an overripe tomato in 
a hanging basket dripping juice onto a telephone-answering machine below. 
</P>
<P>
As best police can figure it, the juice from the distressed tomato shorted out 
the machine's dialing system, causing it to call the Sheriff's Department 
emergency line.

SOCIALIST NAMED INDIA'S NEW PRIME MINISTER

A socialist leader was named as India's new prime minister today and said his 
government faces a "grim and challenging" task to quell widespread unrest that 
helped topple his predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
Chandra Shekhar, who led efforts to unseat Vishwanath Pratap Singh as prime 
minister, pledged that his government will seek "to create a society of equals" 
in a nation where thousands have died this year in battles over religious, 
ethnic and class differences. 
</P>
<P>
The clashes were used to rally opposition against Singh, the first Indian prime 
minister to be ousted by Parliament. He lost a confidence vote Wednesday. The 
63-year-old Chandra Shekhar is expected to be sworn in by President Ramaswami 
Venkataraman on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"In all humility, I would like to say that the task before us is arduous," 
Chandra Shekhar said. "It is so grim and challenging. But one has to make every 
endeavor to retrieve the situation." 
</P>
<P>
At least 370 people have died in the last three weeks in Hindu-Muslim riots 
over a 460-year-old mosque that some Hindus claim was built on a site sacred to 
the warrior god Rama. Hindus seek to raze the mosque in Ayodhya in northeast 
India and build a temple. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at least 150 upper-caste students have committed suicide or died in 
clashes with police to protest Singh's attempt to reserve more government jobs 
for low-caste Hindus.

<P>
South Korean President Roh Tae Woo fired a Cabinet minister today and canceled 
plans to build a nuclear waste dump on an island where thousands rioted in 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
South Korea's most serious anti-nuclear protest was mounted by villagers who 
accused the government of ignoring their demands not to build the waste dump. 
</P>
<P>
The protests began peacefully earlier this week after publication of a 
newspaper report about the government's plans for the dump but turned violent 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
South Korea has nine nuclear power plants in operation and plans to build more. 
Previous protests have involved minor clashes or peaceful rallies. 
</P>
<P>
The rioting on Anmyon prompted Roh to fire his minister of science and 
technology, Chung Kun Mo, and the island's police chief, both of whom he held 
responsible for the unrest.

King Birendra, whose grip on absolute power was shaken by a springtime

The new document establishes a constitutional monarchy patterned after the 
British model and declares the Himalayan nation a multiparty democracy.

<P>
It abolishes the old system under which political parties were banned and the 
king ruled with a nonpartisan legislature that routinely approved measures 
favored by the monarch.

enactment bogged down in a tug-of-war between the palace and Bhattarai's

Daily News strikers wielding clubs and hammers today attacked a truck

<P>
Seven men were arrested in one of the most violent incidents in the 2-week-old

Port Authority Police identified the arrested as five security guards hired by 
the Daily News and two strikers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a full-scale riot," a Port Authority police officer said. "People were 
jumping the cops. One of the strikers had an ice pick. It took 40 to 50 police 
about 20 minutes to restore order." 
</P>
<P>
The violence broke out at 4:50 a.m. when a News delivery truck pulled up to 
unload bundles of the tabloid followed by a Daily News car with two security 
men, a Port Authority Police spokeswoman said. About 50 demonstrators, whom she 
identified as union strikers, were waiting at the terminal entrance and 
attacked the driver and security guards, she said.

Moody's Investors Service today downgraded the debt ratings of four major 
Japanese banks, citing concern about profitability and asset quality, 
particularly in real estate loan portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
Sumitomo Bank Ltd. and Mitsubishi Bank Ltd. were lowered to AA-1 from AAA, 
while Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. was downgraded to A-1 from AA-2 and 
Tokai Bank Ltd. was lowered to AA-3 from AA-2. 
</P>
<P>
Moody's noted that Sumitomo remains Japan's most profitable bank. It praised 
Mitsubishi's conservative management, Long-Term Credit Bank's strong fee-based 
businesses and Tokai's solid base in and around the city of Nagoya, in central 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
But the agency said it is concerned about the banks' exposure to loans in a 
soft real estate market, their need to restructure assets and their ability to 
compete as interest rates are deregulated.

VOLVOS TOUGH, BUT FINALLY CRUSHED IN AD REBUTTAL

<P>
Hot rod enthusiasts today saw that a 13,000-pound "monster truck" could indeed 
crush a Volvo, but not without a little trouble. 
</P>
<P>
In response to a television commercial that Volvo has pulled from the air, the 
U.S. Hot Rod Assn. staged a demonstration of the power of a monster truck 
against a Volvo in the parking lot of the Spectrum sports arena. 
</P>
<P>
The ad had appeared to show Volvo as the only car left relatively intact after 
a monster truck called Bearfoot ran over a line of autos. It was later learned 
that the Volvo in the ad had been reinforced, and the embarrassed company 
withdrew the ad this week. 
</P>
<P>
Today, with TV crews and a small crowd gathered, Bearfoot had another go at the 
Swedish car. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the junked Volvos were no match over the long haul. But Bearfoot and 
two other monster trucks, Predator and Black Stallion, needed a few swipes to 
get the job done. The roar of the trucks drowned the crowd's cheers with each 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
Predator crushed a line of five cars -- a Pontiac, three Chevys and a Volvo in 
the middle. The roof of the Volvo wagon held up enough that it apparently would 
have protected passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Then Black Stallion took one run at a line of six Volvos, breaking them in for 
four runs by Bearfoot. One on the end gave the trucks particular trouble. 
Bearfoot finally finished by coming at an angle to smash roof supports on one 
that had remained standing. 
</P>
<P>
Bearfoot driver Todd Blaeser said he was surprised by how well the Volvos held 
up. But, asked if Volvo had passed the test, he looked at the pile of six 
crushed cars with his truck on top of it and said, "It doesn't look like it, 
does it?" 
</P>
<P>
"We've run into Volvos that have stood out in a pile of cars as being tougher," 
said Blaeser, 23, of Chippewa Falls, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
Volvo spokesman Robert Austin watched the car stomping on television from his 
office, and said that while the Volvos "didn't come out unscathed," they 
appeared to hold up well compared with other cars. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Predator got stuck on the Volvo on its third pass over the five 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
"It was apparent that the Volvo was standing up to the full weight of the 
truck. So I would leave it to the public to draw their own conclusions."

President Bush today signed legislation to extend most-favored-nation trade 
benefits to Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
He called the measure "an important milestone not only in U.S.-Czechoslovak 
relations, but also in Czechoslovakia's re-integration into the global economy 
and the community of free nations." 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the United States and Czechoslovakia will grant each the 
lowest possible tariffs on their goods. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration earlier awarded the preferential trade status to Poland 
and Hungary in the aftermath of the upheaval in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he was "particularly pleased" to sign the measure at this time 
because he will be in Prague, Czechoslovakia, later this month as part of an 
eight-day trip to Europe and the Persian Gulf.

Second-seeded Mary Joe Fernandez overcame a blister on her serving hand in 
beating Amy Frazier, 6-3, 6-4, in a quarterfinal match in the New England 
Virginia Slims tennis tournament today. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, treated at a hospital for the problem this week, got the hand taped 
by a trainer early in the one-hour, 19-minute match. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had the blister for about three months," Fernandez said. "It bothers me 
on volleys when I have to grip the racket hard. It doesn't bother me as much on 
serves because I hold it more loosely."

STEINBRENNER WOULD HAVE RAISED THE ANTE IF HE'D BEEN AT THE TABLE

<P>
Even at 4 p.m. Thursday, Darryl Strawberry's signing with the Dodgers was news 
to George Steinbrenner. News apparently doesn't travel too quickly to Tampa 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
The revelation startled the Yankees' ex-Boss. It didn't thrill him, either. 
</P>
<P>
Told that Strawberry went West for $20.25 million, Steinbrenner's response was 
a classic: 
</P>
<P>
"That's for four years, right?" 
</P>
<P>
"No" he was told. "That was for five years, George." 
</P>
<P>
"Five years for that? I must be out of touch." 
</P>
<P>
If Steinbrenner were still around, might Strawberry still be in New York? At 
the least, he might have received the first $5-million-a-year offer. 
</P>
<P>
While saying he didn't wish to criticize the Yankees' new regime for its lack 
of interest in Strawberry, Steinbrenner's comments left little doubt: he would 
have pursued the cross-town super hero with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
"All one would have to do is look at what I've done before and you can judge 
for yourself as to what I might have done," said Steinbrenner, who is prevented 
from involving himself in such matters by Commissioner Fay Vincent. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner's appraisal: The Dodgers rolled a seven. "I don't want to 
second-guess my people but Darryl Strawberry is an impact player," Steinbrenner 
said. "It's a fine move for the Dodgers." 
</P>
<P>
Steinbrenner calls letting Reggie Jackson get away to California in 1980 his 
biggest mistake. Of Strawberry, Steinbrenner said, "I wouldn't have let him get 
away."

IGWEBUIKE INDICTED IN HEROIN CASE

<P>
Minnesota Vikings place-kicker Donald Igwebuike was indicted today by a federal 
grand jury on charges he schemed to smuggle heroin from his native Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
Igwebuike was charged with conspiracy to import, conspiracy to possess with 
intent to distribute and the importation of heroin. 
</P>
<P>
Igwebuike's name was linked to the case two weeks ago when ABC News reported 
that prosecutors in Tampa had "irrefutable" evidence connecting the 
place-kicker to an attempt to smuggle heroin into the United States from 
Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
Igwebuike was charged on three counts of a four-count indictment that also 
named Maduwuba Ibekwe and Ibezim Ofedu, who already had been arrested in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Ibekwe was arrested Oct. 12 at Orlando International Airport where a personal 
search by a U.S. Customs Service inspector allegedly resulted in the discovery 
of three pellets containing heroin. 
</P>
<P>
Igwebuike's lawyer has said the football player is a victim of circumstantial 
evidence, which reportedly includes a plane ticket Igwebuike bought for Ibekwe 
and taped telephone conversations between the men. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Larry Reed said Igwebuike simply wanted Ibekwe to rush $12,000 to his 
parents in Anambra, Nigeria. Reed said the kicker's parents received the money. 
</P>
<P>
Custom agents searched Igwebuike's Bloomington, Minn., apartment the day after 
the ABC report and reportedly seized telephone records and other personal 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
Igwebuike has been one of the most accurate and consistent place-kickers in the 
NFL during his career. He spent five years with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and is 
the club's all-time leading scorer with 416 points. 
</P>
<P>
Bucs Coach Ray Perkins released him just before the start of this season, 
saying rookie Steve Christie has a stronger leg and had the potential to become 
a better kicker. Minnesota claimed Igwebuike off waivers, and he has made 14 of 
16 field goals since joining the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, one of the missed attempts was a 48-yarder that would have beaten 
Tampa Bay in overtime Sept. 30.

BORG WON'T GO AGAINST THE GRAIN;

<P>
TENNIS: ONE OF THE GAME'S GREATEST PLAYERS IS TRYING TO MAKE A COMEBACK. BUT HE 
REFUSES TO GIVE UP HIS OLD-FASHIONED WOODEN RACKETS.

<P>
Like an old warrior tempted by the prospect of future battles, Bjorn Borg has 
drawn his trusty wooden sword and begun preparing for a return to tennis. 
</P>
<P>
It has been nearly a decade since Borg won the last of his 11 Grand Slam 
titles. It has been several years since a professional player used a wooden 
racket, still Borg's favorite weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Though most wooden rackets today are consigned to museums or musty closets, 
Borg had 10 of the relics restrung and shipped to him as he began serious 
training this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Percy Rosberg, the Swede's first coach, said Borg tried modern rackets during 
exhibition tours with John McEnroe a few years ago and did not like them. He 
occasionally practices with oversize graphite rackets now, without much 
success. 
</P>
<P>
"He is having a tough time getting used to the new rackets," Rosberg said. 
"Bjorn told me he lost control on the third or fourth stroke in a rally." 
</P>
<P>
Borg has been working out with top British junior players in London. He has 
refused to put a timetable on his comeback or predict whether he'll be able to 
return to the tour. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he's overcome the malaise that led him to quit at the age of 26 and 
that he's enjoying tennis again after a decade of personal and financial 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"When I retired I was not really putting in 100% every match," he said. "Now, 
mentally I feel strong for tennis and I want to put my mind back into it." 
</P>
<P>
But even if Borg is able to work his 34-year-old body into top shape, can a man 
using a wooden racket compete with players such as Pete Sampras, who hits 
serves at 125 m.p.h. with a racket made with space-age technology? 
</P>
<P>
"For sure the game has become more powerful and moved on," Borg said. "That is 
why I have to make sure that physically and mentally I am match-ready." 
</P>
<P>
Other athletes have made gallant comebacks in recent years, but the wooden 
racket sets Borg apart. 
</P>
<P>
George Foreman uses the same gloves as other boxers. Jockey Lester Piggott, who 
rode a winner in the Breeders' Cup last month after a five-year layoff, employs 
the same racing tools as his peers. 
</P>
<P>
Rosberg said graphite rackets increase ball speed by up to 12 m.p.h., which 
means Borg would be using a cannon against a ballistic missile. 
</P>
<P>
Borg, who has denied reports he is seeking a comeback because he needs the 
money, said he is most comfortable with wood. 
</P>
<P>
"I tested other rackets, but I feel at ease with my old one," he said. "Many 
claim that it's impossible to play tennis with a wooden racket nowadays. I know 
it's possible." 
</P>

EDDIE FISHER LIVED 'ON THE EDGE'; 
</P>
<P>
HOLLYWOOD: THE SINGER-ACTOR HAS SOME SOBERING REFLECTIONS ON HIS MISTAKES AND 
SUBSTANCE ABUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Thirty years ago, Eddie Fisher had the world at his feet. His voice made women 
swoon, and his good looks and charisma made him a natural for a movie and 
television career. 
</P>
<P>
To top it off, he married Debbie Reynolds, Elizabeth Taylor and Connie Stevens, 
three undeniably gorgeous and popular actresses. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't come any bigger than Eddie Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
It is strange then that Fisher seems to be remembered best for his failures: 
All three marriages ended in divorce, his well-publicized estrangements from 
his four children and a drug and alcohol addiction that victimized him for 
nearly 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
With the recent release of "Postcards From the Edge," a movie based on the 
semi-autobiographical novel by his daughter, Carrie, his failures are once 
again the topic of some dinner conversations. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh from a monthlong stay at the Betty Ford Clinic, Fisher, 62, admits he 
made mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
"I have four wonderful kids that I never was a father to, and it's tough to 
face up to," said Fisher, who was in Los Angeles recently to attend a birthday 
bash for Carrie. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all talented, wonderful kids. But to have people ask me how our 
relationship is or how I feel about not being a father, that really hurts," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher blames his drug abuse for much of his problems. His descent began April 
17, 1953. Just out of the service, he went to work for Paramount, and the 
grueling schedule made him lose his voice. He was sent to a company doctor. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave me two shots, and all of a sudden I felt great and I could sing again. 
And I said, 'This is for me for life,' " Fisher recalled. 
</P>
<P>
From methamphetamine, commonly known as "speed," Fisher graduated to cocaine, 
alcohol and eventually used prescription drugs to bring himself down from the 
other substances. At its worst, Fisher said, he was taking near-lethal doses 
just to get through the day. 
</P>
<P>
His decision to get help came earlier this year in Orlando, Fla., where Fisher 
was performing at a benefit for children addicted to cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"I found myself a hypocrite. Here I was loaded on cocaine and doing a benefit 
performance for cocaine babies. I broke down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Five months ago, he spent four weeks at the Betty Ford Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm six months sober," he said. "I've never felt better. I'm free and clear. 
Life is easier. I don't have that pressure I put on myself. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're on drugs or alcohol you do a lot of strange things. You're always 
competing with anything. Just being in show business is drug enough. We take 
things to heighten the experience or enhance it, and we really don't understand 
the consequences." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher said the biggest regret he has is not spending time with his four 
children; Todd and Carrie, from his marriage to Reynolds, and Tricia and Joely 
from his marriage to Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
But he readily shoulders most of the blame. 
</P>
<P>
"I could say that Debbie kept me away. But I don't want to say it even though 
it's true," he said. "I could have fought better and harder, but I was under 
the influence. Because of the drugs, they were my passion." 
</P>
<P>
Things are looking up for Fisher. Key to his recovery has been his girlfriend, 
Betty Young Lin, whom he met at her son's wedding in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The two recently saw Reynolds perform at Harrah's in Reno, Nev., and Fisher 
even visited his ex-wife backstage, which he said was quite a step for the 
long-feuding couple. 
</P>
<P>
While in Los Angeles, Fisher took the opportunity to meet with movie executives 
to discuss a movie about his life. Actor Tony Danza has been approached to play 
the lead role. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a long way from completion, but I would like to see it done," Fisher 
said. "I've had an interesting life. It has a happy ending, but there are a lot 
of sad parts. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a great story about how to screw up a career and still live happily 
ever after," Fisher said.

Two days after narrowly defeating Democratic Gov. James J. Blanchard, 
Gov.-elect John Engler told the Legislature on Thursday that he plans to get 
married. 
</P>
<P>
Engler, 42, introduced his fiancee, Houston lawyer Michelle De Munbrun, to his 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"For Michelle and me it's just a wonderful time," the Republican Senate 
majority leader said. 
</P>
<P>
The small, private wedding, scheduled Dec. 8 in San Antonio, will be the second 
for both. Neither has children. 
</P>
<P>
De Munbrun, 33, said she was raised as a Democrat and admitted voting for 
Democrat Ann Richards, who won the governor's race in Texas. But she said she 
voted for Republicans in other races.

COUNTY CAP TEST SCORES ARE ABOVE STATE AVERAGE; 
</P>

IMPROVE IN MATH. BUT READING RESULTS DECLINE SLIGHTLY FOR THE ELEMENTARY AND

<P>
Ventura County students scored above the statewide average on the California 
Assessment Program test last spring, gaining ground over previous county scores 
in math but losing slightly in reading. 
</P>
<P>
Among the 28,431 students who took the test countywide, third- to eighth-grade 
reading scores declined by one to three points over last year, but seniors' 
scores rose five points. 
</P>
<P>
Math scores rose in all grades tested, with increases ranging from three to 
nine points. 
</P>
<P>
The CAP test, given in the spring to third-, sixth- and eighth-grade students 
and in the fall to seniors, covers a variety of subject areas including math, 
reading and writing, as well as history, science and social science for 
eighth-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
Scores are well above state averages in several districts, including Oak Park 
Unified, Conejo Valley Unified, Moorpark Unified and Pleasant Valley Elementary 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
The 18,000-student Simi Valley Unified District, already above both state and 
countywide averages, showed increases last year in most areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We're following the state framework, which means more reading, writing and 
literature across the curriculum, and definitely that helps in the area of 
language arts," Associate Supt. Allan Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the county's lowest scores are in Santa Paula's Briggs Elementary 
School District, Santa Paula Elementary, Fillmore Unified, Oxnard's Rio 
Elementary and Oxnard Elementary, among others. 
</P>
<P>
In the Briggs district, reading scores fell in every grade tested, plunging 54 
points in sixth grade. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not quite sure what happened," Briggs Supt. Carol Vines said. She said 
several factors may have contributed to the decline, including misleading 
reports on the number of students who speak limited English. 
</P>
<P>
Some students who have achieved a level of competency in English on a state 
exam may still not be fluent, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, three of 12 teachers in the district were new last year, she said. "I 
think mostly it was inexperience in preparing the students. I'm not saying it's 
the teachers' fault, but sometimes when you get new staff that happens." 
</P>
<P>
Vines said the district hired a consultant to spend a day with teachers working 
on techniques that can be used daily to prepare students for the kinds of 
questions asked on the test. 
</P>
<P>
Scores were also lower than the state average in the Rio district, with 
declines ranging from 11 to 15 points in reading, and from one to 10 points in 
math. Supt. Peter Rogalsky said district officials will do a school-by-school 
analysis of the scores when they receive a detailed report later this year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to ranking districts statewide, the CAP report compares districts 
with other districts such as theirs, taking into consideration economic 
background and parents' education. The Rio district declined in both rankings. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not satisfied," Rogalsky said. "We should be holding our own with other 
districts and schools that are like ours. We didn't do so well." 
</P>
<P>
As in the Briggs district, Rogalsky said the number of Rio students who speak 
limited English was "very, very grossly under-reported. . . . It may have been 
somewhere where we failed to make the right mark on the transmittal sheet." 
</P>
<P>
The number of limited-English-speakers in third grade last year was reported at 
13.7%, for example, but in fact was closer to 30%, Rogalsky said. 
</P>
<P>
Scores can vary widely from year to year in very small districts especially, 
administrators said, because a few students in a small school who do either 
very well or very poorly can affect a school's overall score. 
</P>
<P>
At the one-school, 30-student Santa Clara Elementary District, for example, the 
third-grade reading score skyrocketed 132 points to a near-perfect 395, putting 
the school in the top 1% of schools in the state in that category. 
</P>
<P>
However, the entire third-grade class at Santa Clara consisted of only five 
students. The previous year, there were six third-grade students, whose reading 
scores were 127 points lower than their predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're dealing with three to five children being tested, it can vary 
greatly," said Ruth Metcalf, Santa Clara principal and one of the district's 
two teachers. "If one child has a great deal of difficulty, and you only have 
four kids, that's 25% who might do very badly." 
</P>
<P>
In the 15,000-student Ventura Unified School District, scores declined in most 
subject areas. Sixth-grade reading scores, for example, were 275, down eight 
points from 1988-89 and a total of 19 points from 1987-88. Still, this year's 
sixth-grade reading scores are 14 points above the state average and the same 
as the average score countywide. 
</P>
<P>
District officials are somewhat concerned about the declines, said Michael 
Sellwood, director of administrative services. 
</P>
<P>
"That's obviously not the direction for the district to be going," Sellwood 
said. "Obviously, we want to look at that trend and try to adjust it." 
</P>
<P>
However, Ventura Unified students' scores remain above statewide averages in 
all areas. 
</P>
<P>
Scores in the Oak Park Unified School District ranged from the top 3% to the 
top 15% statewide in all subject areas. 
</P>
<P>
However, Oak Park Supt. Susan Hearn criticized the test as outdated when 
compared with what teachers are doing in the classroom, which is dictated by 
state curriculum frameworks. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth-grade CAP writing test, for example, measures knowledge of 
punctuation, capitalization and other language usage, Hearn said. However, 
teachers are "emphasizing content, how kids say what it is they're trying to 
say." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the CAP math test concentrates on computation skills at the 
sixth-grade level, but in state guidelines that are followed in the classroom, 
computation is one of seven areas of emphasis, including statistics, geometry 
and problem-solving, Hearn said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, teachers concentrate "more on why an answer is correct, rather than just 
getting to the correct answer," Hearn said. 
</P>
<P>
But Hearn said the CAP test remains valuable in assessing how well students are 
learning. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed funds for CAP tests from the 1990-91 state 
budget, and it is uncertain whether the funding will be restored by Gov.-elect 
Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
If the test is not administered, Hearn said, the "lapse, I think, is going to 
be very unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW TO READ THE SCORES 
</P>
<P>
These are results of the California Assessment Program test for third, sixth 
and eighth grades. 
</P>
<P>
State officials say the scores are intended to provide a way to assess 
schoolwide academic performance. Students do not receive individual scores. 
</P>
<P>
Schools are listed alphabetically by district. Scores are scaled between 
approximately 100 and 400, although a few scores may be higher or lower. A 
school's scores may be compared to district and state averages. For example, if 
the third grade at your school scored 295 in math, and the state average is 
283, children at your school are performing at a higher level than most 
third-graders statewide. 
</P>
<P>
In general, a fluctuation of 10 points or less should not cause alarm, although 
state education officials say that the margin of error varies depending upon 
the size of the school. 
</P>
<P>
Students in grades three and six last spring were given multiple-choice tests 
in reading, written language (including grammar and spelling) and mathematics. 
Last spring's eighth-graders were tested in reading, math, history-social 
sciences and science. Eighth-graders also took an essay test to assess their 
writing skills. Results of the essay test are expected next month. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases a specialized or "magnet" school has its campus on the grounds of 
a regular school. State officials have combined the scores, so separate results 
are not available. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STATEWIDE AVERAGES 
</P>
<P>
These statewide averages may be useful in comparing the performance of students 
in elementary and junior high or middle schools.

SAMPLE QUESTION FOR SIXTH-GRADERS 
</P>
<P>
 Illustrative social studies passage: 
</P>
<P>
In 1860, a Midwestern stagecoach company let people know about an exciting new 
plan which would affect our entire country. The company planned a faster mail 
service to California -- the Pony Express, which would deliver the mail in 10 
days or less. 
</P>
<P>
Strong young men were the riders. Buffalo Bill was one of the famous ones. 
These men had to have courage. Every day they faced many kinds of danger. They 
had been told, "Remember, you travel alone and the country is wild and rugged. 
You may be cold, hungry, wet and tired, but you must go on! The mail must go 
through!" And it did go through! 
</P>
<P>
Over the saddle of the Pony Express horses was hung a leather blanket or 
"mochila." In the four pockets of it were the tissue-thin letters. Five dollars 
was the usual price for sending a letter. 
</P>
<P>
The route cut directly across from Missouri to Sacramento. Each rider rode 
nonstop for about 100 miles, and then a new rider took over. The horses used 
were chosen for speed and were changed every 10 miles. Quickly the mail was 
thrown over the saddle of the fresh horse, much like a relay race. Horses were 
saddled and ready to go at every station. With a leap, the rider was in the 
saddle -- and off like the wind! 
</P>
<P>
 Illustrative test questions: 
</P>
<P>
What do you think would usually happen when the rider reached Sacramento? 
</P>
<P>
a. He would go to New York. 
</P>
<P>
b. He would eat and rest. 
</P>
<P>
c. He would brand horses. 
</P>
<P>
d. He would meet Buffalo Bill. 
</P>
<P>
The "mochila" used by the Pony Express rider can best be compared to the 
</P>
<P>
a. sleeping bag used by the camper. 
</P>
<P>
b. sandpaper used by the carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
c. mail pouch used by the mail carrier. 
</P>
<P>
d. pen used to write and letter. 
</P>
<P>
You can conclude from the passage that 
</P>
<P>
a. someone at each station prepared a fresh horse for the rider. 
</P>
<P>
b. Buffalo Bill was bored by the Pony Express. 
</P>
<P>
c. the worst danger was from the cold. 
</P>
<P>
d. few people ever heard about the Pony Express.

HOW TO READ THE SCORES 
</P>
<P>
These are results of the California Assessment Program test for third, sixth 
and eighth grades. 
</P>
<P>
State officials say the scores are intended to provide a way to assess 
schoolwide academic performance. Students do not receive individual scores. 
</P>
<P>
Schools are listed alphabetically by district. Scores are scaled between 
approximately 100 and 400, although a few scores may be higher or lower. A 
school's scores may be compared to district and state averages. For example, if 
the third grade at your school scored 295 in math, and the state average is 
283, children at your school are performing at a higher level than most 
third-graders statewide. 
</P>
<P>
In general, a fluctuation of 10 points or less should not cause alarm, although 
state education officials say that the margin of error varies depending upon 
the size of the school. 
</P>
<P>
Students in grades three and six last spring were given multiple-choice tests 
in reading, written language (including grammar and spelling) and mathematics. 
Last spring's eighth-graders were tested in reading, math, history-social 
sciences and science. Eighth-graders also took an essay test to assess their 
writing skills. Results of the essay test are expected next month. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases a specialized or "magnet" school has its campus on the grounds of 
a regular school. State officials have combined the scores, so separate results 
are not available. 
</P>
<P>
These scores are for schools in the central Los Angeles area. Scores for other 
Los Angeles Unified schools appeared previously in this section. Additional 
scores will appear in appropriate suburban sections over the next several days. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STATEWIDE AVERAGES 
</P>
<P>
These statewide averages may be useful in comparing the performance of students 
in elementary and junior high or middle schools.
