DEUKMEJIAN BACKER HELPED KILL THRIFT PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
BANKING: LEAGUE OF SAVINGS INSTITUTIONS PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE LIMITED RISKY 
INVESTMENTS.

<P>
Working on behalf of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, Gov. George Deukmejian's top 
political fund-raiser participated in a behind-the-scenes effort in 1985 that 
killed a proposed regulation that would have limited the kinds of risky 
investments that contributed to the thrift's failure, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles attorney Karl Samuelian, Deukmejian's campaign finance chairman, 
joined other prominent supporters of the governor at a November, 1985, meeting 
in the office of then-Assembly Republican Leader Pat Nolan of Glendale in an 
effort to persuade the lawmaker to fight the proposed industry-backed 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Also at the meeting were Deukmejian's former savings and loan commissioner, 
Lawrence W. Taggart, and San Diego financier Tom Stickel, a top GOP fund-raiser 
and a gubernatorial appointee to the board of trustees for the state university 
system. 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, officials of the California League of Savings Institutions -- 
trying to clean up its own industry -- sought Nolan's endorsement for a 
regulation restricting risky direct investments in real estate, stocks and junk 
bonds by state-chartered thrifts. But the opposition to their proposal by 
Nolan, Stickel and Taggart was so strong that the League simply backed down and 
abandoned its effort, industry officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We just felt whipped," recalled Jerry Barrone, then the chairman of the League 
and president of Coast Savings in Los Angeles, who attended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Barrone said he had not known who Samuelian was before the meeting, nor was 
Deukmejian's name ever mentioned in discussing the regulation. In fact, he 
said, Samuelian was relatively quiet during the discussion. But, in the middle 
of the meeting, a Nolan staffer interrupted the session to tell Samuelian that 
the governor had telephoned him and he needed to return the call. 
</P>
<P>
Samuelian could not be reached for comment but his attorney confirmed he 
attended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a call from Karl's secretary saying that the governor was trying to 
reach him," Robert S. Draper, Samuelian's attorney, said. Although Samuelian 
was representing Lincoln at the meeting, "the call had nothing to do with (the 
investment issue)," Draper said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Barrone remembers suspecting at the time that the interruption was 
done for effect. "We thought it was done for saber-rattling purposes," he said, 
to show that "these people were in with the governor." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Deukmejian emphatically denied any knowledge of efforts by 
Lincoln and its owner, Charles H. Keating Jr., to pressure his Administration 
into approving expansion of its high-risk investments and authorizing bond 
sales of its parent corporation, American Continental Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In April of this year, American Continental declared bankruptcy and federal 
regulators took over operations of the thrift. It has been estimated that 
Lincoln's collapse could cost taxpayers as much as $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the American Continental bankruptcy this year, Samuelian was 
among a long list of people associated with the company who were named in a 
series of lawsuits filed on behalf of 23,000 investors in the Irvine-based 
thrift. The investors, many of them Southern California retirees, claim to have 
lost $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
Keating and his thrift have been heavy contributors to Deukmejian and Nolan -- 
as well as many major politicians of both parties. Keating, his business 
enterprises and associates have contributed an estimated $189,000 to 
Deukmejian's campaign committees and at least $20,000 to Nolan. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan was the author of 1982 legislation that lifted restrictions on savings 
and loans investments. The purpose was to make the thrifts more competitive 
with banks. 
</P>
<P>
But as increasing numbers of savings institutions began to fail, the industry 
itself sought regulations to ensure the safety of its investments. It proposed 
that State Savings and Loan Commissioner William J. Crawford adopt a rule 
limiting high-risk investments to 20% of an institution's holdings. 
</P>
<P>
However, Nolan said Thursday that he was fearful that the California League 
proposal would be too restrictive and would not get at problems of poorly 
managed savings and loans. "I had strong feelings that arbitrary regulations 
wouldn't help, that they would hurt the good (savings) associations," Nolan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The assemblyman said he convened a meeting at his office at the industry's 
request, but also invited Deukmejian fund-raiser Stickel and former Savings and 
Loan Commissioner Taggart to state their objections to the proposal. Confronted 
with opposition to their proposal from the Assembly Minority Leader and 
influential political allies of Deukmejian, the industry withdrew its proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"The feeling was we got beat up pretty well at this meeting and we wouldn't get 
anywhere with such a strong groundswell of opposition," Barrone said. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Nolan said, he called Commissioner Crawford to argue against 
the proposed regulations. Crawford ultimatedly scuttled the proposal, but 
contended that he did it at the request of the League, not because of Nolan's 
call. 
</P>
<P>
Stickel's opposition to the proposed regulation came less than a year after his 
company, TCS Enterprises, went public and Lincoln bought 19% of its stock for 
$2.9 million. Stickel had also hired Taggart as an executive, who was acting as 
a paid consultant to Keating. 
</P>
<P>
Stickel said he tried to ensure that Nolan's 1982 legislation was not tampered 
with and that regulators "were very careful before they revised the laws in any 
way that restricted savings and loans from doing business the way it had to be 
conducted in the 1980s to survive." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Lincoln's investment in TCS, the Irvine-based thrift had a 
further tie with Stickel's fledgling San Diego company, which pulled off an 
industry coup by hiring Taggart after his resignation as the state's savings 
and loan commissioner. Lincoln paid TCS an additional $200,000 in 1985 to use 
Taggart's consulting services on industry and regulatory matters, Stickel said. 
</P>
<P>
Stickel said Thursday that his opposition to the proposed 20% regulation was 
"absolutely not" connected to the fact that Lincoln was the second largest 
investor in TCS Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
But the San Diego Republican, who was one of those considered by Deukmejian for 
appointment to the state treasurer's seat vacated by the death of Jesse Unruh, 
conceded that he sometimes did favors for Keating and his company. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie Keating's political reach, in retrospect, was phenomenal," Stickel 
said Thursday. "And I wasn't the only one taken in as it relates to being an 
advocate for Charlie Keating. I had no reason -- in 1985, 1986, 1987 -- not to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
"People from his office would call me with concerns and if I shared their 
concerns, I could be an advocate on their behalf," said Stickel. "If I ran into 
a state assemblyman here or a state senator there -- and I am obviously a 
Republican activist -- and, if given the chance to talk about issues relevant 
to savings and loans and deregulations, I probably would have been off of the 
same page as Charlie Keating." 
</P>
<P>
Stickel said there was only one time when Keating himself asked the San Diego 
financier for a favor. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a prominent savings and loan executive who Charlie Keating wanted to 
meet and I tried to put them together but the other executive said 'no,' " 
Stickel said. 
</P>
<P>
Stickel said he was not going to be an "apologist" for Keating, now the center 
of several lawsuits, investigations and Congressional hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pushing the clock back four years ago and Monday morning quarterbacking, 
but in 1985, I had no reason to believe that Charlie Keating was nothing other 
than a good and well-intentioned businessman," Stickel said.

Torrential rains and melting snow engorged hundreds of streams in the Cascade 
Mountains, washing out a bridge and sending the Snoqualmie River over its banks 
amid warnings of possible major flooding. Tons of rock crashed down in the 
early morning on the North Cascades Highway, 5 miles east of Newhalem, closing 
the road to traffic. A wall of water washed out the bridge over Glacier Creek 
on the Mt. Baker Highway. Rising waters also forced the evacuation of 
approximately 15 people from a campground near Fall City.

The infant boy born to a shooting victim died, two weeks after his mother was 
killed and his father wounded when they were held up outside a childbirth class 
in Boston. The cause of death was not immediately released, a spokeswoman for 
Brigham and Women's Hospital said. Christopher Stuart had struggled for life in 
the hospital's neonatal intensive-care unit since his delivery by emergency 
Cesarean section hours after his mother, Carol Stuart, 30, a lawyer who was 
seven months pregnant, was shot in the head by a gunman who held up the couple 
on Oct. 30. Charles Stuart, 29, was shot in the abdomen and was listed in 
stable condition at Boston City Hospital.

The House, responding to the Alaska oil spill, approved legislation setting the 
liability of those who cause spills and creating a $1-billion federal fund to 
ensure full environmental protection and compensation. The measure, adopted 375 
to 5, would limit the liability for those who cause spills and authorize use of 
the federal fund to pay for cleanup costs and damages above the liability 
ceiling. The fund would be financed by a special tax on oil. The Senate already 
has approved a similar bill, setting the stage for a House-Senate conference 
committee to work out differences between the two chambers. The House bill 
would create a comprehensive federal liability system to ensure sufficient 
money is available to conduct speedy and thorough cleanups and to promptly 
compensate fishermen and property owners.

A top federal safety official told Congress on Thursday that a crack in a jet 
engine rotor suspected in the United Air Lines Flight 232 crash may have formed 
the first time the engine was cranked up. 
</P>
<P>
James Kolstad, acting chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, 
also told the House Science, Space and Technology's aviation subcommittee that 
it is still unclear whether the crack could have been detected during the last 
engine inspection before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
The jetliner, a DC-10, crash-landed at Sioux City, Iowa, on July 19 following 
an explosion in the tail-mounted engine that shot engine parts across the tail 
surface, rupturing all three hydraulic flight control systems.

ARTHUR J. HOLLAND; FORMER MAYOR OF TRENTON, N.J. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arthur J. Holland, mayor of Trenton, N.J. for nearly three decades and recent 
president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, died Thursday of cancer in a 
Trenton hospital. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Holland ended his term as president of the conference in June, 
the nationwide group gave him its highest honor, the Distinguished Public 
Service Award. Previous recipients included Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey 
and Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley. 
</P>
<P>
Holland had announced last June that, because of inoperable lung and liver 
cancer, he would not seek reelection but would remain in office as long as 
physically possible. His term ends next June. 
</P>
<P>
After beginning his public service career in Trenton's Department of Public 
Affairs in 1951, Holland was first elected mayor in 1959, when the city still 
had a commission form of government. He had served continuously since then, 
except for four years after he failed to win reelection in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
In his four years out of office, Holland served as adjunct research professor 
in the Urban Studies Center at Rutgers University, acting city manager of 
nearby Passaic, N.J., and consultant to the U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development, the Brookings Institution and the National Institute of 
Public Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the versatile mayor wrote a children's book, "The Adventures of Bernie 
Bean," about a happy Mexican jumping bean who travels from Manhattan to Paris 
and then winds up living in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
A respected national spokesman for the urban poor, Holland enjoyed talking with 
inner-city children. To demonstrate his commitment to civil rights, in 1964 the 
mayor moved his family into a racially mixed neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
When President Bush took office last January, Holland optimistically sought $6 
billion for U.S. cities through Urban Development Action Grants, law 
enforcement assistance, money for the homeless, clean-water construction 
grants, and funding for child care and youth education programs. 
</P>
<P>
"To be a mayor," he explained of his wish list, "is to live in hope." 
</P>
<P>
Holland was born Oct. 24, 1918, in Trenton and earned his bachelor's degree in 
social studies and a master's degree in public administration from Rutgers. 
</P>
<P>
A Roman Catholic, he spent six years at a seminary, but did not enter the 
priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
In 1962, during his first term as mayor, Holland married Elizabeth Anne 
Jackson, who ran unsuccessfully for Congress last year against Rep. Christopher 
H. Smith (R-N.J.). 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife and their three sons and two daughters.

<TEXT>
<P>
Yusaku Matsuda, who portrayed a young killer opposite Michael Douglas in the 
current popular film "Black Rain," has died of bladder cancer in Tokyo, Reuters 
news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
The news service quoted Japanese media sources as saying Matsuda, who portrays 
a renegade becoming a powerful force in the underworld, died Monday night. He 
was 40. 
</P>
<P>
The tall, chain-smoking Matsuda, who played Douglas' adversary in the picture 
about a macho cop from New York City who is trying to bring back an extradited 
murderer from Japan, was virtually unknown outside Japan until the release of 
the detective thriller, which was set and photographed in the western Japanese 
city of Osaka.

HORSE DEATH TOLL RISES AS OFFICIALS RECALL HAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State officials Thursday ordered a recall of up to 1,000 tons of hay cubes that 
may be tainted by a deadly toxin as the death toll of horses continued to grow. 
</P>
<P>
One more horse was destroyed at the Orange County Fairgrounds Equestrian Center 
late Wednesday, bringing the total to 16. 
</P>
<P>
Botulism has been blamed in the horses' deaths in four Southern California 
counties, and veterinarians believe the powerful toxin was hidden in hay cubes 
manufactured in Utah and shipped to at least 60 stables in the Southland, 
officials said. Only a portion of the compressed hay cakes tested have been 
found to contain botulism. 
</P>
<P>
But as a precaution, a regionwide roundup has been ordered of the candy-bar 
sized cubes distributed by Paramount Cubing of Paramount, said Stanley 
Buscombe, head of the feed and fertilizer branch of the state Department of 
Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
The tainted hay cubes have not yet surfaced in San Diego County, according to 
San Diego County Veterinarian Hubert Johnstone. "We haven't had any unusual 
reports of horse mortality," Johnstone said. "And I think we would have heard" 
if horses had died, Johnstone said. 
</P>
<P>
Horse owners are probably "not feeding their horses hay until they know for 
sure" if their feed supply was safe, Johnstone said. 
</P>
<P>
It is highly unlikely that the tainted product had been shipped as far south as 
San Diego County, according to feed store owners and operators in North County. 
</P>
<P>
"I know of no large equestrian centers that even use cubes," said Paul 
McFadden, president of Escondido-based McFadden Feed Co. "And I don't know of 
any feed stores that even sell cubes." 
</P>
<P>
Most of San Diego's hay comes direct from the Imperial Valley, feed store 
owners said. "All this is going to do is hurt some (Imperial Valley farmers) 
whose reputations don't deserve to be hurt," said another feed store owner. 
</P>
<P>
Buscombe said no complaints have been filed against Paramount Cubing, adding 
that the company has voluntarily suspended all shipments of hay cubes and is 
cooperating with the recall.

Congressmen looking into problems in the U.S. Postal Service will conduct a 
hearing next month in San Diego where several postal employees have killed 
themselves and others in the past year, Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) said. 
Bates sent a letter last summer to the General Accounting Office, calling for a 
probe of the management practices of the U.S. Postal Service. The letter 
followed the Aug. 10 shooting rampage of John M. Taylor, an Escondido postal 
worker who killed his wife and two co-workers before fatally shooting himself. 
Prior to the rampage, four other county postal workers had committed suicide in 
1989. Co-workers had said that the deaths were related to job stress, but 
postal officials blamed them on the employees' personal problems.

COURT RECORDS SAY BRODERICK PLANNED SUICIDE; 
</P>

CRIME: ACCORDING TO AN AFFIDAVIT, LAWYER'S FORMER WIFE WAS ONE BULLET SHORT

Elisabeth Broderick had planned to kill herself but was one bullet short after 
she emptied a five-shot revolver in her ex-husband's bedroom, according to a 
court affidavit filed in the double slaying of lawyer-doctor Daniel T. 
Broderick III and his new wife, Linda. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police investigators' reports also show that a Broderick family 
friend said Elisabeth was so obsessed about losing custody of her children 
after the divorce that she had "felt like killing Dan" as long as five years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Elisabeth Broderick was booked Sunday on suspicion of two counts of murder 
after allegedly entering her ex-husband's Hillcrest home earlier that morning 
and shooting him and his bride while they were sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the killings came after a long, bitter divorce between 
Elisabeth and Daniel Broderick in which Elisabeth hated her ex-husband, 
tormented him and was obsessed over losing custody of their two boys and two 
girls. 
</P>
<P>
The records, indicating that Elisabeth Broderick also had planned to take her 
own life, were submitted in Municipal Court on behalf of a warrant to search 
her La Jolla condominium in the 3100 block of Morning Way. 
</P>
<P>
According to the affidavit, she telephoned friends Sunday shortly after the 
5:30 a.m. killings. 
</P>
<P>
"Betty was at a phone booth in Clairemont and said she had just shot Dan and 
Linda in bed at their home and that she intended to commit suicide," the 
affidavit said. "She said she thought she had a bullet left but didn't." 
</P>
<P>
The court records also indicated that Elisabeth Broderick said she had left a 
suicide note at her home on Calle del Cielo in La Jolla, but apparently no note 
was ever found. 
</P>
<P>
However, police did recover an empty, five-shot revolver in her purse. They 
also found records relating to her protracted divorce from Daniel Broderick, a 
former San Diego County Bar Assn. president, in her kitchen and dining room. In 
her basement they found a family photo album and a book titled, "What's a Nice 
Girl to Do?" 
</P>
<P>
Helen Picard, told police that her close friend, Elisabeth Broderick, had a key 
to her ex-husband's home on Cypress Avenue, the affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
Police also interviewed Kathy Broderick, one of the couple's daughters. 
</P>
<P>
"She said her mother was very distraught and told her that she had shot at her 
father inside his house," the affidavit said. "She said that her mother didn't 
know if she hit him or not." 
</P>
<P>
Police have said five shots were fired in the upstairs master bedroom of the 
large, Colonial-style home where Daniel and Linda Broderick, married in April, 
lived. Two bullets struck Linda, one hit Daniel and the remaining two struck a 
bedside table and the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities noted that Daniel and Elisabeth Broderick had been going to court 
for years over legal custody of their two pre-teen sons and two college-age 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
"When the girls reached 18, they left the household of Mr. Broderick, and 
apparently he had refused to pay for their college educations," the court 
records said. 
</P>
<P>
The divorce eventually resulted in Daniel Broderick paying his ex-wife $16,000 
a month in spousal support, and Elisabeth was planning recently to go back to 
court to obtain custody of the children, the records showed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that is what did it," Brian Forbes, a family friend, told police. "She 
wanted to have the kids but knew she couldn't. When the kids were with her, she 
would buy them everything they wanted, just so they would want to live with 
her. I know the kids told Dan they wanted to live with their mom." 
</P>
<P>
But the investigative reports show that Robert Vaage, a business associate of 
Daniel Broderick's, told police a different story, saying that Broderick was 
considering relinquishing custody of the younger children. 
</P>
<P>
"Several days ago, he told me Betty was going to court and trying to get 
custody of the boys," Vaage told police. "Dan wasn't sure if he should fight 
her on that. The boys had told Dan they wanted to live with their mom. 
</P>
<P>
"Dan stated if there was a doctor who would tell him the kids would be safe 
with Betty, he would not fight her." 
</P>
<P>
Vaage, in his interview with police, added: 
</P>
<P>
"It was common knowledge Dan and Linda (the new wife) were thinking of starting 
a family of their own. This made Betty real upset because she figured Linda was 
getting everything." 
</P>
<P>
However, Forbes told police that the animosity ran much deeper than that. 
</P>
<P>
"Even before the divorce, they had a lot of difficulties," he said. "About five 
years ago, she told me she felt like killing Dan. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew she bought a gun, a .357 magnum, about two years ago. I also knew she 
often went to the pistol range, there next to I-5, and practiced her shooting." 
</P>
<P>
"I knew this could happen," he added about the double homicide. "But I just 
didn't want to believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Elisabeth Broderick remains in County Jail at Las Colinas without bail. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service for Daniel and Linda Broderick is scheduled for 9 a.m. today 
at St. Joseph's Cathedral downtown.

CAL STATE SAN MARCOS SETS ITS SIGHTS ON THE WORLD; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: FACULTY MEMBERS AT THE NEW STATE UNIVERSITY ADOPT A MISSION 
STATEMENT THAT EMPHASIZES LIBERAL ARTS AND A GLOBAL OUTLOOK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new state university in San Marcos will make its mark with an international 
focus while steeping its students in liberal arts, according to a statement 
adopted Thursday that outlines the founding faculty's vision for the 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
The statement avoids specifics and was adopted after some consternation among 
the faculty over how clear-cut the university's science agenda should be. 
</P>
<P>
One feature was the aim for a global outlook. 
</P>
<P>
The university "endorses an international perspective that addresses the global 
community in social, political and economic terms," the document reads. "This 
multicultural outlook is reflected in our curriculum, extracurricular 
activities, international exchanges and special programs that focus on world 
issues and problems. We prepare students to take leadership roles in areas of 
work and society in the international community of the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
Although the statement doesn't get more specific, faculty members note that, 
already, two international research centers are being established on the 
campus. One, headed by Prof. William Liu, will study gerontology among Asians. 
The other, headed by Prof. Isabel Schon, will study Spanish-language literature 
for children. 
</P>
<P>
"Consistent with its global orientation, the university exposes students to the 
study of languages, to world literature and the fine arts, and to issues and 
traditions of the United States and other countries," the statement continues. 
To that end, faculty members say, students in a variety of majors will probably 
be required to take a year's study in a foreign language for graduation. 
</P>
<P>
But the faculty also was in strong agreement that Cal State San Marcos should 
evolve as a "user-friendly" campus more like a small college than the 
sprawling, commuter campus it will one day become. 
</P>
<P>
The mission statement will now be forwarded to university President Bill Stacy, 
who indicated Thursday that he may strengthen the science emphasis but who 
otherwise said he was delighted by the faculty's philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who will first look to it for guidance will be me and the faculty, 
because it will be the foundation on which we'll build, and the measurer for 
the kinds of programs that will be considered here," Stacy said. "We'll use 
this mission statement in recruiting new faculty, by showing it to them and 
asking them if this is the kind of place where they can be comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
The 20th Cal State university, operating out of leased offices in San Marcos, 
will hold its first classes next fall for juniors and graduate students, and 
will expand to accept seniors in the fall of 1991. Freshmen will be admitted in 
fall of 1995. The first permanent campus buildings are scheduled to open in the 
fall of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Only the founding 12 faculty members are on board at Cal State San Marcos; 20 
more will be hired before next fall. Majors have not yet been adopted, but 
tentative choices include biology, business accounting, business management, 
history, liberal studies, mathematics, psychology and sociology. 
</P>
<P>
Adopting the mission statement is part of the protocol of establishing a 
university, intended to offer students and the community a sense of the 
institution's philosophy and broad-brush objectives. 
</P>
<P>
The 12 faculty members deliberated over the statement two months and pored over 
nine revisions before adopting the final draft Thursday, which concluded: 
</P>
<P>
"The goal of California State University, San Marcos, is to instill in its 
students the enthusiasm and curiosity, the creativity and originality, the 
healthy skepticism and the habit of continuing inquiry that are central to all 
truly educated men and women." 
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the university "expects a high level of academic 
scholarship in research and teaching, and protects academic freedom requisite 
to such scholarly pursuits." 
</P>
<P>
Outside the classroom, the university will offer "cultural enrichment in an 
intellectually stimulating environment" and serve "as a focus for community 
social activities, art, music and sporting events." 
</P>
<P>
The two-page document calls for the university to be responsive to its students 
and the North County community as a whole, but says the institution will look 
beyond Southern California in preparing students. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most ticklish issue in developing the statement was defining to 
what degree the university will pursue the sciences -- a favorite subject among 
North County business and industrial leaders who say they hope the new campus 
will generate young, new scientists. 
</P>
<P>
Much debate on Thursday, for instance, focused on the proposed statement: "The 
university stimulates scientific research and development in collaboration with 
public and private organizations in the area, and serves as a resource for 
books, ideas, computing and other technology." 
</P>
<P>
Around a conference table, some professors suggested that the word "scientific" 
be dropped because it was suggested that the university would not pursue 
research and development in non-scientific areas. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Cohen, a molecular geneticist, cringed. "Doesn't it diminish the 
significance of science if we leave it out?" he asked. It was, however, dropped 
from the sentence, and the only one siding with Cohen was K. Brooks Reid, a 
mathematician.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: JAILED PRIEST INSPIRED TO PROTEST BY READING MARTIN LUTHER 
KING JR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just who is this Edward Kaicher and what made him become the first priest from 
the San Diego Catholic Diocese to be jailed for anti-abortion activism? 
</P>
<P>
Does his incarceration at the Descanso honor camp for blockading abortion 
clinics foreshadow increased militancy among the Catholic clergy? 
</P>
<P>
Answer one: He's a 35-year-old native of Lakeside, a graduate of the University 
of San Diego and a Benedictine seminary in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
He had protested the treatment of Latin American refugees by the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service but had never been arrested. He decided civil 
disobedience was morally justified in the abortion demonstrations after reading 
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
He promises to continue his anti-abortion protests, including further arrests, 
and wants to minister to the migrants of North County when he returns to his 
parish in Solana Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Answer two: More militancy? Maybe so, maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
When Kaicher was ordered to Descanso last week to begin his 45-day sentence, 
his first visitor was Bishop Robert H. Brom, coadjutor of the San Diego Diocese 
and future successor to Bishop Leo T. Maher. 
</P>
<P>
Kaicher and Brom talked and prayed. A joint news conference may be held when 
Kaicher is released. With time off for good behavior, that should be by 
Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
As a trusty, Kaicher has relative freedom within the barbed-wire fences but 
returns to the crowded dormitory at night. He receives no special privileges. 
</P>
<P>
He celebrates Mass for fellow prisoners. Jail officials say he is receiving 
more than 200 letters a day. 
</P>
<P>
"One woman wrote that I was her hero," Kaicher said. "That's wrong. I know that 
I am as sinful and unworthy as any man. I'm just someone who has had God hit 
him in the heart." 
</P>
<P>
He is troubled that the pro-choice movement says protesters like him are 
cruelly inflicting pain on women who are seeking the clinic's services. Unlike 
other protesters, he won't shout at the women. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not there because I'm against the women," Kaicher said. "I'm there because 
I'm against what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
On the Road With the Chorus 
</P>
<P>
Notes from the chorus. 
</P>
<P>
Since its formation in 1928, the main duty of the Red Army Chorus has been to 
entertain Soviet troops. It did 1,500 concerts during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
That's why U.S. Navy types who organized the two free concerts on San Diego 
naval bases dubbed the chorus, "The Bob Hopeski Show." 
</P>
<P>
The sight of the Red Army Chorus performing with the U.S. amphibious assault 
ship Belleau Wood as a backdrop sent Capt. James Prout III, commander of the 
San Diego Naval Base, scurrying for explanation: 
</P>
<P>
"The times certainly are a-changin'. If you'd have told me just a year ago that 
I'd see this many boatswain's mates waiting to see some Soviet men dance, I'd 
have ordered you to undergo immediate drug testing." 
</P>
<P>
Among those present at the chorus' concert Thursday at the 32nd Street Naval 
Station was Soviet television anchorwoman Svetlana Bestuzheva. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet standards for anchor women are different than ours. 
</P>
<P>
Bestuzheva is short and grandmotherly. She also holds a doctorate in art 
history and has been decorated for patriotism by the Soviet government. 
</P>
<P>
Report in a Plain Brown Wrapper 
</P>
<P>
Copies of House of Representatives Report 101-293 are making the political 
rounds in San Diego. The 58-page document with the plain brown cover is the 
final report of the House ethics committee "in the matter of Representative Jim 
Bates." 
</P>
<P>
The committee last month issued a gentle reprimand to the San Diego Democrat 
for sexually harassing female staff members and improperly using his office for 
campaigning. Now the complete report is out. 
</P>
<P>
Among other transgressions, one former employee says Bates got drunk at a 
fund-raiser for Gary Hart and grabbed her knee. He denies it. 
</P>
<P>
Another ex-employee says Bates "mentioned to her over the phone that he was 
naked." He denies that, too.

2 DRUG DEALERS GUILTY DESPITE DEPUTY SCANDAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MERINA and DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a partial victory for Los Angeles County prosecutors, two drug dealers 
pleaded guilty Thursday in a cocaine-trafficking case even though a sheriff's 
deputy implicated in a money-skimming scandal was a key witness against them. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the first time that prosecutors had salvaged a case involving 
sheriff's deputies suspected of stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
drug raids. 
</P>
<P>
Local and federal prosecutors had lost eight consecutive cases since the 
scandal broke Sept. 1, either because the Sheriff's Department refused to 
provide investigative records about 18 suspended deputies or the deputies 
themselves would not testify. 
</P>
<P>
Three suspended deputies were involved in Thursday's case, including an 
undercover officer who arranged a 220-pound cocaine deal with three men 
described by law enforcement officers as members of a major Colombian cocaine 
smuggling-and-distribution ring. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Archival and David Alvarado pleaded guilty to possession of money 
acquired through drug sales after prosecutors agreed to sharply reduce their 
prison terms from a maximum of 20 years to no more than three years. Charges 
against Archival's brother, William, were dropped entirely in a carefully 
negotiated deal. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel better," said Robert Schirn, head of the district attorney's major 
narcotics division, referring to the two guilty pleas. "If getting what you 
think the case is worth is a victory, then I suppose it is." 
</P>
<P>
Several months ago, before the money-skimming allegations surfaced, all three 
men had agreed to a plea bargain with long jail terms, prosecutors said. But 
the case against them was damaged because testimony of the suspended officers 
could no longer be used, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The men were arrested last May in a "reverse sting" operation in West Los 
Angeles. They were accused of trying to buy 220 pounds of cocaine with $1.1 
million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Archival, 34, faced eight felony charges that included possession of a 
handgun and explosives before accepting a three-year sentence. Alvarado, 32, 
who also faces drug-trafficking charges in North Carolina, pleaded guilty in 
exchange for a two-year prison term. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys said they agreed to a plea bargain because they feared that 
Superior Court Judge Alexander H. Williams III, unlike judges in prior cases, 
would not dismiss their case. 
</P>
<P>
Richard A. Hamar, the attorney for Daniel Archival, said he thought that 
Williams, a former federal prosecutor, would "have fashioned an order" that 
would have allowed the district attorney to take the case to trial, where a 
jury could convict his client. 
</P>
<P>
"They could have had a jury sitting there, considering my client with close to 
$1 million in a drug deal for 100 kilos of cocaine," Hamar said. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney James Blatt, who represented Alvarado, said he saw little choice but 
to bargain, because he was certain the judge "would have tried to tailor his 
decision to keep the case alive." 
</P>
<P>
Williams would not say whether he would have ordered the case to trial, but in 
an interview Thursday he characterized himself as "a conservative fellow." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not afraid of doing whatever the law requires, but I make sure it is 
required," the judge said about the possibility of dismissing the case. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Schirn has maintained that Thursday's case and up to 10 other major 
cases involving suspended deputies should be allowed to go to trial because 
officers untouched by the scandal are available to testify to the facts of 
arrests and searches. He said state Supreme Court decisions support his 
position. 
</P>
<P>
And, even though eight cases have been dismissed by judges or withdrawn by 
prosecutors, Schirn noted that "in most of the cases there weren't any backup 
witnesses." 
</P>
<P>
Schirn would not predict whether Thursday's guilty pleas will have a broad 
impact, but defense attorney Hamar said the absence of dismissals in the case 
"give (prosecutors) the club to get pleas in the rest" of the cases involving 
suspended deputies. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just the beginning," he said. "Things are now evolving and each case 
is going to be thought out more carefully." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly obscured in Thursday's legal maneuvering were allegations by Daniel 
Archival of missing cash. In an interview with The Times, Archival claimed 
that, in addition to the $1.1 million seized, deputies took another $400,000 
from him that was never turned in as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Hamar said in court documents that "a substantial amount of money" had been 
stolen during his client's arrest and that he planned to base his defense on a 
claim that the sheriff's investigation was conceived so officers could skim 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Macario Duran, the undercover officer who proposed a cocaine deal to 
Alvarado, was suspended a month ago in the money-skimming probe. Sgt. Kenneth 
Allen and Deputy J. C. Miller, who were relieved of duty at the same time, also 
participated in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
However, prosecutors said that at least seven other sheriff's officers were 
available to testify.

NORTH COUNTY HOMELESS 'SUMMIT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with a swelling homeless population and widely scattered services, North 
County's elected leaders took a first step Thursday toward coordinating efforts 
to provide housing and care. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor John MacDonald called a "summit" in Vista, at which 
frustrated service providers decried the area's limited resources to an 
audience of elected representatives from Oceanside, Vista, Carlsbad, Encinitas 
and Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
Although homeless estimates vary radically, MacDonald's office believes 14,000 
farm workers alone are without shelter in North County. Yet there are only 10 
beds for homeless married couples and six beds for adrift minors in the area. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a widespread perception that homelessness is confined to urban 
areas. MacDonald said the stereotype of North County residents is, "they're 
white, affluent, they don't have any needs." 
</P>
<P>
MacDonald said he will soon invite the mayors of North County cities to meet 
with him to evaluate the homeless problem and begin crafting a plan for 
improving and coordinating services. RAY TESSLER

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN CHARGED IN RACIAL ATTACK ON 5 CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Anglo youth was charged Thursday with civil rights violations and battery 
for shouting racial epithets and hurling cans and food at a group of five black 
schoolchildren at a Westchester bus stop. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Leck, 18, was charged with five misdemeanor counts of interfering with 
civil rights and three misdemeanor counts of battery. He was also charged with 
violating his probation from two previous criminal convictions. 
</P>
<P>
"Bigotry is always ugly, but terrorizing children on their way home from school 
is particularly grotesque," said City Atty. James K. Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
Leck is scheduled to be arraigned in Municipal Court Nov. 27. Each civil rights 
count is punishable by up to six months in jail and a $5,000 fine. The battery 
counts are punishable by up to six months in jail and a $2,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said that Leck, a passenger in a car, yelled obscenities and racial slurs 
and threw soft-drink cans and slices of stale pizza at the children, ages 9 to 
12, as they waited for an RTD bus Sept. 28 in Westchester. None of the children 
-- three girls and two boys -- was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Police later found the car used in the attack. The driver, 17, identified Leck 
as his passenger and was referred to county juvenile authorities for possible 
prosecution. Leck was on probation for providing alcohol to a minor and for 
auto theft.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CLEANUP OF PCH LANES COMPLETED AFTER SLIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Caltrans completed its cleanup Thursday of the stretch of Pacific Coast Highway 
that a landside closed on Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Two northbound lanes in Pacific Palisades were closed for minor cleaning and 
restriping early Thursday, but were reopened shortly afterward, said Caltrans 
spokeswoman Margie Tiritilli. 
</P>
<P>
Although geologists initially speculated that a 20-yard-long section of the 
side of the bluff would have to be removed, Tiritilli said Caltrans has no 
plans to work on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"If we didn't feel that it was safe we wouldn't have our work crews there and 
we wouldn't open it up for drivers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a sheet of rocks and earth swept down a cliff behind the 15000 
block of Corona del Mar and onto the freeway. Two motorists suffered minor 
injuries.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FATHER, GIRLFRIEND CHARGED IN ABUSE OF 
DAUGHTER, 3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A father and his live-in girlfriend have been charged with seven counts each of 
felony child abuse for allegedly beating and hog-tying the man's 3-year-old 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Venus Berthomieux and Martha Germany, both 30, face up to six years in prison 
on each charge if convicted, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Ralph Plummer. 
</P>
<P>
Berthomieux pleaded not guilty to all counts Wednesday in Los Angeles Municipal 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
The two were arrested Oct. 14 after calling paramedics to report that the girl 
had accidentally swallowed rubbing alcohol at their home in South-Central Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police said they found the child malnourished and badly bruised. 
Police said bruises on the child indicted that she had been tied up. 
</P>
<P>
An emergency room doctor called it one of the worst cases of child abuse he had 
ever seen, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl has been placed in a foster home.

</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATION: RESTAURANT SPLASH IN MALIBU, A TARGET OF POLICE, IS ON LOSING 
END OF LIQUOR PERMIT FINDING. 
</P>

<P>
Splash, the tony Malibu restaurant that Los Angeles police investigators 
charged was an organized-crime front, should have its liquor license revoked 
because of a cover-up of its true ownership, according to a proposed decision 
by an administrative law judge. 
</P>
<P>
"It is still not clear just who owns how much of the business," Administrative 
Law Judge W.F. Byrnes said in a three-page proposed ruling, dated Oct. 12 and 
made public Thursday by the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. 
"The only thing that is certain is that the true ownership is not as it has 
been reported to the (ABC)." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of a September hearing, Byrnes proposed that Splash's liquor 
license be revoked, but that the revocation be stayed for six months to give 
the restaurant's management time to sell the license to someone "acceptable" to 
the ABC. 
</P>
<P>
Such action usually means the sale of the restaurant too, said David B. 
Wainstein, an ABC attorney who prosecuted Splash. Historically, he said, 
revocation of a liquor license translates into a big business loss. The license 
alone has a value in excess of $30,000, he added. 
</P>
<P>
But the ABC may not be satisfied with Byrnes' proposal. 
</P>
<P>
ABC Deputy Director Manuel Espinoza said the agency may reject the decision and 
instead call for immediate revocation of Splash's liquor license when it 
reviews the case later this year. 
</P>
<P>
"It was our understanding that the evidence was far more than sufficient to 
warrant outright revocation," Espinoza said in a telephone interview from 
Sacramento. "We want to see if the judge's decision is consistent with the 
evidence." 
</P>
<P>
Immediate revocation of the license would reduce the restaurant's market value 
and could prevent the current owners from realizing a substantial profit from 
any future sale, ABC attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
Ronnie Lorenzo, 43, of Malibu, who has said that he owns the restaurant, has 40 
days to appeal the decision. The restaurant can continue serving liquor during 
the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Splash's attorney, Rick A. Blake, did not return a reporter's telephone calls. 
Lorenzo said he would appeal any adverse ABC decision. 
</P>
<P>
The ABC inquiry into Splash, a restaurant frequented by film and television 
celebrities, was connected with a federal and local investigation into Barry 
Minkow, the San Fernando Valley whiz kid whose ZZZZ Best carpet-cleaning 
company made him a millionaire and a darling of Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates charged at a July 7, 1987, news 
conference that organized-crime investigators had uncovered a massive network 
of narcotics trafficking and money laundering involving Minkow and others. 
</P>
<P>
Gates called Splash one of the "fronts for laundering large organized-crime 
profits from narcotic trafficking." 
</P>
<P>
He also named Minkow and Lorenzo as "persons involved in the conspiracy." 
</P>
<P>
Minkow was convicted in federal court last December on 57 fraud counts for 
masterminding a complex securities swindle involving ZZZZ Best. Lorenzo has not 
been accused of any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
The ABC alleged that Splash's real owners were Maurice Rind, 50, of Tarzana and 
Richard Schulman, 55, of Encino. Gates accused them of using Splash as a 
money-laundering conduit through their company, Richman Financial Services. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo said Thursday that he could not understand how the ABC could say he was 
not Splash's owner. 
</P>
<P>
"I was approved by the ABC from Day 1," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Byrnes, the administrative law judge, said in his proposed decision that "it 
was not established" by the ABC that Rind and Schulman secretly controlled 
Splash. 
</P>
<P>
Rind and Schulman, according to the ABC complaint and FBI records, had criminal 
convictions -- Rind for stock fraud, Schulman for a number of felonies.

FIREFIGHTER SAYS HE LOST JOB FOR REPORTS TO COUNCILWOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Hawthorne firefighter who claims that he was demoted in retaliation for 
political activities told the city's Civil Service Commission a tale of 
intrigue that involved his secretly passing Fire Department information to 
Councilwoman Ginny M. Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony came at a Civil Service hearing Wednesday. Dennis Patriquin, a 
firefighter for 16 years, has charged that he was demoted from probationary 
engineer to firefighter because he gave Lambert potentially embarrassing 
information, including information from documents about overtime pay and 
departmental expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
Lambert wanted the information to help persuade the City Council to authorize a 
study of whether the county could provide fire services more cheaply than the 
city Fire Department, according to testimony from Patriquin and Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
Last year Patriquin filed a suit in Torrance Superior Court against the city 
and top Fire Department officials, including Chief Roger Milstead, alleging 
that he was demoted for his political activities. 
</P>
<P>
A court commissioner said the suit did not belong in court because Patriquin 
had not exhausted efforts to resolve the matter through the Civil Service 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Patriquin's attorney, Robert H. Swensen, is asking that Patriquin be reinstated 
as a fire engineer and awarded an unspecified amount of back pay. He said 
Wednesday that the firefighter was demoted for exercising his First Amendment 
right to freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
The city says he failed a one-year probationary period as an engineer because 
he was emotionally unsuited for the job and had a disruptive personality. 
</P>
<P>
During questioning by Richard Terzian, an attorney representing the city, 
Patriquin acknowledged that briefly in the fall of 1987 he was suicidal. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview later, Swensen said Patriquin was upset because of overwhelming 
pressure and harassment from his superiors, who didn't want the county taking 
over the city's fire services. 
</P>
<P>
Swenson said the city's demotion of Patriquin under those circumstances is 
similar to "shoot(ing) someone and then claim(ing) that the person can't do the 
job because he is injured." 
</P>
<P>
During the proceedings, Lambert testified that she sought the information from 
Patriquin because she thought the city would save money by having the county 
provide fire services. She said she went to Patriquin because she felt that 
then-Chief Ralph Hardin was reluctant to provide information that could have 
been led to the dismantling of the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, there was a citywide debate about the most cost-effective way to 
provide fire and paramedic services. The council voted 3 to 2 in December, 
1988, against conducting the study. 
</P>
<P>
During questioning from Terzian on Wednesday, Patriquin said he gave Lambert 
the information because he also felt that the city could save money by having 
the county run fire services in Hawthorne. But he said his superior officers 
opposed the idea, so he passed the information to Lambert secretly. 
</P>
<P>
One of his clandestine transfers ended on an embarrassing note, according to 
testimony from Tom Worldy, a longtime friend of Patriquin. 
</P>
<P>
Worldy said he got his arm stuck in the mail slot at Lambert's house when he 
tried to deliver a package of information from Patriquin, who was hiding in 
Worldy's truck at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"How far was your arm stuck?" asked Terzian. 
</P>
<P>
"Up to here," Worldy said, pointing to his forearm. 
</P>
<P>
"But you got it out, right?" asked Terzian. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I was able to retrieve it," Worldy responded with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing, which has gone through two sessions, is expected to end at the end 
of this month. The next session is Thursday.

CAUSE OF SHIP'S SINKING IS STILL A MYSTERY TO BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly two weeks after the former cruise ship Princess Louise sank without 
warning at a shipyard dock, the bank that owns the once-popular floating 
restaurant is still trying to figure out if the vessel will be saved or 
scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Oak, president of the Bank of San Pedro, said Thursday that the bank is 
interviewing several salvage companies for the job -- and that the first bidder 
offered some advice he didn't like. 
</P>
<P>
"Their recommendation was to cut it up into pieces," Oak said. "We weren't real 
happy with that." 
</P>
<P>
Oak said the bank, which had insured the vessel for $1.5 million, would prefer 
to raise it intact. But officials at the shipyard, Southwest Marine of San 
Pedro, said the 360-foot vessel -- which is half-submerged in 24 feet of water 
-- may now be too heavy to lift in one piece. 
</P>
<P>
The 67-year-old ship, appointed with once-elegant mahogany woodwork and floral 
carpet, went down suddenly Oct. 30 as stunned viewers watched from other ships. 
No one was injured, although a security guard who had been on board the ship 
jumped to safety just before it capsized. 
</P>
<P>
The ship is resting on its starboard side on the bottom of the slip where it 
capsized. Divers and marine surveyors have examined it, but Oak said they have 
not determined what caused it to sink. 
</P>
<P>
"They're thinking whatever the cause is, it's on the side that's on the bottom, 
and they can't see the side that's on the bottom. It's in the mud." 
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses, the ship began to list severely shortly before it went 
down at 12:30 p.m. The guard who had been on board reported hearing a loud 
noise -- one marine surveyor said it could have been a door bursting open from 
the force of the water or tables and chairs careening to one side -- as the 
beleaguered vessel sank. 
</P>
<P>
The former Canadian ocean liner -- once known as "Queen of the Northern Seas" 
-- had been berthed at Los Angeles Harbor for two decades. In its better days, 
it played host to countless weddings, bar mitzvahs and high school proms. 
</P>
<P>
But the popular floating restaurant ran into hard times last year. Owner Marion 
Perkov declared bankruptcy in April, 1988, and in January the Los Angeles 
Harbor Department forced the ship from its berth under the Vincent Thomas 
Bridge to make way for a new dinner cruise vessel, the Spirit of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The bank has been trying to sell the ship since then. About a month and a half 
ago, the Princess Louise was moved from Todd Shipyards -- where it had been 
tied up since January -- to Southwest Marine for hull repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Mike McKeown, industrial engineering manager at Southwest Marine, said most of 
the work on the ship had been completed when it sank.

U.S. PROBES ROCKWELL'S SHIPPING OF 'HOT' MATERIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Transportation is investigating whether Rockwell 
International's Santa Susana Field Laboratory violated federal safety 
regulations by shipping equipment that emitted excessive radioactivity. 
</P>
<P>
The truckload of contaminated equipment crashed into a bridge in eastern 
Pennsylvania before dawn on Oct. 24. None of the metal boxes of equipment 
ruptured, but measurements taken after of the crash showed excessive radiation 
at the surface of one container and on the underside of the truck. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Bonekemper, a senior government attorney in Washington, said the case "is 
being actively pursued" to see if Rockwell or others involved with the shipment 
should be charged with safety violations, which are punishable by civil 
penalties of up to $10,000 per violation. Bonekemper said it might take two or 
three months to complete the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell officials have repeatedly declined to discuss the incident. But in a 
brief report to the Department of Energy, for which Rockwell does nuclear work, 
the company admitted that it failed to follow its own rules in packaging the 
shipment. 
</P>
<P>
"Proper compliance with procedural requirements would have prevented shipment 
of a non-complying package," Rockwell said in the Oct. 31 document, known as an 
"unusual occurrence report." 
</P>
<P>
The cargo included contaminated fuel baskets, which are metal devices placed 
inside steel shipping casks to keep nuclear fuel rods from bouncing around. 
</P>
<P>
The fuel baskets apparently had been used years ago to bring spent fuel to the 
Santa Susana lab west of Chatsworth, where Rockwell did fuel decladding work 
for the Department of Energy until 1986. That work involved breaking open fuel 
rods and removing radioactive uranium and plutonium for shipment to government 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Vaeth, acting deputy manager of the Energy Department's San Francisco 
office, said he believed that Rockwell was returning the baskets to their 
owners as part of its cleanup work at Santa Susana. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the baskets were owned by Nuclear Assurance Corp., a Georgia firm that 
supplies baskets and shipping casks to the nuclear industry. But Vaeth said one 
basket belonged to the Department of Energy. 
</P>
<P>
The truck, owned by McGil Specialized Carriers, first hauled the government's 
basket to the Savannah River plant in South Carolina, part of the government's 
atomic weapons complex. The Nuclear Assurance baskets were then driven to 
Alaron Corp. in Wampum, Pa., which stores and refurbishes contaminated 
equipment for firms such as Nuclear Assurance. 
</P>
<P>
The driver apparently got lost on a country road a few miles from the Alaron 
plant. He tried to drive through an underpass that was too low for the trailer, 
which lost about 10 feet of its roof in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
The driver and a passenger were not injured. The truck was driven to the Alaron 
plant under escort by Pennsylvania state police and emergency response teams. 
</P>
<P>
Measurements by Alaron and state officials showed a radiation level of 250 
millirem per hour on the underside of the truck -- higher than the 200-millirem 
limit set by the government. One box was emitting up to 2,500 millirem per 
hour, well above the limit of 1,000 millirem per hour. 
</P>
<P>
A person sitting on the box for an hour would have received a radiation dose 
equivalent to about 50 chest X-rays. However, the levels were too low to pose a 
hazard in areas through which the truck passed. 
</P>
<P>
In its report to the Department of Energy, Rockwell said it failed to put lead 
shielding in the most radioactive box, which would have lowered surface 
radiation to permissible levels. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell said it decided to compensate by putting lead shielding on the floor 
of the trailer. The company said it believed that the excessive radiation 
reading beneath the truck resulted from the boxes' sliding off the shielding 
from the impact of the crash.

THERE STAYS THE NEIGHBORHOOD: HOUSING DEVELOPMENT REJECTED; 
</P>
<P>
SEPULVEDA: ADMITTING THAT THEY MADE A MISTAKE, PLANNERS DECIDE TO PRESERVE A 
RUSTIC REFUGE AMID URBAN SPRAWL.

City planning officials, saying they made a mistake three years ago, Thursday 
rejected a proposed housing project and took the first step toward preventing 
future development in a Sepulveda neighborhood where residents raise horses and 
other livestock. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Planning Commission voted unanimously to turn down a proposal 
by developer Jeffrey Kamen of Sherman Oaks, who wanted to replace one home on a 
1.47-acre lot in the 9600 block of Lemona Avenue with 10 new houses. 
</P>
<P>
In rejecting Kamen's proposal, the commission backed away from a plan it had 
approved in 1986 that would have allowed developers to build more housing in a 
quarter-square-mile area bounded by Lassen Street on the north, Plummer Street 
on the south, Columbus Avenue on the west and Lemona Avenue on the east. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners ordered city planners to hold public hearings on limiting 
residential development in the neighborhood to about one unit per half acre -- 
the area's original zoning designation before the 1986 plan allowing denser 
development was approved. 
</P>
<P>
"We just clearly made a mistake" in approving a plan that allowed more houses, 
Commissioner Theodore Stein Jr. said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 Mission Hills-Panorama City-Sepulveda District Plan called for "low to 
medium" housing development in the area but did not establish specific 
densities, said Bob Rogers, the commission's chief hearing examiner. It was 
approved based on the erroneous assumption that the neighborhood was run-down 
and needed development, he said. In fact, the area's semirural character is an 
improvement on the urbanized neighborhoods near Sepulveda Boulevard, which is 
notorious for drug activity, crime and prostitution, Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
"We constantly face the dilemma of trying to create more housing, but this is a 
good example of the kind of a neighborhood we want to retain," said 
Commissioner Fernando Torres-Gil. 
</P>
<P>
Kamen, who had sought approval for a specific zoning designation allowing for 
the 10 homes, said he was disappointed by the commission's decision but "we're 
a large developer, and we wanted to test the water. We'll just move on." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, the 170 property owners in the area were unaware the city held 
public hearings on the issue, even though notices were published in newspapers, 
Rogers said. The plan dealt with an 11-square-mile area, and "we don't have the 
money to notify everybody by mail," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents made known their wishes Thursday. Dozens testified and more than 50 
others sent letters urging rejection of Kamen's proposal and adoption of the 
lower density zoning. Arline DeSanctis, a deputy for Councilman Joel Wachs, 
supported them. 
</P>
<P>
"I have chickens, geese, turkeys and birds," said longtime resident Beryl Moss, 
vice president of the Bird Assn. of California. "It's a wonderful place for 
birds like the white-throated hummingbird, and the wild parrots in the area 
depend on the fruit trees. They're already impacted by the row after row of 
townhouses south of Plummer." 
</P>
<P>
Norm Gottlieb, president of the Sepulveda homeowners group, said victorious 
residents planned a party to celebrate Thursday night. 
</P>

<P>
Photo, Beryl Moss, longtime resident of a semirural Sepulveda area, calls it "a 
wonderful place for birds," which she raises and which thrive in the wild 
there. She and other rezoning opponents, like Bob Sullivan, got their way when 
the Planning Commission rejected a 10-unit housing project and put restrictions 
on development. The area will remain a place to raise horses and grow fruit 
trees like Norm Gottlieb's. LAWRENCE K. HO / Los Angeles Times; GEORGE WILHELM

5 BAY CITIES SEEK SHARE OF PORT'S WEALTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of mayors representing the five cities bordering San Diego Bay 
announced Thursday that they will seek changes in state law to allow them to 
use the San Diego Unified Port District's budget surplus for "public safety 
services," such as police protection. 
</P>
<P>
Calling it another "landmark event" in her city, San Diego Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor said the proposal represents the first time that all five mayors of 
the bayside cities -- San Diego, National City, Chula Vista, Imperial Beach and 
Coronado -- have joined to change legislation that created the Port District in 
1962. 
</P>
<P>
All five mayors, along with state Sen. Wadie P. Deddeh (D-Bonita) and 
Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas), presented their proposal at a 
joint news conference led by O'Connor at San Diego City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The mayors, all of whom said their cities need money to bolster police 
services, said residents voted to create the Port District and that it is only 
fair that they share in the agency's financial success. 
</P>
<P>
By any measure, the Port District has found that. As custodian of state 
tidelands around the bay, it has seen its projects, from Lindbergh Field and 
Seaport Village to Shelter and Harbor islands, turn into moneymakers. 
</P>
<P>
This horn of plenty has developed while the cities the port represents have 
found it increasingly hard to provide services while coping with 
revenue-spending limits imposed by the state. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Port District is expecting about $89 million in revenue this 
fiscal year. Most cities in the country would have to rely on bonds to pay for 
the $160-million convention center nearing completion on the bayfront. But the 
Port District is simply writing a check. 
</P>
<P>
What the cities want a piece of is the agency's ongoing surplus, which 
currently stands at about $78 million. 
</P>
<P>
Although a formula for how the money would be shared has yet to be worked out, 
O'Connor said she foresees the cities getting as much as 40% of the surplus. As 
now envisioned, the legislation would provide for the cities to receive a 
minimum payment from the surplus every year, plus another payment based on 
population. 
</P>
<P>
As to whether the seven port commissioners would support the change, the mayors 
noted that the members are appointed by the city councils of the cities, and 
that their support shouldn't be hard to win. 
</P>
<P>
The Port District's administration, led by longtime executive Don Nay, declined 
to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista Mayor Greg Cox said that, aside from providing money to the five 
cities for public safety, the proposal accomplishes two other goals: keeping 
the port operating as a separate entity and providing Imperial Beach with money 
it desperately needs to stay afloat.

L.A. PLANNERS OK 3-STORY BUILDINGS IN N. HOLLYWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: LEADERS IN NORTH HOLLYWOOD'S VALLEY VILLAGE WILL SEEK CITY COUNCIL 
HELP IN THEIR FIGHT AGAINST "STUCCO MOUNTAINS." 
</P>

<P>
Citing the desperate need for housing in Los Angeles, the Planning Commission 
on Thursday approved construction of three-story apartment buildings beside 
single-family houses in the Valley Village area of North Hollywood, enraging 
many residents. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Valley Village, a quiet enclave in the southern portion of North 
Hollywood, began fighting four years ago to keep tall apartment buildings, 
known to opponents as "stucco mountains," from overshadowing their expensive 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
Community leaders said they are confident that the City Council will overturn 
the commission's unanimous vote and approve a two-story height limit 
recommended by a citizens advisory committee, which met for nearly two years to 
draw up a land-use plan for the area. 
</P>
<P>
The council will vote on the plan after the Planning and Land Use Management 
Committee holds a public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The plan covers a 1 1/2-square-mile area bounded by the Hollywood Freeway on 
the east, the Tujunga Wash next to Coldwater Canyon Avenue on the west, the 
Ventura Freeway on the south and Burbank Boulevard on the north. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Joel Wachs, Zev Yaroslavsky and John Ferraro, who represent the 
area, are sympathetic to residents' concerns about lack of privacy and support 
the lower height limit, according to their deputies. 
</P>
<P>
But developers and others may lobby council members in coming months to accept 
the three-story restriction approved by the commission. At Thursday's 
commission meeting, land use consultant Howard S. Raphael of North Hollywood 
called the two-story limit punitive. And Fred Russell, a retired movie 
technician who owns a small apartment house on Whitsett Avenue, said lower 
height limits would be overkill. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, building in the area is restricted by a temporary ordinance. 
The moratorium, approved in November, 1986, expires later this year, but the 
City Council can extend it for one year. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance restricts development in several ways, limiting all new buildings 
to two stories and holding the square footage of commercial developments to 1 
1/2 times the size of the lot. Building apartments and condominiums on property 
zoned for commercial use is prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
In approving the three-story limit, the commission required developers to 
provide five feet more space between their projects and adjoining residential 
properties than is ordinarily required. The actual distance between the 
buildings and houses depends on the size of the apartment buildings. 
Commissioners said the additional space would help offset the impact of the 
three-story buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"The commission action is meant to maintain the balance between the time 
residents put in on this and the citywide concern over the need for housing," 
said William G. Luddy, commission president. "I'm afraid the need for housing 
is a nasty problem, and there's no clean and easy solution." 
</P>
<P>
But Kurt Hunter, president of the North Hollywood Residents Assn., said the 
three-story height limit would encourage developers to knock down older 
buildings and displace residents who pay monthly rents of $400 to $700. 
</P>
<P>
"What good does it do to have older buildings replaced by high-rent ones that 
cost $800 to $1,400 a month? " said Hunter, who was a member of the citizens 
advisory committee. "We sat night after night to come up with a plan, and what 
good did it do if the Planning Commission and the city staff don't listen?" 
</P>
<P>
City planners, who recommended taller height limits than residents wanted, said 
their job is to strike a balance between all the interests involved.

MOTHER, INFANT INJURED IN ATTACK ON PACOIMA STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man apparently under the influence of drugs went berserk on a Pacoima street 
Thursday, striking a woman on the head with a brick and injuring her 1-year-old 
daughter before police subdued him, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Raynaldo Mendibles, 31, who lives in the 13600 block of Daventry Street where 
the attack occurred shortly after 3 p.m., was arrested and treated at Holy 
Cross Medical Center for head injuries after police struck him with batons when 
he lunged at them with the brick, Sgt. Robert Ontiveros said. 
</P>
<P>
Two women also struck Mendibles with a broomstick and a vacuum bottle in an 
effort to subdue him, Ontiveros said. The man was beating himself on the head 
with the brick when police arrived, Ontiveros said. 
</P>
<P>
Mendibles, who was listed in stable condition, was later transferred to the Los 
Angeles County-USC Medical Center jail ward, a nursing supervisor at Holy Cross 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Marguerita Valdez, 29, a neighbor of Mendibles, suffered a fractured skull and 
was being treated at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Panorama City, Ontiveros 
said. Her daughter, Natalie, was being treated at the same hospital for 
unspecified injuries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Their conditions were not immediately available, but they were considered well 
enough to be transferred to Kaiser from another hospital, authorities said. It 
was not known if Mendibles struck the baby with the brick or if the girl was 
injured when her mother dropped her during the attack. 
</P>
<P>
A man who saw Valdez lying wounded on the sidewalk angrily approached 
Mendibles, asking "What did that guy do to my wife?" But police persuaded him 
to back off, a witness said.

daughter. The woman, whose skull was fractured with a brick, and her daughter 
were hospitalized. CARLOS CHAVEZ / Los Angeles Times

JURY BELIEVES TORTURE TALE, ACQUITS RADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Vista Superior Court jury Thursday acquitted Alberta (Ann) Rader of all 
charges in the killing of her husband of less than a year, saying afterward 
that they believed her story that she acted in self-defense after being 
subjected to a night of torture at the hands of her fourth husband. 
</P>
<P>
Rader, 51, cried, hugged her attorney and pronounced, "There is a God," after 
the clerk read "Not guilty" to each of the charges the jury considered: 
first-degree murder, second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter and 
involuntary manslaughter. Her family, sitting in the first row of Judge Richard 
Murphy's courtroom, gasped in relief. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'll be stronger than ever," Rader, a real estate agent, said as she 
left the courthouse. "I've made Vista my home, and now I love it more than 
ever." 
</P>
<P>
Jurors said that Deputy Dist. Atty. Walt Donovan failed to prove his allegation 
that Rader fabricated a scene of torture and then deliberately killed her 
husband, Thomas, because she was angry that he was going to drop her and 
because she wanted to collect about $350,000 in life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"We truly believed Ann Rader was terrified to the point where she had to defend 
herself," jury foreman Kevin Verduyn said. 
</P>
<P>
Juror Donald L. Krout Jr. said, "There wasn't enough evidence to lean any other 
way." He said that Rader would have to have "an awfully creative mind" to have 
staged the scene of the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Rader testified in her own behalf during the three-week trial, saying that her 
husband, angry after she told him she was going to leave him, held her in 
bondage in bed, raping her, putting a gun in her mouth and cutting her stomach 
and neck with the point of scissors. When he fell asleep, she said, she reached 
for the handgun resting between them and shot him three times in the left side 
of his head. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution alleged that Rader shot her husband once in the head while he 
was asleep, hoping it would appear to be a suicide, then shot him twice more 
after the first shot didn't kill him. Afterward, she self-inflicted the cuts, 
Donovan charged, and contrived the story of torture. 
</P>
<P>
Donovan said he would not second-guess his case and said the jurors "didn't 
clearly see through the extraordinarily complex evidence." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added: "They made a thoughtful decision. The jury system was in 
operation. They believed her. What can I say?" 
</P>
<P>
The jury deliberated for nearly three days.

LA JOLLA LAWYER'S KILLER PLEADS GUILTY TO VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER, GOES FREE; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: A 1982 SECOND-DEGREE MURDER CONVICTION WAS OVERTURNED BASED ON 
MISCONDUCT BY THE COUNTY PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Herman Martin, whose 1982 second-degree murder conviction was overturned 
because of San Diego County prosecutors' misconduct, has pleaded guilty to 
voluntary manslaughter in the killing of a La Jolla attorney. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the 68-year-old Martin's plea, the California attorney 
general's office agreed that the Solana Beach insurance executive will receive 
credit for the four-plus years already spent in prison from 1982 to 1987 and 
serve no more time. 
</P>
<P>
The plea bargain, announced Wednesday in San Diego Superior Court, ended the 
case's lengthy and complicated history and avoided the retrial the California 
Supreme Court ordered in 1987 after finding that Martin's first trial was 
tainted by San Diego County prosecutors' misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
That ruling was based on the 1986 findings of a special judicial referee -- 
findings that so enraged Dist. Atty. Edwin L. Miller that a San Diego judge 
later ordered his office off the case because Miller had "lost his 
perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers in the attorney general's office, which took over the case after a 
state appeal court backed up the order by San Diego Superior Court Judge J. 
Perry Langford dismissing local prosecutors, expressed satisfaction Thursday 
with the deal. So did Martin's current attorney, Robert Grimes. 
</P>
<P>
But the district attorney's office said it was a bad bargain. 
</P>
<P>
"We disagree with the disposition in the case," spokesman Steven J. Casey said. 
"The district attorney believes that the case should have gone back to trial. 
</P>
<P>
"But, it was in the attorney general's hands and they are good and capable and 
skilled people," Casey said. "They made a different assessment, and so be it." 
</P>
<P>
Martin was charged with arranging the 1981 killing of La Jolla attorney Richard 
Crake. He was convicted in March, 1982, of second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
But Martin won a new trial in November 1987 when the state Supreme Court found 
"serious misconduct" by San Diego County prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
That 1987 decision upheld the findings of a special referee, appointed by the 
high court to investigate the case. Retired appellate justice Gerald A. Brown 
concluded in a 1986 report that misconduct by a prosecutor in Miller's office 
and perjury by the key witness resulted in Martin's wrongful conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's findings had so angered Miller that he issued press releases and made 
strong public statements criticizing the report. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said in a 1986 interview that Brown's analysis of the case had been a 
"rather naive, gullible approach." Shortly after the 1987 Supreme Court ruling, 
Miller called Brown's report "just bunk." 
</P>
<P>
Martin's appeals attorney, Charles M. Sevilla, then charged that Miller was so 
biased against Martin that Martin could not receive a fair trial if the San 
Diego district attorney's office was involved. Sevilla said Martin was trying 
to "vindicate" the honor of his office by proving Brown wrong and winning 
Martin's conviction a second time. 
</P>
<P>
In June of this year, the 4th District Court of Appeal in San Diego agreed, 
saying in a decision issued that the "district attorney's involvement in the 
Martin case" had moved from "purely impartial 'professional' concerns to undue 
'personal' concerns based on a desire to prove the referee's findings wrong." 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 11, the state Supreme Court let that decision stand without comment. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plea bargain, the attorney general's office agreed to drop three 
additional counts against Martin -- assault, conspiracy to commit extortion and 
conspiracy to commit assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Under the sentencing rules for manslaughter in 1981, Martin could have been 
sentenced to two, four or six years in prison, Deputy Atty. Gen. Louis Hanoian 
said. Because the attorney general's office would have recommended a four-year 
sentence and Martin already had served nearly five years, the office agreed to 
no further jail time, Hanoian said. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the circumstances, we think that's a proper disposition," Hanoian said. 
"The evidence in our view over the years isn't as strong as the initial time 
when the case was tried." 
</P>
<P>
The deal was attractive to Martin because, in recent months, his wife had died 
and he had been through heart surgery, Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
"Herman isn't in a position to fight it any more," Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
Formal sentencing was set for Jan. 10.

WEEKENDER: PENINSULA ARTISTS OFFER EXHIBITION-GOERS 72 WAYS TO LOOK AT 
CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gerald Faris 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For some, it's the use of vivid colors. 
</P>
<P>
For others, it's the subjects: turn-of-the-century ladies in white dresses in 
San Diego's Balboa Park, fishermen, two boys marveling over a sand crab, the 
dull gray siding of old wooden buildings. 
</P>
<P>
For one person, it's a rough, round, mottled ceramic aptly named "Palos Verdes 
Boulder." That's what it looks like. 
</P>
<P>
These are ways some South Bay artists capture the look and spirit of 
California, and they are among the visions of the state in "The California 
Experience" as seen in painting, sculpture, ceramics, assemblage and weaving. 
</P>
<P>
The free exhibition of 72 works by more than 40 artists is on view through Nov. 
22 in the gallery of the Joslyn Center of the Arts, run by the Torrance Parks 
and Recreation Department. The artists in the show will be honored at a public 
reception tonight, where awards will be given for outstanding works. 
</P>
<P>
The artists are members of Peninsula VI, a conglomeration of six artists groups 
affiliated with the Palos Verdes Art Center on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. The 
artists present group shows in libraries, cultural centers and art galleries. 
Some give classes at the center. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Napolitan, a Palos Verdes Estates artist, describes the Peninsula VI groups 
as a combination of social clubs and support groups for artists. 
</P>
<P>
"Artists tend to feed off of each other and to share," she said. "We have 
people present and discuss what they are doing and have critiques. Plus, it's 
wonderful just to be with a group of artists, a bunch of creative minds. It's 
very special." 
</P>
<P>
The show -- the first Peninsula VI has presented at the Joslyn -- was drawn 
from a competition among about 150 works by member artists. Morris Shubin, a 
watercolorist and teacher, served as the juror to decide what should be put on 
view. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to select a variety of work for the show, so we didn't get all one 
thing, all objective or all abstract, but a balanced show," said Shubin, who 
juries art shows across the country. 
</P>
<P>
When selecting works for a show, Shubin concentrates on the excellence of an 
artist's technique rather than the subject of a piece. "I'm looking for 
skillful work . . . how the artists carry out what they want to do." 
</P>
<P>
Joslyn gallery curator Barbara Johnson said the panel that decides on the 12 
shows to present in the Joslyn gallery each year was impressed by the strength 
of the Peninsula VI work. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes with groups, you get a portion of the works that aren't so good, and 
a few good ones carry the weight of the whole," she said. "In this case, all of 
the works submitted were good. It was good, quality work." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said the graphic use of color is one of the strongest elements of the 
show. "One work is of a woman sunbathing, with an exquisite sunset falling over 
her breast," she said. "There's a huge red-blue bow in her hair, a unique 
composition." 
</P>
<P>
Other works, she said, use color overlays that create "a luminescent quality, 
as if you're looking through water." And she said that some of the most unusual 
works in the show are ceramics where leaves were placed against the pots in the 
kiln. "They gave them a sheen that was not controlled by the artist," she said. 
"The artist lets the artwork take its own shape in natural forms." 
</P>
<P>
One of Napolitan's contributions to the show is a ceramic called "Horizon," 
which is a low, round bowl with a copper-cable handle. She said it emulates 
what she sees when she looks at the horizon. "The piece is a study in curves, 
which is what I find when I look out," Napolitan said. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance artist Evelyn Sexton said she created her oil painting, "California 
Dream," especially for the Joslyn show. Said Sexton, "I thought people sitting 
in a park by the ocean, with boats and a sunset, that's California." 
</P>
<P>
What: "The California Experience" artists reception. 
</P>
<P>
When: Friday, 7 to 9 p.m.; exhibit open Monday-Friday, 9 a.m.-9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Where: Joslyn Center of the Arts Gallery, 3335 Civic Center Drive, Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Admission: Free.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL OKS SWITCH AT RADISSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Manhattan Beach City Council has unanimously approved a plan that will 
allow a new company to take over management of the Radisson Plaza Hotel &amp; 
Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
The council's vote Tuesday, which was necessary because the city holds the 
ground lease on the hotel property, clears the way for Kentucky Hospitality 
Employer Inc. to sublease the business from Horst Osterkamp and his company, US 
Hotel Properties. 
</P>
<P>
In October, Osterkamp was ordered by a judge to pay restitution of $175,000 
after pleading no contest to charges that he deducted thousands of dollars in 
taxes from employees' paychecks but failed to pass the money on to the state. 
He has made partial restitution and has until April 23, 1990, to pay the 
remainder. Earlier, Osterkamp pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge that 
he failed to pay an 8 1/2% bed tax to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Shearson California Radisson Plaza Partners, which is headed by the investment 
firm Shearson Lehman Hutton, had sought city permission for the management 
change. Shearson bought the hotel from US Hotel Properties in 1987, and then 
leased it to Osterkamp to manage.

REDLINING BY AUTO INSURERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I attended college in Philadelphia, I had to commute between two schools 
twice weekly and wanted to purchase a car. I soon learned, however, that 
Philadelphia is one of the highest cost cities in the country for auto 
insurance and that the ZIP code in which I was located was the highest cost in 
the city. I could not afford the premiums and was forced to forgo an 
automobile. 
</P>
<P>
The area in which I was located is predominantly black, and the effects of 
territorial rating were very obvious. I, therefore, concur wholly with Mark 
Ridley-Thomas and Mary Lee in their criticism of this practice. I must, 
however, point out that this is only one inequity in the system, and it is not 
nearly as blatant as others. 
</P>
<P>
If rates are to be based on one's driving record, number of miles driven 
annually, and years of driving experience, there is something very wrong with 
the system. For instance, as a male I statistically have a better chance of 
having an accident than a female and am charged more based on this fact alone. 
Also, statistically, as a single person I am more likely to have an accident 
than a married person, so I pay more here, too. In both cases my rates became 
higher before I even drove an automobile for the first time. Worse yet, these 
practices are perfectly legal. 
</P>
<P>
As a white I should not pay less for auto insurance than a black simply because 
of my race. I also should not pay more simply because of my gender and marital 
status. Clearly much room for improvement exists in this industry.

ALCOHOLISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to your editorial ("It's What You Do That Counts," Oct. 31) I 
commend state Sen. Art Torres and Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre 
for their courage in accepting their disease (alcoholism) and doing something 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
Now more than ever they remain my heroes of politics. They will serve as good 
role models for young Chicanos in the barrios and wherever alcohol is 
prevalent. If Chicanos win the war on drugs and alcohol then nothing can stop 
them from achieving success in life.

REDLINING BY AUTO INSURERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The current mess in auto insurance in California has taken years to get into 
and may well take years to get out of -- if ever. I would like to suggest a 
simple and easy way to clear the decks. 
</P>
<P>
1. Let the state establish a state-operated insurance carrier, operated solely 
on insurance premiums with no tax revenue to be used to subsidize it. 
</P>
<P>
2. Abolish all rate regulations on private insurance carriers. They will be 
constrained by competition with each other, and with the state insurance 
carrier to offer fair and competitive rates. 
</P>
<P>
3. Abolish the current requirement that all drivers carry auto insurance. The 
history of this law, both here and elsewhere, is uniformly horrid. 
</P>
<P>
I don't promise that this will make insurance rates affordable (one more reason 
for No. 3), but if it doesn't at least it will then be obvious that the problem 
is with the court system and excessive awards, not the insurance industry.

REMEMBERING ARMISTICE DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month the big guns 
fell silent. It was the armistice of World War I in 1918. Who in my generation 
did not know the story? Who in this generation has heard it? 
</P>
<P>
It was the great world war -- the first time America had joined Europe's wars 
overseas. We were saving the world for democracy. We were fighting the Kaiser 
and the Krauts. Our lads were dying in "no man's land" -- the battle line of 
trenches where huge cannons lined up opposite each other between Germany and 
France. That was the way wars were fought then. Our tanks were there. Our newly 
invented airplanes were dogfighting overhead. In a fervor of patriotism war 
bonds were sold, shortages and rationing were endured, women went to work so 
their men could go. How long? How long could it be? 
</P>
<P>
Then the news came. There was no television, no radio. Telegraph and telephone 
and extras quickly spread the news. A truce had been declared and the big guns 
that never quit firing night and day ceased sounding. On the eleventh hour of 
the eleventh day of the eleventh month there was silence all along the front. 
</P>
<P>
Jubilant celebrations broke out all over America. Bells. People danced in the 
streets of all the small towns as well as in Times Square. Parades were quickly 
formed and the Kaiser was burned in effigy. The celebration when peace came 
after World War II could not match the pure joy of that first cease-fire. There 
was no doubt. Our boys were coming home. The world had been saved. A holiday 
was set to remember this momentous day. 
</P>
<P>
How did the holiday get changed to Veterans Day? We already had Memorial Day. 
Did people forget? Did the Second World War wipe out the memory of the first? 
Or was it that people didn't want to remember the truce -- a time to pause in 
the fighting to make peace. 
</P>
<P>
Let's remember. Let's not let Nov. 11th be a confused, semi-holiday, a sort of 
imitation Memorial Day. Let's sing the old songs -- "There's a Long, Long Trail 
A-Winding," "Smile the While, I Kiss You Sad Adieu," "It's a Long Way to 
Tipperary," "How Can You Keep Them Down on the Farm After They've Seen Paree." 
Let's tell our children how it was. Let's celebrate armistice.

RADAR VIOLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his column ("U.S. Illusions Shattered in Snows of Krasnoyarsk," Op-Ed Page, 
Oct. 30), Frank Gaffney has stooped to outright falsification of the views of 
those with whom he differs. He labels the Arms Control Assn. (ACA), its 
chairman, Ambassador Gerard Smith, and three of its board members, Ambassador 
Paul Warnke, former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, and former National 
Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy, as "discredited apologists" for the Soviet 
Union and suggests that they have denied that the Krasnoyarsk radar is a 
violation of the ABM treaty. This is a total misrepresentation of their 
position. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, in 1984, ACA Chairman Smith, in an article he co-authored with Bundy, 
McNamara and Ambassador George Kennan in Foreign Affairs, called the 
Krasnoyarsk radar "a violation of the express language of the treaty" even 
before the Reagan Administration published this accusation in its February, 
1985, compliance report. This has been the consistent and oft-repeated position 
of Smith, Bundy, and McNamara, as well as that of Ambassador Warnke, myself and 
other ACA board members. It was also the explicit conclusion of ACA's 1987 
analysis of Soviet compliance activities and of our mid-1989 book, "Arms 
Control and National Security." 
</P>
<P>
Gaffney does not enhance the credibility of his arguments by such irresponsible 
attacks on those who would protect the ABM treaty and support a new strategic 
arms agreement.

AVOIDING THE WATER-STEALER IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rural counties in Central and Southern Nevada are starting to fear that what 
happened to the Owens Valley 75 years ago might happen to them. The Los Vegas 
Valley Water District has filed 146 applications with the state engineer for 
unallocated water rights in parts of Clark County and in neighboring Nye, 
Lincoln and White Pine counties. Rights on stream flow and underground aquifers 
total about 865,000 acre-feet of water, a bit more than Los Angeles uses in a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
But Las Vegas is trying to avoid the image of water-stealer that Los Angeles 
has borne over the years. Patricia Mulroy, general manager of the water 
district, said Las Vegas is not seeking exclusive rights and that the growing 
urban center is willing to share the water if the sparsely populated counties 
demonstrated a need for some of it. Las Vegas also would offer a package of 
economic incentives to compensate for the loss. "We don't want to be perceived 
as going in and grabbing the water," Mulroy said. 
</P>
<P>
If the Las Vegas district succeeds in winning the rights, the district would 
spend an estimated $1.5 billion over the next 20 to 30 years developing a water 
collection and delivery system. The Las Vegas area has doubled in population 
during the 1980s, to about 700,000. Officials in the other counties indicated 
they would not allow Las Vegas to get their water without a contest. Nye County 
Manager Frank Hershman said, "We need the water desperately for our own 
development." 
</P>
<P>
The situation may present a chance for both the city and counties to avoid all 
the anger and trauma involved when Los Angeles bought up the Owens Valley for 
its water rights. A cooperative agreement might provide the water development 
rural areas need and cannot afford, while giving the Las Vegas area enough new 
supply to accommodate reasonable growth. With careful planning now, both 
regions might be able to develop the supplies they need. The tactic of fighting 
it out in court might result in losses for everyone.

In response to Robert A. Jones' column "The Rewards of Slow-Motion Locomotion," 
Part A, Oct. 31: 
</P>
<P>
Millions of people hate flying. They're the ones who love trains. Life is 
short. To hell with rushing from city to city in gigantic airplanes with all 
the built-in fear and stress, plus the dreadful purchase of air disaster 
insurance. It's unbelieveable that we can't get more trains. 
</P>
<P>
One train per day from Los Angeles to San Francisco, and one from there to 
here! And they're always sold out. It's a joke. 
</P>
<P>
Why not try two trains a day? Isn't that the way to serve the public and make 
money? It wouldn't surprise millions of train lovers to discover gold in them 
thar rails by running three or four trains a day between two of the greatest 
cities in the world.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: LA JOLLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Timothy Burns, longtime headmaster at La Jolla Country Day School, on Thursday 
told the faculty that he plans to resign to return to the Los Angeles area and 
pursue other career opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
As director of the private school for almost 10 years, Burns' tenure was 
perhaps best known for his decisions earlier this year that led to an 
arrangement in which Sharon Rogers ended her relationship as a fourth-grade 
teacher at the school. 
</P>
<P>
The wife of Navy Capt. Will Rogers III, Sharon Rogers and the school reached a 
mutual agreement in which she was paid to leave the school because of concerns 
about safety on the campus. In March, she was the target of a bombing while 
driving her van to school. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Saxon, president of the school's board of trustees, said the departure was 
not related to criticism of Burns for his handling of the Rogers affair. 
Instead, Saxon said, Burns wants to rejoin his family in Pasadena and consider 
new career objectives. 
</P>
<P>
Burns could not be reached for comment Thursday about his resignation, which 
takes effect at the end of the current school year. But, in a letter Thursday 
to the board president, he said "the time is simply good for me to explore new 
and different challenges."

NOT SO MUCH A VICTORY AS THE START OF A LONG RUN; 
</P>
<P>
ABORTION: WE'RE ENTERING A MARATHON OF LEGISLATIVE RACES THAT WILL DETERMINE 
WHAT, AND WHO, IS 'MODERATE' ON THIS ISSUE. 
</P>

<P>
After so many bitter losses, winning one tastes sweet. Winning two, even by an 
inch, can fuel a real certified sugar rush. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, those who support legal abortion got a taste of that high. In the 
first test of political power since the Webster decision came down from the 
Supreme Court, pro-choice voters in two governor's races showed that they were 
what they have claimed: the majority. They supplied a huge winning margin for 
James J. Florio in New Jersey and the razor-slim edge that has L. Douglas 
Wilder claiming victory in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
This was enough to make heads swim. After all, for most of the '80s, common 
political wisdom held that abortion was a losing issue. A candidate, the pols 
believed, was safer being pro-life than pro-choice. As of Tuesday, that's no 
longer true. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-choice forces had spent the decade fighting a rear-guard action in the 
courtrooms of America while the pro-life forces were out organizing voters. 
Now, in the post-Webster world, they finally began playing on the same field. 
And the newcomers look strong. 
</P>
<P>
But before anyone pops open the Champagne bottles, a word of caution: This is 
just the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion politics in America are as volatile as the stock market and as 
dizzying as a roller coaster. The current ride began on a downhill run with the 
Supreme Court. Next it soared to pro-choice victories in Congress and the 
Florida Legislature. These were followed by another duo of downers: two Bush 
vetoes in Washington, and the early success of a bill in Pennsylvania that 
could severely limit abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Now, out of New Jersey and Virginia comes another upper. But if the pattern 
suggests anything, this isn't the last curve. In the end, winning can be as 
tough and as close as in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Today, says Ethel Klein, a political scientist and marathon poll-watcher, "the 
politicians on the defensive are those who have taken the absolutist pro-life 
position -- those who took that stand out of political opportunism. The tables 
have turned on them and they're trying to unshackle themselves." 
</P>
<P>
On election morning, even George Bush seemed to be loosening the shackles on 
Republicans, saying that the party had room for diversity. "Is it (abortion) 
the most important issue for me?" he asked aloud. "Absolutely not." 
</P>
<P>
But Americans remain ambivalent about this most personal of public questions. 
"It's important to remember that this country is pro-choice but not 
pro-abortion," Klein warns. "While society wants to keep abortion safe and 
legal, it also wants the number of abortions reduced. And it's willing to put 
guidelines around access." 
</P>
<P>
The ride is not just going to go through high-profile gubernatorial races with 
their ads and accusations. It's going to pass through the state legislatures 
where those guidelines are written. It's going through arguments over the fine 
print of dozens of bills staking out a position on such issues as 
fetal-viability testing, parental consent and spousal consent. 
</P>
<P>
The most intense struggles will not be about the victims of rape and incest, or 
about the rights of minors. They will be about the fate of the majority of 
women who have abortions: adults making personal decisions. At what point in 
pregnancy, for what reasons and under what conditions will these women have 
access to abortion? As the pro-choice poster puts it, "Who decides?" 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's races, for all the last-minute waffling, were relatively clear 
battles between pro-choice and pro-life candidates. The next races may be 
murkier. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians will increasingly try to define themselves as speaking for that 
pro-choice anti-abortion majority. Among activists, says Frances Kissling, head 
of Catholics for a Free Choice, "the race is on to stake out what is moderate. 
Where is moderate on the spectrum and how does moderate fit with principles?" 
</P>
<P>
The good news from Tuesday for abortion-rights supporters is that voters 
defined the pro-choice view as moderate. In Virginia, the country's first black 
elected governor apparently squeaked into office because of his white 
opponent's "radical" stand against abortion. During the New Jersey race, five 
state legislators saw the light glancing off the front-runner and gave back 
their Right-to-Life endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
But these are still early laps on a ride that will reach its peak in the 1990 
legislative elections. So a restrained celebration is in order. When it's over, 
pass up the sweets of victory and start carbo-loading for a long, long run.

GOP WRIGGLES ON HOOK OF INSINCERE CONVICTIONS;

ABORTION: THERE WAS NO TREND SET IN TUESDAY'S ELECTIONS, BUT THE RESULTS WERE 
ENOUGH TO FLUSH THE OPPORTUNISTS OUT OF A DECADE OF DECEPTION.

<P>
Time crawls when you are not having any fun at all, so for Democrats it must 
seem a century rather than a mere decade since Ted Kennedy launched his first 
and last presidential campaign (Nov. 7, 1979). Ten years to the day later, 
Democrats had fun in New York City, New Jersey and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
On any given Election Day, the party that does best talks about national trends 
and the other party says, plaintively, "All politics are local." In the 
aftermath of Tuesday's results, Republicans are sounding plaintive, although 
they have a small slice of a point. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that New York will have yet another Democratic mayor is not momentous 
news, even if he is black. Virginia's new Democratic governor, who is black, 
will replace a popular Democrat who in turn replaced a popular Democrat. In New 
Jersey, people are probably more intensely interested in the issue of 
auto-insurance rates than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Republican Party is suffering a severe case of hamhandedness, 
beginning with its Maximum Leader. In September in New Jersey, President Bush 
said that the gubernatorial election there was a referendum of the national 
party's values. The Republican candidate, Jim Courter, caught the spirit: "If 
you liked Michael Dukakis, you'll love Jim Florio." Florio beat Courter with 
61% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans had won five victories in New Jersey in the 1980s -- Reagan carried 
it twice, Bush once, and Tom Kean twice won the governorship. How important was 
the abortion issue there and in Virginia? 
</P>
<P>
There is ample evidence that most Americans spend most waking hours thinking 
about sex. But abortion? Most voters will not pull the voting lever for or 
against a candidate solely because of his position on that issue. But it can 
change the way voters think about an entire party. It may make the Republican 
Party look cynical and frivolous. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion is one of the relatively few issues on which the parties are explicit 
and diametrically opposed. Democrats are for abortion as a fundamental 
constitutional right. The last three Republican platforms have called not 
merely for overturning the 1973 Supreme Court ruling -- not merely for 
restoring the abortion issue to the political arena -- but for a constitutional 
amendment to outlaw abortion. Probably 80% of the electorate opposes the 
Republican view. 
</P>
<P>
Courter's campaign collapsed early when he was unprepared to comment 
intelligently on last summer's Supreme Court ruling that expanded states' 
powers to regulate abortions. Then he waffled about his anti-abortion views, 
saying he still held them but would not let his convictions influence public 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican gubernatorial candidate in Virginia, Marshall Coleman, might 
have won in a walk instead of losing narrowly to L. Douglas Wilder had he not 
been so strongly anti-abortion. 
</P>
<P>
So from coast to coast, Republicans are tinkering with what they smilingly call 
their convictions. They are seeking graceful, or at any rate the least 
disgraceful, ways to say, "Er . . . um . . . well . . . on the other hand . . . 
that stuff we said about abortion being the murder of 'pre-born babies'? We 
never meant it." That will be the first truthful thing many of them have said 
on the subject for years. This party-wide exercise in, shall we say, 
clarification will require presidential leadership. 
</P>
<P>
This decade dawned with candidate Bush unburdening himself on the subject in 
the pages of Rolling Stone (March, 1980). There he said of the court's 1973 
decision: "I happen to think it was right." He happened to think that saying so 
would help him politically. It did not then, but it may now. So look for yet 
another U-turn, like the one he took in late summer, 1980, to get from 
pandering to Rolling Stone readers to running with Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican Party prospered in the 1980s because it was accorded -- 
sometimes grudgingly -- the respect that comes to institutions that have moral 
gravity. It had a seriousness that seemed admirable even to many people who 
were skeptical about its wisdom. Now, as the party begins the entertaining 
spectacle of wriggling off the hook on which it has impaled itself, it is in 
danger of sounding simply silly. 
</P>
<P>
Today the President, hero of last month's successful struggle to prevent public 
aid from reaching impoverished victims of rape and incest, sounds somehow 
softer. The day after his election, he said he would never, ever, change his 
position. But what is it this week? "I just come down more on the side of the 
life." Wriggle, wriggle. 
</P>
<P>
We who opposed the 1973 ruling when we read it rather than when we read polls 
about it have always seen the synthetic nature of much Republican opposition to 
it. Now everyone will see the insincerity as the political bill comes due for a 
decade of opportunism. 
</P>
<P>
More and more Republicans are going to say, " 'Murder'? No, actually we meant 
'mistake.' " And "Outlaw abortion? Where did that cockamamie idea come from?" 
More and more voters will say, "Be serious. No, come to think about, don't. We 
like you better the way you are."

HISTORY ISN'T FINISHED WITH CUAUHTEMOC CARDENAS;

MEXICO: THE THIRD-PARTY LEFT ONLY SEEMS TO BE OUT OF THE POWER LOOP. ITS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This time last year, after a highly disputed presidential election, Mexico was 
bordering on a constitutional crisis. Opposition candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas 
had delivered what seemed then to be an almost fatal blow to the official party 
and its designated heir, Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
</P>
<P>
Today Cardenas sets out on a one-week tour to present his case to influential 
people in the United States (including Los Angeles). Back home, Salinas seems 
to be firmly in charge, and his party is still in control of all but one state. 
Where does that leave Cardenas and his movement? 
</P>
<P>
Many Americans, reading about Salinas' accomplishments, might think that last 
year's turmoil is only a memory, that the democratic clamor of the people has 
subsided, that the Cardenas-led opposition is becoming irrelevant. In fact, 
beyond the superficial image of "business as usual," Mexico's political system 
is still suffering from last year's schism. There is a profound cleavage and 
antagonism between the government and the opposition due to Cardenas' 
democratic obstinacy and his refusal to recognize the validity of last year's 
official election results. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts, both in Mexico and in the United States, see this 
Salinas-Cardenas confrontation as a zero-sum game in which all Salinas' 
achievements must be counted as Cardenas' losses. The spectacular moves and the 
firm hand shown by Salinas during his first year have created the impression 
that he has consolidated power and gained political credibility at the expense 
of the strength and prestige built by Cardenas during the presidential 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that today Salinas enjoys a high rate of approval, particularly 
among the middle classes, direct beneficiaries of his economic program. But, 
surprising as it might seem, this approval has not been accompanied by a 
proportionate decline in Cardenas' popularity. A recent opinion poll conducted 
in Mexico by the Los Angeles Times showed that while Salinas' approval may be 
as high as 69%, Cardenas is viewed favorably by at least 50% of his 
compatriots. This apparent aberration is simply evidence of the transition 
Mexico is now experiencing. The public is torn between old and new: between the 
traditional sense of security given by the authoritarian presidency and the new 
aspirations of electoral democracy, pluralism, a peaceful alternation of power 
and government honesty and accountability. Mexicans are divided between the 
hope of social justice and economic equality represented by Cardenas and the 
dream of efficiency, prosperity and economic modernization expressed by 
Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last year, Cardenas has been trying to mobilize people to solve these 
differences and take these issues to the polls. He has organized a new 
political party, the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), and is demanding 
that the government devise a fair and competitive electoral system where vote 
counting is clean and open. 
</P>
<P>
The results are mixed. His greatest political achievement has been to keep 
alive his almost mystical link with the Mexican people. As he travels week 
after week across the country, Cardenas continues to turn out huge crowds and 
evoke extraordinary devotion from broad sectors of Mexican society. He has been 
able, so far, to use this moral authority to keep the disenchanted masses and 
his frustrated supporters away from violent confrontations with the government 
-- a gain for Mexico and a true gift to the government of Carlos Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
Cardenas' most notable failure has been his inability to oblige the government 
to accept meaningful electoral reform. A year ago, facing a crisis of 
legitimacy and driven by the need to build support and consensus, Salinas 
adopted one of Cardenas' original demands: serious political reform. Salinas 
failed to deliver, and Cardenas' did not have the force necessary to make it 
happen. He has until now not been able to transform his personal following into 
an effective political instrument to defend the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by their successful confrontation with Cardenas and the PRD, the 
government and the PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party) have continued to 
tamper with elections throughout the country. The most notable example was the 
local elections of Michoacan on July 2, where an independent tribunal of 
respected citizens concluded that the PRI stole at least 14 of the 18 seats in 
the legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The tactic of the government and the PRI has been to adopt a hard line with the 
left-of-center opposition and a soft stance with the rightist National Action 
Party (PAN). Michoacan and Baja California, where a PAN governor was sworn in 
last week, are the expressions of this "selective" democracy. In exchange for 
minor changes in electoral legislation, the PAN voted with the official party 
last month to approve several constitutional amendments that reinforce the 
one-party system. Cardenas faces a tough dilemma. He can continue to fight for 
change in the electoral arena, exposing his party and his supporters to the 
frustrating exercise of one defeat by fraud after another. Or he can adopt new 
but risky tactics of civil disobedience and boycotts. The government's message 
is clear: Either Cardenas, like the PAN, accepts the rules of the old game, or 
he and his supporters will be increasingly ostracized. The government hopes 
that if Cardenas does not come back to the fold -- that is, to the system 
controlled by one party -- he can be driven to radicalism and his moderate 
supporters scared away. There is no evidence that Cardenas can be co-opted, but 
the determination of the government not to change the country's electoral 
system could indeed drive voters to frustration and the democratic forces of 
Mexico into a dark alley of despair.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: THAI CHADA'S FARE'S FINE, BUT DON'T RELY ON STARS 
AS A GUIDE TO THE HEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID NELSON

<TEXT>
<P>
The next time a Texan boasts that he likes his chili so hot that the scent of 
it will stew a rattler at 50 paces, take him to the new Thai Chada in 
Hillcrest, order a dish that the server considers hot and stand clear. 
</P>
<P>
The heat scale in Thai cooking, like the Richter scale, seems open-ended, and, 
in terms of what it can do to the tongue, mouth and throat, almost as devasting 
when it reaches the higher numbers. The trick when ordering is to negotiate 
exactly the degree that you can tolerate, but not much less, because dishes 
designed to be hot tend to lose their sparkle when toned down. 
</P>
<P>
At Thai Chada, however, the act of negotiating the degree of spiciness can be 
complicated. By no means are all dishes spicy, but menu notes specify that hot 
dishes are marked with one star, and potentially incendiary dishes with two. 
These notes do not comment on dishes marked with three stars, but evidently 
assume that the uninitiated will think twice before setting off into dangerous 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
The star system at times seems relatively meaningless, however, because some 
servers will negotiate Western guests down the scale to the point where the 
cooking is no more tangy than a plate of mashed potatoes with chicken gravy. 
</P>
<P>
This need not happen. The excellent nam sod salad was ordered at its one-star 
strength one evening, despite the waiter's stern "I don't think you will like 
it." For all its searing heat, it was absolutely brilliant. Like many Oriental 
dishes, this one worked its magic by combining ingredients both cooked and raw, 
pungent and savory, salty and sweet -- in this case ground chicken, chopped 
peanuts, ginger, chilies, scallions, lime juice, onions and garlic. The ginger, 
freshly shredded and much in evidence, seemed to be the key element. 
</P>
<P>
Other salads combine similar assortments of ingredients, but not always with 
such fine results. The pra koong (technically a two-star dish, although the 
waiter must have told the kitchen to cool it) tossed a goodly number of large 
shrimp with slivered red onions, carrots and celery, and added lemon grass and 
scallions to the seasoning. But it seemed a weak-kneed relation at best to the 
nam sod. Also in this vein are the various yum salads, which combine a choice 
of beef, squid and mixed seafoods with cucumbers, tomatoes, onions and a 
variety of sharp and pungent seasonings. 
</P>
<P>
Thai restaurants tend to be attractively and carefully decorated, and Thai 
Chada follows the rule, with a few prominently displayed artworks setting a 
graceful tone. The service also is pleasing, if overly prompt, perhaps as a 
means of turning tables at this busy eatery with the greatest possible speed. 
(The menu informs guests that they should not think in terms of courses, and 
that food will arrive more or less at the same time. This attitude is at odds 
with the concept of leisurely dining, and, if left unchallenged, will result in 
a profusion of rapidly cooling serving plates scattered across the table. The 
remedy, as was discovered on a second visit, is to tell the server to allow an 
interval between dishes.) 
</P>
<P>
The appetizer lineup is relatively brief, but offers several first-rate 
choices, especially the deceptively uncomplicated "winter" shrimp. These 
consist simply of large shrimp shrouded in spring roll skins, the packages 
fried until crisp and then served with a refreshingly sweet peanut and cucumber 
sauce. Because the flavors are few, the shrimp stand out and seem unusually 
succulent. The Chada roll, the house version of the Thai spring roll, contains 
a little chopped chicken and a great deal of shredded vegetables, and fails 
because of its great girth. The bundles exude so much liquid internally during 
the frying process that they arrive more soggy than crisp. 
</P>
<P>
Thai Chada offers 10 kinds of noodle dishes at lunch, but just one, pad thai, 
at dinner. Noodles are such a staple of the Thai diet that their general 
omission is surprising; pad thai, a standard dish, tops rice noodles with 
shrimp, egg, bean sprouts, scallions and the chopped peanuts that add a 
distinctive flair to so many Thai dishes. 
</P>
<P>
The entrees range from relatively mild dishes that seem closely related to 
Cantonese cuisine to the various Thai curries and the sometimes outrageous 
tosses of meat, basil leaves and chilies that are emblematic of Thai cooking. 
These employ handfuls of basil along with garlic, peppers and onion, and their 
remarkable pungency is matched only by their sometimes volcanic heat. Shrimp, 
beef, pork, squid, chicken and duck can be had in this fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Other treatments also extend over a range of meats and seafoods, including a 
"string bean" designation that includes not only these innocent legumes, but 
chopped turnips and a hot sauce. The curries mostly are based on red curry 
paste, which is fairly straightforward and can be excellent, although it needs 
to be reasonably hot to be truly tasty. This was one of the dishes that a 
server, acting on his own advice, decided might be too much for his guests, and 
the resulting chicken curry contained so little red paste as to be disqualified 
from the competition. 
</P>
<P>
There is a massaman chicken curry, which gains a puckery quality from the 
presence of tamarind juice, but it went unsampled in favor of a rather 
disappointing Penang neau, or beef in a coconut-milk-based sauce (hence the 
Penang designation, since this city is famous for its coconut curries). The 
dish was hot enough, but the beef had the disagreeable flavor and somewhat 
rubbery texture of meat that has been cooked well in advance and simply 
reheated in a sauce. A similar problem removed much of the quality from the 
mild pork with ginger, an otherwise attractive enough dish of sliced pork with 
black "tree ear" mushrooms, slivered vegetables and a good dose of fresh 
ginger. 
</P>
<P>
The list of house specialties includes the wonderful "Royal Thai" omelet, a 
fat, fluffy, platter-size amalgam of beaten eggs that encloses chicken, 
vegetables and a savory sauce; it is definitely one of the best dishes here. 
Other possibilities on this list include the squid stuffed with noodles, 
chicken and mushrooms, the chicken in peanut sauce (pra-ram-long-song), the 
shrimp with bean threads and the "hot pot" of mixed seafoods. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant offers a genuine Thai dessert, squash custard, although Western 
guests may find little that is dessert-like about it. The name is somewhat 
misleading, since it is not a custard made of squash, but rather a large wedge 
of the vegetable, baked and topped with a sort of stiff pudding of carrots and 
a little unsweetened coconut. It is bland, but that may be exactly the effect 
Thai cooks wish to offer after a meal that can be (at least at times) as hot as 
a day spent stoking a blast furnace.

TORRANCE PLACES AIRPORT FUND ISSUE ON BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal that would allow the city of Torrance to eliminate its airport fund 
will appear on the March ballot, despite the objections of pilots who say the 
move would be an initial step toward closing the airfield. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members, characterizing the proposal to amend the City Charter as 
a simple bookkeeping change, shrugged off criticisms from pilots' groups as 
they voted unanimously Tuesday to place the measure on the March 6 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
City Finance Director Mary Giordano said that the measure would remove charter 
provisions requiring that the airport fund exist but that airport finances 
would continue to be accounted for separately. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, City Council members threatened to close Torrance Municipal Airport 
because of a pilots' lawsuit charging that the city has not obeyed state 
land-use planning laws. 
</P>
<P>
Pilots charged Tuesday that the Charter amendment would allow the city to 
siphon money away from the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"The only conclusion that we can draw is that you are using this apparently 
otherwise useless action to take one more step towards closure of the airport," 
said Scott Raphael, an attorney representing the California Aviation Council. 
</P>
<P>
The aviation council and several local pilots filed suit against Torrance last 
month, asking a judge to block development of 52 new homes under the airport's 
flight pattern until the city obeys a state law requiring that it prove the 
project is compatible with the airport.

CONFIDENT O'NEAL SAYS NOBODY DOES IT BETTER; 
</P>
<P>
CHARGERS: DON'T FEEL SAD FOR THE REST, BUT THIS OUTSIDE LINEBACKER BELIEVES 
HE'S REACHING THE TOP OF HIS PROFESSION. 
</P>

<P>
Leslie O'Neal is confident enough in his enormous abilities to say this: "I 
feel there is no one better than me." 
</P>
<P>
Strong stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, O'Neal is talking about the National Football League. More 
specifically, he is talking about the outside linebacker position the Chargers 
shifted him to this year. Before that, he was a defensive end. The change in 
nomenclature is deceiving. Essentially, O'Neal is a pass-rusher. 
</P>
<P>
And he is wise enough to qualify his contention that nobody does it better. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still some steps that I must climb to let everyone know that I am 
the best," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Smart stuff. 
</P>
<P>
The names that usually come to mind in any discussion about outside linebackers 
are the New York Giants' Lawrence Taylor, Buffalo's Cornelius Bennett and New 
England's Andre Tippett. Most people remember O'Neal as the rookie defensive 
lineman/comet who flashed into the NFL in 1986 and was leading the Chargers 
with 12 1/2 sacks before a knee injury ended his year in Week 13. Still, the 
voters named him the NFL's defensive rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Few people remember the agonizing rehabilitation that forced O'Neal to miss the 
1987 season and the first six games of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But in the past two weeks, O'Neal has collected 5 1/2 sacks and is tied with 
Denver's Simon Fletcher for the AFC lead in that category at 9 1/2. During 
those same two weeks, the Charger defense that had 15 sacks in the first seven 
games has added 10 more. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, a lot of people have remembered they had forgotten about 
O'Neal. And they are wondering if it's the same guy. The answer: It is, and it 
isn't. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal, the eighth player selected in the 1986 draft, still looks the same. His 
playing weight still fluctuates between 250 and 260 better and more valuable 
guy now than what he was." 
</P>
<P>
One thing O'Neal hasn't lost is the pass-rushing technique he brought with him 
from Oklahoma State. Charger outside linebacker Billy Ray Smith says it's the 
stuff of training films. And Gunther Cunningham, the Charger defensive line 
coach, uses film of O'Neal for just that purpose. If you are a defensive 
lineman and you join the Chargers, Cunningham will show you film of the way 
O'Neal rushes the passer. And he will tell you that's the way you should do it, 
too. Even when O'Neal was still a rookie, veterans were trying to copy his 
moves. 
</P>
<P>
"Leslie does things on the pass rush that almost have to be shown in slow 
motion to be appreciated," Smith says. "Things like the way he uses his hands 
and the way he maximizes body leverage at the point of attack." 
</P>
<P>
And that's not all. O'Neal is relentless, a trait appreciated by one of the 
hardest-working Chargers, free safety Vencie Glenn. Glenn is the son of a 
former football coach, and "work ethic" is as important to him as "trust fund" 
is to a scion of the Rockefeller fortune. 
</P>
<P>
"Leslie O'Neal is a workaholic," Glenn says. "Leslie's always going to be in a 
dogfight with you." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, O'Neal usually finds a way to fight the dog on his own terms. When 
the rehabilitation from his knee injury took more time than originally 
predicted, O'Neal remained calm. As late as March of 1988, he talked openly 
about the possibility he would never play again. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have to walk away from football, I think I will be able to do it with a 
cool head," he said at the time. "I didn't ask to be hurt, but it happened. I 
deal with it. I had fun the year I was playing, being around, meeting different 
people, being in the limelight. That was fun. But eventually it comes to an end 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal finally returned in the middle of last season. But he wasn't close to 
the player he had been. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't playing the game," he says. "I was more or less surviving it." 
</P>
<P>
The knee swelled up after each game and limited his practices to one a week. 
Still, he managed four sacks. And he refused to have his knee drained each 
week. The surgeon of his choice, Dr. Richard Steadman of South Lake Tahoe, told 
him that arthroscopic surgery after the season was the answer instead. 
</P>
<P>
"Leslie didn't let anybody rush him," Glenn says. "He did it his way. That's 
the way he is. He's his own man. Very independent. He believes in himself." 
</P>
<P>
Steadman turned out to be correct. The arthroscopic surgery he performed in 
January eliminated almost all the swelling. O'Neal missed very little training 
camp last summer, and now he practices every day. O'Neal says the surgery also 
ended the nagging "popping and grinding" he felt in the knee. 
</P>
<P>
"I look back at the beginning of this year and see how much stronger I feel 
now," he says. "I think I will even be stronger by the end of the year. And by 
next year I expect to see another vast improvement." 
</P>
<P>
Scary stuff. 
</P>
<P>
After O'Neal chased fleet-footed Philadelphia quarterback Randall Cunningham 
all over the field last Sunday in the Chargers' 20-17 upset victory, Cunningham 
singled O'Neal out for praise that was higher than even Cunningham realized at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
"O'Neal's a great ballplayer," Cunningham said. "He should be in the Pro Bowl 
again. He's big and fast. He came off that serious injury. He played a great 
game." 
</P>
<P>
All true. Except for one thing. O'Neal had never played in the Pro Bowl. He 
almost certainly would have been a choice in 1986, but the injury ruined his 
chances. In fact, even though O'Neal has been around since 1986, the same year 
Lynn arrived, he has played in only 31 regular season games -- many of those in 
a limited capacity. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a compliment," O'Neal said, eyes twinkling, when informed of 
Cunningham's remarks. "I take it he feels like I'm playing at a Pro Bowl level 
now." 
</P>
<P>
For his efforts against Philadelphia, O'Neal received the "gold card" award 
from his teammates. This award gives O'Neal "taping" privileges (he doesn't 
have to wait in line), free coffee, juice and donuts and the honor of riding to 
and from the practice field in a golf cart. Gold cards are voted on only after 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal caught a break in the schedule this year because the Chargers didn't 
play on artificial turf until the eighth week. Three of their last seven games 
are on the non-grass playing fields that are so hard on surgically repaired 
knees. Still, O'Neal expects to keep getting better. The NFL sack leader after 
nine weeks is Minnesota's Keith Millard with 13. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal isn't the only one who thinks his play can improve. After looking at the 
Eagles' game film, the Charger coaches decided O'Neal could have had six sacks. 
And they told him so. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say he is already back past where he was physically before the operation," 
says Charger offensive lineman James FitzPatrick. "He's always had that raw 
physical talent. But the thing that separates him from everybody else is the 
pride he takes in improving his technique. It's like a double-edged sword." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal says he is just happy to be playing again. And an examination of his 
past quickly provides part of the reason why. When O'Neal was 5, his father was 
disabled by an industrial accident in the family's home town of Little Rock, 
Ark. O'Neal's father struggled through several operations. And his condition 
actually regressed at one point when a hip replacement operation went bad. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," O'Neal says, "I am a different person than I was before my injury. The 
injury reinstalled the thought that on any given play, it can be over. You 
don't realize what you had until after it's gone and you get it back."

LAKERS CATCH WARRIORS A BIT SHORT, 106-95 
</P>

<P>
Maybe it is time to redefine these post-Kareem Lakers. Part Zelig, part 
quick-change artists, they apparently use whatever style they deem necessary 
for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, against the Golden State Warriors, who can play either tall or 
small, the Lakers turned into rebounding demons en route to a 106-95 victory 
before 15,025 at the Oakland Coliseum Arena. 
</P>
<P>
This was not a Laker masterpiece, but it was a good example of their 
versatility. The Lakers outrebounded the Warriors, 69-34, taking advantage of 
their own 36.1% shooting in a backhanded way. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat for the Warriors came one game after they lost 7-foot Alton Lister 
with a torn right Achilles' tendon. 
</P>
<P>
When not crashing the boards, Lakers big and small were crashing to the floor 
for loose balls and outhustling the Warriors, who supposedly are quicker than 
most opponents with their small lineup and use Manute Bol's height to clog the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
This also was proof that the Lakers do not always need exceptional performances 
from Magic Johnson or James Worthy to win, though both contributed. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson had his first triple-double of the season: 19 points, 10 rebounds and 
10 assists. Worthy overcame a third-quarter ankle strain to contribute 13 
points and 11 rebounds. But the standout on this night was power forward A.C. 
Green, who had 24 points and 16 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"This was probably the hardest we've played," guard Byron Scott said. "This is 
the way we'll have to play to be successful. Even though we're small, we are 
quick and we had a nose for the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"We had five guys going to the boards, and that's what we needed. The guards 
picked up the long rebounds. A.C. and Mychal (Thompson) were banging away 
inside. We wanted to make them pay for using the small lineup. But we played 
hard. You'll notice we got a lot of loose balls. We just beat them to (the 
loose balls)." 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson, in his 11th NBA season, said Thursday's rebounding performance, 
in which the Lakers held a 28-7 offensive advantage, was "the most impressive 
rebounding since I've been here." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, usually not prone to overstatement, also said he feels the Lakers have 
rarely put in such a sustained effort. 
</P>
<P>
"That's probably one of the hardest second halves I've been involved with," 
Johnson said. "Everybody worked. Everybody. If we play hard, it does not matter 
what you shoot. You're going to win the game." 
</P>
<P>
It was a good thing, perhaps, the Lakers did not rely solely on their shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson made only seven of 20 shots. Scott sank five of 19, Worthy five of 18. 
Of the starters, only Green did not suffer from cold shooting. He made seven of 
14 shots and 10 of 11 free-throw attempts. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers needed to tap different resources to overcome the Warriors, who led 
by six points at halftime behind forward Chris Mullin's 25 points. But, in the 
second half, a tough defense and emphasis on rebounding quickly erased Golden 
State's lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors were limited to 17 points in the third quarter and the Lakers held 
a six-point lead heading into the fourth quarter that would swell to 18 points 
in the late going. 
</P>
<P>
Mullin, after starting so strongly, was held to one free throw in the fourth 
quarter, and that came on a technical foul for illegal defense. Mullin finished 
with 30 points for the Warriors, who fell to 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers improved to 3-1, two of the victories coming on the road. 
</P>
<P>
The turning point and the possession that best exemplified the Lakers' 
aggressive rebounding stance came with 4:53 left in the third quarter. The 
Lakers attempted four shots, Green and Cooper missing first, then Johnson 
missing two follow attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, Scott outmuscled taller Warriors for the ball, scored inside and was 
fouled. He made the free throw, and the Lakers had the lead, 68-65. They never 
relinquished it. 
</P>
<P>
They never stopped working, either. 
</P>
<P>
Another example of Laker persistance came with about 6 1/2 minutes left in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Scott missed a jump shot. Johnson grabbed the long rebound, but missed the 
follow shot. Worthy grabbed Johnson's miss, but then missed from inside. A 
scramble for the loose ball ensued, Johnson finally emerging with it. With his 
back to the basket, Johnson flipped the ball into the basket, giving the Lakers 
a 94-81 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"In the second half, we came out more aggressive," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. 
"When we missed shots, we volleyballed the rebound. We have six or seven 
veterans who know each other and play together well." 
</P>
<P>
As Thompson, resident quipster described it, "Everyone played like their shorts 
were on fire." 
</P>
<P>
So far in the young season, the Lakers hold a 220-176 rebounding advantage over 
opponents. That should not come as too much of a surprise, since rebounding was 
never the strongest part of Abdul-Jabbar's game. 
</P>
<P>
"I never worried about our rebounding," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson said he will not appeal the $3,000 fine for his part in Tuesday 
night's pushing incident with the Phoenix Suns' Kevin Johnson. "I'm paying it 
and moving on," Johnson said. "The more I talk about it, the more frustrated I 
get." . . . Byron Scott, on being fined $500 for what he called "trying to 
break up" the fight: "The league thought I was trying to take a swing, but I 
saw it differently." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers gave a physical examination Wednesday to Jawann Oldham, the 
32-year-old center coming off reconstructive surgery on his left knee, but 
General Manager Jerry West said Thursday the team has "put on hold" its efforts 
to sign the 7-footer. West is expected to meet with the Laker coaching staff 
this morning to make a decision. Reggie Turner, Oldham's agent, said several 
teams have inquired about his client, but Oldham's first choice is the Lakers. 
"Jawann has always wanted to play for the Lakers," Turner said. However, the 
examination showed that Oldham's left knee has not regained its strength, which 
may prompt the Lakers to pass. Turner said: "His physical went as expected. 
(The Lakers') projection of his knee strength was from a cybex machine, which 
doctors (for) Sacramento (Oldham's former team) and Seattle (which is 
interested) did not really use. But what everybody I've talked to agrees on is 
that the knee is sound. The Lakers only want him for a limited role, and he can 
play 10 to 15 minutes a game with no problem." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Lakers, the SuperSonics, the Suns and the Miami Heat 
reportedly have shown interest in Oldham, released by the Sacramento Kings last 
week. Since he has cleared waivers, Oldham can be signed for the NBA minimum of 
$110,000, but he may go to the highest bidder. One scenario is that the 
Warriors, who have probably lost center Alton Lister for the season after he 
ruptured his right Achilles' tendon Wednesday night against the Clippers, will 
acquire holdout center Steve Johnson from Minnesota, and the Timberwolves will 
sign Oldham for well above the league minimum. "A lot of things could happen," 
Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
Laker reserve center Mark McNamara has been bothered recently by bursitis in 
his left shoulder. "I can't move my head to the left very well," McNamara said, 
"but I can still play."

<P>
The Chicago Blackhawks rallied from a three-goal deficit with the help of Dirk 
Graham's two goals to beat the Pittsburgh Penguins, 4-3, Thursday night at 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Graham's goals included a short-handed breakaway to tie the game, 3-3, at 4:06 
of the final period. Adam Creighton and Steve Larmer also scored for the 
Blackhawks, Larmer's power-play goal at 12:04 of the final period ending up as 
the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Quinn scored twice and Mario Lemieux once as the Penguins took a 3-0 lead 
in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
The victory lifted the Norris Division-leading Blackhawks' record to 12-6-1 and 
25 points, most in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec 7, N.Y. Islanders 5 -- The Nordiques broke their club-record eight-game 
losing streak with a victory at Uniondale, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>

a 7-2 victory over Minnesota Oct. 21. The Nordiques have the league's worst 
record at 4-12-1. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 4, Philadelphia 1 -- Gary Leeman scored the tie-breaking goal early in 
the third period and the Maple Leafs went on to win at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Leeman took his own rebound behind the net and slapped a five-footer past Pete 
Peeters to put Toronto ahead, 2-1, at 6:49. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia's Gord Murphy was given a five-minute high-sticking major for 
cutting Leeman after his goal. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 6, Edmonton 2 -- Bob Sweeney had the first three-goal game of his NHL 
career and Ken Linseman scored in his first game back from an injury as the 
Bruins won at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney, a former Boston College star, scored once in each period to run his 
goal total to eight as the Bruins completed the season series with the Oilers 
at 2-0-1. 
</P>
<P>
Linseman, playing for the first time after recuperating from surgery for a 
circulatory problem, scored the final Boston goal. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 1, Montreal 1 -- Paul MacLean's second-period goal gave the Blues a 
tie at St. Louis, extending their unbeaten streak to seven games. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis, 4-0-3 since losing, 6-1, to Philadelphia on Oct. 24, also tied the 
Canadiens, 3-3, Monday night in Montreal. The unbeaten streak is the Blues' 
longest since a club-record seven-game winning streak in 1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Courtnall scored on a first-period breakaway for the Canadiens, who are 
4-1-2 in their last eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 5, Detroit 1 -- Dave Gagner and rookie Mike Modano each scored two 
goals as the North Stars extended the Red Wings' winless streak to nine with a 
victory at Bloomington, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
The last-place Red Wings, are on their longest winless streak (0-6-3) since 
they went 0-10-2 from Dec. 29, 1984, to Jan. 21, 1985.

MR. BOLG IS EASY WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heavily favored Mr. Bolg romped to a 6 1/2-length victory over Comical in the 
$60,700 Messenger of Song Stakes for 3-year-olds Thursday, the feature race of 
the the Oak Tree at Santa Anita meeting. Arc of Tawa finished third, another 
neck back, in the field of six. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bolg, ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye and carrying 118 pounds, covered seven 
furlongs in 1:21 and paid $2.80 to win. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bolg was prominent from the outset, squeezed through along the rail down 
the backstretch, took command approaching the far turn and drew off. It was Mr. 
Bolg's fourth victory in 14 starts and second stakes victory. The $33,700 first 
prize raised his earnings to $156,681. 
</P>
<P>
For Delahoussaye, the leading rider at the meeting, it was his his seventh 
added- money victory of 19 run at the meet. For trainer Yves Seguin, a native 
of France, it was his first Oak Tree stakes victory.

SWITCH MAKES SCORING LESS OF JUDGMENT CALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The computerized scoring system introduced recently at amateur boxing's World 
Championships in Moscow didn't exactly draw rave reviews, but preliminary 
protests notwithstanding, the sport has probably been fundamentally changed 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
Protests over judges' scoring at the Seoul Olympics -- one decision 
precipitated a riot -- put the International Amateur Boxing Federation (AIBA) 
against the wall. The president of the International Olympic Committee, Juan 
Antonio Samaranch told AIBA, in effect, "Clean up your act or we'll eliminate 
boxing from the Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
AIBA president Anwar Chowdhry of Pakistan decided it was time for 
long-discussed computer scoring. The Soviet Union volunteered to design a 
system, since it hosted last September's World Championships. And when judges 
arrived in Moscow, they found a panel of switches at their desks, the two most 
important of which registered scoring blows, one for the boxer in the red 
corner, the other for the blue corner. 
</P>
<P>
Their scoring during the bouts was viewed on terminal screens by the AIBA 
president and the chairman of the appeals jury. 
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. officials, the Soviet system will be improved upon by a U.S. 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"The Moscow system had a lot of problems, many of which we were able to iron 
out during the tournament," said Jim Fox, executive director of the USA Amateur 
Boxing Federation. "But the fact is, if we'd had even the Soviet system in 
Seoul, we wouldn't have had that Roy Jones decision." 
</P>
<P>
Jones is the U.S. middleweight deprived of a gold medal in a controversial 
decision in Seoul. Another decision, which went against U.S. light-flyweight 
Michael Carbajal in another gold-medal bout, was thought to have been only 
slightly less outrageous by U.S. team officials. 
</P>
<P>
"No one in Moscow was completely happy with the Soviet system, but everyone was 
happy we'd taken the step," Fox said. "We're trying to find a computer company 
now that will design a better system, hopefully with a four-sided display 
screen above the ring so that everyone in the arena can see how a bout is being 
scored during the bout." 
</P>
<P>
That element was lacking in Moscow, where only officials seated at two ringside 
tables could see the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Fox said he hopes that the first U.S. computer scoring system will make its 
debut at Seattle's Goodwill Games next summer. No one can say if computers will 
eliminate charges of biased scoring at future Olympics, but one thing is sure, 
according to Fox: 
</P>
<P>
"Computerized scoring for the Olympics and other major international amateur 
boxing events is here to stay," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Paez might have been a hit with the crowd in his Forum debut last month, 
but the California Athletic Commission didn't care for his act. 
</P>
<P>
The International Boxing Federation featherweight champion, Paez came into the 
ring for his non-title fight wearing a sequined outfit that looked more suited 
for a wrestling show, performed a brief dance that some interpreted as 
suggestive, taunted his opponent during the fight and followed the ring-card 
women around the ring between rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Commission inspector George Yoshinaga went up on the ring apron after one 
between-rounds act and told Paez to knock it off. 
</P>
<P>
Commission President Raoul Silva of Los Angeles said Paez will attend a lecture 
before his next fight here. The Forum wants to bring him back to defend his 
title. 
</P>
<P>
"If he intends to fight in California again, we'll make sure he understands 
what we expect," Silva said. "There will be no obscene gestures, no carrying on 
with the ring girls. He's going to sit in his corner between rounds." 
</P>
<P>
Notice which organization among boxing's alphabet soup told Don King his 
heavyweight champion, Mike Tyson, would be stripped of his title if he didn't 
get cracking on a defense with everyone's No. 1 contender, Evander Holyfield? 
</P>
<P>
Was it Jose Sulaiman, who will preach at the drop of a sanction fee that the 
World Boxing Council stands for integrity in boxing? No, it was the World 
Boxing Assn., which told King that if Tyson beats Razor Ruddock on Nov. 18, 
Tyson will have 120 days to fight Holyfield or be stripped. 
</P>
<P>
That directive was subsequently put aside, of course, because Tyson-Ruddock was 
postponed when Tyson came down with a lung ailment. The point is, however, 
while the WBA's Elias Cordova was coming down hard on King, Sulaiman was busily 
moving James (Buster) Douglas from sixth to third in the WBC ratings. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas has been designated by King as a future opponent for Tyson, and never 
mind that he looked positively awful in winning a decision against Oliver 
McCall on the Tyson-Carl Williams undercard. 
</P>
<P>
Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Michael Dokes, who gave Evander Holyfield his toughest fight last February, has 
signed for a Forum fight Monday against Lionel Washington. . . . Jorge Paez 
defends his International Boxing Federation featherweight crown at Reno on NBC 
Dec. 9 against tough Lupe Gutierrez. . . . Flyweight Michael Carbajal, biggest 
surprise as a professional of the '88 U.S. Olympic team, meets Puerto Rican 
Pedro Feliciano Nov. 17 in a Telemundo TV network show. If he keeps knocking 
people out, Carbajal may get a flyweight title shot this summer, according to 
his promoter, Bob Arum. He's 9-0 and has knocked out seven opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Romero's state super-flyweight title fight with Martin Cardenas has been 
postponed to Dec. 5 at the San Diego Sports Arena. Romero suffered a slight 
neck injury while training for the original date, Nov. 2. . . . 
Superstar-in-the-making: Cuba expects big things from its 17-year-old 
middleweight, Ramon Garbey, since he won a world juniors championship in Puerto 
Rico. The Cubans, by the way, are still steamed over several decisions at the 
Moscow World Championships favoring Soviet boxers over Cubans. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Kulis says he's serious. The Southland cable TV boxing impresario wants to 
match Michael Nunn's mother, Madies Nunn, against Minna Wilson, mother of 
British fighter Tony Wilson. Both moms had scrapes with the law recently -- 
Nunn's in Davenport, Iowa, when her son, the IBF middleweight champion, wound 
up in the slammer after a scuffle with police. Wilson's mom charged into the 
ring during her son's most recent bout and began whacking his opponent with her 
shoe. . . . Caesars Palace will have a twin title fight show Nov. 18, Julio 
Cesar Chavez-Sammy Fuentes and Julian Jackson-Troy Wortham. 
</P>
<P>
A boxing writer wrote the following: "There are no good boxers today. At least 
if there are, I have not been able to find them. . . . Boxing is a lost art. . 
. . Boxing instructors who know the fine points of the game and who are 
qualified to teach them to others are very scarce. During over 50 years of 
experience I have known of no more than 10." The author was L.A. Times boxing 
writer Frank A. Garbutt, and that's an excerpt from his column published on 
Feb. 17, 1935.

MIRALESTE TANKERS BREEZE IN PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ocean League champion Miraleste breezed through the first round of CIF 2-A 
water polo playoffs Thursday, but Mira Costa and El Segundo didn't, falling in 
close games that had one coach crying foul. 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste, playing at home, defeated Western of Anaheim, 19-10, while Mira 
Costa lost at La Palma to Kennedy, 4-2. El Segundo lost at Agoura, 11-10. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa led, 1-0, on a goal by Matt Lutton, but Kennedy came back to take a 
2-1 lead at halftime and stretched it to 3-1 in the third quarter. Noah Willard 
scored to cut the deficit to 3-2. Kennedy got the final goal with three minutes 
left and ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa had two goals called back when an official ruled the Mustang players 
were standing on the bottom of the pool. However, Mira Costa Coach Mike Nollan 
claims the same official allowed Kennedy to play under similar circumstances. 
Though officials' judgment calls can't be protested, the incensed Nollan said 
he will send a complaint to the CIF, saying, "We lost because of the official." 
</P>
<P>
Nollan said: "Two (Mira Costa) goals were called back while (Kennedy) got three 
shot attempts standing on the bottom and no calls were made. One official made 
or refused to make all five of those calls. It was blatantly biased." 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa finished at 13-14. 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste, the third seed, easily held off Western, building an 11-4 halftime 
lead. Ocean League most valuable player Kyle Hildebrand led the attack with 
seven goals and got support from Andy Foster with five and Zoltan Gyurko with 
four. The Marauders' David Reed was outstanding in goal as Miraleste improved 
to 20-5. 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste led after one quarter, 5-2, and ballooned the lead to 17-10 after 
three periods, allowing the reserves to finish the game. The Marauders will 
face Alhambra in the second round Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo, the underdog against Frontier League champion Agoura, played evenly 
throughout. The game was tied, 2-2, after a quarter, 8-8 after three periods 
and was 10-10 going into the last minute. El Segundo sophomore goalie Chris 
Lubba, trying to avoid a steal, held the ball under water and Agoura was 
awarded a penalty shot. It was converted, giving Agoura the winning goal with 
31 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
For the Eagles, who finish 7-12, Darrel Schumann scored four goals, Robert 
Ingersoll three, Tim McGoldrick two and Mike Whitney one.

REFEREES DISALLOW FIELD GOAL TRY AT END SO PV EDGES ROLLING HILLS, 7-6; 
</P>
<P>
PREPS: CONFUSION ON THE FIELD HAS SEA KINGS' QUARTERBACK AND HIS COACHES IN AN 
UPROAR UNTIL THE OFFICIALS DECLARED THE GAME OVER.

<P>
Like all of his teammates, Palos Verdes High quarterback Blake Anderson was 
momentarily stunned Thursday when it appeared that Rolling Hills would be 
allowed to try a potential game-winning field goal with no time left. 
</P>
<P>
"I was panicking," Anderson said. "I had no idea what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
Don't feel bad, Blake. Nobody in the capacity crowd at Rolling Hills had a clue 
either. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes had started to celebrate its 7-6 Bay League win when the referees, 
after conferring on the sideline, allowed Rolling Hills to set up for a 24-yard 
field goal, even though the clock had run out on the Titans at the Palos Verdes 
8. 
</P>
<P>
The decision didn't sit well with the Palos Verdes coaches, who argued 
vehemently from the middle of the field until the referees, perhaps sensing 
they had blundered, changed their minds and declared the game over. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to get the ball if I had to," said Palos Verdes Coach Bill Judy. 
"We couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
With their sixth straight win, the Sea Kings improved to 9-1 overall and 
clinched the Bay League co-championship with a 6-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes shares the title with Hawthorne (9-1, 6-1), which will open the 
Southern Section Division II playoffs next week as the league's No. 1 entry by 
virtue of its 20-0 win over the Sea Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills can make the playoffs as a fourth-place, at-large entry if two 
things happen: Leuzinger beats Santa Monica tonight and the CIF at-large 
committee deems the Titans the most worthy fourth-place team in Division II. 
That decision will be made Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans' 6-3-1 overall record puts them in contention, but Coach Gary 
Kimbrell was understandably disappointed after watching his team's comeback 
hopes end less than 10 yards from the Palos Verdes goal line. 
</P>
<P>
"(The referees) took off, so I don't know what the deal was," he said. "They 
made one decision and then they changed it. I really don't know what they were 
thinking." 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills, which finished 3-3-1 in league play, trailed the entire game but 
pulled within one point when tailback Robert Coulter capped a nine-play, 
73-yard drive with an eight-yard touchdown run over the right side of the line 
with 2:44 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans again gave the ball to Coulter on a two-point conversion try, but 
this time Anderson came up from his free safety position to stop him one yard 
short of the goal line with help from tackle David Bohner. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody blocked me," Anderson said. "I ran up and hit him as hard as I could. I 
was looking for that exact play. I just had a feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson scored Palos Verdes' only touchdown on a four-yard keeper that capped 
the first possession of the game. The highlight of the 55-yard drive came on 
the first play from scrimmage when running back Bill Smiley completed a 30-yard 
option pass to wide receiver John Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's extra point made it 7-0 with 7:26 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
From there, the game slowed to a defensive struggle. Neither team drove inside 
the other's 40-yard line again until the third quarter, and Rolling Hills was 
stymied by two fumbles and an interception by quarterback Greg Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
But the Titans stayed close and rallied in the fourth quarter behind Coulter, 
who led all rushers with 144 yards on 27 carries. 
</P>
<P>
After Coulter's touchdown run made it 7-6, Rolling Hills forced Palos Verdes to 
punt and got the ball back with 1:36 left at its own 31 with no timeouts. 
</P>
<P>
The drive sputtered at first, but Schwartz suddenly got hot and completed 
successive passes of 24 yards to wide receiver Isaac Brown and 19 yards to 
tight end Jim Rudberg to move the ball to the Palos Verdes 20 with 10 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
The clock was stopped with each first down, to allow time to move the yard 
markers, and restarted when the ball was spotted.

Schwartz again hit Rudberg over the middle for the 12-yard gain to the 8, and 
the clock was stopped with two seconds left. Without any timeouts, though, 
Rolling Hills could only look on helplessly as the referees restarted the clock 
after spotting the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"The referee had spotted it," Judy said. "When you spot it on first down, you 
start the clock." 
</P>
<P>
Although Palos Verdes won, it lost the statistical battle. Rolling Hills 
outgained the Sea Kings in total yards, 246-167, and first downs, 15-9. 
</P>
<P>
Running back George Felactu led a balanced running attack for Palos Verdes with 
58 yards on 10 carries.

DOMINGUEZ HILLS HAS A DYNAMITE DUO IN SOCCER COACH AND HIS STAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
It could have been a Marine Corps boot camp. It certainly didn't look like the 
kind of workout that Kristi White, the premier women's soccer player at 
second-ranked Cal State Dominguez Hills, would expect before the national 
Division II finals. 
</P>
<P>
But there was the team's leading scorer, under a hazy, hot afternoon sun, 
running in formation with her teammates, circling the Lady Toro practice field 
in preparation for Saturday's national semifinal with fourth-ranked Keene State 
of New Hampshire at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Around and around the team went, the Palos Verdes Peninsula and the oil 
refineries of Carson as backdrops in the distance. At the helm, Coach Marine 
Cano barked instructions. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half of the two-hour session, White and her teammates, who wore 
matching black shorts and red T-shirts, never touched a soccer ball. They did 
sprints, they raced and when those were done the women jogged the field, 
stopping only once for water. 
</P>
<P>
"Back to the basics," explained Cano, which is why White, a senior from 
Camarillo, has spent eight seasons under his tutelage, first on a youth state 
select team and for the last four as a Lady Toro. 
</P>
<P>
"Conditioning is a big part of Marine's program," White, a graduate of Rio Mesa 
High School, said. "In high school I lacked conditioning. I thought I could 
become a better athlete if I came here." 
</P>
<P>
White, according to observers, has always had a knack for scoring goals, 
something she calls "the green light." In her career at Dominguez Hills the 
5-foot-4 midfielder has set school records for goals (33), assists (31), total 
points (97) and season assists (16). 
</P>
<P>
A knee injury forced her out of action half of her sophomore year, or those 
totals would be higher. With 17 goals and 50 points this year, she ranks second 
in both of those seasonal categories. 
</P>
<P>
"She's our Magic Johnson. That's for sure," said Cano. 
</P>
<P>
Cano, a former professional goalie, coaches state select girls and women's age 
group teams in the off-season. He recognized White's talent early in her 
career. 
</P>
<P>
"I always saw a very good player there," Cano said. "At the time, I thought I 
had a chance to help her develop. It was a little dream that I had that has all 
come together this season. 
</P>
<P>
"She always had the skills, but she was never completely fit and conditioned." 
</P>
<P>
Cano's feisty style and tough conditioning program, plus the chance to go away 
to school but remain fairly close to home, persuaded White to join Cano when 
she chose a college. Dominguez Hills, not known for over-generous scholarship 
offers, allowed Cano to give White a full ride, putting her on similar footing 
with another of the Division II university's "franchise players," basketball 
star Anthony Blackmon. Blackmon, now playing professionally in Japan, went on 
to become the 1989 California Collegiate Athletic Assn. Athlete of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Cano expects similar attributes for White, who figures to be named All-American 
no matter how Dominguez Hills fares at the national tournament this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
If White plays the role of the attacking halfback, as she has done all season, 
Dominguez Hills figures to play a major role in the championship tournament, 
which also includes top-ranked and host Barry University and sixth-ranked 
Adelphi University of New York. 
</P>
<P>
"She's our spark plug, a technician, the one that makes us go," Cano said. 
</P>
<P>
White wouldn't go that far. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always had the drive to go to the goal," White said. "Most players just 
have skills, but they don't have the drive to go to the goal." 
</P>
<P>
A forward in her youth, White, began playing in Camarillo's American Youth 
Soccer Organization at 8. By the time she was 12, she was playing on a boys 
age-group club team. In her first game with the boys, she anticipated a rebound 
off the crossbar and scored on a header, much to the chagrin of the opposing 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of neat," the diminutive blonde said. 
</P>
<P>
White has been ineffective only twice this season for the Lady Toros (18-2), 
who set school records for most wins and shutouts (15) in a season. Both times 
were games with UC Santa Barbara, a highly ranked Division I team. In fact, the 
Gauchos handed Dominguez Hills its two losses. Santa Barbara just had too many 
quick players shadowing White wherever she went on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"But," said Athletic Director Dan Guerrero, "just think what we could have done 
to Santa Barbara if we had three or four Kristi Whites." 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills often builds its teams around skilled players from the South 
Bay, a talent-laden soccer hotbed. By bringing in White, Cano introduced a new 
wrinkle to the area. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't have done so well without the rest of the team," White said. "Our 
freshmen helped out a lot. We lost only two seniors from last year's team, so 
we had the base to do well." 
</P>
<P>
White characterizes the Dominguez Hills team as being "physical, (yet) having 
the same finesse of any Division II school." 
</P>
<P>
Said Cano: "It's scary. We still have not reached our potential." 
</P>
<P>
White, however, admits that she is in better condition. She needs to be too. 
Two weeks from now she'll be back in Florida to play in a national tournament 
as a member of a Western women's select team.

MIRA COSTA CRUSHES REDONDO, 34-8 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Mira Costa kept its slim playoff hope alive and must now wait until Sunday to 
hear about possible postseason play by dominating Redondo, 34-8, in an Ocean 
League contest Thursday at Redondo High. 
</P>
<P>
The CIF at-large committee will meet Sunday morning to determine Mira Costa's 
future as a Division VII at-large entry. 
</P>
<P>
Senior running back Mike Clairemont rushed for 159 yards and two first-half 
touchdowns in the easy win. His first score was set up by a 53-yard 
interception return by Bill Stock. 
</P>
<P>
Clairemont's 22-yard touchdown with 3:34 remaining in the first period opened 
the scoring for Mira Costa. Clairemont scored again in the second period on a 
seven-yard run as the Mustangs led at halftime, 17-0. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa opened the second half with a 12-play, 60-yard drive capped by Jose 
Cervantes' one-yard run to build the lead to 24-0. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa's defense completely bottled up the Sea Hawks, forcing two 
interceptions and piling up five quarterback sacks. The Sea Hawks' only score 
came with 4:03 left in the third quarter on a three-yard run by Steve Delis to 
finish an 80-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
Sea Hawk quarterbacks completed three of 13 passes for 33 yards, and standout 
running back Antoine Humble was limited to 85 yards, 80 in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa finished the season at 4-3 in Ocean League play and 6-4 overall. The 
Sea Hawks ended at 3-3-1 and 4-5-1. 
</P>
<P>
South Torrance 35, North Torrance 7 -- Quarterback Kevin Fitzpatrick rushed for 
four touchdowns and passed for a fifth to help the host Spartans clinch second 
place in the Ocean League and a berth in the Southern Section Division VII 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzpatrick rushed for 84 yards on 13 carries and completed five of nine passes 
for 85 yards as South ended the regular season with a 5-5 overall record and 
5-2 league mark. The victory snapped a two-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzpatrick passed to Brian Lee for a five-yard touchdown and ran nine yards 
for another score in the first quarter. He added a six-yard TD run in the 
second quarter to give South a 21-7 halftime lead and added scoring runs of 
eight and 20 yards in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
All of Fitzpatrick's scoring runs came on option plays. 
</P>
<P>
North (2-8, 2-5) scored its only touchdown on a 67-yard pass from Brian Jurado 
to Eric Hansen in the first quarter. Hansen finished with five catches, giving 
him 85 on the season and ranking him eighth on the all-time Southern Section 
list. 
</P>
<P>
West Torrance 15, Culver City 14 -- The Warriors, who took a 15-0 lead into the 
fourth quarter at Culver City, had to stop a two-point conversion with 1:47 
left to register their ninth straight win and finish as undefeated Ocean League 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
An 18-yard touchdown pass from Culver City quarterback Troy Dunlap to Dameron 
Rickets pulled the Centaurs within one, but Dunlap couldn't find an open 
receiver on the two-point try and was tackled by linebacker Jae Kim. 
</P>
<P>
West (9-1 overall, 7-0 in league play) was led by quarterback John Walsh, who 
completed 15 of 22 passes for 169 yards and hit wide receiver Ryan Berry with 
an 11-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors' other points came on field goals of 28, 30 and 30 yards by Tom 
Dallen. 
</P>
<P>
Culver City (5-4-1, 2-4-1), which was 0-4-1 in its last five games, came back 
behind the play of Dunlap, who had an interception and two TD throws in the 
fourth quarter. GREG GONZALEZ

BORDWELL PASS LIFTS EL CAMINO REAL

<P>
Jeff Duva, a former El Camino Real High All-City quarterback, returned to watch 
his first Conquistadore football game in five years Thursday night and had to 
be impressed with what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
Duva, who led El Camino Real to the City final in 1972, saw Tony Bordwell 
complete his first touchdown pass of the year -- a 29-yarder to Ronnu Griffin 
with 46 seconds to play -- to lift El Camino Real to a 13-7 West Valley League 
victory over Canoga Park (1-7, 1-5) at Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
Bordwell, who didn't complete a pass in last week's win over Cleveland and 
missed on his first six attempts against Canoga Park, finished five for 13 for 
72 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Fullback Jamal Anderson registered his second consecutive strong performance in 
two weeks. Anderson, who rushed for 172 yards and two touchdowns last week, 
gained 182 yards in 15 carries and scored a touchdown on a 54-yard run in the 
first period. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson also had a 26-yard touchdown run called back on a holding penalty in 
the second quarter. El Camino Real (4-4, 3-3 in league play) is 4-0 this season 
in games in which Anderson has rushed for more than 100 yards. JIM COLEMAN

GAGLIANO MOVES CLOSER TO STATE RECORD BUT MONROE BOWS TO VAN NUYS, 17-10

Monroe High kicker Rachel Gagliano kicked a field goal and an extra point 
Thursday afternoon, but her efforts weren't enough for the visiting Vikings, 
who fell to Van Nuys, 17-10 in a Mid-Valley League game. Gagliano has scored 10 
points this season, putting her within a point of the state record for most 
points by a girl in a season. 
</P>
<P>
Mia Labowitz of San Diego High converted eight of nine extra-point attempts and 
kicked a 32-yard field goal to set the record in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys running back Diallo Frazier broke a 10-10 tie when he capped a 
seven-play, 65-yard drive with a 25-yard touchdown run with 8:44 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Boudreaux opened the scoring for the Wolves on a five-yard run in the 
second quarter, but Monroe running back Sean Bell answered with a 95-yard 
touchdown on the ensuing kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
Cuneyt Karacuha also scored for Van Nuys, kicking a 35-yard field goal in the 
third quarter to give the Wolves a 10-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids have been really supportive," said Annette Gagliano, Rachel's mother. 
"I know that they (the team) were really aware of the record going into the 
game today, and they've been just terrific with her. I think they want her to 
break the record as much as she does." NAOMI TWARD

Reseda 12, Birmingham 12 -- A 90-yard punt return by Chris Kates with 5:45 left 
salvaged the tie for the host Regents. Reseda (5-1-2, 4-1-1) had a chance to 
win, but Daniel Mendez missed the conversion.

Birmingham (4-3-1, 2-3-1) also had an opportunity to break the tie, but Jake 
Brescher's 37-yard field goal attempt with nine seconds left went wide left. 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham quarterback Danny Larson completed 15 of 25 passes for 246 yards and 
two touchdowns. Brescher made a game-high eight catches for 144 yards,

<P>
The bulk of Kennedy's offense was provided by Ontiwaun Carter, who rushed for 
99 yards in 29 carries. Kennedy quarterback Tony Vazquez completed six of 21

McGrath with less than two minutes remaining. DANIEL NEHORAI

GLENDALE LONG ON EXPERIENCE; 
</P>
<P>
SAVVY: ALTHOUGH NO STARTER IS TALLER THAN 6-FOOT-5, FIVE OF THE VAQUEROS' TOP 
SIX PLAYERS FROM LAST SEASON ARE BACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Shots are taken from a variety of positions and distances when Glendale College 
plays basketball, a tribute to the touch and range of the Vaqueros' triggermen. 
</P>
<P>
"We can hit from all angles," Coach Brian Beauchemin said. "Just about all of 
our guys have scoring potential." 
</P>
<P>
And hit they must. Because if they don't, their chances are slim of getting 
another shot off. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale is experienced, quick of foot, tough on defense and capable of 
shooting the proverbial lights out. But the Vaqueros, whose tallest starter is 
6-foot-5, also happen to be somewhat small for a junior college team. 
</P>
<P>
Beauchemin is hopeful that experience -- five of Glendale's top six players 
from last season return -- will be a key factor as the Vaqueros try to scale 
new heights. Glendale, with a lineup of freshmen, was 19-12 last season and 
placed second in the Western State Conference Southern Division. "We played as 
well as we could under the circumstances," Beauchemin says, "but were 
inconsistent due to our lack of experience." 
</P>
<P>
Guard Bruce Heicke and forwards Gary Fowler and Dave Swanson all posted scoring 
averages in double figures last season. Swanson, a 6-5 transfer from Cal State 
Northridge, is a good outside shooter and a seven-foot high jumper who is fast 
becoming a solid defensive player and rebounder. 
</P>
<P>
"He's come a long way on defense," Beauchemin said. "And his rebounding also 
has improved. I look for him to have a banner-type year." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale's problem is at center. "We don't have one," Beauchemin said. But with 
its lineup returning almost intact, Glendale would be hard pressed to not 
improve. 
</P>
<P>
However, the four other Valley-area junior college teams also are expected to 
be better. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark, which will begin its season tonight against Chaffey in the first 
round of the Mt. San Antonio tournament, has four starters back, including Greg 
Taylor, its leading rebounder, and Bruce Watson, Roger Thomas and Sean Young, 
all of whom averaged 10 points or more. 
</P>
<P>
Valley, which will open tonight at Pasadena, has plenty of shooters but a 
shortage of basketballs to distribute among its big guns. 
</P>
<P>
"When we started practice we needed about five basketballs," Coach Jim Stephens 
said facetiously, "but we're getting better. Now we're down to two." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Ward, a 6-4 guard who averaged 24 points a game for Valley two years ago, 
is back after using a redshirt year to concentrate on academics. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Ward in the Monarch lineup is former Simi Valley High standout Shawn 
DeLaittre, a 6-5 transfer from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo; Cliff Barnes, a 6-5 
transfer from Northridge; Andre Harrell, a 6-1 guard who was a top scorer two 
years ago at West Los Angeles College; and Rick Garrick, a 6-1 point guard from 
Chatsworth High. 
</P>
<P>
Eric McDaniels, a 5-11 point guard who transferred from Chaminade (Hawaii), and 
Arthur Wells, a 6-3 freshman guard from Hawthorne High, will see plenty of 
action off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
At Canyons, Lee Smelser begins his 21st season as coach of the Cougars in a 
quandary over his lineup. Aaron Clark and Larry Allbritton, the top scorers on 
last season's team, are the only ones set. Clark, a 6-3 forward from Quincy, 
Ill., averaged 19 points and was first-team All-Western State Conference last 
season. Allbritton, a 6-4 guard from Canyon High, averaged 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
Among those still fighting for a starting position is Steve Valenzuela, a 6-2 
guard who averaged 12 points as a part-time starter in 1988. "We have so many 
people battling, it can only make us stronger," Smelser said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Dorst, a 6-5 center who helped Saugus High win the Southern Section 3-A 
Division championship in 1986, is a newcomer who is expected to help Canyons' 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
Like Glendale and Canyons, Antelope Valley opens its season next week. The 
Marauders have a new coach in Newton Chelette, who formerly coached at Santa 
Barbara City College and Southeast Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
One of his impact players could be Paul Ernst, a transfer who was an 
all-conference pick at Santa Barbara last season. Dedan Thomas, a former Taft 
High standout who transferred from Nevada Las Vegas, will be the point guard.

HIGHLANDERS' WATER POLO TEAM OVERCOMES KEY PLAYER LOSSES TO WIN NINTH 
CONSECUTIVE MARMONTE LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Steve Snyder blanched when he heard the news, then tried to steady himself. 
Hank Toring, a chief booster of Snyder's Royal High water polo program and the 
coach's close friend, might just as well have punched him in the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
After a lengthy meeting in June in which the two men ironed out details for the 
team's summer trip to Hawaii, Snyder noticed the troubled look on Toring's 
face. 
</P>
<P>
"I could tell something was wrong with him, but I didn't have a clue," Snyder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, it was Snyder who felt troubled. Toring told Snyder that he had decided 
to send his son Jim to Harvard High instead of Royal. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I had the wind knocked out of me," Snyder said. "I saw stars and 
my knees were weak. My first thought was, 'This can't be happening to me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Toring called the decision the toughest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I've bought and sold houses and made all kinds of decisions, but none were 
harder than this," he said. "I love Steve Snyder. I would do anything for the 
Royal program. How could I tell him that I was taking away a kid that he was 
counting on?" 
</P>
<P>
To say that Jim Toring is the best water polo prospect to come out of Simi 
Valley understates his talent and only hints at Snyder's anguish. Toring, a 
6-foot-2, 140-pound freshman driver on the Harvard team, might be the best 
15-year-old player in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
When he made the national youth training team for players 17 and under last 
year, he was the youngest player (age 13) ever selected. 
</P>
<P>
"I still can't believe he's here," Harvard Coach Rich Corso said. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder still has trouble believing he is not at Royal. But Toring represents 
more than a bright young talent to Snyder. His bloodlines are laced with 
Highlander green and gold. His father is the general manager of the age-group 
water polo association that Snyder founded in Simi Valley. His brother Rob, in 
1984-85, led the Highlanders to two of their nine consecutive Marmonte League 
titles and currently coaches the age-group teams. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Toring entered that program as an 8-year-old and has traveled with the 
varsity team to Hawaii where Snyder gave him surfing lessons. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder acted like a doting uncle around Jim, in part because he saw himself in 
the young athlete. Snyder starred at Reseda High and swam on the Cal State Long 
Beach water polo team that placed third in the nation in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder admits that he didn't take the news of Toring's defection well. "I 
sulked for about a week," he said. But he understood the family's reasons. The 
water polo programs at each school are comparable, but the academic program 
offered at Royal, a public high school in Simi Valley, is no match for the 
program at one of the area's most prestigious and expensive prep schools. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder and the Highlanders wished Toring well when school started in September. 
Devin Hurst, a senior who holds the school single-season and career scoring 
records, spoke for the team. 
</P>
<P>
"Me and Jimmy are pretty good friends and it hurt to lose such a good player," 
he said. "We had looked forward to this year when we would play together. But I 
wasn't mad. I wished I had the same opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Snyder has made his peace with the Torings too. He watched Toring play in a 
Harvard match this fall, and Toring still swims at Royal's home pool with the 
age-group team. But there has been more this season to trouble Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
Before the first match, Mike Mendoza, who won a varsity letter last season in 
his first season of water polo, moved back to the Bay Area for family reasons, 
costing Royal a probable starter. 
</P>
<P>
Two other projected starters left the program when brothers Marten and Ryan 
Duncan quit the team in September, saying they wanted to concentrate on 
swimming. Snyder couldn't blame the swim coach because he is the swim coach. 
</P>
<P>
"They led us to believe that we could count on them," he said. "I just think 
it's wrong in high school to specialize that much." 
</P>
<P>
A month later, during the team's participation in a tournament in San Luis 
Obispo, Royal lost two more players, including a starter, for disciplinary 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Two of our players got caught by the police trying to buy alcohol," Snyder 
said. "That violates my primary rule: 'If you're caught with alcohol or drugs, 
you're immediately off the team for the rest of the season.' It hurt us badly, 
but it's something we had to do." 
</P>
<P>
After losing five of the program's top eight players, Snyder has built another 
Marmonte League champion around Hurst and a group of players projected for the 
junior varsity. Hurst has scored 128 goals, shattering the school record he set 
last year. He scored 112 goals as a junior to break the mark of 110 set by his 
brother Dain in 1985. Devin Hurst owns the school career record with 312 goals. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst led Royal to its ninth consecutive league title this season and helped 
extend the school's league winning streak to 34. He scored five goals in 
Royal's 11-6 win Wednesday over Glendale in the first round of the Southern 
Section 3-A Division playoffs and brought the Highlanders (15-6) face to face 
with their nemesis -- the second round. 
</P>
<P>
In Snyder's 10 years with the program, the Highlanders have been to the 
playoffs each year and have yet to win a second-round match. Today's match on 
the road against top-seeded El Toro will be Royal's eighth try at breaking the 
jinx. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the stuff that has happened to us, wouldn't it be ironic if this is 
the year we break the jinx," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
The amusement is back for Snyder, who wondered if this would be his last season 
as coach. The loss of Toring, along with the other setbacks, forced him to 
question his role as leader of the program. At 41, he wondered if coaching was 
still worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my first reactions to losing Jimmy was to think, 'Why is this happening 
to me?' " he said. "It took me a while to remember that this is not for me or 
about me at all. Jimmy made a decision that was in his best interest, and I 
wish him all the best. But I'm not in this job for me. I'm in it for the love 
of the sport and for these guys in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really down before, but I'm having a blast. I realized that I have a 
great job. While most guys my age are battling on the freeway, I'm out in the 
sunshine getting a tan and working with kids who want to be here, and that's 
great."

TONY CLARK DECISIONS MAY BE MADE TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Tony Clark eligibility vigil continues, but today at least should end 
speculation regarding the future of the talented high school basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
At 10 a.m. today, Clark will hold a press conference at Police Athletic League 
offices in Spreckles Theater to announce where he will attend college. He is 
said to be leaning toward Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
"If people are happy with my choice, great," Clark said. "I hope they wish me 
their best. If they aren't, well, they're not the ones who have to live with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Clark's eligibility for the upcoming high school basketball season could be 
decided today. The San Diego Section Board of Managers held a special closed 
session Thursday to hear an appeal by Clark's parents and lawyer Tim MacNeil 
that Clark be allowed to play for Christian this year. Clark transferred from 
Valhalla, but Principal Bob Avant has refused to sign a transfer waiver.

<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Bunch, an Austin, Tex., attorney, wasn't the only one to realize last 
spring that the federal government was about to become the biggest real estate 
operator in history. 
</P>
<P>
Congress was then setting up the mechanism to seize the assets of hundreds of 
shipwrecked savings and loans. Yet Bunch, two fellow lawyers, a Colorado 
senator and a few others also saw the opportunity for getting a precise 
inventory of as much as 2 million acres of U.S. land. 
</P>
<P>
At a minimum, they want conservation groups and government agencies alerted to 
any promising real estate to give them at least a crack at preserving 
watersheds, animal habitat or even property that could be converted into urban 
recreation areas. Under the least ambitious scenario, such groups could then 
bid on the land along with real estate developers or anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
But Bunch and his fellow attorneys would like to go further and exclude 
developers from bidding on environmentally valuable property, giving local, 
state and federal agencies -- and perhaps private conservation groups -- first 
refusal. 
</P>
<P>
"The taxpayers are putting out a whole lot of money," says Rick Lowerre, one of 
the Texas lawyers, "so let's find a way to give them some return." 
</P>
<P>
And he means more than just the opportunity to set aside wetlands. "Especially 
in Texas," he notes, "there are a lot of towns in dire need of local parks." 
</P>
<P>
However, protecting endangered species or potential picnic areas is a low 
priority at the moment for the Resolution Trust Corp., or RTC, the agency 
created to receive and resell assets of the failed savings and loans. 
</P>
<P>
The RTC is already hard-pressed for staff and money to engineer such rescues as 
its "shotgun weddings" between sick and healthy savings and loans, let alone to 
sort through the world's largest mountain of good and bad mortgages, fraudulent 
investments and half-finished developments. 
</P>
<P>
Lowerre and others say their hope lies in a one-paragraph amendment to the law 
governing the RTC. The amendment, sponsored by conservation-minded Sen. Tim 
Wirth (D-Colo.) and tacked onto the law only after considerable political 
infighting, requires an inventory by Jan. 1 to identify properties with 
"natural, cultural, recreational, or scientific values of special 
significance." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists also point out that a substantial body of law already 
regulates how the government is supposed to dispose of its own resources. The 
Bush Presidential Wetlands Executive Order, for example, is designed to halt 
further loss of waterfowl habitat and has been used by the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service to place conservation easements on lands acquired by the 
federal Farmers Home Administration from delinquent loans. Before that agency 
can resell its lands, any endangered species habitat or wetlands discovered on 
them must be preserved by an easement, much like those used to protect 
rights-of-way for power lines and roads. 
</P>
<P>
And so, in quiet negotiations, Sen. Wirth and others are discussing with RTC 
just how this environmental window shopping will be carried out. And public and 
private conservation groups -- not least the three lawyers from Austin -- are 
coming up with their own plans. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole project," says Lowerre, "came out of basically a lawyer here 
(Bunch) saying that if debt-for-nature is good for Latin America, isn't it good 
here in the United States too?" 
</P>
<P>
Lowerre, Bunch and David Frederick, on contract to the Texas Center for Policy 
Studies, learned of the Wirth amendment as they looked for opportunities for 
environmentalists in the S&amp;L bailout. 
</P>
<P>
They believe that more than half the property under the RTC's jurisdiction is 
rural, undeveloped land that might have conservation value. Environmental 
groups annually spend millions of dollars searching out and buying such land. 
</P>
<P>
As their studies have continued, Lowerre and the others have seen an even 
larger goal. 
</P>
<P>
"The environmental community has a real opportunity to go beyond the bailout 
and open up the financial agencies to the requirements of the federal 
environmental laws," they wrote in a recent letter seeking financing for their 
study. "Our federal banking policies affect our natural resource as surely as 
our international loans affect the world's rain forests." 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers also made the rounds of environmental groups with their ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"I must say we were impressed," says Michael McCloskey, chairman of the Sierra 
Club. "We said we would help plug them in around the country." 
</P>
<P>
McCloskey is especially pleased that the plan wasn't meant to hold up the 
efficient sale of the land, but merely to screen it for environmental values 
before the government let go of it. 
</P>
<P>
Lowerre expects surviving savings and loans in Texas to be equally 
enthusiastic. Many are teetering on the brink of insolvency as it is, and a 
flood of real estate back on the already depressed market would only make 
matters worse. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever you can limit the amount of land that will be dumped on the market it 
may be beneficial, especially during the transition period of dealing with all 
this real estate," agrees Commissioner James L. Pledger of the Texas Savings 
and Loan Department, the state agency overseeing savings and loans. 
</P>
<P>
"We have so much land," sighs Tom King, president of the Texas Savings and Loan 
League, which represents the industry. "I'm sure if the environmentalists 
wanted to buy it for the swamp it was, to keep turtles and some other things 
alive, it would be available. I'm being a little bit facetious, but I'm sure 
there is an unprecedented opportunity for these people to acquire land now at 
devaluated prices that may never occur again." 
</P>
<P>
The beleaguered examiners at RTC, however, are not likely to greet the idea as 
warmly. They have looming deadlines and numerous congressionally mandated 
goals, one of which is to sell the assets at no less than 95% of fair market 
value. Attaching an environmental easement to land, for instance, almost always 
lowers its value. And narrowing the market to keep out developers could 
restrict the bidding as well. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't say you're going to totally dedicate all the resources that could 
possibly be utilized for public purpose, and exclude them to a big part of the 
market that might pay a higher price," says Steve Fritts of RTC, "when one of 
the primary functions of RTC is to generate the maximum cash flow to repay 
these bonds and the taxpayers that are funding this resolution." Fritts is 
acting deputy regional director for asset and real estate management in the 
Dallas office of RTC. 
</P>
<P>
Fritts hasn't yet heard of the ideas of Lowerre and his cohorts, who plan to 
submit their written proposal to RTC next week as part of the current 30-day 
public comment period. Meanwhile, driven by the Jan. 1 deadline, Fritts is 
using existing electronic data describing the property to complete the first 
inventory. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite a monumental task," says Fritts, noting that it will cover more 
than 20,000 parcels of real estate in Texas alone. He sees no way for on-site 
inspections. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is discussing a proposal to 
undertake its own inventory, much as it did with the Farmers Home 
Administration. Sen. Wirth continues his negotiations with RTC's Oversight 
Board. And Lowerre and his fellow attorneys work on their own proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking into California next," he says.

MCDONNELL FEARS NORTHROP'S IMAGE MAY HURT ATF BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas is apparently concerned that Northrop's corporate image 
problems could undermine the two firms' chances of winning a competition to 
jointly build the Advanced Tactical Fighter, according to securities analysts 
and industry sources. 
</P>
<P>
A McDonnell session with analysts earlier this week left many of them convinced 
that the firm has entered discussions to significantly modify its agreement 
with Northrop, including the possibility of taking over Northrop's leadership 
position. 
</P>
<P>
A key industry source said McDonnell has broached the idea of switching roles 
with Northrop in the team effort. Northrop officials, however, denied that 
there have been any such discussions. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop is the prime contractor and McDonnell a subcontractor to Northrop in 
the massive $64-billion Air Force ATF program. The two firms are competing for 
a future contract to build the fighter against prime contractor Lockheed and 
its team of Boeing and General Dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
At a securities analysts meeting in New York on Tuesday, McDonnell Chairman 
John McDonnell was asked by analysts if he was concerned about Northrop's 
ability to win the ATF program while the firm is embroiled in numerous federal 
criminal investigations and other public relations struggles. 
</P>
<P>
John McDonnell declined to directly answer what some regarded as tough and even 
loaded questions, but he acknowledged that the two firms were "in discussions" 
on that issue, according to three analysts at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"My sense is that McDonnell and Northrop are aware of the tarnish on Northrop's 
reputation and how that might affect the outcome of the competition and they 
have had discussions about the issue," said Howard A. Rubel, aerospace analyst 
at the securities firm C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Aseritis, analyst at First Boston, said that at the New York meeting 
McDonnell "left open the possibility that the two team members might modify the 
teaming agreement between them." 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell spokesman Michael I. Burch, who was at the New York meeting, said 
John McDonnell "intentionally did not rise to the bait" that analysts had set 
by asking about Northrop's tarnished reputation. Burch declined to confirm that 
John McDonnell said discussions were occurring, but he acknowledged that the 
conclusion reached by analysts could be inferred from McDonnell's comments. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop President Kent Kresa said through a spokesman, "There have been no 
discussions." 
</P>
<P>
Northrop and Lockheed are each developing two prototype ATFs that will compete 
in a "fly off" over the Mojave Desert at Edwards Air Force Base starting next 
year. The jet fighters will cruise supersonically and feature Stealth designs. 
</P>
<P>
It remains unclear how McDonnell could legally switch roles with Northrop in 
the program, since it was Northrop's Stealth design that was selected as one of 
two winners. The technology in Northrop's design is proprietary, and it is 
unlikely Northrop would cede what could be one of the most lucrative defense 
contracts of the 1990s, industry sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials, reached late Thursday, said they would not have any 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force has clearly fueled speculation in recent weeks, after it 
disclosed that it was planning to stretch out the ATF's development schedule by 
six months. Although the service hasn't explained that decision, analysts say 
it represents an effort to allow the Lockheed team to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed is believed to be at least six months behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Northrop last week shipped its completed ATF aircraft, minus its 
engines, to Edwards and is ready to begin flight testing early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Industry sources told The Times that the Air Force will not allow Northrop to 
win by default. Senior Air Force officials have reportedly said they cannot 
politically keep the program alive without a competition. 
</P>
<P>
But by stretching out the schedule for Lockheed's benefit, the Air Force has 
sent a signal that many interpret as a bad omen for Northrop. 
</P>
<P>
"Several analysts have come to the same conclusion that it appears the Air 
Force is stacking the deck against Northrop and McDonnell at this juncture," 
Rubel, the C. J. Lawrence analyst, said. "It seems that Northrop and McDonnell 
have delivered on their promise and now that they are closer to the finish 
line, the Air Force wants to move the finish line six months away."

JAPANESE ACQUIRE MAJORITY INTEREST IN PLAZA PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japanese contracting giant Shimizu Corp. has acquired a majority interest in 
the $171-million Great American Plaza office complex under construction in 
downtown San Diego, Great American Bank announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement capped a two-year search for financing by Great American, a 
$16.4-billion savings and loan based in San Diego that will move its 
headquarters to the site when construction is completed in 1991. Shimizu Land 
Corp., the Japanese firm's American development subsidiary, will be general 
partner of the project. 
</P>
<P>
The entire Great American Plaza project will consist of a 34-story, 
650,000-square-foot office tower and a 272-room Guest Quarter Suite Hotel. The 
plaza will also include the Transportation Galleria, a fully enclosed station 
for the San Diego Trolley, which will slice diagonally through the 3-acre site. 
The project will also have 22,400 square feet of retail and restaurant space. 
</P>
<P>
Shimizu and Great American will be partners in all components of the project 
except the hotel, which will be owned and developed by Starboard Development 
Corp. of San Diego, which helped put together the development package. Hotel 
financing has yet to be secured. 
</P>
<P>
The developers have also received a $156-million construction loan from 
Mitsubishi Trust &amp; Banking Corp. and Dai-Ichi Kangyo, two of Japan's 
largest banks. 
</P>
<P>
Shimizu, which booked $10 billion in worldwide revenues last year, already has 
an ownership interest in one other San Diego project, the $150-million Aventine 
office-hotel-restaurant complex under construction in La Jolla. Shimizu also 
has invested in commercial projects in Atlanta, Hawaii, Los Angeles, Phoenix 
and Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"We started a worldwide search for a quality partner more than a year and a 
half ago," said Marc W. Sandstrom, a Great American senior executive vice 
president. "But nothing was finalized until last week." 
</P>
<P>
Reports had circulated for weeks that Shimizu was to become an investor in the 
project, which is across Kettner Boulevard from the Santa Fe train depot. 
Sandstrom declined to specify how much cash Shimizu is contributing to the 
development, but did say that, "as the general partner, they are making a 
substantial commitment." 
</P>
<P>
Brian T. Galligan, real estate development manager for Shimizu's Los 
Angeles-based construction and development subsidiaries, said the company sees 
"a bright future for the San Diego area and believes that there are many great 
investment opportunities there." 
</P>
<P>
Galligan said Shimizu's investment strategy differs slightly from that of other 
Japanese companies that have shown a voracious appetite for existing "trophy" 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
"We have never just acquired an existing project," he said. "Most of our 
investments are driven by construction opportunities. Instead of just buying a 
trophy project, we're building them." 
</P>
<P>
Sandstrom said Great American's objectives at the outset of the project were to 
construct a fixture that would develop value for its shareholders and to avoid 
committing a substantial amount of its own financial resources. 
</P>
<P>
"We never had any intention of financing this project by ourselves," Sandstrom 
said. "Great American's primary business is residential lending, not financing 
office towers. We didn't want to have a major commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Although financing had not been secured, ground breaking and excavation for the 
underground garage began in May because the developers have promised the 
Metropolitan Transit Development Board to have trolley tracks cross the site by 
June, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The transit board, the public agency that operates the trolley system, is in 
the midst of expanding its system by adding a "bayside loop" that will go 
through the Great American Plaza and provide service to the new San Diego 
Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
Sandstrom said Great American provided funds for the excavation, which was 
completed about a month ago, under the condition that it be reimbursed when a 
complete financing package was secured. No other construction work has been 
started.

Clothestime Inc.: The Anaheim-based clothing retailer said third-quarter net 
income more than tripled, while sales advanced 9.5% to $48.8 million. Profit 
totaled $2.3 million, compared to $633,000 in the same period a year ago. The 
firm said sales in the quarter continued strong, with comparable store sales 
rising 11% and a year-to-date increase of 15%. Comparable store sales have 
increased in four consecutive quarters, starting with the fourth quarter of 
fiscal 1988.

RECORD EARNINGS, REVENUE MAKE '89 MAGIC FOR DISNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Boosted by Bambi, four shrunken children and a crush of amusement park 
visitors, Walt Disney Co. on Thursday reported record revenue and net income 
for the three months and the fiscal year ended Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Disney Chairman and Chief Executive Michael D. Eisner and President Frank G. 
Wells attributed the Burbank company's performance to "outstanding results" 
from all of Disney's business segments: theme parks and resorts, filmed 
entertainment and consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-quarter net income rose 56% to $212.7 million and revenue increased 33% 
to $1.35 billion. Net income for the fiscal year reached $703.3 million, up 
35%, on revenue of $4.6 billion, up 34%. 
</P>
<P>
Pretax operating income jumped 62% to $373.1 million for the quarter and 39% to 
$1.2 billion for the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street was not surprised by the record results, said Paul C. Marsh, an 
analyst with Batemen Eichler, Hill Richards, a brokerage in Los Angeles. "Now 
we're all sharpening our pencils for the next year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was some concern in the initial part of the year that 'Honey, I Shrunk 
the Kids' and 'Dead Poets Society' would not measure up to the previous year's 
slate of films," Marsh said. "The fact is, those films did quite well." 
</P>
<P>
"Honey" and "Dead Poets" have grossed more than $127 million and $93 million, 
respectively, at the U.S. box office so far this year. The company's "Turner 
and Hooch" has also performed well, grossing more than $68 million through last 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's theme parks "have had a gang-buster year" and the company's video 
release of "Bambi" and "Cinderella" was "a prudent marketing ploy and a prudent 
accounting ploy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's retail store sales total about $1,100 per square foot -- about four 
times the industry average -- compared to $850 per square foot earlier this 
year, Marsh said. The company expects to operate 41 Disney Stores at the end of 
the calendar year, up from 13 at the end of 1988, a spokesman for the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Disney's theme parks and resorts recorded a 44% increase in operating income to 
$240.9 million for the fourth quarter. Revenue rose 25% to $775.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
The filmed entertainment segment had fourth-quarter operating income of $85.9 
million, nearly three times the previous year's total. Revenue was up 49% to 
$462.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
The consumer products segment earned $46.3 million, up 38%, on revenue of 
$107.3 million, up 27%.

STATE ALLEGES FRAUD IN SUING UNITED EDUCATION; 
</P>
<P>
CONSUMERS: THE SUIT CLAIMS THAT A UNIT OF THE COMPANY MISLED STUDENTS IN ADS 
AND OFFERED SHODDY EDUCATION. THE ENCINO FIRM HAD NO COMMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp has slapped United Education &amp; 
Software with a $24-million lawsuit that says one of the institutions run by 
the Encino-based trade school operator misled its students and provided shoddy 
education. 
</P>
<P>
The consumer protection action, filed Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court, 
seeks $22 million in restitution, a $2-million fine and an injunction against 
National Technical Schools, a Los Angeles computer mail-order school run by 
United Education &amp; Software. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint says National Technical Schools violated state advertising laws 
by falsely claiming that graduates of its program would qualify for entry-level 
computer jobs, that student loans wouldn't have to be repaid until the 
graduates obtained jobs, that the school's dropout rate was far below the 
actual dropout rate of up to 91% and that students would receive a free 
computer. It also said students were promised prompt assistance by dialing a 
toll-free number but that calls were often returned days or weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Van de Kamp blasted the school for preying on 
low-income students and victimizing taxpayers who ultimately pay for 
government-guaranteed student loans that go into default. "This flagrant abuse 
of the government-guaranteed student loan program must end immediately, and 
full restitution must be paid," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A United Education &amp; Software spokesman said the company would not comment 
on the attorney general's action until its lawyers finish studying the suit. 
United Education &amp; Software's president and chief executive, Aaron Cohen, 
is also named as a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Smilowitz, deputy attorney general, said the state would immediately seek 
a temporary injunction against National Technical Schools, preventing the 
school from continuing its "misrepresentative practices" until the suit goes to 
trial. The $22 million in restitution sought by the state would cover all loans 
taken out by the 9,800 students who enrolled in the school since August, 1987. 
The money would be repaid to students, lenders and agencies that guaranteed the 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
Smilowitz declined to say whether any of United Education &amp; Software's 25 
other schools were under investigation. But, he said, "We are looking at the 
(United Education &amp; Software) enterprise as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
The complaint is the latest setback for the troubled trade school operator. A 
U.S. Department of Education audit released last month found that students 
attending National Technical Schools from August, 1987, to November, 1988, 
didn't qualify for government-guaranteed loans because the school didn't meet 
minimum federal standards. 
</P>
<P>
The audit said courses at National Technical Schools were too short, the school 
didn't make proper refunds on loans after students dropped out, students who 
were academically unprepared were admitted and costs were misrepresented. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the audit, the California Student Aid Commission, the state 
agency that administers the federal student loan program, banned National 
Technical Schools from receiving new federal loan money. The U.S. District 
Court in Los Angeles has since granted a temporary restraining order to United 
Education &amp; Software, preventing the state agency from implementing the ban 
until a hearing is held Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
The company last week said it and a Minnesota student loan agency, the Higher 
Education Assistance Foundation, agreed to suspend any legal action against 
each other until the Department of Education makes a final decision about 
whether National Technical Schools should continue to be eligible for the 
student loan program. 
</P>
<P>
United Education &amp; Software is also embroiled in a lawsuit stemming from 
problems uncovered last year at its former student loan processing subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
A federal probe found widespread bungling at the loan processing unit, 
including failure to notify delinquent borrowers. Bank of America said that it 
and several other banks that backed the loans could lose as much as $650 
million because the federal government said it would not honor the loans. The 
banks have since sued Bank of America, which was the trustee for the loans, and 
United Education &amp; Software was named as a third-party defendant.

SILO TO BUY 26 FEDERATED UNITS IN SOUTHLAND

Atari Corp., the Sunnyvale computer and video game maker, confirmed Thursday 
that it has reached a tentative agreement to sell 26 of its ailing Federated 
Group consumer electronics stores to Silo Inc., a nationwide electronics 
retailer. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the deal, expected to close within months, were not revealed. 
</P>
<P>
The tentative agreement calls for Silo, a Philadelphia-based subsidiary of the 
British retailing giant Dixons, to take over 21 Federated stores in Los Angeles 
and Orange counties and five in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Silo already operates 10 stores in San Diego and was known to be shopping for 
an opportunity to expand farther north. 
</P>
<P>
Atari officials said discussions with potential buyers for the remaining 14 
Federated outlets in Texas, Arizona and Kansas are continuing. However, they 
declined to offer details. Earlier this week, a company official confirmed that 
Atari was discussing the possibility of selling those outlets to Fretter's, a 
Detroit-based operator of 52 consumer electronics stores throughout the 
Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
Silo and Fretter's executives have been unavailable for comment on the talks 
with Atari. 
</P>
<P>
The deal with Silo would bring renewed vigor to the already intensely 
competitive and price-sensitive Southern California consumer electronics 
market. 
</P>
<P>
This market, which for the past several years has been dominated by Adray's and 
Circuit City, is considered among the best in the nation because of its size, 
persistent economic vitality and seemingly insatiable appetite for electronic 
gadgets. 
</P>
<P>
The deal also represents an opportunity for Atari to begin putting its 
ill-timed and ill-fated acquisition of Federated Group behind it and getting on 
with its primary businesses, making personal computers and video game systems. 
</P>
<P>
Atari bought the Federated chain, which then had 91 outlets, in August, 1987, 
for $67.3 million. But within months of the acquisition, the operation soured 
and Atari was beset with losses. Last March, after announcing a loss of nearly 
$85 million because of the continuing poor performance of the retailing unit, 
Atari put Federated up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts have said Federated was the victim of its own poor marketing efforts, 
aggressive price cutting by competitors and a continuing dearth of new 
electronic products to lure customers. 
</P>
<P>
When Atari bought the chain, its chairman, Jack Tramiel, said the purchase was 
designed to build the company into an international electronics company that 
would sell everything from computer chips to finished goods. 
</P>
<P>
However, within a year of the purchase, Atari sued Wilfred Schwartz, the 
founder and former chairman of Federated, and several of its financial advisers 
for overstating the company's assets. Atari claimed that it would not have 
bought the chain if it had known its true financial condition.

TOKYO DESIGNERS ENVISION 500-STORY TOWER

<P>
A construction company said Thursday that it has designed a 500-story 
skyscraper for Tokyo, although there are no immediate plans to build it. 
</P>
<P>
The designers would need 25 years and $326.2 billion to build the 
6,669-foot-tall "Aeropolis 2001," said Yasuyuki Kimura, a spokesman for 
Ohbayashi Corp. 
</P>
<P>
This includes the money necessary to reclaim a 56-square-mile island in Tokyo 
Bay, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The project was made possible by Japan's advanced techniques to protect 
buildings in earthquakes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The tallest building in earthquake-prone Japan is Tokyo's 60-story Sunshine 
City Building. The 110-story Sears Tower in Chicago is the world's tallest 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Yukihisa Tokunaga, a city planning official of the Construction Ministry, said 
the 500-story building is one of a number of private plans by major 
construction firms to meet Tokyo's growing need for office and apartment space. 
</P>
<P>
The Ohbayashi building would be able to accommodate 300,000 people. Aside from 
office space and residential units, it also would have space for hotels, 
hospitals, parks and convention centers. 
</P>
<P>
The design envisions elevators that would reach the top floor in 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The building is shaped like a triangle, becoming smaller at the top to help it 
absorb shock waves. It would have a number of tunnels to let typhoon winds pass 
through rather than hitting the building with full force. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese archipelago, in the world's most active seismic zone, is hit each 
year by some 1,000 tremors strong enough to be felt. In 1923, 1946 and 1948, 
quake deaths climbed into the thousands. The Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 
leveled vast areas of Tokyo and Yokohama, killing 140,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
About 25 typhoons develop in the region annually. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, Japan developed a technique of building flexible structures 
to replace the rigid construction techniques favored for decades. 
</P>
<P>
Under the old concept, engineers built structures of up to 11 stories, using 
ferroconcrete solid pillars and walls to absorb shock and sustain the 
building's weight. The new concept called for making walls of slabs of 
reinforced concrete with several slits on the surface. Using the new method, 
Tokyo's 36-story, 482-foot-tall Kasumigaseki Building was completed in 1968.

Philip Morris to Sell Rothmans Stake: Philip Morris Cos. agreed to sell its 29% 
stake in Rothmans International Ltd. for $860 million, creating a huge profit 
for the U.S. tobacco giant and ending speculation that it might take over the 
British tobacco firm. The stake will be sold to Swiss-based Compagnie 
Financiere Richemont AG, which through its Rothmans Tobacco Holdings unit has 
offered to buy all of the shares of Rothmans International. Philip Morris said 
it expected to earn more than $450 million before taxes from the deal when it 
is completed. It paid $350 million for the stake in 1981.

Hostile Offer for DeSoto: A New York investment company, Sutton Holding Group, 
mounted a $220-million, $50-a-share hostile takeover of Des Plaines, Ill.-based 
DeSoto Inc, one of the nation's largest manufacturers of paint products. A 
Sutton Group statement released in New York said the company would begin its 
unsolicited cash tender offer "as soon as practicable, but in any event within 
five business days." It said financing for the bid already was in place with 
commitments from Paine Webber Funding Inc. and Austria's Creditanstalt bank. 
DeSoto officers could not be reached for comment.

DOW INDEX FALLS 19.67 AS BANKS SNUB RATE CUT

<P>
The stock market fell sharply Thursday on profit taking and disappointment that 
major banks did not move to lower their prime lending rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 19.67 points to close at 2,603.69, 
erasing more than two-thirds of the market's 26.23-point rise on Wednesday in a 
broad rally. 
</P>
<P>
In the broader market, declining issues led advancers, with 809 issues down and 
648 up in price. Big Board volume was a moderate 143.4 million shares, down 
sharply from 170.2 million shares Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the market surged after a trend-setting Missouri bank lowered a 
key lending rate, following signs that the Federal Reserve is sending interest 
rates lower. 
</P>
<P>
Lower interest rates stimulate the economy and make stocks relatively more 
attractive compared to fixed-income investments such as bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Economists said they expect other banks to follow Southwest Bank of St. Louis, 
which cut its prime lending rate to 10% from 10.5% on Wednesday. But no major 
banks announced cuts Thursday in their prime rates, which are tied to many 
consumer loans. 
</P>
<P>
And the Federal Reserve gave no further signs Thursday of easing its monetary 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason (for the decline in stocks) is that we are supposed to be waiting 
for major money centers to lower their prime rate, but this afternoon's drop is 
more severe than that," said Trude Latimer at Josepthal &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts also said the market fell on concerns about the economy, underscored 
by a higher-than-expected rise in the producer price index, which measures 
inflation at the wholesale level. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said Thursday that wholesale prices rose 0.4% in October, 
while analysts had expected a 0.2% rise. 
</P>
<P>
After news of the rise in the producer price index, the market opened lower and 
continued a narrow decline through the day. 
</P>
<P>
Profit taking later depressed prices further, with nearly half of the day's 
losses coming in the final hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate earnings influenced some stocks. Disney rose 1 5/8 to 124 1/2 in 
moderate trading after reporting earnings that analysts said were on the high 
end of their estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Consolidated Freightways slid 2 3/4 to 27 5/8 after it said it may report a 
loss for the fourth quarter while Weyerhaeuser slipped 5/8 to 25 5/8 after the 
company told analysts Wednesday that its operating earnings for the fourth 
quarter would be lower than third-quarter profit. 
</P>
<P>
Among technology stocks, Wang dropped 1/8 to 5 1/4 after it said it would 
eliminate about 2,000 jobs by Jan. 1, 1990. IBM rose 5/8 to 97 3/8, while 
Hewlett-Packard added 1/2 to 42 7/8, and Compaq Computer slipped 1 3/8 to 91 
3/8. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris closed unchanged at 41 5/8 in active trading. The company said it 
was selling its 29% interest in Rothmans International to a Swiss company for 
$860 million. 
</P>
<P>
Investors took aim at steel issues in late trading Thursday on the Tokyo Stock 
Exchange, propelling the key market barometer to its second straight rise in 
moderate trading. The Nikkei 225-share index closed up 61.83 points to 
35,657.42. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices finished lower on London's stock exchange as prices retreated in 
the afternoon. The Financial Times 100-share index fell 2.1 points to 2,201.7. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices finished slightly lower in moderate trading. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond slipped 1/8 point, or $1.25 for 
every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, advanced 
to 7.89% from 7.87% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said bond prices were tipped lower by traders' disappointment in 
Thursday's auction by the Treasury of $10 billion in three-year notes and by 
the Federal Reserve's action in draining some reserves from the market. 
</P>
<P>
The average yield of the notes at auction was 7.77%, down from 7.93% at the 
last comparable auction on Aug. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Although the yield was the lowest since early 1988, "It was a mild 
disappointment," said William Sullivan, director of money-market research at 
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted late in the day at 8.375%, unchanged from late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose against most major currencies except the Japanese yen and 
Canadian dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices fell. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid for gold at 4 
p.m. EST of $386.30 an ounce, down from $387.50 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the dollar had little reaction to a larger-than-expected 0.4% rise 
in U.S. wholesale prices in October. 
</P>
<P>
"You saw most of the market react rather subdued to the PPI report," said David 
Ethridge, vice president of foreign exchange at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. 
"It wasn't a shock." 
</P>
<P>
Currency traders said the dollar remained strong despite the market's 
perception that the Federal Reserve is relaxing its credit policy, which likely 
would encourage lower interest rates. Falling interest rates usually depress 
the dollar's value. 
</P>
<P>
The key factor was selling between other currencies that pushed down the dollar 
compared to the Japanese yen, said Keith Raphael, an assistant vice president 
at Bank Brussels Lambert in New York. 
</P>
<P>
He said the yen rose against the West German mark and also gained ground 
against the dollar in the morning. The selloff ran out of steam when the dollar 
hit 142.25 yen and traders bought dollars in an afternoon rally, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 142.70 Japanese yen, down 0.27 yen from 
Wednesday's close. Later in London, the dollar rose to 142.85 yen. In New York, 
the dollar closed at 143.13, down from 143.18 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Raphael said the dollar rose against the British pound because the Bank of 
England expressed concern that pressure to increase wages could lead to a 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British pound edged up to $1.5863 from $1.5860 late Wednesday. 
Later in New York, the pound fetched $1.5823, less than $1.5885 late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Copper prices continued their surge on New York's Commodity Exchange amid 
investors' concerns over labor conditions in Chile. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, grain was mostly lower and soybeans higher; energy and sugar 
futures were higher; gold was off while silver gained, and livestock and pork 
futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Copper settled 0.70 cent to 1.35 cents higher, with the contract for delivery 
in November at $1.1640 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Miners at Chile's four largest mines have voted to strike if the government 
adopts a law that would reorganize state-owned Chile Copper Corp. The proposal 
would give members of the military government power over mine operations after 
the government leaves office and would reduce the power of unions. 
</P>
<P>
Helping to boost prices was the perception the metal had been oversold in 
recent weeks because of settlement of labor disputes in Canada and Mexico, said 
analyst Don Tierney of Stanley Bell &amp; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Expectations that Monday's report on stocks in London Metal Exchange-approved 
warehouses will show a decline also helped prices, as did prospects that 
interest rates are going down, which would increase demand, Tierney said. 
</P>
<P>
Grain futures were mostly lower and soybeans were higher in quiet trading on 
the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
Trading in corn and soybeans was subdued as investors awaited the release of 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture's latest crop report. 
</P>
<P>
The report, released after the close of trading, estimated the 1989 corn 
harvest at 7.59 billion bushels, up 54% from last year's drought-shriveled 
crop. The estimate was up 2% from prospects a month ago when the department 
estimated this year's production at 7.45 billion bushels.

SHIMIZU OF JAPAN BUYS MAJORITY STAKE IN SAN DIEGO PROJECT

Japanese contracting giant Shimizu Corp. has acquired a majority interest in 
the $171-million Great American Plaza office complex now under construction in 
downtown San Diego, Great American Bank announced. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's announcement capped a two-year search for financing by Great 
American, a $16.4-billion savings and loan based in San Diego that will move 
its headquarters to the site upon completion in 1991. Shimizu Land Corp., the 
Japanese firm's American development subsidiary, will be general partner of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
The entire Great American Plaza project will ultimately consist of a 34-story, 
650,000-square-foot office tower and a 272-room Guest Quarter Suite Hotel. The 
project will also have 22,400 square feet of retail and restaurant space. 
</P>
<P>
Shimizu and Great American will be partners in all components of the project 
except the hotel, which will be owned and developed by Starboard Development 
Corp. of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Shimizu, which had $10 billion in worldwide revenue last year, already has an 
ownership interest in one other San Diego project, the $150-million Aventine 
office-hotel-restaurant complex under construction near San Diego in La Jolla.

REGAN URGES A BAN ON PROGRAM TRADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Former White House chief of staff and Wall Street veteran Donald T. Regan said 
Thursday that computer-driven program trading is undermining the foundations of 
the economy and should be banned or severely curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
Program traders take advantage of fleeting and minute price differences between 
underlying stocks and contracts to buy them in the future and Regan said the 
high-return, risk-free trades were undermining the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"I think both index arbitrage (a form of program trading) and stock market 
futures should be banned or severely curtailed," Regan told a House 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Program trading, blamed for worsening the October, 1987, crash, returned to 
haunt Wall Street last month when critics said it accelerated a stock market 
downturn into a full-blown free fall. 
</P>
<P>
Large investment houses, many of which say they have stopped program trades, 
industry leaders and small shareholders alike have since called for an end to 
programs, guided by computers that spot tiny, but lucrative, profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
Regan, who also served as Treasury secretary under President Ronald Reagan, 
made it clear that index arbitrage and stock market futures were terrifying the 
small investor who was increasingly leaving the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
"Individuals are threatened and concerned by the violent ups and downs, so much 
so they are no longer investors or have cut the portion of their investments 
devoted to stocks," said Regan. 
</P>
<P>
He was among a panel of Wall Street experts testifying before a House 
subcommittee that is considering legislation that would allow the Securities 
and Exchange Commission to halt program trades during volatile markets. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC presently has the power to clamp down on program trades only when the 
market seems out of control. 
</P>
<P>
Regan said control rested presently with big players, saying markets were more 
and more in the hands of large institutions and security dealers. 
</P>
<P>
"At the rate we're going, institutions will soon own 80% to 90% of all common 
stocks. I don't think that is a healthy situation for the American economy," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We, in part, are turning our backs on one of the pillars of American economy, 
our stock market," said Regan, who headed Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. before 
joining the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Regan recommended that at the very least, stringent stock market rules should 
be applied to stock index futures.

ON FOUR DISPUTED TRANSACTIONS.

<P>
Beleaguered Arizona businessman Charles H. Keating Jr. won the right Thursday 
to a court hearing here on a portion of his claim that federal thrift 
regulators illegally seized control of his Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in April. 
</P>
<P>
Declining to rule on a government motion to throw out Keating's challenge to 
the takeover, U.S. District Court Judge Stanley Sporkin said he would take 
testimony on four disputed transactions, including the controversial 
tax-sharing plan that is the basis for the civil racketeering suit that 
regulators have filed against Keating and others. 
</P>
<P>
The judge will also hear testimony from Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co., 
accountants for the government, and the former Arthur Young &amp; Co., 
accountants for American Continental. Leventhal's review of 15 Lincoln 
transactions led it to accuse American Continental and Arthur Young, now Ernst 
&amp; Young, of "accounting gimmickry" that created profits where none existed. 
</P>
<P>
Sporkin's action gives Keating his first day in court on the merits of the 
Federal Home Loan Bank Board's rationale for seizing Irvine-based Lincoln on 
April 14, a day after its parent, American Continental Corp., filed for 
bankruptcy protection. Keating challenged the government's action in a lawsuit 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
The judge's decision was greeted positively by both sides. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a chance for a fair hearing," said Robert K. Huffman, a Washington 
lawyer for American Continental. "It's no secret that the company thinks the 
Gonzalez hearings are not fair," he said, referring to the ongoing House 
Banking Committee hearings chaired by U.S. Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Texas) 
into Lincoln's failure. 
</P>
<P>
"The judge wants to test whether the facts in the administrative record are 
accurate," said James P. Murphy, a Washington lawyer for the Office of Thrift 
Supervision, the successor agency to the bank board. "We are confident they 
are, and we welcome a chance to prove them." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers in the case said it was unclear whether the judge would make a ruling 
on the legality of the seizure after the hearing on the limited issues. 
</P>
<P>
To seize an institution, regulators must have one of three grounds: insolvency, 
substantial dissipation of assets caused by violations of regulations or 
operating conditions that are unsafe or unsound to transact business. 
</P>
<P>
The bank board did not allege insolvency, but did allege the other two grounds. 
On Aug. 2, the board determined that Lincoln was insolvent and put it in 
receivership. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental claims that the statutory grounds never existed for either 
the conservatorship or the receivership. 
</P>
<P>
Sporkin allowed the Office of Thrift Supervision to pick the four transactions 
for the hearing, which begins Dec. 6. Murphy said he picked the tax-sharing 
plan, a Memorex stock transaction and two deals involving Hidden Valley Ranch, 
an 8,500-acre planned community 35 miles southwest of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Under the tax-sharing plan, Lincoln forwarded $95 million in taxes to American 
Continental to pay on a consolidated basis, but regulators claim that Lincoln 
didn't owe any taxes and the company didn't pay any on Lincoln's behalf. In the 
racketeering suit, regulators allege Lincoln lost $125 million under the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators also claim that American Continental took a gain on Memorex stock 
that should have gone to Lincoln. Lincoln bought the stock and sold it to a 
third party for $1 million. The third party sold it to American Continental 
four months later for $2 million. Six months later, the company sold the stock 
for $13.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
In 10 Hidden Valley transactions, including the two Sporkin will hear, 
regulators allege that Lincoln used straw buyers and straw borrowers to boost 
profits artificially and hide the true control of the property.

REVIEWING PERILS OF A 'ME-FIRST' UPBRINGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re: " 'Me-first' kids" (by Barbara Bronson Gray, Oct. 31). 
</P>
<P>
What did child psychologists expect? Their trendy behavioral theories and 
social tinkerings created more problems than they ever solved. Permissiveness 
was "in," discipline was "out," and family authority was cast aside after 
serving for centuries as stabilizing, civilizing centers of society. 
</P>
<P>
The "me generation" was encouraged to be defiant, to reject traditional values 
and to identify themselves as "the center of the universe." Then they were 
urged to "do their own thing." When they did -- the consequences lie shattered 
around us. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of standing on the sidelines criticizing kids' behavior today -- as 
Stanford psychologist Carl Thoresen does, while he blames the situation on 
television and spins even more theories about what it all means -- he and the 
rest of his profession should admit responsibility for their part of the mess 
and do their best to recapture common sense and restore respect for the family 
structure.

HELPING KIDS HANDLE 'DAY-CARE DILEMMA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a point in the excellent article "Day-Care Dilemma" that needs some 
clarification. Providing quality care for our nation's future decision-makers 
is certainly an area of utmost concern and a complex problem. 
</P>
<P>
However, we are not fortunate enough to be experiencing a dropping birth rate, 
as suggested by Audre Engelman of the Women Lawyers' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the "echo-boom" and other mitigating factors, Los Angeles County, 
for example, has gained three times as many people during the 1980s as during 
the 1970s, an average of 120,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
This growth is attributable, first, to an increase in births, and only second 
to new immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Result? The sheer numbers mean there is vastly increased pressure on an already 
fragile system of child care . . . and vastly increased pressure on an already 
fragile planetary environment. 
</P>
<P>
Prognosis? The future is hanging in the balance as we dare to face the 
potential significance of universally considering a small-family goal.

'THE LITTLE-KNOWN KILLER' IS FAMILIAR TO SOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Traditionally, the medical management of women's health has left something to 
be desired. Compared to the care and consideration given men, women have had to 
take a back seat in health care. 
</P>
<P>
The "little-known" killer of women referred to in your article was well-known 
throughout the decades. Women, however, have been treated like children by our 
esteemed medical practitioners. Even today, a woman patient is addressed by her 
first name when meeting a new physician in a medical setting. 
</P>
<P>
The medication available to alleviate the symptoms of menopause has the adverse 
effect of bringing on hypertension. I am referring to hormone replacement 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
While Monroe mentioned the role of menopause in women's heart disease, she said 
nothing about hysterectomies and oophorectomies and how the body goes into 
shock and stress after this devastating surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Studies are finally coming out that show that the uterus has more than just the 
function associated with reproduction. It may very well be an endocrinological 
organ necessary to women's health because it secretes additional hormones.

HELPING KIDS HANDLE 'DAY-CARE DILEMMA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article "Day Care Dilemma" (by Beverly Beyette, Nov. 1) was well 
researched and written but failed to appreciate the effect upon children of 
ever-changing care-givers. These are the nannies, housekeepers, baby-sitters 
and child care center workers who often do establish an excellent relationship 
with the child. 
</P>
<P>
However, for various reasons, these care-givers come and go. 
</P>
<P>
When they leave, children (particularly infants and toddlers) suffer a serious 
sense of loss and may frequently feel abandoned. The child may worry that the 
parents will also disappear. 
</P>
<P>
Evening and weekend "quality time" with working parents cannot compensate for 
the distress caused by these unpredictable separations. When these separations 
from changing care-givers occur repeatedly, the infant and toddler can become 
emotionally scarred. These children may find it difficult to ever learn to 
trust any adult. 
</P>
<P>
There is a simple, although unpopular, remedy: Parents should raise their own 
children -- particularly in the infant and preschool years. They will provide 
the continual and consistent attachment figure that is so important. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, I know this proposal sounds economically impractical in this era of 
consumerism and high mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
But it is during these formative years that the child's secure emotional base 
is established. To the child, such security in the early years is far more 
important than building equity in a multibedroom home. 
</P>
<P>
Our federal government should allow parents liberal tax credits or economic 
assistance to stay home and care for their own children. 
</P>
<P>
I certainly agree with your article that the quality of child care should be 
improved. But the best child care usually is that provided by the parent who 
stays home, creating a continual and a secure base.

RED ARMY SINGS, DANCES WAY TO GLASNOST VICTORY 
</P>

<P>
From the moment the Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble moved onto the Sports 
Arena stage Wednesday night to sing a rousing rendition of "The Star Spangled 
Banner," it was glasnost all the way. The audience was on its feet and cheering 
even before the last strains of the national anthem reverberated across the 
cavernous arena. 
</P>
<P>
Gargantuan-sized flags (Old Glory and the Soviet Union's hammer-and-sickle) 
hung side-by-side in the background throughout the performance, creating a 
visual equivalent of the friendship and harmony theme being played out on 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the highly polished razzle-dazzle -- a pastiche of ethnic 
expressions packaged in Vegas-style glitz -- that had more than 7,000 local 
aficionados shouting for more when the lengthy performance ended with "God 
Bless America." And they got it -- an encore with the whole company on stage 
for the fond farewell. 
</P>
<P>
The most dazzling dancing of the evening wore the trappings and trademarks of 
traditional Soviet folk dance -- flamboyant spread-eagle leaps, high-speed 
spins, squatting kicks, and other punishing bent-leg maneuvers, the likes of 
which are sometimes attempted but rarely duplicated in America. But, although 
flavored by show-biz shticks, this was authentic ethnic dancing from the 
battalion of men and women almost 200 strong. 
</P>
<P>
The men in the troupe attacked all the dances with zest and never failed to 
deliver the goods, much to the delight of the responsive audience. At times, 
the makeshift stage (which spanned the width of the Sports Arena) seemed too 
small to contain them as they spun and jumped through their vigorous motions. 
</P>
<P>
The women were no less capable than their male counterparts, although most of 
them danced a more subdued style. And, when they paired off with the men, the 
whole ensemble displayed the clockwork precision of a crack drill team. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the offerings on this happy hodgepodge emanated from their homeland. 
Stuffed into the variety show format were songs as diverse as "Granada" and "I 
Got Plenty of Nothin'," both sung with gusto by a splendid bass soloist, Barseg 
Tumanyan (and added, no doubt, for the benefit of American audiences on this 
first U.S. tour). 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the singing from the Red Army's extraordinary male chorus (close to 
100 well-matched voices) was every bit as impressive as the dancing. And, when 
the singers broke into the rollicking "Kalinka," the crowd could not resist 
clapping along. 
</P>
<P>
The fine musicians in the company played ancient folk instruments, such as the 
balalaika (a guitar-like instrument) and the bayan (a Russian accordion), as 
well as familiar modern instruments, and their musicianship was as flawless as 
the singing. 
</P>
<P>
The 61-year-old troupe was formed to entertain the Soviet troops in the front 
lines, and the singers and musicians still wear army uniforms while they 
perform. But the only show of martial arts in the performance was the thrilling 
saber dancing in the Cossack cavalry number. 
</P>
<P>
For this colorful spectacle, the men donned red Cossack coats and black boots, 
charging across the stage like lightning, their steel blades crisscrossing in 
mock combat. The dance was a spectacular showcase for the squatting 
pyrotechnics these performers do so well. 
</P>
<P>
The finale, "Dance of the Elbe Meeting," pitted American and Soviet World War 
II soldiers against each other -- but only in their dance forms. It was another 
solid show of glasnost, and it had the audience leaping to its feet in a loud 
chorus of bravos. 
</P>
<P>
If the Red Army came to town to capture American hearts, it did not leave 
empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
Before the show, a few dozen Armenians protesting Soviet repression in their 
homeland and several members of the arch-conservative Young Americans for 
Freedom passed out leaflets and chanted anti-Soviet slogans at the Sports Arena 
entrance. The demonstration did not interfere with the curtain time as a 
similar demonstration did at the troupe's Los Angeles debut last week.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: FOR TV, CRIME IS DRUG OF CHOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Crime continues to pay -- if not always for perpetrators, at least for the 
television industry. 
</P>
<P>
From local newscasts to grimy tabloid series to prime-time docudramas, crime 
stories have become a drug on which TV gets high. TV snorts crime the way an 
addict snorts white powder, ensuring that every sensational case will 
ultimately find its way to TV, and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
No surprise, then, that Sunday's 9-11 p.m. time slot pits California's "Night 
Stalker" against Oregon's Mother Who Shot Her Three Children. 
</P>
<P>
Creatively it's no contest. Given the enormous profile and hair-trigger 
timeliness of its subject, NBC's "Manhunt: Search for the Night Stalker" 
(Channels 4, 36 and 39) may turn the most heads. But ABC's two-part "Small 
Sacrifices" (Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42) is the one to watch -- simply because 
it's overwhelmingly superior both as entertainment and as an expose of the 
sociopathic mind. Part 2 of this stunning crime story airs at 9 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of NBC's movie, recently convicted "Night Stalker" Richard 
Ramirez remains a creature of the shadows, nearly as obscured from public view 
as he was when he carried out the serial killings that have brought him a death 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
On one level you appreciate a sober and relatively straightforward 
serial-murder biography like "Manhunt," which seems infinitely more honest than 
last season's "Hillside Strangler" movie on NBC. If TV is indeed to be the 
nation's ultimate criminal archive, however, then we should demand something 
more of these stories than mere regurgitation of the public record. TV 
newscasts and newspapers did that in closely following the "Night Stalker" 
story as it unfolded. So beyond ratings, what's the point of the movie? 
</P>
<P>
Something more -- much, much more -- is exactly what "Small Sacrifices" does 
give us in presenting a fascinating criminal character study without altering 
basic facts. 
</P>
<P>
Guided by Ann Rule's mesmerizing book of the same title, director David Greene 
and scriptwriter Joyce Eliason have shaped "Small Sacrifices" into a 
heartbreaking, transfixing, harrowing psychological thriller that's less 
whodunit than whydunit as it strips back the layers of a disturbingly bizarre 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
It begins on the night of May 19, 1983, when Diane Downs (Farrah Fawcett) 
arrives at a Springfield, Ore., hospital with her three critically wounded 
children, claiming they were shot on the road by a bushy-haired stranger who 
had demanded her car. She too has been wounded, in the arm. 
</P>
<P>
Almost from the beginning, the pieces don't fit, and Diane Downs and the 
shootings (two of the children survive, but her toddler son is paralyzed and 
her eldest daughter is physically and emotionally maimed) fuse into a single 
mystery. It seems obvious that Downs herself did the shooting -- that beneath 
her professed concern for her children and sometimes demure exterior lurks a 
calculating destroyer, a demon incapable of true love or compassion. As one 
detective observes: "She's weird, the woman is really weird." 
</P>
<P>
Lethally weird, as Asst. Dist. Atty. Frank Joziak (John Shea) and Detective 
Doug Welch (Gordon Clapp) learn during the tortuous process of looking for the 
murder weapon and building a case against Downs as she taunts authorities and 
bewilders them with her erratic behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"Small Sacrifices" features gleaming performances by Fawcett, Shea and Emily 
Perkins as the eldest daughter, Karen (not her real name). 
</P>
<P>
Even when she's soft, there's a revealing hardness in the eyes of Fawcett's 
nerve-jangling Diane, a narcissistic, manipulative, dominant personality. 
Fawcett superbly captures the enigma: Diane is at once drawn toward and 
contemptuous of men. She needs to have a baby in her belly, yet feels nothing 
for her children. She seems so vulnerable, yet seconds later is utterly 
vicious. Although she is brilliant, there are curious gaps in her intelligence, 
blind spots that narrow her perceptions and ultimately betray her. 
</P>
<P>
Shea's relentless, methodical Joziak (Fred Hugi is his real name) is 
meticulously measured, outwardly stolid, yet inwardly seething, so emotionally 
swept up in the case and paternalistic toward Karen that he becomes, in effect, 
her surrogate father. 
</P>
<P>
Perkins is breathtaking -- and beautifully directed by Greene in scenes where 
the traumatized Karen probes her mind's inner regions to confront the horrible 
reality of her mother's actions. Her testimony in court is devastating. 
</P>
<P>
Occasional minor shadings of truth for dramatic effect fleetingly move "Small 
Sacrifices" onto far-fetched turf, and the story dramatically slows at the 
beginning of Part 2. But then it's on to knockout courtroom sequences that have 
you on the edge of your seat. 
</P>
<P>
Even from her prison cell, the real Downs has continued to blame the 
"bushy-haired stranger," a view forcefully espoused in her own book on the 
subject. Her two surviving children were ultimately adopted by Hugi and his 
wife. Although he's portrayed as heroic, Hugi has publicly denounced the TV 
story as being "fictional" and damaging to the children. 
</P>
<P>
That came as a surprise to Rule, because the TV version is generally faithful 
to her book, which Hugi never criticized, the author said by phone from her 
Seattle home. She added that she was pleased with ABC's treatment. 
</P>
<P>
However, the question of the TV program's potential impact on the children 
cannot be easily dismissed. Once victimized by their mother, are they now being 
victimized a second time by television in behalf of rating points? 
</P>
<P>
Rule said she understands the concern. "It's valid, but the book and the 
miniseries portray (Karen) as the hero. I'm sure the children have accepted 
what has happened and have talked about it with their friends. After all, this 
is not new." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the uneasiness lingers. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, little more than emptiness lingers after "Manhunt," which views 
the "Night Stalker" case through the eyes of Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
detectives Frank Salerno (Richard Jordan) and Gil Carrillo (A Martinez). 
Meanwhile, there is a parallel investigation by a TV reporter (Lisa Eilbacher), 
a composite character who faces a moral and ethical dilemma over whether to 
report information that could compromise the police investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Seth Green directs suspensefully, and although Joe Gunn's script somewhat 
awkwardly weaves Salerno's and Carrillo's personal lives into the story, it 
seems free of the hyperbole that typifies so many crime docudramas. 
(Ironically, this movie parenthetically credits Salerno and Carrillo with 
achievements in the "Hillside Strangler" investigation that were credited to 
another detective in that earlier NBC movie on the infamous strangler murders.) 
</P>
<P>
All right, the "Night Stalker" is pursued, caught, tried and convicted. When 
the story ends, however, you have learned essentially nothing, and you feel 
nothing except the same compassion for the victims and hatred for Ramirez 
(Gregory Norman Cruz) that you felt before the movie. So again, what is the 
point?

A CHARMING NIGHT WITH MRS. LLOYD WEBBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andrew Lloyd Webber's music gives some people goose-bumps and other people the 
creeps. I liked his work through "Cats" and started to hate it with "Starlight 
Express." A chance to hear his theater scores as a continuum couldn't be passed 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for attending "The Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber in Concert" 
Wednesday night at the Orange County Performing Arts Center was to see Sarah 
Brightman. She is married to Lloyd Webber and played Christine in the original 
"Phantom of the Opera." She also had sung the big soprano role in Lloyd 
Webber's only classical work to date, his 1985 Requiem. She would present an 
authoritative case for her husband's songs. 
</P>
<P>
She did. Brightman's vocal range may be wider than her emotional range, but 
within her limits she's a charming musical actress. Her "Everything's All 
Right" from "Jesus Christ Superstar," for example, was simple, as opposed to 
dumb, and sweet, as opposed to cloying. It even swung, in its quiet way. 
</P>
<P>
Brightman did not make the songs from "Song and Dance" sound any more 
perfunctory than they are, but she did make us see its heroine, Emma -- a 
practical girl writing home to her Mum from such outlandish places as Beverly 
Hills and "Costa Mesa" (pronounced like "Costa del Sol.") 
</P>
<P>
Brightman is not ready to play Evita. "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina" was sung 
with the proper drama, but we didn't get the creepy feeling that Evita had by 
now become a figment of her own imagination. Under the ball gown, we sensed 
sensible shoes. 
</P>
<P>
But "Cats" was right up Brightman's alley. Instead of plugging "Memory," as 
expected, Brightman concentrated on the tale of "Gus the Theatre Cat." She sat 
on a stool and just told it, like a kindergarten teacher at story hour. Simple 
is shrewd, sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
"Cats" profits from the evening's concert format. We think of it as a costume 
show -- the costume show. But it's wittier when performed in dinner jackets and 
cocktail dresses. Lloyd Webber's impulse in the theater is to go for the 
obvious. This sequence lightly steps back from the obvious and gave the 
audience a little something to do. 
</P>
<P>
That is the general intention of "Andrew Lloyd Webber in Concert" -- to divorce 
his scores from scenic whizbang and see what they add up to on their own. What 
is "Starlight Express" without its roller-skaters? Damn little, as Lloyd Webber 
admits by presenting only the smallest slice of it here. 
</P>
<P>
"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat" was conceived as a platform 
piece by Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice (who gets the proper lyricist's credit in 
the program, and nothing more), and its songs survives the concert hall 
treatment nicely. Here, though, the dinner jackets make it hard to see these 
folks tending sheep. Ken Ward is Joseph, pleased as the dickens at his glitzy 
new coat, or rather vest. 
</P>
<P>
Last comes "The Phantom of the Opera." The show's logo is flashed on the back 
wall, the lights turn orange (either in tribute to Halloween or Costa Mesa) and 
Michael Reed churns up his onstage orchestra like Hecate stirring supper. 
</P>
<P>
It's no go, though. Under all that storm-and-stress, "Phantom's" score emerges 
as blandly as it does at the Music Center. More so, in fact, since these 
excerpts center on poor, dear Christine, not the most vital character in the 
Lloyd Webber canon. 
</P>
<P>
Again, Brightman gives it her best shot, and Ward doesn't do badly at all as 
the Phantom in their title duet. But, divorced from its visuals, this 
presentation makes it cruelly clear how little "Phantom" has going for it 
musically, apart from its silent-movie organ chromatics. 
</P>
<P>
Which, I admit, went down as well at the Orange County Performing Arts Center 
Wednesday night as they have everywhere else. "The Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber 
in Concert" won't make converts to Lloyd Webber's cause, but it will please the 
faithful. Count me among the faithful departed. 
</P>
<P>
 Plays at 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa, Mondays through Saturdays at 8 
p.m., with matinees at 2 p.m. Sunday and Nov. 18. Closes Nov. 18 (matinee). 
Tickets $19-$40; (213) 480-3232 or (714) 740-2000.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: STAGE / NANCY CHURNIN: ARTS ENDOWMENT GRANT FOR OLD GLOBE 
SHRINKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Nancy Churnin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Endowment for the Arts, with an increasing demand for a 
diminishing supply of dollars, is beginning to look like the Incredible 
Shrinking Grant to institutions like the Old Globe Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The Old Globe, which received the largest professional theater grant the NEA 
gave to any San Diego theater in 1989, was dismayed -- but not surprised -- to 
find a reduction in its annual grant from last year's $187,500 to $180,000. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the NEA received 404 theater grant applications, 25 more than in '88, 
but had slightly less money available than in the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
"There had to be some cutting," said Ben Cameron, of the NEA's theater program. 
"We're seeing more competition than ever before. The panel didn't cut to be 
artistically punitive. They had to find the money somewhere in order to 
recognize artistic excellence in as many places as they could. That affected 
theaters with the largest grant amounts, which is anything over $100,000." 
</P>
<P>
But Thomas Hall, managing director of the Old Globe, feels his company's 
reduction does not bode well for the future of larger theaters. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an across-the-board reduction from the larger institutions and the ones 
who have been in the funding pool for a long time to allow for new institutions 
to enter the file to be funded," said Hall, who pointed out that there is an 
initiative to make a 10% across-the-board reduction for next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't begrudge the (newer) institutions," Hall said. "I think there needs to 
be money for them. But it's extremely frustrating to continue to receive 
accolades and be told there isn't enough money. Government has to show people 
that art is vitally important not only to us but to the next generation. By 
freezing and reducing when the cost of living goes up sends a message that we 
don't value art and the intrinsic value of the lessons it teaches about the 
responsibility we have to each other and the need for compassion and 
conscience." 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla Playhouse received $85,000, the same amount it has received for 
the past three years. (The grant is separate from the fund-raising campaign the 
playhouse has embarked on to raise $500,000 before Dec. 31 to ensure that there 
will be a 1990 season.) Only the San Diego Repertory Theatre, which received 
$35,000, marked an increase over the $20,000 it received last year. 
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstance, the La Jolla Playhouse is satisfied with its funding 
level, according to managing director Alan Levey: "Staying the same was really 
doing well in the context of what the NEA has been able to do." 
</P>
<P>
And the San Diego Rep is very pleased. "The NEA evaluates primarily on artistic 
merit, and we take it as a real message," said Adrian Stewart, managing 
director of the San Diego Rep. 
</P>
<P>
One of the happy individual recipients of the NEA largess was Oana-Maria Hock, 
the only San Diego playwright to receive a Playwright Fellowship Grant from the 
NEA. Hock was awarded $15,000, $2,500 of which is to be earmarked for residency 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Hock, who recently relocated to New Hampshire where her husband, Roger R. Hock, 
has a one-year teaching position at New England College, plans to return to San 
Diego next summer to do a rehearsed reading of a new play, yet to be named, at 
the La Jolla Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
The NEA endorsement of Hock's work comes, ironically, on the heels of the 
California Arts Council's criticism of her play, "The Man Who Had No Story," 
presented as part of the La Jolla Playhouse's Performance Outreach Project as 
part of the reason for slashing the La Jolla Playhouse's California Arts 
Council grant this year. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Bucharest, Romania, Hock worked as a film and theater critic before she 
moved to the United States in 1980 and decided to focus on playwrighting. She 
received a master of fine arts degree in playwrighting from UC San Diego, and 
had five of her plays produced in the last four years. Her "East European 
Tetralogy" was nominated by the San Diego Theatre Critics Circle as the best 
new play of 1986. "Berlin, Berlin," which was produced by UCSD in 1987, was 
recently presented at Brandeis University along with her play "Exchange at Cafe 
Mimosa," one of the plays read at the American Repertory Theatre last year. 
</P>
<P>
Hock's next workshop production will be at the Trinity Repertory Theatre in 
January under the guidance of the company's artistic director, former UCSD 
theater professor Anne Bogart, and now is two weeks away from completing a play 
that the UCSD drama department commissioned her to write about fellow Romanian 
Mandell Weiss, the chief benefactor of the Mandell Weiss Theatre and 
to-be-built Mandell Weiss Forum, shared by UCSD and the Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"It opens a lot of doors, and the money helped me because it allows me the time 
to research and work rather than look for a job," said Hock of the grant on the 
phone from New Hampshire. "At the moment I can just use it for writing and 
researching. I feel great." 
</P>
<P>
The first action of the coalition of arts and cultural organizations in San 
Diego (which has yet to decide on a formal name for itself) was a poll of the 
candidates for the 1st and 5th City Council districts. Although the group 
declined to endorse any candidates -- that's not its objective -- the answers 
of the two winners, Abbe Wolfsheimer of the 1st District and Linda Bernhardt of 
the 5th, showed a definite endorsement of the arts even if the two did differ 
decidedly from each other on the issue of public funding for the Soviet arts 
festival. Wolfsheimer opposed it, Bernhardt was for it. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfsheimer listed among her arts credentials: a vote against public funding to 
the Soviet arts festival (she said the money would be better spent on local 
arts organizations and artists and their funding should not be frozen for three 
years or more.); support for Installation Gallery when its transient occupancy 
tax allocation was threatened and an active role in many arts organizations 
over the past 27 years, including being a founding member and patron of the La 
Jolla Playhouse and a patron of both the Old Globe Theatre and the Gaslamp 
Quarter Theatre (where she is an honorary member of the Board of Trustees). 
</P>
<P>
Bernhardt said she supports the continuation of a tri-annual arts and cultural 
festival (like the Soviet arts festival), to be supported by private and public 
funding; depoliticizing the process of distributing transit occupancy tax money 
to art organizations; and the city's Art in Public Places program.

once he leaves office at the end of the year. Already signed to do a morning 
spot on a New York radio station, lecture on urban affairs at New York 
University and undertake a national speaking tour, hizzoner now has signed with 
New York's WCBS-TV to be a daily commentator on the station's 5 p.m. newscast 
and to co-host a Sunday-morning public-affairs program. Roger Coloff, WCBS' 
president, noted that "throughout his career, Ed Koch has never been at a loss 
for words. In this new role . . . he will continue to speak out about issues of 
interest to our viewers." Koch is slated to make his debut the week of Jan. 8,

ISO DANCE THEATRE ON KCET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Part of the Pilobolus extended family, ISO Dance Theatre cultivates an 
ingenuous (sometimes antic) looseness that makes its honed physical skills seem 
almost offhand. 
</P>
<P>
Television, however, is obviously Serious Business -- so tonight at 10 on KCET 
Channel 28, we find ISO style pretty much undercut and overwhelmed by fancy-dan 
camerawork, diversionary editing and other hyperprofessional production values. 
</P>
<P>
Videotaped locally by the KCET arts and culture unit, "Episodes" often attempts 
to change intimate, labor-intensive theater pieces into glossy, MTV-style 
spectacle. It doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
Many of ISO's choreographies develop as surprising little movement riffs based 
on physical constraint -- ankles bound together, for instance ("Psycho 
Killer"), or costumes that link hands and feet with lengths of ribbon 
("Linguini Arms"). But instead of involving the viewer in the group's 
exploration of possibilities, "Episodes" director Robert Fruchtman splinters 
continuity or introduces such pictorial distractions as location shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes (as in "Night Thoughts") you can barely see what Daniel Ezralow, 
Jamie Hampton, Ashley Roland and Morleigh Steinberg are doing for all the 
impressionistic camera motion and disorienting switches between extreme 
close-ups of body parts. And that's a shame. 
</P>
<P>
But there are signs of hope: At the very start of the abrasive "I Do" duet, 
catch the glimpse of a bedroom behind Ezralow and Steinberg -- just enough to 
provide an environmental context. We don't see it again, and there's no need. 
In contrast, we never stop looking at the pillars and floors of the Doheny 
Mansion during "Foreign Tails," and it only gets in the way. LEWIS SEGAL

BILLY HARPER QUINTET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Billy Harper, the Texas-born tenor saxophonist who opened Tuesday at Catalina 
Bar and Grill in Hollywood, is a powerful, hard-driving performer whose quintet 
places an almost unrelenting accent on energy and high tension. 
</P>
<P>
Well known for his work with Gil Evans and Art Blakey, Harper is said to have 
been inspired by Sonny Rollins. However, it was the image of John Coltrane that 
hung over the group as it made its way through a series of modally inclined 
original compositions. Although the thematic statements were brief, the 
extended solos seemed to indicate that such words as succinct and terse are not 
in these artists' vocabulary. By the time the third tune ended a full hour had 
elapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Harper's control of the horn is impressive, but when playing as many as a dozen 
notes per second, it is no easy task to relate any of them to the beat of the 
rhythm section. Thus swinging in the normal sense becomes impractical. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Henderson's trumpet, Clarence Seay's bass and the powerhouse drumming of 
Newman Taylor Baker make up a unit well geared to Harper's requirement. The 
group closes Sunday. LEONARD FEATHER

CHERYL BENTYNE COVERS WIDE RANGE AT LE CAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cheryl Bentyne perched on a high stool next to the piano, tossed back her mane 
of red hair, sighed and launched into the verse of Billy Strayhorn's "Day 
Dream." 
</P>
<P>
This laid-back mood at Le Cafe in Sherman Oaks marked the start of another of 
her occasional one-nighters away from her home base, home being Manhattan 
Transfer. More than ever before, she demonstrated her exceptional talent as a 
purveyor of a wide range of songs, from Gershwin and Ellington to Ivan Lins. 
</P>
<P>
For well over an hour Tuesday evening, she kept an intimate group of fans 
entranced as she wove her way through familiar standards and newly lyricized 
instrumentals. In the latter category were Dore Caymmi's "Love's River" and 
Michel Legrand's "Les Enfants Qui Pleurent." 
</P>
<P>
Her sound is pure, her phrasing indicative of a jazz sensitivity, with Corey 
Allen's understated but rhythmically compelling accompaniment as her sole and 
totally adequate support. At times Bentyne would offer surprising evidence of 
her considerable range, as she did in a sudden, unpredictable upward thrust 
toward the conclusion of "My Funny Valentine." 
</P>
<P>
Le Cafe could have been a New York Eastside lounge in the 1960s as she applied 
her velvet timbre to "Spring Can Really Hang You Up The Most" and "Blue 
Prelude." During the Brazilian interlude Allen switched to electric keyboard to 
supply soothing organ harmony. Later he had his own solo spot, bringing gentle 
intelligence to his treatment of "That's All." He co-wrote with Bentyne the 
brief and engaging final tune, "Good Friends." By the end of this magic set the 
French had clearly extended to everyone in her small but delighted audience.

DIEGO'S LOFT MAY CUT ITS LOSSES AND DROP JAZZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saturday night's shows by vibraphonist Gary Burton at Diego's Loft in Pacific 
Beach could mark the end of jazz at the intimate, 78-seat club. 
</P>
<P>
The owners lost more than $400 last weekend, when jazz guitarist Mundell Lowe 
played Friday and Saturday nights, co-owner Ernest Casco said. The club 
collected $264 at the door for both nights -- not nearly enough to pay the 
musicians and operating expenses, said Casco, one of three owners. 
</P>
<P>
So, for the next few weeks, Diego's Loft will be closed while the owners 
consider options. 
</P>
<P>
Casco didn't rule out jazz in the future, but he said he is also considering 
lighter jazz or non-jazz acts. He said the room is too small for many electric 
jazz bands. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday morning, the owners told San Diego jazz musician Holly Hofmann, who 
books Diego's jazz acts, that the club could afford to continue jazz only if 
the musicians would play for the door proceeds instead of a guaranteed fee, 
Hofmann said. 
</P>
<P>
"I contacted the musicians on my November and December schedule, and they said 
forget it," Hofmann said. "Nobody of that caliber is going to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Sprague, Algo Caliente, Joe Marillo, Mike Wofford, Harry Pickens and 
Jimmy and Jeannie Cheatham, all San Diegans, were among the acts Hofmann had 
tentatively lined up. 
</P>
<P>
Since opening in July 1988 as an addition to the popular Diego's Mexican 
restaurant and Club Diego's disco, the jazz room has struggled to draw 
consistent crowds, despite presenting such top players as Slide Hampton, Bill 
Watrous, Buddy Collette, Spike Robinson, James Zollar, Richie Cole, Don Menza 
and Sam Most. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been supportive, but I lost thousands and thousands of dollars," Casco 
said, adding that the owners spent about $200,000 to create the room, with a 
fireplace and excellent acoustics. 
</P>
<P>
At first the club charged no cover and had a two-drink minimum. A $5 cover was 
added last summer, and for a time that seemed to reduce attendance, but Hofmann 
said she thought the club had turned a corner in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it was not the nationally known jazz acts that drew the best 
crowds. According to Casco, the biggest-grossing performances were by the 
Cheathams and guitarist Sprague with vocalist Kevyn Lettau. 
</P>
<P>
Casco said he was bothered that the jazz players wanted to keep the room purely 
mainstream jazz, instead of mixing in lighter contemporary jazz or other music. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Hagey, director of the San Diego Jazz Festival, which co-presented Burton 
with Diego's, said he doubts that jazz players will work for the door but the 
jazz festival might present shows at its own risk there. Diego's guaranteed 
Burton's fee for Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's shows are at 8:30 and 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Without Diego's Loft, Elario's in La Jolla is the only local jazz club 
consistently booking national performers.

WALKEN HAS PURPORTED CLOSE ENCOUNTER IN 'COMMUNION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Communion" (citywide), a serious, often persuasive attempt to dramatize writer 
Whitley Strieber's purported contact with aliens, affords Christopher Walken 
his showiest role to date. 
</P>
<P>
As the life-loving, happily married Strieber, Walken is a prankish, playful 
charmer whose wife Anne (Lindsay Crouse) laughs a great deal but is in fact a 
solid, sensible type. They're smart enough to know they have it all, including 
an adored small son Andrew (Joel Carlson) and a chic Manhattan apartment. 
</P>
<P>
They also have a large, equally chic cabin in the mountains. On a weekend in 
October, 1985, Strieber, his son and another couple (Andreas Katsulas, Terri 
Hanauer) are awakened by a blinding light. In short order Strieber seems to be 
hallucinating and sinking into paranoia. A calm, dedicated parapsychologist 
(Frances Sternhagen) tries to help, but he tends to resist her. 
</P>
<P>
Under the assured, easy direction of Philippe Mora, working from Strieber's 
adaptation of his own best seller, Walken dazzles, giving us an intelligent, 
talented man caught in a nightmare and fearing for his sanity. Crouse matches 
him as a strong woman determined to put up a ferocious fight to help her 
husband and save their marriage. Mora and his stars take "Communion" far above 
standard sci-fi schlock, yet the film stumbles in its presentation of the 
aliens. 
</P>
<P>
Even those open to the possibility that Strieber did have a series of close 
encounters of the third kind with a bunch of jolly blue gnomes and some 
spindly, doe-like creatures with Keane eyes may have a problem with the 
literalness with which these aliens are presented. They seem right out of the 
pages of the National Enquirer. Clearly, Mora means to be faithful to Strieber, 
but a more ethereal approach to the non-humans might have been more effective. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, "Communion," a most handsome production, does take us on an incredible 
journey that comes full circle in satisfying fashion. And Walken and Crouse are 
terrific.

NO ANTIDOTE FOR 'TOXIC AVENGER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Troma Inc.'s no-budget scuzzball horror-comedies, like the movies listed on the 
marquee at any Pussycat Theater from week to week, can be counted on to have 
all their best creative energies invested in the title alone. "The Toxic 
Avenger III: The Last Temptation of Toxie" (selected theaters) is yet another 
case in which the agonizingly cretinous script seems to have been a bothersome 
afterthought to the brainstorming session for the name, which in this case 
promises Scorsese parody and delivers only sore-sleazy prattle. Death be quick. 
</P>
<P>
A prologue recapping the first two films reminds us that the Toxic Avenger -- a 
nerd who gained superhuman strength and homeliness in an industrial accident -- 
is "the first super-hero from New Jersey." No doubt he's also the first 
super-hero ever to reach into a squirming bad guy's guts, pull out his 
intestines and play jump-rope with them in the opening scene of a motion 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
Toxie's real battle, though, is with old Beelzebub himself, a wacky marauder 
who offers the Avenger control of Tromaland, N.J., for his complicity. The 
monstrous hero briefly falls for this devilish line and turns into an ugly, 
"babe"-spouting, power-tie-wearing yup -- an amusing idea badly bungled by 
butterfingered director/producers Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz, whose idea of 
satire is stuck somewhere between the Garbage Pail Kids and fifth-grade 
boys'-room sex jokes. 
</P>
<P>
Having the hero of the grade-Z "Toxic Avenger III" (MPAA-rated R) resist 
selling his soul to the devil is too, too ironic; based on this cynical amateur 
enterprise, Kaufman and Herz seem like the sort of junior auteurs who would 
gladly gift-wrap and offer points on their souls for Satan, if only he would 
return their calls.

A LIVELY PORTRAIT OF COUPLE FALLING IN AND OUT OF 'TRUE LOVE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not exactly a many-splendored thing, but "True Love" (at the Beverly 
Center Cineplex and the Century Plaza Cinemas) is as funny and fascinating as 
it is unflorid. This lively portrait of young Italian-Americans falling in and 
out of love come matrimony season in the Bronx plays like a trenchant cross 
between a teen sex comedy and an Albert Brooks super-realist nightmare. Or 
maybe "Moonstruck" in hell. 
</P>
<P>
Its young bride, Donna (Annabella Sciorra), and bridegroom, Michael (Ron 
Eldard), are none too bright as they spend their last few single days wildly 
careening toward what increasingly looks to be a significantly miserable 
marriage. As the arguments start, and buddy-bonding suddenly seems much more 
meaningful than impending vows, they experience a couple's worst dream come 
true -- discovering their true incompatibility within scant days of the 
ceremony itself. 
</P>
<P>
To laugh or to squirm? There's abundant humor, but director Nancy Savoca isn't 
afraid to wipe the smile off the movie's face when the pain cuts too deep. And 
she will leave it up to you whether or not to find dark comedy in the misguided 
litany of support from family and friends. "Once you two are on your honeymoon 
and can relax, you'll be fine" and "You'll see, after the wedding, he'll settle 
down," they rationalize helpfully, a Bronx chorus of denial. 
</P>
<P>
Early on, it's easy to see what Michael, a Peter Pan who plays at 
responsibility, and Donna, who wants to drag him kicking into adulthood, see in 
each other. They're the prettiest and probably spunkiest of their fast-talking 
circle. It's also easy to identify with the mutual irritations that develop 
and, if sympathy eventually sidles over toward her nagging efforts to grow him 
up, that's less a feminist viewpoint being foisted than a realistic one. (The 
contrast between the boys' drunken spree and the vengeful girls' night out is 
amusingly clear; the women can't have quite as grand a time, never having been 
taught how to lose themselves so completely.) 
</P>
<P>
The movie ends with a long take of the trussed-up, shell-shocked newlyweds that 
echoes the final shot of "The Graduate," but there's far less doubt about what 
life together for this couple will be like, only how much of a fight they'll 
put up getting there. 
</P>
<P>
It's a kind of fatalism, the planned obsolescence of affection, that may be 
hard for some audiences to identify with, but in this tightknit Italian 
culture, divorce or even calling off the wedding are hardly options. In one 
candid moment, Donna confesses to a pal that she's considered breaking the 
engagement, but, now, "I can't live here if I don't marry him." 
</P>
<P>
If none of this sounds like the stuff punchlines are made of, in lieu of easy 
laughs there are plenty of hard-won, subtle, difficult ones coming right out of 
character. "True Love" also provides the expected wicked hilarity when it comes 
to satirizing wedding rituals (like the visit to the family friend who pitches 
$3,000 "hair-loom" rings). 
</P>
<P>
Yet each time you suspect Savoca is finally setting up the big comic set-piece 
or a slide into sentimentality, she veers off on an altogether more difficult 
course. Along with her co-writer and husband, Richard Guay, she's fashioned a 
brave, astonishingly perceptive comic drama rife with perfect details and 
engaging subplots. Most likely, it's the debut of a major film maker. 
</P>
<P>
Among the cast of unknowns are easily half a dozen playful performances far 
more Oscar-worthy than the winter's big-budget Academy bait, with radiant 
Sciorra the most immediate find, and Eldard and Kelly Cinnante (who co-starred 
in "Tony N' Tina's Wedding" on the New York stage) also dead-on. They make it 
feel like real life that's being eavesdropped on, but Savoca and her upstart 
technical crew make it look and sound like a movie, too, one you'd swear must 
have cost several times what this triumph of low-budget invention actually did. 
</P>
<P>
"True Love" (rated R for ample profanity) is, among so many other things, a 
classic cautionary tale of co-dependency, almost sure to help bring on the end 
of more than one troubled engagement out in audienceland. See it with someone 
you love too much. 
</P>
</TEXT>
<GRAPHIC>
<P>
Photo, COLOR, TRUE INCOMPATIBILITY: The astonishingly perceptive comic drama 
"True Love" is a potential newlywed's nightmare, in which just about everything 
that can go emotionally wrong in the days before a wedding does. Flavorfully 
set in the Bronx with a terrific ensemble cast of unknowns, it's a stunning 
feature film debut for director Nancy Savoca. Reviewed by Chris Willman. F10

PAIR FLEE IRAN ONLY TO FIND 'HOTEL ASTORIA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Guests of the Hotel Astoria" (at the Monica 4-Plex) takes us into the 
daily lives of a group of Iranian refugees stranded in a small, drab Istanbul 
pension. Wracked by uncertainty after having risked their lives escaping from 
"Khomeini's hell," they fluctuate between hope and despair while living in 
constant fear. 
</P>
<P>
Time and again, they are awakened in the middle of the night by Turkish 
authorities intent on checking their passports (most of which are false). They 
worry about dwindling finances as they anxiously await word on their latest 
visa application. Theirs is a heartbreaking predicament, shot through with 
cruel ironies. 
</P>
<P>
Drawing upon his own experiences as a temporary exile in Turkey, Iranian 
writer-director Reza Alameh Zadeh, now living in Holland, singles out a married 
couple among the dozen refugees at the Hotel Astoria. In their 30s, they are 
attractive and well-educated (they had been teachers). Their efforts to get to 
the Netherlands, where the husband's brother has lived for 11 years, quickly 
turns into a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
It's fortunate that Zadeh, a better writer than director, is dealing with such 
strong material and that Shohreh Aghadashloo, who plays the wife, and Moshen 
Marzban, as her husband, are such accomplished actors. There's little style or 
drive to the film, but it eventually catches fire when we realize how concerned 
we've become with their fate. The film may be awkward, but it is numbingly 
credible. And as bleak and harrowing as it is, it is also suffused with warmth 
because the Hotel Astoria's guests are kind and supportive of each other, and 
they occasionally even receive the kindness of strangers. 
</P>
<P>
Along with its central performances, "The Guests of the Hotel Astoria" has 
among its pluses a spare yet dramatic score by Esfandiar Monfaredzadeh, who was 
a noted film composer in Iran, and clean, carefully lit camera work by Charles 
Burnett, an outstanding local independent film maker whose credits include the 
script and photography for "Killer of Sheep" and his own feature "Bless Their 
Little Hearts." 
</P>
<P>
"The Guests of the Hotel Astoria" (Times-rated Mature for adult themes) was 
produced by Rafigh Pooya, innovative operator of the now-closed Fox 
International Theater in Venice.

GAVIN FRIDAY: FATAL PASSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Virgin Prunes, Ireland's notorious gender-bending art-shock band, dissolved 
just before their scheduled L.A. debut in 1986. But the group -- which has 
reportedly resumed playing -- still has an estimable reputation among local 
gloom-rock fans, many of whom packed Club Lingerie on Tuesday to see former 
Prunes singer Gavin Friday. Instead of an electric Prune, they got a different 
kind of (Oscar) Wilde thing as Friday and his collaborator, a keyboardist 
called the Man Seezer, led a five-piece ensemble through the importance of 
being an earnest cabaret act. 
</P>
<P>
A chubby-faced iconoclast with pit demon eyes, Friday alternated between a 
croaking whisper and a flamingo-like wail, effectively framing dramatic songs 
of fatal passion and questioned faith. 
</P>
<P>
Edith Piaf, German Expressionism, Marianne Faithfull and Jacques Brel were all 
processed in the process, and a version of Brel's "Next" proved an effectively 
hellish marriage of anarchic behavior and controlled art song. 
</P>
<P>
For second-year art students, the whole George Grosz-like ambiance might seem 
innovative, but this is not Paris in the '20s nor Berlin in the '30s, and the 
demonstrative artifice of Friday's prophetic decadence often overshadowed any 
genuine emotional impact. CRAIG LEE

ETHNIC EATING: EIGHT TABLES BUT LOTS OF THAI ATMOSPHERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
5050 Sunset is both the address and name of a new Thai restaurant opened by Tom 
Sunnanon, who also owns Rama Thai Cuisine in Van Nuys. The new spot is bandbox 
neat, bathed in a pink glow from neon signs in the windows, and presents its 
food with delicate artistry. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant has only eight tables, plus another that is often occupied at 
night by schoolchildren doing homework, which indicates that this is a family 
enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
One night, orange flowers sprouted from every dish, testifying to the Thai love 
for pretty garnishes carved from vegetables. Another time, pale radish and 
parsnip flowers joined the carrot blossoms. 
</P>
<P>
The ubiquitous caramel-sweet Thai noodles, mee krob, are feathery light here, 
without a trace of stickiness. Just as light, crisp and addictive are the 
noodles in the appetizer called sarong. Usually, sarong is made by winding 
noodles around a ball of pork filling in an orderly pattern, much as one would 
roll a ball of yarn. Here, the filling dwindles to a speck that is almost lost 
in the loose swirl of fine, crisp noodle strands which upstage the pork. 
</P>
<P>
Thai restaurant menus are endlessly repetitive, and it is rare to find a dish 
that you haven't tasted before. However, 5050 has come up with connoisseur 
chicken, a bright blend of chicken, potato and pineapple in coconut curry 
sauce. The pineapple cuts through the rich blandness of the coconut milk, and 
fresh ginger shreds add to the tingling heat of the curry paste. 
</P>
<P>
The regular chicken curry, on the other hand, was overloaded with potatoes and 
lacked both chicken and flavor. Path pick king goong -- shrimp with red curry 
paste and fresh green beans -- also contained more vegetable than shrimp. But 
the sauce made the dish worthwhile: Ground peanuts, shredded kaffir lime leaf 
and sugar joined the already complex flavors of the curry paste. 
</P>
<P>
Shrimp in garlic and pepper sauce were as peppery and garlicky fragrant as one 
could want. And the classic Thai hot-and-sour shrimp soup was a fine example of 
this dish, aromatic with fresh lime leaves, lemon grass and devilishly hot 
small chiles. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, a couple of components were not at their best in the seafood 
pot, at $10.95 the priciest dish on the menu. The concept is sound -- an 
assortment of seafood, tender ears of baby corn and translucent noodles soak up 
the broth. But fish chunks contributed an unpleasantly strong flavor. And the 
huge crustaceans that dangled their feelers out of the pot were all show and 
shell. The meat portion was small and rather dry. They were, incidentally, 
freshwater lobsters imported from Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
Over-iodined clams marred another combination, called Chef's Choice, but good 
shrimp, scallops and crab compensated for that lapse. And the sauce was 
intriguing, a typically Thai blend of hot, savory and sweet. 
</P>
<P>
Egg rolls have been around forever, but 5050 does a good job with them, frying 
the rolls to order so they are fresh and crackly. Sate is satisfactory, and so 
are the Thai salads, which blend beef, squid, shrimp or a noodle and meat 
combination with hot and sour dressing. 
</P>
<P>
Prices are so reasonable that two can eat well for $20 or less. There are also 
inexpensive combination lunches and a new, multicourse early-bird dinner for 
$7.95. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes include connoisseur chicken and mee krob, which are each 
$4.25; egg rolls and sarong, $3.95; thom yum goong (hot and sour shrimp soup) 
and path pick king goong (shrimp with green beans), $5.95. 
</P>
<P>
 5050 Sunset, 5050 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles; (213) 913-1656. Open daily for 
lunch and dinner. MasterCard and Visa accepted. No alcoholic beverages. Street 
parking.

STAGE BEAT : 'ALEPH 3' AT SAXON LEE; 'THE MAIDS' AT POWERHOUSE; 'STONE 
THROWERS' AT THEATRE EXCHANGE; 'BRIDGE CLUB' AT MANHATTAN PIER PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aleph is the word for the first letter in the Hebrew alphabet. But for Jorge 
Luis Borges, who was never bound by any language in particular, it meant "a 
point in space where all points coincide." The difficulty with the past two 
editions of the ongoing performance series by Pipeline called "Aleph" was that 
they intended Borges' meaning without finding that elusive "point." 
</P>
<P>
Still, most of the previous "Aleph" pieces stayed in the mind; some, like 
Kedric Robin Wolfe's, even had a life. The new "Aleph 3," at the Saxon Lee 
Gallery, has a thematic convergence point, without many lasting moments. 
</P>
<P>
The four works depend on an interplay, if not a balance, between text and 
movement. The collective theme is innocence. Rob Sullivan's "Going From A to 
Z," directed by Darrell Larson, keeps all the elements in good calibration. 
</P>
<P>
It's actually a nice slap in the face to that faction in the arts that insists 
that the word is dead. Sullivan, in a refreshingly wacky departure from his 
labor movement-oriented writing for the local TheatreWorkers group, prances 
around the stage, lurches to and fro, and speaks to us (usually lit by the glow 
of a hand-held floodlight) like a little boy discovering the power of language. 
Percussionist John Fitzgerald's aural colors make the discovery sound more 
exciting than a trip to the moon. 
</P>
<P>
A million miles away from this is Italo Calvino's mini-fiction, "The Bared 
Bosom," performed by an elfin Scott Kelman and the stoic Carmella Greacen. A 
little knowledge of Italian men and Italian beaches adds hugely to this amusing 
satire of female objectification. As he skirts in and around the topless Greace 
under a sheltering sky and assesses how he can both ogle her and retain his 
post-sexist, progressive values, Kelman's beachcomber becomes a mix of Henry 
Miller and Chaplin, upended by his own hopeless logic. 
</P>
<P>
As director, Kelman has some good ideas with Betty Nash's "Minotaur," 
especially having Promethean tuba player William Roper use his instrument as 
the beast itself. But the bullfight drags out like a boring street fight rather 
than a taut struggle for a soul. 
</P>
<P>
The closer is more like playpen time than performance art: "Aleph Blue" is a 
Kelman-directed improvisation, with Hye Sook smearing deep-blue powder on a 
canvas sheet, Stanley Young trying to pluck word jazz out of the air, and 
Gilberte Meunier moving in and out between them. 
</P>
<P>
This is the point where innocence meets indulgence. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7525 Beverly Blvd., Saturdays and Sundays, 8 p.m., until Dec. 10. Tickets: 
$12; (213) 933-5282 or (213) 629-2205. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Maids' 
</P>
<P>
Call it coincidence, but a year after Jean Genet's "Deathwatch" was staged at 
the Powerhouse, Genet's "The Maids" comes to the same theater. 
</P>
<P>
With each production, the intent is to contemporize Genet's theater. 
"Deathwatch," written for men, was cast with women. Darkstage's "Maids" is cast 
with men, according to Genet's wishes. Lewis Arquette's direction, is Artaudian 
in the era of the Lakers and Rickey Henderson. The actors work mightily at an 
assignment that's over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Gabriel del Vecchio and Daniel Passer, as the maidservants intent on 
killing their mistress when they're not play-acting, nor Nigel Sanders-Self, as 
that mistress, can make the difficult, uncredited translation as vital as the 
physical business. And there's lots of the latter, including bullhorns, 
baseball bats and catcher's masks. 
</P>
<P>
Genet's themes of class deception, domesticated fascism and habituated ritual 
simply don't appear to have sunk into the minds of these actors, as committed 
as they seem to be. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3116 2nd St., Santa Monica, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 8 p.m., until Nov. 22. 
Tickets: $8; (213) 392-6529 or (213) 466-1767. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Stone Throwers' 
</P>
<P>
If sets could be shows unto themselves, then Robert W. Bingham's environmental 
design for "The Stone Throwers" at Theatre Exchange would be a memorable one. 
</P>
<P>
Bingham cuts no corners with his North Carolina cafe -- notice how the roof 
gives way to sheet metal, how the soot clings to everything (L. Lynn Hart's 
lights, however, could use more soot). 
</P>
<P>
Some of the characters in Lynn Phillip Seibel's production of Donegan Smith's 
backwoods drama, especially Kelso, the cafe owner (Milt Tarver), and drug 
dealer Paul (Alex D'Andrea), want to wipe the soot out of their lives. But Iron 
Cordell, the big bad sheriff (Charles Howerton), is upset that Kelso, under 
Cordell's thumb, has a new pal. We expect explosions, but the not the kind of 
apocalyptic, ludicrously back-to-the-caves denouement Smith resorts to. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11855 Hart St., North Hollywood, on Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., 
until Dec. 2. Tickets: $12.50; (213) 466-1767. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Octette Bridge Club' 
</P>
<P>
Mary, one of eight Irish Catholic sisters that make up "The Octette Bridge 
Club," dares irreverence over the card table when she says she'd "wanted to be 
a nun, but I couldn't get into the habit." 
</P>
<P>
Playwright P. J. Barry wants us to know that Mary isn't good with the jokes, 
but he means it as comic relief nevertheless. For a 1985 play, this is awfully 
musty stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad, because Barry means well. He means to show that these nice Catholic 
women have carried their morality a touch too far, to the point where it's 
seriously warping Betsy, the youngest of the octet (Barbara McCloy). He also 
means to show that Betsy can rise above the repression. 
</P>
<P>
Try as it may -- and it does -- Jean Van De Griek's Manhattan Pier Players 
ensemble can't hide the play's crude stab at layering human drama over family 
comedy. Even viewed from the fine arena seating (the theater doubles as 
Manhattan Beach's city council chambers), the sibling clashes are unaffecting, 
and blunted by a cop-out happy ending. 
</P>

SAN DIEGO STAGE WATCH: TICKET SALES MUSIC TO THE EARS OF PRODUCER IN STAGE 
VERSION OF 'MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS' 
</P>

<P>
Never mind those reviews: Louis Burke, producer of the new stage version of 
"Meet Me in St. Louis," said from New York that sales for the show never 
faltered, despite mixed notices from the New York critics. 
</P>
<P>
Weiler/Miller/Carrella, the management firm handling the show -- which features 
additional songs by Hugh Martin, 75, of Encinitas and his 75-year-old partner, 
Ralph Blane -- reports that the show, which cost $6 million, has already 
grossed $1.3 million, with figures expected to rise. An advertising blitz 
begins Friday with TV spots and Sunday with a full-page ad in the New York 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the firm is selling tickets through January, but it has also 
accepted bookings for December, 1990, from groups who find it the perfect 
Christmas show. 
</P>
<P>
Small wonder when one of its classic songs -- by Martin and Blane -- is the 
Songwriting Hall of Famer "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
FLATTERED, I'M SURE: Paul Downey, press secretary to Mayor Maureen O'Connor, 
gave a thumbs-up to actor Bill Barstad's portrayal of him in "Emma Goldman 
Speaks," a street theater performance that traveled from the downtown Amtrak 
station up Broadway to Horton Plaza on Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Downey got to see only 15 minutes of the show -- not enough time to follow the 
script, which brought activist Emma Goldman back from the dead to chastise San 
Diego for passing the anti-free speech ordinance in 1912 and asking the mayor 
if anything has really changed. But Downey was there long enough to see Barstad 
as Downey get thrown off the stage a couple of times. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a kick out of it," Downey said. "I was tickled that they thought me 
worthy enough to portray, and I thought it was a boffo performance on the 
actor's part." 
</P>
<P>
AN UNDERGROUND VIEW: The newest unofficial contribution to the Soviet arts 
festival is called "Looking for America" and is playing Underground at the 
Lyceum on Fridays and Saturdays through Nov. 18. The hourlong show, written by 
the ensemble that performs it, takes a look at a busy American street corner 
through the eyes of a Russian student. Directed by Underground co-producer 
Sarah Golden, the show features Don Victor, Judy Milstein, Damon Bryant, Kim 
Porter, Michael Hummel, David Baldwin, Tokeli LeClaire and Loren Hecht. 
</P>
<P>
HOME-GROWN WORKS: The Progressive Stage Company begins its first Home Grown 
Theatre Festival tonight. The event, which ends Dec. 17, will premiere 20 
original works by seven Southern California playwrights, three local directors 
and 14 local actors. The first three works, "Hopping Down the Chicken Trail," 
"Demonstration of Love" and "All for Nothing," all by Los Angeles playwright 
William Royce, will run Friday and Saturday nights at 10:30 for the first three 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
PARTY WATCH CONTINUES: The San Diego Actors Theatre, which presented a 
semi-staged reading of A. R. Gurney's "The Perfect Party" last spring, will be 
back with a fully staged production opening Feb. 2 and running Wednesdays 
through Sundays at The Elizabeth North Theatre. Three of the original actors at 
the party -- Amelia Emerson, Parker Tenney and Brian Salmon -- will return, 
with San Diego Actors Theatre artistic director Patricia Elmore taking on the 
role of the critic. 
</P>
<P>
SANTA THE HAM: The Del Mar Theatre Ensemble, a children's theater company, will 
present "Peter and the Wolf," "A Child's Christmas in Wales" and "The Night 
Before Christmas" at the Del Mar Plaza, 1555 Camino del Mar, Nov. 25-Dec. 20. 
Santa Claus will lead a carol sing-along after each show and will greet 
children before and after the performance. 
</P>
<P>
PIG SHOES TO FILL: And the playwright comes to the rescue: Steve Friedman, who 
is writing the world premiere of "Animal Nation," scheduled to open Dec. 13 at 
the San Diego Repertory Theatre, had a quick fix when Michael Fields, 
co-artistic director of Dell' Arte Players, had a conflict that caused him to 
drop the part of Watson, the pig who instigates a revolution. Friedman will 
play the pig.

In a series of drawings, Bryan Hunt reworks images of cliffs framing the sea 
into tall, angular abstractions that resemble his bronze sculpture. Loosely 
sketched with graphite and oil stick, zapped with sparse watercolor washes, 
these landscape fragments are like passing thoughts shared with a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the precipices that frame each sheet bulge and indent in 
complementary ways, as if yielding to pressure from each other across the 
divide of space. Variations in the substantiality of the cliffs provide fresh 
points for the eye to fix on. 
</P>
<P>
In a group of super-size (60x45-inch) drawings, the cliffs assume Baroque 
proportions -- knobbily exaggerated, Dr. Seuss drawing shapes. What comes 
through in the end is the sheer fecundity and flexibility Hunt displays while 
noodling around within the parameters of a sharply defined theme. (BlumHelman, 
916 Colorado Ave., Santa Monica, to Nov. 25) CATHY CURTIS

Moving surreptitiously through the park benches and beaches of Santa Monica 
armed with a camera, Ruth Bavetta takes unnoticed snapshots of seniors sunning 
or staring blankly, and of youths tanning oiled, taut bodies or huddling in 
intimate conversation. The paintings that Bavetta makes from these photos have 
been called photorealism but that's a misnomer as there is an inbred 
awkwardness to the figures' positioning, an inaccuracy to their anatomy and a 
foreshortening that gives scenes a bizarre, even distorted twist. 
</P>
<P>
An instinctive and emotional colorist, the artist borrows her palette from the 
under belly of a rainbow trout, highlighting figures' translucent skin, the 
folds of sun-blanched white frocks or the silvering hair of advanced age in 
incandescent pinks, lilacs and blues. All the above are in Bavetta's 
voyeuristic peeks at elderly card players, skinny-legged grandpas in Bermuda 
shorts gazing pensively out to see the mood of a memory, or of a reality spied 
through the half-closed eyes of a reverie. 
</P>
<P>
That's the good news. The bad news is that in too many paintings awkward 
draftsmanship eventually yanks our attention away from the scenes' pathos. In 
"The Dead Sunbather" and in another view of a Barbie-doll blonde who torques 
her body to look back at us, ill-placed depth cues and sketchy handling make 
protagonists look dwarfed. (Orlando Gallery, 14553 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks,

Born in China and raised in Honolulu, Mary Bonic seems to combine memories of 
both cultures into her nifty free-standing sculptures and paintings on wood 
panel. They sport vivacious silhouettes, bright colors and eccentric, willful 
snatches of patterning that avoid formula or slickness. 
</P>
<P>
The "Trio" wall pieces are huge abstract black cutouts that sometimes 
incorporate cartoon-like fillips like splayed "fingers" and "toes" or jazzy 
doodles. Other paintings contain interlocking designs on black grounds. In 
"Ancestral Digs," a welter of forms and outlines conjur up landscape forms, 
fish eyes, spear points and fire. 
</P>
<P>
The two-sided constructions are the most fun, even if their rear views 
sometimes seem insufficiently resolved. Built out of bits and pieces of 
brightly painted wood, they bristle with corners and curves. Most are abstract, 
but a couple amusingly invoke the figure. "Woman in Kimono" -- perhaps the most 
free-spirited of the lot -- has a face made of sponges painted white and gray. 
"Wayfarer" stands on an oblong, cartoonish "foot" and carries on his back an 
abstracted "knapsack" pieced together out of a bright jumble of shapes and 
symbols. (Williams Lamb Gallery, 102 W. 3rd St., to Sunday) Cathy Curtis

The fiberglass-and-metal pods Jacqueline Dreager molds from abandoned Air Force 
radar covers are a curious balance of threat and amusement. It's hard not to 
enjoy the funky, let's-pretend artifice of the pill-shaped planets with 
Saturn-style wooden rings and time capsules of translucent plastic with 
uncertain contents. 
</P>
<P>
Like props from old science-fiction movies they are entertaining even if they 
do suggest the campy terror of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers." But plastic 
egg shapes, with their industrial sameness, get redundant. After a rush of '60s 
nostalgia we need more than sci-fi simulated planets. Pieces like the brass 
"Double Portrait," a ball pierced by ice tongs marked with two pressure screws 
inscribed "L.A." and "Beijing," add a welcome layer of political reflection. 
</P>
<P>
Also on view are Mari Andrews' large white, blue on blue paint-stick drawings 
of organic vessels. These painterly blueprints read like enlarged viscera. Each 
form is a wide, linear white silhouette delightfully alive with expressive 
marks and rippling with a ghostly electricity. Pared down to the essentials 
they suggest both calligraphy and science; natural instinct and rational 
intelligence. Interesting dualities never seem at odds. (Shoshana Wayne 
Gallery, 1454 5th St., to Nov. 25) Suvan Geer

LONG-EARED OWL (Asio otus) 
</P>
<P>
Description: Slender with long, close-set ear tufts. Boldly streaked and barred 
on breast and belly; facial disk is rusty. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Conifer and mixed conifer- deciduous forest, especially near water, 
parks, orchards and farm woodlands. 
</P>
<P>
Diet: Mostly rodents; rarely amphibians, reptiles, fish and insects. 
</P>
<P>
Displays: The courting male flies erratic and zigzags with deep, slow 
wingbeats, occasionally gliding and clapping wings together beneath his body. 
</P>
<P>
Nest: Usually in abandoned nests (especially those of crow, also squirrel, 
hawk, magpie, heron, raven). Built of small sticks, inner bark strips and pine 
needles. Female selects the site. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs: White, 1.6 inches long. 
</P>
<P>
Natural history notes: This owl is a night hunter and is able to locate even 
faint sounds with remarkable accuracy. At night it flies over open fields and 
marshes, during the day it roosts in trees, close to the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
Familiarity with the environment, especially such things as the heights of 
favorite perches above the ground, seems to be essential to the owl's ability 
to pounce on prey. Hearing helps replace the absence of sight, but intimate 
knowledge of the habitat completes the job. 
</P>
<P>
Is more gregarious in winter; flocks may roost together. Generally a silent 
bird, except during breeding season. His common call is one or more long 
hooo's. 
</P>
<P>

to get information on the breeding bird atlas (now in its fifth and final 
year), call Sea and Sage Audubon Society member Nancy Kenyon, (714) 786-3160.

SINGLE LIFE: A SMILE, SINCERE WORDS CAN HELP WALLFLOWERS TURN OVER A NEW LEAF

<P>
If you respond to invitations to social and business gatherings with a sense of 
dread -- and you're tired of melting into the wallpaper -- there is help. 
</P>
<P>
Brenda Blackman teaches singles how to break through shyness, initiate 
conversation and hold the other person's interest. 
</P>
<P>
"For some people, just walking up to a person and introducing themselves 
produces fear," says Blackman, who teaches at community colleges throughout the 
county. "Others get tongue-tied thinking of something to talk about." 
</P>
<P>
Blackman believes that being shy, or characterizing oneself as shy, is the 
armor a person wears to shield himself or herself from facing fear. And she 
says it's common for shy people to believe that those who appear to be 
confident are normal -- and that their own shyness is abnormal. 
</P>
<P>
"Nearly everyone is shy sometimes -- the difference is that the person who 
appears confident and outgoing has made the effort and broken through that 
barrier," she says. 
</P>
<P>
She contends that shyness is a form of self-centeredness. "The shy person is 
always thinking and worrying about how they are being perceived by others," she 
says. "If you are constantly thinking about yourself, you will be mentally 
paralyzed and therefore unable to initiate an interesting conversation with 
anyone. So I tell people to get off themselves and develop a genuine interest 
in others." 
</P>
<P>
Blackman recommends a three-week exercise for those who are afraid to talk with 
strangers: 
</P>
<P>
"Week 1: Smile at every stranger you see. You will get one of three reactions 
-- people will smile back, they will ignore you, or look at you like you're 
crazy. Most people will smile back, but even if they don't, that's not 
important -- it's the process that's important." 
</P>
<P>
During Week 2, she continues, "smile and simply say 'Hi.' And during Week 3 
smile, say 'Hi' and make a short comment. Any remark will do: 'Nice day,' 
'Looks like rain.' . . . Again, it's the exercise that's important." 
</P>
<P>
The best greeting at a social gathering is also a simple one, Blackman says. 
"Just smile and say 'Hi.' It's friendly and immediately puts the other person 
at ease." 
</P>
<P>
When you're alone at a party, she advises, "sit next to someone who is also 
alone. Once you've said 'Hi,' you are practically assured of a conversation. He 
or she will likely be relieved and appreciative of your company." 
</P>
<P>
Next she recommends that whatever words follow be sincere. "Compliments are 
good openers, but only if you mean them. You can say, 'Nice jacket' or, 'Pretty 
earrings.' Don't worry if you think you sound trite -- what counts is 
sincerity." 
</P>
<P>
To keep the conversation going, Blackman suggests creating a common bond. 
"People like others who are like themselves," she says. "Find something to 
which the other person can relate. If they are keeping time with the music, 
comment on how great the band is." 
</P>
<P>
Once rapport has been developed, natural conversation can begin to flow. "From 
there you can say something like, 'I really love the saxophone, don't you?' -- 
and that can lead to finding out if the other person plays a musical 
instrument, and so on." Such exchanges of "free information," Blackman says, 
allow people to reveal themselves slowly, thus maintaining a "conversational 
comfort zone." 
</P>
<P>
Blackman warns against conducting an "interview," which often makes people feel 
like they are being interrogated. "Avoid asking someone what they do for a 
living, the kind of car they drive or whether they own or rent their home. 
These are money questions. It's like saying, 'Tell me, and if I think you're 
good enough, we'll talk.' That information can come later." 
</P>
<P>
Once conversation is running smoothly, personal questions -- "Why have you 
never married?" "Why did you get a divorce?" -- should also be avoided, 
according to Blackman. "These questions put a damper on the personal magnetism 
between two people. Whenever you make someone else uncomfortable, you undo 
those upbeat moments you have shared." 
</P>
<P>
She also discourages revealing too much about oneself at a first meeting. 
"Avoid talking about the past," she advises. 
</P>
<P>
And she urges people to avoid talking about personal problems. "Don't talk 
about dilemmas involving your kids or your boss," she says. "Everyone comes 
with baggage, but don't drop it on someone else's doorstep when you first meet 
them." 
</P>
<P>
And droning on is a cardinal sin. "Remember, if you find yourself saying, 
'Well, to make a long story short,' it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
And the best remedy for a conversation lull? "Smile brightly and say, 'And what 
shall we talk about now?' Or ask the person to dance." 
</P>
<P>
Ending a conversation can often be awkward. For this, she suggests a 
straightforward approach. "If you would like to see the person again, tell him 
or her that you enjoyed chatting and suggest making future plans to get 
together," she says. "Depending on their response, ask for a business card or 
phone number. If not, simply thank them for the conversation and move along."

<P>
ADVISORY BOARD GIVES HIGH SCHOOLERS A VOICE IN EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By TERRI PHAM, Terri Pham is a junior at University High School, where she is a 
reporter for the student news magazine Sword and Shield, a volleyball player 
and a member of the Mock Trial, Speech and Debate, Vietnamese, Key and 
California Scholastic Federation clubs.

High school students in California have their own voting representative, 
appointed by the governor, on the State Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
They are required to take only two years of physical education now, instead of 
the four years that were formerly required. 
</P>
<P>
Their views on various issues are sought out by teachers, and they are often 
allowed to participate on school district committees and commissions, as 
recommended by the state board. 
</P>
<P>
They even have their own representative on the California Commission on AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Who is responsible for all these advancements in students' responsibilities and 
rights? Ask Clark Moore, a junior at University High School in Irvine. Moore is 
also state director of the Student Advisory Board on Education, which presents 
student proposals for changes in the state's education system. 
</P>
<P>
"SABE is the only recognized student organization in California that has the 
privilege of annually addressing the state board," Moore said. "Therefore, it 
gives students the opportunity to directly bring about educational changes." 
</P>
<P>
The student advisory board is a major program of the California Assn. of 
Student Councils, which offers leadership programs for elementary, middle and 
high school student councils. 
</P>
<P>
High school students head all levels of the student advisory board program -- 
on the school campus, regional and state levels. The process for change begins 
in the schools, where students write proposals -- some as simple as asking for 
better food in the cafeteria. If the proposals are limited to one school or 
district, that's where the solutions are sought, with the students taking their 
requests through the proper channels. 
</P>
<P>
Some proposals are more far-reaching and are sent on to the regional level, 
where they are handled at one of 18 regional student advisory board 
conferences. From there, the proposals may find their way to the student 
council associations's state conference, held over five days in March in 
Sacramento. There, students select the eight most promising proposals and 
divide the delegation for research and writing. The groups then present the 
completed proposals to the State Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that students do have valuable input and good ideas," said Moore, 
whose duties include coordinating the state conference. "We can facilitate 
those ideas better because we have an insight into the education process." 
</P>
<P>
Student advisory board members, who had a hand in proposing the state lottery, 
are presently working on proposals to require districts to hire more 
counselors. They also want foreign language classes inaugurated in elementary 
schools and suspension abolished as a punishment for truancy. 
</P>
<P>
The student council association is involved in co-sponsoring Earth Train -- a 
railroad journey between California and Washington. The trip, scheduled in 
April, will teach students about environmental problems. Moore said the goal by 
journey's end is to have student-written proposals that will then be presented 
to Congress and, perhaps, the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Moore's interest in student government began when he served as a seventh-grade 
representative and eighth-grade treasurer on his middle school's student 
council. At University, he has been freshman class treasurer and student 
representative to the Irvine Board of Education. He also has served on the 
Parent Teacher Student Assn., the School Site Council and the Principal's 
Council. Presently, he is government operations director/parliamentarian for 
the student council. 
</P>
<P>
He became involved at the state level during his sophomore year, when he 
attended a student advisory board conference. There, he won a scholarship to 
attend the studetn council association camp that summer. Moore later applied 
for the student board director's position and was appointed by CASC student 
state President Katie Sternfels, a senior at Lodi High School. 
</P>
<P>
Other Orange County high school students involved with the student council 
association at the state level include Vice President Refugio Plascencia, a 
senior at Los Amigos; elementary director Vicky Parente, a senior at Laguna 
Hills; and Government Operations at Local Levels director Anne Bui, a senior at 
Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, whose job with the student advisory board takes him all over the state, 
is often absent from school. But academics remain a priority for the A student. 
"I'm learning a lot about the educational system on my trips," he said. "It's a 
different kind of education. I'm learning a lot about leadership." 
</P>
<P>
His current project is to establish a school student advisory board council at 
University -- something he hopes will happen at every school in California. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to see as many students involved as possible," Moore said. "And not 
just members of the student councils. While they have good ideas, it's good to 
hear from all the students."

WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU QUIT SMOKING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This year, about 390,000 people will die from smoking and smoking-related 
diseases, according to the American Cancer Society. It is estimated there will 
be 155,000 new cases of lung cancer this year, and smoking is responsible for 
87% of lung cancer cases. 
</P>
<P>
But there are people who continue to smoke. Surprisingly, teen-agers still pick 
up the habit, despite the overwhelming evidence of its dangers. 
</P>
<P>
Hot Topic correspondents were asked to interview teen-agers who smoke -- or 
recently quit -- and ask them: "What would it take to get you to give up 
cigarette smoking?" Some who responded asked to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
"I would need something to occupy all of my free time and to keep me relaxed 
simultaneously." --Brett Smith, 17, senior, Brea-Olinda 
</P>

crutch, but so is almost everything else." --Michael Iverson, 17, senior, 
Brea-Olinda

<P>
"I would need a new drug to occupy my time. Also, I have nothing making me quit 
because I can smoke at home." --Brant Austin, 16, sophomore, Brea-Olinda 
</P>
<P>
"That's a good question. If I had the willpower or if I had a strong enough 
reason -- like a pregnancy." --Chrysta Shomaker, 17, senior, Connelly 
</P>
<P>
"When I did, it took a close relative dying for me to stop." --Name withheld, 
17, senior, Connelly 
</P>
<P>
"When I get pregnant or if I had to set an example for someone, like my kids."

</P>
<P>
"Less stress." --Mike Casebier, 17, senior, Dana Hills 
</P>

"If I decided to get back into athletics, I'd quit. I guess it would take the 
actual physical pain to get me to stop." --Heather Gulino, 16, junior, Dana 
Hills 
</P>
<P>
"If a doctor told me I had lung cancer or emphysema." --Dominic Peralta, 15, 
sophomore, Edison 
</P>
<P>
"Encouragement from friends." --Jon Smith, 16, junior, Estancia 
</P>
<P>
"I ended up quitting because I used to go dancing. I had to experience chest 
pain before I stopped." --Rachel Abowitt-Erice, 17, senior, Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
"If I wasn't going to die anyway, I would stop smoking." --Shelley Lush, 17, 
senior, Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
"If I really tried, probably my own determination, or if they stopped selling 
cigarettes." --S.C., 17, senior, Ocean View 
</P>
<P>
"My dad smokes also, and the only way I'd quit is if my dad really means to 
stop." 
</P>
<P>
Albert Gomez, 16, --junior, Santa Ana Valley

Tony Brown's three-point shot with 1:10 left in the fifth overtime put 
Milwaukee ahead to stay and the Bucks defeated the Seattle SuperSonics, 
155-154, Thursday night in the longest NBA game since the adoption of the 
24-second clock 35 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 146-146, the Bucks outscored the Sonics, 9-0, starting 
with Brown's three-pointer from the left corner and ending with 34 seconds 
remaining on Jeff Grayer's layup that made the score 155-146. 
</P>
<P>
The only longer game in NBA history was Jan. 6, 1951, when the Indianapolis 
Olympians beat the Rochester Royals, 75-73, in six overtimes. The Syracuse 
Nationals defeated the Anderson Packers, 125-123, in five overtimes on Nov. 24, 
1949. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Ellis scored a career-high 53 points for Seattle, including 20 in the five 
overtimes, and Xavier McDaniel added 35 points. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Pierce had a career-high 36 points for Milwaukee before fouling out in 
the first overtime. Alvin Robertson added 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
After Milwaukee's 9-0 run, Seattle countered with a three-point basket by Dana 
Barros, a free throw by Nate McMillan and Sedale Threatt's rebound basket which 
made it 155-152. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle had a chance to tie the game, but McDaniel's desperation three-point 
shot missed. He was fouled by Jay Humphries as time expired and his two free 
throws made it 155-154. 
</P>
<P>
The score was 103-103 at the end of regulation and 110-110, 120-120, 127-127 
and 138-138 after each of the first four overtimes. 
</P>
<P>
In the first 1:10 of the fourth overtime, the teams traded baskets on their 
first four possessions. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee's Ben Coleman was called for a technical and Ellis made it. Two free 
throws by McDaniel and two by Ellis gave Seattle a 136-131 lead with 1:36 left. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee's Jack Sikma made a three-point basket and Brown sank a 20-foot 
jumper with 59 seconds left, tying the game again. 
</P>
<P>
On Seattle's ensuing possession, Humphries rebounded Ellis' missed shot and 
Brown banked in a turnaround jumper with 21 seconds left. Ellis countered with 
an 18-foot jumper from the right of the key with 11 seconds left, knotting the 
game, 138-138. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee led, 126-125, with five seconds left in the third overtime when Sikma 
was fouled by Derrick McKey. Sikma, who hadn't missed a free throw all season, 
missed the first but sank the second, giving the Bucks a 127-125 lead. Ellis' 
basket tied it with two seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 102-97, in regulation, the Sonics scored six unanswered points to 
pull ahead, 103-102, with 36 seconds left. McDaniel capped the run with a 
20-foot jump. 
</P>
<P>
But Milwaukee's Fred Roberts made one of two free throws, tying the game, 
103-103.

NBC GETS NBA FOR FOUR YEARS, $600 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After this season, it will no longer be the NBA on CBS. It will be the NBA on 
NBC. 
</P>
<P>
After a 17-year affiliation with CBS, the NBA switched television networks 
Thursday, announcing a four-year, $600-million deal with NBC starting with the 
1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
The contract breaks down to $150 million a season, a increase from the 
$44-million annual payment called for in the four-year, $176-million contract 
with CBS, which expires at the end of this season. 
</P>
<P>
CBS has televised the NBA since the 1973-74 season. 
</P>
<P>
CBS, as stipulated in its current contract, had a one-month exclusive 
negotiating period, which ended Oct. 31 without an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA then made a proposal to CBS, which the network considered, but ended up 
turning down Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The same proposal was offered to NBC and ABC on Wednesday. NBC said yes, ABC 
said no. 
</P>
<P>
"We were shocked we even got this opportunity," said Dick Ebersol, president of 
NBC Sports. "All our people, with the exception of Arthur Watson (former NBC 
Sports president who has stayed on in an advisory role), believed CBS would pay 
whatever the NBA asked. 
</P>
<P>
"What's even more amazing is that the figure is one that our people in sales 
say will allow us to make a profit or break even. 
</P>
<P>
"NBC is the No. 1 network. We were not looking to sports to promote a dying 
prime-time lineup. This deal makes good business sense to us." 
</P>
<P>
Ebersol said CBS has been making an annual profit of $40-$50 million off the 
NBA. 
</P>
<P>
But add that profit to the $44 million CBS was paying in annual rights fee, and 
you still don't get $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
So how does NBC figure it can make money? 
</P>
<P>
One way is more regular-season exposure. 
</P>
<P>
This season, CBS will have 16 telecasts. Next season, NBC figures to have 20 to 
22, and that number is expected to increase in future seasons to 26. 
</P>
<P>
There will be a November Sunday telecast, a Christmas telecast and a regular 
series of Sunday afternoon games beginning in January. There will be several 
Sunday doubleheaders. 
</P>
<P>
Ebersol said NBC will not show one game in the West and another in the East on 
a regional basis. Each game will be shown nationally. 
</P>
<P>
NBC will also have one more playoff telecast, up from 29 to 30. The fifth game 
of the Eastern Conference finals, which now belongs to cable, will be on NBC 
when its contract takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
And there's good news for West Coast viewers. Ebersol said that, at the request 
of the NBA, there will be no playoff telecasts delayed until 11:30 p.m. Playoff 
telecasts will begin at 9 p.m. in the East, 6 p.m. in the West. 
</P>
<P>
As for announcers, Ebersol said only that NBC has a stable of them. 
</P>
<P>
Most likely, the No. 1 play-by-play announcer will be Marv Albert, who besides 
his network assignments with NBC is also the popular announcer of the New York 
Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
Other play-by-play possibilities are Dick Enberg, Bob Costas and newcomer Joel 
Meyers. 
</P>
<P>
NBC probably will hire its commentators. 
</P>
<P>
Ebersol and NBA Commissioner David Stern, during a conference call with 
reporters Thursday, said that NBC will also televise the McDonald's Open, an 
exhibition tournament in Europe that was on ABC last month. 
</P>
<P>
Another new aspect will be a Saturday morning magazine show. Ebersol described 
it as sort of an "Entertainment Tonight" for basketball fans. 
</P>
<P>
To give an idea of how TV rights fees have grown, Stern pointed out that 10 
years ago, in 1979, the league made less than $20 million from network and 
cable television. 
</P>
<P>
That year marked the first venture into cable, with the USA network paying 
$400,000. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 1986, $33 million was all the NBA was making off television, 
with $22 million coming from CBS and $11 from two cable deals. 
</P>
<P>
The huge increases coincide with the increased popularity of pro basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's something we noticed after the deal was made," Ebersol said. "The World 
Series this year, a four-game sweep, averaged a 16.4 rating and a 30 share. The 
NBA finals last June, also a four-game sweep, averaged a 15.1 and a 30 share. 
</P>
<P>
"For the NBA finals to be getting the same share as the World Series tells us a 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
The new contract is also a boon for NBA players, who, through their union 
contract, are guaranteed 53% of the league's gross revenues. That means that 
about $56 million more a year will be divided among the players on the 27 NBA 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
That figures to about $2 million a team. Added to the current salary cap of 
$9.8 million a team, and with 12 players on each squad, the average salary 
would be right at $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Neal Pilson, CBS Sports president, said: "CBS regrets the loss of the NBA 
broadcast rights. However, the increase in the total cost of the package sought 
by the league . . . for the next four years was substantially more than we were 
prepared to pay. 
</P>
<P>
"We wish the NBA a successful future and extend our congratulations to NBC. We 
look forward to our coverage of the NBA in the 1989-90 season." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Swanson, president of ABC Sports, said: "We offer our congratulations to 
NBC, and to the NBA for the way it conducted the negotiations."

Anthony Smith was only 8, but he wanted a Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
That Cadillac. The one next door. The one he saw his neighbor come out and warm 
up on those cold New York mornings. 
</P>
<P>
An orphan since 3, Smith had drifted from relative to relative. 
</P>
<P>
At 8, he was living with his Aunt Netti. She drank a lot, leaving Smith and his 
three brothers and two sisters to run the house and make the decisions, and 
Smith's decision was to get that car.

<P>
So one morning, after watching his neighbor start the Cadillac and go back 
indoors, leaving the engine running, Smith jumped in. 
</P>
<P>
He took off at about 60 m.p.h. He was so small, he banged his head on the 
steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
But he knew how to drive. He had learned at a car wash where he was already 
working. 
</P>
<P>
Smith drove to where some teen-age friends hung out. They pushed him into the 
back seat and took control, racing the Cadillac at speeds up to 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the driver lost control. 
</P>
<P>
The car crashed. Both kids in the front seat were killed. Smith and a companion 
in the back survived. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, shaking badly, looked up and down his body. Not a scratch. 
</P>
<P>
So, he got out and walked away, leaving the smoke and the screams and the 
approaching sirens behind. 
</P>
<P>
Just another day on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Smith is a star defensive lineman for Arizona. This Saturday, if a 
separated shoulder has healed sufficiently, he will face USC at Arizona Stadium 
with a Rose Bowl berth possibly on the line. 
</P>
<P>
But there'll be no pressure on Smith. The football battles each week are 
make-believe to him. The real battles in Smith's life were in the tough 
neighborhoods of New York. 
</P>
<P>
He won that war, and nothing since has seemed as important. 
</P>
<P>
When Smith was 3, his mother, Naomi, died of liver damage attributed to 
drinking. He never knew his father. 
</P>
<P>
At 9, Smith started experimenting with marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up with a little older age group," he said. "The guys my age were a 
little afraid to do some of the things I did. I guess mainly because they had 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
"The first joint I smoked, I did it because everybody else did it. It was just 
a dare." 
</P>
<P>
From there, he went on to cocaine, heroin, PCP, acid, speed, pills and mixtures 
of chemicals he's not sure of. He even got high by smoking cigarettes sprayed 
with cooking oil. 
</P>
<P>
All this before he was a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
"I took stuff we used to call stars," he said. "I don't even know what they 
were. All kinds of pills. You name it. I remember one time taking uppers and 
downers. And drinking behind that. 
</P>
<P>
"Damn, I took some stuff, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
Smith can remember dropping acid at 9, before watching TV. 
</P>
<P>
"The cartoon characters (appeared to) come out of the TV screen and hang on the 
wall," he said. "I would just sit there in a daze." 
</P>
<P>
Smith got into a gang, the Black Spades, and more trouble. 
</P>
<P>
At 10, he went along with some friends on a bank robbery. 
</P>
<P>
He went so far as to put on a disguise, including a wig, but got scared and 
backed out before his friends went through with it. They are still in prison. 
</P>
<P>
At 11, Smith was involved in an armored car robbery, which he wouldn't discuss, 
except to say he didn't back out that time. 
</P>
<P>
By 12, he was stealing regularly, to get money for drugs and to buy clothes and 
food. 
</P>
<P>
"Where I was living," Smith said, "next door, people would drink and beat their 
wife and kids. People would get high on PCP and cut people up. When you spend 
the night with these people, you are susceptible to anything." 
</P>
<P>
He can remember thinking he might beat up his 2-year-old niece because the 
toddler had flushed cocaine down the toilet. Instead, he backed off. 
</P>
<P>
Smith sold drugs, lacing them with talcum powder and baking soda to stretch the 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
He also admits mugging other dealers and stealing their drugs. 
</P>
<P>
On his 14th birthday, he and a brother took heroin. 
</P>
<P>
Smith wound up in the hospital. He was lucky; his brother died. 
</P>
<P>
"That really, really scared me," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
He became even more scared when he and some friends gathered to meet another 
group in a showdown fight. Smith brought along a brother's gun. 
</P>
<P>
According to Smith, he lost the gun during the fight, but it was eventually 
used to kill several people. The weapon was traced to him. Having lied about 
his name and age, Smith was put in jail. 
</P>
<P>
There he stayed for three months until the murderer was caught. 
</P>
<P>
Upon his release, Smith went to North Carolina to live with his half-brother, 
Donald, a policeman 18 years his senior. 
</P>
<P>
But once there, Anthony reverted to old habits, sneaking off to do drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Donald came home one day, caught Anthony with drugs in his hands and threw him 
out of the house. 
</P>
<P>
As Anthony sat on the front lawn, out came all his belongings, flying through 
the door, one by one. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to do drugs, goodby," Donald said. "If you don't, you can stay. I 
love you because you're my brother, but you can get the hell on. I've given you 
all I can give you." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, someone had gotten the message through. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony agreed to go to a rehabilitation clinic, where he stayed for two years. 
Two tough years. Rehab did not prove to be an instantaneous cure. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost climbed the walls there," he said. "I scratched (with) my fingernails 
until they were bleeding and down to nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Withdrawal included constant headaches, cramps, vomiting and aching eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people think they can quit cold turkey," Smith said. "All the time, I 
had been telling myself, 'I can stop.' 
</P>
<P>
"But something comes over you. Like when you see a piece of food that looks 
real good, your mouth starts to water. Well, I would get a certain salty taste 
in my mouth where I'd feel like I was about to throw up, and I'd start to 
jitter if I couldn't smoke a joint. 
</P>
<P>
"You're stupid if you take something like this up. You can't stop. I don't care 
who you are, you cannot stop." 
</P>
<P>
Smith doesn't think anti-drug campaigns with celebrities are the answer. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people on TV programs," he said, "telling you, 'I had this happen to 
me.' The kids are still going to use it. They'll say, 'Well, I'm not that 
person. I'm somebody different.' 
</P>
<P>
"If you can say to yourself, 'I like looking like this, I like my breath to 
smell like this, I like to act like this,' then do it. You're not going to hurt 
nobody but yourself. And you are going to end up dead." 
</P>
<P>
A high school wrestler in his New York days, Smith started playing football in 
his senior year at Northeastern High in Elizabeth City, N.C. He caught on 
quickly enough, both on the defensive line and as a tailback, to win Parade 
magazine All-American honors. 
</P>
<P>
He moved on to Alabama for three years and played in three bowl games, 
including the 1985 Aloha Bowl, in which Alabama beat USC, 24-3. 
</P>
<P>
When Bill Curry replaced Steve Sloan as Alabama's coach in 1987, the 6-foot-5, 
248-pound Smith became unhappy with the new system and began looking elsewhere. 
In 1988, Rip Scherer left Alabama to become an assistant coach at Arizona, and 
Smith soon followed. 
</P>
<P>
He first had to attend Tucson's Pima Community College to become academically 
eligible. 
</P>
<P>
But since arriving at Arizona, Smith has been "a model citizen," according to 
Coach Dick Tomey. 
</P>
<P>
On the field, Smith leads the Wildcats' defensive linemen in tackles with 64 
and is a co-leader in sacks with five. 
</P>
<P>
But more important, he has been consistent, he said, in his determination to 
stay drug-free. 
</P>
<P>
"If anybody is around me (who wants to use drugs)," Smith said, "I either leave 
or they have to go." 
</P>
<P>
He just smiles at his weekly battles on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"They can do all they want," he said, "but they can't kill me. Physically, one 
on one, nobody can beat me fighting because that's what I grew up doing." 
</P>
<P>
Having taken such a jagged road to get this far, where would Smith like to go 
from here -- pro ball? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah if I got a chance, I'd play," he said. "But I'm not going to die if I 
don't." 
</P>
<P>
His past still returns, sometimes in the middle of the night. 
</P>
<P>
One persistent dream forces Smith to relive the frightening day he took drugs 
and started hallucinating that bugs were crawling over him. Frantically trying 
to scratch them off, he opened cuts all over his face with his fingernails. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he plans to open his own drug rehab clinic someday. 
</P>
<P>
As for drug dealers, he has a solution for them. 
</P>
<P>
"If anybody in my family ever, ever overdoses on something," he said, "I'm 
going to find that drug dealer and kill him. If they can live with that, it's 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
Smith has channeled his aggressive feelings toward drug dealers into football. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't enjoy the game as much as I like the hitting," he admitted. "I like to 
bang. I like to hurt people. I like people to hit me. That's a good feeling. I 
used to do crimes because I liked the feeling. It's a euphoric feeling. 
</P>
<P>
"I like going out on the football field because I have a lot of feelings from 
my past, and that's the only way I can let them go. I can't go in and punch my 
teacher in the face. But I can hit somebody wearing a face mask." 
</P>
<P>
Talking about his past brings out those feelings. He has put drugs and his 
previous environment behind. But not the bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have a Christmas until I was 16 years old," he said. "And that's sad. 
It kind of hurts to think that I missed so much."

YOUNGBLOOD RUNS, PASSES CARSON PAST BANNING, 41-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Armin Youngblood completed 12 of 21 passes for 254 yards and three touchdowns 
to lead Carson to a 41-0 victory over Banning Thursday night before a national 
TV audience and an estimated 12,000 fans at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Carson has five consecutive victories over its neighborhood rival, including a 
55-7 win in last season's City 4-A Division championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Banning controlled Carson's short passing game early, forcing the Colts to work 
on the ground late in the second quarter. In a six-play, 50-yard drive, 
Youngblood gained 32 yards on consecutive runs, setting up a five-yard 
touchdown run by Abdul Muhammed. 
</P>
<P>
On the next Carson possession, senior wide receiver Michael Ross caught 
Youngblood's 24-yard touchdown pass to make it 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, who holds most of Carson's season and career receiving records, caught 
four passes for 104 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The Colt defense, led by All-American linebacker Nkosi Littleton and lineman 
Marcus Long, held Banning and its standout senior quarterback, John Ma'ae, to 
19 yards in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Banning's comeback hopes received a major blow on the last play in the first 
half, when Ma'ae injured a knee. Ma'ae, who completed four of five passes for 
35 yards, was removed from the field on a stretcher and taken to Long Beach 
Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Youngblood and Ross hooked up on a 19-yard touchdown pass play in the third 
quarter, and Michael Jefferson's two-yard scoring run in the same period made 
it 28-0. 
</P>
<P>
That was increased in the fourth quarter, Youngblood connecting with Tydus 
Winans on a 44-yard touchdown pass play, and linebacker Mathew Faraimo scoring 
on a 12-yard fumble recovery. Carson improved to 7-1; Banning is 6-2-1.

REISBIG QUITS AS COACH OF LONG BEACH FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Larry Reisbig, who has a 10-23 record in three seasons as football coach at Cal 
State Long Beach, resigned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something that had to be done," Reisbig said before telling the 49er 
players of his decision. He will coach the team in its final two games of the 
season against Cal State Fullerton Saturday and Utah State on Nov. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Corey Johnson said he hopes a new coach will be hired by 
mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
Reisbig and Johnson have had several recent meetings, but Reisbig said, "Nobody 
ever talked to me about being fired." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers are 3-7 overall and 1-4 in the Big West Conference. They have given 
up an average of 35.8 points a game, and their only victory over another 
Division I-A team was against winless New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a rough three years," said Reisbig, 4-7 in 1987 and 3-9 last season. 
</P>
<P>
A former 49er assistant, Reisbig, 48, came to Long Beach from Pasadena City 
College on Dec. 24, 1986. He replaced Mike Sheppard, who left for the 
University of New Mexico during a time when Long Beach almost dropped football 
because of a financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Football was saved by a $300,000 fund drive, but the uncertainty cost the 49ers 
their recruiting season. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Johnson, Reisbig wrote: "Many of the obstacles were overcome. At 
the same time we have been trying to fight with our hands tied behind our backs 
in many ways." 
</P>
<P>
Reisbig said Thursday, "I'd like to say more but I'm not going to, not for a 
while." 
</P>
<P>
Money problems forced the 49ers to travel the last three seasons to play 
big-name teams such as Michigan, Oregon and UCLA, absorbing lopsided defeats in 
exchange for lucrative guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
Scholarships were increased to 70, or 20 more than in 1987, and Reisbig said 
before this season, "We're competitive, we're going to scare a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
But when many of the better players were injured, the season fell apart 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"The most devastating thing has been the injuries," Reisbig said. "We have 24 
scholarship athletes who can't play. That will take the heart and soul out of 
any program." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson remains committed to building a strong program. "We'd like to do a 
better job in recruiting high school players," he said, alluding to a roster 
with a predominance of community college transfers. "We always needed to fill 
holes." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, the 49ers are 50-54 and have had only one winning season in the 
last five years. The crowds at Veterans Stadium, which has stands on only one 
side and seats 12,500, have been the smallest among Division I-A schools. The 
average for three games this season is 3,000.

</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: CAMP KILPATRICK TURNS JUVENILE DELINQUENTS INTO BALLPLAYERS IN HOPES 
THEY WILL BECOME CONSTRUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Morris (Mo) Freedman coaches the unbeaten Camp Kilpatrick Mustangs, who play 
eight-man high school football and do all the things other players do except go 
home after practice. 
</P>
<P>
That's because the Mustangs are certified juvenile delinquents, first-time 
offenders incarcerated for five or six months at the fenced-in county facility 
in the rugged Santa Monica Mountains above Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Freedman, starting center on UCLA's Rose Bowl winner in 1966 and coach at 
Encino Crespi High in 1975-76, is trying to take hooligans -- mostly gang 
members who have never played football or worked within a system -- and turn 
them into good citizens by "teaching them the values and work ethics of 
athletics," he said one day recently before practice. 
</P>
<P>
It's still too early to tell if the football program -- in its second year -- 
will accomplish its goals over a long period of time, but early results are 
dramatic. The return rate for nonplaying offenders at the camp is 75%, but 
nearly all 24 members of last year's team have stayed out of trouble. Only two, 
including one of the stars, have been rearrested, and one player was killed in 
an apparent drug-related homicide. 
</P>
<P>
Freedman, 44, sees irony in the camp's football program. The recent antisocial 
acts committed by mainstream area high school football players -- criminal 
charges filed against them range from assault to kidnaping -- seem to suggest 
that some football programs "are doing the opposite of what we want to do," 
Freedman said. 
</P>
<P>
Freedman is so keyed up about that role reversal that he used it in a recent 
pregame pep talk. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fabulous information for our kids to know," he said. "For the first time 
in their lives, they're acting normally and normal kids are acting 
irrationally." 
</P>
<P>
But the transition from gang member to disciplined team player isn't smooth for 
the players or the coaches at Camp Kilpatrick. The team consists of drug 
dealers, street fighters, petty thieves, tough guys who never took orders from 
anybody, "The Dirty Dozen" in the making. They're wild, potentially dangerous, 
previously incorrigible and, Freedman said, experts at avoiding responsibility 
and commitment. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a lot of energy to coach them," he said. "They can be very 
manipulative." 
</P>
<P>
The players, who have all volunteered to play, arrive in June or July and are 
put into dorms with the rest of the 100 or so inmates. Their heads are shaved, 
they are issued standard gray sweat shirts and blue pants, and they are taught 
to march single-file across the enclosed grounds, hands clasped behind their 
back. To be eligible to play CIF football, the players -- none of whom have 
achieved their actual grade levels -- attend class and have to maintain a 2.0 
average. 
</P>
<P>
The team dresses in a dark gym with no lockers, benches or showers. Equipment 
is secondhand, some donated by UCLA and Canyon High in Santa Clarita, or bought 
with money provided by the NFL Alumni Assn. and the Malibu Optimists Club. 
</P>
<P>
The first football practice is memorable, partly because Freedman has to start 
with "this is a football" basics. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very reluctant to accept coaching," Freedman said. "They consider it 
criticism. Any time an adult raises his voice to them, they think they're being 
scolded. And, if you want to show them how to do something, you can't put your 
hands on them. They don't react well to that." 
</P>
<P>
Before teaching them to work together, Freedman and his assistants -- Howard 
Gold, Sean Porter and Alex Williams -- have to defuse the tensions among rival 
gang members. 
</P>
<P>
"We eliminate the gang mentality," Freedman said. "We tell them, 'You are now 
part of this program. You are now Mustangs. Expectations of you are very high.' 
That's something they've never heard before." 
</P>
<P>
Freedman also tells the players that there is no backing out. They are Mustangs 
for the duration. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these kids operate on the sour-grape principle of life," he said. 
"They'd want to get kicked off the team just to say they don't care. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first season, we kicked off three starters because their behavior wasn't 
acceptable. That's not what we wanted to do this year. We told the players, 
'You cannot quit or be kicked off.' They'd never completed anything in their 
lives, but they would complete this." 
</P>
<P>
Last year's team was 7-2-1 and made the Southern Section playoffs, and this 
year's team has also made the playoffs and will play at Templeton tonight in 
the first round. 
</P>
<P>
But Freedman won't ever be able to build on a previous team's success. Unless a 
player gets arrested again and winds up back at Kilpatrick, the Mustangs will 
never have returning lettermen or senior experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Even getting a kid to get into the proper football stance is a job," Freedman 
said. "I'm embarrassed to say this, but in our fourth or fifth game this year, 
one of our players ran into the punt returner, who had signaled for a fair 
catch. It wasn't a malicious thing. He just didn't know the rule and it had 
never dawned on us to explain it. 
</P>
<P>
"We had another kid, an offensive lineman, who couldn't distinguish between 
pass and run until our third game." 
</P>
<P>
Freedman measures progress in inches. "Any improvement they make is a quantum 
leap that is exhilarating to see," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At UCLA, Freedman didn't emerge as a starter until Tommy Prothro became coach 
in 1965. Prothro was able to reach Freedman, who had been an "angry kid" 
growing up in West L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"Tommy showed me how a good coach could affect your life," he said. "I could 
see what it did to me." 
</P>
<P>
Freedman decided to leave regular high school coaching in 1980 and work with 
troubled kids. "I thought it would be a nice change for me," he said. "I found 
I was able to relate well and deal with delinquents. I could confront them in a 
non-threatening way." 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, he was working at Central Juvenile Hall and was able to transfer to 
Kilpatrick -- much closer to his Woodland Hills home -- because the camp needed 
an experienced coach. He also works at the camp as a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this season, Freedman and the other coaches pulled out all 
the cliches: Work hard in practice to succeed in games. Take pride in yourself 
and the team. The team is No. 1. Football is a metaphor for life. 
</P>
<P>
The players were skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't think it would work," said defensive tackle Wayne Edwards, who was 
sent to probation camp for strong-armed robbery. But the results surprised 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs' first win of the season was an opening-game 80-0 blowout against 
La Verne Lutheran, but the game that made them believe the cliches -- and in 
themselves -- was a 48-46 win over Brentwood High, the defending Southern 
Section Eight-Man Large Division champion that eliminated Kilpatrick from last 
year's playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Mustangs (8-0) are Big Men in Camp -- role models for the younger 
inmates -- and genuine team players. 
</P>
<P>
Curt Amundson, Kilpatrick's sports director who began a similar basketball 
program five years ago at the camp, has always had trouble scheduling 
opponents, for obvious reasons: Expose our kids to troublemakers? Are you 
kidding? They'd steal us blind, probably cheat and play dirty. 
</P>
<P>
But Amundson credits Faith Baptist and Brentwood with taking chances on the 
Mustangs, who didn't let the camp down. 
</P>
<P>
"Their kids are very polite, say 'Yes, sir,' and 'No, sir,' don't talk back to 
the officials and leave the locker room spotless," Brentwood's Coach Pat Brown 
said. "Last year, when we beat them in the playoffs, the majority of their kids 
had tears in their eyes. These are street kids, but they cared." 
</P>
<P>
Football will end soon for the players and they will leave Kilpatrick, heading 
back to the streets. Will the lessons stay with them? 
</P>
<P>
"Our lives have been turned upside down," Edwards said. "All of us have the 
attitude now that we can do whatever we want. The gang (members) want to take 
this opportunity they've given us. It's time to stop messing around."

Tayon Blockman, a star quarterback even at 5-foot-6, has averaged three 
touchdowns a game and more than 11 yards a carry. Recently he ran for 252 yards 
in Kilpatrick's 41-30 win over Faith Baptist. With a year of high school 
eligibility left, he is "looking forward to finishing," said Blockman, who was 
sent to camp for selling drugs.

"I know I have the ability to play sports and that's what I want to do," he

Blaming the kicker: UCLA's once-automatic kicker, Alfredo Velasco, has watched 
his season go up in flames as the Bruins have lost four consecutive games for 
the first time since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
The events are not unrelated, Coach Terry Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to see one little thread that has been intertwined with our 
demise, you'd have to point very, very emphatically to the failure of our 
kicking game," Donahue said. "It has been catastrophic in almost every game." 
</P>
<P>
In UCLA's last four games: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Velasco pulled a 36-yard field-goal attempt wide to the left in the second 
quarter of a 42-7 loss to Arizona -- his first miss inside 40 yards in 31 
career attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He pushed a 40-yard first-quarter attempt wide to the right in the first 
quarter of an 18-17 loss to Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He pushed a 34-yard attempt wide to the right in the second quarter of a 
28-27 loss to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He had a 37-yard attempt blocked by Stanford's Kevin Scott last week in the 
third quarter of a 17-14 loss to the Cardinal. 
</P>
<P>
Velasco, successful on 20 of 24 field-goal attempts two seasons ago and 17 of 
19 last season, has made only 11 of 17 this season. 
</P>
<P>
As he walked off the field last Saturday at Stanford, Velasco told a reporter 
that he hasn't lost confidence in himself, but the statistics don't look that 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Too Farr to go?: Mike Farr needs nine receptions in UCLA's last two games to 
overtake Mike Sherrard as the Bruins' all-time leader, but the senior split end 
from Birmingham, Mich., has averaged fewer than three receptions a game this 
season. JERRY CROWE

SCIENCE GETS BOOST FROM SUPERCOMPUTERS; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: SUPERCOMPUTERS ARE SUBSTITUTING AS LABORATORIES TO STUDY COMPLEX OR 
INACCESSIBLE PHENOMENA OF NATURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Inside the world's fastest computers, rows of sweet summer corn are being 
attacked by insects. Thunderstorms are brewing. Hearts are beating. And stars 
are colliding. 
</P>
<P>
Although they undulate with energy and follow the laws of nature, none of these 
activities are real. The insects and thunderstorms are nothing more than 
numbers and equations rushing through the processors of a Cray-2 or ETA10 Model 
E supercomputer. 
</P>
<P>
Yet to a growing number of academic and industrial scientists, the colliding 
stars and beating hearts are real enough. More and more, supercomputers are 
being used as laboratories in which to simulate and study complex or 
inaccessible phenomena, such as the churning innards of a storm or the onset of 
a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
"The supercomputer allows us to do experiments that would be extremely 
cumbersome, if not impossible, to do in the lab," said Art Winfree, a biologist 
at the University of Arizona who is trying to understand the process of cardiac 
arrest by doing computer experiments at the John von Neumann National 
Supercomputing Center at Princeton, one of five such facilities supported by 
the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Like most scientists using supercomputers, Winfree has not abandoned studying 
real life. But he has found that by using a supercomputer, he can examine in 
minute detail the swirling bioelectrical vortex thought to be responsible for 
the onset of ventricular fibrillation in heart muscle, the irregular 
contractions that precede a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
Doing the same studies in a human heart is not yet possible. Doing the same 
simulations on Apple or IBM personal computers, instead of a supercomputer, 
would take centuries or longer. 
</P>
<P>
The supercomputers are so big and so fast that for the first time researchers 
can simulate such feats as the head-on collision of superdense neutron stars 
and the intertwining of cosmic strings. They can simulate black holes and drop 
matter into them. They can watch model galaxies spew jets of gas into 
interstellar space. 
</P>
<P>
On a more practical level, supercomputers can be used to make a better ice-cube 
tray by enabling designers to understand how hot plastic fills a mold. 
Engineers can design better bridges by investigating how cracks propagate 
through different materials. 
</P>
<P>
David Onstad of the Illinois Natural History Survey has studied the population 
dynamics of insects. At the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at 
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Onstad recently simulated the 
intricate life histories of a tiny beetle that infests grain silos. On the 
supercomputer's circuits, as in the real world, the beetle was attacked by 
microorganisms and subjected to cannibalism. By doing the millions of 
computations necessary, the supercomputer allowed Onstad to understand how 
beetle populations over hundreds of days are controlled by disease and 
predators. 
</P>
<P>
The supercomputer's speed and memory are the sources of its allure. 
Calculations that would take months or years on the ubiquitous work station can 
be done in minutes or hours on a supercomputer. Onstad, for example, recently 
simulated how a population of European corn borers changed over 25 years. The 
program took only hours to run through the supercomputer, though reviewing the 
data and presenting it took several more months. 
</P>
<P>
The machines achieve their speed by doing many calculations simultaneously, a 
trick called "vector processing," in which several rows or "vectors" of 
equations are attacked by the computer at the same time. Even faster computers 
are now being produced that do "parallel processing." Compared to these new 
machines, ordinary computers are electronic dullards -- doing their work 
step-by-step, completing one task before moving on to the next. 
</P>
<P>
This ability to do so many calculations gives Robert Wilhelmson, a 
meteorologist at the University of Illinois, the ability to simulate severe 
thunderstorms within a computer. Into the supercomputer, Wilhelmson feeds the 
basic equations that describe how fluids are transported and clouds are formed. 
He then gives the computer some other basic parameters, such as temperature and 
moisture. Then he simply turns the program on. 
</P>
<P>
"We can use the computer to study the dynamics of the storm, and we can see 
things that we can't observe in the real world because things are happening too 
fast or they're too hard to sort out," said Wilhelmson. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Wilhelmson confesses that he is fascinated by the images that the 
supercomputer and its advanced software can create. While most scientists are 
eager to show visitors their slides and graphs, Wilhelmson preserves his 
experiments on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
On his tape, a small cloud gathers strength and grows in size, forming broad 
shoulders and then becoming dark and threateningly anvil-shaped. As the video 
runs, and while Wilhelmson stops and starts and rewinds the tape, the simulated 
thunderstorm shows how updrafts and downdrafts influence the storm and how wind 
circulates inside the cloud. 
</P>
<P>
Wilhelmson believes that being able to visualize the computer simulation is 
crucial to understanding the experiments. "You are producing gigabits of data," 
he said, referring to the supercomputer's capacity to perform functions 
involving billions of individual digits. "So much data is coming out of the 
computer that we have to be able to move it around and make sense of it. You 
have to find some order in all this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To deal with the volume of data, scientists have turned to artists and software 
engineers to produce three-dimensional graphics of the research. Much of this 
software was first developed by technicians working in the entertainment and 
advertising industries. Indeed, some of the most advanced software programs 
come from the people who produced movies loaded with special effects. 
</P>
<P>
"These visual images allow us to extract scientific knowledge that is hidden in 
all these data," said Karl-Heinz Winkler, deputy director of the National 
Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois. Winkler 
said this visual information, not numbers that a computer can understand, are 
at the heart of understanding phenomena such as thunderstorms and stellar 
collisions. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some researchers worry that the pretty pictures generated by computers 
do not always tell the whole story. "A lot of the complex computer graphics you 
see are closer to art than to science," said Donna Cox, an assistant professor 
and artist at the University of Illinois who works with scientists to create 
images of their computer-generated experiments that are both accurate and 
insightful. 
</P>
<P>
"There's more computers around, and more scientists are bowing and scraping 
before them and believing what comes out of them as if they were some kind of 
oracle," said Winfree. "You have to remember that 90 percent of what comes out 
of a supercomputer is junk. You have to remember it's a tricky business. You 
have to be careful."

BOOKS: WHEN CAROLYN HEILBRUN CREATED HER DETECTIVE 25 YEARS AGO, SHE WAS AFRAID 
SHE WOULD BE FOUND OUT BY COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS. TODAY SHE'S A

Kate Fansler, erudite detective, does not actually exist. Wealthy, brainy, 
witty, willowy, prone to putting aside her duties as a tenured professor of 
literature at a very Columbia-like university just long enough to solve the 
occasional murder -- how could she be real? She lives and offers her sardonic 
observations on the world only in the pages of mysteries by Amanda Cross. 
</P>
<P>
Who does not actually exist either. Cross, elegant mystery author, sells quite 
respectably for the genre, has won the Nero Wolfe award and been nominated for 
the prestigious Edgar, and recently published the ninth novel in the Fansler 
series, "A Trap for Fools." For years, readers wondered who she was, unaware 
that there is no Amanda Cross except on book jackets. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Carolyn Heilbrun, a distinguished professor of literature at 
Columbia and an influential feminist critic, is entirely real. Being real, she 
found herself, in 1963 at age 37, pressed on every side: teaching a full course 
load, seeking tenure, sharing her university office with colleagues and her 
Riverside Drive apartment with a husband, three children under the age of 8 and 
a dog. "You're just never alone," she recalls, in the now-familiar lament of 
what was then a rarer species, the hyphenated woman. "I felt I had very little 
time of my own." 
</P>
<P>
Worse luck, she was running out of the English mysteries she'd taken refuge in 
for years. That was when Heilbrun invented Kate Fansler and, fearing possible 
retaliation by the tenure-granters at Columbia, the pseudonym Amanda Cross. 
"This is all hindsight," Heilbrun says, "but looking back, this was a space of 
my own." As she wrote years later, "I sought to create an individual whose 
destiny offered more possibility than I could comfortably imagine for myself." 
</P>
<P>
It is a fitting time for hindsight, this 25th anniversary of her first Fansler 
tale. Women have long been mystery writers (consider Agatha Christie, Ngaio 
Marsh, Ruth Rendell, P.D. James) but when "In the Last Analysis" was published 
in 1964, there'd been a historic dearth of female protagonists. "With the great 
male writers -- Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, Ross MacDonald -- the women 
were either bitches or the women they loved," Heilbrun says. "One of the things 
that makes me feel very good is the number of women detectives there are now. 
Women police detectives. Lesbian detectives." 
</P>
<P>
Trend in Mysteries 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the great influx of women writers and characters is one of the 
unmistakable trends in contemporary mysteries. Roughly 40% of the membership of 
the Mystery Writers of America is female. A group called Sisters in Crime, 
formed three years ago to promote women practitioners of the art, has grown 
from 30 members (including Amanda Cross) to more than 500. Its president, 
novelist Nancy Pickard, is among those who call Cross "something of a mentor, 
literally or figuratively, for a lot of women mystery writers. . . . When my 
turn came, there had been this person there first." 
</P>
<P>
Heilbrun says she "had no noble ends in mind" in 1963, however. Begetting Prof. 
Fansler was a hoot. "All detectives are fantasy figures in a sense," says 
Heilbrun. This fantasy figure was roughly Heilbrun's age and shared her 
profession, her astringent humor, her interest in social issues. She had an 
Upper West Side apartment that probably didn't look terribly different from 
Heilbrun's -- stuffed furniture in dignified colors, Oriental rugs, paintings 
and the inevitable wall of books, an academic's home. Fansler even shares her 
inventor's willingness to wander onto interesting but tangential conversational 
paths. "I used to be quite thin myself," Heilbrun muses, gray-haired and 
grandmotherly, though not a grandmother, at 63. "But the only way to stay thin 
when you're old is to live on a lettuce leaf, like Jackie Kennedy." 
</P>
<P>
Anyway. Where Fansler differed dramatically was that Heilbrun made her single, 
childless, unencumbered. She gave her beauty because "I wanted to give her 
everything and see what she would do with it." Heilbrun even granted her sleuth 
a trust fund; "you can't have a detective who can't hop on a plane." Although, 
she says thoughtfully, "this question about rich women. . . . They are the most 
conservative, the most backward, the least adventurous." Heilbrun belongs to 
the Cosmopolitan Club, where nearly every woman has money and her husband's 
surname, "which I find simply appalling in this day and age." 
</P>
<P>
Anyway. Heilbrun was sure her department would take a dim view of this sideline 
when she was reviewed for tenure. "It was dangerous as it was; I was suspected 
even then of being a feminist," she says. The name Amanda Cross, combining a 
surname from a Nova Scotia road sign with an Anglophiliac first name and having 
no other significance, sheltered Heilbrun for half a dozen years. Being 
anonymous "was great fun, I now realize," she says. "Secrecy is always a kind 
of power. . . . A sense of power was the last thing a woman was supposed to 
have." 
</P>
<P>
She had one unnerving experience: Her first Fansler mystery was nominated for 
the Mystery Writers of America's Edgar award (after Poe, of course) and 
Heilbrun feared she might win. "It would have just been awful, simply awful," 
she says. "There would've been some attempt to find out who (Cross) was." But 
Cross was spared, and Heilbrun went on writing scholarly works under one name 
and mysteries under the other, on one occasion corresponding with a fellow 
professor-critic under both identities. 
</P>
<P>
Cross had fans from the beginning, not so much for her plots ("not my strongest 
point," she acknowledges) as for her gutsy heroine. "The women that I knew, and 
I myself, were just entranced," says Jane Bakerman, professor of English at 
Indiana State and a scholarly writer on mysteries. "Kate was smart. She held 
down a major job in a major place. She was strong. She was a single woman who 
regarded marriage as a choice, not a destiny. She was vocalizing some of the 
things a number of us had felt or wished for." Bakerman wrote a paper on Cross 
without knowing whom she was. 
</P>
<P>
Cover Is Blown 
</P>
<P>
It was the publication of "Poetic Justice" in 1970 that blew Heilbrun's cover. 
The Fansler novels constitute sociocultural history as well as literate 
entertainment; this time Fansler's university, reeling from the conflicts and 
questions unleashed by a student takeover, was recognizably Columbia. 
Furthermore, a revered but increasingly anachronistic senior faculty member, 
whose graduate student Fansler had been, bore a marked resemblance to 
Columbia's Lionel Trilling, whose graduate student Heilbrun had been. 
</P>
<P>
Heilbrun the emergent feminist never confronted Trilling, but Kate Fansler 
politely told her elder colleague that "I have never found youthful male 
arrogance . . . especially appealing, while you, of course, have." ("There is a 
certain amount of wish fulfillment in all writing," Heilbrun observes, mum on 
the Trillingness of her fictional professor.) 
</P>
<P>
"Poetic Justice" started people poking around. Her associates and friends began 
to guess. One colleague even looked up the pseudonym at the copyright bureau. 
Her children were getting older. "I don't believe in keeping a lot of secrets 
from one's children," she says. And she was, by then, a tenured professor. So, 
"gradually, it leaked out; I let it leak out." 
</P>
<P>
Now, she rather likes being known as Cross, whose mysteries far outsell 
Heilbrun's "Reinventing Womanhood" and "Writing a Woman's Life," among other 
books. The only troubling part of the unmasking is the flackery involved in 
book promotion. "It does worry me how publicity begins, how it snowballs," she 
reflects, then veers back from the detour. "That's just grumbling about how 
awful life is, which you tend to do after 60." 
</P>
<P>
Older, Pricklier 
</P>
<P>
Kate Fansler, over the course of nine novels, has grown older and pricklier as 
well, though Heilbrun notes that "she's not aging at the same rate as normal 
human beings." Fansler wed, though did not adopt the surname of, a wry attorney 
from the D.A.'s office. "I did not want her to get married, but she got into 
this relationship and relationships have momentum," Heilbrun explains. "But 
she'll never have children, I promise you that." Over the years, too, "the 
importance of other women in her life, women's bonds, women's friendships, has 
grown." 
</P>
<P>
In this she resembles her creator, who believes that "if we have individuals 
who climb up and pull the ladder after them, this feminist wave will end like 
the others." Heilbrun, "a feminist of a generation that produced very few of 
them," was the token woman in virtually every arena she entered for years. But 
this has changed: "The wealth of wonderful women I now know -- all of them 
younger, of course -- it's one of the miracles of life." She points out that, 
by the by, when women writers envision utopias, they are frequently all-female. 
"Men don't invent all-male utopias, and the reason, of course, is that they 
have utopia here." But she digresses. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of miracles, Heilbrun has been married to her economist-husband since 
she was a 19-year-old Wellesley student, another "enormous secret" for years 
lest other young women consider similarly premature commitment. It was the 
Second World War, she tries to explain. "You didn't go to bed with people the 
way people do today." Pause. "Today is much better." Fansler, known to have 
lovers here and there, would no doubt agree. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, Heilbrun thinks she ought to write something different, fiction 
without Fansler. She's even given it a halfhearted try. "Doesn't work," she's 
found; she's stuck with, as Fansler's husband once fondly called her, "a sort 
of overage Nancy Drew." 
</P>
<P>
"She haunts me. She's there," Heilbrun says with a confessional shrug. "I like 
her."

<P>
GENEALOGY: EVERY DAY, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SEEKING THEIR ROOTS PORE OVER THE 
EXTENSIVE GLOBAL RECORDS IN THE MORMON CHURCH'S FAMILY HISTORY LIBRARY.

<P>
For more than a decade Paul Isaacson has labored to save the souls of his dead 
ancestors, patiently searching miles of microfilm and stacks of catalogues in 
the Mormon Church's Family History Library. 
</P>
<P>
Mormon missionary work isn't limited to the living, and each day thousands of 
the faithful flock to the library, the world's largest repository of 
genealogical records, to fulfill the church's determination to baptize every 
person who ever lived. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something spiritual to it," said Isaacson, a Mormon who often devotes 
his days off and evenings to genealogical research. "Also, it's your roots, 
your family. It's kind of like a mystery, trying to track someone down. It's a 
puzzle to be solved." 
</P>
<P>
But as the popularity of tracing one's roots has grown, the Family History 
Library of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has become a prime 
resource for non-Mormon professional and amateur genealogists. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 3,000 people who use the library each day, about 40% are non-Mormon, 
said Tom Daniels, the library's director of information. Often they come by the 
busload in tours organized by genealogical societies from throughout the United 
States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent survey, conducted in the winter of 1988, indicated that senior 
citizens made up about 40% of the library's users -- a figure consistent with 
other surveys of recent years, Daniels said. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors also make up the majority of about 250 church volunteers who supplement 
the library's 200 full-time staff members. Daniels said the seniors are 
"called," or asked by the church to work at the library for a limited time. 
</P>
<P>
Use of the library is free, and those who come have access to birth and death 
records of an estimated 1.5 billion to 2 billion people, culled from the 
archives of about 100 nations. 
</P>
<P>
Business is sufficiently brisk that the church's genealogical department, which 
operates the library, has outgrown a three-story building constructed five 
years ago across the street from the Salt Lake Temple in downtown Salt Lake 
City. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the department's divisions are housed in an office building a block 
away, and the library will expand to occupy a portion of the old Hotel Utah, 
which is being renovated to house a chapel and administrative offices. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels said library usage has increased 60% since 1984 -- the greatest period 
of growth since the early 1970s, when Alex Haley's book "Roots" turned 
thousands of people to genealogy as a hobby. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels said he cannot explain the latest surge in genealogical activity. The 
church has always encouraged its members to research their ancestry and submit 
names of their forebears to temples, where such ordinances as baptism are 
performed by living proxies. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent years more people have been taking advantage of the archives, and 
that may have induced more church members to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
"Why the large number of non-Mormons are coming, I don't know. Maybe it's just 
a natural increase in hobbyists," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mormons believe that spirits of dead people should have the opportunity to 
accept Mormonism in the afterlife. Members are encouraged to have the faith's 
ordinances performed for all their ancestors in the hope that they will embrace 
the faith. 
</P>
<P>
The doctrinal injunction for genealogical work is strong. The church's founder, 
Joseph Smith, told his followers more than 100 years ago, "The greatest 
responsibility in this world that God has lain upon us is to seek after our 
dead." 
</P>
<P>
The church has taken Smith's charge seriously. About 200 photographers are 
regularly dispatched overseas to photograph records of birth, death and census 
records in any country that will permit it. 
</P>
<P>
Records have been copied extensively in Europe. More recently the collection 
effort has shifted to Latin America and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
For eight years church photographers have been copying Chinese records, 
including some lines that reach back more than 1,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
"They're far superior, far more accurate, than European records," Daniels said. 
"In Oriental records, 65 generations (of continuous record-keeping) are not 
uncommon. In Europe, you're lucky to find 10." 
</P>
<P>
To ensure that nothing is lost, master copies of the microfilm are kept in the 
church's Granite Mountain Records Vault, carved deep into a mountainside about 
20 miles southeast of Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Designed to withstand a nuclear explosion, the vault features an 
archive-quality air filtering system, a complete microfilm processing 
laboratory and six storage rooms, each 200 feet long and 25 feet high.

"There's nothing comparable to the library in terms of its comprehensive 
nature," said Jay Hall, director of Global Research, a Salt Lake City-based

"There's a vast amount of interest," Hall said. "A lot of people think it's 
totally fascinating to learn about their ancestors. It gives them a feeling of 
heritage. For the professional, the most important thing is to have the 
detective feeling.

THE SWEET SMELL OF GIORGIO'S SUCCESS; 
</P>
<P>
'REEKING HAVOC' LOOKS AT THE MAKING AND UNMAKING OF PERFUME EMPIRE 
</P>

The saga of Giorgio Beverly Hills perfume, arguably the most successful 
fragrance of the decade, goes on. From the beginning, the tale has been almost 
too schmaltzy to be true, the type that soap operas are built on. It's a story 
with a beginning but no end, told so many times already that even its star 
players refuse to talk about it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
But author and journalist Steve Ginsberg, whose book on the subject, "Reeking 
Havoc, the Unauthorized Story of Giorgio " is in stores this week, expects to 
attract a wide readership based on "the powerful personalities involved" and 
the fact that "two people without college degrees could hit a home run twice. 
First with the boutique and then with the perfume." 
</P>
<P>
The Rodeo Drive boutique captured national attention when it was used as a 
location in "Scruples," the 1980 TV miniseries based on Judith Krantz's 
blockbuster novel set in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
But "Havoc" reaches back to a time before there was a Giorgio -- store or 
fragrance -- tracing the development of Fred and Gale Hayman, the names behind 
the phenomenon, from Beverly Hills hotelier and cocktail waitress to retail 
wizards to perfume magnates who anointed the wrists of the world with their 
heady, $100 million product. 
</P>
<P>
Ginsberg also covers the couple's divorce and the infighting that led to the 
sale of Giorgio to Avon Cosmetics in 1987 for $165 million. 
</P>
<P>
The West Coast bureau chief of Women's Wear Daily, Ginsberg describes his 
version of the events as "essentially a business story." And he says it was his 
boss, WWD editor Michael Coady, who encouraged him to write it. 
</P>
<P>
But Krantz isn't so sure about the book's broad appeal. She scanned it before 
it was officially released this week, and says "Maybe fashion mavens and the 
perfume industry will be interested, but it's not for the mass market. It's a 
story of dividing up assets." 
</P>
<P>
Let's face it, suggests Herb Fink about the saga, "it wasn't the downfall of 
the Roman Empire." Fink is Chairman of the Rodeo Drive Committee and owner of 
the Theodore boutique just up the street from Giorgio. He had a bird's-eye view 
of the story as it happened. In retrospect, he says, "their timing was good, 
the perfume worked, but I don't see them as celebrities." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the book, Ginsberg cites his leading characters' differing points of 
view. (Fred wasn't interested in creating a perfume, Gale was. Fred didn't want 
to sell the company, Gale did.) But he leaves it up to the reader to 
distinguish the good guys from the bad guys, if there are any. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no saints and sinners," he concludes. "They were all a little crazy, 
and still are." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Hayman refused to be interviewed for the book, or most media accounts of 
the rise of Giorgio. And he still refuses to talk. "He prefers to dwell on the 
positives of today and the future rather than the negatives of the past," his 
spokesperson explains. 
</P>
<P>
Gale Hayman is quoted extensively by Ginsberg, as are David Horner and Jim 
Roth, the perfume-industry consultants who directed the marketing of the 
fragrance as it soared to its No. 1-in-America position. 
</P>
<P>
Horner calls the book, "all steak and no sizzle." Both he and Roth are willing 
to credit Ginsberg only with reporting the basic story. 
</P>
<P>
Gale Hayman's only comment is: "I haven't read the book." 
</P>
<P>
Finally there is Michael Gould, president and CEO of Giorgio Beverly Hills and 
Parfums Stern, who is also included in the book. 
</P>
<P>
He has no comment either, perhaps because investors are trying to buy the 
Giorgio perfume company from Avon. 
</P>
<P>
Ginsberg predicts Giorgio will sell for less than $200 million this year.

EAST GERMANY OPENS BORDERS; WALL HAS 'NO MORE MEANING';

EAST BLOC: THOUSANDS TEST THE NEW POLICY BY CROSSING TO WEST BERLIN. THEY'RE 
WELCOMED WITH CHEERS AND SONG.

EAST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The East German government threw open its borders Thursday and announced that 
its citizens now may travel freely to West Germany. Thousands of jubilant East 
Germans quickly tested the new policy by flocking to the crossing points in 
divided Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
At Checkpoint Charlie, a major crossing point, a huge crowd gathered. As East 
Berliners in small groups made their way through the last barrier to West 
Berlin, the crowds on that side welcomed them with cheers and songs. 
</P>
<P>
East German border guards, who obviously had no instructions on the new border 
policy, generally waved them through with puzzled smiles. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm watching history being made," said one West Berlin bystander. 
</P>
<P>
It was like New Year's Eve or a World Series victory celebration at this and 
other border crossings along the Berlin Wall. Late Thursday and early today, 
hundreds of people climbed atop the grim, grafitti-marred structure, long the 
symbol of the Iron Curtain dividing East and West. Some of them danced for joy 
there. 
</P>
<P>
The new border policy was explained by Politburo member Guenter Schabowski, who 
told a news conference here that East Germans would "promptly" be given permits 
to go to West Germany. He said they could stay there if they wish, or return to 
East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"This means that the Berlin Wall has no more meaning," an East German official 
said Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"The long-awaited day has arrived," declared West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper. 
"The Berlin Wall no longer divides Berlin." 
</P>
<P>
Crowds swarmed through the streets long after midnight, auto horns blared, 
police sirens pierced the air, couples walked hand in hand toward the wall and 
people laughed and smiled, offering each other open wine and beer bottles. 
</P>
<P>
Some East Germans arriving at border crossings at Invalidenstrasse and 
Prinzstrasse in their small, sputtering Trabant autos were almost prevented 
from entering by the crowds gathered to greet them. But they made their way 
through to West Berlin's bright lights. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, many of the East Berliners returned later today to the drab, gray 
Eastern half of the city after sampling the bright lights of the West. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to take a look at the Kurfuerstendamm," said one young man in 
his 20s, as he returned from West Berlin's famous shopping district and headed 
back through the wall to East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
From their side, hundreds of West Berliners crossed into East Berlin, shouting, 
"The wall is gone, the wall is gone!" 
</P>
<P>
A huge crowd gathered next to the Reichstag building at the Brandenburg Gate -- 
the traditional scene of anti-wall demonstrations by West Berliners and the 
place where President John F. Kennedy uttered his famous line, "Ich bin ein 
Berliner." 
</P>
<P>
Many people climbed atop the wall there. At 3 a.m., lights at the gate were 
still blazing as the crowd called out: "Open the gate!" 
</P>
<P>
Beyond Berlin, as one analyst here put it: "This news is deeply significant. It 
changes the whole shape of Europe. It will take a while for the import of this 
to sink in." 
</P>
<P>
In the euphoria of Thursday night, there were few formalities for those surging 
through the checkpoints in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
But beginning this morning, East Germans will be expected under the new open 
policy to get exit visas for travel abroad, whether permanent emigration or 
just a visit. 
</P>
<P>
They will be allowed to go through any crossing point in the Berlin Wall except 
Checkpoint Charlie, which is reserved for foreigners and military personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Whether emigrating or just visiting, they also may enter West Germany through 
the various crossings along the fortified inner-German frontier. 
</P>
<P>
West Germans long have been free to travel to East Germany by simply arriving 
at the border, paying a small fee and exchanging some West German money for 
East German currency. 
</P>
<P>
Schabowski, the spokesman for East Germany's Politburo, was asked about tearing 
down the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
"The opening of the wall does not answer its real purpose," he said. "There is 
still a whole complex of questions that will have to be discussed." 
</P>
<P>
He mentioned the state of the opposing military alliances in Europe -- the 
Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization -- and progress on arms 
control as factors bearing on the ultimate fate of the Wall. 
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, officials said that though East German emigrants are inundating the 
country, West Germany will accept all East Germans arriving there. 
</P>
<P>
"No one will be turned back," Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeuble warned that new arrivals can expect poor housing for a long time to 
come -- in what was seen as an effort to discourage the flood of immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"For this reason," he said, and because of the cold season, every German from 
East Germany should think carefully before they come here." 
</P>
<P>
A session of the West German Parliament broke into the national anthem on 
hearing the news from East Berlin about opening the borders. 
</P>
<P>
Bundestag member Willy Brandt, the former chancellor who was mayor of West 
Berlin in 1961 when the Berlin Wall went up, wept openly. 
</P>
<P>
The stunning news came after another tumultuous day in East Berlin during the 
three-day meeting of the policy-making Communist Party Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee announced Thursday that there will be a special 
Parliament meeting Monday to approve the newly appointed reformist Prime 
Minister Hans Modrow. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee also called a rare meeting of the Communist Party 
Conference for Dec. 15-17 to discuss the economic, political and social crises 
swamping the country. 
</P>
<P>
An economic slowdown has been compounded by the flight of about 225,000 East 
Germans so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
West German estimates of those East Germans wishing to depart range from 
400,000 to 1.2 million -- in a nation of 16.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Travel restrictions helped spark the massive demonstrations that brought East 
Germans out in unprecedented numbers onto the streets of East Berlin, Leipzig, 
Dresden, Halle, Schwerin and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
In his briefing on the lifting of travel restrictions, Schabowski said, "The 
decision was taken that makes it possible for all citizens to leave the country 
through East German crossing points." 
</P>
<P>
Schabowski's announcement seemed almost impromptu: He did not read from the 
prepared text he was given shortly before the briefing and seemed vague about 
some details. 
</P>
<P>
But he indicated that East Germans can take their identity cards to their local 
police station and apply for exit visas. Thus, they would not need passports, 
which not many East Germans have. 
</P>
<P>
The exit visas, Schabowski said, will be issued without red tape or demanding a 
reason for the travel. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, he said those wishing to emigrate would be treated with dispatch. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, Schabowski said, will ease East German relations with Communist 
neighbor Czechoslovakia because emigrants no longer will be forced to pass 
through that country en route to the West. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, some opposition elements in East Berlin did not applaud the 
Communist leaders' decision to open up travel to the West. 
</P>
<P>
Hans-Peter Schneider, a leader of the small opposition group Democratic 
Awakening, declared: "I doubt that it is a step that will keep the people here. 
I would have preferred it if they had said take your passport and get a visa 
and come back to us. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this step is a sign of the helplessness of our leaders." 
</P>
<P>
But for thousands of Germans, it was a sign of hope. 
</P>
<P>
About 2 a.m., an animal trainer walked through Checkpoint Charlie with a big, 
brown muzzled bear on a leash. 
</P>
<P>
"The bear is a symbol of Berlin," he said, "A united Berlin. We are now one 
city." 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't believe we could get out," said one man who crossed with his wife. 
"We just wanted to try it. But we will return." 
</P>
<P>
Most people on foot and in cars appeared to have little baggage with them, 
indicating they planned to go back to the East -- in contrast to those who fled 
through Hungary and Czechoslovakia carrying all their family belongings. 
</P>
<P>
One woman who had been watching the drama for two hours said: "The Vopos (East 
German police) don't know what to do. So they have just been waving people 
through." 
</P>
<P>
Another man said: "A Vopo gave me a cigarette. I am keeping it as a souvenir. 
Ordinarily they would take your picture to put you on the blacklist." 
</P>
<P>
A bearded West Berliner, watching the amazing sight of East Berliners coming 
through the border crossing, said, "It looks like the Berlin Wall is going to 
be a relic -- just like the one in China."

NO QUITTING WARSAW PACT, KREMLIN SAYS

Welcoming East Germany's leadership changes as an important step toward 
political reform, the Soviet Union said Thursday that it will accept a 
non-Communist government there and in other East European countries if they 
remain members of the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
Gennady I. Gerasimov, chief spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry, said 
Moscow adheres to the principle that each nation is free to decide its own 
political system and to elect its own government but that it is concerned that 
European stability be maintained as a guarantee of peace. 
</P>
<P>
His comments significantly extended Moscow's tolerance for political reform 
among its East European allies but at the same time made it clear that the 
East-West balance of power must not be directly altered in the process. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose reforms set in motion many of the 
sweeping changes under way in Eastern Europe, wants to discuss them and their 
implications for international stability when he meets next month with 
President Bush, Gerasimov said. 
</P>
<P>
The relaxed Soviet attitude seems likely to be put to the test in East Germany, 
whose front-line position in the Warsaw Pact makes the changes there even more 
sensitive than they were in Hungary or Poland. But Moscow's resolve to accept 
and even to encourage fast-paced reform in Eastern Europe seems firm. 
</P>
<P>
"These changes are for the better, that is for sure," Gerasimov said, 
commenting on the unprecedented resignation of the entire Politburo of East 
Germany's ruling Communist Party and the replacement of most of its members 
when a new Politburo was formed. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union views all the changes in East Germany as "very important 
decisions" and "a renewal of socialism" there, Gerasimov said. He praised the 
Communist leadership in Berlin for opening a long-delayed dialogue with the 
political opposition and "moving toward perestroika on their own terms" -- a 
reference to the reforms undertaken in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Questioned about the Soviet attitude should a coalition or non-Communist 
government emerge from the open elections the East German leadership is now 
discussing, Gerasimov said Moscow would show the same tolerance as it had when 
a Solidarity-led government took office in Poland earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Poland is a good member of the Warsaw Pact, and in Poland you have a 
coalition, you don't have a Communist government in Poland," Gerasimov said. 
"You see, governments may change, but international obligations remain. . . . 
It's their (East Germany's) decision, just like in Poland. It's their country, 
they know it better. What can we do?" 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev encouraged Egon Krenz, the new East German leader, to broaden and 
accelerate East Berlin's timid attempts at reform when Krenz visited Moscow 
last week. He had earlier seemed to nudge the longtime East German leader, 
Erich Honecker, into retirement, warning his comrades that "history will punish 
those who are late" in implementing reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov, speaking for Gorbachev last month on a visit to Finland, had 
announced what he called the "Sinatra Doctrine" -- a play on Frank Sinatra's 
song, "My Way" -- to reiterate Moscow's abandonment of the 1968 Brezhnev 
Doctrine, which asserted the right of socialist countries to intervene, even 
militarily, in each other's domestic politics if socialism seemed to be 
threatened there. 
</P>
<P>
But on Thursday, Gerasimov firmly rejected widespread Western speculation about 
the possible dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, which groups the Soviet Union and 
its six East European allies, and the future reunification of East and West 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The Warsaw Pact, formed as an answer to the U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization, has "a stabilizing character," Gerasimov said, criticizing what 
he described as Western efforts to "encourage centrifugal tendencies" that 
would pull the alliance apart. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's disband the Warsaw Pact together simultaneously with NATO, and then 
maybe the situation is going to change," he said, reiterating the Warsaw Pact's 
call for dissolution of both alliances on the basis of agreements cutting back 
military forces in Europe. "Then we can review things and discuss everything 
afresh." 
</P>
<P>
Describing East Germany as "a strategic ally" of the Soviet Union because of 
its front-line position in the Warsaw Pact, Gerasimov said that its future as 
an independent state is part of the East-West balance of power in Europe and 
that Moscow is committed to maintaining that balance. 
</P>
<P>
The question of German reunification "cannot be viewed apart from the overall 
situation in Europe, which is still split into two alliances," he said. "If we 
are to be realistic, any unification of Germany is out of the question now." 
</P>
<P>
Discussing the Soviet-American summit meeting, scheduled for Dec. 2 and 3 
aboard warships off the Mediterranean island of Malta, Gerasimov said that one 
of Moscow's goals will be to reach a broad understanding on the sweeping 
political changes under way in Central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbing the summit "From Yalta to Malta," Gerasimov recalled how postwar Europe 
had been effectively divided into spheres of influence and control by President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Josef 
Stalin, the Soviet leader, at the Crimean resort town of Yalta in February, 
1945. But Gerasimov denied that Moscow wants to redraw the map during the 
Bush-Gorbachev meeting at Malta. 
</P>
<P>
"Yalta is a symbol of confrontation," he said. "We are finishing that period 
and coming into a new period of building a common European home."

DENG QUITS LAST POST IN STEP TO TRANSFER POWER 
</P>

<P>
Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, taking a historic step toward a generational 
transfer of power, Thursday turned over the leadership of China's armed forces 
to Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin. 
</P>
<P>
But in a related action that virtually guarantees continued tension at the 
highest levels of Chinese politics, one of Jiang's key rivals, President Yang 
Shangkun, was confirmed as No. 2 in the military hierarchy. Yang's younger 
brother, Yang Baibing, also received important promotions in the military and 
party apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
A four-day meeting of the Communist Party Central Committee, which approved the 
military changes, also endorsed a two-year economic program that mixes policies 
demanded by hard-liners and reformers but breaks little new ground. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a confused picture which reflects the confused state of China today," 
commented a Western diplomat with long experience here, who spoke on condition 
that he not be identified by name. "But anyway, Deng is leaving his post, and 
it reflects the end of a 10-year cycle. We are entering a transition phase." 
</P>
<P>
Deng, 85, consolidated power as China's paramount leader in late 1978, two 
years after the death of Chairman Mao Tse-tung, many of whose radical 
egalitarian policies have been reversed by a decade of market-oriented economic 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Now, by passing to Jiang the chairmanship of the party's Central Military 
Commission, Deng gives up his role as commander in chief of the armed forces -- 
his last formal post. It is widely believed, however, that his prestige and 
residual authority will enable him to continue to be the ultimate arbiter of 
Chinese politics for as long as he is in reasonably good health. 
</P>
<P>
Deng has emphasized repeatedly in recent months that Jiang, who has a record of 
support for moderate economic reform coupled with a hard-line political stance, 
is his personal choice as China's next paramount leader. Jiang's elevation to 
head the military commission is a key step in boosting his power, but his 
position as Deng's chosen heir remains fragile. This is partly because the 
former Shanghai party boss has few ties within the military, while all the 
other key members of the commission are military men. 
</P>
<P>
Both of Deng's previous handpicked successors -- reformers Hu Yaobang and Zhao 
Ziyang -- fell from power when they proved unable to consolidate a strong power 
base in the military and lost favor with Deng and other elderly leaders for 
failing to crack down on student protests. Hu was replaced by Zhao as party 
chief in January, 1987, and Zhao was replaced by Jiang in June of this year. 
</P>
<P>
President Yang, 82, a retired army general who played a key role last June in 
calling in troops to crush pro-democracy protests in Beijing, is generally 
viewed as less firmly committed to market-oriented economic reforms than is 
Jiang, 63. A power struggle between the two could have profound implications 
for China's future. Many observers, however, believe that neither is likely to 
be able to consolidate power after Deng dies and that some other leader will 
probably emerge. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Central Committee plenum, talk among Chinese with access to 
high-level information was that Deng wanted Yang Shangkun to join him in 
stepping down from the military commission and that Jiang would take over as 
head. But Yang, according to these sources, was seeking the chairmanship for 
himself. Thursday's announcement appeared to reflect a compromise that 
reinforces both Jiang and Yang as key contenders for power, but leaves the 
ultimate succession unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
"For Yang, it's a less comfortable position than to be No. 2 under Deng," the 
Western diplomat commented. But at the same time, he said, Jiang is not likely 
to find it easy "to impose his authority on all these military guys." 
</P>
<P>
The chairmanship of the party's military commission is traditionally the most 
powerful position in China. There is also a state Central Military Commission, 
which usually has nearly the same membership and the same leadership. The two 
commissions are believed to function almost as a single body. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter of resignation from the party commission, which was published 
Thursday by the official New China News Agency, Deng said he will also resign 
from the state military commission. The Central Committee decision promoting 
Jiang and Yang suggest that they will be named eventually to the No. 1 and No. 
2 posts on the state commission, but this action can be taken only by the 
National People's Congress. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday evening, state-run television showed a cheerful Deng greeting other 
top leaders after the announcement of his retirement. Deng walked easily but 
showed clear signs of his advanced age, including a facial expression and 
occasionally hesitant manner that could mark the beginnings of senility. 
</P>
<P>
During the pro-democracy demonstrations of last spring, which touched off 
China's continuing political crisis, some students accused Deng of being 
"muddle-headed" and called for him to step down. Yang Shangkun, although only 
three years younger than Deng, appears to be in excellent health. 
</P>
<P>
Deng submitted his resignation in a letter to the policy-setting Politburo 
dated Sept. 4. In it, he says he has been "looking forward to completing the 
succession of the older generation by the younger generation as soon as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
"The fourth plenum of the 13th party Central Committee (in late June) elected a 
leading nucleus headed by Comrade Jiang Zemin and it is now already carrying 
out its work effectively," Deng wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"Our cause of reform and opening to the outside world has just started. We have 
arduous tasks ahead and there will be some twists and turns on our way of 
advance. But I firmly believe that we will be able to overcome various 
difficulties. . . . Since the Chinese people have shown the ability to stand 
up, they will surely have the ability to ever stand firmly among the nations of 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Continued Austerity 
</P>
<P>
The official communique of the Central Committee plenum, which was attended by 
167 full members and 106 alternate members, declared that a year-old program of 
economic austerity should continue for at least another two years. But the 
meeting also emphasized that China will continue to open up more to the outside 
world. 
</P>
<P>
The plenum endorsed attempts to bring inflation down to less than 10%, to 
balance the national budget, to hold average annual economic growth to no more 
than 6% in the next few years and to direct investment toward agriculture, raw 
materials supply and transportation infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
"We must at all times . . . place the constant improvement of economic 
efficiency on the top of the economic work," the communique said. 
</P>
<P>
It said: "It is imperative to continue to persist in the policy of opening to 
the outside world, boldly absorb foreign investment and import advanced 
technology while effectively expanding foreign trade and economic and technical 
exchanges. The basic policies and measures adopted for the special economic 
zones and coastal open regions remain unchanged and will be further perfected 
in practice." 
</P>
<P>
But in a warning to reformist, growth-oriented provincial leaders who have 
sought to exempt their regions from centrally imposed austerity measures, the 
communique declared that "it is imperative to firmly foster the idea of taking 
the whole country as a whole, subordinating the interest of a part to that of 
the whole, strengthen organizational discipline and resolutely oppose 
decentralism." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Speculation on Zhao 
</P>
<P>
There had been widespread speculation that the Central Committee would deal 
with the fate of Zhao, the party chief ousted in June for opposing the 
crackdown, who has been presumed to be under some form of house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Although Zhao was stripped of all his high party positions, including the first 
vice chairmanship of the party's Central Military Commission, the post assumed 
Thursday by Yang Shangkun, he has been allowed to keep his party membership. 
Hard-line leaders including Premier Li Peng have been widely rumored to favor 
putting Zhao on trial. 
</P>
<P>
But the communique made no mention of Zhao. It also made no mention of any 
plans for an intensified purge of Zhao supporters. In the aftermath of the 
crackdown, some close allies of Zhao have been removed from office or 
imprisoned, and several party documents have been published calling for more 
extensive action. But there has not been any sweeping purge of reformists from 
party and government positions. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the plenum appeared to strengthen the influence of the military on 
political affairs. Yang Baibing, 69, a general who had been on the state 
military commission but not the more powerful party military commission, was 
promoted to the party commission. He becomes its secretary general, a post 
previously held by his brother, President Yang. 
</P>
<P>
Yang Baibing was also named to what now becomes the four-member Secretariat of 
the Central Committee, which functions as the executive office of the Communist 
Party. For the past two years, there had been no military representative in the 
Secretariat. 
</P>
<P>
The other key promotion in the military commission went to Liu Huaqing, 73, a 
former commander of the Chinese navy who was named a vice chairman, ranking 
after Yang Shangkun.

EUPHORIC NOTION IN EUROPE: ALMOST ANYTHING POSSIBLE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Thursday's decision by a desperate East German government to throw open its 
long-locked borders constitutes the latest and most dramatic of a dizzying 
series of events that in a few months has transformed the political landscape 
of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
For the continent as a whole, it effectively neutralizes the most horrific 
symbol of its 40-year division -- the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
Demands to tear down the wall that began with President John F. Kennedy 
suddenly no longer apply. 
</P>
<P>
East Germans now can walk through it or around it. 
</P>
<P>
Events in East Germany also raise more urgent questions about the prospects of 
German reunification, the pace of West European unity and the future of the two 
military alliances that preserved a status quo since 1949 and is now crumbling. 
</P>
<P>
Just as the wall evolved as a powerful symbol of division, so does its demise 
carry an equally strong message to all Europeans that -- suddenly -- almost 
anything is possible. 
</P>
<P>
Those who dream of a continent undivided felt their goal a giant step closer to 
reality Thursday as they watched another major chunk of the Iron Curtain fall 
away. 
</P>
<P>
The long-held belief that Moscow would never permit East Germany, the 
westernmost cornerstone of its empire, to spin out of its orbit seems as dated 
as the wall itself. 
</P>
<P>
As millions of East Germans paraded through the streets demanding an end to 
Communist rule, the 350,000 Soviet troops stationed in the country were 
conspicuous only by their absence from sight. 
</P>
<P>
Few European political analysts believe Czechoslovakia can resist pressures for 
similar change much longer. 
</P>
<P>
For East German leader Egon Krenz and the Communist leadership that clings to 
power in East Berlin, the provisional ruling to open the borders is more an act 
of despair than statesmanship. 
</P>
<P>
It is a gamble that effectively gives East Germans their first free election. 
Theoretically at least, all 17 million are now free to vote with their feet as 
have thousands before them under far riskier circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
In a very real way, the volume of those departing in the coming days will 
determine both the fate of Krenz and the viability of the country he leads. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the hemorrhage of refugees began eight weeks ago, East Germany was 
a nation critically short of skilled manpower, saddled with an aging population 
and the world's lowest birthrate. 
</P>
<P>
The 200,000 or so who have left up to this point may be only 1% of the 
population, but they are the young, the healthy, and the skilled who are 
critical to the country's future. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany has long been the only country in the Soviet Bloc that could boast 
of some economic success. 
</P>
<P>
If large numbers of its citizens fail to heed pleas from both East and West 
German leaders to stay and help build a new society, this limited success would 
be seriously jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
Such a development would undoubtedly ripple through other hard-pressed East 
European economies. 
</P>
<P>
For West Germany, as for other members of the Atlantic Alliance, events are 
moving at an unnerving, yet exhilarating pace. The Alliance's long-term 
planners suddenly stare at a set of conditions they believed only a short time 
ago would take at least another decade to arise. 
</P>
<P>
In West Germany, a mixture of elation and disbelief swept the country Thursday 
evening as news broke of the new open border policy. 
</P>
<P>
The euphoria that an era of family divisions seemed at an end was tempered by 
fears that the action would trigger a new wave of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Before the recent flood of East Germans began, West Germany had absorbed nearly 
half a million settlers of German extraction from Eastern Europe as a result of 
relaxed emigration requirements. 
</P>
<P>
While West Germany is the richest nation in the region, it has always been 
plagued with self-doubt about the fragility of its democracy and its ability to 
withstand political instability. 
</P>
<P>
"It is in our interest that they stay," West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
commented. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Kielinger, editor of the respected newspaper Rheinische Merkur, seemed 
to speak for many West Germans who see Thursday's decision as a potential 
watershed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping that this is the turning point that will give East Germans the 
incentive to stay and build their country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For those in Western Europe, Thursday's announcement, coupled with Krenz's call 
for free elections, raises other concerns. 
</P>
<P>
It has brought the prospect of a new and closer relationship between the two 
German states one giant step closer to reality. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl's words to the West German Parliament on Wednesday that "we have less 
reason than ever to be resigned to the long-term division of Germany" seemed 
far truer 24 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
For if the borders remain open and free elections result in a non-Communist 
government, the very existence of two separate German states comes into 
question. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Kohl's protestation that no one need fear a united, democratic Germany, 
Europeans are unsettled about the possibility of such a powerful entity. 
</P>
<P>
While French President Francois Mitterrand bravely reaffirmed his support for 
the German right to reunification, many other Europeans privately applaud the 
words of an earlier Frenchman who said he loved Germany so much that he was 
happy there were two of them. 
</P>
<P>
Those nurturing the European Community's dream of economic and political unity 
worry about West Germany either becoming distracted by events in the east or 
placing a higher priority on its relations with East Germany than with the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Under a French lead, the European Community is already considering accelerating 
the pace of integration among its 12 member states in order to fill the 
political vacuum it sees developing in Central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
How a closer relationship between the two German states might affect the EC's 
drive toward unity remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
But in a week that has seen the mass resignation of the East German Communist 
Party's Central Committee and its Politburo, the West German chancellor hint at 
German reunification in a speech before his Parliament, Krenz throw open the 
country's borders and call for free elections, all followed by a nod of 
approval from Moscow, political analysts have little idea what might come next.

NEWSDAY'S PLATE TO HEAD TIMES EDITORIAL PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas Plate, editorial page editor of New York Newsday, on Thursday was named 
editor of the editorial pages of the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
Plate succeeds Anthony Day, who has held the editorial page post at The Times 
since 1971. Day will become a senior correspondent for The Times, reporting on 
ideas and ideology, their power and effect in the modern world. 
</P>
<P>
Editorial writer Frank del Olmo was named deputy editorial page editor. He 
succeeds Jack Burby, deputy editorial page editor since 1983, who will remain 
an editorial writer. 
</P>
<P>
The changes, which take effect Nov. 20, were announced by David Laventhol, 
publisher and chief executive officer of The Times, and Shelby Coffey III, 
Times editor and executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"Anthony Day and Jack Burby are to be congratulated for their outstanding 
contributions in shaping and broadening the scope of the editorial pages during 
a time of important growth for The Times in readership and influence," 
Laventhol said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased that we're able to bring Tom Plate, an innovative editor and fine 
writer, back to Los Angeles to succeed Tony," he added, noting that Plate is a 
former executive editor and editorial page editor of the Los Angeles Herald 
Examiner. "And I'm particularly gratified Tom is being joined by Frank del 
Olmo, a native Southern Californian and a veteran of 19 years at The Times, to 
be his deputy. It is an outstanding team for the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
Coffey said: "Anthony Day has brought leadership and distinction to The Times 
editorial pages for nearly two decades. In his new assignment, he can be 
expected to make a similarly distinguished mark. 
</P>
<P>
"He and Jack Burby have made a strong team," Coffey said, "and we expect Tom 
Plate and Frank del Olmo to provide equally strong replacements." 
</P>
<P>
Plate, 45, said he was "thrilled to have been offered the job. . . . I'm a big 
fan of the Los Angeles Times and I'm a big fan of Southern California . . . and 
I happen to believe editorial pages are extremely important to a newspaper that 
seeks to be of consequence to the community it serves. . . . I am eager to work 
with the terrific staff that Tony has assembled and continue in his tradition 
to improve on the tremendous achievements that he and his staff have made over 
the years. There is no more important editorial page in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Plate, a novelist and author of nonfiction books, has also served as 
editor-in-chief of Family Weekly, senior editor of Time Magazine, senior editor 
of New York Magazine, founding editor of Newsday's Sunday Ideas section, op-ed 
editor and editorial writer at Newsday, and assistant editor at Newsweek. 
</P>
<P>
He holds a bachelor's degree from Amherst College and a master's degree in 
foreign relations from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International 
Affairs at Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
Before joining The Times as its chief editorial writer in 1969, Day, 56, served 
as chief of the Washington bureau, Washington reporter and general assignment 
reporter for the Philadelphia Bulletin. 
</P>
<P>
He holds a bachelor's degree in classics from Harvard College and was a Nieman 
Fellow at Harvard in 1966-67. 
</P>
<P>
Del Olmo, 41, joined The Times as a reporting intern in 1970, became a staff 
writer specializing in Latino affairs the following year and an editorial 
writer in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
He was a member of the reporting team that won the 1984 Pulitzer Prize gold 
medal for public service for a series of articles on Southern California's 
Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
Del Olmo holds a bachelor's degree in journalism from Cal State Northridge and 
was a Nieman Fellow in 1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
Before coming to The Times in 1978 as an editorial writer, Burby, 65, was a 
federal policy consultant, editor of the National Journal, special assistant to 
U.S. Secretary of Transportation Alan Boyd, press secretary to California Gov. 
Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, and a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle, the 
Honolulu Advertiser and United Press International. 
</P>

STIFF 'NICKEL-A-DRINK' TAX ON ALCOHOL PROPOSED BY COALITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD C. PADDOCK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The state's tax on alcoholic beverages, which has not been increased for 
decades, will skyrocket under a "nickel-a-drink" initiative unveiled Thursday 
by a coalition of alcohol treatment, trauma care and law enforcement groups. 
</P>
<P>
Taking on one of the state's most powerful industries, backers of the tax hike 
said their measure will raise $800 million a year and force drinkers to pay a 
larger share of the state's cost of alcohol-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
"A nickel a drink is not going to harm anybody," said Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Ed Edelman, a leader in the initiative drive. "It's something I 
think we can all live with." 
</P>
<P>
For wine, which has not been subjected to a tax increase in more than 50 years, 
the proposed ballot measure would mean a jump from 1 cent to $1.28 a gallon. 
The tax on beer would rise from 4 cents to 20 cents a gallon. And the tax on 
liquor would go from $2 to $6.40 a gallon. Beer taxes were last raised in 1959; 
liquor taxes were raised in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the alcoholic beverage industry immediately predicted that 
the measure will cost their business $290 million a year in sales and 6,000 
jobs if the measure qualifies for the ballot and is approved by voters. 
</P>
<P>
The alcoholic beverage manufacturers, who have successfully blocked proposed 
tax increases in the Legislature, pledged an all-out effort to defeat the 
measure by combining grass-roots mobilization with an unlimited campaign 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to defend to the death my glass of Chardonnay," said John De Luca, 
president of the Wine Institute. "This is going to be a jihad for us; this is 
going to be a holy war. We're going to raise whatever it takes." 
</P>
<P>
The measure, slated for the November, 1990, ballot, would impose a tax of 5 
cents for each 12 ounces of beer, five ounces of wine or one ounce of liquor 
sold in the state. 
</P>
<P>
The alcohol tax initiative has been spearheaded by Assemblyman Lloyd Connelly 
(D-Sacramento), a leader in last year's successful Proposition 99 campaign to 
raise the cigarette tax by 25 cents a pack. 
</P>
<P>
Connelly and other backers of the measure contend that alcohol abuse costs 
California taxpayers more than $13 billion a year in drunk-driving accidents, 
emergency medical care, alcoholism treatment, mental health care, law 
enforcement and the care of battered women and abused children. 
</P>
<P>
Under the initiative proposal, the increased tax revenue will be divided among 
programs that serve these groups -- programs such as trauma care centers that 
have not fared well under the budgets of the Deukmejian Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"Over 50% of the cases that are brought into our emergency and trauma network 
are alcohol related," Edelman said at a Capitol news conference. "They're a 
victim of drunk driving, they're a victim of physical abuse by someone who is 
intoxicated. And so the cost of providing trauma and emergency care should be 
shifted to the users, or abusers, if you will, of alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
Drafters of the measure have also attempted to take advantage of the public's 
concern about drugs by including drug abuse in the measure and providing funds 
to many drug-related programs. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, 25% of the funds raised will go to emergency and trauma 
care; 24% will be devoted to alcohol and drug treatment programs; 21% will go 
to law enforcement; 15% will go to community mental health programs, and 15% 
will go to programs that serve battered women, abused children and other 
victims of alcohol and drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the money would be funneled directly to local governments, 
circumventing the state budget process. The proposed constitutional amendment 
would also exempt the new tax revenues from the state's spending limit. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition supporting the initiative is made up of groups whose programs 
would receive the major benefit of the measure. They include the California 
Assn. of Highway Patrolmen, the California Chapter of the American College of 
Emergency Physicians, the California Council of Alcohol Problems, the 
California Network of Mental Health Clients and the California Consortium of 
Child Abuse Councils. 
</P>
<P>
De Luca of the Wine Institute charged that organizers of the initiative 
solicited commitments of campaign support from organizations in exchange for 
including their programs in the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"On this initiative there should be a warning label that says 'This initiative 
is contaminated by money,' " he said. "In return for your dollars and 
signatures you get money back." 
</P>
<P>
But Connelly denied that any group had been offered money in exchange for 
campaign support and said the alcohol industry's allegation is "scandalous and 
outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
"This is the same group that contributes about a million dollars each 
legislative session to ensure that there hasn't been an increase in the alcohol 
tax," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Connelly said he expects the industry to spend as much as $30 million to defeat 
the measure -- 10 times what the proponents plan to spend. 
</P>
<P>
The industry already has launched its counteroffensive, pushing a rival ballot 
measure in the Legislature that would raise alcohol taxes, but by a much more 
modest amount. The industry proposal calls for a 20-cents-a-gallon increase for 
beer and wine and $3.17-a-gallon increase for spirits. 
</P>
<P>
The vintners and brewers say the coalition's initiative would impose an unfair 
burden on an industry that already produces hundreds of millions of dollars in 
revenues from property and income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"No one went around looking for this fight," De Luca said, "but if they want to 
fight we can give it to them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
The "nickel-a-drink" proposal needs to be certified by the attorney general's 
office before its backers can begin collecting the 595,485 signatures necessary 
to take the measure to the voters. The signatures must be gathered within 150 
days of the attorney general's certification.

NEW SMITHSONIAN VISITORS' CENTER HAS HIGH-TECH COMPUTER DISPLAYS

<P>
The Smithsonian Institution opened a $2.7-million visitors' center Thursday 
that boasts high-tech computer displays in the same historic Castle building 
where Abraham Lincoln observed hot-air balloon maneuvers during the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
Electronic wall maps, touch screen video displays in seven languages, two movie 
theaters and scale models of Washington's downtown tourist attractions will be 
available to the 3 million visitors who are expected to visit the new 
Smithsonian Information Center next year. 
</P>
<P>
One stop at the Victorian-style Castle's great hall, Assistant Smithsonian 
Secretary Ralph Rinzler said, "will help visitors make the best use of their 
time at the museums and save them the frustration of an endless trek from 
building to building." 
</P>
<P>
The Smithsonian has expanded greatly since 1855, when the Castle was built to 
house its early scientific collections. Today, the Smithsonian includes 14

AQUINO NONCOMMITTAL ON U.S. BASES IN PHILIPPINES; 
</P>

President Bush welcomed Philippine President Corazon Aquino to the White House 
on Thursday, saying he is "confident" that the United States will be able to 
negotiate a new, long-term agreement to preserve the two American military 
bases in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
But Aquino, during a day-long series of meetings with Bush Administration 
officials and Congress, was much cooler about the future of Clark Air Base and 
Subic Bay Naval Base, the two largest American military installations outside 
the continental United States. 
</P>
<P>
"She was very noncommittal," said California Rep. Duncan L. Hunter 
(R-Coronado), one of a group of congressmen who talked with the Philippine 
president. "She said (the outcome) would be determined by negotiations and by 
the manifestation of the will of the Philippine people and the American 
people." 
</P>
<P>
The United States has occupied the bases in the Philippines for most of this 
century. They are considered among the most strategically important American 
military facilities in the world. Subic Bay is the largest overseas ship-repair 
facility of the U.S. Navy, and Clark Air Base provides a vital stopover point 
for flights from the United States to the Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
The current agreement permitting U.S. access to the Philippine bases expires in 
September, 1991. Over the last year, a number of Philippine legislative leaders 
have voiced opposition to renewing the base agreement. Aquino, who in the past 
has supported the U.S. presence, will remain in office until 1992 and recently 
said that she will not run for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
During arrival ceremonies at the White House, Aquino avoided any mention of the 
U.S. bases. Instead, she pressed for greater U.S. economic help for the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
"We will raise, particularly, the means by which the Philippines and the United 
States can cooperate in more areas to our mutual economic benefit," Aquino 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Secretary of State Richard H. Solomon later said that Aquino asked 
Bush and other officials to allow more Philippine sugar and textiles into the 
United States and to help arrange for the U.S. armed forces in Asia to buy more 
agricultural supplies from the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Aquino, Bush and other U.S. officials stressed the importance of 
the negotiations over the future of the military bases, which are scheduled to 
begin in December. "We are confident (that the base talks) will mold a new and 
mutually beneficial, long-term security partnership in the future," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Reagan Administration agreed to raise the amount of money that 
the United States pays to the Philippines in exchange for use of the bases from 
$180 million to $481 million per year. Solomon told reporters that the 
"constrained fiscal environment" in the United States makes it unlikely that 
the Bush Administration will be able to offer much more.

BRAZIL TV STAR-TURNED-CANDIDATE RULED INELIGIBLE FOR PRESIDENCY

Television star Silvio Santos, a late entrant and formidable contender in 
Brazil's presidential race, lost his bid for election Thursday, six days before 
the scheduled vote. The Superior Electoral Tribunal ruled him ineligible to be 
a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
One reason given for the Thursday night ruling was that the tiny Brazilian 
Municipalist Party sponsoring Santos is not legally registered. Another was 
that he failed to comply with a 1970 law requiring candidates to remove 
themselves from the management of any company with a public concession, such as 
a broadcast license. 
</P>
<P>
Santos, 58, is the owner of Brazil's second-largest television network. He is 
also the star of a popular all-afternoon variety show aired by the network on 
Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
After he announced his candidacy at the beginning of November, he quickly 
emerged among the top presidential contenders in public opinion polls, 
displacing other leading candidates. Several parties and the federal attorney 
general filed legal challenges with the Superior Electoral Tribunal this week. 
</P>
<P>
The seven-member tribunal's ruling against Santos was unanimous. Francisco 
Rezek, the tribunal president, said the decision did not involve constitutional 
issues, which would be the only grounds for an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
There was no word from Santos after the ruling. At his house in the city of Sao 
Paulo, a maid told reporters that he had gone to bed with a headache. 
</P>
<P>
A public opinion survey published Thursday before the Electoral Tribunal's 
ruling showed that those interviewed favored Santos by a narrow margin over 
Fernando Collor de Mello, a centrist reformer who previously had led most 
polls. The Thursday poll, by the Brazilian affiliate of the Gallup Poll, showed 
leftists Leonel Brizola and Luis Inacio da Silva tied for third. 
</P>
<P>
If no candidate wins an absolute majority in the election next Wednesday, the 
two top finishers will compete in a runoff Dec. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Brazilians have not elected a president since 1960. The armed forces ruled the 
country from 1964 to 1985, when civilian Jose Sarney took office as interim 
president.

CONTRAS AND SANDINISTAS ARRIVE BACK AT THE PEACE TABLE; 
</P>
<P>
NICARAGUA: THE U.S.-BACKED REBELS HAD BARELY SAT DOWN AT U.N. HEADQUARTERS 
BEFORE THE MANAGUA GOVERNMENT PRESENTED ITS LATEST PLAN TO END THE WAR.

<P>
A grim-faced, five-member delegation of the reconstituted Contra leadership sat 
down here Thursday for new peace talks with Nicaragua's government, with the 
Sandinistas pushing hard for an agreement on a partial demobilization of the 
resistance movement. 
</P>
<P>
The two days of talks at U.N. headquarters here are intended to find a way to 
stop the new fighting between the Sandinistas and the U.S.-backed rebels. But 
before the negotiations got under way Thursday afternoon, it was the Sandinista 
leaders who were doing most of the talking. The government formally presented a 
detailed 15-point peace plan, which included everything from a Sandinista 
pledge to stop accepting arms shipments to a schedule of daily rations for 
repatriated Contras for beans, rice, milk, cooking oil, canned beef and sugar. 
</P>
<P>
The government proposal is "not an ultimatum," but rather a "generous offer" to 
end the fighting and repatriate the resistance fighters, said Nicaraguan 
Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto. But he stressed that the government's 
proposal requires that the Contra delegates agree to demobilize at least half 
of their remaining forces. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not continue to declare a unilateral cease-fire," he added, "as long 
as that means we cease and they fire." 
</P>
<P>
A diplomatic source in Managua, the Nicaraguan capital, said that Sandinista 
officials disclosed the basic elements of their proposal in a written message 
to the U.S. Embassy in Managua on Tuesday, a day before President Daniel Ortega 
announced it publicly. The message included an implied warning to the Bush 
Administration that Nicaragua is ready to attack Contra positions in Honduras 
if the proposal is rejected. 
</P>
<P>
The message, handed to an Embassy official by Defense Minister Humberto Ortega, 
also acknowledged that Nicaragua received a shipload of weapons last Friday. 
The unusual admission was coupled with the offer to suspend arms imports if the 
Contras accept a timetable for demobilizing. 
</P>
<P>
"In such circumstances," the message added, "the Nicaraguan government will not 
carry out any kind of military operations against bases that the 
counterrevolutionary forces have along the (Honduran) border with Nicaragua." 
</P>
<P>
The Sandinistas have crossed into Honduras several times during the eight-year 
war to attack the Contras, whose command post at Yamales is within a few miles 
of the border. The last such incursion -- in March, 1988 -- succeeded in 
driving hundreds of rebels out of northern Nicaragua but failed to capture the 
command post. The heavy fighting was followed by peace talks that established a 
cease-fire, which endured until last week. 
</P>
<P>
The Contra delegation, which arrived in New York on Thursday without having 
seen the latest Sandinista proposal, had little to say before the meeting. In a 
brief comment to reporters, delegation leader Col. Enrique Bermudez said only 
that the proposal as outlined Wednesday by Ortega appeared to be "a propaganda 
ploy" that "amounts to a surrender." Other Contra officials and the Bush 
Administration also scoffed at Ortega's offer to halt arms shipments until 
April 25, since they believe the Sandinistas already have a more than ample 
stockpile of weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega said Wednesday that the agreement signed in August by the five Central 
American presidents in Tela, Honduras, requires that the Contras begin 
demobilizing by Dec. 5. Instead, Ortega said, the Contras have continued to 
infiltrate into Nicaragua from Honduras and to attack peasants. 
</P>
<P>
The Contras for their part have refused to demobilize until they see that the 
free elections set for Feb. 25 are held as planned. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday in Miami, the Contras announced formation of a new 
"civilian-military commission" to replace the old directorate, several of whose 
members have resigned and returned to Nicaragua, the Associated Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
Contra military spokesman Alejandro Acevedo said the U.N. negotiating team led 
by Contra military commander Bermudez had recognized the new commission, which 
includes only one of the former directors, Aristides Sanchez. Ousted civilian 
Contra leaders compared the action to a coup, the AP said. 
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar opened the talks here by urging 
each side "to show the necessary flexibility," but he also appeared to nudge 
the Contras toward a commitment to demobilize. He pointed out that the Tela 
accords set an actual deadline for a Contra demobilization. "The deadline 
established in the Tela accords is getting closer," the secretary general said. 
</P>
<P>
"The government of Nicaragua understandably has insisted on compliance with 
that deadline," he said. A failure to comply by the Contras, he added, 
"threatens human lives, the elections in Nicaragua and the peace process as a 
whole."

Radical Palestinians said Thursday that a U.S. veto of a U.N. Security Council 
resolution deploring Israeli actions in the occupied territories will encourage 
repressive measures against Arabs living there. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. veto . . . clearly represents the flagrant U.S. bias to Israel. It 
encourages Israel to continue its repressive measures against the Palestinian 
people," the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"The veto also reflects the U.S. Administration's disregard of world opinion," 
it added. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Washington cast the only negative vote, blocking a draft resolution 
that also demanded the return of property confiscated from a village in the 
occupied territories where Palestinians have refused to pay taxes.

Following is the full text of East Germany's announcement on allowing its 
citizens to travel abroad or emigrate if they wish. The translation of the 
official ADN news agency dispatch was by Reuters news agency: 
</P>
<P>
The government spokesman told ADN the Council of Ministers of East Germany has 
decided immediately to set in force the following stipulations for private 
journeys and permanent emigration until a corresponding parliamentary law comes 
into effect: 
</P>
<P>
1. Private journeys into foreign countries can be applied for without 
fulfilling preconditions (reasons for travel, relatives). Permission will be 
given at short notice. 
</P>
<P>
2. The relevant passport and registration offices of the regional offices of 
the People's Police in East Germany have been ordered to issue visas for 
permanent emigration immediately without the present preconditions for 
permanent emigration having been fulfilled. Application for permanent 
emigration is also possible as before at departments of internal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
3. Permanent emigration is allowed across all border crossing points between 
East Germany and West Germany and West Berlin and East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
4. Because of this (new ruling), the temporary issuing of permits in East 
German missions abroad and permanent emigration using East German identity 
cards through third countries will no longer apply.

increase direct child care subsidies by $1.2 billion in 1990 in a last-ditch 
effort to get a bill passed before Congress adjourns. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached by conferees from the two bodies after Sen. Orrin G. 
Hatch (R-Utah) dropped his demand that states be allowed to issue vouchers for 
a new $300-million preschool education program for 3- and 4-year-olds from 
low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, House Democrats agreed to allow more of the money to go to rural 
areas at the discretion of governors and permit states to issue vouchers that 
parents could use to pay for day care services provided by churches or private 
enterprises or nonprofit organizations such as YMCAs. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Dale E. Kildee (D-Mich.) and Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), the chief 
authors of the legislation, said that Democratic leaders in the House and 
Senate are now committed to passing a child care bill before Congress adjourns, 
possibly before Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has vehemently opposed the bill, and House Republicans 
left the meeting before the final vote. However, Bush backed off a veto threat 
after the Senate approved its version in June. 
</P>
<P>
"At least we have a running shot now with a bill that the President might not 
veto," said Hatch, who angered the Administration and conservative groups by 
joining with liberal Democrats last spring in helping put together the basic 
package. 
</P>
<P>
A separate group of House and Senate negotiators still has to reach accord on 
another provision that is part of the child care package that would increase 
tax credits for poor families with children by $500 to $750 a year. 
</P>
<P>
But House and Senate Democratic leaders on Thursday instructed the chairmen of 
their tax-writing committees to try to settle differences over that issue by 
Monday night in a drive to get a vote on the House floor by the end of next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
With public opinion polls indicating that a large majority of Americans favor 
federal aid for child care, Democrats are hoping that Bush will not veto the 
bill, even though an adjourned Congress would not have an opportunity to 
override a veto. 
</P>
<P>
But, if he does, said Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the 
House Education and Labor Committee, Congress will pass the same measure again 
early next year at the opening of the 1990 election cycle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be pretty damned hard to get anybody in 1990 to vote against 
child care," Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows exactly how much of the federal block grants to states are now 
spent on child care subsidies, but estimates range from $400 million to $1 
billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would establish a new program that would devote an additional 
$750 million specifically for child care services. 
</P>
<P>
Another $150 million would be added to the Head Start preschool program that 
now reaches about half a million disadvantaged 3- and 4-year-olds each year 
with the aim of turning those facilities into all-day, year-round child care 
centers.

HOUSE OKS DEFENSE BUDGET DESPITE CHARGES IT SERVES SPECIAL INTERESTS;

<P>
MILITARY: SOME COMPLAIN THAT NATIONAL SECURITY IS SACRIFICED FOR SPECIAL JOBS 
PROJECTS.

<P>
The 1990 defense budget moved closer to final enactment Thursday as the House 
approved the $305-billion spending plan, despite complaints that it is more a 
special-interest jobs bill than a blueprint for national security. 
</P>
<P>
The House voted for the compromise spending bill, 236 to 172, sending it to the 
Senate for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
The relatively narrow margin of the vote indicated broad dissatisfaction with 
the bill. Many Republicans were unhappy that funding for the "Star Wars" 
anti-missile shield was $1.1 billion below the Administration's request. Some 
Democrats complained that too much is being spent on nuclear weapons at a time 
when the United States and Soviet Union are negotiating reductions in their 
strategic arsenals. 
</P>
<P>
And members of both parties groused that parochial concerns about jobs overrode 
more pressing national priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John R. Kasich (R-Ohio) complained that "any relationship between national 
security and the defense authorization bill is purely coincidental." 
</P>
<P>
He and other lawmakers complained that House members funded costly weapons 
programs such as the F-14D fighter plane and the V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft 
despite efforts by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to kill them as unneeded and 
too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
New York lawmakers succeeded in winning $1.6-billion funding for 18 F-14 
Tomcats, which are built by Grumman Corp. on Long Island. Representatives from 
Pennsylvania and Texas won a reprieve for the threatened V-22, persuading their 
colleagues to approve $255 million to continue development of the unusual 
aircraft, a product of Bell Helicopter Textron Inc., and Boeing Co. 
</P>
<P>
"The Congress of the United States turned the defense authorization bill into a 
jobs bill and rejected all the program terminations . . . except for a 
smattering that add up to pennies," Kasich said. "It's a jobs authorization, a 
pork authorization, rather than a defense security authorization bill." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Larry J. Hopkins (R-Ky.) called the bill "a serious indictment of the 
congressional budgeting process, a process so throughly corrupted by parochial 
interests that the principal goal, providing for the national defense, has been 
ignored. What weapons we buy and where they're built has become more important 
than whether they're truly needed and fit within an overall defense framework." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cheney warned Thursday that the defense budget could suffer damaging 
cuts if Congress fails to agree on measures to reduce the federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
He said in a television interview that if he is forced to make the deep cuts 
over the next few months "you could forget about negotiating from a reasonable 
position of strength" with the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
The defense secretary was referring to about $16 billion in across-the-board 
federal spending cuts, called a sequestration, that automatically went into 
effect Oct. 16 under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. 
</P>
<P>
While the sequestration still could be lifted if a deficit-reduction bill is 
approved by Congress and signed by Bush, the White House has indicated that it 
is willing to live with the automatic cuts all year. 
</P>
<P>
If the automatic cuts go into effect, the spending total just passed by the 
House would be reduced by $8 billion, the Defense Department's share of the 
Gramm-Rudman cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said he hopes "that's not going to happen" because he would have to 
reduce military forces by 173,000 men and women and cut 4.3% from every other 
account. 
</P>
<P>
The defense spending bill approved by the House Thursday authorizes a variety 
of Pentagon programs for the fiscal year that started Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, House and Senate negotiators reached agreement on a 
$288-billion military spending bill for fiscal 1990 that largely tracks the 
defense authorization bill on the major strategic weapons, lawmakers and 
congressional sources told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation passed by the House marks the fifth straight year that the 
Pentagon's budget has fallen in inflation-adjusted dollars. It is the first to 
cut spending for "Star Wars," to $3.8 billion, from last year's $4.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The bill authorizes construction of two B-2 Stealth bombers in 1990 and five in 
1991. The Air Force hopes eventually to build 132 of the radar-eluding planes 
at a cost of about $530 million each. 
</P>
<P>
Congress approved funds for both the rail-borne version of the 10-warhead MX 
missile and the truck-mounted single warhead Midgetman missile. The two 
programs got a total of $1.13 billion, $150 million less than requested, and 
the Pentagon can decide how it wants to divide the money between the two 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
The bill includes a 3.6% pay raise for the 2.1 million members of the armed 
forces.

HORSE DEATH TOLL RISES AS OFFICIALS RECALL HAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
State officials Thursday ordered a recall of up to 1,000 tons of hay cubes that 
may be tainted by a deadly toxin as the death toll of horses continued to grow. 
</P>
<P>
One more horse was destroyed at the Orange County Fairgrounds Equestrian Center 
late Wednesday, bringing the total to 16. 
</P>
<P>
Botulism has been blamed in the horses' deaths in four Southern California 
counties, and veterinarians believe the powerful toxin was hidden in hay cubes 
manufactured in Utah and shipped to at least 60 stables in the Southland, 
officials said. Only a portion of the compressed hay cakes tested have been 
found to contain botulism. 
</P>
<P>
But as a precaution, a regionwide roundup has been ordered of the candy-bar 
sized cubes distributed by Paramount Cubing of Paramount, said Stanley 
Buscombe, head of the feed and fertilizer branch of the state Department of 
Food and Agriculture. Officials believe that all of the dead and sick horses 
had been fed the hay cakes before becoming ill. 
</P>
<P>
Veterinarians confirmed Wednesday that several of the cubes collected from a 
San Bernardino County stable where three horses have died contained remains of 
a rabbit that may have carried a botulism toxin commonly found in dogs and cats 
but is extremely rare -- and deadly -- in horses. 
</P>
<P>
Buscombe said no complaints have been filed against Paramount Cubing, adding 
that the company has voluntarily suspended all shipments of its hay cubes and 
is cooperating fully with the recall. 
</P>
<P>
"Our primary goal is to get that feed off the market as fast as possible," 
Buscombe said. "We will then determine if any enforcement action is necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an 8-year-old quarter horse was destroyed Wednesday night at the 
Orange County Fairgrounds. Veterinarians said four other horses, including two 
in Los Angeles County, became ill Thursday. But experts hope that an 
experimental antiserum, en route Thursday night, will counteract the toxin, 
which short-circuits an animal's central nervous system.

FEINSTEIN VOWS TO STAY IN THE RACE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: POLLS SHOW HER SLIPPING, BUT SHE SAYS SHE'LL MAKE A STRONG RUN FOR 
GOVERNOR.

"I'm in this race and I intend to stay in." 
</P>
<P>
With those words, Dianne Feinstein tried Thursday to put to rest speculation 
that she may soon get out of the Democratic gubernatorial primary. 
</P>
<P>
In her first meeting with the news media since a statewide poll showed her 
effort lagging, Feinstein added, "I believe I'm irreversible on this." 
</P>
<P>
The independent California Poll released earlier this week showed her trailing 
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp 53% to 35% among Democrats who were asked in 
late October to pick their choice to take on the likely Republican nominee, 
U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, next June. 
</P>
<P>
Six months ago the same polling organization found her leading Van de Kamp and 
two other potential opponents for the Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles Times Poll in early October also found Feinstein trailing Van de 
Kamp, 37% to 25%. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things I did see in the (latest) California Poll is that my base 
remains intact," Feinstein said, referring to the fact that all along she has 
received about a third of the vote in most polls. 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge is to build on it, to become more visible, to convince people 
that I would be the best choice," Feinstein said. "It's an enormously difficult 
thing to do, particularly for someone who has never run statewide before." 
</P>
<P>
And indeed, Feinstein, the 56-year-old former mayor of San Francisco, has 
generated speculation that she may drop out precisely because she has appeared 
to be uncertain about how to go about the difficult task of nailing down the 
nomination as a newcomer to a statewide campaign. 
</P>
<P>
While Van de Kamp has been actively introducing ballot initiatives that he says 
will be his platform for a 1990 governor's race, Feinstein has struggled to 
increase her visibility in Southern California, which holds the bulk of the 
votes in any election. 
</P>
<P>
Since leasing a condominium in Century City over the summer, Feinstein has 
spent more and more of her time south of the Tehachapis, meeting with potential 
donors and trying to persuade them that she has a better chance against Wilson 
because her support of the death penalty and record as mayor show her to be 
tougher and more decisive than Van de Kamp -- a capital punishment opponent who 
has been fairly low key in seven years as the state's top law enforcement 
official. 
</P>
<P>
Although Feinstein has lagged behind Van de Kamp in raising campaign money, she 
said Thursday that she has other assets that will make her a strong candidate 
by next March's filing date. One of them, she said, is a willingness to express 
strong opinions on current California problems. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein said it is "sheer folly" to rebuild the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland as 
a multilevel structure because the massive damage in the recent earthquake 
proved that the design was unsound. 
</P>
<P>
And she charged that no one in state leadership is discussing whether the Bay 
Bridge, also damaged, can safely serve the area in the future after it is 
reopened later this month. 
</P>
<P>
"What the earthquake really showed," Feinstein said, "is . . . how bad our 
policies for the future really are." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein also charged that Van de Kamp would not be able to work with the 
Legislature to solve problems because he has antagonized lawmakers with his 
so-called ethics initiative, which would limit the terms of legislators. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Pete Wilson and John Van de Kamp are very nice people," Feinstein 
said. "But they are part of the politics of the past."

WORK BEGINS ON EXPANDING CARE; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: A TOP-LEVEL TASK FORCE SETS OUT TO EXTEND BASIC BENEFITS TO MILLIONS OF 
UNINSURED CALIFORNIA WORKERS IN WHAT HAS BEEN CALLED THE ISSUE OF THE '90S.

<P>
A top-level group representing the governor, the Legislature and the state's 
most powerful special interests began work Thursday on a plan to extend basic 
health care to more than 5 million Californians not now covered by any public 
or private medical insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The task force, which includes representatives of employers, workers, insurers, 
doctors and hospitals, will try to weave its way through a political thicket 
and forge a consensus proposal for lawmakers to act on during the 1990 
legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
State Health and Welfare Secretary Clifford L. Allenby, who is heading the 
group, said that, other than relief for the victims of the Bay Area earthquake, 
the issue of health insurance will be the Deukmejian Administration's "top 
priority" next year. 
</P>
<P>
Allenby called the job a "formidable but not impossible task" as he convened 
the group of 18 men and one woman called together by the Administration in 
response to legislation by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
Brown's bill originally would have required all California businesses with five 
or more full-time employees to provide insurance for their workers. Unable to 
win passage of that measure, Brown settled for a compromise that called for a 
study of the health insurance issue and a tax credit for businesses that offer 
insurance to their employees. 
</P>
<P>
The task force's charge is similar to one undertaken a year ago by another 
high-level coalition that sought to overhaul the state's $8-billion system for 
compensating workers who are injured on the job. That group's labors eventually 
led to the passage of legislation that fell short of the complete overhaul but 
was widely acknowledged as the most significant reform of the system in 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The workers' compensation agreement was one of several that Gov. George 
Deukmejian and legislative leaders reached on major issues this past session 
after several years of stalemate. The health insurance negotiators hope to 
capitalize on that good will before Deukmejian leaves office at the end of 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
The author of the workers' compensation bill, Democratic Assemblyman Burt 
Margolin of Los Angeles, attended Thursday's session at the request of Speaker 
Brown. Margolin, who has long pushed without success for extending health 
insurance to every Californian, said he was encouraged by the gathering at one 
table of such a diverse array of interests. 
</P>
<P>
"This group will frame the issue for 1990," said Margolin, who is chairman of 
the Assembly subcommittee on health insurance. "Whatever we do next year will 
be in reaction to what happens here." 
</P>
<P>
Margolin cautioned, however, that any group that tries to develop a consensus 
on such a divisive issue runs the risk of producing a meaningless proposal that 
represents no more than "the least common denominator." 
</P>
<P>
"That is what I am here to try to guard against," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other members of the task force, which will gather almost weekly in an attempt 
to meet a March 1 deadline, took turns Thursday expressing their points of view 
while pledging repeatedly to be flexible. Although everyone present agreed that 
the health insurance problem has reached crisis proportions, it was clear that 
no such unanimity exists on a solution. 
</P>
<P>
Employers, for instance, said they want access to low-cost health policies. And 
they want incentives, rather than a requirement that they provide insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a question of affordability," said Kirk West, president of the 
California Chamber of Commerce. West said 12% of the state's gross economic 
product goes to health insurance, a figure that he contended is twice as high 
as California's competitors in Japan and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
But Thomas E. Rankin, a representative of the California Labor Federation, said 
that if businesses are seeking to reduce their costs, they will not succeed in 
doing it by reducing their obligation to their workers. He said it is 
"disgraceful" that only the United States and South Africa among industrialized 
nations do not provide universal health insurance for their citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost every labor dispute that occurs these days involves the issue of health 
benefits," Rankin said. 
</P>
<P>
Labor and management both have called for measures to contain the rising costs 
of health care. At the same time, hospital association officials said their 
members are already losing $1 billion a year providing care to people who have 
no means of paying for it.

HAPPY DAYS: U.S. policy on emigration from East Germany is yet to be determined 
(A1), but Orange County's Phoenix Club already has a project in mind. . . . The 
club, made up largely of German descendants, has offered to sponsor five 
families, president Hans Klein said, adding that his 69-year-old brother told 
him on the phone Thursday from East Germany, "Get the bedrooms ready, we're 
coming." Dana Parsons

WALK OF STARS: Campaigners against development in Laguna Canyon are drawing on 
the city's sizable show-biz faction. . . . So far, Robert Englund (a.k.a. 
Freddie Krueger and the Phantom of the Opera, above) and Bette Midler have 
declared their support and say they will try to attend Saturday morning's 
canyon "Walk-In" (B3). Actress Julie Harris has posed for photos wearing a 
Save-the-Canyon sweat shirt. She said she loves Laguna from having visited 
friends there. Dana Parsons

DIANNE KLEIN: EVENTS DECIDED ONE MAN: THE ENVIRONMENT CAN'T WAIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If you put a frog in a pot of scalding water, it will jump right out. But if 
you gently warm the water, turning up the heat ever so subtly, the frog will 
come to accept it. Then it will die. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Larson, a horticulturist who is executive vice president of Irvine's Sea 
Tree Nursery, first heard about this phenomenon from his college biology 
professor years ago. An interesting quirk of nature, he thought. Stupid frog 
doesn't know enough to save its own hide. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Larson, 43 years old, married with four children, is far less cavalier. 
He understands, and fears, the parable. 
</P>
<P>
"We are subtly accepting things that we shouldn't be accepting," he says. "We 
are going to be like that frog. Maybe we won't die, but we might come pretty 
close." 
</P>
<P>
I'd come to see Tom Larson on this smoggy morning because someone had told me 
about the rather odd combination of businessman and budding environmental 
activist, a man who says he is taking seriously President Bush's challenge to 
become one of a thousand points of light. 
</P>
<P>
About six months ago, Larson took it upon himself to call up Orange County's 
diverse environmental groups to ask if they would be interested in helping to 
draft what has come to be called "A Guide for Environmental Restoration in 
Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
They were. The 26-page document, endorsed by everyone from the Sierra Club and 
Audubon Society to the Friends of the Irvine Coast, lays out the area's 
problems and offers paths toward a solution. It is specific, with timetables 
for reaching goals, and is broken down by categories: education, air, water, 
transportation, natural undeveloped land, native plants and wildlife, waste, 
urban landscape design and maintenance, energy and population. 
</P>
<P>
Larson hopes it will be a starting point, the first step toward educating 
people about the scientific truths of our environmental vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
"If you tell reasonable people the truth, they are going to make reasonable 
decisions," he says. "I keep thinking about the Olympics. We all got together 
and said, 'These are the problems.' We reorganized and everything went 
beautifully . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The point is that with the technology that we have and the people that we have 
here in Orange County, we can be pacesetters. Orange County has some wonderful 
people. We have a strong economy. But we are out of balance. I think our vision 
is short term." 
</P>
<P>
This is how Tom Larson talks, direct and bottom line. He rarely wastes a word, 
or even as much as a gesture. Sitting behind his desk, ramrod straight with his 
arms folded in front of him, he explains why he is doing more than just worry 
about what kind of environment we are leaving to our children and 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
A little over a year ago, Larson went to St. Joseph Hospital to have some 
precancerous lesions removed from his forehead. The doctor told him that he had 
noticed a gradual but steady rise in cases of skin cancer, directly 
attributable to the thinning ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
This bothered Larson, who recalls that during his childhood in Orange County, 
no one had even heard of sunscreens. The environment was something to be 
enjoyed, not protected from. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, Larson called the manufacturer of the "Sold" tags that the 
nursery places on its trees. They had begun fading so quickly that they soon 
had to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me, 'Mr. Larson, we are making them with better dyes, better paper 
than ever before, but they still keep fading,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then the local water district called to ask if they could put a test well at 
the nursery. They were checking for toxins penetrating the water table. 
</P>
<P>
"This is all happening within a week," Larson said. "So I'm thinking, 'Why am I 
accepting this?' " 
</P>
<P>
Tom Larson, of course, is no longer accepting the steady erosion of our world. 
But even as he recalls his conversion to environmental activist -- "some people 
have even called me radical, which is really funny, because I'm so 
conservative" -- he acknowledges that people tend to delay action until faced 
with calamity. Often, that is simply too late. 
</P>
<P>
The early warning signs that got Tom Larson moving came within a week of each 
other, but before that, the indicators seemed less compelling. Two years ago, 
for example, Larson decided the nursery would no longer grow Monterey pines, 
which are native to the California coast, because they were not doing well in 
the smog. 
</P>
<P>
"What really bothers me is this attitude of accepting it," he says. "I accepted 
it for so many years. And now the evidence is so solid, the scientific evidence 
of what we are doing to our environment. We need to make changes now . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, unfortunately, people don't move until the pain exceeds the fear. I want 
us to avoid the pain, a catastrophe that we can't handle. Nature is not very 
forgiving." 
</P>
<P>
"A Guide for Environmental Restoration in Orange County" will soon be 
distributed to the lawmakers and community leaders that Tom Larson and other 
Orange County environmentalists hope to educate about the parable of the 
accepting frog. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, we're smart enough to save our own hide.

CITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO AIRPORT SITE PANEL

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has voted to contribute $3,675 to the Airport Site Coalition 
for its study of possible sites for a new county airport. 
</P>
<P>
Yorba Linda is joining other county cities in helping to pay for the study. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the coalition, which was selected by the Federal Aviation 
Administration and the Southern California Assn. of Governments to perform the 
study, said the group will need almost $300,000 to complete the project, in 
addition to $378,604 already allotted by the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Henry W. Wedaa said it is in the city's best interests to contribute to 
the study, which he said is near completion.

MORMONS TO BUILD NEW CHURCH CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will hold a ground-breaking 
ceremony at 10 a.m. Saturday for a 45,074-square-foot center on Greenville 
Street, north of MacArthur Boulevard, in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The $8-million, two-story brick building will include two chapels, several 
classrooms, administrative offices, a stage and a full basketball court. Called 
the Santa Ana Stake Center, the structure will serve 4,000 Mormons from five 
wards in the Santa Ana area. There are three Spanish-language wards, Tongan and 
Samoan wards, and Cambodian, Korean and Vietnamese branches of the church in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
Construction, scheduled to begin Dec. 15, is expected to take one year. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many other Orange County congregations, whose building projects have 
been stymied by skyrocketing land costs, the Mormons were able to draw on 
resources from members worldwide, who are required to tithe 10% of their gross 
income.

PUBLIC WORKS CHIEF SUSPENDED BY CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city's director of public works has been suspended for two weeks without 
pay after acknowledging that he made unauthorized use of staff time and 
improperly billed the city for use of his car, City Manager Paul Brady Jr. said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Ehrlich, who heads the 250-employee department, will be on unpaid leave 
from Nov. 20 to Dec. 6, Brady said. In addition, Ehrlich already has repaid the 
city about $1,400. 
</P>
<P>
Ehrlich, who earns $80,000 a year, was in Washington on city business Thursday 
and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Based on information provided to Brady by a department employee, an 
investigation determined that Ehrlich instructed his secretary -- who no longer 
works for the city -- to type his master's thesis and church documents on city 
time and overtime during the past six years. In addition, although he used a 
city vehicle, he was reimbursed as if he had used his personal car for city 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Ehrlich and Brady met with the public works staff earlier this week, Brady 
said, so that Ehrlich could "explain and apologize to them for his actions." 
</P>
<P>
The two men assured the staff that there would be no retribution against any 
employee for bringing such information to the city manager's office. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not acceptable conduct in this organization," Brady said, "from 
department head to entry-level employee." MARK I. PINSKY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO;

<P>
BACKERS GET BEHIND 'CENTRAL PARK' MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY PAULSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supporters are already joining a campaign launched this week by city officials 
to promote a proposed bond issue that would raise $20 million to buy 120 acres 
of farmland and convert it into a "Central Park." 
</P>
<P>
At a Wednesday private dinner hosted by city officials and attended by 110 
guests, San Juan Citizens for Open Space was begun under chairperson Marlene 
Draper, a 12-year city resident and a member of the Capistrano Unified School 
District Board of Trustees. She is joined by two city planning commissioners, 
Gil Jones and Wyatt Hart. 
</P>
<P>
The general-obligation bond scheduled for the April, 1990, ballot requires a 
two-thirds vote to pass. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost everybody in the room supported it," Draper said of the group that 
included representatives from local youth sports organizations, senior 
citizens, historic preservationists and farming families. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent telephone poll of 400 registered city voters, 85% said they would 
like to see the land retained as open space. Sixty percent said they would 
support a bond if the payments were no more than $10 per month, Mayor Gary L. 
Hausdorfer said. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, the 20-year bond would create average payments of $5.83 per month 
for homeowners and $2.29 per month for mobile home owners, Hausdorfer 
explained, adding that business property owners would also be assessed. 
</P>
<P>
At a Thursday press conference to announce the bond, a developer in escrow on a 
portion of the targeted property said the landowners, John and Roger Swanner, 
would not complete the sale because they are waiting for the outcome of the 
April special election. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a holding pattern," said Cody Small, president of Costa Mesa- based 
CMS Development, which is the only developer in negotiations on any part of the 
area. The company has plans to create two-story office buildings on a 40-acre 
site fronting Camino Capistrano, Small said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Robert H. Schuller's Crystal Cathedral Ministries in May spent $5 
million to buy a 77-acre ranch next to the proposed park. The ministry plans to 
create a 40-acre cemetery and a 16-acre care facility on the site, which 
adjoins its 93-acre Rancho Capistrano in the northern tip of the city. 
</P>
<P>
After several thwarted attempts by city officials to raise money through 
federal, state and private channels, it was decided that the bond issue would 
be a last-resort method to generate enough money to purchase the farmland and 
to convert it by 1992 into playing fields, a community center and an orange 
grove. 
</P>
<P>
"Most kids have never been close enough to an orange tree to see an orange on 
it," Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer said recently. WENDY PAULSON

BATTLE INTENSIFIES OVER BREN PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a coalition of Laguna Beach city officials and local conservationists, it 
is a modern-day tale of David versus Goliath. 
</P>
<P>
On one side, billionaire developer Donald L. Bren and the Irvine Co. plan to 
build a planned residential community of nearly 3,000 homes at the mouth of 
Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
On the other, an odd assortment of local residents, artists and city officials 
are fighting to preserve the rugged terrain in its natural state. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't realize the formidable opponent that we're taking on," said Mark 
Chamberlain, a Laguna Beach artist. "It's like a flea climbing up an elephant's 
back. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the 2,150-acre Laguna Laurel project have harnessed a wealth of 
local professional talent into a well-organized political machine. On Saturday, 
environmentalists are planning a protest march along Laguna Canyon Road that is 
expected to draw more than 5,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Northbound traffic toward the San Diego Freeway will be halted from 9 a.m. 
until noon along the heavily traveled road. The day's events will include 
speeches by Indians about the ancient burial grounds located near the proposed 
housing project. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Laurel project has faced opposition since it was first proposed by 
the Irvine Co. nearly a decade ago. But the battle has grown more heated in 
recent months as company officials get closer to breaking ground. 
</P>
<P>
The project would be located west of Leisure World and north of Laguna Beach 
and would feature a 237-acre private golf course. Local residents fear that 
Laguna Beach would suffer from traffic congestion and storm water runoff 
resulting from the project. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilwoman Lida Lenney says she hasn't seen such a spirited campaign 
since "we tried to elect a black woman to the city council in Alabama" 20 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
The project has already obtained preliminary approval from the County Board of 
Supervisors. But now that the Irvine Co. is in the final stages of the permit 
process, the opposition has gotten tougher. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been successful in booting it into the election year," said Harry 
Huggins, director of Save the Canyons, one of a handful of nonprofit groups 
working to prevent the development. "Now it's a campaign issue." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two sides aren't getting any closer. Irvine Co. officials 
recently offered to sell the city about 250 acres, roughly one-tenth of the 
project, for $38 million, an offer which no one in the city appears to be 
taking seriously. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to balance their various interests, but (they have) only one 
position, and that's no development," said Irvine Co. spokesman Larry Thomas. 
"The reality of the world we live in is the land has value. I guess their 
expectation was that someone would simply give it away." TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND

OK EXPECTED ON PLAN FOR 18 FLIGHTS 
</P>

American Airlines would retain its dominance at John Wayne Airport and 
bargain-based Midway Airlines would become the newest carrier with two flights 
a day under a complex plan to allocate 18 new daily flights that is expected to 
receive final approval by the county Board of Supervisors on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The additions are part of an airport expansion plan that will permit as many as 
33% more flights by noisier aircraft. The plan, which would take effect when 
the airport's new $50-million passenger terminal opens in April, also would 
abolish limits on the number of hourly flights during peak travel times. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan given preliminary approval Wednesday night by the Orange County 
Airport Commission, American Airlines would be allowed to increase the number 
of its noise-regulated flights from 19 to 21. The 10% boost would keep American 
far ahead of the pack. USAir, with two new flights, would remain second with 11 
daily flights under the new plan. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska, American West, Continental, Delta, Northwest, TWA, United and USAir 
also would get from one to three additional flights in the noisier categories, 
according to the proposed plan. 
</P>
<P>
The noisier jets, designated in the "A" and "AA" categories, are generally more 
profitable because they can go farther without refueling and hold more 
passengers. The number of those flights is increasing from 55 to 73 when the 
new terminal opens, under the settlement terms of a lawsuit that had challenged 
airport expansion plans several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The actual increase in flights may vary because the plan encourages airlines to 
give up some of their flights in noisier jets by offering additional increases 
to airlines that use quieter aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The plan drew generally favorable comments from some of the airport's historic 
adversaries. A spokesman for a community group that had sued the county over 
airport noise in 1985 offered only two reservations to the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed increase to as many as 22 flights between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m would 
be an "intrusive" burden on nearby residents, many of whom are still asleep at 
that hour, said Barbara Lichman, executive director of the Airport Working 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
The major concern raised by Lichman and others, however, focused on an issue 
left unresolved in the commission report: whether cargo carrier companies will 
remain banned from the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Both Federal Express and UPS have threatened to sue the county if they are not 
granted entry to the airport when it expands in the spring, staff counsel 
Michael S. Gatzke told commissioners Wednesday night. He said the staff is 
working on several possible compromises that could avoid another lengthy court 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
But representatives from environmental groups, the city of Newport Beach and 
the community said they would be wary of any such compromise. And assurances 
from company representatives that their firms have invested billions of dollars 
in state-of-the-art quiet aircraft did little to allay their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"The eventual result of allowing them in is going to be their normal form of 
operation, which is night service with noisy planes," Lichman said. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing, a UPS company representative made no mention of a lawsuit and 
assured the commission that his company wanted to be a good airport neighbor to 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
But, UPS Spokesman Kenneth Churchill added, "we also feel that we have to 
protect the business interests of Orange County and particularly the 13,000 
businesses that would ship with us on any flight."

FUGITIVE MCVEY IS FREED; U.S. WATCHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One-time Orange County businessman Charles J. McVey, charged with trying to 
sell secret computer technology to the Soviet Union, was a free man Thursday 
after two years in a Canadian jail. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. authorities vowed to watch his movements and apprehend him if he 
enters the United States. 
</P>
<P>
McVey, 65, formerly of Villa Park, left the Vancouver Pre-Trial Center in 
British Columbia late Wednesday after an appeals court there ordered him freed, 
ruling he could not be extradited to the United States to stand trial. He had 
been held there since his arrest in 1987 on two California indictments. 
</P>
<P>
McVey is among the U.S. Customs Service's most-wanted smugglers of arms and 
high-technology. U.S. investigators were frustrated Thursday that intricacies 
of the extradition treaty between the United States and Canada allowed him to 
slip through their hands. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very disappointed with the ruling," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Lee B. 
Altschuler, who obtained an indictment against McVey in San Jose. "We're 
hopeful there will be another time McVey will be extradited." 
</P>
<P>
Edgar Adamson, special agent in charge of the U.S. Customs Service office in 
Los Angeles, said he intends to ask Canadian officials to cooperate in 
monitoring McVey's movements in that country and keep U.S. officials informed. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly want to find out where he's going to go, where he's going to live 
and what he's going to do," Adamson said. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Fleming, a Customs Service spokesman, said the agency is "very 
disappointed" that McVey was freed. 
</P>
<P>
"It took thousands of man hours to investigate him and charge him," Fleming 
said. "He is still a federal fugitive, and if he attempts to enter the United 
States we will do everything in our authority to apprehend him." 
</P>
<P>
Fleming said lookouts have been instructed to keep a special watch for McVey at 
the 300 Customs stations in major U.S. cities and along the Canadian and 
Mexican borders. The agency also hopes to monitor McVey through its Ottawa 
attache. 
</P>
<P>
McVey fled the United States in 1983, weeks before a federal grand jury in Los 
Angeles indicted him and two other men in an alleged plot to ship $15 million 
worth of computer and satellite technology to the Soviet Union. He was arrested 
by a Royal Canadian Mountie in a coffee shop in Canada's remote Yukon Territory 
in August, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Three months later, another federal grand jury in San Jose indicted McVey, 
contending that he masterminded a scheme to sell secrets of the "Star Wars" 
defense system to the Soviets for $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1988, a Canadian appeals court dismissed a U.S. government request 
to extradite McVey in the Los Angeles case, saying the offense of falsifying 
documents used to ship technology to the Soviet Union did not fall under the 
terms of the U.S.-Canadian extradition treaty.

EVOLVING DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So Bill Honig and the State Board of Education are going to appease the 
fundamentalist Christians by stating in the school textbooks that evolution is 
not an exact science! How reminiscent of the encounter between Hitler and 
Chamberlain in 1939. The religious "right wing" will not see this as anything 
but a victorious foot in the door, as they care nothing for scientific truth. 
Their sole purpose is to force their religious beliefs upon everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
If the Rev. Lou Sheldon and his followers were to expend one-half of the 
energy, money and dedication to improving the world's environment as they do to 
arguing about how the world began, it would be of considerably more value to us 
all.

COSTA MESA COUNCILWOMAN FEARS RAMPS POSE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST; 
</P>
<P>
CALTRANS: SANDRA L. GENIS SAYS SAN DIEGO FREEWAY IMPROVEMENTS WILL BENEFIT 
ARNEL DEVELOPMENT, WHICH EMPLOYS TRANSPORTATION COMMISSIONER BRUCE NESTANDE. 
HER CONCERNS PUZZLE HIGHWAY OFFICIALS AND NESTANDE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Costa Mesa councilwoman said Thursday that an Orange County-based member of 
the California Transportation Commission may have a built-in conflict of 
interest on matters involving planned freeway ramps in her city. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Sandra L. Genis said Thursday that she is concerned about planned 
on- and off-ramps that will benefit current and planned commercial and 
residential projects of Costa Mesa-based Arnel Development Co. next to the 
northbound lanes of the San Diego Freeway between Bear Street and Fairview 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
Genis said she is concerned that Caltrans in the past has objected to those 
ramps but that Arnel Vice President Bruce Nestande, a former county supervisor 
and current member of the California Transportation Commission, may try to 
persuade the agency to approve them. 
</P>
<P>
Nestande, however, said Thursday that he has "never had anything to do with the 
ramp issue" and that it was the city -- not the Arnel firm -- that insisted on 
plans for a new ramp that would be built next to Arnel's project on South Coast 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The Arnel firm has agreed to pay for the ramp improvements to secure city 
approval of its development plans, but Genis said Caltrans has opposed 
installation of those ramps, partly because they would be too close together 
and would chiefly benefit new development in the area. 
</P>
<P>
However, Caltrans engineer Walt Hagen said Thursday that, to his knowledge, 
Nestande has never talked to Caltrans about the ramp projects and the agency 
does not oppose them. 
</P>
<P>
"We've come up with a system (of ramps) that we think will work," Hagen said. 
</P>
<P>
Hagen added that it's a standing policy of Caltrans to ask cities to come up 
with developer or other financing for such improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Told that Caltrans no longer opposes the ramps, Genis said: "See what I mean? 
Who got them to back off?" 
</P>
<P>
Hagen said he does not recall a dispute over the ramps and added that all 
negotiations have been between Caltrans and Costa Mesa officials. 
</P>
<P>
Genis, meanwhile, clarified comments attributed to her in a story published 
Thursday in The Times in which she criticized Nestande's role in recommending 
creation of a facilities district and in urging Costa Mesa officials to be more 
aggressive in seeking state funds, both of which could save the Arnel firm 
money. A facilities district would allow developers to spread their fees for 
traffic improvements over 20 to 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Genis said that she was responding to questions posed by a Times reporter and 
that she has no independent knowledge of Nestande's actions. 
</P>
<P>
Nestande had said he remembered making such recommendations to city officials. 
But he added that he sees no conflict with his role as a state transportation 
commissioner since the decisions affecting Arnel will be made by Caltrans, not 
the California Transportation Commission.

OLD GANG AT EL TORO AWAITING CAPISTRANO VALLEY'S SHAHEEN

MISSION VIEJO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four years ago, Paul Shaheen was looking forward to enrolling at El Toro High 
School with longtime friends Ken Romaniszyn, Kevin Rowe, Mike Miller and David 
Cuttrell and playing on the school's football team. 
</P>
<P>
Shaheen played flag football and Little League baseball with his friends. 
Rowe's father, Sam, was his Little League coach. Later, the boys developed into 
some of the top athletes at Serrano Junior High, one of the feeder schools to 
El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
"I started kindergarten in El Toro, and was really looking forward to going to 
El Toro High School," Shaheen said. 
</P>
<P>
But Shaheen's parents called a family audible and moved to Mission Viejo before 
Shaheen's freshman year. Shaheen's prep football career would begin at rival 
Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't very happy leaving my friends, and I didn't know anybody at Capo," 
Shaheen said. 
</P>
<P>
Shaheen made the adjustment to his new school moments after he put on a helmet. 
He quickly earned a reputation as the fastest running back on Capistrano 
Valley's freshman team, and he scored the winning touchdown in an 8-6 victory 
over El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
Shaheen will have another reunion with his friends when Capistrano Valley plays 
host to El Toro at 7:30 tonight in a game that will determine the South Coast 
League champion and the No. 1-ranked team in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
It has been two years since Shaheen saw the old gang. He had broken his leg in 
the third game of his sophomore season and was sidelined for the rest of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he earned a starting spot on the varsity in the third game but broke 
his nose in practice three days later and lost the position to Chi Chi Biehn. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some doubts whether Paul could make it through a season," said Eric 
Patton, Capistrano Valley coach. "He's been kind of snake-bitten. After he 
broke his nose, he never got his momentum back." 
</P>
<P>
Shaheen said he lost some of his speed after breaking his leg, but he was fast 
enough to finish second in the league's 100-meter sprint to San Clemente's Tim 
Martin last year with a time of 10.8. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been fast," he said. "I've slowed down a little by bulking up, but 
my goal every game is to gain 100 yards. I figure if I get 100 yards, I've done 
my part." 
</P>
<P>
Shaheen, who is 5-feet-9 and 180 pounds, has gained 947 yards in 142 carries, a 
6.7-yard average, and has scored 10 touchdowns. He gained more than 100 yards 
in six of Capistrano Valley's first seven games, but has missed the mark the 
past two games, against Irvine and Dana Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"I've let down a little," Shaheen said. "The line has been great, but I've had 
a problem keeping up the intensity the past two weeks. I tend to play up to the 
level of the competition." 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley has won nine consecutive games coming off a 6-5 record last 
year, a surprise to some people. But Shaheen said he and his teammates never 
doubted that the 1989 season was going to be a good year for Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We put last year behind us," he said. "We had a lot of starters coming back, 
especially at the skilled positions. Our quarterback (Tony Solliday) was the 
key returner. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew Mission Viejo was the favorite to win the league, and then El Toro. We 
were picked to finish third, but we knew what we could do and it's been an 
advantage being the underdog. 
</P>
<P>
"I still don't feel we've gotten the respect a 9-0 team deserves. We're not as 
big as Mission or El Toro, but we're quicker. We beat Oceanside, Edison and 
Mission, and those were big teams. The Edison game was the big confidence 
builder." 
</P>
<P>
Shaheen gained 144 yards and scored two touchdowns in Capistrano Valley's 37-10 
victory over Edison. Capistrano Valley jumped from 10th to third in the Orange 
County Sportswriters' Assn. poll after the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't played real well the last two weeks, but we didn't lose, either," 
Shaheen said. "We've been looking forward to this game all year, and I'm sure 
all the guys I went to school with in El Toro will be trying extra hard to stop 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Patton describes Shaheen as a compact runner and credits much of his success to 
his keeping low to the ground on his carries. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't fumble," Patton said. "I don't know what the future has in store 
for him, but he's got some fun memories coming from this year."

CLIFFORD HELPS MATER DEI KEEP TITLE HOPES ALIVE WITH VICTORY

<P>
Taking a page from an opponent and a friend, Mater Dei High School's Kealii 
Clifford took matters onto his legs Thursday, rushing for 155 yards, scoring 
four touchdowns and leading his team to a 35-24 Angelus League victory over 
Servite at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The victory clinched second place for Mater Dei. The Monarchs will share the 
championship if St. Paul upsets Bishop Amat tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Servite came into the game having won the past three meetings between the 
teams, in large part because of Derek Brown. Three years ago, as a sophomore, 
Brown rushed for 334 yards and scored four touchdowns. Last season, he ran for 
246 yards and scored five touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
After that performance, then-Mater Dei coach Chuck Gallo said: "I'm oh-so-happy 
to see him graduate. I'd pay for his college education." 
</P>
<P>
Brown is gone, as is Gallo. Clifford, a senior who has started at running back 
since he was a sophomore, knew this would be his last chance to win one against 
Servite. 
</P>
<P>
He had performed well in games against Servite -- rushing for 65 yards and two 
touchdowns last season -- but always there was Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't exactly say I was overshadowed by him, but hey, Derek was Derek, he 
was hard to ignore," Clifford said. "We're friends. We met at a track meet. I 
wasn't trying to show him up, but wanted to prove myself the way he had." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take long for that. Clifford ran for 19 yards on Mater Dei's first 
play from scrimmage. That drive eventually stalled, but a second went 43 yards 
and ended with quarterback Danny O'Neil completing a five-yard touchdown pass 
to tight end Terry Flannigan. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei (6-4 overall, 3-1 in league) recovered a Servite fumble on the 
ensuing kickoff and drove another 30 yards with Clifford scoring from a yard 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Servite (3-7, 1-3), meanwhile, was having all kinds of problems. The Friars' 
offense didn't enter Mater Dei territory in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei took a 21-0 lead by halftime, the final first-half score coming on a 
19-yard pass from O'Neil to Clifford. O'Neil completed 10 of 13 passes for 112 
yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
His second came late in the third quarter on an eight-yard pass to Clifford, 
who caught three passes for 37 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Servite rallied for two touchdowns midway through the fourth quarter -- the 
first a 10-yard pass from quarterback Rob Walker to John Garrigan, the second a 
five-yard pass to John Kroll -- and followed each with a two-point conversion 
to pull to within 28-16. 
</P>
<P>
But Clifford ended any thoughts of a miracle comeback when he scored on a 
seven-yard run with 1:47 left. 
</P>
<P>
Servite score on a a seven-yard from Walker to Garrigan and added another 
two-point conversion with 29 seconds left in the game.

EL MODENA DEFEATS FOOTHILL, 35-21, STARTS TO COMPUTE PLAYOFF POSSIBILITIES

It took El Modena High School Coach Bill Backstrom almost as long to explain 
the playoff possibilities in the Century League as it did for his team to 
defeat rival Foothill, 35-21, Thursday night in Fred Kelly Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The waiting game could be the hardest part because El Modena needs some help 
from Santa Ana and Villa Park tonight if it hopes to earn the No. 3 berth in 
the six-team league with a 3-6-1 record and 2-3 league mark. Here's the 
scenario tonight: 
</P>
<P>
Co-leaders Villa Park and Santa Ana, both 3-1, play Canyon (1-3) and Santa Ana 
Valley (2-1), respectively. If all goes to form and the leaders win, El Modena 
will earn the final playoff berth by virtue of its victories over Santa Ana 
Valley and Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
Backstrom is leery that little has gone to form in the Century League this 
year. He only needs to be reminded of a 32-6 loss last week to Canyon that put 
his team in a must-win situation against Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
The worst scenario for El Modena would be if Canyon upsets Villa Park, forcing 
a four-way tie for second place. A coin flip would determine the league's No. 2 
and No. 3 entries to the Division III playoffs which begin next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Backstrom is well aware of the consequences of a coin flip. Three years ago, El 
Modena finished in a three-way tie for second in the league and was the odd 
team out, missing the playoffs for the first time in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
El Modena was certainly in playoff form against Foothill. The Vanguards scored 
on their opening three possessions to take a 21-0 lead as tailback Adam Garcia 
threw option passes of 20 and 14 yards for touchdowns and ran six yards for 
another score. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia moved to running back two weeks ago, but the junior still gets his hands 
on the ball. He completed three passes for 60 yards and rushed for 75 yards in 
20 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill (4-6, 2-2) made a strong comeback in the second half behind the 
running of junior Sean Saunders. Saunders led all rushers with 83 yards and 
also scored a touchdown and a two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill moved to within a touchdown, 28-21, with 3:07 remaining when Gregory 
Clark caught a 16-yard touchdown pass from quarterback John Shanahan and 
Saunders scored on a two-point run.

Ocean View High School rallied for 15 points in the fourth quarter to avert an 
upset and claim a share of the Sunset League championship with a 15-7 victory 
over Marina. 
</P>
<P>
For three quarters, the Seahawks (7-3 overall, 4-1 in league) self-destructed, 
getting penalized 11 times for 130 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Marina (2-8, 0-5) scored on its first possession for a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Rogers capped a 52-yard drive with a three-yard touchdown run but on the 
conversion, Rogers sliced his kick wide right and Marina held a 7-6 lead with 
9:19 to play. 
</P>
<P>
But after Ocean View's defense held, Seahawk quarterback Randy Karliner found 
Scott Caringella behind the Marina secondary for a 60-yard touchdown pass that 
put Ocean View ahead, 12-7. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

EVANS RETURNS TO START AT BAJA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Evan Evans had just driven his Jeep Cherokee to four straight victories in the 
production sedan class of desert off-road racing when he went motorcycle riding 
one night last July near his home in Riverside, hit a hole in the darkness and 
wound up paralyzed from the chest down. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, 24, son of well-known truck racer Walker Evans, accumulated enough 
points before the accident that going into the final event of the High Desert 
Racing Assn./SCORE International season -- the Baja 1000 -- he needs only to 
start the race to win the class championship. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who spent 3 1/2 months in three hospitals before entering the Casa 
Colina Rehabilitation Center in Pomona, was released from Casa Colina only last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he is in Ensenada, Mexico, to start the Baja 1000 and assure himself 
enough points to edge out Swedish-born Arne Gunnarson of Fallbrook for the 
Class 6 championship. The Cherokee has been fitted with special hand controls 
for the throttle and brake so Evans can drive. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot of time to think about what I wanted to do with the rest of my 
life while I was lying in the hospital, and I decided I wanted to stay in 
racing," Evans said from Ensenada. "The doctors advised against it, but when I 
insisted, they said OK. At least about this race. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll only drive a few miles because I'm still not in very good condition to 
take all the bouncing and jostling you get in an off-road race, but it's a 
start." 
</P>
<P>
Evans will turn the Cherokee over to Brian Stewart of Lakeside, son of veteran 
driver Ivan Stewart. Brian Stewart will share the long ride the length of Baja 
California to La Paz with Phil Farieo of Rancho California. 
</P>
<P>
"Brian has done a terrific job with the car," Evans said. "He won the Gold 
Coast 300 with it and that kept me out in front in points because it knocked 
the other guys back a spot." 
</P>
<P>
Evans won the Mojave 250, the Mint 400, in which he was the only Class 6 driver 
to finish the extremely difficult course; the Baja Internacional, which had to 
be moved from Ensenada to San Felipe when ranchers protested the route; and the 
Fireworks 250. 
</P>
<P>
Evan, who was driven to the Ensenada starting line Wednesday by his mother, 
Dolly, has 127 points to 99 for Gunnarsson, a Saab driver who won the sedan 
class in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd been riding down that road where I crashed since I was 8 years old," Evans 
said. "But that day, some construction workers had dug a hole and left it 
without any blinking lights or anything and when I rode that night, I ran into 
it. The next thing I knew I was laying on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Evan's father, Walker, is entered in the full-size pickup class. He recently 
won the Brush Run 101 in Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
In the mini-pickup class, Roger Mears of Bakersfield in a Nissan and Manny 
Esquerra of Parker, Ariz., in a Ford will battle for the Class 7 championship. 
Mears leads by two points over Esquerra, who has won the past four series 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
The complaints that led to the Baja Internacional's being moved have caused a 
change in the start of today's race. Instead of racing out of Ensenada east 
toward San Felipe in the usual manner, the competitors will parade at legal 
speeds for 31 miles to Ojos Negros before restarting race-style and head south 
through Mike's Sky Rancho to Camalu and on to La Paz. 
</P>
<P>
MOTORCYCLES -- Motocross rider Jeff Ward of Mission Viejo was honored by the 
American Motorcyclist Assn. as its athlete of the year. Ward won the national 
500cc championship, becoming the first to win all four AMA motocross titles,

award winners were road racer Randy Mamola, for his work in the "Save the 
Children" program, and Supercross champion Jeff Stanton, who received the first 
Mickey Thompson Award of Excellence. 
</P>

night's 30-lap main event at Ascot. One race, the Don Peabody Classic on Nov. 
18, remains after this week. 
</P>
<P>

went from Southern California to the British Speedway League will be in Friday

appearances before racing in England next season will be Mike Faria of Colton 
and Billy Hamill of Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Sam Ermolenko of Cypress is out with injuries, but upholding 
the family honor will be Charles (Dukey) Ermolenko. 
</P>
<P>
MIDGETS -- The United States Auto Club's western regional series battle between

'JUNGLE BOOK' ASSUMES A DARKER, EXOTIC LOOK;

THEATER: SCR YOUNG CONSERVATORY PLAYERS PRESENT A STYLISTIC KIPLING CLASSIC. 
NEW AGE-LIKE MUSIC AND SETS GIVE A TRIBAL FEELING.

<P>
Director B.J. Dodge, whose production of "The Jungle Book" opens Saturday, 
intends to prove that children's theater isn't all fairy tales and clowns. 
</P>
<P>
"Our version is very Asian, done with masks," said Dodge, whose South Coast 
Repertory Young Conservatory Players production, an adaptation of Rudyard 
Kipling's classic stories, will be staged in Founders Hall at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no attempt to fool anybody into thinking these are really animals. You 
see the actors, you see the masks come on and there's a transformation. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, Disney sort of got into everybody's collective consciousness," Dodge 
said of the movie version of "The Jungle Book." "But if you can't have the 
dancing bear and Louis Prima, you do something different." 
</P>
<P>
Music by Lizabeth Woodies plays an integral role in the stage production. "It's 
kind of New Age," Dodge said. "There's a talking drum, a slat drum, maracas, a 
guitar, bells and gongs. You hear leaves crunch, birdcalls and a kind of 
leitmotif for each animal. 
</P>
<P>
"There's also a recorded chorus that doesn't sound anything like the music of 
western civilization." 
</P>
<P>
Dwight Richard Odle, the South Coast Repertory set and costume designer 
responsible for the deft, professional look of many Players productions, 
explained that the aim was to create a tribal feeling and to avoid a "cartoon 
approach." 
</P>
<P>
"All of our shows have a very strong literary base," Odle said, "This isn't 
just children's theater of dancing clowns or whatever. This show is not for 
very young children. It's a little bit darker than we've done in the past." 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the wolves are a little scary "because that's what wolves are by 
their nature. Older children will be able to see that there isn't a genuine 
threat there." 
</P>
<P>
Odle had to compensate for the limitations of the small arena stage in Founders 
Hall by making "the stage pictures as interesting (and environmental) as 
possible." Thus, a jungle clearing is created with grass matting, ramps and 
vines, and for olfactory impact, "a lot of eucalyptus leaves. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to fireproof all those eucalyptus leaves," Odle said ruefully. "There 
was a lot more to it than clearing out the back yard and throwing it on the 
set." 
</P>
<P>
Costumes in greens, golds and rusts reflect jungle and leaf motifs, based on 
Indonesian and Indian styles, with a fullness that Odle said suggests an 
androgynous, animal-type body. 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Will Huddleston, whose other works for children include plays about 
Amelia Earhart and the mythological Perseus, is looking forward to seeing the 
Players staging of his adaptation. 
</P>
<P>
A director at the California Theatre Center in Sunnyvale, Huddleston has 
produced the play twice himself. He was intrigued when told of Dodge's plans. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds exciting," he said, "a stylistic theatricalization that should work 
well." 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the play's seriousness, Huddleston said, "Kipling's jungle 
stories have a lot of adult themes. Mowgli, the jungle boy, is truly an 
outsider. He doesn't belong in either the world of the jungle or the world of 
man, but he finds (his own) strength in that." 
</P>
<P>
Dodge avoided seeing Huddleston's staging because "I might not have been able 
to find a hook for myself," she said. "My feeling when I read it was, 'Oh, this 
is an adoption story.' 
</P>
<P>
"It's so much about how the animals raise him, teach him and are responsible 
for him. That's what a family does, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
But then, "Mowgli has to leave to find out he must create his own world." 
</P>
<P>
Dodge, who has taught in the Young Conservatory for nine years and teaches 
acting full time at California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, sees the play 
as a challenge to both the audience and the young actors (ages 12 to 17, plus a 
few adults up to age 30). 
</P>
<P>
"The actors don't leave the area of performance," she said. "I wanted them to 
sustain their own concentration. And, if the audience sees the actors in that 
engagement, it's an indirect encouragement to stay tuned in." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel kids should have theater that is not condescending," she said, "theater 
that is good quality and challenging. One of the most gratifying things," she 
added, "is to teach for so long and finally be able to practice what you 
preach." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Jungle Book" plays through Nov. 19 in Founders Hall, Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa, Saturdays and 
Sundays at 1 and 3:30 p.m., next Friday at 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $7. (714) 
957-4033.

DEL FUEGOS BAND SEARCHES FOR ITS STAGE PERSONALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a mid-career derailment two years ago, the Del Fuegos band is attempting 
a comeback. All those empty seats Wednesday night at the Coach House showed 
that once a band takes a false step before it is safely established, it is not 
easy to lure back its audience. 
</P>
<P>
Playing to no more than 100 or so listeners (some of whom may have availed 
themselves of free tickets, like the ones that were stacked near the cash 
register at Costa Mesa's Music Market record store the afternoon of the show), 
Del Fuegos, now on its fourth album, was on the same footing as a band just 
starting out. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, Del Fuegos showed that it can learn from mistakes: The 
75-minute set steered clear of material from "Stand Up," the tepid 1987 album 
that sapped the band's career momentum and led to a revamping of its personnel. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the show did not fully exploit what is perhaps Del Fuegos' 
most important comeback move of all: the release of a strong new album, 
"Smoking in the Fields," which features more personal songwriting on the part 
of front man Dan Zanes than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Del Fuegos' musicians, who have just begun to tour again, are probably still 
developing a group personality with the two new members recruited by Zanes and 
the band's co-founder, bassist Tom Lloyd. While it is a solidly rocking unit 
that is clearly more skillful than the original band, the new Del Fuegos lineup 
still has not meshed to the point where it can invest those good new songs with 
the ferocity and depth of emotion to make them take on a special life in 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is Zanes' limits as a singer. He has a narrow range and a 
growly, nasal voice that is about as pretty as a hacking cough. Some singers 
operating under similar handicaps turn weakness into strength by mixing up 
their phrasings and voicings, struggling against their limits in a way that 
makes their singing all the more affecting (Tom Waits and the Replacements' 
Paul Westerberg come to mind). Zanes sang forcefully, but not resourcefully, 
which often led to a sense of sameness from song to song. 
</P>
<P>
One example was "Stand by You." A simple and touching country tune from the new 
album, it lost its intimacy on stage because Zanes did not bring enough of a 
delicate shading to his raspy singing. 
</P>
<P>
It would also have helped if Zanes could have personalized the show by reaching 
out to the audience with effective storytelling or scene-setting on song 
introductions. But aside from some friendly but rather routine banter about 
Zanes celebrating his birthday (he turned 28 Wednesday), Del Fuegos did not try 
to reach out and exploit the potential intimacy of the situation -- a small 
turnout of die-hard fans. 
</P>
<P>
With music deeply grounded in the styles of such precursors as the Rolling 
Stones, Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers and Bruce Springsteen, Del Fuegos 
cannot lay claim to originality. By supplying enough intensity, though, it 
still should be able to grab hold of a listener. At the Coach House, the 
musicians reached that level just a few times. 
</P>
<P>
Adam Roth, the new lead guitarist, is a sharp musician who consistently spun 
out forceful and well-etched solo lines. But he cut a somewhat hesitant and 
reluctant figure on the stage, which blunted the unified, all-fronts attack 
that a band such as Del Fuegos must mount to succeed. The new drummer, Joe 
Donnelly, is another strong musician but a somewhat taciturn performer. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Del Fuegos never really faltered after a slow start and hit some 
impressive peaks. "I Still Want You" featured Zanes' most diverse and deeply 
felt singing, as well as a dynamic tandem guitar passage. "Breakaway" was an 
urgent and catchy new song, while "No No Never" and "The Offer" were delivered 
with some real bar-band rawness and fire. 
</P>
<P>
Del Fuegos may not have the potential to be much more than a fiery bar band -- 
but there is nothing at all wrong with fiery bar bands. What this new lineup 
has to do is turn up that fire with a bit more consistency and vocal ingenuity. 
</P>
<P>
James McMurtry is another limited singer who stays pretty much on an even keel. 
But, opening with a three-man band behind him, the son of novelist Larry 
McMurtry made sense with his laconic vocal style and measured heartland rock. 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry's closely observed songs speak warily of small towns and small minds. 
He avoids the usual rock cliches of glorifying small-town life or, conversely, 
of speaking in epic terms of the escape from the stifling small-town existence. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, McMurtry focuses on the toll taken by the conformist mind set of the 
small town, with its intolerance for thoughts or actions that fall outside 
accepted norms (McMurtry may well mean for us to see that this small-town way 
of thinking is really emblematic of the dominant American mind set, regardless 
of population densities and demographic particulars). 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry sang the way his characters think: with a caution and reticence that 
comes from not expecting much from life, and from fear of what others might 
think should too much be revealed. 
</P>
<P>
Some dryly humorous lyrical touches and the rich, energetic interplay of 
McMurtry's acoustic rhythm guitar with David Grissom's lead electric guitar 
gave the 45-minute set a rounded feeling. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it would be good for McMurtry to drop that guarded persona from time to 
time and explore moments in which his characters let their emotions -- 
touching, frightening, messy or otherwise -- spill forth without restraint.

JEAN-LUC PONTY'S MUSICAL MIRROR TELLS WHERE HE CAN STILL IMPROVE; 
</P>
<P>
PERFORMANCE: FRENCH CONTEMPORARY-JAZZ VIOLINIST, WHO WILL PLAY TONIGHT IN 
ANAHEIM, TAKES STOCK ON TOUR -- AWAY FROM AUDIENCE PRESSURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART

<TEXT>
<P>
Jean-Luc Ponty was in the middle of a musical self-examination when reached by 
phone earlier this week, in his Seattle hotel: The contemporary-jazz violinist 
was listening to tapes of his band's concert the previous night in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bit like looking at oneself in the mirror," the 47-year-old French-born 
Los Angeles resident chuckled in a French accent. 
</P>
<P>
"I make notes of everyone's mistakes, including my own, though I prefer not to 
count them." 
</P>
<P>
Ponty -- who, as part of a six-week leg in his 1989-90 world tour will play 
tonight at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim and Saturday and Sunday at the 
Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles -- finds this aural poking around helpful. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes what we play sounds quite different from what we imagine on stage, 
so it's very useful to improve the show," he said. "I tape every night, mostly 
at the beginning of a tour. If we play really bad, or really well, then I want 
to check it out on tape." 
</P>
<P>
You will not hear many mistakes from Ponty, who has been a jazzman, in one form 
or another, for more than 20 years. In a manner somewhat akin to Fred Astaire's 
approach to his filmed dance routines, Ponty rehearses extensively before he 
embarks on a tour. 
</P>
<P>
"That way, the first day doesn't sound like it's the first day, it sounds like 
we're already rolling," he said. "Still, once on stage, there's the pressure of 
the audience and so on." Hence, the taping. 
</P>
<P>
The violinist, who graduated from the Conservatoire du Paris at age 17, is 
touring with a crew of familiar colleagues. Drummer Rayford Griffin, bassist 
Baron Browne, guitarist Jamie Glaser and keyboardist Wally Minko have all 
traveled with Ponty; additionally, Glaser has appeared with the violinist off 
and on since the late '70s, Griffin and Browne steadily since the early '80s. 
The fivesome also recorded Ponty's recent "Storytelling" album. This 
familiarity eases many of the potential strains that accompany the art of 
music-making. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a nice combination," Ponty said. "They work as unit, there's no one 
trying to pull the cover to himself. They really work for the music first. And 
when I bring them new music, it goes much faster because it's already a band." 
</P>
<P>
Ponty had so much fun on his last world tour with his partners that he felt he 
had to get them into the studio to "capture the energy and excitement they had 
while playing on the road," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The result is "Storytelling." 
</P>
<P>
"It's more of a basic album: just go in the studio and play, with very little 
adding of studio embellishments, if you like," he said. "I wasn't trying to 
prove anything, in terms of composition or performance. I just wanted to have 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
Ponty, who uses both a Zeta solid-body electronic violin and a traditional 
Barcus-Berry open-bodied model on stage, composes at home either at the 
Synclavier (an electronic keyboard that's hooked up to a computer) or the 
piano. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll usually improvise for a while and then play it back, and if I find an 
interesting idea, I develop it into a tune," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The violinist also gets inspiration from his environment, as was the case with 
"Amazon Forest," off the new release. "I was in this huge botanical garden in 
Rio de Janeiro in May, 1988," he recalled. "The place had luxurious, 
jungle-type vegetation, a rich and varied beauty, and as I was walking around 
-- there were very few other people there -- I started hearing this music in my 
head. I kept singing it all the way back to the hotel so I wouldn't lose it," 
he said, laughing. "I took that beginning fragment and developed it into what 
you hear on the record." 
</P>
<P>
A world tour that takes Ponty away from his wife and family for weeks at a time 
is just another facet of the musical life that Ponty willingly accepts. 
</P>
<P>
"I love performing, and since I have to go on the road to perform, I go on the 
road," he said. "But if I had a choice between Cleveland and Tahiti in 
December, naturally I'd go to Tahiti. But since to perform I have to go to 
Cleveland, I'll be delighted to be there in December." 
</P>
<P>
With a career that has included about 20 solo releases and appearances on 
record and in person with the likes of Frank Zappa, Stephane Grappelli, Elton 
John and George Duke, Ponty feels blessed. "Music gives me one of the greatest 
satisfactions in my life," he said. "Together with my wife and family, that's 
the only thing so dear. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel lucky," and here he paused, gathering his words, "to have been able to 
do something I love and make a living with it. It's an incredible fulfillment. 
Plus, music is therapy for me." 
</P>
<P>
He added, laughing out loud: "I might be a mental case if it wasn't for music 
relieving my emotions." 
</P>
<P>
 Jean-Luc Ponty plays at 8 tonight at the Celebrity Theatre, 201 E. Broadway, 
Anaheim. Tickets: $20. Information: (714) 999-9536.

ORIGINAL T.S.O.L. BAND WILL REUNITE -- FOR 1 BIG PAYDAY; 
</P>
<P>
PUNK: TRUE SOUNDS OF LIBERTY WAS A CHARISMATIC, UNPREDICTABLE AND BIG-DRAWING 
GROUP. ITS ONE-NIGHT STAND IN ANAHEIM IS ANGERING MEMBERS OF A BAND THAT 
CARRIED ON THE NAME.

<P>
For anyone nostalgic or curious about the early-'80s punk rock explosion in 
Orange County, deja vu is scheduled to set in on Dec. 29, when the original 
lineup of T.S.O.L. will reunite at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim. It will be 
the four founding members' first show together since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
T.S.O.L. (True Sounds of Liberty) made a reputation as one of the most 
charismatic, stormily unpredictable and, at its peak, biggest-drawing bands on 
the Southern California punk scene before dwindling popularity and an 
acrimonious split ended the original lineup's run. 
</P>
<P>
The show, promoted by Goldenvoice Presents, is a one-time get-together and does 
not signal an attempt to re-form the original T.S.O.L. on a continuing basis, 
singer Jack Grisham said Wednesday.

"We never had a chance" to play a big farewell concert when the band broke up 
in 1983, Grisham said. "The last show we played was in the Cathay de Grande (in 
Los Angeles) on a Wednesday night, and there were about 100 people there." 
</P>
<P>
The original T.S.O.L. broke up when Grisham and drummer Todd Barnes parted with 
bassist Mike Roche and guitarist Ron Emory, who revamped the band with new 
members and a more blues-influenced hard-rock approach. 
</P>
<P>
That Phase 2 T.S.O.L., with Roche now the only remaining founding member, has 
continued to tour and record since 1984 and is scheduled to release its fifth 
album, "Strangelove," next year on Enigma Records. 
</P>
<P>
Grisham said the original T.S.O.L. members decided to set aside their 
still-lingering personal differences to play one more show featuring their old 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't even talked to each other for the past four years," he said. "They 
got us together little by little, in twos. Ron Emory was just over to my house 
today (to talk about the reunion show). It was the first time he'd been here in 
five years." 
</P>
<P>
As of Wednesday, the day tickets for the concert went on sale, the four 
original T.S.O.L. members still had not met together as a unit, Grisham said. 
</P>
<P>
The main motive for the reunion is "for the hell of it," Grisham said. "It'll 
be kind of fun." 
</P>
<P>
But it also holds the prospect of a big payday. The money "helps -- they're 
paying us a lot," he acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Grisham said, attention from the T.S.O.L. reunion could help in promoting 
his current band, Tender Fury, which is due to release its second album, 
"Garden of Evil," in January. Emory's new group, Lunchbox, will also be 
releasing a debut album next year. 
</P>
<P>
While the reunion figures to please older punk rock fans looking to relive 
younger and wilder days, as well as newer fans hoping to see what it was like 
the first time around, it is a source of friction within the current T.S.O.L. 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been put to us as a one-time show, so we just hope it comes and goes, and 
we get on with our career," said drummer Mitch Dean, who joined T.S.O.L. in 
1984 with singer Joe Wood, beginning the band's second incarnation. 
</P>
<P>
"Me and Joe have both said we don't like the idea of it, but we haven't been 
left much of a choice. I just feel it's confusing our audience at a touchy 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Wood, who is Jack Grisham's brother-in-law, was more blunt in voicing his 
disapproval: "It would be a rip-off to the public. It's a one-night thing of 
four guys who want quick money. They don't care about the old music." 
</P>
<P>
According to Dean, Roche's commitment to the ongoing T.S.O.L. had led him to 
dismiss previous reunion offers for the original lineup. Roche could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"For years he was adamantly against a show like this," said Mike Zoto, manager 
of the current T.S.O.L. "I think in his heart he didn't want to do this, but 
other factors besides his heart forced him to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be an event, there's no question about it," Zoto said of the 
original band's reunion, but the ongoing version of T.S.O.L. will now have "a 
lot of internal reconciliation to deal with."

STYLE: 'SENSIBLE' SHOES CHANGE THEIR SPOTS TO MATCH FASHIONS

<P>
Deena Simmons slipped on a pair of black suede loafers and marched over to the 
nearest mirror. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh gosh, it's like putting on a pair of gloves!" she said, parading around the 
shoe department of Robinson's in Newport Beach in flat heels. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always liked lower heels, and I love the new styles," said the Trabuco 
Canyon resident. "They're really comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Her mother, Gail Leslie of Villa Park, sat nearby wearing a pair of 
leopard-print pumps with three-inch spikes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel dressed up unless I have high heels on," Leslie said. 
</P>
<P>
"She's crazy," her daughter said. 
</P>
<P>
Mother and daughter represent opposing sides of an ongoing feud between women 
wanting low heels for comfort and those wanting high heels for style. 
</P>
<P>
This season, anyway, Simmons and all who favor lower heels appear to have the 
upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Flat shoes have never been as exciting," said Jack Miles, couture buyer for I. 
Magnin stores in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"The designers are doing more to them. They're adding appliques and all kinds 
of ornaments. The leopard shoes are walking out like crazy." 
</P>
<P>
High or low, shoe designs follow closely on the heels of major fashion trends, 
according to Michele Love, salon shoe buyer for Nordstrom at South Coast Plaza 
in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as animal prints infiltrated ready-to-wear clothing, spots and stripes 
turned up on everything from sandals to knee-high boots. Several designers came 
out with animal print pumps. 
</P>
<P>
Those who don't want to look like they just came in from the jungle can tread 
in something a little more tame, such as Anne Klein's black suede pump with a 
leopard print heel, which sells for $127 at Nordstrom. 
</P>
<P>
To match the vivid colors of the fall collections, everyone suddenly turned to 
suede. Liz Claiborne and 9 West both introduced a line of suede pumps in rich 
tones such as purple, teal, royal blue and emerald green, which sell for about 
$60 at Robinson's. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the spice colors and rich jewel tones translate well into suede," Love 
said. "They match the ready-to-wear colors perfectly." 
</P>
<P>
Many have rediscovered suede's versatility. The material can be stamped with a 
paisley print or cut into unusual appliques and designs. Perry Ellis created a 
suede pump in a patchwork of blues, greens and purples, available at I. Magnin 
for $145. 
</P>
<P>
Royal colors in suede suited another major clothing trend, the courtly 
"Dangerous Liaisons" look. 
</P>
<P>
Women needed shoes to stand up to the season's lush velvet jackets with heavy 
gold embroidery, the sequined sweaters and gold lame skirts and dresses. 
</P>
<P>
Shoe designers responded with rich-looking materials -- black velvet and shiny 
satin as well as suede -- and adorned them with opulent trims. 
</P>
<P>
A black velvet slipper by Frankie and Baby, for instance, comes garnished with 
large rhinestones of varied shapes and colors. A sparkling black pump by Impo 
has been lavishly covered with multicolored beads in a paisley print. 
</P>
<P>
"Jewels are appearing as footwear ornaments from necklaces on loafers, to 
sprinkled all over, to (one big gem) being placed center stage," said Stuart 
Weitzman, designer and president of the Stuart Weitzman Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Buttons, Fans, Bows and Ornaments 
</P>
<P>
Many designers introduced their own version of what Weitzman calls "the court 
pump, where up-front treatments in buttons, fans, bows or ornaments balance the 
stronger court heels." 
</P>
<P>
His "Mock My Day" moccasin, for example, features a necklace embedded with 
multicolored jewels draped across the top of a jewel-toned suede loafer. His 
"Fanny Brice," an orchid-colored suede court pump, rises high on the foot with 
a pleated fan and suede-covered button gracing the toe. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very much a season for luxury and courtliness," Weitzman said. 
</P>
<P>
Regal fashions have changed the very shape of shoes. Strappy sandals and 
stiletto heels have all but disappeared. The pump has gotten heavier. It now 
chokes up tighter around the foot, to complement the heavier jackets, according 
to Nordstrom's Love. 
</P>
<P>
"The clothing's oversized, so the shoes are oversized," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of her customers have gone for an even heavier look -- cowboy boots that 
reach anywhere from the ankle to the thigh. The boots follow the trail of 
Western wear -- riding pants, fringed leather jackets and other equestrian 
apparel. Like the pumps, they have turned up in every shade of suede with 
plenty of applique and ornaments. 
</P>
<P>
To balance the heavier shoes, heels have gotten fatter. They're wider, with a 
chunky comma shape or with an hourglass figure known as the courtly "Louis 
Heel." 
</P>
<P>
"There's a real emphasis on heel shapes," Love said. 
</P>
<P>
Designers need the stronger heels to balance the gold coins, big buckles, 
chains and other heavy toe accents. 
</P>
<P>
"The wider heels are more comfortable than stilettos and more practical for 
work," Love said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, if not for the wild leopard prints and the big fake gems, this could be 
the season of the sensible shoe.

NO U.S. AID FOR GERMANY YET -- BAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said today that despite the dramatic 
moves in East Germany toward free travel, substantial Western aid for that 
country is unlikely until there is "political pluralism across the board." 
</P>
<P>
"There's a long way to go before there is true freedom and true political 
pluralism in East Germany," Baker said from Washington on ABC's "Good Morning 
America." "That doesn't mean we don't welcome this step." 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Soviet spokesman Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov 
welcomed East Germany's decision to throw open its borders but stressed that 
the border between East and West Germany remains in force and that eased travel 
restrictions should not be taken as heralding the imminent reunification of the 
two Germanys. 
</P>
<P>
"The border still remains, though some might think it ceased to exist," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the Soviet Union is concerned about the instability brought on by 
the mass exodus of East Germans to the West. 
</P>
<P>
But with easier travel, Gerasimov said, "the wanderlust the Germans are famous 
for will go down because now, when you know you can go, maybe you'll postpone 
the decision." 
</P>
<P>
Baker, although calling the open borders "the most dramatic event in East-West 
relations" since the end of World War II, said the United States and other 
allies believe any discussion of an aid program now would be premature. 
</P>
<P>
The allies, he said, will be much more forthcoming about helping East Germany 
only if there is "political pluralism across the board." 
</P>
<P>
The only action taken by the Bush Administration has been an offer of "all 
possible assistance" to the West German government as it struggles to cope with 
the flood of refugees. The Pentagon said it was making available housing for 
980 people in three off-base installations. 
</P>
<P>
"Were we surprised by the speed of it?" Baker asked in a separate interview on 
CBS. "You bet your life, and so was everybody else as far as I can determine." 
</P>
<P>
"It is not enough . . . simply to open borders," Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.), 
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"East Germany should also hold truly democratic elections so that its people 
can have a secure and free future without having to leave their homes," Pell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), a former Foreign Relations Committee chairman, 
said the Administration should be cautious. The East German authorities, he 
said, may be intent on getting rid of "the bad eggs" before moving to restore 
the hard-line system.

5 TONS OF COCAINE FOUND IN N.Y.

Federal agents and police today finished digging more than 5 tons of cocaine 
with a street value of about $851 million from barrels of caustic lye and 
planned to burn the lot. 
</P>
<P>
Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Mark Hannan said the massive stash of 
cocaine weighed 10,648 pounds and was the largest seizure in New York history 
and the third largest in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The cocaine was found a week ago when Customs and DEA agents armed with search 
warrants raided a warehouse in Queens. Agents found 2.2-pound bricks of cocaine 
wrapped in plastic and packed into hundreds of 10-gallon barrels, each topped 
off with caustic lye. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said that the barrels had been shipped from Latin America by Arenal 
Inc. and that federal agents were looking for five suspects they believe are 
linked to the Cali cartel in Colombia.

East Germany's decision to throw open its borders with West Germany will have 
huge implications for the economies of both nations, but visions of an economic 
super-state in the center of Europe seem premature. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Pietsch, economist with Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said today there is no 
doubt trade between the two nations will rise as barriers built up since World 
War II are dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
But he added: "There will not be a huge concentration of economic power. There 
should be no worries about that." 
</P>
<P>
"It will take a long time before we see anything like a combined mass of 
economic potential," said Horst Seidler of the DIW economic research group in 
West Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
The effects of the exodus into West Germany of almost a quarter of a million 
East Germans has prompted economists to raise forecasts for Bonn's domestic 
economic growth, already seen at a booming 4% this year. 
</P>
<P>
The flood of disgruntled people will need everything from houses to pots and 
pans, although this could prove a double-edged sword if inflation takes off as 
a result. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the now crumbling border, political reform would have to 
be backed by market-oriented economic renewal, also boosting East German growth 
in the long term, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
In the immediate future, however, the East German administration, whose key 
players are changing places with startling speed, have to cope with the 
hemorrhage of the mostly young, skilled workers who have already left. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially there will be a weakening of the East German economy," said a senior 
economist with a research unit that closely monitors the economies of Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Workers are disappearing. As the planned economy is wound down, jobs will 
disappear. They will not be replaced immediately by a flood of corporate 
investment from West Germany," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Norbert Walter, senior economist with Deutsche Bank, said: "The loss of 200,000 
people in a country one quarter of the size of West Germany will have four 
times the impact that it would have had here." 
</P>
<P>
The East Germans will also have to decide "which part of the world they want to 
belong to," he added. But there is a strong chance that in the next 10 to 15 
years the whole of Eastern Europe could grow in economic importance. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Federal Statistics Office, West German exports to its neighbor 
jumped 14% in the first eight months of 1989 to $2.6 billion, most from sales 
of capital goods. East Germany sold $2.5 billion worth of goods to West 
Germany, a rise of 6.2%.

The West German stock market surged today in an enthusiastic reaction to the 
historic opening of East Germany's borders. 
</P>
<P>
The key DAX index of 30 leading West German shares jumped 22.50 points, or 
1.5%, to 1,485.4 in early trading. 
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurt bourse, staging what dealers termed an "East Germany rally," was 
pumped up by talk that the influx of East Germans will boost consumption and 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers said construction shares were among the immediate gainers as a further 
flow of East Germans into West Germany would prompt significant new 
construction orders. Dealers said the East German exodus would also provide 
benefits to West German building suppliers, consumer goods and auto makers.

More than 3,700 workers went on strike today at McDonnell Douglas of Canada 
Ltd. despite progress in negotiations, a union leader said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob White, president of the Canadian Auto Workers, said he's optimistic a 
settlement will be reached because "there's been a lot of progress in the last 
12 hours." But White added, "The strike is on." 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian plant, which produces wings for two commercial jets and parts for 
a fighter jet, is currently ahead of schedule. Officials said a strike would 
have to last several weeks before affecting production in the United States.

<P>
Housing prices in Los Angeles moved up slightly during October, and the pace of 
home sales picked up from the previous month, the Los Angeles Board of Realtors 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The upturn almost wiped out the sharp drop in prices and home sales during 
September. However, the inventory of homes for sale remains unusually high, 
reflecting a cautious attitude among would-be home buyers, said J. Blair Pence 
II, president of the board. 
</P>
<P>
The median price was $469,000, up about 2% from September. It was up 12% from 
the $419,000 median price of a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The average price of homes sold in the areas of the city served by the board's 
members rose to $558,378 from the previous month's $520,447, an increase of 
nearly $38,000, or about 7%. It was up about $76,000, or more than 15%, from a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The average is significantly influenced by the high prices of houses in the 
very affluent areas of the city, Pence said. Affordable single-family housing 
is still widely available in many parts of Los Angeles, he said.

BBC REPORTS CHINA JAMS BROADCASTS

The British Broadcasting Corp. said today its Mandarin-language broadcasts to 
China are being jammed for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no possible justification for this deliberate and systematic 
interference with our broadcasts, although it clearly indicates the impact the 
World Service is having inside China as far as the authorities are concerned," 
said John Tusa, managing director of the BBC World Service. 
</P>
<P>
The BBC said the interference typically starts a few minutes before the 
Mandarin transmissions begin and stops shortly after they end. It takes the 
form of a steady, low-frequency noise about 25% as strong as the program signal 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
The BBC said it did not know exactly how long the interference had been taking 
place. There has been evidence of it since June, but it was only positively 
identified this week by a BBC engineer in Beijing, it said. 
</P>
<P>
"Jamming is a practice which violates established broadcasting relations," Tusa 
said. "This latest instance is particularly regrettable at a time when jamming 
from all other Communist countries has ceased." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union stopped jamming BBC Russian service broadcasts in 1987 and 
lifted its interference with BBC Polish broadcasts a year later. 
</P>
<P>
The BBC said World Service broadcasts in English are not being jammed by the 
Chinese, but it is still unclear whether Cantonese language broadcasts are 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
The BBC said it stepped up its Mandarin broadcasts by half an hour in early 
June to a total of three hours daily in response to demands for coverage of the 
student-led demonstrations in China and the government's crackdown.

ROBERT MITCHUM'S BACK IN 'COMPLETE CHARADE'

You can tell the old, retired, slightly run-down gumshoe is back on the job. He 
offers his younger brother, an ex-cop, a pint of Levy's Select Irish Whiskey to 
help out. "House brand," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
So it goes for Robert Mitchum in "Jake Spanner, Private Eye." But his new 
movie, airing Nov. 15 on the USA Network, is not the "Farewell My Lovely" or 
"The Big Sleep" kind of classic Mitchum detective movie. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a complete charade," Mitchum says of this cable venture, which 
co-stars his brother, John, as the ex-cop; a son, Jim, as a cop, and Ernest 
Borgnine as retired mobster Sal (The Salami) Piccolo. 
</P>
<P>
The film, he reports, includes one scene "with a bunch of naked girls around 
the pool. I think it's all done very discreetly." 
</P>
<P>
Students of the cinema may consider "Spanner" close in spoof spirit to 
Mitchum's "His Kind of Woman." That 1951 epic makes one suspect that, during 
filming, the cast partook of strong drink and had fun. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember what it was all about," Mitchum insists. He does recall the 
fun part. And that producer Howard Hughes made the cast film it twice, the idea 
being to make a good film a great one. That was no fun, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchum, whose more recent work includes the two ABC mega-miniseries, "War and 
Remembrance" and "Winds of War," has a dry, sardonic sense of humor befitting a 
star who has logged 46 years in movies and TV movies.

KELLY MCGILLIS QUITS SHAKESPEARE TO HAVE BABY

<P>
Kelly McGillis, the Hollywood actress who put her film career on the back 
burner to give a year's commitment to Shakespeare will leave the company at the 
end of next week because she's expecting a baby. 
</P>
<P>
McGillis, who is two months pregnant, has been advised by doctors not to work 
during her term. Taking a hiatus from her film career, she is now starring in 
the Shakespeare Theatre at the Folger's sold-out production of "Twelfth Night," 
which has garnered rave reviews. McGillis had signed a "seasonal" contract with 
the theater through June but has been released from it. 
</P>
<P>
McGillis, 31, who has been in such films as "Witness," "Top Gun" and "The 
Accused," was set to play lead roles in "Mary Stuart" in February and "The 
Merry Wives of Windsor" in April at the Shakespeare Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"I will miss everyone a lot, but some things are bigger than theater, like 
taking care of another life," said McGillis this week. "I don't like having 
things undone, but at the same time I am happy to be pregnant." 
</P>
<P>
But she said she has regrets about leaving so soon after her much-publicized 
move to the theater from California, considered risky for a top-grossing screen 
star. "The reviews have been very nice, and I love the intimacy of playing 
before a live audience, because you can't lie as an actress," McGillis said of 
her current role. 
</P>
<P>
McGillis, who married yacht broker Fred Tillman last year, declined to comment 
on possible medical complications. She will finish the run of "Twelfth Night" 
-- it closes Nov. 19 -- and then will return to Los Angeles in December.

<P>
The venerable rock group Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash brought music back to 
quake-damaged downtown Santa Cruz in a benefit concert that raised at least 
$21,000 for county relief agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The trio raised spirits and brought 800 concert-goers to their feet with two 
sets of old favorites at the Catalyst nightclub Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash refrained from making benefit 
speeches, letting their guitars do the talking. But Nash introduced a Crosby 
solo of "Almost Cut My Hair" by saying, "If he can make it back from where he's 
been, Santa Cruz can make it back." Nash's remark was apparently in reference 
to Crosby's well-publicized problems with drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The concert concluded with three encores that got the crowd, a mix of yuppies 
and yippies, dancing and singing. Nash dedicated "Our House" to the Cooper 
House, the former county courthouse built in the 1890s and redone as a mixed 
commercial structure. It was severely damaged in the quake and had to be razed. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to visit an old friend while I was here, and it was no longer there," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nash arranged the benefit with longtime tour manager R. Mac Holbert, a Santa 
Cruz native. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's such a thing as altruism, then this is definitely a show of it," 
Holbert said. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate sponsors bought 125 tickets at $100 each, and the rest went for $15.

The admission sheet checking Al Capone into a Pennsylvania prison sold for 
$6,875 at an auction of memorabilia of the famous and infamous. 
</P>
<P>
The admission sheet, signed "Alphonse Capone," was bought Thursday by a

Autograph Auctions. On it, the gangster is listed as "Alphonsus Capone alias Al 
Brown alias Scarface," Darvick said.

Capone was jailed at Eastern State Penitentiary in 1929 after arranging his own 
arrest on gun possession charges to protect himself from George (Bugs) Moran, 
whose gang was largely wiped out that year in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. 
</P>
<P>
Capone's occupation is listed as "Paper &amp; Leather Cutter (Bootlegger)" and

Italian Premier Giulio Andreotti personally selected the model and decorative

Gorbachev will meet with Andreotti in Rome and meet Dec. 1 with Pope John Paul

The fishing village of Burano is the center of traditional Venetian lace 
making, an art that has suffered from industrial competition. It takes three 
days for a pocket handkerchief to be braided in "Burano" stitch.

Senior's long putter, which he tucks under his chin with his left hand and

Pete Rose has no clue when a federal grand jury in Cincinnati will complete an 
investigation of his taxes. 
</P>
<P>
However, Rose inadvertently gave a clue about one avenue for the investigation 
when he said in an interview with the Associated Press that he never claimed 
his race track earnings on his taxes -- a requirement under federal law. He 
said he never did so because he always lost money on his track betting in the 
long run, so he did not feel obliged to report his winnings. 
</P>
<P>
"I guarantee you that over the years, like most of us -- I think the IRS knows 
this -- I will lose more money than I win at the track," Rose said in the 
interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Federal law requires that all gambling winnings must be reported as income but 
can be offset by gambling losses up to the amount that a person won. Just 
because a gambler lost money overall does not excuse them from reporting their 
winnings under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't approach the track as a business," Rose said. "I see guys go over 
there that don't have a job, and they collect every ticket and they stamp it to 
their program and stuff like that and they file at the end of the year (on 
their taxes). 
</P>
<P>
"It was entertainment for me. It wasn't a business. I don't want to sit down 
and start complicating my taxes with Daily Double tickets and Quinella tickets 
and stuff. I don't need all of that."

MARATHON NBA GAME EVEN POOPED OUT THE COMPUTER

Just last month, the Milwaukee Bucks' statistical crew asked the NBA what to do 
if a game went beyond three overtimes, exceeding the limits of the league's new 
computerized statistics system. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on their research, they said they believed there was no need to go 
beyond three overtimes," Bob Wanek, the Bucks' officials scorer, said. 
</P>
<P>
The need came Thursday night when the Bucks took five overtimes to beat the 
Seattle SuperSonics 155-154. (Story, C1) 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine that," said Wanek, who was forced to override the computer for the 
final two overtimes. "You don't expect that to happen right away when you have 
a new computer system." 
</P>
<P>
The game was a nightmare for scorekeepers and coaches. It lasted 257 minutes, 
and six players fouled out. 
</P>
<P>
"You wondered if the game was ever going to end," Bucks forward Ben Coleman 
said. "But I kept feeling like we were going to win. We played too good not to 
win." 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee's Tony Brown sank a three-point shot with 1:10 left in the fifth 
overtime to put the Bucks ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"The game leaves me speechless," Milwaukee Coach Del Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . This game demands some kind of clever statement from the coach. But I 
don't have anything. I'm drained out. I'm just proud of my players and their 
effort." 
</P>
<P>
"Milwaukee made some great plays when they had to make them, and we made some 
when we had to make them," Seattle Coach Bernie Bickerstaff said. "They earned 
the win, but it's too bad someone had to lose." 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time an NBA game went five overtimes since the advent of the 
24-second clock in 1954.

TEEN DIES IN MOTORCYCLE CRASH

A 17-year-old Rossmoor boy died early today shortly after the motorcycle he was 
riding as a passenger went out of control and crashed, the California Highway 
Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
James Englehaupt died at 1:10 a.m. at Long Beach Memorial Hospital, about two 
hours after the accident along St. Albans Drive in Rossmoor, an unincorporated 
Orange County community west of Los Alamitos, CHP spokesman Lyle Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
Englehaupt was a passenger on the off-road motorcycle driven by Michael David 
Winter, 18, also of Rossmoor. Whitten said the pair were headed east on St. 
Albans Drive near Silver Fox Road at an unknown speed when Winter apparently 
lost control of the motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
They crashed into a curb and struck a post, throwing both of them from the 
motorcycle. Englehaupt suffered massive head and internal injuries while 
Winter, who was taken to the same hospital, had a broken arm and other minor 
injuries. Whitten said neither youth was wearing a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
Whitten said officers will ask the Orange County district attorney's office to 
file drunk driving and possibly manslaughter charges against Winter. Whitten 
said the motorcyclist also lacked the proper driver's license.

2 MORE COUNTY HORSES SUCCUMB TO POISONING FROM TAINTED HAY

Two horses apparently stricken with a rare type of food poisoning from tainted 
hay were destroyed in Orange County today as reports of sick horses continued 
to stream in, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the horses died early this morning at the Orange County Fairgrounds 
Equestrian Center, bringing the total to nine that have succumbed to the deadly 
toxin at the Costa Mesa facility. 
</P>
<P>
The other horse died at the Serrano Creek Ranch Equestrian Center in San Juan 
Capistrano, the first Orange County death outside of the fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Three more horses at the fairgrounds were taken ill Thursday and are being 
treated with an experimental antiserum obtained from the Centers for Disease 
Control in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
State health officials this week blamed botulism for the deaths and ordered a 
recall of nearly 1,000 tons of hay cubes believed to be the source of the 
toxin. At least 18 horses in four Southern California counties have died as a 
result of the illness, and many more are sick.
