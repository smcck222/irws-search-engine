COUNTY WOULD FACE COSTLY REPAIRS FOR 'UNSAFE' BRIG; 
</P>
<P>
PRISONS: LOAN OF THE NAVY'S OLD BRIG WOULD EASE JAIL CROWDING, BUT THE FACILITY 
NEEDS $1 MILLION IN REPAIRS.

<P>
The Navy's brig at 32nd Street, offered to San Diego County as a temporary 
solution to crowded county jails, has not met the Navy's own safety or security 
standards for at least four years, according to a report obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Washington Navy officials demanded that the brig either be closed before March, 
1991, or fixed -- a venture that would cost almost $1 million, according to the 
report by the Bureau of Naval Personnel, dated March 23, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The report cites "serious inadequacies" in the old facility, including water 
leaks that produce electrocution hazards, a lack of smoke alarms and poor fire 
sprinklers. Navy officials say they have been able to operate the facility 
safely because they maintain a one-to-one staff/prisoner ratio. 
</P>
<P>
"If the brig was perfect, we wouldn't be abandoning it," said Capt. James G. 
Prout III, commanding officer of the Naval Station at 32nd Street. "While it 
may not meet our standards, it's superior to the alternatives the county faces. 
. . . But they could end up with a terrible black eye (if a prisoner was hurt). 
Then the press would say: 'Why the hell are you putting prisoners there -- look 
what the report said.' " 
</P>
<P>
Because of the brig's decrepit condition, the Navy will transfer 84 prisoners 
from the 32nd Street facility to the new brig at Miramar Naval Air Station. 
This move is scheduled for Dec. 3, one day before county officials must report 
to El Cajon Superior Court Judge James A. Malkus on any plans to use the Navy 
brig. Last month, the Navy broached to the Sheriff's Department the possibility 
of loaning the county the brig for an unspecified time to temporarily relieve 
jail crowding. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 4, county officials must explain to Malkus their solution for easing 
crowding in the county jails. Systemwide, the county jails are housing 297 more 
prisoners than ordered by the court. The downtown jail is now the most crowded. 
Built to house 750 inmates, it holds 1,004. 
</P>
<P>
County officials say the Navy brig offers the best solution. And the Navy 
report, which county officials have not yet seen, threatens to put the kibosh 
on their only option, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone puts you on notice that they are getting out because it is unsafe, 
you have to pose the question, 'Can we then take our inmates in?' " said Ken 
Wigginton, assistant sheriff for detention facilities services with the San 
Diego County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the Sheriff's Department had gotten an "unofficial look-see" at the 
brig and said it "looked good," Wigginton said. 
</P>
<P>
Wigginton, who had seen neither the report nor the brig, said officials need to 
tour and evaluate the 61-year-old Navy facility. Such a tour, however, will not 
occur until Secretary of the Navy H. Lawrence Garrett III decides whether t e 
Navy will loan the brig to the county. 
</P>
<P>
The report was based on an inspection conducted every three years by engineers 
and specialists. During the inspection, conducted over three days beginning 
Nov. 13, 1989, experts found many of the same discrepancies that had been 
detailed in a 1986 inspection. 
</P>
<P>
On a rating system of "A" through "D," the brig received a "D" in both 
inspections. 
</P>
<P>
"This rating means that serious inadequacies exist which preclude" the 
successful confinement and "affect the safety and health of staff and 
prisoners," according to the report. Fire hazards pointed out in earlier 
reports had not been corrected, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The fire and "life safety" discrepancies must be corrected by March, 1991, "or 
the authorized prisoner capacity of the Naval Brig, San Diego will be reduced 
to zero," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The items needing immediate attention included water leaks in the scullery 
garbage disposal area that posed potential electrocution hazards, the dearth of 
smoke detectors in the sick bay, as well as a dormitory, lounge and weight room 
area. 
</P>
<P>
The report goes on to list several hazards in a number of categories, including 
fire and safety, physical security, mechanical, electrical, environmental and 
industrial hygiene. 
</P>
<P>
The report also suggested the installation of fire-proof doors with steel 
frames, smoke seals around stairwells and a fire sprinkler in several areas. 
Other parts of the aging structure posed hazards for the inmates. The light 
fixtures and glass mirrors could be broken and used as weapons, the report 
said. The pipes, situated less than 12 feet above the floor, were dangerous 
because prisoners could hang themselves from them. Several areas also have 
confirmed asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate attached report, F.J. Dahn, head of the Fire Protection 
Engineering Branch of the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, was equally 
blunt about the run-down brig. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, this facility is considered to be in poor condition. This facility 
utilizes buildings which were never intended to be used as a detention 
facility," Dahn wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Brig officials say its problems are a result of old age. Safety standards have 
outpaced renovations and improvements, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than sink the funds into fixing the building, Naval Station Commanding 
Officer Prout said it made more sense to evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
"If something should happen to a prisoner, I would hate to have to explain to a 
sailor's parents or to a congressional committee why they were there when there 
was a modern facility up the road 11 miles (at Miramar)," Prout said. 
</P>
<P>
Prout said the Navy was able to keep the facility safe and secure because it 
had almost as many staff members as inmates. 
</P>
<P>
(In county facilities, the staff-prisoner ratio is much lower. At its worst, in 
the South Bay jail, there is one deputy for every 14 inmates. At the best, in 
El Cajon, there are five inmates for each deputy.) 
</P>
<P>
In the past 16 years, there have been no escapes from the older brig. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost impossible to escape from the cell block, unless a prisoner is a 
Houdini," said Cmdr. Jerry Rea, commanding officer of the brig. 
</P>
<P>
Rea and other brig officials are as proud of that record as they are of the 
well-maintained condition of the brig. Scrubbed down daily, the brig floors 
gleam. Inmates and guards have taken care of niceties such as wrapping rope 
around iron door handles or adding wood decorations to the walls. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like an old car. You got a lot of knocks and bangs, and you have to keep 
it up. If you don't, it quits," said Rea, who acknowledged that he is concerned 
whether the county would be able to keep pace with the almost constant repairs. 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, a precedent for the military loaning jail facilities. The 
armed forces have negotiated arrangements with jails in the past, said Glenn 
Flood, a Department of Defense spokesman. Federal prisoners, for instance, are 
housed at the Army's Ft. Leavenworth in Kansas and the Eglin Air Force Base in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
But some San Diego officials fear the price tag for renovating the brig may 
kill their plans to use it. County officials have not yet determined how long 
they would need the Navy's brig. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt we would invest that much money for using it for a short time," said 
County Supervisor George Bailey. "It depends what we would get out of it -- 
they are not giving it to us, even if we put a million bucks into it."

DEFEAT OF SCHOOL BOND MAY STALL CSUSM PLANS

SAN MARCOS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In one week, Cal State San Marcos moved a step closer to overcoming one 
obstacle to opening its new campus on time, only to ram headlong into another. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the university received notice that, after 10 weeks of construction 
delays, a new contractor had been found to resume work on the first phase of 
its campus, scheduled to open in August, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
But, even if the campus is able to make up the lost time -- which is doubtful 
-- the rejection of a $450-million higher-education construction bond by state 
voters Tuesday might leave the buildings unfurnished, and the opening delayed. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature already has approved $37 million to build the first phase of 
the campus, but the fledgling university was counting on $10 million from 
Proposition 143 for its furniture and library. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis McCune, chancellor of the 20-campus California State University system, 
said the San Marcos opening might have to be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat of Proposition 143 "may slow things down in San Marcos," McCune 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Because it is the newest state university established, Cal State San Marcos 
will be one of the first to feel the pinch. But McCune and University of 
California official William B. Baker said the failure of Proposition 143 will 
hurt universities statewide, deferring expansion of existing four-year state 
universities and community college campuses and delaying the opening of new 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the pessimistic outlook of state officials, Cal State San Marcos 
president Bill Stacy voiced hope Friday that he could get his campus open on 
time by going to the state Legislature for needed funds. 
</P>
<P>
"The campus construction continues, and we just need to begin the search for 
alternative funding," Stacy said. "There may be time between now and then to 
make a second pass at asking legislative leaders, the chancellor and the 
governor-elect on how we might finance it. 
</P>
<P>
"It is devastating if there are no alternative sources, but I am not resigned 
to saying that there aren't any." 
</P>
<P>
The bond measure would have given the university $2.4 million for the second 
half of the university's core library building and the books and materials to 
fill it, with the balance going toward carpeting and furnishing the first 
academic buildings and drawing up the plans for the second part of campus 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
The San Marcos campus had just begun to recover from a 10-week delay of campus 
construction with the announcement Friday that a new general contractor, 
Lusardi Construction, had been hired to replace financially plagued Louetto 
Construction. 
</P>
<P>
Construction, however, will not resume until either C. W. Poss, a grading 
subcontractor, has been paid the more than $1.5 million it is owed for work 
already done, or another grading subcontractor is hired, according to 
construction officials. 
</P>
<P>
The delays jeopardize the August, 1992 target date for the campus' opening and 
might set it back by a semester, although the campus also had hopes of making 
up the lost time. 
</P>
<P>
Lusardi officials said that they will be on site beginning next week, and that 
new estimates for cost and date of completion will be drawn up within the next 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"This is typical of a situation like this where a contractor enters a project 
midstream. It is necessary for us to acquaint ourselves with what has yet to be 
done," said Kenneth Lounsbery, vice president and general counsel of San 
Marcos-based Lusardi. 
</P>
<P>
At least construction on the San Marcos campus is going forward. Statewide 
university officials were wondering this week whether any other plans to build 
and expand state colleges and universities would be as lucky. 
</P>
<P>
Voter rejection of Proposition 143 means that students will be tightly squeezed 
into existing colleges and universities, and that planned new campuses probably 
will be delayed, officials of all three segments of California higher education 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"This puts a dark cloud over a year of planning and leaves many necessary 
projects in jeopardy," said Chancellor McCune of the California State 
University system. "It is a tragedy for higher education." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to delaying Cal State San Marcos, McCune said, plans for off-campus 
centers in Contra Costa and Ventura counties will be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
"We've just got to face up to the reality that we might not be able to grow," 
said Baker, vice president for budget and university relations at the 
University of California. 
</P>
<P>
UC plans considerable expansion at its Davis, Riverside, San Diego and Santa 
Cruz campuses, as well as a new San Joaquin Valley campus, but Baker said the 
failure of Proposition 143 "gives us cause for concern . . . that we're going 
to have enough revenue to even stay where we are," much less open a 10th 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
The higher education proposal was defeated by 51.3% to 48.7%, the first time a 
college and university bond issue has failed since 1968, when student protests 
were rocking many campuses. 
</P>
<P>
The measure won in only nine of California's 58 counties. "I was really 
surprised by that," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
It was defeated in every San Joaquin Valley county, even though UC is planning 
to open its first campus in that part of the state by the end of this decade. 
The proposition also lost heavily in Riverside County, where there has been a 
UC campus for many years. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, meeting at 
Hartnell College in Salinas Friday, established a Commission for Innovation to 
study new ways to provide instruction without building new facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The commission will study the possibility of offering community college courses 
through telecommunications to students at home and in the workplace, said Ann 
Reed, spokeswoman for the 107-campus two-year college system. 
</P>
<P>
"It can't be business as usual," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
Although higher education officials were generally dismayed by Tuesday's 
result, they saw a few silver linings among the clouds. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't think this was an anti-higher education vote," like 1968, said 
William L. Storey, an assistant director of the California Postsecondary 
Education Commission. "People were concerned about the economy and war in the 
Middle East. In times like these, people tend to be cautious about spending 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Others said voters were rebelling against the long ballot in general, 
especially the more than $5 billion in proposed bond measures, and not against 
California's public colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
"If this is just a one-year aberration, it's not too significant," UC's Baker 
said, "but if this turns out to be the beginning of a three-, four- or 
five-year dry well on capital spending, then we've got real trouble." 
</P>
<P>
If UC cannot expand on existing campuses, especially at Davis and Riverside, 
"that certainly will slow down plans for a 10th campus," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
The current timetable calls for the UC Board of Regents to narrow the choices 
for a new campus in the Fresno area to two or three sites next March and to 
make a final decision a year later. But Baker said the process might be 
delayed. 
</P>
<P>
CSU Chancellor McCune said the construction priority list will be adjusted to 
give preference to projects that increase student capacity, with many other 
projects dropping to the bottom of the list or falling off altogether. 
</P>
<P>
Coming on top of a $100-million cut in the CSU operating budget, these 
construction cuts make this "the worst year yet, and next year looks like it 
could be even worse," the chancellor added. 
</P>
<P>
The bond issue failure compounds a serious crowding problem at many community 
colleges throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
A study completed in September found that 28 new campus sites will be needed in 
the next 14 years to accommodate expected enrollment. If bond measures continue 
to fail, the money to build these facilities will not be there. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Serot, acting vice chancellor for business services in the Los Angeles 
Community College District, said Tuesday's vote cost the district $1 million to 
equip a new technical education building at Southwest College, another $1 
million to renovate the main academic building at Southwest and a third $1 
million for equipment in a new vocational education building at East Los 
Angeles College.

HOT TUNA; 
</P>
<P>
WARMER WATERS ARE LURING YELLOWTAIL AND SEA BASS CLOSER TO SHORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Off the Channel Islands, John Gonzalez of Malibu struggled for 30 minutes with 
a 45-pound beast his friends called "The Monster Yellowtail." 
</P>
<P>
After finally reeling in the large tuna with an ordinary 20-pound line, he 
posed proudly for photographers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of my biggest yellowtail ever," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez is among hundreds of commercial and sports fishermen in Ventura County 
who are taking advantage of warmer-than-normal ocean temperatures that attract 
large warm-water yellowtail tuna and white sea bass to the area. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are unsure why ocean temperatures have increased 5 to 10 degrees 
during the past year, but they are certain that the warmer waters mean big 
business for fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
Fishermen say Gonzalez's trophy is unusual not only because of its size but 
also because yellowtail tuna are usually not seen off the coast at this time of 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people are lucky to catch one in a lifetime," said Jim Launius, captain 
of a sports fishing boat at the Channel Islands Marina. 
</P>
<P>
The change in water temperature also was noted by windsurfers at Surfer's Point 
in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty warm for this time of year," Tim Koester of Ventura said as he 
stashed his surfboard in his car. 
</P>
<P>
Although most surfers continue to wear wet suits, some have abandoned the 
heavy-duty, full-body suit customary in November. 
</P>
<P>
"My heavy suit is in the trunk," Chang Liampetchakul said as he put on a 
short-sleeved model. 
</P>
<P>
Fishermen, surfers and marine biologists are intrigued and delighted by the 
warmer ocean temperatures, which usually range in the low- to mid-50s in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
Because there is little data or research on ocean temperatures and underwater 
currents, the explanation of the unusual temperatures varies according to whom 
is asked about it. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Richards, a marine biologist at Channel Islands National Park, believes 
that a shift in wind patterns may be the cause. 
</P>
<P>
He suggests that the Southern California coast has experienced a slackening of 
strong winds, which normally blow across the ocean and churn the deeper, colder 
waters. Without the winds, he said, the upper layer of ocean water becomes 
tepid. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like last winter the wind was mild," he said. 
</P>
<P>
David Siegel, a physical oceanographer at UC Santa Barbara, said the wind 
explanation might be valid. But then again, the warmer temperatures could be 
caused by unusual ocean currents or a complicated combination of warm and cold 
air pressures off the coast. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an infant science," Siegel said. "What is happening today? Who knows." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Lusk, a wholesale commercial fishermen at the Ventura harbor, doesn't really 
care. Lusk is too busy keeping an eye on an increase in the shrimp population. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not bigger, we are just seeing more juvenile shrimp, which is a good 
sign for business for years to come," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that warmer waters are forcing a cold-water fish that preys 
on shrimp to migrate out of the area. 
</P>
<P>
"That means that a lot more of the baby shrimp survive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Launius, who has been a captain of a sport fishing boat for 13 years, said the 
abundance of fish caught most fishermen by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent tour, Launius said he was forced to return to dock early because 
all his customers caught their limit of three fish in a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the yellowtail tuna his customers reeled in where between 25 and 30 
pounds, he said.

STATE BLOCKS CLEARING OF FLOOD CONTROL CHANNELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Enforcing an obscure law locally for the first time, a state wildlife agency 
has prohibited county maintenance workers from removing trash and weeds from 
hundreds of county flood control channels since June, increasing the danger of 
fires and floods, county officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's serious business. Our maintenance people can't do their work because 
they're afraid they're going to be arrested," county Public Works Director 
Arthur E. Goulet said. "This is bureaucracy run amok." 
</P>
<P>
In blocking the maintenance work, the state Department of Fish and Game has 
said that even routine county trash and weed removal from the channels, which 
are considered state waterways, is illegal without a special agreement with the 
wildlife agency. 
</P>
<P>
"If flood control would abide by the law and abide by it in a timely fashion, 
there would be no problem," said Lt. Chris Long, chief Fish and Game warden in 
Ventura County. "If they had been following the law, they wouldn't be in the 
situation they're in now." 
</P>
<P>
Goulet said the county has tried to reach an agreement that would allow workers 
to clean channels without seeking state permission first, which is the way the 
flood control district has operated for decades. 
</P>
<P>
But after months of wrangling, including a confrontation in which a state game 
warden threatened four county workers with arrest, flood control channels are 
fouled with litter, underbrush and stagnant water, Goulet said. And the county 
Fire Department notified the state last week that the clutter is a fire hazard 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
Goulet said months of state foot-dragging has blocked an agreement that would 
allow the county to clean the channels well before this winter's rains. 
</P>
<P>
Goulet said he was told recently by a state official that the wildlife agency 
did not have time to retype the latest version of its proposed agreement to 
include changes favored by the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We sent out a letter today telling them that if they don't want to type it, we 
will," Goulet said. "It's on a word processor, for crying out loud." 
</P>
<P>
If not resolved soon, the issue will be placed before an arbitrator for a 
decision on what conditions are reasonable in the agreement, Goulet said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Linda Groberg, who is familiar with the case, said state law 
is on the side of Fish and Game. An agreement between the state and the county 
is required to prescribe how routine maintenance is carried out, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Long said the issue came to a head June 27 when a game warden saw county 
workers dumping trash on an access road next to a flood control channel. 
</P>
<P>
"A warden observed a flood control vehicle hauling a bunch of trash -- cans and 
bottles, containers, shopping carts . . . and illegally dumping them," Long 
said. 
</P>
<P>
State law prohibits the dumping of debris within 150 feet of a state waterway, 
a concrete-lined channel in this case. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said the workers had pulled the trash and weeds from the 
channel and -- as is their usual practice -- spread the debris across a county 
access road to dry. Landfills won't accept wet trash, Goulet said. 
</P>
<P>
The warden told the workers that they would be arrested if they spread debris 
on roads again, and the incident prompted the state to press the county for an 
agreement on how it would conduct channel maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
"We had been discussing some issues with flood control prior to that," said 
Long, who took charge of the Ventura warden unit last December. "Like, 'Why 
won't you folks follow the law?' It's not just maintenance." 
</P>
<P>
The lack of progress toward an agreement endangers the public, said Mike 
Taylor, engineer in charge of maintenance at the flood control district. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, all 150 to 200 channels under county control are cleared of weeds and 
debris by now, so runoff from winter rains will flow smoothly to the ocean, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"But this year we've done nothing since June 27," Taylor said. "In several 
areas it is dangerous. We have debris and vegetation and other stuff where it 
could cause local flooding if we had a big rain." 
</P>
<P>
The danger of fire is also higher because of the stalemate, county Deputy Fire 
Chief Robert F. Holaway warned the state wildlife agency last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Sections of flood-control channels . . . pose a fire hazard due to the 
existence of combustible growth within the channel," Holaway said in a letter 
to Fish and Game Regional Director Fred Worthley.

<P>
In the letter, he asked that the flood control district be allowed to clear the 
channels immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Long said that if the county considers the situations hazardous, state law 
allows it to declare an emergency and to remove the hazards. But the county 
would be subject to penalties if the state disagreed that an emergency existed, 
he said.

ATTORNEY'S PLAN TO ALTER STREET NAME RESISTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To attorney Peter A. Goldenring, his request to the city seems reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
But to his neighbors, what this newly arrived lawyer wants is pompous, 
ridiculous or downright outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Goldenring moved his offices to 3rd Street in Ventura about 1 1/2 
years ago, much of his mail has been delivered to better-known 3rd streets in 
Oxnard, Fillmore and Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
Goldenring said few people know the relatively obscure 3rd Street in Ventura -- 
a two-block-long strip just off Victoria Avenue with only four mailing 
addresses. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid further mail delays that have caused him to miss court deadlines, the 
attorney has asked the city to change the street's name to the more 
distinctive, slightly adventurous Nighthawk Street. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed name is appropriate, city officials said, because most of the 
streets just east of 3rd are named after birds. What's more, Ventura doesn't 
have a 2nd Street or a 4th Street, so why should it have a 3rd? 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Planning Commission will decide whether to grant the name 
change. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Goldenring's neighbors oppose the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"Seems quite fancy to me for a short industrial street," said Wayne Sampson, 
manager of Cal-U-Rent Inc. construction rentals, whose yard faces 3rd Street. 
</P>
<P>
"If they change the name to Nighthawk, people looking for 3rd Street aren't 
going to find it," said Robert McCall, who just moved into 3rd Street's only 
house. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a 3-year-old girl and a 5-year-old boy," he said Friday as he unloaded 
furniture from his pickup truck. "For the kids, it's easier to remember 3rd 
Street if they get lost . . . Besides, I like 3rd Street." 
</P>
<P>
But nobody is as outraged by the proposal as Myra Jane Morton of Myra Jane's 
Preschool, which is at 3rd and Grand Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got that letter my hair stood straight up," she said, referring to the 
city's notification about the proposal. "I've been here 11 years and now they 
want to change my street!" 
</P>
<P>
Morton, who plans to fight the name change at Tuesday's meeting, said she was 
not surprised to learn that Nighthawk Street was Goldenring's idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it had to be them lawyers," she said. "They come in here and want to 
change the neighborhood. But they're the new kids in the block, and they're 
going to have to wise up." 
</P>
<P>
At first, Goldenring said, he wanted Calle de Oro, which means "Street of Gold" 
in Spanish, because it fit nicely with his last name. But city officials told 
him that only bird names would do. 
</P>
<P>
Goldenring then came up with Golden Eagle, only to learn that it was already 
taken -- as were most of the more common bird names. "Nighthawk" was suggested 
by the attorney's wife and mother-in-law. "I wanted a name that was fun, and I 
didn't have to spell over the phone a lot," Goldenring said. 
</P>
<P>
Goldenring, who had not contacted his neighbors about the street name change, 
could hardly believe that his proposal was causing such a ruckus. 
</P>
<P>
"What, are they attached to the name 3rd Street?" he said. "Does it give them a 
sense of pride? 
</P>
<P>
"I bet they won't go to the Planning Commission meeting," he said. "After I 
visit them, they'll shut up and they won't make trouble."

LITTLE-KNOWN FRUIT MAY SOW DOLLARS FOR GROWERS; 
</P>
<P>
AGRICULTURE: THE TOTAL CROP VALUE OF THE CHERIMOYA, WHICH REMINDS SOME PEOPLE 
OF PINEAPPLE OR BANANA, MIGHT APPROACH $350,000 IN VENTURA COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The cherimoya, a little-known fruit that looks like a green grapefruit and 
tastes like ice cream, is opening doors to the lucrative specialty fruit market 
for Ventura County growers. 
</P>
<P>
The fruit provides a good return, with an average 12-ounce piece selling for $3 
to $5 in local markets and three to four times that in Japan. A very large, 
three-pound fruit -- about the size of a large cantaloupe -- can sell in Japan 
for $45. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the aristocrat of fruit," said Beth Hillard, who sells the fruit for the 
state's largest shipper, California Tropics of Carpinteria. 
</P>
<P>
But cherimoya trees, which grow on about 25 acres in Ventura County, come with 
their own head aches, said Rob Brokaw, a Saticoy nurseryman who grows cherimoya 
trees for sale to growers. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to make jokes about the cherimoya having a confused sex life," he 
said. The trees produce yellow blossoms that start out as female flowers but 
turn into male flowers a day later, requiring growers to hand-pollinate their 
trees between May and August. 
</P>
<P>
"So we collect pollen from the male flowers. Then we fill up a squeeze bulb 
with the pollen and find a fresh female flower and blow pollen right onto the 
pistils." 
</P>
<P>
Although it has a number of large black seeds, the cherimoya rewards the palate 
with a creamy custard center that offers the hint of a citrus tang. Some say it 
reminds them of a pineapple or banana. It is high in calcium but low in fat, 
and every bit as filling as a rich dessert. 
</P>
<P>
"It was first presented to me as an ice-cream fruit when I was about 8 or 10 
years old," said Brokaw, an officer of the 89-member California Cherimoya Assn. 
</P>
<P>
This week, about 15 growers in Ventura County and a larger contingent in Santa 
Barbara County began picking the first of the ripening fruit. The picking 
season lasts through December, when the richest and sweetest fruit are 
harvested. 
</P>
<P>
Brokaw estimates the total crop value in Ventura County might approach 
$350,000, with the figure increasing as growers expand the size of their 
orchards and new growers plant cherimoya trees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some growers, most of whom have orchards of two acres or less, will ship their 
fruit or sell it at farmers' markets and roadside stands. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the Ventura County growers send their fruit to California Tropics, 
which ships more than 1 million pounds of cherimoya every year, co-owner 
Anthony Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The delicate fruit is difficult to grow because it is very susceptible to 
damage from cold snaps. "It's a crop of devotion and heartbreak," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Its inedible green skin is smooth but patterned like a hand grenade, said 
Bradley Miles, who grows the fruit on two acres along California 150 in the 
county's northwest end. 
</P>
<P>
"I take some every year to this old Dutchman who's a machinist in Santa 
Barbara," Miles said. "He asked me, 'Where's the pin? This looks like a hand 
grenade.' " 
</P>
<P>
Cherimoyas are ripe when the fruit is soft, like an avocado. It is best chilled 
and served as is, or mixed into a daiquiri or parfait, the growers say. 
</P>
<P>
A native to the slopes of the Andes Mountains in South America, the cherimoya 
was introduced to California in the 1800s and has been grown commercially in 
Ventura County for about 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The world's largest production centers are in Carpinteria, Spain and Chile. But 
Spanish and Chilean growers have no need to pollinate, since either atmospheric 
humidity or a beetle -- depending on which theory you accept -- enables the 
trees to self-pollinate in those countries. 
</P>
<P>
The cherimoya's toughest hurdle in the United States is not pollination but a 
lack of recognition, said California Tropics saleswoman Hillard. Only about one 
of every 10 people knows about cherimoyas, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want it to become more and more commonplace," she said.

RODENTS THRIVE IN COLLEGE RAT RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Some colleges have bed races. Some have kissing marathons. At Moorpark College, 
it's the Rat Review. 
</P>
<P>
For several years, the college's Exotic Animal Training and Management Program 
has staged a Rat Review in the spring, featuring student-trained rodents that 
climb, jump, slide and go through tunnels and mazes. 
</P>
<P>
Ten members of the animal behavior class entered their pet rodents Friday in 
the first Fall Rat Review. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 rats took part. They're the ones that made the cut of those entered in 
the first round of the review by 40 students, class member Bill Wolden said. 
</P>
<P>
Wolden was pleased with the performance of his two rats, Calvin and Hobbes. 
They climbed through a three-story house built by Wolden, came out onto a 
balcony, walked across a wire and slid down a flagpole into a toy truck, Wolden 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another class member, Julie Sheridan, entered Monkey-See and Monkey-Do. Each 
attempted to make its way through a maze at separate times. 
</P>
<P>
"They have distinctly different personalities," Sheridan said. "One of them, 
Monkey-See, can run through the maze quickly. But she's so well trained that 
she'll pause on command." 
</P>
<P>
Monkey-Do, also a female, is more independent. "She's more of a free-thinker," 
Sheridan said. "She likes to set her own pace." 
</P>
<P>
The rats have been in training for six weeks, college spokesman Gerry Olsen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 people attended the public event in the college's Music Building. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, class members who are not also enrolled in the animal 
training and management program were allowed to enter their rodents. 
</P>
<P>
"It's turned out to be a lot of fun -- a real crowd-pleaser," Olsen said. JACK

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CARTY, EX-SUPERVISOR AND EX-MAYOR, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Edwin Carty, former Ventura County supervisor and Oxnard mayor, died Thursday 
after a heart attack. He was 92. 
</P>
<P>
Born Dec. 4, 1897, in Santa Barbara, Carty moved to Ventura County in 1909. 
</P>
<P>
He was a resident of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Carty held more than a dozen offices, said his daughter, Patricia Loucks of 
Camarillo. He was mayor of Oxnard from 1942 to 1950, and a county supervisor 
from 1952 to 1965, serving as board chairman twice. He was appointed to the 
state Fish and Game Commission three times between 1939 and 1950. 
</P>
<P>
Carty also was the director of the California Duckhunters Assn., and several 
other sporting groups. He was active with the Boys Club. 
</P>
<P>
He narrowly lost the Democratic nomination to Congress in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
Carty is survived by his daughter and three sons, Douglas Carty of Oxnard, 
Roderick Carty of Ventura and Robert Carty of Santa Barbara, eight 
grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Carty was healthy and active right up until Thursday morning, when he was taken 
to St. John's Medical Center in Oxnard, Loucks said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very meticulous," Loucks said. "He got up every morning and put on a 
suit and tie. He was a fighter." 
</P>
<P>
A visitation will be held from 2 to 7 p.m. Monday at James A. Reardon Mortuary 
in Oxnard. A Mass will be said 10:45 a.m. Tuesday at Santa Clara Church in 
Oxnard, with burial following at Ivy Lawn Memorial Park in Ventura.

A Southern California Gas Co. supervisor has received a commendation from 
Ventura Mayor Richard Francis for his role in apprehending a suspected child 
molester he identified from the television show "America's Most Wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Mario de los Cobos, a district manager for Ventura County, said he first 
encountered Donald Ray Moore on Dec. 29 while responding to an accident in the 
Ventura River bottom, where a community of homeless people live. 
</P>
<P>
"He just stood out from the rest," de los Cobos said. 
</P>
<P>
Six months later, de los Cobos said, he recognized Moore on the television show 
and contacted police. Moore was arrested July 5, and his trial is expected to 
start this week, Francis said. 
</P>
<P>
De los Cobos credited his son Egan, 9, with assisting in the capture of the 
suspect. "He made me watch the show," de los Cobos said. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, 56, was wanted on 21 felony counts of child molestation. He had been 
hiding out in the riverbed for almost a year before his arrest. SANTIAGO

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL BOARD POSTPONES DECISION ON SPRING 
SPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified school board members have postponed a decision 
on whether to cancel competitive spring sports at the district's three high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Board members, searching for ways to shore up a shrinking budget reserve, told 
the district's staff this week to meet with boosters to see if they could raise 
$23,000 to help defray the costs of the sports. 
</P>
<P>
But, the board said, even if the money is raised it still may cancel the sports 
if the district experiences any major revenue declines in coming weeks. The 
board is scheduled to vote on the matter in early December. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility that spring sports could be cut arose after board members 
requested further cuts in the district's $33-million budget to boost a 
projected 1.6% reserve, which board members consider insufficient. Cutting 
sports would save an estimated $85,000, enough to increase the reserve to 2%.

VISTA IS ONE OF THE FIRST SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN STATE TO GET NEW, LESS-POLLUTING 
BUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several old smoke-belching buses will be retired from the Vista Unified School 
District, one of the first districts in the state set to receive buses run on 
compressed natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
A prototype bus was on display Friday, giving officials a glimpse of the 
California Energy Commission's $60-million effort to spread 163 clean-burning 
buses among 14 school districts throughout the state early next year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased that the process of converting California's school 
transportation fleet to cleaner fuels can begin right here in Vista," said B.B. 
Blevins, representing the commission. 
</P>
<P>
The district serves 18,500 kindergarten through 12th-grade students from Vista 
and parts of Oceanside and San Marcos. Vista will get three natural gas buses, 
not a big part of its 30-bus fleet, but enough to save nearly 6,000 gallons of 
gasoline a year. 
</P>
<P>
"What we start here today is only a first step in what we must do to make 
tomorrow's environment better," Supt. Rene Townsend said. 
</P>
<P>
Under state legislation, the commission is buying the buses with funds 
earmarked from the federal government from fines paid by oil companies that 
overcharged customers in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The 163 buses the commission initially provides will include models run on 
compressed natural gas, diesel or methanol fuels. A second, $40-million phase 
of the commission's program will put another 300 clean-fuel buses in school 
districts later in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"They are significantly cleaner burning," said commission spokeswoman Claudia 
Barker, adding the buses cost about $100,000 each -- "not that much more than a 
normal bus." 
</P>
<P>
Vista will use its new compressed natural gas buses to retire three 
gasoline-powered buses that have been in service since before 1977. 
</P>
<P>
District spokeswoman Vickie Corea said some district bus drivers came to 
examine the prototype bus on display at the school district's headquarters in 
Vista Friday. "They're thrilled, they couldn't wait to drive the bus and take 
rides," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Barker said Vista participated in a "very competitive process" to win the 
buses. The district had to be committed to cleaner air, be willing to replace 
the older buses, and be able to service the natural gas vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. will help build a refueling station and supply 
natural gas for the buses. The utility is working with manufactures in 
developing compressed natural gas vehicles and providing public refueling 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
Both SDG&amp;E and the district are paying for the refueling station and the 
district will maintain the vehicles.

EX-SALESMAN SUES FIRM OVER FIRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former concrete pipe salesman has filed a $26-million lawsuit against a 
Fillmore manufacturer, alleging he was fired because he revealed that the 
company sold defective drainage pipes to county and federal governments. 
</P>
<P>
Willard Dobrzensky of Ventura filed the suit Wednesday in Ventura County 
Superior Court against Hurst Concrete Products, which he said fired him Feb. 28 
after employing him for four years. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst General Manager Al Franzen said Friday, "We do not produce substandard 
material." 
</P>
<P>
Franzen declined to comment on the suit because he has not seen it and said he 
prefers that the company make its case in court. But he confirmed that 
Dobrzensky no longer works at Hurst. 
</P>
<P>
Franzen said Hurst has been supplying pipe and concrete products to the 
counties of Ventura, Los Angeles, Orange and San Luis Obispo, and the U.S. 
government since the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
Dobrzensky's suit charges that he learned Hurst had been selling substandard 
and potentially dangerous concrete pipes and vaults to those customers. The 
suit does not specify how the pipes are substandard nor where or when they were 
installed. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that Franzen and Hurst administrator Tim Wayment harassed 
Dobrzensky in an effort to make him quit after he told them that he planned to 
inform customers that the concrete products were substandard. 
</P>
<P>
Dobrzensky's suit also alleges that Hurst then fired him without cause, 
breaching an oral contract he said it made upon hiring him in July, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that Dobrzensky suffered from attacks of anxiety, nervousness, 
insomnia, high blood pressure and stress from being harassed. 
</P>
<P>
Dobrzensky and his lawyer, William O'Neill III, could not be reached Friday for 
comment. MACK REED

LAND ACTION ON NEW JAIL MAY START SOON

<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County officials may begin proceedings next month to condemn 157 acres 
near Santa Paula for a new jail, although the issue of contaminated soil on the 
property is unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
The property is valued at $2.6 million, according to an appraisal prepared for 
the county by Ventura Appraisal. But it may cost an estimated $500,000 to 
finish cleaning up soil contamination caused by leaking gasoline and oil tanks, 
said Arthur Goulet, county director of public works. 
</P>
<P>
The county has offered $2.6 million which was rejected by landowners Michael R. 
and Nancy A. Brucker. The two sides will continue to negotiate, Goulet said. 
</P>
<P>
"The contamination is the real touchy part," he said. "It complicates the 
transaction."

Last July the Board of Supervisors picked the site at California 126 and Todd 
Road for a new jail from among five spots. On Tuesday the supervisors are 
expected to schedule a public hearing Dec. 4 to authorize the condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the jail is expected to be constructed in about three years. 
It will cover 15 acres and house 752 inmates. The cost is estimated at $51 
million, with state funding covering $31 million and rest coming from county 
funds. Ultimately, the entire complex will house 2,306 inmates and cover 40 to 
45 acres. 
</P>
<P>
The site is now a lemon orchard. At one time four aboveground oil tanks on the 
property stored fuel to operate 2,000 smudge pots. In addition, about 15 
underground gasoline tanks were located there to fuel wind machines, which are 
used to help regulate temperatures in the orchard. 
</P>
<P>
All the tanks have been removed and the cleanup has been going on the last 
three years, said Ted England, attorney for the Bruckers who bought the 
property a little more than a year ago. The soil has been detoxified mainly by 
stockpiling it and letting it air out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The cleanup has cost more than $1 million, England said, and the remaining work 
will cost less than $500,000. He said "there is a substantial difference" 
between the county's offer and the Bruckers' selling price, which he didn't 
disclose. JANE HULSE

TOP FUND-RAISERS GO TO SCHOOL IN STYLE

<P>
The trip to school Friday was a smooth ride for a dozen students at Loma Vista 
Elementary School, who were picked up in limousines and dropped off at the 
Ventura school as a reward for their PTA fund-raising efforts. 
</P>
<P>
As the Ventura High School band played and their classmates cheered, the 12 
students -- top fund-raisers in a school-wide campaign that raised more than 
$12,000 -- arrived with their chaperons, Principal Diane Peterson and Supt. 
</P>
<P>
Cesare Caldarelli of the Ventura Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
The annual fund-raising drive took place in October in the form of a 
jog-a-thon. Students, who had received pledges from relatives and local 
businesses in advance, ran up to 20 laps around a course in exchange for 
varying amounts of money for each lap completed, Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
PTA member Jennifer Mitchell said the previous record for Loma Vista's 
fund-raising efforts was $7,000. 
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to pay for PTA-sponsored activities and school 
equipment, including field trips, visual arts performances and computer 
software, Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the limousine rides, dozens of other prizes were awarded, 
including bumper stickers, boogie boards, an aquarium, cassette tapes, a camera 
and a bicycle, Mitchell said. The fifth-grade class that raised the most money 
also received a pizza party in the classroom Friday, she said. ADRIANNE GOODMAN

An accused Cuban spy remained in federal custody Friday after U.S. authorities 
obtained an order blocking his release, contending that he is a risk to 
national security. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Manuel Rodriguez Camejo, who is seeking political asylum in the United 
States, was being held without bond at Metropolitan Correctional Center in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, 40, a former Cuban intelligence agent who entered the United States 
clandestinely last month from Tijuana, along with his wife and 6-year-old 
daughter, says he has reformed and wants to defect to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities have charged that Rodriguez remains a Cuban intelligence 
operative and seeks U.S. residence as a cover for his spying activities. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a federal immigration judge ordered Rodriguez freed on $7,500 
bond, rejecting the government's allegation that he poses a threat to national 
security. But Rodriguez remained imprisoned, as U.S. authorities won a stay of 
that order Friday from the Board of Immigration Appeals in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rodriguez has requested that U.S. District Judge Lawrence J. Irving 
set bail to allow him to be free while his case for political asylum is 
adjudicated, a process that could last for more than a year. The judge is 
considering the petition. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez's wife and daughter are already free from INS detention on $2,000 
bonds. They are staying with relatives in Beverly Hills.

A Nicaraguan man and an Ecuadorean man were indicted Friday in federal court in 
San Diego on one felony charge each of possessing about 15 tons of cocaine at 
sea, federal prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan, Horacio Velarde-Gavarrette, 47, and the Ecuadorean, Bolivar 
Wilson Guerrero-Mosqueda, 42, were each charged with possessing the cocaine on 
a ship with intent to distribute, Assistant U.S. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the indictment, a Coast Guard crew aboard the Navy cruiser 
Arkansas requested -- and was granted -- permission on Sept. 11 to come aboard 
a Honduran-flagged merchant ship, the Nordcapp, about 400 miles south of 
Acapulco. Both ships were on the high seas. 
</P>
<P>
Upon boarding, Velarde-Gavarrete told the Coast Guard crew that the Nordcapp 
was on fire. Shortly after rescuing all members of the Nordcapp crew, the ship 
sank, the indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, according to the indictment, U.S. agents learned the ship was scuttled 
because it was carrying 13,636 kilograms -- about 15 tons -- of Colombian 
cocaine. The indictment alleges that the cocaine was to have been loaded into 
smaller boats and smuggled into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which put the wholesale 
value of the cocaine at $20,000 per kilogram, said it was worth about $273 
million at that price. 
</P>
<P>
Both men are being held without bail pending a hearing Nov. 16, Smith said. If 
convicted, each could be sentenced to life in prison and receive a $4-million 
fine, he said.

A 62-year-old El Cajon woman charged with trying to kill her husband by 
stabbing him with a butcher knife has pleaded guilty to assault with a deadly 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Beulah Stevens faces a maximum sentence of four years in state prison and a 
$10,000 fine.

She had been charged with committing premeditated attempted murder, which 
carries a life sentence, but that count was dropped Thursday when she entered 
her guilty plea to assault.

A sewage spill Friday closed a small part of Mission Bay, county health 
authorities reported. 
</P>
<P>
The spill occurred at about 8:30 a.m. when grease in a line caused sewage to 
flow from a manhole in the 3200 block of Bayside Lane. The sewage then traveled 
into a storm drain at Ventura Place and Bayside Walk and emptied into Santa 
Barbara Cove. 
</P>
<P>
County health officials estimated that about 2,400 gallons of sewage reached 
the bay before the spill was stopped at 10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Warning signs were posted on the beach 100 feet in both directions from the 
drain pipe. The signs will remain until the water is again safe for 
recreational use.

PHIL NORMAN; RADIO, TELEVISION PERSONALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phil Norman, a longtime radio and television personality, has died at his 
Tarzana home. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
Norman died Wednesday of heart failure, said his wife, Helen Norman. 
</P>
<P>
Born Feb. 10, 1911, in Columbus, Ohio, Norman worked for radio stations in Ohio 
before going to McCann-Erickson Advertising Agency in New York, where he became 
associate producer of the New York Philharmonic and Arturo Toscanini concerts. 
</P>

show during the day and the Phil Norman Show at night for about 12 years on 
KNX-AM radio. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, he did a daytime radio show on KBIG radio and in the 
mid-1960s, he did an interview show on KTTV-TV. Norman later appeared weekly on 
an ABC-TV network early morning show as a food raconteur, before his retirement 
from the entertainment field in the early 1970s. In his retirement years, he 
worked in advertising, merchandising and promotion of the food industry. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife of 25 years, and daughter Stephanie Norman of North 
Hollywood.

SAN DIEGO PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
JUDGE CAN'T BE A JURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The curious choice of Judge William L. Todd Jr. to preside over the next 
hearing in Roger Hedgecock's drawn-out legal battle is unfair to the former 
mayor. What's more, the choice promises to cause more wrangling and possibly 
delay in this seemingly endless affair. 
</P>
<P>
Todd's own conduct and the behavior of his former bailiff are central issues in 
the hearing ordered by the state Supreme Court to determine whether Hedgecock 
deserves a new trial. The hearing was ordered after Hedgecock's attorneys 
alleged that the bailiff tampered with the jury in the former mayor's second 
trial, and was in regular communication with Todd. 
</P>
<P>
Even the most impartial jurist should not be put in the position of having to 
review, and possibly condemn, his own conduct. Moreover, Todd, who handled 
Hedgecock's first and second trials, has publicly stated his belief in 
Hedgecock's guilt on perjury and conspiracy charges. The Supreme Court this 
year threw out the 12 perjury convictions and ordered the upcoming hearing on 
the conspiracy count. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing all this, we are surprised that San Diego Superior Court Judge Judith 
McConnell assigned the case to Todd, and that Todd accepted. Hedgecock's 
attorney, Charles Sevilla, has warned that he will appeal the choice if 
McConnell doesn't change her mind. Ironically, Todd now sits on the Appeal 
Court that would hear Sevilla's complaint. 
</P>
<P>
That won't be necessary if McConnell chooses a new judge for the Nov. 21 
hearing, or Todd withdraws, actions that appear appropriate.

An estimated 250 to 300 people -- including judges, jurors, prisoners and 
attorneys -- were evacuated from the Van Nuys Courthouse shortly before noon 
Friday after a strong gas odor was detected on the building's top two floors. 
No gas leak was found, and the cause remained under investigation. Those 
evacuated were allowed to return to the building by 2:20 p.m., Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Sgt. Herman Trevizo said.

ON CAMPUS : ANTELOPE VALLEY COLLEGE; 
</P>
<P>
CENTER MAY LEAD TO 4-YEAR SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
College students in the high desert appear to have an unquenchable thirst for 
education. And drinking from the fountain of knowledge promises to be easier 
with the creation of a California State University education center on the 
campus of Antelope Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
The center, consisting initially of a two-classroom relocatable building, will 
offer CSU campuses a place to hold classes and test for potential enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, plans call for a more permanent facility at the two-year college. 
Funding is expected to come from $25,000 that Palmdale and Lancaster provided 
to the Antelope Valley Board of Trade to attract a four-year college. 
</P>
<P>
The desire to attract a four-year campus to the Antelope Valley has been 
particularly frustrating, especially when the CSU system picked Fresno as the 
next university site earlier this year. But the relocatable education center 
could accomplish proponents' objective by showing university officials that 
demand is greater than expected. 
</P>
<P>
"And what I'm hearing now is yes, they are real pleased with the kind of 
response they are getting," said Rae Yoshida, Antelope Valley College's 
president of academic affairs. "This gives them two years to decide, since 
that's the shelf life of a relocatable classroom. 
</P>
<P>
"So maybe by '92-93, Cal State could start the ball rolling to put some kind of 
mobile unit on campus that would be more permanent than the temporary 
classrooms. It just takes people with a little vision." 
</P>
<P>
The temporary classrooms are already used by Cal State Los Angeles. And Cal 
State Bakersfield and Cal State Northridge are expected to follow after 
renovation and remodeling are completed this semester. 
</P>
<P>
"We're asking CSUN to wire the relocatable unit so we can catch the signal out 
of Northridge's interactive television facilities," Yoshida said. 
</P>
<P>
Students would watch classes conducted at CSUN or at another location and ask 
instructors questions through a telephone hookup. 
</P>
<P>
And the demand for higher-education classes closer to home is expected to 
continue growing, Yoshida said. Antelope Valley College, which now has 9,800 
students, is expected to have 18,000 within 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The state university classes are also seen as an economic development activity.

HOMELESS REFUGE MAY LOSE ITS SAN PEDRO HOME; 
</P>
<P>
SHELTER: THE CROSSING MISSION HAS BEEN TOLD IT HAS TO MOVE BECAUSE STRUCTURE IS 
SEISMICALLY UNSAFE. OFFICIALS SAY THEY NEED MORE TIME OR MAY HAVE TO CLOSE FOR 
GOOD.

Jimmy Lloyd swears he'd still be on the streets if it weren't for The Crossing. 
Ed Baca figures it gave him a second chance when he was down and nearly out. 
And Ronald Pace says the Christian mission in downtown San Pedro has turned his 
life around, both physically and spiritually. 
</P>
<P>
For four years, The Crossing has been a sort of temporary refuge for the 
homeless in San Pedro. A place that served up hot meals and hope. Four nights a 
week and Saturday mornings its doors were opened to the needy. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the doors may be closed. And no one knows for how long. 
</P>
<P>
The only tenant of a 1923 brick building at 7th and Centre streets, The 
Crossing has been told that it must move because the two-story structure has 
been judged seismically unsafe by Los Angeles' Building and Safety Department 
inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
"From an earthquake standpoint, it's one of the worst buildings in San Pedro," 
said Jim Gatlin, a city building inspector. 
</P>
<P>
The building's owner, Mercy Ships Ministries, has known of the building's 
problems since 1986, when city officials first ordered earthquake repairs. But 
a spokesman for the Texas-based Christian foundation says Mercy Ships did not 
have the estimated $100,000 needed to complete the repairs and, after some 
initial work last year, postponed further improvements because the building was 
put up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, city officials say they can no longer wait for the building to be 
made safe. A Nov. 19 hearing is scheduled at City Hall to discuss possible 
criminal penalties against Mercy Ships if the building is not repaired or 
closed. And Mercy Ships, awaiting sale of the property, has opted to board it 
up, forcing The Crossing to close, possibly as early as this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"We need some help," said Harlan Heyer, The Crossing's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Since learning of the hearing last week, Heyer said, he and other volunteers 
with the agency have been hoping to win more time for relocating. "If we had 
one hope, it would be that the city would allow us to stay here a few more 
weeks," Heyer said. 
</P>
<P>
The extra time, he said, would allow The Crossing not only to search for a new 
location but resume negotiations to buy the building from Mercy Ships, which 
has seen previous sales of the property fall out of escrow. "We'd like to stay 
here and think there's room to talk," said Heyer, whose agency has never been 
charged rent by Mercy Ships. 
</P>
<P>
But Mercy Ships official Richard Mackey says that the property has finally been 
sold and the buyer will close escrow next month. He declined to identify the 
buyer or say whether the new owner might allow The Crossing to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very interested in the ministry of The Crossing. It would be my desire 
to see them continue," Mackey said. "But it is not my place to talk about what 
the new owner will or will not be doing with the building." 
</P>
<P>
Even if The Crossing were allowed to remain as a tenant, however, the building 
remains unsafe until it is repaired, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't like to vacate a building, especially one that provides a public 
help," building inspector Gatlin said. "But what do we do when a building is 
unsafe and the owner is either unwilling or unable to do the work?" 
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Padilla, another city inspector, said he would be inclined to give The 
Crossing additional time to relocate as long as there were assurances that the 
building would finally be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could help them (The Crossing) get another week or two, I would say, 
'Yeah. OK.' But it is an unsafe building." 
</P>
<P>
Though Heyer and other volunteers at The Crossing understand the city's 
position, they are still hoping that this weekend's closure will only be 
temporary. That somehow they'll reopen again next week or soon after to resume 
serving the community's homeless. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, they say, they will ask the city at the Nov. 19 hearing for 
permission to temporarily reopen The Crossing until a new site is found. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any beef with anyone," said Mark Granich, treasurer of the 
nonprofit agency. "We just want to present our case and see if we can get more 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Without the reprieve, Granich said, The Crossing will have to suspend its 
services while it finds a new home and raises money to pay rent. For those who 
have come to rely on the agency, even a temporary closure is a bleak prospect. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to see this place go," Ronald Pace, 37, said outside The 
Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
Added Jimmy Lloyd, who was homeless for eight months before The Crossing gave 
him food, friendship and help in finding work: "When I first came here, I was 
one of those people on the streets. And if it wasn't for The Crossing, I'd 
still be living there."

MAJOR AUCTION HOUSE GIVES FREE APPRAISALS, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
People carry shopping bags full of hope into the Westside auction house. 
</P>
<P>
It is a Tuesday, the day that Butterfield &amp; Butterfield holds its weekly 
appraisal clinic. 
</P>
<P>
From all over Southern California, people come bearing objects they secretly 
believe are worth a fortune -- old dishes, paintings, vases bought at flea 
markets, dusty Oriental rugs, toys, chairs, tarnished jewelry, things of beauty 
as well as things of astonishingly bad taste. 
</P>
<P>
On a busy Tuesday, 300 people show up at Butterfield's offices at 7601 Sunset 
Blvd., prepared to submit their treasures to the expert scrutiny of Los 
Angeles' only major international auction house. Whatever the outcome, the 
price is undoubtedly right. You see, Butterfield's doesn't charge for a clinic 
appraisal, which all but guarantees that some of the visitors are merely 
curious. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone who comes here wants to learn that he or she owns a gold mine, albeit 
one in the form of a silver platter or a kachina doll that has been in the 
family for 100 years. "This is a treasure hunt," says Stacey Roman, head of 
Butterfield's fine art department and the staffer who routinely rules on 
paintings. "I've had some great stuff walk in." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed he has. At one clinic, a woman brought in a handsome charcoal drawing 
she had inherited from her grandmother. No signature showed, but Roman lifted 
the matte and saw the drawing was signed "W.H." It was a study by Winslow Homer 
for a painting that is now in the collection of the Brooklyn Museum. The 
drawing sold at auction for $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
Butterfield's hopes that the fortunate few will consign their valuables for 
auction. The house makes 10% on such sales. But the appraisers are careful not 
to pressure potential clients. 
</P>
<P>
"We keep a file, and I will follow up, but we're not going to attack you," says 
Roman. On any given clinic day, he says, "there's one thing I salivate for, and 
they don't leave it." 
</P>
<P>
Most visitors are destined to be disappointed. One recent Tuesday, Roman had to 
dash the hopes of a woman with a 17th-Century Flemish painting in tow. It would 
be worth $5,000 to $6,000 in pristine condition, Roman told her. But it is 
worth much less because it has been so extensively restored. She shouldn't 
expect to get more than $2,000 for it, he advised. 
</P>
<P>
But Roman has good news for Roy Kunkle and Smith Bacon of Corona del Mar. Among 
the paintings the men brought in is a landscape that Kunkle recently bought at 
a garage sale in Orange County. Kunkle recognized the painter, Marion Kavanaugh 
Wachtel, as a major California Impressionist. "He has a better eye than I 
have," Bacon says admiringly of his friend. Kunkle won't say how much -- or how 
little -- he paid for the painting but allows, "It was a steal." 
</P>
<P>
Roman tells him the painting will probably bring $4,000 to $6,000. Kunkle signs 
the papers to have it sold. 
</P>
<P>
Ginny Magana, who runs an antique shop called Sentimental Journey in Big Bear 
City, sits waiting her turn. She has some old pendants she wants appraised, a 
Japanese Imari plate and an Irish Belleek pottery vase. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually appraise my own things," she says. "But these I don't want to sell 
right out. I want to find out their real value." She says she likes coming to 
the clinic because she always learns something. And she loves eavesdropping as 
other visitors unwrap their objects and tell the tales that lie behind them. "I 
could sit here all day and just listen to the different stories," she says. 
</P>
<P>
There are hundreds of stories at a typical appraisal clinic, enough to keep a 
soap opera -- call it "Auction House" -- running for years. Some of the tales 
are heartbreaking. "I had one woman who needed money for dialysis," Roman 
recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the objects are rich with meanings known only to their owners, 
reminiscent of the sled "Rosebud" in the movie "Citizen Kane." Elaine Greenwood 
of Glendale has come in to get an appraisal on a doll carriage that has been in 
her husband's family since 1875. The Greenwoods' cat, Fusa, had slept in it for 
15 years. But Fusa died recently, and now Greenwood feels sad every time she 
looks at it. "Besides," she says, "we're basically French Provincial." 
</P>
<P>
Butterfield's appraiser takes a photo of the carriage to send to the firm's San 
Francisco office, where an evaluation will be made. 
</P>
<P>
John King, who is Butterfield's director of furniture and decorative arts, says 
the character trait that clinic visitors have in common is curiosity -- about 
the history of their treasures if not about their monetary value. When he was 
best man at his twin brother's wedding, King recalls, guests going through the 
reception line whipped photographs of family valuables out of purses and 
pockets and asked him what they were worth. 
</P>
<P>
Like Roman, King has had great days in treasure hunting. 
</P>
<P>
He tells one story that has become a legend at Butterfield's. 
</P>
<P>
A Napa woman had an old copper lamp she detested stored away in the rafters of 
her garage. She decided to clean out the garage and give the lamp to Goodwill. 
It sat overnight in a cardboard box on the curb. The next morning she saw a 
Butterfield's ad in the newspaper that included a picture of a lamp just like 
hers. She ran out and retrieved the suddenly less loathsome object, which 
Goodwill had failed to pick up. King had the pleasure of telling her it was the 
work of master Arts &amp; Crafts coppersmith Dirk van Erp. It sold for $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
King and the other appraisers know that people often care mightily about the 
objects they bring in, even when they aren't worth much money. The auction 
business has its own lexicon of four-letter words that are scrupulously 
avoided. 
</P>
<P>
"I never say junk," explains Roman. "I always use decorative." 
</P>
<P>
On a good Tuesday, people are waiting in line when the clinic doors open at 10 
a.m. The appraisers are hoarse by the 3 p.m. closing. Butterfield's staffers 
estimate that only 5% of what they see is worth consigning. About half of that 
is actually consigned. 
</P>
<P>
Among those that got away this Tuesday is Sam Sarkissian. 
</P>
<P>
A resident of Whittier, Sarkissian inherited a set of 16th-Century icons when 
his grandfather died recently in Armenia. Butterfield's expert tells him the 
religious artworks are worth about $16,000 for the three pieces, not the 
$15,000 apiece Sarkissian hoped they would bring. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not worth it," he says, carefully re-wrapping his treasures and tucking 
them into a Lane Bryant shopping bag. "For $16,000, I'd rather hang them on my 
wall."

HOMEFED PLANS LOWER-INCOME LOAN INCREASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Responding to criticism from federal regulators, HomeFed Corp. on Friday 
unveiled a preliminary plan that would increase the number of housing-related 
loans that its HomeFed Bank subsidiary makes in low- and moderate-income 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed intends to increase the percentage of single-family and 
multiple-housing unit loans made in those poorer areas to 25% of total loans 
during 1991, HomeFed President Robert Adelizzi said Friday. During 1989, 15.4% 
of HomeFed's loan volume was in low- and moderate-income areas, according to a 
federal Office of Thrift Supervision report released on Friday by HomeFed. 
</P>
<P>
In that report, the OTS gave HomeFed's loan activity in poorer areas a passing 
grade based on seven of 12 criteria. But the OTS ordered the S&amp;L to show 
improvement in five other areas. The annual report was required under the 
Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which directs financial institutions to 
address the credit needs of lower-income consumers. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed's proposal to improve its performance in low- and moderate-income 
neighborhoods drew mixed reviews from activists who have been pushing the OTS 
to more strictly enforce the CRA. 
</P>
<P>
"I think HomeFed is moving in a positive direction," said Jim Bliesner, 
reinvestment director for a joint reinvestment task force operated by the city 
and county of San Diego. "If everyone (agreed to make 25% of loans in poorer 
neighborhoods) then we wouldn't see these dramatic pockets of disinvestment in 
San Diego. . . . I think 25% is a reasonable industry norm." 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed's plan drew criticism, however, from Tom Fox, executive director of the 
Normal Heights Community Development Corp, which in the past has clashed with 
HomeFed and other financial institutions on their lending to lower-income 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that HomeFed is attempting to do some damage control here," Fox said. 
"I don't see that they've addressed any of the criticisms in the (OTS) 
examination." 
</P>
<P>
Fox faulted HomeFed for failing to "create a process or a structure needed to 
assess local community credit needs." Rather, HomeFed continues to "react" to 
individual situations, Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
Fox also said that HomeFed did not create any new loan packages that are 
designed to deal with the special needs of poorer consumers. "They don't seem 
to realize that the same home loan made for (upscale homes in) Del Mar (won't 
work) . . . for Normal Heights, East San Diego or San Ysidro," Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the OTS didn't order HomeFed to make a set percentage of total loans 
in poorer neighborhoods, HomeFed set the 25% level as a "first step" because 
the OTS generally has approved CRA plans at institutions where a quarter of 
total loans are in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, Adelizzi said. 
</P>
<P>
Community reinvestment guidelines were set in 1977, but federal regulators have 
only recently begun to actively enforce them. "I think that the lenders are 
finally realizing that they have been a little asleep at the wheel" when it 
comes to CRA lending, Bliesner said. "I think the good ones will now take (the 
OTS' interest) as a good opportunity to build new CRA plans," Bliesner said. 
</P>
<P>
HomeFed, which in late October met with concerned citizen groups about its CRA 
plan, intends to create a lending committee that will review any loan 
applications from members of minority groups that are rejected, Adelizzi said. 
The S&amp;L also has hired a marketing firm that will create an advertising 
campaign aimed directly at minorities. 
</P>
<P>
The CRA lending committee will review loan applications from minorities that 
are rejected. The S&amp;L will then be able to "explain" to federal regulators 
why those loan applications are rejected, Adelizzi said. Although HomeFed 
rejects about 30% of its overall loan requests, about 37% of the applications 
from minorities are rejected, Adelizzi said.

ORANGUTANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Wallace's article on the illegal trade of animals in Thailand ("A 
Wildlife Smuggler's Paradise," Column One, Oct. 20) accurately described the 
problems facing endangered primates throughout Southeast Asia. However, towards 
the end of the article he stated that four of the "Bangkok Six" had died 
following their return to Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, two of the orangutans died as a result of static pneumonia, brought 
on by the effects of the unseasonably wet and cool June weather in Borneo on 
the weakened conditions of the animals. The death of these two orphaned apes 
only underscores the tremendous death toll faced by this endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
Not mentioned in the article is the incredible pet trade in Taiwan that has 
probably been responsible for the deaths of nearly one-third of all the 
orangutans in Borneo over the last two to five years. Based on reliable 
sources, the Orangutan Foundation estimates that nearly 3,500 orangutans were 
smuggled into Taiwan. Most of these orangutans died as a result of being 
smuggled in during the winter and in terrible conditions. Perhaps 10,000-20,000 
more may have died as the result of their capture, handling and transport. The 
Orangutan Foundation now faces the difficult chore of repatriating hundreds of 
these remaining orangutans from Taiwan to Malaysia and Indonesia. The first 
group of 11 orangutans are slated to return to Indonesia late this month.

BEAGLE FACTOR AND MEDFLY SUCCESS; 
</P>
<P>
STATE MUST DEVISE A PLAN, THEN SEE IT THROUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hearing the state declare "victory" over the Medfly left us uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
Uneasy sort of the way foot soldiers of the Imperial Guard must have felt 
before Napoleon led them into the seemingly unlosable Battle of Waterloo. They 
no doubt found graceful French ways of saying, "Yes, boss!" while silently 
praying, "God, we hope he knows what he's doing!" 
</P>
<P>
Does the state of California know what it's doing in the Medfly war? Public 
proclamations notwithstanding, the war isn't over. Even those celebrating 
"eradication" of the crop-destroying pests admit we have not seen the last of 
them. The anti-Medfly effort has merely changed; gone, thankfully, are the 
midnight helicopter runs of malathion mist. The routine of shutting windows, 
throwing tarps over school sandboxes and nervously checking the car finish the 
morning after is over -- for now. 
</P>
<P>
Over, but not forgotten. The new director of food and agriculture that 
Gov.-elect Pete Wilson is expected to appoint should review the 16-month, 
$52-million Medfly fight. He or she must devise a comprehensive strategy for 
the next Medfly find in Southern California. Unless many experts are wrong, a 
Medfly reappearance is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Three areas deserve further exploration: better detection of the pests already 
here; better ways of controlling the transport of pests into California and 
more research into nonpesticide or human-friendly weapons against all 
food-threatening pests. 
</P>
<P>
The state has made some strides in research with the passage of a law that 
creates a Center for Pest Research. It will coordinate all pest-control 
research performed in California and place greater emphasis on controlling 
pests biologically. The center is an important step, but sound research takes 
time. In the meantime, the state must have more immediate options. 
</P>
<P>
One option is better inspection of mail packages that may contain infested 
fruit. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says it already has increased its 
capacity to inspect fruit from overseas; the new state agriculture director 
should find out exactly what that means. It isn't sufficient if, as one 
official told The Times, the USDA effort consists merely of the addition of a 
single fruit-sniffing beagle. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest challenge ahead is detection. Budget constraints already have been 
cited as the explanation for the state's porous Medfly trapping system. But 
when the state had to, it came up with $52 million in taxpayer money to spray 
malathion over urbanized Southern California. The next agriculture director, as 
the new general in the Medfly war, must not lead Californians into another 
malathion-maximizing battle.

WHY NOT TAIWAN NOW?; 
</P>
<P>
BEIJING SHOULD FINESSE ONE-CHINA ISSUE, DROP OPPOSITION TO GATT ENTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine a world without Taiwan. Beijing would certainly like to, but that's 
hardly conceivable now. This booming island nation is among the largest and 
most successful traders in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Taipei, still suffering from more than four decades of political 
isolation,faces the prospect of being shut out of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade -- the key group of 100 nations that seeks to oversee world 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
But economic isolation of Taipei makes no sense to anyone -- except to its arch 
nemesis Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Beijing opposes Taiwan's application to become a member of GATT because of its 
"one-China" policy. How smart is that? After all, Beijing's own GATT 
application has been on hold since the Tian An Men Square massacre in June of 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Beijing should somehow finesse the one-China issue. After all, Taiwan tried to 
do just that, exhibiting sensitivity to Beijing when it made its application in 
January, not as sovereign government but as the "Customs Territory of Taiwan, 
Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu," the islands off the Chinese main land. 
</P>
<P>
Where is the United States? 
</P>
<P>
The State Department has expressed concerns about Taipei's bid, especially 
since Beijing has backed the U.S. position in the Persian Gulf and the effort 
for a peaceful solution in Cambodia. But the U.S. trade representative is 
encouraging GATT membership. 
</P>
<P>
Economic isolation of Taiwan is, practically speaking, impossible. Taiwan is 
the 13th largest trading nation and the United States' fifth largest trading 
partner. Its foreign reserves of $60 billion are second only to Japan's. Taipei 
and Beijing both are members of the Asian Development Bank and Pacific Economic 
Cooperation Council. Although the two have no official ties, Beijing benefits 
from investment, tourism and capital from Taipei. 
</P>
<P>
Taipei should be allowed to join GATT because as a member it would be obliged 
to follow trading rules established internationally. Keeping it out is silly.

She specifically stated how wonderful it would be if the demonstrators would

THE LEADER WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN; 
</P>
<P>
CRANSTON: HE HAS HAD THE LUCK AND ABILITY BUT PREOCCUPATION WITH DEAL-MAKING 
LEFT HIS PROMISE AS A LIBERAL BEACON UNFULFILLED. 
</P>

University, is the author of House and Senate (W.W. Norton).

<P>
Alan Cranston is a difficult man to hate. For all the allegations of improper 
dealings with bank regulators on behalf of savings-and-loan mogul Charles H. 
Keating Jr., Cranston's image will never be one of the underhanded schemer. 
Rather it is one of a steady Democrat and a reliable liberal whose early 
promise of leadership gave way to an almost obsessive penchant for deal-making 
and of an incredibly lucky politician whose luck finally gave out. 
</P>
<P>
The image is a complex one full of nuance and contradiction. He is both a 
Democrat and a democrat -- the only U.S. senator in my knowledge whose staff 
members routinely address him by his first name. But he was also a politician 
who moved easily in the circles of the high rollers whose interests were not 
always identical with those of the ordinary American. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the aftermath of the Democratic debacle of 1980 that I first had a 
chance to examine closely the career of the man who announced Thursday that he 
would not seek another term in the Senate. The election that brought Ronald 
Reagan to the presidency had also caused the defeat of some of the prominent 
liberal Democrats in the Senate. Swept out in the Reagan landslide were such 
liberal heroes as Birch Bayh, George McGovern, Frank Church and John Culver. 
Many of those who remained were either so fearful of presenting a high profile 
to Republican sharpshooters that they cowered in the aisles of the Senate or 
were looking beyond the Senate to the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Conspicuous among the liberal survivors was Alan Cranston, who pulled off the 
remarkable feat of defeating anti-tax conservative Paul Gann in a year in which 
the message of small, frugal government was selling briskly throughout the 
nation. That Cranston had bucked the trend and emerged victorious gave him 
almost a presumptive right to leadership among the remaining liberals in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
But it was more than Cranston's remarkable political luck that gave him a claim 
on leadership. Here was a founding father of the California Democratic Council, 
the group that gave form and voice to the state's once-beleaguered Democratic 
left wing. He was also part of the Senate leadership, having won the post of 
party whip in 1977 at the same time that Robert Byrd became the floor leader 
for the Democrats. He seemed to have the fortitude required of a leader, such 
as the ability to shrug off defeat. He had lost the job of state controller in 
1966 only to come back in 1968 to win a seat in the Senate in a bitter campaign 
against school superintendent Max Rafferty, who attempted to tie Cranston to 
anti-war radical groups. 
</P>
<P>
As I floated Cranston's name to people on Capitol Hill as the natural person to 
begin rebuilding the liberal edifice in the Senate, the reactions ranged from 
tepid enthusiasm to stark incredulity. One lobbyist who had been a Cranston 
staffer explained to me, "You have to understand, Alan sees his job as putting 
pieces together. Now that would be a good thing if it were harnessed to a 
different kind of personality." A staff member to a Democratic senator asserted 
that, "If the liberal Democrats wanted to have a voice and they said, 'Let's 
get a leadership guy,' they wouldn't turn to Cranston. He can't play that 
role." 
</P>
<P>
I was baffled as to why a senator who looked so good on paper would be 
dismissed so airily as a claimant on leadership. Part of the explanation seemed 
to be in the way he conceived his role as whip. A staff member to a Midwest 
Democrat said that Byrd had elbowed Cranston out of any important leadership 
activities so that, "Cranston has been nothing more than a valet." 
</P>
<P>
But a Byrd staff member rejected the assertion that Byrd was unwilling to give 
Cranston the running room he needed. "Flat out wrong," she said. "On many 
occasions, something is happening on the floor and Byrd will say that we've got 
to get Cranston to help, but Cranston could never get the whips going." 
</P>
<P>
If Cranston was not counting heads and rounding up votes, what was he doing? He 
was doing what he did best in the Senate -- making deals. Not corrupt deals, 
just pedestrian deals for the awesome constellation of special interests in 
California: aerospace industries, winegrowers, agribusiness, and the one that 
was to blow up so spectacularly in his face, the savings-and-loan industry. He 
was the chairman of the big board of congressional deal-making and sometimes 
the very cleverness of his transactions caught up with him. That happened in 
1979 when he tried to put together a package of water legislation that would 
benefit large farms while not antagonizing environmentalists. Both sides ended 
up angry at him. 
</P>
<P>
But all senators do deals for their constituents, especially in a megastate 
such as California. Deal-making is not a fatal flaw, so why should Cranston be 
singled out? The answer is that Cranston had it in him to be more than just any 
senator. He was courageous in his support of the SALT II treaty even when it 
appeared a lost cause. He could transcend the grubbiness of political 
horse-trading, but he never did so on a sustained basis. He could have been a 
liberal presence but settled for the role of someone whose star would only 
occasionally glimmer brightly. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, Cranston succumbed to that most corrosive of political diseases, 
the pursuit of incumbency for its own sake. So while there are a few monuments 
to Cranston scattered around, there could have been an Acropolis.

DARWINISTS, CREATIONISTS AND EVOLUTION

<TEXT>
<P>
When, oh when, are people ever going to understand poor Charles Darwin? The 
latest misunderstanding in your paper was submitted by a law professor, 
presumably an educated person. In an attempt to expose the unfortunate 
compatibility of science and bias, Prof. Johnson merely revealed a mixture just 
as regrettable -- education and ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
"Darwinists begin by assuming that science excludes the possibility of a 
creator." This is a statement by Johnson. Darwinists do not now, and have 
never, assumed this. Darwin's book is titled "The Origin of Species," not the 
origin of life -- there is a difference. Darwin's theory is an attempt to 
explain the generation of species after an initial creation of life. Darwin 
actually considered himself unqualified to speculate on the origin of life, and 
declared this lacking in his book.

The Department of Transportation has proposed a nationwide ban on the use of 
radar detectors on big rigs and is seeking public comments on this issue. 
(Business, Times, Nov. 4) 
</P>
<P>
I wholeheartedly support this measure. 
</P>
<P>
Radar detectors, also know as "fuzz busters," are designed solely to encourage 
drivers to exceed the speed limit and thwart speed enforcement efforts. This 
endangers lives. 
</P>
<P>
More people die or are injured in truck-involved accidents each year than in 
all casualties involving airplanes, trains and boats combined. Speed accounted 
for 37.8% of truck-driver-at-fault fatal and injury accidents in California in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Trucks with radar detectors are more likely to speed and SPEED KILLS! 
</P>
<P>
Legislation is necessary to prevent trucks from killing and injuring on our 
highways.

UNSER ON FAST TRACK EVEN AT DEL MAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
DEL MAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Al Unser Jr. already has cast a long shadow over Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
If practice means anything, he will be a factor in Sunday's International Motor 
Sports Assn. Camel Grand Prix of Greater San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh from winning the Indy-car championship with six victories -- the most 
since his father, Al Unser Sr., had 10 in 1970 -- he stepped inside a new 
Chevrolet V-8-powered Spice SE90P for Julian Randles and averaged 89.404 m.p.h. 
in Friday's first practice run for Grand Touring Prototype cars. His was the 
fastest clocking of the first session, and he did it on a course he had never 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Brundle, driving a Jaguar XJR-10, had a faster time in the first 
practice session for GTP cars, but it was generally disregarded around the 
track as a computer error. 
</P>
<P>
Brundle averaged 91.375 m.p.h. around the 10-turn, 1.62-mile course; he covered 
it in 1 minute 3.037 seconds, nearly 1 1/2 seconds faster than Unser Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Unser, however, was not concerned about Brundle's time. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I ended up the quickest," Unser said. "That Jaguar time was bogus; 
they made a mistake in the calculation." 
</P>
<P>
When Brundle's speed showed up on the computer, Jaguar press manager John 
Szymanski immediately said it was an innacurate time. "We had him sixth, in 
1:05.69," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fastest or not, there's no doubt about the speed of Unser's car. In the second 
session, Unser had the fastest time of the session, 1:03.285 (91.017 m.p.h.). 
Spice USA teammate John Cochran, who will be co-driving with Unser, finished 
second last year in the Camel Lights at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Unser surprised even himself with his performance; this is the first time he 
has raced at Del Mar and just the second time he's been in the Spice. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew the car was working well, but not as well as it was," he said. "The 
Spice car is a very good race car. It impressed me." 
</P>
<P>
The speed is essential for today's qualifying session on the unforgiving 
temporary layout on the Del Mar Fairgrounds. It is imperative to get on the 
two-car front row in Sunday's season-ending finale. 
</P>
<P>
"It's critical," Unser said. 'It's very, very hard to pass. It's pretty tight, 
but I like (the course) because we've got a good car. It's going to be pretty 
competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Unser could stand in the way of GT Series regulars Geoff Brabham, the GT 
championship points leader; Chip Robinson, the only one who can catch Brabham 
but needs a victory to do it; Juan Manuel Fangio, who has three victories this 
season; and Davy Jones, who has won twice this season for Jaguar. 
</P>
<P>
Jaguar has won at Del Mar the past two seasons. Jan Lammers won in 1989 and he 
co-drove with Brundle in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
With one day under his belt at Del Mar, Unser was pleased with the car and his 
performance. "I feel I've got a real good shot of winning the race if the car 
can stay together," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And he likes racing the GTP cars. 
</P>
<P>
"IMSA's a good racing series," Unser said. "The prototype cars are really kind 
of exotic and nice. They're real similar to the Indy cars. This is the next 
level down from an Indy car as far as performance, accelerating, cornering and 
braking, than any other car I've ever driven. The Indy cars are No. 1, the GTP 
cars are No. 2, and then it falls down considerably." 
</P>
<P>
The last time Unser drove a GTP car was in February at the 24 Hours at Daytona, 
where he teamed with cousin Robby Unser and Raul Boesel in a Porsche 962C. They 
placed seventh after retiring with transmission problems. 
</P>
<P>
Unser Jr. is competing at Del Mar as a favor to Chris Pook, president of Del 
Mar Race Management. 
</P>
<P>
"My Indy season was over and I didn't want to quit racing this year, and Chris 
Pook asked me if I wanted to ride at Del Mar and I said I'd love to," Unser 
said. "We got to talking about some cars, and the Spice cars are the best cars 
to be in, so Chris Pook asked them if they would consider letting me drive one 
and they said sure, so here I am." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grand Prix Notes 
</P>
<P>
Two Nissans are in the front row for today's one hour GTO/GTU race at 3:30 p.m. 
Steve Millen (82.922 m.p.h.) is on the pole and Jeremy Dale (82.849) is outside 
of him. . . . A first-time GTU pole-sitter is privateer Bill Auberlen of 
Rolling Hills (78.725), driving a four-year-old Mazda RX-7. It is Mazda's first 
pole this season. . . . The second practice session for GTO/GTU cars claimed 
four cars. Three of the cars were in an accident involving drivers Chuck 
Kendall (Ford Mustang), of La Canada who has a summer home in Del Mar, Don 
Swanson (Mazda MX-6) and Pete Halsmer (Mazda RX-7). A witness reported that 
Swanson of Carlsbad ran his GTU into the wall and the two faster GTO cars came 
upon it. All were taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla; Swanson and 
Halsmer were released, and Kendall was being kept overnight for observation 
because of a bruised heart. . . . Kendall's and Swanson's cars were beyond 
repair and each are out of the race. Halsmer, who had the second-fastest 
practice run at 81.978 m.p.h. before the crash, will try to repair his car. He 
will start at the back of the GTO field. . . . Before the crash, Lance 
Stewart's Mazda MX-6 burned. "It's a total write-off," Stewart said. "Something 
in the gasline broke; flames were coming out of the transmission while I was 
driving. It was touch and go for a few seconds; it took them a long time to put 
the fire out." . . . Dorsey Schroeder, driving a Whistler Mercury Cougar GTO, 
said, "(Qualifying) in fourth place, it's not going to be bad; it's going to be 
a race of huge attrition. There's going to be some crashes like we saw today."

CHARGERS' JOE PHILLIPS VOWS HE WILL 'PRESS ON';

His eye orbit has been reconstructed with the aid of plastic and a metallic 
plate. It may be another month or two before his fractured nose and cheekbone 
have healed. 
</P>
<P>
But Chargers' nose tackle Joe Phillips is back to work. 
</P>
<P>
"This has taken enough away from me," he said. "I'm not going to let it take 
any more. I'm going to press on." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips was attacked outside a Mission Bay Restaurant in the early hours of 
Sept. 26, allegedly by three men. After undergoing five hours of surgery to 
repair his eye orbit, Phillips returned to his parents' home in Oregon to 
recuperate. 
</P>
<P>
It's doubtful he will make it back in uniform in 1990, but he said he will 
rejoin the Chargers in the weight room and attend team meetings. He said he 
might be on the sideline Sunday for the game with the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially, it was almost impossible to accept," he said. "I was blind and 
basically was in a rage. They tried to put me in for a CAT scan, I couldn't see 
and got claustrophobic and flipped out. I was so sore over my entire body I 
didn't know what was hurting and what wasn't hurting. 
</P>
<P>
"I see pictures now of what I looked like when I first checked into the 
hospital emergency room and they are ugly. I mean ugly." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Stewart, 24, Brett Dost, 21, and David Hanna, 22, have pleaded not guilty 
to assault charges. Stewart and Hanna are free on $20,000 bail, Dost on 
$30,000. A preliminary hearing is scheduled Nov. 20. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't talk about the facts of the case because I'm going to be a witness," 
Phillips said, "and I want to make sure the justice system can operate. It's 
the best system in the world, and I want to give it every chance to bring these 
guys to justice. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been angry, real angry, but as time went on, it was like to hell with it. 
I didn't want to center on the anger, the resentment, the self-pity. I wanted 
to dwell on the positive, and the positive is I'm still alive, and I still got 
my eye. Now I just got to get back to football, and school." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips had been attending law classes at night at USD before the attack but 
he has been forced to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't read for about 3 1/2 weeks," he said. "It's out of my hands, I 
simply couldn't do it. I was supposed to graduate in May, but it probably has 
cost me a year." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips was considered the strongest player on the Chargers' roster, and is a 
mountain of a man. When he was admitted to the hospital after the attack, 
Phillips, who is 6 feet 5, weighed 326 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
He has lost 31 pounds in the weeks since his injury, but said, "I was in great 
shape when I got hurt. If I wasn't in that great of shape, I don't know what 
would have happened. What would have happened to a 170-pound man? At least I'm 
alive to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips, who is nicknamed, "Sasquatch," said he has learned something from the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't go to Mission Beach at 12:30 at night," he said. "My perspective on the 
whole thing is, it happened, and I hope it never happens to anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
"Never let anyone get close enough to hit you. If somebody starts to approach 
you, run away from them. Never let anybody get close enough to hit you, and 
watch your backside." 
</P>
<P>
It will be five to six weeks before doctors re-evaluate Phillips' physical 
condition, but he said he believes he will play football again. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to wait for the fractures to heal and the nose to heal," he said. 
"I've got to make sure it's as solid as it can be, because if I were to get a 
direct blow here again, the way they explain it, I'd lose the eye. 
</P>
<P>
"But I should be all right with a helmet on. It would have to be a blow harder 
than the one I got, and unless I took my helmet off, that wouldn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have a little double vision, and there's swelling in my cheek. There's 
numbness all down the side of my face, but hopefully the feeling will come 
back. The doctors think it will." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips also said his nose is not straight, "but who gives a damn," he said, 
"it works fine." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips played in the first three games of this season as the Chargers' 
starting nose tackle and had nine tackles. He had started 41 of the team's last 
48 games. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking forward to the season," he said, "and now the team is making 
progress and I'm not a part of it. That hurts."

Colorado, thanks to its faulty victory over Missouri, might well win the

Colorado Coach Bill McCartney has once again shown us that it's OK to cheat in 
college sports either purposely or by accident, just as long as you don't get 
caught.

What a fine example Colorado must be for the millions of young people who are

RAMS MAY BE BAD, BUT CAN EDDIE DOUCETTE CALL A DECENT GAME? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that Phoenix and Arizona have lost their Super Bowl, and rightly so, the 
NFL is thinking about awarding said Super Bowl to San Diego. In my mind that's 
pretty funny. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego is one of a few major cities that has refused to name a major street 
after Martin Luther King Jr. Whenever it is proposed that anything be named 
after Dr. King in our city, the racistsrise in mass protest and you will notice 
that Dr. King or his legacy are not really very evident in "America's Finest 
City." 
</P>
<P>
Is there any doubt that if a similar election were held in San Diego County to 
recognize Dr. King's birthday as a holiday, that it would go down to defeat 
just as it did in Arizona? For San Diego to be awarded the Super Bowl because 
of Arizona's lack of respect for Dr. King is a joke.

HE WANTS EQUAL TIME FOR THE BAD PLAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kneeling in thankful, public prayer by a football running back is becoming more 
and more of a religious ritual. In defense of logic, that same religious player 
who thanks God for a touchdown should also shake his angry fist toward heaven 
when he is stopped at the one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Most linemen and defensive players spend their entire careers without scoring a 
touchdown. If we are to have personal religious displays by those who carry the 
ball, then those non-carrying players should also have their moment to kneel in 
thanks for having made a great block or tackle. Perhaps a time for prayer 
should be allowed after each play for those who feel the need. 
</P>
<P>
As you see, the whole idea becomes absurd. May I suggest that just as we have 
separation of church and state, we also have separation of church and sport.

The only thing worse than watching the Rams this year is listening to Eddie 
Doucette call the play by play. 
</P>
<P>
Is it just us or does anyone have a clue as to what's happening on the field 
when Eddie is calling the game? He is a disgrace. An NFL franchise in a major 
market such as Los Angeles should have competent announcers. 
</P>
<P>
KMPC must have the same philosophy as do the Rams and John Shaw, find the 
cheapest guy available.

<TEXT>
<P>
David Peoples, the leader since the opening round, maintained a three-stroke 
advantage by shooting a five-under-par 66 in Friday's third round of the 
Kapalua International. 
</P>
<P>
Peoples' three-day total of 15-under 198 is three shots better than Davis Love 
III, whose 63 was Friday's low round and left him at 201. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Price, with a 66, and Tom Purtzer, 67, were tied at 202. 
</P>
<P>
Peoples, 30, has led since shooting a first-round 63 on the par-71 Bay Course 
at the Kapalua Resort on Maui. He started Friday's round with a three-shot lead 
over Purtzer in a bid for his first victory as a pro and $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I really played well from tee to green," Peoples said. "With only a three-shot 
lead on this golf course, I'm going to have to make birdies tomorrow. I can't 
sit back, I'm going to have to play aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
Peoples had one bogey and six birdies.

I see the Angels have once again raised ticket and parking prices for season 
ticket-holders, their best customers. Given the continuing mediocrity of the 
team, don't you think the Angels should be giving refunds to last year's season

In regards to Jim Murray's column of Oct. 28 ("A Guide to Olympic Diction"):

Jim Murray has constantly professed to deplore prejudice, but he is the most

perfectly acceptable to be prejudiced against one group of people, but just 
terrible to be prejudiced against another.

<P>
La Quinta High School wrapped up its first Garden Grove League football 
championship since 1985 and an undefeated regular season with a 30-0 victory 
over Los Amigos Friday night at Garden Grove High School. 
</P>
<P>
The loss ended the 16-year varsity coaching career of Art Michalik, who is 
retiring with a 81-72-3 record compiled at La Quinta, Pacifica and Los Amigos. 
</P>
<P>
Michalik was 30-43-2 in seven seasons at Los Amigos and guided the Lobos into 
the CIF playoffs in 1984, '85, '86 and '88. 
</P>
<P>
Michalik will be succeeded by assistant Steve Bolton next season. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta (10-0, 7-0), leading 6-0 in the third quarter, ensured the victory 
with three touchdown passes from quarterback Don Hopkins. Hopkins hit George 
Sanchez and Walter Dawkins with 27- and 19-yard scoring passes, respectively, 
for a 20-0 lead with 4:58 left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Hopkins intercepted a Los Amigos (3-7, 1-6) pass on the next possession and, 
two plays later, hit tight end Justin Sogoian with a 22-yard touchdown pass. 
Hopkins completed nine of 14 attempts for 179 yards and three touchdowns.TOM

WHITTIER CHRISTIAN FOILS BRETHREN BID

<TEXT>
<P>
Phil Bravo, Whittier Christian High School's football coach, knew his team 
didn't need any fancy offense Friday night against Brethren Christian. 
</P>
<P>
He just turned tailback Rex Pritchard loose. 
</P>
<P>
Pritchard ran for 176 yards in 16 carries and scored five touchdowns as 
Whittier Christian won its second consecutive Olympic League title with a 43-34 
victory over Brethren Christian at Lakewood High School. 
</P>
<P>
Pritchard's performance overshadowed a strong game by Brethren Christian 
tailback Frank Brady. 
</P>
<P>
Brady rushed for 145 yards and three touchdowns in 19 carries. He also caught 
two pases for 68 yards, including a 24-yard pass from Brandon Stott with 3:35 
left. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Pritchard who made the difference in the fourth quarter. He scored 
on runs of 12 and four yards in the final quarter as Whittier Christian (9-0, 
4-0) overcame a 20-19 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Bravo's assessment of Pritchard's play: "Rex played a great game. We came out 
pumped." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of all our kids," Bravo said. "No one gave them respect all year. 
Last year, when we had (running backs) Scott Jordan and Ron Papazian, we got a 
lot of attention. 
</P>
<P>
"But no one gave us a look this year. All we heard about was the 'Sweet 17' 
(Brethren Christian's 17 players) and Orange Lutheran." 
</P>
<P>
The loss left Brethren Christian's Division IX Playoff hopes in jeopardy with 
the Warriors (7-2, 2-2) needing a victory by Ontario Christian over Orange 
Lutheran tonight to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
Pritchard scored three first-half touchdowns on runs of 12, 26 and 10 yards. He 
had 94 yards rushing in 10 carries as Whittier Christian led, 19-13, at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Brady, who had 65 yards in eight first-half carries, scored on runs of 11 and 
five yards. 
</P>
<P>
Brady was a workhorse on Brethren Christian's opening drive of the second half. 
He caught a 44-yard pass from Stott and later scored on a four-yard run, giving 
Brethren Christian a 20-19 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier Christian came back to score two possessions later, driving 70 yards 
in six plays. A 12-yard touchdown run by Pritchard with 10:08 left in the 
fourth quarter gave Whittier Christian the lead for good, 27-20. 
</P>
<P>
The Heralds pushed the lead to 35-20 when Carl Martinez scored on a seven-yard 
run and Ron Rector added a two-point conversion run.

Ryan Bertoni got the breaks he needed in the final 5:51 and the junior 
quarterback passed Fountain Valley High School to a 22-21 upset victory over 
Marina Friday night at Westminster High. 
</P>
<P>
Bertoni, who completed two critical fourth-down passes, hooked up with B.J. 
Crabtree on a seven-yard scoring pass in the final 2:19 to close the gap to 
21-20. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley (1-9, 1-5) took the lead and the victory on Bertoni's two-point 
conversion pass to Marcos Diaz. 
</P>
<P>
Marina (6-4, 3-3) took a 21-14 lead on quarterback Cristin McLemore's second 
touchdown in the final 5:59. On Fountain Valley's ensuing possession, Bertoni 
completed fourth-down passes of 14 yards to Crabtree and 12 yards to Diaz, 
coming back two plays after the latter to hit Crabtree for the victory. BOB

Ocean View High School scored on four of five first-half possessions, then held 
off a late Huntington Beach drive for a 24-19 victory Friday in a Sunset League 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Hawks (5-3-1, 3-2-1 in league) were led by quarterback Randy Karliner, 
who rushed for 46 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Karliner scored on his team's first drive, with 5 minutes 11 seconds left in 
the first quarter, and again less than three minutes later, three plays after 
he intercepted a pass by Huntington Beach's Mike Chavira. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach scored five seconds into the second quarter on a 14-yard run 
by Nick Peters, but Ocean View answered with a 35-yard field goal by Ron 
Lightner and a five-yard touchdown run by Matt Barry. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers (5-5, 1-5) scored again with eight seconds to go in the half on 
running back Adam Bowermaster's eight-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View held off a last-gasp Huntington Beach effort. With less than a 
minute to go and the Oilers at the Sea Hawk seven, Chavira (15 for 31, 217 
yards and three interceptions) handed off to Bowermaster and broke downfield. 
Chavira caught Bowermaster's pass but came down outside the end zone. HEATHER

HAT TRICKS BY WADE, DOUGHERTY PACE SOCKERS

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Socker Coach Ron Newman has spent the first few weeks of the MSL season trying 
to figure out where Wes Wade fits into the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
After what happened at the Baltimore Arena Friday night, Newman might have a 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
Wade scored three goals, including the game-winner with three seconds left in 
regulation, to give the Sockers an 8-7 victory over the Baltimore Blast in 
front of a crowd of 7,423. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Dougherty, who played last season with the Blast and was signed by the 
Sockers as a free agent in the off-season, added a hat trick in a rematch of 
last year's MSL championship series won by the Sockers, four games to two. 
</P>
<P>
Newman said Wade's scoring output was a bonus -- since Wade was inserted into 
the game as a defensive ploy. 
</P>
<P>
"We put him up there to stop Baltimore from knocking balls into the corner," 
Newman said. "We put him there to put pressure on Baltimore. We played him up 
there last year as a defensive runner, and he's matured a bit." 
</P>
<P>
That's what happened on the game-winner. With Socker defender Kevin Crow 
battling a pair of Blast players for a ball in the right corner, Wade sneaked 
into the penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
Crow bounced a pass out of the corner, and Wade beat goalkeeper Hank Henry from 
10 feet out. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a scramble in the corner. I fought off a defender and got just 
enough room. The ball hit at my foot. It was a little bit of luck, too," Wade 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wade's goal spoiled Henry's Baltimore debut. 
</P>
<P>
Henry, who had trained with the Sockers for two weeks before signing with the 
Blast Thursday, made 15 saves. His Sockers counterpart, Victor Nogueira, made 
18 stops to help the Sockers break a three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Wade said Blast Coach Kenny Cooper's decision to start Henry against the 
Sockers "put too much pressure on him (Henry). He did a great job, but we got 
chances we shouldn't have gotten and we put them in." Newman said Baltimore 
(2-4) expected too much of Henry, whose MSL resume expanded to five games after 
Friday's action. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough thing to ask of the boy," Newman said. "We tried to make it as 
difficult as we could for him. But he didn't make a big mistake that hurt 
Baltimore."

LAGUNA HILLS BEATS ESTANCIA, WINS LEAGUE

<P>
After beating up on its Pacific Coast League football rivals all season, Laguna 
Hills High School had no trouble thrashing hapless Estancia, 38-0, Friday night 
at Newport Harbor High. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks (8-1-1, 5-0) became league champions and qualified for a spot in the 
Southern Section Division VII playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles (2-8, 1-4) were the league champs in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The first quarter set the tone as Laguna Hills' opening drive lasted more than 
three minutes and resulted in quarterback Casey Sullivan's run 21 yards into 
the end zone. Running back Marwan Saba (14 carries for 102 yards) ran seven 
times for 62 yards on that drive. Marc Brodbeck kicked the first of three extra 
points. 
</P>
<P>
After Estancia could not get any offense going on its first possession, Laguna 
Hills' Dan Ciska blocked the kick and charged 20 yards into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, good field position allowed the Hawks' Brodbeck to kick 
a 40-yard field goal, followed by a drive downfield on the next possession 
which resulted in a touchdown pass from Sullivan (six of 11 for 103 yards) to 
Sergio Jimenez with 1:30 left in the half. The Eagles successfully made two 
goal-line stands in the second half, but tough defensive play by Ciska didn't 
allow the Estancia offense room for improvement on the first half's dismal 
performance. MARGIE LUCK

Brea-Olinda High School defeated Western, 37-14, Friday night at Brea-Olinda to 
win the Orange League football title. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats (7-3-1, 4-0-1), who scored three second-half touchdowns to break 
open a close game, are the first team other than Valencia to win the league 
title in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Brea led 16-14 at halftime but scored twice within 56 seconds in the third 
quarter to put the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very tentative in the first half," Brea Coach Jon Looney said. "I told 
the kids at halftime, if you want to win championships, you have to get after 
it, and we certainly did in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the third quarter, Lew Morales ran 14 yards for a touchdown, and 
Brea led, 23-14. On the ensuing kickoff, the ball bounced off a Western player, 
and the Wildcats recovered. That led to a 10-yard touchdown pass from Jason 
Luevanos to Shawn Bickel that made it 30-14 with 3:31 left in the third. 
</P>
<P>
Western (3-7, 1-4) stayed close with two first-half touchdowns, on John 
Walder's 93-yard kickoff return and Mike Brito's four-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
But Brea's defense shut Western down in the second half, limiting the Pioneers 
to just two first downs and 86 yards. SCOTT JONES

Palmdale scored three third-quarter touchdowns to expand an 8-7 halftime lead 
into a 29-7 victory over Saugus in a Golden League game Friday. Palmdale earned 
a spot in the Division II playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The game was played without incident. A year ago, the game ended in the fourth 
quarter when Palmdale defensive back Darius Wilson punched an official. 
</P>
<P>
Vashon LeCesne intercepted a pass by Jason Bobby and returned it 45 yards for a 
touchdown on the third play of the second half. Tervell Spears scored on 
Palmdale's next possession on a 52-yard run up the middle. Defensive lineman 
Shane Barnard scooped up a fumble and raced 15 yards for the Falcons' final 
score. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale (4-6, 3-2) opened the scoring when Rodney Williams returned a punt 55 
yards in the second quarter. Williams, the team's quarterback, completed nine 
of 15 for 113 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus (2-8, 1-4) was led by quarterback Rich Gutierrez, who completed six of 
10 passes for 85 yards. ROB SONNER

COLLEGE FOOTBALL: TEAMS' STRENGTHS WILL COLLIDE TODAY WHEN THE TOREROS PLAY AT 
AZUSA PACIFIC.

<P>
The University of San Diego knows that Azusa Pacific quarterback Brian Hunt is 
averaging 291 yards and 25 completions per game. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa Pacific, on the other hand, is familiar with the fact that the USD 
defense is yielding only 133.8 passing yards per game and has intercepted 13 
passes this season. 
</P>
<P>
Strengths collide at 1:30 this afternoon at Azusa Pacific, as both schools hope 
to finish the season 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
For USD, that would equal its record of a year ago, its best since 1981 when 
the Toreros finished 9-1. The NCAA Division III playoffs, however, are probably 
out of the question. Redlands (7-1) all but wrapped up the West Coast bid with 
a 52-14 rout of Occidental last week. 
</P>
<P>
USD is coming off a bye after defeating Menlo College, 28-14, in Atherton two 
weeks ago. Senior Dave Bergmann, the top Division III kicker in the nation last 
year, kicked three field goals in that game and needs one more to tie Robert 
Lozzi (1981-83) for USD's career record (27). 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Brendan Murphy completed 14 of 26 passes for 146 yards and a 
touchdown against Menlo. Murphy has yet to throw an interception in 134 
attempts this season. He had 10 last year in 99 attempts. The school record for 
fewest passes intercepted in a season is four, set in 1980 by Steve Loomis 
</P>
<P>
Azusa Pacific, ranked 24th in NAIA Division II, is coming off a 27-23 loss to 
UC Santa Barbara last week despite compiling 534 yards of offense. Derick 
Williams, a freshman wide receiver, is second on the team with 27 catches for 
318 yards. Brandon Leafblad has 33 catches for 394 yards. USD defeated the 
Cougars, 24-6, in last year's season opener, but trails in the series 14-9. 
</P>
<P>
"Physically, they are a little better than us in the skill positions," USD 
Coach Brian Fogarty said.

CHULA VISTA TOPPLES SWEETWATER TO EARN THIRD CONSECUTIVE METRO TITLE

<P>
All season long, the student bodies at Chula Vista and Sweetwater high schools 
viewed the season finale as The Game in the Metro Conference. They figured -- 
just like old times -- the county's longest continuous rivalry (43 years) to 
decide the league race would be a doozy. 
</P>
<P>
They were right . . . until the final 24 minutes or so. Then it was all Chula 
Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans won their third consecutive Metro championship by beating 
Sweetwater, 28-6, in front of about 4,000 at Sweetwater. Chula Vista, ranked 
sixth in the county, will head to the playoffs 8-2, 7-0. Sweetwater, ranked 
seventh, is 7-3, 6-2. The Red Devils, who slipped to third behind Southwest 
(8-2, 6-1), should make the playoffs as an at-large team. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater (averaging 29.8 points per game) and Chula Vista (27) came into the 
game ranked fourth and eighth in the county, respectively, in scoring offense, 
but it took 23:55 for either team to score. 
</P>
<P>
With five seconds left in the first half, Neviett Richardson (12 carries, 60 
yards) scampered in from the five-yard line for a 7-0 Spartan lead. Using the 
same play -- an off-tackle blast Chula Vista calls "56 power" -- Richardson ran 
for 17 yards on the previous play. A few seconds before that Chula Vista faced 
a fourth and 10 at the 32 with 53 seconds left, but Sweetwater called a 
timeout. After an offsides penalty, quarterback Brandon Gregg (five carries, 72 
yards) ran 10 yards on an option keeper. 
</P>
<P>
To begin the second half, Chula Vista's Winfield Scott and LeMar Bailey teamed 
for a 49-yard kickoff return on a reverse. Steve Gomez, who rushed for 118 
yards to give him a league-leading 1,119, then carried five, 10 and 30 yards 
for a touchdown down the right sideline, and the rout was on. JIM LINDGREN

DESPITE ORIGINS, FESTIVAL OF BRITAIN WAS GREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's Festival of Britain was an unusual amalgam of events. It was a 
retail event, designed to promote British goods and make money for South Coast 
Plaza. It was an artistic festival for the South Coast Plaza area with 
productions at South Coast Repertory, the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 
and the showing of Oscar-winning English films, among many other events. 
</P>
<P>
There were free events, such as a performance at Town Center Park by Beatles 
impersonators, Rain. There were film festivals, plays, art exhibits, concerts, 
lectures, held all over Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the fact that most of the cultural events were of the highest 
quality, some critics implied that the festival was limited in scope and vision 
because it was part of a retail promotion. 
</P>
<P>
In the Calendar section ("The Real Britain Was Not Seen in Arts Festival," Oct. 
29), Cathy Curtis explained, "Had the festival been the brainchild of a 
cultural group or a Peter Sellars-style impresario, had it been conceived 
solely as an arts event . . . we'd have stood a better chance of understanding 
the real Britain, and the overwhelming social tensions confronting it today." 
</P>
<P>
Cathy's description of an ideal festival may work in Los Angeles, a city that 
has a cultural history and a plethora of benefactors. 
</P>
<P>
But, Orange County is young culturally. Thirty years ago, it was little more 
than orange groves. 
</P>
<P>
Today, its economy is booming, and it is striving hard to catch up with major 
cities, culturally. 
</P>
<P>
Business people such as Henry Segerstrom, co-chairman of the Festival of 
Britain, and Arnold Beckman are responsible for many of the county's cultural 
accomplishments thus far. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's icons are not Peter Sellars or Zubin Mehta. They are business 
people who realize that a county does not thrive by business ventures alone, 
that the soul of an area is its culture. 
</P>
<P>
So what if the Festival of Britain started as a retail event and moved into the 
cultural venues? 
</P>
<P>
If South Coast Plaza continues to make money while it enriches the county 
culturally, that's great. If business continues to boom here, maybe Zubin Mehta 
will move here. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that I loved the Festival of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing "The Red Shoes" on a large screen was a thrill. I loved "The Importance 
of Being Earnest," a play that was publicized as part of the festival. 
</P>
<P>
In the two years that I've lived here, I've seen the quality and variety of 
culture improve steadily. If business helps to bring culture here, I say more 
power to the business. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles may have the clout to thumb its nose at Orange County. But that's 
because the city to the north became rich and famous on the movie industry, and 
then got itself culture. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's Orange County's turn.

TV'S 'SOUTH AFRICA NOW' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was saddened to read Howard Rosenberg's Oct. 26 column on KCET's decision 
(later rescinded) to cancel "South Africa Now." 
</P>
<P>
When I discovered "South Africa Now" on Channel 28 I was pleased to see, for a 
change, TV journalism that told not only the efforts made by South Africa's 
government to dissolve apartheid but also the events that directly affect black 
South Africans. 
</P>
<P>
The series has been fair and has reported very well the atrocities that have 
plagued the indigenous people as well as the country's descendants of 
Europeans. So far as I am aware, this depth of coverage is unavailable 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
I applaud KCET manager Stephen Kulczycki and president William Kobin for 
subsequently deciding (at least temporarily) to keep the program despite 
pressure from the Committee on Media Integrity and its chairman, David 
Horowitz. Not allowing the perspectives of "South Africa Now" to be aired would 
be political and moral cowardice.

CRITIQUING TAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As one who has studied with many of our greatest tap masters at tap festivals 
across the country, I was upset by Cathy Curtis' Oct. 29 review of Rhapsody in 
Taps. 
</P>
<P>
The review was an example of one of tap-dancers' major concerns now -- the 
problem being that tap is not critiqued as an art form. 
</P>
<P>
Seldom are choreographic style, rhythmic accuracy and interest, musicality or 
technical ability mentioned; costume and body type are always discussed. 
Perhaps one solution: Tap, being a percussive art, could be reviewed by a jazz 
critic (who enjoys dance as well). 
</P>
<P>
In the review there was no discussion of the fantastic jazz music performed by 
the company's musicians, who at one point were joined by dancers playing 
percussive instruments. 
</P>
<P>
I was flabbergasted at the comment that "maybe something's amiss with the 
concept of an all-woman tap company, which can't indulge in the theatrically 
effective gambit of teasing by-play between the sexes. Maybe tap just wasn't 
meant to be performed by bodies that aren't all small-boned and whippet-lithe." 
(I'm glad that no one said this to the late, great Steve Condos!) 
</P>
<P>
This is not only closed-minded but outright sexist! How can tap move forward as 
an art form if it is critiqued on the basis of the sex of the dancers, body 
type and what they wore? If I want to see "teasing by-play between the sexes," 
I'll go to the movies. If I want to see and hear great tap-dancing, I'll go see 
Rhapsody in Taps.

AN EMOTIONAL FISH FLOUNDERS IN L.A. DEBUT AT CLUB LINGERIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ROSENBLUTH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Irish quartet An Emotional Fish begs the questions, Which emotion? What 
fish? At its Los Angeles debut Thursday night at Club Lingerie, the mercurial 
band showed signs of starfish lineage but proved to be mainly flounder. 
</P>
<P>
Nurtured by U2's Mother label in Ireland, An Emotional Fish shares its mentor's 
passion but little of its pizazz. 
</P>
<P>
Gerard Whelan is an intriguing front man blessed with an elastic voice, but 
ultimately his affectations smothered his appeal. At one point he ran around 
the half-filled club, hiding behind speakers and poles, then leaped back onto 
the stage to announce, "Darling, I'm home." Later came an impenetrable 
monologue about little boys and girls that would have worked better as a Jim 
Morrison parody than a serious attempt at art. 
</P>
<P>
The pretension detracted from some moments of marvelous music. The show opened 
promisingly with "Strange Things," a deliciously sultry bit of sing-speak not 
found on the group's self-titled debut album. And "Celebrate," one of the few 
Fish songs with lyrics that aren't self-consciously odd, sounded just as 
invigoratingly joyous during the encore as it did when the band played it as 
part of the regular set. 
</P>
<P>
But the misses outnumbered the potential hits, and Whelan had to resort to 
telling the crowd to shut up and listen. The members of An Emotional Fish are 
probably still talking about the audience that got away. JEAN ROSENBLUTH

No longer is it just Raffi or Sharon, Lois and Bram dominating the children's 
music market. The recent explosion in the marketplace has meant rapidly 
increasing listening options for young consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a look at four recent additions to the children's music market, 
beginning with two choice selections on the Golden Music label, from the 
publishers of Golden Books (Western Publishing Co. Inc.): 
</P>
<P>
Bob Schneider's exuberant tribute to an American tradition, "Playing Baseball," 
captures the myth and the magic of the sport with an infectious combination of 
musical styles from '50s rock and turn-of-the-century pop to gospel and 
ballads. Titles include "De Ump," "Run Do Run, "Play by Play" and "Spring 
Training Delight." An evocative ballad, "Baseball Hall of Fame," pays homage to 
such greats as Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio and Willie Mays. It's a treat for fans 
of any age. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, upbeat David Jack scores with "Gotta Hop!" Like his winning "Dance 
in Your Pants" album, "Gotta Hop!" is sheer whimsy, cleverly executed and 
tuneful enough to prevent parents from climbing the walls during repeat 
playings. 1950s-style rock, calypso rhythms and kid-pleasing silliness 
highlight original songs such as "Mookie-Pookie Yodelin' Cow," "The Dinosaur 
Dip" and "Walkin' Through the Jungle." 
</P>
<P>
 At toy stores, department stores and bookstores. Cassette, $6.99 to $8.99. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
For a smoother road trip, don't leave home without "A Car Full of Songs," 
written and sung by folk great Tom Paxton. It's a mellow sing-along, a 
grin-producing grab bag full of tunes such as "Are We There Yet?," "Somebody's 
Hungry," "I've Gotta Go" and "Dad's Not Lost"; game songs "License Plate," "I 
Spy" and "The Wheels Go 'Round" and a warm, nostalgic lullaby for weary young 
travelers, "Sleepin' in the Back Seat." Paxton's buttery voice and wry wit make 
an effortless transition from adult to children's fare. 
</P>
<P>
 From Pax Records, distributed by Alcazar in Vermont. Available at specialty 
children's book and music stores, and Waldenbooks. Cassette, $9.98. Distributor 
information: (802) 244-5178. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
"Aesop's Fables, the Smothers Brothers Way" is a curiosity, more likely to 
appeal to adults than children. In this re-release of their '60s album, Dick 
serves as storyteller, interrupted by the ever-befuddled Tom, who can't quite 
grasp such Aesop conclusions as "honesty is the best policy" and "necessity is 
the mother of invention." "Are we going to be authentic Aesop's fablers, or are 
we going to be derivative?" Tommy asks. 
</P>
<P>
Dated references to the Culligan Man and "the little old winemaker" may lose 
young listeners, as may the smart brother/dumb brother, 
"Mom-always-liked-you-best" bickering that stops each story in its tracks. When 
they get around to singing, however, the battling Brothers' smooth folk 
harmonies are as appealing as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 From Music for Little People: cassette, $9.98; compact disc, $12.98. To order: 
(800) 346-4445.

JANSONS CONDUCTS LENINGRAD PHIHARMONIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony, a work heard hereabouts, year in and year out, 
more than regularly -- in the last 10 days, one could count at least three 
performances in local halls, for instance -- is so familiar we often take it 
for granted. 
</P>
<P>
But there was nothing to take for granted Thursday night when the visiting 
Leningrad Philharmonic played the second of its four tour programs in the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and ended it with the ubiquitous Fifth. 
</P>
<P>
As was reported after the Leningrad orchestra appeared in Costa Mesa on Sunday 
-- with the same program it later performed on Wednesday in the Pavilion -- its 
Tchaikovsky playing is revelatory. 
</P>
<P>
This time, associate conductor Mariss Jansons led the orchestra in a program 
beginning with a suite from Prokofiev's "Romeo and Juliet," and the same 
composer's First Piano Concerto. 
</P>
<P>
Jansons, who proved his expertise as a Tchaikovskian when he made his debut 
with the Los Angeles Philharmonic in March, 1988, again showed his mastery at 
the close of this agenda. 
</P>
<P>
The Latvian-born musician's reading of the Fifth had the musical authority and 
emotional grasp of his remembered Second, Fourth and Sixth Symphonies with our 
own Philharmonic, at those Wiltern Theatre performances. 
</P>
<P>
Fervor, plasticity of line and emotional directness made this a memorable 
performance. And the Soviet orchestra played splendidly, giving Jansons all the 
sweep and detailing of his well-paced conception. Some of those details will 
remain in the memory for a long time to come. 
</P>
<P>
The Prokofiev half of this performance, however, disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
In the "Romeo" suite, Jansons seemed to encourage the band to overplay. He 
certainly did not discourage the very loud and unmodulated blasting that 
emerged regularly during these five movements. What one heard at the peaks of 
loudness was more noise than resonance, and quite unpleasant. Also, the playing 
was unbalanced and exhibited quirky tone qualities. 
</P>
<P>
The disappointment in the D-flat Piano Concerto was in not being able to hear 
with reasonable clarity what seemed to be a definitive reading by Dmitri 
Alexeyev, who had played the Third Concerto at the concerts of Sunday and 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Alexeyev would appear to be as accomplished and charismatic as his reputation. 
What one could hear, beneath the sonic storm usually covering his playing, made 
the blood rush and the eyebrows raise. And in a work we used to consider more 
interesting than cherishable. Obviously, this is a pianist.

'JEEVES AND WOOSTER' SUPREMELY SILLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRV LETOFSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the world of silly, P.G. Wodehouse holds supreme rank. The mention of his 
name to the devoted will bring twisted smiles. 
</P>
<P>
Not straight-on, run-of-the-mill happy smiles, you understand, but twisted 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
Now PBS, via Granada Television in England, brings P.G.'s Jeeves and Wooster 
characters to its "Masterpiece Theatre" in a series of five single-hour 
escapades, the first one airing Sunday (8 p.m. on Channels 50 and 24, 9 p.m. on 
Channels 28 and 15). Simply titled "Jeeves and Wooster," it stars Stephen Fry 
as the elegantly wily manservant Jeeves and Hugh Laurie as Bertie Wooster, who 
has bumbling in his blue blood. 
</P>
<P>
And there are a swarm of other Wodehousians that ripple off the tongue, such as 
Barmy Fotheringay-Phipps, Gussi Fink-Nottle, Lord and Lady Wickhammersley, the 
Rev. Beefy Bingham, et al. 
</P>
<P>
Fry and Laurie are quite supreme themselves when it comes to silly, zany, 
goofy, daffy, loony and loopy. They ordinarily are not given to restraints -- 
as witness their series now running on the Bravo network, "A Little Bit of Fry 
and Laurie." But in this case their playing is especially notable, even though 
they are locked into character assignments, albeit on the edge of human 
endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie's Bertie is supremely clumsy for every occasion. This plays neatly 
against Fry's Jeeves, who may be employed at a lower social rank but operates 
on a loftier plane of guile. 
</P>
<P>
This is 1920s-30s English twit humor, which is a whole universe unto itself. 
There's nothing quite like it in the annals of what makes funny. IRV LETOFSKY

ENCOUNTERS THAT SPUR DIALOGUE BETWEEN JEWS AND CATHOLICS; 
</P>
<P>
INTERFAITH: ONE BOOK IS AN EASY-TO-READ ENCOUNTER BETWEEN CATHOLIC ARCHBISHOP 
O'CONNOR AND HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR ELIE WEISEL. THE OTHER USES THE BIBLE AS THE 
CANVASS ON WHICH TO DRAW COMPARISONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN J. HUBBARD, Hubbard teaches a course on Judaism and Christianity at 
Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The genesis of both these remarkable books was the mutual admiration of the 
respective authors and their desire to enter into profound interfaith dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
The one, a face-to-face encounter between the cardinal archbishop of New York 
and a Nobel Prize-winning Holocaust survivor, touches on contemporary concerns 
between Jews and Catholics. It can be read in one sitting -- and you will feel 
the warmth and emotion of the participants as if you were in the room with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The other is a series of letter-like essays about the Bible between a 
priest-sociologist-novelist and a rabbi-Talmudist-religious historian. It must 
be read in several sittings with considerable effort but corresponding rewards, 
because it brings the Bible to life quite startlingly -- as well as the Jewish 
and Catholic faiths nurtured by the Scriptures. 
</P>
<P>
The Weisel-O'Connor conversation takes up the Holocaust and the Church's 
responses to it, particularly those of Pope Pius XII. Though Weisel feels the 
Pope "did not do enough," he has heard there are documents in the Vatican that 
show otherwise but have not been made public: "Maybe if I were to see those 
documents, I would change my mind." The two men also differ on whether Pope 
John Paul II should have met with Austrian President Kurt Waldheim (Weisel 
thinks not) and whether the Vatican should recognize Israel (Weisel thinks so). 
</P>
<P>
There are poignant moments of consensus in the dialogue -- on the immense 
tragedy of the Holocaust, the persistence of anti-Semitism, the dignity of the 
Jewish and Catholic faiths, and the way each man revered his father. 
</P>
<P>
The backdrop of the Neusner-Greeley dialogue is, as noted, the immense biblical 
canvas. For the rabbi, this includes the oral Torah, that collection of 
legal/Talmudic and narrative/Midrashic commentaries on the Hebrew Scriptures by 
the rabbis of the first six centuries. Neusner opens his Christian readers to 
the riches of the oral Torah, especially the rabbis' efforts to see the 
biblical stories as parables for life: "Abraham, Isaac, Jacob -- these 
patriarchs stand not for themselves but for the life of Israel, the holy 
people, and each incident in (his life) resonates in the private life of each 
Israelite, every Jew." 
</P>
<P>
For Neusner, this is painfully true of the Nazi genocide, about which he 
comments: "For Abraham (in the near-sacrifice of Isaac) had to be ready to give 
one, but mothers and fathers in our own time gave all." 
</P>
<P>
It is unfortunate that the tightly worded, sometimes obscure style of the 
rabbinic writings apparently has left its mark on Neusner's own prose, which is 
at times hard to follow. 
</P>
<P>
Moving to the New Testament, Greeley calls Jesus "a visionary like the 
prophets, though a stable and solid visionary. He differed from them primarily 
in the wild splendor of his vision . . . a vision that then seemed too good to 
be true and still does. Finally, the vision was too subversive, too disturbing, 
too revolutionary, so, as Jesus probably understood early on, He would 
eventually have to die for it." 
</P>
<P>
Greeley adds that the title "messiah" has such different meanings for Jews and 
Christians that most of them are talking past each other on this issue. 
</P>
<P>
Neusner views the Jesus of the Gospels as foreign to the Judaism of the rabbis 
because of the claim of "absolute uniqueness" made about him: "Those who 
receive Jesus' disciples receive him and therefore the One who sent him. And 
that is a claim that sages in the oral Torah make for everyone who studies 
Torah, but not for one particular master -- never." 
</P>
<P>
Along with their different assessments of Jesus, Greeley and Neusner also 
disagree on whether Christianity and Judaism can conduct dialogue. Despite the 
fact that he and Greeley have "read Scripture together," Neusner thinks the two 
faiths, as such, cannot converse. Their presuppositions about the nature of 
piety, salvation and messianism make it impossible. Greeley, aware that not all 
is shared, thinks dialogue on what is held in common -- God, origins, stories, 
sacred books, etc. -- is vital. 
</P>
<P>
The rabbi may be right in theory, the priest in practice. So what else can Jews 
and Catholics do but keep on conversing?

THE GRACE AWAKENING. Charles R. Swindoll. Word, hardcover, 311 pages, $15.99. 
</P>
<P>
The newest book of the Fullerton pastor went quickly to the top of the 
Christian bestseller list. 
</P>
<P>
Swindoll goes after "grace-killers," evangelicals who try to prescribe limits 
on fellow believers' activity, whether it be moviegoing, dancing or worship 
style. He says the forgiveness and freedom of grace is also the "oil that 
lessens the friction in marriage."

A onetime national United Methodist official claims the dizzying decline of 
mainline churches since the early 1960s might be solved by catching up with 
modern biblical research and theology, abandoning bland "positive thinking" 
preaching and stop blessing material success. JOHN DART

IN DEFENSE OF KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am very disgusted with your article on the New Kids on the Block 
("Low-Voltage Outing for New Kids," Sept. 14). They've been described many 
times as the hardest-working kids in show business. 
</P>
<P>
Who are you to say that their concert didn't have enough energy? You sent one 
reporter to one concert. There's no contrast. You have to send at least two 
reporters. You also need to compare two concerts. Everyone makes mistakes. You 
can't control the way your voice comes out if you're singing live. 
</P>
<P>
You are even telling us not to waste money on New Kids items. Maybe they aren't 
your idea of a good buy, but maybe that's none of your business. You described 
Donnie as being stubble-faced and obnoxious. You might think so, but I don't 
see 4 million people screaming and willing to do just about anything to get 
your autograph. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe you didn't think the concert was that good, but I can guarantee you that 
hardly any fans that went to that concert came home unsatisfied with their 
performance.

LAWSUIT WASTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I can't believe what I'm hearing. Members of Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa 
are complaining that the noise levels around the Pacific Amphitheatre are 
excessive during concerts. 
</P>
<P>
What do they expect -- they live near an outdoor amphitheater! Should tens of 
thousands of music fans be forced to drive to Los Angeles to see a decent 
concert because a few hundred local residents find the occasional noise 
"annoying"? It seems equally absurd that tax dollars are being spent on a long, 
drawn-out lawsuit, and to dispatch expensive noise-monitoring equipment every 
time there's a concert at the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
A little more tolerance on the part of the residents in the interest of 
cultural diversity in Orange County seems in order. If all else fails, the 
county might consider supplying each of the aggrieved residents with a free 
pair of earplugs. Regardless of the solution, we need to stop wasting tax 
dollars on this frivolous lawsuit and start worrying about Orange County's real 
problems.

ASK THE HANDYMAN: CRACKS IN CULTURED-MARBLE COUNTER LEAVE FEW OPTIONS FOR 
HOMEOWNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: Less than a year ago, I installed a cultured-marble counter and sink in our 
second bathroom, and in a very short time, I've noticed small hairline cracks 
forming around the drain. Is there any way I can just buff those out? 
</P>
<P>
S.A., 
</P>
<P>
Lake Forest 
</P>
<P>
A: "That's unusual for a new sink to develop cracks like that," says Larry 
Hohenstein of Amco Builders and Plumbing Supply in Costa Mesa. "They usually 
form with age. There's really not much you can do at this point because of the 
way the sinks are made. Cultured marble is made with a plastic overlay that 
gives it color. However, what happens is that during normal use, when you get 
toothpaste, cleansers, drain cleaners and all the other things people put in 
their sinks onto the surface, it destroys the plastic. When it gets to the 
point where you're really embarrassed by it, you'll just have to replace it. 
</P>
<P>
"There is one product, 100% cultured onyx, that can be repaired. It's a little 
more expensive than the marble, but when you have cracks, you can attach a 
lambs-wool pad to your drill and buff them out." 
</P>
<P>
Q: The plaster surrounding the outside of my shower has formed blisters in 
which the plaster has bubbled and inside there's a powdery substance. I would 
assume it's caused by moisture. How do I get rid of it? 
</P>
<P>
T.L., 
</P>
<P>
La Habra 
</P>
<P>
A: "It sounds like it's a gypsum plaster, and what really needs to be used in 
that area is a cement plaster or a cement backer board with tile, something 
that won't absorb water," says Lee Ferguson of Alpine Plastering in Fullerton. 
"Ideally, the plaster in that area should be removed down to the bare studs and 
a paper-back lath should be put on, then the cement plaster applied on top of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Q: Isn't there something I can put on my hands and arms while painting that 
will keep paint from sticking to my skin? 
</P>
<P>
S.B., 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
A: "Try a product called 'Glove Coat' that you rub into your hands before 
painting," says Mike Payne of Vista Paint in Orange. "After painting, you just 
wash with soap and water, and it should come right off." 
</P>
<P>
Q: In remodeling our bathroom, I'd like to keep the present bathroom tile, 
remove the tub enclosure and install a shower curtain. However, the enclosure 
is about 9 years old, and I'm afraid that once we get it off, we won't be able 
to make the tile on the walls that are underneath match the rest of the tiles. 
Any suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
P.Y., 
</P>
<P>
Orange 
</P>
<P>
A: "When an enclosure has been there for years, it will tend to discolor the 
tile," says John Wintercorn of Martin Shower Door in Chino. "Unfortunately, 
there's no magic solution to remove it. After removing an enclosure, we will 
scrape it with a putty knife and then a single-blade razor to remove any 
caulking, then go over it with scouring powder. I've heard of people using pool 
acid to try to get stains off, but that's really too dangerous to work with. 
I'd recommend just trying with abrasives and filling in the holes left by the 
enclosure with some type of quick-setting sealant." 
</P>
<P>
Q: In rearranging furniture, I found a problem with a lamp I'd like to have sit 
on a corner table. In order for it to work, I would have to string the cord 10 
feet to the nearest wall socket. Would it be hard to string the cord under the 
carpet to the socket? 
</P>
<P>
P.B., 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
A: "That's probably the easiest and best solution; the only problem is it's 
illegal," says Arlan Strong of Uni-Lite in Anaheim. "The fire codes say you 
can't have electrical cords under rugs, mainly because they're stepped on a 
great deal and they get worn and you don't notice it until it starts a fire. 
The only other way to do it without having the cord show is to install an 
outlet on the floor."

SMITH LEADS CRESPI PAST NOTRE DAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Notre Dame High controlled its destiny in its Mission League finale against 
Crespi on Friday, but Crespi quarterback Cody Smith and all-purpose player Ryan 
Kieling ruined it all. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who was wearing a flak jacket under his jersey to protect the bruised 
kidney and bruised ribs he suffered last week, completed back-to-back touchdown 
passes in the fourth quarter to give Crespi a 21-10 win at Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams had clinched playoff berths before the opening kickoff, but Notre 
Dame (6-3-1, 4-1-1 in league play) could have shared the league title and been 
the league's top-seeded team if it could have held on to its 10-7 first-half 
lead. Notre Dame finished in third place, one game behind champion St. Paul 
(5-0-1). Crespi (8-2, 5-1) finished second. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic directors from Notre Dame and St. Paul met Thursday for a coin toss 
that would determine which team would get the higher seeding if both schools 
won their final league game. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame Coach Kevin Rooney, who also is the school's athletic director, won 
the toss but kept it a secret from the team before the game. 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul defeated Alemany, 24-14, to take the title and the top seeding. The 
Knights will be the third-seeded team from the Mission League. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi regained the lead in the fourth quarter when Smith hit tight end Frank 
Romano over the middle for an 18-yard touchdown and a 14-10 advantage. Romano, 
a 6-foot-3, 218-pound senior, was hit by a host of tacklers but managed to 
bulldoze his way into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
It was Kieling's 59-yard touchdown reception on the Celts' next possession that 
put Notre Dame away. On third and 15, Smith hit Kieling in the right flat on a 
down-and-out pattern, and one quick move gave the receiver an open field. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I caught the ball, I saw him coming up," Kieling said. "I knew he was 
going to leave his feet and that if I put a move on him, he'd miss me." 
</P>
<P>
The defender did miss, and Kieling was on his way to his second touchdown. 
Kieling, who returns kickoffs and punts, was putting the moves on defenders all 
night, but he was doing it from a new position -- tailback. 
</P>
<P>
Kieling, who had carried just once -- for two yards -- before the game, 
finished with 49 yards in seven carries. The 5-foot-7, 143-pound senior also 
led all receivers with five catches for 85 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi opened the scoring on its second possession. Kieling took a handoff from 
Smith and made his way through heavy traffic on the left side before cutting 
back the opposite way for a 30-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame responded with an 11-play, 51-yard drive on its next possession, but 
the Knights' fourth-and-14 attempt picked up only 12 yards and Crespi took over 
at its 15. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame defensive back Bob DaCorsi returned an interception 37 yards to make 
the score 7-7.

WASHINGTON HELPS PROPEL GRANADA HILLS TO 21-0 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A pack of Harley-Davidson motorcycles rolled into the stadium at Granada Hills 
High on Friday night, part of the school's homecoming festivities. 
</P>
<P>
There was leather everywhere on the noisy chopped hogs, and almost as much 
chrome as there is in, say, the Highlander trophy case. 
</P>
<P>
The bikes served as an escort of sorts for Granada Hills fullback Brett 
Washington, who has thighs the size of saddle bags and a nose for the open 
road. And once again, when the Highlanders squeezed the clutch, Washington hit 
high gear as Granada Hills thundered past El Camino Real, 21-0, in a West 
Valley League game. 
</P>
<P>
The victory assured Granada Hills of the league's top seeding in the City 
Section 4-A Division playoffs and clinched at least a share of the school's 
fifth consecutive league title. It was the fourth shutout in six conference 
games for the Highlanders, who limited El Camino Real to 67 yards. 
</P>
<P>
After a scoreless first half, Granada Hills cashed in the game's first big 
break. On third and 11 from the Granada Hills 38-yard line, Conquistadore 
backup quarterback Terry Morrow flipped a bad pitch to running back Chris 
Griggs. The ball was picked up on a bounce by defensive back Derrick Stewart, 
who was tackled at the El Camino Real 44. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the big play," said Washington, who gained 168 yards in 26 carries. 
"It pumped Derrick up and it pumped the rest of us up." 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders (8-1, 6-0 in league play) pumped it inside to Washington -- who 
carried on seven consecutive plays. Washington finished off the drive -- and in 
effect, the Conquistadores -- when he scored on a 14-yard run inside with 5 
minutes 2 seconds left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Nice play calling," quipped Highlander co-Coach Tom Harp, who handles the 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, who accounted for 65% of the team's offense (257 yards), was again 
the man in the fourth quarter. Washington turned a third-and-four play into a 
34-yard touchdown run with 6:55 left in the game and scored on a two-point 
conversion for a 14-0 Highlander lead. 
</P>
<P>
"That might be the best I've seen him run," Granada Hills co -- Coach Darryl 
Stroh said. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills put El Camino Real (6-2, 5-1) away on the Conquistadores' next 
possession when Morrow, pressured out of the pocket by a blitzing Stewart, 
tossed a pass that was intercepted by Alonzo Finney. 
</P>
<P>
Finney raced 30 yards for a touchdown and a 21-0 lead, the same margin of 
victory when the teams met in conference play last season. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real was unable to establish anything offensively in the first half, 
either, and piled up just 51 yards. The Conquistadores managed to cross the 
50-yard line twice in the half and could penetrate no further than the 
Highlander 38. 
</P>
<P>
And the Highlanders were dishing out more than just statistical punishment. El 
Camino Real quarterback Evan Howland was carried off the field with a possible 
dislocation of the left hip after he was sacked by Chris Zane with 7:10 left in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
There were chances, but the Highlanders twice failed to convert fourth-down 
plays inside the El Camino Real 30 in the second quarter. After driving to the 
Conquistadore 26, a holding call backed up the Highlanders and quarterback 
Bryan Martin's fourth-down bootleg was stopped for a four-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders moved to the El Camino Real 30 on their next possession, but 
Martin was victimized by a pair of dropped passes. The drive stalled when 
Martin's fourth-and-nine pass from the 30 fell incomplete with 2:05 left in the 
half.

SANTA PAULA CLAIMS FRONTIER TITLE, 17-14 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was not a straight line and it was not the shortest distance between two 
points, but Santa Paula followed the zigzag running of Dustin Magdaleno to the 
Frontier League football title Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Magdaleno, Ventura County's all-time career reception leader, failed to catch a 
pass but instead grinded his way to a career-high 187 yards in 22 carries as 
Santa Paula held off a furious Fillmore rally for a 17-14 victory at Fillmore 
in the 80th meeting between the schools. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore quarterback Art Sosa's desperation pass from midfield on the game's 
final play was batted away by a Santa Paula defender at the five-yard line, 
preserving the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula, which improved to 8-2 and 4-0 in league play, leads the series, 
46-33-1. Fillmore, which suffered its second consecutive loss, is 8-2 and 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
"The line just blew open holes like a torpedo," said Magdaleno, who entered the 
contest with 33 catches but only 419 yards rushing. "It was a team effort." 
</P>
<P>
While the Santa Paula offensive line was opening the way for Magdaleno, the 
defensive line was holding back Fillmore's Tory Cabral. 
</P>
<P>
Cabral, hampered by an ankle injury, was limited to 53 yards in 19 carries and 
three receptions for 53 yards. But 40 of those receiving yards came on a 
three-play, 72-yard drive that cut Santa Paula's advantage to 17-14 with 2 
minutes 27 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore's Gabino Martinez then recovered Eddie Rabingo's fumble at the 
Flashes' 34 with 55 seconds left to set up Sosa's desperation pass. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Fausset connected with Chris Gomez on a 14-yard scoring pass with 3:14 left 
in the second quarter and Steve Dysart added the extra point for the only score 
of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula scored again on its opening possession of the second half when 
Dysart's 38-yard field goal put Santa Paula ahead, 10-0, with 9:07 left in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore cut the lead to 10-7 on a two-yard plunge by Cabral on the Flashes' 
ensuing series. 
</P>
<P>
Art Marcelo, who had two interceptions in the first half, reeled in an 18-yard 
touchdown pass from Fausset to give Santa Paula a 17-7 advantage five minutes 
into the fourth quarter.

SAN FERNANDO OVERCOMES TURNOVERS, KENNEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM COLEMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is always interesting when San Fernando High takes to the football field 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
One never knows if the Tigers will carve up the opponent with the precision of 
a Dr. Jekyll, or if their alter ego, Mr. Hyde, will appear and put on an ugly, 
monstrous demonstration of football. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night at San Fernando, the Tigers showed a little of both personalities 
as they survived six turnovers in defeating Kennedy, 28-24, in a North Valley 
League game. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 18th meeting between the teams, and San Fernando (5-4, 3-3 in league 
play) leads the series, 11-7. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers, who have fumbled 11 fumbles in the past two games, came from behind 
to win, driving 67 yards in 19 plays in the fourth period. The winning 
touchdown came on a 13-yard fourth-down pass from quarterback Cruz Trevino to 
running back Leonice Brown with 2 minutes 19 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy (5-4, 2-4) drove to the San Fernando three-yard line in the final 
seconds, but Ontiwaun Carter fumbled on fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
Carter finished with 136 yards in 29 carries and scored on runs of 12 and five 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Brown led all rushers with 149 yards in 21 carries and scored on a 69-yard run 
in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy had 135 yards in penalties to five yards for San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
It was all Kennedy in the first period; the Golden Cougars spent almost the 
entire 12 minutes in San Fernando territory thanks to two Tiger fumbles and an 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy scored first on a 53-yard wind-aided field goal by Keith West and added 
a 12-yard touchdown run by Carter later in the period. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando controlled the second period, helped by a pair of Carter fumbles 
that gave the Tigers excellent field position. William Taylor's 41-yard 
touchdown run cut the Kennedy lead to 10-6, but the snap on the conversion 
attempt bounced to holder David Rojas, who was smothered. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor scored again on an eight-yard run with 6:18 left in the first half, but 
Brown fumbled on the two-point conversion attempt and San Fernando settled for 
a 12-10 lead at intermission. 
</P>

BUENA SECURES PLAYOFF BERTH, 19-10

<P>
A relentless rushing attack led Buena High to a 19-10 victory over Santa 
Barbara on Friday night in a Channel League game at Santa Barbara. The victory 
gives Buena (5-5, 5-2) a second-place finish and a berth in the Division II 
playoffs for the third consecutive season under Coach Rick Scott. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Erik Eads led the Buena ground game with 139 yards in 18 carries 
and fullback Chuck Mullaney added 63 yards in 15 carries and scored two 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Buena put together an impressive 11-play, 80-yard drive, with Mullaney's 
one-yard dive propelling the Bulldogs to a 12-10 halftime lead. The Bulldogs 
ate up 8 minutes 34 seconds of the clock on the opening drive of the third 
quarter. Mullaney's four-yard touchdown run capped a 15-play, 63-yard drive to 
put Buena on top, 19-10. 
</P>
<P>
Buena scored on its first possession, quarterback Mike Dexter throwing a 
seven-yard touchdown pass to fullback Matt Kemsley. 
</P>
<P>
Senior wide receiver Simon Banks gave Santa Barbara (5-4-1, 3-3-1) a 
short-lived 10-6 lead in the second quarter on his streaking 36-yard touchdown 
catch from quarterback Dustin Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
Buena running back George Keiaho, who needs only 28 yards rushing to become the 
first freshman in Southern Section history to rush for 1,000 yards, suffered a 
strained knee earlier in the week and did not play. PAUL OLSON

<P>
Running back Tobaise Brookins gained 238 yards in 36 carries and scored three 
fourth-quarter touchdowns as Sylmar High clinched the East Valley League title 
with a 45-28 victory at Poly. 
</P>
<P>
The game had been close until Brookins broke loose in the fourth quarter. 
Sylmar (8-0, 6-0 in league play) led, 24-21, late in the third quarter with 
Poly (6-3, 4-2) about to receive a Sylmar punt. But a clipping call charged on 
a Poly lineman before the ball hit the ground gave the ball back to Sylmar. 
Nine plays later, Brookins dashed for a 19-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar then recovered a fumbled kickoff to set up Brookins' next score, a 
two-yard run. ADAM BENSON

<P>
With pressure for democratic reform mounting in the monarchies of the Persian 
Gulf, Saudi Arabia's King Fahd has announced that the kingdom is preparing to 
resurrect a national consultative assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The assembly -- which would probably be appointed at first but eventually 
chosen by national election -- would for the first time in recent years give 
Saudi Arabia's increasingly restless intelligentsia and business community an 
official place in government decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
The move comes just days after an unprecedented demonstration in the Saudi 
capital of Riyadh by 50 women who drove their cars in a convoy for more than 
half an hour to protest restrictions prohibiting women from driving. To the 
chagrin of a cadre of religious authorities who had demanded punishment for the 
demonstration, a committee of top legal and religious scholars subsequently 
announced that the women had violated no religious or civil laws. 
</P>
<P>
Taken together, the two events represent a startling move toward opening a 
rigid political and social structure that for decades has been dominated by 
conservative Islamic tradition and the ruling Saud family. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, Saudi officials cautioned privately that no time has 
been set for appointment of the consultative assembly, and many predicted a 
backlash from Saudi Arabia's conservative majority against a whole series of 
reforms being advocated by the country's liberal, largely Western-educated 
minority. 
</P>
<P>
Pressures for democratic reform have been building steadily within the 
conservative regimes of the Middle East in recent years. But the Iraqi invasion 
of Kuwait on Aug. 2 has propelled the process in the Persian Gulf, raising 
doubts about the ability of small, tightly controlled ruling families to guard 
against outside incursions and prompting questions in the West about the 
propriety of sending in troops to protect non-democratic governments. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Saudi Arabia has been presented with the example of Kuwait, 
whose exiled ruling family announced that it was restoring the dissolved 
national assembly and whose refugee women, permitted to drive in Kuwait, have 
been caught driving on Saudi streets. American military women in uniform also 
have been permitted to drive military vehicles in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
A new openness has been building steadily in Saudi Arabia since the invasion, 
most readily apparent in the Saudi press, which has documented the military 
buildup here with relative freedom and, contrary to previous restrictions 
against criticizing Arab leaders, has unleashed a journalistic barrage against 
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Criticism of the Saudi regime is still forbidden, but Saudi newspapers were 
full of unusual banner headlines proclaiming "democracy" in Kuwait on the day 
after the Kuwaiti ruling family's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Saudi editors Thursday night, King Fahd announced that he is 
reviewing final recommendations for a national consultative council and for a 
system of regional governing councils. 
</P>
<P>
"I had announced on several previous occasions our determination to execute the 
important organization that we have seen will serve the general interest of the 
state and will help it in performing its duties while keeping pace with the 
comprehensive development the kingdom is going through," the king said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a committee of "honest men of great responsibility and absolute 
dependability" are preparing a final draft proposal for the monarch's review, 
the king said. "We will announce its implementation as soon as the final draft 
is completed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia had an advisory Majlis al Shura, or Shura Council, through the 
early days of the kingdom in the 1930s and had actively discussed resurrecting 
it in the early 1980s, until fallout from the Iranian revolution prompted a 
nervous monarchy to shelve the proposal. A gleaming new building for the 
proposed council still stands vacant in Riyadh. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you have a crisis, you tend to put off fiddling with your system," 
explained one Saudi government official, who said officials are now confident 
about proposing an advisory council because of apparent widespread public 
support for the Saudi government's handling of the new gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
However, the official predicted that actual implementation of the council may 
be delayed because of opposition from traditional segments of Saudi society who 
favor the direct access to the king and local governors that they have enjoyed 
through the weekly majlis, in which any citizen can present grievances. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would a person in his right mind go to his senator when he feels he can go 
to his king?" he said. "Most people will say, 'We really don't need it. The 
ones who are pushing for it are our Western-educated intellectuals who live in 
the cities and who don't really represent Saudi Arabia.' " 
</P>
<P>
Most of the pressure for creating a Shura Council has come from urban 
businessmen, academics and writers who insist they are not seeking a 
Western-style democracy in Saudi Arabia but who do want more voice in national 
decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a whole different attitude now because of this crisis," one political 
science professor in Riyadh said. "I think the government is feeling the 
seriousness of the whole thing. There will have to be a consultative council." 
</P>
<P>
An official who advocates more openness in government complained that the 
bureaucracy in Saudi Arabia has become too entrenched, with members of the 
royal family not accountable to the public for their decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"I have too much authority," he said in a recent interview. "I'm not 
accountable to anybody but my conscience." 
</P>
<P>
Although the king has not yet set a time for implementation of an advisory 
council, he added, "It's a question of a few months, or a year or two, not a 
few years." 
</P>
<P>
The women's demonstration in Riyadh this week has prompted many Saudis to 
predict that driving privileges for women may also be only a matter of time. 
</P>
<P>
While driving through the capital city, the women, from some of Saudi Arabia's 
most prominent families, were careful to wear the traditional black abaya and 
veil demanded by custom. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested them after about half an hour on the road. "The police stopped 
them because it was like seeing a pink elephant," said one Saudi familiar with 
the demonstration. There is no specific law prohibiting Saudi women from 
driving, but Islamic tradition in the country prevents it and women are never 
issued a driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the religious police, officially known as the Committee for 
the Prevention of Vice and the Commendation of Virtue, demanded their 
detention. They also advised that husbands who knew about their wives' conduct 
should divorce them because of their obvious inability to control them, or if 
they were unaware of their wives' plans, they should punish them. 
</P>
<P>
The women countered that with the possibility of impending war they could not 
in an emergency depend on their drivers, who might quickly flee. They insisted 
that they were not attempting to imitate American women but other Islamic 
women, such as the Kuwaitis, who have always been permitted to drive. 
</P>
<P>
The brouhaha quickly reached King Fahd, who announced that the governor of 
Riyadh had appointed a committee of religious and legal scholars to look into 
the matter. The women had violated no civil laws or basic tenets of Islam, 
though they were advised not to repeat the activity.

PLAGIARISM ISSUE RAISED IN COLLEGE WORK OF DR. KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. plagiarized or inadequately credited other authors' 
works in his doctoral dissertation and other college writings, according to a 
Stanford University history professor appointed by King's widow to edit the 
papers of the civil rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of that finding, by Clayborne Carson at Stanford and by other 
researchers, Boston University is reviewing whether King's 1955 doctoral degree 
in theology should be revoked retroactively. But officials said that such a 
drastic step is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Carson and King's associates in the civil rights movement said Friday that the 
discovery of plagiarism by King in his student days, no matter how disturbing 
to strict scholars, should not detract from later achievements of the Nobel 
Peace Prize laureate. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what it shows is that there was an earlier stage in King's life when 
there were other goals in his mind. He wanted to succeed as a student of 
theology and he wasn't practicing to be the Martin Luther King who has become a 
kind of national icon," Carson said in a telephone interview. "He was just a 
flesh-and-blood human being with flaws and limitations." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference, the Atlanta-based organization King once led, said: "We're 
impressed by Martin Luther King's footprints and are willing to forgive any 
youthful errors in his footnotes." 
</P>
<P>
Carson, an expert in the history of black Americans' struggle against bias, 
said the findings of plagiarism in the dissertation and other student writings 
by King were emotionally "draining" for him and other researchers. "There is 
very little elation about this kind of discovery. But I wouldn't be a historian 
if I didn't think it's better to know than not to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The interim president of Boston University, Jon Westling, said the allegations 
of plagiarism "merit close scrutiny" and he appointed a committee of scholars 
to look into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"Thirty-five years ago, as now, the university's standards for the proper use 
and attribution of scholarly sources were strict, explicit and explicitly made 
known to all graduate students," Westling said. But, he added, to investigate 
allegations against a dead man unable to defend "any misleading appearances" 
will be difficult. King was assassinated in 1968 in Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
The findings have delayed an ambitious plan to edit and publish all of King's 
papers in 14 volumes. The first two volumes, covering King's life until just 
before the start of the Montgomery, Ala., bus boycott in 1955, were to be 
published this year. But now all the papers are being scrutinized for possible 
borrowing and are not expected to be published until 1992, complete with 
annotations showing similarities to others' works. 
</P>
<P>
The King papers project is sponsored by the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for 
Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta and is conducted in association with 
Stanford, Emory University and the University of California Press. 
</P>
<P>
Staff members of the King papers project first became aware in 1988 of 
insufficiently credited similarities between some of King's academic papers and 
other writers' texts. How to address the issue reportedly caused much debate at 
the King Center last year. A spokesman at the King Center declined comment 
Friday and said King's widow, Coretta Scott King, who appointed Carson as top 
editor, wanted the Stanford professor to handle any press inquiries about the 
matter. Carson said Friday that he had planned to discuss the findings in a 
history journal article next year but decided to talk publicly after the Wall 
Street Journal published an article Friday about the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Luker, the project's associate editor, said Friday that he would not 
attach the word plagiarism to King's writings but would let others reach their 
own conclusions. "Plagiarism is a charge and I am not making such a charge," he 
said. Yet Luker, who works out of Emory University in Atlanta, said that he 
"had lost sleep" over the findings and that several graduate students quit the 
project because "the research was to some extent spiritually enervating." 
</P>
<P>
King himself donated many of his writings to Boston University six years before 
his assassination, but Mrs. King is suing to retrieve those documents. 
According to Carson, that donation shows that King probably felt no guilt about 
his scholarly work and was not trying to hide any plagiarism. 
</P>
<P>
King's dissertation, entitled "A Comparison of the Conceptions of God in the 
Thinking of Paul Tillich and Henry Nelson Wieman," presented some of Tillich's 
ideas in passages nearly identical to Tillich's but did not credit him. 
</P>
<P>
But that is not the worst of academic sins, because those sections were clearly 
intended to represent the views of Tillich, an influential Protestant 
theologian who died in 1965. Worse, in the view of most universities' 
standards, was King's appropriation of works by other writers about Tillich, 
including a 1952 doctoral dissertation by another Boston University student. In 
his own thesis, King cited that dissertation by Jack Boozer in the general 
bibliography but did not credit Boozer for particular passages. 
</P>
<P>
"What we can say is by the strict definition of plagiarism, which is the 
appropriation of words or phrases, there are instances of plagiarism in King's 
papers," Carson said. "But in most of the cases, the sources were . . . in the 
bibliography or on another page." 
</P>
<P>
The revelation about King's student writings may be viewed by some as another 
dent in his image. For example, last year, King's former close associate, the 
Rev. Ralph David Abernathy, published a book which included details about 
King's extramarital sex life. 
</P>
<P>
Abernathy, who died in April, said he did not expect his account to diminish 
King's stature. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Lowery, who had disputed parts of Abernathy's book, urged the public 
not to think any less of King as a result of the plagiarism issue. "Sometimes 
those who are in a high level of scholarship become so involved with technical 
secondary issues that they overlook the substantial issues," Lowery said in a 
phone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Carson's project has not yet researched King's later and more famous writings 
and speeches. But other scholars have noted similarities in those to works by 
other ministers and social activists. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Williams, author of "Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years," the 
1987 book tied to the PBS television series of the same name, said there is "no 
doubt" that King or the aides who helped write his speeches sometimes borrowed 
from others' words. To say otherwise, he said Friday, would be "intellectual 
dishonesty." But Williams, now a Washington Post reporter, emphasized that 
focusing on this aspect of King's work was petty, and he feared it will be used 
by "people who haven't gotten over the fact that King was such a great man and 
that we are a changed society in large part because of him." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMPARING THE TEXTS 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a passage from King's 1955 doctoral dissertation and a similar passage 
from a 1952 dissertation by Jack Boozer, another Boston University student. 
They both deal with views of theologian Paul Tillich. In his bibliography, King 
cited Boozer's dissertation, but did not credit this particular passage to 
Boozer. 
</P>
<P>
KING 
</P>
<P>
Tillich insists that a symbol is more than a merely technical sign. The basic 
characteristic of the symbol is its innate power. A symbol possesses a 
necessary characteristic. It cannot be exchanged. A sign, on the contrary, is 
impotent and can be exchanged at will. 
</P>
<P>
BOOZER 
</P>
<P>
Tillich distinguishes between a sign and a symbol. A characteristic of the 
symbol is its innate power. A symbol possesses a necessary character. It cannot 
be exchanged. On the other hand a sign is impotent in itself and can be 
exchanged at will . . .

TRANSITION -- EIGHT WEEKS THAT WILL SHAPE THE STATE;

POLITICS: GOVERNOR-ELECT WILSON MUST SELECT HIS KEY AIDES AND DEVISE A BUDGET.

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Otto Bos quickly found out what it is like to be a senior adviser to a 
governor-elect this week. He had been out with friends on a boat in San Diego's 
Mission Bay celebrating Pete Wilson's victory and was disembarking when he 
reached up and felt his chest. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised," he recalls. "I thought I had put on muscle or weight during 
the campaign, then I discovered I had about 20 resumes in my pockets." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and his closest aides can expect to receive thousands of resumes in the 
next few days as friends, relatives, contributors, campaign workers, hangers-on 
and some present appointees of Gov. George Deukmejian line up for roughly 1,000 
soon-to-be-vacant political jobs that pay from $40,000 to $100,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first week alone we had over 3,000 job applications," Steven A. 
Merksamer, Deukmejian's first chief of staff, said of that Administration's 
first weeks. "We had tens of thousands in the course of the transition." 
</P>
<P>
Before he takes office on Jan. 6, Wilson also must piece together a state 
budget proposal to send to the Legislature. And the fiscal picture is bleak. 
Budget officials already are forecasting problems that could approach or even 
surpass this year's, when Deukmejian and the Legislature spent much of the 
summer trying to close a $3.6-billion revenue gap. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete will face some of the most important decisions he'll make as governor in 
the next two months," Merksamer said. "I'll never forget when George 
(Deukmejian) and I went in to see Jerry Brown after the election and he said 
you may not believe this, but your decisions during the next two months will be 
your most important. I realized it was true in the abstract, but I never 
realized how true it really was until much later." 
</P>
<P>
It will be a hectic eight weeks. Besides surrounding himself with a team of 
senior advisers and cabinet members and creating a budget for one of the 
world's largest governments, Wilson must also take care of some personal 
business: like settling on a place to live, deciding how to redecorate his 
office -- every governor has a different style -- and staging the inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson already has begun to make some of those decisions, at least the easy 
ones. The day after the election, he designated Robert S. White, 48, who has 
been his top aide in three elective offices, to be his chief of staff in 
Sacramento. Bos, 45, a longtime adviser who directed Wilson's winning campaign, 
assumed the title of communications and public affairs director for the 
transition. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilson Administration also will have a Deukmejian hue. Loren Kaye, 34, 
deputy cabinet secretary for Deukmejian, has been named Wilson's policy 
director. Terrance Flanigan, 43, Deukmejian's appointments secretary -- the 
gatekeeper who screens job applications and recommends whom to appoint -- will 
serve the same role for Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the governor-elect came to Sacramento to begin making the really 
tough decisions, such as appointing a finance director, who basically will keep 
track of taxes and spending. Next to the chief of staff, this will be the most 
important appointment Wilson makes. 
</P>
<P>
There were rumors -- not denied by Wilson's inner circle -- that the leading 
candidate for finance director was Thomas Hayes, the appointed state treasurer 
who lost in Tuesday's election to Democrat Kathleen Brown. Hayes is a former 
state auditor general with broad fiscal experience and substantial knowledge of 
state government. "Pete obviously has a high regard for Tom," White said. 
"We've asked Tom to help us out on some briefings during the transition." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson also was reaching out to Democrats. Conspicuous at the formal opening 
Friday of his transition office in a high-rise looking down on the state 
Capitol was Bill Hauck, chief of staff for the late Democratic Assembly Speaker 
Bob Moretti. Hauck, a longtime Wilson friend, will be involved in policy 
development for the governor-elect, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
The governor-elect told reporters that his "highest priorities" before 
inauguration day "will be setting the direction of my Administration through 
major appointments and policy initiatives." 
</P>
<P>
"Most important of all will be fiscal policy," he said, announcing that budget 
briefings will begin next week. Wilson, however, also intends to return to 
Washington next week to begin closing down his Senate office. 
</P>
<P>
The governor-elect also must choose a successor for his Senate seat, someone 
who must stand for election in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, there also are the mundane, personal decisions, such as finding a 
place to live and redecorating offices. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's most populous state does not have a governor's mansion. It used 
to, a fine old gingerbread Victorian in downtown Sacramento. But Nancy Reagan 
considered it a firetrap and moved out shortly after her husband took office in 
1967. The governor's wealthy friends -- his so-called kitchen cabinet -- bought 
a large house for him to use. Meanwhile, Reagan had the state begin building a 
sprawling $1.5-million governor's mansion on a river bluff far outside of town. 
</P>
<P>
But the big mansion was not completed until Reagan left office. His successor, 
Edmund G. Brown, Jr., refused to live in it, preferring to sleep on a mattress 
on the floor of an old apartment house across the street from the Capitol. 
Deukmejian wanted to live in the mansion, but the Democratic-controlled 
Legislature ordered it sold. So the new Republican governor took a room in a 
Holiday Inn for a few weeks before moving into a modest apartment. Ultimately, 
as with Reagan, wealthy supporters bought a house for Deukmejian to use. 
</P>
<P>
During the transition, Wilson plans to rent a house in the Sierra foothills 
near Auburn, 30 miles east of Sacramento. He will move closer to the Capitol 
when he becomes governor. 
</P>
<P>
Once that happens, Wilson's working conditions should be a lot better than what 
Deukmejian found when he entered office eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor's office then was a disgrace," conceded B.T. Collins, Brown's 
chief of staff. "It was a safety hazard. The carpet was torn. Files were being 
stored in the shower." 
</P>
<P>
The shower had been installed by Reagan, but Brown blocked it off with an 
office refrigerator. Deukmejian reopened it, but replaced the tile personally 
chosen by Nancy Reagan, regarding it as "too commercial." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian found duct tape everywhere holding carpet together. Hard wooden 
benches dominated the reception lobby, installed there by Brown to discourage 
protesters from staying too long. Paint was peeling. So before his 
inauguration, Deukmejian ordered the first remodeling of the governor's office 
since the Reagan era. 
</P>
<P>
One morning, Brown walked in and realized what it was like to be a lame duck: A 
workman was standing at his desk sawing Venetian blinds for the governor-elect. 
"He just exploded," recalled Collins. "The governor was trying to make a phone 
call and there's this guy using a power saw at his desk." 
</P>
<P>
Two days before Deukmejian's inauguration, after all the offices had been 
remodeled and emptied, some of Brown's longtime supporters and aides decided to 
hold an impromptu New Year's Eve party in the refurbished quarters. They filled 
garbage barrels with champagne and ice and partied until 2 a.m., leaving one of 
the barrels in Collins' vacated office, which soon was to become Merksamer's. 
</P>
<P>
"The ice melted and leaked out of the can and completely soaked the floor and 
buckled the parquet underneath," said Jim Burton, who was Collins' deputy and 
the transition liaison. "I got back in there at 9:30 the next morning and Steve 
Merksamer had a very concerned look on his face. He seemed worried that after 
all the (remodeling) work, we had gone through and rioted in the offices." 
</P>
<P>
Filling the offices with the right people will be Wilson's biggest problem. 
Unlike Republican Deukmejian taking over from Democrat Brown, or Brown 
replacing Reagan, "this will be a friendly takeover and we'll be dealing with 
people who are our friends," said Kaye. 
</P>
<P>
Some friendships will be strained and feelings bruised because many people will 
be asked to leave. Wilson will want to place his own people in most key jobs, 
aides said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, it is bound to be smoother than past "hostile takeovers." 
</P>
<P>
"We had some bozos who said they weren't going to quit, that they wanted to be 
fired by Deukmejian," Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Franchetti, Deukmejian's first finance director, who ultimately was 
denied Senate confirmation, recalled how "on the first day Deukmejian was 
governor, we assumed all of the (Brown political appointees) would leave. But 
some stayed in their offices for days and days. We finally got a former cop and 
made him the enforcer. We said it's your job to ferret out these people and 
make them leave. Some stayed on until we threatened to move them out 
physically. A couple were still there seven years later." 
</P>
<P>
Merksamer described the considerations that go into a governor's decisions 
about appointments, which include a personal senior staff of about 10, a 
nine-member cabinet of agency secretaries and more than 50 department 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
"You're balancing all kinds of factors," he said. "Were (the applicants) 
helpful in the campaign, were they not helpful, to what extent do you broaden 
your (political) base, to what extent do you play to your base; there are 
ethnic considerations, gender considerations. . . . There's a problem finding 
people who are knowledgeable about state government. . . . You want people who 
are honest, straight shooters, who will not just tell you what you want to 
hear. People want jobs and they'll do a lot of things to get jobs. It's very, 
very tough, the hardest thing about a transition." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Deukmejian's election, Collins gave Merksamer this advice about 
filling key government positions: "Never underestimate the importance of 
loyalty. Get a signed, undated resignation from every appointee. And fire 
someone as soon as you can to show who's in charge." 
</P>
<P>
But just days after a triumphant election, "it's a very heady, exhilarating 
time," Merksamer noted. 
</P>
<P>
Everything is going well. And the governor-elect still is not responsible for 
state government. "But after you've reviewed your 600th resume and grappled 
with billions of dollars of budget items, it becomes sobering," Merksamer said.

INDEFINITE WAIT IN GULF IS OUT, BUSH AIDE SAYS 
</P>

The United States cannot afford to allow the conflict with Iraq to drag out 
indefinitely and is determined to bring it to a head, a senior Bush 
Administration official said Friday, explaining the President's decision to 
virtually double the size of the U.S. force in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
And an actual ultimatum to Iraq's Saddam Hussein could be the "next step" once 
all the new troops are in place by early January, said the official, who has 
been involved in every facet of Bush's plans for the gulf operation. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important to put some finite perspective" on the current standoff, the 
official said. "We're not prepared to give this guy unlimited time." With so 
much now at stake, he added, failure would be "pretty catastrophic." 
</P>
<P>
While some officials had suggested that war is likely, others in the 
Administration and in allied governments had stressed the possibility of an 
extended stalemate -- one lasting well into next year and perhaps longer -- 
during which the United States and its allies would wait to see if economic 
pressure would force Hussein to yield. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to send massive new American forces to the gulf marks a rejection 
of the latter strategy. The Administration, officials made clear, is now set 
inexorably on a path that will lead to war unless Hussein backs out. 
</P>
<P>
While economic sanctions have had some impact on Hussein, they have not reached 
"the point where he is seriously constrained," said the official, who spoke on 
condition that he not be named. "Waiting two, three years to starve him out is 
not a good idea," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is still not crystal-clear that Saddam Hussein is taking us seriously," the 
official said. "He's still playing games -- some of them with considerable 
skill -- to divide the coalition." 
</P>
<P>
And at least until Thursday's announcement of the expanded U.S. deployment, 
Hussein's apparent belief that "time is on his side" might have been 
"rational," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. force in the gulf, he noted, faces two major constraints. On the one 
side, Saudi Arabian officials cannot tolerate a huge U.S. presence in their 
country for as long as would be needed to "starve him out." On the other, U.S. 
commanders cannot afford to keep huge forces in the gulf for an extended 
period. 
</P>
<P>
"As weeks grow into months, you lose your edge, morale goes down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Outside analysts have expressed similar sentiments. "The United States will 
either have to go to war early next year or face extremely difficult 
decisions," said Marvin Feuerwerger of the Washington Institute for Near East 
Policy. "The United States will not be able to maintain 400,000 troops in the 
Persian Gulf region for long without drastic measures," such as resuming the 
draft, Feuerwerger said. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials essentially agree with that analysis. As a result, 
they deliberately have designed the second phase of the U.S. buildup to allow a 
military strike to be made quickly, before public support for Bush's policy 
begins to erode seriously. 
</P>
<P>
In Vietnam, the official added, the United States deployed troops without being 
able to say that "in the end, we're going to be able to wrap this up." This 
time, the Administration is determined to "make sure we can deliver whatever it 
is that is necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the official said, "no one" of the many foreign governments that 
have sent emissaries to Iraq "has come back with any sense that Saddam Hussein 
is wavering . . . that there is any hope." 
</P>
<P>
The decision to add more than 200,000 troops to the deployment was designed 
partly to get ready for war if Hussein refuses to withdraw from Kuwait and 
partly as a dramatic gesture "to affect (Hussein's) thought processes . . . to 
convince him that we are serious." 
</P>
<P>
The events leading up to the decision began weeks ago with the realization that 
Iraq had deployed far more troops in Kuwait than U.S. military officials 
initially had foreseen. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. planners originally had believed that an American force of about 230,000 
troops would be adequate both to defend Saudi Arabia and to invade occupied 
Kuwait, if necessary. But after the deployment began, Hussein started sending 
in reinforcements, eventually doubling his forces to an estimated 430,000 
troops on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"A force that is now adequate for defense, in late August was (believed to be) 
adequate for more than that," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have retained the option of expanding the American force even 
more if necessary, but they do not believe that Iraq is capable of further 
escalation. 
</P>
<P>
At the United Nations, meanwhile, the steering committee of the General 
Assembly rejected an attempt by Iraq to persuade the Assembly to debate the 
Administration's expanded military buildup in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Ten speakers objected to Iraq's bid, and the 29-member committee eventually 
approved without taking a vote on a motion by the Canadian ambassador to take 
no action on the request by Hussein's government. 
</P>
<P>
In lobbying to add the new item to the General Assembly's agenda, Iraq's 
delegate, Adnan Mohammed, charged that the Bush Administration "blew the horns 
of war" and "was leading the world toward a catastrophe." 
</P>
<P>
But Saudi Arabia's ambassador, Samir S. Shihabi, countered that Iraq's motion 
was an "immoral act" and a "distortion of the facts." 
</P>
<P>
His view was seconded by U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering, who called the 
Iraqi requests "so improper, so ill-founded, so mendacious and so tendentious 
that it is simply impossible to recommend that the General Assembly deal with 
them." 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks ahead, U.S. diplomats are expected to push for U.N. Security 
Council approval of a new resolution that would provide standby authority to 
use military force if Iraq's occupation of Kuwait continues. 
</P>
<P>
Bush consistently has maintained that the U.N. Charter's provisions for 
self-defense provide authority for U.S. forces to attack Iraq at the request of 
Kuwait's government. But the Administration believes that approval of a more 
explicit U.N. resolution would help solidify the international coalition 
against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Under the standard monthly rotation of the Security Council's chairmanship, the 
United States heads the council this month. On Dec. 1, however, it will turn 
over the chairmanship to Yemen, which has mildly supported Iraq. As a result, 
U.S. diplomats hope to complete action on a new resolution this month. 
</P>
<P>
The extent of support that American diplomats will be able to bring to an 
eventual vote is uncertain. Some Security Council members, including China, are 
cautious, preferring to give existing sanctions and private diplomacy a chance 
to work for several more months.

A federal commission has approved a revised design for the Korean War veterans' 
memorial, and ground breaking is scheduled for Veterans Day, 1991, a veterans' 
panel said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Russell, spokesman for the Korean War Veterans Memorial Advisory Board, 
said organizers hoped that construction could begin next year despite 
complaints by the original architects that their design has been altered. 
</P>
<P>
He said the National Capital Memorial Commission approved the design, including 
the revisions, during a hearing Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Four Pennsylvania State University architects won a contest to design the 
memorial across the Reflecting Pool from the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. It 
called for "a dreamlike" collection of 38 soldiers moving across a remote 
landscape toward an American flag.

ANTIBIOTIC FOUND EFFECTIVE AGAINST AIDS ILLNESS; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: INEXPENSIVE DRUG IS EASIER TO ADMINISTER THAN THE AEROSOL GENERALLY 
USED TO TREAT PARASITIC PNEUMONIA. IT ALSO SEEMS TO PREVENT RELAPSES.

<P>
A frequently prescribed antibiotic is proving more effective in preventing the 
most common life-threatening complication of AIDS than an aerosol medication 
that is both costly and cumbersome to administer, according to AIDS 
specialists. 
</P>
<P>
The antibiotic -- widely used to combat bacterial conditions such as ear and 
urinary tract infections -- can be taken in tablet form and is substantially 
cheaper than aerosol pentamidine, which must be delivered by a special device 
operated by a respiratory therapist. 
</P>
<P>
The finding is significant because it adds another drug to the treatments that 
can prolong the lives of individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency 
virus, which causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
AIDS experts emphasized, however, that formal studies comparing aerosol 
pentamidine to the antibiotic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole -- marketed under 
the brand names Bactrim and Septra -- are still under way. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, they said, their own clinical experience indicates that the 
antibiotic seems to work better in staving off the onset of parasitic 
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia among infected individuals whose immune systems 
show signs of damage, as well as subsequent episodes among those who have 
already suffered an initial bout of the pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
Patients on aerosol pentamidine, they said, are still experiencing recurrences 
of the infection, including a condition known as disseminated pneumocystis, in 
which the parasite attacks organs outside the lungs. This has not happened with 
the antibiotic, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people are moving much more rapidly toward the oral prophylaxis, both 
because of cost and convenience and also because of a growing perception that 
aerosol pentamidine isn't as good as we once thought," said Dr. Paul 
Volberding, professor of medicine at UC San Francisco and director of the AIDS 
division at San Francisco General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been quite a lot of talk about this," Volberding said. "Physicians 
working with AIDS patients are comparing notes about how they're treating 
different problems, and this has become a frequent topic of conversation." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a year ago, aerosol pentamidine was hailed as a major therapeutic 
breakthrough in the prevention of pneumocystis, a parasitic infection that 
often is the first manifestation of AIDS and is a frequent killer of AIDS 
patients. The infection, which usually strikes the lungs, is fatal if left 
untreated. 
</P>
<P>
Pentamidine and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are already approved as 
treatments for the pneumocystis infection. But studies completed earlier this 
year found that pentamidine delivered in an aerosol form was extremely 
effective in preventing its onset. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the findings were released, it became standard practice to recommend 
monthly treatments with aerosol pentamidine for HIV-infected individuals whose 
immune systems had begun to show signs of deterioration as measured by levels 
of T4 helper cells, the white blood cells that are a primary target of the AIDS 
virus. Infected individuals with low T4 counts are considered at extremely high 
risk of developing pneumocystis. 
</P>
<P>
It also became routine to use the aerosol drug to prevent further episodes in 
those who had already experienced their first bout of pneumocystis. 
</P>
<P>
But AIDS activists and others complained that the drug, manufactured by 
Fujisawa USA (formerly LyphoMed Inc.) of Rosemont, Ill., was too expensive. The 
price varies widely, but a monthly treatment generally costs at least $150. 
Also, the therapy requires the use of a pressure-driven nebulizer, a device 
that reduces a liquid to a fine spray, operated by a trained respiratory 
therapist. 
</P>
<P>
Even more important, researchers said, they began to notice that their patients 
were still suffering recurrences of pneumocystis, including those who were 
specifically trying to prevent a secondary episode. 
</P>
<P>
"In those patients, we saw a rate of relapse approaching 25%," said Dr. 
Margaret Fischel, a professor of medicine and AIDS specialist at the University 
of Miami. "We began to look for alternatives because, for a preventive agent, 
that is too high. It was very distressing." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, many doctors began giving their patients 
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and they have been extremely pleased with the 
results. 
</P>
<P>
"The relapse rate has been virtually zero," said Dr. Robert T. Schooley, an 
AIDS researcher who heads the infectious diseases division of the University of 
Colorado Health Sciences Center. "Unless there's a problem with 
(trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole), I'd use that first. If I were a patient with 
HIV infection, I'd certainly be asking my doctor about this." 
</P>
<P>
Researchers said that side effects of the antibiotic include allergic reactions 
-- such as severe rash -- and lower blood cell counts. However, researchers 
said that lower doses of the antibiotic can alleviate those problems in most 
cases and still achieve protection against pneumocystis. 
</P>
<P>
"We have found that you can . . . overcome the problems," Fischel said. "With 
lower doses, you can successfully treat everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Septra, which is manufactured by Burroughs Wellcome Co. of Research Triangle 
Park, N.C., and Bactrim, made by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. of Nutley, N. J., cost 
patients about $35 to $40 a month. A generic version of the drug typically 
costs less than $10 a month. 
</P>
<P>
The latest evidence also strengthens arguments for being tested for HIV 
infection, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole issue is important, because we can now predict the likelihood of 
pneumocystis even when somebody is asymptomatic," Volberding said. "When I see 
somebody whose first evidence of AIDS is that he's gotten pneumocystis, that's 
a failure. That's a failure on our part to get that person involved in 
(preventive) treatment."

GUATEMALA IN RIGHTS CRISIS ON EVE OF VOTE

GUATEMALA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most striking feature of Sunday's presidential election, only the second 
time Guatemalans will have gone to the polls under an elected government, is 
not differences between the parties, or vicious rhetoric from the candidates. 
It is the death count. In Guatemala, negative campaigning means killing 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Americas Watch, a New York-based human rights organization, says the election 
is being held while "the nation is in the grips of the worst human rights 
crisis since the military turned over government to civilians in 1986." 
</P>
<P>
Since July, when campaigning began in earnest, there have been at least 15 
political murders. The victims, all directly involved in the campaign, included 
nine candidates or party leaders, three journalists and two political 
activists. The Guatemalan Congressional Human Rights office lists another 421 
politically related deaths and disappearances so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
There have been no arrests, let alone convictions. Human rights groups blame 
military units or death squads tolerated by the government for most of the 
murders. But President Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo has dismissed some of the 
killings as "isolated" incidents with "origins in local issues," or has blamed 
them on Guatemala's tiny leftist guerrilla movement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'State Terrorism' 
</P>
<P>
It is rationalizations such as this, viewed as an attempt by the unpopular 
Cerezo to downplay the human rights violence that has marked his five-year 
administration, that provokes public scorn and fright. 
</P>
<P>
"We are returning to the dark past . . . when we lived amid virtual state 
terrorism," said Cesar Alvarez Guadamuz, assistant director of the 
Congressional Human Rights Office. 
</P>
<P>
At stake Sunday are the presidency, vice presidency, 116 congressional seats 
and 300 city halls. If, as expected, none of the 12 presidential candidates 
achieve a majority, a runoff between the top two finishers will be held Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
If there is no military revolt -- a risky assumption in a country that has held 
only three successful elections in its history -- the Jan. 13 inauguration will 
be the first time an elected president has turned over office to an elected 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Top Contenders 
</P>
<P>
Of the 12 presidential candidates, only four are important: conservative 
newspaper owner Jorge Carpio Nicolle of the National Centrist Union; right-wing 
businessman and former Guatemala City Mayor Alvaro Arzu of the National 
Advancement Party; one-time military supporter Jorge Serrano Elias of the 
Solidarity Action Movement, and Alfonso Cabrera Hidalgo of the Christian 
Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
Cabrera is Cerezo's handpicked candidate and a former foreign minister who is 
suspected by U.S. drug experts of involvement in the narcotics trade. 
</P>
<P>
The latest public opinion poll puts Carpio ahead with 29% of the vote, followed 
by Arzu with 22%, then Serrano with 21% and Cabrera with 14%. 
</P>
<P>
What that doesn't show is the popularity of the candidate who isn't there, Gen. 
Efrain Rios Montt. 
</P>
<P>
The one-time leader of a bloody coup, a military dictator and architect of "the 
Guatemalan solution" for cleansing the country of leftist rebels by killing 
thousands of presumed sympathizers, Rios Montt is the nation's most popular 
politician, according to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
However, he was taken off the ballot by Guatemala's courts because of a 
constitutional provision banning from the presidency anyone who had held power 
as the result of a coup. 
</P>
<P>
Rios Montt's attraction is based perversely on the bloodiness of his past. Some 
people are drawn by his call for an unrestrained law-and-order campaign against 
a surging crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
True to his belief that democracy resides only in his person -- "I am democracy 
here," he said in a recent interview -- Rios Montt has said the election is 
illegitimate and has called for his followers to nullify ballots by writing in 
his name. He has issued less than subtle hints that he might try to disrupt the 
voting violently. 
</P>
<P>
One poll showed that 18% of voters intend to either leave their ballots blank 
or deface them. As a measure of the support for Guatemala's infant democracy, 
this is alarming, particularly since it coincides with another poll indicating 
that half of the people prefer military rule, while only a third think 
democracy is the best system for the country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Almost No Differences' 
</P>
<P>
Among the presidential candidates left after Rios Montt's disqualification, 
there is little to choose from in policy or ideological terms -- "There are 
almost no differences among us," is the way Arzu put it -- and none has 
developed a strong personal following. 
</P>
<P>
Given the politicians' collective fear of the military, which forced Cerezo to 
cede much of his power to the armed forces after a series of coup attempts, and 
their shared right-wing economic views, there seems little chance of a change 
in the country's two most crushing problems -- human rights and one of the most 
unbalanced distributions of wealth in Latin America.

BUSH'S MOVES SPARK FEARS IN CONGRESS;

<P>
DEMOCRATS: LEADERS SHARE WORRIES THAT WAR MAY ERUPT DURING RECESS.

<P>
Members of Congress expressed serious concern Friday that President Bush's 
deployment of more than 200,000 additional troops in the Persian Gulf signifies 
a major change of strategy that could lead to war with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
With Bush himself and his top aides stressing that the United States may resort 
to a military attack if the Iraqis refuse to withdraw from Kuwait, members of 
Congress said they see the military buildup as a sign that the Administration 
is losing patience with economic sanctions and is preparing for offensive 
action. 
</P>
<P>
So many Democratic members of Congress have begun raising questions about 
Bush's policy that House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) has planned a 
meeting in Washington next week to discuss the matter. He plans to return to 
the Capitol today from his home in Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
Foley said a date has not been set for the meeting, but presumably it will take 
place before Wednesday, when Bush is to confer with congressional leaders on 
the Persian Gulf situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're going to continue seeing more questions raised about this 
matter," Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic congressional leaders, who left Washington last week worried that 
war might erupt while Congress is in recess, made it clear that the new 
deployment has increased their fears. They urged Bush to consult more with 
Congress and to spell out his gulf policy more extensively to the American 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Foley, though not declaring himself opposed to Bush's course, stressed that his 
support for the President's decision to send troops to the area in August "has 
been based on defensive operations -- and it still is." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. William S. Broomfield (R-Mich.), ranking minority member of the House 
Foreign Affairs Committee, called the sending of a much larger force "a major 
change" in policy and said Bush should have consulted with lawmakers more to 
assure full congressional backing. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole question is one of putting more pressure on (Iraqi President) Saddam 
Hussein," Broomfield said. "But if you want the broadest support, Congress has 
got to be in on the takeoff as well as the landing." 
</P>
<P>
Broomfield said Bush's failure to keep Congress better informed could undermine 
his gulf policy and pointed out that he and committee Chairman Dante B. Fascell 
(D-Fla.) asked Bush in an Oct. 26 letter to consult with Congress on any 
additional deployment of forces or any change in military mission. 
</P>
<P>
Fascell said it is unlikely that Saddam Hussein can be "bluffed out" of Kuwait 
and "this means that we cannot keep increasing our forces in Operation Desert 
Shield unless we are ready, willing and able to use them in an offensive 
operation." 
</P>
<P>
A congressional source said that when Foley met with Bush two weeks ago to 
discuss the Persian Gulf crisis, he emphasized that, while Democrats backed his 
policy, the President could not necessarily count on the party's support if the 
United States launches an attack on Iraq without clear provocation. In a 
telephone interview, Foley declined to confirm or deny that account. 
</P>
<P>
Several Democratic members, speaking on condition that they not be identified, 
explained that members of Congress who have questions about Bush's policy find 
themselves in an awkward position because challenging Bush's move publicly 
might relieve some of the pressure on Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to give comfort to Saddam Hussein," one member said. "But some 
members would like to see this policy more fully debated in public." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), the House majority leader, said: "Democrats 
have supported the President's policy and continue to do that, but what is 
needed is greater consultation with Congress and discussions with the American 
people so that, if the policy or underlying strategy is changing, people will 
understand that." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), describing the American people's support for 
Bush's policy as broad but "very thin," said, "There's a great deal of 
uneasiness about all of this. They do not want American casualties. They feel 
that very, very strongly."

HEPATITIS DRUG SHORTAGE INTENSIFIES; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: MILITARY NEEDS, STOCKPILING CUT INTO ALREADY THIN COMMERCIAL 
SUPPLIES. NEW DEPLOYMENT ADDS TO THE PRESSURE.

U.S. health officials voiced concern Friday that the massive deployment of 
troops to the Persian Gulf will sharply worsen a nationwide shortage of 
hepatitis-fighting gamma globulin in doctor's offices, hospitals and public 
health clinics. 
</P>
<P>
The shortage, which began last summer amid a hepatitis epidemic, intensified 
after the Pentagon required that troops dispatched to the Middle East be 
inoculated against possible exposure to the infectious disease. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, large quantities of the antibody-rich blood serum extract have had 
to be stockpiled in the event war breaks out in the Persian Gulf and the gamma 
globulin is needed to treat casualties. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, states were able to alleviate the commercial shortage of gamma 
globulin by sharing supplies, even though one of two major manufacturers 
suddenly abandoned the market. 
</P>
<P>
But new alarms went off after President Bush announced Thursday that more than 
200,000 additional American troops will be sent to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a sense now that we may have an absolute shortage" of gamma globulin 
that cannot be cured by shifting supplies around, said Dr. Harold Margolis, 
chief of the hepatitis branch at the federal Centers for Disease Control in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the California Department of Health Services sent a memo to 
counterparts in other states last month, warning of a growing shortage. Noting 
that "no national guidelines have yet been issued on this matter," the 
California officials suggested that local health departments plan to reserve 
gamma globulin for "high-priority uses." 
</P>
<P>
Such high priorities include people recently exposed to hepatitis-A; pregnant 
women and children under 2 years old recently exposed to measles, and people 
going on business to high-risk hepatitis areas abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Those traveling on pleasure or vacation should be referred to private doctors 
"to try to get" gamma globulin shots, said the memo, signed by Drs. George W. 
Rutherford and Loring Dales, heads of the department's infectious disease and 
immunization units. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills physician Elsie Giorgi, who every week inoculates six to 10 
patients headed for trips abroad, protested that gamma globulin prices had shot 
up from $10 per two-dose vial to more than $30. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Giorgi also expressed the belief that people who need 
the drug to battle life-threatening immune deficiencies are especially 
jeopardized by the shortage. 
</P>
<P>
But Charles Darwall of San Francisco, a former patient of Giorgi with such a 
condition, said he had determined that intravenous gamma globulin, which he and 
a small number of others like him rely on, is not in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the shortage affects intramuscular gamma globulin, a more frequently 
used type of serum that is injected into muscles to ward off hepatitis and 
other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials said that public health authorities in Georgia, Wisconsin, 
New York and other states are concerned about the possibility of dwindling 
supplies and rising prices amid recent hepatitis outbreaks. 
</P>
<P>
Alluding to the jump in gasoline prices that followed the deployment of troops 
to the Persian Gulf, New York state epidemiologist Stan Kondracki said that 
reports of increasing gamma globulin prices "sounds like the gas situation and 
it bothers me. If there is only one company supplying most of the stuff, there 
is no cost competition." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Armour Pharmaceutical Corp. of Fort Washington, Pa., which 
manufactures nearly all gamma globulin used in the United States, declined to 
discuss prices. But she said the firm has begun an around-the-clock, fourfold 
increase in production to deal with sharply escalating military demands and the 
deepening commercial shortage. 
</P>
<P>
"Our supply to the commercial sector has diminished by about 55%," said the 
spokeswoman, Jane Green. "About 85% to 90% of our supply is going to the 
military now." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Pentagon agency that is buying the drug from Armour said 
the price has stayed at $2.32 per vial. One vial provides two soldiers immunity 
from hepatitis for about six months. 
</P>
<P>
As of the end of October, the Pentagon's Defense Personnel Support Center in 
Philadelphia had ordered 389,686 vials for Operation Desert Shield, said Terri 
White. And on Friday, officials were scurrying to order more. 
</P>
<P>
When the gulf crisis began in early August, the Pentagon put out an urgent call 
for 10,000 vials of gamma globulin. Within three days, the National Wholesale 
Druggists Assn. had rounded up all the stockpiles of its members. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department "was unable to locate any of the drug in its own 
warehouses and had already acquired modest amounts from the two domestic 
manufacturers," according to a press release issued by the trade group. "The 
drug companies were making more, but it would take up to two weeks to resupply" 
the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
"Within 24 hours, more than 98% of NWDA's members located in excess of 23,000 
multi-dose vials in their inventories and reported that at least 3,000 more 
vials had already been bought by local military bases," the release said.

12 PUNISHED FOR VIOLATING LIQUOR RULES; 
</P>
<P>
CULTURE: THE MOVE REFLECTS A U.S. DESIRE TO AVOID INSULTING SAUDIS.

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stringently enforcing a no-booze policy, military authorities have imposed 
heavy fines on 12 American servicemen and are considering more severe action 
against a dozen others found drunk or in possession of alcohol in this legally 
dry kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
The actions under military law make clear the determination of American 
commanders to enforce round-the-clock abstinence from alcohol -- unprecedented 
in a U.S. combat theater -- even though it is a source of friction with troops, 
according to U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Americans reprimanded and ordered to forfeit "substantial" wages were 
an Air Force major and a captain, the officials said. Both were held in 
violation of General Order No. 1, the stern teetotaling order issued at the 
outset of the U.S. buildup here. 
</P>
<P>
Although alcohol is officially prohibited in Saudi Arabia, it is by no means 
unknown. Saudi authorities have long turned a blind eye to Western residents' 
home-based manufacture of beer, wine and distilled liquor for personal 
consumption. 
</P>
<P>
But in barring alcohol even from closed U.S. military compounds, the American 
commander here, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, decided that the United States 
should adopt a strict prohibition in deference to Saudi sensitivities, 
according to officials familiar with his thinking. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said Schwarzkopf regards the prohibition and other strict curbs 
on soldiers' conduct as the kind of test that the U.S. military may face with 
increasing frequency as its focus shifts from Europe to the Middle East and the 
Third World. 
</P>
<P>
The no-drinking rule has prompted vocal discontent among soldiers, many of whom 
have told visitors that their desert duty would be far more tolerable if they 
were permitted an occasional drink, as were GIs in World War II, Korea and 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"How long can the Army expect a soldier to last without his beer?" an infantry 
lieutenant complained in an interview last week. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure of the disciplinary actions, however, marks the first indication 
that American soldiers had been found in violation of the ban. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the U.S. Central Command confirmed this week that "disciplinary 
action" had been taken against 12 servicemen for violation of the alcohol 
prohibition. In all cases, he said, penalties were imposed through a procedure 
for non-judicial punishment that stops short of a formal court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
Such punishment can include forfeiture of pay, formal reprimands, extra duty 
and, for enlisted men, reduction in rank. The spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. David Knox, 
declined to specify what action had been taken. 
</P>
<P>
Other informed U.S. sources, however, said the penalties included heavy 
forfeitures of pay for officers and the loss of rank for at least one enlisted 
man. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the soldiers who violated the rule apparently were seeking to 
manufacture moonshine for their own use, the sources said. Others apparently 
smuggled alcohol into the country through the mail or military planes, or were 
able to buy liquor in local markets. 
</P>
<P>
One knowledgeable American official said that the stocks of bootleg alcohol 
available in northern Saudi Arabia have swollen in recent weeks as Iraqi 
soldiers, in clandestine visits to Saudi outposts, offer alcohol in trade for 
food and other supplies. A Saudi official, however, said he heard no such 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Command's General Order No. 1 specifically "prohibits the 
introduction, possession, use, sale, transfer, manufacture or consumption of 
any alcoholic beverage" by military personnel and civilians serving with U.S. 
armed forces in Operation Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
It provides an exemption, however, for thousands of American servicemen 
deployed to bases in the region outside Saudi Arabia, where local law permits 
alcohol to be consumed.

CALIFORNIA COUPLE, ONE OTHER AMERICAN AMONG 174 RELEASED HOSTAGES

Iraq sent home 174 Western hostages Friday, including a California couple and a 
10-year-old "human shield" who had promised to trade his allowance for his 
family's freedom. 
</P>
<P>
A third American who had been shot trying to escape the Iraqis also was 
released, but at least two other Americans who had been promised exit papers 
were prevented from boarding the special Lufthansa Airbus from Baghdad at the 
last minute, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Former Chancellor Willy Brandt brought the mostly German group out of Iraq 
after meeting twice with President Saddam Hussein on a sharply criticized 
private mission to Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his Ostpolitik rapprochement with what 
was then the East Bloc, went to Iraq on Monday in defiance of Western 
agreements to deal with the situation as an alliance. 
</P>
<P>
"This policy of all or nothing is disastrous," said Brandt, who had hoped to 
bring all 400 German hostages home. 
</P>
<P>
Washington has sought to maintain a united front within the international 
coalition lined up against Iraq, but some foreign individuals such as Japan's 
former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone have persuaded Hussein to release 
selected groups of their countrymen. And political figures from Denmark and New 
Zealand are planning similar trips to Baghdad to seek freedom for hostages. 
</P>
<P>
The former hostages appeared weary but in good health Friday as they greeted 
tearful relatives in a hangar at Frankfurt International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The wounded American, Miles Hoffman, a 33-year-old financial analyst from 
Georgia, was quickly taken off the plane and taken to the U.S. Air Force 
hospital in nearby Wiesbaden. Hoffman, who had been working for the Kuwaiti 
government when Iraqi troops invaded in August, was shot in the forearm the 
following month as he apparently tried to escape through a window when Iraqi 
soldiers entered his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
When he boarded the aircraft in Baghdad earlier in the day, Hoffman had his arm 
in a cast and seemed to be in pain, the Associated Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
The returning hostages included 120 Germans, 20 Italians, 12 British, 10 Dutch, 
three Belgians, the three Americans and a scattering of people of other 
nationalities. 
</P>
<P>
"Were we worried? We were worried for 100 days," said Don Swanke, 66, of 
Westlake Village, who was released along with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"Worried, but not afraid," said Brenda Swanke, 43. 
</P>
<P>
"She's strong," her husband laughed. "I'm the chicken." 
</P>
<P>
The Swankes were taken to the U.S. military hospital for checkups before making 
plans to fly home to their four children and several grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Swanke said he was suffering from a viral infection and had lost about 10 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The couple were held prisoner with 13 others at a missile assembly plant in 
Mosul, about 250 miles north of Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
They said Brandt personally intervened to secure their release when the Iraqis 
refused to return the Swankes' passports the night before the flight from 
Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
They said at least two other Americans who had been promised their freedom were 
held back at the last minute when the Iraqis declared that their papers were 
not in order. 
</P>
<P>
The Swankes identified one of the disappointed hostages as Desmond Bailey of 
Houston and the other as a man they knew only as "Sam." 
</P>
<P>
Also used as a "human shield" was 10-year-old Karim Gorschlueter, whose 
poignant letter to Hussein apparently won his family's release. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that's what did it," said Ewald Gorschlueter, Karim's father, a 
German businessman who had lived in Iraq for 17 years with his Syrian-born 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
He said Karim received a lot of publicity and sympathy in the state media after 
writing to the Iraqi leader a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
The boy promised that if his family were freed, he would spend his entire 
allowance on food to send back to Iraqi children. 
</P>
<P>
His father said the family of four was held at an industrial site 85 miles 
southeast of Baghdad, the capital.

BUSH VETOES ORPHAN-DRUG PROFIT CURBS;

<P>
President Bush Friday vetoed legislation intended to prevent drug manufacturers 
from realizing unintended windfall profits from drugs developed under a law 
designed to stimulate research into therapies for rare disorders. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, approved unanimously by both houses of Congress, would have 
amended the 1983 Orphan Drug Act, which gives companies exclusive marketing 
rights and tax incentives to develop drugs for diseases that afflict fewer than 
200,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, some manufacturers have reaped enormous profits from certain 
drugs, including a widely used AIDS therapy, that had received orphan drug 
status but later proved valuable for treating much larger groups of patients. 
Critics have charged that some firms have abused the provisions of the law by 
keeping the price of the drugs artificially high. 
</P>
<P>
The amendments would have ended the special status when the number of people 
who need the drug exceeds 200,000. Also, the bill contained market-sharing 
provisions that would have applied if more than one company wanted to make the 
same drug within the same year. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Bush said he had "serious concerns" that the amendments would 
have removed incentives for drug companies to develop new drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe we must not endanger the success of this program, which is due in 
large measure to the existence of the 'market exclusivity' provision in the 
Orphan Drug Act that allows companies to have exclusive marketing rights to an 
orphan drug for seven years," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
"The certainty of this seven-year period is the basis of the economic incentive 
to attract drug firms to invest in orphan drugs," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that he was aware of the intent of the amendments but remained 
"extremely concerned . . . that individuals with rare disease may suffer 
because of changes that this bill would make in the incentives to develop new 
drug treatments." 
</P>
<P>
The bill's principal author, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), said that 
Bush's refusal to sign the legislation was a "shoddy" way for the 
Administration to handle the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"The Orphan Drug Act was never envisioned to give a monopoly to a . . . 
manufacturer of a profitable drug so he could charge a higher price, which the 
consumer would have to pay or go without the drug," Waxman said. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman dismissed as "foolishness" the explanation offered by Bush for vetoing 
the legislation. "It sounds like he's either unable to get beyond some 
ideological position or that some drug company that stands to gain has gotten 
his ear," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Abbey Meyers, executive director of the National Organization for Rare 
Disorders, said the veto was announced without warning. 
</P>
<P>
"We're devastated, just devastated," she said. "We were told the President 
didn't like it but would hold his nose and sign it. He's got it all wrong. He 
doesn't understand the legislation. The true orphan drugs are drugs of little 
commercial value. The incentives were a way to entice companies to make them. 
The bill was not written for the blockbusters. The amendments were designed to 
correct the abuses." 
</P>
<P>
The President's decision was also criticized by Mary Ann Wilson, administrative 
director of Neurofibromatosis Inc., an organization representing individuals 
suffering from the rare disease, which is characterized by the growth of 
numerous tumors. 
</P>
<P>
"These amendments (would have) helped to improve the act. It would have 
provided some competition among companies in order to keep the price down," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the original legislation, orphan drug designation has been applied to 
more than 300 therapies, of which nearly four dozen have reached the market. 
</P>
<P>
However, there has been an unforeseen increase in the number of patients 
benefiting from several of these drugs, including aerosol pentamidine for the 
treatment of AIDS-related pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. The drug is made by 
Fujisawa USA of Rosemont, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Two other examples are erythropoietin, a drug made by Amgen Inc. and used to 
supply oxygen to the blood of kidney patients with anemia, and a human growth 
hormone, made by Genentech Inc. and Eli Lilly &amp; Co., which share the rights 
to two slightly different versions. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers vowed that an effort to resurrect the legislation would be made when the 
new Congress convenes in January. "We're going to come back stronger than 
ever," she said. "We have to come back and work very hard to get this thing 
through next year."

President Bush signed legislation Friday requiring colleges and universities to 
make public their graduation rates, campus security procedures and campus crime 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation applies to any institution participating in federal student aid 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
The institutions will have to certify to the Education Department that they 
have campus security policies and will have to distribute to students, 
prospective students and employees an annual report of crime statistics. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also requires that the colleges provide students and prospective 
students with graduation rates. 
</P>
<P>
As of July, 1993, the institutions must report to the education secretary on 
the numbers and graduation rates of students who receive athletic-related 
student aid. That information must be broken down by race, sex and sport. They 
also must provide this information to potential athletes, their parents, 
guidance counselors and coaches.

SOUTH AFRICAN CHURCHES LABEL APARTHEID A SIN 
</P>

<P>
Black and white leaders of 90 of South Africa's Christian churches, concluding 
their first conference in nearly 30 years, joined Friday to reject apartheid as 
a sin and confess their own role in fostering segregation. 
</P>
<P>
The action was largely a symbolic gesture because each of the participating 
denominations, including the Dutch Reformed Church, has made similar statements 
individually in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The white branch of the Dutch Reformed Church, whose 1.5 million members 
represent nearly 40% of all white South Africans, for years played an important 
role in justifying the ruling National Party's racial segregation policies. 
</P>
<P>
But, in a historic declaration in 1986, it acknowledged that apartheid is a 
mistake and that racism is a sin. 
</P>
<P>
The final communique from the weeklong church conference in Rustenburg, 
northwest of Johannesburg, also recommended that the government remove all 
apartheid laws, establish a transitional government, return land taken from 
blacks and arrange an affirmative action program for blacks. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Pieter Potgieter, leader of the Dutch Reformed Church delegation, said 
his church accepted "the great majority of the very lovely sentiments" in the 
final communique. But he added that his group could not endorse the political 
recommendations, some of which the government strongly opposes, without 
consulting church members. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not for us to prescribe particular solutions to the government or 
anybody else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Dutch Reformed Church is the largest Afrikaner church, President 
Frederik W. de Klerk and several key members of his Cabinet belong to a much 
smaller and more politically liberal Afrikaner denomination, the Reformed 
Church. That denomination formally declared apartheid a sin 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police said Friday that 17 people have been killed in a fresh spasm 
of political violence among black factions in South African townships, 16 of 
them Thursday night in a battle in Natal province between supporters of Nelson 
Mandela's African National Congress and backers of the Zulu-based Inkatha 
Freedom Party.

Spending cuts, the sale of city assets and $125 million in new taxes are needed 
to avoid a virtual shutdown of city government and to raise its low bond 
rating, state and local Democratic leaders said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The plan announced by Mayor W. Wilson Goode and other officials also would set 
up an independent control board whose authority would be triggered if the city 
failed to balance future budgets. 
</P>
<P>
No City Council members or Republicans joined in the announcement, which left 
many details sketchy. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats urged a three-pronged attack: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The city would issue $250 million to $300 million in temporary loan notes 
with backing from Merrill Lynch, local banks, the state treasury and the city's 
pension fund. The money would allow the city to continue operating. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It would eliminate a $229-million deficit, expected by July 1, by raising 
$140 million through deficit financing bonds and $90 million by selling 
city-owned assets, which were not specified. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The city's budget would erase a projected $279-million deficit for fiscal 
1992 through new taxes, higher state and federal aid.

Investigators have found no evidence of mechanical malfunctioning preceding the 
collision of two freight trains this week that killed four and injured two 
others, railroad and federal officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Tests of the locomotives, the rail tracks and the elevated signals that warn 
railway workers of oncoming trains have indicated that the equipment functioned 
properly -- apparently raising the possibility that Wednesday's crash was 
caused by human error.

Voter rejection on Tuesday of a $450-million higher education construction bond 
measure means students will be squeezed into existing colleges and universities 
and planned new campuses probably will be delayed, officials of all three 
segments of California higher education said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"This puts a dark cloud over a year of planning and leaves many necessary 
projects in jeopardy," said Ellis McCune, chancellor of the 20-campus 
California State University system. "It is a tragedy for higher education." 
</P>
<P>
Pressing needs for construction on existing campuses must be deferred, and it 
may not be possible to open the new San Marcos campus in northern San Diego 
County in the fall of 1992 as planned, McCune added. In addition, plans for 
off-campus centers in Contra Costa and Ventura counties will be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
"We've just got to face up to the reality that we might not be able to grow," 
said William B. Baker, vice president for budget and university relations at 
the University of California. 
</P>
<P>
UC plans considerable expansion at its Davis, Riverside, San Diego and Santa 
Cruz campuses, as well as a new San Joaquin Valley campus. But Baker said the 
failure of Proposition 143 "gives us cause for concern . . . that we're going 
to have enough revenue to even stay where we are," much less open a 10th 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
The higher education proposal was defeated 51.3% to 48.7%, the first time a 
college and university bond issue has failed since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
It failed throughout the San Joaquin Valley, even though UC is planning to open 
its first campus in that part of the state by the end of this decade. The 
proposition also lost heavily in Riverside County, where there has been a UC 
campus for many years. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, meeting Friday in 
Salinas, established a new Commission for Innovation to study possible 
alternative ways to provide instruction without building new facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The new commission will study the possibility of offering community college 
courses through telecommunications to students at home and in the workplace, 
said Ann Reed, spokeswoman for the 107-campus two-year college system. "It 
can't be business as usual," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
Although higher education officials were generally dismayed by Tuesday's 
result, they saw a few silver linings among the clouds. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't think this was an anti-higher education vote," like 1968, said 
William L. Storey, an assistant director of the California Postsecondary 
Education Commission. "People (this year) were concerned about the economy and 
war in the Middle East. In times like these, people tend to be cautious about 
spending money." 
</P>
<P>
"If this is just a one-year aberration, it's not too significant," UC's Baker 
said, "but if this turns out to be the beginning of a three-, four- or 
five-year dry well on capital spending, then we've got real trouble." 
</P>
<P>
If UC cannot expand on existing campuses, especially at Davis and Riverside, 
"that certainly will slow down plans for a 10th campus," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
The current timetable calls for the UC Board of Regents to narrow the choices 
for a new campus in the Fresno area to two or three sites next March and to 
make a final decision a year later. 
</P>
<P>
CSU Chancellor McCune said the priority list will be adjusted to give 
preference to projects that increase student capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Coming on top of a $100-million cut in the CSU operating budget, these 
construction cuts make this "the worst year yet and next year looks like it 
could be even worse," McCune added. 
</P>
<P>
The bond issue failure compounds a serious overcrowding problem at many 
community colleges throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
A study completed last September found that 28 new campus sites would be needed 
in the next 14 years to accommodate expected enrollment.

GOLDBERG WON'T SEEK REELECTION TO SCHOOL BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jackie Goldberg, the outspoken, liberal activist who has presided over the Los 
Angeles Board of Education during a pivotal period, will not seek a third term 
on the board this spring, deciding instead to resume her career as a high 
school teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg, 45, will announce her decision at a news conference Monday. She also 
is expected to endorse her longtime friend and former staff member, teacher 
Jeff Horton, to succeed her in the 3rd District, which includes Hollywood, 
downtown Los Angeles and the mid-Wilshire area. 
</P>
<P>
Although her announcement will come just days after the board was forced to 
table its bid for a pay raise, Goldberg said she had decided not to run before 
the board voted to seek the state's permission to increase its $24,000 annual 
compensation. She had told a few people of her decision several weeks ago but 
said she wanted to wait until after last week's elections to make it public. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Goldberg said she has been increasingly frustrated with many aspects 
of the school board job -- the slow pace of progress, the loss of privacy that 
comes with public office, the "overwhelming negativity" of public attitudes 
toward the schools, the seven-day workweeks and the need to spend time and 
energy on tangential -- though important -- issues. 
</P>
<P>
"So much of it is about housing and buses and so little of it is about reading 
and math and learning,"' Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, she said much has been achieved during her 7 1/2 years on the 
board. She cited the development of an AIDS education program; the founding of 
Project 10, a support group for gay students; establishment of health clinics 
at some schools; formulation of a plan for teaching students not yet fluent in 
English, and the raising of teachers' salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Elected in 1983 with the backing of a coalition of teachers and community 
activists, Goldberg headed the board for nearly 18 months during a watershed 
period in the embattled school district. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of a record budget squeeze and explosive growth in the nation's 
second-largest school district, the seven-member board changed superintendents 
and adopted a highly controversial plan to relieve overcrowding by operating 
all of its more than 600 schools year-round. It embarked on a potentially 
far-reaching program of cutting its central bureaucracy and shifting more money 
and authority to the schools, where decisions are to be shared among 
principals, teachers, parents and other community members. 
</P>
<P>
Before running for her school board seat, Goldberg taught high school history 
in Compton and worked with the Integration Project, an organization pushing to 
desegregate Los Angeles schools during the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
When first on the board, many of her proposals -- and sometimes-strident 
methods of pushing them -- angered other board members. Some called her 
"devious" and "manipulative." But most of her current colleagues -- who have 
elected her president two years in a row -- say she has helped provide badly 
needed leadership and cohesiveness. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that she may run for another office some day, Goldberg said 
her primary reason for leaving the board is to get back to teaching -- 
something she has often said she would do. Her first choice is one of the 
district's inner-city high schools. 
</P>
<P>
Horton, 43, has taught high school in the district for about 15 years. After a 
one-year leave of absence last year to work as Goldberg's district 
representative, he began working in the district's special high school program 
for young mothers. If elected, he would be required to resign from his district 
teaching job and from the United Teachers-Los Angeles union, in which he is 
active. 
</P>
<P>
He said increasing parent and community involvement in the schools as a way to 
improve student achievement would be a top priority for him. 
</P>
<P>
"Because we have such a racially and ethnically diverse population and because 
the teaching force is still mostly white and middle class, lots more attention 
has to be paid to group relations," Horton said. "We need a multicultural 
approach to everything, and we can break some of the barriers (to success in 
school) only by doing a better job of involving all our parents and others in 
the community."

POST-MEDFLY REPORT: L.A. STILL BATTLING INSECTS; 
</P>
<P>
AGRICULTURE: A HOST OF EXOTIC, DESTRUCTIVE SPECIES HAVE MADE THEIR HOME IN THE 
COUNTY. AN INVITING CLIMATE AND LACK OF INSPECTORS FOR INTERNATIONAL TRAVELERS 
AND CARGO ARE BLAMED.

<P>
While agricultural officials have been consumed for the last 16 months with 
eradicating the Mediterranean fruit fly, a host of other exotic pests -- some 
as big a threat to agriculture as the Medfly -- have quietly invaded Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
With little fanfare, at least four other crop-destroying fruit flies from 
around the world have been discovered in Los Angeles: the Mexican fruit fly, 
the Oriental fruit fly, the melon fly from Asia and even the rare and notorious 
Indian peach fly. 
</P>
<P>
Around Los Angeles International Airport, county agricultural inspectors 
reported finding a record number of Japanese beetles, which attack about 275 
different species of plants. Thirteen of the Asian insects have been found 
since the beginning of the year -- as many as in the five previous years 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
Ash whiteflies, three gypsy moths and scads of eugenia psyllids, an Australian 
bug that has probably caused more crop damage locally than any other bug since 
its introduction two years ago, can also be added to the list. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has become the unofficial exotic insect and quarantine capital of 
the nation. The only area more infested is Hawaii, where the insects invaded 
decades ago -- and established themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Out of California's list of 10 most unwanted insects, six were found in Los 
Angeles County this year -- the Medfly, Mexfly, Oriental fruit fly, melon fly, 
Japanese beetle and gypsy moth. The invasions have gotten so bad that for a 
brief time this summer, part of Compton and Lynwood had three insect 
infestations going on at the same time -- Medfly, Mexfly and Oriental fruit 
fly. 
</P>
<P>
At least 400 different types of banned pests were found at the airport and Los 
Angeles and Long Beach harbors -- more than any other city in the nation. 
Agricultural officials figure they got about a quarter of what actually made it 
in. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a product of our globe-trotting ways," said UC Riverside 
entomologist Robert Luck. "In the long haul, we're going to have a lot of 
interesting insect problems to come." 
</P>
<P>
The blame, agricultural officials say, lies partly with Los Angeles' 
Mediterranean climate, where everything from tropical mangoes to desert cacti 
grow with abandon. Not only can an insect find a smorgasbord of delights to 
munch on, but also a lack of natural predators to keep their populations in 
check. 
</P>
<P>
"For an insect, this is like Eden," said Robert Atkins, deputy agricultural 
commissioner for Los Angeles County in charge of pest prevention. 
</P>
<P>
But the major problem is the enormous amount of international traffic into Los 
Angeles and the inability to screen out the waves of unwanted pests with just a 
few agricultural inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
James S. Eddy, the officer in charge of pest exclusion in Los Angeles for the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture, said 41 inspectors and two fruit-sniffing dogs 
handle close to 5 million international passengers a year and all packages to 
the post office, as well as cargo at the airport and the ports of Long Beach 
and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a feeling we're bailing with a tea cup when it's coming in by the 
gallon," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eddy, a burly 30-year veteran of the bug wars, said the inspection of cargo and 
passengers has deteriorated so badly over the years that only about 2% of all 
luggage is now opened and checked. A package is rarely opened unless it is 
marked as containing agricultural products or "it's oozing fruit juice." 
</P>
<P>
"To stop every person who wants to sneak a litchi to grandma, there's no way in 
hell," he said. "It's just like if you want to bring in a pocketful of 
cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
The number of arriving international passengers at the airport has increased 
dramatically from 712,000 in 1970, but Eddy said his staff is still the same 
size. 
</P>
<P>
"I come to work every day hoping the phone will ring and someone will tell me 
that they've approved 40 more people for me," he said. "It's going downhill." 
</P>
<P>
The number and frequency of exotic pest outbreaks throughout the county has 
paralleled Los Angeles' rise into becoming a major hub of the Pacific Rim. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of exotic fruit flies has been discovered in Los Angeles only 
in the last 15 years. The Medfly made its first appearance in the state in 
Santa Monica in 1975. The peach fly, Queensland fruit fly, African pumpkin fly, 
guava fruit fly and even one fly that scientists have never quite been able to 
identify have all been trapped for the first time in just the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Agricultural Commissioner E. Leon Spaugy said when he began 
his career as a state inspector in 1956, the discovery of a single melon fly 
near UCLA touched off a near panic. It has now been found in the county five of 
the last six years, including the latest trapping last month near the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the infestations have reached epidemic proportions yet, but it 
certainly has become routine to find these bugs," he said. "The only thing to 
our credit is that we have been able to put out the fire, but I'm not sure how 
much longer we will be able to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Some scientists, such as UC Davis entomologist James R. Carey, argue the state 
already has failed to stop some pests, such as the Medfly and the Oriental 
fruit fly, which he believes have become established in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Once established, the insects are extremely difficult to root out. Consider the 
case of two tiny pests that invaded Los Angeles and have not only gained a 
beachhead, but appear to have won the war. 
</P>
<P>
The most damaging of the two, the eugenia psyllid from Australia, stormed into 
Los Angeles two years ago through some unknown pathway. 
</P>
<P>
While more than $40 million was poured into the eradication of the Medfly, the 
state spent nothing to control the eugenia psyllid, which has now wiped out the 
eugenia shrub market. The pest attacks the leaves of the eugenia shrub, leaving 
clumps of tiny boils all over the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Owen Shiozaki, a manager at the White Flower Nursery in Gardena, used to sell 
about $40,000 worth of the shrub each year. Now, he doesn't even bother with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all over," he said. "We quit growing them this year. No one wants to buy 
a scraggly looking plant." 
</P>
<P>
The eugenia psyllid has spread beyond Southern California and is now infesting 
the northern half of the state. 
</P>
<P>
"The market has essentially died," said Glenn Tachibana of Pacific Nursery in 
Gardena. "Some are hoping we'll see it come back, but basically it's dropped 
off to nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the millions spent to eradicate the Medfly, the pest is not the hardest 
to wipe out. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese beetle is notoriously difficult to destroy. This year, a record 
number were found near the airport, although the numbers were still too small 
to warrant an eradication campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural Commissioner Spaugy said if an active breeding population is 
eventually found, the county would be in for at least a three-year battle of 
intensive ground pesticide spraying. He said the most effective pesticide 
against the bug has been banned for years, forcing the eradicators to rely on 
weaker and less thorough pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to go door to door, back yard to back yard," Spaugy said. "It's 
really, really hard work." 
</P>
<P>
The eradication effort against other pests has been just as annoying as the 
weekly flights of malathion-bearing helicopters that infuriated Southern 
Californians this year. 
</P>
<P>
About three months ago, Linda Russo of Canoga Park was in her kitchen at about 
1:30 a.m. when she heard a loud rumbling slowly coming up her street. She 
stepped outside and saw a convoy of three trucks accompanied by a crew of 
workers in protective, rubberized orange suits. A floodlight on one of the 
trucks lit up the air and a powerful sprayer unleashed a torrent of 
insecticidal soap at the trees. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like the 'Twilight Zone,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
As the trucks neared her house, a worker told her to go back inside because 
they would be spraying to control the ash whitefly, a tiny bug first spotted in 
Van Nuys in 1988, one that has since spread to Sacramento in the north and the 
Mexican border to the south. 
</P>
<P>
The crew let loose a stream of the soap mixture into the trees, but also 
managed to drench her house, car and most of her front yard. 
</P>
<P>
"It just tore the trees apart, leaves were flying, it was like the parting of 
the Red Sea," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The crew slowly sprayed its way down the street and then left. Russo ran 
outside and saw the block littered with tree branches and leaves. Insecticidal 
soap was dripping from everything. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather live with the fly any day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE 10 MOST UNWANTED AGRICULTURAL PESTS 
</P>
<P>
 Like the FBI, the California Department of Food and Agriculture keeps its own 
list of the "10 most unwanted" pests and plants diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata, originated in the 
Mediterranean region, although it has now spread through parts of South 
America, Central America, Europe, Africa and Asia. The Medfly attacks over 260 
type of fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
The Oriental fruit fly, Dacus dorsalis, attacks more than 150 kinds of fruits 
and vegetables. It traces its roots to southern Asia. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican fruit fly, Anastrepha ludens, is established in Mexico, Central 
America and portion of Southern Texas around the Lower Rio Grande Valley. The 
Mexfly attacks 64 types of fruits and vegetables, primarily citrus. 
</P>
<P>
The Caribbean fruit fly, Anastrepha suspensa, is native to the West Indies and 
is a threat to a number of tropical and sub-tropical fruits. 
</P>
<P>
The melon fly, Dacus cucurbitae, is indigenous to India, Southeast Asia, the 
Mariana Islands and the Hawaiian Islands. The reddish-yellow fly is a threat to 
more than 125 species of plants. 
</P>
<P>
The cotton boll weevil, Anthonomous grandis, came from Mexico and has now 
spread to Texas and Arizona. The pest invaded Imperial and Riverside counties 
from western Arizona in 1982. An eradication effort started in 1985 is now

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOY, 15, KILLED BY POLICE AFTER TRAFFIC 
CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 15-year-old Van Nuys boy was shot and killed by police when he allegedly 
refused to drop a gun after leading plainclothes officers on a chase after a 
traffic accident, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The youth, identified as Gregory Goins, died at the scene of the shooting 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began after two plainclothes officers arrived moments after three 
cars collided Thursday evening on Century Boulevard near Doty Avenue in 
Inglewood and saw two of the badly damaged cars being driven away, Sgt. John 
Bell said. The officers gave chase until both cars pulled to the curb. 
</P>
<P>
Goins, a passenger, got out and began walking toward the second car, Bell said. 
When the officers saw the driver pass a gun to Goins, Bell said, they 
identified themselves and told the suspect to drop the gun. After the youth 
allegedly "put his hand to his waistband," one of the officers fired.

UCLA HAS SHOT AT NO. 1 CONTENDER;

BRUINS: WASHINGTON'S MOTIVATION COMES FROM BEING ONE SPOT BELOW NOTRE DAME IN

<P>
Any notion UCLA had of tiptoeing into Husky Stadium and surprising Rose 
Bowl-bound Washington today has become merely an idle thought. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies, who have mauled every Pacific 10 Conference opponent they have 
played this season, are motivated by national championship aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, 8-1 overall and 6-0 in the Pac-10, is ranked second, behind Notre 
Dame. If the Irish lose to Tennessee today and the Huskies beat UCLA, as 
expected, Washington most likely will become the No. 1-ranked team in next 
week's balloting. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies have never won a national championship, but they have become 
dedicated to that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Only UCLA, Washington State and the Big Ten representative in the Rose Bowl 
remain on the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"The national championship is the goal now," Husky quarterback Mark Brunell 
said. "We're contenders, and people are accepting how good a team we are." 
</P>
<P>
Awesome may be a better description, considering how the Huskies keep elevating 
their game each week. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Since beating Oregon, 38-21, Oct. 13, Washington has beaten Stanford, 
California and Arizona by increasingly higher margins each week -- 52-16, 46-7 
and 54-10, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
In its six league games, Washington has outscored the opposition by an average 
of 33.6 points. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Huskies waste little time in asserting their superiority. They have 
outscored their Pac-10 opponents, 72-7, in the first quarter. A blocked punt by 
Arizona State accounted for the only touchdown allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Washington is the Pac-10 leader in virtually every statistic and is ranked 
first nationally in rushing defense, allowing an average of only 65.7 yards a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Huskies have a smothering defense and an effective offense led by 
Brunell and tailback Greg Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Brunell, an inexperienced sophomore at the start of the season, has completed 
53.6% of his passes for 1,242 yards and eight touchdowns while throwing four 
interceptions in the last seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Washington Coach Don James says that Brunell is the fastest quarterback he has 
had. The 6-foot-1, 205-pounder from Santa Maria is the team's second-leading 
rusher, averaging 4.5 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis is the mainstay of the running game. He has gained 100 or more yards in 
nine consecutive games for a season total of 1,229 yards and eight touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 -- James has always emphasized the importance of special teams. So the Huskies 
excel in another area. Beno Bryant, a reserve tailback from Los Angeles Dorsey 
High, has returned three punts for touchdowns. The Huskies also have blocked 
two punts. 
</P>
<P>
So, these are the seemingly overwhelming factors UCLA will be confronting 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, 4-5 overall and 3-3 in the Pac-10, will have to beat Washington 
today and USC Nov. 17 to have a winning season. It isn't likely. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, UCLA quarterback Tommy Maddox is not ready to concede anything. He is 
aware, of course, that the Huskies will try to rattle him with blitzes, or the 
threat of the blitz. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't look at Washington as some elite team. They're another team we have 
to face," Maddox said. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be tough, though, with their crowd and all the energy they've built 
up. It's going to be the toughest game of the season. We don't have anything to 
lose at this point. We have a chance to upset them, and we have to look at it 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
Maddox said the key to beating Washington, if there is one, is to pass 
successfully because the Huskies don't allow any team to run. 
</P>
<P>
"If we beat Washington, it will be amazing how many people will forget about 
the close games we've lost," Maddox said. "Everybody says our program is not 
what it used to be. But if we beat Washington and go into the USC game on a 
high, it's going to be exciting for the program and the fans." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
It has been raining here and more showers are forecast today. . . . UCLA Coach 
Terry Donahue has a 7-4-1 record against Washington and 3-2-1 in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Four UCLA players were left home with injuries: defensive end Mike Chalenski, 
with a shoulder problem; defensive tackle Brian Kelly, with a pinched nerve in 
his neck; and offensive tackles Derek Stevens and Rick Fuller, with ankle and 
knee injuries, respectively. . . . Shawn Wills is expected to start at 
tailback. Brian Brown is bothered by a bruised thigh. . . . Kevin Williams, the 
No. 2 tailback, has flu and didn't make the trip. . . . Vaughn Parker, normally 
the starting right guard, will play right tackle, with Mike Linn filling in for 
Parker. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's offensive line averages 293 pounds with strong tackle Lincoln 
Kennedy checking in at 315 pounds. . . . Inside linebacker Chico Fraley, from 
La Puente Bishop Amat High, is one of 10 Southern Californians who play 
regularly for the Huskies. . . . Washington's Rose Bowl appearance will be its 
11th bowl game in the last 12 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona offensive guard Rob Flory on the Huskies: "That's the best team I've 
ever seen. They've got to be No. 1. We came in here thinking we could play with 
them. After halftime, though, you could see some guys giving up."

USC HAS TO SEARCH FOR MOTIVATION; 
</P>
<P>
TROJANS: THEY FACE 1-8 OREGON STATE TODAY, WITH THEIR POSTSEASON PLANS ALREADY 
SET.

<P>
Its bowl plans are set. And it still has regular-season games to play against 
UCLA and Notre Dame, its most bitter rivals. 
</P>
<P>
But up first for USC is today's game against Oregon State, which is tied for 
last place in the Pacific 10 and is close to the bottom of the conference in 
almost every statistical category. 
</P>
<P>
Will motivation be a problem for the Trojans in a game that is expected to draw 
only about 20,000 fans to Parker Stadium? 
</P>
<P>
Not according to defensive leader, linebacker Scott Ross, who said: "You've got 
to look at it like, it's great for your statistics if you kick butt." 
</P>
<P>
USC has beaten up on the Beavers almost from the inception of the series in 
1914. Although the Trojans lost the first two games, they have been beaten only 
five times in 54 games since. 
</P>
<P>
USC has won its last 18 games against Oregon State, since losing to the Beavers 
in 1967, when a team led by O.J. Simpson was upset, 3-0, at Corvallis. The 
Trojans recovered from the defeat to win the national championship and 
routinely swamped the Beavers throughout the 1970s and '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Coach Larry Smith said this week: "Oregon State is a team that's capable 
of beating any team on its schedule." 
</P>
<P>
So far this season, the Beavers have beaten one of nine. 
</P>
<P>
They rank eighth in the Pac-10 in rushing offense, ninth in passing offense and 
last in total offense. They have allowed more sacks than any other team in the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, they rank last against the run and eighth overall. 
</P>
<P>
"The record speaks for itself," Coach Dave Kragthorpe said. "We're 
disappointed. There were some games early that we should have won -- if you 
look at things (beforehand) and try to predict games that you should win. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Lately, it's been very frustrating because I honestly feel that we could have 
won at UCLA. I also feel that we could have won at Arizona State. I say that 
because we were in very, very good shape at halftime of both games, playing 
solidly." 
</P>
<P>
The Beavers also were in good shape at halftime against Nebraska, leading the 
Cornhuskers, 7-3. Oregon State lost, 31-7. Against UCLA two weeks ago at the 
Rose Bowl, the Beavers trailed at halftime, 16-14, before losing, 26-17. Last 
week at Arizona State, they trailed at halftime, 10-6, before losing, 34-9. 
</P>
<P>
The one team the Beavers did beat was Arizona, which upset USC at the Coliseum, 
35-26, a week later. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State's nose tackle, 6-foot-3, 268-pound Esera Tuaolo, is one of the 
best in college football. A senior from Don Lugo High School in Chino, he was 
the defensive lineman of the year in the Pac-10 last season and is a probable 
NFL first-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the best football players in the country, and they've got him over 
our youngest player, so we're a little concerned about that matchup," Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuaolo, still rounding into shape after missing the first three games with a 
sprained knee, will line up against center Craig Gibson, a redshirt freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State's starting quarterback is expected to be Fred Schweer, a redshirt 
freshman from Woodbridge High School in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Schweer was the starter in the Beavers' 35-21 victory over Arizona, directing 
three long scoring drives and throwing a touchdown pass. He started against 
UCLA but had to leave the game with an elbow injury and hasn't played since. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
A USC victory would be Coach Larry Smith's 100th as a major college coach. He 
is 99-65-5 in more than 14 seasons at Tulane, Arizona and USC. . . . The 
Trojans and Beavers won't meet again until 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State led the Pac-10 in passing in the first three of Coach Dave 
Kragthorpe's five seasons in Corvallis, but the Beavers slipped to eighth last 
season. This season and last, Oregon State has run more than it has passed. . . 
. Oregon State's Dwayne Owens, a walk-on transfer from American River College 
in Sacramento, averages 157.3 yards a game to rank third in the Pac-10 in 
all-purpose running. He is a nephew of James Owens, a former UCLA running back 
and hurdler.

GIBSON: DODGERS HAVE NOT CALLED; 
</P>

HASN'T BEEN FOR A LONG WHILE.

The signing of Darryl Strawberry seemed to slam the door on the possibility of 
the Dodgers re-signing Kirk Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson, however, doesn't think the door was even ajar. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they made their decision long before Strawberry signed," Gibson said 
from his office in suburban Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, I don't think I fit in the Dodger plans and I haven't for some time, 
but I don't know if I can really say that because the Dodgers haven't called to 
tell me one way or another, and you would think they would." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Claire, the Dodgers' executive vice president, has said that he is still 
considering all options, but he has yet to have substantive contract talks with 
any of the four Dodgers who are now free agents -- Fernando Valenzuela, Juan 
Samuel, Mickey Hatcher and Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson said that neither he nor his agent, Doug Baldwin, has had any 
communication with the Dodgers since the season ended. 
</P>
<P>
Is he surprised by that? 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter what I think about it," Gibson said. "It's just the way the 
business is." 
</P>
<P>
And the signing of Strawberry? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really have any reaction to it," he said. "It's the Dodgers' decision. 
I can only try and analyze my own situation." 
</P>
<P>
Gibson doesn't seem to figure in the Dodger plans. Strawberry is ticketed to 
play center field, with Kal Daniels in left, Hubie Brooks in right and Stan 
Javier the insurance policy in center. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson's future as a Dodger, tenuous throughout 1990 because of the condition 
of his legs, is believed to have darkened considerably when he had a 
late-season shouting match with Claire over his role and position. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson denied Friday that he ever asked the Dodgers to trade him back to the 
Detroit Tigers or an American League team in the Midwest, saying it was more a 
discussion than a demand. 
</P>
<P>
"That was before I knew how I was, health-wise, and I thought I might be better 
suited to the American League (as a designated hitter)," he said. "I went on to 
find out I could play every day and I still can. I don't think I'm limited. I 
don't look at myself as an American League player." 
</P>
<P>
Gibson, however, is said to be encountering a skeptical market, with clubs 
leery of his legs. He is not expected to be signed quickly, by the Tigers or 
anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
He would not discuss the market, saying only: "I'll be all right. We'll just 
have to wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
He also declined to speculate on how Strawberry will adapt to center field. 
</P>
<P>
Would Gibson return to the Dodgers if asked? 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't ruled out any possibility, but I don't expect to be asked," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry, through agent Eric Goldschmidt, declined to respond to statements 
by New York Met infielder Tim Teufel in the New York Post. Teufel was quoted as 
saying that Strawberry quit on the Mets during the final week of the season, 
when he missed seven of the last eight games because of back spasms. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't blame the Mets at all for taking a stand," Teufel was quoted as saying 
of the contract issue. "The last two weeks of the season, the way Strawberry 
handled himself and didn't want to play in a pennant race . . . you're going to 
give a guy $20 million who wouldn't go out there in those games? 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, he was not going to jeopardize anything, going into the off-season 
as a free agent. He wanted to be healthy. He was thinking totally of himself, 
not the team. We still had a chance to win, and Darryl just wouldn't play. He 
said, 'Enough is enough.' " 
</P>
<P>
Said Goldschmidt: "Darryl has no interest in making a response. The Mets are 
behind him. It's not important to him anymore, and we can't even be sure Teufel 
said it. I mean, some people are going to be angry and some will realize this 
was the best thing for Darryl."

COLLEGE FOOTBALL: A GRUDGE BUILDS AS KLINGLER MASTERS 8-0 HOUSTON'S OFFENSE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Starting the season as the replacement for 1989 Heisman Trophy winner Andre 
Ware, University of Houston quarterback David Klingler had one simple goal. 
</P>
<P>
Said Klingler: "To basically not let there be a drop-off from what Andre did 
last year." 
</P>
<P>
Has he accomplished his mission? 
</P>
<P>
In eight games as the point man in Houston's run-and-shoot offense, Klingler, a 
junior, has completed 270 of 463 passes for 3,553 yards and 34 touchdowns, 
numbers similar to -- and, in some areas, better than -- what Ware was posting 
a year ago en route to winning the Heisman. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, as the season moves into its final weeks, Klingler's Cougars are 
8-0, the only team in Division I-A without a loss or a tie, and ranked No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Should they defeat 14th-ranked Texas Saturday night in Austin, the Cougars will 
have blown through the Southwest Conference without a defeat and, with only 
Eastern Washington and Arizona State (in Tokyo) remaining on their schedule, 
will be in excellent position to have an 11-0 regular season. 
</P>
<P>
NCAA sanctions -- for violations committed during the tenure of former Coach 
Bill Yeoman -- will prohibit Houston from playing in a bowl game this season, 
as they kept the 9-2 Cougars of 1989 out of the bowls and off live television. 
</P>
<P>
But, as was the case a year ago, the Houston offense is producing spectacular 
numbers and making a surprise Heisman candidate of its quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Klingler's candidacy, boosted by seven-touchdown performances in each of his 
last two games, raises the possibility that two players from the same school 
could win the award in consecutive years for the first time since Doc Blanchard 
and Glenn Davis did it at Army in 1945 and '46. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of a Ware-Klingler Heisman double is not going to inspire any 
lyrical musings in the Mr. Inside-Mr. Outside vein, however. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its unblemished record, Houston is ranked behind Notre Dame and 
Washington, both with one defeat, this week, and many of the 60 writers and 
broadcasters who vote in the Associated Press poll have indicated that they 
won't make the Cougars No. 1 or award them the national championship even if 
they finish 11-0. 
</P>
<P>
The skeptics have been put off by Houston's schedule -- the Cougars beat Nevada 
Las Vegas, 37-9, in its only game so far outside the SWC -- and by the fact 
that they will end the season without the test of a bowl game. Mike Francesa of 
CBS told the Dallas Times Herald this week that, even if the Cougars could go 
to a bowl, "what Notre Dame, Miami, Florida State would do to Houston would be 
embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, such talk leaves Houston supporters shaking their heads and 
talking about the national media and its Notre Dame fixation. 
</P>
<P>
"If Notre Dame did what we've done, Andre and I would be the best two 
quarterbacks to ever walk the earth or something," Klingler said. "If Notre 
Dame is undefeated, they're No. 1 no matter what, no matter who else is 
undefeated." 
</P>
<P>
Houston has, with the run-and-shoot, broken more than 250 NCAA, SWC and school 
offensive records since 1987, when Jack Pardee, who had used the formation with 
the Houston Gamblers of the USFL, took over for Yeoman. 
</P>
<P>
After last season, during which he threw for 4,699 yards and 46 touchdowns, 
Ware decided to give up his final year of eligibility to go through the NFL 
draft, during which he was selected in the first round by the Detroit Lions. 
Pardee also left the university for the NFL, becoming coach of the Houston 
Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
But with Klingler, Ware's backup, moving up on the depth chart and John 
Jenkins, Pardee's offensive coordinator, moving into the head coaching 
position, the Cougars haven't missed a beat. They are averaging 564 yards of 
total offense and 42.8 points, and Klingler has already found a place in the 
record books, setting an NCAA record for completions in a game -- 48 Oct. 20 at 
Southern Methodist. 
</P>
<P>
Like Ware, an option quarterback in high school who was considered a defensive 
back prospect by Texas and Texas A&amp;M, Klingler did not come to Houston with 
much of a reputation, at least not as a passer. 
</P>
<P>
Klingler was a wishbone quarterback at Stratford High in Houston and missed 
about half his senior season because of an ankle injury. Still, Houston coaches 
were impressed enough by his size, athleticism and arm strength to project him 
as a run-and-shoot quarterback. At 6 feet 3 and 205 pounds, he high jumped 6 
feet 9 and got basketball feelers from Kansas, Pittsburgh and Ball State. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in discussing Klingler's physical ability, Jenkins says: "With continued 
maturity -- I'd say four to five years' time -- he's going to have the 
strongest arm in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more significant in Klingler's immediate success, however, he spent 
three years learning the run-and-shoot, sitting out as a redshirt in his first 
year and backing up Ware in 1988 and '89. 
</P>
<P>
Klingler spent the time honing his throwing mechanics in practice -- which, at 
Houston, typically calls for a quarterback to throw between 200 and 300 passes 
a day -- and absorbing the nuances of the run-and-shoot in meetings and film 
sessions with Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many players who know what their offense is supposed to do, but 
they don't know anything about the defense (they are facing)," Klingler said. 
"Here, all we do is watch defenses. What's the weakness of this coverage? 
What's the weakness of that coverage? How do we get receivers into the weakness 
of it? Every play we've got, we run it hundreds of times against whatever's out 
there (defensively), so eventually it becomes old hat." 
</P>
<P>
Is the Houston run-and-shoot, which Jenkins refers to as "this operation of 
mine," making average throwers look great? Is it the quarterback or the system? 
</P>
<P>
Both, Jenkins says. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a misconception to say, 'Aw, it's just the system,' " he said. "If it 
is, how come nobody else in the country has done it? Why hasn't this been done 
before? 
</P>
<P>
"My other thought on that question is that at one point in time, not too long 
ago, Marcus Allen, O.J. Simpson, Mike Garrett, those guys came out of a system, 
the I-formation tailback system at Southern Cal. 
</P>
<P>
"What's to say the Houston quarterbacks of the present and future won't be 
recognized in the same regard? We're talking about a quarterback (Ware) who, a 
year ago, went beyond all points any quarterback had ever reached in the 
history of college football. And I'll be danged if the next guy isn't doing the 
same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Klingler completed 68 of 114 passes for 865 yards and eight 
touchdowns -- four in Houston's 95-21 victory over SMU -- during mop-up duty 
and, perhaps more important for the program, made his dormitory room available 
for Ware -- who was "tired and rundown," as Klingler remembers him -- to hide 
out in as the Heisman hype mounted. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as his own numbers soar, Klingler finds himself in a similar situation. 
</P>
<P>
Nicknamed "Slinger" (by Jenkins) not long after he arrived on campus, he 
recently submitted to a photo for the school newspaper, the Daily Cougar, in 
gunslinger attire, a football on each hip. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, however, Klingler, as modest and soft-spoken as Jenkins is 
cocky, is content to leave the explaining and promoting to others. 
</P>
<P>
And, yes, he says, he will return next year for his senior season. He will, 
after all, have another goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm still learning, getting experience," he said. "And I think 
we'll have something to prove next year. We play Miami and Illinois early. 
We'll be off probation. No sanctions. A strong schedule. So there will be no 
excuses next year for somebody to hide behind and not give the national 
championship to us."

LEWIS KEEPS HUSKY OFFENSE RUNNING AT 100%

<P>
The sky is the color of bathtub ring, umbrellas are getting blown out of 
people's hands, it's raining and it's cold. No doubt about it, it's a perfect 
day to be a Husky. 
</P>
<P>
In the Pacific Northwest, the rule of thumb these days is if the weather is 
bad, the Washington Huskies are good, and neither rain nor sleet nor gloom of 
day is going to keep them from their appointed rounds -- namely, turning loose 
tailback Greg Lewis and letting him trample some Pacific 10 foe like a runaway 
dogsled. 
</P>
<P>
So far in conference games, the Huskies have scored 31, 42, 38, 52, 46 and 54 
points, and Lewis has gained at least 100 yards each time, which can't make 
UCLA feel very good because the Bruins play Rose Bowl-bound Washington today. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA must try to catch Lewis, a soft-spoken, studious, religious, 5-foot-10, 
210-pound senior who is on his own mission. Lewis is trying to catch Marcus 
Allen. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981 at USC, Allen became the only Pac-10 back to gain at least 100 yards in 
every game of a season. Lewis is nine for nine this season. It has been noted 
that the Indianapolis 500 happens every May, but the Lewis 100 happens every 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it hasn't hurt that Lewis runs behind an offensive line only 
slightly smaller than Puget Sound. From tackle to tackle, the Huskies weigh 
288, 270, 280, 290 and 315 pounds. That last one would be 6-foot-7 strong-side 
tackle Lincoln Kennedy, who may not be team captain, but is believed to be in 
the running for team president. 
</P>
<P>
Behind this bunch, in the two years he has been a starter, Lewis has 14 games 
of 100 or more yards, 10 them in a row, and leads the conference in rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Is this guy a Heisman Trophy candidate or what? 
</P>
<P>
"There is not much I can do about it," Lewis said. "All I have to do is go out 
and play my best." 
</P>
<P>
On the field, Lewis is not so underwhelming. He is averaging 5.7 yards a carry, 
with 1,229 yards in 217 carries, and his average of 136.56 yards a game ranks 
him fifth in NCAA Division I-A rushing. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies, of course, are No. 2 in the national polls, only a victory over 
UCLA and a Notre Dame loss to Tennessee away from a No. 1 ranking and a 
possible national championship. All those bumper stickers around town could be 
right. "Husky Fever" may be catching. 
</P>
<P>
All this is pretty heady stuff for Lewis and his teammates, who already have 
crushed the other school from Los Angeles, beating USC, 31-0, in September at 
Husky Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
There are 58,833 season ticket-holders who gather in the Huskies' 72,500-seat 
doghouse where Lewis has had his best games -- 207 yards in a 46-7 rout of 
California and 176 yards in a 38-17 pounding of Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been a fantastic player," running back coach Matt Simon said. "And when 
he leaves here, he's got a real strong chance to make an NFL club, I think." 
</P>
<P>
That would certainly be a change from how his college career began. A 
basketball and football star at Ingraham High here, Lewis was a bench-warmer 
for his first two years behind tailback Vince Weathersby. But until Weathersby 
-- nicknamed "VW" -- pulled out, Lewis stayed parked. 
</P>
<P>
"I was wondering if I was ever going to get to play," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Sprint work lowered his time in the 40-yard dash from 4.6 to 4.4 seconds, and 
the hours Lewis spent in the weight room turned his thighs from average to 
tackle-breaking. There has never been anything wrong with Lewis' peripheral 
vision, which Coach Don James said enables Lewis to find the right hole in the 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Vision is part of it," James said. "He's got the ability to make a move based 
on where he feels the hole." 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when it seemed unclear whether Lewis would even have a chance 
to look for a hole. Instead, Lewis was heading for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Twice during his senior year in high school, guns were pulled on him. Lewis 
blamed alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
"And alcohol and I don't mix," he told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer earlier 
in the season. "When I drank, I got kind of violent." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, from South Seattle, said it would be wrong to portray his youth too 
harshly: "I mean, I wasn't like a thug or anything, but I made some bad 
decisions." 
</P>
<P>
So Lewis turned to the Bible. Influenced by teammate Donald Jones, he let his 
new-found religious beliefs steer him in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to be a tough guy anymore," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
He teaches Bible studies on Mondays at a dormitory on campus, holds prayer 
meetings at his house on Thursdays and attends Rejoice in Jesus Ministries 
services on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, a political science major with a 3.0 grade-point average, will graduate 
in June. He will be the only senior on the football team to graduate in four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Said Lewis: "God gave me a brain, too." 
</P>
<P>
Father of a 1-year-old girl, Briana, Lewis said he plans to wed Felicia Gipson, 
his daughter's mother, after he graduates. 
</P>
<P>
After that? Well, Lewis doesn't like to look too far ahead, no matter how 
attractive his string of 100-yard games must make him look to some NFL teams. 
"I have dreamed about the NFL, sure," Lewis said. "But you come to realize that 
not a lot of people make it. At least now, though, I think I have a chance."

MARINOVICH'S FATHER IS ACCUSED OF BERATING FAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
USC is looking into complaints that Marv Marinovich, father of quarterback Todd 
Marinovich, berated a fan during last Saturday's game at the Coliseum, a USC 
athletic official confirmed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Marv Marinovich allegedly lashed out verbally at the fan, who had derided 
Marinovich's son and called for a backup to replace him. USC received two 
letters about the incident, one from the unidentified man who allegedly was 
confronted by Marinovich, and another from fans who sat nearby and said they 
had witnessed the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, they had their own opinions on who they were rooting for as far as 
the quarterback (was concerned)," said Jim Hefner, an assistant athletic 
director at USC and director of game management. "From what I can gather, there 
was a verbal display of emotion from both people -- mostly from Marv." 
</P>
<P>
A source who spoke with several eyewitnesses said Marinovich pointed at the man 
and loudly cursed him. Asked about the allegations, Marinovich at first denied 
that he was involved, but later said he had words with several fans. 
</P>
<P>
Angry words? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, yeah, sure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd's negative reaction to his son upset him, he said. "What's the big 
deal about it?" Marinovich said. "Could any parent sit up there and listen to 
that kind of crap? Not me. What would you do if somebody was booing at your son 
for no reason?" 
</P>
<P>
It has been confirmed that Todd Marinovich was held out at the start of last 
week's game as punishment for arriving late to a team meeting on the morning of 
the game. When he did arrive, he was locked out of the meeting by Ray Dorr, who 
coaches USC's quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich will start today's game at Oregon State, Coach Larry Smith said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Shane Foley was USC's starter in last week's 31-31 tie with California 
but was replaced by Marinovich after leading the Trojans to a touchdown and a 
7-0 lead in their first possession. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Marinovich, suspended a week earlier for cutting class, was greeted 
by scattered boos, which became louder and more prevalent as the Trojans fell 
behind, 24-10, in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Later, after he had passed for 291 yards and two touchdowns, Todd Marinovich 
told reporters: "I thought we were playing at Cal." 
</P>
<P>
Said his father: "I was definitely upset when fans were booing, no question 
about that. I have never seen booing like that in a college game. To me, it was 
utterly ridiculous, particularly (by) the people who don't know anything about 
what they're booing." 
</P>
<P>
Marv Marinovich said he had not been contacted by USC. It is possible that 
Marinovich will be moved to another section of the Coliseum for the Trojans' 
final home game, but Hefner said: "I want to get both sides of it before I make 
any decision on that."

The Dallas Mavericks' Roy Tarpley collapsed and appeared to be seriously 
injured after going in for a layup during a 111-99 victory over the Orlando 
Magic in Dallas Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Tarpley's right knee buckled and he had to be carried off near the end of the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors had to push Tarpley's kneecap back in place; he is expected to be 
sidelined for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In his previous two games, Tarpley had totaled 55 points and 21 rebounds. The 
Mavericks are also without guard Fat Lever, who will undergo arthroscopic 
surgery on a knee next week. 
</P>
<P>
Rolando Blackman scored 25 of his 34 points in the second half as the Mavericks 
scored their fourth consecutive victory. The Magic is 0-5. DAN HAFNER

PLAYING GIANTS BRINGS OUT HIS BEST

<P>
The Rams have beaten the New York Giants three times in a row heading into 
Sunday's game. Quarterback Jim Everett was asked how they did it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," he said. "I couldn't get into the theory part. I just enjoy it, 
I enjoy the high of playing the New York Giants." 
</P>
<P>
With national attention centering on a possible 11-0 vs. 11-0 matchup between 
the Giants and the San Francisco 49ers Dec. 3, it seems to be assumed that the 
Rams, who play both teams before that date, won't throw a wrench into the 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
"That's OK," Ram cornerback Jerry Gray said, "because I think it's kind of good 
for us, especially if they do overlook us and we come in, and they're 10-1 
apiece." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bill Parcells said it's not hard to motivate his Giants, even though they 
are 8-0 and three games ahead of Washington, its nearest foe in the NFC East. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't think the two (other strong) teams in our division, Philadelphia 
and Washington, are going to go away," Parcells said. TIM KAWAKAMI

A TIME OF UNCERTAINTY FOR PC INDUSTRY TITANS; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: TAKING STOCK AS THE COMDEX TRADE SHOW OPENS, SOME OBSERVERS DOUBT 
THAT THERE WILL BE ENOUGH BRIGHT SPOTS TO COMPENSATE FOR A GLOOMY TREND. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the personal computer industry gathers in Las Vegas for its huge Comdex 
trade show starting Monday, companies of all stripes are anxiously scanning the 
heavens, wondering if the gathering clouds of recession will gently rain on the 
PC parade or unleash a devastating storm. 
</P>
<P>
For months, there have been indications that the industry is in for some rough 
weather. Market research shows domestic personal computer sales growth dropping 
below 5% for 1990 -- far below the double-digit growth of recent years -- and 
booming overseas markets have begun to sag. Price wars have broken out. Many 
computer stores are struggling to stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
Yet a few glimmers pierce the gloom. Optimists cite the popularity of 
notebook-size computers that can do anything a good desktop machine can do, and 
about a dozen companies are expected to show high-powered new notebooks at 
Comdex. 
</P>
<P>
Corporate customers are still buying the powerful -- and expensive -- PCs that 
link networks of traditional PCs, while consumers have responded well to 
economical new products from Apple Computer and International Business 
Machines. Comdex, the largest trade show in the country, will be brimming with 
imaginative new uses for Microsoft's hugely successful Windows software. 
</P>
<P>
But many believe that these bright spots will not be enough to counter the 
downward trend -- at least in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two conflicting tensions," says Ed Anderson, president of 
Computerland, a chain of computer stores catering to businesses. "There's the 
attitude that computer networks are too strategic (for corporate buyers) to cut 
back on. And then there's the opposite, the board of directors saying that the 
banks are going to clamp down on credit, so it's time to postpone (computer) 
projects." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson believes that growth in the $27-billion U.S. PC industry has all but 
ground to a halt in recent months. Slow sales have led most manufacturers to 
cut prices by 20% or more for mainstream desktop PCs, and dealer incentive 
programs are getting more aggressive. "Last year, the trend was to offer neat 
bundles of software" with PC purchases, said Michael Rusert, executive vice 
president of Computer City Supercenter, a large retailer in Garden Grove. "This 
year, it's cash rebates. The prices have really dropped out. It's astounding." 
</P>
<P>
He said color machines that used the popular Intel 286 microprocessor as their 
brain were selling for as little as $1,300, and machines equipped with the 
higher performance Intel 386 microprocessor could be had for $1,700. 
</P>
<P>
The discounting has helped keep volume growing at Rusert's store, which caters 
primarily to home computer users and small businesses. But Joeann Stahel, 
president of the market research firm Storeboard, says the price cuts could 
lead to a "blood bath" for the manufacturers, and she cautions that the full 
impact of recession-related corporate buying cutbacks has not yet been felt. 
</P>
<P>
Pricing pressures have also sent manufacturers "scrambling to find where the 
margins still exist," noted Andrew Seybold, an analyst at Dataquest. One place 
they exist -- at least for the moment -- are in high-performance notebook 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Compaq Computer, Texas Instruments, Epson and AST Research 
have all introduced notebook computers that use Intel's fast 386SX 
microprocessor, and dozens of new varieties of notebook and laptop machines are 
expected at Comdex. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those products will be from Japanese, Taiwanese and Korean 
manufacturers, ranging from well-entrenched players such as Toshiba and NEC to 
big-name newcomers such as Nippon Steel to complete unknowns. Many Asian 
vendors, strong in critical flat-screen technologies and component 
miniaturization, view the portable arena as the ideal entry point into the U.S. 
PC business. 
</P>
<P>
The high end of the market will also be attracting attention at Comdex with the 
debut of new "servers" -- machines designed to control large networks of 
computers -- that use Intel's most advanced microprocessor, the 486. IBM will 
show new high-end servers that were announced two weeks ago, and Advanced Logic 
Research will be showing its new clone of Compaq's successful Systempro network 
server. 
</P>
<P>
Computer buyers looking for power and speed will also be able to peruse a host 
of new desktop machines that are based on a design licensed from Sun 
Microsystems. Sun's workstations, as well as the emerging group of Sun clones, 
use the efficient but complicated Unix operating system to control basic 
functions. They've traditionally been sold to engineers and scientists. 
</P>
<P>
But Sun has been pushing hard to sell its workstations as an alternative to 
personal computers for many mainstream business applications, and the company 
will have a "drastically larger" presence at Comdex this year than in the past, 
a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Another highlight of the show will be new equipment to bring pictures and 
moving images onto personal computer screens. 
</P>
<P>
The tens of thousands of Comdex attendees will be hoping that these and the 
hundreds of other new gadgets on display will be enough to keep the industry 
moving forward. And in a go-go business accustomed to rapid growth, there are 
still plenty of people who consider the outlook sunny. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the business grew 20% in the third quarter, and we see 20% in the 
fourth quarter," said Linwood A. (Chip) Lacy Jr., chairman of Santa Ana-based 
Ingram Micro D, the nation's largest computer products distributor. 
</P>
<P>
Even Anderson of Computerland, a short-term pessimist, is "unabashedly 
optimistic" about the industry's long-term prospects. But he, like many others 
in the business, is waiting anxiously for the country to "get past the Middle 
East crisis."

DOW GAINS 44.80 ON PEACE HOPES, INFLATION REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market shot higher Friday on encouraging news from the inflation 
front as well as hopes of lower interest rates and peace in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks also were buoyed by a surging bond market and falling oil prices, which 
retreated on unfounded rumors of a coup in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index jumped 44.80 points to close at 2,488.61, up 
1.8%. Friday's trading marked a sharp rebound in the performance of the index 
from declines earlier in the week, including a 44.31-point drop Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Friday's rally, the Dow ended the week down 2.23 points. 
</P>
<P>
For the day, the broader market was up, too. Advancing issues led decliners on 
the New York Stock Exchange 1,123 to 453, with 428 stocks unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume was 145.16 million shares, down from 155.57 million shares on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The government bond market and the New York currency markets will be closed on 
Veterans Day. Stock exchanges and most commodity markets will be open. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street reacted favorably to a government report that wholesale prices, not 
including food and energy, were nearly unchanged in October. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that really gave people a lot of relief," said Bruce Pally, a vice 
president and stock trader for the Los Angeles investment firm Bateman Eichler, 
Hill Richards. 
</P>
<P>
The upbeat inflation report raised hopes that the Federal Reserve may begin to 
cut interest rates, said Eugene E. Peroni Jr., director of technical research 
for Janney Montgomery Scott, an investment firm in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a positive perception among traders that rates will come down over 
the short run," he said. Peroni also pointed to the strong Treasury auction 
this week, a record refunding in which demand was high enough to keep yields 
lower than they have been in several months. 
</P>
<P>
Investors were heartened by President Bush's plans to send as many as 240,000 
more troops to the Persian Gulf, hoping that the high-profile troop movements 
will discourage hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't move another 100,000 or 150,000 troops if you're going to declare 
war tomorrow," said Michael Metz, market strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The market's spurt was accelerated by computer-driven buying programs and by 
traders who, going into the weekend, were covering short positions by buying 
shares they had earlier borrowed and then sold in the expectation that the 
price would fall, a practice known as "selling short." 
</P>
<P>
Technical factors helped, too, as the Dow continued to bounce back from a 
resistance level of 2,430, which was tested three times on Thursday, Peroni 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Some bank stocks rallied sharply. They have been favorite targets of short 
sellers in recent months. The Standard &amp; Poor's financial index shot up 
2.6%. Big gainers included CalFed, up 3/4 to 3 1/4, Golden West, up 1 to 21 
5/8, Wells Fargo, up 2 5/8 to 49 3/8, and Security Pacific, up 1 to 21 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Oil stocks jumped, once again showing that they are trading independent of 
oil price movements. Arco soared 2 1/4 to 131 1/2, Chevron rose 1 7/8 to 69 
3/8, Pennzoil gained 2 to 66 5/8 and Mobil rose 1 3/8 to 59 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
* Walt Disney Co. gained 1 1/4 to 92 3/8, even though some analysts reduced 
their 1991 earnings estimates because of worries about theme park attendance. 
Seidler Amdec Securities cut its 1991 estimate to $7 a share from $7.25. 
</P>
<P>
* Drug stocks were among the market leaders. Warner Lambert gained 2 1/2 to 65, 
Merck jumped 2 to 80 1/2, Pfizer rose 2 1/4 to 76 3/8 and Amgen gained 1 to 49. 
</P>
<P>
* Airlines continued to weaken on worries over the industry's financial health. 
USAir fell 3/8 to 13 5/8, Delta eased 3/8 to 55 3/8, and Alaska Air fell 1/2 to 
15 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
In international markets, German shares gained nearly 1% -- their steepest rise 
so far this month -- as cautious buying interest from foreign and domestic 
participants lifted prices. The 30-share Dax index climbed 12.05 points to 
1,381.49 but ended 32.83 points lower for the week as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo stocks fell but were well off their lows after last-minute buying almost 
completely offset an earlier decline on the back of a weaker yen. The key 
225-share Nikkei index looked as though it was headed for a 500-point plunge in 
the afternoon but recovered to finish down 38.01 points at 22,931.80. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices ended slightly higher on London's stock exchange after a 
lackluster session. The Financial Times 100-share index was up 4.4 points to 
2,040.6.

<P>
CREDIT: Bond Prices Make Substantial Gains 
</P>
<P>
Government bond prices jumped as the market anticipated that the Federal 
Reserve Board would lower interest rates when it gathers next week, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The price of the government's bellwether 30-year bond climbed 29/32 point, or 
about $9.06 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which falls when the bond's 
price rises, slid to 8.62% from 8.70% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The government bond market is closed Monday for Veterans Day. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 7.563%, down from 7.625% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY: Gulf Crisis Concerns Cushion the Dollar 
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed slightly lower against major foreign currencies, pressured by 
expectations that the Fed may lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Fear of war in the Persian Gulf, however, provided a floor for the U.S. 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
Caught between the two pressures, the dollar fell slightly in New York to 
1.4870 German marks from 1.4930 at Thursday's close, and it fell to 129.70 
Japanese yen from 130.35. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES: Soybean Futures Drag Grain Down 
</P>
<P>
Soybean futures prices fell to 8 1/2-month lows Friday on the Chicago Board of 
Trade, dragging grain futures down as well, after the government issued a 
surprisingly large estimate of the newly harvested crop. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, oil and precious metals futures fell, cattle 
futures rose and pork futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Soybean futures settled 5 to 17.25 cents lower with the contract for delivery 
in November at $5.6675 a bushel, the lowest settlement of a near-month soybean 
contract since Feb. 28, when the March contract finished at $5.665. 
</P>
<P>
Oil futures fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid profit taking 
that reflected reduced fears of imminent war in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Light sweet crude oil futures finished $1.01 to $1.64 lower, with December at 
$33.89 a barrel; heating oil was 2.55 to 4.06 cents lower, with December at 
90.24 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline was 1.51 to 2.38 cents lower, with 
December at 88.23 cents gallon.

NEIL BUSH'S FORMER PARTNER PETITIONS FOR BANKRUPTCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Denver developer Bill Walters, who defaulted on about $100 million in 
loans from Silverado Savings &amp; Loan, has filed a personal bankruptcy 
petition in federal court in Santa Ana listing debts of $279 million. 
</P>
<P>
The filing comes several months after Walters, a former business partner of 
Neil Bush -- President Bush's son who sat on the Silverado board, created a 
firestorm of controversy in Washington when it was revealed that he was living 
in a $1.9-million Newport Beach home a month after telling Congress that he was 
broke. 
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy petition, filed Nov. 1, lists more than 200 creditors. The 
largest is New York banking giant Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., which is 
owed $111 million. He even lists his ex-wife Mary Lou McGuire, whom he owes 
$5.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, Walters owes $5.2 million to Far West Savings &amp; 
Loan in Newport Beach, according to the petition. Irvine businessman Burt M. 
Heimlich is listed as having a $1.95-million claim. 
</P>
<P>
Walters could not be reached for comment. His San Diego bankruptcy attorney 
Nathan E. Jones did not return several phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Walters was once one of Denver's highest-flying real estate developers, helping 
to reconfigure the city's skyline while amassing a personal fortune that in the 
mid-1980s totaled at least $200 million. He moved to Orange County this year 
after his empire collapsed in connection with the depression in Denver's real 
estate markets. 
</P>
<P>
Silverado had bankrolled the Bill L. Walters Cos. and federal regulators claim 
that his firm's default on $96 million in loans helped cause the thrift's 1988 
collapse, which is expected to cost taxpayers $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Bush became the subject of a federal inquiry and the lightning rod for 
taxpayer anger over the savings and loan crisis in part because he approved 
loans to Walters while sitting on Silverado's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Congress has investigated charges that Bush may have violated 
conflict-of-interest laws because he was a partner with Walters in an oil 
exploration firm. Bush is also a defendant in a $200-million lawsuit filed 
against some former Silverado officials by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Walters actions drew national attention in July when it was disclosed that he 
was living in a Newport Beach mansion and dividing his leisure time between a 
$1-million desert retreat near Palm Springs and a $250,000 mobile home on 
Laguna Beach. Just the month before he told a House subcommittee he had "a 
negative net worth." 
</P>
<P>
Each of those homes is listed either in the name of his second wife Jacqueline 
or in a trust of which she is the beneficiary. The Newport Beach home is for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
Under Chapter 7, a federal bankruptcy judge will appoint an independent trustee 
to liquidate Walters assets and distribute them to debtors according to rules 
set forth in bankruptcy law. 
</P>
<P>
The law allows a debtor to hold on to $45,000 in home equity and up to $1,200 
invested in a car. Jewelry, heirlooms and works of art exceeding a total of 
$2,500 must be sold. 
</P>
<P>
The court-appointed trustee may also probe whether Walters has hidden assets or 
improperly transferred them to relatives or friends, said James I. Stang, a Los 
Angeles bankruptcy attorney and a former Chapter 7 trustee. This could include 
three homes and two Mercedes-Benzes that are held in the name of his wife, 
Jacqueline Walters. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain statutory lawsuits that the trustee can bring that examine 
transactions that occur within four years of the bankruptcy," Stang said. "What 
the trustee would want to examine would be the sources of the money for those 
purchases. The fact things were acquired in her name or a trust benefiting her 
is not necessarily the end of the story." 
</P>
<P>
The former Jacqueline Brown, an insurance saleswoman before she married Walters 
in 1986, is listed in the bankruptcy filing as a creditor for "unpaid family 
expenses under prenuptial agreement" though the amount claimed is zero. 
</P>
<P>
The Walters were married on Nov. 15, 1986, and the Walters Trust I -- which is 
in her name and is the entity that purchased the Newport Beach home -- was 
formed a day later. He transferred his $1-million Indian Wells condominium to 
her on Nov. 17 of the same year, according to records in the Riverside County 
Recorder's office. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of the Walters' creditors contacted on Friday refused to comment.

JAPANESE FIRM TO BUY COASTAL LAND OWNED BY QINTEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A major Japanese financial concern said Friday that it agreed to acquire a 
231-acre swath of Orange County seaside land -- known as Monarch Beach -- which 
is one of the last large undeveloped coastal properties in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo-based Nippon Shinpan Co., which owns Japan's largest credit card company, 
said it will pay "well over" $100 million to acquire the property held by 
Qintex Australia Ltd., the troubled Australian entertainment and resort 
company. The Japanese company said it plans to invest more than $300 million to 
develop the property, including building two hotels, housing, the enlargement 
and redesign of the Monarch Beach Golf Course and construction of a public 
park. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the sale comes two days after a scheduled public auction 
property was postponed to allow further negotiations between Qintex and its 
creditors. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is to turn the golf course into a "world-championship" caliber course, 
said Robert Rockefeller, vice president of Monarch Bay Resort Inc., a 
development subsidiary formed by the Japanese company. He said Qintex's Laguna 
Niguel subsidiary, the former owner of the property, will be involved in the 
future development plans. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition price of more than $100 million includes the payment of about 
$60 million of debt owed to Balcor Co., the property's first mortgage holder. 
The rest will be paid to "associated interests," Rockefeller said. He declined 
to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese company also plans to construct a public beach house and 
restaurant fronting the Monarch Beach Resort, Rockefeller said, adding that it 
will also extend the public access system to connect the two hotels to the Salt 
Creek Beach parking lot and trail systems. 
</P>
<P>
"This development is far superior than previous proposals for the property," 
Rockefeller said. He also said that designs for the project will be submitted 
in three months and that construction should start in late 1991. Nippon 
Shinpan, Japan's largest consumer finance concern, said Yasuda Trust &amp; 
Banking Company Ltd., a large Tokyo-based bank, will provide financing for the 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Until March, Qintex had insisted that it would build a resort at Monarch Beach 
even while it was liquidating its other assets.

JUDGE THROWS OUT A PART OF LAWSUIT AGAINST NORDSTROM 
</P>

<P>
A judge has dismissed part of a Washington state lawsuit against fashion 
retailer Nordstrom Inc. but left intact the state's effort to collect back 
wages for employees who claim that they were coerced into working unpaid 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on a motion by Nordstrom to dismiss the department's lawsuit, King 
County Superior Court Judge Susan Agid on Thursday ruled that the state 
couldn't collect damages or constrain the way Nordstrom pays its employees in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
But Agid upheld the department's efforts to collect back pay for perhaps 
hundreds of Nordstrom employees in Washington state that Labor and Industries 
contends were coerced to work without pay. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Department of Labor and Industries in February found that 
Nordstrom had violated state labor laws by failing to pay some employees for 
such things as attending company meetings, writing customer thank-you notes and 
making deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
Nordstrom admitted that there were some errors in tracking employee time and 
established a $15-million reserve to pay workers. 
</P>
<P>
But the company denied deliberate violations of wage and hour laws. It sued 
Labor and Industries, contending that the department's findings denied them due 
process. 
</P>
<P>
The state countersued in April and asked that Nordstrom be forced to pay 
damages double the amount of money owed workers. That amount has not been 
determined. State attorneys indicated that they may appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the retailer reported Friday that its earnings declined 7% despite 
an 11% increase in sales during the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The company said profit for the quarter ended Oct. 31 amounted to $20.4 million 
on $634.9 million in sales, compared to $22 million on $572.4 million in sales 
for the same period last year.

Mortgage Rates Down: Fixed-rate mortgages averaged 10.09% this week, down from 
10.13% last week, according to a national survey released by the Federal Home 
Loan Mortgage Corp. On one-year adjustable rate mortgages, lenders were asking 
an average initial rate of 8.09%, down from 8.15% last week. The rates do not 
include add-on fees known as points.

Newspaper Unions Reiterate Offer: Striking workers at the New York Daily News, 
trying to depict themselves as flexible, reiterated that they are ready to take 
the same pay cuts that their colleagues did at the New York Post two months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
In September, unions at the Post took pay cuts of up to 20% to keep the paper 
open. Union President George McDonald made the statement after News Publisher 
James Hoge said union negotiators had offered only small concessions. News 
spokeswoman Lisa Robinson said McDonald "should learn that the place for 
negotiations is at the bargaining table, not at a news conference."

HOWARD ROSENBERG: 'THE BIG ONE': AN 8.0 ON THE HOKEYNESS SCALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Dig out those earthquake-preparedness kits. 
</P>
<P>
Today's subject is "The Big One: the Great Los Angeles Earthquake," NBC's 
virtual remake of the 1974 theatrical movie "Earthquake." While watching it, 
you do feel something splitting. Unfortunately, it's your head. 
</P>
<P>
"The Big One" airs in two parts, at 9 p.m. Sunday and Monday on Channels 4, 36 
and 39. And it would be something if this disaster of a disaster story were to 
be an even greater catalyst for national earthquake awareness than that recent 
real-life disaster, the San Francisco quake of 1989. But don't bet on it. 
</P>
<P>
Of more immediate interest to NBC than public service is just how big the "The 
Big One" -- aptly named for a sweeps-month spectacular -- will loom in the 
Nielsens at a time when the ratings race among the Big Three networks is much 
tighter than in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The original movie had the distinction of being able to demolish all of Los 
Angeles without budging the toupees worn by several of its male stars. Beyond 
that, it was comically bad, with Victoria Principal being assaulted among the 
ruins by a creepy sex fiend and Charlton Heston having to rescue Ava Gardner 
from a sewer. 
</P>
<P>
"The Big One" is equally bad, with the added bonus of being still slower and an 
hour longer than the original, even without commercials. 
</P>
<P>
As in "Earthquake," a government seismologist activates the plot in "The Big 
One," her prophesies of doom initially going unheeded. Claire Winslow (Joanna 
Kerns) calculates that Los Angeles is on the verge of a giant quake that will 
cause mass destruction and thousands of deaths, and she wants to warn the 
public. But her warnings are scoffed at, and -- shades of jeopardy movies from 
"Jaws" to "China Syndrome" -- economic interests take precedence over public 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
Claire gets the brushoff from the mayor's top aide (Joe Spano), who's secretly 
on the take from a furtive Donald Trump-style land developer (Robert Ginty) who 
fears that a scare over the Big One would drive down property values and cost 
him millions. 
</P>
<P>
She gets the brushoff from her plodding husband (Dan Lauria), who doesn't want 
to jeopardize his lucrative landscaping contract with the same land developer. 
"Go easy," he tells her. 
</P>
<P>
She gets the brushoff from her volatile daughter (Holly Fields), who, 
handicapped by being a teen-ager, is too busy sneering at her mother to worry 
about earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
She gets the brushoff from her wealthy parents (Stephen Elliott and Bonnie 
Bartlett), who live in a posh high-rise that they insist is "earthquake-proof." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Claire is hounded by an unscrupulous TV reporter (Richard Masur), 
her sister (Lindsay Frost) is carrying on with a motorcycle cop (Alan Autry) to 
the dismay of her snobby mother, and her maid (Sylvana Gallardo) has hocked her 
music box to buy her son a watch. 
</P>
<P>
And, oh yes, an Aryan-looking assassin is in town, getting a bead on a visiting 
black South African dignitary (Brock Peters) who is being touted as the next 
prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Californians don't have to be told that underestimating the threat of 
earthquakes is a mistake, and just where and when the Big One is coming has 
been debated by experts for years. But a hackneyed treatment like this -- so 
predictably plotted that the only real suspense comes in speculating who will 
get bopped on the head or swallowed by the earth -- seems only to trivialize 
the danger. 
</P>
<P>
You get the inevitable rumble, rumble, Blowie!, a whopping 8.0 on the Richter 
scale. You also get some stupendous hokeyness that registers about an 8.0. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the assassination subplot is an epicenter of foolishness and has 
to be seen to be believed. Even as the city is in the throes of a 7.2 
aftershock, the miraculously surviving assassin continues to hold his position 
-- on the roof of a building that is rocking back and forth -- and blast away 
at his intended victim from long range. Great, an earthquake comedy. 
</P>
<P>
There's another brief sequence that may amuse Angelenos. When word of the 
impending Big One finally does leak, the city panics and the freeways jam up 
with motorists trying to flee. The ensuing gridlock may shock viewers 
elsewhere, but residents here will recognize the pictures as actual footage of 
just another day on the Los Angeles freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, here's some advice: Ignore Sunday's Part 1 and skip to Monday's 
rocking and rolling, for even on a small screen, Larry Fuentes' special effects 
have an impact. Otherwise, loosen your seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
By skipping Part 1, you'll also miss the NBC News program that follows at 10:50 
p.m., with Maria Shriver interviewing experts about issues raised by the 
fictional TV drama. Undoubtedly, the news program will be crammed with crucial 
information, as much as you can cram into 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Although hardly new at NBC, this kind of unnatural pairing -- attaching a brief 
news addendum to a larger fictional drama to give the latter credibility -- is 
yet another example of entertainment being the dog that wags the news 
division's tail. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Kerns got the obligatory show-promoting interview on NBC's "Today" 
program Friday ("Are the experts going to know this as much in advance as you 
do?" Deborah Norville asked her about Claire, as if Kerns herself were an 
expert). And you can just bet that those smoothies at KNBC Channel 4 have been 
dreaming of ways to tie their local newscasts to "The Big One" as well. The 
possibilities are endless. 
</P>
<P>
What to do when your aphrodisiac fails during an earthquake? Tune in.

FINGER-POINTING OVER THE S.F. FESTIVAL THAT FAILED; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS: ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE OPERATION OF FESTIVAL 2000 HAS BECOME A MAJOR 
ISSUE FOR MANY ARTISTS AND ARTS ADMINISTRATORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As in a classic "Who-done-it?" mystery, members of the arts community here are 
pointing fingers over who's responsible for the Festival 2000 debacle, the 
failed $2.3-million multicultural arts program that finished $500,000 in debt. 
</P>
<P>
People want to know if the October festival was overly ambitious in scope and 
whether the city of San Francisco should have kept tighter reins on executive 
director Lenwood Sloan and his 20-member staff. 
</P>
<P>
Sloan, who recently left town to take a new job with the National Endowment for 
the Arts in Washington, acknowledged making mistakes. But he said in an 
interview here that those calling for financial "autopsy reports" are 
overlooking the festival's artistic achievements. "The festival cannot be 
measured from Oct. 6 to 23," he said, referring to the official run dates. 
</P>
<P>
But he admitted blunders were made. "My mistake, in so far as managing goes, 
was being blinded by my vision, being focused on the future dividends and not 
hiring a P.T. Barnum, whose focus would be on getting bodies to the events." 
</P>
<P>
Accountability for Festival 2000's operation and budget -- $1.8 million raised 
from the city, the Rockefeller Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, 
box office receipts and other sources -- has become an overriding issue for 
many artists and arts administrators. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody added up the numbers and said, 'You can't do this,"' said Bruce W. 
Davis, vice president of the San Francisco Arts Democratic Club who has 
produced many city festivals, including the annual San Francisco Ethnic Dance 
Festival. "No matter how noble your artistic vision is, or righteous the cause 
is, wishful thinking won't change the numbers. It looks like nobody asked the 
question. It almost had the feeling of 'Our Gang' -- 'Let's do a show! Darla, 
you do the costumes; Spanky, you set up the lights. "' 
</P>
<P>
Plenty of questions are being asked now, especially after Wednesday's decision 
by the festival's board of directors to declare bankruptcy. Letters to 
creditors were sent out Thursday and attorney Suzanne Smith filed for Chapter 7 
bankruptcy on behalf of the nonprofit organization Friday morning. A trustee 
will liquidate the festival's assets, estimated to be worth about $75,000, 
before doling out what little funds there are to creditors, according to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"We are literally out of business," said board member Al Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Two city agencies -- the San Francisco Arts Commission and Grants for the Arts 
Program -- have agreed to a $100,000 bail-out of two dozen individuals and arts 
groups that didn't receive their full payments for festival participation. But 
others, including some national arts groups, remain thousands of dollars in the 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Supervisor Terence Hallinan has called for a Dec. 13 hearing to 
review how the festival spent the city's $500,000 seed money. "I'm just after 
what happened," he said. "You'd have to say that Mr. Sloan is where the ball 
stops, or starts. He devoted his energies to the artistic part of it, and no 
one was around to pick up the other end of it. Somebody should have been 
checking up on things." 
</P>
<P>
The supervisor plans to question the role of Kary Schulman, whose agency Grants 
for the Arts provided Sloan with half-a-million dollars from the city's hotel 
occupancy tax fund, seemingly with few strings attached. 
</P>
<P>
Schulman says it is not under her purview to keep tabs on nonprofit groups. 
"We're a small office, and we give funding to the arts," she said. "Had anyone 
wanted to call us, we would have given advice. But this is not a technical 
assistance office." 
</P>
<P>
Sloan said even though the festival lost money, there will be artistic 
"dividends" from the festival. There has been increased national interest in 
some of the festival's artists and performers, such as a visual arts exhibit 
that will tour the country. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a relay race, and the last runner stumbled," he said. "The question is, 
was the race worth it? The focus has been on the money and not on the work. The 
whole thing has been taken out of context." 
</P>
<P>
As for his resignation, Sloan said he left San Francisco for the NEA job -- 
which he assumed two weeks earlier than announced -- for a simple reason. "I 
have to pay the rent." He said he had not been paid by the festival since Oct. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
Sloan acknowledged he erred by "not measuring the recessionary climate" and 
"overreacting to the festival's initial response from individuals and 
corporations." But he also said his work was plagued by politics. 
</P>
<P>
"San Francisco is a political place; no one there operates outside of the 
politics. I operated by referendum. When the visual artists wanted to be 
represented, they were and the budget grew by $400,000. The same with a schools 
component. They were added and the budget grew by $150,000. Right down to the 
last day, we were hearing, 'Our community was never asked to participate in the 
dialogue,' and 'We're being left out."' 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone wanted to be front stage in this festival," festival organizer Davis 
observed. "I guess he loved to say, 'Yes.' No is a hard word." 
</P>
<P>
Schulman said the festival may have grown too big, too fast. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said competing interests, and the battle to stay under budget, comes with 
the turf. 
</P>
<P>
"The festival was rooted in politics; it started on a political premise, that 
multicultural arts aren't getting their just share of the pie. It was almost a 
mission impossible to keep politics out of it. 
</P>
<P>
"They failed miserably, and at a great cost and grief to people," he said. 
"People are angry. San Francisco is proud of the fact that it has one of the 
strongest professional arts communities in the country. Here was a moment of 
glory that got covered with mud. We need to figure out what went wrong."

POLL TALK AND A NEW 'WISEGUY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There will be plenty of talk about California's new governor to-be and other 
election results on the small screen this weekend. But there's also a new 
"Wiseguy," a new Japanese emperor and finally the identity of the killer of 
Laura Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
The new "Wiseguy" is Steven Bauer as the CBS (2)(8) series that once starred 
Ken Wahl returns for another season tonight at 9 p.m. The two-hour premiere 
also stars Maximilian Schell and pop singer Martika. 
</P>
<P>
ABC (7)(3)(10)(42) will compete with its own wiseguy, David Lynch, the 
eccentric director who both directs and stars in tonight's 10 p.m. episode of 
"Twin Peaks," in which the network promises to reveal the murderer of Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
And Sunday at 7:45 p.m., KSCI Channel 18 will televise live the enthronement 
ceremony of Emperor Akihito as the 125th emperor of Japan. Heads of state and 
dignitaries from 150 countries including Vice President Quayle and England's 
Prince Charles are expected in Tokyo for the event.

WILL WEISMAN GIFT WORK WONDERS IN SAN DIEGO?; 
</P>
<P>
ART: LACKLUSTER MUSEUM HAS AN ENVIABLE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD ON A NEW FOUNDATION 
OF IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA WORKS.

If Walter Annenberg were to donate his exceptional collection of Impressionist 
and Post-Impressionist paintings to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, where 
they are on temporary display through Sunday, the gift would instantaneously 
transform the museum's holdings. Overnight, a respectable museum collection 
would become an internationally prominent repository for late European 
painting. 
</P>
<P>
By stark contrast, a similar gift to, say, the Metropolitan Museum, the 
Philadelphia Museum, the National Gallery or any other art-rich repository 
wouldn't have anywhere near the same impact. All of those institutions would 
likely appreciate the magnanimous windfall, and all of them could make good use 
of the paintings. But, at any one of them, the gift would rank as just one 
among many important private assemblies donated over the years. The Annenberg 
collection would be readily absorbed into an already substantive pool of 
Western art. 
</P>
<P>
Precisely where a private collection goes public is, in the end, as important 
as the fact that it's going public at all. Such gifts to museums can have 
strategic purposes -- and ultimately should have, if the greatest public 
benefit is to be served. The abundant fruits of a private collector's labors 
can give clarity and focus to an otherwise shapeless public repository, or 
provide much-needed depth to an assembly of art that only skims the surface. 
And a transformative donation like that can yield results that will profoundly 
affect an institution far into the future. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence of the sudden, sharp difference that can be made by strategic 
placement came not long ago from the surprise announcement that the Frederick 
R. Weisman Art Foundation has given a significant group of 33 paintings and 
sculptures by several prominent Californians to the San Diego Museum of Art. 
The scale of the gift is certainly far less exalted and dramatic than an 
Annenberg benefaction would be. But the principle is the same. In the context 
of the San Diego Museum, where officials are now busily planning the spring 
debut of the Weisman gift, it could have far-reaching implications. 
</P>
<P>
News of the Weisman donation came as a surprise because, several months ago, 
when rumors began to circulate that a gift to an unspecified California museum 
was in the works, a host of institutions seemed likely candidates. The San 
Diego Museum of Art, safe to say, was not high on any observer's list. Of the 
state's numerous museums, it is hardly one that has distinguished itself either 
in the brilliance of its collections or the sustained verve of its programming. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition program has been generally tepid. Exhibitions tend toward the 
popular or the pleasantly benign, such as last year's displays of Faberge eggs 
and of the Spanish Impressionist Joaquin Sorolla, or the 1988 Cecil Beaton 
showcase. A real eye-opener hasn't occupied the special exhibition galleries 
for a very long time (the last was no doubt the 1986 touring retrospective of 
Bauhaus artist Oskar Schlemmer). And in the past decade, the museum itself has 
organized few shows of note, relying instead on packaged exhibitions from 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
As for art made in California, the most recent substantive effort was a 
sprawling survey of sculpture mounted 10 years ago, in the summer of 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Like most provincial museums in the United States, the San Diego Museum boasts 
a collection long on minor art by major names, of quaint workshop pictures from 
otherwise notable European schools, and of once fashionable decorative objects 
that, commonly, find their way into public collections as a result of travels 
to exotic locales by distinguished pillars of local society. If it's lucky, a 
provincial collection is given spice by an item or two of unusual merit -- the 
kind of thing that becomes a magnet for cognoscenti, like an art-world 
trademark. The chief example at the nearly 70-year-old institution in Balboa 
Park is the odd, startlingly modern, meditative still life, "Quince, Cabbage, 
Melon and Cucumber," painted around 1602 by a Carthusian monk, Juan Sanchez 
Cotan. One among a small but respectable group of Spanish Baroque pictures, 
it's the justifiably acclaimed standout in the museum's collection and one of 
the great paintings of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
More to the point of the Weisman gift, the museum's assembly of 20th-Century 
art is, save for isolated examples, negligible, and its holdings in 
contemporary art made in California exceedingly thin. On a recent visit, a 
scant three works by Californians were on view: unimpressive 1980s figurative 
sculptures by Manuel Neri and Deborah Butterfield (a San Diego native) and 
Wayne Thiebaud's small 1962 painting "Caged Pie." 
</P>
<P>
There is admitted irony to the choice of an institution unable to claim a track 
record of conspicuous excellence as recipient of a $1.5-million gift of 
paintings and sculptures. This is especially true in light of the proximity of 
other museums that can indeed make such claims -- most obviously, the San Diego 
Museum of Contemporary Art in nearby La Jolla, the Newport Harbor Art Museum up 
the road a piece or even the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. Right 
about now those outposts must be wondering if a languid, relatively disengaged 
program is in fact the hidden road to success with benefactors. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, the gift to the San Diego Museum of Art does make strategic sense. In 
one stroke, the Weisman donation elevates contemporary California art to the 
status of a significant focus for the collection -- likely the only focus with 
the capacity to develop substantively in the future. That factor may have 
played a part in the willingness of the museum, apparently alone among its 
rivals for the Weisman holdings, to set aside permanent exhibition space solely 
for California art. 
</P>
<P>
Roughly half of the gift is composed of works that any museum would be eager to 
have. Aside from a terrific 1962 assemblage-sculpture by Bruce Connor, who 
works in the Bay Area, it principally includes art by Southern Californians: 
John McLaughlin, John Altoon, Craig Kauffman, Ron Davis, Robert Irwin, Edward 
Ruscha and John Baldessari, as well as the younger artists Alexis Smith, Matt 
Mullican and Tim Ebner. Clearly, the assembly leaves considerable room for 
development in several areas, should the museum decide to concentrate on 
filling out a representative display of art made in California since the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
That effort would be worthwhile. With cleverness and skill, the San Diego 
Museum of Art could transform itself into something rather common in Europe but 
quite rare in the United States: a museum located outside the central art 
capitals, but one that gains enviable significance as a repository for the art 
of the region. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the gift means that a museum that has always lacked a strong artistic 
identity is suddenly within reach of one. The absence of a strong identity, 
which is not a problem for La Jolla, Newport or MOCA, is the paradoxical 
ingredient that seems to have made the San Diego Museum of Art the perfect 
strategic choice. Whether the museum will, through future acquisitions and 
exhibition programs in the field of contemporary California art, refine and 
sharpen that profile with diligence and vigor remains to be seen. Yet for the 
institution and its community, the Weisman donation has offered both art and a 
golden opportunity.

RELIGION BRIEFS: 3,000 JEWS, CHRISTIANS TURN OUT TO HEAR RABBI

He has become America's best-known rabbi. 
</P>
<P>
More evidence of the popularity of Rabbi Harold S. Kushner came in late October 
when about 3,000 Christians and Jews overflowed Temple Israel here to hear the 
best-selling author talk about "Who Needs God," the title of his latest book. 
</P>
<P>
Scores more were turned away. 
</P>
<P>
Kushner told the throng that he wrote "Who Needs God" for Phil Donahue, the 
television talk show host, who "represents good, decent, caring and committed 
individuals who have only scorn for organized religion." 
</P>
<P>
His talk was sponsored by the Center for Jewish-Christian Learning at the 
University of St. Thomas, St. Paul, in cooperation with the St. Paul Seminary 
School of Divinity. Its thesis was that in contemporary society people "have 
become so sophisticated, modern and intellectual that they don't have room for 
a faith commitment. They don't realize what they've given up. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we can do everything and there is no room for a power greater than 
us," the rabbi said. Yet, he said, "without spiritual nourishment our souls 
remain stunted and undeveloped."

SECOND BLAZE BURNS BRIEFLY AT PENDLETON; 
</P>

BRUSH FIRES: THIS ONE SCORCHES ABOUT 200 ACRES JUST EAST OF THE THREE-DAY FIRE. 
BOTH ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION.

Another brush fire broke out Friday morning in the Camp Pendleton hills, just 
east of the acreage scorched in a dramatic three-day fire earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Marine Cpl. Connie Panichi said the latest fire burned 200 acres and lasted 
from about 11:15 a.m. to 2 p.m., bringing to about 5,000 acres the total amount 
blackened by fire this week on and near the Marine Corps base. 
</P>
<P>
As in the earlier fire, the cause of Friday's blaze is "under investigation," 
Panichi said. Reports that the earlier fire, which started Tuesday night, was 
sparked by military maneuvers could not be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no word at all on anything like that," Panichi said. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Dan Young, a spokesman for the Orange County Fire Department, said the 
location of a fire's beginning can usually be determined quickly. He added that 
if something like downed power lines ignited the fire, that would probably 
already have been determined. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the time, investigators can identify at least where a fire started 
within minutes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Stubbs, a spokesman for the San Clemente Fire Department, the first 
department called to assist Camp Pendleton firefighters Tuesday evening, said 
he was convinced that the blaze was not arson. 
</P>
<P>
"Downed wires are what our people are talking about now," Stubbs said. "I am 
satisfied it was not arson or a Marine maneuver-related start." 
</P>
<P>
Stubbs, who was at San Clemente City Hall working on election results when the 
fire call came in about 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, said the inordinately strong winds 
were the reason the fire burned until about 4 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Our firefighters were saying that the wind gusts were up to 65 m.p.h., maybe 
higher," Stubbs said. "When you charge up a hose line, turn on the water and 
then see it blown right back in your face, it makes conventional firefighting 
equipment seem pretty inadequate. We have veteran firefighters here who have 
seen a lot of fires, and they said this was exceptionally bad." 
</P>
<P>
Young said his firefighters estimated the wind gusts hit 80 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"That fire jumped Interstate 5 like it was nothing," Young added. 
</P>
<P>
About 450 firefighters, 71 fire engines and four bulldozers from 12 fire 
agencies worked on the three-day blaze, but only one injury was reported. San 
Juan Capistrano firefighter Shawn Barret suffered an injured ankle. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a pretty good safety record," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
Young warned that the fire season has a long way to go. 
</P>
<P>
"November is historically the worst fire month in this area, probably all over 
Southern California," he said. "We need some rain, not one day of rain, but 
three or four good days of rain, before we are out of trouble. It is very dry 
out there."

GROCERY CLERK FROM LA HABRA ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL IN DEATH CAMP KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SCHWARTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bruno Karl Blach, the retired grocery clerk from La Habra who was extradited to 
Germany earlier this year on war crimes charges, has been ordered to stand 
trial in a German court on a single count of murder, authorities in that 
country said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A three-judge panel from a regional court in Duisburg dismissed two other 
counts of murder because of insufficient evidence, but found that enough 
evidence existed to try Blach on the remaining charge of murdering a 
concentration camp prisoner during World War II, said Presiding Regional Court 
Judge Hermann Oberscheidt, in an interview Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, however, immediately filed an appeal to have the additional 
charges reinstated, Oberscheidt said. A higher court should consider that 
appeal within the next few weeks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The trial of Mr. Blach will probably begin sometime in the spring," 
Oberscheidt said. In the meantime, Blach, 70, remains in custody in Duisburg, a 
river port and industrial city about 45 miles north of Cologne in the state of 
North Rhine-Westphalia. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors declined to comment on the case, citing German law that forbids 
such comment once the court has ordered a defendant to stand trial. Blach's 
attorney in Duisburg, Ilona Bruns, was ill Friday and also unavailable for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Blach, a native of Czechoslovakia, joined the Nazi Party in January, 1939, 
according to U.S. government documents. In 1940, U.S. officials claim, Blach 
joined the Waffen-SS unit and was assigned to the SS Totenkopf (Death's Head 
Battalion) at Dachau in Germany. He served there until the middle of 1943, when 
he transferred to Wiener-Neudorf, a suburb of Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1945, authorities contend, Blach killed concentration camp prisoners 
during a forced march from a camp in Wiener-Neudorf to a larger camp in 
Mauthausen, 125 miles to the west. 
</P>
<P>
Aleksy Bialas, a concentration camp survivor now living in Niagara Falls, 
Canada, testified during Blach's deportation proceedings that he saw Blach 
throw an enfeebled prisoner into a ditch and then machine-gun the man to death 
in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him (the victim)," Bialas testified. "I can't ever forget. The old chap 
was looking at me when he died." 
</P>
<P>
Blach was ordered deported in 1987 after immigration officials charged that the 
former Nazi guard and dog handler had entered the country illegally in 1956. 
Until deportation proceedings began in 1985, Blach and his wife had lived 
quietly for many years in a tract home on South Walnut Street in La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
Blach appealed the deportation order, but he waived extradition to Germany when 
authorities there filed charges against him, saying he wanted to clear himself 
of the allegations. Blach has disputed the charges, saying that he was a 
low-ranking guard who had no part in any mistreatment of prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Blach's co-defendant in the case, 68-year-old Dominick Gleba of Oberhausen, 
Germany, was also ordered to stand trial on a single count of murder, 
Oberscheidt said. Gleba is also accused of murdering prisoners during the death 
march to Mauthausen. A second count of murder was dismissed, but Oberscheidt 
said prosecutors are seeking to reinstate that charge as well.

PROPOSAL TO DOUBLE MEDFLY TRAPS PUT OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to objections raised by Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, Orange County 
agricultural officials have agreed to delay a proposal that would double the 
number of Medfly traps in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which involves approving a "plant pest prevention contract" with 
the state, was to have been considered by the Board of Supervisors at its 
Tuesday meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Late Friday, however, Stanton circulated a letter to his colleagues registering 
his strong opposition to the contract. 
</P>
<P>
"The item which is before us today is not a mandated program . . . but a 
discretionary 'pilot program' which would double the number of Medfly trap 
sites from approximately 1,500 to 3,000," Stanton said in his letter. "It is 
logical to assume that an increase in trap sites would also increase the 
probability of trapping another Medfly and again subjecting the citizens of 
Orange County to repeated aerial sprayings of malathion."

VOTERS REELECT COOK, BUT NEAL LOSES SEAT

<P>
Mayor Laurann Cook overwhelmingly won reelection to the City Council, but 
voters ousted incumbent James E. Neal. Seats were won by community leader John 
Collins and Guy Carozzo, a retired high school principal. 
</P>
<P>
"I was elated and very pleased that the citizens expressed their confidence in 
me by showing their wide support," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
Collins said he was surprised that he defeated Neal and speculated that strong 
name recognition associated with his involvement in several community 
organizations helped him get the votes. 
</P>
<P>
"Serving on the council is just a logical extension of everything I have done 
for the community in the last 17 years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Carozzo had been something of a dark-horse candidate, and he attributed his 
victory to his promise not to accept campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever asked what I wanted for the city, I answered by asking them what they 
wanted me to do," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
Cook's term as mayor will end Dec. 4, when the position -- which is rotated 
every two years among council members -- will go to the person next in line 
based on seniority and council approval.ROSE APODACA

VETERANS CITE BACKING FOR CALL-UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the massive military buildup and talk of war, Orange County veterans are 
hoping for peace in the Persian Gulf, but most say they will back President 
Bush should conflict come. 
</P>
<P>
As Veterans Day approaches, leaders of half a dozen local veterans groups say 
they support the call-up of hundreds of thousands of troops this week, making 
the gulf deployment the largest commitment of U.S. forces in a foreign country 
since Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
And several veterans groups were mobilizing themselves Friday to provide 
support for the families of soldiers called to gulf duty. 
</P>
<P>
The people in the United States are behind today's servicemen, said World War 
II Navy veteran Julian A. Ramos, who survived the sinking of his ship. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a different attitude now, like it was in World War II," said Ramos, 
who heads the 90-member Veterans of Foreign Wars post in San Juan Capistrano. 
"There's better togetherness now. Guess those guys from the Vietnam War are 
getting old and their attitudes are changing." 
</P>
<P>
"We belong there and we are doing what we are supposed to do," said Mission 
Viejo VFW Post Cmdr. Edward J. Kearns, who served in both World War II and the 
Korean War. "If we let that madman (Saddam Hussein) go the way he wants, we'll 
have a holocaust on our hands." 
</P>
<P>
Kearns said most of his fellow veterans agree, including the Vietnam veterans 
in his post. 
</P>
<P>
"All veterans are veterans. There's no difference. Everyone's blood runs the 
same color," Kearns said. 
</P>
<P>
"The general consensus shows full support for the President and for the 
families left behind," said Lelia Crandall, who served in the Women's Army 
Corps in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The American Legion has set up an Emergency Action Line toll-free number to 
help servicemen's relatives, Crandall said. The VFW has started a similar 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll take them to the doctor, help with the children and even do yardwork," 
the Santa Ana veteran said. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam Navy veteran Bill Siler, past commander of the Santa Ana American 
Legion Post and a past district commander in Orange County, said there is a 
split in whether the President is following the right course. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of our people think (the President's action) is OK and some don't, but 
the majority of American Legion vets support the military no matter what they 
are ordered to do," Siler said. 
</P>
<P>
Most veterans contacted discounted the significance of those domestic critics 
who have dissented from U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf, including the massive 
military call-up this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're really radical about anything now," Siler said. "That 
period of time is behind us and we have to do other things. We don't need 
another Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
At the Garden Grove VFW post there are no differences of opinion, according to 
Robert W. Hess, an Army sergeant in World War II.. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is favorable to the President in this situation, but if, if need be, 
get it over," he said. "We are all waiting as long as we can." HERBERT J. VIDA

SCIENCE FOUNDATION GRANTS UCI $40,000

<P>
The National Science Foundation has given UC Irvine $40,000 to help build a 
program that encourages minorities to become scientists and science teachers. 
</P>
<P>
The four-month grant will support the campus's Comprehensive Alliance for 
Minority Participation program, a new partnership between UC Irvine, the 
California State University campuses, community colleges, high schools and the 
private sector. 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine's program is aimed at increasing the number of minority college 
students, especially blacks, American Indians, Filipinos and Latinos, who seek 
advanced science degrees or want to become science teachers. The grant was 
awarded to L. Dennis Smith, UC Irvine's executive vice chancellor, and Eloy 
Rodriguez, a professor of biology and toxicology.

DANNEMEYER SPEAKS AGAINST ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC HAMILTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. William Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) told a group of Cal State Fullerton 
students Friday that the war on abortion can be won only through persistence 
and courage. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Berlin) Wall came down without any military action," Dannemeyer told some 
60 students, most of them anti-abortion advocates. "It was done by human 
beings, and was gradually broken away." 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer's noon appearance was sponsored by the Students for Life Coalition, 
a newly formed anti-abortion group on campus. 
</P>
<P>
The congressman, a longtime outspoken critic of abortion, attacked liberals and 
told the students there must be a return to a basic Judeo-Christian ethic 
system that this country was founded on. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin La Point, a 21-year-old senior psychology major who formed the campus 
group in September, said he was pleased with the turnout. 
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be a growing interest in our group," La Point said, adding that 
the coalition plans to eventually hook up with other colleges in the Southland. 
"So far, we've had about 195 people express an interest in the group." 
</P>
<P>
La Point said he believes there are many students who are generally concerned 
about the abortion issue but do not know where to turn. With speakers like 
Dannemeyer, La Point said, the coalition should be able to get more exposure. 
</P>
<P>
While most of the audience seemed to side with Dannemeyer's position on 
abortion, some students attending thought he was out of step with the majority 
of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"The man is one big contradiction," said Nathan Wells, a 20-year-old junior. 
"He continually talks about how morally corrupt our society is becoming and how 
we must protect the unborn. But in the same breath, he talks about our 
justification in being in the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Jane Feltz, 19, who sat quietly in the back during Dannemeyer's 
speech, said she is having a lot of trouble grappling with the abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very difficult situation," she said. "At times I think it should remain 
legal. Then, I think it shouldn't. I just haven't made up my mind." ERIC 
HAMILTON

Individuals and corporations wishing to support the D.A.R.E. program in Anaheim 
elementary schools can now make donations to the city earmarked for that 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Since its inception, the anti-drug education program has relied mostly on state 
and federal grants. The police department hopes that the donations will ensure 
the survival of the D.A.R.E. program. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, four Anaheim police officers operate the program, teaching about 
2,500 of the city's fifth-grade students about the dangers of drug abuse.

WALLS IS UP TO HIS OLD TRICKS; 
</P>
<P>
NFL: AT 30, FORMER DALLAS COWBOY CORNERBACK IS BACK IN THE SADDLE WITH THE NEW 
YORK GIANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No wonder Everson Walls is feeling like a kid again. After all, age is relative 
. . . even in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the 30-year-old cornerback played for the Dallas Cowboys, a team 
that had only one starter older than him. If he had stayed with the Cowboys 
this year, he would have been the third-oldest player on their roster. 
</P>
<P>
But Dallas, obviously wrapped up in a serious youth movement, left Walls 
unprotected after the 1989 season. And New York Giants Coach Bill Parcells was 
more than glad to grab another proven veteran. 
</P>
<P>
Parcells, you see, has made a habit of this sort of reclamation project. 
Running back O.J. Anderson. Safety Dave Duerson. Linebackers Lawrence McGrew 
and Johnie Cooks. Quarterback Matt Cavanaugh. Kicker Matt Bahr. Together, they 
have 76 years of NFL experience -- 68 of them on other teams. 
</P>
<P>
In case you're wondering about the wisdom of this over-the-hill-gang approach, 
check the standings. The Giants are 8-0. Dallas is 3-6. Everson Walls has four 
interceptions. The Cowboys have four interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Enough said? 
</P>
<P>
Well, not if you're talking to Walls. He's got plenty more to say. 
</P>
<P>
"I never had doubts about what I could do, but I really had doubts about 
whether I'd ever get a chance to show what I could do in another organization, 
under another system," he said. "(In Dallas), there was a lot of man-to-man, 
playing behind the flex defensive line, which didn't provide much pressure, 
especially on first and second down when the flex was always playing run. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, in (Dallas Coach) Jimmy Johnson's zone last year, we didn't have much 
pressure, and you can't play zone without a pass rush. Meanwhile, you've got a 
lot of defensive backs getting all the praise, playing behind a front seven 
such as this one. So now it's real nice to be sitting up and looking at it from 
the other side." 
</P>
<P>
It's not as if Walls went unnoticed during his nine-year career with the 
Cowboys. He went to the Pro Bowl after his rookie season of 1981, when he burst 
onto the scene with 11 interceptions. This, after being passed over in the 
draft despite leading the nation with 11 interceptions during his senior year 
at Grambling. 
</P>
<P>
Walls, who grew up in Richardson, Tex., within two miles of the Cowboys' 
training facility, decided to take the shortest route -- literally -- to the 
NFL. He ended up making three more Pro Bowl trips, in '82, '83 and '85, and is 
the only player to lead the league in interceptions three times. He left Dallas 
with 44 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
In just eight games with the Giants, he has pushed that total to 48 and scored 
the first touchdown of his NFL career, intercepting a pass by Stan Humphries 
and returning it 28 yards to cap New York's 21-10 victory over the Washington 
Redskins two weeks ago. He also leads the Giants in passes defensed with 10. 
</P>
<P>
None of this has particularly surprised Parcells, who has insisted since April 
29 when Walls was signed as a Plan B free agent that Walls is one of those 
special players who seems to attract the ball. 
</P>
<P>
As if to prove his new coach right, Walls' first interception came in the 
season opener when Philadelphia quarterback Randall Cunningham rifled a pass 
into congested coverage. Three players dove for the ball, which caromed 
straight up. Then, almost magically, Walls came flying over the pile to snatch 
it in midair. 
</P>
<P>
"Everson has had to make a pretty good transition in the style of play that he 
uses," Parcells said. "He was a man-to-man cover guy in Dallas his whole 
career, and we're predominantly a zone team, much like the Rams. That's been a 
big transition for him. But he's come in and made a real good contribution. 
He's very alert, and he's a smart football player with great instincts." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants are happy to have Walls, and Walls is downright ecstatic to be in 
New York. The situation in Dallas began to deteriorate in a hurry last season 
as the Cowboys lost their first eight games on the way to a 1-15 finish. 
</P>
<P>
"(Johnson) had appointed me captain," Walls said, "but when things go bad, 
you're going to look to the same people you were going to praise when things go 
good. I was a scapegoat. 
</P>
<P>
"This is completely different, of course, like night and day. When you're 
winning, it makes all the things that you've done wrong almost go unnoticed. 
But when you're losing, sometimes the things you do right go unnoticed, and the 
players and coaches start to harp on the negative. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping to get out of that situation, and I was hoping to get involved 
with a team that was doing something as far as winning was concerned and the 
playoffs were concerned. But never did I envision being 8-0. That's pretty much 
unthinkable." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Walls thinks it goes much deeper than victories and losses. He says even 
the glory days in Dallas can't match these New York minutes, every one of which 
he savors. 
</P>
<P>
"(Former Dallas Coach Tom) Landry always broke down the films on a championship 
level," Walls said. "If we didn't play up to Super Bowl caliber every week, 
which you really can't do . . . well, we would beat some teams by three 
touchdowns and come out (of film sessions) feeling like we lost the ballgame. 
We got used to a lot of criticism." 
</P>
<P>
Parcells hasn't had many occasions to chastise the Giants' defense, which ranks 
second in the league, first against the pass. But Walls could have ended up 
looking at horror films again this season. He almost ended up in the secondary 
that will be facing the Giants' offense Sunday in Anaheim Stadium. Yes, he 
almost ended up with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Walls and the Rams had discussions before the draft this spring, but he didn't 
work out in Anaheim because of an ankle sprain he suffered in an offseason 
basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
Parcells, who for nine years had seen what Walls could do on a football field, 
didn't think a couple of 40-yard dashes and an agility run through some tires 
would prove anything. So New York signed Walls without a workout. 
</P>
<P>
"I was serious about coming to the Rams, but I had to look at the money and the 
chance of putting a number of years into the organization," Walls said. "The 
(Ram) coaches said they would give me the chance of playing a couple of years, 
but I felt I had more than a couple of years left in me. So I felt I was 
restricted before they even looked at me. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, it was wide open as far as what my achievements could be. The feeling 
was a little more secure here than in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
For Walls, security means no longer feeling like Old Man River in the locker 
room. It means no longer having to force a style of leadership he found 
uncomfortable in Dallas. It means hanging out with peers such as Duerson, the 
former Bear safety who rooms with Walls on the road and whose locker is 
adjacent to his. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the pressure has been taken off of me, in terms of having to provide 
almost sole leadership in Dallas," he said. "We've got a lot of older guys 
who've been through as many big-time wars as I have. I can go out on the field 
and not have to say anything. Those guys do all the talking. I don't have to be 
the pumped, rah-rah type of guy. That never was my style, and we've got guys 
here who thrive on that type of intensity. All I do is feed off them. 
</P>
<P>
"I still try to provide knowledge to the younger guys, but now I have to absorb 
knowledge about the defense, too. I've got guys 22, 23 years old telling me 
what the coaches expect out of this defense and that defense." 
</P>
<P>
Who says you can't teach an old dog new tricks? And don't expect this old dog 
to curl up on the porch. He's still chasing receivers with his teeth bared. And 
he figures he'll keep on keeping on until he can't catch them anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the guys keep the big boys off me, and I can sit back there in that 
soft zone, I'd like to be like Ed (Too Tall) Jones if I could," Walls said with 
a laugh. "I'd rather have them tow me off this field with a tow truck. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as I'm making the plays, this organization might be compelled to keep 
me around for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Given the Giants' record and Parcells' penchant for playing veterans of foreign 
wars, who knows how long New York's defensive front will have their backs to 
the Walls?

FAN IS ARRESTED AFTER FULLERTON WINS, 21-12

The aftermath of a Freeway League football game turned ugly Friday night when a 
Fullerton High School fan allegedly struck Buena Park Coach Martin Luczaj. 
</P>
<P>
The fan, identified by police as Joey Hernandez Sr., 38, was detained and then 
released at the scene by Fullerton police officers. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sgt. Neal Baldwin of the Fullerton Police Department, the man was 
released on signed promise to appear in court. Baldwin said the district 
attorney's office would determine if there is sufficient grounds to file 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin said Hernandez was apparently a parent of a Fullerton football player. 
</P>
<P>
Luczaj, who coached at Fullerton from 1981 to 1986 before stepping down as a 
high school football head coach until this season, appeared unhurt as he 
lingered on the field describing the incident to police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Luczaj told officers he was congratulating Fullerton players after the 21-12 
Fullerton victory when a man hit him with his forearm. 
</P>
<P>
"He just walked up to me and hit me," Luczaj told an officer. "There was 
absolutely no provocation whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
The game, which was the finale of the regular season for each team, decided 
second and third place in the league. Fullerton (8-2, 4-1 in the league) 
finished second; Buena Park (5-4, 3-2) finished third. Both teams have 
qualified for the Southern Section Division VI playoffs, which start next 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's defense held Angel Barrios, who entered the game fourth in the 
county in rushing (1,030 yards), to 35 yards on 11 carries -- all in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians also sacked quarterback Mark Medellin five times for 75 yards in 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton quarterback Daniel Chacon threw for two touchdowns in the first half, 
including a 51-yarder to his twin brother, David, with 20 seconds remaining in 
the half. That gave the Indians a 13-6 lead, which they increased to 21-6 on a 
three play 68-yard drive to open the second half.

Quarterback Josh Gingrich threw for a school-record 363 yards and five 
touchdowns to lead Edison High School to a 35-6 victory over Servite in a 
nonleague football game in front of about 4,500 at Orange Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich left the game late in the third quarter, but when Edison Coach Dave 
White discovered he was three yards short of the school single-game passing 
record, he sent Gingrich back in for one play. 
</P>
<P>
He completed a 20-yard pass to Brandon Jessie with three minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Gingrich, a senior, completed 23 of 32 passes with one interception. He was 14 
of 22 for 214 yards and three touchdowns in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"It was nice to see Josh get the record," White said. "I'm not a records type 
of coach. I'm more of a team coach, but when I found out he was only three 
yards away, I decided to put him back in for one more play." 
</P>
<P>
Jessie tied an Edison single-game record with three touchdown catches and had 
165 yards in nine receptions. KEN HILL

For a half, the Katella High School football team looked as if it might spoil 
Esperanza's unblemished regular-season record. But in the second half, it was 
clearly a matchup of two teams going in opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza, buoyed by its dominating running game, defeated Katella, 42-21, to 
complete its first unbeaten regular season since 1980. The Aztecs (10-0, 5-0 in 
league), rushed for 431 yards, highlighted by Jarod Smith's 233 yards and two 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
It offset a stellar performance by Katella quarterback Chris Reed. 
</P>
<P>
Reed passed for 296 yards and teamed with receiver Art Vance to produce four 
school records. 
</P>
<P>
Vance, who caught seven passes for 188 yards and three touchdowns, now holds 
records for most touchdowns caught in a season (eight) and most touchdowns 
caught in a game by a receiver (three). Reed finished the season with 1,634 
yards passing, surpassing Dave Wilson's 1976 single-season and one-game marks 
of 1,358 and 278 yards, respectively. DENNIS KAISER

BIRTCHER CORP. MOVES TO IRVINE, EXPECTS CONFUSION ON NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Compiled by Leslie Berkman, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, Orange County has been the home of a commercial development firm, 
owned by the Birtcher family, that eschews use of labels such as "company" or 
"group" and simply goes by the name Birtcher. 
</P>
<P>
Now there's a new Birtcher organization in the county, one that makes 
electronic surgical instruments. 
</P>
<P>
It has no business connection with the Birtcher development firm in Laguna 
Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
But it shares the Birtcher name because it was founded 53 years ago by a member 
of the same family. 
</P>
<P>
The Birtcher Corp., formerly of El Monte, has moved its corporate headquarters 
to the Irvine Spectrum industrial park to consolidate its operations with those 
of a Denver-based company it acquired last year from C.R. Bard Inc. 
</P>
<P>
In September, about 65 employees transferred from El Monte. And by the end of 
January, 80 positions will be transferred from Denver to Birtcher Corp.'s new 
67,000-square-foot Irvine facility, said Dan Whelan, the company's chief 
financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
Whelan said last year's acquisition was a big step for Birtcher Corp., which 
had only $6.9 million in sales. The C.R. Bard unit it bought has annual sales 
of $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
Birtcher Corp. makes surgical instruments used by dermatologists and plastic 
surgeons, and the acquisition gave it a new line of surgical products to sell 
to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Whelan said that some confusion has arisen from the corporation stepping into 
an area where the Birtcher name is most readily identified with the Birtcher 
commercial developers. 
</P>
<P>
So, to lessen the confusion and broadcast a clearer picture of its business, 
Birtcher Corp. plans to change its name to Birtcher Medical Systems at its 
annual meeting next week, Whelan said. 
</P>
<P>
The sharing of the Birtcher name by two enterprises is no coincidence, said Art 
Birtcher, co-chairman of the development company. He said the medical company 
was founded by his uncle Cecil, the elder brother of his father, F.E. Birtcher 
-- founder of the development enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
When Cecil Birtcher died in the early 1960s, Art said, other members of the 
Birtcher family sold their interest in the medical company, which, unlike the 
development enterprise, is publicly traded. Compiled by Leslie Berkman, Times

O.C. FIRM JOINS WITH SOVIETS IN MARKETING VENTURE

A group of Soviet companies and a small Orange County firm have announced a 
joint marketing venture that will distribute Soviet biotechnology products 
outside the United States and U.S. medical products in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet officials said the new company will market the Soviet medical 
products in the United States once they get approval from the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration, said Dr. Ernst R. Muldashev, an ophthalmologist and 
general director of Allotransplant, a private Soviet medical firm. 
</P>
<P>
Adapt International, which is a Villa Park trading and consulting firm, said it 
and Allotransplant have formed the venture, Allovita Inc. in Orange, in which 
the Soviet company has majority ownership. 
</P>
<P>
The companies did not disclose financial terms of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Pending approval from the FDA, the venture plans to market Soviet biotechnology 
products such as "allotransplantats," which are artificial tissues used for 
reconstructive surgery. With these products, Muldashev said that patients need 
not use immune suppressive drugs, which are often needed for such procedures to 
prevent the patient's body from rejecting the artificial tissues. 
</P>
<P>
Muldashev said that the allotransplantats have been used by Soviet doctors in 
the past decade, particularly in eye surgery. 
</P>
<P>
It would also market American medical products, such as oxygenators and 
surgical equipment, in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Adapt International is a small company founded by Jane Settle that assists U.S. 
medical manufacturers to sell their products in the Soviet Union and also helps 
Soviet medical companies sell their products in the United States. 
Allotransplant is a medical research and manufacturing concern that operates 
surgical clinics in Moscow and other Soviet cities. It sells some of its 
products in Latin America, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Under the venture, Allovita would establish educational clinics in Orange 
County and in other U.S. cities to teach the latest developments in Soviet 
surgical procedures, Muldashev said.

SANTA ANA MAKER OF CIRCUIT BOARDS FILES BANKRUPTCY

Facing a cash crunch and unable to raise new funds, Metropolitan Circuits of 
California on Friday filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in federal 
court here. 
</P>
<P>
The company, a manufacturer of printed circuit boards and a subsidiary of 
Metropolitan Circuits Inc., had assets of about $6 million and debts of $10 
million, said spokeswoman Cecilia Wilkinson. 
</P>
<P>
"The company's financial condition made it impossible to get the financing 
necessary to meet the company's cash needs," said Richard Sandberg, chief 
executive officer of the parent company. "Hopefully, the company will now be 
able to restructure its indebtedness and obtain the necessary financing." 
</P>
<P>
Under Chapter 11, a company is allowed to continue operations while developing 
a plan to reorganize and pay off its debts. 
</P>
<P>
The subsidiary's two major secured creditors are General Electric Co. and 
Advanced Dielectric, Wilkinson said. It also has 165 unsecured creditors. 
</P>
<P>
The parent company last reported financial results a year ago. For the nine 
months ended Nov. 25, 1989, the company reported a loss of $830,000 on sales of 
$5.1 million, compared to a loss of $1.1 million on sales of $5.6 million a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson said the subsidiary hired turnaround specialist Kenneth C. Cleveland 
in October to assist in its restructuring. In addition, Paul G. McNamara, 
former president of Anaheim-based Aeroscientific, was named president of 
Metropolitan Circuits Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The subsidiary, Metropolitan Circuits Inc.'s only operating unit, laid off 
about 50 employees in recent months, leaving the company with 257 employees. 
</P>
<P>
The American Stock Exchange has halted trading of the parent company's shares.

ENDING THE YARDWORK ETHIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY JO HILL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Weekend yardwork used to be an American tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors would wave to each other as they spent several hours every Saturday 
or Sunday mowing and edging large expanses of deep-green lawns, raking leaves, 
trimming hedges and pruning and grooming shrubs, flowers and trees. 
</P>
<P>
But today, it seems people are too busy to invest time in their lawns, and 
hiring gardeners to do it for them is expensive. The solution: low-maintenance 
landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my clients, unless they're avid gardeners and are collectors of 
certain plants, almost always ask me for low-maintenance (ideas)," says James 
T. Jesser, a Laguna Beach landscape architect. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of my clients just don't want to be devoted to the lawn, or to be 
spending a lot of time in the yard," says Lisa Iwata, a landscape architect 
with Land Interactive in San Clemente. "They want to be enjoying the yard more 
or going places." 
</P>
<P>
The term low maintenance is relative, however. 
</P>
<P>
"What might be 'low maintenance' for one person might be way too much (work) 
for another," Jesser says. 
</P>
<P>
Some people are happy to spend a couple of hours a week puttering around in 
their yards, while others may not want to work in their yard at all. 
</P>
<P>
There are, however, some common elements in low-maintenance landscapes: 
</P>
<P>
Plants are selected that are appropriate to climate and soil conditions. This 
affects how much water is needed and how frequently soil needs amendments. 
</P>
<P>
Plants are planted with enough room so that frequent pruning isn't necessary. 
</P>
<P>
An efficient automatic irrigation system is essential. 
</P>
<P>
The overall yard will have more of a gray-green look rather than lush green, 
with splashes of color. Colorful plants are concentrated in a few areas, rather 
than spread throughout a yard. 
</P>
<P>
A reduction of lawn area may mean a small patch for children to play on or the 
use of grass as a ground cover. 
</P>
<P>
Plants that have an informal or natural look are used. 
</P>
<P>
A low-maintenance yard was definitely on the minds of Helen and Robert Rochelle 
when they moved to a new home on a Dana Point hilltop. The Rochelles had left 
behind a large home in San Clemente with about 7,000 square feet of lawn. This 
high-maintenance yard sometimes required having gardeners come twice a week and 
meant a huge water bill. 
</P>
<P>
"What we wanted was low maintenance and not a huge yard," Helen Rochelle says. 
She wanted European-style courtyards, but she didn't want the hardscape to 
dominate. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted charm to it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Bob and Kay Campbell had lived in their Dana Point home more than 20 years when 
they decided something had to be done about their front yard. They wanted lower 
maintenance too. 
</P>
<P>
"It was always a very clean-cut looking yard," Kay Campbell says, "but we had a 
problem with roots and all going through the front yard and erupting. We 
started by taking out the junipers and taking out the lawn and all the sudden 
we were in serious trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Both the Rochelles and the Campbells called on Jesser to design their yards. 
Both couples wanted low maintenance, but how they approached it shows why low 
maintenance is a relative term. 
</P>
<P>
Jesser designed a series of gardens for the Rochelles, who had the yard 
installed by professionals. There's a front courtyard with a planter with a 
large multi-trunked Ficus nitida tree and azaleas. A side yard off the kitchen 
has a barbecue area and a long planter against the far wall. Five 30-foot high 
queen palms are in the planter, which also brims with impatiens or some other 
colorful flower depending upon the time of year. 
</P>
<P>
Both the front and side-yard planters match the white stucco of the house and 
the walls that enclose the yard. 
</P>
<P>
The side-patio floor is composed of gray and adobe-colored pavers, to blend 
with the granite floor in the kitchen. The pavers are set in sand and framed 
with a rim of concrete. 
</P>
<P>
Another planter bed next to the house features a variety of plants, including 
Hymenosporum flavum trees, which have beautiful yellow blossoms in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
There are also two rectangular areas of concrete with corners cut at angles in 
this area. These form a walkway to the rear patio and are surrounded by grass, 
which gives the hardscape a much softer look. 
</P>

The rear patio is concrete and extends from the back of the house to a low 
stucco wall in front of a steep slope covered with native plants. French-doors 
open onto the patio from the living room and the master bedroom and terra-cotta 
pots with palms or flowers are sprinkled around the yard. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most striking devices is the liberal use of climbing vines. 
Bougainvillea and grewia caffra espauer are being trained to climb the walls of 
the house. The green vine and colorful blossoms of bougainvillea frame the 
front gate to the courtyard and the garage doors. It also climbs up the back of 
the house, while the grewia caffra, which has a delicate lavendera blossom, is 
in the side yard. 
</P>
<P>
In this use, bougainvillea is relatively low maintenance in comparison to the 
frequent pruning it might need if used in areas where branches could get leggy 
and unsightly. 
</P>
<P>
While the Rochelle yard is relatively low maintenance, Helen Rochelle prefers 
to have gardeners once a week. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no such thing as everything being free of problems," she says. "You 
still have that extra little manicuring that you want done to a yard. I think 
it takes someone professional to do it." 
</P>
<P>
But the time gardeners are needed has been cut considerably in comparison to 
Rochelle's last home. And Rochelle is pleased that in between gardener visits 
there's nothing for her to do, except occasionally hose off the patio area. 
</P>
<P>
Rochelle is also pleased that her water bill is now about $20 a month, compared 
to about $250 a month at her previous home. 
</P>
<P>
The Campbells' small front yard needed a different kind of design. Previously, 
the yard was squared off with very specific lines. Jesser created focal points 
and a design with more curves to give a more spacious look. Professionals did 
the grading and sprinkler system, but the Campbells did all the planting. 
</P>
<P>
The design includes a kidney-shaped planter with H. flavum trees, mock orange, 
raphiolepis, ornamental strawberry and agapanthus on one side of the yard. A 
small area of marathon tall fescue grass is used as a ground cover around the 
planter. 
</P>
<P>
The tall trees draw the eye toward the second story of the house. And the 
curved walk -- brick in a herringbone pattern -- leads the eye to the entryway 
which also has brick. 
</P>
<P>
Another focal point is a colorful mound of impatiens near the driveway. The bed 
is edged with small Japanese boxwoods and a lantern on a wood post emerges from 
the mound of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
The front of the house also has an attached brick planter that has more 
raphiolepis, hibiscus, asparagus fern and a grewia caffra vine growing between 
two windows. 
</P>
<P>
There's another planter bed with three sweet shade trees, agapanthus and 
impatiens on the far side of the concrete and brick driveway, which was widened 
with a brick walkway. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Campbell says the front yard is now "moderately low maintenance." The small 
lawn area can go for two weeks without mowing, but Campbell prefers to cut it 
once a week. Some of the other shrubs require trimming and grooming every 
couple of weeks. But he says the whole job takes a maximum of 1 1/2 hours, 
including cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
John Tengdin, who is a semi-retired telecommunications consultant, enjoys the 
two hours a week he spends working in his San Clemente yard. His main concern 
was to have a yard that would both conserve water and reduce maintenance. Lisa 
Iwata designed a xeriscape yard for Tengdin and his wife, Carol. The term 
xeriscape denotes the use of native and climate-appropriate plants to reduce 
the amount of water and maintenance needed in landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
The sloping front yard is a flowing combination of artemisia (a shrubby ground 
cover related to sage), California wild lilac, California fuchsia (a shrub with 
red flowers) and a spectacular Mexican palo verde tree, which has delicate 
yellow flowers and long needles instead of leaves. 
</P>
<P>
There's also a front-yard patio. Plants in this area include comfrey berry and 
autumn sage. Near the front door is a bed with beach strawberry, coral bells 
and meadow rue. 
</P>
<P>
The side yard is a mix of another form of sage, marguerite daisies in a variety 
of colors, dusty miller, stock, a lemon tree and areas of wildflowers that 
bloom in the spring and reseed themselves. Redwood bark is used as a mulch. 
</P>
<P>
The back yard has a patio, which is a series of concrete squares separated by 
wood strips and set at 45-degree angles with the house. Shade is provided by a 
1,500-square-foot redwood patio cover. 
</P>
<P>
There's also an area of grass about 40 feet by 20 feet at its widest spot, more 
wildflower areas, a small desert willow tree, buckwheat (a California native 
plant that has beige flowers), more beach strawberries, a dwarf grapefruit tree 
and a small coast live oak. A side yard has a redwood deck and redwood planters 
for herbs and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
All the plants are on a zoned irrigation system, which allows some areas to be 
watered as infrequently as every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Tengdin built the deck and the fence along the front patio. He had all the 
concrete work, sprinkler installation, soil preparation and most of the plant 
installation done by a landscape contractor. 
</P>
<P>
He is perhaps proudest of his wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
When in bloom, the spectacular stands of wildflowers get as high as 3 feet, 
with salmon-colored, pink, red, yellow and orange flowers moving in the ocean 
breeze. When the flowers are not in bloom, the ground in those areas looks a 
bit bare. But, Tengdin says, "it doesn't disturb me to not have it totally 
covered with green. 
</P>
<P>
"All I did was hand broadcast the seeds the first time and sprinkle a little 
potting soil on top and let nature do the rest." 
</P>
<P>
Now that is low maintenance.

HIGH-LEVEL SOURCES IN PROFESSION ADVISE SOUTHLAND HOMEOWNERS HOW TO CUT DOWN ON 
OVERHEADWITH INSPECTION, MAINTENANCE AND LEARNING EXACTLY WHAT'S UP

<P>
It never occurred to her that if the drainpipes of a house are clogged, the 
rain may collect in pools on the roof; and she suspected no danger until 
suddenly she discovered a crack in the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 -- From "Madame Bovary," by Gustave Flaubert 
</P>
<P>
In temperate Southern California, we largely ignore roof maintenance -- until 
too late. But in much of the country, roofs are an important part of life. 
</P>
<P>
As winter approaches in Chicago suburbs, people talk about roof upkeep, repair 
and replacement at cocktail parties -- much like Orange County residents 
discuss the best places to take the Beemer for a tuneup. 
</P>
<P>
And while locals are most likely to be found on the roof only if it supports a 
sun deck, New Englanders, Floridians, Oregonians and Texans religiously take to 
their ladders to perform the semiannual ritual of gutter, flashing and shingle 
inspection. 
</P>
<P>
They know a roof is critical because they have to worry about keeping out the 
elements. All of the time. 
</P>
<P>
They live in places where rain and snow and ice storms are more than 
multicolored splotches on the TV weatherman's satellite map. 
</P>
<P>
We ignore our roofs because, hey, it never rains around here and never gets 
cold enough to freeze, so what could go wrong? 
</P>
<P>
Like Flaubert's heroine, most of us don't even suspect the importance of clean 
rain gutters. 
</P>
<P>
We don't think about our roofs, that is, until we wake up one morning gazing at 
a spreading stain on the ceiling -- or sloshing around in what wasn't supposed 
to be a water bed. 
</P>
<P>
Then the prosaic becomes profound. 
</P>
<P>
So, let us consider the roof: what we can do to keep it whole; what we should 
do to spot trouble signs early; what we must do once old age or abuse has done 
it in, and the costs and choices we face when, finally, it is time to do 
something about it. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, residences generally are roofed with one of six types 
of material: built-up or rolled composition roofing; composition shingles; wood 
shingles; concrete or metal tiles; clay tiles; and the new lightweight 
cellulose-cement composite tile and shingle look-alikes. 
</P>
<P>
A very few homes, usually of contemporary design, have all-metal roofs of 
galvanized or stainless steel, copper or terne metal (galvanized steel coated 
with a mixture of tin and lead). And an even smaller number, industry 
specialists say, are topped off with the creme de la creme of all roofing 
materials -- genuine slate. 
</P>
<P>
Metal and slate roofs, of course, rarely wear out if left in peace. That's one 
reason they cost so much. 
</P>
<P>
But of the six commonly used roofing materials, three can have relatively short 
life spans and all are subject to damage from the sun and wind, blowing debris, 
falling tree limbs and clogged gutters. 
</P>
<P>
Natural wear and tear is aggravated each time the homeowner wanders across the 
roof, whether to install a TV antenna or search for a lost Frisbee. 
</P>
<P>
The first rule of roofing is that "if you can see daylight through it from 
inside the attic, you probably need a new one," says Sandy Johnson, a roofing 
and painting contractor. 
</P>
<P>
That might sound silly, but Johnson, proprietor with his wife, Janet, of 
S&amp;J Specialty Services in Orange, says he is continually amazed by the 
number of people who don't discover until the year's first driving rain that 
their roofs leak. 
</P>
<P>
The best way to avoid spending a day or two emptying overflowing pots and pans 
and watching the plaster or drywall crumble and fall, he says, is to do like 
those Easterners and inspect the roof at least twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
But inspect it without walking on it. 
</P>
<P>
"Walking on a roof can damage it badly, even if you know what you're doing," 
Johnson said. "But more important, a roof is a treacherous place and even 
experienced roofers fall. Someone who isn't used to walking on a roof can 
easily go flying." 
</P>
<P>
Each time Johnson takes a crew up on a rooftop, he cautions them that they "are 
working in the yellow zone all of the time. One false step and you're gone." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson himself has never fallen -- all the way -- but admits to the 
heart-stopping experience of sliding from the peak to the edge of his own roof 
early in his career. 
</P>
<P>
"All the way down I was trying frantically to ditch my tool belt. All I could 
think of was landing on the hammer. Fortunately, there's a slight lip on the 
very edge and it stopped me" from plunging two stories to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of tromping the tiles (or shakes or shingles), use a ladder and a pair 
of binoculars to facilitate your inspection, the National Roofing Contractors 
Assn. suggests. 
</P>
<P>
You'll have to move the ladder around the perimeter of the house to do a 
thorough job, but it beats a month in traction -- or worse. 
</P>
<P>
What to look for during an inspection depends in part on the type of roof. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the homes built in Orange County in the first post-Korean War expansion 
had built-up rock or rolled mineral roofing or asphalt shingles. Those types of 
roofs, with built-up and rolled roofing used largely on flat or barely sloped 
roofs, are prevalent throughout the older cities in North and Central County 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
(Rolled or built-up roofs also are called hot-mop roofs because they are made 
of alternating layers of hot asphalt and felt roofing paper, topped off either 
with colored rocks poured directly onto the final layer of tar or with 
mineral-impregnated rolled roofing paper.) 
</P>
<P>
From the early 1960s through the early '80s, wood shake was the preferred 
roofing style, until a combination of the now-ubiquitous Mediterranean-style 
architecture and fear of fire turned most everyone's fancy to tile roofs -- 
generally real clay on new construction and cement or, more recently, 
lightweight composite tiles use to replace wood or composition shingles on 
reroofing jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Among the newest roofing materials are aluminum or steel shingle substitutes, 
which require special installation techniques. A major manufacturer of steel 
shingles, Gerard Roofing Technologies, is located in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
If you've got a metal roof -- and the odds right now are that you don't -- look 
for broken seams, bent tiles or places where the mastic has pulled away from 
chimneys or vent pipes. 
</P>
<P>
On flat roofs, warning signs include "bald spots" where the mineral or rock 
coating has worn off; as well as cracks and loose seams. 
</P>
<P>
Bald spots also are a trouble sign on composite shingle roofs, and homeowners 
also should check them for cracked missing shingles or shingles with curled 
ends or edges, said Tim Green, spokesman for the national contractors group. 
</P>
<P>
"On a wood-shingle house, look for shingles that are broken or cracked, curling 
or moldy or mildewed," said Green. He acknowledged that moldy wood shingles are 
not too common in Orange County's Mediterranean climate, but said the sun here 
does much worse damage to wood than all the rain in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, it is not uncommon for a wood-shingle roof to live 40 or 
50 years along the Pacific Northwest coast, an event that would qualify as a 
genuine miracle in Irvine, or even in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Next to man -- as in man walking on roof -- the sun is an Orange County roof's 
worst enemy, Green said. "The ultraviolet rays and the heat in Southern 
California are very tough on a lot of roof materials." 
</P>
<P>
In hot climates, he said, the natural oils in shakes can be baked out in just a 
few years, as can the fire retardants that are applied these days as a matter 
of law. 
</P>
<P>
So one of the most important maintenance items for a wood-shingle roof in 
Orange County is to have it professionally inspected every five years or so 
and, when necessary, to have it re-oiled and the fire retarding materials 
reapplied when necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Even that won't make a wood roof last like a tile one, said Brett Reichard, 
manager of Ford Wholesale Co. in Stanton, one of the county's oldest and 
largest roofing supply firms. 
</P>
<P>
"But for a lot of people, the natural look of wood, the aesthetics of it, is 
more important than the life span or the cost of replacement roofing," he said. 
"So they keep buying it," at least in those communities that haven't outlawed 
wood shingle altogether because of the fire danger. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, wood roofs are prohibited in a number of areas. 
</P>
<P>
In all cases, a roofing permit is required and the building department should 
have a list of approved materials. Before replacing a shake roof with new wood 
shingles, or before roofing a new addition or new building with wood, be sure 
to check with the local building department. 
</P>
<P>
Tile-roof owners laugh at blowing wildfire embers and falling Fourth of July 
bottle rockets, and scoff at the sun. 
</P>
<P>
But tile roofs are quite susceptible to damage from wind-blown or falling 
debris or from thoughtlessly tossed tools and toys or carelessly placed feet. 
</P>
<P>
When inspecting a tile roof, be it clay, cement, metal or composite, look for 
broken or cracked tiles and exposed underlayment -- the black "tar paper" 
(actually asphalt impregnated and sometimes rubberized felt paper) that is 
installed between the wooden roof decking -- usually plywood or chipboard -- 
and the roofing material. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, cautions Johnson, "remember that a lot of roof leaks aren't caused by 
holes in the roof. They are actually leaks around the metal flashings where the 
roof meets the chimney or where vent pipes come up through the roof." 
</P>
<P>
Other points of leakage can be roof edges improperly sealed against wind-blown 
rain or overflowing gutters, and rotted metal valleys -- the V-shaped troughs 
where portions of pitched roofs intersect. 
</P>
<P>
Once done with the exterior inspection, it is into the attic, where the routine 
is the same no matter what kind of roof you have. 
</P>
<P>
Use a flashlight and check the underside of the decking for water spots, look 
for water trails running down rafters and then turn off the light and look for 
daylight where there shouldn't be any. 
</P>
<P>
If you've done all that -- or had a professional inspection service come in and 
do it -- and have determined that the old roof is in trouble, there are three 
alternatives, Green said. 
</P>
<P>
"The options are simple. You can repair, re-cover, or re-roof completely." 
</P>
<P>
Making spot repairs is generally the least expensive but often the chanciest 
course for most roof problems. 
</P>
<P>
Many a roof will last years longer after a liberal application of patching 
compound, renewal of mastic around the flashings or replacement of a few broken 
tiles. But many others will just leak somewhere else -- or keep leaking in the 
same place. 
</P>
<P>
A good contractor can advise you on the best recourse for your particular 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
The national trade association warns against door-to-door roofing sales and 
contractors who want materials payments in advance. The association maintains a 
hot line, (800) USA-ROOF, through which callers can get a roofing-information 
kit containing brochures on buying and repairing roofs, as well as a list of 
association members in their locale. 
</P>
<P>
If you've got to re-roof, you are facing a hefty expense. Materials can run 
anywhere from 20 cents to $3 or more a square foot, and trim pieces are extra, 
as is underlayment, cement, new decking, flashing, nails and, of course, labor. 
</P>
<P>
The family budgets, the fitness of the the old roof and how many old roofs 
there are (most building codes allow only three layers before all must be taken 
off) are the prime considerations in decisions to re-cover -- install new 
roofing material over an existing roof -- or re-roof, which involves ripping 
off all existing roofing material, often down to the bare rafters, and then 
building a new roof from the decking up. 
</P>
<P>
When planning a new roof, Johnson said, always consider the long-range 
implications as well as immediate budgetary concerns. It may be a bit less 
expensive to buy $22-per-square composition shingles, but it may be a lot more 
economical -- if the budget can stand the strain -- to get $50-per-square 
shingles that not only look better, but last three times as long. With roofing, 
Johnson says, "that old saying that 'you get what you pay for" really is true. 
To decide what is best, you've got to balance longevity, quality and the look 
or style that you want. Low bids often are low because the roofer is going to 
cut corners." 
</P>
<P>
As a general rule, Johnson said, the material for a re-covering job will run 
just under 50% of the total cost, with labor making up the rest. Labor will be 
70% of most re-roofing jobs because of the work involved in ripping off the old 
material. 
</P>
<P>
"And the steeper the roof, the more expensive the job will be," he warns. 
</P>
<P>
A steeply pitched roof -- the pitch is the number of inches the roof slope 
rises each horizontal foot, as measured in from the edge -- requires 
considerably more in the way of material handling and plain old time because 
the roofers can't move around as rapidly as on a shallower roof. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said one of his most challenging jobs was a nearly 100-year-old home in 
Orange with an 11-in-12 pitch, meaning the roof rose nearly vertically: 11 
inches each foot. 
</P>
<P>
As with most any major renovation, the best course is to get three or four 
bids, contractors association spokesman Green suggests. "And make sure the 
contractors give you detailed information about the products they'll use, the 
exact work they are going to do and what exactly is covered by their bid and by 
their guarantee and what is not." 
</P>
<P>
And remember that there are two kinds of guarantees -- the manufacturer's 
warranty on the roofing materials, and the roofer's warranty against leaks or 
improper installation. 
</P>
<P>
Contractors' warranties will vary, but roofing materials have fairly 
well-established lifetimes, said Reichard. Most roofing material, unless badly 
abused, will outlast the manufacturers' warranties. 
</P>
<P>
Rolled and built-up roofs have the shortest life spans, generally three to 10 
years, depending on the method of installation. 
</P>
<P>
Composition shingles typically are warranted from 10 to 35 years -- with the 
longer-lived shingles at the top end of the price list. 
</P>
<P>
Cement and clay tiles and the new lightweight composite shingles often are 
guaranteed for as much as 50 years, and roofing specialists say there is no 
reason a properly installed and maintained clay tile roof won't last 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
A final note: 
</P>
<P>
With a lot of time, a bit of skill and an abundance of endurance, homeowners 
can save tons of money by doing their own re-roofing. 
</P>
<P>
Even tearing off the old roofing material instead of having the contractor's 
crew do it can save hundreds of dollars in labor charges. 
</P>
<P>
But if you decided to try it yourself -- or if you wonder why those guys who do 
it for a living charge so much for labor -- consider this from roofer Sandy 
Johnson: 
</P>
<P>
"In a typical day, I do 1,000 to 1,500 full squats. I work 10 to 20 feet off 
the ground on a surface that can be slick and is usually trying to pitch me 
off. Temperatures up there can be 20 to 30 degrees higher than the air 
temperature, especially when we're putting down the black underlayment. If you 
eat much for lunch, chances are you'll be throwing up an hour or so after you 
start back to work."

STAINED GLASS -- LIMITLESS PALETTE

<TEXT>
<P>
Since the only stained-glass windows I ever saw when I was growing up were the 
ones in church, I never thought they'd be much of a hit inside a home. A bit 
too reverential. It would be tough, I thought, to whip a New Year's Eve party 
into the proper holiday frenzy with the pious visage of St. Stephen beaming 
into the room. 
</P>
<P>
I changed my mind a few years later, though, when I was told that if I could 
come up with the cash I could have a life-size stained-glass window of Harpo 
Marx. In fact, I learned, I could have just about any scene I wanted -- Koufax 
delivering the heater, Katherine Ross on Paul Newman's bicycle, Bugs Bunny 
singing Wagner -- anything. 
</P>
<P>
None of that stuff sounds unusual to Darrell Wickstrom. He's the owner of The 
Stained Pane, an Anaheim shop specializing in custom stained, beveled and 
etched glass and he's been at it for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done every subject you can think of," he said. "We've worked on some 
homes where we've done every window in the house, but I generally try to talk 
people out of that." 
</P>
<P>
Good idea. A living room that looks like the interior of the cathedral of 
Chartres may sound nice if you have "St." in front of your first name, but your 
guests likely would rather see one window with the image of, say, Charlie Brown 
in it. 
</P>
<P>
Wickstrom can do it. In fact, he said, he's done Charlie Brown, Lucy, Snoopy 
and hordes of other cartoon characters dozens of times. If he can cut the shape 
with a glass cutter, he can put it in a window. 
</P>
<P>
Or a door or a transom or a skylight. The only requirement is that light shine 
through it. And the designs and colors -- Wickstrom said there are literally 
thousands of shadings of glass -- are limited only by the customer's 
imagination. 
</P>
<P>
It's common practice, said Wickstrom, for customers to bring in greeting cards 
with favorite designs or scenes and ask that they be duplicated. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done so many doves coming out of rays of the sun, you wouldn't believe 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
(That scenario may be older than even Wickstrom suspects; the only large 
stained-glass window in St. Peter's basilica in the Vatican -- it's above the 
main altar -- is a dove emerging from golden rays of light.) 
</P>
<P>
Wickstrom's method is the traditional one, essentially unchanged for nearly 400 
years, he said. After a design is agreed on, he draws a pattern to actual size 
and uses it as a guide to cut the colored glass (most of which is imported from 
Europe). If etching, carving or beveling is to be done, it is performed on 
machines. The pieces are then fitted together over the pattern like a jigsaw 
puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
If the pattern is particularly delicate, the pieces are joined with copper foil 
and then soldered, a process -- known as the Tiffany method -- that permits 
fine detailing. If the glass is to be exposed to direct sunlight, leading is 
used. This allows the joints between the glass pieces to expand when the sun 
heats them. This prevents the glass from cracking. 
</P>
<P>
There is another, less expensive, method of producing colored windows but, 
technically, it isn't stained glass, and Wickstrom doesn't use it. Called the 
overlay method, it involves coating clear glass with adhesive colored 
cellophane-like material and applying a type of dark paste at the edges of each 
color to simulate leading. 
</P>
<P>
What does it all cost? The most accurate answer would be: How high is up? If 
you've got a bunch of picture windows but you hate your view and would just as 
soon blot it out with a life-size reproduction of the Battle of Hastings, you'd 
better tell your accountant to sit down. 
</P>
<P>
If, on the other hand, you'll settle for a multicolored carousel horse about 
the size of a small bedroom window, you can have it for a little more than 
$350. And remember Charlie Brown? You can have him, in a frame about the size 
of a TV screen, for about $135. 
</P>
<P>
In actual practice, said Wickstrom, the price of any given piece depends on the 
intricacy of the pattern, the cost of the glass itself, and whether the glass 
is also to be etched, carved or beveled -- all exacting and time-consuming 
processes. One piece on display at Wickstrom's shop, a stained-glass eagle with 
a 4-foot wingspan against an etched background of mountains and a glacier, goes 
for $6,400. He said he has done extensive glass work in single houses that have 
cost between $30,000 and $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
If there is such a thing as an average cost for installing stained glass in a 
house, said Wickstrom, it would be between $8,000 and $10,000 and would likely 
involve a handful of pieces distributed throughout the house. 
</P>
<P>
But no churches. Hardly. Maybe one job in a thousand, he said, will end up in a 
church. Apparently, all the appropriate religious subjects have already been 
done, and repairs are rare. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there is a chance (roughly the same as that of Donald Trump paying 
retail) that Harpo Marx will be canonized one fine day and orders from churches 
will start rolling in. I'm going to send a letter of support for the idea as 
soon as I figure out what the Vatican's address is.

<P>
To many do-it-yourself decorators, creating the kinds of perfect rooms seen in 
the slick pictures of home magazines remains a mystery known only to interior 
designers. 
</P>
<P>
At Bullock's in South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa, home decorators recently had a 
chance to observe an interior design project from bare walls to a 
picture-perfect finish at the "Start With an Empty Room" decorating seminar 
presented by Metropolitan Home magazine and Cotton Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Watching a room in the making offered observers insight into the rationale 
behind the design, a glimpse into how designers make seemingly incompatible 
objects look great together. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Lloyd, interior design and architecture editor for Metropolitan Home, 
cleared away a 16-by-16 foot space in the store's home furnishings department, 
surrounded it with white fabric-covered "walls" and turned it into an inviting 
bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, he cheated. He moved in a few of the heavier pieces before the show 
so "you wouldn't see us break our backs." A pine armoire and an antique oak bed 
with intricate carving already occupied his room. 
</P>
<P>
"We like the idea that they're not matched," Lloyd said, explaining his choice 
of furniture. The golden tone of the different wood brought harmony to the 
mismatched pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd called the armoire and bed his "virtuoso pieces." 
</P>
<P>
They're "the big nice pieces that you like," and set the foundation for the 
rest of the furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
"They become the architecture of the room," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The full-sized feather bed was then piled high with an over-stuffed comforter 
and big square pillows, all made of white cotton with blue eyelet trim. 
</P>
<P>
"Talk about comfort and sumptuousness," said Lloyd, sinking his hands into the 
bedding while his audience looked ready to pounce upon the fluffy white mound. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like a giant marshmallow," a woman in the front row said. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd deliberately chose natural materials such as wood and cotton for his 
room. 
</P>
<P>
"They have more charm to them," he said. "We've gone from high-tech to 
high-touch." 
</P>
<P>
For his next "big piece of architecture," he added a classical screen painted 
with Corinthian columns, romantic arches and florals. 
</P>
<P>
A wicker love seat followed, its golden hue helping it to blend in with the 
rest of the wooden furniture. Lloyd paired it with a coffee table of rough hewn 
pine to create a comfortable sitting area. 
</P>
<P>
With space at a premium for most homeowners, he suggests finding multiple uses 
for a room. A bedroom, he said, should be more than just a place for sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not just putting a lot of stuff in a room. You should ask what that 
room's going to do for you." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the eclectic furnishings and knickknacks that followed were united by 
color -- greens and yellows, blues and pinks. 
</P>
<P>
He placed pink and mint green throw pillows on the love seat, floral tapestry 
pillows on a wicker rocking chair, an easel with a picture of a rose, a green 
quilt stand with pale green and ivory afghans tossed over it "to soften the 
look," and an emerald green bird cage. 
</P>
<P>
"The cage is a craft. You might keep a bird, you might not," Lloyd said. "It's 
the structure of the thing." He thought a moment longer and added: 
</P>
<P>
"You're probably just as well without a bird." 
</P>
<P>
Accessories work best when they contrast with each other, he said. When 
everything looks the same, a room can look dull. To demonstrate, he brought out 
a modern black torchere (a free-standing floor lamp) to contrast with the 
romance of the classical screen. 
</P>
<P>
One customer, noting that the blue eyelet trim on the bed's dust ruffle matched 
the blue trellis pattern of a woven area rug, asked if the coordinating 
patterns had been intentional. 
</P>
<P>
"No, it's just a glorious piece of luck," Lloyd said. Such "happy coincidences" 
often occur when one chooses eclectic furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
Changing the look of the room proved as easy as changing the bed. Lloyd 
replaced the white cotton on the antique bed with a comforter and sheets by 
Esprit done in a green and gold geometric print, proving a contemporary design 
could pair well with old-fashioned furnishings. Again it was color -- in this 
case green -- that pulled the look together. 
</P>
<P>
When he finished rearranging the room, one practical observer noticed that 
something was missing. 
</P>
<P>
"If there were a window, what would you do?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd advised putting up a pleated shade for a clean look or taking a related 
fabric or sheet and draping it over a pole to frame the window. 
</P>
<P>
"Make your window into a picture," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With its wicker and wood, cotton and down, Lloyd's room reflected a "glitzing 
down" from the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
"All that glitz is less appealing than the beauty of natural products. People 
want something that's authentic." 
</P>
<P>
They're filling their homes with granite, marble, wood and cotton instead of 
synthetics. 
</P>
<P>
He showed off a heavy glass goblet made in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"It's stylish but relaxed," he said, admiring the imperfections of the glass. 
He finds the handmade quality and natural material preferable to "high-tech, 
anti-charm" furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
In real homes, most decorators start not with an empty room but one filled with 
stuff. Nor do they have a store full of new furnishings at their disposal. 
</P>
<P>
To freshen a room, Lloyd suggests pulling out the things one no longer cares 
about and swapping them with different accessories, preferably original pieces 
that have the rough-hewn look of a handmade craft. 
</P>
<P>
"Pick things you like instead of following the trends," he said. Too often, 
people copy the style of the time, so that one could almost date their rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"A look gets leaden after several people have done it badly." 
</P>
<P>
Having the "in" decor might look slick for the moment, but only the furnishings 
that reflect one's true tastes will withstand the test of time. 
</P>
<P>
Some homeowners rely too much on the talents of an interior designer and not 
enough on their own instincts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like getting people to dress you every day. It rings false," Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
"The most successful homes I've seen are done by people who really like the 
things they put in them."

SINGLE-FAMILY HOME SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While single-family houses were dominating the market around Orange County, 
here they accounted for only about one in five new hoes sold during 1989. In 
all four contiguous counties single-family residences dominated the market, 
with a high of 84% in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the state, the share was 66%. Here's the comparison: 
</P>
<P>
Orange County: 19% 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County: 60% 
</P>
<P>
Riverside County: 76% 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino County: 84% 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County: 44% 
</P>
<P>
Statewide: 66% 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AVERAGE PRICE 
</P>
<P>
The average selling price of new single-family homes in Orange County-in excess 
of $400,000-easily topped prices in the surrounding counties during 1989. In 
fact, the average price here was 42% higher than in Los Angeles County, the 
next highest area, and was 93% higher than the statewide figure. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how the prices compared: 
</P>
<P>
Orange County: $408,400 
</P>
<P>
Riverside County: $165,500 
</P>
<P>
Statewide: $211,700 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LIVING SPACE 
</P>
<P>
Although Orange County buyers were paying more for their new single-family 
homes, they were also buying "more house" than those in surrounding counties. 
Average living space here in new homes sold last year was 2,665 square feet-21% 
more than in San Diego County, which had the next highest average amount of 
space. Here's how Orange County compares to its neighbors and the rest of the 
state: 
</P>
<P>
Orange County: 2,665 sq. ft. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside County: 1,880 sq. ft. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide: 2,000 sq. ft.
