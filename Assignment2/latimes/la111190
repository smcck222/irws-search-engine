Slick and scarcely subtle but undeniably potent, Steven Spielberg's 1975 Jaws 
(Channel 13 Sunday at 6 p.m.) builds single-mindedly to its big, scary climax 
involving that awesome shark. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss 
star. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, that description of Jaws fits Fatal Attraction (CBS Sunday at 9 
p.m.) if you simply substitute shark for Glenn Close, the woman with whom 
Michael Douglas has a brief affair only to discard her at enormous peril to 
himself and his family. The trouble with this 1989 blockbuster is that 
everything is loaded so heavily against the Close character from frame one that 
the effect is repellent in the utmost. 
</P>
<P>
A two-part miniseries, "The Big One: The Great Los Angeles Earthquake," (NBC 
Sunday at 9 p.m., concluding Monday at 9 p.m.) stars Joanna Kerns as a 
seismologist who is sure the 'Big One' is about to hit. Also stars Dan Lauria 
and Ed Begley Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Call Me Anna (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) stars Patty Duke in a new TV movie of her 
harrowing autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
Jagged Edge (Channel 11 Monday at 8 p.m.) may vanish from memory like an old 
grocery list, but while you're in it you're caught, held all the way by this 
hit 1985 suspense thriller in which San Francisco attorney Glenn Close defends 
Jeff Bridges, accused of murdering his newspaper-heiress wife. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1989 Uncle Buck (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.), writer-director John Hughes 
fuses his two genres of choice: the clashing family members comedy and the 
tortured teen pic, with predictable results. John Candy, the titular behemoth, 
is an eccentric relative from blue collar hell who's called in to baby-sit his 
three stuffed-shirt brother's kids. 
</P>
<P>
The Border (Channel 13 Wednesday at 10 a.m.), absorbingly directed by Tony 
Richardson, is the most unjustly neglected picture of the career of Jack 
Nicholson. It takes a compassionate look at the plight of illegal aliens along 
the U.S.-Mexican border, and Nicholson plays a border patrolman increasingly 
disaffected with his job of forcing Mexicans back to their side of the Rio 
Grande. 
</P>
<P>
Rocky is back (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), with Rocky II Thursday and the 
dreadful Rocky IV on Friday. Why not "Rocky III," which is pretty good? 
</P>
<P>
Airing opposite Rocky II Thursday (8 p.m. on Channel 13) is the lurid, mindless 
1986 Stallone hard-action picture Cobra. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Murray sends up the Army in the 1981 Stripes (Channel 13 Friday at 8 
p.m.), a raucous summer refreshment that's amiably silly and unmistakably aimed 
at 18-year-olds (but you may finds yourself laughing along with the kids). 
</P>
<P>
There's plenty of classic vintage fare airing Saturday evening: the original 
King Kong (Channel 5 Saturday at 8 p.m.); The Hustler (Channel 9 Saturday at 8 
p.m.), with Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason and Piper Laurie; a film noir double 
feature on Channel 28, Murder, My Sweet (at 9 p.m.) and D.O.A. (at 10:30 p.m.), 
and one of the greatest of all British comedies, The Ladykillers (Channel 9 
Saturday at 11 p.m.).

To the producers of China Beach: 
</P>
<P>
What have you done to my favorite Emmy-winning series this season? You have 
taken us backward and forward in time, confused us with unfocused plots and 
changed the characters so that they don't resemble those we've grown to know 
and love. 
</P>
<P>
You have turned the series into a farsical caricature of itself that is both 
overacted and underdirected. I, for one will no longer be staying home to watch 
my once favorite show. Change is good, camouflage is unforgivable.

With interest in ETs and UFOs soaring, it is time to bring back "The Invaders," 
the well-executed series from 1967 that focused on a young architect's quest to 
thwart an alien takeover of terra firma. Roy Thinnes, the star of that series, 
could take up where he left off, combatting the invasion.

The Memphis Belle (Channel 28 Sunday at 4 p.m.; Discovery Channel Sunday at 7 
p.m. and 11 p.m.). Here's a chance to see the landmark 1944 William Wyler World 
War II documentary about a bomber mission over Germany that is the basis for 
the current film of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
The Little Thief (Cinemax Wednesday at midnight). This fine 1989 French film is 
derived from a treatment prepared by Francois Truffaut not long before his 
death in 1984 and brought to the screen in deceptively simple and marvelously 
subtle fashion by Claude Miller. Charlotte Gainsbourg invests the teen-age 
delinquent heroine with delicate, bruised sensibilities and a smile that can 
twist your heart. 
</P>
<P>
Imitation of Life (AMC Friday at 6 p.m.). It's the 1959 Douglas Sirk version of 
the Fannie Hurst story that has developed a cult, but the one you may remember 
the best is this 1934 original in which Claudette Colbert and Louise Beavers 
strike it rich with Beavers' pancake recipe -- and in which Beavers' 
heart-breaking daughter (Fredi Washington) tries to pass for white. Directed by 
John M. Stahl. 
</P>
<P>
The Bank Dick (TNT Friday at 9:30 p.m.), You Can't Cheat an Honest Man (at 11 
p.m.) and Never Give a Sucker an Even Break (at 1 a.m.). Three of W. C. Fields' 
best.

Universal Pictures is opening up its horror vaults to resurrect some venerable 
movie monsters. 
</P>
<P>
Currently in development there: "Clive Barker's 'The Mummy,' " from the horror 
novelist who wrote and directed "Hellraiser." 
</P>
<P>
And director John Carpenter, who remade RKO's "The Thing" for Universal in 
1982, has gone fishing for "The Creature From the Black Lagoon." 
</P>
<P>
"(Universal) used to make a lot of monster movies, and they'd love to do them 
again if they can find people to do them," Carpenter tells us. "I talked to 
(studio exec) Tom Pollock and suggested 'The Creature From the Black Lagoon,' 
who was always one of my favorite '50s monsters. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked the way he looked up at the girl from underwater. My idea is to make 
him a little more human, give him a little more intelligence. The story is in 
the writing stages now." 
</P>
<P>
Barker is co-writing his "Mummy" script with Mick Garris, who directed 
Universal's just-aired "Psycho IV" for Showtime. Barker says that his bandaged 
zombie will be a departure from the seven previous Universal versions, which 
began in 1932 with Boris Karloff as "The Mummy." 
</P>
<P>
"I refer to our film as 'The Egyptian Project' because it's so very different 
from 'The Mummy' that Universal produced," Barker says. "Unfortunately it's a 
top-secret project, but it's radically, radically different." 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter, whose 1978 cult classic "Halloween" inspired a decade of slasher 
films, feels that the Universal films may mark a change in the direction of 
horror. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's an appetite for a rejuvenated approach to horror," Carpenter 
says. "There's always a place for horror movies, for something that scares you. 
I think that the cycle of slasher films has kind of worn itself out." Daniel 
Cerone

Glenn Close is seen in three different suits -- each a different color -- in a 
"Jagged Edge" courtroom scene. Singer Don McLean's "American Pie," released in 
1971, plays in the background of "Born on the Fourth of July" -- set in 
1968-69. 
</P>
<P>
The Depression Era "Harlem Nights" has characters spouting such modern 
expressions as "Yo" and "I'll let you have your space." In "The 'Burbs," set in 
middle America, the Disney Channel's Burbank office building can be glimpsed in 
the background. 
</P>
<P>
These glaring goofs are among a couple hundred from over 150 films compiled by 
Bill Givens in "Film Flubs -- Memorable Movie Mistakes," just published. 
</P>
<P>
Other gems: 
</P>
<P>
Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), in "Star Wars," shouts "Carrie!" to Princess Leia 
(Carrie Fisher). 
</P>
<P>
Fred MacMurray, playing a carefree, never-married bachelor in "Double 
Indemnity," wears a wide gold wedding band throughout the picture. 
</P>
<P>
Yul Brynner's earring appears, disappears -- even changes ears -- as he sings 
"Is a Puzzlement" in "The King and I." 
</P>
<P>
In "North to Alaska," John Wayne loses his hairpiece during a fight scene . . . 
but it's back on in the next shot. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever Givens mentions his book, he says, someone inevitably has a favorite 
film flub to share. 
</P>
<P>
So we mentioned one of ours: as Julia Roberts undresses Richard Gere in "Pretty 
Woman," his tie and collar are untied and unbuttoned, then tied and buttoned -- 
and back again -- in the same scene. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll put that one in Volume II," promises Givens. John M. Wilson

OUTTAKES: TALK OF THE TOWN

<P>
What impact will the shutdown of producer-director Larry Cohen's "The Heavy" 
have on Las Vegas, N.M. (pop. 15,000)? The production was canceled earlier this 
month after only one day of shooting there because of "creative differences" 
between Cohen and star David Carradine. 
</P>
<P>
"It was bad for this town," laments Ashwini Sinha, manager of the Palomino 
Motel, where the production crew of the low-budgeter was housed. 
</P>
<P>
"And it's too bad for me. They were supposed to stay three or four weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Differences between Cohen and Carradine came to a head during an arm-waving and 
shouting match on Halloween evening, according to an eyewitness account in the 
local newspaper, the Optic. The film was almost immediately canceled. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw lots of crew members who were gloomy and crying," Sinha says. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Beth King, managing editor of the Optic, says that Las Vegas will rebound 
-- Turner Broadcasting's "A Miracle in the Wilderness," starring Kris 
Kristofferson, starts filming there this week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a movie capital of sorts in New Mexico," King says of the little town, 
situated 60 miles northeast of Santa Fe. " 'The Heavy' would have been the 12th 
film shot here in 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
Kristofferson was here once before, to shoot "Convoy" (1978). The last 
production to complete filming in Las Vegas, N.M., was "Fool for Love" in 1984.

OUTTAKES: WIND IN THEIR SALES

<P>
Is there room on the Atlantic Ocean -- and on the big screen -- for two 
Christopher Columbuses? 
</P>
<P>
There was room last week in the trade papers for splashy multi-page ads touting 
two such projects, both to be released in 1992 to capitalize on the 500th 
anniversary of the Italian explorer's voyage to North America in the service of 
Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind are working with a script by Mario Puzo, 
"Christopher Columbus: The Movie," with plans to begin shooting in April. They 
claim to have "exclusive" access to Spain's full-size re-creations of the Nina, 
Pinta and Santa Maria, now under construction. The father-and-son team 
responsible for the "Superman" movies will also "use members of the Spanish 
navy as extras," a spokesman tells us. 
</P>
<P>
To be budgeted at $45-$50 million, the Salkinds' film is planned as a July 4, 
1992, global release, with Universal Pictures handling domestic distribution. A 
source reports that David Lean is being considered as director. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, producer-director Ridley Scott plans "Christopher Columbus," from a 
script by French journalist Roselyne Bosch. It will "go beyond the history 
books" to tell "the truth about the man and what happened," says a Scott 
spokeswoman. The film's star -- and start date -- will be announced shortly. 
</P>
<P>
What about the Salkinds' claim to ties with the Spanish government? 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some of the same conversations (with Spanish officials) and they're 
supportive," says the Scott spokeswoman. "1992 is a big year for Spain. They 
won't care if there are 10 films about Christopher Columbus." Pat H. Broeske

 JON HENDRICKS "Freddie Freeloader" Denon 
</P>
<P>
Guest artists abound on this session. George Benson is in splendid virtuosic 
form, singing Hendricks' words to what was originally a Cannonball Adderley sax 
solo on the title cut, from Miles Davis' classic "Kind of Blue" date. 
</P>
<P>
On the same track, Bobby McFerrin sings the Wynton Kelly piano solo, Al Jarreau 
handles lyrics to Miles' solo and Hendricks himself tackles the John Coltrane 
passage. Hendricks' vocals with the Count Basie band on "Fas' Living Blues" and 
"The Finer Things in Life" are delightful. Wynton Marsalis has solos on two 
cuts and Manhattan Transfer, aided by multiple overdubbing, is gloriously 
effective on "High As a Mountain," based on Miles Davis-Gil Evans' "Song Number 
Two." Few weak numbers here, showing Hendricks remains the supreme master of 
vocalese. Leonard Feather

LED ZEPPELIN: THINGS HAVE COME FULL CIRCLE

<TEXT>
<P>
More than 15 years after Led Zeppelin released its last listenable album 
("Physical Graffiti") and 11 after the band released anything new at all, 
Robert Plant's keening wail still threatens to follow any Warrant or Guns N' 
Roses song on any rock radio station anywhere. The arty Zep-isms of neo-metal 
also rule college radio. 
</P>
<P>
The half-dozen or so Zeppelin songs that still get saturation airplay sound 
terrific: intense and bluesy, powerful and dark, riffy and individual. 
Posterity has been kind to the Zep. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantic Records just released "Led Zeppelin," a comprehensive Box Set of the 
Gods, nearly five CD hours of remastered Zeppelin, Inc., complete with arcane 
runic cover art and a trio of hagiographic liner-note essays from Rolling Stone 
magazine all-stars. 
</P>
<P>
Do we need five hours of the stuff? Ten years ago, five minutes would've seemed 
too much. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1980, playing a version of "Communication Breakdown" could get 
you thrown off the stage at the Anticlub or your nose broken at the beach-punk 
Fleetwood. Two minutes of "Black Dog" could empty any hip dorm party in the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when a night of rock 'n' roll could mean anything from 
neo-retro-country to a bunch of art students attacking oil drums with belt 
sanders, Led Zeppelin was about the only taboo . . . well, Led Zeppelin and 
disco -- and the Pet Shop Boys would soon bring disco back bigger than ever. 
(Punk bands could, and did, play even Black Sabbath songs with impunity.) 
</P>
<P>
Turgid stadium rock had so poisoned rock 'n' roll by that point that almost 
anything that wasn't Zeppelin sounded fresh. Well-crafted pop felt new again -- 
listening to the Kinks or early Beatles seemed like a revolutionary act -- and 
so did the unaffected heavy metal of bands like Iron Maiden and Def Leppard. 
</P>
<P>
Stripped-down, singles-oriented, bombast-free new wave was a specific reaction 
to the overblown album rock of Zeppelin and its school. Reggae, ABBA, George 
Jones were suddenly cool as well, and "alternative" rock radio meant pretty 
much this: no "Stairway to Heaven." 
</P>
<P>
Things have come full circle. Led Zeppelin is now acknowledged to be the 
greatest hard-rock band in the history of the world, mostly by people too old 
to really appreciate Metallica. 
</P>
<P>
Zep revisionism is understandable. In retrospect, the band represents an era of 
rock as surely as Elvis or the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
Zeppelin was in its time a reaction to the vapid tyranny of the three-minute 
single; a decade later, the rock 'n' roll intelligentsia were celebrating the 
prospect of a Zep-free planet, and only long-haired, working-class dolts seemed 
to prefer "Houses of the Holy" to Prince's "Dirty Mind." 
</P>
<P>
With the '80s, the three-minute radio song became more dominant than it ever 
had been in the '60s. Bands like the Go-Go's were not only as popular, but more 
credible than their '60s equivalents. Pop singers like Madonna and Michael 
Jackson were seen as artists. 
</P>
<P>
Where Led Zeppelin defined the terms for hard-rock bands of the '70s from 
Boston to Rush, the tight, commercial sound of Aerosmith became the model for 
'80s hard rockers from Van Halen through Guns N' Roses and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
Lyrics in the '80s were about sex, school, the everyday -- not about ancient 
Celtic battles. If the new generation of rockers weren't exactly one with its 
audience, at least it felt it had to try to be. Zep-style posing -- arched-back 
singer, long solos, lyrics that could conceivably be illustrated by Frank 
Frazetta -- was just silly, Spinal Tap stuff. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the decade, the artists most often compared to Zeppelin were 
those riffy art bands, Soundgarden and Jane's Addiction, who offered abstract 
lyrics, songs based more on moods than hooks, and something of the Zep's sheer 
power. 
</P>
<P>
New-metalists Metallica -- who rivaled Zeppelin not only in influence but in 
the utter incomprehensibility of their appeal to the uninitiated -- had 
rehabilitated not only album-oriented rock but the potent communal high of the 
arena concert. A lot of Led Zeppelin suddenly started to sound pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
In light of David Byrne and Peter Gabriel's musical wanderings, the Zep's 
penchant for tablas and Celtic folk tunes seems more prescient than 
self-indulgent, the sort of thing that would earn them a guest spot on KCRW's 
"Morning Becomes Eclectic." 
</P>
<P>
Zep's erratic song structures sound merely eccentric alongside the artful 
meanderings of Jane's Addiction. If in interviews Jimmy Page mewled about 
Stravinsky and Gustav Holst, he'd at least heard of those composers, which is 
more than you can say for most rock stars. 
</P>
<P>
"Led Zeppelin" and "Led Zeppelin II" are in retrospect awesome British blues, 
as pure as anything this side of the first Stones album but with a swamp-blues 
intensity new to white rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
"Led Zeppelin III" might have been a failed trope on the misty-heather 
acousticisms of Traffic and Pentangle, but led off with the extremely 
influential "Immigrant Song." The untitled fourth album, though it included the 
stultifyingly pretentious ballad "Battle of Evermore," is the masterpiece of 
the genre, as unassailable within the context of '70s hard rock as Marvin 
Gaye's "Let's Get It On" is within the context of '70s R&amp;B. 
</P>
<P>
"Houses of the Holy" and "Physical Graffiti" were less consistent -- only half 
the songs hit -- though only compared to earlier Zep, not to, say, Bad Company. 
(Of everything on the last four albums, only one song, "Nobody's Fault but 
Mine," was up to the standards of the first four.) 
</P>
<P>
Time has softened memories of satin bell-bottoms, half-hour drum solos, and 
drippy 45-minute versions of "Dazed and Confused" that always climaxed with a 
quarter hour of Page's guitar-noise party tricks. Not to mention the inevitable 
bass solo on "No Quarter." The universe of bong hits, converted vans and Jimmy 
Page posters universally used as white-male-teen wallpaper doesn't seem quite 
so awful anymore. 
</P>
<P>
But in a way, the new Led Zeppelin set can remind you of how bloated and 
directionless the band's live show used to be -- you can almost imagine 
producer Page cuing the re-mastering guy with an outstretched violin bow. 
There's about four hours more than anybody really needs, two-thirds of 
everything they ever did arranged more or less chronologically, and with only 
two of the 54 songs previously unavailable on album. 
</P>
<P>
A better-culled selection might have presented a more coherent portrait of the 
band. As it is, you emerge from a couple of hours with these CDs feeling as if 
you've been gorging on Chee-tos. 
</P>
<P>
There seems to be less from the first two albums and way more of the late stuff 
than the quality of the material dictates. You'd think that a decade of 
hindsight would've persuaded Page of the merits of "The Lemon Song" and the 
horrors of "Achilles Last Stand." 
</P>
<P>
The sound is richer than the thin, tinny timbre of the currently available CDs. 
The track order is mildly interesting -- it's almost shocking to hear 
"Heartbreaker" instead of "What Is and What Shall Never Be" roar into your 
speakers after "Whole Lotta Love," but the effect is nothing any Zep fan 
couldn't do himself with a tape deck and a spare afternoon. Even the two "new" 
tracks have been widely available on bootlegs since the early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there's not a hard-rocker alive who can resist cranking up his Alpine 
when the first low moans of "Whole Lotta Love" come blasting across the room. 
And maybe that's the way it's supposed to be.

COSTELLO'S TRUE AIM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 ELVIS COSTELLO "Girls Girls Girls" Columbia 
</P>
<P>
This master of words showed such immediate passion and skill that after just 
two albums in the late '70s, he was hailed as the finest rock songwriter to 
come out of Britain since since the '60s class of Lennon-McCartney, Davies and 
Townshend. 
</P>
<P>
No one since Dylan had zeroed in quite so convincingly on hypocrisy and deceit 
in both relationships and the social order as Costello -- and no one had 
attacked those traits so unflinchingly. 
</P>
<P>
While the flashes of verbal warfare and rage gave Costello the reputation as 
rock's angry young man, there were also elements of compassion and comfort in 
many of the early songs -- as Costello acknowledged his own weaknesses and 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
The material on those two albums, "My Aim Is True" and "This Year's Model," 
combined wicked wit and blistering observation into such compact, near 
sing-along formats that many early fans of Costello still look on those songs 
as his best work. 
</P>
<P>
One of the revelations of "Girls Girls Girls" is how, in truth, Costello has 
grown as an artist: His work has advanced in both sophistication and insight 
despite what might have looked at some points in his career like artistic 
detours almost as puzzling as those of Neil Young and Lou Reed. 
</P>
<P>
As suggested by the playful album title (taken from one of Elvis Presley's most 
forgettable '60s movies), many of the songs are about relationships -- though 
Costello uses women as a convenient symbol for tales of desire and 
disappointment that are meant to reflect on the nature of the human character, 
male and female. 
</P>
<P>
The songwriter is our guide on this retrospective album, not just selecting and 
sequencing the 47 songs on the CD version (51 songs on the much realigned 
cassette edition), but also reflecting in the often humorous, self-depreciating 
liner notes on the background of the songs. 
</P>
<P>
He says 1979's tenacious "Pump It Up" was written shortly after rock's sex 'n' 
drugs lifestyle beckoned, adding good-naturedly, "This anti-rock 'n' roll song 
was my last stand before I gave in to it completely." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than follow chronological order, Costello mixes selections according to 
mood and loose-knit themes. By following "Party Girl" with "Shabby Doll" and 
then "Motel Matches," for instance, Costello forces us to listen to songs with 
dramatically different emotional shadings in marvelously unexected and 
revealing new contexts. 
</P>
<P>
For much of his career, Costello released albums so fast that you wondered if 
he thought every idea that came into his head was worth sharing on record. The 
lesson of "Girls Girls Girls" is that, aside from some occasional obliqueness, 
they were worth sharing.ROBERT HILBURN

 1/2 Jasmine Guy, "Jasmine Guy," Warner Bros. While the "Different World" 
star's debut album has its good points, it sounds as if it was recorded by 
someone who won't need to depend on record sales for her success. 
</P>
<P>
It has one exceptional track: "Try Me," an unflinching bit of funk produced by 
Full Force. There's not an abundance of memorable songs here, but one that 
qualifies is "Everybody Knows My Name," a Guy co-composition in which she 
emphatically declares, "To be my man / You got to understand / I'm in demand." 
A little attitude is acceptable, but a few more songs of the caliber of "Try 
Me" would have been a lot more welcome. CONNIE JOHNSON

Come and See (Bravo Sunday at 10 p.m.) Eminent Soviet director Elam Klimov's 
ambitious, grueling 1985 film depicts the savagery of the Germans in 
Byelorussia during World War II through the eyes of a sturdy peasant youth 
(Alexei Kravchenko) eager to join the brave Soviet partisans. A bold, stylized, 
largely successful attempt to make a familiar story fresh.

DON'T BE A 'WISEGUY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I, and many women I know, are furious with Stephen J. Cannell for quarreling 
with and getting rid of Ken Wahl. Without him, "Wiseguy" is just another 
violent show. 
</P>
<P>
We all loved Vinnie and wanted there to be more of him and his love life, and 
less of the many gangsters. 
</P>
<P>
Cannell left Vinnie -- half out of his mind after that horrible episode in that 
wet little Oregon town with the crazy mayor -- delivering disgusting bloody 
garbage to the dump and stealing watches for money. What is all this nonsense 
-- a grudge of some kind? 
</P>
<P>
Please, Mr. Cannell, bring Vinnie (Ken Wahl, only Ken Wahl) back, and we will 
watch "Wiseguy" as often as it airs.

ART WORLD: ENVIRONMENTAL AESTHETIC MAY BE TOXIC TO POLLUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAUNA SNOW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FACES 
</P>
<P>
"This is not about pure aesthetics, because I'm more interested in art and 
aesthetics being a world function and becoming part of the community," says 
artist Sylvia Bowyer about her installation, "The Prevailing Winds," which 
opens at Venice's Beyond Baroque Gallery on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The piece features a wall-sized map of Los Angeles County marked with the 
locations of about 50 companies that, according to the federal Environmental 
Protection Agency, emit carcinogenic chemicals and waste. Bowyer's explanatory 
text includes wording from a state-ordered environmental report aimed at 
helping such companies with their community relations efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"If art can help protect a community's well-being, then I think that is a 
beautiful aesthetic statement," said Bowyer, 34, a recent CalArts graduate. 
"And I like the idea of art and the aesthetic process being accessible to many 
people. With this piece, it's important that people come over and take a look, 
but it's also important that they follow up on some of the information and find 
out about it for themselves. If that happens, I'll consider the installation a 
success." 
</P>
<P>
In designing the piece, Bowyer focused on five toxic chemicals -- ethylene 
oxide, petrochloroethylene, benzene, methylene chloride and chromium compounds. 
According to EPA data, each of the 50 polluters shown on Bowyer's map produce 
more than 30,000 pounds of at least one of these chemicals every year. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea for the installation came from reading articles on environmental 
racism (the observation that environmental hazards are often placed in poorer, 
ethnic communities) and wondering if race does play a role," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what this piece is about -- distribution. It's not so much about smog, 
as about cancer-causing pollutants and where they're located. What I want to 
show is who is being affected by this." 
</P>
<P>
Despite spending the past few months on the project -- which, the artist 
stressed, has been a collaborative effort with a number of friends and fellow 
CalArts grads -- Bowyer called it "basically a work in progress," and plans to 
continue with the piece by presenting spin-off installations in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Bowyer's previous installation, "American Grade," was included in April's 
"Artists and the Environment" show at Pasadena's Armory Center for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
THE SCENE 
</P>
<P>
Rumors that Louis Newman Galleries is leaving its 10-year home on Beverly Drive 
are not true, according to manager Perri Guthrie. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been getting calls, and people have been coming in and asking, and in 
fact we're not leaving, we're expanding," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But the current expansion into an adjoining facility (making the gallery's 
total space about 4,000 square feet -- nearly a third more than before) is 
temporary, Guthrie said, noting that the gallery plans to move into an even 
larger space across the street in about a year. 
</P>
<P>
DEBUTS 
</P>
<P>
Scottish painter Callum Innes, 28, has his first U.S. show at Melrose Avenue's

participated in a number of exhibitions, including the prestigious British Art 
Show, which presents major new talent. 
</P>
<P>
Local artist Holly Crawford's first Los Angeles solo exhibition at Wade Gallery 
on La Cienega opens Friday and runs through Dec. 15. Titled "Roots," the show 
of paintings and drawings uses common objects and geometric forms, such as a 
square, as the "root" concept upon which the works are based. 
</P>
<P>

AN ODYSSEY THROUGH GREEK CUISINE; 
</P>
<P>
THE FOOD AT CAFE ATHENS IS SO GOOD, PATRONS WONDER IF IT'S AUTHENTIC. EVEN THE 
DANCING WAITERS ARE OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the time I spent in Greece, the food was always disappointing in the 
restaurants. I rarely sensed an insistence on the best ingredients, or an 
attempt to get the best out of the ingredients available. Everything seemed to 
be served at the same temperature, whether it was salad or shish kebab, coffee 
or rice pudding. I came across baklava that was like shoe leather in syrup. 
</P>
<P>
One American woman of Greek ancestry, now living in Greece, practically blushes 
when asked where the good food is. "The restaurant tradition isn't very well 
developed," she says defensively. She mutters about a couple of little places 
in Athens, and says she's eaten well in some homes. Tough luck for me, though. 
</P>
<P>
So I was dubious when I heard about the opening of an ambitious Greek 
restaurant called Cafe Athens (in a rather jinxed Santa Monica location that 
has recently seen restaurants open and close at the rate of about one a year). 
And when I heard there were dancing waiters, my hands involuntarily reached up 
to protect my ears; since the '60s, American Greek restaurants have developed 
the tradition of cranking up the music every couple of minutes when dancing 
waiters come out to intrude on everybody's dinner. 
</P>
<P>
If I could have seen the interior of the place, I would have known that all was 
well. Cafe Athens is owned by the same people who own the Great Greek in 
Sherman Oaks, and the walls have the same stark, impressive graphic style. Only 
here, they are covered not with old Greek newspapers and nostalgic Greek 
political slogans (such as "Bulgarians Out!"), but with huge photos of famous 
Greeks and Greek-Americans and their names, writ very large: "SAVALAS." 
"LOUGANIS." "ONASSIS." 
</P>
<P>
And like the Great Greek, Cafe Athens serves the kind of food I always hoped to 
find in Greece. It's so rich and carefully prepared that you hear people openly 
doubt that it's authentic. Indeed, one of the owners freely admits traveling to 
various countries around the eastern Mediterranean to find the best versions of 
dishes, which is perfectly legitimate, since many of the dishes are part of a 
common heritage throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
The food tends to be impressive, and impressively varied. Big, meaty stuffed 
grape leaves with a distinct dill flavor under the egg-lemon sauce. Sharp, 
garlicky cucumbers in yogurt (tzatziki). The richest fish-roe sauce (tarama) 
I've ever had, practically like fish-roe butter. An eggplant dip that at first 
brings to mind the Lebanese baba ghannuj, but is almost ethereally light; it 
tastes of yogurt rather than sesame. 
</P>
<P>
Saganaki, the cheese served flaming in cognac, is a bit of a Greek restaurant 
cliche, but it really is good here, splashed with lemon juice at the end. The 
octopus in the octopus salad is tender without being mushy, and the raucous, 
oregano-flavored vinaigrette makes octopus seem a more fun-loving food than it 
usually is. Taverna-style eggplant is sliced and fried Japanese eggplant served 
cold with a sweet tomato sauce that could be Italian. 
</P>
<P>
I did find the spiced meatballs a little strange -- they have a peculiar doughy 
envelope around them, and seem to be the one item served at room temperature 
that should be warm. The hummus and the tabbouli could use a little lemon 
juice, but of course one thing you're absolutely sure of finding in a Greek 
restaurant is quartered lemons. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Great Greek, Cafe Athens offers what it calls a "family-style deluxe 
dinner" that consists of 15 items. They're smallish portions, and it's a little 
hard to say what's an appetizer and what's an entree, but then the menu is 
altogether casual about that distinction. In many cases it's just a matter of 
the size of the portion. 
</P>
<P>
Some items are so rich you'd be crazy to order them as appetizers, unless you 
want to knock down your appetite in a real hurry. The moussaka is one, 
approximately three times as meaty as any moussaka I had in Greece. The 
pastichio (the name is more often spelled pastitsio) is also fantastically 
rich: a 3 1/2-inch-high rectangle of macaroni mixed with ground meat and a bit 
of tomato, topped with sauce bechamel (which is as Greek as mayonnaise is 
American) and grated Parmesan. 
</P>
<P>
The entrees make the usual specialty of lamb and seafood. The lamb is 
particularly good, especially the wonderfully sweet and tender rack of baby 
lamb. The oven-roasted lamb (one of the items also included in the family-style 
dinner) is roasted quite brown but is as tender as if it had been stewed. As 
for the fried calamari -- I've been wondering how they get those big, thick 
rings of squid to remain so tender? 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes you come across sausage at a Greek restaurant. Here there are two: a 
gamy lamb sausage and a veal sausage loud with black pepper, both roughly 
grilled and served with green beans in a meaty tomato sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Peasant-style chopped beefsteak sounds and even looks like Salisbury steak 
under a new name, but it's actually one of the best things on the menu. The 
meat, which is enjoyably mixed with chopped onion, really does have a steak 
flavor, and the effect is underscored with a red wine sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The menu unexpectedly has a section titled "Greek and Sicilian Pastas," whose 
specialty is something called burned-butter pasta. This is angel hair sauteed 
with browned butter and garlic and sprinkled with kasseri cheese, and you get a 
sample of it in the family-style dinner. You can also order it as an entree, 
but in my experience, enjoyable as it is, a whole plate of it gets to be a bit 
much. 
</P>
<P>
The dessert list is a little short, and not really as exciting as the rest of 
the menu. The rice pudding is authentically sweet and the galaktobouriko (a 
sort of custard-filled baklava) authentically heavy. The baklava has a walnut 
filling so astonishingly thick I wonder whether it's ever served this way in 
Greece; it's like an American deep-dish nut pie in filo. The honey nut parfait 
is really the most fun: a small scoop of vanilla ice cream and four drifts of 
whipped cream sprinkled with walnut and pistachio and powerfully flavored Greek 
honey from Mt. Hymettus. 
</P>
<P>
And now the time has come to face the question of the dancing waiters. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there are dancing waiters, Wednesday through Sunday. No, the musicians (a 
live Greek trio) do not crank up the volume when they come out; no, the dancers 
do not try to bully people into dancing with them. Some of the customers do 
join in, though -- I've seen one do the dance in which you overturn a glass of 
water on a plate and step balancing it on your forehead. 
</P>
<P>
They don't just do a couple of bozo steps, but fairly complicated line dances. 
There's the solo dancing made famous in "Never on Sunday" and some routines 
where one man squats on the floor while another does steps that could be 
dangerous for the squatter if he weren't perfectly coordinated. 
</P>
<P>
Cafe Athens is great Greek food (that is, Great Greek-style food) plus great 
Greek dancing. Not long ago I wouldn't have thought any of that possible.

LOWDOWN ON MOMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I saw the "High &amp; Low" exhibition on Oct. 13, and contrary to Knight's 
declaration that the exhibit is a "flop," I thoroughly enjoyed it, as did the 
huge crowd. 
</P>
<P>
But, then, we only represent about 99% of the people. We are not educated or 
sophisticated in art history or theory. 
</P>
<P>
What a treat it was to see Warhol's Campbell Soup series, Lichtenstein's 
vibrant "As I Opened Fire," Picasso's "Gertrude Stein" and Jenny Holzer's 
dramatic LED signs and tiles. 
</P>
<P>
I have been to the major museums around the world. Although I am not 
artistically knowledgeable by Mr. Knight's definition, I know what I like, and 
you know what? That's all that matters.

STALLONE'S STARDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for Christon's insightful article. I have admired Stallone's drive 
and career since he walked into my office as a virtual unknown starring in a 
tiny film called "Rocky." 
</P>
<P>
As then-president of the Rogers &amp; Cowan Motion Picture Division, I, along 
with my staff, had the assignment of publicizing "Rocky" and, ultimately, 
Stallone. 
</P>
<P>
It was apparent from the first meeting that Stallone knew who he was; it was 
not apparent that he would become the biggest movie star in the world, but, as 
the early moguls of this industry always said, a star is born when the camera 
loves you and the audience loves you -- and both did when he played the roles 
that were pure Stallone. 
</P>
<P>
I always wonder why the media finds it necessary to look for more. Stallone is 
Stallone, and a very good one at that. "Macbeth"? "Richard III"? Leave them to 
Derek Jacobi, perhaps the greatest stage actor of our time (but) who just 
doesn't work on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
Christon points out Sly's human side and the pain that goes with always being 
in a window. Maybe it will help the public understand what goes on when one 
becomes a "star."

'FANTASIA' AND CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is in response to an Oct. 28 letter in which Dr. C. Fortenberry complains 
of an evening being ruined because three seconds of "Fantasia" were seen as 
racist. 
</P>
<P>
Good God, first the old Dick Tracy cartoon, now this! Why are we comparing the 
morals and values of old movies and television to current standards? 
</P>
<P>
Should Jackie Gleason's "The Honeymooners" be censored because Ralph's sexist 
attitude is not popular now? Is "Singin' in the Rain" offensive because it's 
not drought-conscious? 
</P>
<P>
If "Fantasia" were to be made today, I'm sure a racially offensive scene would 
not even be considered. But 50 years ago even Walt Disney didn't have the 
foresight to know that showing dark-skinned characters serving light-skinned 
characters would be considered offensive. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, society has matured to a point that such portrayals are no longer 
appropriate. Let's celebrate that fact instead of letting something that 
happened long ago ruin an evening.

I've been reading Calendar for 15 years and never before was I so moved as by 
the sadness, complexity and innocence of Lawrence Christon's interview with 
Sylvester Stallone (Oct. 28).

Rocky and Rambo were only Stallone's adolescence; now the real man can shine on

TRANSPLANT NURSE PULLS 'GIFT OF LIFE' FROM DEATH;

Virginia Zimmer watches for death. 
</P>
<P>
It's grim work, but she can't let death have the final say. 
</P>
<P>
At St. Alphonsus Regional Medical Center, Zimmer matches organ donors with 
people from all over the country who also watch for death. 
</P>
<P>
There are miracles, and she somehow finds ways to turn grief and tragedy into 
joy. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell people it's the gift of life -- it's the finest gift we can give," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For the thousands of seriously ill with diseased hearts, kidneys and livers, 
the choice is simple -- a transplant or death. They wait anxiously for the call 
that another person has died so they might live. 
</P>
<P>
The donors share a profile. They die quickly, violently. It may be a traffic 
accident, a blood vessel exploding in the brain, a suicide. In any event, the 
brain is destroyed while the organs still function. 
</P>
<P>
Almost always, they're young. 
</P>
<P>
"They're 16- to 20-year-olds. . . . That's why it's difficult. They're the hope 
of the family. They die, and it's tough," said Zimmer, 55. 
</P>
<P>
The awful moment comes when the family is told their loved one is dead. 
Machines can maintain the organs in a brain-dead person for a couple of days at 
most. Zimmer must work quickly, compassionately. 
</P>
<P>
Gently, she tells the family of the donor program. She answers questions. The 
grieving struggle to understand. 
</P>
<P>
"Eighty percent say yes," she said. "I've never had anybody get angry with a 
request to donate. They can only say no." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Zimmer volunteered to coordinate organ donation at St. Alphonsus on 
top of her regular duties as a nurse educator. Her 24 years as an 
intensive-care nurse were ideal training. 
</P>
<P>
The volunteer work grew into the full-time position she assumed in August, 
working with all the hospitals in southwestern Idaho. A top priority for Zimmer 
is to educate the public about the donor program. 
</P>
<P>
Her first year, she managed 13 donor cases. There were 14 the following year. 
Then eight. And only four donors so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
In any given year, only 8,500 to 12,000 people can be considered to be donors, 
says Wanda Bond, a spokeswoman for the United Network for Organ Sharing in 
Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be that hospitals already burdened with bureaucracy and red tape see 
the donor program as just one more thing to do," Bond said. She also thinks 
stricter drunk-driving laws, higher seat-belt use and motorcycle helmet laws 
all may affect the number of available donors. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, donors of solid organs such as the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys and 
pancreas fell from 3,975 two years ago to 3,898 in 1989. Yet the number of 
transplants rose more than 5% to 13,384, through multiple use of donor organs. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmer says up to half a dozen recipients may benefit from the organs of one 
donor. A donor also can provide eyes for cornea transplants, bone to graft onto 
shattered limbs and skin to protect burn patients. 
</P>
<P>
"When they can donate, it helps the donor family almost as much as the 
recipient family," Zimmer said. 
</P>
<P>
After a patient has died and permission is obtained from relatives to donate 
organs or tissue, an intricate choreography involving scores of people is 
performed. Most of the work must be done within 12 to 18 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"We treat (the donor) respectfully," said Merry Reed, an intensive-care nurse 
at St. Alphonsus. "But we can't treat them as though they're going to get well. 
Now you're working to save another life -- or three or four lives -- with the 
organs." 
</P>
<P>
If the heart or other organs have been donated, Zimmer is on the phone with the 
national organ-sharing network for its lists of the people needing organ 
transplants. 
</P>
<P>
The lists are brutally efficient. Only the most feeble rise to the top. The 
likelihood of survival through an organ transplant increases only as a person's 
medical condition deteriorates. 
</P>
<P>
Lab work is done to check for hepatitis and AIDS. Blood pressure is stabilized. 
The chest is measured. The kidneys are kept working. Organ recovery teams fly 
in from Salt Lake City or Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
A heart must be transplanted within four hours after being removed from a 
donor. Lungs, two hours. A liver, 24 hours. Kidneys, 72 hours. 
</P>
<P>
More than 17,000 people in the United States are waiting for kidney 
transplants. Nearly 1,000 need liver transplants. An additional 1,700 need 
hearts. 
</P>
<P>
Nine months ago, Virginia Zimmer's own son, Joe, died in a car wreck. He was 28 
and strong, a former Marine. The nurses at St. Alphonsus, out of respect for 
their co-worker's feelings, didn't ask her the obvious question. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmer, in her grief, didn't remember until it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have donated his eyes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She pauses. 
</P>
<P>
"The ones who feel badly are the ones who weren't asked."

N.Y. HOUSE MEMBER FOLLOWS IN HER FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS;

<P>
POLITICS: REP. SUSAN MOLINARI WANTS TO CONTINUE SOME OF THE WORK HE STARTED IN 
CONGRESS. BUT DIFFERENCES IN GENDER AND GENERATION SURFACE.

<P>
Rep. Susan Molinari would like to become so powerful that she could change 
women's fashion. 
</P>
<P>
No more high heels or pantyhose. Ever. 
</P>
<P>
"When people make jokes about God being a woman, I say, 'I don't think so, 
because then we wouldn't have the babies or stockings,' " she said. "That was 
something a man did." 
</P>
<P>
She rolls down the top of one black suede boot to prove she's a fashion rebel. 
"I wear boots all the time so I can wear knee socks." 
</P>
<P>
Molinari has a way to go before Fashion Avenue takes its cue from her. But the 
New York Republican is becoming better known around Capitol Hill, where she has 
been since winning a special election in March. Voters reelected her in las 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, just six months into her term, Molinari won her first big fight in 
Congress, defeating an amendment proposed by 21-term Rep. Charles E. Bennett 
(D-Fla.). 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, a powerful member of the House Armed Services Committee, proposed 
closing the Navy home port on Staten Island, N.Y. -- the heart of Molinari's 
district. The home port, which is about 90% complete, is opposed by New York 
Mayor David N. Dinkins and every member of the New York City congressional 
delegation except Molinari and Rep. Tom J. Manton, a Queens Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
Closing the home port would be cheaper than opening it, Bennett argued. 
</P>
<P>
But Molinari, who at 32 is the youngest member of Congress, stood boldly on the 
House floor and hit her fellow congressmen where they live. 
</P>
<P>
"Your base could be next," she warned ominously. 
</P>
<P>
The House voted 230 to 188 in favor of Molinari's substitute amendment to save 
the base. She was ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
That evening, Guy Molinari offered a champagne toast to his daughter's big 
feet, an admission that they were finally large enough to fill his shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Molinari, an only child, succeeded her father to Congress. She is only 
the second daughter in history to do so. Winnifred Mason Huck (R-Ill.) followed 
her father, William Mason Huck, when he died in 1921. 
</P>
<P>
After five terms in Congress, Guy Molinari retired last year to run, 
successfully, for Staten Island borough president. 
</P>
<P>
To try for the House, Susan Molinari gave up a seat on the New York City 
Council that she had won in 1985. As the lone Republican in the 35-member body, 
she was minority leader from Day One and received such perks as a city car, 
extra staff and an office in City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
But, she said during a recent interview, "There was a certain level of 
frustration in being a member of the New York City Council." 
</P>
<P>
For example, she could never become chairwoman of a committee, and getting 
bills passed could be tough. 
</P>
<P>
Plus, she said, "some of the most important problems that are confronting my 
district are environmental problems, and those have to be handled on the 
federal level because of our proximity to New Jersey." 
</P>
<P>
Staten Island is downwind of New Jersey's huge petrochemical industry and 
Molinari believes that's why her constituents have such a high rate of 
respiratory ailments. 
</P>
<P>
So while she is now one of 435 and still in the minority to boot, Molinari 
feels it's easier than she expected to get things done in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected the place to be more arcane in terms of participation in committees 
and ability to get legislation passed, to speak on the floor," she said. "In 
fact, I find it's a pretty open institution. I find it less political than I 
ever expected it to be." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Molinari came to Washington with many advantages her fellow freshmen 
lack. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always received a lot of benefits both politically and personally 
having Guy Molinari as my father," she said. "However, having a record of 6 1/2 
years in the City Council, people did have something to judge." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that her father was New York state chairman of George Bush's election 
committee in 1988 didn't hurt, either. Bush appeared at a fund-raiser for Susan 
Molinari in February, partly to repay the debt to her father. The event pulled 
in about $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Molinari said she hopes to continue some of the work her father started 
in Congress -- and especially to see the home port open and running. But she 
said she disagrees with her father on some key issues, particularly those that 
define differences in gender and generation. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, she's an abortion rights advocate while he's anti-abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"That's something that pre-dates my political involvement," she said, admitting 
that the two of them don't even discuss the issue anymore. 
</P>
<P>
She said she also places a higher priority on the issues of day care and 
parental leave. 
</P>
<P>
Molinari said she is fitting pretty well into the Washington life, renting an 
apartment in nearby Alexandria, Va., and returning home on weekends.

AUSTRALIAN OUTBACK IS OVERRUN AS RABBIT POPULATION REACHES PLAGUE PROPORTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SYDNEY, Australia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the Australian outback the hills are alive with rabbits -- hundreds of 
millions of them. 
</P>
<P>
Forty years after the disease myxomatosis almost rid the world's driest 
continent of the imported pest, the rabbit population is back in plague 
proportions and growing by the second. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers fear that the Southern Hemisphere summer just beginning will bring 
disaster on the scale of the 1940s, when rabbits regularly ate their way 
through the nation's crops. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the rabbit population start at about 200 million, the last 
official estimate in 1988, and spiral toward 1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia say the threat posed 
by rabbits is the worst in a generation. One farmer hired professionals who 
shot 60,000 rabbits in one month on his 41,000-acre property in the west of New 
South Wales. 
</P>
<P>
"They've done more damage than any other single thing in Australia's history, 
and they now have a population to do it all over again," said Howard Moxham of 
the New South Wales Farmers' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Three years of unseasonally heavy rainfall have increased grass and plant 
growth on marginal land, allowing the rabbit's fabled breeding capabilities to 
run rampant. 
</P>
<P>
"Rabbits present the worst threat to the environment New South Wales has faced 
in 40 years," said farmer Dick Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
"The impact of rabbits is one of complete devastation. They breed and breed . . 
. and eat everything in their path." 
</P>
<P>
Wild rabbits were introduced to Australia when a farmer in Victoria named 
Thomas Austin set free 13 of 24 rabbits sent over from Britain to breed for 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
"The portents are very worrying," said Brian Cooke of South Australia's Animal 
and Pest Control Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally rabbits breed for three to four months, but that's been extended to 
eight or nine in each of the past three years because of good rains." 
</P>
<P>
A female rabbit can breed every month of the breeding season. Assuming a 
five-month season, in theory it is possible for a single pair of rabbits to 
have produced more than 62,000 descendants by the end of three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
While wet weather is the main culprit, the decreasing effectiveness of 
myxomatosis, an infectious viral disease, in reducing the population is adding 
to the current problems. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists estimate the mortality rate of infected rabbits is now about 60%, 
compared to 99% when the virus was introduced in the early 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
The myxomatosis virus, carried by mosquitoes, has also spread less effectively 
in the drier "outback" areas away from the coast. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers are again looking to science to find a solution to the present plague, 
but that will take time. 
</P>
<P>
The government-financed Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research 
Organization said it will take at least five years to develop a new genetically 
engineered myxomatosis virus, which it hopes will kill rabbits and sterilize 
the survivors. 
</P>
<P>
Fleas carrying the virus will be dropped into warrens where, it is hoped, they 
will transmit it throughout the colonies. The plan is to make the virus about 
60% to 70% effective, so the virus can survive and reinfect successive 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
"It will have a built-in long-term efficiency," said a spokesman. "The rabbits 
won't become immune because they will die from something unrelated to the 
disease they contract." 
</P>
<P>
Farmers are pinning their hopes in the near term on viral hemorrhagic disease 
(VHD), which is transmitted among rabbits by direct contact, resembles 
influenza in its effects and has cut a swathe through Europe's rabbit 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Australian authorities are carrying out stringent tests before letting that 
virus loose here, but the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research 
Organization, which is not involved in VHD's development, does not believe it 
is the solution. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't have the same long-term efficiency because the young will quickly 
develop immunity," its spokesman said. "We expect the rabbit population to 
bounce back after an initial slump." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials are concentrating on persuading farmers to attack rabbits 
with everything they've got. They are also urging environmentalists to take the 
problem seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers are being urged to rip out or blow out warrens, and to try poisoning 
the rabbits when all else fails.

SCIENTISTS SEEK AN OUT-OF-THIS WORLD 'GREETING CARD' TO COMMUNICATE WITH ALIENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDER FERGUSON, REUTERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
DRESDEN, Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists have been avidly debating how to communicate with aliens from outer 
space in a city where a long-distance telephone call to fellow earthlings is 
hard enough. 
</P>
<P>
Last month's 41st International Astronautical Congress in Dresden, eastern 
Germany, was dedicated to ensuring that if little green beings ever show up on 
telescopes, or doorsteps, we will be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to assume two things about them: They have radio technology and can 
count," said Carl DeVito, a mathematics professor from Arizona University. 
</P>
<P>
The latest IAC, which annually reviews progress in space exploration, evaluated 
efforts to invent a new language for communicating with creatures from another 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the scientists chose a venue where the antiquated telephone system 
of what was formerly East Germany made it difficult to contact families and 
friends by long-distance phone calls, let alone make contact with aliens. 
</P>
<P>
With their smart Western suits and shiny blue name tags, the scientists 
themselves stood out like extraterrestrials among the shabbily dressed locals. 
</P>
<P>
The weeklong congress, which was opened by German Science Minister Heinz 
Riesenhuber, drew thousands of delegates. 
</P>
<P>
Flying saucers may be the stuff of science fiction, but scientists have long 
presumed that someone else is out there somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Voyager space probe spun off into outer space in the 1970s carrying 
pictures depicting life on Earth and a recorded message from then U.N. 
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim. 
</P>
<P>
There has been no response so far. But Jill Tarter, a scientist from the Search 
for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) institute, said Earth should start 
preparing for how to react when we discover we are not alone. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nobody who writes international greeting cards, but we have to find 
one for the world," she told a committee reviewing SETI's work, which is 
financed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Tarter said the U.N. should adopt guidelines telling humans how to approach 
their first alien. 
</P>
<P>
Her paper admitted that some may think there would be little point to the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"In the absence of compelling evidence of an extraterrestrial intelligence, it 
may be difficult to sustain high-level interest in this issue," the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
NASA launched an $80-million project in 1982 to transmit signals to aliens in 
outer space, but scientists at the congress said more taxpayer money was needed 
to pick up the long-awaited response. 
</P>
<P>
German scientist Sebastien von Hoerner said Earth needs a huge radiotelescope 
in its southern hemisphere, costing millions of dollars, to speed up the 
search. 
</P>
<P>
But the hardest part remains unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to say something but we don't know how," DeVito said. 
</P>
<P>
Previous research on communicating with aliens focused on trying to teach 
extraterrestrials a language. That was the aim of Dutch mathematician Hans 
Freudenthal, who wrote a book on a "language for cosmic intercourse." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the promising subject of this pioneering work of the 1960s, DeVito 
said, its approach was too slow. 
</P>
<P>
It would be quicker to seek common ground with whatever arrived, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic problem is how to get out of our brains and into reality," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Aliens should be presented with a picture of reality, with captions 
representing the image in a scientific or mathematical language, he said. 
</P>
<P>
His approach is based on the principle of the Rosetta stone, a plaque found in 
the Egyptian desert in 1799 by Napoleonic troops. 
</P>
<P>
The stone had Egyptian hieroglyphics translated into two other languages, 
enabling scholars to decipher the ancient language of the Pharaohs for modern 
man. 
</P>
<P>
DeVito would first like to confront any little green beings with an image 
showing an ocean, then an ice field followed by an iceberg. Each picture has a 
caption.

SINGAPORE NOW A LEADER IN BABY-MAKING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Singapore, once the most successful country at discouraging reproduction, is 
now a world leader in the science of making babies. 
</P>
<P>
"Our results are one of the best in the world," said Dr. Maurine Tsakok, head 
of Singapore General Hospital's obstetrics and gynecology department. "In Asian 
terms, we are well ahead." 
</P>
<P>
National University Hospital claimed a world first recently when it achieved a 
pregnancy with fertilized eggs kept alive in an "artificial womb" of human 
tubal cells for two days. 
</P>
<P>
At Singapore General, Tsakok claims a success rate of 28% for each in-vitro 
fertilization treatment, in which the egg is fertilized outside the body and 
then implanted in the womb. The success rate elsewhere in the world is 10% to 
20%. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, these advances were made in a country that once told its couples to 
"stop at two" children and backed up its exhortations with financial 
disincentives for those who didn't. 
</P>
<P>
That policy worked too well, however, and when the population began to drop, 
the government rushed to reverse itself. Now, it urges citizens to "have three, 
or more if you can afford it." 
</P>
<P>
One effect of the policy was the quick development of fertility research. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is because we were so successful at controlling the birth rate," 
Tsakok said. "Those who cannot have children cannot find any to adopt. We find 
it absolutely crucial to have the absolute best in reproductive technology." 
</P>
<P>
Infertility problems are becoming more common, possibly because of increasing 
social stresses, including the push for larger families, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
"Today in infertility, reproductive medicine, I think it would not be an 
exaggeration to say we are among the top in the world," said Prof. S. S. 
Ratnam, chief of National University Hospital's obstetrics and gynecology 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Singapore's stature as a center for infertility treatment has attracted 
interest from childless couples throughout Asia. 
</P>
<P>
After trying unsuccessfully for nine years to have a baby, the Rahmans, a young 
Bangladeshi couple, flew to Singapore for treatment, despite the $9,000 cost -- 
about the price of a new Japanese car there. 
</P>
<P>
"I had heard about Prof. Ratnam. He is quite famous in Bangladesh," said 
Rahman, a businessman. 
</P>
<P>
At about $1,950 to $2,800 a treatment, Singapore's IVF costs are among the 
lowest in the world -- in some cases, less than half the cost in the United 
States, Ratnam said. 
</P>
<P>
About a third of the obstetrics and gynecology patients at National University 
Hospital, or about 50 a month, are foreigners from nearby Malaysia and 
Indonesia. Some come from as far away as Africa and Britain, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said foreign interest increased after National delivered the world's first 
baby conceived by micro-injection of sperm into an egg last year. 
</P>
<P>
Techniques such as using an artificial womb constructed with inner-lining 
Fallopian cells help boost the chances for a successful pregnancy by allowing 
the embryo to develop before implanting it into the womb. 
</P>
<P>
Most embryos are implanted within 36 hours of fertilization, but with the 
artificial womb, the embryo can be kept alive for more than five days. 
</P>
<P>
But both Tsakok and Ratnam said that, even in the best case, only about a third 
of all infertility and IVF treatments result in a baby. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very stressful program," Ratnam said. "When they fail, all of them 
break down."

SRI LANKANS FLEE ONCE TRANQUIL PARADISE

RAMESWARAM, India 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Sri Lankans have fled to India, risking an uncertain 
future as refugees to escape the ethnic warfare that has made a hell of their 
tranquil paradise. 
</P>
<P>
"I sold everything I had to my neighbors for rock-bottom prices to raise the 
money for the boat trip," said Singaduthu, a 40-year-old fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
He clutched his two wailing daughters to his chest while their 4-year-old 
brother, Prem Kumar, looked around in confusion for the mother he would never 
see again. 
</P>
<P>
She was killed when the family was caught in a battle between Sri Lankan 
soldiers and Tamil Tiger guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost my wife in the cross-fire while waiting for the boat to escape to 
India," Singaduthu said. His voice choked. His daughters, 11-year-old 
Tilakavathi and 10-year-old Kala, cried for their mother. 
</P>
<P>
Singaduthu's family fled their home at Edukalampatti on Sri Lanka's 
northeastern coast and made their way westward to Mannar, a Sri Lankan island 
in the archipelago that stretches across the Palk Strait toward India. 
</P>
<P>
"The boat that was supposed to take us to Rameswaram was gone already," said 
Singaduthu, who like many Tamils uses only one name. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed to wait for one day, and we hid in the bushes to escape from the 
cross-fire. . . . My wife, Gnanavalli, was hit by a bullet and she died. How I 
wish all the five of us had met the same fate." 
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 Sri Lankan Tamils have fled to Tamil Nadu state in southern 
India since fighting between the Tamil Tigers and the Sinhalese-dominated 
government resumed in June. 
</P>
<P>
Naresh Gupta, Tamil Nadu's commissioner for Sri Lankan refugees, said up to 
1,300 arrived at Rameswaram port in a single day. Arulanandam Fernando of the 
Rameswaram Fishermen's Assn. said the daily figure was more like 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
Many, like Singaduthu, register at a dingy reception center and are taken in 
government buses to makeshift refugee centers in schools, warehouses and 
cyclone shelters. 
</P>
<P>
Rameswaram once was best known as a Hindu pilgrimage site. Before Sri Lanka's 
ethnic wars, ferries plied the 30 miles between Rameswaram and Talaimannar port 
on the bountiful island formerly called Ceylon. 
</P>
<P>
A flourishing, largely illicit bazaar sprang up at Rameswaram, 275 miles south 
of Madras. 
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan Tamils, coming to visit the huge temple of the Hindu god Shiva, 
brought electronic items and other choice goods that were hard to find or 
prohibitively expensive in India. In Rameswaram, the visitors stocked up on 
lungis, the bright plaid cotton sarongs worn by Tamil men on both sides of the 
strait. 
</P>
<P>
Ferry service halted in 1983 when Tamil separatists began fighting the 
Sinhalese majority in Sri Lanka, but the smuggling trade continued. Smugglers 
ferried goods, arms for the Tamil guerrillas and refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the briskest trade is in refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Malraja, a Sri Lankan boatman, charges the equivalent of $14.50 for space on 
his 20-foot fiberglass boat, which is fitted with an outboard motor for the 
trip from Pesalai on Mannar Island. 
</P>
<P>
Some passengers, like Anthony, a construction worker, have no money. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave Malraja the gold ear studs of my wife and one of the daughter's for the 
trip," he said. "I also gave him my old cycle." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony, his wife, Kadiramma, and their three daughters left after five of 
their neighbors in Pesalai were killed by an air force bombing raid on 
suspected Tiger hide-outs. 
</P>
<P>
"We would spend entire nights in bunkers infested with snakes," Kadiramma said. 
</P>
<P>
Many refugees were reluctant to criticize the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. 
The guerrillas seek a separate homeland for Tamils, who make up 18% of Sri 
Lanka's 16 million people, and more than 14,000 people have been killed in 
seven years of war. 
</P>
<P>
Anandaraja, a trader from the east coast town of Batticaloa, was willing to 
speak his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of us do not understand why the (Tigers are) fighting this war," he said.

SOME CALL ARMS INCINERATOR ATOLL HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
JOHNSTON ATOLL, Pacific Ocean 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every visitor to remote Johnston Atoll, a tiny low-lying coral island in the 
South Pacific, must prepare for chemical warfare. 
</P>
<P>
Every visitor is given a gas mask and carries a nerve gas antidote in a 
syringe, which he must be ready to use within seconds of an exposure alarm 
sounding. 
</P>
<P>
It is here, 720 miles southwest of Hawaii and in an otherwise idyllic Pacific 
setting of palm trees and coral islets, that the United States has built the 
world's largest chemical weapons destruction station. 
</P>
<P>
In the first-ever media tour to the remote atoll U.S. Army staff recently 
assured reporters that the operation is safe. 
</P>
<P>
So safe that 79 missiles with the lethal nerve agent Sarin were burned while 
the group of 80 reporters visited furnaces, each wearing on his belt a gas mask 
and syringe pouch. 
</P>
<P>
During one of the tours, a temperature fluctuation in one furnace chamber 
forced a plant shutdown for 44 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
It was one of the many nagging glitches which have kept the $340-million 
incinerator operating for only 24% of the time expected. 
</P>
<P>
Six times since trial burning began in June, contamination alarms have sounded 
throughout the facility, only to prove to be false readings. Some conveyor 
belts within the complex that carry non-lethal munitions parts have repeatedly 
broken down. 
</P>
<P>
"When the plant operates, it operates very well. However, we are seeing more 
problems than we had expected," Charles Baronian, technical director of the 
U.S. Army's chemical disposal program at Johnston, told a briefing. 
</P>
<P>
"Because the problems are mechanical, I would primarily characterize it as a 
design flaw, but not a basic flaw." 
</P>
<P>
Baronian stressed that the breakdowns do not endanger safety and mostly occur 
in conveyor belts and other transfer points. Shutdowns occur mainly because 
site managers take no chances. 
</P>
<P>
On the atoll are 54 storage bunkers, most brimming with missiles and mortars 
filled with chemical gas and liquid. 
</P>
<P>
Nerve agents such as Sarin, which are odorless and colorless, can seep through 
clothing and skin, restrict breathing, cause involuntary urination, convulsions 
and finally death. 
</P>
<P>
Mustard gas raises watery blisters hours after contact and inflames the nose 
and throat. 
</P>
<P>
All the atoll's 1,400 residents carry gas masks and walk around with a pouch 
containing a syringe filled with a nerve gas antidote that must be injected 
within seconds of an exposure. Masks must be fitted within nine seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the island, automated detectors take 29,000 readings daily from 106 
monitoring stations. They scan the air in workplaces and around the island, 
sounding an alarm when they detect the presence of nerve agent or blister gas. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a feeling that the possibility of death is only a malfunction away, 
life is still pleasant on Johnston. 
</P>
<P>
Palm trees and wire fences, softball fields and decontamination rooms, armed 
military police and a nine-hole golf course -- they are the contrasts of the 
atoll. 
</P>
<P>
The constant breeze through the palm trees and the beauty of the setting hide 
the fact that the atoll is not a resort. 
</P>
<P>
One section of Johnston Island, the largest in the atoll, is sealed off due to 
a large spill of Agent Orange. 
</P>
<P>
In another area, the failed launch of a nuclear missile left plutonium in the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
But this does not always bother its residents, who are mostly from the United 
States working under contracts of six months to one year. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a six-lane bowling alley, movies every night, and softball is really 
popular," said Curtis Rodgers, a civilian technician. "A lot of people fish out 
there. Scuba diving is excellent, and you can sail and water ski. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been living on the island two years and if I thought there was any danger 
I wouldn't be here."

NEW HAVEN POLICE CHIEF'S TACTICS DRAW FIRE, PRAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police Chief Nicholas Pastore is trading in his force of drug-busting, 
doughnut-eating militiamen for what he calls social engineers. 
</P>
<P>
The new chief has banned leather driving gloves on police officers as too 
intimidating and has told the members of his force to steer drug users to 
treatment programs instead of jails. 
</P>
<P>
He has also told his officers to knock off the frequent coffee-and-doughnut 
runs during their breaks because it gives them a bad image with the public. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the police to be perceived as a helping-hand agency," said Pastore, who 
has been on the job for seven months. 
</P>
<P>
That perception can be bolstered if officers, among other things, help drug 
users rather than just arrest them, the new chief said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried the tanks, the helicopters, the big guns for many years. It 
doesn't work," Pastore, 52, said in a recent interview. "I don't subscribe to 
the philosophy that the more arrests you make, it's going to solve the crime 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Arrests in New Haven, a city of 125,000 people, dropped sharply when Pastore 
discontinued sting operations to round up drug buyers. He has also stopped 
dispatching teams of officers into high-crime neighborhoods for round-the-clock 
arrests and disbanded the department's canine unit. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he ordered about 20 more officers to walk beats, placed officers at 
high-visibility posts throughout downtown and made extensive community outreach 
efforts to end what he calls the "we-they mentality" in drug-infested 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
He also walks the streets of crime-plagued neighborhoods himself, frequently 
striking up conversations with known drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
"When I'm seen in these neighborhoods, people realize this man cares," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His actions have brought praise from various members of the public and business 
community, but have put him at odds with the police department's union. 
</P>
<P>
A group of downtown merchants recently presented Pastore with a plaque for his 
efforts to increase police visibility. But Sgt. Louis G. Cavalier, the head of 
the police officers union, complained that the stepped-up presence has merely 
provided the community with a "false sense of security." 
</P>
<P>
Pastore has also won the confidence of at least one drug user's mother, who 
called him recently to say she needed to talk to someone she could trust. 
</P>
<P>
The chief believes marijuana use should be decriminalized, and he said his 
efforts to encourage addicts to seek treatment reflects his belief that the 
drug problem should be resolved by physicians, not lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Such views earned him a prominent profile in the August issue of "High Times," 
a magazine devoted to marijuana smoking. 
</P>
<P>
Pastore said he didn't know the free-lance writer who spoke with him was doing 
the interview for High Times. But he added that he was accurately quoted and 
had no problems with the story. 
</P>
<P>
His comments in a newspaper interview that there would be fewer 
coffee-and-doughnut runs now that he was police chief ruffled some feathers in 
the department. Union officials accuse him of frequently entering restaurants 
and asking officers what they are doing. 
</P>
<P>
"There is the sense that the chief is on their backs constantly," Cavalier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Pastore said he recalls only one such restaurant incident. He added that his 
doughnut policy is not an attack on his officers' work ethic but on the 
traditional concept of police work. 
</P>
<P>
"Police work should not be just doing what the dispatcher says, then in between 
going to Dunkin' Donuts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He praises his officers, but dismisses the union's criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"The union doesn't care about the public," he said. "All they care about is 
what's good for them. "They have become a group of militant mercenaries." 
</P>
<P>
Pastore came into office with a mandate to shake up the department and move to 
a concept of community-based policing, in which officers are assigned to 
individual neighborhoods. Because of a tight city budget, the new program has 
gotten off to a slow start. 
</P>
<P>
First-term Mayor John Daniels, a friend since high school, bypassed nearly 20 
internal candidates in hiring Pastore, who had spent 18 years with the 
department before retiring in 1981.

WAR COLLEGE STRATEGISTS PLAYING CATCH-UP IN YEAR OF POLITICAL UPHEAVALS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Behind a locked door posted "Top Secret" at the U.S. Naval War College, scores 
of men and women in uniform and civilian clothes hover over banks of brightly 
colored computer screens. They are playing military games in a make-believe 
world that is on the brink of disaster. 
</P>
<P>
As orders fly back and forth over radio-telephones, small images that represent 
the terrible machines and weapons of war -- missiles, ships, planes and 
submarines -- move about on the screens, stalking the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
Near the end, young men in crisp white uniforms hurry about gathering computer 
printouts, which they deposit in plastic baskets labeled "classified material." 
The shadows of others scurry across the huge map of the world that covers a far 
wall. A voice over a loudspeaker warns that the games are coming to a close. A 
sign on an opposite wall reads: "Loose Lips Sink Ships, Even in War Games." 
</P>
<P>
Now, for the first time since the 1950s, the adversary in these war games, 
played for more than 100 years at this military war college on Narragansett 
Bay, is not the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
With the end of the Cold War, the reunification of Germany and a friendship 
developing between the two superpowers, the Naval War College has scrambled 
this year to change its curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
Rear Adm. Joseph C. Strasser, president of the college, which was founded in 
1884, said that 90% of the curriculum for this year's class of senior officers 
was updated over the summer. Although study here is focused mainly on naval 
strategy and operations, the student warriors, all with rank equivalent to an 
Army major or higher, are in the Army, Air Force and Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
"An awful lot of what we did around here was geared to the Soviet threat and 
how the Navy would operate in a potential global war," said Strasser, a 
mast-straight, 50-year-old career officer with a doctoral degree in philosophy 
of political science. "The Cold War is over now, and an extraordinary amount of 
the curriculum had to be changed to reflect that." 
</P>
<P>
Strasser and his staff said that many of the changes reflect current doubt that 
a full-scale nuclear war will break out between the United States and the 
Soviet Union. This year, the college is emphasizing conventional wars outside 
the European Continent. Other new courses deal with military involvement in 
civilian drug-law enforcement and with combating terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
In the history of the college, the only comparable periods of sweeping 
curriculum change occurred in the early part of this century, with the advent 
of military aircraft, and in the early 1950s, with the emergence of two 
superpowers with nuclear weapons enough to destroy the world. 
</P>
<P>
Navy Capt. Raymond Alcorn, a recent graduate of the school who is now dean of 
students, said he was shocked to see the sudden political upheavals in the 
world last year -- particularly the destruction of the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
"When I went through the course last year it was frustrating," said the lean, 
intense veteran aviator who was a prisoner of war in Hanoi for almost eight 
years of the Vietnam War. "We were talking about things in class that no longer 
even existed." 
</P>
<P>
War games at the college are only a small part of its curriculum of strategy, 
national security decision-making and operations, but the games play a major 
role in the school's mission. In many respects, they are the final exam. 
</P>
<P>
Strasser said that in last summer's global war game, top war planners from the 
three military services and a host of federal agencies, including the CIA, 
Department of Defense and U.S. Space Command, were confronted with three New 
World scenarios. (Students do not participate in the three-week summer war 
game, although they do play games of their own.) 
</P>
<P>
"We called these three worlds 'the good,' 'the bad' and 'the ugly,' " said 
Strasser, who assumed command of the war college last spring. 
</P>
<P>
In the world called "ugly," the Soviet Union was breaking apart and 
international relations were dominated by new and volatile ideological 
alliances. Arabs rallied to make trouble in the Middle East; old feuds were 
rekindled in Eastern Europe; China reverted to hard-line authoritarianism. 
Violence erupted in Third World nations because of hunger and despair, and a 
wave of terrorism was spawned by Latin American drug cartels. 
</P>
<P>
In the "good" world, economics and trade dominated international politics. The 
"bad" world was torn apart by violent winds of nationalism as peacekeeping 
influences such as NATO and the United Nations lost their authority. 
</P>
<P>
"The lessons we learned were incorporated into the curriculum as well as sent 
to Washington," said Strasser. He added that the Pentagon has always considered 
the college's war games important. 
</P>
<P>
Strasser said that war in the Middle East was identified as a crisis in all 
three of the model worlds, but, he added that "it would be inaccurate to say we 
predicted the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. It was just a possibility that was 
discussed." 
</P>
<P>
Navy Capt. John H. Heidt, director of the school's War Gaming Department, said 
that the end of the Cold War era does not mean the games are less important. 
</P>
<P>
"The world is even more dangerous now that the major balance of power is gone. 
A new world order has emerged, and each nation now has very competing 
interests," he said.

Heidt said that the major change in the war games is that now, more emphasis is 
placed on political, economic and historical considerations -- not to mention 
military budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Although Operation Desert Shield, the name given to the U.S. troop deployment 
in Saudi Arabia, comes up often in class discussions, Heidt said that it is not 
an integral part of the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not involved in teaching current events," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Begun in 1887, the Naval War College games are considered the most 
sophisticated of the military's three major war colleges, which include the 
U.S. Army War College in Carlisle, Pa., and the U.S. Air University in 
Montgomery, Ala. The curricula at those schools also have been changed to 
reflect recent events. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the finest gaming facility in the world, primarily because we have the 
tradition," said Robert Wood, dean of the Center for Naval Warfare Studies. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport school is the oldest institution of its kind in the world and has 
taught many of the men and women who became the highest-ranking officers in 
U.S. naval history. 
</P>
<P>
Wood and others point proudly to a letter from Adm. Chester W. Nimitz, 
commander-in-chief of the Pacific forces in World War II and a 1923 Naval War 
College graduate. It reads in part: 
</P>
<P>
"The war with Japan had been re-enacted in the game rooms at the Naval War 
College by so many people, and in so many ways, that nothing that happened 
during the war was a surprise . . . absolutely nothing except the kamikaze 
tactics toward the end of the war; we had not visualized these."

THEY CAME FROM NEAR AND FAR TO MOURN THE PASSING OF A MOST UNCOMMON MAN

He was no mover or shaker. He never held public office and didn't have a lot of 
money. But 400 people made their way to the deep woods of central Louisiana to 
attend the wake of the man they all knew as Mr. Hugh. 
</P>
<P>
They came to pay their respects to Hugh McDaniel, vegetable farmer and story 
teller, who died at age 73. 
</P>
<P>
News of the wake had been broadcast throughout the day on KVPI Radio in Ville 
Platte, in both French and English since this part of the country represents 
the marriage bed of the Catholic-Cajun and Protestant cultures. 
</P>
<P>
Illiterates mingled with university professors. Welfare recipients chatted 
easily with a couple of oil millionaires. All had been charmed by Hugh 
McDaniel, farmer and storyteller. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Goodman, for example. He doesn't own a car. He hitched a ride. 
</P>
<P>
And William Leece, owner of an oil field service company, a business in a 
frenzy due to the crisis in Iraq. He locked his office for the day to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Maude King came. She lives so far back in the woods that even in the 1960s some 
residents didn't have electricity. 
</P>
<P>
The wake lasted 24 hours, with the kitchen of the Friendship Baptist Church 
working around the clock concocting steamy gumbo, coffee thick enough to float 
a spoon and enough deserts to make a fat man weep. 
</P>
<P>
Plates of Cajun sausage -- boudin -- were complemented by the Protestants' 
traditional chicken and dumplings. 
</P>
<P>
As a drizzling rain fell constantly this autumn day, inside the church one pew 
was filled with the Naquin family, cousins of McDaniel, who conversed and 
prayed in French. 
</P>
<P>
A cousin from another branch of the family leaned over the pew to speak to the 
Naquins. "How're y'all," he drawled. 
</P>
<P>
Many sat all night in the church. 
</P>
<P>
The later services were conducted by four ministers, including two Baptists, a 
Church of Christ lay preacher and a Catholic priest. Organized religion is 
casual here. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh McDaniel symbolized that casualness. The son of a French-speaking, 
Catholic mother, he went to the Baptist church as a youngster simply because 
that church was closest to the farm. Those were the days of mud roads and few 
autos. And time away from the farm could mean a lost crop and a bare cupboard. 
</P>
<P>
And typical of the 1920s, he spoke mostly French until he went to school, where 
teachers whipped those who didn't speak English. Such attitudes nearly killed 
the Cajun culture, which was revived in the 1960s. Now, French is taught in 
elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh McDaniel was not typical in other ways, this man who grew vegetables and 
fruit on a few acres along Dun Beef Creek just north of Pine Prairie. 
</P>
<P>
He was the kind of man that most of us, as youngsters, want to emulate, but 
wind up in middle-age realizing with some self-pity that we never made it. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Hugh gloried in his God, his family, his fellow man and the soil -- in that 
order. 
</P>
<P>
People were naturally drawn to the warmth of a man who never met a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
Over decades, word-of-mouth sent the message through several parishes. There 
was a man in the woods growing anything that could sprout. They came to buy. 
Discovering that he was a storyteller, customers sat under the pecan trees and 
listened. They left as friends. 
</P>
<P>
He made the headlines of a local newspaper when he grafted a domestic peach 
tree with a wild tree, developing a new strain of the fruit. 
</P>
<P>
County agents and agriculture professors from the University of Southwestern 
Louisiana heard of his delicious peaches. They listened to accounts of how he 
grew crops that couldn't be sustained in that part of the country where the 
frost came early. 
</P>
<P>
The experts traveled to the farm to see for themselves, to see if he could grow 
satsuma oranges this far north. Could he really grow kiwis? That couldn't be 
done in this climate. Surely, he couldn't produce Vidalia onions, which were 
grown successfully only in a few Georgia counties. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, but he did all that. The professors also sat under the trees, sipping iced 
tea and listening to Mr. Hugh's stories. 
</P>
<P>
He had little desire for material possessions but dutifully worked the oil 
fields at times for the money that would give his four children the benefit of 
college educations. 
</P>
<P>
The farming wouldn't sustain those expenses because Mr. Hugh wouldn't charge 
enough. On top of that, he gave away as much as he sold, traveling the roads 
with food for the sick and the jobless. 
</P>
<P>
The millionaire Leece met the farmer in the oil fields, totally disarmed by a 
grimy, oil-spattered employee who treated the owner like a fellow employee, 
wanting to chat during breaks. 
</P>
<P>
Leece found that he missed those chats and was drawn to the farm once Mr. 
Hugh's college funding duties were over. 
</P>
<P>
With time on his hands, Mr. Hugh contributed columns to the Ville Platte 
Gazette, sometimes featuring Jean Pierre with a Cajun dialect. A simple man's 
view of the world, a bit of local history, a humorous account of a personal 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
So, he is gone, taking with him the well-chronicled stories of his wonder dogs, 
Revlon and Rich. We'll hear no more of friend, Calabas, or jokes about the "ol' 
woman," his cherished wife, Eudole, now 70. Spring won't bring another column 
of God's grace at planting time. 
</P>
<P>
But, not to mourn. Mr. Hugh would be the first to say that mankind is like the 
soil in a way, sprouting other storytellers. Maybe they are out there now. 
Maybe his columns have inspired other simple folk to take up the pen.

CARACAS WEIGHS USING PETRODOLLARS TO RETIRE DEBT, IMPROVE SOCIAL PROGRAMS;

VENEZUELA: THE GULF CRISIS BRINGS A WINDFALL TO NATION BESET BY AUSTERITY 
MEASURES AND UNEMPLOYMENT.

<TEXT>
<P>
As the world struggles to resolve the gulf crisis, Venezuela's big new problem 
is what to do with a windfall of petrodollars. 
</P>
<P>
And Venezuelans are debating what to do with the money -- whether to pay off 
their debt or invest in social programs to ease the heavy burden of the 
country's austerity measures. 
</P>
<P>
Venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the Western world. Within 
three weeks of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, oil platforms in Lake Maracaibo were 
pumping 350,000 more barrels a day. By year's end, output will rise to 500,000 
barrels a day above the country's previous quota of 1.9 million barrels a day, 
as set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. 
</P>
<P>
"We will gain an extra $1.2 billion to $2.4 billion in oil revenues this year," 
said Celestino Armas, Venezuela's oil minister. Venezuela stands to gain $1 
billion a year for every $1 a barrel rise in wholesale prices, say officials of 
Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the state-run oil company. 
</P>
<P>
This privileged situation has raised the expectations of the average 
Venezuelan, whose pocketbook has been hit by government austerity measures and 
unemployment. Last year, Venezuela's economy shrank 8%, overall unemployment 
reached 10%, and inflation was cut to 30% from 85% a year ago, the Ministry of 
Finance said. Union leaders say 500,000 people have lost jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, the standoff in the gulf is a blessing," said Pedro Ibarra, a Caracas 
shoe store owner. "The question we are all asking ourselves is: What is the 
government going to do with the oil bonus?" 
</P>
<P>
The government is "debating what to do with the extra funds," said Marcos 
Morales, who leads an economic policy team. "We don't want to count our eggs 
before they hatch. We remain cautious. You never know what the price of oil 
will be tomorrow." Morales, however, thinks the windfall will wipe out the $1 
billion 1990 budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
In street markets, government offices and newspapers, three options are talked 
about: paying off debt to stabilize the economy; reinvesting in the state-run 
oil company to expand oil production; or investing in social programs to ease 
the burden of austerity. Advocates of paying off Venezuela's foreign debt 
include businessmen and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
"The debt is the heaviest burden we have ever suffered in our history," said 
Sen. Pedro Paris Montesinos. In mid-August, private banks cut Venezuela's 
foreign debt by 20% to $18 billion, and debt payments were cut by 50%. In 
return, the government will continue austerity rules that help it pay. Still, 
Venezuela faces annual payments of up to $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"The gulf crisis is a bonanza," said businessman Jose Marquez. "But in the long 
haul, paying off the debt will guarantee that, no matter what happens to the 
price of the barrel, our economy will be at last stabilized." 
</P>
<P>
Others believe improving the state-run oil company is as important as fixing 
the economy. "We have a very ambitious plan," said PDVSA's Paul Reimpell. "We 
are going to operate at full capacity in the coming year and beyond." 
</P>
<P>
From the wellhead to the gas pump, improvement efforts are under way, oil 
company officials say. But money is needed to reactivate 13,000 idle wells to 
meet demand. About 80% of company earnings goes to the government, with 20% 
reinvested, Reimpell said. Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez has said 
some oil bonus money may be used to expand production, some of it for a 
rainy-day fund. 
</P>
<P>
Critics, however, say Perez wants to overexpand production to satisfy Third 
World countries and boost his image as a spokesman for the developing world -- 
a role he played as president in the 1970s. Under a 10-year deal between 
Venezuela, Mexico and others, Venezuela has been selling oil at $17 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
But some at home wonder why Perez does not solve their many problems. "We 
demand water, electricity, a better health system, and an end to the rise in 
prices," said Marcos Fiel Loaiza, a social activist. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Perez's new austerity measures sparked riots that killed 300 and 
injured 1,000. The Perez free-market plan abolished price controls, reduced 
government subsidies, freed exchange rates and moved to privatize state-run 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered street protests have erupted over plans to raise gas prices from 26 
to 28 cents a gallon. In slums in the city, water shortages have led to 
demonstrations. Simmering discontent was evident in a recent poll. Sixty-five 
percent of 1,500 respondents thought the economy would worsen, and 53% 
disapproved of Perez's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same old story," said Fiel Loaiza. "We live in a country rich in oil 
and natural resources and somehow the benefits of our national wealth never 
trickled down to the people."

ALICE KAHN: HARD TIMES HAVE THEIR GOOD POINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICE KAHN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't you dare tell me that the good times are over. And especially, don't you 
dare do it in the form of a commercial that says if I buy an Oldsmobile I can 
still have fun. 
</P>
<P>
Every day, the news is full of gloom and doom. Didn't we learn anything from 
the '80s? Didn't we learn one of life's most important lessons: Money does not 
buy happiness. Say it again: Money does not buy happiness. It just buys stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Are you happier now than you were 10 years ago? Not "better off" -- I mean 
smiling, relaxed, physically joyous. What was so great about the '80s? So you 
got a VCR and a phone machine. Hey, I know how hard it is to give up the 
necessities. 
</P>
<P>
Let's put it another way. A recession means you won't be able to get a 
dual-deck VCR and phone machine that prioritizes your calls. Where is the 
tragedy? 
</P>
<P>
Before you think I'm playin' Pollyanna on the piano, I'll grant you this -- 
unemployment is one of the most painful things to face. But there is a certain 
cause for optimism in the demographics. The last massive phase of unemployment 
came when the baby boomer bulge was poking its fat mass into the job market. 
Now we are facing the baby bust. 
</P>
<P>
There will be jobs. It's just that everyone won't be able to be what was known 
in the '80s as a "player." We all know how happy those people appeared, 
standing there on the floor of the stock market screaming, "Sell!" 
</P>
<P>
So, put a smile on your face, put your Armani suit in the closet and start 
practicing "How can I help you? . . . Would you like fries with that?. . .Have 
you tried the McPizza?" 
</P>
<P>
Better yet, learn to say it in Russian. 
</P>
<P>
A downturn in the economy means you will not have to keep striving to get more, 
more, more. The Joneses are in trouble too, so you won't have to keep up with 
them. No more, "But honey, even the Lenins have a Mercedes." The feeling that 
enough was never enough will be replaced with: Let's just hold on to what we've 
got. 
</P>
<P>
Bearish times shouldn't leave you growling. It just means putting the quest for 
status on hold. Anyone who's ever been there knows that a status high lasts 
about three minutes anyway -- the time between getting a job and realizing that 
you will have to do the work. 
</P>
<P>
So, come on, Bucky (or No-Bucky), look on the bright side. Recession -- not 
what's in it for me, but how can I make it through? 
</P>
<P>
We'll have to find other things to do besides going shopping. This means 
freeing up hours that were previously spent driving in traffic jams, looking 
for parking places, searching through schlock, dealing with the incompetent 
clerk, getting the thing home and discovering that even if it does work, you 
can't work it. 
</P>
<P>
What will you do instead? You can still work out without health clubs, Air 
Jordans and personal trainers. You can get around without a 15-speed mountain 
bike. Remember, you're in no hurry; you're not going anywhere. You can still 
walk, jog or lie on the floor and work those thighs without spending a dime. 
Left, right, left . . . You don't need a Jane Fonda to tell you which way the 
thigh goes. 
</P>
<P>
And, need I remind you, this and falling in love is still cheaper than buying 
an Olds? And you don't need $1.59 a gallon to ride. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, here's the best news. Anger will be back in. The anger that everyone 
was supposed to get rid of in the '80s can suddenly become our greatest form of 
entertainment. We can get angry at the politicians who created the economic 
mess, we can hate the rich, we can go after the market manipulators. 
</P>
<P>
And we can enjoy watching Donald Trump lose more than we'd ever make. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't that almost worth it? So find yourself a sweetie, learn to bake bread, be 
nice to the man in the street and hang on. 
</P>
<P>
The economy will rise again. In the mean time, ain't we got fun?

ERMA BOMBECK: SILENCE IS NOT NECESSARILY GOLDEN

Men who walk around like they have a mouthful of Novocain have always been 
admired and respected for it. The moody, silent type is the goal of every woman 
who lusts . . . for Brando or Bronson, for Eastwood or Redford. All these sex 
symbols have to do is to sit there and stare, and imagination writes the 
dialogue for them. 
</P>
<P>
On the screen, it's great. In real life, it's the pits. A man who does not talk 
eventually can drive you crazy. Talking with some husbands and fathers is like 
an evening of sound bites. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you want for dinner?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care." 
</P>
<P>
"I want you to speak to your son." 
</P>
<P>
"What about?" 
</P>
<P>
"Talk to me." 
</P>
<P>
"What do you want me to say?" 
</P>
<P>
"Do you love me?" 
</P>
<P>
"What a question." 
</P>
<P>
I think men have romanticized this image for so long, they're beginning to 
believe that silence presents them as mysterious and deep. They don't answer 
phones. They don't waste breath talking to recordings. They don't gossip. They 
never hear rumors. In fact, they never know anything until it is on the 6 
o'clock news. 
</P>
<P>
If I was that quiet, my husband would put a mirror near my lips to make sure I 
was breathing. 
</P>
<P>
The basic difference between the social interaction of the sexes can best be 
described by a phone call that comes into your home. If it's for your husband, 
he will respond, "Yeah? No kidding! That's astounding. I don't believe it! Have 
you told anyone else? You've got to hang tough. Talk to you later." 
</P>
<P>
When you ask, "Who was that?" he says, "Nobody." When you ask, "What happened 
to nobody?" he replies, "Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
I can go into a roadside restroom for five minutes and come out with 200 miles 
of nonstop conversation about it. I know who was in there, what they said about 
road conditions, restaurants, their kids, their gas mileage and their financial 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
In a world where communication is state of the art, I worry about the silent 
types. However, the other day I heard a voice and realized my husband was 
talking to himself. 
</P>
<P>
What a waste. He should have confided in someone who listens.

L.A. ISRAELIS ARE IGNORED NO LONGER; 
</P>
<P>
EMIGRES: THE JEWISH COMMUNITY ANNOUNCES A GRANT TO HELP THEM ASSIMILATE. AND 
EVEN THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT CHANGES ITS TUNE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Reaching out to local Israelis after decades of neglect, Jewish community 
officials Thursday announced a $180,000 grant intended to help bring the 
immigrants into the larger Jewish community of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government once frowned on this sort of thing, hoping that emigres 
would feel like strangers in a strange land and decide to return to the Jewish 
state, said Consul General Ran Ronen. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin once raised a storm of protest by 
referring to the emigres -- known in Hebrew as yordim, meaning those who 
descend -- as "the weakest of the weak." 
</P>
<P>
But times have changed. With the number of Israelis living on the Westside and 
in the San Fernando Valley estimated at anywhere from 75,000 to 150,000 out of 
a total Jewish population of 600,000 to 700,000, "We can't afford to lose 
them," Ronen said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't take care of them, we will lose their children as Israelis and 
Jews in one generation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Funded by the Jewish Community Foundation, the three-year grant will allow the 
Jewish Community Centers Assn. to provide special programs for Israelis, 
including summer camps, teen evenings, singles dances, student clubs, an 
information hot line, holiday celebrations and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
"At this moment, we have a unique opportunity to offer a convincing alternative 
to assimilation and dissolution within an important segment of our Los Angeles 
Jewish community," said Martin S. Appel, president of the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation is a charitable arm of the Jewish Federation Council, an 
umbrella organization made up of most of the Jewish organizations in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Although some Israelis are already involved in B'nai B'rith and other groups, 
this is the first coordinated effort to bridge the gap between the established 
Jewish community and the Israeli immigrants, said Elaine Albert, a staffer with 
the Federation's Council on Jewish Life. 
</P>
<P>
While immigrants from unfriendly environments such as Iran and the Soviet Union 
tend to fit in quickly because they have no intentions of returning, Albert 
said, many Israelis come to the United States with plans to go back someday. 
</P>
<P>
"But most of them stay, and there's a growing recognition that as the years 
pass, their children are not Israelis, which is hard to accept for some, and 
there's a growing realization of 'Where do we go from here?' " 
</P>
<P>
"It is their children that are the problem," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, with Israel's economy in trouble and housing at a premium because of 
the flood of Soviet immigrants, it would be hard to make a case for Israelis 
who are doing well in America to return home now, Ronen said. 
</P>
<P>
"First, we must keep them as Jews and Israelis, and if we improve the economy 
of Israel, maybe then we can get them back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To some Los Angeles Israelis, the new outreach effort is no less welcome for 
being overdue. 
</P>
<P>
"Ignoring the fact that we were here didn't do any good for anybody," said Dr. 
Victor Gura, who immigrated 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Morrie Avidan, a businessman who came to the United States in 1972, said that 
in addition to their numbers and potential charitable contributions, Israelis 
could make other useful additions. 
</P>
<P>
"We come from a mentality that is a majority in the country, not a minority," 
he said. "Israelis are more aggressive, more open, more believing in 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"They say, 'I want to live where I want to live, but I don't want to sever my 
ties to Israel. Israel is like my mother and I can never cut that tie. This 
country is like my wife. I can only divorce her, but I love her too."' 
</P>
<P>
Other federation projects aimed at Los Angeles Israelis include a recently 
launched after-school program to teach religious subjects and Hebrew literacy 
to the children of immigrants, many of whom can only speak the language.

SHE HELPS SOVIET EMIGRES SAY NYET TO OVEREATING 
</P>

<P>
On a recent trip to a local Alpha Beta, 66-year-old Klara Leviant surveyed the 
dairy section with surprise. "You mean you can buy cottagecheese?" she marveled 
in her native Russian. "I've always made it!" 
</P>
<P>
Leviant, who moved to the United States from the Ukraine about five months ago 
and now lives in West Hollywood, was one of several Soviet women taking a tour 
of the supermarket under the direction of Klava Cousin, a West Hollywood 
registered dietitian. It was a field trip of sorts, offered as part of the 
weekly nutrition classes that Cousin, herself a native of Moscow, conducts 
exclusively for Soviet Jewish emigres. 
</P>
<P>
During the hour, Cousin, 34, led her charges up and down the aisles, showing 
them how to interpret product labels that can be confusing even to consumers 
with an excellent command of English, and making recommendations for low-fat 
and low-cholesterol foods. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Leviant told Cousin that the market was "like a jungle." She had 
never seen so much food in her entire life, she added -- not even during 28 
years working as a secretary to a Ukrainian inspector of foods and other 
products. 
</P>
<P>
The excursion served to illustrate the twofold need that prompted Cousin to 
begin her classes several years ago. As a dietitian and native speaker of 
Russian, she was uniquely qualified to impart nutritional counsel to fellow 
Soviets, most of whom were referred by physicians because of such problems as 
obesity, hypertension and diabetes. Second, she could use the classes to 
provide an informal education about the American lifestyle, and to help the new 
immigrants adjust to their new land. 
</P>
<P>
She draws her student-clients from the estimated 60,000 Soviet Jews who now 
make the Los Angeles area their home, with the largest concentrations found in 
Hollywood and West Hollywood. About 3,500 have arrived in the last two years, 
and 2,000 more are expected in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"Food isn't just eating -- it's the culture," Cousin said. "It's how you adapt. 
If you don't know what something is, you don't touch it. The supermarket tour, 
for instance, goes beyond food -- after they take it, there's more 
understanding, they start speaking English more." 
</P>
<P>
Cousin, who came to the United States in 1975, married Los Angeles Philharmonic 
bass player Jack Cousin five years later and worked as an exercise instructor, 
hairdresser and cosmetologist before earning her degree in nutrition in 1985 
from Cal State Los Angeles. At the Wednesday afternoon classes for the Soviet 
emigres, she draws on her own experiences. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me so long before I started to work toward my degree because I had no 
guidance, no one to tell me what to do," she recalled. "I had misconceptions 
about college -- people said it was too much money. So now I tell my clients: 
Don't wait, go to college or take other courses, learn. Don't stay home with a 
Russian paper or radio. Go out, have activities, go to the senior citizens 
center. Integrate." 
</P>
<P>
In one recent class, conducted in a mixture of English and Russian, Cousin 
focused on the cereal food group. Another class concentrated on meats. She 
showed her students how to weigh and measure, cautioned them against misleading 
television commercials, and dispelled misconceptions, such as one woman's 
belief that bathing twice daily would eliminate excess pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Several clients have a common reason for attending: an almost immediate weight 
gain upon arriving from a country where food staples are hard to come by. "When 
I first came here, I gained 10 pounds because there were so many foods here, 
and I said, 'I'd like this and this and this.' When I'd go to the supermarket, 
I'd take everything," recalled Marina Palov, 32, a now-svelte child 
psychologist from Leningrad who moved to Hollywood six months ago with her 
husband and daughter. Chemical engineer Adele Gordon, 65, joined the class 
because of her hypertension, but she experienced a similar weight gain when she 
left Moscow two years ago to live with her married son and his family in Los 
Angeles. "It was a very, very bad time in Moscow -- there was no meat, cheese 
or sausage, and I'd stay in line for two hours for what food there was. I was 
amazed at the variety of foods here." Her favorites? "Cereal with milk, turkey 
breast and ice cream." 
</P>
<P>
Cousin takes into account food's strong psychological connotations when 
deciding upon each client's diet. Of Palov, for instance, she said, "I wouldn't 
put her on a liquid diet -- she was deprived enough in Leningrad." But she 
allowed 25-year-old Eren Ryaboy to take a medically supervised liquid 
supplement. Ryaboy, who has a word processing job in Los Angeles, endured 
classmates' teasing and other feelings of displacement when she first moved to 
the United States from Kiev as an 11-year-old. She has since become an American 
citizen and considers herself thoroughly adjusted to this country's big-city 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Ryaboy, like most of her more recently arrived classmates, socializes 
mainly with fellow Soviets. "My husband and I are still connected to the Old 
Country," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's unfair to say this," she observed, "but the ones who came here a 
long time ago, we feel we are on a higher level than the people who have just 
come -- we have houses and careers. The new ones look at us like we're total 
jerks -- they think it's harder for them to adjust than it was for us, but it 
isn't. They think that money in America falls from the sky, that we didn't have 
to work hard for it. Even within families, people don't understand each other 
about this." 
</P>
<P>
An informal poll among the class as to the highs and lows of life in Los 
Angeles, Soviet-style, revealed a consensus: Like most Angelenos, they all 
dislike the smog and crime, but they love the temperate climate and the lack of 
discrimination against Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Even those recently arrived have lost no time picking up some American habits. 
Luba Popok, fresh from the Ukraine and attending her first nutrition class, had 
earlier shyly declined an interview because, she said, she did not speak 
English. But when a question about the best thing about L.A. was directed to 
the room at large -- in English -- Popok was the first to reply -- also in 
English: 
</P>
<P>
"Television," she said.

A HIP OPERA; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: THE L.A. MUSIC CENTER OPERA CREATED 'A MUSKRAT LULLABY' PROJECT FOR 
AREA GRADE SCHOOLS. STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ARE SINGING ITS PRAISES. 
</P>

<P>
Opera, generally thought of as the entertainment of the evening gown and tuxedo 
set, is coming to the Bart Simpson and L.A. Gear set. 
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of professionals from the Los Angeles Music Center Opera, 
grade-school students throughout the county are learning to slither like 
alligators, play the drums on trash-can contraptions and sing heartily in the 
chorus of a children's opera. 
</P>
<P>
After five weeks of training, they will unveil the opera, "A Muskrat Lullaby," 
on their school stage, sharing the spotlight with professional singers. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent dress rehearsal at Grand View Boulevard School in Mar Vista, the 
children, who play alligators and muskrats, went through the score and blocking 
-- their movements on stage -- in preparation for that afternoon's performance. 
Location director Paul King ordered the gators to stay low to the ground and 
act less polite and more "snarly." 
</P>
<P>
The opera involves about 120 youngsters in the fourth through sixth grades. 
Several of the children had seen Mozart's "The Magic Flute" or Oliver Knussen 
and Maurice Sendak's "Where the Wild Things Are" on field trips last year. 
</P>
<P>
But before the "Muskrat Lullaby" project, most had no idea what opera was. And 
if they did have an opinion about opera, teacher Brenda Richards said, it was 
that it was weird or boring. 
</P>
<P>
" 'You hear all these notes, and you don't know what they're saying,' " 
Richards recalled her fourth-graders saying. 
</P>
<P>
"Even for adults," added director King, the stereotype is that opera is "a 
bunch of fat ladies on stage singing." The opera company's school program, he 
said, aims to leave children with "their first memory of opera (as) something 
they participated in." 
</P>
<P>
With the L.A. Music Center Opera team, a school production is not a casual 
undertaking. They conduct workshops in which the children sing musical scales, 
learn creative dramatics and acquire a basic music vocabulary. Such people as 
Llewellyn Crain, manager of the opera's education and community programs, and 
opera docents explain opera and teach lines and cues. Composer and librettist 
Edward Barnes and percussionist John Fitzgerald lead rehearsals and talk about 
their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty hard to learn how to breathe in the first lesson," said muskrat 
Hailey Singh -- that is, inhale through the nose, exhale from the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
She and other students said they had been teased by some classmates about being 
in the opera and wearing handmade animal masks. "They think it's for wimps, 
they think it's dumb, because you're singing," Hailey said. 
</P>
<P>
But opera has caught on, teachers said. At recess, "(students will) sing, 'Will 
you throw the ball to me?' " Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of the children play in a percussion band on instruments they built 
themselves under Fitzgerald's guidance. Among the instruments are a drum made 
of three aluminum cans hanging inside a box, a "zipper guitar" made of a dowel 
and a metal spring strung between a garbage can and a coffee can, and glass 
canning jars filled with water and played with pencils with new erasers. 
</P>
<P>
They are "junk instruments -- easily made, easily repaired," Fitzgerald said. 
They were all built in less than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Playing them, however, took some practice, the youngsters said. "You have to 
keep track, look at the teacher, (and know) your instrument," said aluminum can 
drummer Jason Clouse, 9. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the unusual instruments, "Muskrat Lullaby" has elements of 
Charleston, salsa, rock 'n' roll and rap. "The style is . . . accessible and 
entertaining," said Crain, "more like Sondheim than like Puccini." 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted kids to feel it was real hip, real cool," she said. 
</P>
<P>
No matter that the children don't exactly achieve bel canto. "We don't care how 
good they sound," Crain said. "Most important to us is that they understand 
this process" of creating an opera and they are coaxed "out of their shells or 
their everyday world." 
</P>
<P>
So it helps that "Muskrat Lullaby," which is based on the book "Mama Don't 
Allow" by Thacher Hurd, is set in a swamp. The plot is simple: A singing group 
consisting of Miles the Muskrat and three other animals (played by members of 
L.A. Opera's resident company) goes to the swamp to practice. They are nearly 
eaten by a gang of alligators, but they sing themselves to safety by crooning a 
lullaby and putting the 'gators to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
There's a moral, of course: "The singing group uses music and cooperation to 
get themselves out of this predicament," Crain said. 
</P>
<P>
The student performers say they've been learning that along the way. 
Fourth-grader and alligator Claudia Marroquin said she liked working with her 
classmates, but she added that it's difficult at times because "some people 
don't listen, and they screw it up." 
</P>
<P>
The "Muskrat Lullaby" program, started in March, is the brainchild of general 
director Peter Hemmings, who ran a similar project when he led Scottish Opera. 
The program is financed by government agencies and private foundations and 
costs about $2,300 per school, with the school chipping in $800. By the end of 
this month, "Muskrat Lullaby" will have traveled to 29 schools in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The opera company is so pleased with the way the program has gone that it is 
developing a similar program for junior high and high schools, Crain said. 
</P>
<P>
On performance day at Grand View, 11 people from the opera company took part, 
including the singers and technical crew. They brought costumes, a few props, 
conga drums, slide whistles and other instruments. The big star, from the 
children's standpoint, was bass-baritone Richard Bernstein, who played the role 
of the alligator boss, dressed in top hat, black coattails with green jewels 
and metallic green pants. 
</P>
<P>
The student alligators and muskrats seemed dazzled by the show even as they 
were in it. Accompanying composer Barnes on keyboards and Fitzgerald on drums, 
the sounds of the children's percussion band -- the boing of the spring, thunk 
of the garbage can, ticktock of the aluminum cans and plock of the canning jar 
tops -- were amazingly melodic. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes said he was delighted at the way the youngsters shed their shyness as 
the 20-minute performance progressed. "They learn the value of being a ham on 
stage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The audience of about 200 students first whooped and giggled but were soon 
entranced. The alligators popped up out of character occasionally and the band 
missed a few beats, but they were given a chorus of bravos. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fun," said a breathless Laura Farahat, 9, who dressed for her part in 
apple-green turtleneck and stretch pants. 
</P>
<P>
The performance is over now, but it's not the finale of "Lullaby" yet. Waiting 
back in the classroom, said Richards and other teachers, are science 
experiments on the sounds of liquid-filled jars, assignments to write reports 
on muskrats and other animals -- and tapes of Puccini.

We didn't feel like going to work the other day. But we had a good excuse. 
"We're dead," we told our boss over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
"OK," she said. "Feel better." 
</P>
<P>
Being dead had other advantages. As a ghost, no one could see us. This raised 
some pretty lurid possibilities, the kind you have when you're young and 
sitting around with your friends and one of them asks what you would do if you 
suddenly woke up one morning and discovered you had X-ray eyes. "I would go 
into the girls' bathroom at school," Jake the Face would always say, a little 
too excitedly. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, we found other ways to enjoy being invisible. Like speeding on the 
freeway without the CHP officer seeing us, and going to work to sit on our 
boss's desk making faces, and helping ourselves immensely in the cookie aisle 
at the local supermarket. Or walking into the movie theater for free -- utterly 
naked. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, we got bored. We began to feel guilty. If we really did die, we 
couldn't live with the thought that our epitaph didn't match our deeds. They 
would have to write: "Rest Not in Peace -- You Disgusting Cheat, Sneak and 
Liar." No, no. Not for us. It's like something out of "Spoon River Anthology," 
Edgar Lee Masters' collection of verse that the Poetriad will perform tonight 
at 8 at the Westchester Elks Lodge, 8025 W. Manchester Ave., Playa del Rey. 
Admission is free. Reservations are required. Call (213) 301-9300. 
</P>
<P>
So we came back to the land of the living, and made a point never to speed 
again or walk around naked in inappropriate places. And we paid for the cookies 
and movie, and left some flowers on our boss's desk, and reminded ourself to 
get down to the Santa Monica Library at 11:15 a.m. Friday to have author Ray 
Bradbury sign a copy of his latest book, "A Graveyard for Lunatics." The 
library is located at 1343 6th St. For information call (213) 458-8600. Only 
books purchased at the library can be signed. 
</P>
<P>
And we said confession at the local church. It couldn't hurt. R.D.

IT'S A FAKE; 
</P>
<P>
ART: AN EXHIBIT AT POMONA COLLEGE GIVES VIEWERS THE CHANCE TO SEE MORE THAN TWO 
DOZEN CLEVER COPIES. 
</P>

<P>
Pretend you are a wealthy art collector. Before you are two medieval 
manuscripts, both painted on vellum, both showing centuries of wear. 
Unfortunately, one is a fake. 
</P>
<P>
How will you discern which manuscript dates back to medieval times and which 
was painted by a notorious Spanish forger in the 19th Century? 
</P>
<P>
You might start by honing your connoisseurship at Pomona College's Montgomery 
Gallery, where "Artful Deception: The Craft of the Forger" is on display 
through Dec. 2. The exhibit, which is traveling across the country, was 
organized by curators at the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
At this unusual show, viewers get a glimpse of more than two dozen fakes -- 
from 16th-Century Russian icons to the "Mona Lisa" to ancient busts of Roman 
youths. In some cases, the fakes are paired with genuine works in the same 
style. Viewers are invited to study them, read about the actual artist's style 
and background, then choose which piece they think is authentic. Sliding open a 
panel reveals whether the viewer has a future in art scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
As compelling as the "whodunit" tests are the cloak-and-dagger tales that 
accompany the forgeries, many of which have been exhibited as genuine for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the "Spanish forger" who faked the medieval manuscripts was a 
highly skilled and clever painter who went to great lengths to disguise his 
forgeries by using vellum that dated back to the Middle Ages, painting in the 
style of medieval illuminators and then "aging" his works. 
</P>
<P>
The forger, who art historians think was actually a Frenchman working in Paris 
during the Victorian era, went undetected in his own time. But 20th-Century art 
historians notice -- as Montgomery patrons may also -- that the forger was 
undone by his faces. To the contemporary eye, they smack of the cloying 
sweetness of the Victorian era and do not reflect the more somber, pious style 
of painters who worked in the Middle Ages. 
</P>
<P>
Copying important works of art is a practice that dates back to ancient Egypt, 
says Montgomery Gallery Director Marjorie L. Harth, who points out that not all 
fakes and forgeries were initially meant to deceive. 
</P>
<P>
The Romans, for instance, loved the classical Greek style and commissioned 
numerous copies of Greek art that were considered legitimate and highly 
desirable. 
</P>
<P>
Other artists were illicitly copied during their own lifetimes. Painter and 
wood engraver Albrecht Durer went to court in the early 16th Century to halt 
reproductions. On the other hand, Rubens and Rembrandt encouraged their 
students and assistants to copy their work as a way to learn the master's 
style. 
</P>
<P>
And Jean Baptiste Camille Corot (1796-1875) occasionally signed his students' 
works to help them professionally in their careers, thus muddying the waters 
for generations of art historians to come. As a result, says Harth, practically 
all Corots -- especially landscapes such as the one represented in the Pomona 
show -- have come under suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
The public's fascination with art and forgeries may be heightened by the 
millions of dollars that masterpieces command today on world markets, Harth 
says. A Van Gogh self-portrait in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art was 
recently removed from display when its authenticity was questioned. Ditto the 
"Kouros," a classical Greek bust of a youth displayed by the J. Paul Getty 
Museum, which came under suspicion when a very similar sculpture known to be a 
fake appeared on the market. 
</P>
<P>
The Pomona show explains the high-tech tools today's art historian uses to 
detect fakes: X-rays, infrared photographs and pigment analysis. One work in 
the show, a supposed early 16th-Century "Venetian Renaissance" panel painting 
of St. George slaying the dragon, was revealed as a 19th-Century fake after the 
Walters Conservation Lab noticed some suspiciously heavy overpainting on the 
canvas. 
</P>
<P>
An X-ray revealed a late 16th-Century painting of the Last Supper underneath. 
Subsequent analysis showed that the scene of St. George and the dragon was 
painted over the earlier work in the 19th Century. The curators have removed 
several sections of the forgery to reveal the head of one of Christ's disciples 
and the small dog at Christ's feet, giving patrons a fascinating glimpse at a 
forgery exposed. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to technical tools, historians use their knowledge to match 
artistic styles and flourishes with the appropriate cultures and epochs. 
</P>
<P>
Harth calls it "the complicated, interrelated workings of eye and brain." 
Perception, he says, is determined by context, "by the conditions, physical and 
intellectual, under which we see the work." 
</P>
<P>
"Once you know which one is authentic, it will look better than it did, and the 
one labeled fake will look worse," Harth promises. 
</P>
<P>
Fakes provide fascinating reference points for art historians. Like a slightly 
warped mirror, they reflect a skewed view of artistic reality -- but as with 
any illusion, they draw the viewer in. 
</P>
<P>
"Fakes speak eloquently of fallibility and of gullibility," Harth says. "Fakes 
. . . teach us to understand and to value authenticity in art." 
</P>
<P>
Forgers often are unable to transcend the barriers of their own time. A bust of 
a king from ancient Egypt's Ptolemaic dynasty is revealed as a fake by the 
playful, naive and human expression on the face. Walters curators say this is 
greatly at odds with the work of ancient Egyptian stone carvers, who depicted 
their kings as men of strength and power -- austere, remote and on a plane 
above mere mortals. 
</P>
<P>
Other times, fakes give themselves away by sloppy inattention to detail. A 
"Gothic" ivory carving in the exhibit was revealed as a fake when scholars 
noticed that St. Catherine is seated in the center, with the apostles Peter and 
Paul to the sides. A true Gothic carver, pious and theologically schooled, 
would never have ranked a mere saint above the apostles. 
</P>
<P>
Cross-cultural faking is even more difficult than that which attempts to 
transcend epochs. A pink ceramic vessel, allegedly from 18th-Century China's 
Ching Dynasty, is revealed as a 19th-Century Western European imitation by its 
lack of subtlety and its inability to reproduce the two-dimensional composition 
of Asian art popular at that time. 
</P>
<P>
Often, however, forgers are artists in their own right and earn the grudging 
admiration of art historians for their clever, albeit misplaced, genius. 
</P>
<P>
Icilio Federico Joni (1866-1946) was a Sienese painter, restorer, art dealer 
and forger who specialized in Renaissance paintings. Joni, who often used 
panels that dated from the Renaissance to throw historians off the scent, was 
unmasked because he allowed too many paintings to trace their provenance, or 
ownership history, back to him. In addition, Joni gave all the characters in 
his paintings the same long, broad noses and elaborate halos. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was Reinhold Vasters (1827-1909), the nearly perfect forger. A 
master goldsmith from Aachen, Germany, Vasters forged jewelry and decorative 
works in Renaissance style but was never exposed during his lifetime. The 
forgeries came to light in the early 1980s, when the working drawings for his 
fakes were discovered in the storerooms of the Victoria and Albert Museum in 
London. Perhaps, say the Walters curators, he left documentation to salve his 
ego and assure himself that his talent -- and his ability to fool the experts 
of his time -- would one day be known to all. 
</P>
<P>
Forgeries aren't always aesthetically inferior, either. Of the two Sevres 
clocks on display at the gallery, Harth says several curators would argue that 
the fake is actually superior. 
</P>
<P>
So what, then, is wrong with fakes? 
</P>
<P>
The Walters curators say: "A discredited work of art can only distort and 
obscure our view of the past." 
</P>
<P>
Harth adds that a forgery blemishes the reputation of the real artist and, 
perhaps more dangerously, creates a false basis of information about the artist 
and the period in question with which to judge future works. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Dutch painter Jan Vermeer (1632-1675) great, Harth says, "is not 
only that he painted beautiful pictures but that he painted certain pictures in 
a certain way at a certain time in the history and development of art. In 
addition to the craftsmanship, technique and cleverness of the painting, it 
shows genuine creative achievement."

AMBOSELI NATIONAL PARK, Kenya 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I couldn't be sure how many were out there. They had just shaken me from a deep 
sleep, a herd of cavorting hippopotamuses bellowing like out-of-tune tubas as 
they blundered and splashed in the dark waters a hundred feet from my tent. 
</P>
<P>
No one had said anything about camping with hippos, I thought as I listened to 
their midnight mirth on the shore of Lake Baringo. I lay awake most of the 
night, tracking their sounds through my canvas tent and waiting to sidle into 
the darkness to the distant latrine. But even when the revelry subsided and the 
camp seemed calm, the snorts and grunts of a lone hippo grazing between the 
tents kept me stranded inside. 
</P>
<P>
By the time I finally left the tent, the African sun was burning through the 
dawn clouds. The hippos were back in the lake resting, only their heads poked 
through the water, brown bumps peeping at the shore. We eight campers peered 
back, shaking our heads in awe and amusement at our obnoxious neighbors. I 
walked toward the lake to get a closer look. Two hippos yawned, showing 
cavernous, pink mouths. Others paddled closer, then circled out in single file 
and disappeared into the lake. 
</P>
<P>
"Camping," a friend said as we walked back to our tents, "is the only way to 
see Africa." 
</P>
<P>
That's the sentiment that convinced me to go camping for the first time. Until 
then, my idea of roughing it had been staying at a motel without an ice 
machine. But as our group reached the halfway point on a two-week camping 
safari through Kenya's most popular lakes and game parks in the summer of last 
year, I couldn't imagine better accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there are more comfortable ways to go on safari. One can see 
elephants grazing or lions playing in the high grass as easily from a lodge as 
from a campsite. But to fully experience the world beyond a minibus window, 
camping is authentically best. The sound of a hyena prowling outside your tent 
wraps you in the romance and reality of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The snow-covered peak of Tanzania's Mt. Kilimanjaro loomed through a sheath of 
clouds like a celestial being. On the blazing plain below, a bearded wildebeest 
scampered before a dozen grazing zebras, darting and leaping in a lunatic 
dance. A jackal ran ahead of the bus, then dived into the brush. A small herd 
of elephants grazed near the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
We had just arrived in Amboseli National Park after a four-hour trek on the 
dusty, pockmarked roads from Nairobi. Our guide, Joseph, sat amused in the 
driver's seat, politely jerking the minibus to a stop with each oohhh and aahhh 
from behind. "We will get much closer to the animals," he said. "Are you sure?" 
someone asked. "Yes, yes. I am sure. Trust me," he said, then laughed. 
</P>
<P>
A 30ish member of the Kikuyu tribe with extensive knowledge of the game parks, 
Joseph not only tracked animals but maneuvered the minibus to within a few feet 
of fighting elephants and feeding lions. Amboseli, one of Kenya's smallest game 
parks, is famous for its herds of wildebeests, Burchell's zebras, water 
buffaloes, gazelles and a handful of the endangered rhinoceroses, but it's the 
elephants that seize the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Although the elephants have been heavily poached for their ivory during the 
last decade, the gray giants seemed to be everywhere in Amboseli. They grazed 
in herds numbering from a few individuals to a few hundred, always with 
sentries posted for their only predator, man. 
</P>
<P>
Alongside our minibus, a calf tried to filch a bunch of grass that another calf 
had shaken free of dirt. A bull inexplicably dropped to its front knees and 
kicked its hind legs like a circus performer. Two juveniles squared off in 
play, their trunks entwined, one driving the other like a sumo wrestler into 
our shadow. 
</P>
<P>
At dusk we drove to our campsite, marked by a stone in a cluster of thorn trees 
surrounded by the the dusty plain. 
</P>
<P>
This is the no-frills camp. Those wishing more pampered treatment can choose 
from several luxury tour operators who offer campsites with permanent tents and 
private baths, meals served on fine china and good wines. But we were 
comfortable enough in our rickety abodes, sleeping in bags on thin foam 
mattresses and dining on staples -- lots of bread, cheese and fresh fruit. The 
cost was about $1,200 each. 
</P>
<P>
Our first night in the bush was cool and quiet; it surprised me. I expected the 
night to be more menacing and claustrophobic. The cook managed a good meal of 
pasta, potatoes and beans on a fire that brought our group together under the 
sparkling canopy of the Southern Hemisphere. Over drinks, we traded stories of 
travels and careers, and drifted into the darkness to our tents. 
</P>
<P>
During the next few days our routine was to drive in the morning to view 
wildlife and return in the heat of the day to camp, some to sit at the shaded 
table to read or write letters, while others washed clothes or napped. 
</P>
<P>
One afternoon I followed the sounds of laughter from my tent to the edge of 
camp, where three young Masai herdsmen leaned against a minibus, talking with a 
few of our group. They wore traditional red cloth, tied like a toga over their 
lanky frames. Elaborate red and yellow earrings dangled from their spool-sized 
lobes. Their hair, braided and matted with red ocher and fat, stained the backs 
of their necks. 
</P>
<P>
The eldest of them let us examine his weapons. He appeared to be in his 20s, 
but no one was sure -- years are not counted by the Masai. We touched the sword 
and spear he used to protect his cattle from predators. The Masai protect their 
herds fiercely, for not only do they measure their worth in cattle, they live 
on milk and blood drawn from living cows. 
</P>
<P>
We spent two more hours together. They were intrigued by our jewelry, cameras 
and sunglasses. Then they returned to the bush to watch their cattle graze 
under the high sun. We went back to writing and reading about the people of 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
After three days in Amboseli, we headed north through the lush forests and 
grasslands of Mt. Kenya, then out on the plains to the Samburu Game Reserve. We 
set up camp on the sandy banks of the Ewaso Ng'iro, a muddy oasis amid a 
parched landscape of desert scrub and savanna that's home to a range of 
wildlife. It's one of the few places in Kenya to see the reticulated giraffe 
and the Grevey's zebra, together with Marabou storks, gazelles, dik-dik and 
gerenuk (varieties of antelope), and, of course, vultures. 
</P>
<P>
Samburu brought home the usual risks of camping: a snake near the latrine, 
warnings of scorpions and of crocodiles. An unusual risk, too: "There has been 
some trouble with Sudanese refugees," our guide said as he explained why two 
guards armed with machine guns had been hired to patrol the camp. 
</P>
<P>
Sudan was 300 miles from our camp, an unlikely source of danger. Only after our 
return to the United States did the reason become clear: In July, 1989, 
poachers and bandits were believed to have slain five tourists, including a 
Connecticut woman, in the game parks. Since then the Kenyan government has 
stepped up patrols and instituted a shoot-to-kill policy against poachers. The 
U.S. State Department currently says security has "improved markedly" but 
cautions against solo camping. 
</P>
<P>
We moved west from Samburu to Lake Baringo in Kenya's lake region in the scar 
of the Rift Valley. The rough roads carried us slowly through the late-morning 
bustle of small villages. A man, twirling a blade of grass in his teeth, walked 
his bicycle past a woman balancing a basket of vegetables on her head. Outside 
the villages, herdsmen pushed their goats and cows through the valley fields. 
</P>
<P>
The most famous of the Rift Valley lakes is Lake Nakuru, where, in one of the 
world's greatest bird spectacles, 2 million flamingos gather in alkaline waters 
to feast on its algae. 
</P>
<P>
One sees a bustle of pink and white as the birds skittishly preen, feed, honk 
and flap. Their spindly necks and legs belie the gracefulness they reach in the 
air, black-spotted wings and outstretched bodies in effortless flight which 
concludes with a running splash in the shallow waters. 
</P>
<P>
The national park at Lake Nakuru pales in comparison with the others; we saw 
only a few water bucks and oryxes there. But, as with the hippos at Lake 
Baringo, the best wildlife encounters took place at the campsite. As we set up 
camp under the tall acacias, water bucks grazed in the lush green grass, dozens 
of Vervet monkeys skittered about and a handful of baboons retreated to the 
bushes behind our tents. 
</P>
<P>
At night a group of bush pigs crashed through the food tent, bumbling in the 
dark through the cans and pots. The cook screamed to scare them off, and a few 
of us laughed as he muttered about his sleepless night. 
</P>
<P>
We left the Rift Valley -- and the only campsites with showers and toilets -- 
for three days in Masai Mara, the largest and last game park on our safari. The 
Masai Mara Game Reserve ranges over 974 square miles that adjoin the Serengeti 
Plain of Tanzania and is famous for the more than 1 million wildebeests and 
thousands of zebras, gazelles and antelopes that migrate there once a year. 
</P>
<P>
We found instead a smattering of gazelles, giraffes, topi and anxious predators 
amid an Edenic landscape of grassy plains and acacia trees. 
</P>
<P>
A male lion, his ribs showing through an emaciated body, moved slowly along the 
plain. The wind rustled his black mane. Behind him, in the golden camouflage of 
the savanna, three lionesses licked and nuzzled their cubs as they grappled for 
milk. 
</P>
<P>
On the horizon, five giraffes marched in a row, heads bobbing in unison. Shafts 
of light broke through a low cumulus canopy onto hundreds of Thomsen's gazelles 
as they grazed. 
</P>
<P>
These and other images that unfolded during the next three days enraptured me 
as we crisscrossed the vast Masai Mara. Even the driving rainstorm that 
shortened our last game drive and toppled my tent left me secured by this 
noble, pristine landscape. 
</P>
<P>
It was our last night on safari. The rain had soaked my tent and sleeping bag 
and left me only a small spot to sit on. I waited for the storm to end, 
remembering a conversation I had with a Kikuyu merchant at a roadside stand. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you like our country?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"It is quite beautiful," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, but it is only beautiful to the foreigner," he said. "To us it's only 
very poor." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed the realities of Kenya -- the potholes of its capital, the poaching of 
its wildlife -- belie much of the land's romance. Some of us carried Karen 
Blixen books and other adventure stories to help us imagine a world long gone. 
</P>
<P>
But as we drove through Masai Mara for the final time, a shared, primeval 
heritage still seemed to beat on these vast plains. It was quiet and empty and 
I watched the bus tracks dissolve in the grass. I wished to see a giraffe or 
gazelle for the last time, but there was nothing, only a solitary, crooked 
acacia twitching in the wind. 
</P>

"I'd love to go, I really would," said my wife. 
</P>
<P>
"But?" 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you know. Bugs. Snakes. Stuff that eats you: lions and leopards and 
tigers." 
</P>
<P>
"No tigers in Africa." 
</P>
<P>
"OK, but no toilet paper either. No hot water. And food: I like mine completely 
dead. Look, I'd love to see the elephants before they're gone. I'd love to see 
a giraffe at dawn, eating off the top of a thorn tree. I'd love to see one of 
those sweet little deer-y animals with the long necks. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Gerenuks." 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever. I'm sure I'd love it all, but I am not sleeping on the ground over a 
mamba hole with tsetse flies up my nose." 
</P>
<P>
"You don't know what you're missing," I told her, "but I tell you what. It 
being our anniversary and all, suppose I take you to Kenya -- lions, giraffes, 
rhinos, the whole nine yards. And promise you soft beds under netting, good 
food, maybe even a little dance music. And Kleenex." 
</P>
<P>
"Kleenex?" 
</P>
<P>
"Kleenex." 
</P>
<P>
"You're on." 
</P>
<P>
I take mild issue with Thomas Romeo's accompanying contention that "Camping is 
the only way to see Africa." Agreed, camping is truly a blast. But there are 
many ways to experience this disappearing Eden, ranging from the suicidal to 
the sybaritic. I have been lucky enough to sample most of them, usually as the 
Blanche Dubois of the Bush, relying on the kindness of strangers. 
</P>
<P>
In a gentler time, I had walked through the sleepy villages of Gambia and slept 
on a chief's hammock. 
</P>
<P>
I had driven cross-country through the Tanzanian night in a Land Rover piloted 
by a madman intent on bagging a dik-dik for his brother in Ujiji, and ridden a 
gravid "mammy Wagon" 100 miles with an infatuated pig on my lap. I had been in 
a forest fire in the Congo (OK, Zaire), a riot in Rwanda. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Never, never had I done time in what my wife calls "a proper bed." It was a 
revelation. 
</P>
<P>
For the Kleenex crowd -- which is most of us -- Kenya probably is the best bet, 
for several reasons. First, it's better organized for the tourist. 
</P>
<P>
Second, Kenya's terrain (and consequently its fauna and flora) is wildly 
varied, from desert to jungle to bush to forest to a snow-capped mountain right 
on top of the Equator. 
</P>
<P>
The trick is to get out of the capital of Nairobi as quickly as possible. It is 
a scruffy, dysfunctional city with all the charm of Depression-era 
Poughkeepsie. 
</P>
<P>
Tack a note for friends on the trunk of the thorn tree at the New Stanley 
Hotel. (If you have no friends, fake it; it's one of the things you do in 
Kenya.) 
</P>
<P>
Then scoot. 
</P>
<P>
Forty minutes away by twin-engined bush plane is the Masai Mara, a vast, 
numinous game reserve just over the border from Tanzania's fabled Serengeti. 
</P>
<P>
Our gutty little aircraft plunged from the high plains into the savannah, and 
we were met at the gravel strip by one of Africa's ubiquitous "Combis": 
four-wheel-drive mini-vans, topless, perfectly designed for illegally standing 
on the seat, head and torso untrammeled, the better to play Lord of Creation. 
</P>
<P>
A meddle of monkeys, four wart hogs and a lone, stately eland later, we drove 
through the gate of the Mara Safari Club, in time for passion fruit cocktails 
all around. 
</P>
<P>
Passing through a grand spotless lodge of polished hardwood (the club opened 
only last December), we were escorted to our "tent." Tent? Our quarters were to 
the traditional conception of a tent as the Trump Tower is to a tepee. 
</P>
<P>
Shaped like a Quonset hut in canvas, the tent was easily 30 feet long, not 
counting 10 more feet of front "patio" furnished with leather camp chairs. 
Inside were carpets over a stone floor; two large, comfortable beds with 
netting and electric lanterns for reading; a shower, a toilet, a dressing table 
with padded seat, mirror, fluorescent light, and 24-hour hot water from an 
individual outdoor heater fueled by a wood fire. And Kleenex. 
</P>
<P>
Africa can overwhelm even the most fearless, but there are few introductions 
more felicitous than sitting on one's own patio, feet up, Tusker beer in hand, 
overlooking a sharp bend in the Mara River. 
</P>
<P>
In the mud below, an amorphous bulge of hippos lazily jostling for position. 
Right across the little river, in the high grass, a kaffeeklatsch of baboons, 
toting their baboonlets papoose-style. Downriver, a monstrous crocodile 
snorkeling up on a bobbing pair of Egyptian geese, just for practice. 
</P>
<P>
The real adventure was to begin after a dip in the club pool and a buffet lunch 
in the lodge with more dishes than a Tupperware party. 
</P>
<P>
The real adventure began, of course, on the first Combi run through the vast 
Mara, teeming with game; and the morning run, and the next evening run and the 
next morning run -- each adding a hundred individual grace notes to future 
memories of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
It is not the intention here to babble about animals; the section isn't large 
enough. Each sally outside one's cosseting quarters, however, holds its own 
transcendent moment, as well as its own frisson. 
</P>
<P>
Mara moment: An acacia tree, sequined with vultures, shading a family of sleek 
and pot-bellied cheetahs after their breakfast run at an unlucky herd of 
impalas. (The family that preys together stays together.) 
</P>
<P>
Mara frisson: A low-throated midnight scream from an adjoining tent -- 
blessedly followed by a relieved giggle. 
</P>
<P>
A Canadian named Michael, sliding into bed, had toed something warm and 
wiggling and shot from his sack like a man possessed. It turned out to be an 
unexpected hot-water bottle. 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, after a five-course dinner, coffee and cognac, a dance by the 
local Masai and an evening of deliciously gory stories by Mike Clifton, the 
Mara Club's "resident naturalist." 
</P>
<P>
Back into Nairobi and back out again, this time on a Combi ride north to the 
Samburu Game Reserve, past fields and farms and roadside stores. Samburu is on 
the edge of the encroaching desert, just this side of bandit country, in 
terrain as different from the Mara as Utah is from Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
The Sharova Shaba perches picturesquely on the banks of the Ewaso Ng'iro River. 
Its 80 rooms -- two tiers of indigenous wood and stone blending so well with 
the landscape that you can't see the compound until you're upon it -- are the 
epitome of luxury in the wilderness: 
</P>
<P>
Over the beds, but still inside the obligatory netting, are adjustable ceiling 
fans, for cold or hot. 
</P>
<P>
There are cushioned wicker chairs, a modern bathroom, tiled floors, 
flashlights, bug bombs (which we never used), Kleenex (!) and picture windows 
front and back, one overlooking river and bush, the opposite one improbably 
framing a tangle of trees, ferns and a small zoo's worth of peculiar jumping 
and burrowing things. 
</P>
<P>
The grounds are imaginatively and impeccably landscaped with natural streams, 
bridges, magnificent old baobab trees and flowers a Los Angeles florist would 
kill for. 
</P>
<P>
The dining lodge is open-air, up on stilts, with a 360-degree view that 
includes a huge, meandering swimming pool below. 
</P>
<P>
And food to match: Just for openers, breakfast comes equipped with eight 
different juices; scones and rolls and toast and pastries; the standard eggs 
and cereals, and an open-end choice of bacon, ham, sausages and some tasty if 
unidentified meatstuffs that it's probably best not to question. 
</P>
<P>
Routine is the same as in the Mara -- if a game run can ever be considered 
"routine" -- with nighttime dance shows by native Samburu and Somali tribes who 
do things with head and body that Michael Jackson only dreams of. 
</P>
<P>
This is gerenuk country, and reticulated giraffe and oryx and Grevey's zebra 
and a whole platoon of critters found nowhere else on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Samburu moment: A water buck, head and horns as still as a trophy, standing in 
the grass, only its nostrils moving, telling him a tale of life or death. 
</P>
<P>
Samburu frisson: Coming over a rise and finding our Combi grill to tusk with a 
pair of extremely large elephants in flagrante delicto. Male elephant charges 
Combi. Combi is faster. Driver: "Well, I suppose I'd be mad too." 
</P>
<P>
Like tacking a note to the thorn tree, one must spend a night at Treetops. 
Obligatory. This is the three-story wooden barracks on the edge of a water hole 
-- a pond, really -- just inside the central Kenya's Aberdare reserve. The 
place Elizabeth of Britain climbed up as a princess and climbed down a queen. 
J.S. Prickett, resident griot, remembers. 
</P>
<P>
He was there. Prickett still tells the old tales -- the good old tales -- and 
he still feigns annoyance when his nightly talk is interrupted by arrival of 
the first herd of elephants and the bar/lounge empties in a cacophonous dash 
for rooftop or camera pit. 
</P>
<P>
Treetop rooms are clean, comfortable but small -- just big enough for 
double-deck beds, but it doesn't matter. Nobody sleeps. 
</P>
<P>
The pond and banks below are spotlighted, the animals have long since 
accustomed to the glow, and nocturnal beasties roam the area all night long. 
There is a late-evening feast at the long communal table, and mostly there is 
the thrill of just being within touching distance of the mysteries of an 
African night. 
</P>
<P>
Treetops moment: On the fringe of a circle of elephants trunking for salt is a 
hard-muscled Cape buffalo, preening and pawing and looking for all the world 
like what he is -- the most feared and dangerous beast in all of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Out of the night charges another buff, straight through the startled ring of 
elephants, straight into the braced horns of buff No. 1. No. 1 is knocked 
halfway across the pond. No. 2 snorts, does a little soft-shoe, and trots back 
into the forest. We'll never know. 
</P>
<P>
Treetops frisson: Have you ever had a bush baby up your pant leg? 
</P>
<P>
Sometime or other you've got to wind down from all that Combi riding to begin 
to make the transition back to what is laughingly known as "the real world." 
There is no better place in Africa than the Old World pomp of the Mount Kenya 
Safari Club. 
</P>
<P>
At the foot of what the Kenyans call "The Mountain of the Gods," the club's 
manicured grounds roll out, golf-course green, into an infinity of lakes, 
groves, gardens and forest. 
</P>
<P>
One may have a massage or a swim or a Combi ride or a shopping spree, or one 
may sit on one of the terraces and lose oneself in the graceful gyrations of 
the resident flamingos and egrets and storks and herons and ibises, and plot 
ways to stay another day. 
</P>
<P>
And there is a coat-and-tie banquet, and a very sophisticated little combo 
winding up its international-song gig with a rousing chorus of "Jambo, Bwana." 
</P>
<P>
It's beyond corny, beyond touristy, and everyone joins in and then toddles off 
to bed, exquisitely pampered and pooped. 
</P>
<P>
It's all a far cry from camping out -- the antithesis of camping out. In lieu 
of a campfire there was a pleasant, gregarious man, assigned just to us, who 
came in to stoke our personal little bedroom blaze as a chill night straddled 
the Equator. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere down below, a Kikuyu group was entertaining the late-nighters, doing 
a series of drum riffs in undulating, intricate rhythms that somehow 
recapitulated a glorious fortnight in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
On my wife's night stand was a fresh box of Kleenex. 
</P>
<P>
Camping, shmamping. It doesn't get any better than this.

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: AIR CARRIERS ARE FACING SOME TIMELY QUESTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION CLAIMS MAJOR CARRIERS HAVE IMPROVED 
ON-TIME PERFORMANCES. BUT A NEW REPORT SAYS OTHERWISE.

<P>
Recently, I was flying to New York from Los Angeles. American Airlines Flight 
10 left LAX at 10 p.m. and was scheduled to arrive at New York's JFK Airport at 
6:07 the next morning. But when the "red eye" landed at 6, the pilot anounced, 
"Will the flight attendants please prepare for an early arrival?" 
</P>
<P>
My question: Early compared to what? 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, the same flight, flying at the same time, was scheduled to 
arrive in New York at 5:44 a.m. Officially, we had arrived seven minutes early 
in 1990. But by 1980 standards, we had arrived 16 minutes late. 
</P>
<P>
The airline could boast it had arrived early. And I could argue that we were 
late. Who's right? 
</P>
<P>
Technically, the airline is, since it arrived ahead of the time printed on the 
official schedule. But the real issue is truth in scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, delays in the air and on the ground are at an all-time high. Delays 
in the New York area, for example, have increased 45% in the last year, 
according to the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
But airline gridlock and scheduling problems are not new. 
</P>
<P>
More than three years ago, in an attempt to improve airline on-time 
performance, the U.S. Department of Transportation began requiring airlines to 
report their on-time performance. Since September, 1987, a flight is considered 
"on time" if it departs from or arrives at its gate within 15 minutes of the 
scheduled time. 
</P>
<P>
However, since the reporting rule went into effect, a number of airlines have 
been playing with their schedules, adding extra minutes to the official flight 
times. 
</P>
<P>
And what's been the result? 
</P>
<P>
On one hand, DOT reports that major domestic airlines have continued to improve 
their on-time performance. In July, for example, the 12 largest U.S. carriers 
reported operating 80.9% of their domestic flights within 15 minutes of 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
And DOT does list 52 flights on its "list of shame" -- flights that were late 
more than 80% of the time. In August, Delta Flight 977, from Philadelphia to 
Atlanta, was late 100% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
However, since so many of the airlines have padded their flight times on the 
schedules, a majority of the on-time performance reporting, as well as the 
final statistics, are essentially meaningless for most travelers. 
</P>
<P>
"The on-time performance stats that get reported," says Kenneth Mead, director 
of transportation issues for the General Accounting Office, "do not reflect the 
efficiency in air travel." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Mead's team at GAO issued a report to Congress that 
investigated whether the airlines had adjusted their flight schedules 
unrealistically, whether on-time performance statistics reflected improved 
airline efficiency and whether or not additional federal agency observation was 
required to monitor airline performance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's true," says Mead, "that in 1980, you could go from Washington to Chicago 
in 2 hours and 15 minutes. But now the schedule shows 2 hours and 45 minutes 
and the airline claims they're on time. If the airlines play by the rules, then 
the on-time disclosure stats are only intended to require how on-time the 
airlines are . . . based on their schedules." 
</P>
<P>
And therein lies the problem. 
</P>
<P>
What did the GAO report find? 
</P>
<P>
"First," says Mead, "we discovered that yes, the airlines did adjust their 
schedules to improve on-time performance. It's a great deal for airlines if 
they can boast arrivals within the new time limits listed in their schedules. 
But what surprised us is that, even with the additional time on the schedules, 
the on-time performance stats are still nothing to write home about. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still significant delays. And for business travelers who are 
time-sensitive, the on-time stats are not indicative of increased efficiency. 
Instead, they are indicative of how long it really takes you to get from one 
point to another." 
</P>
<P>
There's another problem that GAO discovered with on-time performance reports by 
airlines: flights that are delayed or canceled for mechanical reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, mechanical problems exempt a flight from being included in on-time 
performance stats. It's an important exemption, because of safety 
considerations. "We don't want airlines flying broken planes just to support an 
on-time performance percentage," says one investigator. 
</P>
<P>
However, the GAO investigation found that while the Department of 
Transportation "monitors the number of flights excluded . . . from the data for 
mechanical problems, it does not verify that these flights had mechanical 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
While mechanical problems must also be reported to the FAA, the report said 
that the FAA "does not record the mechanical problem data in a way that allows 
DOT to cross-check the information." 
</P>
<P>
According to the most recent DOT statistics, more than 23,000 flights are 
excluded from on-time data per month because of apparent mechanical problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't always been clear," says Frank Mulvey, assistant director of the 
competition and consumer affairs division of GAO, "that a mechanical delay or 
cancellation was really due to mechanical problems or that the crew was late or 
that there were loading problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure that if the plane is canceled for mechanical reasons, it 
is indeed for those reasons. And we want the FAA to develop a way to verify 
these problems." 
</P>
<P>
There's an additional rub to the scheduling scam. Even the airlines who have 
padded the schedules are somewhat reluctant to do so. Why? Because by listing a 
flight at 2 hours and 45 minutes instead of 2 hours and 15 minutes, airlines 
then have to pay their pilots based on those times. 
</P>
<P>
And since pilots are limited by federal rule to a certain number of flight 
hours per month, some airlines are finding that the public relations gains they 
might be enjoying by announcing improved on-time performance are being 
overweighed by a shortage of flight crew members toward the end of each month, 
when pilots run out of their legal hours. Ironically, that can result in flight 
cancellations. 
</P>
<P>
Still, that hasn't stopped some airlines from boasting about their on-time 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
In March, the Trump Shuttle announced it would "unconditionally guarantee" 
on-time arrivals for its hourly New York-Washington and New York-Boston 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
The deal: Trump Shuttle flights would arrive within 15 minutes of scheduled 
arrival time or passengers would be given free tickets for a future flight. It 
was an unusual move, since New York's La Guardia Airport is one of the most 
delay-prone in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
As luck would have it, immediately after the shuttle guarantee was offered, 
there were weather problems in Boston and New York. In the first 17 days that 
the promotion ran, the airline distributed more than 17,000 free tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in September, Northwest Airlines announced an even bolder on-time 
performance guarantee. For the month of October, Northwest guaranteed free 
round-trip tickets to members of its frequent flier program if any of its 
flights arrived at 18 Southern U.S. airports more than 14 minutes late. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed like a good risk. All of Northwest's flights to these airports 
(including Austin, Baton Rouge, Knoxville, Oklahoma City, San Antonio and Tulsa 
) are served by Northwest's Memphis hub. And for the past seven months, the 
Memphis Airport ranks first in on-time arrivals and departures of the 30 
largest U.S. airports. (In August, on-time arrivals were at 89.1%, departures 
at 90.4%.) 
</P>
<P>
So how did it turn out? "It was extremely successful," says Homer Laird, 
Northwest's marketing manager for the Southern region. "On the first day of the 
program, our flights operated at 100% on-time," he reports. "On Oct. 31, they 
operated at 100%." 
</P>
<P>
And what about the rest of the month? 
</P>
<P>
"Let's just say we gave away a few tickets," he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the promotion worked. "We estimated our potential liability based on 
an 85% on-time performance," says Laird, "and we ran at 89.8." 
</P>
<P>
Still, even the good statistics mask a bigger air traffic system problem. 
</P>
<P>
And, finally, there's the problem of language. The next time you hear the words 
"prepare for an early arrival," you might want to remind the offending airline 
that we only set our clocks ahead once a year.

HOT SPOTS ON BRITISH ROCK TRAIL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Screaming Lord Sutch stood on a Soho district sidewalk one recent afternoon 
doing what he does best -- screaming. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony Sheridan taught the Beatles everything they know," he yelled into a 
megaphone, while the crowd around him admired his sentiments and sparkly, 
tiger-print suit. 
</P>
<P>
It was a special day for Lord Sutch, the veteran musician and head of the 
Raving Looney political party, and a graying pack of fellow pre-Beatle pop 
stars who had gathered to pay tribute to the spawning ground of British rock 
'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
An official Harp Beat Rock Plaque was being unveiled to commemorate the former 
site of the legendary 2 I's Club, the tiny coffeehouse where England's original 
rockers got their start. A restaurant called Le Bistingo now occupies the 
premises at 59 Old Compton St. 
</P>
<P>
The Soho ceremony was part of an ongoing program to put up plaques at sites of 
historical significance to British rock music. 
</P>
<P>
Previously honored with plaques were the Widnes railway station in the county 
of Chesire, where Paul Simon wrote "Homeward Bound" in 1965, and the town hall 
in Walsall, some 150 miles northwest of London, where Slade played its first 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
The plaque project is an offshoot of a remarkable book published last year, 
called the "Harp Beat Rock Gazetteer of Great Britain," by rock historian Pete 
Frame. (Harp is the beer company that sponsors the project.) 
</P>
<P>
Organized city by city, Frame's guide compiled hundreds of listings noting 
births, deaths, important gigs, scandals and other bits of fascinating rock 
history and trivia. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a normal gazetteer," says Frame, standing amid the Soho hubbub, 
"except it doesn't show you where castles are and where monks are and where 
Henry the VIII got his head cut off and things like that. It tells you where 
Keith Moon burned hotels, where P. J. Proby split his pants and where Screaming 
Lord Sutch, there" -- he points across the room to the loudest person -- "won 
election campaigns and things like that." 
</P>
<P>
After the book came out, Frame said, he and the publishers decided it would be 
a good idea to put up plaques at landmark sites. 
</P>
<P>
"All over England we have these plaques that tell you where novelists and 
scientists and politicians or whatever lived," he said. Frame and his 
publishers decided that rock 'n' roll, with all its cultural importance to 
Britain, should be included. 
</P>
<P>
Few places seemed as deserving of a plaque as the 2 I's. "This is the 
birthplace of English rock 'n' roll," says Frame. Tommy Steele was discovered 
there in 1956. Cliff Richard played there under his real name, Harry Webb. 
Lionel Bart, who wrote rock songs before composing musicals such as "Oliver," 
had painted murals on the club's walls. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Glitter, whose career peaked in the early '70s, was playing there under 
the name of Paul Raven in the early '60s. (His rendition of "Walk on By" was a 
big hit in the Middle East in 1961.) 
</P>
<P>
Dressed all in leather for the plaque ceremony, Glitter sang a rap song he'd 
apparently just written. Later, Lord Sutch joined him for an a cappella "Whole 
Lotta Shakin' Going On." 
</P>
<P>
Adam Faith, in a conservative suit, recalled that more than 150 people used to 
crowd into the living-room-size club. "It would get so hot," he recalled, "that 
people would faint and would have to be carried outside." 
</P>
<P>
"And they'd make them pay to get back in again," cracked the ubiquitous Lord 
Sutch. 
</P>
<P>
"The 2 I's became the magic place of its time," said Paul Lincoln, who 
co-founded the club in 1956. He recalled how American stars -- Connie Francis 
and Paul Anka among them -- used to drop in when they were in London. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln even helped launch the music career of Kris Kristofferson, who was 
attending Oxford University in the late '50s. The American won a music 
competition at the club, but Lincoln, who began managing him, made him change 
his name to Kris Carson. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'You'll never make it with the name Kristofferson,' " said 
Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Frame, who is also noted for his genealogy books of rock family trees, says 
he's not certain where the next rock plaque will go up. A likely spot is the 
east London gas station where the Rolling Stones were cited and fined for 
urinating on a wall in June, 1965. 
</P>
<P>
"They were coming back from a gig," says Frame, "and they stopped at a petrol 
station to (urinate) and the bloke there said, 'Sorry, we're not opening up the 
loo for you.' So they said, 'All right, we'll (urinate) on the wall,' and he 
went in and called the cops and they got fined. Of course, that just enhanced 
their rebellious image." 
</P>
<P>
Another possibility for a plaque is the Hope &amp; Anchor pub in the Islington 
section of London (207 Upper St.). 
</P>
<P>
According to Frame, the place was "pub rock Mecca" for more than a decade with 
Stiff Records chief Dave Robinson running a recording studio inside and many 
provincial bands, including U2 and Joy Division, making their London debuts 
there. 
</P>
<P>
One of Frame's favorite nuggets of Brit rock esoterica -- and another prime 
candidate for a plaque -- is the Fox and Hounds pub in Caversham (Berkshire 
County), where Paul McCartney and John Lennon spent a week's holiday in April, 
1960. 
</P>
<P>
McCartney's cousin ran the place and the two future legends played an Everly 
Brothers-style acoustic set there, billing themselves as the Nurk Twins. 
</P>
<P>
But maybe Frame and the others behind the Harp Beat Rock Plaque scheme will 
decide on something a bit more obscure for the next commemorative ceremony? How 
about the spot in Birkenhead, near Liverpool, where idiosyncratic mid-'80s cult 
favorites Half Man Half Biscuit turned down a television appearance because 
their favorite soccer team, the Tranmere Rovers, were playing at home that 
night?

BOUND FOR THE PINES IN THE MOUNTAINS OF OJAI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chumash Indians called this tranquil place, backed by the Topatopa and 
Sulphur mountains, Ojai, which means "nest." 
</P>
<P>
Its meditative setting has spawned an artists' colony, a music festival and a 
number of health resorts. The environment has attracted the metaphysically 
minded, too; the hiker can look down on the Krotona Institute of Theosophy on 
one side of town and the Krishnamurti Foundation on the other. 
</P>
<P>
Horn Canyon Trail was reportedly one of Krishnamurti's favorite walks. He 
sometimes told the tale of how in his younger days he befriended a mountain 
lion along this trail. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Horn Canyon is still an inspiring walk -- even if you don't talk to the 
animals. The canyon itself is a shady retreat watered by a seasonal stream. 
Climbing out of the canyon, the trail offers fine views of Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The Pines, the appropriately named goal of this hike, is a pine tree 
plantation. Local historians disagree on who planted the pines. 
</P>
<P>
Some say Jacinto D. Reyes, an early forest ranger, established an experimental 
plantation three miles up Horn Canyon. Other historians credit early settler 
Howard Bald with nurturing the pine seedlings. 
</P>
<P>
The Pines burned in the 1932 Matilija Fire and again in a 1948 blaze. 
</P>
<P>
For many decades, the pines have been planted -- and replanted -- by students 
from Thacher School, the well-known private school at the mouth of Horn Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Today, The Pines is a National Forest Service trail camp and welcomes hikers 
with shade and trickling spring. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to trailhead: From downtown Ojai, drive east on Highway 150 (Ojai 
Avenue). About three-fourths of a mile from the center of town, you'll see a 
Los Padres National Forest Ranger Station on your right. The station, open 8 
a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday, has maps and information. 
</P>
<P>
Continue a short distance past the station and turn left on Gridley Road. After 
three-tenths of a mile, turn right on Grand Avenue and drive half a mile to 
McAndrew Road. Turn left and drive another half a mile. 
</P>
<P>
Although McAndrew Road bends left to join Thacher Road, continue straight into 
the Thacher school ground and park in an area assigned to visitors. 
</P>
<P>
The hike: From the school's visitors parking lot, walk toward the mountains 
along the asphalt road about 100 yards. At a signed fork directing you to 
"Gymkana Area and Jameson Field," angle right onto a dirt road, which leads 
another 100 yards through an orchard to a gated dirt road on your left. 
</P>
<P>
This dirt road, with a Forest Service trail sign, is the beginning of Horn 
Canyon Trail. 
</P>
<P>
The wide dirt path ascends up-canyon. On your left is the Thacher School 
Observatory. Behind you, after a quarter-mile of travel, is a fine view of Ojai 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
On good days you can understand why the valley was the setting for Shangri-La 
in the 1937 movie "Lost Horizon." 
</P>
<P>
Branching from the main path are a couple of narrow ones, used by student 
horseback riders. 
</P>
<P>
Horn Canyon Trail crosses the seasonal creek a couple of times. (Given the 
severity of the drought, it might be a long time before hikers get wet crossing 
this creek and an even longer time before visitors can cool off in its pools 
and cascades.) 
</P>
<P>
During autumn, the sycamores along the creek show off their fall color, and 
during spring, wildflowers line the trail. 
</P>
<P>
After a long mile, the road ends and Horn Canyon Trail becomes a narrow path 
that ascends steeply up the west wall of the canyon. The trail, stabilized by 
railroad ties, soon leaves the shade of the oaks and sycamores and climbs hot, 
exposed slopes. 
</P>
<P>
The Pines, a green island floating atop a sea of gray chaparral, seem 
tantalizingly close when you first spot the stand from a bend in the trail. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, you'll have to climb steeply another half a mile before you reach the 
welcome shade of the conifers at an elevation of 3,260 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Take a snooze on a bed of pine needles, splash some spring water on your face 
and enjoy the little trail camp. 
</P>
<P>
Serious hikers will continue ascending steep Horn Canyon Trail onward toward 
Topa Topa Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
From The Pines it's a very long mile climb to Forest Road 4N15 and another mile 
climb to Forest Road 5N08. Another long mile up this road is Chief Peak. 
</P>
<P>
Less serious hikers may wish to return the way they came, enjoying the scenic 
trail and its panoramic vistas of the Ojai Valley.

FLORIDA KEYS' ISLAMORADA: SEA TROVE OF ACTIVITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE MULLER, Muller is a Pittsburgh free-lance writer/photographer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ISLAMORADA, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You're on top of a serene blue world on the high white bridge just south of 
Lower Matecumbe Island in the Florida Keys. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on which way you turn, the waters gleam azure or sapphire: Toward 
mainland Florida the warm, shallow bay is an opalescent aquamarine; across the 
deep Atlantic your eyes skim electric shades of blue as far as the Gulf Stream, 
a river of indigo pushing north at seven knots. 
</P>
<P>
This unbound, living sea is the main reason to visit the Keys. Here, the sun 
rises out of the Atlantic and sinks into Florida Bay, and you can witness both 
events the same day simply by crossing the Overseas Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Many travelers think of the Keys only as anchors for Highway 1's 115 miles and 
42 bridges from the mainland to Key West. But there are hundreds of keys in 
Florida Bay, and the long chain connected by the road is divided into the 
Upper, Middle and Lower Keys, all with their own attractions. Green mile 
markers along the highway (often used as addresses) start at zero in Key West 
and end at 126 just below Florida City on the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
The Islamorada group of islands in the Upper Keys, beginning at Plantation Key 
(Mile Marker 90) and stretching south to Long Key (MM 68), calls itself the 
"sport fishing capital of the world." 
</P>
<P>
The town of Islamorada on Upper Matecumbe Key has the largest concentration of 
charter fishing boats in the entire chain of islands, with several large 
marinas furnishing charter trips or rental boats so you can fish for tuna, 
amberjack or blue marlin, or sail into Florida Bay, part of Everglades National 
Park, to watch for endangered crocodiles, manatees and roseate spoonbills. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing reports are always available if you can scan your way through the 
ubiquitous Cuban salsa on the car radio to chatty WCTH, 100.3 FM. This local 
station also tells you where the local captains are and who has chartered them. 
</P>
<P>
But fishing is only one reason to stop over on this 20-mile stretch of the 
Keys. Many nearby attractions, including the continental United States' only 
living coral reef, superior hotels and the best restaurants outside of Key 
West, make Islamorada an attractive final destination in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Pronounced EYE-la-mor-AH-da, this island group was named "Purple Isles" for the 
wild morning glories covering Upper Matecumbe Island, according to "Conch" 
(native) historian John Ovitt. 
</P>
<P>
"One story goes that the Spanish named the islands for violet snail shells on 
the beaches," he said, "but the area wasn't known as Islamorada until early in 
this century when the wife of an engineer constructing Flagler's Overseas 
Railroad admired the flowers." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Keys are no longer the pristine paradise that greeted 16th-Century 
Spanish explorers, or the sparsely populated islands that Henry Flagler and his 
railroaders encountered in 1905, the Islamorada area has many relatively 
unspoiled sites. 
</P>
<P>
Newest of the area's four state parks is the San Pedro Underwater Archeological 
Preserve, opened last year a mile south of Indian Key. Ovitt and others, 
working with the Florida Department of Natural Resources, have enhanced the 
site where the 287-ton, Dutch-built galleon San Pedro sank. They replaced the 
anchor, which had been removed years ago, and added cannon replicas cast from 
artillery on her sister ship San Jose, also sunk in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-one ships loaded with treasure left Havana on Friday the 13th in 1733," 
Ovitt says, "and only one survived a great hurricane. Eleven wrecks lie in our 
waters, but the San Pedro is the most interesting. The site is 18 feet deep and 
easy for snorkelers and divers to explore." Ovitt also says that night diving, 
here and at natural reefs, is becoming popular. "Many corals blossom at night 
and you can watch sleepy parrot fish." 
</P>
<P>
Ten-acre, uninhabited Indian Key, a mile off Lower Matecumbe, is rich in 
above-ground archeological sites such as circular cisterns and foundations. 
This tiny island is indebted for its colorful past to Capt. Jacob Housman, a 
famous "wrecker" who set up headquarters here in the 1830s. 
</P>
<P>
In deep water only four miles from Alligator Reef, Indian Key provided an ideal 
location for Housman to watch for the hundreds of ships being wrecked. Business 
was a resounding success, and he built Florida's first resort, the Tropical 
Hotel, with a bowling alley and billiard room. Indian Key became a busy port 
and the seat for Dade County in 1840. (The seat is now Miami.) 
</P>
<P>
The island attracted John James Audubon, who visited in 1832 and recorded birds 
he had never seen before, and Dr. Henry Perrine, a botanist who cultivated 
agave, tea, coffee and bananas. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Second Seminole War broke out in 1835, Chief Chekika heard Housman 
was negotiating with the government for a contract to kill Indians at $200 a 
head. The chief and a hundred warriors attacked the island in 1840, killing 
Perrine and forcing Housman to flee. 
</P>
<P>
On April 13 and 14, 1991, the 13th annual Indian Key Festival will re-enact the 
1840 attack with authentic costume, weapons, encampments and tours of the 
island. The defunct post office is even reactivated to issue first-day covers. 
</P>
<P>
The Park Service also offers a trip to Lignumvitae Key State Botanical Site, 
just opposite Indian Key on the bay side of Lower Matecumbe. This 280-acre 
island is a rare example of a virgin sub-tropical hardwood forest, once common 
in the Upper Keys. The 1919 coral-rock Matheson House, too, is unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday through Monday there are two-hour tours, in 24-passenger boats, of 
Indian Key and Lignumvitae Key. You must have reservations, and fees are $6 for 
adults and $3 for children under 12. 
</P>
<P>
For nature walks, visit Long Key State Recreational Area at MM 67.5 and see 
wading birds in the mangrove-lined lagoons and a vista of the tropical hardwood 
forest from an observation tower. One nature trail is called the Golden Orb, 
after the red and gold spider that weaves a huge web. There are ranger-led 
programs, picnicking and camping. Everyone tells you there's a beach at Long 
Key, but it's a very narrow strip of sand lined with Australian pines. 
</P>
<P>
For information on parks, tours and festivals, contact the Park Manager, c/o 
Long Key State Recreation Area, P.O. Box 776, Long Key, Fa. 33001, (305) 
664-4815. 
</P>
<P>
One of the Keys' tourist leaflets states, "The beaches here are distinctive." 
Yes, they are. Where they exist at all in the Upper Keys they are slim and 
rocky, with limestone sand laced with sharp coral. But you can't have 
everything, and the Keys' lack of beaches has surely cut down on exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
At MM 102.5 on Key Largo, not strictly in the Islamorada area but an easy 
drive, is the Keys' most popular attraction, John Pennekamp Coral Reef State 
Park. Park boats can take you diving or snorkeling, and the glass-bottomed 
"Discovery" makes the fairyland reef accessible to everyone. The nation's first 
underwater state park is very crowded on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Islamorada at Theater of the Sea (MM 84), the world's second oldest 
marine park, you can sail in a "bottomless" boat with a perimeter for 
passengers and a center for Atlantic bottlenose dolphins to jump into. The 
dolphin lagoon is an old excavation of the Overseas Railroad, which was pushed 
through to Key West in 1912 and destroyed by a hurricane in 1935 that also took 
423 lives. 
</P>
<P>
Theater of the Sea is big on audience participation, and small enough to make 
the fun feel personal. Children can perform with the seals and ride a boat 
towed by dolphins. Good swimmers 13 and up can swim with a dolphin for 30 
minutes for $65. 
</P>
<P>
Colorful jobs abound here. Four times a day employees step into a pool of nurse 
sharks, picking one up for visitors to "pet." In another pool, Mark Giro feeds 
giant stingrays as dozens of pelicans waddle noisily on shelter roofs and hover 
overhead, hoping for a free bite. 
</P>
<P>
"The most dangerous animals here are these pelicans," he says, as a big brown 
specimen divebombs him for a mouthful of fish intended for a turtle. 
</P>
<P>
The Islamorada Chamber of Commerce lists 41 hotels, motels, resorts and 
condominiums in the area. Nightly winter rates range from the Cheeca Lodge 
listed at $195 to $325 to the Key Lantern Motel at $37-$50. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from Key West, the Islamorada area has more good restaurants than any 
other area in the Keys. You'll find three things on every menu: conch fritters, 
key lime pie and dolphin. (Dolphin served as "catch of the day" is no relation 
to the porpoise you swam with. It's simply mahi-mahi.) 
</P>
<P>
A mermaid beckons you into Lorelei, MM82, where fishing guides, including those 
specializing in the back country, hang out. Lorelei is open from 7 a.m. until 
it closes. You can sit outside and be eyed by an egret studying your $5.25 Key 
Largo fish sandwich. The key lime pie served here with gobs of whipped cream is 
very good. 
</P>
<P>
After waiting for a table and glancing at the menu at popular Ziggie's Conch, 
MM83, you wonder what all the fuss is about. 
</P>
<P>
The uninspired bill of fare is straight out of the '50s, offering fried shrimp, 
fish du jour and advising "all entrees served with chopped lettuce salad." But 
then Ziggie stops by your table mumbling a long verbal menu, with specials like 
yellowtail served "rangoon" or delectable softshell crab, and on and on. 
</P>
<P>
Entrees run about $17, and the children's menu starts at $5.25 for a hamburger. 
Don't miss the conch fritter appetizer with a dip of soy, honey, mustard and a 
mystery ingredient. Ziggie says, "I was married once and I learned not to tell 
everything." He knows how to charge for a small slice of key lime pie at $3. 
</P>
<P>
Manny &amp; Isa's Kitchen, MM 81.6, may try your patience with its noisy, 
cramped dining room, but the Cuban specialties are worth it. For $6.75 you can 
have picadillo, a pork chop or palomilla steak with rice, black beans, salad 
and bread. Fish of the day goes for $12.95, or if you want to eat cheap for a 
week, invest $15 in a gallon of black bean soup to take back to your motel. 
Great key lime pie is a bargain at $1.95. 
</P>
<P>
The Green Turtle Inn, MM 81.3, one of the Keys' most famous and popular 
restaurants, has been in business since 1947 with walls covered by old 
newspapers and photos. But it's dark and too smoky, with a menu on the ordinary 
side. Full-course dinners featuring dolphin "a la Roxie" or alligator steak 
start at $14.50. Children can eat for $2.50, and key lime pie is $2.75. 
</P>
<P>
Marker 88, on Plantation Key, is reputed to be the best restaurant in the Keys. 
The menu is ambitious and extensive (ditto the wine list), with dishes like 
rice colonial Bombay and fish Algerian. As a change from fish, chef Andre 
Mueller includes a variety of steak and veal dishes from $16 and up, and a 
children's menu starts with spaghetti at $2.95 with fish, shrimp and scallops 
going for $8.45. The interior is slightly on the dreary side, but the food is 
very good. 
</P>
<P>
If you're on a budget or have to feed a group, consider the huge Coral Grill, 
MM 83.5, for a casual buffet with quantities of roast beef and steamed shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlantic's Edge Restaurant at the Cheeca Lodge serves a fine dinner in an 
elegant room with an ocean view. Families are welcomed, with reduced portions 
of many items half-price for children 12 and under, and the "fish you caught 
today" can be prepared for $14 per person. 
</P>
<P>
Conch fritters are great, if not cheap, served in a spicy tomato-basil sauce 
for $6. Fresh vegetables and herbs abound in dishes like broiled grouper with 
garlic and black bean sauce for $18, or steamed dolphin with tomatoes, fresh 
herbs and balsamic vinegar for $16.75. Lamb chops with fried zucchini spaghetti 
will run you $27, and out-pricing even Ziggie's, key lime pie is $4. 
</P>

CRUISE VIEWS: CONVENIENCE IS SOMETIMES FOREIGN ON VESSELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Here's a problem: If you live in San Diego and want to take a midweek cruise 
aboard the Azure Seas or the Southward, you can't just hop aboard the ships 
when they call in San Diego, no matter how convenient that might be. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, you will have to travel from San Diego to San Pedro's Port of Los 
Angeles and embark the ships there with the rest of the passengers. 
</P>
<P>
If you also have been thinking about sailing to Hawaii this winter with Royal 
Cruise Line or Holland America Line, you'll have to board a motor coach in San 
Diego and be driven to Ensenada, Mexico, to board your ship. 
</P>
<P>
Princess Cruises can take you to Hawaii, too, but only if you get on or off the 
ship in Vancouver, Canada, or Tahiti. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, if you've booked an Alaska cruise with Princess or Holland 
America, the two largest lines sailing there, you'll probably begin or end your 
cruise in Vancouver, even though you may have arrived there by motor coach from 
the Seattle-Tacoma Airport. 
</P>
<P>
What's going on here? 
</P>
<P>
In 1886, American legislators came up with the Passenger Service Act, which 
forbids foreign-flag vessels from picking up passengers in one U.S. port and 
dropping them off in another without calling at a foreign port in between. 
</P>
<P>
(Although the Passenger Service Act is often incorrectly referred to as the 
Jones Act, the latter is actually a similar set of laws protecting U.S. 
cabotage, or coastal cargo shipping.) 
</P>
<P>
While numerous efforts have been made over the years to repeal or amend the 
Passenger Service Act, U.S. labor unions and cargo ship owners, fearful that 
any changes could undermine the act itself, have been successful in quashing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
At present, there are only two large ocean-going, U.S.-flag cruise ships -- 
American Hawaii Cruises' Constitution and Independence, each carrying about 775 
passengers. Both are based in Honolulu for seven-day cruises around the 
islands. 
</P>
<P>
The other major U.S.-flag companies are Clipper Cruises, which operates two 
small ships in and around North, Central and South America; the Delta Queen 
Steamboat Co., with two paddle-wheel steamers on the Mississippi River and its 
tributaries, and American Canadian Caribbean Line, which runs two small ships 
in the Caribbean in winter, then Canada and the Northeast United States in 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
For a ship to qualify as "U.S.-flag," it must have been built and registered in 
the United States, be staffed by a predominantly American crew, and must never 
have been re-flagged to another country. 
</P>
<P>
An exception was made in the case of American Hawaii's Independence, where a 
special bill enacted by Congress in 1979 allowed the decommissioned vessel -- 
then under Panamanian registry -- to regain its U.S.-flag status. 
</P>
<P>
Many cruise ships presently serving the American market are registered under 
so-called "flags of convenience" in countries such as Panama, Liberia and the 
Bahamas, where taxation is lower and there are fewer restrictions on wages and 
hiring. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign-flag ships that want to offer seasonal sailings across the Pacific to 
Hawaii have used some ingenuity in putting their passengers aboard, usually by 
beginning or ending their sailings in a foreign port such as Ensenada. 
</P>
<P>
At San Francisco-based Royal Cruise Line, a spokeswoman said that many of their 
passengers book the Hawaii cruise more for the five-day ocean crossing than for 
the sail around the islands. 
</P>
<P>
Not since U.S.-flag Matson Lines went out of the passenger business in the 
early 1970s has there been regularly scheduled transpacific service by U.S. 
ships. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, most Alaska cruises begin in Canada rather than the U.S. mainland or 
Alaskan ports. 
</P>
<P>
At the American Society of Travel Agents World Travel Congress in Hamburg, 
Germany, last month, Holland America Line President A. K. (Kirk) Lanterman 
said: "A recent economic study about the port of Vancouver shows they get $225 
million a year profit from home-basing cruise ships during the summer season, 
and 1,250 year-round jobs are based on this business." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, West Coast ports would like to share in this revenue. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco and Seattle, according to Lanterman, are actively lobbying for 
legislation to allow one-way passages to Alaska on an exemption basis, similar 
to that given to Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
But for the 1991 Alaska season, only one ship -- Princess' Liberian-registered, 
1,212-passenger Sky Princess -- will make regular 10-day sailings from San 
Francisco to Alaska, calling in Victoria and Vancouver to meet the Passenger 
Service Act requirement. 
</P>
<P>
And the 82-passenger, U.S.-flag Spirit of Alaska (the former Pacific Northwest 
Explorer from now-defunct Exploration Cruise Lines) is the only cruise ship 
scheduled to sail from Seattle to Alaska weekly throughout the season. It will 
be operated by Alaska Sightseeing Tours/TravAlaska. 
</P>
<P>
Most experts don't see any new U.S.-flag ships on the horizon, despite a weaker 
dollar that has made shipyard refurbishment bids attractively low to 
foreign-flag vessels. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Caribbean Cruise Line's Los Angeles-based Viking Serenade, for example, 
will undergo a $75-million renovation at San Diego's Southwest Marine shipyard 
early next year, and Holland America's Rotterdam underwent a $15-million 
refurbishment in the fall of 1989 at Northwest Marine Ironworks in Portland.

HER WORLD: WHAT'S INN IS SOLITUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MORGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wilmington -- and most of Delaware -- had been left behind as my husband and I 
drove north toward Pennsylvania that night. Our destination was Mendenhall, 
Pa., a hamlet near the state line where we had a reservation. 
</P>
<P>
A cashier at a gasoline station looked blank when we asked directions. But a 
customer heard our query and said: "Follow me. I can save you 10 miles." 
</P>
<P>
He left the bright highway and cut west on a curving, pitch-black lane. There 
was no moon; only his headlights and ours punched holes in the dark and struck 
at the trunks of old trees. The wind began howling. The road dipped downward, 
as steep as a toboggan run. 
</P>
<P>
No signs appeared, either for speed or direction. No mail boxes hinted of 
habitation. As we raced after the stranger, I remembered that Edgar Allan Poe 
wrote some of his horrific tales while living in Pennsylvania. Had he known 
these woods? 
</P>
<P>
Finally we came to an intersection. It was Route 52. The local driver rolled 
down his window. I cracked mine an inch. 
</P>
<P>
"Sorry if it was scary," he called, "but it does save time. I turn left here. 
You turn right." With a wave he disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Three miles beyond, we came to our destination: the Fairville Inn. It was after 
9 p.m., but a porch light was on. The man at the desk of the 1820s house was 
kind. He showed us to a parlor with a glowing fire and offered cinnamon tea and 
homemade cookies. Life, once again, seemed cozy. 
</P>
<P>
Our room (No. 3) was in the former carriage house, with a fireplace, cathedral 
ceiling and high-paned windows. The English country look of Laura Ashley was 
apparent in lace-trimmed pillow covers, a snow-white comforter and a billowy 
peach canopy over the queen-size bed. 
</P>
<P>
With dawn we peeked out at the rolling fields, woods and ponds of this land 
that could be Sussex. We went for a walk before breakfast, passing white board 
fences and pastures of sleek horses. 
</P>
<P>
That morning we met Rita Martelli, a cheery woman who bakes for the inn. She 
was responsible for the pumpkin and lemon bars, the moist macaroons and crunchy 
chocolate-chip cookies that had been served to us at bedtime. 
</P>
<P>
The Fairville Inn is certifiably romantic, a bed and breakfast establishment 
that welcomes you warmly and then leaves you alone -- no forced togetherness, 
no family tables, no hovering. 
</P>
<P>
Its location on Route 52 is convenient for touring a number of area 
attractions, including: the 350-acre Longwood Gardens, at the former country 
estate of Pierre S. duPont, near Kennett Square, Pa.; the 200-room American 
furniture collection at the Winterthur estate of Henry Francis duPont, and the 
Wyeth family art -- as well as other American masters -- at the Brandywine 
River Museum in Chadds Ford. 
</P>
<P>
Another winsome hideaway in Pennsylvania is Highland Farms, near Doylestown in 
Bucks County. This three-story, 18th-Century home was the country estate of the 
Broadway lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II. In its parlor, he wrote the memorable 
songs for "Oklahoma!," "Carousel," "The King and I," "South Pacific" and "The 
Sound of Music." 
</P>
<P>
I drove up the farm lane at 70 East Road and innkeeper Mary Schnitzer came to 
the door. She wore a powder-blue warm-up suit and was in her stocking feet. 
</P>
<P>
"Welcome," she said with a grin. "It's crazy this morning. As soon as our last 
guest checked out, we began stripping the music room floor." 
</P>
<P>
Schnitzer and her husband, John, bought Highland Farms four years ago, filled 
it with Hammerstein memorabilia and opened it for bed and breakfast. They are 
still refurbishing the last of the eight bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Sondheim has been a guest, and James Michener -- whogrew up in 
Doylestown -- has stayed in the suite named South Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the dove-gray house, with its white pillars and black shutters, is a 
grape arbor (where, they say, Henry Fonda was married) and a pen of sheep (who, 
reportedly, have come to like beer and pretzels). A tennis court and swimming 
pool are artfully hidden on five tidy acres. 
</P>
<P>
My only disappointment with Highland Farms was the fact that I discovered it on 
the morning that I had to leave Bucks County for New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Worse, it was the morning after I had stayed -- in tired desperation -- at the 
Courthouse Motel in Doylestown, the only vacancy sign in town. 
</P>
<P>
I slept restlessly and with good reason -- the room was not clean, the air 
conditioning was noisy, the lights of the Coca-Cola machine shone through the 
window, and a woman yelled "rape!" in the night, then burst into laughter as 
footsteps pounded by our door. 
</P>
<P>
It was a far cry from the old sweet songs of Rodgers and Hammerstein. 
</P>
<P>

(215) 388-5900; Highland Farms, 70 East Road, Doylestown, Pa. 18901, (215)

Getting there: We traveled to Kenya independently, although many safari tour 
operators can arrange package trips in luxury accommodations such as the ones 
we experienced. We flew to Nairobi via Amsterdam (there are no direct flights 
from the United States); it's about $2,000 round trip per person. 
</P>
<P>
Our safari arrangements were booked through Kenyan friends by Rhino Safaris: 
Box 48023, Nairobi, local telephone 28102. Total cost of our trip (excluding 
Amsterdam stopover) was approximately $8,500 for 15 days, including air fare.

TIPS FROM AN AUSSIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My wife and I have been holidaying for three months in your wonderful country 
of many contrasts, interests, awe-inspiring Grand Canyon and other fascinating 
places too numerous to mention. But on leaving for home, I feel I must comment 
on this outrageous system of tipping. 
</P>
<P>
It may be your custom, but I accept it with a certain amount of grumbling. To 
be confronted with this distasteful demand openly by notices in taxis, 
restaurants and other places is embarrassing, humiliating and completely 
bewildering to the average Aussie. 
</P>
<P>
We do tip in our country, of course, but the service has to be exceptional and 
then only on a voluntary basis. To us, it is an abominable practice that should 
be debated. Is it worthwhile or should the employers make up the difference in 
paychecks? 
</P>
<P>
Last but not least, I must comment on the American people -- the people who 
helped us find our way when lost while driving or walking. We were greeted 
cordially with an open friendliness that was at times completely disarming. My 
wife and I thank you all for allowing us the privilege of wandering all over 
your beautiful country and finding the average American to be the Eighth Wonder 
of the World.

KAHANE: THE NIGHTMARE THAT LIBERAL IDEOLOGUES COULD NOT IMAGINE; 
</P>
<P>
ISRAEL: THE SLAIN RABBI BELIEVED HE REPRESENTED MAINSTREAM JUDAISM AND WAS ON 
HIS WAY TO POWER. IN FACT, HE HELPED BRUTALIZE A NATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ehud Sprinzak, Ehud Sprinzak, a Hebrew University professor, is currently 
the Aaron Goldman visiting professor of government at Georgetown University. 
His book, The Ascendance of the Israeli Radical Right, will be published early 
next year by Oxford University Press.

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I recently asked Rabbi Meir Kahane who his model in Jewish history was. I 
expected him to name one of the eccentric Jewish rebel-heroes -- Judah 
Maccabee, who defeated the Hellenists after persistent desecrations of the 
Temple Mount, or Shimon Bar-Kochba, who rebelled against the Romans 60 years 
after the destruction of the second Temple. 
</P>
<P>
To my great surprise, Kahane responded: "I belong to mainstream Judaism, a line 
that begins with Abraham, our forefather, and goes through the great Hallakhic 
Sages of Diaspora. But if I have to chose a single individual I identify with 
most, I'd say King David. It was said of King David that he studied every 
night, and in the morning he would wake up and make war." 
</P>
<P>
Kahane, assassinated in a New York hotel last Monday, truly believed that he 
represented mainstream Judaism. Because of sensitivity to his militancy, the 
rabbi wanted people to know that he was also a scholar and that, under certain 
circumstances, he could be as prominent as King David. Kahane never perceived 
himself to be a radical fundamentalist and thus was certain that the rest of 
the world had wrongly perceived him. He was equally certain that his message 
was the most important thing that had happened to Jews in the last quarter of 
the 20th Century. His rise to power in Israel, Kahane believed, was just a 
matter of time. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Kahane never represented mainstream Judaism and was a colossal 
political failure. Twenty-two years after launching the Jewish Defense League 
in New York City and 19 years after moving it to Israel, he was still the head 
of a fringe protest movement. His party, Kach (Thus!), was a politically 
organized right-wing backlash. He was never in a position to influence 
government policy and was barely able to rally more than a few hundred 
demonstrators. Even Kach's sole attempt to establish a settlement in the West 
Bank, considered the mark of success by the Israeli right, failed miserably. 
</P>
<P>
Kahane ran his movement in a very personal way. He raised its money, wrote its 
pamphlets and made all its important decisions. Never capable of or interested 
in allowing other leaders to grow and take responsibility, Kahane was, in fact, 
running a one-man show built on emotions, anti-Arab hate and his charisma. 
Israel's Supreme Court decision, in 1988, to disqualify Kach from participating 
in the electoral process, due to its racism and anti-democratic stand, proved 
that Kahane's political formula could not work in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than political, Kahane's long-term success was cultural. The Israel to 
which he emigrated in 1971 had its problems and was never a model democracy. 
But certain ideas were anathema. Violence against civilians was considered an 
un-Israeli act, as was the idea of a mass expulsion of Arabs. Political 
hooliganism in the streets was considered repugnant, and nobody, not even the 
worst enemy, was collectively referred to as "dogs" or "animals." An orthodox 
rabbi expressing these ideas from the pulpit was a nightmare that even the 
nation's leading liberal ideologues could not have possibly imagined. 
</P>
<P>
The Israel that Kahane has left as a legacy is far different. It is still 
democratic, open and free. It is also brutal and violent. Its schools, 
universities, military camps, markets and synagogues are increasingly filled 
with populist chauvinism and crude anti-alien sentiment. Most noticeable are 
neo-religious ideas about redemption, the expurgation of the Temple Mount, the 
indivisibility of the Land of Israel and the necessity to transfer the Arabs 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Kahane should by no means be held responsible for all these ills. The Jewish 
state has come a long way since the early 1970s, shaped, in part, by the 
necessity to carry on in a world full of Arab terrorists. But not a single 
Israeli I know has made a greater contribution to the brutalization of the 
nation and its public spirit than did Kahane. What was especially different 
about the rabbi from Brooklyn was his conscious theological and educational 
effort to destroy the mechanisms of Jewish moral engagement among his 
followers, an effort unfortunately crowned with great success. 
</P>
<P>
The most destructive element in Kahane's teaching was not his call for the 
eviction of all Arabs from Israel, but his theology of Jewish violence. This 
theology was first developed in America, without reference to the Arabs. When 
completed in Israel, it included the Arabs. Its essence was that "a Jewish fist 
in the face of a Gentile is Kiddush Hashem" (the sanctification of the name of 
God). When asked by a journalist whether he would be willing to instruct his 
followers not to hit innocent Arabs who just happened to be near a terrorist 
incident, Kahane responded: "No. . . . As long as they are here, we are lost." 
</P>
<P>
Kahane helped many Israelis, most of whom would never have voted for him, to 
overcome their guilt feelings. He facilitated the expression of anti-Arab 
hostility into intentional violence, making it glatt Kosher. By doing so, he 
forced several respectable Israeli political parties to radicalize their 
platforms. 
</P>
<P>
While the long-range effects of the Kahane teaching are far from over, the 
political demise of Kach is almost certain to take place with his death. It is 
just a question of time before its Jerusalem offices are closed, due to lack of 
funds, and its remaining activists start looking for a new political home. This 
development, though fortunate, will probably not occur before a few tumultuous 
waves of anti-Arab violence further shake the precarious relations between Jews 
and Arabs in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Kahane's followers are seeking revenge and make no secret about it. They never 
did. For years, they were told by their rabbi that "Jewish violence in the 
service of Jewish interests is never bad," emphasizing the sacredness of 
lashing out in "Kiddush Hashem." Now, with the assassination of their leader, 
they have all the reason in the world to seek bloody revenge. The only pending 
question is how massive it will be and how effectively the Israeli police will 
contain it. Given the police's performance in the Temple Mount fiasco, and its 
inability to fire the officers responsible, hopes should not run high. The 
introduction of a new dimension of Kach violence, including the assassination 
of high-ranking Palestinians, cannot be excluded. 
</P>
<P>
While Kahane's murder is unlikely to significantly affect Israeli-U.S. 
relations or hurt American Jews, some repercussions on Arab-Jewish relations in 
the United States should be expected. A small Kahane group, JDL International, 
is reported to have played a role in several recent terrorist operations 
against Arabs and former Nazis living in the United States. The FBI believes 
that Kahane followers were responsible for the 1985 killing of Alex Odeh, a 
leading Arab activist in Los Angeles. Deeply wounded by the slaying of their 
leader, these individuals may be expected to strike, thereby extending the 
Middle East conflict to America. 
</P>
<P>
The brutal assassination of Kahane could perhaps have served a noble purpose if 
Israelis and Palestinians were able to reason together, and recognize the 
tragedy of the unending cycle of violence. Unfortunately, the likelihood of 
such a development is very low. Even the most optimistic observer should 
recognize today that matters will get much worse before they get better.

BUSH: CAN HE BE MEAN AND KIND IN '92? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By William Schneider, William Schneider is a contributing editor to Opinion.

<TEXT>
<P>
The 1990 election was a warning. The "ins" are in trouble. That could be a 
problem for George Bush. As President of the United States, he is the nation's 
ultimate "in." 
</P>
<P>
Republicans, of course, don't see things that way. They think they got through 
the 1990 election relatively unscathed. After all, if you look at the election 
in partisan terms, it was a wash. The Democrats ended up gaining only one 
Senate seat and nine (out of 435) in the House. When all the shouting was over, 
neither party came out ahead in the elections for governor. No big deal. 
</P>
<P>
Except that you shouldn't look at the 1990 election in partisan terms. The 
message from the voters this year was thoroughly nonpartisan: You're all a 
bunch of goof-ups, and we're getting sick and tired of it. You stand warned. 
</P>
<P>
At least members of Congress were lucky. They got by with a warning. Only one 
incumbent senator and 15 incumbent House members were defeated on Tuesday. But 
those who got reelected found they were winning with sharply diminished 
majorities. "If congressional incumbents read their reelections as a vote for 
the status quo, they'll be sadly mistaken," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic 
pollster. "This was a year when it wouldn't have taken much to tip the scales." 
</P>
<P>
Governors weren't so lucky. They got it in the neck. A quarter of the incumbent 
governors running for reelection were defeated. In 14 out of the 36 states with 
elections for governor, the party in power was thrown out. As it happens, the 
Democrats were ousted in seven states and the Republicans lost the other seven. 
So in partisan terms, it was a draw. But that doesn't mean nothing happened. 
</P>
<P>
Governors seemed to pay the price for a bad economy. In states that threw the 
governing party out of office, an average of two-thirds of the voters said 
their state's economy was in bad shape. 
</P>
<P>
Why did the voters take it out on governors and let members of Congress off 
with a warning? Apparently because they believe governors run things. All 
legislators do is make speeches and vote. 
</P>
<P>
Why is this bad news for Bush? For two reasons. More than three-quarters of the 
voters across the country said the national economy was in bad shape. And Bush 
is not the nation's legislator. He is the nation's governor. 
</P>
<P>
There was a big market for outsiders in this year's election. Independents got 
elected governor in Connecticut and Alaska. A Socialist got elected to Congress 
from Vermont, that citadel of the oppressed industrial proletariat. The loony 
left elected a new senator from Minnesota. The loony right reelected Jesse 
Helms in North Carolina. Connecticut voters sent a staunchly conservative black 
Republican to Congress. Insiders like House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt 
(D-Mo.) and House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) saw their victory margins 
dramatically shaved. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the voters had to draw the line somewhere. They drew it in Texas and 
Massachusetts -- where gubernatorial candidates Clayton Williams, a Republican, 
and John Silber, a Democrat, proved that if you try hard enough, you can talk 
yourself out of a victory. Texans decided they didn't want to be governed by 
Wild Bill Hickok, and Massachusetts voters couldn't bring themselves to elect 
Capt. Queeg. 
</P>
<P>
To underscore their disgust with insiders, the voters passed initiatives 
setting term limits everywhere they were on the ballot, including California. 
In a desperate move to dislodge entrenched Democratic incumbents, Republicans 
are all set to lead a nationwide crusade for term limits. But this is not 
necessarily good news for Bush. As someone who has held virtually every top job 
in Washington, Bush is the Chief Insider in U.S. politics. 
</P>
<P>
Three governors who pledged not to raise taxes and then broke that pledge were 
defeated on Tuesday. Voters all over the country rejected measures that would 
have raised taxes, increased spending or added to bond indebtedness. For 
example, California voters rejected a major environmental initiative, two 
liquor-tax hikes and 12 of 14 bond issues. New York voters turned down a 
$1.9-billion environmental bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
The voters sent a clear message on taxes: No. "I got the message," said Gov. 
James J. Florio of New Jersey, whose unpopular tax program very nearly brought 
down Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) last week. Florio said his entire legislative 
program was open to revision. Bush got the message, too. He said on Thursday 
that he had "serious regrets" about "being forced" to abandon his no-new-taxes 
pledge, and he promised not to do it again. "You know, sometimes you run into 
some realities," Bush said. "But I'm girding up my loins to go into battle to 
beat back the tax attempts that I think are coming." 
</P>
<P>
The President better gird up real good because if his popularity continues to 
decline, he could face a tax revolt within his own party. House Republicans 
have already defied him on the budget. Conservatives may decide to challenge 
him in the 1992 Republican primaries. They can't deny Bush renomination. They 
just want to carry a message to the Republican convention that the party must 
reaffirm its anti-tax position. 
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. Supreme Court overturns its Roe vs. Wade decision protecting 
abortion rights, Bush is also likely to face a challenge from GOP moderates in 
1992. They can't deny Bush renomination. They just want to carry a message to 
the Republican convention that the party must change its stand on abortion 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
One thing we know in politics is that an incumbent who faces a serious 
challenge for renomination in his own party is in trouble. Gerald R. Ford had 
that problem in 1976. Jimmy Carter had that problem in 1980. Bush doesn't need 
that problem in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The President has to decide which way he wants the GOP to go. Two kinds of 
Republicans did well last week. Conservatives like Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, 
Gov. Guy Hunt of Alabama, Sen. Strom Thurmond and Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. 
of South Carolina and Helms of North Carolina got re-elected. In addition, 
conservative Republicans won Senate seats in New Hampshire, Colorado and Idaho. 
They are the meaner, tougher Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
But a whole new class of moderate Republicans got elected governor this year: 
Pete Wilson in California, Jim Edgar in Illinois, William Weld in Massachusetts 
and Arne Carlson in Minnesota. All are pragmatic and pro-choice. They are the 
kinder, gentler wing of the party. 
</P>
<P>
Which side is Bush on? When he campaigns, he tries to be meaner, tougher. When 
he governs, he tries to be kinder, gentler. This balancing act cannot continue. 
To paraphrase an old Yiddish saying, his behind is not so big that he can sit 
on both sides of the fence at once.

POLITICAL FORECAST; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: DID CALIFORNIA START SOMETHING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA REYNOLDS, Forecast interviews were conducted by Maura Reynolds, a 
staff writer in The Times' Washington bureau. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California voters began the tax revolt when they passed Proposition 13 in 1978. 
The Times asked ten political observers: Will the results of the 1990 
California election again influence political debate in national and state 
elections in the next few years? Why? 
</P>
<P>
Norman Ornstein,senior fellow, American Enterprise Institute: 
</P>
<P>
Is California a harbinger of things to come? In this election, we saw a 
reflection of politics as they are being played nationwide as much as 
leadership in trends. 
</P>
<P>
But California's politics this time will still have a profound impact on the 
nation's politics in 1992. Money was a factor everywhere in 1990, but no place 
more so than in California. And we ain't seen nothin' yet. Sen. Pete Wilson's 
gubernatorial victory means two Golden State Senate seats will be up that year. 
Add to that seven new House seats, massive redistricting of state legislative 
and congressional districts, turmoil caused by term limits and many Assembly 
and state Senate members having to run for other offices, a more significant 
presidential primary, and 33 other U.S. Senate seats up -- and the demand for 
money in politics will be far more intense than usual. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians everywhere will be obsessed with money in 1992, and especially with 
money from California. They'd better hope the California economy is strong. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Schroeder,member of Congress (D-Colo.): 
</P>
<P>
What I saw coming out of California looked schizophrenic: On the one side, the 
same anger with government and incumbents that we saw in Colorado, and on the 
other side, voters reverted to the biggest incumbent -- Wilson -- the person 
most familiar, like an old bedroom slipper. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe this is an election in which for the first time other states might have 
led the way. To see Ann Richards beat the quintessential cowboy down in 
Marlboro country, to see a woman win in the Kansas heartland, to see someone 
win in Florida who wouldn't accept more than $100 from anybody and no 
political-action-committee money -- I think California has lost its edge. To 
find the direction the political wind is blowing, now you'd want to look to 
Florida, Minnesota and Texas for the kind of populist campaigns that were run 
in those places. 
</P>
<P>
Edward J. Rollins,co-chairman, National Republican Campaign Committee: 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's election results in California sent a strong message to the rest of 
the nation that unless government is more responsive to the needs and concerns 
of the people, it will be changed. 
</P>
<P>
The approval of term limitations for California legislators is an issue that 
was closely watched by the entire nation. By overwhelmingly approving 
Proposition 140, California will be the standard to which other states, 
including the federal government, will look on the issue of limitation of 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
California also reaffirmed its strong anti-tax stand. Both through ballot 
initiatives and the victories of candidates opposed to increased taxes, the 
California message is clear. Tax is controversial at all levels of government 
and will continue to be debated by all political parties into the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Hal Bruno,senior political analyst, ABC News: 
</P>
<P>
 On a few things, California will have influence. Certainly, term limitations 
are going to catch on, even though there was no sign of anti-incumbent fever. 
But other results -- the environmental initiatives, the alcohol tax -- were so 
peculiarly California that I'm not sure that the rest of the country will pick 
up on them. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, when California passed the referendum to build more highways, some 
people jumped to the conclusion that the anti-tax fever that had begun with 
Proposition 13 was starting to wind down. That certainly is not true. If 
anything, the anti-tax fever that began in California a dozen years ago is 
stronger than ever. 
</P>
<P>
Peter H. Hart,Democratic pollster and political consultant: 
</P>
<P>
If 1978 sent a message about how we were going to deal with fiscal matters in 
the 1980s, then California in 1990 is sending a similar message to the rest of 
the nation in terms of incumbency, term limitations and how we view our 
representation in government. There is a new expection and a new set of 
relationships between the people and those representing them in Washington, and 
in that I see California as very much a trend state. 
</P>
<P>
But on the environment, we would make a major mistake to conclude that 
Americans are rethinking their commitment to environmental protection. There is 
too much other evidence to the contrary. Based on the polling data I have seen, 
California is still a state that is willing to invest in itself. I honestly 
believe that, at the end of the 1990s, the entire country is going to be much 
more demanding about improving our environment. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Carlson,regional program coordinator, National Audubon Society: 
</P>
<P>
 It is clear that the economic downturn was a major determining factor in the 
defeat of Big Green and Forests Forever. This is not a hopeful trend for 
Audubon as we look to funding other critically needed environmental programs. 
</P>
<P>
One problem with Big Green . . . is that (it) ended up being quite expensive. 
To address this problem over the next few years, we will be looking to define 
legislation more specifically and designing appropriate payment schemes. But 
volunteer activism is clearly on the rise. This is a phenomenon we expect to 
see increase as environmental challenges grow and money is less and less 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas E. Mann,director of governmental studies, the Brookings Institution: 
</P>
<P>
I see California leading the way toward moderation and away from ideological 
politics. For instance, the Big Green initiative was framed in too extreme a 
fashion, and people rebelled. 
</P>
<P>
The parties are moving toward the center -- sensitive to contemporary concerns 
such as the environment and abortion, but at the same time trying to respond to 
the anxieties of middle-class Americans about the economic pinch. But most of 
all, I think there is a realization that we have a whole host of problems to 
deal with on the domestic front, and the old, ideological slogans aren't going 
to solve them. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, this election may portend a retreat from California's excesses with 
direct democracy. California started the movement, and maybe this resistance to 
ballot initiatives will slow their use around the country. It may even begin a 
slow process of revitalizing representative, republican government. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald H. Brown,chairman, Democratic National Committee: 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last decade, California has had a strong influence on national 
politics because of its population growth and diversity of its people and 
industry. The trend will continue. The state has always been on the cusp of 
change -- we've seen it in its candidates this year and in referenda like Big 
Green and term limits. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Dianne Feinstein's loss . . .the Democratic message was heard 
nationwide (as) Wilson adopted progressive Democratic positions on child care 
and choice in order to squeak out a tight win. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Cummings,political director, Republican National Committee: 
</P>
<P>
I don't think there was any major trend coming out of any of the elections this 
cycle with one possible exception -- the term-limitation issue. That will 
continue to be an issue in states that have the option of putting an initiative 
on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
We saw a lot of governors' seats change party control this cycle, but 
California was conspicuous by retaining Republican control. From our party's 
perspective, that speaks well both for our prospects within the state as well 
as retaining the White House for years to come. It also speaks to the 
saleability of the Republican message that Wilson articulated -- one of 
innovative, conservative leadership, fiscal prudence and an opportunity for all 
segments of society based on a climate of economic growth. The state of the 
economy and economic growth are always first and foremost in the public's mind. 
I expect to see a lot of innovative ideas and solutions coming out of the 
Wilson administration, ideas that will ensure California's bellwether status.

<P>
The Communists have fallen from power in Poland, but the Poles have not lost 
their talent for bitter political humor. One joke making the rounds says that 
there are two solutions to the Polish economic crisis: one miraculous, one 
political. One solution would have the Archangel Michael appear over the center 
of Warsaw at the head of the millions of angels in the heavenly host. The 
angels sweep through every corner of the realm, renewing the infrastructure, 
paying the foreign debt and cleaning up the environment. That, say the Poles, 
is the political solution. And the miraculous way out? The Poles put their 
differences behind them and get down to work. 
</P>
<P>
Under communism, the Poles had money, but there was nothing to buy. A year of 
market reforms has produced just the opposite condition: There is plenty to buy 
-- oranges and bananas can be found in even the remotest of hamlets -- but most 
Poles have no money. With wages at about $50 per month, and prices for most 
goods at world levels or moving rapidly up, many Poles are unable to do more 
than press their noses against shop windows glittering with long-dreamed-of 
consumer goods from the West. 
</P>
<P>
The Poles had expected economic problems with the transition from communism -- 
not quite as many problems as they are having, perhaps, but the economic bad 
news is not so surprising. More troubling to many Poles -- who lack experience 
with the normal rough-and-tumble of democratic politics -- is the split between 
the leaders of Solidarity. With Lech Walesa fighting for the presidency against 
the man he himself appointed to mastermind Poland's transition to freedom, 
Poles must choose between rival tendencies in the Solidarity movement. 
</P>
<P>
There are, says one Polish journalist, two kinds of politics: salami and 
Salome. Salami politics is about raising standards of living: a chicken in 
every pot. Salome politics takes its name from the Biblical dancing girl who, 
given the choice of any gift in the kingdom, insisted on the head of John the 
Baptist on a platter. This is a politics of scapegoats and symbolism, and it is 
looming larger and larger on the Polish horizon. 
</P>
<P>
The reason? There just isn't much salami to distribute -- and some of the 
biggest victims of Polish austerity were the strongest supporters of the 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Take Poland's farmers. The 2.2 million independent small farmers of Poland 
fought off the Communists for years, but market reforms spelled their doom. 
Tiny Polish plots tilled by horses and donkeys can't compete with the 
agro-industrial complexes of the capitalist West. In the long run, reform 
should make Polish agriculture more efficient and enrich the small number of 
canny farmers who manage the transition. But that's the long run -- Poland's 
farmers are hurting now. 
</P>
<P>
The same goes for the industrial workers, backbone of the Solidarity movement. 
So far, capitalism has meant wage cuts and unemployment for Poland's workers. 
The economic benefits remain far in the nebulous future. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, farmers and workers are rallying to Walesa's attacks on the 
government's program of reform. Adding to the bitterness is the widespread 
evidence that the chief beneficiary of the revolution is the old nomenklatura. 
Who else, after all, has the money, the experience and, above all, the 
contacts, to prosper in an era of rapid change? 
</P>
<P>
Not only in Poland but throughout the East Bloc today, ordinary people suspect 
that the old nomenklatura is using its enormous resources of networking, 
trickery and chicanery to get control of state enterprises under favorable 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
These suspicions are well-founded. Throughout the region the old elites are 
working overtime to use their experience in dealing with government 
bureaucrats, their knowledge of the enterprises under their control and the 
financial resources they amassed under the old regimes to feather their nests 
in the new. 
</P>
<P>
Some of this is inevitable, and is even beneficial. Who, after all, is in a 
better position to value or manage these enterprises than those now running 
them? On the other hand, to many in Poland this looks like Communist injustice 
under a new name: Stir the pot all you want, but the same scum rises to the 
top. And there's worse to come. Poland's economy faces new shocks in January, 
when it must pay world prices -- in dollars -- for Soviet oil. More bad news: 
The Soviet Union is Poland's largest customer by far, and the accelerating 
disintegration of its economy will reduce Poland's export potential. 
</P>
<P>
The salami shortage is increasingly bad; Salome is waiting in the wings. 
Poland's government -- widely believed to be staffed by such unpopular types as 
liberals, Freemasons, ex-Communists, homosexuals and Jews -- offers many 
targets for the politics of scapegoating. 
</P>
<P>
Poles don't like understatement; some worried intellectuals speak of "Weimar 
Poland" -- of a situation reminiscent of Germany before the rise of Hitler. 
That is too dark by far; Poland is no Nazi Germany, and Walesa, its most 
populist politician, is no anti-Semite. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Polish anti-Semitism has a long and deep history, and if Salome politics 
take over, some of the heads on some of the platters will be Jewish. Fifty 
years after the massacre of Poland's Jews, anti-Semitism remains widespread. 
Groups of Israeli schoolchildren visiting the memorial to the Warsaw ghetto 
have been heckled in the streets. Some Poles, with an air of repeating 
scandalous gossip, name names of "hidden" Jews in the government, the media or 
among their own friends. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa, the favored candidate in the coming presidential election, probably 
wants, like most politicians, to govern by salami methods -- but that option is 
closed in Poland today. In interviews and statements during the summer, Walesa 
called for symbolic steps such as accelerated dismissals of government workers 
with a Communist past to satisfy a restless population. The question now is how 
far Walesa, or anyone else trying to govern Poland under these trying 
conditions, must go down this dangerous, unappealing road. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all its problems, Poland remains in better shape than many of its 
neighbors. If Walesa strikes some as a dangerous demagogue, he is also a 
convinced anti-Communist who looks westward for ideas and values. Other Eastern 
countries such as Romania and Bulgaria have no anti-Communist populists of his 
stature. In those countries, the reformers are even more isolated, and the 
overall outlook remains, at best, bleak. 
</P>
<P>
Poland's democratic leaders have won the easy battles. They've driven the 
Communists from power. Now they must fight the much harder war against 
backwardness, poverty and the devastating legacy of Bolshevik misrule. In this 
war they will need all the help they can get -- from St. Michael, the angels 
and everybody else.

I cannot let this moment slip by. I must repond to Roberts statement " . . . 
the Democrats are hoping to engineer a crushing recession that the liberal

<P>
Why doesn't Roberts put the blame where it fits? The Republicans, including 
Neil Bush, made their mark on bringing about the recession.

Please, Prof. Roberts, don't give all of the credit to the Democrats for the

NEA GUIDELINES FOR ARTISTS

I have a solution to the brouhaha surrounding the NEA that may satisfy all 
parties concerned. Instead of funding the NEA from the federal budget, why not 
have a box to check on the 1040 tax form that indicates that the taxpayer 
wishes to contribute, say, $5 to that agency? That way no one could maintain 
that he is being forced to pay artists to spit in his face and the federal 
government would still be promoting "artistic freedom."

The unthinkable has happened. After years of becoming almost apoplectic at the 
very mention of Paul Conrad's name, I found myself in complete agreement with 
his Nov. 4 cartoon depicting the California ballot as a lottery ticket. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, the cartoon was too restrained. The ballot was worse than a 
lottery ticket; it was the quintessence of idiocy.

The school auditorium was old, shabby, poorly lit, cluttered with decrepit

Our bank in Westwood is beautiful. It's new, made of marble, its floors covered

NEA GUIDELINES FOR ARTISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was pleased to read that the National Endowment for the Arts voted down 
attempts by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) to impose new restrictions on the content 
of artistic work. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment by Helms that would have prohibited the NEA from funding work 
that depicts "in a particularly offensive way explicit sexual or excretory 
activities" is against the spirit of the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
God gave us the power to think for ourselves and the Constitution gave us the 
right to express those thoughts freely. Helms is trying to take those powers 
and rights away. The American system is based on each individual being able to 
decide what is right for himself, not a select few individuals forcing their 
beliefs on the rest of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
I hope the NEA has the good sense to eliminate the third part of Helms' bill 
that prohibits NEA support of work that "denigrates the objects or beliefs of 
the adherents of a particular religion." By doing this it will send a message 
to the Jesse Helmses of the world that they can't act as the moral guardians of 
America. Helms cannot decide what is offensive to a whole nation. He only knows 
what is offensive to himself, and what is offensive to him might be considered 
great art by someone else.

WHY CALIFORNIA IS SMOKING LESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Smoking, says state Health Director Kenneth W. Kizer, costs the citizens of 
California more than $7.1 billion a year in health care and lost productivity. 
The state's anti-smoking advertising and education campaign, financed by the 
25-cent-a-pack cigarette tax approved by voters in 1988, costs only a fraction 
of that amount. 
</P>
<P>
There are impressive signs that the campaign is working. Kizer thinks that in 
the past 18 months Californians have quit smoking at about twice the previous 
rate. His guess is that there are about 750,000 fewer smokers in California 
than there were before the anti-smoking blitz began. 
</P>
<P>
Economics has no doubt played a part in cutting into the ranks of smokers. The 
rising cost of cigarettes has dissuaded a lot of would-be smokers from ever 
starting and persuaded a lot of smokers that their habit had become 
unaffordable. Kizer also credits the effectiveness of the anti-smoking ad 
campaign. A poll indicates that 75% of those who have seen the hard-hitting ads 
remember them, a very high rate of recall. 
</P>
<P>
Health officials estimate that 21% of Californians still smoke, down from 25% 
in 1988. The national average is 30%. There is an abundance of evidence linking 
smoking to a variety of chronic and fatal diseases. The fall-off in smoking 
means that hundreds of thousands of Californians can expect to lead healthier 
and more productive lives in the years and decades to come. Voter approval of 
Proposition 99 two years ago could turn out to be one of the more significant 
contributions to public health in recent years.

If the environmental movement is to succeed, it must become a truly bipartisan

The despicable manner in which Tom Hayden's past was manipulated by the hired

</P>
<P>
Speaking as a supporter of the environmental causes that Hayden has espoused, I 
would respectfully suggest that his continued public involvement with these 
issues is counterproductive. The fight should continue for the survival of the

THE BOTTOM LINE

By MICHELE SMOLLAR, executive director of People Assisting the Homeless, runs 
two shelters and a transitional center on the Westside. She commented on the 
different situation of the homeless in her area: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nature of the homeless (problem) on the Westside is different than that on 
Skid Row. We have a lot of employable people. 
</P>
<P>
We also have a lot of people who are employed. But because of the housing 
costs, which are outrageous, they become homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The latest estimate shows about 10,000 homeless (people) on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
We also get a number of people who come in from other sections because it's 
nicer to be homeless on the Westside. It's safer. The beaches are here. There's 
a whole different mentality than there is on Skid Row, an yet there are very 
limited services, because, people don't want to think that affluent areas or 
semi-affluent areas like the Westside have homeless problems. 
</P>
<P>
I think people on the Westside are concerned about the homeless. (But) there's 
also a concern about personal safety and about property values. 
</P>
<P>
The solution to the problem is affordable housing. That's the bottom line.

A HELLISH LIFE IN 'DEMOCRATIC' GUATEMALA; 
</P>
<P>
IN THIS VERSION OF A CAPITALISTIC ECONOMY, THE ARMY ALWAYS WINS -- WHOEVER IS 
ELECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE BLACK, George Black is foreign editor of the Nation magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is some irony in the fact that, at a time of declining public faith in 
U.S. electoral democracy, one of our growth industries should be the monitoring 
of democratic procedures in other countries. There's always a team somewhere, 
it seems: one day Bulgaria, the next Pakistan. This week it's Guatemala, which 
is holding a presidential election today. 
</P>
<P>
Two basic yardsticks are commonly employed to judge the propriety of elections 
in a place like Guatemala. The first, often used by the State Department, 
stresses that this is the first orderly transfer of the presidency in years, 
without a coup d'etat or other messy interruption. 
</P>
<P>
The second, more the preserve of the semiofficial election monitors, is 
concerned with the niceties of the vote. Americans are especially given to this 
kind of quantifiable research -- whether pinkies or thumbs are dipped in the 
proper indelible ink, whether penalties exist to deter multiple voting and 
fraudulent registrations. After decades of watching soldiers load ballot boxes 
onto the backs of unmarked picked trucks and computers that mysteriously go 
down halfway through the count, these are understandable correctives. 
</P>
<P>
In Guatemala, however, neither set of criteria is of much use. Election 
monitoring there is rather like conducting an autopsy and declaring the corpse 
to be healthy because you find no cavities in its teeth. 
</P>
<P>
After today's election, votes will be tabulated and a winner declared. Perhaps 
it will be Jorge Carpio Nicolle, a mediocre right-wing newspaper magnate who 
ran a distant second in 1985. Carpio was an early leader in the opinion polls 
after the enforced withdrawal of retired Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, Guatemala's 
dictator in 1982-83, who was barred from running under a constitutional clause 
that prohibits the candidacy of anyone who has ever seized power violently. 
</P>
<P>
But whoever is elected, the army gets in. Something Americans are slow to 
understand about Third World political elites is that they are excellent 
mimics. Even the Somozas and the Marcoses, in their own crude way, knew how to 
parrot the sweet language of democracy. The Guatemalan officer corps has 
learned that having the president wear a uniform may not be the best way of 
securing its long-term interests. Since the early 1980s it has come to see that 
the election of an ineffectual civilian in a clean vote, far from being a 
hindrance, may actually be a better cover than money could ever buy. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's too easy to blame all Guatemala's horrors on evil generals and 
naive or venal Americans. Outgoing President Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo is also 
responsible. A single adjective crops up constantly in discussions of the 
Cerezo presidency: "frivolous." It's an odd word to use about someone who 
survived three assassination attempts as a young Christian Democrat. But what 
Cerezo seems to have liked best about elective office was its perks -- the 
cars, the country-house parties, the women. Recently he bought himself a little 
island in the Caribbean; Guatemala City gossip says he beat out pop singer 
Julio Iglesias in the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
For other Guatemalans, the usual routines apply. Thanks to the economic 
austerity policies of the 1980s, thousands of children now live on the streets, 
the product of escalating misery. The latest pastime of the Guatemala City 
police is killing these kids -- perhaps in the name of some deranged conception 
of law and order; perhaps just for kicks. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 11 the anthropologist Myrna Mack was stabbed to death outside her 
office. She was the founder of the Guatemalan Assn. for the Advancement of the 
Social Sciences, which to the Guatemalan army is a little like saying you 
belong to the Society for the Spread of International Communism. Then on Oct. 
25, gunmen opened fire on the journalist Byron Barrera, gravely wounding him 
and killing his wife. His newspaper, La Epoca, was firebombed into submission 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
I mention these two cases not because they are especially unusual (there were 
136 extrajudicial executions in September, an average sort of month), or even 
because I happened to know both Mack and Barrera professionally. I cite them 
because they show -- to borrow some terminology from Eastern Europe -- a state 
bent on extinguishing the breath of civil society. 
</P>
<P>
This has been a year of celebrating the failure of communism and the spread of 
capitalist democracy to the entire world. But global systems deserve to be 
judged by their failures as well as their successes. For those who live in 
Guatemala's version of a market economy, life is hell -- whoever is president, 
and no matter how many voters dip their thumbs in the ink today.

SADDAM HUSSEIN HAS BEEN GIVEN EVERY CHANCE TO WITHDRAW FROM KUWAIT. IT IS TIME 
TO ENSURE HIS DESTRUCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANE KIRKPATRICK, Jeane Kirkpatrick writes a syndicated column in 
Washington.

<TEXT>
<P>
Three months have passed since President Bush announced his decision to send 
American troops to the Persian Gulf. Forces from a dozen states have now been 
assembled in and around the region. The President said last week he was sending 
200,000 or so more troops to supplement the 230,000 U.S. forces already there. 
But not one move has been made to end the devastation and plunder of Kuwait, or 
to defend its beleaguered people from daily abuse. 
</P>
<P>
We may even have lost sight of the reason Bush sent all those men and all that 
materiel to the gulf in the first place. They were dispatched under Article 51 
of the United Nations Charter, he explained. The article provides that all 
states have the right to defend themselves against aggression and to seek help 
from others in that defense. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait sought American help and U.S. forces were sent in response to that 
request. It is simply a fact that no progress has yet been made toward 
achievement of the goal to which Bush committed the United States -- even 
though great progress has been made in the accumulation of forces required to 
restore Kuwait's independence, and Saddam Hussein has been given ample notice 
of the seriousness with which the United States and others regard his 
aggression. 
</P>
<P>
He has made no use of the generous opportunity provided to withdraw his troops 
from Kuwait as he once disengaged from war against Iran. Now, senior U.S. 
diplomats have conveyed through intermediaries solemn warnings to Hussein that 
the remaining time to withdraw from Kuwait is very short -- perhaps only two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, his belligerence and tenacity have been unaffected by the 
accumulation of force against him. His assertions of sovereignty over Kuwait 
have grown louder and, if possible, more intransigent. 
</P>
<P>
By his policy of invasion, devastation and annexation, Saddam Hussein has 
identified himself as an implacable enemy of Kuwait's independence. For this 
reason, it is clear that any "solution" that leaves his military capacities 
intact will be no solution. Otherwise, he will simply wait until international 
forces have gone home to continue his plans for regional dominance. To be 
deterred, Saddam Hussein must be effectively disarmed. 
</P>
<P>
What then must the United States do? 
</P>
<P>
"If we desire to defeat the enemy," wrote Karl von Clausewitz, "We must 
proportion our efforts to his powers of resistance. This is expressed by the 
product of two factors which cannot be separated; namely, the sum of available 
means and the strength of the will." 
</P>
<P>
George Bush must demonstrate will equal to Saddam Hussein's. He must also use 
force to compel Hussein to abandon the use of force. Iraq is no superpower so, 
if the wills are equal, there is no doubt that the United States and the 
associated coalition will prevail. 
</P>
<P>
No law of war compels the President to choose between a strategy of appeasement 
and a Vietnam-style ground war. Viable alternatives exist between the two 
extremes. 
</P>
<P>
There are good reasons for not using American ground troops against Iraq. If 
such forces are required, there are Egyptians, Saudis and other Arab troops 
from the region who can and should ensure the departure of Iraqi forces from 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The United States could make its contribution by highly selective aerial 
bombing designed to disarm Hussein. Should Hussein make the mistake of striking 
a counterblow against Israel, that government will know how to respond. 
</P>
<P>
The goal must be to disarm the megalomanic who has used force and the threat of 
force against all of his neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, the entire coalition could later oversee the emergence of a new 
Iraqi government committed to respecting the rights of states in the region to 
live within secure borders. 
</P>
<P>
As Eliot Cohen noted in his probing analysis in the current issue of Commentary 
magazine, "The longer (Saddam Hussein) has to fortify Kuwait, to prepare his 
armies and people for war, and to lay the groundwork for a campaign of terror 
and subversion overseas, the harder he will make it for us." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, it is time to begin the defense of Kuwait.

THE PARTY'S OVER, SO RESPONSIBLE POLITICS CALLED IT A DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN M. YODER Jr., Edwin M. Yoder writes a syndicated column in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The election outcome is well summed up in the sagacious remark attributed to 
St. Theresa: "More tears are shed over answered, than unanswered, prayers." 
</P>
<P>
And haven't our political prayers been answered? Isn't this what you really 
wanted when you moved to the suburbs, re-registered as an "independent" and 
began sending your donations to the single-issue outfits? Isn't it what you 
wanted when you said, "I vote for the man, not the party"? Or "Why don't they 
cut out the cheap partisanship and just do the right thing"? 
</P>
<P>
Of course it is. And the common denominator was and is hostility to political 
parties. The trouble is that parties, messy as they are, are the only 
instruments by which a diverse electorate ever managed to hold government 
accountable for its acts and policies. At their best, they stood for coherence, 
accountability and discipline. 
</P>
<P>
But by now parties consist, pretty much, of offices in Washington. In Congress, 
it is everyone for himself. This is no surprise, since parties have less to say 
about who runs for what under which label than the press, which has less to say 
about it than big donors, public-relations firms and advertising tycoons. All 
you need to run today, even for President, is an ample ego, a pollster and a 
financial backer or two. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone who enters this self-initiated process wins. But no one loses or 
fails at it because a party disapproves, or because the candidate's opinions 
have little to do with the party's historic positions. A Ku Kluxer runs for 
senator as a "Republican" in Louisiana, and the party is powerless to stop him. 
It cannot even withhold the label. Parties adjust to candidates, not the other 
way around. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder Tuesday's election looks to most observers like a "themeless 
pudding." It was the latest study in the incoherence of partyless politics.

IN ALL HIS GLORY; WILLIAM S. PALEY, THE LEGENDARY TYCOON AND HIS BRILLIANT 
CIRCLE BY SALLY BEDELL SMITH (SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER: $29.95; 815 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Sherrill, Sherrill is corporation correspondent for the Nation 
magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Apparently a kindly deity has put certain rich people on this earth to give us 
lesser mortals the pleasure of detesting them. 
</P>
<P>
"In All His Glory" persuades me that William S. Paley is in that group. 
</P>
<P>
One may easily admire him for the willpower, craftiness and luck that enabled 
him to dominate the Columbia Broadcasting System for more than half a century. 
And socially, when everything was going his way, he could be very charming. 
</P>
<P>
But otherwise, phew! Paley was a notoriously unfaithful husband, a spiteful and 
indifferent father, an often oppressive and devious employer, a braggart, a 
shameless social climber, an opportunistic patriot. Among other suitable 
adjectives: shallow, superstitious, hypochondriacal, vengeful, insensitive. 
</P>
<P>
For that appraisal I rely solely on the evidence supplied by Sally Bedell 
Smith. But I don't feel she has turned out a hatchet job. "In All His Glory," 
meticulously researched (the last 142 pages are citations and bibliography), is 
as sympathetic and balanced as the facts allow. Elegantly written, entertaining 
even when the action bogs down in the board room, free of hype, overflowing 
with lush details to bring high society and low business to life -- it is the 
best biography of a tycoon I've ever read. 
</P>
<P>
Son of an immigrant Russian Jew who started from scratch and became a 
millionaire making cigars, Bill Paley also was a successful cigar maker (first 
as a strike breaker) until 1928 when, at the age of 26, he bought into and 
became president of an infant radio network. 
</P>
<P>
He made the career shift reluctantly. Although he concocted the legend that he 
was a risk-taker, actually he hated risks. His lack of pioneering spirit later 
hurt CBS the most when he held back from television, allowing NBC to take a 
giant lead. Although CBS had a color technology ready to go as early as 1940, 
its first commercial colorcast wasn't until midway through 1951. 
</P>
<P>
Often, CBS' progress and profits came despite Paley, who lacked vision. He was 
reluctant to support research that resulted in the LP record, one of CBS's 
greatest technological triumphs and one of its most profitable. When the 
corporation had accumulated so many surplus millions that it was looking for 
investments, he passed up a chance to buy the gold-mine Washington Post and 
instead used CBS's treasury to make piddling investments in toy and guitar 
companies. With a worldwide news-gathering operation in place, CBS had a chance 
to take the lead in cable news, but Paley left that prize to Ted Turner by 
default. 
</P>
<P>
Using the bottom line as a whip, Paley drove some of his best executives nuts. 
One of his programmers used to vomit after every meeting with the boss. It was 
underlings, not Paley, who discovered most of CBS's biggest stars, like Arthur 
Godfrey and Lucille Ball, but Paley took credit for virtually all of his 
subordinates' good ideas. Still, they respected him; he was, said one CBS exec, 
"rat smart." 
</P>
<P>
As an honorary colonel, he went off, with a golden dog tag from Cartier and his 
personal valet, to fight World War II in such trenches as London's Claridge's 
hotel. Later he did give some service as a propagandist in occupied Germany, 
but mostly he spent the war boozing and bedding Pamela Churchill and Edwina 
Mountbatten and his secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Paley was often gone, playing around with his society pals, during the crucial 
post-war years when CBS was struggling with the transition to TV and coping 
with new federal regulations. But when those who really ran the corporation got 
good press, Paley became dangerously jealous. Mean jealousy, Smith suggests, 
was one reason Paley eventually would force Frank Stanton, who was CBS 
president for 27 years and "whose business acumen, decency and understated 
humor endeared him to his colleagues," to retire at the peak of his usefulness. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, except for the programming side of broadcasting, Paley had little 
interest in business. He had, however, what many CBS executives told Smith was 
a "rapacious" interest in money. Even after he was personally worth half a 
billion, he wasn't satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
To keep the loot coming in a flood, he was willing to put on trash 
entertainment and let advertisers dictate the content of his news programs. 
During the McCarthy witch-hunting period, CBS buckled under to right-wing 
advertisers and had its own blacklist. (Oddly, Smith does not mention what CBS 
did to John Henry Faulk in its most infamous case of blacklisting.) 
</P>
<P>
Great reporters like Edward R. Murrow, William Shirer and Howard K. Smith were 
beaten down, gagged, or fired. Always sucking up to Washington, Paley ran 
reruns of "I Love Lucy" rather than cover some of the most important Vietnam 
hearings. And during the Watergate investigation, says Smith, CBS was 
remarkably timid. 
</P>
<P>
A snob, Paley's purest delight was in hobnobbing with the rich. He planned his 
marriages accordingly. Dorothy, divorced from William Randolph Hearst's 
bibulous son Jack, served as first wife, but she was too independent, too 
scathingly witty, to last. Paley wanted a wife who would not only help him 
climb to the highest social circles but would put up with connubial peonage. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Cushing Mortimer, better known as Babe, daughter of a famous surgeon, 
was made for the role. Not only were her social connections perfect -- one of 
her sisters was married to Jock Whitney and the other married Vincent Astor 
after divorcing President Roosevelt's son James -- but she was a fashion 
goddess as well: 5-feet-8, a size six or eight, streamlined and spiffy, in 
fashion's Hall of Fame. She wouldn't kiss her children good night for fear of 
mussing her hair or smearing her lipstick. 
</P>
<P>
Babe the hostess would do anything to please Paley. She thought nothing of 
having "the chauffeur take her to Kennedy Airport to pick up a freshly shot 
fowl that had been flown in from overseas." 
</P>
<P>
But like Wife No. 1 (who said, "I had 13 years of dames"), Babe finally got fed 
up with his philandering. For the last 15 years or so of her life, she never 
slept with him. For sex, wives weren't necessary. Paley the pathological 
skirt-chaser had nothing against bedding the rich and famous, but, says Smith, 
"mostly he went for classic mistress types -- common, empty-headed and pretty" 
-- and one-night stands because he was too tight to set up a long-term mistress 
in style. 
</P>
<P>
His wick flickered but never went out. Even in his 80s, he was dating 
20-year-olds, confiding in them his sexual fantasies while never taking his 
hand from their legs, bidding his guests good night with French kisses (to 
their disgust), a dirty old man to the last. 
</P>
<P>
What has this preeminent tycoon left behind as a monument to his life? A 
network whose executives talked glibly of maintaining a "Tiffany image" but, 
pressured by Paley, too often settled for the banal. The old glamour was gone 
long before Paley lost control of the boardroom to Laurence Tisch, but when 
that happened CBS became, in Frank Stanton's words, "just another company with 
dirty carpets." 
</P>
<P>
But, Smith wisely adds, "Perhaps Tisch finally made CBS what it had been all 
along -- a machine of lowbrow mass-market entertainment, now shorn of its 
pretensions."

members Milton Berle, Lucille Ball and Norman Lear, but he was more comfortable 
with such trappings of power as the rostrum at stockholder's meetings and the 
chauffeur-driven limosine.

RICHARD EDER: NIGHTINGALE IN A CAGE; 
</P>
<P>
HAROUN AND THE SEA OF STORIES BY SALMAN RUSHDIE (VIKING: $18.95; 210 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is a book in captivity; marked by it, marred by it, and owing its own odd 
value to it. 
</P>
<P>
Salman Rushdie, still in hiding in Britain from the death sentence pronounced 
by the Ayatollah Khomeini -- whose curse failed to expire with him -- gives his 
pain the shape of a children's story. It is not a real children's story, or if 
it is, it is not a very good one. It is not really a good story of any kind; 
certainly nowhere near the quality of "Midnight's Children," or of the book 
that imprisoned its author: "The Satanic Verses." 
</P>
<P>
What it is, in its own way, is a prison document, and unexpectedly touching. 
Rushdie has written a fable about the kind of tyranny he is suffering from, one 
which seeks to cripple the Word. It is partly crippled itself. From a dancer 
confined to cramped movements in a cell, we learn two things: What a crime it 
is to confine a dancer; and what a dance looks like when deprived of what it 
requires to move, though not of what moves it in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"Haroun and the Sea of Stories" began as a bedtime story for Rushdie's son, 
Zafar, according to a publisher's note. It evolved into the voice of a man 
ostensibly performing for a child, but crying out, in fact, to the grown-up 
world outside. 
</P>
<P>
It tells of the storyteller Rashid, a bubbly fabulist in a nameless sad city, 
who loses his gift when his wife runs off with an accountant. Rashid had been 
hooked up to the Sea of Stories -- hence, his abilities -- but through a 
bureaucratic mix-up, his invisible faucet is to be cut off. Haroun, his son, 
catches a Water Genie in the act of disconnecting it. After some argument and a 
trick or two, the Genie agrees to take them to headquarters, run by a figure 
called Walrus. 
</P>
<P>
Walrus headquarters, and the Sea of Stories, are on a moon named Kahina. 
Rashid, Haroun and the Genie travel there on the back of a clockwork hoopoe 
bird. When they arrive, they find that Kahina is in crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea of Stories is being polluted by the evil Khattam-Shud, ruler of Chub on 
the dark side of the moon. After a series of adventures, Haroun, Rashid and the 
Walrus Army destroy Khattam, along with his factory-ship that is pouring poison 
into the sea. Stories will go on, unpolluted, and Rashid will get his wife 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie, whose gifts include wit and wildness in a sharp engagement with the 
world's complexities, has trouble applying these talents to the style of a 
children's story. There is humor in "Haroun" but there are also disabling 
quantities of whimsy. 
</P>
<P>
Rashid's sad city, we are told, borders on "a mournful sea full of glumfish 
which were so miserable to eat that they made people belch with melancholy." 
When Haroun suffers from a loss of concentration after his mother runs away, a 
neighbor opines: "Cause is located in his pussy-Collar-jee." The talkative 
hoopoe bird prefaces his speeches with "But . . . But . . . But." His name, of 
course, is Butt. Whimsical capitalization -- "Too Complicated To Explain," for 
example -- has echoes of "Winnie the Pooh"; the impatient creatures who conduct 
the bewildered Haroun on his adventures recall "Alice." 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie fabricates the outlandish denizens of Kahina and the twists and turns 
of the story in a hurried, piled-on fashion. He forces things; he lacks the 
belief and gravity that a good children's story requires for its fantasy. 
Rushdie is interested in something else. 
</P>
<P>
The something else is his protest against oppression. And if the whimsical 
images of "Haroun" can set the reader's teeth on edge, they take on a different 
aspect insofar as they transmit a message. 
</P>
<P>
Rashid, the storyteller, is Rushdie's free artist. His dependence on the Sea of 
Stories says that art is not arbitrary and self-willed, but that it draws on 
the wellsprings of human need, and that it is as essential as water. 
</P>
<P>
Khattam-Shud, of course (it means "over and done with" in Hindustani), is a 
Khomeini. In an encounter with Haroun, he concedes that stories may be fun, but 
that life is not about fun but about control. And since stories -- art -- 
subvert control, they must be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
And Rushdie will give his fable a further turn, subtle and affecting. The 
Walrus and his organization, working to keep the Sea of Stories fresh and pure, 
had arranged to stop the moon's revolutions so that their Sea would always be 
in the sunlight. This meant, though, that Chub was always in the dark. Khattam 
thrives on darkness; his destruction is accomplished when Haroun arranges to 
get the moon turning so that sunlight hits Chub, as well. 
</P>
<P>
If a Khomeini can come to power, it is in part because the West has arrogated 
sunlight to itself, and left much of the globe bereft of it. Rushdie defies the 
Ayatollah's curse. It is he, not his persecutor, who is the true defender of 
the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie employs the style of a children's story with a trying self-indulgence. 
But he uses it to say something that is grave and moving, both in its wider 
reach, and when applied to his particular circumstances. We notice, for 
instance, his images of unconfined movement -- a bus rocketing along, the 
soaring hoopoe bird -- that this confined man uses to sustain his spirit. And 
awkwardness becomes its own art in the dedication verse that cites other 
fantasy kingdoms: 
</P>
<P>
Zembla, Zenda, Xanadu: 
</P>
<P>
All our dream-world may come true. 
</P>
<P>
Fairy lands are fearsome too. 
</P>
<P>
As I wander far from view 
</P>
<P>
Read, and bring me home to you. 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie had all the time in the world to work the first letter of each line 
into an acrostic of his son's name. That incarcerated time weighs upon all of 
us; it recalls another two lines. Blake's: 
</P>
<P>
 A nightingale in a cage 
</P>
<P>
Puts all Heaven in a rage.

<P>
ROAD SONG; A MEMOIR BY NATALIE KUSZ (FARRAR, STRAUS &amp; GIROUX: $18.95; 216 
PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Nancy Forbes Romano, Romano taught fiction writing at Columbia University 
and is currently working on a collection of short stories. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Road Song: A Memoir" is a riveting first book. Writing in a prose so clear 
that you can see to the very bottom of her startling experience, Natalie Kusz 
tells the story of her family's migration from Los Angeles to Alaska 21 years 
ago, when she was 6 years old. 
</P>
<P>
It is a vivid account of pioneer living on America's last frontier, but at the 
center of the story is an event so shocking that even the power and beauty of 
the Alaskan wilderness turns to wallpaper. On a freezing winter afternoon, soon 
after her seventh birthday, Natalie falls prey to a pack of starving dogs, 
losing chunks of her face and head. That night her mother prays for her to die. 
</P>
<P>
Of the children's hospital where Natalie lives at first, among a changing 
circle of doomed children, she writes: "For most of us, it became clear that 
horror can last only a little while, and then it becomes commonplace." Though 
far from commonplace, Kusz's writing is compellingly matter-of-fact. Her memory 
is purified of brooding, self-pity and blame. 
</P>
<P>
With crystalline precision, she relives the progression of her bone grafts, her 
friendships, her enemies. At 11, she pulls away from her pacifist parents 
because they allow her younger siblings to be tortured by schoolyard bullies. 
After her father finally teaches her to fight, she begins to take revenge -- 
eventually going beyond revenge to draw blood for its own sake. 
</P>
<P>
By the time she reaches high school, Natalie is a large, overweight girl with a 
patch over one missing eye, an outcast who has learned to command respect from 
her peers through violence. Now she starts on drugs, alcohol and sex, lying all 
the while to her concerned but overworked parents: "I grew so accustomed to the 
racing fear in my belly that in time I almost did not notice it." 
</P>
<P>
Even at her most unrepentant, she can't shake her attachment to her family, and 
in the reliving of her delinquency, Kusz is mindful of the theme that runs 
through her whole memoir: the strength derived first from family. The issues 
that Kusz confronts are timely ones. As a voice from a new generation, she 
enters the hot debate on family values with innocent force. From the outset, 
and for their own reasons, Natalie's parents believed in solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
Although Natalie often chafed under her parents' vigilance -- heightened by the 
accident -- she was unable to ward off its benefits. When her best friend Marcy 
asks her what her parents would do if they found out about her secret high 
school behavior, Natalie says: "They'd go on and on forever about trust and 
betrayal, and how a family is supposed to be all one fortress, no spies, no 
traitors." 
</P>
<P>
"You mean your mom and dad like you?" her friend asks, "Jeez, if your parents 
like you, I don't see why you're here and not there." 
</P>
<P>
It is Natalie's pregnancy that finally brings the family together, as in the 
early years of her accident. "We were once again an alliance, once again 
defensible from the world." 
</P>
<P>
As much as their memoir records suffering, it also recalls delights, midnight 
suns, and hard work. Natalie's family is courageously, desperately supportive, 
and the book bears witness to all the emotional states that such a family 
fosters, and then must withstand. The Kuszes lived together for years in just 
one room lit by kerosene lamps, telling stories, singing songs, planning 
houses. "Our sense of humor was our father's -- absurd puns and loud, ungainly 
laughter -- and our quickness to befriend other misfits was Mom's." 
</P>
<P>
Natalie is nourished by stories, and she tells the histories of her own 
remarkable parents: Her father had escaped from Nazi Poland during the war, and 
her endlessly energetic mother turns out to have been driven by fears of her 
own mother's schizophrenia. These stories, like the less articulate ones she 
teases out of her younger brother and sisters, form and re-form for her, 
dissolving anger and rebellion into sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
Some wounds don't heal; others do, leaving scars. "Road Song" is Natalie Kusz's 
effort to commemorate not her bodily injury -- we never do get to see what, in 
fact, she looks like -- but its spiritual cost. Her gifts as a writer, her 
original voice and sparkling perceptions, give this memoir the literary 
precision of a novel. 
</P>
<P>
Kusz lets us into her life, and it is both a privilege and a pleasure to be 
there.

THE THING FROM THE TAR PITS; 
</P>
<P>
JURASSIC PARK BY MICHAEL CRICHTON (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $19.95; 413 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Andrew Ferguson, Ferguson is an editorial writer with Scripps Howard News 
Service. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Crichton, the doctor (Harvard Medical) turned novelist ("The Andromeda 
Strain") turned moviemaker ("Coma"), is a worry wart, and like most excessively 
anxious people he feels duty-bound to make the rest of us as edgy as he is. His 
many novels and movies form an extended brief explaining why we, as a nation, 
race and planet, should have a serious case of the willies. 
</P>
<P>
The theme that preoccupies him is nothing less than the hubris of man and the 
heedlessness of science. Our capacity for technological innovation, in his 
view, has outstripped our capacity to deal maturely with the power it affords, 
carrying us inexorably to the yawning abyss of annihilation. Crichton's first 
novel, "The Andromeda Strain," told the story of a 
life-as-we-know-it-destroying bacterium uncorked by money-grubbing scientists; 
likewise, his movie "Westworld" featured a rampaging amusement-park automaton 
(played by Yul Brynner) who turns on his feckless human creators and, Yul 
Brynner-like, pumps them full of hot lead. 
</P>
<P>
Only time will tell whether Crichton's worries about rampaging bacilli and 
deranged automatons are justified -- even now, after all, an irritable Third 
World dictator is hoarding untold stashes of bacteria, and you never can tell 
when the talking Abraham Lincoln at Disneyland might go berserk during some 
matinee, lifting skirts and making rude noises with his armpits. But so far the 
Crichton prognostication average has not been good -- zero, in fact. We should 
hope it stays that way. Otherwise, having read Crichton's fat new novel, 
"Jurassic Park," I have a word of advice for anyone owning real estate within 
10 miles of La Brea tar pits: Sell. 
</P>
<P>
What sets Crichton's teeth to chattering these days is biotechnology, the 
manipulation of DNA to create new forms of life or -- the premise of "Jurassic 
Park" -- re-create old ones. The novel opens with a documentary-like sketch of 
how this new technology has come to be corrupted by slithery commerce. Once 
scientists were pure, disinterested; now they -- unlike, say, the directors of 
sci-fi movies and the authors of pulp fiction -- have lowered themselves to 
making a buck. "Suddenly," Mr. Crichton writes, "it seemed as if everyone 
wanted to become rich." 
</P>
<P>
"Jurassic Park" is the story of how this ignoble ambition, married to 
biotechnology, results in the beginning of the end of the world as we know it, 
or at least of Costa Rica. That hapless Central American country is the site of 
the eponymous park, developed by one John Hammond, a money-grubbing and devious 
American entrepreneur, on an island off the coast. There money-grubbing 
scientists, working in secret, have managed to cull dinosaur DNA from ancient 
amber and re-construct living versions of the beasts, so that they might serve 
as tourist attractions for wonder-struck Americanos. 
</P>
<P>
Things, as you can imagine, quickly go awry. A few months before the park is to 
open, an unspecified number of the smaller dinosaurs escape to the mainland, 
where, on a deserted beach, they maul the vacationing family of a Dallas 
real-estate developer -- a tragedy all the more horrifying because the 
real-estate developer escapes unharmed. The authorities remain unaware of the 
danger through a series of amazingly convenient botches, giving Hammond the 
chance to summon a handful of experts to set matters in order. 
</P>
<P>
This is a risky plot device for Mr. Crichton, since it requires him to 
introduce characters into his elaborate fictional architecture, and the 
creation of plausible characters is not, to speak generously, his strength. Our 
hero is a paleontologist called Grant; we are signalled his hero status early 
on when Mr. Crichton informs us that Grant eschews the stuffy tweeds of the 
common prof in favor of jeans and sneakers -- even when he lectures! He is 
joined on the island by a mathematician named Malcolm; a sexy assistant called 
Sattler; a candy-bar-scarfing computer jockey, Nedry by name, who designed the 
island's labyrinthine security systems, and two insufferably precocious 
grandchildren of the evil Hammond. 
</P>
<P>
The mutilations begin in earnest not long after this group arrives at Jurassic 
Park. The computer expert (note that a single letter's transposition makes 
Nedry nerdy -- a typical Crichton subtlety) neutralizes the island's electronic 
fences for his own devious purposes, mostly of the money-grubbing kind. His 
comeuppance follows shortly after, for with the fences down the dinosaurs roam 
freely, and before long they've put on the old feed bag and are dining on 
Nedry's innards. Hungry creatures, dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
Nedry's intestines are neither the first nor the last to be spilled and gnawed 
in Jurassic Park. In these scenes, Crichton's prose, usually rough-hewn and 
business-like, takes on an almost sensual vividness. "Nedry stumbled, reaching 
blindly down to touch the ragged edge of his shirt, and then a thick, slippery 
mass that was surprisingly warm, and with horror he suddenly knew . . . his 
guts had fallen out." The vividness increases when you remember that Nedry has 
spent the afternoon eating Mars Bars. 
</P>
<P>
As unattractive as these passages are, they're almost Johnsonian compared with 
the dithering of the mathematician Malcolm, who serves as Crichton's Greek 
chorus. Hubris-of-man and heedlessness-of-science soliloquys flow from him like 
intestines from a computer nerd. Our "Western training" saps our appreciation 
of nature, Crichton-Malcolm announces ponderously, and encourages us to conquer 
nature rather than live harmoniously with it -- a tired if once again 
fashionable idea that has been far more cogently expressed elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
My pre-publication copy of "Jurassic Park" bears the ominous phrase "Soon to be 
a major motion picture," raising the suspicion that this fat novel is really a 
screenplay larded up with a few tons of exposition. A movie would have the 
advantage of being without Malcolm's dime-store philosophizing, but it would 
lack too the book's only real virtue: its genuinely interesting discussions of 
dinosaurs, DNA research, paleontology and chaos theory. 
</P>
<P>
Crichton could have performed a service by using this material to write books 
of popular science. Instead, he's written a ponderous novel soon to be a major, 
and undoubtedly trashy, motion picture. Suddenly it seems as if everybody wants 
to become rich.

THE AGONY OF DECEIT; 
</P>
<P>
KGB; THE INSIDE STORY BY CHRISTOPHER ANDREW AND OLEG GORDIEVSKY (HARPER 
COLLINS: $29.95; 776 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ross Thomas, Thomas' new book is Twilight at Mac's Place, published by 
Mysterious Press. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After joining the KGB in 1962, Oleg Gordievsky grew disillusioned six years 
later when Soviet tanks clattered into Czechoslovakia, crushing the Prague 
Spring and its new brand of socialism that promised a human face. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Gordievsky grew so disillusioned that he offered his services to the 
British Secret Intelligence Services, which apparently accepted them with 
alacrity. While on the SIS payroll, or perhaps only in its thrall, Gordievsky 
continued to rise in his own spy service, eventually achieving the rank of KGB 
resident (head of station) in London. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, he was summoned back to Moscow for consultation. Suspecting that his 
treachery had been discovered, Gordievsky dissembled, stalled and eventually 
escaped back to London, leaving behind his wife and two small daughters. He has 
not seen them since. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, he teamed with Cambridge historian Christopher Andrew to write a 
history of the KGB. They would concentrate on how the Russian spy agencies have 
viewed the world as a huge conspiracy aimed directly at the U.S.S.R. The result 
is "KGB: The Inside Story," a 776-page treatise that traces in often 
excruciating detail what Russian spies have done or tried to do from the time 
of Ivan the Terrible in 1565 to the present day. 
</P>
<P>
As they follow the KGB through its permutations from its birth as the Cheka in 
1917 to the various acronyms that followed -- OGPU, NKVD, MGB, MVD and, 
finally, KGB -- the historian and the ex-spy return again and again to the 
Soviet obsession with conspiracies, some of them real, many of them imaginary. 
</P>
<P>
It also is a history of constant intrigue, rampant paranoia, numbing fear and, 
were it not for the wholesale butchery, it frequently reads like the inner 
workings of the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture gone slightly mad. 
</P>
<P>
One of Gordievsky's own and quite understandable obsessions is with Kim Philby, 
the late MI6 star and Soviet agent who almost became chief of Britain's Secret 
Intelligence Service. Philby, of course, was the senior partner in the old-boy 
spy firm of Philby, MacLean, Burgess and Blunt. 
</P>
<P>
The authors rather breathlessly reveal that there is yet a fifth member of the 
old-boy spy firm that the KGB is said to have begun calling "The Magnificent 
Five" after watching Steve McQueen, Yul Brynner et al in "The Magnificent 
Seven." The firm's fifth member is none other than John Cairncross -- not 
exactly a household name in this country. 
</P>
<P>
But the authors assure us that he was a most excellent Soviet spy. "In less 
than a decade after leaving Cambridge, he served successively in the Foreign 
Office, the Treasury, the private office of a government minister . . . and 
SIS." 
</P>
<P>
For those who out of curiosity or even perversity follow the careers of British 
double agents, both real and imaginary, John Cairncross is a familiar name. 
Back in 1984, Chapman Pincher, in his book "Too Secret Too Long," devoted 
almost a dozen unflattering pages to Cairncross, charging him with most of the 
same treacherous deeds that Andrew and Gordievsky now accuse him of six years 
later. Cairncross, however, no longer denies anything, Pincher says. "He simply 
points out that he has never admitted having been a spy." 
</P>
<P>
For U.S. readers, Andrew and Gordievsky also offer a long list of Americans who 
have been charged, tried, convicted and even executed for having been Soviet 
agents. There are Alger Hiss and Whittaker Chambers, of course, although the 
authors note that their account of Chambers' "career is based on Allen 
Weinstein's 'Perjury: The Hiss-Chambers Case,' " a book that many Hiss 
partisans still dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The Rosenbergs, Ethel and Julius, are mentioned in a curiously sympathetic way. 
They "eloquently, even movingly, protested their innocence to the end. In 
April, they became the only Soviet spies in the west to be sentenced to death. 
. . . Both Julius and Ethel were dedicated, courageous Soviet agents, who 
believed that they could serve the future of their cause by denying their 
association with it." There is no footnote to this assertion, but it seems 
likely to be a tribute of sorts from Gordievsky. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is the curious case of Harry L. Hopkins, the man who was one of 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt's closest advisers and sometimes even lived in 
the White House. According to Gordievsky, all the Soviet authorities he 
discussed Hopkins with agreed that "Hopkins had been an agent of major 
significance." A Soviet agent, it should be noted. 
</P>
<P>
Upon reflection, Gordievsky finally decided that "Hopkins had been an 
unconscious rather than a conscious agent." In CIA parlance, that would be an 
unwitting rather than a witting agent. Unwitting agents often are none too 
bright, which is something no one ever accused Hopkins of being. However, after 
going through a rather tortuous analysis, the two authors finally agree that 
"In backing Stalin and the Soviet war effort, Hopkins acted from a 
determination to prevent a Nazi victory rather than from a secret commitment to 
the Communist cause." 
</P>
<P>
The Russians still think he was their agent. But then, so do many Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps too much of the book is devoted to intramural infighting in the Russian 
spy bureaucracies. But there is also a measure of titillating gossip about 
cyanide guns concealed in cigarette packs, the history of the famous umbrellas 
purchased in Washington and transformed into Bulgarian assassination weapons, 
and about how the KGB recruits its agents. 
</P>
<P>
"KGB: The Inside Story" is essentially a long, long tale of deceit, treachery 
and politics by terrible means. In other words, it's about espionage. It's also 
a cautionary tale that in its final paragraph clearly states its warning: 
</P>
<P>
"Like every major modern state, Russia needs both a domestic security service 
and a foreign intelligence agency. For it to possess an intelligence community 
worthy of its citizens' respect, however, it will have to close down the KGB 
and start afresh." 
</P>
<P>
On second thought, it's more of a dream than a warning. 
</P>

CRIME AND CUSTODY; 
</P>
<P>
IN A CHILD'S NAME; THE LEGACY OF A MOTHER'S MURDER BY PETER MAAS (SIMON &amp; 
SCHUSTER: $19.95; 320 PP., ILLUSTRATED) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Teresa Carpenter, Carpenter is a Pulitzer Prize-winning crime reporter for 
the Village Voice and author of Missing Beauty (W. W. Norton). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the last 20 years, Peter Maas has displayed a positive genius for spotting 
the sui generis. Who better than Joe Valachi to guide us through the previously 
uncharted terrain of organized crime? Or Frank Serpico to reveal the moral rot 
at the heart of the New York City Police? Or Marie Ragghianti, whose crusade 
against the state of Tennessee showed how a principled nobody can run tire 
tracks over an evil bureaucracy. Each time I pick up Maas, I feel that I have 
been given a backstage pass to an American Moment. 
</P>
<P>
Of his latest book, "In a Child's Name: The Legacy of a Mother's Murder," I am 
not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"Legacy," as it unfolds beneath the pen of this indisputably gifted 
storyteller, chronicled the life and times of Dr. Kenneth Taylor, a New Jersey 
dentist whose villainies against women make Jeffrey McDonald look like Alan 
Alda. 
</P>
<P>
The product of a rigidly regimented Midwestern home life, Taylor abandons his 
first wife, an Indiana farm girl, when she is nine months pregnant and marries 
a flight attendant, whom -- for no apparent reason -- he tries to smother with 
a sponge soaked in chloroform. That marriage also dissolves without the second 
Mrs. Taylor ever filing a formal complaint, leaving Dr. Taylor free to take a 
third wife -- a sweet, plump dental hygienist named Teresa Benigno. 
</P>
<P>
It is clear, from the moment the vows pass her lips, that Teresa Taylor is 
doomed. On the couple's honeymoon in a posh Acapulco resort, she is beaten so 
savagely that her father must fly to Mexico to bring her home. Although 
Teresa's family -- the Benignos, a clan of Italian-Americans from Staten Island 
-- is convinced that Taylor was the attacker, Teresa also refuses to press 
charges against her husband. Instead, she gives birth to a baby son, Philip, 
whom her husband apparently adores. Five months later, her body is found -- 
lifeless, skull crushed -- in a bird sanctuary. Kenneth Taylor is convicted of 
his wife's murder and sentenced to 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Had the Taylor case ended with the jury's verdict, it probably would have been 
lost to memory in the ceaseless roil of domestic blood-letting. But a fitful 
coda brought this story to national attention. His mother murdered and his 
father in prison, Baby Philip Taylor became the object of a custody battle 
between his mother's sister, Celeste, and his paternal grandparents, Zach and 
Jean Taylor. A New Jersey court decreed that Philip should live 10 months of 
the year with his relatives in the East and two months in the Midwest. While 
Celeste was appealing this decision, little Philip was taken out of New Jersey 
by the Taylors, who then adopted him under Indiana law. Wild with grief, the 
Benignos retained a feminist attorney to get the baby back. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1987, Maas heard of the Benignos' predicament, and infuriated 
by what he called "state-sanctioned kidnaping," wrote an article for the New 
York Times Magazine. Siding unabashedly with the Benignos, he charted the 
bizarre details of a custody arrangement that required Celeste not only to 
accept phone calls from her sister's killer but to take the baby to the prison 
once a month to visit his father. Maas' outrage over a system that seemed to 
favor a wife-killer was real and infectious. (He seems to credit his wife for 
raising his feminist awareness.) "Legacy of a Mother's Murder" was a remarkably 
potent piece of advocacy journalism, timed, by Maas' own admission, to affect 
the outcome of the crucial custody hearing. 
</P>
<P>
There are times when a magazine article can say it all, and this, I suspect, is 
one. Maas acted upon an ill-advised impulse to expand it to book length, and 
the result is a tome of 300-plus pages that doesn't quite know what it wants to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
Is it still, as the subtitle suggests, the "Legacy of a Mother's Murder"? If 
so, the point is lost by confining the questions raised by the Times piece to 
the last quarter of the book. The author incurred this liability by opting for 
a linear, true-crime-narrative style, which shifts the focus away from the 
social issues and onto the crime's bizarre particulars. 
</P>
<P>
Don't get me wrong. As the genre goes, this is quality stuff. There is, for 
instance, plenty to interest students of abnormal psychology. Kenneth Taylor 
emerges as a man who, finding his mother "very judgmental," entered adult life 
hypersensitive about perceived slights to his manhood. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence of coerced sex led investigators to believe that Teresa had rebuffed 
an amorous advance, triggering in her husband a psychosexual rage. (Taylor 
claimed that he walked in on his wife while she was sexually molesting the 
baby. He killed her, he said, to protect the child.) 
</P>
<P>
As with other celebrated sociopaths, Taylor seems only to feel his own pain. 
Maas managed to obtain the defendant's own trial notes, which show him whining 
at the wounds inflicted by hostile witnesses. These comments emanate from a man 
who has either come to believe his own lies or is cynically constructing a 
record that he hopes will be found and vindicate him. 
</P>
<P>
Maas runs Taylor's self-pitying musings in counterpoint to the trial 
proceedings to eerie effect. Two of the under-credited victims of Taylor's 
atrocities were his parents who, in the face of grisly evidence to the 
contrary, chose to believe Ken's allegations that Teresa's drug use and general 
depravity led to her demise. Granted, Zach and Jean Taylor acted badly, and 
probably on direct instructions from their son. 
</P>
<P>
But one can imagine that they were as wildly fearful as the Benignos over the 
prospect of losing a grandchild. Maas gives little credence to their pain, 
portraying them, rather, as rigid, bloodless Baptists who are trying to 
alienate Philip from his Italian, Catholic roots. 
</P>
<P>
While I do feel that a partisan has a right to stack the deck, as long as he's 
upfront about his sympathies, the author's attempt to portray the struggle of 
these two families as "Good Versus Evil" will be insulting to many readers, 
particularly Midwesterners such as myself. 
</P>
<P>
I must confess that I fairly raced through the last 80 pages to find out what 
happened to Baby Philip. And although Maas is no prose stylist, I found myself 
admiring passages such as the one in which forensic technicians spray the 
Taylor home with luminescent chemicals, after which a trail of blood snakes 
through the halls as a shimmering green glow. 
</P>
<P>
As a conventional true-crime thriller, "Legacy" is a fine read. As a statement 
of conscience, it succeeds only partially. But as one of Maas' matchless 
moments, it misses the mark.

PAPERBACKS: POODLE SPRINGS BY RAYMOND CHANDLER &amp; ROBERT B. PARKER (BERKLEY:

When Raymond Chandler died in 1959, he left the first four chapters of this 
unfinished Philip Marlowe novel -- which Robert Parker uses as a sort of 
prologue to his own novel, a so-so pastiche that has little to do with 
Chandler's style or characters. Although he tucks in references to Los Angeles 
streets like favors at a child's birthday party, Parker fails to convey any 
real sense of place -- or time. 
</P>
<P>
It's never clear whether this tale of blackmail, murder and bigamy among the 
very rich is supposed to be unfolding in 1959 or 1989. More significantly, 
Parker lacks Chandler's flair for the memorable turn of phrase. The result is a 
feeble exercise in literary grave-robbing, about on a par with the various 
attempts to "continue" the adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The evil that men do 
may live after them, but "Poodle Springs" suggests that the good writing is oft 
interred with their bones. Charles Solomon

CRIMINAL PURSUITS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mystery writers are nothing if not prolific. Longshot (G. P. Putnam's Sons: 
$19.95; 320 pp.) is the 30th book by Dick Francis and his 28th thriller in 28 
years, a line that began with "Dead Cert" in 1962. The format varies little: A 
youngish man, usually but not always single, suffers great danger and often 
severe pain and torture in his frequently inadvertent entanglement in a plot 
involving horses. (Francis once explained that he changed heroes each time 
because introducing the new man gave him 20 to 30 pages of material.) 
</P>
<P>
The miracle is that the formula has worked so well so often, and "Longshot" is 
one of his best. 
</P>
<P>
John Kendall writes guidebooks on how to survive various wilderness perils. 
(From the start you can guess what's coming.) He is temporarily between 
royalties and takes a commission to do a biography of an imperious horse 
trainer, which keeps Francis on course, so to speak. Kendall never has ridden, 
which represents a nice change in the usual proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
There are complications immediately: jealous riders, one bordering on the 
malevolent; family tensions; a missing stablegirl found dead; a fiendishly 
clever assault on the life of Kendall himself, who is subsequently wounded by 
an arrow and left for dead, hoist by his own survival literature. 
</P>
<P>
Francis offers two of those major set-pieces of sustained narrative of survival 
against odds that are his specialty and that no one does better. All his 
characters, friend and foe alike, are sharply portrayed. The owner's eccentric 
but sympathetic teen-aged son is a particularly good invention. The motivations 
to crime are credible and not arbitrary. 
</P>
<P>
James Lee Burke has emerged as one of the very best American crime writers. His 
"Black Cherry Blues" won the Mystery Writers of America's Edgar Award as the 
best crime novel of 1989. A Morning for Flamingos (Little, Brown: $18.95; 294 
pp.) may be even better, a poetically expressed merging of melodramatic events 
and sensitive problems of character and relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Burke's continuing protagonist, Dave Robicheaux, is a New Orleans plainclothes 
detective who is also a recovering alcoholic. He and a partner are escorting 
two prisoners to the state penitentiary to be executed. One is a vicious killer 
named Jimmie Lee Boggs, the other a young black, Tee Beau Latiolais. Robicheaux 
knows the boy's grandmother, who swears he's innocent. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs engineers an escape, wounding Robicheaux badly and taking the boy with 
him. Later, Robicheaux, bent on revenge, agrees to infiltrate a Mafia gang as 
the embittered ex-cop he is. Boggs is a hit man for the gang. The paths 
converge, but unpredictably. Like Robicheaux, the gang boss is a Vietnam 
veteran, and there is an ironic kinship of a shared bitterness. Robicheaux's 
interior battle is with his own fears and his loss of self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
The quality of the prose in which a crime story is told is not inevitably a 
part of the lure of the form. Strong plots will survive the most lumpish 
language. But the pleasure of reading Burke's prose is immense, and his 
evocations of place, atmosphere and especially the interior states of the 
remarkable Robicheaux are not to be dismissed as mere genre writing. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Kellerman, trained as a child psychologist and author of books in the 
field, logically enough created as his crime-series protagonist a child 
psychologist, Alex Delaware, who like Kellerman lives and works in Southern 
California. His link to crime cases usually is Detective Milo Sturgis, who is 
black and gay and who may, in the new Delaware, Time Bomb (Bantam: $19.95; 468 
pp.), have ended his career on the force with a deeply satisfying right cross 
to the chin of a smug and smarmy racist superior. 
</P>
<P>
A young woman, armed with a rifle and apparently intending to assassinate a 
local politician during a visit to an elementary school, is instead shot dead 
by a handy policemen as she hides in an outbuilding on the school grounds. 
Delaware, called in to handle and calm the children's fears, finds that nothing 
is at it seems. 
</P>
<P>
No one quite believes that the girl, an eccentric loner as she was, was capable 
of murder. The politician sends a peculiar con-man psychologist to tend the 
children, despite Delaware's presence. The attractive woman who is the school 
principal is under pressure and then endangered. 
</P>
<P>
The girl's death proves to be the sore point of a large and nasty conspiracy of 
right-wing racism and sexual and political corruption. Kellerman gives full 
value in vivid confrontations, violence, romance and a reaffirmation of 
traditional values of fairness and justice. His previous book, "Silent 
Partner," was a best-seller, and it's fair and just to suspect that this expert 
thriller will be, too. 
</P>
<P>
The best novel winner at this year's Bouchercon meeting in London was Sarah 
Caudwell's The Sirens Sang of Murder, whose softcover edition has just been 
published here (Dell: $3.95; 277 pp.). Caudwell is a London barrister, now 
writing full-time. Her urbane style is very much in the tradition of Michael 
Innes and Nicholas Blake, and the novelty is that it is never clear whether her 
protagonist, an Oxford don ambiguously named Hilary Tamar, is male or female. 
</P>
<P>
The foreground figures all are tax lawyers, including a Wooster-like figure 
named Cantrip who goes off to a Channel Island on a case and encounters murder 
and other unpleasantnesses, which he delineates in amusing Telexes to the home 
office. Amusing is, I think, the word. 
</P>
<P>
Sniper's Moon (Bantam: $18.95; 370 pp.) is a strong first novel by Carsten 
Stroud. Not surprisingly, it has been optioned for a movie, to which its hard- 
driving and violent plot commends it. Stroud's man, Frank Keough, is a 
professional sniper with the NYPD. The work is getting to him; his life is a 
shambles and then somebody begins zeroing in on him. He is finally a pariah on 
and off the force, a Hitchcockian innocent (very relatively speaking) trying to 
figure out what's happening, the ultimate clues residing with his estranged 
father, a retired detective. It's a powerful police procedural by a man who 
knows the force. 
</P>
<P>
Another excellent first novel is The Last Frame (Carroll &amp; Graf: $16.95; 
211 pp.) by Jim Wright, a New Jersey newspaper editor. His rumpled hero is 
modelled on -- and the book written in memory of -- Arthur (Weegee) Fellig, 
Wright says. Weegee, wandering Manhattan with a police radio and a Speed 
Graphic, captured a harsh portrait of a city's violent deaths and sad losers. 
Wright's Will Carver also is a death-chasing loner who himself begins to be 
chased by death when he buys a used camera (his own are often in pawn) 
containing a blackmailer's film. Wright obviously knows photography, 
photographers, crime, the police and Manhattan, and he tells a breathless, 
nonstop tale about an oddly likable eccentric who is a born survivor. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about plot triumphing over prose. Kyotaro Nishimura is a Japanese crime 
writer specializing in what might be called railway procedures, stories about 
trains and travel. The Mystery Train Disappears (Dembner/Norton: $16,95; 246 
pp.), as translated by Gavin Frew, is flatly written, I suspect reflecting the 
original. Mystery trains, presumably popular in Japan, offer the customers an 
undisclosed destination, rather than a crime en route. This one disappears with 
400 passengers aboard, a neat trick in any week. A billion yen in ransom is 
paid, but the crooks seem one step ahead of the police and the railway 
officials at every junction. 
</P>
<P>
Nishimura's story does rocket along, and for once a mystery really is a 
mystery. How, you ask, could it be done, and Nishimura, who knows his sidings 
and his abandoned stations, shows you.

PSYCHING OUT A KILLER; 
</P>
<P>
CALIFORNIA STREET BY DONNA LEVIN (SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER: $18.95; 290 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Digby Diehl, Diehl is the book columnist for Playboy magazine and treasurer 
of PEN Center USA West. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donna Levin's lively and engrossing San Francisco murder mystery/love triangle 
might be described as "a California detective novel." But it is a sensitive and 
introspective book, certainly nothing that could be called hard-boiled. 
</P>
<P>
The sleuth is Dr. Joel Abramowitz, a sometimes inept, self-doubting, endearing 
33-year-old psychiatrist who mentally toys with the possibilities of every 
situation he confronts with maddening ambivalence. But it is precisely his 
ongoing quick-minded neurotic analysis that makes this book so fascinating. We 
experience the story through Joel's mind, and he calls on his psychoanalytic 
training to seek out hidden motivations, posit alternate theories and scenarios 
of behavior for other characters, and creatively piece together the clues in 
this puzzle. The subtle subtext is that a mystery writer does exactly the same 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
"California Street" is an innovative variation on the detective-novel formula, 
sort of a psychological whydunit in addition to a whodunit. Interestingly 
enough, such variations are getting to be the rule rather than the exception. 
From Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes tales to Robert Parker, mysteries have had a 
large element of the howdunit. But lately, the other interrogatives have 
dominated. Taking us to Japan or New Mexico, mystery writers such as James 
Melville (the Inspector Otani series) and Tony Hillerman have pioneered the 
wheredunit. With settings as disparate as 12th-Century monasteries and 1940s 
L.A. jazz joints, writers such as Ellis Peters and Walter Mosley take us on 
whendunit time trips to solve crimes. (I suppose you could also argue that 
Stephen King and Clive Barker often are writing whatdunits.) 
</P>
<P>
Although readers of P. D. James, Martha Grimes and Dick Francis are howling 
that these writers are straying away from that cozy, traditional English 
drawing room down the rocky path of the whydunit, the author who has shaped the 
psychological mystery novel into an art form is Jonathan Kellerman. In fact, 
the opening of "California Street" almost reads like a Kellerman novel. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Abramowitz receives an urgent telephone call asking him to rush to a nearby 
day-care center: A mentally disturbed woman has a child on the roof. Joel 
rescues the child and agrees to help the woman as a patient. The scene also 
introduces us to Margot Harvey, heir to the San Francisco Courier fortune, 
founder of the Playground Daycare Center and wife of his former college 
roommate and best friend, Ted Harvey. Joel is in love with Margot, guilty about 
his relationship with her alcoholic husband, and completely manipulated by her: 
</P>
<P>
"They were a threesome, a dynamic which persisted even when he (Joel) brought 
other women along. Joel hadn't ignored the obvious Oedipal implications of 
that, he'd just -- well, ignored them. Ignored, for example, how he didn't mind 
going to the theater alone with Margot, if it was something Ted didn't want to 
see. After all, he went to games alone with Ted, didn't he? And sometimes a 
cigar was just a cigar." 
</P>
<P>
This trick cigar full of Oedipal surprises blows up in Joel's face when Margot 
asks him to run away with her; a new client of his, a beautiful young model, is 
found dead; Margot disappears but seems to be in contact with the deranged 
woman from the roof of the day-care center; and Ted admits that he was having 
an affair with the dead model. Joel races ahead of the police to track down 
Margot and finds the evidence stacking up against Ted in the murder case. He 
turns to his girlfriend and fellow therapist Denise for support, which turns 
out to be complicated because they are sleeping together and she's in love with 
him -- and he's not sure whether, perhaps, in some way, he's in love with her, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Joel's incessant internal dialogue with himself, a running commentary 
on everything that impinges on his awareness, appears to be a distraction for 
the reader, a background chatter that keeps us from concentrating on the plot. 
But, quickly enough, it becomes clear that we've just got to sit back and enjoy 
being in the mind of Dr. Joel Abramowitz, being party to all his anxieties, 
obsessions,and mental gymnastics. This book is at least as much about Joel's 
mind as it is about the external events. Of course, we are also victims of his 
errors and interpretations, too, which reminds us that there is a novelist 
telling the story behind the protagonist telling the story. 
</P>
<P>
Levin handles the complicated twists and turns so deftly that the more rapidly 
the plot unravels, the more involved you become with Joel's wildly careening 
life. She sends us roaring into a denouement that Hitchcock would have loved 
and ties up the numerous loose thematic threads with dramatic flair. 
</P>
<P>
This is an inventive novel that is thought-provoking and fun to read, and 
Levin, who previously wrote "Extraordinary Means," is a novelist to keep high 
on your reading list.

Starr Ranch Field Trip -- The Sea and Sage chapter of the National Audubon 
Society will host a field trip to the Starr Ranch Audubon Sanctuary in Ronald 
W. Caspers Wilderness Park on Saturday. The trip is open to the public, and 
those wishing to participate should meet in the parking lot adjacent to the 
park's entrance booth at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The trip will include exploring various side roads and canyons in the Bell 
Canyon area of the park. Participants should wear good walking shoes and bring 
binoculars and their lunch. 
</P>
<P>
There is a $2 entrance fee at the park, which is at 33401 Ortega Highway in an 
unincorporated area north of San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Rarities -- It is fall migration time for birds and the best time of year to 
spot lost migrants, which are birds that are rare to the area that have gotten 
lost. According to the Sea and Sage Chapter of the National Audubon Society, 
the number of migrants that have been spotted in the county has been sporadic. 
However, there have been three first-recorded sightings of birds thus far. 
</P>
<P>
An immature blue-footed booby was found Sept. 7 in a weakened condition in a 
Huntington Beach schoolyard. Although taken to a local bird rehabilitation 
center, it died a few days later. 
</P>
<P>
An adult white-rumped sandpiper was spotted by Doug Willick and Loren Hays at 
San Joaquin Marsh in Irvine on Sept. 9 through 13. Also at the marsh, Richard 
Webster spotted a garganeySept. 12. There have been less than 10 sightings of 
this duck, a Eurasian variety of the teal, in California. 
</P>
<P>
Other rarities spotted in September include a white-face ibis at San Joaquin 
Marsh and San Diego Creek; seven greater white-fronted geese and a sage 
thrasher, also at the marsh; a juvenile stilt sandpiper at the Santa Ana River 
in Anaheim; a bay-breasted warbler at Huntington Central Park and a hooded 
warbler at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Other warblers seen in the county include four Virginia, a Tennessee, several 
palm, blackpoll and black-and-white varieties, and a redstart.

It's over! My mailbox can breathe a sigh of relief. My phone may stop ringing. 
TV advertisements can return to showing the latest soap powder, well, for a

</P>
<P>
We tried to make informed decisions, we voted, and now we wait and see the 
results. 
</P>
<P>
I am curious, now that it's all over, will either Tom Umberg or Curt Pringle 
ever write to us? And after receiving four calls on Tuesday from the Umberg 
camp, and three from the Pringle camp, urging us to vote, I wonder if we'll 
ever hear from them again. 
</P>
<P>
Now we've got to decide what to do with all the "slate mail" we received over 
the past weeks. I know, let's recycle it. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, I've got an even better idea. . . . Let's parcel it all up and send it 
back where it came from. Maybe then they will know what it's like to have to 
dig through piles of unwanted garbage just to find your real mail. If all the 
people in Orange County who received this political hate mail sent it back, 
maybe the politicians might get the message it's not wanted.

Gary and Jeanne Neumann of Irvine ("Finally . . . It's a Boy!" Oct. 17) deny 
that their daughters resent the new baby boy whose sex was determined by the 
sperm selection technique.

<P>
It makes one wonder, though, when they expressed such obvious relief what their 
real motives were. Daughters have been devalued all through history, and their

Move over Santa Ana. You no longer hold the crown for the most heartless city 
in the Southland.

<P>
You earned it fair and square when you initiated the official harassment of the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was your intolerance condoned, but your people were apparently proud 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
However, you must give the trophy to Santa Barbara. Not only is it bigger and 
richer, but it proved its heart is colder and harder than the diamonds worn by 
its fine ladies. Its new sleepless law gives it the championship as the city 
that most vigorously displays its inhumanity to man.

I hope its citizens will drop a note to their City Council telling them how 
proud they are to possess their new title.

SULTAN SWATTED 2 OFF 'BIG TRAIN' JOHNSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 1924 Babe Ruth-vs.-Walter Johnson game at Brea may have been the Bambino's 
only local appearance, but it wasn't his "only Orange County home run" 
(Newswatch, Oct. 31). 
</P>
<P>
He belted two of them out of the park that day, both off hometown son "Big 
Train" Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing spooky about this Halloween treat was Johnson, who was touched 
for eight runs and eight hits (four of them homers), before being pulled in the 
fifth. No slouch as a pitcher, Ruth southpawed his smoke ball through the whole 
game, giving up just one homer in the ninth to Bob Meusel for the 12-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, the exhibition was a fund-raiser for the Anaheim Elks' Christmas 
charity. So Brea lost twice.

MAGIC KINGDOM'S PRICE HIKES DECRIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In addition to concern regarding the Persian Gulf crisis, coupled with reckless 
spending, less-than-honest politicians and myriads of assorted gripes and 
complaints regarding government and spending, I was more than a little incensed 
when I read "Disney Hikes Ticket Prices to Disneyland" (Oct. 30). 
</P>
<P>
The price for one family of four to enter the park -- only -- is $100, let 
alone the cost of food and beverage and parking. 
</P>
<P>
What child does not want to go to Disneyland and enjoy the frivolity and 
wonderland that it offers, and how many blue-collar workers can afford their 
children this privilege at such a cost? 
</P>
<P>
Their admitted net income for 1989 was $703.3 million. How can their executives 
sleep nights? I am certain that Walt Disney, in his conception of this 
wonderland, would want every child to experience his dream and not be reserved 
for the privileged middle and upper class. 
</P>
<P>
If the general public, particularly those with young children, try staying away 
from the park for a while, perhaps those powers that be will realize this 
price-gouging is unwarranted.

LUDWIG WITTGENSTEIN; THE DUTY OF GENIUS BY RAY MONK (THE FREE PRESS, A DIVISION 
OF MACMILLAN: $29.95; 654 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Judith Gingold, Gingold, a journalist, has studied philosophy with students 
of Wittgenstein. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein may be the most famous obscure intellectual 
of the century. It's hard to imagine a more unwilling celebrity than this 
profoundly serious man who shunned publicity and devoted his life to the 
pursuit of clarity. Since his death in 1951, however, he has emerged as one of 
the best known and least comprehended contemporary thinkers. 
</P>
<P>
He's the "Mad Genius" as sent by Central (European) Casting, the savior of 
British philosophy or its trivializer. He is passionate, tormented, 
misunderstood, a man so singular that virtually everyone who ever knew him, 
from Bertrand Russell to the man who delivered peat to his cottage in Ireland, 
remembered and wrote about him. He reminded one student of "the Norse God 
Baldur, blue-eyed and fair-haired, with a beauty that had nothing sensual about 
it." Others were less enthusiastic. One young boy told his diary: "Witkinstein 
(sic) is an impossible person everytime you say anything he says 'No No that's 
not the point.' " 
</P>
<P>
He was equally hard on himself, a master of self-laceration who often 
contemplated suicide. Though baptized a Catholic, he was of Jewish descent, a 
heritage he sometimes blamed for his moral and mental inadequacies in language 
reminiscent of "Mein Kampf." (Curiously, Hitler and Wittgenstein attended the 
same school for a year; there's no evidence that they met.) 
</P>
<P>
Though he wrote constantly, he revised constantly too; most of his work has 
been posthumously published, and generates hundreds of scholarly books and 
articles each year. A recent bibliography lists nearly 6,000 items. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the academy, Wittgenstein is a cultural presence to many who know him 
only as a name, or the inspiration for a sizable body of music, art and 
writing. His words have been rendered in dance and neon; there's even a poem 
about his lecturing style. He's a character in several novels and is mentioned 
in plays, on public television and by Woody Allen. 
</P>
<P>
For those who want to learn more about his fascinating figure, Ray Monk's 
thoughtful and accessible biography, intended for the general reader, 
encompasses the life and work in a single narrative, illuminating the values 
implicit in both. 
</P>
<P>
The book's subtitle, "The Duty of Genius," is taken from Otto Weininger's "Sex 
and Character," which Monk believes is the source of many of Wittgenstein's 
attitudes toward life and love. Weininger, a misogynist and anti-Semite, 
believed it was man's duty to conquer the flesh and to discover and realize his 
genius -- or to kill himself. A Jew and a homosexual, Weininger shot himself at 
23, in the house where Beethoven, his hero, died. Suicide greatly increased 
both Weininger's moral prestige and the sales of his book, which Wittgenstein 
read as an adolescent. 
</P>
<P>
Though Monk's is not the authorized biography, he enjoyed the complete 
cooperation of Wittgenstein's literary executors, who permitted him to quote 
from previously unpublished material, including diary entries written by 
Wittgenstein in code about his homosexuality, which has been the subject of an 
unseemly, irresistible debate. Much of Monk's research will be new to even avid 
readers of Wittgensteiniana; those unacquainted with Wittgenstein's philosophy 
will find Monk's explanations helpful and unforbidding, if not exactly a piece 
of Sacher torte. 
</P>
<P>
 Wittgenstein was born in Vienna in 1889, the eighth child of an extremely 
rich, cultivated and ill-fated family. His father was a steel magnate on the 
order of Andrew Carnegie, his mother a musically gifted patron of the arts. 
Three of the brothers committed suicide; the fourth, Paul, continued his career 
as a concert pianist despite the loss of an arm in World War I. 
</P>
<P>
The world is fin de siecle Vienna, the city Karl Kraus called "the research 
laboratory for world destruction"; the birthplace of Nazism and Zionism; the 
Vienna of Sigmund Freud, Arnold Shoenberg and Adolph Loos. Like these 
contemporaries, Wittgenstein broke away from the historical outlook in his 
field: His linguistic analysis is a radical departure in philosophy, analogous 
to psychoanalysis in psychiatry, atonality in music and functionalism in 
design. 
</P>
<P>
Wittgenstein's originality seemed especially pronounced in the alien culture of 
England, where he spent much of his working life. He went to Manchester as a 
young man to study engineering, then took up aeronautics and, finally, 
mathematical logic at Cambridge with Bertrand Russell, who introduced him to G. 
E. Moore, John Maynard Keynes and other Apostles of Bloomsbury. 
</P>
<P>
At the outbreak of World War I, Wittgenstein enlisted in the Austrian 
artillery, hoping to die or to change his life. He fought on the Russian front, 
was decorated for bravery and taken prisoner in Italy. When he was captured, he 
had with him the manuscript of the "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus," the only 
one of his books published in his lifetime, a work as magisterial as its title 
suggests, and best understood (if at all) in the context of Wittgenstein's war 
experience. Here Monk's approach is particularly apt, revealing, as 
Wittgenstein insisted, that "the point of the book is ethical." 
</P>
<P>
So was the point of Wittgenstein's life, which shows the strong ethical views 
that the "Tractatus" says cannot be spoken of, only made manifest. He sought a 
life of Christian virtue as conceived by Tolstoy, and seems to have taken the 
ideals of poverty, chastity and duty more seriously than his mentor. He 
relinquished his fortune to his sisters and brother and lived very simply, in 
barely furnished rooms, once telling a friend: "I don't care what I eat as long 
as it's the same thing every day." Since sex and love were incompatible, he was 
tortured by sexual guilt over even fantasized transgressions. 
</P>
<P>
He grew to see philosophy as his duty, and devoted his life to it after he 
returned to England in 1929 and began the work which culminated in the 
"Philosophical Investigations," the most polished and influential of the later 
books. 
</P>
<P>
Here Wittgenstein rejects the classical view of philosophy as the attempt to 
answer ultimate questions. Philosophical problems, he writes, are not about 
matters of ultimate (or any kind of) fact; they arise from linguistic 
misunderstandings, from mistakes in logical grammar. The job of the 
philosopher, as he sees it, is to "command a clear view of the use of our 
words." Philosophy is not a theory, but an activity, "a battle against the 
bewitchment of our intelligence by language." 
</P>
<P>
Consider a question like "What is time?" Because it is similar in form to "What 
is dew?," it misleads us into looking for something we can point to or 
describe, as we would the dew. Thus the endless philosophical theories about 
the nature of time. The Wittgensteinian philosopher resists the "craving of 
generality." Instead of theorizing about time, he minutely examines how the 
word is used (how we teach it to children, for example), and is no longer 
puzzled. He can teach it, he can measure it, he can be on it. The meaning of 
time is not some mysterious metaphysical something, it is, roughly, its use in 
the language. 
</P>
<P>
Philosophy is a therapeutic enterprise, Wittgenstein believed, a set of related 
techniques for dispelling linguistic confusions. This approach seemed 
exhilarating and effective to many philosophers; others, including Bertrand 
Russell, condemned it as a cop-out, a refusal to think seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy persists. In "The Legacy of Wittgenstein," Anthony Kenny 
suggests that "Wittgensteinian philosophy as opposed to Wittgensteinian 
scholarship has not made progress, and some of the philosophical gains we owe 
to (him) seem in danger of being lost." 
</P>
<P>
During his lifetime, Wittgenstein was a cult figure in philosophy. In his 
lectures, he struggled visibly with his thoughts, which often were expressed in 
imaginative questions and aphorisms. His gestures and intonations were 
distinctive and much imitated; he feared, perhaps rightly, that his influence 
was destructive to his students. To him, the profession of philosophy was "a 
living death," but all he was fit for; he urged his students to take up 
something useful, like medicine or manual labor, especially if they were 
serious philosophers. (He himself worked as a gardener in a monastery, and as a 
hospital orderly in London during World War II.) Philosophy was worthless 
unless it helped you to live a morally better life. 
</P>
<P>
Wittgenstein did not permit "tourists" at his lectures, and the chances are, 
that's you. Monk is considerably more hospitable, yet travelers should expect a 
fairly rigorous journey. Nevertheless, the book is engrossing, especially if 
read in conjunction with Wittgenstein himself. In Monk's comprehensive account, 
certain features of Wittgenstein's thought seem remarkably current. He is 
deeply suspicious of science and scientism, more interested in differences than 
in similarities, against abstraction and for contextual interpretation. And 
always, spirit prevails. 
</P>
<P>
So what if he's tough. There are worse ways to spend the fin de siecle.

COVER STORY: PROPER P.G. WODEHOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
HUMOR NOVELIST'S 'JEEVES AND WOOSTER' WILL BE SEEN IN 5-PART PBS SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"I believe there are only two ways of writing a novel," Pelham Grenville 
Wodehouse once said. "One is mine, making the thing a sort of musical comedy 
without music and ignoring real life altogether; the other is going right down 
deep into life, and not caring a damn." 
</P>
<P>
Never did an author describe his work so well. The adventures of Bertie Wooster 
and his valet, Jeeves, ignored real life about as totally as it could be 
ignored over the course of six decades when they filled several novels and 
dozens of short stories, and they have now become a PBS five-part series, 
"Jeeves and Wooster," commencing this week on "Masterpiece Theatre." 
</P>
<P>
P.G. Wodehouse (pronounced Woodhouse) died in 1975 at the age of 93 after an 
astonishingly prolific life. He published 96 books, several of them collections 
of his 300 short stories. He collaborated on 16 plays and 28 musical comedies 
and for Hollywood wrote the scripts of six movies. In his early years he wrote 
under so many pseudonyms that his total output will probably never be known. 
</P>
<P>
Wodehouse sold his first article before he was 20 and received 10 shillings and 
sixpence for it. He was typing away on yet another novel, "Sunset at 
Blandings," on the morning of the day he died. It was published posthumously in 
its unfinished form, with his notes for the rest. The world could never get 
enough of Wodehouse. 
</P>
<P>
Wodehouse also wrote the lyrics for dozens of songs, and one of them, Jerome 
Kern's "Bill," has become a standard. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it was the Wooster-Jeeves stories that assured Wodehouse immortality, read 
and re-read in English and translated into many foreign languages. The 
character who became Bertie Wooster made his first appearance as Reggie Pepper 
in a story in 1915 and appeared under his own name in a collection titled "The 
Man With Two Left Feet" two years later. By then, Wodehouse was already in his 
mid-30s and well-known as a humorous writer for both print and the theater. 
</P>
<P>
The stories seem to arise in the expansive late Edwardian world of the British 
upper-class, in Mayfair flats and country houses, a time when rich and foolish 
young men thought about work without ever actually having to do any, and the 
young women they cavorted with were equally rich and foolish but also beautiful 
and desirable. 
</P>
<P>
It was, of course, a world Wodehouse created -- and sustained in its airy 
distance from the real world -- through two wars and a global Depression. 
</P>
<P>
Jeeves apparently got his name from a cricket player Wodehouse admired. His 
traits as the consummate valet, shrewder by several dozen IQ points than his 
amiably feckless master, may have been partly inspired by the displaced valet, 
Ruggles, of Harry Leon Wilson's American novel, "Ruggles of Red Gap." 
</P>
<P>
Bertie Wooster, his brain a vast interstellar vacuum crossed by occasional 
wandering notions, was a dazzling invention, a farcical enlargement of every 
foolish chap, serenely self-assured with precious little justification. 
</P>
<P>
"I always imagine I am writing for a cast of actors," Wodehouse once said. 
(Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie in the PBS series must surely delight in the lines 
he created for them to say.) 
</P>
<P>
Wodehouse indeed worked with a kind of stock company of generic characters: 
Young Men, Young Women, Imperious Aunts, Pompous Aristocrats, all linked of 
course to The Perfect Servant. 
</P>
<P>
Wodehouse, who was Plum or Plummie to his friends, had what sounds to American 
ears like a dreadful early life. He was sent back to England at age 2 from Hong 
Kong, where both his parents were colonial workers, to be raised by two aunts 
(neither said to be the model for the awful Aunt Agatha in the TV series) and 
by a grandmother. He saw his parents every four years on their home leave. 
</P>
<P>
He was shipped off to boarding school at 5, thence to a public school and 
Dulwich College. Wodehouse and his wife spent the last 30 years of his life in 
Remsenberg, Long Island, and he became an American citizen in 1955. But he 
continued to write of the musical comedy version of England that he had created 
and populated so well. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth only a few weeks 
before his death. 
</P>
<P>
Here are airtimes for "Jeeves and Wooster" on various PBS stations.

<P>
In 1969, a revolutionary children's television series went on the air. This 
experimental show on public television, free from commercial advertising, was 
designed to help young children make the transition from home to pre-school by 
teaching them basic skills, ranging from their ABC's to how to share. 
</P>
<P>
The program starred an ensemble cast of all ages and racial backgrounds, a big 
yellow bird the size of the Empire State building and a couple of guys named 
Bert and Ernie. The show was, of course, "Sesame Street." 
</P>
<P>
After a myriad of awards, more than 2,500 episodes and millions of 25-year-olds 
who still know the words to "One of These Things is Not Like the Other," 
"Sesame Street" is launching its 22nd season on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The show is now seen in 11 million households weekly in the United States and 
by millions more in 80 countries. In addition, there are 15 versions produced 
in other languages. 
</P>
<P>
During the new season, the program will begin a series of lessons about race 
relations, add two new cast members (teen-agers Eugene Byrd and Alexis Cruz) 
and will have to cope with the death (last May 16) of Jim Henson, the father of 
the Muppets. 
</P>
<P>
Executive producer Dulcy Singer, who came aboard as associate producer during 
the first season, discussed the "Sesame Street" philosophy with Lauren Lipton. 
</P>
<P>
Has the series changed much over the years? 
</P>
<P>
In the early sessions, the emphasis was on the basic skills -- alphabet, 
numbers, relational concepts, geometric shapes. We still teach all that, but 
the curriculum has grown enormously with the times. Just to give you an 
example, it includes health, computers, Spanish culture, ecology, geography, 
and this year we're adding race relations. 
</P>
<P>
Are there any issues you would shy away from? 
</P>
<P>
The basic tenet is to show things in a positive way. We have to consider that a 
lot of our audience watches alone, so we wouldn't want to do anything that 
might frighten a child. 
</P>
<P>
You try to teach in a general way about taking responsibility for yourself. 
</P>
<P>
Right -- in a way that would be appropriate for a 3-year-old. I mean, we have 
to consider how very young our audience is. Our target audience is 2 to 5, but 
we hear that children start watching even younger these days. 
</P>
<P>
I read recently that the average child watches 15,000 hours of television and 
spends 11,000 hours in school, through high school. That must be a 
mind-boggling responsibility to have. 
</P>
<P>
I guess the reality is that kids are going to watch that much. Certainly we 
don't encourage that much watching. In fact, on the show, we try to encourage 
reading. 
</P>
<P>
Would you prefer to have a child not watch "Sesame Street" and have the parents 
read to him or her and be very attentive? 
</P>
<P>
Of course, we would like both. In the ideal situation, a parent would talk 
about what they saw on the air and would do follow-up activities. 
</P>
<P>
Is "Sesame Street" geared toward a specific audience? 
</P>
<P>
I guess our target audience is the so-called disadvantaged child, the child who 
perhaps doesn't enter school with the same skills that a middle-class child 
might because his parents don't have time to read to him. So that's the child 
we think of, but other kids watch. 
</P>
<P>
Who decides what your curriculum is going to be? Are you involved with that? 
</P>
<P>
Our director of research works with child development specialists. The show is 
tested continually. They take it out and show it to kids in day-care settings 
and at home and talk to them about, first of all, what holds their interest, 
and also what they did and didn't understand. 
</P>
<P>
This information is fed back to the producers and writers on a regular basis. 
It goes on all the time -- we actually only tape for four months of the year, 
but the rest of the year is spent on all these other things. 
</P>
<P>
You decided this season to focus a bit more on race relations. What made you 
decide this was the year to do that? 
</P>
<P>
We've always dealt with race relationships. With the diversity of people on the 
show, it's certainly been implicit. But we also felt that it was time to be 
more explicit. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly we are not going to solve the problems of race relations, but we all 
feel that if it's a drop in the ocean it's better than nothing. Also, we get to 
our audience when they're so young so we have a better chance of influencing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
How is Jim Henson's death going to affect the show? 
</P>
<P>
We have a tape library that's very extensive, so you'll continue to see Ernie, 
Kermit, Guy Smiley and all those characters (that Henson voiced) on every day 
as much as they were. As to what we'll do in the future, that decision hasn't 
been made yet. But Jim's characters are alive on "Sesame Street." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The first episode of the 22nd season of "Sesame Street" airs on Channel 28 
Monday at 10 a.m., Tuesday at 9 a.m. and Wednesday at 8 a.m.; on Channel 15 
Tuesday at 9 a.m.; on Channel 50 Tuesday at 4 p.m., and on Channel 24 Monday at 
2:30 p.m. and Tuesday at 11:30 a.m.

These exceptional photographs were taken in Paris in 1938 and 1939, near the 
end of Joyce's life. 
</P>
<P>
Two extraordinary series of images, one of the author revisiting Sylvia Beach 
and Adrienne Monnier at the celebrated Shakespeare and Company bookstore, the 
other with his beloved grandson at the home of his son, Giorgio, on the rue 
Scheffer, seem to summarize the writer's life. Despite his popular image as a 
distracted, untidy man, Joyce appears elegant, even dandified in silk bow ties, 
patterned socks and rings. But he also looks frail, weary and otherworldly: The 
later pictures clearly show a man approaching death. Gisele Freund's studies 
form a revealing portrait of this elusive genius. Charles Solomon

wandering notions, was a dazzling invention, a farcical enlargement of every 
foolish chap, serenely self-assured with precious little justification. 
</P>
<P>
"I always imagine I am writing for a cast of actors," Wodehouse once said. 
(Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie in the PBS series must surely delight in the lines 
he created for them to say.) 
</P>
<P>
Wodehouse indeed worked with a kind of stock company of generic characters: 
Young Men, Young Women, Imperious Aunts, Pompous Aristocrats, all linked of 
course to The Perfect Servant. 
</P>
<P>
Wodehouse, who was Plum or Plummie to his friends, had what sounds to American 
ears like a dreadful early life. He was sent back to England at age 2 from Hong 
Kong, where both his parents were colonial workers, to be raised by two aunts 
(neither said to be the model for the awful Aunt Agatha in the TV series) and 
by a grandmother. He saw his parents every four years on their home leave. 
</P>
<P>
He was shipped off to boarding school at 5, thence to a public school and 
Dulwich College. Wodehouse and his wife spent the last 30 years of his life in 
Remsenberg, Long Island, and he became an American citizen in 1955. But he 
continued to write of the musical comedy version of England that he had created 
and populated so well. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth only a few weeks 
before his death. 
</P>
<P>
He was admired by writers as various as Hilaire Belloc, Evelyn Waugh and Isaac 
Asimov, and by readers in at least 80 countries. But he remained indefatigably 
modest, refering to his writing as "my stuff," and, so his friends thought, 
pouring his self-deprecating views of himself into, of all people, Bertie 
Wooster. 
</P>
<P>

Q&amp;A: DULCY SINGER: 22 YEARS ON A CHANGING 'STREET' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lauren Lipton

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1969, a revolutionary children's television series went on the air. This 
experimental show on public television, free from commercial advertising, was 
designed to help young children make the transition from home to pre-school by 
teaching them basic skills, ranging from their ABC's to how to share. 
</P>
<P>
The program starred an ensemble cast of all ages and racial backgrounds, a big 
yellow bird the size of the Empire State building and a couple of guys named 
Bert and Ernie. The show was, of course, "Sesame Street." 
</P>
<P>
After a myriad of awards, more than 2,500 episodes and millions of 25-year-olds 
who still know the words to "One of These Things is Not Like the Other," 
"Sesame Street" is launching its 22nd season on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The show is now seen in 11 million households weekly in the United States and 
by millions more in 80 countries. In addition, there are 15 versions produced 
in other languages. 
</P>
<P>
During the new season, the program will begin a series of lessons about race 
relations, add two new cast members (teen-agers Eugene Byrd and Alexis Cruz) 
and will have to cope with the death (last May 16) of Jim Henson, the father of 
the Muppets. 
</P>
<P>
Executive producer Dulcy Singer, who came aboard as associate producer during 
the first season, discussed the "Sesame Street" philosophy with Lauren Lipton. 
</P>
<P>
Has the series changed much over the years? 
</P>
<P>
In the early sessions, the emphasis was on the basic skills -- alphabet, 
numbers, relational concepts, geometric shapes. We still teach all that, but 
the curriculum has grown enormously with the times. Just to give you an 
example, it includes health, computers, Spanish culture, ecology, geography, 
and this year we're adding race relations. 
</P>
<P>
Are there any issues you would shy away from? 
</P>
<P>
The basic tenet is to show things in a positive way. We have to consider that a 
lot of our audience watches alone, so we wouldn't want to do anything that 
might frighten a child. 
</P>
<P>
You try to teach in a general way about taking responsibility for yourself. 
</P>
<P>
Right -- in a way that would be appropriate for a 3-year-old. I mean, we have 
to consider how very young our audience is. Our target audience is 2 to 5, but 
we hear that children start watching even younger these days. 
</P>
<P>
I read recently that the average child watches 15,000 hours of television and 
spends 11,000 hours in school, through high school. That must be a 
mind-boggling responsibility to have. 
</P>
<P>
I guess the reality is that kids are going to watch that much. Certainly we 
don't encourage that much watching. In fact, on the show, we try to encourage 
reading. 
</P>
<P>
Would you prefer to have a child not watch "Sesame Street" and have the parents 
read to him or her and be very attentive? 
</P>
<P>
Of course, we would like both. In the ideal situation, a parent would talk 
about what they saw on the air and would do follow-up activities. 
</P>
<P>
This season you have a lot of celebrities coming on board. Why did you choose 
to go after Julia Roberts, for example? Or Bo Jackson? 
</P>
<P>
They're currently very popular stars, and the notion of having guest stars is 
again so that older brothers and sisters and parents will watch "Sesame Street" 
and talk about it (with the younger child). Studies show that if a child 
watches with the parent and talks about what's on the program, he gets more out 
of it. Also, the older people in the family have control of the dial 
</P>
<P>
Is "Sesame Street" geared toward a specific audience? 
</P>
<P>
I guess our target audience is the so-called disadvantaged child, the child who 
perhaps doesn't enter school with the same skills that a middle-class child 
might because his parents don't have time to read to him. So that's the child 
we think of, but other kids watch. 
</P>
<P>
Who decides what your curriculum is going to be? Are you involved with that? 
</P>
<P>
Our director of research works with child development specialists. The show is 
tested continually. They take it out and show it to kids in day-care settings 
and at home and talk to them about, first of all, what holds their interest, 
and also what they did and didn't understand. 
</P>
<P>
This information is fed back to the producers and writers on a regular basis. 
It goes on all the time -- we actually only tape for four months of the year, 
but the rest of the year is spent on all these other things. 
</P>
<P>
You decided this season to focus a bit more on race relations. What made you 
decide this was the year to do that? 
</P>
<P>
We've always dealt with race relationships. With the diversity of people on the 
show, it's certainly been implicit. But we also felt that it was time to be 
more explicit. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly we are not going to solve the problems of race relations, but we all 
feel that if it's a drop in the ocean it's better than nothing. Also, we get to 
our audience when they're so young so we have a better chance of influencing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
How is Jim Henson's death going to affect the show? 
</P>
<P>
We have a tape library that's very extensive, so you'll continue to see Ernie, 
Kermit, Guy Smiley and all those characters (that Henson voiced) on every day 
as much as they were. As to what we'll do in the future, that decision hasn't 
been made yet. But Jim's characters are alive on "Sesame Street." 
</P>
<P>
The first episode of the 22nd season of "Sesame Street" airs on Channel 28 
Monday at 10 a.m., Tuesday at 9 a.m. and Wednesday at 8 a.m.; on Channel 15 
Tuesday at 9 a.m.; on Channel 50 Monday at 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., and on Channel 24 
Monday at 2:30 p.m. and Tuesday at 11:30 a.m.

WOMAN RESCUED JUST AS PLANE IGNITES; 
</P>
<P>
CRASH: BYSTANDERS IN PACOIMA YANK WING OFF AND PULL UNCONSCIOUS PASSENGER TO 
SAFETY. ALL THREE ABOARD SURVIVE.

Bystanders who saw a light plane crash on a Pacoima street tore a wing off the 
craft and pulled an unconscious woman from the wreckage only moments before it 
burst into flames Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"They're real heroes," said Sgt. Bruce Cowan of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Foothill Division. "If these people hadn't taken that lady out of 
the back of the plane, she would have been killed." 
</P>
<P>
The plane had just taken off from Whiteman Air Park, less than a mile away, 
when the pilot radioed the tower that the engine had died, said Steve 
Christmas, tower manager. "There was nothing we could do except watch it 
crash." 
</P>
<P>
The red-and-white Cessna clipped an air conditioner on the roof of a plastics 
container company, lost a wheel, spun 180 degrees and then pancaked onto the 
pavement in the 13500 block of Paxton Street, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ann Hanley, 37, of La Crescenta, was discovered unconscious in the back 
seat of the plane after rescuers helped a male passenger get out, witnesses 
said. The pilot walked away from the wreckage, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who raced to the scene was Leonard Archibeque, a 29-year-old 
electrical helper for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, who was 
driving on Paxton Street. 
</P>
<P>
"After it hit the building and spun around, it just teetered on the edge before 
it slid off and crashed," Archibeque said. "I parked right away and helped them 
get the woman out. If we had gotten there a minute later, she would have been 
dead. That fire was boiling real good." 
</P>
<P>
Tyler Harwood, 29, of Northridge was asking directions at a nearby gas station 
when the plane crashed. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't get her out, so 15 to 20 of us let out a war cry and ripped the 
wing off by yanking it upward," said Harwood. "It left a big hole and we 
dragged her out. Two seconds later, we heard this loud pop and the whole plane 
was in flames." 
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Shariff, 42, of Panorama City, who had been riding his bicycle to meet 
a friend, said the bystanders had little time to plan their rescue. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't something we discussed -- we just saw the cabin filling with thick, 
black smoke and the flames getting closer and we acted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the three occupants of the plane were seriously injured, said Holly 
Lyons, a nursing supervisor at Holy Cross Medical Center. Hanley suffered a 
concussion. Passenger John R. Wilson of Burbank suffered a broken ankle while 
the pilot, Harold Leroy Wessel, 53, of Sun Valley, was treated and released for 
minor cuts, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wessel told police that he was flying to Mammoth for the weekend, Lt. Maurice 
Rubio said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the 9:22 a.m. crash is under investigation by the Federal Aviation 
Adminstration and the National Transportation Safety Board, FAA spokesman Tony 
Ina said. 
</P>
<P>
Seven fire engine companies put out the blaze in eight minutes, Los Angeles 
Fire Department Battalion Chief Bob Teachenor said. 
</P>
<P>
A one-block stretch of Paxton Street, where the burned-out plane lay in the 
eastbound lane, was closed all day between San Fernando Road and Sutter Avenue, 
police said.

ELECTION'S OVER BUT NOT FOR ABSENTEE BALLOT COUNTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Governor-elect Pete Wilson is appointing his transition team. Dianne Feinstein 
is licking her wounds. And political pundits are already looking ahead to the 
1992 presidential election, in which both of California's U.S. Senate seats 
will be up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
But on a sunbaked Saturday morning in the City of Commerce, more than 80 
employees of the absentee voter section of the Los Angeles County 
registrar-recorder's office were still plugging away, continuing their count of 
absentee ballots from Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been working since the end of September," sighed section head Steve 
Logan. "We haven't been off since then. I don't even know anymore how many 
weeks that is." 
</P>
<P>
With a strong push from the Republican and Democratic parties, absentee 
balloting has never been so popular in California. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, an estimated one in five voters mailed in their completed ballots or 
dropped them off at polling places on Election Day. In Los Angeles County 
alone, more absentees were cast this fall -- more than 250,000 -- than the 
total number of ballots cast last week in either Delaware, Alaska, Vermont, 
Wyoming or South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
Without question, voting at home is a convenience for those who prefer not to 
wait in line at the polls. But the arduous task of tabulating those ballots is 
a logistical nightmare for Logan and his counterparts in 57 other counties 
throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles and other large metropolitan areas, officials say the absentee 
count may not be completed for at least five more days. Until then, the final 
outcome will likely remain uncertain in the race for state attorney general, in 
which Democrat Arlo Smith holds a razor-thin 28,000-vote lead over Republican 
Dan Lungren. Statewide, as many as 300,000 to 500,000 absentees were still 
being tabulated. On Saturday morning, Logan and his staff, most of them 
temporary employees, were busy examining some of those ballots -- one by one -- 
to guard against fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Valerie Barrera, dressed in a Jon Bon Jovi sweat shirt, sat at a computer 
optics terminal, comparing signatures on absentee envelopes to those on voter 
registration cards. 
</P>
<P>
The state-of-the-art procedure, in which Barrera used a nine-digit code to 
punch up video images of the registration signatures, is far speedier than the 
old-fangled method of poring over microfilm records. But it remains a 
time-consuming process, with each worker capable of checking a maximum 1,500 
signatures daily. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way for the absentee ballots to be counted more quickly," Logan 
emphasized, "is for people to get them in here at least a week before the 
election." 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the warehouse-sized office, Sarah Leonard thumbed through 
absentee envelopes dropped off at polls across the county Tuesday. State 
election law says the ballots can be returned to any polling place, but they 
must be delivered by close relatives or the voters themselves, except in 
emergency situations. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard set aside dozens of ballots in which the deliverers did not signify 
their relationship to the voter. They will not be counted. 
</P>
<P>
On a table nearby were 13,000 absentees that have been ruled invalid. These 
were mail-in ballots that did not arrive at the registrar's office until after 
the 8 p.m. deadline on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
Some bore Los Angeles and Marina del Rey postmarks from as early as Nov. 1 or 
2. Unfortunately, said Logan, the state election code says the delivery time, 
and not the postmark, is what counts. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing we can do under the law," he said. "It's an unfortunate 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Postal Service spokesman Larry Dozier could not explain the delivery 
delay. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry that it did happen and I'll bring it to our operations people and 
see if we can find out what happened," Dozier said. 
</P>
<P>
With political party observers monitoring the ballot count, the absentee staff 
will continue their overtime work today and on Veteran's Day on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Smith campaign has raised questions of possible absentee vote fraud, 
charging that the Republican Party may have signed up voters throughout the 
state for absentee ballots without their consent. 
</P>
<P>
But Logan said he has received few complaints from Los Angeles voters, although 
he conceded that his staff no longer compares the signatures on absentee ballot 
applications with those on the completed absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the first election we have not done it," he said. "But the California 
election code allows us to do it this way and it's more cost effective." 
</P>
<P>
Logan, whose staff processed 134,000 absentee ballots before Election Day, is 
hoping to have the remaining 130,000 to 140,000 ballots tabulated by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But due to a federal court ruling Thursday, they won't rest easy even then. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, they must begin mailing out absentee ballots for a special Board of 
Supervisors election in January to replace retiring Supervisor Pete Schabarum. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe someone will get 51%," said the weary but hopeful Logan. "Then (at 
least) we won't have to worry about a runoff."

HUNTING HEIRS TURNS ON A DEED; 
</P>
<P>
PROPERTY RIGHTS: TWO MEN HELP DESCENDANTS OF THOSE WHO GAVE LAND TO RAILROADS 
AND COMMUNITIES TO TRY TO WIN BACK OWNERSHIP OR GET A SETTLEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
John Percival Jones and Robert S. Baker sat down in 1875 with a map of their 
massive land holdings, including Rancho San Vicente y Santa Monica, to design a 
model city. 
</P>
<P>
The two land barons -- Jones, a silver magnate and U.S. senator from Nevada, 
and Baker, a Rhode Islander lured west by the Gold Rush -- plotted a town with 
ample parks, schools and a railroad line that they hoped would spur growth. 
</P>
<P>
To assure that their plan for Santa Monica and neighboring communities was 
carried out, the two partners deeded the land with restrictions that required 
railroad entrepreneurs and public officials to give the properties back to them 
-- or their descendants -- if they ever closed down the parks, rail lines and 
other improvements the men envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
Jones and Baker probably could not have imagined that, in planning their dream 
town, they were laying the groundwork for two of their descendants to create a 
cottage industry. 
</P>
<P>
Today, more than a century later, Jones' grandson and Baker's 
great-great-nephew have used restrictions such as the ones in those historic 
deeds to lay claim to property all over Los Angeles County. John Percival 
Farquhar, 78, and Ricardo Johnson, 43, have invoked the historical deeds in 
lawsuits on behalf of themselves and hundreds of heirs of other early 
Californians. 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, the unlikely partners -- Farquhar, a gray-haired former research 
chemist, and Johnson, a tanned erstwhile tennis instructor -- have created an 
unusual and sometimes lucrative endeavor that combines equal parts history, 
genealogy and property law. 
</P>
<P>
They have brought in at least $680,000 over the last four years and opposing 
lawyers say they do not know of any other firm that does the work of Farquhar 
&amp; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
The pair's latest lawsuit moved forward last month, when a Torrance Superior 
Court judge rejected a motion by the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway 
Co. that sought to overturn their claim, on behalf of 88 heirs, to a 2.1-mile 
railroad right of way in Manhattan Beach. The railroad abandoned the property 
in 1983 and the town uses the land as a park and running path. 
</P>
<P>
Farquhar and Johnson see themselves as defenders of the rights of small-time 
property heirs against powerful railroads and government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Their opponents say that the partners' work added about $2 million to the price 
West Hollywood paid to buy a median strip along Santa Monica Boulevard and 
clouds attempts by Manhattan Beach to permanently dedicate the abandoned 
railway line as a park and running path. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and Farquhar do not respond to such criticisms. In fact, they do not 
like to talk about their business at all. 
</P>
<P>
"We have put a lot of time and money into this," Johnson said in a previous 
interview. To talk would be "like giving away secrets. We have our own way of 
doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Farquhar and Johnson's disdain for publicity is reflected in their work. They 
do not have an office or employees. They do not advertise. They seem to thrive 
in the obscurity of the County Hall of Records, recorder's office and 
courtrooms, where most of their work is done. 
</P>
<P>
Farquhar's introduction to the field came in 1957, when he and other Jones and 
Baker heirs fought for compensation for property near Santa Monica City Hall 
that the city had condemned. Jones and Baker's descendants said they should be 
paid because the property had been set aside exclusively for a Pacific Electric 
Railway station. 
</P>
<P>
The litigation over the property where the Santa Monica courthouse stands 
dragged on for 15 years, until the city agreed to pay a $150,000 settlement in 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I first got in touch with all the Baker family," Farquhar said. 
"And we have worked together since." 
</P>
<P>
While the two families had sold the vast tracts of land they owned on the 
Westside, they believed that many of the portions granted to railroads and 
government agencies might have to be returned because of reversionary rights. 
</P>
<P>
Farquhar and Johnson come upbon their cases in a variety of ways: They learned 
of one while talking to a friend and another while researching a historical 
book on beach communities they say they are writing. 
</P>
<P>
Once they become interested in a property, the partners check deeds in the 
County Hall of Records to learn whether the land was to return to the original 
owners if it ceased to be used as specified. If such deed restrictions exist, 
they begin to track down the early owner's heirs -- using local histories, 
birth and death records and interviews with family members. 
</P>
<P>
Heirs, who usually know nothing of the historical deeds, give Farquhar and 
Johnson up to a one-half share in the properties in exchange for their research 
and pursuit of the claims. 
</P>
<P>
That was essentially the formula that led to the pair's most successful case, 
in which they claimed ownership of much of a 1.1-mile-long strip of the Santa 
Monica Boulevard median in West Hollywood on behalf of more than 100 heirs. 
</P>
<P>
The county moved to condemn the property in 1982, after Southern Pacific 
Railroad closed its freight line there. Shortly after its incorporation in 
1984, West Hollywood voted to buy the condemned property. But after Farquhar 
and Johnson intervened, the dispute over how much the land was worth dragged on 
until this year. 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood had been permitted to pay a total of $110,000 for three sections 
of right of way when no heirs appeared to argue that they were worth more. 
</P>
<P>
Then Farquhar and Johnson learned about the case. 
</P>
<P>
In less than two months of searching in 1986, court documents say, they tracked 
down the descendants of three historical landowners. Their lawyer argued that 
the heirs had not been properly notified of the condemnation and a Los Angeles 
Superior Court judge reopened the case. 
</P>
<P>
Settlements of $250,000 and $328,750 were negotiated for two of the families. 
The third case went to trial. A jury last spring ordered West Hollywood to pay 
the plaintiffs $1,139,000 for their shares of the land. 
</P>
<P>
Farquhar &amp; Associates received half of the two settlements and about 
one-third of the jury award, court records show, for a total of about $680,000. 
</P>
<P>
The heir hunters declined to discuss the settlements. 
</P>
<P>
David Swall, a cotton farmer in Tulare, Calif., believes he is typical of the 
more than 100 descendants of Elizabeth Swall who shared in the $328,750 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
He had heard that his great-great-grandmother had given a piece of her land in 
West Hollywood to the Pasadena and Pacific Railway Co., but he was not much 
interested. Then Farquhar and Johnson paid him a visit. 
</P>
<P>
"I was initially a little bit suspicious," Swall said. "They seemed 
mysterious." 
</P>
<P>
Swall and other descendants decided they did not have the time or legal 
expertise to fight the case, so they signed over half their interest to 
Farquhar &amp; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
When the case was settled, family members around the country received shares 
ranging from $215 to $5,664, depending on how closely related they were to the 
family matriarch, Swall said. He collected $350. 
</P>
<P>
"That probably about paid my phone bill," Swall chuckled. "We spent lots of 
time on the phone with relatives talking about the case. It was very 
interesting. We ran into some parts of the family we didn't even know existed." 
</P>
<P>
A trial date is to be set next spring in the lawsuit they filed against the 
Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. and Manhattan Beach. The partners 
claim that the heirs they represent should have received title to the right of 
way when when the city abandoned it in 1983. The plaintiffs have said that if 
they win their property claim, they will challenge zoning that requires the 
100-foot-wide strip of land to remain open space. 
</P>
<P>
In August, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a Los Angeles federal 
judge in rejecting a claim by Jones and Baker heirs that they owned a 2.1-acre 
section of the Veterans Administration property in Brentwood that the federal 
government had attempted to sell to a developer as surplus. An 1888 deed for 
300 acres said the land should be "permanently maintained" as a veterans home. 
The court ruled that the historical deed did not clearly state that the 
property should revert to the original owners in the event that the land 
changes hands. 
</P>
<P>
In February, Farquhar reached an out-of-court settlement with the Southwest 
Museum in Mt. Washington over ownership of an oil painting, "Mount Hood in 
Oregon." The museum proposed selling the painting, valued at up to $4 million, 
but Farquhar said it was a gift from his grandmother and should be returned to 
him if the museum wanted to let it go. Southwest Museum still holds the 
landscape by Albert Bierstadt. 
</P>
<P>
Farquhar and Johnson are mum about future projects. 
</P>
<P>
But when discussing the history of the Westside, Farquhar recalled that his 
family donated much of Santa Monica Canyon to the state for operation of a 
forestry station. The state sold the land to businessmen without the family's 
permission, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That is something that I might have to look into, one of these days," Farquhar 
said, smiling demurely. "Property rights are being taken away," he said. "And 
all these old-timers . . . lose out."

BRADLEY WANTS TOUGHER LAPD OVERSEERS; 
</P>
<P>
POLICE: THE MAYOR IS CREATING AN ACTIVE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS THAT WILL PROBE 
DEPARTMENT MISCONDUCT AND STAND UP TO CHIEF GATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a series of abrupt moves over the last month, Mayor Tom Bradley has begun 
reshaping the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners into an activist body 
that will challenge the way the Police Department is run, according to his 
aides and several City Council members. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley and a growing number of council members say they want a commission that 
will tackle tough policy matters, aggressively investigate police misconduct 
and evaluate the performance of Chief Daryl F. Gates. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor wants an active, progressive Police Commission," said Deputy Mayor 
Mark Fabiani, "and he's determined to appoint commissioners who will take 
seriously the responsibility of directing the department." 
</P>
<P>
An activist commission would be a marked departure from the style of the 
current five-member panel that oversees the 8,400-member Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
In a session typical of its weekly meetings, the commission on Tuesday met for 
20 minutes, taking up routine matters like granting parade permits and 
canceling security alarm licenses -- all at a time when controversies are 
swirling around Gates and his department. 
</P>
<P>
While commissioners were silent, Bradley was moving quickly. He demanded an 
investigation of possible police impropriety in the so-called "39th and Dalton" 
drug raid, ordered a management audit of the Police Department and, in an 
unusual public exchange of insults, he criticized Gates for having made "dumb" 
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
In rapid succession, the mayor replaced one commissioner with a longtime 
political ally, attorney-lobbyist Dan Garcia, and then announced that 
Commission President Robert M. Talcott would be resigning Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley periodically shakes up the city's numerous commissions, sometimes 
because they drift too close to the officials they are supposed to monitor, 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, shortly after Gates was sharply criticized for suggesting that 
casual drug users should be shot, the Police Commission, rather than 
questioning him in public about his remark, gave him a round of applause to 
mark the anniversary of his 41 years of service. 
</P>
<P>
If the commission begins to assert greater authority, sources said, the 1990s 
could be a time of turmoil for a city agency long accustomed to enacting its 
own agenda with little interference. 
</P>
<P>
For Gates, the changes could be a watershed. A range of critics within and 
outside the department have said that after 12 years as chief, Gates sometimes 
appears uninterested in the details of his job. Sources said privately that the 
commission will expect Gates to become more deeply involved in managing the 
department or step aside. 
</P>
<P>
Gates, however, recently expressed confidence in his job at a press conference 
at Parker Center, and stressed that he was not going to leave the department 
until he was ready to go. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a well-run department," the chief said. "I manage well. I may not do a 
lot of things. I may have a big mouth. But I know how to manage a police 
department. I know how to manage an organization like this." 
</P>
<P>
He also denied allegations that he had "co-opted" the current police 
commissioners into supporting his policies. "What's wrong with the fact that 
we're getting along?" he asked. "What's wrong with the fact that the Board of 
Police Commissioners and I are seeing eye-to-eye?" 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, the commission forced several changes in the Police Department, 
such as a crackdown on police intelligence-gathering activities and a revision 
of the department's shooting policy. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the last decade, the panel has been reluctant to buck the 
department on a number of controversial issues. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, after months of negotiations sought by the homosexual community, the 
commission recommended changes in department policy to encourage active 
recruitment of homosexuals, including advertisements in gay and lesbian 
publications. However, Gates objected and the policy was never enforced. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, the commission balked at conducting an inquiry into the propriety of 
Gates' public pronouncement that casual drug users "ought to be taken out and 
shot." Bending to pressure from the City Council, the commission changed course 
and promised an inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
And, the commission took a back seat to the department in ongoing 
investigations stemming from a drug raid two years ago during which police 
officers trashed a number of apartments near 39th Street and Dalton Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Outgoing president Talcott said in a recent deposition that he had only a 
"general idea" of the scope of the 39th and Dalton investigations. His lack of 
knowledge surprised some critics, who noted that scores of officers have been 
disciplined, four face criminal charges and a civil lawsuit against the city 
and the Police Department goes to trial in U.S. District Court next month. 
</P>
<P>
If such a police scandal were to surface in the future, the commission would be 
expected to investigate what conditions or management failures in the 
department might have encouraged such police activity, said one source familiar 
with the mayor's hopes for the revamped commission. 
</P>
<P>
Talcott, an attorney who has headed the panel for five years, said in his 
deposition that some of his "important" duties as a police commissioner were 
attending Police Academy graduations and funerals of police officers. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times earlier this week, he said his commission work 
was a part-time job that paid only $50 for each weekly meeting he attended. He 
said it is difficult for commissioners to follow every aspect of the daily 
operations of the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
"We are citizen-soldiers, so to speak," he said. "We are there to assist as 
public-minded individuals in the operation of city government. It may not be 
the most effective way, but it's better than most cities that have no interplay 
or interaction between the public and the bureaucracies." 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Yagman, a lawyer and longtime police critic who is suing the city and 
the Police Department in the 39th and Dalton drug raid, said he was amazed at 
how little the commissioners seemed to know about the highly controversial 
case. 
</P>
<P>
"This Board of Police Commissioners is essentially window dressing," he said. 
"They sit on their hands and do nothing over there. They are the equal of Nero 
who fiddled while Rome burned." 
</P>
<P>
Even City Councilman Richard Alatorre, who as chairman of the council's Public 
Safety Committee has been an advocate for the department, agrees that the 
commission needs to change. "I think it's clear that the mayor is interested in 
. . . appointing people who are going to be more aggressive in oversight," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics say the commission knows only what department management wants it 
to know, and acts accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
George Aliano, president of the Police Protective League, said the commission 
under Talcott ignored the needs of rank-and-file officers. He said the 
commission was particularly bad at ruling against officers who filed grievances 
against their supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like we didn't exist," he said. "There was no response from him. 
Rarely -- I can't even remember a single time -- when a grievance was ever 
approved at the police commission level. 
</P>
<P>
"He never tried to resolve confrontations," Aliano added about Talcott. "He 
turned a deaf ear on everything." 
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, the union president said the new commission members should be 
more open-minded to the problems of officers. 
</P>
<P>
"We need somebody who makes decisions and gives us an answer as to why they 
make a decision," he said.

CHARGERS WARY OF THE BRONCOS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway will be wearing an oversized high-top 
shoe today with a plastic shield to protect his painful big toe. 
</P>
<P>
Elway, however, could take the snap from center leaning on crutches with a cast 
on each leg, and the Chargers wouldn't be fooled. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't pay attention to the hype," Charger safety Vencie Glenn said of 
speculation over Elway's status for today's game at San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium. "They're talking about his toe, his mobility, his shoes and none of it 
has anything to do with that arm. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd have to tell me his arm is in a sling, and I'd have to see it and know 
he's not going to play before I'd believe it. Every year we play Elway and it's 
this or that: There's something with his shoulder, he's not accurate, the 
people in Denver are down on him. 
</P>
<P>
"Come on, man, the dude is competitive and he's going to make plays. As soon as 
you start believing Elway isn't this and Elway isn't that, he'll kill you." 
</P>
<P>
Elway completed eight of 10 passes for 88 yards, including a three-yard 
touchdown pass to Vance Johnson, to help the Broncos take a 16-0 halftime lead 
over the Minnesota Vikings last week. However, Elway had to leave the game with 
a strained arch and injured big toe, and Minnesota came back to win, 27-22. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos listed Elway as questionable for today's game, but after pushing 
himself through practice this week, Elway announced he would start. 
</P>
<P>
"John Elway will find a way to be the best he can be for their team," Charger 
linebacker Leslie O'Neal said. "I'm gonna tell you something, this is why I 
have a lot of respect for Elway. 
</P>
<P>
"My rookie year I hit him on an interception, and next time they get the ball, 
he peels back and chops me. From that point I got a lot of respect for him. I 
go and hit him whenever I can, and I always watch over my shoulder and consider 
him a blocker." 
</P>
<P>
Although Elway is the target for each defense he plays against, he has started 
89 of the team's last 91 regular-season games. He has started 13 games against 
the Chargers in his eight-year career, and Denver has won nine. 
</P>
<P>
Denver has won six of the past seven meetings with the Chargers. Its only loss 
came in last season's finale, when the playoff-bound Broncos rested Elway for 
the final three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"This game right here could be their season," Charger strong safety Martin 
Bayless said. "If they lose this one, they are 3-6 and it's all uphill for 
them. So I'm sure Elway will be ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his team's success against the Chargers when he has started at 
quarterback, Elway has thrown only eight touchdown passes. He has been 
intercepted 16 times. He also has been sacked 30 times. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chargers are starting to play the football that I thought they were going 
to be playing all year," Elway said. "Knowing how physical they are on defense 
and having their offensive come along, I thought they were going to be one of 
the teams to beat right out of the gate." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers (4-5) have won three of their last four games. They have a chance 
to win three games in a row for the first time since an eight-game winning 
streak during the strike year of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past we'd win two games in a row and then subsequently lose five in a 
row," cornerback Gill Byrd said. "People say we've turned the corner with two 
straight wins, but this becomes a pivotal game for both teams. Six losses makes 
it hard to remain in contention in this division." 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos (3-5) would be 8-0 if the NFL allowed games to be played only for a 
half. They have outscored the opposition 131-70 in the first half, but have 
been outgunned 135-56 in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Denver has lost four of its last five games, and in those four defeats, it has 
given up an average of 30 points. The Broncos have been forced to start rookie 
safety Alton Montgomery at left cornerback and lost pass rushers Alphonso 
Carreker and Jim Szymanski with leg injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason we're 3-5 is because we haven't been able to protect those leads," 
Denver Coach Dan Reeves said. "That's something we've done very well in the 
past." 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos' problems continued to mount this week. They lost versatile running 
back Steve Sewell with a separated shoulder in a weight room mishap and placed 
him on injured reserve. They also listed reserve running back Sammy Winder as 
doubtful with a foot injury. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Humphrey, however, has recovered sufficiently from an ankle injury to be 
listed as probable. Humphrey did not play against the Pittsburgh Steelers, and 
had only three carries against the Indianapolis Colts. But after the Broncos' 
bye, he came back to gain 92 yards in 21 carries against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
"The Broncos have been down before; this isn't the first time they've had to 
win," Glenn said. "They've gone to the Super Bowl (four) times. As long as John 
Elway is the quarterback and Dan Reeves is the head coach, you can never count 
them out." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers have been on a roll, but have their own injury woes. Running back 
Marion Butts, who leads the NFL in rushing, has a deep thigh bruise, and his 
understudy, Rod Bernstine, has a tender hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn, who intercepted an Elway pass in 1987 and returned it a club-record 103 
yards, has been battling a hamstring injury the past month. Bayless has missed 
the last two games with a calf injury, and was unsure late in the week if he 
would be able to play. 
</P>
<P>
"The Broncos have a lot of pride or they wouldn't have been where they have 
been in three of the last four years," Charger defensive coordinator Ron Lynn 
said. "They have to be thinking it's either time for them to get going or do 
something else. 
</P>
<P>
"At this stage, nobody is out of it, but this is a big game for both teams. I'm 
anxious to see how we'll respond under conditions when a game has great 
meaning. And this one does."

AZTECS FIND SOME WAY OVER THE RAINBOWS; 
</P>
<P>
SDSU: MCGWIRE PASSES FOR 429 YARDS AND TWO TOUCHDOWNS, AND AZTECS HOLD ON AFTER 
HAWAII SCORES 22 FOURTH-QUARTER POINTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
If it had been an election and San Diego State a candidate for office, the 
Aztecs would have been putting together their acceptance speech along about, 
oh, midway through the third quarter of Saturday night's game with Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that was the problem. Life with the Aztecs is never that easy. Give them 
a lead, they'll sometimes try to give it right back. Hawaii discovered that in 
a wild, offensive, typical game in front of 20,450 at San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs eked out a victory, 44-38, but only after watching a 34-16 lead 
dwindle to six with 2:17 left. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Hawaii attempted an onside kick, and the Aztecs (4-4, 3-2) 
weren't completely over the Rainbows (5-4, 2-3) until the ball nestled snugly 
in the arms of freshman tight end Garrett Ford. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztec defense almost put together two consecutive weeks of solid play, 
which was Coach Al Luginbill's goal all along this week. And SDSU came 
oh-so-close. But Hawaii, quiet most of the first three quarters, suddenly 
reared up and kicked the Aztecs for 22 fourth-quarter points. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the Aztecs needed every bit of quarterback Dan McGwire's 
season-best, 429-yard effort. McGwire completed 23 of 36 passes, two for 
touchdowns. His 23 completions moved McGwire into second place -- past Brian 
Sipe -- on the SDSU career completion list. He now has 437, one more than Sipe 
and still well behind record-holder Todd Santos' 910. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU receivers repeatedly ran at will through Hawaii's secondary. Jimmy Raye 
caught 10 passes for 209 yards and a touchdown, and Patrick Rowe caught six for 
155 -- giving him 100 or more yards receiving for the sixth consecutive game. 
That is one short of SDSU's record, and two shy of the NCAA record. Rowe 
entered the game leading the nation with an average of 120.4 yards receiving 
per game. 
</P>
<P>
But maybe the most significant number of the night was T.C. Wright's 17-yard 
touchdown run with 6:51 to play. It put the Aztecs ahead, 43-24. Little did 
anyone know at that point that it would be a touchdown the Aztecs needed. 
</P>
<P>
"I never felt comfortable with the lead," Luginbill said. "That is a team that 
has come back and won a lot of football games over the last two years. When you 
get somebody down, you've got to go for the throat." 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii scored three touchdowns and a two-point conversion in the fourth 
quarter. Quarterback Garrett Gabriel passed 10 yards to Dane McArthur, 17 to 
Larry Kahn-Smith and 23 to Jeff Sydner for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Hawaii was back after things looked dim at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii Coach Bob Wagner said this week he was concerned with the turnover 
ratio. The Aztecs led the Western Athletic Conference entering Saturday's game 
with a plus-nine in turnover margin, and Wagner said the Rainbows would have a 
hard time winning if they had even one more turnover than the Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
Astute observation. By halftime, the Aztecs built a 28-16 lead, and two of 
their four touchdowns came after recovering Hawaii fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztec taking the bows was sophomore defensive back Robert Griffith. Twice 
in the first half he made his way into the Hawaii backfield and separated 
Gabriel from the ball. 
</P>
<P>
The Rainbows took the opening kickoff and drove 35 yards, to the SDSU 34, in 
seven plays, their option attack clicking. Then, on third and seven, Gabriel 
was between a pass and a run in the Rainbow backfield -- it looked like he 
wasn't yet sure what he was going to do -- and all of a sudden he turned 
around, and there was Griffith. The ball popped loose, and Andy Coviello 
pounced on it. Garrett, meanwhile, had to be helped from the field. He 
returned, nursing a sore hip, later in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Three minutes later, McGwire found Raye wide-open over the middle for a 44-yard 
touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
That made it 7-0, Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the half, with 4:03 remaining, Griffith forced another fumble. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs were ahead at the time, 21-10, and it was similar to the first in 
that he reached the backfield and smacked Gabriel. This time, linebacker Lou 
Foster landed on the ball, and the Aztecs took over at the Hawaii 19. 
</P>
<P>
It took them five plays to move to the Hawaii one, where both Curtis Butts and 
Larry Maxey were stopped on runs. On fourth-and-one, Luginbill sent Andy Trakas 
in to kick a field goal . . . but the Aztecs called a timeout before the play. 
</P>
<P>
On second thought, Luginbill had decided to go for it. McGwire strapped on his 
helmet and ran back out. He handed off to Butts . . . touchdown. Aztecs, 28-10. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aztec Notes 
</P>
<P>
Defensive back Marlon Andrews led the Western Athletic Conference with 12 
passes broken up entering Saturday's game. . . . Also entering the game, 
defensive back Robert Griffith led the Aztecs with 54 tackles. . . . Touch of 
class: When Hawaii quarterback Garrett Gabriel went down near the Aztec 
sideline early in the first quarter, SDSU Coach Al Luginbill and trainer Brian 
Berry walked out to check on him. Gabriel injured his left hip and left with 
13:04 remaining in the quarter. He returned eight minutes later. . . . It was a 
rough first quarter all around. SDSU offensive lineman Nick Subis suffered a 
rib injury, and defensive lineman Pio Sagapolutele injured his left ankle. 
Sagapolutele returned a couple of minutes later; Subis missed the rest of the 
game.

UNSER ON THE MARK TO WIN POLE 
</P>

DEL MAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Al Unser Jr., reached his trailer Saturday afternoon, he was besieged by 
autograph seekers. Little wonder, Unser has become the biggest thing ever at 
the International Motor Sports Assn. Camel Grand Prix of Greater San Diego at 
the Del Mar Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Unser led an assault on the track record that had the previous mark dropping 
like a bad heavyweight boxing champion. 
</P>
<P>
Unser's new Chevrolet-powered Spice SE90P, which he is driving for Julian 
Randles' Spice USA team, roared around the 1.62-mile course at an average of 
94.828 m.p.h., nearly four miles per hour faster than Wayne Taylor's 1989 mark 
of 90.831 in a Pontiac Spice. It took Unser 1 minute 0.744 seconds to negotiate 
the tricky 10-turn course. He clocked 1:01.080 on his first qualifying lap 
(94.303 m.p.h.) 
</P>
<P>
"I missed the downshift into Turn 1 (on the first lap) and it upset me, so I 
decided to just go for it," Unser said. 
</P>
<P>
Go for it he did, along with everyone else in the single-car qualifying that 
determined the top eight starting positions for today's 2 p.m. race. 
</P>
<P>
Seven drivers bettered Taylor's mark, and the only driver who didn't -- 
Nissan's Chip Robinson -- had unofficially broken it earlier in the day in open 
qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was first in single-car qualifying and clocked 91.330 m.p.h. Then 
James Weaver began the progression of topping Taylor's mark. In a Porsche 962C, 
he clocked 92.250. Then Martin Brundle, driving a Jaguar XJR-10, ran 92.704. 
Then Jaguar teammate Davy Jones ran 92.861, a speed which would withstand 
challenges by Taylor in a Chevy Spice (92.398) and Rocky Moran in a Toyota 
Eagle (92.135 before crashing). 
</P>
<P>
GT championship points leader Geoff Brabham broke Jones' mark at 93.199, then 
Unser treated that like Rodney Dangerfield. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if a car can be perfect," Unser said, "but as close as you can 
get is Spice at Del Mar." 
</P>
<P>
This is the first pole for the Indy car champion in 19 Camel GT Series career 
starts. However, Unser won't be in the car when the green flag drops. Spice 
teammate John Cochran, the second-fastest driver to Unser during Friday's 
practices, will start. 
</P>
<P>
In the race within the race, Robinson's quest for catching Brabham for the GT 
championship did not get any easier. Brabham is starting in a Nissan GTP ZX-T 
on the first row alongside the Spice car; Robinson is starting outside in the 
fourth row on a course that is so tight, passing is difficult and dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Brabham needs to finish 70% of the race to win the $150,000 GT championship, 
but he plans to take the cautious road. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if you're in the lead, you can never be feel too comfortable because you 
don't know what's around the next corner," Brabham said. 
</P>
<P>
That was evident Saturday when Moran and Fermin Velez crashed, and in Friday's 
GTO/GTU qualifying when Chuck Kendall hit the wall at Turn 4 and was plowed 
into -- in high gear -- by Pete Halsmer and Don Swanson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Auto Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
ESPN will televise today's GTP race live at 2 p.m. . . . The pole position for 
today's 30-minute Barber-Saab Pro Series (12:30 p.m.) was earned by series 
champion Rob Wilson, the race's defending champion, who broke 1989 GT champion 
Robbie Buhl's qualifying track record. Wilson's 81.202 m.p.h. beat Buhl's 
81.020. Wilson set an IMSA record with his seventh pole of the year, bettering 
Buhl's mark of six. Although he has raced only three years in the Barber-Saab 
Series, Wilson set a record for career victories (10) and poles (10). He is 
expected to move on to the Aussie Roo Camel GTP in 1991. . . . Alongside Wilson 
on the front row is Encinitas' Nick Kunewalder (80.215 m.p.h.), whose previous 
best start had been fourth. Three-time race winner Johnny Robinson of England 
is starting third. . . . Parker Johnstone set a track record (85.194 m.p.h.) in 
Camel Lights qualifying. The race runs concurrent with the GTPs. . . . Camel 
Lights champion Tomas Lopez will not be competing; Fermin Velez crashed the 
Buick Spice during practice.

OILERS TAKE ANOTHER FALL, 7-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky could only shake his head in amazement after the Kings had beaten 
the Edmonton Oilers, 7-4, Saturday night at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Since the summer day in 1988 when he came to the Kings in the blockbuster trade 
with Edmonton, Gretzky had dreamed of the day his new team would be better than 
his old. 
</P>
<P>
But nineteen points better? 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of November? 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it, nobody is more surprised than we are," said Gretzky after the 
Kings' third consecutive victory, before a sellout crowd of 16,005, moved them 
back into the Smythe Division lead with a 12-4-1 record and 25 points, one more 
than the Calgary Flames. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the Smythe spectrum sits the Oilers, 2-11-2 and losers of 
nine in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"This has got to be the best team to ever lose nine games," Gretzky said. "It's 
a long year, believe me. I wouldn't count them out by any means." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's game was punctuated by a match penalty assessed against Luc 
Robitaille for cross-checking Craig Simpson from behind in the second period. 
Referee Kerry Fraser ruled that Robitaille deliberately attempted to injure 
Simpson. That meant immediate expulsion from the game and a possible suspension 
after a league hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have the puck when he hit me," Robitaille said, "so I hit him back. I 
cross-checked him on the shoulder. I've been cross-checked like that 10 times 
in a game." 
</P>
<P>
Although Tony Granato was the Kings' offensive leader with two goals and four 
points, the Oilers had the early lead. Unchecked, Joe Murphy skated into the 
crease and backhanded the puck over the glove of goalie Kelly Hrudey five 
minutes into the game. It was Murphy's fourth goal. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third time this season the Oilers have scored first on the road. 
They have lost all three games. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings tied the score, 1-1, before the period ended. When Dave Brown gave up 
the puck in his own zone, Dave Taylor controlled it and passed to Todd Elik, 
who fed Robitaille. From the left side, Robitaille lifted the puck over goalie 
Bill Ranford's glove at 16:01 for his ninth goal and fourth in his last six 
games. 
</P>
<P>
In the second period, the Kings appeared to have blown the Oilers away with an 
offensive burst that resulted in goals on three consecutive shots. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton entered the game with only 35 goals, lowest total in the league. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings built their 4-1 lead as follows: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gretzky, flashing the form the Oilers saw up close and personal for nine 
years, stick-handled his way around both Esa Tikkanen and Simpson, leaving both 
grasping at air in the King zone. Gretzky then took the puck up the ice and 
whipped it to Steve Duchesne on the left side. Duchesne passed to Granato, 
whose backhander was blocked by Ranford. Gretzky, however, put in the rebound 
to extend his point-scoring streak to 15 games with his team-leading 12th goal. 
</P>
<P>
Kings 2, Oilers 1 at 1:37. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Duchesne backhanded the puck into the net with a nice spin move off Elik. 
</P>
<P>
Kings 3, Oilers 1 at 2:23. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gretzky intercepted Steve Smith's pass in the Oiler zone and fed Granato, 
who scored his ninth goal. 
</P>
<P>
Kings 4, Oilers 1 at 3:44. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Lamb's third goal at 4:09 slowed the Kings' momentum. 
</P>
<P>
And then Robitaille put the Oilers back in the game while removing himself from 
it with his cross-checking penalty. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Center Mike Krushelnyski, traded by the Kings Friday to the Toronto Maple Leafs 
for John McIntyre, said the move "kind of surprised me. But it's part of the 
game. It's pretty nice someone there wants me. L.A. obviously didn't. I came 
into camp in good shape. But as soon as the season began, there was no ice time 
for me. The Kings are going with their game. And I'm going with mine. They (the 
Maple Leafs) seem pretty excited about the trade. And so am I." . . . 
Krushelnyski has been given permission to remain in Los Angeles until his wife, 
Areta, gives birth to the couple's second child. She is due any time. . . . 
Krushelnyski had been centering the Kings' third line with John Tonelli on the 
left and a cast of characters on the right. Scott Bjugstad centered that line 
Saturday. . . . McIntyre, a spectator at Saturday's game, will wear number 44. 
. . . Asked to describe his style, McIntyre said: "A defensive center man who 
works on finishing his checks. I don't try to tick players off or take bad 
penalties. But, if you take the body, you may throw the player's game off. I'm 
a guy players on other teams don't really like much." . . . Goalie Kelly Hrudey 
got the start when Daniel Berthiaume got hit in the leg with a puck in practice 
Friday and experienced some swelling. . . . Before the game, King owner Bruce 
McNall presented Wayne Gretzky with 18-year scholarships for both of Gretzky's 
children. In honor of their father's 2,000th career point, Paulina and Ty 
Gretzky will receive $2,000 each per year until their 18th birthdays. . . . 
Edmonton center Mark Messier, out since Oct. 16 with a strained ligament in the 
left knee, has begun skating and could return in a week.

had our best day offensively since I've been here." 
</P>
<P>
 Louisville's John Gainey, whose interception preserved a 17-10 victory over 
Boston College: "We got into a huddle and said, 'No Hail Mary passes.' I was 
going to either knock it down or take it. I took it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STREAKS 
</P>
<P>
Brigham Young's Ty Detmer, who passed for 484 yards against Wyoming, has 21 
consecutive games of at least 300 passing yards. . . . Virginia's Herman Moore, 
playing despite two sprained big toes in a 24-10 victory over North Carolina, 
caught a touchdown pass for the ninth consecutive game, an NCAA record. He tied 
another record by catching a scoring pass in his 10th consecutive 
regular-season game. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois has lost five games in a row to Michigan and hasn't won at Ann Arbor 
since 1966. . . . Georgia Tech extended its home-field winning streak to 12 
games. The Yellow Jackets are unbeaten in their last 13. . . . Penn State won 
its seventh game in a row, 24-10 over Maryland. The Terrapins have lost 32 of 
34 games to the Nittany Lions and have lost 20 in a row at Beaver Stadium. . . 
. Wisconsin tied a school record with its 11th consecutive Big Ten loss, 20-7 
to Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas' 0-6 conference record is their worst since 1942. . . . Vanderbilt's 
28-21 loss to Kentucky was the Commodores' 22nd consecutive Southeastern 
Conference loss on the road. . . . Nebraska's 41-9 victory over Kansas was the 
Cornhuskers' 22nd in a row over the Jayhawks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE 
</P>
<P>
Rod Smith's interception on the goal line with 46 seconds left ensured No. 1 
Notre Dame's 34-29 victory over No. 9 Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
Florida's defense, ranked first in the Southeastern Conference and second 
nationally, forced three turnovers in a 38-7 victory over Georgia. Tim Paulk's 
fumble recovery set up one touchdown, Paulk's 36-yard interception return for a 
touchdown gave the Gators a 14-0 lead 31 seconds later, and Richard Fain's 
interception led to another touchdown for a 24-7 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State sacked Duke quarterbacks seven times and intercepted five 
passes in a 16-0 victory. Duke scored 57 points last week against Wake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
Alabama's defense held Louisiana State to a field goal and has gone four 
consecutive games without giving up a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
After falling behind, 27-0, in the third quarter, Utah stymied New Mexico, 
intercepting three passes and recovering two fumbles on the way to a 29-27 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Tech intercepted five passes, and Ronald Ferguson returned one 75 yards 
for a touchdown, in a 40-28 victory over Texas Christian. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FIGHTING WORDS 
</P>
<P>
The Iowa State-Missouri and Temple-Pittsburgh games were both interrupted by 
brawls. One fight started after Iowa State's Shawn Walker intercepted a pass 
late in the third quarter. Missouri players ran across the field to join in 
action. One player from each team was ejected -- Iowa State's Malcolm Goodwin 
and Missouri's David Frisch. At Pittsburgh, Temple was apparently inspired by a 
fight in the first quarter. With Pitt leading, 6-0, the game was halted by a 
10-minute fight along the Temple sidelines after the Owls' Tony Schmitz 
intercepted a pass. Several Temple staff members, including Coach Jerry Berndt, 
suffered bumps and bruises. Temple defensive lineman Alfonso Taylor was 
ejected. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SOMEONE HAD TO WIN 
</P>
<P>
They didn't do much of anything right at Cheney, Pa., in game between Morgan 
State and Cheney. Playing in rain on a sloppy field, the teams combined for 20 
fumbles; Morgan State lost all four of its fumbles and Cheney lost half of its 
16. Fittingly, Morgan State won, 2-0, on James Dozier's block of Mark Williams' 
punt in the fourth quarter. No one recovered the ball, Morgan State getting the 
safety when it went out of the end zone. The loss was Cheney's 14th in a row. 
Morgan State is 1-10.

Score one for college football's traditionalists -- and, whether they care to 
admit it or not, for Cotton Bowl officials. 
</P>
<P>
Houston's bid for a perfect season is history. 
</P>
<P>
Texas, playing before a home crowd of 82,457, polished off the Cougars Saturday 
night, 45-24, handing Houston its first loss of the season after eight 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gives the Longhorns, 7-1 overall and 5-0 in the Southwest 
Conference, the inside track to the Cotton Bowl, where the Southwest Conference 
champion -- either Texas, Texas A&amp;M or Baylor -- will face Miami or, as a 
remote possibility, Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
The 14th-ranked Longhorns, their only loss coming to Colorado by seven points, 
have worked their way into the muddled national title picture, but still must 
face Texas Christian, Baylor and Texas A&amp;M. 
</P>
<P>
As for third-ranked Houston, which entered the game as the only unbeaten and 
untied team in Division I-A, the game was a nightmare played out before the big 
Memorial Stadium crowd and a national television audience. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to play in a bowl or earn the SWC title because of NCAA sanctions, the 
Cougars had hoped to use their run-and-shoot offense to show the world (or at 
least that segment with votes in the Associated Press poll) that they should be 
considered for the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
But the run-and-shoot was nothing special Saturday against the top-rated 
defense in the SWC, and the Longhorns continuously burned a Houston secondary 
that includes two true freshmen and a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
David Klingler, Houston's junior quarterback and Heisman Trophy candidate, had 
four passes intercepted and was knocked off his rhythm early by Texas' blitzing 
linebackers. 
</P>
<P>
Klingler wound up completing 22 of 52 passes for 299 yards and two touchdowns, 
far below the numbers he had put up during Houston's previous eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Weatherspoon, Houston's star running back, was limited to 50 yards in 15 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
And, all told, the Cougars had 391 yards of total offense after averaging 564 
coming in. 
</P>
<P>
"Texas gave a determined effort with their pass rush," Houston Coach John 
Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
"They put a lot of pressure on David all night and forced him into a bad game. 
But I added to that by forcing a lot of calls on offense in the second half 
looking for something big to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the real defensive stopper for Texas might have been its offense. It 
wasn't the run-and-shoot, but it was effective, eating up yardage (626) and 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you shut them down," Texas Coach David McWilliams said of the 
Cougar offense. "I think our offense got the ball, and they couldn't take it 
away from us." 
</P>
<P>
Houston's loss means that, for the first time since 1936, no team will go 
through the regular major college season unbeaten and untied. No. 7 Georgia 
Tech, at 8-0-1, is the only unbeaten major college team. 
</P>
<P>
Officials had to clear thousands of Texas fans off the field in order to run 
the final play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore quarterback Peter Gardere, who has been as ordinary as Klingler has 
been flashy, completed 20 of 28 passes for 322 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Butch Hadnot, a true freshman, rushed for 134 yards in 23 carries 
and scored three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Texas' defensive plan was clear from the beginning -- disrupt Klingler -- and 
the Longhorns were immediately successful with it. 
</P>
<P>
Klingler turned the ball over on each of the Cougars' first two possessions. 
His second pass of the night was intercepted by Mark Berry, and on the next 
Houston series, with the Cougars facing third down at the Texas six-yard line, 
Klingler fumbled under heavy pressure from a blitzing Brian Jones, Texas' 
middle linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
But the Longhorns couldn't take advantage of either break, Gardere turning the 
ball over twice on an interception and a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
Gardere's fumble gave Houston the ball at the Texas 18, and, 10 seconds later, 
the Cougars were leading, 7-0, on Klingler's 23-yard scoring pass to Manny 
Hazard. 
</P>
<P>
Texas took the ensuing kickoff and produced its first sustained drive of the 
game. The Longhorns went 85 yards in 12 plays, taking 5:04 off the clock, with 
Hadnot running five yards for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars quickly turned the ball over again, receiver Tracy Good fumbling 
after a five-yard gain to the Texas 40. The Longhorns then drove the 60 yards 
to move in front, 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
Klingler next took the Cougars to the Houston 21, where he wrecked the drive by 
throwing his second interception of the night, a pass straight to safety Lance 
Gunn in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Taking possession at their 20, the Longhorns needed only 1:27 to reach the end 
zone again, Hadnot capping the drive with a one-yard run. Hadnot later scored 
on a three-yard run.

NOTRE DAME: SENIORS STEP FORWARD IN BEATING TENNESSEE. SMITH'S INTERCEPTION 
NEAR GOAL LINE THWARTS COMEBACK.

<P>
The Neyland Stadium scoreboard flashed the obvious: No. 1-ranked Notre Dame 34, 
No. 9-rated Tennessee 29. 
</P>
<P>
But those are numbers, not reasons. What the lights couldn't do was detail the 
moments -- all significant, some not obviously so -- that preceded the Irish 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Take last week. Little-used cornerback Rod Smith, exiled to the bench after the 
season opener against Michigan, noticed Coach Lou Holtz watching a hand-held 
television as the team bus left Giants Stadium after the Irish's lackluster win 
over Navy. 
</P>
<P>
"Any scores, Coach?" Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz turned around and quickly forgot about the postgame shows. 
</P>
<P>
"Rod Smith -- just the man I wanted to see," Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz told Smith that another week's worth of good practice sessions would earn 
him a starting assignment against Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, sir," answered Smith, who floated back to his seat. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Smith intercepted a last-minute pass at the Irish two-yard line 
that sealed Notre Dame's victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't really supposed to be in that position," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As if Holtz cared. 
</P>
<P>
And what about tailback Ricky Watters, seemingly banished after fumbling balls 
away to Stanford and Miami? 
</P>
<P>
So low was Watters that flanker/tailback Raghib (Rocket) Ismail offered a pep 
talk. "Things will come around," Ismail said that day. "It will come back to 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Little moments. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, Holtz had told his seniors that they alone would determine the fate 
of this team. Watters, a fourth-year guy, didn't know if that meant a return to 
the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Now he does, as do the Volunteers and a sellout audience of 97,123, who saw 
Watters leave cleat marks on undersized defenders. He ran for 174 yards, 
including a 66-yard dash that saw the field littered with three would-be 
Tennessee tacklers. In all, Notre Dame gained 316 rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Earlier in the season, I was trying too hard," Watters said. "Thing was, I was 
hurting this team. (Today) I just said, 'I'm not going to stop.' " 
</P>
<P>
Evidence? Watters averaged 10.2 yards per carry. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is nose tackle Chris Zorich, who limped around the Notre Dame campus 
last week. A partially dislocated right kneecap was to blame. 
</P>
<P>
Zorich, a senior and captain, was sidelined against Navy, but he had no 
intention of missing the game against Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
First he had to convince Holtz, who granted Zorich's wish to play after 
watching him in pregame warmups. Zorich, who played every other series, 
recorded only one tackle. But it was the thought that mattered. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I put my right foot down I was in pain," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to measure his playing capacity, Zorich didn't hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
"About 5%," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame's much-maligned defense played better when Zorich was on the field. 
And Zorich, along with linebacker Michael Stonebreaker, administered the 
sideline fire-and-brimstone lecture to his teammates when there were hints of a 
premature celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very upset," said Zorich. "This was for everything. But everybody was 
unbuckling their chinstraps." 
</P>
<P>
Not for long, they weren't. Shortly after Ismail's 44-yard touchdown run put 
Notre Dame ahead, 34-23, with 3:33 remaining, Tennessee staged a frenzied 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
It started with a 10-play drive that began at the Volunteer 32-yard line and 
ended with quarterback Andy Kelly finding wingback Alvin Harper open in the end 
zone. The defender? Rod Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"He got fooled a couple of times," Stonebreaker said. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly, who completed 35 of 60 passes for 399 yards, a Tennessee record, then 
tried for the two-point conversion. His pass to Vince Moore failed. 
</P>
<P>
An onside kick came next. Notre Dame sent out its "hands" team, made up mostly 
of receivers and defensive backs. Tennessee hoped for a minor miracle. 
</P>
<P>
It got one when the ball took a hard, unpredictable bounce and was recovered by 
Tennessee's Carl Pickens at the Volunteer 46. 
</P>
<P>
Five plays later, with about 50 seconds left to play, Tennessee had first and 
10 at the Notre Dame 20. Kelly dropped back, looked for Harper, who already had 
caught two touchdown passes, and threw. Harper was open -- or so it appeared. 
But the ball was slightly underthrown, Smith intercepting. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had gotten the ball a little higher, (Harper) would have scored," Kelly 
said. "But there's no question that the defensive man made a good play breaking 
on the ball." 
</P>
<P>
After the game, Orange Bowl officials scurried to the Notre Dame locker room 
and extended yet another unofficial invitation. Colorado, which will probably 
be ranked second after this week's poll, awaits. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish (8-1) said they would need to sleep on it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's up to them to say yes or no," said Arthur H. Hertz, Orange Bowl 
president. "But when you're No. 1 and driving the bus, you can drive it any way 
you want." 
</P>
<P>
Which is bowl-speak for: Notre Dame still might be considering a trip to the 
Sugar or Cotton Bowl. Doubtful, but slightly possible. Also, the Fiesta 
beckons. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee dropped to 5-2-2 but remained in the chase for the Southeastern 
Conference championship and a Sugar or Fiesta Bowl appearance. Compared to the 
national championship that the Irish pursue, it isn't much consolation.

MELBOURNE, Australia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At racetracks around the world, the most-asked question is "Who do you like?" 
or variations upon that theme. But in Australia there is a query that runs a 
close second: "What are you wearing?" 
</P>
<P>
Even though the Aussies rank among the world's most passionate gamblers, horse 
racing here isn't merely a hard-core gambling event. The races are a party and 
a fashion show too -- especially during springtime in Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
When historians list the great moments in racing history here they start with 
Phar Lap's victory in the 1930 Melbourne Cup, Carbine's win in 1890 and Jean 
Shrimpton's dress in 1965. (The world-famous model arrived at the high-toned 
members' enclosure wearing a simple white shift that stopped at mid-thigh. The 
country was momentarily scandalized -- then the miniskirt craze was born.) 
</P>
<P>
But even in the boondocks, racegoers are style conscious. As an unprepared 
American visitor, I was incredulous the first time I witnessed a ritual known 
as "fashions in the field" at a humble little country track in the town of 
Ballarat. 
</P>
<P>
The feature race had been run, and after three horses wound up in an 
excruciatingly tight photo finish, a stewards inquiry was posted involving all 
three. Most tracks would have been abuzz with discussions of the inquiry, but 
instead an announcement came that it was time for "fashions in the field." 
</P>
<P>
A parade of well-dressed women, invariably wearing large hats, mounted a 
platform in front of the grandstand, where a panel judged the outfits. This 
activity went on for 20 or 30 minutes, during which time there was no mention 
of the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
I imagined the same scene at Aqueduct: Deranged horseplayers would have been 
shrieking obscenities and setting fire to trash cans by now. But here everybody 
politely applauded the winning lady in the big hat before learning that the 
winning horse's number would stay up. 
</P>
<P>
Having learned that dressing for a day at Flemington isn't quite like dressing 
for a day at Laurel, my wife, Susan, consulted a Melbourne friend before this 
trip and asked what one wears to the races. This, it turned out, was a matter 
full of subtleties. 
</P>
<P>
"On Derby day," she was instructed, "dress tends to be more formal -- you'll 
see a lot of blacks and whites. Melbourne Cup day you can do anything 
outrageous -- a skirt split up to your ears if you like. The big day is the 
Oaks, and you're a lady -- elegant dress, flowers in your hair." 
</P>
<P>
The Oaks -- the big race for 3-year-old fillies -- is such a nationally 
recognized event that even schoolgirls may dress up especially to emulate the 
glamorous ladies at the track. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all of the 50,000 people at Flemington looked as if they had given 
months of thought to their outfits for the day. Almost every woman wore a hat 
-- the larger and more outrageous the better. One wore a hat supporting a 
champagne bottle; another wore a hat consisting of a wicker coronet. And there 
were more feathers atop heads at Flemington than could be found in the aviary 
of the Royal Melbourne Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
Toddlers in strollers wore fancy outfits. And even counterculture types who 
might have rejected the formality of the day felt they had to make a fashion 
statement, such as several men who wore tuxedo jackets, formal shirts, shorts 
and sneakers. While I had been prepared by trips to the Kentucky Derby for the 
carnival atmosphere of Tuesday's Melbourne Cup, I have never known anything 
like the Oaks. It was the most colorful and glamorous day of racing I have ever 
seen -- and I've seen quite a few. 
</P>
<P>
The whole social and fashion-conscious aspect of Australian racing reveals a 
great deal about the nature of the sport here, and comparisons arise. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, dress represents the sharp division of racetrack patrons 
along social lines. At Belmont Park on any given day the crowd will consist of 
two basic groups: 1) the rich, who come to socialize in the turf club and the 
box-seat area, and who dress for the occasion; and 2) the masses who come to 
gamble and see no need to dress for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
In Australia, racing always has appealed to a broader segment of society. In 
rural parts of the country, where the inhabitants live long distances from each 
other, a race meeting often is a major social event, and even if it consists of 
a few cheap races run in a dust storm or in searing heat, it is an excuse for 
all the people in the region to don their finery and socialize. 
</P>
<P>
At a track here, a gentleman in a morning coat or a lady with a plumed hat does 
not connote snootiness. It's the Aussies' way of having a good time. 
</P>
<P>
 (Washington Post racing columnist Andrew Beyer has gone off to Australia for 
three months to sample the sport Down Under.)

WESTERN ATHLETIC ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
UTAH FALLS BEHIND, 27-0, THEN BEATS NEW MEXICO

<P>
No lead, apparently, is too big for New Mexico to lose. 
</P>
<P>
Utah spotted the Lobos a 27-0 lead early in the second half of Saturday's 
Western Athletic Conference game at Albuquerque, then came back to win, 29-27, 
handing New Mexico its fifth consecutive defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Brown capped the comeback with a five-yard touchdown run with 1:07 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Utah improved to 4-6 overall and 2-5 in the WAC. New Mexico, which has blown 
leads throughout the season, dropped to 2-9 and 1-5. 
</P>
<P>
The Lobos appeared to be in total control after converting two Utah turnovers 
into touchdowns to start the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Lewis started Utah's 21-point third-quarter comeback by intercepting a 
pass from sophomore Marcus Goodloe at the New Mexico 24, setting up a 
three-play drive that ended with a two-yard touchdown run by Brad Foster. 
</P>
<P>
Utah defensive back Mark Swanson intercepted another pass by Goodloe to set up 
a 20-yard, four-play drive that Darrel Hicks capped with a 21-yard touchdown 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Goodloe fumbled at the Utah 48 on a fourth-down play and the Utes again 
capitalized with Mike Richmond connecting with Bryan Rowley on a 30-yard 
touchdown pass play. 
</P>
<P>
Buried in its own territory, New Mexico gave up a safety before Utah went 50 
yards with the winning drive. A 17-yard run by tackle Wade Absher on a faked 
pass and an 18-yard pass from Richmond to Greg Hoffman set up Brown's touchdown 
run. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico's final bid ended when Jimmy Bellamy intercepted a Goodloe pass at 
the New Mexico 45 with 42 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State 31, Tulsa 13 -- The Rams (7-3) improved their chances for their 
first bowl berth in 42 years with the victory over the Hurricane (2-8) in a 
nonconference game at Fort Collins, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State, which made its only bowl appearance in the 1948 Raisin Bowl, is 
a strong candidate for the Freedom Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Bowl Committee will meet Monday to pick opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Fullback Todd Yert scored three short-yardage touchdowns for the Rams and 
cornerback Selwyn Jones sealed the victory when he intercepted a pass in the 
end zone with 1:45 left.

BYU GAINS AN EASY WIN OVER WYOMING; 
</P>
<P>
WAC: TY DETMER BECOMES SCHOOL'S ALL-TIME PASSING LEADER AS NO. 8 COUGARS BEAT 
NO. 25 COWBOYS, 45-14.

LARAMIE, Wyo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ty Detmer, a target the last time he played at Laramie, was a terror on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Detmer had his 21st consecutive 300-yard passing game and moved into fifth 
place on the NCAA career passing yardage list as eighth-ranked Brigham Young 
battered No. 25 Wyoming, 45-14, in the Western Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Detmer, then a redshirt freshman, made his first varsity start against Wyoming 
in 1988. He was sacked five times and had four passes intercepted in a 24-14 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
Detmer had an opportunity Saturday to show what he has learned since that 
troubling start. 
</P>
<P>
The junior completed 35 of 50 passes for 484 yards, climbing past former BYU 
quarterback Jim McMahon into fifth place on the NCAA career yardage list with 
9,670 yards. He has three games and another season in which to get the 1,755 
yards he needs to supplant San Diego State's Todd Santos on the top of the 
list. 
</P>
<P>
"It was good to come back and see everything again and have more experience," 
Detmer said. "We played a great game." 
</P>
<P>
BYU Coach LaVell Edwards thought his team's performance was the best of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"It was our best defensive effort, and I think we are getting better each 
game," he said. "If we can keep this going, I think this is about as good a 
football as we have had at BYU." 
</P>
<P>
As far as Wyoming Coach Paul Roach is concerned, the Heisman Trophy race is 
over. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were going to start to form a football team tomorrow, who would you 
want, (1988 Heisman winner Barry) Sanders or Detmer?" Roach asked. "I just 
think he's truly outstanding, and I hope he wins it because I really think he's 
deserving of it. I mean, he does more for a football team than anybody I've 
seen in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Detmer had plenty of time to show his stuff as the Cougars (8-1) improved to 
6-0 in the WAC by limiting Wyoming (9-2, 5-2) to 189 yards. When he wasn't 
throwing, he was handing off to the likes of Peter Tuipulotu, who carried nine 
times for 75 yards and three touchdowns, and Mike Salido, who had 96 yards in 
10 carries and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"Defensively, we ran into a machine," Roach said. "They come in here averaging 
620 yards, and today I understand they got even more than that. 
</P>
<P>
"In the second half, we just didn't do anything offensively. We just played 
baseball -- three and out." 
</P>
<P>
Tuipulotu got BYU's first touchdown on a 30-yard run up the middle late in the 
first quarter that put BYU ahead, 10-0. Salido scored on a 13-yard pass from 
Detmer to make it 17-0 after one quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Wyoming, which had the ball for only 19 minutes 40 seconds, scored late in the 
half on Tom Corontzos' six-yard run and tight end Gordy Wood's 23-yard reverse.

SAN DIEGO STATE BARELY HOLDS OFF HAWAII, 44-38

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego State quarterback Dan McGwire passed for 429 yards and two 
touchdowns, and the Aztecs survived a 22-point fourth-quarter by Hawaii to 
defeat the Rainbows, 44-38, in a Western Athletic Conference game Saturday 
night at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State improved to 4-4 overall and 2-3 in the WAC. Hawaii is 5-4 and 
2-3. 
</P>
<P>
T.C. Wright's 17-yard touchdown run with 6:51 to play put the Aztecs ahead, 
44-24. 
</P>
<P>
McGwire, who completed 23 of 36 passes, moved past Brian Sipe into second place 
on the San Diego State career completion list. He has 437, one more than Sipe, 
but is still well behind record-holder Todd Santos' 910. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Raye caught 10 passes for 209 yards and a touchdown. Patrick Rowe, who 
entered the game with a nation-leading 120.4 yards per game, caught six passes 
for 155 yards -- the sixth consecutive game he has had 100 or more yards 
receiving. That is one short of the Aztec record, and two shy of the NCAA 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii scored three touchdowns and a two-point conversion in the fourth 
quarter. Quarterback Garrett Gabriel connected on touchdown pass plays of 10 
yards to Dane McArthur, 17 yards to Larry Kahn-Smith and 23 yards to Jeff 
Sydner. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 29, New Mexico 27 -- The Utes (4-6, 2-5) overcame a 27-point deficit to 
beat the Lobos (2-9, 1-5) in a WAC game at Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Brown capped the comeback with a five-yard touchdown run with 1:07 
left. 
</P>
<P>
The Lobos, who have lost five consecutive games, appeared to be in total 
control after converting two Utah turnovers into touchdowns to start the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
But sophomore quarterback Marcus Goodloe had three passes intercepted and lost 
two fumbles as the Utes came back with a 21-point third-quarter to set up 
Brown's game-clinching touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State 31, Tulsa 13 -- The Rams (7-3) improved their chances for their 
first bowl berth in 42 years with the victory over the Hurricane (2-8) in a 
nonconference game at Fort Collins, Colo.

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER;

<P>
SUDDENLY, JORDAN IS NOT BULLISH ON DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Was that the year of the Bulls or the year of the bull? 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Bulls thought this was their season, but they're off to a shaky 
start. There's even the prospect of tarnishing Michael Jordan's demigod status. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Phil Jackson wants Jordan to shoot less. Jordan is not bursting with 
enthusiasm. Is that behind Chicago's 1-3 start? 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, the annual all-defensive pick, has been torn up by Bernard King (for 44 
points) and Tony Campbell (26). Are opponents tiring him out and pinning him 
down by going right at him? 
</P>
<P>
And how about his supposedly reinforced supporting cast? 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Hopson, whose career 42% shooting was ascribed to the poverty of his New 
Jersey Net surroundings, has yet to prove he can shoot any better in Chicago. 
In four games, he averaged 4.3 points and shot 40%. 
</P>
<P>
Stacey King showed up overweight again, missed nine of his first 10 shots and 
had four blocked. As a rookie he began zero for nine and had four blocked. 
Forget the weight. Next season he should bypass that first week and show up for 
the second. 
</P>
<P>
After the home-opener loss to the Philadelphia 76ers, Jackson said: "It just 
means we can only win 81 games." 
</P>
<P>
After another home loss to Boston left them 0-3, Jackson said: "The players are 
totally stunned." 
</P>
<P>
It's early, but they aren't yukking it up any more in the Windy City. 
</P>
<P>
Introducing the Denver warp effect, or the top 20 doesn't mean all it used to: 
</P>
<P>
Paul Westhead's high-speed offense has produced no victories, but two Nuggets 
made the list of leading scorers: Laker castoff Orlando Woolridge (averaging 
30.3 points) who should be asking to re-negotiate any day now; and 36-year-old 
Walter Davis (24.3). Todd Lichti (22.8) is just outside the top group. 
</P>
<P>
The Nuggets, of course, are the second-highest scoring team ever with their 
139-point average. 
</P>
<P>
The highest? 
</P>
<P>
Their opposition, at 152. 
</P>
<P>
Add Nuggets: Dallas' Derek Harper asked Lichti if they can hold up. 
</P>
<P>
Said Harper: "He said, 'Talk to me in February, I'll let you know.' " 
</P>
<P>
Last add Nuggets: After their 161-153 loss at San Antonio, George Gervin, 38, 
said: 
</P>
<P>
"I would have come out of retirement for that one." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Barkley high-lowlight of the week, or, they've never seen a male 
chauvinist porker the size of this one. 
</P>
<P>
After the 76ers needed overtime to beat the Nets, he noted: 
</P>
<P>
"This is a game that if you lose, you go home and beat your wife and kids. Did 
you see my wife jumping up and down at the end of the game? That's because she 
knew I wasn't going to beat her." 
</P>
<P>
Wasn't this tasteless and sure to offend? 
</P>
<P>
"Nah," Barkley said. "Print it. (Anger) the women's groups." 
</P>
<P>
Add Barkley: The 76er-Net game wound up in overtime only because referee Joe 
Borgia incorrectly ruled that Derrick Coleman had goal-tended Barkley's 
last-second airball and scored it a three-point goal. 
</P>
<P>
Said Barkley: "I'm a nice guy. I deserve a break every now and then." 
</P>
<P>
NBA vice president Rod Thorn later reviewed replays and agreed it was an error. 
The Nets protested, but since it was a judgment call, it isn't reversible. 
</P>
<P>
Said Barkley: "How long are (the Nets) going to brag about one game?" 
</P>
<P>
NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner David Stern on possible NFL plans to take the Super Bowl from 
Phoenix: "We wouldn't have scheduled it there in the first place." . . . First 
dispatches from the Knick-Patrick Ewing front: Ewing can become a restricted 
free agent whenever his salary falls out of the top five in the league. It will 
as soon as Indianapolis' Reggie Miller signs his new $3.3-million-a-year 
contract. Ewing says the Knicks' first offer was "an insult to me" and added: 
"Who knows? You might see me in a Bullets uniform." 
</P>
<P>
Executive of the year: 76er owner Harold Katz says he rebuilt his team when "I 
got rid of every piece of . . . we had." . . . Keep thinking, Chuck, it's what 
you do best: Piston Coach Chuck Daly, fearing a media crunch in advance of a 
return to Portland, encamped instead at Vancouver, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
For those who weren't excited by New Jersey's Derrick Coleman as a top pick in 
the draft, he's averaging 11 rebounds a game. On a per-minute basis, he's ahead 
of league-leader Ewing. . . . Larry Bird, after new coach Chris Ford kept him 
on the bench through most of the Celtics' fourth-quarter rally in Chicago: "I'm 
not complaining. I like winning." The Bird-Ford relationship is watched 
closely, because Bird reportedly had problems with Jimmy Rodgers, which may be 
one reason Rodgers no longer works there. 
</P>
<P>
Watch out for Dallas, which won in New York and Philadelphia. Last season, the 
Mavericks got their only consecutive road victories in Miami and Orlando. . . . 
Houston's reclamation coup, Kenny Smith, is averaging 23 points, shooting 58% 
and taking charge. When Akeem Olajuwon got in foul trouble regularly, Smith 
said: "All of us, the coaches and the players, have been expressing to Akeem 
how much harder he's making it on the rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
All-unemployed: Adrian Dantley, Joe Barry Carroll, Robert Reid, Purvis Short, 
Dennis Johnson, Mitchell Wiggins and Gerald Henderson. . . . Another young 
rebounding fool: Seattle's Shawn Kemp took down 23 in 43 minutes. Coach K.C. 
Jones will continue to bring the 20-year-old off the bench. "He still has a 
ways to go on the offensive end," Jones said. "But on the defensive end, he's 
there. He has the look of a great one."

CARLSON'S KICKS HELP MICHIGAN BEAT ILLINI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
J.D. Carlson tied a school record with five field goals as No. 19 Michigan 
defeated No. 17 Illinois, 22-17, in a Big Ten game Saturday at Ann Arbor, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question we felt we beat a great Illinois football team," said 
Michigan Coach Gary Moeller. "I knew they would be back after they got blown 
out (54-28 by Iowa) last week." 
</P>
<P>
Carlson equaled the mark set by Mike Gillette in a 22-7 win over Minnesota on 
Nov. 5, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of field goals were really crucial," Carlson said. "It was a lot of 
strategy out there today. If I had missed, Illinois could have come down and 
put up some touchdowns." 
</P>
<P>
His 51-yard field goal as time expired in the second quarter bounced off the 
crossbar and through the uprights. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines, 6-3 overall and 4-2 in the Big Ten, led 19-3 after three 
quarters and got a key interception by Vada Murray at their own two-yard line 
with six minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan then ran out the clock, driving to the Illinois 22 before time 
expired. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my fault," Illinois quarterback Jason Verduzco said. "I read it wrong. 
I shouldn't have thrown it down there, but I did." 
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive loss for the Fighting Illini (6-3, 4-2) who have 
lost five in a row to Michigan and haven't won at Ann Arbor since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Carlson kicked field goals of 28, 51, 19, 18 and 18 yards. Freshman Ricky 
Powers, who ran for 113 yards in 23 carries, had a three-yard run for 
Michigan's only touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Wax, who had four catches for 64 yards, caught a 30-yard touchdown pass 
from Verduzco and Wax tossed a 26-yard scoring strike to Steven Mueller for the 
Illini, whose other points came on a 32-yard field goal by Doug Higgins. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan had 432 yards, 303 on the ground. The Illini, held to 13 first downs 
and possession time of 20:04, had 215 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State 28, Minnesota 16 -- The Spartans eliminated the Gophers from the 
Rose Bowl race by defeating them at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State (5-3-1, 4-2) kept its slim Rose Bowl chances alive, moving 
within one game of Iowa, which lost to Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans, who close the season against Northwestern and Wisconsin, have 
already lost to Iowa. Michigan and Illinois are also 4-2 and Ohio State is 
4-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State has already announced that it will appear in the John Hancock 
Bowl (formerly Sun Bowl) in El Paso, Tex., if it doesn't win the Big Ten. 
</P>
<P>
Hyland Hickson rushed for 97 yards and Tico Duckett had 76 to lead a Spartan 
ground game that gained 242 yards against Minnesota. Each ran for a touchdown, 
as did Courtney Hawkins and quarterback Dan Enos. 
</P>
<P>
All four Michigan State touchdowns capped long, ground-oriented drives. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota's lone bright spot was the passing of Marquel Fleetwood, who missed 
the last game with a collarbone injury. He completed 16 of 27 passes for 164 
yards and scored on an 11-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 20, Wisconsin 7 -- Vaughn Dunbar rushed for 161 yards and one touchdown 
and Rob Turner scored on a 67-yard pass play as the Hoosiers beat the Badgers 
in a Big Ten game at Bloomington, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first victory in five weeks for Indiana (5-3-1, 2-3-1) and the 11th 
consecutive conference loss over two seasons for Wisconsin (1-8, 0-6). 
</P>
<P>
Scott Bonnell added field goals of 43 and and 41 yards as the Hoosiers kept 
alive their hopes for a bowl bid. 
</P>
<P>
Purdue 33, Northwestern 13 -- Eric Hunter ran for two touchdowns and passed for 
another in leading the Boilermakers over the Wildcats in a Big Ten game at 
Evanston, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter completed 17 of 28 passes for 185 yards before leaving the game late in 
the third quarter with a bruised knee. 
</P>
<P>
The Boilermakers (2-7, 1-5) scored 21 points in the third quarter and Jarrett 
Scales returned a blocked punt 18 yards for a touchdown in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Northwestern dropped to 2-7 and 1-5.

HUSKIES DON'T KNOW WHAT HIT THEM; 
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON: CHANCES FOR NO. 1 GO UP IN SMOKE AGAINST UNDERDOG UCLA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Greg Lewis sat motionless, his face fixed in a blank expression, then started 
listing everything the Washington Huskies had just lost on a gray, windy 
Saturday. He could have used a calculator. 
</P>
<P>
"It really hurts," Lewis said, but he wasn't talking about his sore left knee, 
the one covered with an ice bag. "We did lose, but I still feel we are one of 
the best teams in the country. We just didn't play like it today." 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies, the No. 2-ranked team in the nation, saw their hopes for a 
national championship blown away by 21-point underdog UCLA, which pulled off an 
improbable 25-22 upset before 71,925 at Husky Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis gained only 50 yards, ending his streak of consecutive 100-yard games at 
nine. He carried the ball only 12 times and played only parts of two quarters 
after injuring his right knee in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Going into halftime, I could barely walk," said Lewis, who felt his knee lock 
after an 18-yard gain on a sweep when he was hit by UCLA free safety Eric 
Turner. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't plant my foot, cut or run with a lot of confidence," Lewis said. "I 
wanted to continue to play, but Coach (Don) James had the team's best interests 
at heart." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was on track to equal Marcus Allen's 1981 Pacific 10 Conference 
one-season rushing record of 100 yards in every game, but he said the end of 
his streak was not of primary importance. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't really bother me as much as losing does," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
For the Huskies, it was a monumental flop. Not only were they overwhelming 
favorites, Washington would have remained in contention for a national 
championship if Notre Dame faltered somewhere down the line. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line? 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, it means our national championship dreams are dead," James said. 
"That's what it means." 
</P>
<P>
Washington had 146 yards rushing after averaging 254.7. The Huskies committed 
three costly turnovers, including two interceptions by quarterback Mark 
Brunell. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything that could go wrong, did go wrong," cornerback Charles Mincy said. 
"I don't know what to say. It's horrible." 
</P>
<P>
James, however, knew what word to use. He picked "horrendous" to describe his 
team's offensive show. 
</P>
<P>
"If we couldn't get a running game going today, we had no chance the way we 
were throwing the ball and catching it," James said. 
</P>
<P>
Brunell competed only 10 of 34 passes for 137 yards, and his pass intended for 
Mario Bailey that Eric Turner intercepted set up UCLA's winning drive at 
midfield. 
</P>
<P>
"What can you say?" Brunell said. "It's disappointing. Our chances for a 
national championship are gone now. We've got just to bounce back now, I 
guess." 
</P>
<P>
James, who after the game instructed his players to give credit to UCLA,said 
there was no clue in practices during the week that the Huskies would fall flat 
with so much riding on the outcome of one game. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, it wasn't a very good day to play offense, but they played 
better than we did," James said. "We didn't have much of a running game and we 
had a horrendous passing game. But we live up here, we practice in it, so 
there's no excuse about the weather." 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies were reeling from the time Brian Brown broke loose for an 88-yard 
touchdown run five minutes into the game. On that play, James said his defense 
got caught sending its linebackers and free safety Tommie Smith on a blitz on 
third and short yardage. 
</P>
<P>
Once Brown crossed the line of scrimmage, he was gone. Little did the Huskies 
know, so were their title hopes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what it was," Mincy said. "We just played flat." 
</P>
<P>
Until Saturday, Washington had been flattening people in the Pac-10. The 
Huskies led virtually every offensive and defensive category: rushing offense, 
rushing defense, total offense, total defense, scoring offense and scoring 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
They were 8-1 overall, 6-0 in the conference and had their sights set on No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the opportunity, but we let it slip away," Lewis said. "Maybe we will 
take our frustrations out on Washington State. Yeah, I guess that's all we can 
do now." 
</P>
<P>
James sipped a soft drink and sat by himself. In 16 years at Washington, this 
was his second legitimate shot at a national championship, the other in 1984 
when the Huskies finished 11-1, beat Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl and still 
finished No. 2 behind Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, we read a lot of nice things about us last week," James said. "All 
that talk about the national championship. Maybe the more good things you hear, 
the softer you get and the more people get prepared to play you."

TEXAS TECH INTERCEPTS FIVE PASSES, BEATS TCU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Texas Tech intercepted five passes and probably stole Texas Christian's bowl 
hopes in the process Saturday in the Red Raiders' 40-28 Southwest Conference 
victory over the Horned Frogs at Ft. Worth. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Tech, which is 3-7 overall and 2-5 in the SWC, ended a three-game losing 
streak. The Horned Frogs lost their third consecutive game, fell to 5-4 and 3-3 
and probably lost out at their chance of a berth in the Independence Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
TCU took a 7-0 lead on a 19-yard touchdown run by Curtis Modkins, but Texas 
Tech cornerback Ronald Ferguson stunned the Frogs by intercepting a pass by 
Matt Vogler at the Raider 25 and returning it 75 yards for a touchdown to make 
it 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Saul intercepted two of Vogler's passes and Brian Dubiski and Sammy 
Walker one each in the second half, and the Raiders converted them into 17 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday in a 56-35 loss to Houston, Vogler passed for an NCAA record 690 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Baylor 34, Arkansas 3 -- The Bears (5-3-1, 4-1-1) stayed in the race for the 
SWC championship by handing the the Razorbacks (2-7, 0-6) their sixth 
consecutive defeat in a game at Waco, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Needham, starting in place of the injured J.J. Joe, completed 11 of 13 
passes for 133 yards and two touchdowns to give the Razorbacks their worst 
conference record since 1942. 
</P>
<P>
Rice 30, Southern Methodist 28 -- Rice (5-5, 3-4) held off a late charge by SMU 
(1-8, 0-6) in an SWC game at Houston, giving the Owls a chance for their first 
winning season in 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
Rice has won five games for the first time since finishing 5-6 in 1980. The 
Owls could earn their first winning season since a 6-4 finish in 1963 with a 
victory over Baylor next week. 
</P>
<P>
Trevor Cobb, who gained 167 yards in 29 carries, scored on touchdown runs of 
six and 44 yards for Rice. 
</P>
<P>
SMU quarterback Mike Romo, who missed last week's game against Texas A&amp;M 
with a sprained ankle, completed 40 of 62 passes for 452 yards and four 
touchdowns.

VARDELL, PALUMBIS LEAD STANFORD OVER ARIZONA

<TEXT>
<P>
Tommy Vardell ran for two touchdowns and Jason Palumbis added another as 
Stanford beat Arizona, 23-10, Saturday night in Pacific 10 game at Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford improved to 4-6 overall and 3-4 in the conference. Arizona is 6-4 and 
4-4. 
</P>
<P>
Palumbis, a junior quarterback who led the Pac-10 in passing efficiency coming 
in with a 68.7% completion average, completed 15 of 19 passes for 181 yards. He 
was 11 for 13 for 110 yards as the Cardinal took a 14-10 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Glyn Milburn rushed 20 times for 142 yards and Vardell had 80 yards in 15 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
Palumbis dived over from the one to start the fourth quarter, putting Stanford 
ahead 20-10. That capped a 27-yard drive set up by a punt by Arizona's Adam 
Grand that went only eight yards. 
</P>
<P>
John Hopkins' conversion attempt hit the upright, but his 30-yard field goal 
with 7:27 left made it 23-10. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal drove 76 yards in seven plays after the opening kickoff, with 
Vardell scoring his Stanford-record 13th touchdown of the season on a one-yard 
dive. The key play was a 38-yard run by Milburn to the Arizona seven. Milburn 
broke six tackles along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Coston kicked a 41-yard field goal to narrow the margin to 7-3, but 
Vardell put Stanford ahead 14-3 early in the second quarter on a two-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Vardell broke Brad Muster's team record of 12 touchdowns, set in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State 51, Washington State 26 -- Paul Justin threw three touchdown 
passes and ran for two more to lead Sun Devils to a Pac-10 victory over the 
Cougars at Pullman, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Justin, a senior, completed 19 of 25 passes for 379 yards. Eric Guliford had 
seven catches for 128 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Justin also threw touchdown passes of 42 yards to Eric Moss, 31 yards to Kelvin 
Fisher and sneaked across twice for one-yard scoring runs. 
</P>
<P>
Washington State freshman quarterback Drew Bledsoe threw touchdown passes of 
four, five and 27 yards to Phillip Bobo, who finished with 10 catches for 100 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Bledsoe completed 25 of 43 passes for 274 yards, but had a pass intercepted by 
Adam Brass that stopped a 70-yard drive first-quarter drive on the Washington 
State 10. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State improved to 4-5 and 2-4; Washington State fell to 3-7 and 2-5.

LONG BEACH GOES FOR TWO AND WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach Coach George Allen had decided two days earlier that he 
needed to have a two-point conversion play ready because he wasn't going to 
settle for a tie with Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
So with 1:17 left Saturday, after the 49ers had pulled to within 24-23 on a 
21-yard pass play from Todd Studer to Jeff Exum, Allen told his team to go for 
the victory. The play was a bit shaky, but it still worked when Mark Seay 
caught a tipped pass from Studer to give the 49ers a 25-24 victory before 3,090 
in Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure glad we practiced that play in the dark Thursday afternoon," Allen 
said after the 49ers improved to 5-5. "Long Beach hasn't had a winning season 
since 1986. This gives us a chance for the winning season." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, 5-0 at home, conclude their first season under Allen next week at 
home against Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
"I was open," Seay said. "I was just hoping he could get it up over the 
cornerback." 
</P>
<P>
But when Studer's pass was low enough for Clayton Bamberg to tip, it appeared 
as if Northridge, a Division II team, would pull off the upset. The ball, 
though, was deflected and caught by Seay. 
</P>
<P>
The statistics were as close as the score: The 49ers had compiled a 453-440 
edge in total yards. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 10-3 at halftime, Long Beach came back in the third quarter to take 
the lead, 17-10, on a 15-yard run by Herman Nash and a 32-yard pass play from 
Studer to Sean Foster. 
</P>
<P>
But on the first play after the ensuing kickoff, Northridge's Victor DeVaughn, 
who gained a game-high 131 yards, burst 80 yards up the middle for a touchdown 
that tied the score at 17-17. 
</P>
<P>
On their next possession early in the fourth quarter, the Matadors (7-3) went 
67 yards, a scoring drive kept alive by a 13-yard fourth-and-three pass out of 
punt formation from Albert Razo to Eric Treibatch. 
</P>
<P>
Three plays later, Jason Ferguson ran 18 yards for a touchdown that gave 
Northridge a 24-17 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach came back on a long drive, but was stopped four consecutive times 
inside the Northridge five-yard line with four minutes left. The Matadors took 
over, but were forced to punt to Freddie Leslie, who returned the ball 31 yards 
to set up the touchdown and winning two-point play.

UCSD LOSES TO WHEATON

The temperature was over 80 degrees for Saturday's NCAA Division III men's 
soccer quarterfinal game between Wheaton (Ill.) and UC San Diego at UCSD's 
North Campus Stadium, and Wheaton took the field in heavy long-sleeved jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
The Crusaders' shirts were 75% polyester, 25% cotton and bright orange. With 
"Wheaton" printed on the front in large blue lettering, the players looked like 
Wheaties cereal boxes on legs. 
</P>
<P>
They also looked hot, having left behind a climate 50 degrees cooler. And it 
seemed those jerseys could well determine which team would advance to the final 
four. 
</P>
<P>
But after Wheaton defeated the Tritons, 1-0, those jerseys looked like the game 
dress of champions. 
</P>
<P>
The Crusaders (20-2) made it quick and easy, scoring 15 minutes 38 seconds into 
the game when midfielder David Anthony played a ball off his chest and over 
UCSD goalie Brian Siljander. Siljander, thinking Anthony was going to kick the 
ball, started to dive. Then he watched helplessly as Anthony floated the ball 
over his head. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a perfect ball and I just ran it in," Anthony said. "(Siljander) didn't 
know what to do, I was so close to him." 
</P>
<P>
The play was set up off a long throw-in by Bill Pitkin and keyed when 
midfielder Phil Wolf made a flick pass toward the left post that Anthony 
received and juggled. The goal was the first allowed by UCSD (17-3-1) on a long 
throw-in this season, and it left Triton Coach Derek Armstrong dismayed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed," he said. "I'm struggling to find somebody who played well. 
Goal-wise, we dried up in the playoffs. The team was capable of winning the 
whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't help that UCSD controlled the ball for most of the second half but 
was unable to convert 13 shots, six of which were smothered by Wheaton goalie 
Doug Allen.

L.A. NO FIELD OF DREAMS FOR STRAWBERRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The trail of broken hearts reaches from Roosevelt Avenue to Elysian Park 
Avenue, from area code 718 to 213. Darryl Strawberry always leaves 'em weeping. 
</P>
<P>
What are the Mets without him? What is he without the Mets? 
</P>
<P>
He remains most clearly a mixed bag -- a puzzle wrapped in an enigma. Why 
should it be any different that he broke so many hearts when he chose to leave 
the Mets, when he broke so many hearts while he was here? 
</P>
<P>
Whether he understands it or not, he takes his baggage with him to Los Angeles. 
The fields are always more elysian in the other fellow's ballpark, especially 
through the eyes of an agent. 
</P>
<P>
I don't see anything that suggests life will be any better for Strawberry with 
the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry's psyche is as firm as the bog under Shea Stadium. Playing for the 
Dodgers was his childhood dream but not playing there may have been his adult 
blessing. 
</P>
<P>
When he played in Los Angeles as a visitor it may have been a reunion with his 
family; it was hardly a celebration on the field. The enormous pressures to 
satisfy his own ego needs as well as the needs of mother, family and friends 
was a curse. Sometimes he appeared frozen. 
</P>
<P>
Over eight seasons Strawberry hit .225 in Los Angeles (39-for-173) with six 
home runs and 20 runs batted in. That's not what the Dodgers think they bought. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry thrived this season after his crisis of alcohol rehab because of a 
bounty of aftercare. A divorce action is reported close -- perhaps awaiting 
only the input of his new contract. 
</P>
<P>
He gave credit for this summer's well-being to Dr. Allan Lans, the emotion 
coach for the Mets. Strawberry got support from the presence of Dwight Good-en 
and from the fact that Strawberry had earned status and respect from teammates 
who had learned what to hear and what to ignore. They know when "Darryl is just 
being Darryl." It's Strawberry's makeup that he needs love when teammates most 
wanted to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Lasorda will have to blow a lot of smoke to replace Lans. Strawberry, on 
his own, has to form a whole new alliance with teammates who have to be shown. 
Maybe there is a useful link with Hubie Brooks that is left from their Mets 
days together, but both Brooks and Strawberry are right fielders -- unless the 
Dodgers are foolish enough to take up Strawberry's offer to play the minefield 
of center field. 
</P>
<P>
If he was eager to leave the critical New York media, he'll find that the Los 
Angeles media is not the docile housecat it used to be. In effect, New York 
became his home; this is where he grew up. People are much more tolerant of 
their own children than they are of outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
But what are the Mets to do without him? If they continue to harrumph at the 
free-agent marketplace, Cashen, Harazin, Wilpon and Doubleday will join 
M.Donald Grant on the list of one-way thinkers. M. Donald Grant, remember, lost 
Tom Seaver and then declared that he had a wonderful team. 
</P>
<P>
This is really a two-sided failure. One is that the Mets lost Strawberry not 
out of intention -- there doesn't seem to be any plan to guide them -- but by 
default. The other is that Strawberry is leaving not by intention so much as by 
spite. 
</P>
<P>
However much Strawberry hates the word "potential," that's what the Dodgers 
bought. They offered the king's ransom not for what he did in 1989 but for the 
two enchanting five-week segments of 1990. Ten weeks out of 25 isn't bad in 
this day and age. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets' failure was a failure to understand and cope with the nature of the 
man and his day and age. It didn't do any good for Frank Cashen to hold up 
Strawberry's statistics against Stan Musial's and see that Musial's production 
was virtually identical against lefties and righties, at home and on the road. 
So then Cashen evaluated Strawberry in public as a ".260 hitter with 30 homers 
and 80 RBI." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that it was a valid observation is what keeps this from being a civic 
tragedy. Strawberry has never had a Mickey Mantle Triple Crown year and never 
will. But Cashen's comments scarred Strawberry's touchy psyche. 
</P>
<P>
There was good reason not to renegotiate too hard for Strawberry after he came 
out of rehab because nobody knew what he would be. But for the Mets to make 
what amounted to a low-ball offer during the season and then break off talks 
was a mistake of arrogance. Strawberry suggested that the Mets could have kept 
him with an offer comparable to $15 million for four years, which bought Kevin 
Mitchell, or $19.8 million for five years, which bought Don Mattingly. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, or maybe not. The Mets' negotiators didn't grasp that Strawberry was 
free to walk away and the market was signaling the Mets' limit of three years 
was a deception. Wilpon and Doubleday should have been emphatic that this 
should not happen. 
</P>
<P>
The agent, Eric Goldschmidt, has given Strawberry bad advice before, notably 
when he took him out of training camp two springs ago, but the team treated 
Goldschmidt like a twirp. That may be about right, but hell hath no fury like 
an agent scorned, and Strawberry was not one to make an independent decision. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry is not a great player. He is too erratic and too one-dimensional. He 
was, however, the most compelling player in New York. Without him the Mets have 
no real punch. Without him the Mets are not a contender. 
</P>
<P>
The real failing is not that they lost Strawberry but that they have no way to 
replace him. They needed him more than they understood. They have all that 
investment in pitchers who are now at the crest of their careers. They have all 
that meat but no potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps they could restructure around pitching with speed and defense, but they 
have no speed and not much defense. Any argument that the Mets -- after six 
years of more than 3 million tickets sold, and a big TV contract -- were acting 
out of fiscal responsibility is self-serving wind. 
</P>
<P>
The wind just blew Darryl out of town.

ROCKETS START FAST, BUT STRICKLAND HAS A BIG FINISH FOR SPURS, 111-110 
</P>

<P>
The San Antonio Spurs, in their second season with David Robinson, have served 
notice: No lead is too much for them to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
The Houston Rockets, with Akeem Olajuwon putting on a show, built a 60-42 lead 
a few minutes before halftime at San Antonio Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
But a three-point play by Rod Strickland with 3.3 seconds left gave the Spurs a 
111-110 victory. 
</P>
<P>
In the season opener, the Spurs had spotted the Lakers a 14-point lead in the 
first quarter and stormed back to win by 11. Compared with this game, the 
opener was merely routine. In this they cut it about as close as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Strickland, playing his first game of the season, sank a three-point basket 
with 14 seconds left. Then, with the Spurs still trailing, 110-108, he drove 
the baseline, made the layup and was fouled by Olajuwon. Strickland, who missed 
all the exhibition season and the first three games with a stress fracture of 
his fibula, made the free throw to win it, the last of his 27 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wanted to make something happen," Strickland said. "There was no set 
play. I didn't realize until it was over how sore my leg is." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson had 32 points and Olajuwon, who fouled out trying to stop Strickland 
at the end, had 27 and 10 rebounds. DAN HAFNER

SUNS TIE RECORD WITH 173 AGAINST NUGGETS 
</P>

<P>
One thing is sure: The hectic system Paul Westhead used with success in college 
and installed at Denver will put points on the board in bunches. 
</P>
<P>
Also certain is that the Nuggets will produce records -- for running teams with 
superior talent. 
</P>
<P>
The Phoenix Suns fit that category. 
</P>
<P>
The Nuggets, trying to play their racehorse style for the second consecutive 
night, simply weren't up to it Saturday night at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, before settling for a 173-143 victory, the Suns threatened to become 
the first team in NBA history to reach 200 points. As it was, the 173 points 
tied the record for most points by a team in a regulation (48 minutes) game. It 
was set by Boston in 1959 against the Minneapolis Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns shattered the league record for a half by building a 107-67 lead. 
While doing so they also broke the record for a quarter and carried the weary 
Nuggets along for a two-team halftime record. 
</P>
<P>
The old record, set Wednesday by Denver in a loss to San Antonio, was 90 for a 
half and 173 for two teams in a half. 
</P>
<P>
With rookie Cedric Ceballos of Cal State Fullerton scoring 22 points in the 
last nine minutes of the second quarter, the Suns shattered the halftime record 
with 3 1/2 minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
They scored 57 points in the second quarter, breaking the 52 by Baltimore in 
1965. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando Woolridge, who has, under Westhead's system, a chance to bid for the 
scoring title, had 40 points for the Nuggets, who are 0-6. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns, who cooled off considerably in the second half, were ready to run and 
gun. They made 17 of their first 19 shots and it was downhill from then on. 
</P>
<P>
Other records that fell to the Suns were most baskets in a half (43) and most 
assists (33). 
</P>
<P>
Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons used his reserves early and often. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 104, Philadelphia 88 -- Charles Barkley of the 76ers thought this was 
the season his team would achieve greatness. 
</P>
<P>
But that was before the injury that might have knocked playmaker Johnny Dawkins 
out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
In their first game without Dawkins, who will undergo knee surgery this week, 
the 76ers couldn't generate an offense at Richfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Green started at guard in place of Dawkins and he had eight assists, but 
he was only two for 10 from the field. The 26 points in the first quarter was 
the Philadelphia high mark for the game. The 76ers scored only 43 points in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley had 31 of the 88 points. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Nance scored 23 for the Cavaliers, but when the 6-10 forward blocked an 
attempted dunk by 7-7 Manute Bol in the second period, he inspired his 
teammates. They went on an 18-4 run to take command before intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 105, New Jersey 91 -- It was a much more difficult game at Boston for 
the Celtics than the final score indicates. 
</P>
<P>
The Nets led by 10 points late in the third quarter. They still had an 89-86 
lead with 6:28 to play. 
</P>
<P>
But, as he has done so many times, Larry Bird took charge. He had four points, 
two assists and a steal to lead a 19-2 run that enabled the Celtics to improve 
their record to 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Nets scored only one basket in the last seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
A jump shot by Brian Shaw gave the Celtics a 90-89 lead with 5:58 left. With 
the Nets unable to score, it soon became a rout. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 105, Charlotte 86 -- After losing two in a row at home, the Bulls 
finally found a team they could handle at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan, still recovering from flu, played 36 minutes and contributed 23 
points, eight rebounds and six assists. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls' defense held the Hornets to 38 points in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago Coach Phil Jackson is glad he was able to give his bench adequate work. 
Reserves had 37 points and 18 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to give the second unit some kind of identity," Jackson said. "It's 
nice to have a three-game winning streak to take out on the road." 
</P>
<P>
Miami 120, Indiana 105 -- Kevin Edwards had 13 of his 30 points in the third 
quarter at Miami to help the Heat win handily. 
</P>
<P>
The Heat led, 58-56, at halftime, but they scored the first 11 points of the 
second half, five by Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Miller, who finished with 29 points, got the Pacers to within six in the 
fourth quarter, but no closer. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 117, Seattle 100 -- With the SuperSonics' experiment of playing a 
home game at Tacoma backfiring, Portland is now the only unbeaten team in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Mullin and Tim Hardaway each scored 27 points and sparked a 14-2 run in 
the third quarter that put the Warriors (4-2) in control. 
</P>
<P>
New York 93, Sacramento 88 -- Patrick Ewing scored 24 points at Sacramento as 
the Knicks warmed up for tonight's game against the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings, 0-5 this season, have lost 11 in a row since April 10. DAN HAFNER

THEY'RE BEST OF WEST, BUT GET NO RESPECT;

<P>
COLLEGE NOTES: LOYOLA MARYMOUNT'S BASKETBALL TEAM HAS TO PROVE ITSELF AGAIN 
DESPITE AN IMPRESSIVE LIST OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Has it been a mirage, a five-year hallucination? 
</P>
<P>
It is there in print for anyone who wants to bother to check: the Loyola 
Marymount basketball team not only led the nation in scoring the past three 
seasons and shattered nearly every collegiate scoring record, but over the past 
five seasons had the best record among West Coast teams. Better than UCLA, 
Oregon State, UC Santa Barbara and Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Lions had a better record in the past three seasons than any team 
in the West with the exception of Arizona and Nevada-Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
And the Lions return several starters and eight lettermen from last season's 
Final Eight team. 
</P>
<P>
None of that seems to have mattered with the national pollsters, who seem to 
feel that with Hank Gathers, Bo Kimble and Jeff Fryer gone and Paul Westhead 
having moved on to the NBA, Loyola is again in a prove-it situation. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody at Loyola is claiming there is another Gathers or Kimble on this 
season's team, but it's a bit disconcerting that so many of the players who 
helped dismantle defending champion Michigan -- among other teams -- in the 
NCAA tournament in March should get so little respect. 
</P>
<P>
A backcourt of swift point guard Tony Walker, scorer Terrell Lowery and 
kamikaze defender Tom Peabody might be considered a fearsome trio in the 
Atlantic Coast Conference or Big East, but as Loyola's representatives they 
couldn't even manage to make the all-underrated listing in the Sporting News. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lions seem to enjoy the underdog role. Maybe it gives them an edge. 
</P>
<P>
"I like my team," said Jay Hillock, who takes over the team after five seasons 
as Westhead's assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Hillock doesn't have -- or covet -- Westhead's aura of nutty professor, but at 
the West Coast Conference media day last week he said: "As a coach I'm very 
confident. We'll play along the same lines (as Westhead). I have big shoes to 
fill, but I think it will be easier to replace the coach than Gathers and 
Kimble. Our system with less firepower, our margin of error is not that great. 
(But) things are good in Lion country. We have enough maturity to make some 
impact." 
</P>
<P>
Lowery, a junior who is expected to assume the bulk of the scoring 
responsibilities, said he's not bothered by the apparent lack of respect. 
</P>
<P>
"Hank and Bo were great players, but the system made them great players," he 
said. "They didn't score that much (as freshmen) at USC. Anything is possible 
in our system. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people thought Hank and Bo were a flash in the pan. We might be capable 
of more flashes in the pan. We do have something to prove." 
</P>
<P>
The Lions play what the Sporting News rates as the toughest December schedule 
in the nation, with road games against preseason Top 10 teams UCLA, Oklahoma, 
Louisiana State and Georgia Tech. So they may start the new year with a 
mediocre record. 
</P>
<P>
West Coast Conference Commissioner Michael Gilleran said if people fail to give 
the Lions the respect they have earned, "they're not people who understand 
college basketball." 
</P>
<P>
"We feel you're better off to show what you have against the best," he said. 
"If it results in losses to Top 20 teams on the road, so be it. You like to be 
in a nice neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
After Loyola bid farewell to basketball standouts Bo Kimble, Jeff Fryer and the 
late Hank Gathers last season, Hillock said there were qualities about them 
that the Lions would miss beyond their scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers and Kimble gained notoriety while leading the nation in scoring in 
consecutive seasons, and Fryer set NCAA records for his three-point shooting. 
What the public didn't see, according to Hillock, was a toughness that came out 
in pressure situations. 
</P>
<P>
"If we needed a big rebound or a big defensive play, Hank or Bo would get it," 
Hillock said. "And Fryer and Per Stumer were tough kids" 
</P>
<P>
Although his practices and scrimmages have been termed "brutal" by the players, 
Hillock isn't sure how tough his team will be. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not a really physical team," he said. "The Peabodys and O'Connells are 
going to have to be the enforcer types -- and hopefully the Czech (Richard 
Petruska). He's a wide-body type but I just haven't seen enough of him to 
evaluate his game." 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Dominguez Hills placed three players on the 10-man All-California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. soccer first team and had seven players honored 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors Martin Mira, Mark Lincir and Mark Merino all earned first-team honors, 
and another senior, Kaveh Razaghi, was named to the second team. Three Toro 
underclassmen, junior goalie Steve Bame, freshman Clemente Gonzales and 
sophomore Tony Grilli, received honorable mention. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Bakersfield junior midfielder Leslie O'Connor was named CCAA most 
valuable player and Bakersfield's Simon Tobin was the coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The Dominguez Hills golf team, coached by John Johnson, is ranked in the 
Division II Top 20 for the seventh consecutive year. The Toros are 20th in the 
1991 preseason poll. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, the senior member of the Dominguez Hills athletic department -- his 
1968 golf team marked the opening of the athletic department -- said "this 
could be one of our best teams" and he has high hopes for adding to the 
school's list of All-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros' best team, in 1985, produced two All-Americans -- Patrick Burke and 
Mack Smith -- on its way to a No. 7 ranking. Scott MacDonald earned All-America 
honors in 1983 and '84, and Burke also earned academic All-American honors in 
1985. Johnson has also produced two pros: Burke is on the PGA Tour and Eugene 
Hardy, a 1977 graduate, is the teaching pro at Victoria Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
This year's top player appears to be Enrico Montano, who has shot rounds of 69 
twice in the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a shot at the PGA Tour," Johnson said. "He is a dedicated golfer. He 
really works at his game. He's not only a good player physically, but mentally 
he's very sharp." 
</P>
<P>
The Toros open the season in February, when Johnson embarks on his 43rd year of 
coaching. He started out in the profession as an assistant football coach at 
UCLA in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a six decade man," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills sophomore Amy Rubin could become the soccer team's career 
scoring leader midway through next season. With 19 goals this season, she has 
25 in her career, nine short of breaking Kristi White's school record. White 
also holds the record for career points with 97. Rubin has 57. . . . The Loyola 
Marymount soccer team finished the season with a 3-18 record. Tommy Stevenson 
and Eric Hill tied for the team scoring lead with 12 points. Stevenson, a 
senior, was the top goal-scorer with six. . . . Loyola basketball co-captain 
Tom Peabody, who suffered a detached retina over the summer, will wear goggles 
when playing this season. "They wouldn't let me play without them," he said.

SIBBALD REMAINS ON THE HEAT'S HOT SEAT; 
</P>
<P>
SOCCER: COACH'S FUTURE WITH TEAM IS STILL IN DOUBT DESPITE ASSURANCES FROM 
EXECUTIVES THAT HE WILL BE BACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bobby Sibbald's status as coach of the Los Angeles Heat received a boost when 
General Manager Dick White said "Bobby's got this job as long as he wants it." 
</P>
<P>
But Sibbald, who said he has not been contacted by anyone from the Heat, 
including White, since the season ended in mid-September, still faces 
opposition from some owners and players. 
</P>
<P>
Said club President John Ajemian: "Some of the owners did not like the way 
(Sibbald) handled them. He was very difficult to talk to and after a loss he 
was impossible to talk to." 
</P>
<P>
At least four names have been discussed by owners as a possible replacement for 
Sibbald and one area coach, who asked not to be named, said he was contacted by 
a Heat owner about handling the team next season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time for a change and I think most of the owners feel that way," said 
part-owner Dave Graefe. "I'm not putting the knock on Bobby. He's a great guy. 
But a change would do this team good." 
</P>
<P>
However, White said, "There's no truth in the world that (he will be let go) 
unless he doesn't want to come back." 
</P>
<P>
White and Sibbald have known each other since Sibbald came to California from 
England about 20 years ago to play for the Los Angeles Aztecs of the defunct 
North American Soccer League. White worked in the Aztec front office and was 
present when Sibbald's jersey was retired by the Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
Sibbald went on to several youth coaching jobs, including stops at Redondo 
Union High and with a top South Bay club, Torrance United. Sibbald left soccer 
to enter private business about eight years ago, but he resurfaced as an 
assistant coach with the Heat in 1989. He assumed the head coaching job last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
His mood last season sometimes bordered on being cantankerous. When the Heat 
qualified for the playoffs, he announced that he would no longer speak to the 
press, although he broke his silence two weeks later. He also accused a 
reporter of negative reporting, but phoned the reporter after the season to 
apologize. 
</P>
<P>
Ajemian said some owners and players were also unhappy with Sibbald's lack of 
direction at practices. Said one player who asked not to be identified: "I 
think he should have been harder on us." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the season Sibbald said that Heat players were "the most talented in 
the league" and he insisted that he could not drive them as hard as players who 
were being paid full-time salaries to play. Most Heat players held day jobs and 
received a stipend for playing with the team. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent owners meeting, Ajemian said he was told by several owners that 
they were angry that Sibbald did not have the Heat practice penalty kick 
shooting. Leading in games, 1-0, the Heat lost the second end of the APSL 
championship series with San Francisco on penalty kicks, 4-2, and went on to 
lose the title in the ensuing mini-game. 
</P>
<P>
Said Ajemian: "I still say he's a very good coach, but he has to get mentally 
in to it and dedicate himself more. If he will do that, I will have no problem 
with him returning." 
</P>
<P>
Other Heat owners did not return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
At one time last year, Sibbald, who holds a full-time job as a salesman for a 
hair products company, said he was frustrated with the job and wanted to quit. 
Sibbald said Tuesday that he changed his mind during the final weeks of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I will be back," he said. "I think Dick (White) expects me to be back, 
but I haven't talked to any of the owners." 
</P>
<P>
White, who was hired in September, said no contracts have been offered to 
anyone, including players, although most of the team is expected to return. 
White said that is standard procedure this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
Sibbald said that if he is rehired he will hold three practices a week, not 
two, as was the case last season. However, Sibbald said the most pressing issue 
the team faces is securing a permanent practice facility. Last season the club 
practiced at four locations. 
</P>
<P>
"We were like Gypsies," he said. "You can't expect players to drive in, some 
from an hour away, and then not have a place to practice." 
</P>
<P>
As for the squabble over penalty kicks, he said, "I didn't hear anyone 
complaining when we were winning (games by penalty kicks) during the season." 
</P>
<P>
The Heat won three of four regular-season games decided by penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
Sibbald blamed himself for the team's lackluster showing in the first half of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I was playing players in positions where I shouldn't have been playing them," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the team owners need to communicate better with the coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them that the coach should be invited to the owners meetings that they 
have once a month," he said. "They should listen to him. Have any of them 
played this game professionally (like me)? We could learn from what happened in 
the (North American Soccer League). At least they could listen, then decide 
what to do. Then, after the coach has said what he wants, if they want to do 
something on their own, they can ask him to leave."

ON A TIP, CSUN FALLS BY A POINT; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: MATADORS' PLAYOFF HOPES ARE IN LIMBO AFTER FLUKE TWO-POINT 
CONVERSION LIFTS CAL STATE LONG BEACH, 25-24. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is surely little consolation to Cal State Northridge, but the Matadors have 
earned one man's support in their quest to earn a berth in the Division II 
football playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
That man is Coach George Allen of Cal State Long Beach, whose team squeaked 
past the Matadors, 25-24, Saturday in a nonconference game before a crowd of 
3,090 at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Northridge, Allen doesn't get to vote today when an NCAA 
national committee sits down to decide whether the Matadors and their 7-3 
record belong in the 16-team playoff field. 
</P>
<P>
However, if anyone should happen to call and ask . . . 
</P>
<P>
As he met CSUN Coach Bob Burt on the field after the 49ers had won by the 
slimmest of margins, Allen said, "I hope they call me to see, because you 
should be in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
There would be no question of that had Long Beach (5-5) not scored on a 
two-point conversion with 1 minute 17 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
And it wasn't just that the 49ers converted. It was the way they converted. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton Bamberg, CSUN's safety, probably will remember it for quite a while. He 
got a hand on the pass thrown by Long Beach quarterback Todd Studer, but 
instead of batting the ball down he tipped it up and it landed in the arms of 
49er receiver Mark Seay in the corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a difference of inches," Burt said. "If he tips the ball down, we win the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Northridge will have to wait until today to see if the NCAA dares 
invite a team with three losses -- although only one of them came against a 
Division II team. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors were ranked 13th in this week's Division II poll, giving them 
small margin for error. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge received an assist Saturday night from UC Davis, which defeated 
16th-ranked Sonoma State, 12-7. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge came frustratingly close to deciding its own fate. After Long Beach 
scored 14 unanswered points in the third quarter to go ahead, 17- 10, the 
Matadors came back with two touchdowns of their own to lead, 24-17, with 10:39 
left. 
</P>
<P>
A sprained ankle relegated All-American tailback Albert Fann to kickoff-return 
duty, but the Northridge rushing game didn't exactly grind to a halt. The 
Matadors rushed for 229 yards, including 121 in 13 carries by reserve tailback 
Victor DeVaughn. 
</P>
<P>
And Fann got the milestone he hoped to reach. He returned three kickoffs for 58 
yards and became the fifth player in NCAA history (all divisions) to surpass 
the 7,000 mark in all-purpose yardage. Fann has 7,034. 
</P>
<P>
So Fann got his yardage, his understudies -- DeVaughn, Oscar Pittman and 
fullbacks Jason Ferguson and Anthony Nicholson -- successfully filled the 
rushing void and the Northridge defense turned in an inspiring fourth-quarter 
goal-line stand -- turning away the 49ers on four plays inside the three-yard 
line. 
</P>
<P>
All for naught. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like all in one play," Ferguson said. "Your heart stops. You see the tip, 
the continuation, and the catch and your heart is broken." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach's final touchdown came on a 21-yard pass to Jeff Exum from Studer, 
the former Simi Valley High and Valley College quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
It was set up on a 30-yard punt return by Freddie Leslie that gave the 49ers 
the ball at the Northridge 24 with 1:43 left. On the second play from there, 
Exum beat LaVelle Parker on a corner pattern and Studer hit him in full stride 
for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach took a timeout to consider its options, but the decision to go for 
the win wasn't a tough one: It has been 36 years since an Allen-coached team 
finished with a losing record. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers lined up with two wide receivers to the right and sent Leslie, the 
tailback, in motion to the same side. Studer took the snap and rolled right, 
but everyone was covered. He attempted to pass anyway and Bamberg was the only 
player close enough to get a hand on the ball. Seay, standing behind him, 
cradled the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't lose the game," Northridge quarterback Sherdrick Bonner said. "It 
was just a fluke. The defensive back was there and he made the play. The ball 
just went up instead of down. It just wasn't meant to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge had a last chance, taking the ball at its 43 and moving to the Long 
Beach 46 before the drive stalled. Abo Velasco attempted a desperation 65-yard 
field goal as time ran out. The kick landed on the three-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors last led, 24-17, when Ferguson scored on an 18-yard run with 10:39 
to play. Five minutes before, DeVaughn had broken loose for an 80-yard 
touchdown sprint to tie the score, 17-17. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN led at the half, 10-3, scoring on a 40-yard keeper by Bonner and a 38-yard 
field goal by Velasco. 
</P>
<P>
Studer completed 19 of 36 passes for 278 yards and two touchdowns. Besides the 
one to Exum, Studer hit Sean Foster for a 32-yard score in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Cheevers, who played at Thousand Oaks High and Moorpark College, made a 
47-yard field goal for Long Beach's only points of the first half.

GAINING GROUND 
</P>
<P>
Torrance provided an answer Friday night for those still wondering if the 
Tartars had a running game after losing tailback Carlos Hilliard to a broken 
leg Sept. 27. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got two running backs," said Coach Rich Busia, after Torrance forced a 
three-way tie for the Pioneer League title with a 13-10 victory over host West 
Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Scott Hagerman led the way with 117 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries, 
while senior Tony Lomeli added 74 yards on 16 carries in Torrance's most 
productive rushing performance since the talented Hilliard went down. 
</P>
<P>
It couldn't have come at a better time for the Tartars, who will open the 
CIF-Southern Section Division VIII playoffs Friday with a road game. 
</P>
<P>
"When Hilliard got hurt, we were kind of flip-flopping around," Busia said. 
"Then we got Hagerman stepping up, and now Lomeli." 
</P>
<P>
The presence of the strong ground attack to go along with the passing of 
quarterback Jason Kendall gives Torrance what it has been lacking in recent 
weeks -- a balanced offense. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes a big difference," Busia said. "Now we've got the running part and 
the passing part. It puts us back in our rhythm. It makes it difficult for 
opponents to figure out what we want to do." 
</P>
<P>
Hagerman said he felt vindicated by Torrance's rushing performance against a 
West defense that was hampered by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"(West) said we had a weak running game," he said. "But me and Lomeli proved 
that wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Hagerman also had a big night kicking the ball. He made two field goals, 
including a 17-yarder with one second left to win the game. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MR. CLUTCH 
</P>
<P>
Kendall, the Torrance quarterback, was flawless on the game-winning drive, 
which started at the Tartar 20-yard line with 1:56 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
The junior completed consecutive passes of 19, 13 and 22 yards to receiver 
Ralph Martinez, moving the ball to the West 26. From there, Torrance ran into 
position for Hagerman's field goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the clutch situations. It's like when the bases are loaded and you get 
a base hit," said Kendall, who plays catcher on the Tartar baseball team. "I 
think we're a good pressure-situation team." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UPSTAGING A STAR 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes running back George Felactu has heard a lot about Robert Coulter, 
his counterpart at Rolling Hills. After all, Coulter leads the South Bay in 
rushing and gets his share of publicity. 
</P>
<P>
But on Friday afternoon, it was Felactu's turn to shine. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-8, 215-pound senior sparked an improbable 45-20 come-from-behind 
victory by rushing for 208 yards and three touchdowns on 22 carries. Felactu's 
54-yard run set up Palos Verdes' first touchdown in a 30-point second quarter, 
helping wipe out a 14-0 Rolling Hills lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been hearing all the time that Robert Coulter is the best back on the PV 
peninsula," Felactu said. "I wanted to show that I'm in contention for that. 
That's what I tried to do." 
</P>
<P>
Coulter, hindered by a twisted ankle, finished with only 60 yards on 14 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GETTING EVEN 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes Coach Bill Judy said his team was ready to play after being the 
target of Rolling Hills' taunts and pranks last week. 
</P>
<P>
Judy said Palos Verdes' bleachers were smeared with motor oil and manure 
Wednesday night, and his players were taunted by members of Rolling Hills' 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"All week long they were telling our kids they were going to kick our butts," 
he said. "They came down and vandalized the school. It cost us thousands of 
dollars to get (the bleachers) cleaned up." 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes defensive end Andrew Miller said he was confronted at a hamburger 
stand Friday morning by several Rolling Hills' players. 
</P>
<P>
"I went in to get some food with my mom," Miller said. "A whole bunch of them 
came in saying how PV was going to lose how they were going to beat the tar out 
of us. I made a fast exit. 
</P>
<P>
"When I told my teammates, they were pretty (mad). We were already enthused 
before that. But that got us even more pumped up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TOUCH OF CLASS 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills Coach Gary Kimbrell, as usual, was gracious in defeat. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't rant and rave. He didn't blame the officials. And he avoided blaming 
his players, who played less than an inspiring game. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, he was hurting more for his team than he was for himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hate to see the kids go out like that," Kimbrell said. "They played so 
hard and improved so much in the last three weeks. Then to come in and lose 
like this, I know they feel bad. I'm still proud of the way they came through." 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrell said all week he felt like a man awaiting his own execution. The 
premonition proved to be prophetic, considering Friday's result. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in knots the whole time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kimbrell's uneasiness might have had something to do with the Jekyll and Hyde 
character of his team. From week to week, it was impossible to predict which 
Rolling Hills team would take the field -- the one that beat West Torrance, 
South Torrance, Redondo and Torrance, or the one that played poorly in losses 
to Mary Star, Morningside and, finally, Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PLAYOFF PICTURE 
</P>
<P>
Following is a rundown of South Bay qualifiers for the CIF-Southern Section 
playoffs: 
</P>
<P>
Bay League -- Hawthorne and Leuzinger tied for title, but Hawthorne enters 
Division III playoffs as league's No. 1 team because it beat Leuzinger. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean League -- Morningside is champion and Mira Costa is runner-up. Palos 
Verdes, which finished in three-way tie for third, goes to Division VIII 
playoffs as No. 3 entry because it had lower point differential against 
Morningside than Redondo or Rolling Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneer League -- Torrance, West and South finished in three-way tie for title. 
A drawing determined that South enters Division VIII playoffs as league's No. 1 
team, West No. 2 and Torrance No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Camino Real League -- Serra is champion and will be top seeded in Division VII 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Valley League -- Third-place El Segundo should earn at-large bid 
in Division VII playoffs because of 5-4-1 overall record. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TACKLES, TACKLES 
</P>
<P>
Carson defensive end Bob Tuitau had 12 tackles Friday night in a 21-7 victory 
over Dorsey to become only the third player in school history to record more 
than 100 tackles in two consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Tuitau, a 6-foot-1, 210-pound senior, has 109 tackles in nine games this 
season. He recorded 108 last season, when he was named to the All-L.A. City 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Tuitau joins linebacker Rowan Tupuivao (1971-72) and defensive back Clemont 
Williams (1977-78) as the only Carson players to have back-to-back 100-tackle 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STREAK BUSTERS 
</P>
<P>
Miraleste's season ended on a rather embarrassing note Friday night at Pius X 
High in Downey. Pius X beat the Marauders, 20-15, to snap the longest losing 
streak in the CIF-Southern Section at 28 games. 
</P>
<P>
"You could hear a pin drop on the way home," said Miraleste Coach Tony Bantula, 
whose team finished in last place in the Camino Real League with an 0-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
The Marauders led, 15-6, after three quarters, but critical turnovers 
(quarterback Steve Cooper threw five interceptions in the game) contributed to 
the fourth-quarter collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"We just fell apart," Bantula said. "We're not a fourth-quarter team. This has 
happened to us all year." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the disappointment, Bantula said he is looking forward to next season, 
when Miraleste will return 20 of 23 varsity players. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be our turn next year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That is, if Miraleste is still open. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STREAKS 
</P>
<P>
* Serra defeated Verbum Dei, 54-14, to extend its winning streak to 22 games 
and sew up its fourth consecutive Camino Real League title. 
</P>
<P>
* Narbonne fell to San Pedro, 42-0, extending its losing streak to 16 games. 
San Pedro snapped a five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
* Inglewood fell to Leuzinger, 53-0, for its 19th consecutive Bay League 
defeat. The Sentinels last won a league game in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
* West Torrance fell to Torrance, 13-10, ending a league winning streak of 11 
games and an overall streak of six games. 
</P>
<P>
* Bishop Montgomery defeated Chaminade, 14-3, to snap a league losing streak of 
13 games dating back to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
* Hawthorne fell to Santa Monica, 15-14, ending a six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IN QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
Torrance running back-kicker Scott Hagerman, on a 13-10 victory over West 
Torrance that gave the Tartars a share of the Pioneer League title: "It was do 
or die. We win it, we're champs. We lose it, we go home; we're nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes defensive end Andrew Miller, on teammate George Felactu, who 
rushed for 208 yards and three TDs in a 45-20 victory over Rolling Hills: 
"George is great. Everybody should have a George. He's pretty much the whole 
offense." 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne Coach Goy Casillas, on his team's 15-14 upset loss to Santa Monica: 
"This gives us an opportunity for introspection. We have to take a harder look 
at ourselves and not be so impressed with our record. It's possible that we 
went into the game with our chests out a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey tailback Lamont Warren, on the Dons' 21-7 loss to Carson: "They were 
just better than us. We don't have any excuses. They beat us clean and fair." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
* Morningside fullback-linebacker Danny Katoa sat out a 51-8 victory over 
Centennial with a sprained left knee, but Coach Ron Tatum expects the senior 
back in the lineup for Friday's playoff opener. 
</P>
<P>
* Josh Gormley, West Torrance's standout lineman, was forced to the sideline 
several times in a 13-10 loss to Torrance because of a back injury. ROB FERNAS 
and DAVID RAATZ

AFTER 4 OVERTIMES, MASTER'S WINS TITLE ON PENALTY KICKS

The Master's College earned a berth in the National Assn. of Intercollegiate 
Athletics soccer championships Saturday with a 3-2 victory over visiting 
Westmont in the final of the District 3 championships. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs (9-10-3) needed more than three hours, four overtimes and a 
penalty-kick session to advance to their first national postseason soccer 
tournament, which will be held Nov. 19-24 in Boca Raton, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs reached the district final last season before losing to Westmont, 
4-0. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest win in the history of the school," said Mustang Coach Mark 
Schubert, who got an NFL-style cooling-off after the game. "In my coaching 
career, it's the biggest win." 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 2-2, after regulation, two 15-minute overtimes and two 
15-minute sudden-death periods, the game came down to penalty kicks. Each team 
had five chances to beat the opposing goalkeeper one on one. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Spencer of Master's scored against goalkeeper David Buehring and 
Westmont's Cees Molenaar scored against goalie Allan Bowden. Each team was 
stopped on its next attempt before Ezekiel Bongarra put the Mustangs ahead, 
2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Westmont's next attempt went wide right, then Master's took a 3-1 lead when 
Jorge Barba put a shot into the upper-right corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
Westmont (12-8-1) cut the lead to one but freshman Harlan Slind powered a goal 
into the right corner to clinch the victory as the crowd of 2,500 roared and 
Slind sprinted, hands raised, toward the other end of the field.

HARTMAN, DROSSIN FIND CONDITIONS MORE DIFFICULT THAN COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unseasonably warm November day bothered many runners in the Southern Section 
cross-country preliminaries Saturday, although the favored teams and 
individuals managed to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Hartman of Canyon and Agoura's Deena Drossin, contenders for the Division 
I boys' and girls' titles, won their heats by considerable margins but both 
said their wins did not come easily. 
</P>
<P>
Hartman timed 15 minutes 24 seconds over the challenging, three-mile Mt. San 
Antonio College course, finishing 24 seconds ahead of Dana Hills' Dan 
Niednagel. Drossin clocked 17:54 in winning her heat by almost a minute over 
teammate Tiffany York. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not comfortable," Drossin said of her win. "It was the heat. I couldn't 
have gone any faster than that." 
</P>
<P>
Hartman, who ran 14:51 in the Mt. SAC Invitational on Oct. 20, said he ran 
primarily for the win and will face Arroyo Grande's Louie Quintana in the 
final, Nov. 17 at Mt. SAC. Quintana's time of 14:47 was the fastest of the day. 
</P>
<P>
The heat was especially tough on Fillmore's Maribella Aparicio. Last year's 1-A 
Division champion collapsed about 100 yards from the finish while running in 
sixth place. She later recovered. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, the Hart boys' and Agoura girls' teams, ranked second and first in 
the state, easily won their heats. 
</P>
<P>
Hart placed five runners among the top seven finishers to win its heat with 25 
points, well ahead of Dana Hills (72) and Canyon (96). 
</P>
<P>
Billy Dixon led the Indians with a third-place finish in 15:57 and sophomore 
Keith Grossman was fourth in 16:05.

PEDROZA, IFYOUCOULDSEEMENOW TAKE AIM AT STARLET AFTER UPSET VICTORY IN MOCCASIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Martin Pedroza doesn't have any doubts about Ifyoucouldseemenow's ability to 
handle a mile in the $500,000 Hollywood Starlet two weeks from now. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the jockey says the impressive winner of Saturday's $105,550 Moccasin 
Breeders' Cup Stakes will be even more effective with added distance. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the longer she goes, the better she'll be," Pedroza said after the 
2-year-old Tunerup filly, who went off at 9-1, beat favored Cuddles by 1 1/2 
lengths in 1:16 1/5 for the 6 1/2 furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
"She galloped out pretty strong and she can rate. She can be up on the lead, 
but she doesn't have to be in front." 
</P>
<P>
Consistent is one thing Ifyoucouldseemenow, who is trained by Brian Mayberry 
and owned by Jan, Mace and Samantha Siegel, has been. She now has three 
victories in five starts and has yet to finish off the board. 
</P>
<P>
On the rail in the field of 11, Ifyoucouldseemenow broke well and Pedroza was 
more than happy to let Mobile Phone, the 3-1 second choice who broke slowly, 
rush up along the inside of him down the backside. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, the rail has been watery, like muddy, the last couple of days," he 
said. "I didn't want to be down in there. I just wanted to make sure we broke 
good because we had such a bad post position. 
</P>
<P>
"She broke good and when we got out there it was just a matter of being 
patient. I knew when I asked her for a response she would give it to me. 
</P>
<P>
"She's 100% better now than she was in the summer. She's getting better and 
better. When I work her in the morning, she relaxes really well. I'm real happy 
to win for Brian and the Siegels because they've been good to me." 
</P>
<P>
Making her first start since winning the Junior Miss Aug. 1 at Del Mar, Cuddles 
outfinished 8-1 shot Far Out Nurse by a head for the place. 
</P>
<P>
Riding Cuddles, who had spent some time on the veterinarian's list after her 
second victory, Gary Stevens was enthused about her chances in the Starlet. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved her race," he said. "I thought she ran big. She's got the right kind 
of style and everything and she finished up very nice. She's a real sweetheart, 
real easy to place." 
</P>
<P>
Perfect in two tries in Maryland, Far Out Nurse probably won't be hanging 
around for the Starlet, if jockey Rick Wilson is correct. 
</P>
<P>
"She started to make up some ground late in the race, but then her shin got to 
bothering her and she couldn't hold up," he said. "She was supposed to run in 
the Starlet, but I don't think so now." 
</P>
<P>
Dorky closed decently to be fourth, then came Ever A Lady, Island Choice, La 
Bizcocho, Mobile Phone, Nikki's Baby, Ultra Sass and Sea Art. 
</P>
<P>
Itsallgreektome, who was beaten by a neck by Royal Academy in the Breeders' Cup 
Mile, is the 3-1 morning line favorite in today's $200,000 Hollywood Derby. 
</P>
<P>
A 37-1 shot at Belmont Park Oct. 27, Itsallgreektome had the lead approaching 
the wire, but was outfinished by Royal Academy and Lester Piggott. 
</P>
<P>
Another European-based horse, Septieme Ciel, will be trying to thwart 
Itsallgreektome today and the son of Seattle Slew is the 7-2 second choice. 
</P>
<P>
Victorious under 138 pounds in his last race at Longchamp, Septieme Ciel will 
be dropping 16 pounds in the Derby, which will be run at 1 1/8 miles on the 
turf. He has won five of 12 starts in France and will be ridden by Kent 
Desormeaux. 
</P>
<P>
Christiane Head, the daughter of French trainer Alec Head, will be in to saddle 
the colt, but he will remain in Richard Mandella's care after the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
John Gosden, who won a division of the 1983 Derby with Royal Heroine, will be 
back in the United States for the first time since returning to England late in 
1988. He will saddle Anshan, a Persian Gold colt who has won four of his 11 
starts. He is 8-1 on Russell Hudak's morning line and will be handled by Chris 
McCarron. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the field includes In Excess, who has back-to-back stakes 
victories; Silver Ending, the 125-pound highweight; Noble Dr., Bold Liloy, 
Barton Dene, Marquetry, Seti I., Intimiste and Worthington Winner. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Great Communicator, who broke down and had to be destroyed after Monday's 
Carleton F. Burke Handicap at Santa Anita, has been buried in the infield at 
Hollywood Park. . . . Fantastic Look, who came within a nose of upsetting 
Bayakoa in Del Mar's Chula Vista Handicap, finished fourth as the 6-5 favorite 
in the Churchill Downs Budweiser Breeders' Cup Saturday. Chris McCarron rode 
the filly for trainer Gary Jones. The winner by a neck was Oh My Jessica Pie, 
an 8-1 shot ridden by Mike Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time at the meeting, there were perfect tickets in the Pick Six. 
Eleven tickets had six winners and each was worth $49,675.40. . . . Alex Solis 
won twice Saturday to maintain his lead in the jockey standings after the first 
four days. He has seven winners, one more than Kent Desormeaux, who also had 
two victories Saturday.

night with a 26-11 victory over Long Beach City College at Murdock Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The victory also earned a bowl bid for the Warriors (7-2 overall, 6-2 in league 
play) on Dec. 1 and at least a tie for first in the 16-member league. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach, with one game remain on its schedule, fell to 4-5 and 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors were impressive in the first half. They scored three times in the 
first quarter, which lasted 55 minutes and had a total of 135 yards of 
penalties. The Warriors scored on drives of 75, 56 and 64 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Rod Harvey was impressive in the first half, completing 14 of 19 
passes for 169 yards and two touchdowns. He finished with 17 of 27 for 193 
yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Tony DaCosta ran nine yards for the Warriors' first score with 
10:21 left in the first quarter. Harvey threw a 12-yard pass to Calbert Johnson 
for the second touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey threw a 46-yard pass to Steve Danzy for the his second touchdown, which 
came on a third-and-five situation. The score gave El Camino a 20-0 halftime 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Vikings were struggling and getting called for numerous 
penalties. There were several scuffles early in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach gained only 54 yards in the first half and quarterback Stevie Jones, 
who was benched at the start of the second half, completed only one of six 
passes for 20 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Things only got worse for the Vikings in the second half. Keith Huff fumbled on 
the second play of the third quarter and El Camino defensive back Anthony Cole 
recovered at the Long Beach six-yard line. One play later, Harvey passed to 
Daigle for a six-yard touchdown to give El Camino a 26-0 lead.

Cheered on by the Carpinteria High football team, which had more than a slight 
interest in the outcome, Bishop Diego defeated Oak Park, 18-3, Saturday night 
in a Tri-Valley League game at San Marcos High. 
</P>
<P>
Oak Park (6-4, 3-1 in league play) must share the league title with 
Carpinteria. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Diego's Benito Rivera hauled in a 34-yard pass from Richie Donati in the 
first quarter to open the scoring. Howie Dougherty added a touchdown later in 
the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The only bright moment for Oak Park came in the second quarter on a 24-yard 
Mike Stern field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Diego scored its final touchdown when Oak Park's Wes Lones fumbled the 
second-half kickoff and Danny Kendrick recovered the ball at the Eagle 28. 
Donati, 10 of 20 for 89 yards and one interception, then passed four yards for 
his second touchdown. ROB SONNER

P. J. Jones of Rolling Hills drove to a 50-lap main-event victory in the U. S. 
Auto Club's National Midget race at Ventura Raceway on Saturday night on a 
wind-swept, super-slick quarter-mile dirt oval that produced numerous 
spin-outs. 
</P>
<P>
A field that included more than 70 cars also slowed the action as the program 
fell more than 90 minutes behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who finished seventh in the USAC Western States Series points standings, 
held off Jeff Gordon of Pittsboro, Ind., and Mike Streicher of Findlay, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon and Streicher finished second and third, respectively, although Gordon 
continues to lead the national points standings over Streicher, 463-451, with 
three races remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon went wire to wire to win a 10-lap semi-main event and qualify for the 
feature. 
</P>
<P>
Still to be determined at press time was Jay Drake's bid to seal the Western 
States Series three-quarter Midget championship. Drake holds a 52-point lead 
over Cory Kruseman of Ventura. PAUL OLSON

Antelope Valley 12, Mt. San Jacinto 7 -- Despite a school-record 11 fumbles, 
Antelope Valley remains in the hunt for the Foothill Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
The conference title will be decided Saturday when Antelope Valley plays at 
Citrus. Citrus (7-2, 7-0) set up the championship game with a 14-8 win over 
Desert (6-4, 6-2). 
</P>
<P>
The Marauders (8-1, 6-1) lost four of the fumbles, but their defense more than 
compensated, coming up with five interceptions, three by Birk Sopsher. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. San Jacinto (6-3, 4-3) was held in check for most of the night but cut the 
deficit to 12-7 when quarterback Vince Daley ran 10 yards on the first play of 
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Washington ran 39 yards and Jason Camp kicked 37- and 41-yard field goals 
to account for Antelope Valley's scoring. STEVEN HERBERT

PIERCE STAGGERS RIVAL VALLEY, 35-14

<TEXT>
<P>
Valley College carted out the victory bell Saturday night and dangled it in 
front of rival Pierce. The Brahmas snatched it away. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce, playing its best game of the season, defeated Valley, 35-14, in a 
Western State Conference game at Valley to improve to 4-5 overall, 4-4 in 
conference play and 2-2 in the WSC Southern Division. 
</P>
<P>
The bell, which goes to the winner of the Valley-Pierce game, returns to the 
Brahmas, who lead the series, 15-9. Pierce last defeated Valley in 1985 but the 
series was suspended the following two years because Pierce dropped its 
football program because of budget cuts. Valley won the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Valley (3-6, 3-5, 1-3) trailed, 27-0, at halftime but staged a brief 
third-period comeback. Mark Mengoni threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Marcus 
Bridges and Craig Pringle went 18 yards with a blocked punt for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce quelled the rally, however, marching 80 yards in 17 plays and scoring on 
LaShante Parker's three-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, who had sat out two of the past three games because of a sprained 
ankle, led all rushers with 83 yards. 
</P>
<P>
There were 207 yards in penalties in the emotion-filled game, 125 of them 
against Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce did little wrong in the first half. Jamie Grossman threw touchdown 
passes of 10 and 21 yards to Arie McQuaig, D. J. Vlaming broke loose on a 
25-yard scoring run, and Rick Luna intercepted a Trendell Williams pass and 
went 54 yards to score. JIM COLEMAN

LLOYD DEFEATS TIM GULLIKSON, FACES BROTHER TOM IN FINAL

When Tim Gullikson broke John Lloyd's serve to take a 3-2 lead in the first set 
of the semifinals in the Prudential Bache Grand Championships, it looked to be 
a key game in the match. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Gullikson, it was. 
</P>
<P>
Gullikson held his serve to go up 4-2, but it was Lloyd who rallied around 
Gullikson's break to tie the set at 4-4. Lloyd eventually won the first set in 
a 10-8 tiebreaker and went on to a 7-6, 6-4 victory at the Newport Beach Tennis 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
The victory means Lloyd will face Tom Gullikson, Tim's brother, in the singles 
final at 1 p.m. today. Lloyd and doubles partner Hank Pfister, who defeated 
Peter Fleming and Marty Riessen, 4-6, 7-6, 6-3, will play for the doubles 
championship against Tim and Tom Gullikson, who defeated Ross Case and Jaime 
Fillol 6-2, 6-2, in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Lloyd's doubles victory that almost cost him his singles match. 
</P>
<P>
"My mind was wandering a little and I wasn't fully in the match until I was 
down 4-2," Lloyd said. "I started making excuses for myself saying, 'I just 
finished a two-hour match,' or 'My leg is sore and my elbow is sore,' but then 
I tried focusing and told myself to run down every ball. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the (service) break I was sort of hoping he'd make a mistake instead of 
trying to make things happen," Lloyd said. "I play better when I make things 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd started to make things happen by landing more of his first serves -- he 
struggled at 50% for the first set -- and using "my bread and butter," his 
backhand, more effectively. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd rallied to tie the set and won the tiebreaker after trailing 5-6. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd led, 5-3, in the second set. Gullikson held serve, but Lloyd won the 
final game with an overhand smash.

BRONCOS TRYING TO HEAL WOUNDS

<P>
There was a time when sick jokes about the Denver Broncos were confined to 
their failures in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Four times the Broncos have played for the NFL championship, including the past 
two years and three of the past four. Four times they have lost, and the scores 
have gotten progressively top-heavy: 27-10, 39-20, 42-10 and 55-10. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the situation reached the point where some critics suggested that 
the Broncos reject the Super Bowl bid and save themselves and their city 
further embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
At least nobody could argue with their status as AFC champions. 
</P>
<P>
Now they aren't even winners, and the moaning and groaning in the Mile High 
City is louder than it was after any of their Super Bowl fiascos. Despite 
having led at halftime of every game, they will bring a last-place AFC West 
division record of 3-5 to San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium today for a game 
against the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
Columnist Woody Paige of the Denver Post was especially rough on the Broncos 
after they blew a 16-0 lead last Sunday night and suffered a 27-22 loss to the 
Minnesota Vikings, who had been bumbling along with a 1-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
Wrote Paige: "Maybe they should switch to another league -- the League of Women 
Voters." 
</P>
<P>
The Bronco fans have been booing loudly and often, and became particularly 
unruly a month ago when their heroes lost to the woebegone Cleveland Browns and 
temporarily saved Coach Bud Carson's job. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dan Reeves' men have frittered away second-half leads of six, 12, 14, 12, 
nine, 10 and 16 points. They have righted themselves in time to win only two of 
those seven, one in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
What happened to the team that has dominated the AFC in recent years? Is it 
fallout from the repeated flops in the Super Bowl? Is it the wave of injuries 
that has hit the defensive unit? Is it psychological? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe all of the above. To be sure, letting leads slip away week after week can 
take its toll on a team's confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Both Reeves and quarterback John Elway addressed that theory this week. 
</P>
<P>
Said Reeves: "Any time something negative happens, you have to react against 
it. Until we learn to handle situations like that, those negative things will 
always be there. To cure it is the only way to overcome it. Otherwise, it keeps 
building up and it gets worse and worse." 
</P>
<P>
Said Elway: "I would say our problem is partly psychological. It has happened 
so many times that instead of thinking good things, we're worrying about what's 
bad that's going to happen, and it usually has." 
</P>
<P>
A remark by cornerback Dennis Smith after the Broncos loss to the Vikings told 
something about their current confidence level. Asked what he was thinking when 
the Broncos jumped to a 16-0 lead, Smith said, "I didn't get too excited. Let's 
put it that way." 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Karl Mecklenburg, normally as upbeat as anybody on the Broncos' 
team, said after the game, "We've got a chance, but you can't expect to lose to 
a 1-6 team and make the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Three days later, Mecklenburg was optimistic again. 
</P>
<P>
"There's hope for us," he said. "We've got to turn ourselves around and do the 
right mental things, and we've got to get some breaks." 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, the Broncos are still in the playoff race. With only 10 of 28 NFL 
teams over .500, they could make the playoffs with a strong finish if certain 
rivals were to hit the skids. 
</P>
<P>
Mecklenburg dismissed the Broncos' string of Super Bowl bashings as a cause of 
their plight. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year was supposed to be a rebuilding year and we went to the Super Bowl," 
he said. "We were a young team, and when you're like that, you don't have the 
depth you need. It's not a situation like San Francisco or the Giants. They 
have older backup guys, which could hurt them in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"With the injuries in our secondary, we had a couple of games when we couldn't 
even get our nickel package on the field. We had to go with our regular defense 
all the way. When that happens, you sometimes wind up with a linebacker 
covering a wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that what's been happening has hurt our confidence. With 
different guys playing, the coaches can't make the moves they normally do. If a 
guy gets burned, they don't want to put him in that situation again. The whole 
thing tends to snowball." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the snowball is reflected in the team's takeaway-turnover 
ratio of minus-three, compared to the plus-11 that tied the Pittsburgh Steelers 
for first place in the AFC last season. 
</P>
<P>
"All those years, we didn't turn the ball over," Mecklenburg said. "This year 
we've given up four touchdowns on offense plus two on special teams. Turnovers 
are killing us." 
</P>
<P>
Charger linebacker Billy Ray Smith subscribes to the supposition that the 
Broncos are suffering from a loss of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"They are a team laden with talent," Smith said. "Maybe they have even more 
talent than they've had in the past. But the psychological part of the game is 
definitely as big as the physical part, and it shows when you keep losing leads 
like they have. 
</P>
<P>
"It's worse for some people than for others, but just a few guys getting down 
can hurt the whole club's attitude." 
</P>
<P>
There is no question that injuries have hurt the Broncos' defense. End Alphonso 
Carreker has been out all season, cornerback Tyrone Braxton was lost for the 
season in the third game and several others have missed games. 
</P>
<P>
Reeves was so desperate for a cornerback after Braxton was injured that he 
tried out Elliott Smith, who was on the Chargers' developmental squad last year 
until he was activated for the last two games. Smith quickly proved inadequate, 
so Reeves gave the starting job to rookie Alton Montgomery, the Broncos' 
second-round draft choice, who had been a backup safety. 
</P>
<P>
"In several games, we've lost two players at the same position," Reeves said. 
"That affects your team all down the line." 
</P>
<P>
Elway blames the Broncos' lack of depth on their decision to cut back on Plan B 
signings this year. 
</P>
<P>
"A good football team should have depth," he said. "We didn't do a very good 
job of insuring ourselves against injuries in the off-season." 
</P>
<P>
Elliott Smith is the only 1990 Plan B signee on the roster, and he is used 
sparingly. 
</P>
<P>
But depth or no depth, the Broncos probably would have held on against the 
Vikings if Elway hadn't been forced out by turf toe and a strained arch late in 
the first half. Elway's backup, Gary Kubiak, threw three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Elway is expected to be back today, and his Charger counterpart, Billy Joe 
Tolliver, is wary. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't count them out," Tolliver said. "Any team that's been to two 
straight Super Bowls has a lot of pride. They're like a wounded dog. When he's 
cornered, he comes out fighting."

GORDON WINS GTO DIVISION

Robby Gordon knows all about a long day's journey into night -- and day. He 
also knows all about Victory Lane. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old driver from Orange had a day to dream about after completing 
about 500 miles of the Baja 1,000 at 5:30 a.m. Saturday, then winning the 
Chevron International Motor Sports Assn. GTO/GTU Challenge in the afternoon at 
the Del Mar Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon's Whistler Radar Mercury Cougar RX7 passed Pete Halsmer's Mazda RX-7 at 
the beginning of the final lap, then Gordon twice held off Halsmer on the 
10-turn, 1.62-mile course to win his second consecutive GTO race and fifth of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (Halsmer) had a better car at the end, but our car was wider," Gordon 
said, jokingly after edging Halsmer by .338 seconds. Gordon, who won $10,000, 
covered the 73.6 miles of racing in 1 hour 49.6 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon's weekend began Friday at 6 a.m. in Ensenada, Mexico. He raced a Ford 
off-road truck to fourth place through the Mexican desert, overcoming five 
wrecks and six flat tires, to clinch the 1990 HDRA/SCORE Class 8 title. At 5:30 
a.m. Saturday, he left Ensenada and reached the U.S.-Mexican border at 7:30 
a.m., where he waited in line until 8:30 a.m. to pass. He finally arrived at 
Del Mar at 9:30 a.m. and was able to drive his Cougar for the final 15 minutes 
of warm-ups. Max Jones had qualified the car third on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Dale was third in a Nissan 300ZX for the sixth consecutive race. 
</P>
<P>
Don Knowles, in an Infinity Dodge Daytona, was sixth overall but winner of the 
GTU race. John Finger, in a Mazda MX-6, was second. Mark Porcaro won the 
All-American Challenge in a Chevrolet Beretta, which finished 11th in the 
32-car field.

NATURAL SOLUTION; 
</P>
<P>
PROCEDURE THAT IS RARELY USED ON ARTIFICIAL HEART VALVES SAVES LIFE OF LONG 
BEACH PATIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doctors at St. Mary Medical Center in Long Beach say they've saved a woman's 
life through a rare medical procedure that involves inserting an elongated 
balloon into an artificial heart valve and inflating it to widen the valve and 
relieve an obstruction. 
</P>
<P>
While the procedure, called balloon valvuloplasti, has frequently been used to 
clear natural heart valves, the doctors say it has been employed in only a 
handful of cases involving patients with artificial valves. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a great deal of difficulty at first," said Dr. Richard D. Spellberg, 
associate director of the hospital's cardiology department, who performed the 
unusual procedure last week on Angela Hernandez. "A natural valve will conform 
somewhat to the shape of the balloon and not tear loose, but who knows what 
will happen to an artificial valve when you blow up a balloon in it?" 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, what happened was the relief of congestive heart failure that 
Spellberg believes would have otherwise killed the patient. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm grateful for what he's done," said Hernandez, recovering in her hospital 
room two days after the procedure was performed. "I hope and pray that he can 
do it for others." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez was a perfect candidate for the procedure, Spellberg said, because 
she had no alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, 64, who was born in Mexico, suffered a bout with rheumatic fever as 
a child. That damaged her heart valves, resulting in a lifetime of progressive 
heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
By 1982, Spellberg said, Hernandez's condition was so bad that doctors 
performed open-heart surgery to replace the two damaged valves with artificial 
valves made out of the lining of a calf's heart. 
</P>
<P>
For a time, her condition remained stable. 
</P>
<P>
Then about a year ago, Spellberg said, one of the artificial valves began 
narrowing due to calcification and general deterioration. As a result of the 
increased congestion, he said, the blood in Hernandez's heart began backing 
into her lungs, causing shortness of breath and swelling throughout her body. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, barely able to breathe, she was admitted to the hospital. Ordinarily 
in such cases, Spellberg said, doctors perform open-heart surgery to replace 
the defective valve with yet a new one. But Hernandez's generally poor health 
and the deteriorated condition of the existing valves made that impossible, he 
said. So after searching the literature for information on the handful of 
similar cases since 1987, Spellberg said, he decided to try the experimental 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
"We had virtually nothing to lose," he said. "Without it she would have died." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors inserted a long catheter about the diameter of a pencil into an artery 
in Hernandez's leg and pushed it up through the chambers of her heart and into 
the defective valve. They then inserted the small balloon, positioned it in the 
valve and inflated it with a saline solution. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Spellberg said, the valve was widened and the unobstructed flow of 
blood increased. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the risk involved, he said, the procedure is appropriate only for 
patients with deteriorated artificial valves who, like Hernandez, are too weak 
for surgery. While recent technological innovations have yielded artificial 
valves likely to last a lifetime, Spellberg said, as many as 40,000 Americans 
are living with valves produced in the early 1980s that are already in a state 
of deterioration. 
</P>
<P>
"The treatment of choice is surgery," Spellberg said, "but where surgery is not 
an option, this new option should be considered." 
</P>
<P>
In Hernandez's case, he said, the valve in question has about a 50-50 chance of 
going bad again within a year. If that happens, he said, doctors may have to 
repeat the risky procedure. 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, though, the Long Beach grandmother and her family are 
enjoying what can literally be described as her new room to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a miracle," said Paula E. Ayala, Hernandez's daughter. "I thank God 
that he gave the doctor the means to help her. Any length of time, to me, is a 
gift."

COUNTY HELPS PICO RIVERA ON BONDHOLDER PAYMENTS; 
</P>
<P>
REVENUES: PROPERTY TAXES THAT WOULD HAVE GONE TO COUNTY WILL BE USED. THE 
CITY'S REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY WOULD HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO PAY AN ESTIMATED $81,000 
DUE THIS YEAR.

PICO RIVERA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County will step in to help this city make its payments to 
municipal bondholders on time, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Redevelopment Agency would have been unable to pay an estimated 
$81,000 due this year and $730,000 next year to the holders of $63.2 million in 
bonds, City Manager Dennis Courtemarche said. 
</P>
<P>
In an arrangement approved late last month by the Board of Supervisors, the 
county agreed to allow Pico Rivera to make the bond payments by using property 
tax revenues that normally would have gone to the county. The county's decision 
will allow the city to avoid possible default on the bonds and such 
alternatives as tapping the city's general fund and cutting city services. 
</P>
<P>
If necessary, the county would defer up to $19.7 million in property tax money 
in the next 30 years, said Diane Shamhart, an assistant division chief with the 
county's administrative office. 
</P>
<P>
The basic problem is that Pico Rivera's redevelopment zones are not earning as 
much money for the city as had been predicted. 
</P>
<P>
It was just 19 months ago that the county authorized Pico Rivera to sell the 
bonds. The bond repayment plan unraveled, in part because "there were some 
calculations based on certain assumptions that didn't come true," Courtemarche 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody either overestimated or underestimated," the city manager said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles bond underwriters Chilton and O'Connor Inc. served as bond advisers 
to the city. The consultant who worked with Pico Rivera could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Two unforeseen circumstances made the problem more acute, Courtemarche said: 
</P>
<P>
* Revenues from Northrop Corp.'s plant, which is in a redevelopment zone, 
turned out to be much less than anticipated. The defense industry giant is the 
city's largest employer and greatest generator of both sales and property tax 
money. The tax value of the plant's equipment decreased by $38 million, 
Courtemarche said. As a result, the city lost about $400,000 in tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
* The agency is also getting less property tax money than it's entitled to on 
several redeveloped parcels because county tax rolls have not been updated to 
reflect increased property values. An undervaluation of one shopping center 
alone is costing the city about $260,000 a year in taxes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Other cities are experiencing the same problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But there is an inevitable lag time between the completion of a project and its 
addition to the tax roll, said Roy Sharman, the county's assistant assessor. 
</P>
<P>
"Often these redevelopment agencies in cities think an assessor can put 
something on the roll for the same year it's completed," he said, adding that 
he would try to resolve the issue if officials from Pico Rivera contacted him. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the pinch, Courtemarche said, the city expects to meet its new 
financial obligation to the county without difficulty. That debt would be 
repaid through expected revenue increases the city has not yet budgeted. Some 
revenue increase is assured, because a 1988 state law will provide the city a 
greater share of county property taxes than before. 
</P>
<P>
Another city in the region has also faced a bond payment squeeze. Huntington 
Park had to avoid defaulting on redevelopment bonds when its projects generated 
less tax revenue than expected. Ultimately, that city's Redevelopment Agency 
borrowed $15 million from the city's general fund to help make bond payments. 
</P>
<P>
The drain on the city's general fund contributed to a city financial crisis 
that led to 25 employee layoffs a year ago. The county has also loaned future 
property tax money to Huntington Park's Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The mission of a city's redevelopment agency is to pay for or help pay for 
improvements in so-called blighted areas. An agency can operate in blighted 
areas that the city clearly defines as redevelopment zones. Projects in such a 
zone can run the gamut from street repairs to new homes, shopping areas and 
business parks. The agency pays for such improvements by selling bonds. 
</P>
<P>
If the redevelopment succeeds, local property values will rise. The 
redevelopment agency pays its debts with these increased property tax revenues. 
In addition, if redevelopment prompts business growth, the city will earn more 
sales tax.

FIRED SCHOOL GUARD SHOULD BE REINSTATED, JUDGE RULES

BELLFLOWER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has ruled that the Bellflower Unified School 
District should reinstate a Bellflower High School security guard who was fired 
earlier this year after he failed to appear at a basketball game that he was to 
supervise. 
</P>
<P>
Security Guard Keith Castruita had filed suit against the district alleging 
that he was fired in retaliation for complaining that the school vice 
principal, Tom Davies, was racist. 
</P>
<P>
The charge was denied by district officials, who said that Castruita was fired 
because he was an undependable employee. 
</P>
<P>
Judge John Zebrowski ruled that no evidence of racial discrimination existed, 
but said that Castruita had been wrongfully terminated and that the complaints 
about his absence on the job did not merit his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Bathen, the attorney representing the district, said he believed the 
judge's ruling was inconsistent. 
</P>
<P>
"The judge denied their principal argument, he said there was no evidence of 
discrimination, yet he ruled that Castruita should not have been dismissed," 
Bathen said. "That (reinstatement) is not really what they were arguing about." 
</P>
<P>
Castruita said he was "very gratified by the decision," but was disappointed 
that the judge had found insufficient evidence of racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
The judge has yet to sign an order mandating reinstatement, Bathen said. Once 
he does, the district can choose whether to obey the order or appeal. The 
Bellflower Unified School District board will meet Nov. 15 to discuss the 
issue.

O.C. HITS 99 ON HEAT PARADE -- TOPS IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Thermometers in El Toro topped all others in the United States on Saturday as a 
record-breaking heat wave gripped Orange County, driving thousands of people to 
the beaches and local parks and prompting nervous fire officials to watch the 
tinder-dry hills. 
</P>
<P>
The almost bone-dry heat was expected to cook the Southland throughout the 
holiday weekend, ensuring that today's Veterans Day observances would be awash 
in summer-like weather, said Steve Burback, a meteorologist with WeatherData, 
which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Burback said that temperatures in the unincorporated South County community of 
El Toro reached 99 degrees, making it the hottest spot in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have anything warmer, not even in the deserts," Burback said. 
</P>
<P>
The hot spell, exacerbated by almost no wind, was expected to begin easing up 
Tuesday, with a marked drop in the mercury by Wednesday, when temperatures are 
expected to fall back to the 70s. 
</P>
<P>
That was good news for organizers of today's wreath-laying ceremony at the El 
Toro Memorial Park on Trabuco Road, who watched their Memorial Day 
wreath-laying plans wash out due to rainy weather. 
</P>
<P>
"That's super. I love it," said Georgia Bent, a spokeswoman for the hourlong 
Veterans Day ceremony, which will include readings of a selection of letters 
from service personnel stationed in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
But the heat wave caused fire officials to worry that any resumption of Santa 
Ana winds may spell trouble in the parched canyons around the county. If winds 
begin blowing to about 25 m.p.h., Young said, the department's stations will be 
put on red-flag warning and strike teams will be staged in at least two areas. 
</P>
<P>
"This weekend, we will monitor (the hills) real closely," Orange County Fire 
Department Capt. Dan Young said. "The message to get out there is that fire 
season is not over." 
</P>
<P>
Outside of El Toro, other cities, including Huntington Beach, which is normally 
cooled by ocean breezes, produced temperatures that rose above 90 degrees, 
meteorologist Burback said. In fact, he added, most cities were reporting 
temperatures more than 20 degrees above the average for this time of November. 
</P>
<P>
At 12:30 p.m., a bank sign located a few blocks from the Huntington Beach 
Municipal Pier flashed a temperature reading of 96 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures throughout the area topped the county's record of 94 degrees, set 
in 1956 in Santa Ana. (Historical temperature records are kept only for Santa 
Ana.) Santa Ana's high temperature for Saturday was 93 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Civic Center reported 93 degrees, tying the record set for the 
date in 1956. Los Angeles International Airport also recorded a high of 93 
degrees. High temperatures in other cities included: Long Beach, 96; 
Montebello, 92; Torrance, 92, and Woodland Hills, 91. The relative humidity 
ranged from 13% to 42%. 
</P>
<P>
Burback said the heat wave was due to a high-pressure zone that has been 
trapped above the entire West Coast for the past few days by two low-pressure 
troughs, one in the Pacific Ocean and one over the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the unusual weather transformed the fall season into just another 
summer day, turning people's attentions to thoughts of outdoor recreation. 
</P>
<P>
By the tens of thousands, Orange County residents attempted to beat the heat by 
wading or surfing in the unusually warm waters of the county's beaches or just 
relaxing under the shade trees of the county's regional parks. 
</P>
<P>
Surfer Lloyd Ly, 25, paddled out into the water south of the Huntington Beach 
pier about 10 a.m. But by noon, he was finally forced back to shore to peel off 
his blue, orange and black wet suit. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't sit out there on your board for more than about five minutes without 
beginning to sweat," Ly said, adding that the only way to stay comfortable in 
his suit was to repeatedly slide off the board and into the 65-degree water. "I 
can't believe it's this hot. It's hotter than the summer was." 
</P>
<P>
Neither could Mike Murray, a transplant from Ohio, who stood ankle deep in the 
surf and expertly twirled a Frisbee. 
</P>
<P>
"Now this is nice," said Murray, clad only in baggy trunks, as he practiced for 
a Frisbee spinning competition. "I'll call home today to a couple of friends of 
mine to rub it in." 
</P>
<P>
Although some halfheartedly groused about the unseasonably warm weather that 
hit the coast 12 days before Thanksgiving, most cheerfully basked in the 
luxurious weather. 
</P>
<P>
"It is just unbelievably wonderful," said Moshe Ovadia, a 35-year-old Miami 
resident who was visiting his sister for the weekend. The two were savoring the 
dry heat as they strolled around a lake at Fountain Valley's Mile Square 
Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I came prepared for a different kind of weather," he said, pointing to his 
long pants as others around him jogged along the footpath in neon-colored 
shorts. "But I'm very pleasantly surprised." 
</P>
<P>
At Rancho La Cienega Recreation Center in southwest Los Angeles, children were 
lined up waiting to get into the pool at its 2 p.m. opening time. 
</P>
<P>
"Last week, they came bundled up in jackets and warm clothes," said Deven 
Bouchet, the weekend pool manager. "Today, they were in T-shirts and shorts, 
some of them carrying skateboards." 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguard Mitch White said that about 20,000 people made the trek to Newport 
Beach to cool off in the water. Thousands more, however, crowded the streets of 
the coastal city to stroll along Balboa Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are just walking around," White said. "It's a great day." 
</P>
<P>
Although the official high temperature for the city was 80 degrees, White said 
it reached 87 at the lifeguard station, located on Newport Pier. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt like a blisteringly hot day here," he said. "I almost fainted." 
</P>
<P>

WAITING GAME GETS TENSE FOR O.C. MARINES 
</P>

TUSTIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As thousands of local Marines carted out the birthday cakes and candles to 
celebrate their history here last week, a darker future clouded their 
celebrations: the real prospect of a war that could draw into it thousands of 
additional area soldiers in the weeks ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are just wondering -- will they be the ones called on to go 
the (Persian) Gulf?" said Cpl. Darrick Dees, a helicopter mechanic at the 
Tustin Marine Corps Air Station. "It's all just a waiting game. No one really 
knows." 
</P>
<P>
Local military personnel and their families have been playing the waiting game 
since the Iraqis invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. But the stakes were upped 
dramatically on Thursday with President Bush's announcement that he would send 
additional troops -- perhaps 200,000 -- into the Persian Gulf powder keg to 
prepare for an "offensive" option. 
</P>
<P>
Among that group could be a formidable local contingent: as many as 18,000 
Marines from Camp Pendleton, as well as El Toro and Tustin, who will form a 
special-assignment, amphibious assault unit known as the 5th Marine 
Expeditionary Brigade. 
</P>
<P>
After Bush's announcement, "morale was soaring" among those Marines who may end 
up in the Persian Gulf as part of the 5th Brigade, said its commander, Brig. 
Gen. Peter J. Rowe. 
</P>
<P>
"The forces here knew they would eventually be deployed," said 5th Brigade 
spokesman Capt. Chris Gillette, "so it's a relief to a certain extent to have 
it officially announced. We are finally going to be able to become directly 
involved in this operation." 
</P>
<P>
Gillette, whose chief duty in the Persian Gulf will be to provide information 
from the outside world, said of his own entry into the conflict: "It's 
something I've prepared myself for psychologically for a while now. It's why I 
joined the Marines -- not to sit on the sidelines." 
</P>
<P>
But for others in Orange County, hit close to home by the newly heightened 
prospect of war, the mood appears less gung-ho: 
</P>
<P>
* For Kittie Flynn, the coming weeks may be long ones. With four boys, ages 4 
to 14, at home at Camp Pendleton, she has tried in the past few days not to 
think about war. She just wants her husband, 42-year-old Lt. Col. George Flynn, 
a Marine battalion commander now shipboard in the Persian Gulf, to be home for 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the President and Congress feel is correct, I support," Flynn said. 
"We've realized all along that something like this may happen and that's why 
our husbands are there -- to defend our country. . . . We're just hoping 
they'll be back before the holidays. But nobody knows." 
</P>
<P>
* For Kathy Collier of Buena Park, news of the stepped-up deployment was a 
relief. A founder of an area support group for families of soldiers in the 
crisis, she sees the move as an added layer of security for her son, 
24-year-old Army Spc Darrin Collier, stationed in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"The more numbers we have over there," she said, "the safer everyone feels." 
</P>
<P>
But Collier acknowledged that there was still tension among members of her 
support group as they traded phone calls after Bush's announcement. The hope is 
that the United States' show of strength will force Saddam Hussein to back down 
-- before the shooting starts, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult for us to accept the fact that there might be a war in the 
next two months," she said. 
</P>
<P>
* For World War II veteran John Penn of El Toro, the occasion to remember dead 
soldiers past over the Veterans Day weekend is also a chance to pray for the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
An organizer of a veterans' service at El Toro Memorial Park Cemetery today at 
2 p.m., Penn said: "I'm sure those boys are going to be on all our minds this 
weekend. We don't want to be at the cemetery again in a year or two putting 
wreaths on dead GIs from the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
The hopes will no doubt be similar at the Newport Beach Marriott today, as 750 
family members of troops in the Persian Gulf are expected to gather there for 
brunch at 10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Collier and other leaders of military support groups say these chances to share 
their fears and hopes with others at a time of such uncertainty are invaluable. 
And in a matter of weeks, the number of local people able to share those 
experiences may swell by thousands. 
</P>
<P>
Although the military does not disclose specific troop levels in its 
operations, past estimates have put the number of Orange County soldiers sent 
to the Middle East since summer at 5,000 or more. The mobilization of the 5th 
Brigade, which military sources say is not expected to come for several weeks, 
seems almost certain to surpass that figure. 
</P>
<P>
While based at Camp Pendleton, the brigade may draw on fighter and attack 
aircraft personnel from El Toro, as well as helicopter troops from Tustin, 
according to Capt. Gillette. Originally created in Virginia during World War I 
and restructured in the years after, the 5th Brigade moved its headquarters to 
Camp Pendleton in July, 1985. It normally uses 20 Navy ships to embark on what 
the Marines call "forceable entry operations ashore." 
</P>
<P>
Among the more notable assignments in the brigade's history: deployment in the 
Cuban Missile Crisis in November, 1962. Twenty-eight years later, 5th Brigade 
family members now watch its latest deployment anxiously, hoping this one ends 
as peacefully.

WEDDING: RICHARD MALLERY AND DEBBIE KILCOYNE, OFF THE STREETS FOR LESS THAN TWO 
WEEKS, EXCHANGE VOWS, THANKS TO A CHURCH THAT HELPS THE HOMELESS.

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For better or worse had special meaning Saturday as Richard Mallery and Debbie 
Kilcoyne exchanged wedding vows. 
</P>
<P>
Homeless but in love, the couple got married in a Huntington Beach chapel and 
held their reception in the shelter where they've been sleeping on cots since 
they came off the streets Oct. 30. 
</P>
<P>
She wore a borrowed white gown and shoes. He wore a black tuxedo rented at 
Sears with church donations. But the I-Do's were no less magical. 
</P>
<P>
"This," said Debbie Mallery, "is the wedding I always dreamed of." 
</P>
<P>
The traditional ceremony was made possible by the First United Methodist 
Church, which waived the pastor's fee and rounded up a donated cake and flowers 
from local businesses and the 300-member flock. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had longed to get married but could never afford it. On Tuesday, 
church elders offered to help. That afternoon, Richard proposed. 
</P>
<P>
"The people here have been so great. They've arranged for everything. They got 
me a tuxedo, everything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The church is one of 48 in Orange County that participates in the Interfaith 
Shelter Network, a program begun last year in which the homeless are housed and 
fed for 90 days while they find jobs and save 80% of their earnings for rent 
deposits. The Mallerys are among 12 people staying at First United Methodist. 
</P>
<P>
"They're like kids, very romantic. They'd wanted to get married but couldn't 
afford it," said John Woerner, the church's program coordinator. "They remind 
us that many of us are really only two or three paychecks away from being 
homeless." 
</P>
<P>
For 2 1/2 years, the couple lived in an Anaheim motel room, shared until 
recently with Debbie's three children from a previous marriage. They are 
fighting to regain custody of the children, who are living in three foster 
homes and could not attend their wedding. 
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, Debbie lost her job as a restaurant hostess. And six weeks 
ago, Richard lost his job as a forklift mechanic when the company went under. 
</P>
<P>
"In a motel, if you don't pay the rent the day it's due, you're out," Richard 
said Saturday. With five mouths to feed, "we didn't have any savings." Debbie's 
mother could not help them, and Richard's father is elderly; he tried by giving 
his son his worn-out 1970 station wagon. 
</P>
<P>
For 5 1/2 weeks they lived out of the beat-up Chevy, which they parked on an 
Anaheim street behind a car dealership. They marveled that police did not roust 
them because the car was crammed full, its windows curtained. They did not eat 
for the first several days until they heard about food handouts. 
</P>
<P>
Other homeless people told them about a church in Fullerton where they might 
find help getting jobs and shelter. They said that church referred them to 
United Methodist. The couple spent five more days on the streets before the 
church's role in the Interfaith Shelter's three-month seasonal program for the 
homeless began Oct. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Applicants with substance abuse and mental problems are not allowed. Those 
accepted are fed, clothed and given a place to stay, usually dormitory-style, 
at the participating churches while they search for work. They risk expulsion 
if they don't find jobs within 30 days of admission, a cornerstone of the 
program. Individual job counselors work closely with the homeless participants 
in helping them find employment. 
</P>
<P>
Richard got a job as an auto mechanic less than a week after they were taken in 
by the shelter. Debbie is being trained by a church member to be a waitress, 
work that provides "more advancement" opportunity than her last job as a 
hostess. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday morning, before the wedding, the couple walked hand-in-hand to a bank 
to open a joint account into which they will deposit the 80% of their earnings 
that is required of all shelter inhabitants as savings toward rental deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Having worked less than a week, Richard had no money for a wedding ring. But 
that didn't matter. He slipped onto Debbie's finger a ring he'd given her a few 
years ago when he was flush, sobbing through half the ceremony and stealing an 
early kiss. His 14-year-old daughter, Stacey, serving as bridesmaid, sniffled 
through the service. 
</P>
<P>
They'd both been married before in Las Vegas -- she because she was pregnant, 
he because a buddy dared him to. 
</P>
<P>
"This is more like the real thing," Debbie beamed at the reception, replete 
with flowers and wedding cake, photographs and a videotaping. "All the 
decorations, it's like a dream." 
</P>
<P>
Lest they spend their wedding night in a church hall, however, a member of the 
congregation Saturday morning anonymously donated enough money to pay for a 
night at the Hilton Waterfront in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Today, it's back to the shelter.

DANA PARSONS: ALEX ODEH'S BROTHER BRACES FOR HOME FRONT BACKLASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sami Odeh was sitting Friday in the same small room in his Orange real estate 
office, where he sat five years ago when the call came saying a bomb had blown 
up in his brother's face. 
</P>
<P>
Sami was too stunned to fall apart that morning. Nor did he flail around the 
office in a tirade. He simply told his client that he had to leave immediately 
and rushed over to the hospital in Santa Ana. Ninety minutes later, doctors 
told him that his brother, Alex, "didn't make it." 
</P>
<P>
Lots of things change in five years. Then again, sometimes it seems to Sami 
Odeh as if nothing changes. 
</P>
<P>
The issue on that October morning of 1985 was international terrorism. Alex 
Odeh was western director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee. 
The bomb was rigged to the door of the committee's Santa Ana office, set to go 
off in the face of whoever got to work first. 
</P>
<P>
So Sami Odeh, now 40, is no stranger to the potential for peril for 
Arab-Americans. While he said he has seldom seen overt anti-Arab bias in Orange 
County, he now fears that the apparent imminence of war in the Persian Gulf 
might set efforts back again. 
</P>
<P>
"I would imagine that if war breaks out, we undoubtedly will suffer heavy 
casualties," Odeh said. "I have read anywhere from 50,000 to 20,000 to 30,000. 
But to me the death of one person is one too many. Emotion will be very high. 
Although you hope not, you know in your heart there will be some backlash 
against all Arab-Americans, regardless of whether they're Iraqis, Palestinians, 
Kuwaitis or whatever, because people are going to argue that because of them, 
we have lost all these people, whoever 'them' might be." 
</P>
<P>
The frustration comes at Odeh from many directions, not the least of which is 
that no one was ever arrested for his brother's death. But he's also frustrated 
by the current Middle East situation, believing that President Bush has been 
less than forthright with the U.S. public. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, it is frustrating," he said, "because you're trying to educate your 
fellow Americans about what is really happening in the Middle East and what is 
the real American interest in the Middle East, and then most of the time that 
is contrary to what most people are believing is our interest in the Middle 
East. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tempted many times just to throw up my hands and say that things are not 
going to change, and I might as well go on and do something else. But I feel it 
is my duty to my country -- the United States -- that I continue on the path of 
education, the path of knowledge. The average American, once they know the 
facts, they really are the most fair-minded people in the world." 
</P>
<P>
It's the U.S. refusal to work aggressively to solve the Palestinian problem 
that hurts its image in the Arab world, said Odeh, a Palestinian by birth who 
came to the United States 16 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you get some optimism," he said. "You see some opening, some 
movement in the right direction, and then it seems like you get cold water 
spilled all over your face the next afternoon or morning by the President or 
one of the White House people saying, 'No way, Jose.' " 
</P>
<P>
I suggested that the Middle East problem must be difficult because of his 
divided loyalties. He cut me short: "No, I don't have loyalties both places. My 
loyalties belong to the United States of America. Period. End of memo." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he is unhappy that President Bush has framed the Iraq situation as a 
crusade against Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
"That is stupid," he said. "Saddam is not Iraq. We're talking about a country 
with its people. To me it is stupid in politics to make it a one-on-one 
contest, 'I'm going to show the SOB,' and conduct your foreign policy based on 
like or dislike of an individual. Iraqis have been around before Saddam came on 
the scene, and hopefully, if we don't eliminate them, Iraqis will be around way 
after Saddam has gone from the scene." 
</P>
<P>
Odeh's worst fear is that violence begets violence. "I hope the peace movement 
in this country will do something," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we wait until the body bags start coming back, we have waited too long. We 
must stop it before the first bag comes back. Because in the nature of 
hostilities, once they start, it is not up to you to stop it sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
He also hopes that if the United States goes to war, people here will remember 
that the enemy is Iraq and not everybody else who happens to be Arab.

A FALSE -- AND FATAL -- SENSE OF SECURITY; 
</P>
<P>
AIDS: TOO MANY WOMEN CONTINUE TO THINK THE DISEASE IS SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS TO 
OTHER PEOPLE. ONE SUPPORT GROUP IS LIVING PROOF IT ISN'T. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As casually as if she were describing the plot of a TV show, Linda explains to 
her women's support group that she missed the last few meetings because she was 
close to death from double pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
At 22, Linda (not her real name) is showing the ravages of AIDS. She is pale, 
and her big T-shirt and bright green skirt reveal how thin she has become. Her 
weight has dropped from 128 pounds to 96. 
</P>
<P>
She contracted the virus, called HIV, from her hemophiliac boyfriend, who was 
infected by a blood transfusion before testing blood products for the virus 
that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome began in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the women in her AIDS group contracted the disease years ago, through 
contaminated drug needles or through sex with a man who used intravenous drugs 
or was bisexual. It was not known then that such behavior was high risk. 
</P>
<P>
But some uninfected women today are making those same fatal errors because they 
believe AIDS is not a woman's disease, assuming it is an illness confined to 
male homosexuals and intravenous drug users. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Bonne and her education staff at the San Diego AIDS Foundation -- who 
talk to 3,000 people a month in businesses, churches and schools about the 
threat of AIDS -- say most women seem to distance themselves from the threat, 
believing it's not their problem. 
</P>
<P>
She doubts that most are taking precautions against the disease they treat so 
casually. Bonne finds that many women, especially minorities, feel unable to 
talk about condoms with their partners or to insist on safe sex practices. 
</P>
<P>
But women who today live with that sense of safety may die with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Linda and her friends are well beyond such denial in the intimacy of their 
group, which is sponsored by UC San Diego's Owen Clinic and the HIV 
Neuro-behavioral Research Center. Of 30 local services for AIDS patients, this 
is the only one exclusively for women. Here, they have found a haven where they 
can deal with the fears, anger and triumphs they experience in living with a 
death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
For some it is the only haven, for they have told few people the nature of 
their illness, to avoid discrimination. Most feel great stigma and shame from 
the disease because society associates it with drug use, prostitution and 
homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
So far, these women are an apparent anomaly. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego County Department of Health Services reports that only 100 women 
in the county have full-blown AIDS, about 4% of the 2,251 people with the 
disease in the county. But Dr. Michelle Ginsberg, county health epidemiologist, 
estimates that 30,000 men and women in San Diego are now HIV-positive, meaning 
they are infected with the AIDS virus. Although Ginsberg offered no statistics 
on the proportion of HIV-infected women, she said the number is rising. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, 7% of all AIDS cases diagnosed by 1988 involved women. By 
September, 1990, that figure had climbed to 10.5% of the 149,500 total cases 
diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
But a look eastward reveals some startling figures. In some Central African 
nations, 20% of the adult urban population has AIDS, and equal numbers of men 
and women are infected. In New York City and northern New Jersey, AIDS is the 
leading cause of death for women ages 25 to 35. 
</P>
<P>
White, middle-class women may be lulled into a sense of indifference and 
security by the fact that 70% of the females infected nationwide are black and 
Latina. Many of these women live in poor, urban areas of high drug use. 
Although middle-class white women may never become a major part of the AIDS 
epidemic, the disease is lethal, and anyone with a possibility of exposure 
should practice safe sex. 
</P>
<P>
For women of all races who already have AIDS, ignorance and prejudice may 
accompany the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Some health providers insist that many doctors fail to recognize persistent 
gynecological infections as the first signs of the virus in women. Physicians 
may believe that a female patient is not in a high-risk group and therefore 
fail to perform a test for the virus. 
</P>
<P>
To compound the problem, most women won't qualify for social welfare assistance 
once their disease is diagnosed and they become disabled. 
</P>
<P>
That is because some of the symptoms experienced only by women -- such as 
chronic pelvic inflammation, yeast infections and vaginal thrush -- are not 
listed by the federal Centers for Disease Control as typical of full-blown 
AIDS. The CDC criteria for AIDS are used by social service agencies to 
determine who receives disability benefits. 
</P>
<P>
CDC scientists based their early definition of the disease on symptoms seen 
only in gay men. Currently, 65% of the women who die of AIDS do not qualify for 
social service benefits under CDC guidelines. But, according to the CDC, there 
are no immediate plans to change the guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Financial assistance, welfare and medical benefits are critical in the advanced 
stages of the disease, when all AIDS victims suffer from opportunistic 
infections, such as pneumonia, meningitis and tuberculosis -- until one illness 
proves fatal. 
</P>
<P>
But hope is always there. The women in the AIDS support group frequently talk 
about new drugs and rumors of cures. The possibility of returning to normalcy 
and getting on with their lives is the unspoken obsession. 
</P>
<P>
These women's lives are testimony that AIDS is not just another venereal 
disease and certainly not a disease of just gay men and drug users. 
</P>
<P>
What is the solution? How do we prevent infection today that would spell death 
in the years to follow? 
</P>
<P>
The beginning is through education for all women -- about the delicate subjects 
of safe sex practices, drug use, homosexuality and bisexuality. That and a 
healthy dose of, "Yes, it can happen to me," can influence a woman to take 
control of her future.

BRODERICK CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Betty Broderick is an unfortunate woman who was finally driven to a desperate 
act by the callousness and cruelty of her husband, and by the barbarous divorce 
laws of the state of California, which promote divorce and make a mockery of 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Broderick destroyed his wife's life. 
</P>
<P>
He betrayed his marriage vows and cheated on his wife with his young legal 
assistant. He abandoned his wife, sold the family home and took the children. 
</P>
<P>
He gave her what support he felt like, withheld it when he wanted to punish her 
(there was no legal settlement made at the time of the divorce) and openly 
lived with his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he left Betty Broderick with nothing to show for the nearly 17 years 
she had put into her marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, the actions of men like Dan Broderick are supported by the law and 
social climate of these times. They suffer neither legal nor social sanctions 
no matter how heinous their treatment of their wives and families.

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council's revocation of the opening of Pomerado Road ("S.D. 
Council Revokes Plan to Reopen Pomerado Road," Nov. 6) is petty and arrogant. 
</P>
<P>
Too bad about extra traffic coming through Scripps Ranch. Every community in 
greater San Diego has the same problem, but they don't fence off public 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
The city of San Diego and the council should be ashamed of being so 
small-minded. I sentence all of them to two hours of nonstop driving on I-15 at 
rush hour for at least six months.

GOOD SPORTS SEND BASEBALL CARDS TO GULF; 
</P>
<P>
MORALE: LAWNDALE SHOP OWNER MOBILIZES COLLECTORS TO DONATE THOUSANDS OF CARDS 
TO BORED AMERICAN TROOPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As President Bush gears up to send more armored divisions to the Persian Gulf, 
Dugout Baseball Cards owner Perry Dodd is planning to send a few big guns of 
his own -- former slugger Reggie Jackson, all-star pitcher Dennis (Oil Can) 
Boyd and superstar shortstop Ozzie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The players, of course, won't be boarding jets for the Middle East. But 
thousands of baseball cards bearing their pictures and those of other sports 
heroes will. 
</P>
<P>
Moved by newspaper accounts of the boredom of the men and women in uniform in 
Saudi Arabia, Dodd figured he was staring at thousands of examples of the 
perfect antidote. So last month, the 29-year-old baseball enthusiast started 
setting aside cards and soliciting donations from the regulars who frequent his 
shop in a mini-mall on Prairie Avenue in Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
"Just hearing about how bored they are over there, I thought it would be an 
interesting thing (the troops) could do," Dodd said. "Baseball is the 
all-American pastime. I thought they would enjoy trading them, or just using 
them to break the ice." 
</P>
<P>
Draped with American flags and sports banners, Dodd's shop is also stocked with 
bubble gum and beef jerky shaped to resemble chewing tobacco. Visitors speak in 
low voices so as not to disturb customers who are absorbed in the sports trivia 
on the backs of cards. 
</P>
<P>
A handwritten sign over a table stacked with baseball cards at the back of the 
store declares: "Bring a 'peace' of America to the Middle East. We are sending 
sports cards. Goal -- 10,000. Any donations are appreciated." 
</P>
<P>
When Dodd penned the sign, he expected that it would take a while to meet his 
goal. But customers greeted the idea with so much enthusiasm that he now 
expects to be able to send twice that many -- more than $2,000 worth -- by the 
end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish we could send more," Dodd said. "There's so many guys over there, and 
I'm not going to be able to get cards to one-tenth" of them. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd isn't the only one in the sports card business hoping to send a piece of 
America to the troops in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
A card shop in Illinois recently donated 800 cases of baseball cards to the 
Middle East, and Upper Deck, a major manufacturer of cards, expects to be 
sending baseball and other sports cards for the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
But Navy Lt. Phillip Ishikawa of the Defense Logistics Agency said hobby items 
such as sports cards are one thing Operation Desert Shield's soldiers just 
can't get enough of. Such gifts do not go unnoticed, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"The Defense Department appreciates all the help people are sending," Ishikawa 
said Friday. "It's very important psychologically (for the troops) because it 
lets them know the American people are behind them. The psychological edge of 
knowing that people haven't forgotten about you is important to your morale." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in the three months since the agency began manning a phone bank to take 
calls from people who want to make donations, more than 3,000 companies and 
individuals have given the troops a vast array of goods, including books, 
videocassettes, lip balm, hair products, boomerangs, dumbbells, puzzles, 
stationery, sardines and bottles of steak sauce. 
</P>
<P>
One man donated 2,000 footballs, a woman gave away five tons of groceries and a 
company recently offered to send 300,000 headset radios to the troops. 
</P>
<P>
"Books are no longer on the list because some publishing companies have been 
sending a lot of them," Ishikawa said. "One of the things we are emphasizing is 
that people want hobby items, games and card games." 
</P>
<P>
With at least 5 million avid sports card collectors in the United States, Dodd 
is convinced the cards offer just the kind of fun and morale boost the troops 
will need to keep their minds occupied during the holidays. Collectors could 
spend hours memorizing statistics, or looking for cards bearing players from 
their hometowns or schools, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some of the card packs could contain a few surprises, Dodd said. 
In some instances, a $1 pack of 10 cards may contain a collector's card worth 
25 times as much as the entire pack, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of (the cards he plans to give away) are new cards of people that 
aren't yet really successful, rookies that are really nobodies now but in a 
couple years could be real special," Dodd said. "But the ones who get the 
cards, if they hold onto them a couple years, they could be very valuable." 
</P>
<P>
Card shop devotee Edwin Rodriguez, 14, one of Dodd's biggest contributors, said 
he decided to part with 800 sports cards in the interest of serving his 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like I'm really going to miss those cards, but it's not like they're 
really cheap or anything," Rodriquez said of his donation, which he said is 
worth more than $80. "It's a little sacrifice. I feel if I can help my country 
in any little way, well, I'll do it."

CARSON PONDERS SLASHING BUDGET OF MUCH-PRAISED PARK PROGRAMS; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCES: THE CITY'S RECREATION SYSTEM IS KNOWN AS ONE OF THE BEST IN THE SOUTH 
BAY. BUT STAFF SALARIES AND PARK MAINTENANCE COSTS ARE NOW A PRIME TARGET FOR 
THE BUDGET AX. 
</P>

<P>
When Veterans Park opened in June, its supporters hailed it as the crowning 
achievement in the city of Carson's 20-year master plan for its park system. 
</P>
<P>
With its carpeted locker rooms and air-conditioned racquetball courts, the 
park's massive sports complex has been favorably compared to private sports 
facilities. Dubbed "Club Med" by one Carson resident, the 12-acre park also 
includes two lighted tennis courts, two baseball diamonds and outdoor 
basketball courts. 
</P>
<P>
Critics, however, were quick to point out that the project was almost $2 
million over budget, and that operating and maintenance costs for the 
state-of-the-art park would be $1 million for the first year alone. 
</P>
<P>
They say Veterans Park is a prime example of what's wrong with the city's parks 
department. They contend the park is simply too lavish and, like the 
department, is too expensive to operate. 
</P>
<P>
Carson's park system is widely regarded as one of the finest in the South Bay, 
but it has become a key issue during the last few months as council members 
have wrestled to craft a balanced budget for 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with stagnant sales tax revenues and rising expenses, city officials say 
budget cuts are inevitable. The Parks and Recreation Department, which 
accounted for 24% of the 1989 budget, has been targeted for the deepest cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that our parks system is a model," Mayor Vera Robles 
DeWitt said recently, "but how we'll maintain it is a big dilemma." 
</P>
<P>
Since it was first formed in 1969, the parks department has been the largest or 
second-largest item in the city's budget, according to present and former 
officials. Beginning with just two parks, the system has grown over the years 
to include 12 parks, a boxing center and an aquatics center. 
</P>
<P>
A wide range of classes and programs have attracted a loyal and vocal 
constituency among Carson residents, who often jam the City Council chamber to 
lobby against proposed cuts in the parks department budget. 
</P>
<P>
That public support, combined with the backing of various city councils through 
the years, for a time made former Parks Director Howard Homan among the most 
powerful political figures in Carson, knowledgeable city insiders say. 
</P>
<P>
When he was hired in 1969, Homan recalls, there was "much public outcry about 
the lack of (park) facilities." With strong support from city officials, he 
drafted the master plan for the park system. 
</P>
<P>
But Homan, who recently retired under pressure from the council, had been 
increasingly criticized in recent years as some city officials began pressing 
to reorder the city's spending priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Homan, the city's first and only parks director until he retired Nov. 1, 
contends that the department's budget has been artificially high because it 
includes many costs that other cities charge to their public works departments. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the $9.2-million parks budget in fiscal 1989-90, for example, were 
costs related to maintenance of all city buildings, landscaping, utilities and 
graffiti removal. The department actually spent only $7.3 million of its 
allocation after the council imposed a hiring freeze and cuts in capital 
purchases in all departments. But that figure was still about 24% of the total 
city expenditures of $29.9 million in 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
"If you took all the utilities out of our budget and put it in public works," 
Homan said, "it would save us (the department) $1 million, but the total cost 
(to the city) is still there. Same with maintenance." 
</P>
<P>
However, City Administrator Jack Smith, who favors cutting the parks department 
budget, notes that all but two city buildings -- City Hall and the Community 
Center -- are park facilities. Landscaping and utility costs are also mostly 
related to park sites, said Smith, who also is acting as parks director until 
Homan's replacement is selected. 
</P>
<P>
City officials project that operational and maintenance costs for Veterans Park 
will exceed $1 million in its first year. Operating costs in future years are 
expected to be about $750,000 annually, although cuts in maintenance and 
staffing could reduce that figure. 
</P>
<P>
Homan says the park can eventually become self-supporting. In its first five 
months of operation, the park has generated more than $100,000 in user fees, he 
said, well ahead of a projection of $156,000 for the entire year. 
</P>
<P>
However, city officials doubt that the park will ever pay for itself. They 
compare it to the Community Center, a project similarly spearheaded by Homan 
that was built about nine years ago. Deputy City Administrator Scot Yotsuya 
said the center costs the city about $1.25 million annually and generates about 
$750,000 a year, largely through rental fees. 
</P>
<P>
The 38,000-square-foot sports complex at Veterans Park includes a multipurpose 
gymnasium, a gymnastics and aerobics center and weight room. The city charges 
residents $15 to $40 a month to use the facilities, and fees are double that 
for non-residents. 
</P>
<P>
Although the fees generate income for the city, they also have generated 
criticism from some residents who say they cannot afford them. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Becerril, area director of the Young Life outreach organization, often 
brings youth groups to city parks for sports activities. During a recent 
basketball drill on the outdoor courts at Veterans Park, he noted that many of 
his teen-agers can't afford to use the sports complex. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question it's beautiful," Becerril said, motioning to the massive 
complex behind him. "But what's the use of having a Cadillac or a Rolls if you 
can't use it?" 
</P>
<P>
Homan defends both Veterans Park and the Community Center as "major public 
relations tools for the city. The two things that will bring it the most 
attention from now on will be Veterans Park and the Community Center." 
</P>
<P>
Redevelopment funds were used to build the park, but some officials say not 
enough consideration was given to maintenance costs. 
</P>
<P>
"What the city has done is build parks with redevelopment fund money and 
operate (them) with general fund money," Smith said. "That's like Rockefeller 
saying, 'I'll give you my $5-million yacht,' but it costs you $2,000 a day to 
operate. You don't want it, right? Well, that's the same thing. We're trying to 
operate these parks with a very limited amount of money (that) we can use from 
the general fund." 
</P>
<P>
Operations and maintenance costs in the parks budget amounted to $4.1 million 
in 1989, or about 56% of the $7.3 million the department spent. Special 
services and recreational programming, which includes salaries, accounted for 
$2.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many cities, which rely largely on part-time recreational staff, Carson 
has two full-time staff members in each of its 12 parks and in the boxing and 
aquatic centers. The most recent budget proposal would eliminate 80 full-time 
positions throughout the city, about half of which are now vacant. In the parks 
department, 18 full-time employees would be laid off, including one full-time 
staff member in each park facility. 
</P>
<P>
City officials point out that each park had only one full-time staff member 
until 1988, when the city decided to convert 57 part-time employees, most of 
them in the parks department, to full-time status. The conversion cost the city 
$1.6 million in increased salaries and benefits, according to Yotsuya. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed parks department staffing cuts have angered a large number of 
residents, many of whom have lambasted the council at a number of budget 
hearings since an advisory committee in September first suggested scaling back 
the department. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents fear that a cut in recreation programs and staff would allow 
area gangs to take control of the city's parks. They also note that the parks 
are almost the sole source of recreation and leisure activities in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Ysais, a volunteer at Carriage Crest Park, urged the council in September 
not to cut back on recreation employees, calling them "the ones that put kids 
in the right direction, the ones that keep the bad influence out." 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting last month, Joseph Walker, a longtime Carson resident, declared: 
"If you want to keep this city the way it is, then don't mess with the parks." 
</P>
<P>
But several city officials say they do not plan to cut popular park programs 
and that residents have been deliberately misled by parks employees on some 
issues. They also say that residents' appearances before the council have been 
orchestrated to create political pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"My speculation is that it goes all the way to the top," DeWitt said recently, 
referring to Homan. "Some of the outcry was (based on) information that the 
council had not even received yet. (Pressure tactics) used to work in the past, 
but not anymore. I think the council understands the seriousness of the city's 
financial picture." 
</P>
<P>
Homan adamantly denied that park employees had prompted residents' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"If (parks) staff members really wanted to orchestrate their public support, 
you would have seen thousands of people at these meetings," Homan said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed 1990-91 budget is $29.45 million, almost as much as the $29.9 
million the city actually spent last year. However, the city had to dip into 
reserves last year, and council members have said they are determined to hold 
spending in line with income this year. 
</P>
<P>
The tentative budget sets aside $6.1 million for parks and recreation, compared 
to the $7.3 million the department spent in 1989-90. Smith points out the 
department would have spent even more last year if Veterans Park had been in 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
Although council members generally agree that the parks department needs to 
sustain budget cuts, they disagree over the best way to go about that. 
</P>
<P>
DeWitt and Councilwoman Sylvia Muise both say layoffs are necessary to balance 
the budget. But council members Juanita McDonald and Michael Mitoma oppose 
layoffs. Councilwoman Kay Calas has been noncommittal and was absent last week 
when the council split 2 to 2 in a vote on the proposed budget. 
</P>
<P>
Even without the cost of maintenance and utilities, city officials say, 
Carson's parks budget is still disproportionately higher than those of other 
Southland cities. 
</P>
<P>
Area parks directors say such a comparison is difficult to draw because few 
cities have departmental structures similar to Carson's. 
</P>
<P>
However, in Lakewood, a city whose budget, population and departmental 
responsibilities closely resemble Carson's, park expenses consume a far smaller 
proportion of the annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
Lakewood's 1990-91 city budget is about $26.6 million, of which $2.9 million, 
or 11%, is allotted to the Recreation and Community Services Department, 
according to city spokesman Don Waldie. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas Carson spends $108.33 on a per capita basis for parks and community 
services, Lakewood spends $37.42. 
</P>
<P>
The $2.9-million figure includes maintenance of all city buildings, 
landscaping, utilities and recreational staffing at 13 city parks, Waldie said. 
The number of full-time recreation employees in the parks varies, he said, but 
generally full-time workers are hired only for the summer. 
</P>
<P>
In Carson, by contrast, there are 36 full-time recreation employees. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the city can afford to retain that staffing level is one of the 
difficult budget issues that await the City Council at its next budget workshop 
on Tuesday. Whatever action the council ultimately decides to take, the 
decision is not likely to be an easy one. 
</P>
<P>
"I grant you, I love everything we have," DeWitt said, "but we have not been 
serious in looking at how we will maintain it. I think we've got to bite the 
bullet." 
</P>

DEAN TAKES AIM AT PETERSON'S PET PROJECTS, STYLE

John F. Dean handily swept county Supt. of Schools Robert Peterson out of 
office in Tuesday's election. And now he appears bent on sweeping out all 
vestiges of Peterson's 24-year administration, as well. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on his wide margin of victory and looking ahead to his new job, Dean 
on Wednesday said he plans to institute widespread changes in the County 
Department of Education immediately after he takes over Jan. 7 as schools 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
He also hinted that several of Peterson's pet projects -- including the 
well-known Academic Decathlon -- could fall victim to revisions of the 
department's $74.5-million annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the first things we'll do is look at the budget to make sure we're not 
duplicating any of the services the districts are already providing," Dean, a 
63-year-old Newport Beach resident, said in an interview at the Disneyland 
Hotel in Anaheim, where he was attending a board meeting of the California 
Reading Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll turn things around to place a greater emphasis on instructional services 
and help the districts implement new curriculums," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Soon after that, we'll contact district superintendents and teachers 
associations and classified personnel to set up a Strategic Planning Task 
Force, so we are doing the things that the districts want and need. I'm not 
egotistical enough to think I know what they need." 
</P>
<P>
Dean said his pledge to hit the ground running as soon as he takes office will 
be necessary to deflect pressure from county educators and others eager to see 
an immediate turnaround from the low-key, low-profile management style that 
characterized Peterson's years in office. 
</P>
<P>
After drawing nearly 63% of the vote in Tuesday's election -- a result Dean 
called "a surprise" -- Dean said he expects public expectations to be high. 
"But I've been in leadership roles for a long time," he said. "I think I know 
what it is to be under that kind of pressure." 
</P>
<P>
To face up to the pressure, Dean said, he'll have to give up most of his 
current leadership roles to devote full time to his job as superintendent, for 
which he will earn upward of $100,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
He plans to resign as executive secretary of the California Reading Assn. and 
hopes to be released from his obligations as a professor of education at 
Whittier College by the start of the new year.

Tired of New England winters, literature professor James Simmons chucked his 
job at Boston University in 1973 and started driving. About 13,000 miles and 
four months later, he turned off the freeway in San Diego and fell in love with 
the warm climate and postcard-perfect beaches. It took him another year to find 
out he could turn his passion for travel into a paying job. Now a free-lance 
writer specializing in adventure travel, he authors articles and books, 
including one on his favorite corners of the Earth and another about Americans 
as others see us. Simmons, a Pacific Beach resident, was interviewed by Times 
Staff writer G. Jeanette Avent and photographed by Vince Compagnone. 
</P>
<P>
 While I was teaching, I had been doing a lot of traveling on my own, but it 
was a real different kind of traveling from what I do now. I'd spend three 
months traveling through Asia by myself. It was pretty solitary, which was 
fine. But, once I started doing adventure travel with naturalists along, I was 
hooked. You get into a group of people with shared interests and it becomes a 
traveling seminar. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, I did the best trip I've ever done, a 30-day cruise to Antarctica 
which was real frontier at that time. There were about 80 of us on board, 
including six naturalists and Roger Tory Peterson, the No. 1 name in 
ornithology. We spent five days doing the first tourist exploration of South 
Georgia Island, which had been the center of the Antarctic whaling industry. 
That was all closed down, but everything was intact. You'd walk up to the dock, 
and all the whaling vessels were there with their big harpoon guns. There was 
the chart room, the dining room china, the galley. Sitting out in a mud bank 
was a well preserved, Norwegian three-masted whaling vessel from 1885. You'd go 
into the movie house, and the walls were all lined with posters advertising 
Randolph Scott Westerns from the '30s and a Gary Cooper film from 1943. 
</P>
<P>
We had some good weather, and we went south where the pack ice had split up. We 
went into areas where there were no docks and you had to go over the side of 
the ship in Zodiacs, which are small, 16-foot inflatable motorboats. Antarctica 
is so splendid. It has one of the great profusions of wildlife in the world. It 
has penguin rookeries where there are 2 million birds. There are no predators 
on land in Antarctica so you can walk right up and practically touch a penguin. 
It boggles the mind. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose the most dangerous trip was the one down the Omo River in 
southwestern Ethiopia. We had a hippo attack on the boat. The Omo was the last 
pocket of territory to be explored by Westerners. I went in 1975 on the first 
commercial expedition, and the first natives we saw had never seen Westerners. 
It was Africa the way it was 150 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
We were 25 days on the river and covered about 300 miles. For the first half, 
we were at the bottom of a canyon at 4,000 feet, which had some splendid 
scenery and excellent white water. The second half was savannah country, and 
that's where the people were. The trip was wonderful but what made it dangerous 
is the difference between African river running and American river running. If 
you flip over in a raft at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, you know exactly 
what to do. You have your life jacket on, and you go into the rapids feet first 
and you come out. In Africa, when you come out in the calm water, you've got 
the crocodiles to contend with. 
</P>
<P>
We never had a boat flip, but you always knew if something happened, it'd be 
you and the crocodiles. They're big ones, 18 to 20 feet long, and we'd see six 
or eight of them at a time lying on the bank. We had these croc rocks so when 
the crocodiles came close to the boat we were supposed to shout obscenities and 
throw these croc rocks. That was a requirement. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the hippo attack, we were going through a place on the river 
called hippo alley where as many as 500 to 600 hippos have been counted passing 
through during the day. What hippos do in the heat of the day is walk on the 
bottom of the river. They come up every five minutes for air and then go back 
down. You have to be careful to stay in shallow water so you don't have hippos 
coming up underneath you. One of our boatmen got careless and wasn't in shallow 
water, and a hippo surfaced right along side of the boat. The hippo panicked. 
These enormous jaws opened and he bit down on the boat. He just missed a 
passenger by a foot. It was over in two seconds, and then the hippo was gone. 
We had to go ashore and fix the pontoon. We just all thought it was a great 
adventure. 
</P>
<P>
In March, I spent my birthday on Pitcairn Island where the Bounty mutineers 
ended up in 1790. Pitcairn celebrated its 200th anniversary this year. We were 
the first cruise boat to stay overnight. It was interesting seeing Pitcairn 
through Pitcairn eyes. At the top of a hill was a house, so we asked them about 
that. That's our vacation house, they said. That's where we come when we want 
to get away from the sound of the sea. It's fascinating because everywhere you 
turn there's the ghost of the Bounty. In the town square there's an anchor from 
the Bounty. In one of the houses, there's was a canon from the Bounty. The 
Bible from the Bounty is in the church. One of the very earliest homes is built 
from the planks of the Bounty. Nearly half of the population has the last name 
of Fletcher Christian. You can see the cave where he hid out. It's a 
ghost-ridden island. That's why they landed there; it was uninhabited. It is 
way off the shipping lanes. I love end-of-the-world places.

4 CHARGED IN COCAINE SALES TO HAWAII 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four men, two from Torrance and the others from Hawaii, were in custody Friday 
after having been charged with allegedly operating a narcotics ring in which 
they shipped cocaine from the South Bay to Hawaii in coffee cans. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested Wednesday and charged with possession for sale of cocaine and 
conspiracy to transport two kilograms of the drug were Gilbert Frasquillo, 32, 
and Reggie Judd, 31, both of Torrance; Samuel Kalahiki, 33, of Kailua, Hawaii, 
and Joseph Makahilahila, 34, of Honolulu, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Oghigian said. 
</P>
<P>
Frasquillo is being held on $500,000 bond at Los Angeles County Jail pending 
arraignment Wednesday, authorities said. The other three pleaded not guilty 
Thursday in South Bay Municipal Court and are being held on bond pending a 
preliminary hearing Nov. 27, Deputy Dist. Atty. Frank Duarte said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the four were arrested by Redondo Beach police after a 
two-month undercover operation in which they allegedly packed cocaine in coffee 
cans at their Torrance homes and shipped it by United Parcel Service to Hawaii 
for sale. Coffee grounds were packed around the plastic-wrapped cocaine to 
disguise the smell, Oghigian said. 
</P>
<P>
The four were arrested after allegedly selling the two kilos, worth about 
$24,000 each, to undercover officers. A search of their homes turned up about 
$50,000 cash and machinery to seal coffee cans, authorities said.

VICTIM OF GANG SLAYING WAS FROM GARDENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A youth who was killed in a drive-by shooting in Lawndale on Monday minutes 
after school let out has been identified as a Leuzinger High School student who 
recently joined a Filipino gang, sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Delgado, 16, of Gardena, who sang in the school's top choir group since 
his freshman year, was shot in the head Monday by members of a rival Vietnamese 
gang as he waited with a group of friends for a ride home, said Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Detective Ed Milkey. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting, which occurred outside a house on 147th Street about one block 
from the Leuzinger campus, appeared to be in retaliation for a fistfight 
earlier in the day in which a large group of Filipino gang members beat up a 
Vietnamese gang member, Milkey said. 
</P>
<P>
That beating, in turn, was apparently in retaliation for a beating suffered by 
two Filipino gang members two weeks before, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"(Delgado) was a nice kid; he just joined the wrong group at the wrong time and 
was in the wrong place at the wrong time," Milkey said. 
</P>
<P>
Three crisis counselors from Robert F. Kennedy Medical Center spent Tuesday at 
Leuzinger High speaking to students who sang with Delgado in the choir. Members 
of the Leuzinger Select Chorale will sing at his funeral at St. Jerome's 
Catholic Church in Westchester on Monday morning.

An early evening apartment fire routed residents from five surrounding units

Westminster Fire Department Battalion Chief Hal Raphael said no one was injured 
in the single-alarm blaze reported at 5:09 p.m. Saturday at the Cascade 
Apartments, 14300 Chestnut St. 
</P>
<P>
Raphael said the fire started in the bedroom of a second-story unit when 
residents were not at home. The residents were not identified by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters had to pull down a considerable portion of the unit's ceiling to 
contain the flames, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in the five neighboring units were forced to evacuate because of fire 
and smoke damage, the chief said.

SPY WHO SEEKS ASYLUM IN U.S. TO STAY IN JAIL

<P>
A 40-year-old self-proclaimed former double agent for Cuba who now seeks to 
defect to the United States will remain jailed in San Diego until at least 
Thursday, a federal judge has decided. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Lawrence J. Irving said Saturday that there was no pressing 
reason why Juan Manuel Rodriguez Camejo, a Cuban citizen, should be ordered 
released this weekend, as his attorneys had requested. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Irving, who heard telephonic arguments Friday on the case and later 
reviewed papers submitted on the matter, said that a hearing would likely be 
scheduled for Thursday in federal court in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, who has been held without bond in San Diego since he was arrested 
along the U.S.-Mexico border Oct. 29, is seeking release on bond pending 
adjudication of his petition for political asylum on U.S. soil. The asylum 
application process can drag on for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. authorities oppose Rodriguez's release and his request for asylum, 
contending that he is a threat to U.S. national security. 
</P>
<P>
In court, U.S. officials have argued that Rodriguez remains a Cuban agent and 
is seeking asylum as cover for his intelligence activities here. Rodriguez has 
acknowledged that he worked for more than two decades for Cuban intelligence 
services, including a seven-year-period when he was on the U.S. Central 
Intelligence Agency payroll in Havana but was actually working against the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Rodriguez says he has renounced communism and wants to work in the United 
States to oust Cuban President Fidel Castro, Washington's longtime adversary. 
U.S. authorities maintain that Rodriguez's proclaimed conversion is a ruse, and 
that he should remain jailed pending the outcome of his asylum case. 
</P>
<P>
An immigration judge ordered Rodriguez freed Thursday on $7,500 bail, 
apparently paving the way for his release. But, on Friday, U.S. authorities won 
a stay of that order.

Joey Hernandez Sr., the man arrested Friday night for allegedly striking Buena 
Park High School Coach Martin Luczaj after a Freeway League football game, is 
the father of Joey Hernandez Jr., a Fullerton running back who suffered an 
injured knee during Fullerton's 21-12 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez, a senior who also plays linebacker, was hurt in the second quarter 
while being tackled after his only carry of the game, a one-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
After watching films of the play, Fullerton Coach Pat Ward said the injury was 
caused by a Buena Park defender who speared the knee with his helmet after 
Hernandez had been stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Tests on Hernandez's knee will be performed Monday to determine the extent of 
the injury, which almost certainly will keep him out of the Indians' 
first-round playoff game Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a flagrant cheap shot and the film shows that," Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
Ward said Hernandez's injury apparently sparked the postgame incident that 
involved at least two Fullerton fans. Hernandez Sr. was cited and released at 
the scene. Luczaj did not appear to be hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Steve Matson of the Fullerton Police Department said Saturday that the 
district attorney will review the case and decide whether to file misdemeanor 
assault and battery charges. 
</P>
<P>
Reached Saturday by telephone, Hernandez Sr. declined to comment. Luczaj did 
not return calls to his home. MARTIN BECK

Invoking the cause of corporate democracy, New York investor Martin E. Tash and 
his backers last month gained control of the board of directors of Gradco 
Systems Inc. by winning the hearts and minds of shareholders in a contentious 
proxy fight. 
</P>
<P>
Two months earlier at Comprehensive Care Corp., a group including a former 
company executive from Orange County waged a successful proxy battle, gaining 
control of the St. Louis-based company's board and ousting the chief executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
Such victories by dissident shareholders are making companies respect the power 
of the proxy. Still, there is no consensus that the proxy is the best weapon 
for shareholders to use against entrenched corporate management. 
</P>
<P>
Dissidents are winning more proxy fights -- the solicitation of shareholder 
votes by opposing slates -- and increasingly are targeting small companies. 
They say interest in proxy fights has been fueled by the collapse of the junk 
bond market -- which funded many takeovers -- shareholder unhappiness with 
falling stock prices in a slumping economy and a general increase in activism 
by institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
But proxy fights remain the exception and not the rule. Such battles are too 
expensive for most investors to launch, and the rules tend to favor management. 
The tender offer is still the best tool for a takeover, investment experts say. 
</P>
<P>
These issues have prompted the Securities and Exchange Commission to consider 
reforming the proxy process to make it easier for shareholders to make their 
voices heard. Such changes could make the proxy a more potent weapon. 
</P>
<P>
"This was supposed to be the season of the proxy fight, but the numbers have 
been pretty constant (compared to previous years)," said Lilli Gordon, managing 
director of the Analysis Group, a shareholder advisory service in Belmont, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 months of this year, dissident shareholders launched 38 proxy 
fights, according to Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC) in 
Washington. That compares to 27 in all of 1989 and 56 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"My sense is 1991 will be a very busy season, and I think the profile of the 
proxy fighter will change beyond corporate raiders in the 1990s," Gordon said. 
"People who have kept low profiles in the corporate arena will launch the 
battles." 
</P>
<P>
She expects more and more institution and individual investors -- those with 
large stock holdings and who are unhappy with management decisions or response 
to outside proposals -- to put forward their own board nominees in opposition 
to management candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the chances that a publicly owned company will face a proxy fight are 
slim. Richard Wines, senior vice president at Georgeson &amp; Co., a New York 
proxy consulting firm, says that fewer than 1% of the nation's 13,000 public 
companies will face a proxy battle in any given year. He said tender offers -- 
a friendly or hostile bid to obtain the company's stock at a set price -- 
remain far more likely. 
</P>
<P>
But in the proxy battles that are being launched, challengers are meeting with 
greater success than in the past. This year, dissidents won 34.2% of the fights 
monitored by IRRC in 1990, compared to 31.6% management victories and 34.2% 
neutral outcomes such as settlements. That compares to 21% dissident victories, 
60% management victories, and 19% neutral outcomes in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the increased success of dissidents, Wines said he urges 
companies to attempt to stave off proxy fights by taking steps to identify who 
their large investors are and to learn their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Of the proxy fights launched this year, 24 involved battles for full board 
control. Dissidents fared worse in such fights, winning only 25% of the time, 
compared to 50% management victories, and 25% neutral outcomes. 
</P>
<P>
But proxy experts said more dissident gains are hidden in these numbers, noting 
that settlements generally involve some kind of concession by management and a 
measurable gain in influence for the dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
Even the possibility of shareholder revolt has prompted some management teams 
to make concessions with only the threat of a proxy fight. Such was the case at 
Costa Mesa-based Emulex Corp., sources said, when Fred B. Cox, co-founder and 
chairman, agreed to give up the posts of chief executive officer and president. 
His move came after the company reported a $3.1-million operating loss in April 
and an outside venture capitalist who had previously attempted to take over the 
company regained a seat on the company's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look closely at the goals of the dissidents, you find that they use the 
proxy fight as a tactic to achieve them," Gordon said. "This year they got 
their way two out of three times." 
</P>
<P>
Her firm identified six motives for launching proxy fights: acquiring the 
company; seeking board approval of a sale of a company; forcing a change in 
corporate policy without a sale or liquidation; replacement of management; 
monitoring board activities; and changing the company's governance structure, 
such as repealing anti-takeover measures. 
</P>
<P>
While Gargantuan battles, including corporate raider Harold Simmons' attempt to 
take control of Lockheed Corp., grabbed the headlines this year, more smaller 
companies were besieged by rebellious shareholders. Only nine of the proxy 
fights launched this year involved Fortune 500 companies. 
</P>
<P>
"This proxy season there were a lot of high-profile battles," said Howard D. 
Sherman, vice president of Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., a company 
that advises institutional clients on proxy voting in Washington. "I'd expect 
next year it will filter down to smaller companies as the awareness spreads." 
</P>
<P>
One reason is simple economics. If a company's earnings suffer and its stock 
price falls, shareholder unrest rises, said John J. Giovannone, an attorney who 
advises companies about proxy law at Sheppard, Mullin, Richter &amp; Hampton in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there is a growing activism among institutional investors, who 
closely watch the bottom lines. While institutional investors -- insurance 
companies, pension funds, money market funds and others that invest huge pools 
of money -- often are content to be silent investment partners, more and more 
become vocal in demanding that companies protect shareholders' interests. One 
such institutional activist is the California Public Employees Retirement 
System, or Calpers. 
</P>
<P>
The institutions can become "kingmakers" in proxy battles. Though they rarely 
lead the fights themselves, the institutions favor independent boards and are 
often courted like royalty in proxy fights because they control big blocks of 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
Their activism is reflected in the dramatic increase in shareholder proposals. 
The American Society of Corporate Secretaries (ASCS) in New York said its 2,400 
member companies report that shareholders submitted 739 proposals during the 
year ended June 30. Five years ago, only 442 proposals were submitted by 
shareholders in the group. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the proposals pertained to issues of changes in corporate ownership, 
shareholder rights, executive compensation, corporate governance and social 
issues such as the environment, said Richard Pyle, vice president of the 
society. He said this year that votes in favor of such proposals reached record 
highs. 
</P>
<P>
At Calabasas-based Lockheed Corp., management defeated Simmons' bid for board 
control, but it promised to add three new directors to represent institutional 
shareholders. It also approved four Simmons-sponsored proposals to rescind a 
poison-pill plan, renounce greenmail, institute confidential voting and opt out 
of Delaware's anti-takeover law. 
</P>
<P>
Calpers backed Simmons in the fight, a clear sign that institutional investors, 
who control about $2.6 trillion in investments and own roughly 18% of all 
stocks, are no longer blindly casting their votes in favor of management 
proposals, Sherman said. 
</P>
<P>
At Gradco, an Irvine-based maker of copier and printer sorter equipment, all 
but one of a dozen institutional investors voted with the dissidents. Those 
shareholders were upset with huge stock losses and a controversial plan to 
restructure the company. Tash and his supporters claimed the plan would have 
enriched management at shareholders' expense. 
</P>
<P>
The Tash-led group won majority control of Gradco, prompting the immediate 
resignation of the company's founder and chairman, Keith Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
At CompCare, the operator of a chain of chemical dependency and psychiatric 
treatment centers, dissidents were dissatisfied with the company's financial 
performance and won majority control in a proxy fight that lasted eight weeks. 
The dissident committee was headed by Portland securities broker Les 
Livingston, who had invested more than $1 million of his firm's cash in 
CompCare stock in anticipation of a merger that later fell through. 
</P>
<P>
Both Gradco and CompCare were vulnerable because of their bleak financial 
performance, but proxy fights are expected to increase throughout the nation 
regardless of the state of the economy, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
John C. Wilcox, managing director of Georgeson &amp; Co., said that proxy 
fights may see a resurgence because more shareholders are demanding that boards 
serve as independent liaisons between the shareholders and management rather 
than tools of management. 
</P>
<P>
But some dissidents protest that there are roadblocks in their way. Ralph 
Whitworth, president of the 64,000-member United Shareholders Assn. (USA) in 
Washington, complains that the deck in proxy fights still remains stacked 
against dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
"You won't see the effects of proxy activism until you have a reform of the 
voting process," said Whitworth, whose group was founded by corporate raider T. 
Boone Pickens in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The proxy fight can be less disruptive, less expensive and more efficient than 
the traditional tender offer, Whitworth said. And the dissident can achieve his 
goals if he succeeds in swaying the votes of a few large institutional 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
As a takeover tool, the proxy vote suffers from some drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Management can use company funds to finance its own proxy campaign. Gradco 
spent about $1 million on an investment banking firm, a public relations firm 
and a proxy solicitation service in an unsuccessful effort to fend off Tash, 
who spent $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the rebellious shareholders are often on the outside looking in, 
unable to access confidential information or even lists of shareholders and 
therefore sometimes unable to come up with their own alternatives to management 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
To fend off proxy rebels, management can take such defensive steps as giving 
directors staggered, three-year terms, eliminating the shareholders' right to 
call a special meeting, making it costly to remove members from the board or 
expanding the board, Sherman said. And just as they did in lobbying for 
anti-takeover laws, companies can lobby for state laws to limit the proxy 
battle as well. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have a lot of money to wage a proxy fight," said Randy Young, 
president of Everhart Corp., a Santa Ana venture capital firm and a member of 
USA. "There's no question where the odds lie." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the victories of dissidents such as Tash, who used no proxy solicitation 
service but rather relied on a groundswell of disgruntled investors, are all 
the more surprising. 
</P>
<P>
In the coming year, some experts say the odds could change. The SEC is taking 
proposals on proxy reform from a wide variety of groups, including USA, 
Calpers, the American Bar Assn. and the ASCS. 
</P>
<P>
USA has proposed that the SEC require companies to endorse confidential voting, 
provide shareholders access to proxy materials and shareholder lists, and 
require shareholder votes on devices designed to protect management, such as 
poison pills. Whitworth said the number of dissident victories would be 
dramatically higher if such reforms were adopted. 
</P>
<P>
But ASCS spokesman Richard H. Troy said the existing process, in which 
individual states can adopt their own proxy laws, works just fine. The 
association is a staunch management supporter and frequent foe of USA. 
</P>
<P>
"It would not be wise to open up the proxy process completely to the small 
group of rich investors," he said. "The businesses would spend a 
disproportionate amount of time engaged in proxy fights every year." 
</P>
<P>
Troy also said that granting rights to shareholders with large stakes would 
unfairly create two tiers of stockholders. Dissidents say such rights, such as 
cumulative voting rules that allow large stockholders to vote their shares in 
such a way as to guarantee a seat on the board, ensure they can have a say in 
corporate affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox said that creating a proxy system that is out of kilter with the way 
private companies are run would dampen the appeal of going public, and he said 
it would be wrong to condemn the system based on the past lopsided victories in 
favor of management. 
</P>
<P>
"That's like judging the legal system based on the number of acquittals or 
convictions," Wilcox said. "The proxy is a tool to make management accountable. 
But it would be economically non-productive to have a contested election every 
year. These aren't like little countries with political parties." 
</P>
<P>
The SEC has already loosened its restrictions on what issues are appropriate 
for shareholder proposals in proxy statements. Despite objections from 
companies that say the issues are day-to-day management issues, the agency has 
allowed several shareholder resolutions on golden parachutes, confidential 
voting and shareholder advisory committees. 
</P>
<P>
In entertaining some sort of change, SEC officials say they want to improve 
corporate governance to boost the competitiveness of U.S. companies.

<TEXT>
<P>
Late on a Friday afternoon in September, Victoria Karter walked into the Four 
Seasons Hotel, declined the offer of a fourth-floor room and took one instead 
on the 19th floor. 
</P>
<P>
A tall, dark-haired woman with an angular face, Karter, 33, carried a garment 
bag as well as a purse. She stayed in the room only about one hour, but it was 
long enough to leave cigarettes snuffed out in ashtrays and to put a ring of 
lipstick around the neck of the Jack Daniels liquor bottle she brought with 
her. Long enough, too, to make a final telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
The call was intended for Kathy Boone, a woman who had been Karter's friend for 
more than 20 years. But because Boone wasn't there, Karter talked to Virginia 
Rivera, Boone's mother and a woman who considered Karter a member of her own 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Karter told Rivera what she had been telling Boone since soon after the birth 
of her first child 4 1/2 months earlier: She wanted to commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"She told me that she wanted to talk to Kathy and she needed to tell her a few 
things before she would kill herself," Rivera said. "I said, 'Vicky, give me 
your number and I'll have Kathy call you. She should be here any moment.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Karter refused to say where she was. 
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'Mrs. Rivera, I'm so sick, I feel so sick.' At that moment it seemed 
like she dropped the phone. I kept calling her. I could hear noises. I thought 
maybe someone was there with her. I stayed on the phone the longest time. Then 
all of a sudden I didn't hear anything." 
</P>
<P>
Karter walked out on the balcony of room 1902 and jumped to her death. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Owen Lee sits in the living room of his comfortable Newport Beach home, 
bouncing his daughter, Rachel, on his knee and then putting a bottle in her 
mouth. Periodically, he stops talking to fight back tears. 
</P>
<P>
A dark-haired, bespectacled businessman who chooses his words carefully, Lee 
says that both he and Karter had wanted children. "My personal point of view is 
. . . that's what life is all about, to have a family and raise kids." 
</P>
<P>
Lee, 35, thinks of himself as an "old-fashioned kind of guy" who wanted to 
marry just once, "settle down and live happily ever after. Unfortunately, 
happily ever after in my case was three years." 
</P>
<P>
In six months he has gone from being the husband of a pregnant wife to being a 
widower left to raise an infant daughter on his own. He tries to juggle his 
work schedule to spend as much time as possible with his child. He hopes he 
doesn't hear an old favorite song on the radio to make him burst into tears. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that despite the adversity that I'm facing right now, my primary focus 
has to be toward my baby," Lee says. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sitting here right now and you see me and I'm pretty composed and I can 
talk to you about the incident. Two weeks ago if you had seen me I would be 
crying and . . . distraught about not knowing what's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Baby books and toys dot the house. There is other literature, too, explaining a 
condition Lee said he never heard of before Rachel's birth: postpartum 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
It's believed that postpartum depression caused Karter's suicide, an illness 
Lee said he heard about for the first time when his wife was hospitalized at 
UCI Medical Center. That was almost three months after Rachel's birth in late 
April, a typically happy, blessed event for most women, but one that plunged 
Karter into despair. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors say that while most mothers get the "baby blues" after giving birth, 
the condition lasts only a little while. Postpartum depression, by contrast, 
strikes about 10% of new mothers and does not "cure itself." 
</P>
<P>
The illness has been known for centuries, but only in the past 10 to 15 years 
has it been studied in depth. Medical opinion is divided on whether the 
depression stems from a chemical imbalance after childbirth or if it is caused 
largely by existing emotional problems, troubles that Karter never seemed to 
have before giving birth. 
</P>
<P>
Psychiatrists say only a tiny minority of those who develop a full-fledged 
postpartum depression kill themselves or their children. One doctor calls the 
number "small" but "significant." 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Boone and Vicky Karter met when they were 11 years old, in 1968, in 
junior high school. Boone said her friend was happy and outgoing, an artist 
talented at drawing, a poet, a journalism student and "very creative." 
</P>
<P>
Boone's mother, Virginia Rivera, called Karter "an average, normal girl." She 
was at the Rivera house in Montebello so often as a child that Rivera "felt 
like she was our stepdaughter or adopted daughter." The death of her mother a 
year or so after Karter graduated from high school struck her hard, Rivera 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It bothered her a lot that she didn't have her mother there for her. I told 
her whenever she needed someone, just call me, and she always did." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, even after Karter went off to college at Cal State Long Beach 
and Boone got married not long after high school, the friends stayed together. 
Karter would bring boyfriends by to meet Boone's mother, but she kept waiting 
to meet the right one to marry. 
</P>
<P>
Karter and Lee met in 1985 at a dance at a temple in Beverly Hills. After 
dating for two years, they married in Las Vegas on her 30th birthday, the first 
marriage for each. They held a party later for friends at the Newport Beach 
house that had been his and became theirs. She worked in the family office 
supply store in East Los Angeles. He worked at the office machine distribution 
company he had founded after graduating from USC in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
If there was one smudge on the picture, it was Karter's frequent concern with 
what other people thought, and her tendency to make mountains out of molehills. 
</P>
<P>
"Vicky was the kind of person that would make everything into a major problem," 
Boone said. "When she was thinking of marrying Greg, she would wonder: Should 
she do it? Shouldn't she do it? . . . What if it didn't work out? What if she 
got divorced?" 
</P>
<P>
But the marriage was a happy one, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't say we agreed on everything 100%, but we never had fights, yelling 
fights or anything like that. . . . We got along exceptionally well." 
</P>
<P>
And a little more than two years after their marriage, Karter became pregnant. 
"She seemed the happiest I've ever seen her," Boone remembered. 
</P>
<P>
But after Rachel's birth, Karter's attitude changed. 
</P>
<P>
"I went with my kids to the hospital with balloons," Boone said. Karter "didn't 
seem like someone who had a baby. It didn't seem like a joyous thing to her." 
</P>
<P>
One day about a month after the birth, a "hysterical" Karter called Boone. "She 
said she didn't know what to do. The baby cried a lot, had colic. Vicky wasn't 
prepared, I guess, for that. She was stuck in the house. She didn't know what 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
Lee said the newborn baby was in intensive care for three days for treatment of 
jaundice. When mother and daughter came home, Rachel cried seemingly around the 
clock for nearly three months, he said. But while his wife wasn't getting much 
sleep at all, he didn't see any "abnormal-type problems." 
</P>
<P>
That changed in mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
First came a call from Karter's sister, Lee said, telling him that "she was 
very concerned for Vicky's safety and Vicky had expressed some thoughts of 
suicide to her." The next day came a call from Boone, saying she, too, was 
worried about Vicky. 
</P>
<P>
An alarmed Lee took Karter to UCI Medical Center, where she was hospitalized 
until the end of the month. Lee said doctors there diagnosed her as suffering 
from postpartum depression and prescribed the antidepressant drug Pamelor, the 
trade name for a generic drug known as nortriptyline. (A medical center 
spokeswoman said that because of state and federal laws to protect the privacy 
of psychiatric patients, the hospital could not even confirm she had been a 
patient there, let alone discuss her case.) 
</P>
<P>
When she came home from the hospital, Karter got help with Rachel from a newly 
hired nanny/housekeeper. Lee, who attended Lamaze classes with his wife during 
her pregnancy and was in the delivery room during birth, said he also tried to 
help out more with the baby. 
</P>
<P>
After about two weeks at home, with lots of rest, the medication took full 
effect, and "I was utterly amazed," Lee said. Normally an even-tempered person, 
after Rachel's birth Karter had swung into deep depression. But now "she was 
uncharacteristically too enthusiastic. . . . All of a sudden she's the most 
enthusiastic, energetic person I've ever met. And I'm thinking to myself, 'Wow, 
these drugs are working great. This is fantastic. It's a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
Boone saw the change too. One day Karter telephoned her "and said she felt 
great . . . just felt wonderful. She had told me before that she felt she was 
walking around in a cloud, a fog, that she couldn't function. Then this one day 
she was wonderful, her head was clear, and for about three weeks she was like 
that, everything was fine." 
</P>
<P>
But Karter became depressed again. Lee said his wife told him she didn't 
understand what was happening, that she would go to the mall, see other women 
smiling happily as they pushed their babies in strollers. "And here I am, I've 
got a nice home and a nice husband and a nice baby, and yet I'm feeling weird," 
Lee remembered his wife saying. 
</P>
<P>
"And dumb me, I'm saying, 'Ah, things will pass, you're just getting back (to 
normal). Did you take your medicine?' " 
</P>
<P>
Boone said Karter told her that the doctors rejected her request to stop taking 
Pamelor when she was feeling better, but agreed to lower the dose. Later the 
dose was increased again, but it didn't seem to help. (The doctor at the Santa 
Ana psychiatric offices of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, who Lee 
said treated his wife after she was discharged from the hospital, declined 
comment and referred inquiries to the facility's administrator, who did not 
return phone calls). 
</P>
<P>
Karter told Boone in one of the telephone conversations they had nearly every 
day that she just couldn't function. 
</P>
<P>
"She kept telling me she was a bad person and everyone would be better off 
without her," Boone recalled. Karter said that after she died her husband 
eventually "would find somebody else and that person would take care of the 
baby." 
</P>
<P>
Still concerned with others' opinions of her, Karter rejected Boone's advice to 
get away for a few days. She said she was afraid to leave the baby at home for 
fear people would think she wasn't a good mother. She was afraid to admit her 
thoughts of suicide to her doctors for fear she would be institutionalized for 
the rest of her life, which would bankrupt her husband. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 19, a Wednesday, a woman who declined to give her name showed up at 
Newport Beach police headquarters at 8 p.m. with a disturbing tale. 
</P>
<P>
The woman said she had been at Cliff Drive Park in the Newport Heights section 
of Newport Beach a little bit earlier. While there she saw a woman with an 
infant. The woman seemed "despondent." The good Samaritan walked the woman to 
her car, copied her license plate number and alerted police to her concern. 
</P>
<P>
Police traced the number to Karter and visited her and Lee at their home. After 
interviewing the husband and wife separately and together, police concluded 
Karter was no danger to herself or anyone else just then, had resources she 
could turn to if she needed help, and left. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, Karter told her housekeeper she was going out for a while. At 1 
p.m., she made a reservation for a room at the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport 
Beach. She showed up at 3:30 p.m. to check in. One hotel employee called her 
"pleasant." Another described her as "distant." 
</P>
<P>
A bit after 4 p.m., Karter called Rivera to ask if Boone was there. Rivera said 
no, that her daughter was probably either still at her home in Cerritos or on 
the way to the Rivera house in Montebello. Karter said she'd try the Cerritos 
number. 
</P>
<P>
Around 4:30, Karter called Rivera again, saying she hadn't been able to reach 
Boone. "I told her to leave her number where she was and I'd have Kathy call 
her," Rivera remembered. "She said she was going to kill herself. She said she 
didn't want anyone to know where she was -- she didn't want anyone to stop 
her." 
</P>
<P>
Minutes after she heard the phone drop and her pleas to Karter go unanswered, 
Rivera's daughter arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Boone called Karter's housekeeper. She called Lee at one of his company's 
offices, in Moreno Valley. She called the Newport Beach police. 
</P>
<P>
Lee began frantically calling the Newport Beach police himself. He also called 
the Sheriff's Department and the California Highway Patrol. Then he drove home, 
where he made more phone calls. And waited. 
</P>
<P>
He called the Newport Beach police again, but found the dispatcher "evasive." 
He called the Costa Mesa police to see if they knew anything about his wife. He 
called Newport Beach again, talking to a dispatcher who Lee said promised "to 
have detectives talk to me." 
</P>
<P>
"Not knowing is worse than knowing," Lee said, and for more than three hours he 
didn't know. At around 8:30 that night, though, two detectives and a deputy 
coroner showed up at his house "and said they had information about my wife." 
He knew.

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BLUE AND BLACK; 
</P>
<P>
NEW MOTHERS: BEING A LITTLE DOWN IS NORMAL AND USUALLY CURES ITSELF, BUT DEEP 
DEPRESSION ISN'T AND REQUIRES EXPERT TREATMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Most women get the blues after giving birth, but the difference between that 
mild feeling of "being down" and an all-out depression is like the difference 
between a gentle spring rain and a flood, professionals say. 
</P>
<P>
The "baby blues" are usually marked by fatigue and frequently tears, said Dr. 
Lori Altshuler, a psychiatrist who teaches at UCLA Medical Center and has a 
private practice in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The blues typically start from three to seven days after birth and last a few 
weeks, Altshuler said. Expectant mothers are often told that such a feeling is 
normal, because "it helps them not feel anxious." 
</P>
<P>
But a woman struck by full-fledged postpartum depression often has insomnia, is 
agitated and has trouble concentrating, Altshuler said. Other symptoms may 
include a feeling of worthlessness, decreased appetite and a loss of interest 
in her surroundings, including the baby. 
</P>
<P>
Where the blues cure themselves, a clinical depression requires medication and 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
The psychiatrist said one problem with postpartum depression is that it may not 
show itself until a week or more -- sometimes months -- after the baby is born. 
By that time the mother is home, without professional help. As a result, the 
first professional to realize what the mother is experiencing may be a 
pediatrician seeing the baby when the mother brings it in for a checkup. 
</P>
<P>
Altshuler said about one in 10 new mothers develop postpartum depression. About 
one in 1,000 develop postpartum psychosis, which she defined as losing touch 
with reality. The psychotic mother may think her baby is deformed when it's 
fine, may hear voices or see apparitions. 
</P>
<P>
Even among the minority of women who become psychotic, the risk of a mother 
killing her child is only about 3%, Altshuler said. "It's not a huge number, 
but it is more than insignificant." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the psychiatrists' bible, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, does not 
have a separate entry for postpartum psychosis. 
</P>
<P>
The manual lists definite symptoms for its diseases, but in postpartum 
psychosis, "symptoms are so variable that (the disease) doesn't fit into one 
category," Altshuler said. As a result, the index listing for the illness 
refers doctors to other forms of mental illness, such as major depression. 
</P>
<P>
Although some doctors say the trauma of giving birth triggers previous mental 
disorders, others contend it is a separate illness that stems from hormonal 
changes caused by the birth process. 
</P>
<P>
Altshuler, who trained at the National Institute of Mental Health, said many 
women fear entering a hospital lest it interrupt their bonding with their 
child. But she said that one study found there was not much difference between 
children not separated from their mothers and those separated for a short 
period "as long as there are some other loving surrogates attending to the 
child." 
</P>
<P>
Psychiatrists say that some women suffering from postpartum depression kill 
themselves apparently so they don't harm their babies. 
</P>
<P>
In April of 1987, on her 23rd birthday, Sheryl Massip of Anaheim tried to throw 
her 6-week-old son, Michael, into oncoming traffic, but a car swerved and 
avoided the baby. Then Massip positioned the infant under the wheel of her 
Volvo, drove over him and put the body in a trash can. 
</P>
<P>
After a jury convicted her of second-degree murder, Orange County Superior 
Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald stunned the legal community by reducing the verdict 
to voluntary manslaughter and also acquitting Massip because of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
The state Supreme Court agreed last month to consider the prosecution's appeal 
of Fitzgerald's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
The Massip trial led psychologist Virginia Watford to start a support group for 
women suffering postpartum depression. Operated out of Mission Hospital 
Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, the group meets weekly and has 
included more than 100 women in the two years of its existence, Watford said.

MARTIN SCORSESE'S OBSESSION

So Martin Scorsese "is considered the most interesting and talented director in 
America, if not the world" ("The Passion of Martin Scorsese," by T.J. English, 
Sept. 23). 
</P>
<P>
Please correct me if I'm wrong, but the last time I looked, Woody Allen, 
Francis Ford Coppola and Stanley Kubrick are still making movies. 
</P>
<P>
And Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini, Akira Kurosawa and David Lean, while not 
as active as they once were, are still alive.

MARTIN SCORSESE'S OBSESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Scorsese says that at some point he "becomes" the film that he is making, 
he is not describing alienation, as the author asserts, but rather its opposite 
-- a communion in which the self merges with a higher realm, a kind of 
out-of-body experience traditionally associated with Catholic mystics who 
achieve union with God. 
</P>
<P>
This makes Akira Kurosawa's choice of Scorsese as Vincent van Gogh a 
particularly inspired one, since for both making art was an act of devotion as 
well as a spiritual experience. 
</P>
<P>
And how sad a sign of our times that passionate commitment seems so 
incomprehensible that it should be confused with alienation.

HEALTH: MY ACHING BACK; 
</P>
<P>
COMMON BACK PAIN IS ONE AFFLICTION THAT NEEDN'T NECESSARILY BE TAKEN LYING DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL S. WILKES MD and MIRIAM SHUCHMAN MD, Miriam Shuchman is a physician 
in the Clinical Scholars Program at UC San Francisco Medical Center. Michael S. 
Wilkes is a physician in the Clinical Scholars Program at the UCLA Medical 
Center. Their column appears monthly.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOMETIMES ALL IT TAKES is an untied shoelace. You bend over, and that's it -- a 
shooting pain makes straightening up impossible. Are you doomed to lie on the 
floor for three or four weeks? Not necessarily. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few years ago, most doctors would tell patients with back pain to lie 
absolutely flat on a firm surface for a couple of weeks and get up only for 
meals and to use the bathroom. Uncomplicated back pain, caused by inflammation 
of the muscles, is the most common kind of back ailment. Fortunately for those 
so afflicted (and the people who have to wait on them), the recommended 
treatment for this type of back pain has changed considerably. 
</P>
<P>
Recent studies indicate that three or four days of bed rest are just as 
effective as two to three weeks. And doctors today are likely to encourage 
people recovering from back injuries to stand and take several short walks each 
day to maintain muscle strength rather than just lie around. The most important 
thing is to avoid sitting, which adds substantial stress to an injured back, 
during and immediately following the period of rest. 
</P>
<P>
Back problems are seemingly ubiquitous -- more than 75% of Americans will 
injure their backs at least once. Expensive medical care (diagnostic tests, 
doctors' fees and surgery) coupled with the cost of time lost from work make 
back problems one of the most costly ailments in the nation; each year, 
Americans spend about $16 billion on their back troubles. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, most back injuries are not considered serious -- meaning that 
there is little chance of damage to nerves or other vital structures. People 
with back pain usually do not visit doctors; instead they treat their pain with 
over-the-counter remedies such as aspirin or other pain relievers and apply 
warm compresses to the sore area. According to Dr. Robert Swezy, author of 
"Good News for Bad Backs," such treatment is quite reasonable. "Most people 
will be out of pain and back in action within a month -- with or without 
medical treatment." 
</P>
<P>
There are times, however, when a person should see a doctor without delay. 
Uncomplicated back pain usually stays in one location. Pain that radiates into 
the legs or buttocks, numbness in the legs and disruption of bladder function 
are signals that nerves in the back may be at risk of sustaining permanent 
damage. Likewise, fever or chills, symptoms not usually associated with back 
injury, may signal a kidney infection that is causing the back pain. 
</P>
<P>
Mild pain that does not improve after several weeks may also indicate that it's 
time to turn to a doctor, who can utilize a host of tests and medications. 
X-rays and special scans are often used to diagnose different types of 
ailments. Muscle relaxants, tranquilizers and painkillers are old standbys, and 
recently, doctors have started offering other options. 
</P>
<P>
A new electric device called a TENS (transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation) 
unit is used with increasing frequency (although its effectiveness is 
questionable). This instrument is attached to the back with small pads. Wires 
leading to the pads deliver low-level electrical current to the injured area. 
Although many doctors and patients say TENS provides relief, a recent study 
found that it offered no more benefit than did a placebo. Of course, that 
doesn't mean it won't work for some people. 
</P>
<P>
Another alternative is chiropractic. Chiropractors are non-physicians trained 
in the physical manipulation and realignment of the spine. In the past, doctors 
have been quick to share stories about the ineffectiveness of chiropractors. 
But several recent studies have found that when chiropractic was compared to 
conventional medical treatment for uncomplicated back pain, the chiropractic 
treatment produced better results -- people had a greater relief of pain, a 
more rapid return to work and a smaller chance of reoccurrence over the 
following two years. 
</P>
<P>
When bed rest and medication or chiropractic treatment fail, the next step for 
many suffers has been referral to a surgeon. Annually, 200,000 people in the 
United States have back surgery. And although some serious conditions do 
require surgery, patients should consider this option with reservation. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy, a 38-year-old high school teacher, thought that surgery would end her 
back pain. For nearly five years, she had suffered from periods of pain so 
intense that she was forced to stay home from work. After treating her 
condition with drugs and rest, she could bear it no more. She visited a 
surgeon, who offered her an operation but neglected to tell her about the 
possible downside: Researchers have discovered that as many as 30% of those who 
undergo back surgery find no relief from the pain, and often it gets worse. 
"For many people," says Dr. Robert Debois, a physician and private health 
consultant, "back surgery is no panacea." 
</P>
<P>
Several months after Nancy's surgery, her pain returned, and this time little 
could be done; once the back has been operated on, scar tissue makes future 
surgery in the same area is exceedingly difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Debois stresses that, except for those with serious injury, people should 
consider surgery only as a last resort. "You have one shot for effective back 
surgery. If you use it for a mild disorder, then using it again, if the 
condition worsens, becomes far more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Nancy was finally sent to a chiropractor. After many weeks of therapy and 
numerous hours of exercise, she is playing tennis again, carefully. 
</P>
<P>
So when your home treatment has failed and your back hurts and you feel you 
should consult a physician, we suggest you see a general practitioner who is 
aware of the recent changes in back-pain treatment. If she or he concludes that 
a further workup is necessary, ask to be directed to a specialist who is also 
familiar with current research. And if the advice is for surgery, always 
consider obtaining a second opinion. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of research advances, back pain continues to plague us. The best we 
can do is to try to prevent it: Regularly stretch the back; lift with the legs, 
rather than the back, and keep yourself, and your back, in good physical shape.

THE RETURN OF SUNDERLAND-HEALE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ONE-OF-A-KIND hand-painted china, hand-painted and woodblock-printed fabrics, 
and woodcuts are manufactured by Lesley Sunderland and husband Jonathan Heale 
in their home in Wales. It is literally a cottage industry: Sunderland "bakes" 
paints on the luxurious cotton drapery fabrics in her AGA oven. 
</P>
<P>
Their wares are now on display -- and for sale -- at Wilder Place on Melrose in 
the first Sunderland-Heale show in four years. During that time, they worked 
almost exclusively decorating a private residence in England. 
</P>
<P>
Their china pieces, made from Wedgwood china but dishwasher-safe, include tea 
sets, jugs, coffeepots and bowls. Prices run about $70 for a soup bowl, $200 
for a coffee pot. The fabrics, sold by the yard for $375 to $400, are described 
as Fortuny-like, neo-baroque or contemporary Renaissance. Some fabrics are 
first "streaked" with paint, giving them an antique look, then block-printed 
with abstract or floral designs and finally embellished with gold. Other 
fabrics depict trees or animals. All of them would look right at home draping 
majestic beds in castles -- or framing great Southern California views. "Their 
stuff is very special," says Wilder Place owner Jo Wilder. "They don't follow 
trends."

MOOD OF TROOPS TURNS GRIM IN GULF WAR TALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A grim new mood swept across this kingdom's eastern desert Saturday as echoes 
of resurgent war talk reached U.S. encampments and soldiers came to grips with 
the realization that their fates are now tied firmly to the outcome of the 
Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
With massive American reinforcements on the way and planned troop rotations 
postponed indefinitely, top commanders cast ambiguity aside and, on the 215th 
birthday of the Marine Corps, spoke bluntly about a possible U.S.-led attack 
against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The sobering words about new offensive options and warnings of an uncertain 
future had the sound of a call to arms in the starkly martial celebrations held 
at dusty desert compounds where thousands of Marines are encamped. 
</P>
<P>
"More than ever before," warned Maj. Gen. Robert M. Johnston, chief of staff 
for the U.S. Central Command, as assembled troops stood at rapt attention, "the 
prospect of offensive combat is going to be the greatest challenge that Marines 
have seen in many decades." 
</P>
<P>
"Strong signals are being sent," said Brig. Gen. Thomas B. Draude, assistant 
commander of Marine ground forces here, adding, in obvious understatement: 
"Things are a little different than they were a week or so ago." 
</P>
<P>
The two commanders addressed the troops as word began to circulate that 
President Bush had authorized the deployment of more than 200,000 U.S. military 
personnel over the next two months or so to join the 238,000 already assigned 
to the Persian Gulf area. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Marines here, scattered disclosures of the new developments generated 
less outright complaining than stoic reflection about the implications of being 
deployed for the duration when the prospect of war seems to be increasing. 
</P>
<P>
Shown a copy of a newspaper story about the canceled rotations, 19-year-old 
Lance Cpl. Brad Olmstead of Spokane, Wash., sat purse-lipped for a moment in 
the back of a bouncing, five-ton truck. 
</P>
<P>
Then, he slung his arm around the shoulder of 23-year-old Lance Cpl. Richard 
Dobbs, a fellow sentry from the headquarters of the Camp Pendleton-based 1st 
Marine Division. "Buddy," he said, "we're here to stay." 
</P>
<P>
Members of a congressional delegation who met with troops in Saudi Arabia on 
Saturday told reporters afterward that an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait would no 
longer be considered sufficient to end the gulf standoff. 
</P>
<P>
Reps. John P. Murtha (D-Pa.) and Stephen J. Solarz (D-N.Y.) said many members 
of Congress are now convinced that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's arsenal of 
chemical weapons and potential capability to produce nuclear arms must be 
eliminated as part of any resolution. 
</P>
<P>
"If he moves out of Kuwait unilaterally, we are also going to insist, the 
Congress will insist, that he not have this ability and that we be able to 
verify it," said Murtha, chairman of the House Defense Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The expanded U.S. deployment, which includes hundreds of tanks and three 
aircraft carrier groups, will provide the additional force that commanders have 
said they would need to launch a possible military offensive to drive Hussein's 
forces out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the massive buildup, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has said that 
previous plans to begin rotating troops out of the gulf will be put off 
indefinitely so that the U.S. force can be increased to peak levels. 
</P>
<P>
In helicopter shuttles to half a dozen Marine units Saturday, it was evident 
that few troops had more than sketchy information about either the magnitude of 
the planned reinforcements or the cancellation of troop rotations. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that such details were bound to have an even further "sobering 
effect," Brig. Gen. Mike Myatt, commander of Marine ground forces, said he 
planned to brief field commanders today on the news that their troops will be 
kept in place indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be tough on the Marines," predicted Col. John. H. Admire, the commanding 
officer of the 3rd Marine Regiment, who said his troops had been counting on 
rotation after six to eight months of service. 
</P>
<P>
Some Marines, told of the no-rotation policy, responded with stares of 
disbelief, reflecting the degree to which many had begun to look forward to 
some springtime relief. 
</P>
<P>
Others, who gathered in small clusters to learn more news from reporters after 
the ceremonial cutting of Marine Corps cake, complained of more children's 
birthdays missed, anniversaries celebrated by long-distance, even discharges 
delayed. 
</P>
<P>
But from combat troops who for months have urged that they be permitted to "get 
it over with and get out," the news also prompted hope that the abandonment of 
rotations means that the United States is not prepared to wait forever. 
</P>
<P>
"If they say we're going to be here till it's over, that means something's 
going to be happening pretty soon," said Sgt. Perry Cooke, of Brooklyn, N.Y., 
whose enlistment was due to run out next month. 
</P>
<P>
Even largely cut off from the news, however, Marines said that in recent days 
they had begun to sense, as one lance corporal put it, "that things were 
beginning to go down." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, some officers said, the extraordinary bluntness of the 
remarks from Johnston, the top deputy to Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the 
theater commander in chief, appear to leave little doubt that something 
significant has changed. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Gary Luck, commander of the Army's 18th Airborne Corps, used similarly 
strong language in a separate appearance, scorning Iraq's refusal to back down 
in the face of superior U.S. force. 
</P>
<P>
"(Saddam) Hussein is the one who should be uncomfortable," Luck said. "Either 
his ego is too big or he's dumber than a stump not to understand his 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Until last week, military officials stuck closely to ground rules permitting 
discussion only of defensive scenarios, noting that the declared mission of the 
United States remained the defense of Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
But now that the President himself has lifted the barrier to discussion of 
offensive operations, Johnston said in an interview that ground training for 
U.S. forces could receive new emphasis on attack-oriented tasks. 
</P>
<P>
And in contrast to the ambiguities in which top American generals tended in the 
past to talk about a U.S. offensive, the two-star general painted a vivid 
picture of a war that could lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"We may indeed have to concern ourselves with an offensive option," Johnston 
said. "We've got to make sure that if that decision is made and we go into 
combat, that once again we are able to measure up to the great expectations 
that people have for the Corps." 
</P>
<P>
Johnston said he and other Marines who fought in Vietnam "can say with 
confidence that we know how we'll respond under fire." But, he added, "I can 
tell you that this is going to be a completely different battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
"In Vietnam, we didn't exactly face 5,000 tanks," the general said, observing 
also that Iraq has access to advanced technologies. "It's going to be a new 
ballgame. . . . It's going to require boldness and daring and initiative and 
speed." 
</P>
<P>
The celebration of the Marine birthday included the presentation of cakes 
adorned with reminders of past Marine battles, notably the World War II clashes 
in the Pacific at Wake Island, Tarawa and Iwo Jima. 
</P>
<P>
In their remarks, the generals urged Marines to remember the standard that 
their predecessors had set and to regard themselves as privileged to open a new 
chapter in a record that the division chaplain described as "from the halls of 
Montezuma to the sands of Saudi Arabia." 
</P>
<P>
"Like tens of thousands of other Marines," said Lt. Gen. Walter E. Boomer, 
commander of all Marine forces here, in a further evocation of the 
tough-talking new message, "you celebrate your birthday preparing for battle."

WAR DRUM MUFFLED IN HEARTLAND; 
</P>
<P>
SPRINGFIELD, OHIO, OFFERS A MIDDLE AMERICAN VIEW OF THE GULF CRISIS. PATRIOTISM 
RUNS DEEP, BUT KNOWLEDGE IS SHALLOW. SOME APOLOGIZE FOR THEIR INATTENTION.

SPRINGFIELD, Ohio 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
America has spent the past 15 weeks on the precipice of war in the Persian 
Gulf, but for most people in this heartland city, the bugles have sounded with 
no more intensity than Muzak. 
</P>
<P>
Scratch the surface of opinions and beneath the yeses and noes are often layers 
of froth -- confusion about who's who in the distant Middle East and 
uncertainty as to why Uncle Sam has put 240,000 GIs in the desert sand, with 
more to come. 
</P>
<P>
By and large, people do back the deployment, but this is done almost in 
patriotic reflex, more in support of the heat-besieged soldiers than any 
clearly understood principle. Urgent debate, whether in auditoriums or at 
dinner tables, seems to await the start of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
If fighting begins, protracted combat might well reopen in Springfield -- and 
thousands of cities like it -- pro- and anti-war fissures closed now for almost 
a generation. But until then, the call to arms seems too much like maneuvers to 
provoke any devouring passions. 
</P>
<P>
"It does my heart good to see people getting behind the troops, but at the 
beginning it was like that with Vietnam, too," said Jerry Heck, 48, commander 
of the county's veterans council. "When the body bags start coming home, 
that'll be the big test. That's the wake-up call." 
</P>
<P>
Springfield is as good a place as any to check the American pulse. A city of 
70,400 where the Mad River meets Buck Creek, it grew from a bustling prairie 
oasis in the early 19th Century into a hearty factory town, with huge red-brick 
buildings at its center. 
</P>
<P>
Streets are wide, and sidewalks are shady. The rich live on the north end, near 
the country club and in the lavish homes of Signal Hill. Toward the south side, 
the houses are more often wood than brick, owned by blue-collar workers who too 
well know that the industrial frontier has moved away. 
</P>
<P>
War sluices through the city's common memory. Citizens recall that, during 
World War II, Wren's Department Store planted a victory garden in its display 
window on Main Street. Springfield lost 55 of its men in Vietnam. Each year, 
the Memorial Day parade takes 2 1/2 hours to pass the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans slightly outnumber Democrats, not that politics has played much 
part in how anyone thinks about the Middle East. The congressional candidates 
rarely spoke of the crisis these last weeks, what with taxes to hammer at. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers and preachers do discuss it, though not in a probing way. They remind 
people to write letters to the boys overseas and send them cookies and 
magazines and Godspeed. It seems only right. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine being a soldier over there," said Mike Bartee, an engineer. "That 
fellow Saddam Hussein is insane. If one morning he wakes up and goes spastic, 
we'll lose a lot of lives." 
</P>
<P>
Scores of interviews in and around Springfield show a general awareness that 
America has squared off for a major bloodletting, but knowledge of the conflict 
and its roots are shallow as a puddle. 
</P>
<P>
Is it Iraq or Iran that is the main bad guy? several people asked. Who owns the 
oil over there, anyhow, America or the Arabs? How do you pronounce 
what's-his-name's name, the jerk who is the new Hitler? 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I haven't paid much attention to it, except for the gas prices," said 
forklift operator David Marshall, 23, in a typical comment. "You know, I drive 
a Lincoln, a big car, so what's going on really hurts me." 
</P>
<P>
Of those who keep up with the news, there are a few general themes to their 
thinking: 
</P>
<P>
* People want the crisis to end quickly. Whatever the outcome, there can only 
be more trouble by letting it drag on. Just look at what it already means for 
the price at the pump. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish we'd do something and get it over with," said Dieter Pryor, 36 and 
unemployed. "We can't let the Arabs just sit on the oil instead of selling it. 
They want too much money for it, and that's outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
* Pressed to propose a swift solution, most people grow perplexed. They do not 
want the Iraqi aggression to stand, but they also do not want to attack or to 
withdraw or to give the embargo a great deal more time. 
</P>
<P>
In frustration, many finally say there must be some way to "talk this over" or 
"buy our way out." Assassination is also a popular notion. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to kill off (Iraq's) whole population, just Hussein," said Janice 
Sharpe, a student at the community college. "We ought to send in the CIA and 
just pick this guy right off. P-choo." 
</P>
<P>
* While most are reticent to unleash the bombers, there is a large minority 
that does favor an ultimatum and a deadline. If terms go unmet, then blast 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"And I don't mean a surgical strike," said Ted Wallace, 58, of the county's 
veterans services commission. "Hit them with all we've got, then return, 
reload, refuel and hit them again. Kick their fannies." 
</P>
<P>
* Most assume that America would win, but they also fear a "repeat of Vietnam." 
This takes on several meanings: Don't get bogged down in a long conflict; don't 
fight unless we go all out for victory; don't let our soldiers feel they lack 
support back home. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's not turn this into another war where we're fighting the whole world's 
battles," said Linda Clift, 31, a hospital worker. "This time, we need to 
arrange to have Japan and Britain and France in there with us. I mean, c'mon. 
It's their oil too." 
</P>
<P>
* Some express a cultural superiority to Arabs, describing them as 
tent-dwellers with a weird religion. A few freely use expressions such as 
"A-rabs" and "camel jockeys" and one man joked that we ought to bomb them with 
pork fat. 
</P>
<P>
This scorn, on one hand, makes the idea of war more tolerable. On the other, it 
causes apprehension: Iraqis may be tough to beat because they do not share 
Americans' reverence for life, people said. Arabs would attack in waves. 
</P>
<P>
"Arabs don't care about dying because they become martyrs, you know, off to 
whatever happy hunting ground it is they go to," said a man named Jim, who 
withheld his last name. 
</P>
<P>
Some people apologize for their inattention to such a big international crisis. 
Yes, it is important, they agree. But with so many problems in life it is hard 
to spare the time. Like it or not, you have to trust the politicians to make 
decisions. That is why they are elected. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, there are exceptions. Some people avidly stalk the headlines. 
They get most of the names right -- and have facts to lace across replies. 
</P>
<P>
Their views go in all directions -- and perhaps this is a portent of days ahead 
should the desert become a battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Parents 
</P>
<P>
For the Kinnisons, Mel and Marilyn, this is a prideful, if scary, time. The 
second oldest of their four children is over there in the gulf, the boy they 
named Alan Scott after the two astronauts, Alan B. Shepard and Scott Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever George Bush decides to do is OK with Mel, though he would just as soon 
the President give the go-ahead. "I think so much of our military I believe we 
could go in at breakfast and be out of there a winner by lunch," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Thank God for the United States, he said. "Saddam Hussein is another Hitler who 
wants to take over. He was heading into Saudi Arabia. Someone had to stop him 
and that someone was us." 
</P>
<P>
Mel sells cameras at the mall and considers himself an ordinary, God-fearing 
man. Sure, the Commandments say thou shalt not kill. "But if killing is what it 
takes, then I'm sorry, that's what it takes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn, a schoolteacher, is really the family's Bible scholar. She believes 
this is part of the prophesied approach of Armageddon. The sequence has begun 
toward the End of the Age and the Second Coming of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
It is to be expected that some events will be ghastly. Did you hear that the 
Iraqi soldiers were ordered to kill Kuwaiti babies? she asked. "Their soldiers 
apparently don't have much in the way of morals." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe there is another way to stop that madman Saddam Hussein. "Why not just 
assassinate him, clean and simple?" she told Mel. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, Marilyn, you just can't do that," he answered. "For one thing, we'd never 
get within 10,000 feet of him." 
</P>
<P>
"They killed President Kennedy, and he was an American. You mean to say Saddam 
has better protection than an American President?" 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I don't know. He's sort of in hiding. He just doesn't go riding through 
the streets, you know." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Minister 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. John Waite is ordained in the Church of the Brethren and he used to 
have what he called a "justice ministry" until his funding ran out. Now he is 
not so much the gadfly against racism and poverty and this and that. 
</P>
<P>
Sending U.S. troops to the gulf bothered him, but what could he do? Then a few 
weeks ago, at a high school football game, something hard to ignore happened. 
His daughter plays in the band. At halftime, it honored parents of local 
servicemen in the Middle East. Rifle shots, ribbons, the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
Waite did not begrudge the parents their moment, but all this rah-rah stuff was 
too simplistic for him. Was anyone bothering to explain that neither Kuwait nor 
Saudi Arabia are democracies? he asked. Was anyone reminding America of the 
obvious, that oil is not worth the price of young lives? 
</P>
<P>
At the next home game, Waite handed out anti-war leaflets, standing right 
beside the man selling programs. He felt "like an ass, stuck out there like a 
big red sore thumb, making a spectacle of myself." Even his wife, sympathetic 
enough to his ideas, asked: "Is this the proper place?" 
</P>
<P>
But what place would be proper? "Americans don't know their history. What do 
they read? What do they listen to? Where do they get their information? They 
get it off TV, and TV is dependent on what the State Department wants to tell 
us. Someone has to do some thinking of their own." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Mom 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Blevins read the leaflet when she got home. Oh heavens, she thought, 
things are so complicated it just tears you up. No, she can't believe we're in 
the gulf just for the oil. We're there to stop Iraq from taking over the 
smaller countries. Somebody has to protect the weak from the strong. 
</P>
<P>
But why did the Navy have to send her boy, Jason, who is only 19 and could 
never kill anyone? His ship is over there, near Kuwait and Bahrain. Who has 
ever heard of these places? She had to buy a map and tack it up on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Killing is wrong, she said. She recalls when a Marine recruiter wanted her to 
sign the papers to enlist Jason. She told him: "I'll sign when you promise to 
build a base right in that soybean field across the street and guarantee no one 
will ever shoot at my son and he'll never shoot at anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
After Jason was graduated from high school, he got some construction work, 
which he'd probably still have if the contract hadn't run out. Then his car 
conked out on him. He couldn't pay rent for his apartment. Joining the Navy 
seemed to solve all his problems with one quick signature. 
</P>
<P>
Now his life is in danger. On Oct. 30, when the clock radio woke Joyce Blevins, 
she drowsily heard the announcer say something about an explosion on the Iwo 
Jima. That's Jason's ship! But she wasn't sure what he had said. 
</P>
<P>
Had it all been a bad dream? She was in a daze. She made her other children 
breakfast and tried to calm down. Then out the window she saw her mother 
running up the walk, crying. Oh no, it was true. The Iwo Jima had exploded. 
</P>
<P>
Her mom said there was an 800-number to call, and the military told her not to 
worry -- they had no names yet but not that many had been killed and the dead 
were all in the boiler room. 
</P>
<P>
But that is where Jason works! She wept. The phone rang again and again. Her 
husband came home from work. The house filled with friends. People from the 
church started a prayer vigil. 
</P>
<P>
Then the phone rang one more time. It was Jason, and he was safe. Mom, he said, 
I had to carry some of my buddies from that boiler room. They were dead and all 
burned up. It was awful. 
</P>
<P>
And Joyce Blevins decided: "Whatever it takes, a dishonorable discharge, 
shooting off his toe, whatever. I want my son home." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Chamber President 
</P>
<P>
This crisis is really dragging on, isn't it? asked Larry Krukewitt, president 
of the Chamber of Commerce. No question, America was right to send troops. "We 
can't succumb to paper tigers," he said. "There was a period of time when the 
whole world was walking all over us, and that's done with." 
</P>
<P>
But he wonders how long the stalemate can go on. It's so nerve-racking. He 
can't figure out what George Bush is up to. He keeps sending more troops, and 
that's beginning to remind him of Vietnam, "you know, when they kept asking for 
another 50,000 men and saying that would turn the tide." 
</P>
<P>
Krukewitt wishes the Administration was more forthcoming, explaining the 
upside, the downside, all the options. "The American people are pretty savvy. 
Explain something to them, they'll stand up for it." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, we can't be expected to do more than our fair share. If this is 
aggression against the world community, then where is the rest of the world? 
"Their support is nice, but where are their troops? This has got to be a 
worldwide fighting force, not just Americans." 
</P>
<P>
The Dad 
</P>
<P>
Almost half a century ago, Bob Saunter himself was a soldier. World War II 
taught him how to follow orders. It is OK to question your superiors, but after 
that you do what they say. That's the military way. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Korea and Vietnam, and Saunter had trouble understanding these 
"police actions." Vietnam is still confounding to him. It dragged on without 
America ever really knowing whether to come or go. 
</P>
<P>
Now there is this situation in the gulf. Saunter's son, Eric, is there. The 
young man is 24 and an Army machinist, but his dad can still picture him in the 
garage, a teen-ager tinkering with his motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose we're over there either to make the world safe for democracy or to 
protect our oil," said Saunter, 66, who is director of the county library. "I'd 
rather it be the former, but as a realist I think maybe it's the oil." 
</P>
<P>
He has trouble imagining his son in the desert. The Middle East is so 
inscrutable, anyway. Americans don't understand the Arab mind, he said. "A huge 
loss of life would not be as meaningful for them as us." 
</P>
<P>
This frightens him. Saunter knows how badly he'd feel if his only son was 
killed, "especially if it was solely for the price of oil. I guess the words 
'lost cause' come to mind -- or even a word like 'waste.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Eric chose this, the father reminds himself. He joined the Army. "And if 
they send you somewhere, you go," he said. "You do what you're told." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Union Leader 
</P>
<P>
Don't be silly, said Tim Marshall, head of Local 658, United Auto Workers. 
Anyone who thinks we're in the gulf for anything but the oil is in dreamland. 
"You think if they were growing grapes over there, we'd care what happens?" 
</P>
<P>
The name of the game is money. Wait until this is over. The oil companies will 
be rich, and so will a lot of defense contractors, he said. "How can we trust 
those defense contractors after seeing how they steal?" 
</P>
<P>
It's sad too. "America is just an old dinosaur warrior state while the rest of 
the world is tired of fighting. Even the Berlin Wall is down." 
</P>
<P>
Don't overlook the possibility this is all a trick, he warned. While people are 
thinking about the Middle East, they're not paying attention to all the 
political scandals, like the S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth will never come out; it never does," Marshall said. "But think about 
it. We condemn Hussein for doing the same darn things we did in our own 
hemisphere, with Grenada and Panama." 
</P>
<P>
He suggested everyone watch the movie "Lawrence of Arabia." "It tells you how 
all the problems over there were started by the European commonwealths. . . . 
It's all for money, and some people are going to get rich off this thing, too. 
Wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Vets 
</P>
<P>
The two men had both seen plenty they would like to forget in Vietnam. As is 
their custom, they were drinking at the Union Club downtown, a dark smoky hall 
where beers are 75 cents a pop. Empty Budweiser cans become makeshift ashtrays 
on the tables. 
</P>
<P>
The conversation turned to the gulf, much on the mind of John Sturgell, 43, an 
assembler for the phone company and a member of the National Guard. He has been 
told that his unit is likely to be called up soon. 
</P>
<P>
"We ought to attack with all we've got," Sturgell said. "Blow up every damn 
thing, except the oil fields." 
</P>
<P>
He and Dean Gaddis, 43, a lineman with Ohio Edison, had not talked this over 
before, though Gaddis had been waiting for it. "Did you know that Kuwait used 
to be part of Iraq?" he asked. "Maybe we ought to talk with Saddam Hussein. 
Maybe he's got something to say." 
</P>
<P>
"T-a-a-a-l-k!" Sturgell said. "You don't talk to a man like Saddam Hussein. You 
kill him." 
</P>
<P>
"How do you know what he's like? Saddam Hussein has his beliefs just like 
you've got your beliefs. Who are you to say he's wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
"All I know is I'm an American and I'm free." 
</P>
<P>
"You just know what the media tells you." 
</P>
<P>
For a few seconds, Sturgell seemed hurt by that. 
</P>
<P>
"Dean," he said finally, "you mean you're not going to be there to say goodby 
to me if I have to go." 
</P>
<P>
Gaddis smiled. The debate was over. "You know I'll be there," he assured him. 
"And I'm bringing you a six-pack."

COALITION ON IRAQ FIRM, BAKER SAYS;

GULF CRISIS: THE SECRETARY OF STATE WINDS UP A WEEKLONG TRIP THROUGH THE 
MIDEAST AND EUROPE AND SAYS PRESIDENT BUSH MAY TAKE ADDITIONAL STEPS TO PREPARE 
FOR POSSIBLE MILITARY ACTION.

<P>
Winding up a weeklong trip through the Middle East and Europe, Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III said Saturday that the international coalition against 
Iraq is firm despite disagreements among its members about how long to wait 
before resorting to the use of force. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said President Bush, who will meet with many of the same leaders next 
week, will take up where he left off in laying the foundation for military 
action if economic and political steps do not force Iraq to end its occupation 
of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a process that we are engaged in," Baker said. "There remain . . . 
some things that need to be done to complete laying this foundation -- 
politically, militarily and even economically. There are things that will have 
to be accomplished during the President's trip." 
</P>
<P>
Bush is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia on Thanksgiving Day for dinner with 
U.S. troops. He is also expected to confer with officials of the Saudi kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
Also next week, the President will meet in Paris with Soviet President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev and a number of European leaders during the summit meeting of the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
As he was flying to Bahrain at the start of his seven-nation trip, Baker said 
he wanted to find out if other members of the international coalition would be 
willing to fight if the confrontation escalates into an offensive war intended 
to drive Iraqi soldiers out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
In summing up his talks, however, Baker softened his objectives. He said his 
primary purpose was to avoid cracks in the coalition and to prove to Iraqi 
dictator Saddam Hussein that divide-and-defeat tactics will not work. 
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that from Washington's viewpoint, it is better to maintain 
unity -- even at a lowest-common-denominator level -- than to push too fast for 
measures that some allied countries are reluctant to take. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to make all of our options credible if we are to succeed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not intended that each and every one of these stops be a 
decision-making session. I am very pleased with the progress that we have made 
overall during this trip." 
</P>
<P>
However, the extent of the commitment of France, Baker's last stop, remained 
unclear Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before Baker's departure for Paris on Friday, a senior Bush 
Administration official said that the United States did not yet know if French 
troops would join an offensive if it comes to that. The official said Baker 
would try to find out in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Asked at his news conference Saturday after meetings with President Francois 
Mitterrand and Foreign Affairs Minister Roland Dumas if he now knows France's 
intentions, Baker replied, "I think we do know now." 
</P>
<P>
He refused to say, however, which way the issue was resolved. But he said his 
meetings in France were "very productive." 
</P>
<P>
Baker said he is confident that French forces deployed in Saudi Arabia and the 
Persian Gulf are militarily ready to fight. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether there will be a resort to the use of force will require decisions at 
the highest political levels," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Baker also insisted that the coalition of 50 or so countries that have 
contributed troops or money or both is in firm agreement that Iraq must 
withdraw from Kuwait with nothing to show for its aggression. But, he conceded, 
there are disagreements about timing and methods. 
</P>
<P>
"There are differing opinions as to how long it would take for sanctions to 
work," he said. "There are even differences of opinion as to how much the 
sanctions are already working." He was referring to the trade sanctions that 
the U.N. Security Council imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Although Baker refused to comment on possible time schedules, military experts, 
both in and outside of the government, have said it will take at least two 
months for U.S. troop reinforcements, announced by the President last week, to 
reach the gulf and make preparations for an offensive. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Baker said, the United States will not try to discourage other 
countries from seeking a peaceful way out of the crisis, even if that effort 
involves sending special envoys to Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
But he said Washington would object strongly to any nation offering Hussein a 
deal that he could consider even a partial victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We do discourage . . . partial solutions," Baker said. He added that the 
United States objects to foreign dignitaries who "permit themselves to be used 
for shameful purposes." 
</P>
<P>
Although he cited no names, Baker apparently was referring to former West 
German Chancellor Willy Brandt and former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro 
Nakasone who have sought, and obtained, the release of some foreign hostages by 
visiting Hussein and giving him a chance for a propaganda bonanza. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said the Persian Gulf crisis is now in a new phase "in which we must 
heighten the pressure further (and) . . . lay the foundation for the use of 
force should that become necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"One way to do that is, clearly, to get ready militarily," he said.

THOUSAND OAKS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fire that surged through a vast, half-completed luxury apartment complex in 
Thousand Oaks gutted 330 apartments as firefighters, struggling with virtually 
empty fire hydrants, worked to bring it under control late Saturday, fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire that razed 22 of the 36 buildings at The Knolls was started by a 
plumber's soldering tool, Ventura County Fire Department officials said. The 
damage to the $40-million project was set at $7 million, according to Regis 
Homes Corp., partner and co-owner of the project. 
</P>
<P>
A Ventura County fire captain was hospitalized for heat exhaustion and smoke 
inhalation, and a Los Angeles city firefighter was treated at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 firefighters, summoned from 30 companies across Ventura and Los 
Angeles counties, labored against dust-dry 25-m.p.h. winds that sent flames 
veering capriciously over the rooftops of the unfinished, 540-unit 
Mediterranean-style complex. 
</P>
<P>
Their efforts were hampered as well by fire hydrants that were either 
unreachable -- ringed with fire that leaped from street to street within the 
heart of the complex -- or merely dribbling out water at low pressure, Ventura 
County fire spokesman John Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
"The fire forced them back away from the others (hydrants)," said Wade, and 
when they were at last able to move back in, "some hydrants were dry." 
</P>
<P>
When the nearby hydrants failed, firefighters set up a modern-day bucket 
brigade, a "relay" of five or six firetrucks, linked up to pump water from 
hydrants in a housing complex more than a quarter-mile from the fire. 
Helicopters were called to ferry in water to supplement the supply. 
</P>
<P>
Water mains within The Knolls were apparently either broken or shut off, Fire 
Engineer Karry Ellison said. Fire officials will investigate whether the mains 
were broken or had been shut off while plumbing work was being done, Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
Three times Capt. Keith Mashburn's crew set up and laid out lines, he said, and 
three times they packed it all up and moved because water pressure was so poor. 
</P>
<P>
As fire raced through the open-beam unfinished construction, engines at one 
point had to roll back from the searing intensity. One engine was badly 
damaged, and on Mashburn's own engine, the taillights were melted into red 
lumps by the heat. 
</P>
<P>
Several hours after the 2:52 p.m. call, firefighters had gained the upper hand, 
in part thanks to a natural fire break -- the wide main street leading into the 
complex, which was to have been ready for its first tenants by the end of the 
month. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze that hurtled through the lavish complex, outfitted with tennis 
courts, spas and pools, began when a plumbing contractor doing silver soldering 
on the first floor of one apartment building inadvertently set the wire 
smoldering, Wade said. Unbeknown to him, it spread up through the wire to the 
second floor, where the blaze began in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
"He was on the first floor," said Wade. "He did not even realize that the fire 
had made a run to the second floor." Once he did, the plumber told a security 
guard, who telephoned the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
About a mile away, floating sparks from the main fire set off two small brush 
fires, but they were quickly put out by firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the roof tiles that sometimes protect houses from leaping flames 
had not yet been installed on all roofs of the project, and stacks of tiles sat 
waiting on the burning roof of one building. 
</P>
<P>
At one point officials thought they might have to evacuate a home for cerebral 
palsy patients about two miles north of the fire, but did not. Sheriff's 
deputies did roll through a nearby neighborhood, knocking on doors or 
admonishing residents by bullhorn to be ready to clear out if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"I put all my photo albums in the car," said Rosalie Mastrolonardo, whose 
neighbors also loaded up their cars and waited for the evacuation order that 
never came. 
</P>
<P>
Dianna Riddle, a nursing student, said that after deputies came through three 
times, she filled the car with the family's pet Yorkshire terrier, some photos 
and earthquake supply kits, and "hundreds of dollars" in new nursing-school 
books and uniforms. As she drove, many of her neighbors were placidly watching 
the smoke from the fire, their children skateboarding idly down the street. 
They were still there when she returned about 90 minutes later, the danger 
past. 
</P>
<P>
Along the rims of nearby hillsides, dozens of people came out to stand and 
watch the spectacle of embers and smoke, to the annoyance of firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
The development has been at the heart of four years of contention between the 
owner-developer, Lang Ranch, and a homeowners group that argued that Thousand 
Oaks violated its own growth-control ordinance in approving the plan that would 
ultimately build more than 2,200 residences, including The Knolls. 
</P>
<P>
The group contended it would create traffic and air-quality problems.

Fire surged through at least 21 buildings of finished and half-built luxury 
apartments in Thousand Oaks Saturday afternoon, straining water supplies before 
firefighters brought the flames under control. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the dust-dry 25-m.p.h. winds and hydrants sealed off from firefighters 
by a ring of flames, the blaze at The Knolls was under control just two hours 
after firefighters arrived shortly before 3 p.m. About 30 engine and hand crews 
from Ventura and Los Angeles counties fire departments turned out to fight the 
blaze. 
</P>
<P>
Two helicopters ferried in water to supplement a meager supply flowing from the 
only two accessible fire hydrants. Fire, accelerated by bursts of hot, dry 
wind, swept through the open-beam unfinished construction, at one point forcing 
engines back from the searing intensity. 
</P>
<P>
Two firefighters suffered minor injuries, and one of them was hospitalized for 
smoke inhalation, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze destroyed 238 apartments as it hurtled through a portion of the 
lavish 540-unit complex -- designed with tennis courts, spas and pools and 
scheduled for its first occupants at the end of the month -- after a workman 
accidentally set some piping wire afire, said Ventura County fire spokesman 
John Wade. 
</P>
<P>
A plumbing contractor doing silver soldering on the first floor of one 
apartment inadvertently set the wire smoldering and, unknown to him, the spark 
spread through the wire to the second floor, where the blaze began in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
"He was on the first floor," Wade said. "He did not even realize that the fire 
had made a run to the second floor." The workman alerted a security guard, who 
telephoned the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the roofing tiles that sometimes ward off leaping flames had not 
yet been installed on some roofs of the building project, and stacks of them 
sat waiting on the burning roof of one townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
A damage estimate was not available. 
</P>
<P>
A few residents living in established neighborhoods within a few hundred yards 
of the complex said sheriff's deputies at one point told them to evacuate, but 
the fire was in hand before many people began to do so. Officials briefly 
thought they might have to evacuate a home for cerebral palsy patients, about 
two miles north of the fire and behind some hills, but did not. 
</P>
<P>
Along the rims of nearby hillsides, dozens of residents of adjacent 
neighborhoods stood watching the spectacle of embers and smoke, to the 
annoyance of firefighters. Sheriff's deputies yelled a warning at gawkers 
parked and standing in a nearby intersection. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks from the enormous blaze leaped ahead into a patch of brush about a mile 
away, and other firefighters worked to keep that separate fire in hand, Denise 
Oblinger, a Ventura County Fire Department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
At The Knolls' office near some finished apartments, workers evacuated 
themselves and their equipment, "as much as we can," said one woman carrying a 
computer printer to her car.

93 IN L.A. -- A REPLAY OF SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Surfers sweated as they waited for sets of waves to roll into the beach breaks 
of Orange County. Children played flag football for hours in Los Angeles city 
parks. Municipal pools saw swimmers in numbers akin to the days of summer. 
</P>
<P>
Scenes such as these dotted the Southland on Saturday -- less than two weeks 
before Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
The hottest spot in the nation was El Toro in Orange County, at 99 degrees, 
while the Los Angeles Civic Center reported 93 degrees, tying the record set 
for the date in 1956. Los Angeles International Airport also recorded a high of 
93 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
High temperatures in other cities included: Long Beach, 96; San Juan 
Capistrano, 97; Montebello, 92; Torrance, 92, and Woodland Hills, 91. The 
relative humidity ranged from 13% to 42%. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Californians enjoying the heat had offshore winds to thank for the 
record temperatures, said Steve Burback, a meteorologist at WeatherData Inc., 
which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The heat was caused by light but persistent winds that kept cooler air several 
miles off the coast, Burback said. Without the marine cover, temperatures 
became unseasonably warm, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At Rancho La Cienega Recreation Center in southwest Los Angeles, children were 
lined up waiting to get into the pool at its 2 p.m. opening time. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids turned out today," said Portia Morris, a clerk at the pool. "It was 
real dead last week when it was cold." 
</P>
<P>
Morris said about 55 children had visited the pool by late Saturday afternoon, 
with an hour still left for swimming. The week before, she said, about 
one-third the children used the pool. 
</P>
<P>
"Last week, they came bundled up in jackets and warm clothes," said Deven 
Bouchet, the weekend pool manager. "Today, they were in T-shirts and shorts, 
some of them carrying skateboards." 
</P>
<P>
In inland valleys, including Riverside and San Bernardino counties, 
temperatures were reported in the low- to mid-90s. Ontario recorded a high of 
94 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The heat is expected to last through the long holiday weekend, Burback said. 
"It should stay at least in the upper 80s today and on Monday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A storm front developing over the Gulf of Alaska may bring an end to the high 
temperatures, he said. Winds and cooler readings are expected by Tuesday, when 
temperatures are expected to reach the mid-70s, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In other sections of the United States, autumn has turned to winter. 
</P>
<P>
In upstate Maine, snow fell Saturday and temperatures plunged into the 20s as 
northerly winds whipped New England, Burback said. 
</P>
<P>
Maine residents, you have Southern California's sympathy.

APPEALS COURT UPHOLDS BAN ON NORIEGA TAPES; 
</P>
<P>
MEDIA: CNN HAS AIRED THE LEAKED PHONE-TAP CONVERSATIONS. THE GOVERNMENT ARGUED 
THE BROADCASTS COULD HINDER THE JURY SELECTION PROCESS.

<P>
A federal appeals court Saturday upheld an injunction barring Cable News 
Network from airing taped jailhouse conversations between Manuel A. Noriega and 
his defense team after the government claimed that the broadcasts will 
jeopardize the deposed Panamanian dictator's right to a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta-based network said it will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling by the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals came after the Justice 
Department filed a brief arguing that the broadcasts could hinder selection of 
an unbiased jury for Noriega's drug-trafficking trial. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the government argued that, because the tapes of Noriega's 
telephone conversations could divulge details of his defense strategy, his 
right to effective counsel could be compromised. 
</P>
<P>
"The government cannot at this point be more specific with respect to the 
possible harm that could flow from publication of the tapes because the 
government, like the district court, does not know the contents of the 
materials CNN has in its possession," the brief stated. 
</P>
<P>
In Miami, meanwhile, CNN asked U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler, who on 
Thursday had banned the playing of the tapes, to disqualify himself from 
hearing motions relating to the case. 
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler told CNN's attorneys Friday that it would be in contempt of court if 
it broadcast more tapes, but the network aired them anyway, arguing that 
Hoeveler's order amounted to unconstitutional prior restraint. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals panel in Atlanta called on the network to produce the tapes in 
Hoeveler's courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
"The 1st Amendment interests and public will best be served by immediate 
production of the tapes . . . so that the district court can conduct the 
difficult balancing of constitutional rights," the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's ruling heats up the battle between the network and the courts -- 
pitting CNN's concerns over its 1st Amendment rights against the Justice 
Department's efforts to convict Noriega, who is being held at the Metropolitan 
Correctional Center outside Miami. He has been there since shortly after he 
surrendered to U.S. troops who invaded Panama last December. 
</P>
<P>
"CNN has shackled the district court by refusing that court's reasonable 
request to review the audiotapes it has in its possession," the appeals court 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement after the ruling Saturday, Tom Johnson, CNN president, said that 
network attorneys "are reviewing the decision" and that CNN "will pursue an 
immediate appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court." 
</P>
<P>
In Miami, Hoeveler convened a special Saturday afternoon session of the 
district court to hear a motion by Noriega's attorney, Frank A. Rubino, that 
CNN be held in contempt for airing the telephone tapes. 
</P>
<P>
That hearing was quickly derailed, however, when CNN attorney Terry S. 
Bienstock asked Hoeveler to disqualify himself from hearing any matters related 
to CNN's broadcast of the Noriega tapes. He cited "personal bias and prejudice" 
based on "extra-judicial statements" Hoeveler made to reporters Friday. 
</P>
<P>
On his way out of the courthouse parking lot Friday, Hoeveler had indicated to 
a CNN reporter that he would find the network in contempt for airing more 
Noriega tapes in defiance of his orders. 
</P>
<P>
CNN's motion to dismiss Hoeveler from ruling on the tapes will be considered 
today or Monday by presiding U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King. 
</P>
<P>
The taped telephone conversations, in which Noriega and his defense team 
discussed two potential government witnesses and speculated on prosecution 
strategy, have fueled assertions that, although Noriega is jailed in America, 
he still has power in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
In Panama City, La Prensa, the city's largest newspaper, warned Saturday that 
Noriega's ability to make telephone calls is a sign that he could be plotting 
to overthrow the pro-American government of President Guillermo Endara.

Members of Congress visited U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia and told reporters 
afterward that Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait would not by itself end the 
Persian Gulf crisis. House Defense Committee Chairman John Murtha (D-Pa.) said 
Baghdad's ability to produce chemical and biological weapons must be destroyed 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
Either Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is "dumber than a stump" or "his ego is 
too big" to allow him to recognize the probability of defeat in a Persian Gulf 
shoot-out, U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Gary Luck told reporters in Saudi Arabia.

In Paris, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the United States and its

IRAQ, SENSING U.N. HESITANCY, ASSAILS BUILDUP

Moving to exploit signs of military hesitancy among the U.N. Security Council 
powers, Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz on Saturday condemned the planned new 
buildup of American forces in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"This (U.S.) announcement blasts the false justifications made by the United 
States and the rulers of Saudi Arabia and Egypt when American troops started to 
deploy in the region," the official Iraqi News Agency quoted Aziz as saying. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush announced last week that more than 200,000 U.S. troops will be 
dispatched to Saudi Arabia to join the 238,000 already there. The new 
deployment would make offensive operations against Iraq possible, military 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet, French and Chinese officials have sided with the United States and 
Britain -- the other permanent Security Council members -- on a U.S. call for a 
resolution giving advance approval for possible military action to drive Iraqi 
troops from Kuwait. But some have called for more time for a U.N.-imposed trade 
embargo to force a peaceful withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
Aziz's comments appeared to be directed at Chinese Foreign Minister Qian 
Qichen, who arrives in Baghdad today, the first high-level official of the 
Security Council powers to visit Iraq since the Aug. 2 invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Qian met Saturday with Jordanian leaders in Amman after talks in Cairo last 
week with Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak. 
</P>
<P>
"If the question (of the use of force) is to be put forward, it needs detailed 
discussion," the Chinese envoy told reporters in Amman after his talks with 
Mubarak. 
</P>
<P>
"Such a matter cannot be easily put to a vote," he said of the proposed U.N. 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing such concerns, Aziz told the Iraqi News Agency: 
</P>
<P>
"Those countries which are unwilling to contribute to the American aggressive 
plan are called upon to reconsider their position and withdraw their troops 
from the region." 
</P>
<P>
The United States, Britain, France and Egypt all have troops deployed in Saudi 
Arabia, and the Soviets have several warships in the area of the Arabian Sea, 
although they are not considered part of the Western deployment. No Chinese 
forces have joined the American-led buildup. 
</P>
<P>
While Britain has not wavered from the U.S. strategy of applying an increased 
military threat to the Iraqi troops in occupied Kuwait, France has appeared 
eager to give equal emphasis to peace efforts. 
</P>
<P>
A reporter for the Jordan Times on Saturday quoted Daniel Bernard, a French 
Foreign Ministry spokesman, when asked whether Paris would veto the U.N. 
resolution authorizing military force, as replying: "I have not said that. What 
I am saying is that (French President Francois Mitterrand) was clear in his 
statement in Cairo last week that sanctions have to be given time to work. . . 
. The time is not ripe." 
</P>
<P>
Baker was in Paris on Saturday, at the end of a seven-nation tour, to discuss 
the gulf crisis with Mitterrand. But Baker did not indicate France's stand on 
committing troops to any future offensive against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
In his statement to the news agency, Aziz complained: "The American secretary 
of state did not trouble himself to visit the area in search of a peaceful and 
just settlement to the Palestinian problem despite the passing of a large 
number of Security Council resolutions (on the issue)." 
</P>
<P>
"It is only when it concerns oil and . . . colonialist interests that American 
officials work day and night and travel from one capital to the other." 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis' rhetorical strategy has been to submerge their invasion of Kuwait 
beneath a welter of longstanding Middle East problems and avoid any commitment 
on the U.N. demand for an unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait. "Forget Kuwait 
ever existed," Information Minister Latif Jasim advised foreign journalists in 
Baghdad earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Baghdad regime continues to host a series of foreign dignitaries 
seeking freedom for hostages held by Iraq as insurance against attack. Former 
West German Chancellor Willy Brandt visited Baghdad last week and returned 
Friday to Germany with 174 Westerners, including three Americans, aboard a 
Lufthansa plane. 
</P>
<P>
Succeeding him in the Iraqi capital Saturday were former Prime Ministers Anker 
Joergensen of Denmark and David Lange of New Zealand, and former Atty. Gen. 
Ramsey Clark of the United States.

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev concluded a two-day trip to Germany on 
Saturday, a visit that symbolized the new, post-unification relationship 
between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, left Germany for Moscow on Saturday evening. The 
Soviet delegation, which also included Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, 
was seen off at the Frankfurt airport by Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich 
Genscher. 
</P>
<P>
Before they left, thousands of people chanting, "Gorby, Gorby," and waving 
Soviet flags, thronged the streets as Gorbachev toured several central German 
towns with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, crediting him with a major role in the 
process that led to German reunification Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's arrival in Bonn on Friday coincided with the first anniversary of 
the Nov. 9, 1989, opening of the Berlin Wall while East Germany's Stalinist 
system was crumbling. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of these changes would not have been possible without your personal 
participation and your support -- this is also the case for German unification, 
and I would like to thank you warmly for this," Kohl told Gorbachev after the 
two talked privately Saturday evening at the chancellor's Oggersheim residence. 
</P>
<P>
Standing outside the villa in the central German state of Rhineland-Palatinate 
as he prepared to leave for home, Gorbachev told the Bonn leader that "It was a 
long and difficult path . . . to reach today's stage and today's historic 
agreements." 
</P>
<P>
Following extensive talks in Bonn, the two leaders Friday signed a cooperation 
treaty that formalizes the new bilateral relations, while their aides signed an 
economic treaty and a bilateral social agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gorbachev apparently did not make specific requests for German 
credits, the leaders talked at length about the Soviet economic reforms and a 
German role in them. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that your reform policy will be successful, and we will assist within 
our possibilities," Kohl told his Soviet guest. 
</P>
<P>
Before traveling to the Rhineland-Palatinate, Gorbachev met in Bonn on Saturday 
morning with liberal and opposition Social Democratic politicians.

The Red Square gunman who fired two shots across from Soviet President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev was identified Saturday as a radical activist who had hawked 
subversive leaflets and belonged to a new party pledged to remove the 
Communists from power. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, chief of the KGB security agency, had indicated last 
week that officials believed Alexander A. Shmonov, 38, of Leningrad, who fired 
a sawed-off shotgun during the annual Revolution Day parade Wednesday, was 
simply insane. 
</P>
<P>
But amid growing signs that the incident is taking on highly political 
overtones, Shmonov has been charged with attempted terrorism. A conservative 
newspaper reported Saturday that he had sold pamphlets for the Democratic 
Union, an ultra-radical group. 
</P>
<P>
Shmonov, formerly a machinist at a Leningrad factory, organized "rallies that 
seldom ended without a scandal" during the 1989 election campaign, according to 
Sovetskaya Rossiya, known as the country's most hard-line daily newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Sovetskaya Rossiya quoted Shmonov's former boss as saying that "participating 
in 'democratic' propaganda helped him ripen to the point of committing a 
terrorist act." 
</P>
<P>
Valery Terekhov, one of the leaders of the Democratic Union's Leningrad branch, 
vehemently denied that Shmonov was one of the group's 110 members and said the 
group had never advocated terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
"We're for changing the current system but only through nonviolent means," 
Terekhov said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
He added that, according to other activists, Shmonov was a member of the Free 
Democratic Party of Russia, founded last summer among a welter of new political 
parties that have arisen since the Communist Party renounced its monopoly on 
power. 
</P>
<P>
Marina Salye, a Leningrad councilwoman and leader of the Free Democrats, 
refused to comment when reached at her office. "I don't want to give any 
information on that matter," she said but added that the party would put out a 
statement on the Shmonov affair soon. 
</P>
<P>
Terekhov has predicted that the statement from the Free Democrats would 
disclaim Shmonov, just as the Leningrad Popular Front, a liberal organization 
that Shmonov apparently supported, has already done. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Democratic Union, the Free Democrats hold the peaceful removal of the 
Communist Party from power as one of their main goals but are willing to allow 
it to continue competing in the political arena. 
</P>
<P>
If Shmonov is shown to be sane but a political radical who took his ideas too 
far, his violent move could go far to discredit the liberal end of the Soviet 
political spectrum, Terekhov said. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, the KGB security police, who are interrogating Shmonov, have not 
announced whether they believe that he was planning an assassination or was 
simply hoping to disrupt the traditional Red Square parade marking the 
anniversary of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
According to official reports and film showing Shmonov's arrest, he was at 
least 100 yards from the mausoleum where Gorbachev and other leaders stood 
watching the parade when he pulled out his sawed-off shotgun. He thus could 
have had little hope of an accurate shot. He was grabbed immediately by 
plainclothes police, and no one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still a lot of questions about his motivation," KGB spokesman 
Alexander N. Karbainov said Saturday. "There are still a lot of questions 
here."

NEW PAKISTAN CABINET SHOWS LINKS TO ZIA

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's new Cabinet brings back nearly a dozen veteran 
politicians with links to the late military dictator Gen. Zia ul-Haq. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-member Cabinet was sworn in Friday night by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan. 
</P>
<P>
The ministry portfolios were announced Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Defense was the only portfolio that was not assigned. But analysts say Sharif 
probably will keep it, following the tradition of his predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
The new Cabinet is dominated by veterans of the Muslim League, the largest of 
18 parties in the right-wing Islamic Democratic Alliance that swept into power 
in the Oct. 24 parliamentary elections. 
</P>
<P>
Sharif, a 41-year-old industrialist who launched his political career during 
Zia's rule, was sworn in as prime minister Wednesday to head the country's 
fifth civilian government in 43 years. 
</P>
<P>
His Cabinet is one of the smallest, especially compared to the record 58-member 
Cabinet of his predecessor, ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the most important portfolios will remain with veteran politicians who 
have links to the Zia era. They were also members of the caretaker government 
handpicked by the president after he dismissed Bhutto's 20-month-old government 
on Aug. 6 on charges of corruption and mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
Sahabzada Yaqub Khan will remain foreign minister, Sartaj Aziz will stay as 
finance minister and Chaudry Shujaat Hussain was appointed minister for 
Industries and the Interior.

200 SOLDIERS REPORTEDLY DIE IN AFGHAN MASSACRE;

Muslim guerrillas fighting to topple the leadership of Afghanistan slaughtered 
more than 200 government soldiers who had agreed to surrender, diplomatic and 
guerrilla sources said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The killings occurred during battles in October for two provincial capitals in 
southern Afghanistan, the sources said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Moderate guerrillas blamed Muslim fundamentalists for the massacres. Moderate 
groups have pulled out of the fighting, aimed at pressuring the Kabul 
government to negotiate an end to the 12-year-old war, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is denying responsibility," one diplomatic source said. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas gunned down at least 95 Afghan soldiers who had surrendered and 
paved the way for the Oct. 4 fall of Tarin Kot, the capital of Uruzgan 
Province, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
About two weeks later, they said, an additional 125 soldiers were slain by 
guerrillas negotiating the surrender of Qalat, capital of neighboring Zabul 
province. The guerrillas had promised the soldiers safe passage if they 
defected, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Another 100 soldiers were holed up in a heavily armed fort overlooking the 
deserted city until 400 troops were flown in by the Soviet-backed Kabul 
government, along with food and other supplies, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The reinforcements allowed the government to hold Qalat, which sources said was 
on the verge of falling to the U.S.-financed guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
Qalat is strategically important to the Kabul government because of a highway 
that links eight provincial capitals. It is the major route for resupply 
convoys. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the Soviet Union ended nine years of direct involvement in 
Afghanistan and withdrew its soldiers in February, 1989, many expected that 
huge defections among government troops would bring down the Kabul government 
within months. But their predictions proved wrong, largely because of highly 
publicized massacres of soldiers who surrendered to the moujahedeen. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1988, about 70 government soldiers were killed, their bodies cut 
into pieces and put on display by fundamentalist guerrillas near the town of 
Torkham on the border with Pakistan.

A U.S. District Court jury has awarded $2.7 million to three Santa Clara County 
sheriff's deputies who alleged that a male officer demanded sex in exchange for 
a favorable work review. 
</P>
<P>
In making the award Friday, the court also ruled that the Sheriff's Department 
and several officials did not do enough to discourage the ongoing harassment. 
The deputies, Zana Murphy, Cynthia Bates and Toni Daugherty, filed the suit in 
1985, charging sheriff's officials with failure to investigate complaints 
against Deputy Craig Nelson. The three accused Nelson of making lewd comments 
and sexual advances while he was their training officer at the county jail.

A part-time letter carrier known as a fast worker resigned from his job this 
week after postal inspectors found more than 3,600 pieces of undelivered mail 
in his car. Roy Castillo, 24, a South Natomas relief rural carrier associated 
with the U.S. Postal Service since May, resigned Wednesday after allowing 
postal investigators to search his car, postal spokeswoman Pat Locke said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Under the front seat and in the trunk were 3,618 pieces of undelivered mail, 
some carrying postmarks three weeks old, Locke said. "The (postal) supervisor 
discovered he was not delivering what we call bulk business mail -- what some 
people refer to as junk mail," Locke said. In addition to 2,200 advertising 
circulars, Castillo had failed to deliver nearly 100 first-class letters, 
including 81 greeting cards; 160 magazines, and more than 1,000 third-class 
political mailers, she said.

STANFORD 'BIG GREEN' WOE: A WATER FINE OF $209,000

Stanford University will pay a steep price for keeping its football field and 
campus green after mandatory water rationing was imposed during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
The university has been fined $209,000 by the San Francisco Water Department, 
its largest supplier of water, since August. 
</P>
<P>
Its bill for October alone ran an extra $127,237 because Stanford used 25.9 
million gallons beyond its limit, about a third more than its allotment. 
</P>
<P>
The state's water crisis, brought on by four consecutive years of below-average 
rainfall, has forced most water customers in the area to endure short showers 
and brown lawns. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, 80% of customers have managed to stay within their allotments, 
according to Cheryl Davis, manager of the water department's customer service 
division. 
</P>
<P>
But Stanford utilities manager David Kaye said the school had to water the 
campus extensively in October because it was such a dry month. 
</P>
<P>
Since August the university has used 54 million gallons of excess water. 
</P>
<P>
Until this week, Stanford had been watering its football field, lawns and golf 
course with water from supplies at Hetch Hetchy Reservoir near Yosemite. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the athletic fields are also classrooms, if you want to stretch the 
meaning of classrooms," Kaye said. 
</P>
<P>
But a long-term water conservation plan is needed, university officials 
concede. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford has installed meters on buildings that didn't have them, including 800 
faculty homes, and it turned off its seven decorative fountains and stopped 
washing university cars. 
</P>
<P>
The 25.9 million extra gallons Stanford used in October was enough to supply 
more than 14,000 people for a month, based on figures from the water 
department.

DESPITE THE CHILL, ARMORY REMAINS CLOSED TO HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
Even though nighttime temperatures in the coldest populated area of Los Angeles 
County -- the Antelope Valley -- have routinely fallen below 40 degrees this 
month, local officials have been unable to persuade the state to open the 
Palmdale National Guard armory as a shelter for the area's homeless until at 
least Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
State armories, including five elsewhere in Los Angeles County, were made 
available last year starting Nov. 14 on nights expected to be colder than 40 
degrees. Even that was two weeks beyond the planned starting date, county 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The armory in Palmdale was not among those provided to county cold-weather 
programs last year by the state Office of Emergency Services. But because of 
the area's growing homeless population and cold winter nights when the 
temperature drops into the 20s, it is included this year. 
</P>
<P>
The start of the state program has been delayed by an effort to implement new 
regulations aimed at solving health and safety issues, including fights and 
problems with sanitation at some shelters, that have generated complaints in 
the past, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Local officials are not unsympathetic to the efforts to prevent a repeat of 
those problems. But, meanwhile, the weather is growing colder, especially in 
the Antelope Valley, which has one of the harshest and longest winters in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't object to the state setting new safeguards, but if they are going to 
have a cold-weather program, they should make the armories available when it 
gets cold," said Larry Johnson, assistant director of the county Department of 
Community and Senior Citizen Services. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Passerello of the state Office of Emergency Services acknowledged that 
"we have stumbled a little bit this year" with the sheltering program. "I think 
this program has worked very effectively, but it has not been without its 
problems," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Between November and March of last year, 166,000 people took shelter on cold 
nights in armories in California, 11,359 of them in Los Angeles County, 
according to state statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Fights, attempted murders and rapes occurred at armories in some counties last 
year, Passerello said. In others, officials were not equipped to deal with the 
illnesses of the homeless people or to clean up the facilities after they were 
used. As a result, there were numerous complaints from the National Guard and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
"You put 200 people in a facility that is not designed for them and you are 
going to have problems," she said. The state is still drawing up new 
requirements for counties to hire public health experts, security guards and 
professional cleanup crews at armories this year. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County already takes such measures, Johnson said. He said his 
department plans to step up lobbying efforts this week to get the shelter 
program started as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
With the high desert's homeless population growing, the special dangers posed 
by cold weather should be recognized earlier next year, said Kathryn Barger, a 
deputy for Supervisor Mike Antonovich who works with programs for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are still trying to determine the exact number of homeless people in 
the Antelope Valley. When Lancaster opened a homeless shelter last year, social 
workers estimated the number to be in the hundreds and possibly higher. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something we are going to have to address, both morally and due to the 
strict guidelines" that call for emergency shelters when the temperature falls 
below 40 degees, Barger said. 
</P>
<P>
Passerello agreed. "We better revisit it if it really has been that cold down 
there," she said. She said her office is exploring the possibility of finding 
an interim facility to use as a shelter. 
</P>
<P>
The nighttime temperature in the Antelope Valley hovered near emergency levels 
even before the county began the cold-weather program Nov. 1. According to 
National Weather Service statistics, the low temperature in Lancaster dipped 
below 40 degrees nine days in October, with an average low in the upper 40s. 
</P>
<P>
This month, even though daytime temperatures were in the 60s and 70s, the 
average low has been in the high 30s, said meteorologist Steve Burback of 
Weather Data, a private meteorological company. On Nov. 5, the low dropped to 
24 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Davis, director of the Lancaster city shelter, said the sooner the armory 
opens, the better. 
</P>
<P>
The county's cold-weather program has been referring homeless people to the 
40-bed city shelter operated by Catholic Charities. A maximum of 35 of the 
shelter's beds have been occupied in recent weeks, with as many as nine people 
being referred from the county's program, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now it's not a problem," Johnson said, agreeing with state officials 
that the current demand for shelter is being met. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson said the number of people using the Lancaster shelter will grow as 
the weather gets worse and the threat of snow and rain increases. The county 
may then have to provide hotel and motel vouchers, which cost the county $25 a 
person rather than the $10 per person it costs the county for the armory beds. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a drain on the program," which lasts through March and has a $500,000 
county budget, Johnson said. "To the extent the state can't meet their 
obligation, it's a drain. We don't want to run out of money." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the cold-weather program could disrupt the Lancaster shelter, 
which provides social and vocational services for ongoing residents, Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, the director of the Lancaster shelter, said the number of people using 
the county's program does not reflect the size of the valley's homeless 
population. Some may not know about the shelter program and others may not have 
a way to get to the city's shelter. 
</P>
<P>
The growth in the number of homeless people in the Antelope Valley has mirrored 
the area's population boom overall and is reflected in the increasing number of 
applications for public aid and housing vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
A visible symbol is an abandoned farm building on Sierra Highway near Avenue I 
that people on the street call the "Tin Shed." The vast metal building has only 
two walls and a concrete floor, but it provides some shelter for as many as 20 
homeless people who build bonfires there at night to keep warm and who sleep in 
lean-tos and old cars. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies, who have conducted periodic sweeps of the building because 
of complaints of thefts from nearby businesses, say many of the shed's 
residents are alcoholics and drug addicts.

OFFICIALS FEAR LAKE POLLUTION FROM LUXURY HOUSING; 
</P>
<P>
WESTLAKE VILLAGE: ONE PLANNER CALLS THE EIGHT-ACRE LAKE ELEANOR THE 'JEWEL' OF 
THE AREA'S OPEN-SPACE SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A proposal to construct 52 luxury houses on 78 acres in Westlake Village has 
raised the ire of park agencies that want to acquire the site and of Thousand 
Oaks officials who say the project will pollute a lake on their side of the 
county line. 
</P>
<P>
Lake Eleanor, nestled in Decker Canyon near Westlake Boulevard, west of the 
county line, is an eight-acre crescent of water that planners say is the heart 
of a thriving wildlife community, including many species of birds, insects and 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
They say the lake is also an important watering hole for larger animals such as 
deer and coyotes that come down from the Santa Monica Mountains. Although the 
lake is fenced, planners hope that it will soon be accessible to the public via 
a trail connecting it to the Santa Monica Mountains backbone trail. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the jewel of our open-space system," said Doug Nickels, a planner for 
the Conejo Open Space Conservation Agency. "You always see waterfowl, ducks, 
egrets and a lot of animals come down from the mountains to drink here." 
</P>
<P>
But Nickels, environmentalists and other parks agencies say the value of the 
lake -- to animals and the public -- is jeopardized by a plan by M.J. Brock to 
build suburban-style tract housing just upstream from the reservoir, in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Federal, state and local agencies have joined to oppose the proposal on the 
ground that it would obliterate a seasonal drainage dubbed Decker Creek that 
feeds the lake. Runoff from the tract, which would include lawn fertilizers and 
other chemicals, would pollute the lake, they fear. 
</P>
<P>
They said the project, which is to be known as Lake Eleanor Hills, would also 
destroy a valuable wildlife habitat that is home to several rare and endangered 
species, including Pentachaeta lyonii -- an indigenous flower found only in the 
Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Brock officials said they would be willing to sell the flat, grassy meadow 
where they plan to build, but none of the agencies that oppose the project have 
made any serious attempts to buy it. And unless Brock can sell the property, 
said spokesman Larry Lynch, the developer is determined to go ahead with the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
The National Park Service wants to buy the property and establish a visitor 
center and trail head there, said Kent Schwartzkopf of the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy. But he said the Park Service does not have the cash to 
purchase it this year. 
</P>
<P>
Left without the resources to acquire the land, and without the clear authority 
to block the project, the parks agencies are pressuring the developer and the 
Westlake Village City Council to reduce the size of the tract. 
</P>
<P>
Based on an environmental impact report completed in March, the Westlake 
Village Planning Department staff has already recommended that the council 
approve the 52-unit project. 
</P>
<P>
But planners from the Conejo Open Space Conservation Agency -- which owns Lake 
Eleanor and more than 600 acres nearby -- have asked Brock to cut back the 
project to 31 residences, which they said would save many of the endangered 
plants and several oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the Westlake Village Planning Department approved a plan by the land's 
previous owner, Prudential Insurance Co., that called for 64 single-family 
houses, 196 multiple-family units and commercial office space on the property 
that runs along the north side of Decker Road. 
</P>
<P>
That project was rejected by the City Council because of concerns about traffic 
and noise. Lynch said that Brock, which has owned the property since 1988, 
considered those problems when designing the tract plan now under 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we would, by and large, end up with a pretty good reception," Lynch 
said of the current proposal. "We were trying to have a non-controversial 
project by going down so far in density." 
</P>
<P>
However, planners from the Conejo group, the conservancy and the state 
Department of Fish and Game all say that the project is still too big, and have 
urged Westlake Village planners to allow only 31 residences to be built there. 
</P>
<P>
"They would have a viable project that would be superior to what they have 
currently proposed. It would create a situation where the environment wins and 
the developer wins," said Peter Ireland of the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy, who recently met with Brock officials to try to persuade them to 
consider the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch said, however, that the reduced project would be economically unfeasible 
for the developer. He also defended the proposal as "truly a sensitive project" 
and denied that water runoff from the housing development would harm water 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
"The notion that that degree of runoff would create some problem is 
unbelievable," he said. He said the lake is "a man-made feature installed 100 
years ago" and not a natural body of water. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly it changed the environment of the area, but that doesn't make it 
sacrosanct," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Nickels and others say the project would be an environmental catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Deputy Atty. Gen. Gail Ruderman Fuer wrote to the Westlake Village 
planning director stating that the environmental destruction the project would 
cause appeared to outweigh any potential benefits. 
</P>
<P>
She also recommended that the city require an additional botanical survey of 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy has identified at least 15 
endangered or sensitive species in addition to the Pentachaeta lyonii growing 
near the proposed construction site, the environmental impact report on the 
Lake Eleanor Hills project concluded that no examples of those plants were 
growing on the property. 
</P>
<P>
Fuer said the developer's biology consultants toured the site during a season 
when most of the plant species were not in bloom and could easily have been 
overlooked. She also said the supplemental environmental impact report brushed 
over the issue of the wetlands that would be destroyed if the project proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
Nickels said the property is an important access route to the lake for animals 
such as deer and coyotes from the Santa Monica Mountains. The developer has 
said that the animals could easily find water elsewhere, but Nickels said the 
lake is one of the only year-round watering holes in the Santa Monica 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The project's supplemental environmental impact report is now being circulated, 
and a public hearing on the project is scheduled for Dec. 12 before the 
Westlake Village City Council.

<P>
There seems to be some dissonance from a corner of the avant-garde. 
</P>
<P>
"Narcissism?! It's taken such a bad rap. There are very positive aspects of 
narcissism." 
</P>
<P>
Monologuist Spalding Gray, the self-described "raving talking head," creator of 
more than a dozen one-person performance narratives, including "Swimming to 
Cambodia," which was made into a 1987 film, is talking about talking about 
himself. Querulously. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I think people are interested in a person, a man talking about his life," 
he says. "Not just because I'm self-obsessed, but because it includes all of 
our lives. It's like my New England background -- certain things being 
forbidden. It's refreshing to have people speak close to what's on their minds. 
Like in my next monologue, I will speak a lot about my organs. My sex organs." 
</P>
<P>
Within the iconoclastic ranks of contemporary raconteurs cut more or less from 
the disparate traditions of Mark Twain, Lenny Bruce and New York's downtown 
theater scene, Gray stands alone. Not because he is a box-office draw or for 
the trace elements of controversy he generates, such as the anti-war sentiments 
in "Swimming to Cambodia." Rather, Gray is unique among chic-come-round-again 
one-person performers -- a list that ranges from Karen Finley to Lily Tomlin, 
Eric Bogosian to Garrison Keillor, even Jackie Mason -- for being the most 
persistent of navel-gazers. Not for him the avuncular imaginary musings of 
Keillor or the schizophrenic character ravings of Bogosian or Tomlin. Gray's 13 
monologues -- beginning with "Sex and Death to the Age 14," in 1979 and on up 
to his latest, "Monster in a Box," which opens at Lincoln Center Wednesday -- 
are all spun from the loose flywheel of their author's personality. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm different from other one-person performers," Gray says during an interview 
in his downtown loft. "I'm not looking for Desert Shield jokes the way Jackie 
Mason would, or any comic would. I'm doing oral journals. I'm looking inward." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Christiansen, theater critic of the Chicago Tribune and one of Gray's 
earliest champions, wrote in a recent review, "Gray's stories always begin and 
end within his psyche . . . forever filled with the strange, fearful terrors he 
has found therein." 
</P>
<P>
If such post-Freudian self-absorption has been Gray's personal leitmotif, it is 
also a mirror now reflecting changes in the actor's public persona. Co-founder 
of New York's avant-garde Wooster Group theater nearly 15 years ago, Gray still 
insists, "I thought I would spend the rest of my life collecting unemployment." 
He is now pondering such Kierkegaardian excesses as "the dizziness that comes 
from too much possibility." 
</P>
<P>
Gray's Lincoln Center run, already sold out, has been extended into January. 
Gray will perform an earlier monologue, "Terrors of Pleasure," with "Monster in 
a Box" at the Los Angeles Theater Center next summer. He is booked elsewhere -- 
including a brief residency at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur -- until the 
middle of 1992. His novel, which he is still editing, will be published by 
Knopf within the next 18 months, and there are always film offers and cable 
television specials to ponder. "Spalding is sui generis, but he is much more 
nationally known now, and it is easier to exploit his fame," says Gary 
Fisketjon, Gray's editor at Knopf. 
</P>
<P>
Adds Gordon Davidson, artistic director of the Mark Taper Forum, where Gray was 
in residence two years ago, "Spalding is unique among performers. The danger is 
that by doing what he does, he's become a personality." 
</P>
<P>
It is an issue that Gray addresses in this latest monologue. Performed in 
typical Gray style -- flannel shirt, glass of water, a desk and a microphone -- 
"Monster in a Box" is ostensibly about the actor's attempt to write a 
quasi-autobiographical novel about the death of his mother. But in typical Gray 
style, the monologue is rife with narrative digressions, and "Monster in a Box" 
becomes a work about not writing a novel. Rather, it is about the price of 
success, how Gray coped with the spate of Hollywood roles he was offered after 
being in Roland Joffe's film "The Killing Fields" and Jonathan Demme's 1987 
film version of "Swimming to Cambodia." These included such opportunities as 
the chance to interview on film some people who had been -- or thought they had 
been -- captured by aliens. Roles that Gray accepted included parts in such 
films as David Byrne's "True Stories," "Stars and Bars," "Clara's Heart" and 
most recently, "Beaches," starring Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey. 
</P>
<P>
While Gray's monologues have been consistently well-received, his stage and 
film work, particularly his lead in the 1988 Broadway production of "Our Town," 
have been greeted less enthusiastically. Ergo discomfiture on the cusp of fame. 
"I want to work in films because of the health insurance -- three weeks in a 
movie and you get a year's worth of major medical, including psychiatric," as 
Gray puts it in the monologue, which is largely set in Los Angeles. "But I know 
I shouldn't do too many more," Gray says in his loft. "I was brought out to 
L.A. to do that (Taper) project, and while it appeared to be a very pleasurable 
setting, I had no idea how difficult it would be 
</P>
<P>
for me to live out there." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Gray assumes a Woody Allen mantle in this monologue, his dour 
New England/New York sensibilities blinking in the Southern California light 
while lifting an accusing finger at the usual suspects: earthquakes, power 
lunches, Diet Coke, therapists and freeways. Even he admits "it's an old, old 
story." Like someone invited to Spago who only orders coffee, Gray even spurned 
the all-powerful Creative Artists Agency during his Los Feliz residency. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I didn't sign with CAA," says Gray, pouring tea. "I was conflicted. I 
didn't want to be star. I could no longer be a fly on the wall, and that would 
have meant renouncing my monologues. Most actors can't talk about their lives 
because they have to preserve this certain image. If I'm around a lot of fans, 
I'm going inside myself to protect against their eyes. When I'm with strangers, 
everything goes outward. All my feelers are up, I pick up all new material. I'm 
alive. Celebrity would be death." 
</P>
<P>
Gray says that "Monster in a Box" is "about resisting and grappling" with the 
growing encroachment of fame. "I'm a peripheral celebrity. My work is not that 
accessible. My father and stepmother won't come see me. My work is frightening 
and odd to the mainstream viewer. This is not a new 'Spalding Gray Show' I want 
to milk. It's the 13th monologue. I want to be done with it so I can get on 
with the next monologue." 
</P>
<P>
The one about the sex organs, the one with the working title "Gray's 
Anatomies," will, like the best of Gray's monologues, attempt to go beyond 
personal therapeutic ramblings. Indeed, if "Monster in a Box" is ostensibly 
about the price of fame and Hollywood high jinks, it is also about the author's 
coming to terms with his mother's suicide. It is his most personal monologue. 
"I haven't come to terms with the whole story," he says, " -- there are still 
too many missing links. But it is the first time I have told the story 
directly." 
</P>
<P>
And it is a story that Gray will pursue further in "Gray's Anatomies," which 
will address the actor's growing sense of mortality as well as issues of faith 
and medicine. (Gray's mother was a Christian Scientist, and for a while Gray 
attended the Christian Science Church.) The central event of that monologue is 
an eye operation that Gray had in August. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you want a cookie to go with your tea? They don't have any sugar in them," 
says Gray, absently rummaging through cupboards. "I'm on a new diet. I gave up 
drinking last summer. I told myself to do it. Partly because I had the eye 
operation this summer. I have it on videotape if they would like to see it. The 
doctor even put on titles, what are they called?" he says, turning to Renee 
Shafransky, his longtime companion. From the far end of the loft comes the 
answer: "Video Crayons." And then she adds, " 'Swimming to the Macula' . . . 
macula, that's the center of the eyeball." 
</P>
<P>
Shafransky -- a tall, dark-haired screenwriter best known in Gray's monologues 
as the long-suffering, ever-wise "my girlfriend Renee" -- sweeps into the room 
dressed in black. She has the accent and energy of a native New Yorker, a stark 
contrast to the pale, hesitant actor. Shafransky, who is working on a 
screenplay for Universal and who has produced films including "Swimming to 
Cambodia," is directing Gray, for the first time, in "Monster in a Box." 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, they put a gas bubble in my eye and I couldn't lift my head for 10 
days," says Gray, settling in at the kitchen table with the sugarless cookies 
and an array of organically grown fruit. "I had to sleep face-down, I got books 
on tape and got very depressed. But at least my vision is no longer blurred, 
like I was looking through a jellyfish. But that's the whole monologue about 
faith and medicine. I only do monologues about the serendipitous. I keep 
thinking that I will focus on my taxes and go to Washington and do a monologue 
about doing an audit with the IRS, but that would be contrived. It would be 
like a reporter looking for a story. As soon as I look for a story, another 
appears. I go blind or something happens." 
</P>
<P>
It is his way, Gray says, of coping with "the chaos." And sitting here in his 
loft with the pale northern sky backlighting his flowing gray hair and the pale 
stubble on his cheek, Gray looks like a man who has seen a lot of chaos. He is 
taller and thinner, far less robust than he appears on stage. His demeanor is 
as flat as his Rhode Island accent, his humor sheathed in ice-cold irony. As 
Shafransky says, "When I first met Spalding, I thought he was a Martian. He 
revealed so much of himself onstage but he hardly ever talked to people in a 
real emotional way." In June, Gray will turn 50. While he admits that he and 
Shafransky are considering having a child, the avant-garde seems suddenly very, 
very tired. 
</P>
<P>
Of his work process, Gray says, "The only way I know it's working is when I 
find myself in chaos. I start keeping a journal and the chaos becomes resolved. 
I get a big cardboard box and I throw in everything that is relevant. Later I 
see how it's organized." Later he will hone the monologue in front of audiences 
for nearly a year, editing and rearranging the material. 
</P>
<P>
It is a performance technique that Gray stumbled on during his early years as 
an actor in New York. Born in Rhode Island in 1941 to an upper-middle-class New 
England family, Gray suffered from minor dyslexia and some behavioral problems 
as a child. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't finish boarding school until he was almost 20, then attended Boston's 
Emerson College, where he majored in theater and discovered he could make 
people laugh with his storytelling. "It certainly wasn't on stage. I could 
barely get up there," he says. Instead, in the kitchen of the tony Katherine 
Gibbs School for secretaries, "I would hang with the help and tell stories to 
the other Emerson students, the old Irish ladies and the Merchant Marine guys, 
the reformed alcoholics. That's when I discovered I could be funny." 
</P>
<P>
After graduation Gray drifted around the regional theater circuit for five 
years before landing in New York at the experimental Performing Garage. "I 
thought I would be a professional actor going from regional theater to regional 
theater, living alone, being a bachelor, putting myself to sleep every night 
with beers and spending the days pretending I was someone else," says Gray. 
</P>
<P>
"But part of me knew that was a death trip," he adds when asked about the 
transition into confessional monologues. "And it was the '60s and I wasn't 
taking acid, but I had come to New York to work in underground theater. It was 
New York in 1967, and I went to see (Richard Schechner's) 'Dionysis' and it 
just blew my mind. I was terrified that these naked women on stage would come 
and pull me down and do something terrible to me. All my concepts about theater 
were just blown away by the Open Theater, Joe Chaikin's work and count 
everything else into it -- Merce Cunningham, Meredith Monk, Charles Ludlum. I 
just walked into a caldron of creativity." 
</P>
<P>
For five years, Gray worked with a variety of downtown artists before forming 
the Wooster Group with Elizabeth LeCompte, an artist and theater director whom 
he had met in Saratoga, N.Y. "It was a community, we all went to each other's 
work. That's how I found my form," says Gray. "I realized this was the place 
for me to initiate things." Indeed, it was at the Wooster Group that Gray first 
began using autobiographical material, in the company's early productions -- 
their performance trilogy, "Three Places in Rhode Island." Much of those pieces 
were based on interviews Gray had conducted with members of his family after 
his mother's death. "They were very revealing tapes," recalls Gray. "We played 
them onstage as part of the performances." 
</P>
<P>
"Always, Spalding told stories," recalls LeCompte, artistic director of the 
Wooster Group, whose headquarters are across the street from Gray's loft. "A 
lot of what he did at the beginning he did as therapy. His work is more complex 
now. But Spalding was never a naturalistic actor. He works very well with a 
mask, even if it's a mask of himself playing himself." 
</P>
<P>
By 1979, Gray had spun off from the Wooster Group and was performing his first 
autobiographical monologue about coming of age in Rhode Island, "Sex and Death 
to the Age of 14" and began earning comparisons to Mark Twain. 
</P>
<P>
"I first saw Spalding perform at a theater conference 10 years ago," recalls 
Gregory Mosher, artistic director of the Lincoln Center Theaters. "I was at the 
Goodman (Theater in Chicago) then and after five minutes I was laughing so hard 
I was crying. I had to block the aisle to keep other directors from getting to 
him first." 
</P>
<P>
Since then Gray has worked steadily at small theaters and college campuses 
around the country, churning out performance pieces. By the mid-1980s Gray had 
caught the attention of British director Roland Joffe, who cast the actor as 
the American ambassador's aide in his Vietnam War film, "The Killing Fields." 
"That film swept me out of the Garage," says Gray. "It was my magic carpet out 
of Soho. It gave me a whole new outlook on the world." That film was quickly 
followed by Gray's most acclaimed performance piece to date, "Swimming to 
Cambodia," a four-hour, two-part monologue about the making of "The Killing 
Fields" that earned Gray an Obie Award, was published as a book and later made 
into the critically hailed film. 
</P>
<P>
"I shot 'Swimming' and the whole thing took off," Gray says now. "Things just 
started happening." One of those things included an offer from Mosher, who was 
by then in New York, to play the Stage Manager in the Broadway revival of 
Thornton Wilder's "Our Town." 
</P>
<P>
It was a performance that, despite Mosher's expectation that Gray would be "the 
Stage Manager of the '80s," was roundly savaged by the New York critics. 
"(Gray's) blase Tribeca hip-ness belongs to another planet," wrote Frank Rich 
in the New York Times. That production -- including the tar-and-feathering by 
critics -- provides the oddly touching denouement to "Monster in a Box." 
</P>
<P>
"I am very excited that I will get to quote the critics," says Gray, suddenly 
enthusiastic. "This is going to be a first, an actor in a show who gets to talk 
about the critics while they are there sitting on the other side." 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly Gray stands and dumps a pile of pear cores into the kitchen sink. 
There is a technical rehearsal uptown at the theater in half an hour, and 
Shafransky, clearly the ballast of the duo, is hurrying him along. But like a 
man who can't stop talking about himself, Gray hurtles on. "I was brought out 
to L.A. to do that theater project and a big chunk of it is in this monologue 
about how I found it difficult to live out there. Why? I don't know if it was 
an excess of pleasure or a lack of contact with people in arbitrary and chance 
settings that I devour here in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"One story about L.A. that isn't in the monologue about L.A. was how I was out 
there for a long time and then I came back and New York looked horrible -- no 
birds, no flowers. It was Mother's Day and I decided I would visit my therapist 
on 104th Street and Central Park West and I walked from here. And what I 
discovered was that while New York may not have nature, it has human nature. I 
spent the whole walk talking randomly with people, fans, friends, strangers. 
I'm not against L.A. but . . . you have to go there in a car. Nothing is more 
depressing for me than riding in a car in the dark and looking out at other 
cars in the dark. That's my version of hell."

HEADING UP THE EUROPEAN INVASION; 
</P>
<P>
AS A NATO OFFICER, BILL ROEDY KNEW THEORETICALLY HOW TO TAKE OVER EASTERN 
EUROPE, BUT AS MTV EUROPE'S DIRECTOR, HE'S ACTUALLY DOING IT

<P>
When Bill Roedy commanded a NATO nuclear missile base in Northern Italy for 3 
1/2 years in the 1970s, he was playing his part to keep the Cold War alive. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 18 months, he thinks he's done his share to help it end. But Roedy 
isn't in uniform these days -- he's chief executive and managing director of 
MTV Europe, which, like its American parent channel, broadcasts music videos, 
rock concerts and music information aimed at 16- to 34-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
MTV Europe reaches 16.4 million households in 26 countries -- and the massive 
changes in the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact countries in the last year have 
opened up a market of vast potential. In the wake of perestroika, glasnost and 
the momentous fall of Communist regimes, the Eastern Bloc nations have been 
unanimous: They want their MTV. 
</P>
<P>
"Back then, I had a very different perspective toward Eastern Europe than now," 
Roedy said. "It was strictly NATO versus Warsaw Pact. Now I think TV's a much 
more effective instrument than missiles. My old colleagues at West Point may 
not love to hear that. But I really do believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, when Roedy recently attended a reunion of his West Point class, 
opinions on his new career were mixed. "Some people were enthusiastic, almost 
envious," he said. "Others said, 'You do what?' They're so service-oriented." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Roedy has been closer to the historic action in Eastern Europe than 
many of his old friends who stuck with the military. As the man charged with 
finalizing deals with Eastern European governments to accept MTV Europe within 
their borders via cable or satellite, he has assumed a role equivalent to that 
of a cultural ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
"In Budapest last year, I signed an agreement for Hungary to receive MTV in the 
presence of 20 government officials," he said. "The ceremony took place in a 
beautiful hotel restaurant overlooking the Danube. There were white tablecloths 
and Champagne. We gave speeches all night. There was an exchange of pens. It 
was like signing a peace treaty. I had to keep reminding myself this was only 
music television." 
</P>
<P>
Roedy was addressing a music industry conference in East Berlin late last year 
and had succeeded, through labyrinthine negotiations, in hooking up MTV for 
cable TV in the city for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
An hour into the conference, the East German Politburo resigned. Within 48 
hours, the dismantling of the Berlin Wall began. A group of East Germans 
heading for liberty in the West were stopped and asked how they knew the wall 
was down. "We saw it on MTV," they said. 
</P>
<P>
Then last month, MTV, after lengthy talks with government officials, broke 
through on Soviet TV for the first time. The channel will broadcast for an hour 
every Friday night on "Vzglyad" (Glance), a popular youth-oriented program. 
It's a modest beginning, but because it's on Gostelradio 1, the most-watched 
national channel in the U.S.S.R., MTV Europe will be beamed into 88 million 
homes, from the Baltic states to Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
Roedy has souvenirs of his foreign adventures in his London office -- photos of 
the ceremony in Budapest, pieces of the Berlin Wall. On his own wall, a map 
with thumbtacks marks those cities conquered by MTV Europe. Roedy now has a 
Harvard MBA and a successful career in the entertainment industry, but old 
military habits die hard. 
</P>
<P>
MTV's successes behind the former Iron Curtain have been attention-grabbers, 
but its real achievement is the stranglehold it has secured on all of Europe 
after only three years. Not only is the channel in every major European 
country, but it acts as a kind of index for pan-European trends and fashions 
among its target audience. 
</P>
<P>
One is equally likely to see young people wearing MTV sweat shirts in Lisbon or 
Leningrad, in Barcelona or Bucharest. Additionally, the kinds of products 
advertised on MTV Europe -- Benetton clothes, Swatch watches, Nike or Reebok 
sneakers -- are popular across the Continent. 
</P>
<P>
MTV, then, has become a complex cultural phenomenon with far-reaching 
influence. Not everyone is thrilled by this: Critics charge that the music it 
plays and the fashions and trends it espouses all combine to create a bland, 
Anglo-American flavored "monoculture," which will erode national youth-culture 
differences in the various countries it serves. 
</P>
<P>
An article in the current issue of the London-based style magazine Blitz poses 
the question of whether MTV's real mission is to stamp out "indigenous 
creativity." 
</P>
<P>
MTV Europe initially encountered some resistance, notably from the European 
record companies that, after all, provide the bulk of the channel's programming 
in the form of music videos. "There was a lot of anti-American feeling at the 
start," says executive producer Brent Hansen. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Roedy takes pains to point out that MTV Europe is not an American 
organization. (It is a partnership between Viacom International, which also 
owns MTV in the United States, and London-based media baron Robert Maxwell.) 
"We employ 106 people in five countries," Roedy says, "but only six are 
Americans." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly MTV Europe does not look like the typical American corporation. Its 
head 
</P>
<P>
quarters are a converted 1880s warehouse in a narrow, gloomy, cobbled north 
London thoroughfare, recently renamed Mandela Street by the radical chic ruling 
group on the local council. "For this I gave up a home on the beach in Santa 
Monica and a 42nd-floor corner office in Century City with an ocean view," says 
Roedy, who was previously a sales and marketing vice president with HBO. 
</P>
<P>
The differences go deeper. On MTV Europe's payroll are employees from 14 
nationalities, according to press director Christine Gorham. She is Austrian; 
Hansen is a New Zealanders. Maiken Wexo, who is arguably the channel's 
best-known veejay, is Danish; her colleague Kristiane Backer is German. 
</P>
<P>
"We encourage people to speak more than one language when they work here," 
Gorham says, "even if they don't speak it perfectly." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the charge of cultural imperialism has stung Roedy enough for him to 
address it head-on when he talks to officials from different countries who are 
considering taking MTV on board. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell them we're not here to blend or blur cultures, we're here to enhance 
cultures," he says. "When I'm in France, which is the most extreme on this 
issue, I quote De Gaulle: No one can expect to bring together a country which 
has 265 different kinds of cheeses." 
</P>
<P>
But De Gaulle also envisioned a Europe that stretched from the Atlantic to the 
Urals. MTV's burgeoning empire stretches 3,000 miles further east, to 
Vladivostok. How can one playlist encompass music to accommodate the youthful 
population of such a huge land mass? 
</P>
<P>
"We're positioning ourselves as a multicultural channel," says Hansen, 35, 
whose curly shoulder-length mane contrasts with Roedy's trim, military bearing. 
"But what we are looking for are potential artists we can break in an 
international arena." 
</P>
<P>
This might seem to confirm the critics' worst fears of MTV Europe gravitating 
toward a bland, smooth-edged brand of "Euro-pop" with no discernible geographic 
roots. Hansen concedes that before he joined the channel, "I regarded MTV as 
the enemy" for precisely those reasons. Now, he says, he sees things 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not an access channel, and I'm not in favor of playing a video that 
doesn't look great," he says. "That's patronizing. Just because there's a group 
from Czechoslovakia with a video doesn't mean they'll get on MTV Europe. If the 
video isn't as good as it should be, they'll embarrass us and they'll embarrass 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"But, for instance, there is a group from Yugoslavia, called Laibach, who did a 
good cover of the Stones' 'Sympathy for the Devil.' They might conceivably 
release something we would put on the playlist." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than trying to find a bland lowest common denominator in the music 
offered by the channel, Hansen says his job involves "making sure that 
something will work in Britain and in Yugoslavia. Or in Finland and in Greece." 
</P>
<P>
He gives MTV Europe credit for helping break the Creeps, a Swedish band whose 
"Ooh I Like It" found favor with MTV Europe viewers from many countries. The 
workers in Mandela Street believe they helped launch the career of the visually 
arresting Sinead O'Connor. Hansen thinks the channel helped black rock singer 
Lenny Kravitz: "I think we also encouraged MTV in the States to focus on him," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
The notion that MTV Europe takes its creative cues from its American parent 
channel makes Hansen bridle. All but three shows on MTV Europe are its own 
original programming. "I fiercely believe we have a better MTV than they do in 
the States," he says. Hansen also points out that MTV Europe had its own rap 
show, called "Yo!" since its inception three years ago, before the idea caught 
on for MTV's "Yo! MTV Raps" in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, New York-based MTV boss Tom Freston warmly praises MTV Europe as 
the most flourishing growth area in the channel's rush toward global 
domination. Certainly young Europeans have proved enthusiastic about MTV 
Europe, and in heavily cabled countries like Belgium and Holland, Wexo, Backer 
and English vee-jay Paul King are capable of stopping traffic. Meanwhile 
Roedy's team concentrates on consolidating such key Western European 
territories as Germany and Britain -- with some success. In the month of 
September alone, MTV Europe added more than 1.1 million households to its 
empire -- the largest growth for any single month to date. 
</P>
<P>
But Roedy, the former Cold Warrior and Vietnam vet, cannot resist returning to 
the implications of the channel's ventures in Eastern Europe. "I took the tack 
that we're European, not American," he says, "but in Eastern Europe, they 
didn't care at all. They actually wanted more American programming -- because 
they'd had so much Russian programming rammed down their throats for so long." 
</P>
<P>
Recalling the minutiae of the Soviet deal, Roedy says: "I told them, 'If you 
are serious about glasnost and perestroika, and you want to send a signal to 
Western business and industry leaders, there's no better sign to say how 
serious you are than embracing MTV.' " 
</P>
<P>
This was well received. Mark Conneely, a network development manager who 
participated in the lengthy discussions, reports that the Soviet delegation 
glowingly described MTV as "the Coca-Cola of music television." 
</P>
<P>
The channel's entry into the Soviet Union, Roedy reflects, was "more than a 
cultural breakthrough -- it's an economic breakthrough too. They gave us a nice 
amount of troubles. But we are selling eight minutes an hour to advertisers, 
and we are turning around and giving two minutes back to the U.S.S.R. They get 
hard currency, which they badly need, and we get exposure in 88 million 
households. 
</P>
<P>
"The advertisers jumped on it -- L.A. Gear, Stimorol chewing gum, Benetton, 
Renault cars, Wrangler jeans. What I find significant is that not all these 
companies even have distribution in the Soviet Union yet. We have a one-year 
deal in the Soviet Union, so clearly they're laying the seeds for the future." 
</P>
<P>
MTV Europe also takes some credit for encouraging corporations and their 
advertising agencies to buy air time on a pan-American basis, reflecting the 
channel's scope, rather than doing deals country by country. 
</P>
<P>
Its advances continue, apparently unchecked. Israel and Iceland are the latest 
territories to sign on the dotted line with MTV Europe; Roedy has big hopes for 
Israel, which is heavily cabled. Talks are now being held with Turkey; the next 
region for channel to conquer is the North African coast. 
</P>
<P>
If pressed, Roedy will claim that TV has played its part in the astonishing 
political changes in Eastern Europe in the last 18 months. "I do believe 
there's been a hand in the changes caused by TV and satellite 
telecommunications and deregulation -- which mean you simply can't have the 
barriers you once had. 
</P>
<P>
"In Russia, you could watch TV and be fooled. You could have all your military 
and space achievements and heroes and not realize you were living in what's 
almost a Third World country. But not any more. Now there's a free flow of 
information -- and it can't be blocked out."

EDIE BRICKELL'S SENSITIVE SONGS WITH THE NEW BOHEMIANS MAY BE TOO SWEET FOR 
SOME TASTES, BUT HEY, WHAT IS COOL, ANYWAY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"I don't think it's uncool to write about squirrels!" protested Edie Brickell 
-- gently and decidedly -- when asked if it ever struck her that a song like 
"Oak Creek Bra," about a woman in her brassiere on her front porch watching 
rural rodents darting across the road in front of station wagons, might be 
perceived in some urban rock camps as, well, a little unhip. 
</P>
<P>
Writing about squirrels isn't the only potentially uncool thing that Brickell, 
leader of the Texas-based band the New Bohemians, has gotten away with. She has 
a guileless persona of the sort that a lot of older bohemians love to hate -- 
charmingly introverted and innocent, apparently unaffected and given to writing 
sweet, sketchy, sensitive verse about life and rocky relationships outside the 
big city. 
</P>
<P>
This unlikeliest of rock stars is an odd combination of gracefulness and 
gangliness, still as much the archetypal poetic college girl as she seemed 
before her surprise Top 10 hit single, "What I Am," took off two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Two and a half million albums, tours with Don Henley and Bob Dylan, and a 
rumored relationship with Paul Simon ("He's a great person and a great friend") 
later, she still hasn't lost her Texas accent or learned how to schmooze. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how playing big halls on the last tour was a change from Dallas clubs, 
she answers: "Well, it's not as hot." 
</P>
<P>
In both settings, her seemingly un-self-conscious performing style remained the 
same, with a stance so famous it's already the stuff of parody: Smile like the 
Mona Lisa, sing standing with one bare foot planted firmly on the ground and 
the other dangling crooked somewhere in the air behind, maintain that 
uncomfortable-looking, peg-legged position for an entire song. 
</P>
<P>
That fame hasn't changed Brickell much should come as a comfort to those who 
relate to her songs as heartfelt and unusually open or unguarded. 
</P>
<P>
There are those who don't, of course; the critical community is divided between 
avid fans and cynical detractors. Spy magazine's October issue, in a trend 
piece titled 
</P>
<P>
"Innocents Amok," grouped her in with Rickie Lee Jones, Suzanne Vega, Stevie 
Nicks, the Roches and Joni Mitchell as part of their mythical "all-waif 
chorale" -- a waif being someone whose deliberately childlike musical world 
view, bare feet and berets Manhattan sophisticates don't buy. 
</P>
<P>
New Bohemians guitarist Kenny Withrow hopes Brickell doesn't get typed as a 
"diary act" -- that is, as one of those artists whose lyrics read a little too 
much like a personal journal. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope Edie's not lumped into that too much," said Withrow in a separate 
interview. "Edie can be serious, and she's not just a little girl writing 
little-girl tunes. She's smart, and she's definitely got it together, and she 
can touch a lot of different subjects and emotions really well. . . . 'What I 
Am' was kind of a quirky, identifiable thing that clicked, but quirkiness isn't 
really what we're about." 
</P>
<P>
Brickell, for her part, claims not to think about her image. She doesn't talk 
to her fans too much or read mail about how her songs might have affected them, 
worrying that "it might make me overly conscientious about what to write about, 
if I take a poll about what people like, what they relate to and what they 
don't." 
</P>
<P>
One aspect of how she's perceived does annoy her, though -- being called shy. 
</P>
<P>
"In general it's something that comes and goes and you can't really get a 
handle on it," she said. "So I don't want to sit here and say, 'Yeah, I'm 
really shy,' because with some people I am and with some people I'm not. And it 
backs me into a corner; it means you're describing yourself somehow, and that's 
limiting. It's never something you want to say about yourself anyway. It's 
uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Brickell, 24, can seem generally uncomfortable in the interview setting. At 
breakfast at a West Hollywood hotel 
</P>
<P>
recently, while in town to shoot a video for the single "Mama Help Me," she was 
able to finish her hot oatmeal with honey and Welch's grape juice (which she 
asks for by brand name) fairly quickly, since her answers tended to be shorter 
than the questions. 
</P>
<P>
There were pauses where she thought long and hard for an answer, before 
deciding that how her music hits people -- pro or con -- is something she 
doesn't even want to ponder. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really want to draw attention to those kinds of things. I want to let 
people think for themselves as far as what they see in the music and how they 
relate to it, and not make any comment on what I want or don't want them to 
see. . . . That's why I kind of edge around these questions." 
</P>
<P>
If Brickell avoids self-consciousness as a rule, the other band members did 
think long and hard about how they were perceived as a group before making 
"Ghost of a Dog," their newly released effort. 
</P>
<P>
The New Bohemians existed as a largely improvisational, jazzy, bluesy 
instrumental outfit well before Brickell was coaxed -- under the influence of 
Jack Daniels, she has recalled -- into joining them on a Dallas club stage one 
night. They'd been trained at music schools and raised on Miles Davis and the 
Dead; Brickell, by contrast, was a wholly inexperienced SMU art-major dropout 
who'd never performed in public before that fateful evening. 
</P>
<P>
So it was humbling when the record company insisted on appending Brickell's 
name to the group's, and the producer of their debut replaced them with studio 
musicians on some tracks, subduing their strong live sound in the process. 
</P>
<P>
This time, said Withrow, "We definitely wanted to be taken a bit more seriously 
. . . maybe even rock out a little. It would be nice to appeal with this album 
to the college scene . . . people our age. I mean, hopefully we're representing 
something of our generation." 
</P>
<P>
Brickell, though, almost seems like a premature member of the thirtysomething 
generation at times, so it's not hard to 
</P>
<P>
imagine why the New Bohemians claim more baby-boomers than college-radio 
hepcats as fans. It's easier to picture her as the stay-at-home-and-hearth, 
poetry-by-the-fireside type in sweater and jeans than it is in her actual 
occupation as pop star. 
</P>
<P>
If she's an unlikely rocker, she seems like a probable pet owner if ever there 
was one. The first album had her drawing of a cat on the cover, and the new one 
-- pesky road squirrels and an occasional bird or cow aside -- is filled with 
recurring canines, including the title dead one. 
</P>
<P>
So the question begs itself. To paraphrase the Marx Brothers: Why a dog? 
</P>
<P>
"I was writing a lot of the lyrics to my songs in my apartment with my door 
open at night, and I could hear dogs barking, I guess," Brickell said. "Maybe 
they just kinda subconsciously slipped through. It was the music 
</P>
<P>
that was happening from the street and in my neighborhood when I was writing 
this stuff. That's the only explanation I can come up with. Plus, I just think 
there's something so innocent about 'em. Or, you know, they're like . . . just 
sweet." 
</P>
<P>
She doesn't own a dog, though. "I used to have a cat, but he got run over. I 
can smile about it now, but it hurt a lot." That can be heavy, it's dutifully 
noted. "It is heavy! It was rotten." 
</P>
<P>
Brickell spends more time on "Ghost of a Dog" singing about rotten 
relationships. At the end, she's "a prisoner of freedom" in "Me by the Sea," a 
wonderful evocation of that universally weird feeling of cherishing solitude 
and wishing for someone to share it with -- "I'm glad no one's here, just me by 
the sea / But man, I wish I had a hand to hold." 
</P>
<P>
You can almost hear Spy magazine's editors gagging. Still, Brickell's music 
seems genuinely disingenuous, and her ability to write wisely about the bad 
stuff of romance with a marked lack of anger toward the opposite sex makes her 
unique and -- for post-modern romantics -- endearing. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, anger's so much of a waste of time," Brickell said, "and unless I'm 
super-angry, I don't feel the need to express it and put more of it out there 
in any kind of form. I want people to feel moved, but not to get riled up 
listening to somebody else's anger. I don't think that's much fun. Not for me, 
anyway. I do want to hit some emotional corners, but there's enough anger in 
the street and on the news. I don't want to put it on my stereo. . . . Unless 
it's funny. If it's funny-angry, then I like it." 
</P>
<P>
Mightn't she make herself a target by revealing so much? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel vulnerable, really. It feels good to express things that I feel 
like everybody feels. I don't think these songs are overly personal or show 
anything but human feelings. I don't feel exposed or anything. I don't think 
I'm that different from anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Having sold several million more records than the average anybody-else, though, 
has success taught her any life lessons? 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important not to make room for any huge negative experiences. 
Sometimes, I know, they just happen, but if I don't allow 'em much room in my 
thoughts, then it makes it harder for 'em to creep into my life. That's 
something I've learned." 
</P>
<P>
And, perhaps sensing that that sounded a little too New Agey -- or maybe a 
little too waif-like -- she added, "Maybe, though, I've just been really 
lucky."

ENTIRE COUNTY BRACES FOR NORTHROP CLOSING; 
</P>
<P>
NEWBURY PARK: TO GAUGE THE REAL EFFECT ON THE ECONOMY OF THE LOSS OF 1,800 
JOBS, EXPERTS MULTIPLY EACH DOLLAR IN LOST WAGES AT LEAST THREE TIMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When Northrop Corp. closes its Newbury Park plant next year, the departure of 
1,800 jobs will deliver an economic shock to the Conejo Valley that may ripple 
across Ventura County, business leaders and unemployment experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop's decision to transfer 1,000 workers and eliminate 800 other jobs is 
the most significant sign so far that the county's aerospace industry has begun 
a downward spiral driven by cuts in the nation's defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
It also adds another load to the county's weakening economy that has so far 
managed to resist slipping into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to talk of gloom and doom, but it certainly is a big blow," said Ralph 
Schumacher, an aerospace executive and president of the Ventura County Economic 
Development Assn. "I see it as hurting the economy across the board, and more 
in the immediate area because of the housing market." 
</P>
<P>
Not counting the two Navy bases, the defense industry now supports 11,400 jobs, 
about 4.6% of the county's total employment. Three years ago, the industry had 
14,300 workers. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop is not the only major defense contractor to pull out of Ventura County 
this year. In May, Raytheon Co. closed its missile-tracking equipment plant in 
Oxnard, laying off 400 people. The facility had been a major employer in Oxnard 
since the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Various divisions of Unisys Corp. in Camarillo have cut their work force by 
half. "They said they laid off 550 employees and there may be more when it is 
said and done," said Nancy Williams, director of the county's Economic 
Development Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Abex's plant in Oxnard, which manufactures aircraft pumps and valves, has laid 
off 60 people from its 940-person staff since the beginning of the year, said 
Joseph Parsons, the firm's vice president of human resources. "Every company 
that has a significant defense business has to tighten up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, despite official denials, Northrop officials have spent months weighing 
the decision to consolidate the 28-year-old Newbury Park plant with operations 
in Hawthorne and Pico Rivera, and in Perry, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the company laid off 116 workers and has not filled more than 50 vacant 
positions. Last week, the company said it will terminate 800 more jobs, 400 
through layoffs and 400 through attrition. 
</P>
<P>
Area unemployment officials, who have witnessed a 30% increase in unemployment 
claims in recent months, are bracing themselves for another wave of jobless 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly isn't good news," said Larry Kennedy, one of several unemployment 
and job-training experts who met with Northrop officials on Friday. Kennedy, 
who manages the closest unemployment office in Simi Valley, said Northrop's 
current plans to phase in layoffs over many months will make it easier to 
assimilate employees into the work force. 
</P>
<P>
The Simi Valley office's popular job club, which helps workers find new 
employment, is already swamped with applicants, mostly from the defense 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll find room somehow," said Madeleine Brockwell, the club's coordinator. 
With an average of 60 new people a month, the club has started a short waiting 
list for membership, she said. "We are not large enough to handle all the 
people who want help." 
</P>
<P>
Unemployment officials say they are encouraged that Northrop plans to establish 
its own job-placement center and offer 1,000 of its Newbury Park employees an 
opportunity to transfer to other plants. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear how many of these employees, most of whom live within minutes of 
Newbury Park, will agree to a round-trip commute -- of at least two hours and 
possibly four hours in traffic -- to Hawthorne, 49 miles away, or Pico Rivera, 
61 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Some senior managers, who often make the trip to Hawthorne for meetings, say 
they would rather commute than move to the Los Angeles basin. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my home, I have no desire to move to that area," said Lawrence Horner, 
a Northrop vice president and Thousand Oaks city councilman. He predicted that 
many of his colleagues will not move because of their ties to the community. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us live out here because we love it," said Daryl Reynolds, wife of Don 
Reynolds, a Northrop manager. As president of the Westlake High School PTA, she 
said she would be loath to move, especially with her son on the Westlake 
football team. "But I must tell you that if my husband wants to move, we'll 
move." 
</P>
<P>
If hundreds of Northrop employees are forced to relocate, real estate experts 
fear that their departure will further depress the slumped housing market. 
</P>
<P>
They are particularly concerned that dumping houses on a saturated market may 
hurt the viability of three nearby housing developments, Dos Vientos, MGM Ranch 
and Lang Ranch. "It's a terrible time," said Steve Rubenstein, president of the 
Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Lamb, president of Lamb Realty, said he has witnessed other plant closures 
in the area and estimates that 300-400 houses will be listed over the next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see people being desperate about it," said Lamb, the largest broker in 
the area. "I know of at least 30 listings we've had for a few months for people 
who have been anticipating this." 
</P>
<P>
By pulling out of the county, Northrop will not only displace its own workers, 
economists say. Philip Bohan, economic development manager for the Job Training 
Policy Council in Ventura, said that to calculate the ripple effect on the 
area's economy, economists multiply every dollar in lost wages at least three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
That so-called ripple effect could cost jobs at companies that supply Northrop 
with everything from metal fasteners to toilet paper. 
</P>
<P>
"With them closing, it's going to definitely hurt," said Darlene Mongeon, owner 
of Mongeon's Deli on Rancho Conejo Boulevard. Northrop employees comprise 
nearly a third of her customers and she is anticipating a $1,000-a-month drop 
in business. "We'd have to lay off employees," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Wood of the Employment Development Department in Oxnard said the smaller 
companies that provide the Newbury Park plant with materials to make parts for 
747s, missiles and target drones for the military will be particularly hard 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of small companies that serve Northrop in the area, the 
machine shop around the corner and the circuit board shop across the street," 
Wood said. Wherever Northrop moves, he said, the company will find more 
convenient suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Greywitt, a Northrop spokesman, said company officials are trying to 
reassure their contractors that nothing has changed. "It is business as usual 
for all suppliers," he said. "We are not shutting the whole place down. It is 
being phased in throughout an entire year." 
</P>
<P>
But such statements do not comfort area leaders, who heard months of official 
denials that a pullout was imminent. "It will affect business in the area 
significantly," said Fred Raio, president of First State Bank of the Oaks, 
which is based in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city of Thousand Oaks is moving to make up for the loss. It is 
wooing companies that might be interested in moving into the area or possibly 
even purchasing Northrop's 670,000-square-foot plant on Rancho Conejo 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Grant W. Brimhall said one high-tech company is in escrow for land 
in the area. Although he declined to name the company, he said it could bring 
as many as 700 jobs to the area, possibly some for Northrop employees. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop, the county's 10th largest defense contractor, employs 950 engineers, 
managers or other professionals, 500 skilled and semiskilled workers and 300 
clerical workers in Newbury Park. The company has kept mum on who will be 
transferred and who will be laid off. 
</P>
<P>
The Northrop decision follows layoffs at about two dozen other companies 
affecting 3,400 employees in the last 18 months, Bohan said. "A big chunk of it 
is defense-related, but we have had other hits in manufacturing and 
electronics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As the county has developed, its economy has become diversified into retail and 
service industries, government, agriculture, oil and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the county economy goes, there is room to absorb some of the 
Northrop folks," Bohan said. "But it won't be as easy as it has been."

When Northrop Corp. announced the closure of its Newbury Park plant, it was a 
doubly bad blow for the Mongeon family. 
</P>
<P>
Darlene Mongeon, 53, opened a small deli near Northrop more than three years 
ago to cater to the bustling lunchtime crowd. But the business, her only source 
of income, could drop by almost a third when the plant closes by the end of 
1991, she said. 
</P>
<P>
And Mongeon's 30-year-old son, who works at Northrop, will be transferred or 
laid off when the plant closes in June. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a rough time," she said. "It's going to hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Northrop workers are still grappling with the reality that they will be laid 
off or transferred to plants in Hawthorne or Pico Rivera. The closure affects 
1,800 workers at the Newbury Park plant. About 1,000 are to be transferred to 
Pico Rivera and Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
About 400 workers from Newbury Park are to receive layoff notices next year. 
Officials expect that another 400 Newbury Park workers faced with a transfer 
may seek to retire or leave on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Don Mongeon, who has conducted X-ray and ultrasonic testing at Northrop for 
nine years, tried to sell his three-bedroom house in Thousand Oaks before the 
plant closure was announced. But the real estate market has been so bad that 
his house remains unsold after six months. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing about it is, it's the worst time of year" to sell a house, 
said Mongeon, who has three children. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really tough right now," he said. "It's going to be a grim Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Horner, a Northrop vice president and Thousand Oaks city councilman, 
said he expects many top Northrop managers to stay in Thousand Oaks and commute 
two or three hours a day to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Horner, who has lived in Thousand Oaks for 22 years, already commutes to 
Hawthorne two to three days a week from a home in the North Ranch area of 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop has pledged to provide some relocation assistance, including temporary 
housing, based on the number of years an employee has worked at the company, 
officials said. But the company has refused to elaborate on how much assistance 
workers will be given. Northrop already has offered to bus workers to Pico 
Rivera or Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Fernandes, president of the Northrop Ventura Employees Union, predicted 
that many of the 800 hourly workers the union represents will turn down any 
offer of jobs at the company's other plants and seek aerospace jobs in Seattle, 
Wash., where The Boeing Co. is based. 
</P>
<P>
Some workers are fearful that a move to the other Northrop plants might put 
them in communities with high crime rates, gangs and more traffic congestion, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Newbury Park plant is known at the other Northrop facilities as "The 
Country Club," Fernandes said. 
</P>
<P>
Other workers are wondering how to uproot children from their schools and 
spouses from jobs. Four days before her nine-year anniversary at Northrop, 
32-year-old Lynda Daily got the news that she could be laid off or transferred. 
</P>
<P>
Although she has no house to sell, Daily is worried about how a move would 
affect her children. 
</P>
<P>
If she and others decide to stay in the area and have to leave their homes 
before dawn to drive to the other facilities, they would have to find new 
day-care arrangements, Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
"What am I going to do with my little girl?" she said. "Nobody's going to want 
to take a child at 4:30 in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
Daily said she is also afraid that the job she has been promised will not 
materialize. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm scared. I really don't want to go down to Pico Rivera," she said. "But I'm 
hoping and praying I have a job to go to."

WIND-FED FIRE DESTROYS 330 APARTMENTS; 
</P>
<P>
THOUSAND OAKS: AN ERRANT SPARK TOUCHES OFF FLAMES THAT TAKE FIREFIGHTERS SEVEN 
HOURS TO CONTAIN. THE COMPLEX WAS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

<P>
A fire sparked by a plumber's torch raged through 22 luxury apartment buildings 
in Thousand Oaks on Saturday afternoon, injuring two firefighters and causing 
at least $7 million damage. 
</P>
<P>
Fed by gusting 25 m.p.h. winds, the blaze erupted shortly before 3 p.m. and 
quickly consumed 330 of the 544 apartments at The Knolls on Avenida de los 
Arboles. 
</P>
<P>
About 240 firefighters from Ventura and Los Angeles counties fought the fire 
into the night. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was contained about 10 p.m., but firefighters didn't expect to have it 
out until this morning. Firefighters couldn't get equipment close enough to two 
burning apartment houses. "The buildings are too unstable to get people close 
to them," said John Wade, Ventura County Fire Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Only charred, smoldering scaffolding remained in portions of the complex where 
firefighters allowed the blaze to burn itself out while they tried to save 
other structures. No occupied apartments were destroyed. Some of the apartment 
buildings were still under construction. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Fire Capt. Larry Henry was taken to Los Robles Medical Center 
suffering from heat exhaustion and smoke inhalation, fire officials said. He 
was treated and released. An unidentified, off-duty Los Angeles firefighter who 
lives in Ventura County was also injured in the blaze but was not treated. 
</P>
<P>
Fire investigator Bill Hager said the blaze was ignited on the first floor of a 
building by a plumber using a torch to solder a piece of plastic pipe. 
</P>
<P>
The plumber realized too late that the flames had raced to the second floor, 
Hager said. A security guard at the site said the plumber came screaming out of 
the building to warn him of the spreading blaze, and he contacted the Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials declined to identify the plumber employed by Interstate Plumbing 
Inc., at the company's request. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters struggled to quench the fire from the only two accessible fire 
hydrants in the complex. Other hydrants were quickly engulfed by the flames, 
and firefighters were driven back by the searing heat. 
</P>
<P>
"The radiant heat from this fire was unbelievable," Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
One Ventura County fire captain said his crew had trouble attacking the blaze 
because of poor water pressure. 
</P>
<P>
When hydrants on hand failed, firefighters set up a modern-day bucket brigade, 
a "relay" of five or six firetrucks, linked up to pump water from hydrants in a 
housing complex more than a quarter of a mile from the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Water mains within The Knolls were apparently either broken or shut off, fire 
engineer Karry Ellison said. Fire officials will investigate whether the mains 
were broken, or whether they had been shut off while plumbing work was being 
done, Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters were aided by two helicopters that whizzed over the area, dumping 
water on the flames. 
</P>
<P>
A five-acre brush fire was started southwest of the construction site by embers 
from the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey L. Stack, president of Regis Homes Corp. in Newport Beach, said the 
initial damage estimate of $7 million does not include vehicles and 
construction equipment destroyed in the inferno. 
</P>
<P>
Regis is the contractor and partial owner of the project in partnership with 
Lang Ranch Co. The entire project is valued at $40 million, Stack said. 
</P>
<P>
Stack declined to comment on any action that might be taken against Interstate 
Plumbing Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is an unfortunate thing. It appears to be accidental," Stack 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was deeply disappointed. "We have people planning to move in and 
make this their home." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Green, manager of Lang Ranch Co., said: "We'll clean it up, and get it 
built as soon as we can." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the fire was one of the biggest structure fires to hit the 
eastern part of the county in more than 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big loss. It's a real big loss," Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer said she saw thick black smoke curling 
above the hills near her Thousand Oaks home and raced to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's been a fire in Thousand Oaks with this kind of 
destruction in 16 years," Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
The apartments destroyed in the blaze were touted by the developer's 
promotional brochures as a resort-like complex with racquetball and tennis 
courts, spas, swimming pools and saunas. None of the recreational facilities 
were destroyed in the fire, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Kleiner, a secretary for Regis Homes Corp., who raced to the fire when it 
began, said construction on the project began in January. The complex was to 
open for occupancy on Nov. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Kleiner said about 80 units had been rented for $700 to $1,200 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Despite roadblocks set up by authorities, the blaze drew hundreds of 
bystanders. Some hiked and bicycled over hills to watch the flames and 
billowing smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials did not evacuate nearby residences. At one point as the fire 
threatened to race over dry hills south of the development, firefighters 
considered evacuating a home for cerebral palsy patients in the North Ranch 
area of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was so hot it melted firefighting equipment on fire engines, Ventura 
County Fire Capt. Keith Mashburn said. One engine had to be sent back to its 
station because of heat damage. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of fire that needed tremendous amount of water," Mashburn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said the fire was able to consume unprotected wood on 
half-finished homes. Some of the apartments escaped destruction because they 
were protected by tile roofs.

SEEING IGNORANCE AS THE ENEMY, BUSINESS TAKES A STAB AT FIXING SCHOOLS

Almost everyone has an opinion about public education in California, including 
a group of chief executives from the state's largest corporations, who have 
been working quietly with the Legislature to reform the public school system. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, Gov. George Deukmejian signed a school reform bill sponsored by 
the 92-member California Roundtable. A study commissioned by the Roundtable 
showed that California public schools had the seventh-highest dropout rate in 
the nation. The bill, introduced by state Sen. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara), 
appropriated $6.8 million for a "demonstration program to restructure public 
education." The funds would be distributed to more than 150 schools and 220,000 
students, according to a legislative analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Local school districts are eligible for educational improvement grants if they 
meet a four-point test: 
</P>
<P>
* They must develop teaching strategies that promote English language skills 
for all students and also "offer opportunities for proficiency in two or more 
languages." 
</P>
<P>
* Once core requirements such as reading and math are met, students in the 11th 
and 12th grades should have the option to participate in alternative programs 
such as vocational and technical education, college preparation or specialized 
performing arts programs. Dubbed the "post-10 option," a similar program is 
working in Minnesota, where participating students outperform regular students. 
</P>
<P>
* Districts must develop ways for involving parents in the school's decisions. 
The Roundtable report recommended that community boards be formed -- including 
parents and business leaders -- at individual schools and that they have legal 
authority to approve school programs. The bill doesn't go that far, but it 
encourages districts to give parents more authority in choosing programs and 
classes for their children. 
</P>
<P>
* The use of computer technology must be expanded in the classroom. Also, 
computers should be used to increase teacher productivity by reducing time 
spent on chores such as record keeping. 
</P>
<P>
Roundtable members have committed to working with school districts receiving 
grants to help implement the changes. 
</P>
<P>
And what's in it for business? 
</P>
<P>
"If you take a long-term view of the state's economy, it's the people part of 
the equation that will make the difference," said Jere Jacobs, assistant vice 
president of Pacific Telesis Group and a member of the Roundtable. "We are 
highly dependent on the skills of our young people -- not only from colleges 
but from what happens K through 12." 
</P>

'Political Building' Succeeds for Architects 
</P>
<P>
The California Council of the American Institute of Architects got a political 
education four years ago, when Gov. Deukmejian vetoed a measure that would have 
made it easier for architects to collect unpaid bills. The lessons: Don't take 
the governor for granted, be prepared to rev up grass-roots political support 
and hire well-connected help. 
</P>
<P>
More mature about how things work in Sacramento, the architects had developed a 
sophisticated political game plan before a similar bill reached the governor's 
desk in September. The measure permits licensed architects to place a lien on 
private property for nonpayment of design services on projects where 
construction hasn't begun. 
</P>
<P>
First, the AIA agreed to amend the old bill, even though the governor didn't 
seem to leave much room in his 1986 veto message for compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not received any compelling evidence to support the expansion of the 
existing mechanic's lien laws proposed by this measure," Deukmejian said four 
years ago. He added that design professionals "can sue a property owner for 
breach of contract, should the owner fail to pay for services rendered." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the 1986 bill was amended to exempt residential projects that 
cost less than $100,000. This change was made to satisfy concerns of the 
Department of Consumer Affairs, said Judy Sektnan, director of government 
relations for the AIA. The state agency was worried that homeowners might be 
threatened with liens for unpaid bills on home repair jobs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
After successfully moving the measure through the legislature, "we began doing 
some political building," said Sektnan. The 6,794-member trade group initiated 
a letter-writing campaign that saturated the governor's office with tales of 
woe from architects who were cheated out of their fees. Some 252 letters 
favoring the legislation reached Deukmejian's desk. 
</P>
<P>
The final ingredient in the AIA's political strategy was to make certain that 
it got the governor's attention. The architects hired the influential political 
lobbying firm Nielsen, Merksamer, Hodgson, Parrinello &amp; Mueller, to promote 
the merits of the legislation in the governor's office. Noted principals of the 
firm include Deukmejian's former chief of staff, Steve Merksamer; Timothy 
Flanigan, the governor's former appointments secretary, and former California 
GOP Chairman Robert W. Naylor. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure they (the firm) helped," Sektnan explained. "This is a difficult governor 
to get access to. It's an important bill, and we wanted to make certain he got 
all of the information," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently he did. Deukmejian signed the bill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tax Board Revamps Its Sexist Computer 
</P>
<P>
The Franchise Tax Board is installing a new software program that will 
eliminate sexism in its computer system. The new system will stop singling out 
the man's name when identifying how tax refund checks for a married couple 
should be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, when a female taxpayer had a different name from her spouse or a 
hyphenated name, the computer would recognize the wife's first name but assume 
that her last name was the same as her husband's. Some women whose last names 
differed from their spouses complained about being unable to cash their refund 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
But for the most part, the change "was a matter of principle," said Tax Board 
spokesman Jim Reber. "We had a chauvinistic computer system for 20 years that 
identified the husband as the primary spouse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After more than 10 years of complaints, the board began revamping the computer 
system this fall. Scheduled to go into effect next year, the change "does away 
with the stigma of women as second-class taxpayers," said Rebecca Taylor, vice 
president of the California Taxpayer's Assn.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / ALLAN H. MELTZER: SOVIETS UNLIKELY TO AVERT 
STAGNATION AND INFLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Will the Soviet Union make a successful transition to a market economy? 
Opinions differ and, like much else about economic changes in the Soviet Union, 
a lot depends on the meaning of the words used by different people. 
</P>
<P>
Phrases such as private property, price stability and market economy often do 
not have the same meaning for Soviet officials and economists as for 
Westerners. And even within the Soviet Union there are major differences. 
</P>
<P>
It was my good fortune to be in Moscow in mid-September with the Global 
Economic Action Conference while the great debate about the 500 days' reform 
took place in the Soviet parliament. The issues appeared to be not only whether 
radical reforms would be made or, once again, postponed, but whether the 
radical reformers would come to power. 
</P>
<P>
But this is somewhat misleading. Even the radical reformers offer a program 
that is much too modest to solve the major problems of the Soviet economy. For 
example, a major issue is whether there is to be private property. The 
so-called radicals want to permit private ownership of land and apartments. On 
closer reading, it turns out that often the meaning of private ownership is 
highly restricted. Apartments and land would be sold, but only on condition 
that they would not be resold -- except to the state. Because housing is 
heavily subsidized, many Soviet renters see this as an attempt to reduce 
subsidies, not as a way of encouraging investment and production to reduce the 
chronic housing shortage. 
</P>
<P>
The more basic problem is that major problems are not addressed adequately 
either in public discussion or in the "radical" proposals. 
</P>
<P>
One is the problem of repressed inflation, which appears to be getting worse. 
This is the problem of stabilizing a properly constructed general or average 
price level. 
</P>
<P>
Second is the problem of achieving commodity prices that are related to costs 
of production and consumer or producer demands. Here the problem is to get not 
stability but flexibility of individual prices, many of which have been 
unchanged for decades. 
</P>
<P>
Third is encouragement of competition. There are many ways in which competition 
could be increased. One of the most effective steps would be to permit imports 
and allow convertibility of the ruble. 
</P>
<P>
There is much talk about developing a market economy, but at the highest levels 
there seems to be little awareness of what is involved. Internal discussion 
does not recognize that there are successful and unsuccessful market economies, 
or why some succeed. In contrast with such relatively successful economies as 
the United States, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan, there is Argentina or 
Brazil, where competition is limited and where inflation and hyper-inflation 
distort decisions and impede progress toward efficiency and higher living 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
My impression is that even if the radical reform proposals are adopted, the 
Soviet economy is more likely to reach an "Argentine solution" than to achieve 
stable prices and growth. There are several ominous signs. 
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit is estimated at 15% to 20% of gross national product. No one 
can be very precise, since neither GNP nor the budget is calculated reliably. 
But many estimates lie in this range. Aside from defense, much of the spending 
goes for subsidies to producers and consumers. The only program for removing 
some of these subsidies calls for higher prices that would reduce living 
standards. But closing, or substantially reducing, the budget deficit would 
require substantial cuts in living standards and unemployment. The reformers 
are cautious about reducing subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
Since there is no capital market and very little saving to finance the deficit, 
most is financed by printing rubles. Unofficial estimates put inflation at 20% 
this year and money growth at 25% to 30% and rising. With output falling, it 
will be hard to hold inflation at current levels without major reductions in 
spending and subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
There are signs that a flight from money has started. The government has 
devalued the tourist ruble to about 17 cents, 10% of its official value. On the 
black market that thrives in the large cities, the ruble sells for about 
one-third of the tourist rate (or less), about 3% of the official rate. 
</P>
<P>
Most taxi drivers refuse to accept the ruble; their business is done in 
cigarettes, dollars and other convertible currency. Street vendors sell 
watches, army binoculars and other goods only for hard currency. This illegal 
activity is widespread in Moscow, and I found it in areas as remote as 
Uzbekistan in Soviet Central Asia. 
</P>
<P>
The current inflation is more damaging because it is repressed, not open. Since 
prices remain controlled, goods disappear from the established markets to 
reappear in the black markets. This longtime feature of the Soviet economy has 
become more widespread. Goods must be hunted down, and many can be purchased 
only on the black market. 
</P>
<P>
With wages controlled, living standards fall, adding to the widespread 
discontent. Freeing prices without introducing competition, which at first must 
come mainly from abroad, will not move the economy toward a rational system. 
There is no relation between prices, costs of production and demand. The 
proposals for reform do not deal with this central problem of establishing not 
just markets but competitive markets. 
</P>
<P>
The command economy no longer functions as it once did. The crops were good 
this year, possibly a record. But the harvest is poor. In the past, people 
would be ordered into the fields to collect the harvest. That method is no 
longer as widely used, and it has not been replaced by a functioning price 
system. So, much of the crop will rot in the field, and food will be scarce 
this winter. 
</P>
<P>
When money does not buy goods, it loses its value and its ability to motivate 
people to work and produce. The Soviet Union has not reached that condition, 
but it seems headed in that direction. None of the debates taking place in 
Moscow seemed designed to reverse course. 
</P>
<P>
As we left Moscow, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev talked of taking control and 
ruling by decree, and soon after he did so. Given his record of vacillation and 
error in economic policy, that is not a promising development. The "Argentine 
solution" may be postponed by this decision, but the Soviet Union is unlikely 
to prevent the drift toward stagnation and rapid inflation that appears to be 
gaining momentum.

POLYSTYRENE FOAM JUST WANTS A LITTLE RESPECT FROM ENVIRONMENTALISTS; 
</P>
<P>
PACKAGING: MAKERS OF THE USEFUL BUT ECOLOGICALLY UNPOPULAR WHITE MATERIAL ARE 
TRYING NEW METHODS OF RECYCLING TO HELP IMPROVE THE PRODUCT'S IMAGE.

<P>
Despite its setbacks with McDonald's switch to paper packaging, the polystyrene 
foam industry sees progress behind the scenes and promising technological help 
for efforts to change the product's public image. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials hope to do this primarily by persuading the public that 
polystyrene foam, unlike waxed- or plastic-coated paper, already can be 
recycled. 
</P>
<P>
"Our industry has been behind in recycling, but we're catching up very 
quickly," says Larry E. Rembold, president of Dolco Packaging Corp. in Sherman 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Dolco, the world's largest producer of foam egg cartons, is a major buyer of 
the least-promising type of recycled polystyrene -- material reprocessed not 
from relatively clean industrial scrap but from such post-consumer products as 
used hamburger packages. 
</P>
<P>
Until last week, Dolco also had produced those clamshell foam containers -- 
from virgin polystyrene -- for McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
The fast-food chain, which yielded last week to a long lobbying campaign and 
announced that it would switch from polystyrene clamshells to more 
environmentally popular paper packaging, accounted for about 10% of the firm's 
$70 million in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pursuing other business and will have to make some cost adjustments 
because of McDonald's decision," Rembold concedes. 
</P>
<P>
But in the long run, he and other observers of the industry say, McDonald's may 
most be missed for the role it might have played in educating the public to the 
attributes of the much-maligned foam material. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have long faulted polystyrene foam on several counts. The 
Washington-based Environmental Action and other groups see serious 
environmental problems in the emissions and effluents involved in its 
transformation from petroleum to plastic. 
</P>
<P>
Yet many environmental groups also have warned lately that producing 
alternative packaging materials, such as paper, also has an environmental cost, 
which should be rigorously examined. 
</P>
<P>
Polystyrene foam also has been blamed as a bulky, nondegradable filler of 
scarce municipal trash dumps, although industry representatives note that the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reports that it takes only 1% of the space 
in the nation's landfills. 
</P>
<P>
"Environmentalists are tired of everyone saying, 'Oh we're just a tiny part of 
the problem,' " says Jerry Powell, editor of Resource Recycling magazine. "No, 
you're not. You're part of the problem too." 
</P>
<P>
But polystyrene foam is most notorious among the environmentally conscious 
because it is so litter-prone. Light, durable, a popular container for takeout 
food -- and easy to spot -- it long has been a highly visible reminder along 
the nation's highways of environmental blight. 
</P>
<P>
Powell recalls the rueful comment of one plastics executive, who, when talking 
to the Portland, Ore., city council, about polystyrene foam said, "If we 
weren't white, it wouldn't be such a problem." 
</P>
<P>
A vigorous recycling effort would stifle many of these complaints. But the 
entire plastics industry has lagged behind other container-materials 
businesses. Of all plastics, only 1% now is recycled; almost none of the 
clamshell foam packs are recycled. 
</P>
<P>
There have been technical problems, particularly for polystyrene foam. In part, 
this can be traced to problems in cleaning food waste from recycled foam 
packages. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Federal Trade Commission doesn't allow use of recycled foam to 
make new food containers, most in the industry feel that there would still be 
deep markets for recycled foam, but only if it can be cleaned to the stringent 
standards demanded before it can be run through narrow extruders used to 
produce new foam. 
</P>
<P>
By mid-January, 1991, however, the National Polystyrene Recycling Co., an 
industry-sponsored consortium, will open its second of several planned 
facilities. That plant, in Corona, will use a new system that cleans even 
food-tainted foam. 
</P>
<P>
The plant will be operated by Talco Recycling Inc., an experienced materials 
recycler. The first plant, in Leominster, Mass., has successfully cleaned used 
foam for more than two years, said Phil Fusco, Talco vice president. 
</P>
<P>
NPRC hopes to recycle 25% of all disposable polystyrene products -- foam and 
hard form polystyrene -- by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dart Container Corp., based in Mason, Mich., and the giant of the 
foam cup manufacturers, is about to launch a program to place foam compacting 
machines with food-service operators nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
These machines, called "densifiers," compress used foam containers, making them 
easier to transport and reprocess. 
</P>
<P>
In California, tests are under way at Walt Disney Co. headquarters of a 
densifier for possible use in the company's theme parks, Dart officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Students-UCLA Food Service plans to sign up for what Dart is 
calling its CARE recycling program; the company in August persuaded Los Angeles 
County Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon to keep using foam coffee 
cups in county offices. 
</P>
<P>
Dixon cited polystyrene's ability to retain heat and resist contamination. He 
also touted its economy. In his report to Los Angeles County Supervisors, he 
compared the cost for a thousand cups: $1,030 for glass, $450 for hard plastic, 
$27.50 for wax or plastic-coated paper -- and $9.93 for polystyrene foam. 
</P>
<P>
But cost has been an obstacle to recycling. 
</P>
<P>
The inherent value of recycled foam is so low that a recycling system would not 
work if it were based on waste-producers' potential to make money by selling 
old foam cartons to recyclers. Many in the industry believe that manufacturers 
will inevitably have to subsidize the recycling effort. 
</P>
<P>
But Rembold, of Dolco, still plans to make money on his recycled egg carton 
operations. He will buy recycled, clean foam from the new Talco facility for 45 
cents a pound. That sum includes a subsidy to the collection company of as much 
as 10 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
The recycled material will still be cheaper than the 50 cents a pound he now 
pays for virgin polystyrene. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem now is creating the incentive or the desire for consumers 
to deposit used polystyrene" at collection sites still being created, Rembold 
says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: PUTTING TOGETHER RIGHT 401(K) INVESTMENT MIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's that time of year again, when many employers allow you to change the 
investment mix in your 401(k) company savings plan. Unfortunately, some people 
-- scared of the stock market -- are getting overly conservative with their 
401(k) allocations, forgetting the primary purpose of these popular plans as 
long-term retirement vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid this mistake, be sure you choose a 401(k) investment mix most 
appropriate for your age and financial goals and don't be swayed solely by 
short-term market movements. 
</P>
<P>
Decisions about how to invest 401(k) money are no small matter. Many people 
have amassed tens of thousands of dollars in their plans. No wonder: They are 
one of the best retirement savings vehicles around. Offered by nearly all large 
employers and many small ones, 401(k)s allow you to invest before-tax wages in 
a retirement account that will accumulate earnings on a tax-deferred basis 
until withdrawn. Many employers match your contributions 50 cents for every 
dollar you kick in. 
</P>
<P>
The plans are bound to get even more attractive in the wake of higher tax rates 
for some high-income individuals included in the federal deficit-reduction law 
just passed by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Most employers give you several choices for where to put your 401(k) money. The 
most common alternatives include stock mutual funds, employer stock, government 
bond or other fixed-income funds, money market funds and guaranteed investment 
contracts (GICs). The latter are issued by insurance companies and usually pay 
slightly higher rates than certificates of deposit. Most employers allow 
workers to change their allocations quarterly or semiannually. 
</P>
<P>
Workers have chosen to put most of their money in what they perceive to be the 
safest alternative: GICs. A survey by Hewitt Associates, an employee benefits 
consulting firm, shows that among companies offering GICs as an investment 
option, workers on average invest nearly two-thirds (64%) of their assets in 
GICs. That's nearly twice the amounts in employer stock (33%) and balanced 
stock and bond funds (28%). 
</P>
<P>
And now, thanks to the lackluster stock market, the balance in favor of GICs 
may be increasing even more. Charles Salisbury, a managing director of T. Rowe 
Price Associates, a firm that manages money in 401(k) accounts, estimates that 
about 10% to 12% of 401(k) money invested in stocks is being shifted into 
fixed-income choices such as money market funds or GICs. 
</P>
<P>
That shift could continue because 401(k)s are still relatively new and thus 
many account holders have never faced investment allocation decisions in a 
recessionary environment. There is a tendency in bad times to get conservative 
and forget the long-term view. 
</P>
<P>
But being overly cautious in a retirement plan can be a big mistake if you are 
still many years before retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Although stocks may look rocky in the short term, they almost always do better 
than GICs, money market funds or other fixed-income investments in the long 
run. During the past five, 10, 20 and 50 years, for example, large-company 
stocks have outperformed corporate bonds, Treasury bills and inflation by wide 
margins, according to Ibbotson Associates, a Chicago-based investment research 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
Further, GIC rates are not as attractive as they have been, says Mike Horton, 
consultant in the Santa Ana office of Hewitt Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, by putting too much of your money in conservative investments, you 
probably will deprive yourself of a bigger retirement nest egg over the long 
haul. 
</P>
<P>
"You should not let recent events or uncertainty impact your long-term 
decisions," Salisbury says. "If you are in your early 30s or 40s, equities are 
more appropriate than GICs or money market funds." 
</P>
<P>
Further, the automatic payroll deduction method of investing money in 401(k)s 
-- under which you invest a little every paycheck, a form of dollar cost 
averaging -- tends to reduce the risk of investing in stocks. Your investment 
is spread out over time, thus reducing the chance that you may be buying only 
at the peak of stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
Even still, you don't want to put all your 401(k) money in stocks. How much is 
right for you? Here are some rules of thumb: 
</P>
<P>
* Choose your mix based on your age and how close you are to retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, the younger you are, the longer you can leave your money invested, 
and thus the more you can afford to invest in higher risk assets that have the 
potential of earning a higher return over time. On the other hand, if you are 
retiring within five years, you'll want to be conservative because you don't 
have much time to recover from any short-term losses.

Jonathan D. Pond, president of Financial Planning Information Inc., a 
Watertown, Mass., financial planning publishing firm, suggests as a general 
guide that investors in their 40s or younger have about 50% of their 401(k) 
money in stocks. Investors in their 50s might consider only 40% in equities, 
whereas those within one or two years of retirement might opt for no more than 
20% or 30% in stocks. 
</P>
<P>
* Go for diversification. 
</P>
<P>
Be sure that your stock investments are diversified and not overly concentrated 
in certain industries or even in the United States. Definitely avoid putting 
too much of your money in your employer's stock. If your company has severe 
financial problems, its stock could suffer a big decline that could wipe out 
much of your 401(k) nest egg. 
</P>
<P>
* Look at your 401(k) in conjunction with your other investments. 
</P>
<P>
If you've got all of your non-401(k) money in municipal bonds and Treasury 
bills, it might make sense to invest a higher percentage of your 401(k) in 
stocks, Pond suggests. 
</P>
<P>
* Choose heavily taxed investments for your 401(k). 
</P>
<P>
Because 401(k)s are tax-deferred, it makes sense to put into them investments 
that would otherwise incur heavy periodic tax burdens. That includes mutual 
funds and fixed-income investments other than municipal bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in your non-tax-deferred accounts municipal bonds or low-dividend-paying 
individual stocks. With these you'll incur little or no tax liability unless 
you sell.

PORTRAIT OF A PLANET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine lacy fingers of red coral groping in the silent depths of the Pacific. 
Picture baby seals frolicking on the sun-drenched shores of islands in the 
Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
These are two visions of a planet both beautiful and diverse, unspoiled by 
human activity. Now picture Argentine rivers blackened with oily industrial 
toxins. Imagine Mt. Everest littered with the rusting garbage of countless 
expeditions. These, too, are images of Earth -- and civilization's undeniable 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
 In "One Earth," a collection of color photographs published this month by 
Collins Publishers, 80 photojournalists from around the world have documented 
the gamut of environmental problems, including global warming, pollution, 
deforestation, endangered species and overpopulation. The photographers, many 
of whom contributed to the books "A Day in the Life of America" and "A Day in 
the Life of the Soviet Union," began shooting in August, 1989. Seven months 
later, they had amassed thousands of pictures, producing a dramatic portrait of 
the planet and the state of its fragile natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
"The goal was to present a serious issue in an accessible way, using the power 
of photojournalism," says Kate Kelly, managing editor of the project. "We 
wrestled long and hard with how best to show not only the gravity of the issue 
but also the spirit of hope, the momentum of people worldwide who are trying to 
do something about these problems."

MAN BITES TOWN: CIRCULAR LOGIC; 
</P>

IF WE REPEAT OURSELVES OFTEN ENOUGH, WILL WE FINALLY WISE UP?

<P>
ONE OF THE best arguments in favor of apathy, or at least keeping your old 
clothes, is that everything ends up coming around again. 
</P>
<P>
I don't mean things that are always with us, things that the news weeklies 
declare about every five years to be returning from the dead ("Jazz Is Back!" 
is my personal favorite). But look at the '60s cycle currently delighting the 
fashion industry, which, after 10 years of struggling to revive short skirts, 
is once again selling less garment for more money. (What's not to like?) 
</P>
<P>
Or consider what's happened to the office of the mayor of Los Angeles. Not the 
position, the actual office. Frequently these days, it's empty. Tom Bradley is 
the target of increasing criticism for touring the world, slogging through 
hazardous-duty areas like Paris, London and Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's defenders say such travels are necessary to keep cargo moving 
through the Port of Los Angeles and international visitors pouring through 
Terminal Four at LAX. Bradley is not junketeering, we are advised; he is 
engaged in the hard if subtle work of economic development. 
</P>
<P>
Well, it may be nearing wintertime, but this show is definitely a rerun. 
Precisely the same debate surrounded Bradley's predecessor, Sam Yorty, known to 
some detractors as "Travelin' Sam." I made my first serious money poking fun at 
Yorty's travels, in addition to his syntax and his presidential aspirations, 
and I recall clearly that he defended his skedaddling with the same lofty 
invocation of regional macroeconomics. Apparently, in the high-level world of 
deciding which port to ship stuff through, brochures and videos just aren't 
enough; you need that personal touch. 
</P>
<P>
Travel is nice, especially if you're not paying, but other mayors confine more 
of their mischief to the home precincts. Tom Bradley won his office campaigning 
against such compulsive tourism. Why did he succumb to the old syndrome? The 
office of mayor of Los Angeles -- not the actual office, the position -- is, 
ultimately, no place for a real man. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this: As soon as Bradley got back from one of his most recent rounds 
of harbor-touting, one of his employees -- the chief of police -- publicly 
slammed His Honor for daring to suggest that the police commissioners, mayor's 
appointees all, just might want to exercise their legal duty to supervise a 
department, some of whose narcotics cops are under suspicion of stealing money 
and framing suspects while its chief tells Congress that casual marijuana 
smokers -- not addicts like his own son, whom he considers already dead -- 
should be shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
A mayor with any real power would have suspended that chief faster than you 
could say Adam 12. But because of an earlier era of political reform, our chief 
executive is barely empowered to decide what color drapes to hang in his 
office. Afraid of bosses and machines, California progressives tilted in favor 
of city councilmen, none of whom has the clout or independence to stand up to 
rogue elephants, like L.A.'s splendid string of loose-lipped police chiefs. 
Anybody who stays in the mayor's office long enough to get a healthy dose of 
such humiliation will naturally start dreaming of February in Prague. 
</P>
<P>
Coming around again, as well, is rail transit for L.A. The thin Blue Line has 
already opened to generally good notices, and Southern Pacific has sold three 
routes to the County Transportation Commission. Local rail buffs haven't been 
this happy since before the Domeliner ran out of Windex. And Metro Rail 
continues to tunnel along, blasting past clumsy accidents and methane pockets 
toward a rendezvous with the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
We are promised clean rapid transit that will span the yawning spaces between 
the beaches and the Inland Empire; a system to rival, it is said, Toronto or 
Paris. Or, to be utterly precise, to rival the system we had in the '20s. We 
are re-creating that system as faithfully as a paleontologist rebuilds a 
dinosaur skeleton. 
</P>
<P>
Don't get me wrong. I like rail transit. I'd even use it, assuming that the car 
interiors have the oiled metallic fragrance of the old Red Cars, not the ureic 
reek of New York City's IND trains. Southern California had a great transit 
system. We lost it (the lore blames a conspiracy of auto and gasoline 
companies, but we're beyond finger-pointing); we voted down its revival all 
during the Mustang and Camaro years, and now -- now that the replacement cost 
has hit eight figures, now that car traffic is so bad it makes nice ladies give 
you the finger -- now we're bringing it back. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, it makes sense. Somebody made money, and created jobs, by building 
our transit system in the first place. Keeping the setup didn't allow new money 
to be made, new jobs to be created. Think of all the car stereos and car phones 
and car windshield shades that have been sold in the meantime. And now, 
somebody makes money, and creates jobs, rebuilding what we used to have. 
</P>
<P>
So we'll take the train to San Berdoo, if we like. And the mayor, whoever he 
is, will know how well it compares with the trains in France because he'll be 
in Paris. And the Newsweek we buy at the train station will scream from its 
cover, "Jazz Is Back!"

THE TIMES' 17TH ANNUAL WINE TASTING; 
</P>
<P>
VINS EXTRAORDINAIRES

</HEADLINE>

<P>
THE LOS ANGELES Times Magazine's 17th Annual Wine Tasting is a bonanza for 
connoisseurs seeking excellent wines at affordable prices. There's nary a 
disappointment among the 36 top-ranking critics' choices. 
</P>
<P>
The assignment this year -- to choose from among 73 highly reputable wines from 
six leading wine-exporting countries plus California -- had a twist: All the 
wines were priced at $20 or less. They would not be tasted comparatively. 
Instead, each country's entries would be judged on their own merits, for both 
quality and value. So that the daylong blind tasting would not become a 
guessing contest, the judges were given the grape origin (i.e., Chardonnay, 
Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Noir) and the retail selling price of each wine. To our 
knowledge, this is an international first in critical evaluation in a wine 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen judges, using the 20-point scale (20 being the best score), took the 
cost of the wine into consideration before giving it an A for fair value, AA 
for good value or AAA for outstanding value. The number of entries from each 
country is indicated, but only the winners are rated. 
</P>
<P>
And now, the results, which may be of help in shopping for holiday feasting and 
gift giving.

AMERICAN INDIANS FACE LONG ODDS AT COLLEGE; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: ONLY ONE IN FIVE AT CSUN WILL GRADUATE. SOME RESEARCHERS CITE 
STUDENTS' FEARS OF NOT BEING ABLE TO RETURN HOME.

<P>
For American Indian students entering Cal State Northridge, prospects are poor: 
Chances are nearly 50-50 they will not return as sophomores, and only about one 
in five will graduate. 
</P>
<P>
Among ethnic groups on campus, only blacks stand a worse chance of graduating, 
university statistics indicate. 
</P>
<P>
Reasons for the high American Indian attrition are numerous. Some are cultural 
and some are financial. Although the college is given part of the blame, no one 
denies that similar problems exist at universities across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to tell my mother going to college was like walking through fire," said 
Lili Vidal, a CSUN graduate student of Cherokee descent. "It's like a foreign 
country. How people organize and live their lives is very different. . . . 
Think about what it would be like if you looked around and never saw yourself 
reflected in the real world." 
</P>
<P>
Over a 10-year period beginning in 1978, just 22% of American Indian students 
at CSUN graduated, according to a retention study done by the college's 
educational equity program. During those same years, only 15% of black students 
graduated, but the overall university average was 35%. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers from CSUN, while unsettling for Indian education experts, are 
similar to those at many other campuses. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the largest national education organizations do not single out 
American Indians in studies because their numbers are so small, several smaller 
Indian education groups estimate national graduation rates range from 15% to 
20%. 
</P>
<P>
A study about Indian college dropouts published in 1985 by the UCLA Indian 
Studies Center and its former director, Prof. Charlotte Heth, a Cherokee, found 
significant differences between the perspectives of the educational 
institutions and of Indian groups on why students failed to graduate. 
</P>
<P>
In a survey of 107 academic institutions and organizations, she found the top 
three reasons were lack of motivation, lack of long-range or career goals and a 
fear of not being able to return home after being educated, either because 
students' families would not accept them or because they would no longer feel 
comfortable at home. 
</P>
<P>
In an identical survey of 117 Indian groups and tribal representatives, Heth 
found the top reason listed was that same fear of not being able to return 
home, followed by housing problems and alcohol or drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Charmaine Huntting, a UCLA law student who graduated from CSUN last spring, 
said she too worries that her education will drive a wedge between herself and 
her family and culture. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the first person in my family who has ever even graduated high school," 
said Huntting, a Cherokee and Cruik who grew up in Los Angeles. "Even though I 
want to go into American Indian law, I tend to wonder whether they'll see me as 
being educated in a white man's world." 
</P>
<P>
Whether they have come from reservations or from urbanized families, Indians 
tend to follow tribal traditions of working in groups rather than alone, Indian 
scholars and activists said. Feelings of isolation and an aversion to 
competition are among the things that may cause them to drop out, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our way of living and our way of thinking does not permit a sense of 
competition. Our experience is one of cooperation," said Isaac Urquidi, a 
community social worker at the American Indian Counseling Center, run by the 
Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health. "We prefer to take a lower 
stand or a lower profile. That may lead people to think we are not 
intellectually capable of doing the work." 
</P>
<P>
At CSUN, other factors also are at work. American Indian students, former 
students, professors and past advisers said the strong cultural pull of family 
ties is one of the most common reasons students leave school. They said 
parents, many of whom have bad memories of their own attendance at federal 
Indian trade schools, may be less than enthusiastic about their offsprings' 
college goals. 
</P>
<P>
"There are times the students aren't sure themselves about what they're doing, 
which is not different from other students on campus. But the support network 
is entirely different," said Nancy Peterson Walter, a former part-time 
anthropology instructor and adviser to the American Indian Student Assn. 
"Grandparents, parents and others say, 'Why are you going to college anyway? 
You're just an Indian. Come home.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sister Grace Ann Rabideau, an Indian counselor at CSUN from 1972 to 1981 who 
now works at Valley College, said gaining a degree is so unimportant to some 
parents that students may quit just a class or two short of completion. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Givens, a member of the Oklahoma-based Cruik tribe, did that in 1977, 
after getting a C-minus in a public administration class required for his 
major. But after a 14-year hiatus, most of it spent working as a driver's 
training instructor, Givens, now 49, is back this fall, cramming for midterms. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't have the encouragement to do it before, and I didn't have the 
funds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like Jewish students, Indian students find that their tribal calendars are out 
of sync with the university's calendar, especially when a family member falls 
ill. 
</P>
<P>
When Sheryll Ryan Safian's father was diagnosed with leukemia in 1987, she said 
there was no question that she would travel to Oklahoma to participate in 
spring sun dances for him. 
</P>
<P>
"In order for the healing ceremonies to work, the people closest have 
responsibility to help out," Ryan Safian said. "I asked my father if he needed 
me and he said, 'Yes, quit school, I need you back here.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Safian, a business major, had spent four years at CSUN. She plans to 
attend Valley College in the spring and then re-enroll at the university next 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
At a CSUN protest last month, students also complained that American Indians 
had no gathering place of their own. The Indian student association lost its 
room in the anthropology department in 1984 to a museum. Students also say they 
need an American Indian adviser to double as mentor and father confessor for 
the Indian students. 
</P>
<P>
Vicero said the museum has been closed and a new room for the association is 
drawn into the department's renovation plans, scheduled for completion in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Because American Indian students tend to come from poor families, where the 
loss of a student's potential income may be considered an unreasonable 
hardship, financial difficulties are particularly trying for some of the CSUN 
students, Peterson Walter said. Most of them work, and many take occasional 
semesters off to support their families and save up for school, sometimes never 
to return. 
</P>
<P>
Even for those students who can prove tribal affiliation, who may have some 
access to student grants through the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, the 
awards tend to be small and usually are contingent on attending school full 
time and finishing within four or five years, Heth said. 
</P>
<P>
Junior Theresa Lucas, part Navajo and part Cherokee, considers herself luckier 
than most Indian students. She is on a leave of absence that she took to have 
her second baby, but she plans to return full time in the spring with the 
stability of her husband's job, a scholarship from the National Institutes of 
Health and a built-in baby-sitter, her mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand why a lot of people don't go back," she said. "If I didn't 
have my husband, I don't know if I'd be able to continue." 
</P>
<P>
CSUN's dropout situation may be no worse than the national picture, but 
administrators are concerned about it. They are developing plans for an 
American Indian studies department, which they hope will help them recruit more 
Indian students and encourage some of the 208 students attending classes there 
now to stay in school by providing them with an academic and social base. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, only a minor is offered in the subject, with classes scattered among 
several disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
The department proposal was endorsed last week by the School of Social and 
Behavioral Sciences, which would house the department. It now will be reviewed 
by the campus administration, which already has expressed interest in the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that since we now have departments for the three other major minority 
groups, it would be appropriate to establish one for American Indians," said 
Bob Suzuki, vice president of academic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
An Asian-American studies department was founded earlier this year, while 
Pan-African studies and Chicano studies were formed in the early '70s, in the 
wake of community and campus civil rights protests. 
</P>
<P>
American Indian students and other observers believe establishment of a 
department would be a good first step toward acknowledging their presence on 
campus. But they remain skeptical that the university will allocate resources 
necessary to make the program work. In the past, they said, advisers to the 
American Indian studies minor have been under-supported both financially and 
academically. 
</P>
<P>
"The American Indian studies program and the American Indian students have been 
treated like a stepchild. . . . They give them a lot of lip service, but they 
never really treat them right," said Suzanne Ankerstrom, a Chippewa who 
finished her undergraduate degree at CSUN in 1987, 13 years after she started 
there as a freshman. She is pursuing a master's degree there while teaching 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
The American Indian studies minor at CSUN has a checkered past, which critics 
say largely hinged on political whim. At its peak, following student protests 
in the late 1970s and early 1980s, it had an American Indian director, an 
office and an array of course offerings. There were more than 700 Indian 
students on campus then, said Dean Ralph Vicero of the School of Social and 
Behavioral Sciences. The director had close ties to American Indian recruiters 
in the educational equity office. 
</P>
<P>
Now, an assistant dean in the School of Behavioral Sciences is temporarily 
overseeing the program, along with many other duties, Vicero said. Students say 
they have trouble completing the minor because required courses are offered so 
infrequently. For the past few years, there have been no ethnic Indian 
recruiters at the campus, Suzuki said, although one may be hired in the next 
few months.

<P>
The Fillmore Unified School District Board of Education voted to allow the high 
school's varsity basketball team to go to Hawaii the last week of December. 
</P>
<P>
Arranged at no cost to the school district, the trip was the inspiration of 
Fillmore High School alumnus Dan Mackey and former basketball coach Jim Fauver, 
who retired last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Mackey has been taking an interest in the team, and donated $2,000 for new 
uniforms a year and a half ago," said John Wilber, the current coach. 
</P>
<P>
Mackey, a 1967 Fillmore graduate who owns a car dealership on the island of 
Kauai, made arrangements for the Fillmore team to play against two local 
schools Dec. 26 and 27, and found housing with area families. 
</P>
<P>
"They're always looking for people to come in and play," Wilber said. 
</P>
<P>
Donations will cover the cost of the six-day trip. 
</P>
<P>
The team outdid itself in fund raising last year, Wilber said, saying the team 
gathered most of the fare for three coaches and 13 team members at a 
pit-barbecue held during Fillmore's 1990 May Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Adults who go, including eight parents and Principal Jaime Castellanos, will 
pay their own way. JANET BERGAMO

JAPAN'S LABS OPEN AT LAST; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: WE CLAMORED FOR ACCESS, AND JAPAN FINALLY AGREED. GUESS WHO'S 
LIKELY TO GAIN MOST?

<TEXT>
<P>
After decades of scouring the world for new technology while keeping its own 
research closeted, Japan is sliding open the doors to its laboratories and 
letting outsiders take a peek. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of foreign scientists are ensconced in Japanese university and 
government laboratories, supported by newly established Japanese government 
fellowships. Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry has invited 
foreign firms to join in strategic national projects in such areas as factory 
automation, hypersonic jet engines and superconductors. 
</P>
<P>
And Japanese corporations are for the first time beginning to hire foreign 
researchers, in some cases placing them in charge of important research. 
</P>
<P>
But just as U.S. pressure to open markets has ended up making Japanese 
companies more competitive in finance and computers, Japan -- not the United 
States -- may ultimately be the primary beneficiary of this U.S.-pressured 
perestroika in Japanese research. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign scientists are helping to bring fresh ideas to Japan's insular labs -- 
while alleviating its chronic shortage of researchers. Japan also needs 
innovative foreigners to help it in its push into new frontiers of science and 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the United States is only partially taking advantage of 
Japan's new openness. Although American researchers are learning about how 
Japan organizes its research, few American researchers speak Japanese or are 
willing to relocate to Japan, making it difficult for the United States to 
fully benefit from Japan's annual $80-billion expenditure in research and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Another key barrier to Americans is Japan's heavy reliance on private 
corporations to conduct not only their own research but also much of the 
publicly funded research. Private corporations simply are not as open as the 
government with their research. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japan grows more aggressive in drawing on U.S. research. 
</P>
<P>
Although Japan has caught or surpassed the United States in a growing number of 
technologies, including new materials and semiconductors, the country's 
"technology trade balance" remains sharply weighted toward imports. In 1988, 
Japan paid $1.52 billion for U.S. technology. The United States paid only $590 
million for Japanese technology. 
</P>
<P>
With half the population, Japan has nearly 10 times the manpower for tapping 
U.S. efforts. Although 52,000 Japanese spent time studying or researching in 
the United States last year, only a few thousand Americans spent time in Japan, 
and few are conversant in Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Cynics think that's why Japan has finally agreed to swing open its research 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
"They called our bluff," says an executive at a U.S. technology company's Tokyo 
office. "They know that even if they opened up, there wouldn't be that many 
researchers who had the Japanese language ability to take advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
Suggests a U.S. science official with a more chilling rationale: "Japan is no 
longer worried about U.S. competition." Instead, Japan is eager to counter the 
American perception that Japan is getting a free ride on U.S. research 
spending, just as it has on U.S. defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
Japan also has more selfish reasons for bringing outsiders into its research 
effort. Japan's Science and Technology Agency estimates that the nation will 
face a shortage of 510,000 researchers by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
And while Japan could rely on its own research community to play catch-up to 
the West, it needs the West's creative, free-thinking minds as it moves into 
frontier technologies. 
</P>
<P>
Take MITI's hypersonic engine program, a seven-year, $220-million Japanese 
government project to build a hypersonic jet that would cut the New York-Tokyo 
flight time to about four hours from the current 13 1/2. Japanese engineers, 
far behind in aerospace research, will work regularly with America's best jet 
engine scientists. No matter how cautious U.S. companies try to be, Japanese 
engineers will absorb a wealth of information, executives experienced with such 
joint ventures say. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a deeper, structural problem that obstructs the flow of 
technology from Japan to the United States. Although 40% of U.S. research is 
government financed, takes place in easily accessible university laboratories 
and represents the best America has to offer, only 20% of Japan's research is 
publicly financed -- and it is probably the poorest Japan has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
Despite well-publicized calls for increased spending in basic research, 
Japanese public funding in science has been progressively scaled back during 
the past 10 years, leaving universities under-funded and ill-equipped. 
</P>
<P>
"University research is dying in Japan," says Yoshitsugu Nakagawa, a Tokyo 
University physics professor. 
</P>
<P>
Government laboratories have a wealth of equipment, buy they have few 
researchers and technicians, according to Cristian P. Schulthess, a U.S. 
scientist doing environmental research at the National Chemical Laboratory for 
Industry in Tsukuba. 
</P>

Schulthess works with an Indian and a Japanese researcher. The small group has 
almost exclusive use of such costly equipment as a $250,000 inductively coupled 
plasma spectrometer for analyzing the presence of metals in water. But it 
seldom uses the machine more than once a month. 
</P>
<P>
A 15% drop in the budget for MITI's 16 laboratories has forced cutbacks in 
full-time employees, administrators say. 
</P>
<P>
"At this rate, we aren't going to be able to support these international 
projects like the Human Frontiers project," says Masahiko Kobayashi, deputy 
director for large scale projects at MITI. 
</P>
<P>
The project was initially conceived several years ago by then-Prime Minister 
Yasuhiro Nakasone as a grand $8-billion effort to illustrate Japan's commitment 
to basic science. The project, based in Strasbourg, France, is still considered 
a serious effort in basic science. But its total budget this year is a scant 
$10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese corporations are increasingly doing impressive science. But their 
private laboratories are harder to get access to. 
</P>
<P>
W. D. Gould, of the Extractive Metallurgy Laboratory in Ontario, Canada, 
couldn't get a Japanese mining company to talk about its new process for 
preventing coal mines from leaching acid into underground streams until he 
worked side by side with the company's researchers in a Japanese government 
laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshikazu Goto, deputy director of MITI's International Research and 
Development Cooperation Division, says he wants to see private labs more open 
and is working on a program to offer scholarships to U.S. scientists so they 
can spend time in corporate laboratories. A recent study by the Japanese office 
of the U.S. National Science Foundation found roughly half the corporate 
respondents receptive to taking in foreign "investigators." 
</P>
<P>
Japan's NEC Corp. has hired several foreigners as research managers at its 
fundamental research laboratory in Tsukuba, north of Tokyo. In the past, 
Japanese companies have been too fearful of bringing "job-hopping" foreigners 
into their laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
Still, even if Japan were to completely swing open the doors to its private 
laboratories, it is unclear how effectively the United States could take 
advantage of the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Even the substantial amounts of information published in English do not reach 
the people in the United States who would find it interesting, says David 
Kahaner, a National Institute of Standards and Technology researcher now 
working at the Office of Naval Research's Tokyo office. 
</P>
<P>
The Japan Information Center of Science and Technology provides a database of 
more than 1 million Japanese technical papers and abstracts translated into 
English. The service, however, was used by only 300 people last year, triple 
the level in 1988 but still substantially below the estimated 8,000 researchers 
in Japan who are paying for access to U.S. database services. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of such companies as DuPont, International Business Machines 
and Eastman Kodak, which have substantial research operations in Japan, few 
companies have the resources or the interest to commit to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. researchers and companies who work in Japan are learning about Japan's 
own unique way of organizing research, while making their way through Japanese 
research institutions like explorers in a new world. 
</P>
<P>
One such researcher is Stephen Peters, an expert on intelligent robots from the 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. He changes from shoes to slippers as he 
guides a visitor into a room equipped with a wealth of robots and computers in 
the Electrotechnical Laboratory in Tsukuba, Japan's largest government 
laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Peters, who has attended conferences, visited companies and became the first 
foreigner to participate in the laboratory's planning sessions, says he was 
mystified when he kept running across the same people. 
</P>
<P>
His surprising discovery: Japan is at roughly the same level as its U.S. 
counterparts in robotics research but, he figures, the country has about one 
tenth the number of scientists in the field. 
</P>
<P>
Although researchers work separately in their own laboratories, Peters 
explains, they tend to divvy up the work to avoid redundancy. U.S. scientists, 
by comparison, often do the same research in an effort to compete for the same 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. companies are getting hands-on experience in that system by participating 
in government projects that coordinate research between university, government 
and business labs. 
</P>
<P>
United Technologies and General Electric, for example, plan to participate in 
the hypersonic jet program in cooperation with three Japanese and two European 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an extraordinary thing to have arch-competitors setting down in an 
environment of cooperation," says Stanley Krueger, president of United 
Technologies' Japan office. In the United States, because of antitrust laws and 
competitive pressures, "there hasn't been a forum" for such cooperation, 
Krueger says. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, for example, a contractor has sole access to technology 
it develops for the Department of Defense. But in Japan the results of the 
engine project will belong to all members of the project. 
</P>
<P>
"In the end everybody has the same nugget of technology," Krueger says. "Then 
the question is, who gets to the market first." 
</P>
<P>
"This is Japan's secret," says MITI's Goto. "This is what the (U.S.) companies 
will learn." 
</P>
<P>
THE U.S.-JAPAN RESEARCH GAP 
</P>
<P>
The value of U.S. technology imported by Japan far outpaces that traveling from 
Japan to the United States. 
</P>
<P>

SOURCES OF JAPANESE RESEARCH FUNDING 
</P>
<P>
Unlike U.S. research, which is 40% financed by the government, Japanese 
research draws funding primarily from private sources. In 1988, for example, 
the government was the source of only 19.9% of research funds, compared with 
80% from the private sector. Percentage changes are from the previous year.

WASTE CONTRACT -- DEGENERATED INTO MUDSLINGING BY COUNCIL MEMBERS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After months of talking trash, the City Council is finally on the verge of 
selecting the young city's first garbage collector. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently believing that haste makes waste, council members have wrestled with 
the question since February, when the city formally took over waste disposal 
responsibilities from the county. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, residents contract directly with any trash-pickup company they 
choose. On Tuesday, the council is scheduled to weigh its options: award an 
exclusive $3-million-a-year franchise to one of nine companies that applied for 
the job, keep the market open under a permit system or put the contract out to 
bid -- again. 
</P>
<P>
"It should have been innocuous as to how to resolve it, but it's turned into a 
monster that won't stop growing," Councilwoman Phyllis Papen said. 
</P>
<P>
During the last nine months, the issue has been marked by controversy and 
political mudslinging as council members converted it into a dumping ground for 
personal accusations and recriminations. 
</P>
<P>
As it stands, only three of the five council members -- the minimum needed for 
a quorum -- will be allowed to vote. Councilmen John Forbing and Paul Horcher, 
who last week won the 52nd Assembly District seat, disqualified themselves in 
June because of conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Forbing bowed out because the monthly community magazine "The Windmill," edited 
by his wife, ran advertisements by several waste haulers under consideration 
and resulted in income to her of more than $500. 
</P>
<P>
The state Fair Political Practices Commission advised Forbing that his 
participation in the vote would constitute a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Horcher, an attorney, did legal work for a company that had an interest in one 
of the nine waste haulers up for the city contract. Although Horcher's 
connection with the hauler was indirect, City Atty. Andrew Arczynski said, "it 
was close enough that from a conservative point of view I recommended that he 
step down." 
</P>
<P>
But his disqualification did not prevent the waste disposal issue from being 
knit into his assembly campaign. Earlier this month, Papen, a political foe of 
Horcher, said that his campaign received contributions from several of the nine 
competing companies in April and May, before he exempted himself from voting on 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Records show that contributions to Horcher from at least four of the nine 
companies totaled more than $2,000 during those two months. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Englander, who ran Horcher's campaign, said the donations did not 
constitute conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
"Legally, political contributions are not conflicts of interest. The fact is 
that special interests, since time began, have made contributions to all 
political candidates and officeholders. Paul has never had a conflict of 
interest (from the contributions), and he never will have the opportunity to 
vote on who gets the waste disposal contract." 
</P>
<P>
Englander in turn accused Papen of having a conflict. Papen lives with Michael 
Lowe, a marketing consultant who until recently represented the Chino-based 
Western Waste Industries, one of two top-ranked candidates. The other main 
contender is Community Disposal of Industry. 
</P>
<P>
Although she and Lowe live together, Papen said, they are not married and only 
share living expenses, without commingling funds. 
</P>
<P>
"Conflicts of interest are legal matters. I have a letter from the (Fair 
Political Practices Commission stating) that I do not have a conflict of 
interest in voting on this issue. I have been very circumspect to make sure I 
have been doing what is proper," she said, adding that she had directed the 
city attorney to obtain an opinion from the commission for her in April. 
</P>
<P>
Lowe, who worked with a group opposing Horcher's candidacy, said he ended his 
working relationship with Western Waste just before the election because of 
pressure allegedly brought to bear on the company by the Horcher campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Lowe claimed that Horcher's camp, angered by his political activities, told the 
firm that its reputation would be damaged unless it decided to "either fire him 
or get him under control." Lowe terminated his contract with the company but is 
renegotiating, he said. Western Waste referred requests for comment to Vice 
President Al Simonian, who did not return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Englander denied that the campaign had pressured Western Waste. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul Horcher has not had a conversation with anyone from Western Waste in at 
least three, maybe four to five months," Englander said. But, he added: "I had 
a conversation with a friend of mine who is a consultant for Western Waste and 
told him how disappointed I was that Western Waste couldn't control their 
consultants, and that . . . I was sorry if (the company) became a campaign 
issue because of Mr. Lowe's activities." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Diamond Bar City Council will meet to decide on waste disposal. 
Its options include awarding an exclusive $3-million-a-year franchise to one of 
nine companies that applied for the job of disposing of residents' waste, 
keeping the market open under a permit system that allows each homeowner to 
pick a waste disposal company, or putting the contract out to bid again.

NEWSLETTER TO CEASE PUBLICATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council agreed Wednesday to shut down the production of the city's 
newsletter, The South Pasadena Quarterly, after next year's summer issue, but 
promised to explore other methods of providing information to residents. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager John Bernardi said the newsletter, which is written by city staff 
members, has grown "dry" over the years, with oft-repeated articles and stories 
that have lost their timeliness by the time they are published. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Evelyn Fierro suggested that the quarterly could be replaced by a shorter 
monthly newsletter produced by professional journalists hired by the city. The 
council said the quarterly newsletter could be revived if no other substitutes 
are found by next June.

CHANGES IN DEVELOPMENT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials are overhauling the city's 4-year-old Sierra Vista Development Plan 
because it is hindering the very development that it was meant to encourage. 
</P>
<P>
The development plan for the corridor along the 10 and 605 freeways was 
designed to foster larger-scale development in an area littered with small 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
City planner Lawrence Onaga told the City Council on Wednesday that development 
has stalled because developers have had difficulty assembling lots meeting 
their requirements. He recommended that land-size requirements be relaxed in 
certain areas and that design guidelines and a high-priority zone be 
established. Onaga said it would be several months before public hearings on 
the proposed changes would begin.

SHIP'S PILOT JOINS HARBOR COMMISSION; 
</P>
<P>
OXNARD: SUPPORTERS SAY RAY FOSSE'S ELECTION INDICATES THAT VOTERS DON'T CARE 
FOR THE DISTRICT'S PRESENT CONFIGURATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER PUMMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ray Fosse succeeded in becoming the first candidate to unseat an incumbent in 
the Oxnard Harbor District Commission's 53-year history and also outpolled the 
two commissioners that voters returned to office. 
</P>
<P>
"There might have been some magic in being first on the ballot," said Fosse, 
52, a ship's pilot at the Naval Construction Battalion Center in Port Hueneme. 
"There were a lot of people who backed my campaign, and we walked a lot of 
precincts." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters said Fosse's strong showing in last Tuesday's election, after failed 
campaigns in 1986 and 1988, indicates that voters support doing away with the 
district's present configuration. The district includes Oxnard, Port Hueneme, 
Camarillo and parts of Thousands Oaks and unincorporated areas. Fosse, a 
resident of Oxnard, endorsed the Local Agency Formation Commission's attempts 
to rein in the boundaries to Oxnard and Port Hueneme, the two cities most 
affected by its operations. 
</P>
<P>
But Edward J. Millan, who advocates holding an election on the issue, said his 
and Stanley J. Daily's reelections suggest that voters want to maintain the 
larger district. Millan and Daily are both from Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
"After running so many times, he had a good sense of how to win," Millan said. 
"Both Stan and myself, we were very low-key." 
</P>
<P>
Of the 85,893 ballots cast, Fosse received 34,314 votes. Millan got 29,355 and 
Daily received 27,949. Daily, a former Camarillo mayor, also won election to 
the Camarillo City Council and said he intends to serve in both posts. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Steve W. Socks lost the seat he was appointed to earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Fosse's victory in the field of six candidates was welcomed by Port Hueneme 
City Manager Dick Velthoen, who has butted heads with the commission and port 
administration in the past and who wants the district downsized. 
</P>
<P>
"We have someone now who is in the marine industry and represents the local 
area," Velthoen said. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a lot of exposure to the district and its operations and an 
understanding of how the port works from the bottom-up, not the top-down," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fosse said his first priority will be to mend fences with municipal officials 
and port employees. 
</P>
<P>
He said they were treated with disdain by port officials and the commission, 
whose members voted unanimously on all issues in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
Daily said that under the commission's committee format, disagreements have 
been resolved before the issue goes to a vote of the full panel. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who questions the propriety of something gets branded an enemy of the 
port, and they get confrontational about things that should be negotiable," 
Fosse said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't intend to be the guy who sits in the corner and votes no on 
everything, but when things do come up that are less than palatable to me, it's 
important that the record shows someone said 'No.' "

NEW PANEL TO STUDY TRAFFIC PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERRY BRAILO SPENCER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to reduce traffic in the Simi Valley area and help employers 
comply with a county regulation requiring fewer commutes, the Simi Valley 
Chamber of Commerce on Thursday announced the formation of the Simi Valley 
Transportation Management Assn. 
</P>
<P>
It is one of three such organizations in the county formed so employers, 
developers and government representatives can work together on transportation 
policies, programs and services. Two other organizations have been formed in 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Baldwin, the county's air pollution control officer, said the 
association would help employers put together ride-share programs. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, Caltrans signed an agreement with the Simi Valley chamber 
guaranteeing $60,000 to implement the transportation management association. 
The chamber must put up matching funds or perform services that would match the 
grant. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Charles Coffey, the executive director of the association, said 
traffic congestion has brought about changing times. 
</P>
<P>
"We must change the commuting habits of our populace," Coffey said. "We're not 
just talking about car-pooling or van-pooling. We are talking about bus 
transportation, bicycling, jogging, variable work hours, telecommuting and 
parking management." 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the Ventura County Board of Supervisors passed Rule 210, which 
requires that employers with 100 or more employees submit plans to the county's 
Air Pollution Control District showing reduction of home-to-work trips -- 
specifically, one out of every three cars must have two passengers. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 1, the county began sending notices to large companies, beginning at in 
the east county. About 30 notices a month will be sent over the next 10 months. 
Once the notice is received, companies have 120 days to file a trip-reduction 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
The rule will extend to employers with 75 or more employees in August, 1991, 
and all other businesses by January, 1992. Failure to submit trip-reduction 
plans could result in fines or imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
Potential services to be offered by the association include computerized 
van-pool, car-pool and transit information, computerized traffic monitoring 
services, van-pool subsidies, guaranteed ride home services and development of 
employee on-site child care. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley has 25 employers with more than 100 employees.

POSSIBLE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST STYMIE COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA DOWLING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Conflict of interest concerns quieted Port Hueneme government last week after 
two city councilmen and one planning commissioner were advised not to discuss a 
proposed beach-area development. 
</P>
<P>
The complex development plan, known as Surfside Village Annex, involves 
building 30 condominiums on land occupied by the Veterans of Foreign Wars post 
on Surfside Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The VFW has been forced to move because it has inadequate parking. 
</P>
<P>
After it was learned that Mayor Dorill Wright, Councilman Ken Hess and Planning 
Commissioner Gary Songer all live within 2,500 feet of the project, the city 
attorney advised the three not even to ask questions about the development 
during a council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
At the Nov. 21 council meeting, City Atty. Don G. Kircher will give an opinion 
on whether the three would have any direct or indirect financial gain if the 
project is approved. If they do, they would be prohibited from participating in 
decisions affecting the project. 
</P>
<P>
To further complicate matters, Hess and Songer also are VFW members, along with 
Councilman Jim Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
Kircher said he believed that being VFW members would not restrict them from 
voting under conflict-of-interest and ethics laws. 
</P>
<P>
But if being VFW members were interpreted as restricting participation, as many 
as three council members -- Wright, Hess and Daniels -- might have to abstain 
from voting on the project. That would leave only two council members. 
</P>
<P>
"Those situations periodically arise," Kircher said, adding that he does not 
foresee governmental gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
Although Community Development Director Tom Figg, coordinator of the 
condominium project, was sympathetic to the city attorney's concerns, he noted: 
"You can't render a political body totally helpless."

ARTISTS IN ACTION DEDICATES ITS TALENTS -- AND ITS SECOND PLAY'S PROFITS -- TO 
GREENPEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SZYMANSKI 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Actress Diana Karanikas was last seen in the film "Deadgirls." Her boyfriend, 
producer Jackson Harvey, has done "Season of Fear," "Night of the Demons" and 
"Pucker Up and Bark Like a Dog." 
</P>
<P>
They don't mind working on slasher horror movies -- to have entertainment work 
at all in Hollywood is a good sign -- but they wanted to use their talents to 
promote causes they believe in. So they gathered a group of a dozen actors and 
formed Artists in Action Inc. Their second fund-raising play begins this 
weekend, with the profits going to Greenpeace, an international environmental 
action group. 
</P>
<P>
"In this age of sitcom television and Rambo-style movies, it's hard to do work 
that is socially relevant," said Harvey, 32. 
</P>
<P>
"And most of us don't have the money to give out large donations to causes, or 
have the time to volunteer in all the various organizations, so this was a 
perfect way to put our talents to work and hone our craft at the same time," 
said Karanikas, 26, who has also appeared in mainstream films such as "Nothing 
in Common" and "Risky Business." 
</P>
<P>
"I used to send out a $25 check to the Sierra Club and it didn't seem to make 
any difference to me, but now I feel like I'm actively getting the word out to 
people who wouldn't normally know or hear about these groups or these issues," 
Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
At the group's first fund-raiser last summer, which benefited Heal the Bay, the 
troupe performed "The Plight of the Lesser Sawyer's Cricket." It was also 
broadcast on a local cable television channel, EZ-TV, where pledges were 
sought. They earned $250 for the cause after expenses were paid, but Harvey 
said, "It seems like just a little, but it was only our first try." The actors 
are paid a small fee based on a percentage of the gross, and the shows give 
them exposure and theater credits. 
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace spokesman David Wakeling said fund-raisers such as these may reach a 
different variety of people and could encourage some of the audience to get 
involved. During intermission, brochures are passed out, T-shirts are sold and 
audience members find themselves discussing the topical social issues of the 
day. Artists in Action expects to expand its fund raising to groups helping 
causes such as women's issues, human rights, AIDS, abortion rights, 
homelessness, animal rights, anti-censorship, poverty, alcohol rehabilitation 
and mental health. 
</P>
<P>
The next step is to find corporate sponsorship for Artists in Action and 
possibly attract name actors to appear in the shows. 
</P>
<P>
The current play, "Puntilla and His Hired Man," is an absurd comedy by Bertolt 
Brecht written in the 1930s, and the humor is still relevant for today's 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Stand-up comic Kerry Burke, best known for his 3-year role as Larry on the 
daytime soap opera "Ryan's Hope," plays the bombastic, obnoxious heavy-drinking 
Puntilla who is put in his place by his handsome and wise chauffeur, played by 
Dean Stuart. 
</P>
<P>
Performing with Artists in Action is more than just another acting gig. Gail A. 
Lynch, who plays one of Puntilla's sleazy fiancees in this play, said her work 
with the group has been rewarding because they are "dedicated to improving the 
environment, which is something I firmly believe in." 
</P>
<P>
Lynch, a Pennsylvania native who moved to Los Angeles three years ago and 
became an instant environmentalist, said, "Sure, I get into all the recycling 
and all that, but it's nice to translate that to your job too." 
</P>
<P>
Newcomer Katie Amstutz, who plays one of the show's many dual roles as a stuffy 
telephone operator and a shy maid, said, "So many of my friends complain about 
things and don't do anything about it. I know people who have gotten rashes 
from swimming in the ocean, but they don't really know how to get involved in 
solving some of the problems. When they come to this show, they will learn how 
to." 
</P>
<P>
Other actors in the 2-hour, 45-minute performance include Janeece Flint, 
Michael McNeill and Dan Navratil. 
</P>
<P>
The plays that Harvey chooses to produce have nothing to do with the cause 
Artists in Action is supporting. He said he picks plays for entertainment 
value. 
</P>
<P>
In "Puntilla," Harvey cast Karanikas in the role of a spoiled independent woman 
who is humiliated while she is being taught how to pull off a man's boots, 
cater to him and darn his socks. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure this would have been appropriate as a fund-raiser for a women's 
group," Harvey joked. "We don't want message plays, necessarily, but something 
that is enjoyable." 
</P>
<P>
 "Puntilla and His Hired Man" will be performed at the Flight Theater at The 
Complex, 6472 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood, on Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m. 
and Sundays at 2 and 8 p.m. Through Dec. 2. Tickets are $12. For reservations, 
call (213) 464-2124 or (213) 913-1273.

BRUSH WITH WOOD-PAINTING, UKRAINIAN CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the long, freezing winters, the Ukrainian people used to huddle around 
the stove that traditionally warmed the family living room and take cheer from 
the brightly painted furniture that seemed to warm the bleak and cheerless 
days. 
</P>
<P>
This traditional Ukrainian art, known as petrykivka, or wood painting, will be 
taught by artist Zenovia Wrzesniewski from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Nov. 25 and Dec. 
15 at the Ukrainian Art Center in Los Angeles, 4315 Melrose Ave., Director 
Daria Chaikovsky said. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't need any particular skills and all the materials will be furnished," 
said Wrzesniewski, adding that the only thing participants need is a little 
patience. 
</P>
<P>
"The classes will be very small so that I can work with each person 
individually, and we will begin by painting a medallion that you can either 
wear around your neck, or put on your Christmas tree." 
</P>
<P>
Wrzesniewski said there are a few brush strokes that she will teach and then 
she will show how to work on the wood that she will have already prepared for 
the students. The technique, also known as tole painting, can be used to make 
decorations as basic or elaborate as the individual artist wishes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Ukraine, we used to paint our furniture, our walls, the floors and all 
other wood surfaces, as well as plates, bread boxes, gift boxes, cups and our 
shelves, in order to bring vivid color and brightness into our lives," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As the former Zenovia Iwanchuk, born 63 years ago in the Ukrainian town of 
Lviev, near the Polish border, she and her parents left during World War II on 
an odyssey that took them to displaced-persons camps in Germany, Switzerland 
and England, and eventually to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"Ukrainians love bright colors because they make a bold, affirmative statement 
and we are a positive people," said Wrzesniewski, who met her husband, 
Bohuslav, now an Orange County aerospace engineer, in a Ukrainian youth group 
in Toronto. Since the couple came to Southern California in the late '60s, 
Zenovia Wrzesniewski has tried to perpetuate the skills her artist mother 
taught her, most recently by teaching at the Ukrainian Art Center. 
</P>
<P>
She said that the tole painting will open up a whole new avenue of personalized 
Christmas presents for the participants to make. "You can do jewelry or paint 
on an appropriate wood surface," she said. "Actually, you can decorate anything 
made of wood with the tole technique." 
</P>
<P>
Zenovia Wrzesniewski's daughter, Adriana, plans to take another art center 
workshop in which Ukrainian musician Volodymyr Sukhiy will give a beginning 
class in the bandura, a 14th-Century instrument with 20 to 60 strings that 
Adriana says sounds like a mandolin. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always loved the sound the instrument makes," she said, "and since it 
is part of my heritage, I am going to give it a try." 
</P>
<P>
The music class is a four-day session held from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. beginning 
Saturday and continuing on Nov. 25 and Dec. 9 and 15. 
</P>
<P>
According to Chaikovsky, who is in charge of the heritage program for the 
center, students may either bring their own instrument, if they have one in the 
family, or rent one from the center. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the petrykivka and bandura classes, there will be instruction in 
pysanka, the centuries-old Ukrainian wax technique for decorating eggs. The 
technique can be used to make Christmas decorations and tree hangings, 
Chaikovsky said. 
</P>
<P>
There will also be a two-day class in embroidery that will include 
cross-stitching, Chaikovsky said. 
</P>
<P>
For those wishing to learn more about Ukrainian arts and crafts, there will be 
an open house from noon to 5 p.m. Dec. 2 at the center. The event will feature 
an exhibition of oil paintings and graphics of Ukrainian historical themes by 
Vitaliy Lytvyn, who was born in the western Ukraine and lives in Toronto. 
Another exhibition will feature the work of doll maker Valentina Solo, who 
began creating regional Ukrainian dolls to support herself when she emigrated 
from the Ukraine to the United States, Chaikovsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 The petrykivka class will be offered Nov. 25 and Dec. 15 for $25 per session. 
The bandura will be taught in four sessions, Saturday, Nov. 25, Dec. 9 and 15 
for $45. The embroidery class will be offered in two sessions, Nov. 17 and Dec. 
9, for $35. The pysanka class will be offered Nov. 17, Nov. 25, Dec. 9 and Dec. 
15 for $25 per session. All classes are held between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. at the 
Ukrainian Art Center, 4315 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles. For information, call 
(213) 668-0172.

<TEXT>
<P>
A decorative window pouf can be quickly make with just a scrap of fabric using 
Kirsch's new Tulip Swagholder. 
</P>
<P>
Simple hemmed panels also can be formed into rosettes, bows, hearts, shells and 
other forms, then used singly or in groups and with rods or poles to create 
window treatments with a minimum of fabric. 
</P>
<P>
They can be mounted inside or outside window frames, on walls or even the 
ceiling. The hardware comes with instructions for creating different looks; 
Kirsch says anyone who can tie a bow can master the Swagholder.

BALER FOR NEWSPAPER RECYCLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLINGSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We're learning once again how important it is to recycle newspapers along with 
glass, plastic and aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
With every ton of newspapers that is recycled, more than a dozen trees are 
saved! Here's a project that will make it easier for all of us to do our part, 
an easy-to-build paper baler. 
</P>
<P>
The baler holds about one month's accumulation of newspapers and is convenient 
to use with a built-in string box as well as a covered razor blade to cut the 
string or twine. Step-by-step directions and full-size traceable patterns make 
this project simple enough for the amateur woodworker. Just trace the parts, 
saw them out, and put them together!

INVASION OF THE EUROPEAN LETTUCES; 
</P>
<P>
PLANTING: SEEDS FOR SEVERAL VARIETIES OF THE TASTY, TENDER LETTUCES CAN NOW BE 
OBTAINED IN U.S.. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SIDNAM, Sidnam has written garden columns and features for The Times 
since 1975. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
European gardeners and cooks know and savor lettuce. Most would certainly not 
be satisfied with the mundane offerings found in American supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
Their kitchen gardens abound with a marvelous array of lettuces that feature 
colors, tastes, shapes and textures that differ from lettuce varieties found in 
this country. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a trio of mail order seed firms, these sweet, crisp, tender and 
colorful European lettuces are now available to gardeners in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Now through early spring is a great time to sample these new varieties in your 
garden. And you don't actually need a garden. Lettuce is simple and quick to 
grow in a container on a sunny patio. 
</P>
<P>
European lettuces (as do American lettuces) come in four basic types. Here is a 
rundown of the four types along with some of the exciting varieties found in 
each. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Butterhead Lettuce 
</P>
<P>
Many gardeners and gourmets feel that the butterhead varieties have the best 
flavor of all the lettuce types. The butterhead lettuce varieties are soft and 
fragile in texture, containing a buttery colored heart surrounded by vividly 
colored outer leaves. 
</P>
<P>
The spongy leaves have a delicate, sweet, buttery flavor. The heads of 
butterhead lettuce are very loosely folded and never become solid. Unlike 
American butterhead varieties which are usually green, the European butterheads 
come in a range of colors that typically include crimson or bronze, tapering to 
various shades of green and yellow at the heart. 
</P>
<P>
Of the four lettuce types, Europeans tend to favor the butterheads and have 
developed some outstanding varieties. Sangria comes from France and has outer 
leaves tinted a rosy red color and pale yellow interior leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Its thick wavy leaves are tender and succulent. From Switzerland comes Pirat, a 
very mild butterhead whose pale green leaves are mottled with bronze. Capitane 
is a gourmet Dutch butterhead that is sold by very fancy Common Market 
greengrocers. It has rosettes of large, velvety green leaves and a buttery 
flavor that requires only the simplest oil and vinegar dressing. Merveille des 
Quatre Saisons is a beautiful, tender French lettuce with very large 
ruby-tipped leaves that surround pretty green hearts. It has great ornamental 
as well as eating qualities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Romaine Lettuce 
</P>
<P>
Romaine lettuce derives its name from Roman lettuce, which was grown by 
14th-Century popes in the palace gardens and its cultivation quickly spread 
throughout Europe. It is also referred to as cos lettuce in some seed 
catalogues. Romaine became famous as the lettuce used in Caesar Salad. And 
indeed, if grown and harvested properly, it deserves its reputation for 
excellence of flavor. In contrast to the delicate flavor of butterhead lettuce, 
romaine has a bold, hearty flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Rouge D'Hiver has beautiful, wine-red leaves and comes from France. It has 
better heat tolerance than most romaines. Winter Density is a beautiful English 
romaine. Its compact deep-green heads are more tender than most romaines. 
</P>
<P>
Romance is a French romaine with upright crispy green leaves that have a 
unique, sweet flavor. Little Gem is a miniature romaine that comes from 
England. The heads are four or five inches tall with bright-green, wavy leaves 
that are perfect for individual salads. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Batavian Lettuce 
</P>
<P>
European batavian lettuce somewhat resembles American crisphead or iceberg 
lettuce, however, it has a wider range of colors and shapes, and the heads are 
generally looser. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, unlike our crisphead lettuce, batavian heads are sweeter and never 
bland tasting. They are also easier to grow than American crisphead lettuce 
varieties. 
</P>
<P>
Rouge Grenobloise is a beautiful French batavian lettuce with shiny green 
leaves tinted with burgundy red. The leaves are sweet and crunchy. 
</P>
<P>
Kristia, also from France, has crispy, large medium green leaves that are juicy 
and never bitter. It takes hot weather better than other batavians. Canasta is 
a gorgeous French batavian with red tinged, bright green leaves. It is sweet, 
crisp and juicy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looseleaf Lettuce 
</P>
<P>
Looseleaf lettuce is the easiest of all lettuces to grow and the most rapid to 
reach maturity. As its name implies, looseleaf lettuce does not form heads. 
Looseleaf lettuce makes an attractive landscaping item as the many looseleaf 
varieties offer a multitude of colors which include deep burgundy, lime green, 
bronze, red-tipped and dark green. The foliage is crinkled, frilled, wavy or 
curled depending on which variety you grow. 
</P>
<P>
In outlining the virtues of European lettuces, I don't want to give the idea 
that American varieties are vastly inferior; they're not. Our looseleaf 
varieties such as Red Sails, Black Seeded Simpson, Oakleaf, Prize Head and 
others are the equal of European varieties. However, for both flavor and beauty 
the European lettuces are hard to beat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FINDING SEEDS FOR EUROPEAN LETTUCES 
</P>
<P>
You probably won't be able to locate seeds for the European lettuces in local 
nurseries; most will have to be ordered by mail. The following mail order 
companies stock seeds for varieties mentioned: 
</P>
<P>
Shepherd's Garden Seeds, 6116 Highway 9, Felton, Ca. 95018. Catalog $1. Lists 
Capitane, Merveille des Quatre Saisons, Romance, Little Gem, Rouge Grenobloise 
and Kristia. 
</P>
<P>

Lists Sangria, Winter Density, Canasta and Concarde. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cook's Garden, P.O. Box 535, Londonderry, Vt. 05148. Catalogue $1. Lists

</P>
<P>
In addition to varieties mentioned here, these three companies offer a huge 
selection of other unique European and American lettuce varieties. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
<P>
 For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week: 
</P>
<P>
* Thanksgiving is on its way. Brighten up the indoors with potted 
chrysanthemums or decorate with autumn-hued leaves, brightly colored 
persimmons, pomegranates and berried branches. 
</P>
<P>
* If you don't have a deciduous tree that gives a glorious show of leaf color 
in the fall, check at your local nursery and see what they suggest for your 
area of the state. Don't prune existing deciduous trees until they are 
completely dormant this winter. 
</P>
<P>
* You can lift and divide phlox and primroses this month. 
</P>
<P>
* Soggy soil from winter rain will rot the tubers of tuberous begonias, so be 
sure to lift them out of the ground and store them in a cool, dry area.

FAST-GROWING TREES TO GUARD YOUR PRIVACY; 
</P>
<P>
EVERGREENS: THE TRICK IS TO PLANT TREES THAT DON'T GROW TOO TALL, TOO WIDE OR 
MAKE A MESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN BOLTON, Bolton is a free-lance writer based in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's familiar quest for many Southern California gardeners: the search for an 
evergreen tree that will quickly soar above a six-foot fence to block a view of 
the neighbors. But then it must stop before it towers over the rest of the back 
yard and casts shadows everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen to 25 feet of fast growth will do, with a leafy canopy about as wide. 
In smaller urban gardens, that's probably all the space to be had. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is, many young trees that look so appealing in their nursery cans 
become too tall, too wide, too messy or too lacy to provide a solid block. 
</P>
<P>
But there are a few winners. Most are readily available for fall planting. 
Because of their smaller scale, some are commonly grown as large shrubs. But 
they're easily trained as trees. Or you can get a head start by buying or 
ordering "standards," which have already been pruned into tree form. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bronze Loquat 
</P>
<P>
Ideal for cramped gardens or filtered shade, bronze loquat (Eriobotrya deflexa) 
tops out at about 20 feet. Long, new leaves emerge a rich, reddish-brown, then 
gradually change to dark green. In spring, fragrant white flowers similar to 
apple blossoms appear clustered on branch tips. 
</P>
<P>
The small, yellow-green fruit is not edible, but does attract birds. (The 
larger Eriobotrya japonica produces edible fruit.) Bronze loquat does well 
along the coast or inland with regular, deep watering. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fraser Photinia 
</P>
<P>
This popular street tree (Photinia fraseri) tolerates a host of urban woes: 
smog, dust, heat, even sprinklers. Mature leaves are dark green, while new 
leaves and stems are bright red. Plentiful clusters of white flowers top the 
red tips for a splendid, spring display. 
</P>
<P>
Although it adapts well to espaliering or shaping, fall pruning does limit 
spring flowering. Photina prefers full sun and frequent, deep watering early on 
to develop drought resistance. Provide good drainage -- in constantly wet clay, 
leaves may yellow and drop. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hopseed Bush 
</P>
<P>
Native to the harsh, Arizona desert, hopseed bush (Dodonea viscosa) tolerates 
everything from salt spray to winds and dry heat. Its long, narrow, upright 
leaves form a dense, willow-like screen. 
</P>
<P>
Cold weather causes the rusty-purple leaves of 'Purpurea' to turn bright purple 
(it reverts in spring). Full sun helps sustain the distinctive color. Tiny 
spring flowers are barely noticeable, but clusters of pale pink seed pods in 
late summer are interesting and rustle in the wind. With regular water, hopseed 
bush grows fast. With less, it remains compact. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lemon Bottlebrush 
</P>
<P>
Hummingbirds descend on lemon bottlebrush (Callistemon citrinus) whenever a 
flush of bright red "brushes" of flowers appear. Bloom peaks in early summer, 
although some flowering occurs all year. Left unpruned, it forms a round, 
12-foot-tall bush. But with shaping, its gnarled branches grow into a graceful, 
slender tree to 25 feet. Lemon bottlebrush tolerates heavy soil, smog, wind and 
heat, and may become drought-resistant over time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pineapple Guava 
</P>
<P>
One of the prettiest flowering and fruiting small trees, pineapple guava 
(Feijoa sellowiana) pumps out showy, edible, red-and-white flower clusters in 
early summer, followed by edible, gray-green fruit. Its clean, oval leaves are 
glossy green on top and pale-gray underneath. In coastal areas, it requires 
full sun. Inland, provides filtered shade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shiny Xylosma 
</P>
<P>
Commonly seen as a hedge, shiny xylosma (Xylosma congestum) is also a fine, 
quick-growing tree. Glossy, apple-green leaves are tinged with red when they 
emerge. 
</P>
<P>
Left to their own devices, the branches droop, crisscross and dangle in odd 
directions. But with direction and pruning, it grows into a graceful, 
multi-trunked tree to 25 feet. Shiny xylosma tolerates most soils and weather 
conditions, but may drop leaves after a severe frost.

BE CAREFUL OF EFFECT OF HEATING ON HOUSEPLANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The African violet is a lovely houseplant that can and will bloom almost 
continuously throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
Other houseplants are just as lovely whether they also offer flowers or are 
known for their attractive foliage. 
</P>
<P>
Take care of them this fall and winter months so they don't suffer. In heating 
your home, the air gets drier and the heat should not blow directly onto any 
plant. Window areas are cold and sometimes too cold for houseplants. Many 
houseplants go dormant at this time, and they should be allowed their rest. 
They can use only a limited amount of water. When spring comes, they will again 
return to normal needs.

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: BALANCED FUNDS LOOK BETTER OVER LONG HAUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES is editor of Personal Investor, a national 
consumer-finance magazine based in Irvine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Looking at the recent performance of balanced funds and their near cousins, you 
can't help but be reminded of the proverbial glass that's either half full or 
half empty. 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, balanced funds -- defensive portfolios that maintain at least 
some stock holdings -- have held up much better than equity funds in general 
during this difficult year. 
</P>
<P>
But on the other hand, most balanced funds are showing losses for 1990 and will 
wind up in the red unless stocks rally strongly during the next seven weeks. If 
you bought a balanced portfolio under the notion that it would avoid losing 
money, you might be in for a surprise. Several of these funds have stumbled by 
more than 10% so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
For the group as a whole, the losses aren't nearly as severe. The average 
balanced fund declined 6%, including dividend income, during the first 10 
months of the year, according to Lipper Analytical Services. That's not bad 
compared to an average 13.8% setback for equity funds. Balanced portfolios 
typically hold stocks, bonds and cash, and the latter two components help 
cushion any blows. It's not misleading to think of balanced funds as 
"all-weather" investments. 
</P>
<P>
In hindsight, you would have been better off this year holding bonds or cash, 
of course. That might still be the wisest investment strategy. Walter Rouleau, 
editor of the Growth Fund Guide newsletter in Rapid City, S.D., suspects that 
stocks will decline even further in the months ahead and thus recommends money 
market funds that hold short-term U.S. government debt instruments. 
</P>
<P>
But if you switch to cash, you will eventually have to decide when to get back 
into equities. With balanced funds, there's no such decision to make. Because 
they maintain at least some stock holdings at all times, they will participate 
in any rallies. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, if you're a conservative investor who recognizes that stocks -- unlike 
bonds or cash -- tend to beat inflation by a comfortable margin over lengthy 
periods, balanced funds might be a wise choice. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to get quite a few people, especially those in their mid-50s 
and up, to come back to the stock market at all," says James B. Rea Jr., 
president of the Rea-Graham Balanced Fund, based in West Los Angeles. "This is 
a good way to get them to stay with equities over the long haul." 
</P>
<P>
Dick Strong, head of Strong Funds in Milwaukee, believes that the balanced 
approach is the wisest choice for smaller investors lacking the money to buy a 
lot of funds. He suggests diversifying among three balanced portfolios run by 
different firms. "Go with the three best management companies you can find." 
</P>
<P>
Following that advice should lead to even less volatility and more consistent 
returns than a single portfolio can deliver. For although balanced fund 
managers are a conservative lot, they don't necessarily share similar market 
outlooks. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Strong has a decidedly bearish lean at the moment. He's concerned 
about a sluggish economy, negative inflation-adjusted growth in the money 
supply and sickness in the banking sector. "Banks serve as the heart in terms 
of the flow of money in the system. If there's a heart attack, that would lead 
to other problems." Strong says he would grow more optimistic if bank stocks, 
badly battered of late, showed signs of firming. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Rea has turned cautiously optimistic. "The current bear market is 
already a year old. We think now might be the time to buy." Since late August, 
Rea-Graham Balanced's common stock weighting has increased to 32% from 26%, 
with cash and a few bonds composing the remainder. But just in case this 
bullishness is unwarranted, the fund maintains a decidedly risk-averse posture; 
its stock holdings sell at an average price/earnings ratio of just 7. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, balanced funds aren't the only low-risk equity selections available. 
Here's a look at some of the other categories that fit an all-weather 
description: 
</P>
<P>
* Asset allocation. These funds typically hold more than just equities, bonds 
and cash. For example, USAA Cornerstone, run by USAA Investment Management of 
San Antonio, maintains roughly equal weightings in gold stocks, foreign stocks, 
government bonds, real estate stocks and "basic value" shares. Rouleau likes 
this fund but says it has been bogged down by the gold holdings. Cornerstone 
gained at least 8% annually each year from 1985 through 1989, but it dropped 
13% through Oct. 31 of this year. 
</P>
<P>
* Income. Funds in this group are generally more conservative than their 
balanced cousins, simply because they focus more on bonds and less on stocks. 
According to Morningstar Inc. of Chicago, the average income portfolio has 52% 
of its assets in bonds, 30% in stocks and 11% in cash. For balanced funds, the 
numbers are: stocks 50%, bonds 32% and cash 13%. 
</P>
<P>
* Utility. Funds that focus on utility stocks and, to a lesser extent, bonds 
often hold up well during broad market declines. That's because electric and 
natural gas companies tend to pay big dividends, and that gives their shares a 
bondlike resiliency. 
</P>
<P>
But the telecommunications business is another matter. Deregulation, the 
explosion of cellular phones and fax machines, and other factors have 
transformed once-sedate telephone utilities into growth enterprises. As a 
result, phone stocks have become more volatile, as have the funds that buy 
them. Fidelity's Select Telecommunications fund, for example, plunged 24% 
through Oct. 31 of this year after a 51% gain in 1989. So, when examining a 
utility fund, be sure to find out if it's a slow mover or a volatile selection. 
</P>
<P>
The same goes for other types of funds, too. Some growth portfolios, for 
example, are remarkably defensive (see chart). That goes to show you can't 
always judge a fund by its label. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ALL WEATHER FUNDS 
</P>
<P>
If you can't stand much risk, you'll want to select mutual funds that give 
ground grudgingly. That would eliminate the vast majority of stock-oriented 
portfolios, most of which are showing double-digit losses so far in 1990. But 
not the funds listed below. None has lost more than 1% in any of the past five 
calendar years, and a few have done considerably better.

SMOG: IN THE SIX MONTHS THAT ENDED NOV. 1, THE LOS ANGELES BASIN HAD THE 
CLEANEST AIR SINCE RECORDS BEGAN IN 1955, AIR QUALITY OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Clean air is in the eyes -- or is it the lungs? -- of the beholder. 
</P>
<P>
Air quality officials announced this month that during the six-month smog 
season that ended Nov. 1, the Los Angeles Basin had the cleanest air they have 
ever recorded. There were fewer smog alerts in 1990 than in any year since 
records for Southern California were first kept in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
Many people in the San Gabriel Valley say they can see and feel the 
improvement. But they also say the San Gabriel Valley is a long way from 
breathing clean, healthy air. And experts agree. 
</P>
<P>
The San Gabriel Valley still reports more smog alerts at its four air quality 
stations than any other part of the basin. That makes it the nation's smoggiest 
region. 
</P>
<P>
Also, while controls on auto and industrial emissions have helped clean the 
air, a significant part of the most recent improvement is believed to be caused 
by favorable weather conditions that may not last, said officials at the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers suggest that San Gabriel Valley residents continue to lose lung 
capacity from living in the ozone-laden air. And one city, Glendora, still has 
to bridle under its designation as "America's Smoggiest City." 
</P>
<P>
But first, the good news: 
</P>
<P>
The San Gabriel Valley's four air monitors -- in Azusa, Glendora, Pasadena and 
Pomona -- reported a total of 60 smog alert days during the 1990 "smog season," 
compared to 94 in 1989. As recently as 1982, the four monitors recorded 170 
smog alert days. 
</P>
<P>
Air quality officials declare first-stage smog alerts when ozone, the area's 
principal pollutant, reaches .20 parts per million. Second-stage smog alerts 
are declared when ozone reaches .35 parts per million. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1990 smog season -- for the fourth year in a row -- no second-stage 
alerts were declared in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD officials called the improvements "mind-boggling" and "dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
In the San Gabriel Valley itself, most people judge the smog by looking toward 
the San Gabriel Mountains. And by this measure, as well, many have seen 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question I go out from my house more days and say, 'Aren't the 
mountains beautiful!' " said Glendora Mayor Bob Kuhn. "I used to go out and 
say, 'Where are the mountains?' " 
</P>
<P>
The improvement can also be seen on the pages of the Glendora Unified School 
District's "Smog Book." The district has an ozone meter and logs days on which 
schools are notified to curtail students' exercise. The book shows 43 such 
alerts in 1986, compared to nine in 1989 and just two this year. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD officials say the air has improved substantially over the last decade, in 
large part because of greater controls on car exhausts and industrial 
emissions. "When you compare it with the past, it's like night and day," said 
Joe Cassmassi, senior meteorologist with the AQMD. "There's really been a 
dramatic improvement." 
</P>
<P>
In this year's improvement, favorable weather conditions also played an 
important part, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Ozone forms in the air when hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides emitted by cars 
and industry are exposed to sunlight. High pressure holds the pollution close 
to the ground and prevents it from blowing away. 
</P>
<P>
But more low-pressure systems penetrated the Los Angeles Basin in the last 
year, cleaning the air, said Joe Cassmassi, AQMD senior meteorologist. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the days of improvement are based on weather conditions," Cassmassi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Weighing the impact of weather against emission controls is difficult, he said. 
Researchers have estimated that this year, an average of four smog-alert days 
were eliminated at each smog station by pollution controls, and the rest by 
helpful weather, Cassmassi said. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say the elements will not always be so accommodating. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers added that although they are encouraged by the lower ozone levels, 
residents' health is still suffering because of air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
There were still 180 days this year when ozone levels at least one reporting 
station in the Los Angeles area exceeded the state's more stringent clean air 
standard of .09 parts per million of ozone, the AQMD reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly it's good news that we have had fewer alerts and lower levels of 
pollution," said Roger Detels, a professor of epidemiology at UCLA's School of 
Public Health. "But we should continue to be concerned about levels of air 
pollution." 
</P>
<P>
Detels and a UCLA research group will soon publish the latest chapter in a 
study that has documented the decreased lung function of people who live in 
polluted areas. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers compared residents of Glendora and Long Beach with Lancaster, a 
control area with relatively cleaner air. 
</P>
<P>
"Young people tend to have an increase in lung function until the age of about 
25," Detels said. "But in the polluted areas kids did not have as large an 
increase as in the control area. And after 25 years of age they had a greater 
decline in lung function." 
</P>
<P>
The findings support research at USC, which showed that second-graders in the 
Los Angeles Unified School District had 10% to 15% less lung capacity than a 
comparable group of children in Houston. And their lung capacity did not 
increase as much between the second and fifth grades as the Houston children's, 
said Kaye Kilburn, the USC professor of medicine who directed the study. 
</P>
<P>
Another USC study showed notable lung abnormalities in 80% of 100 youths who 
died in homicides or accidents. 
</P>
<P>
"I think essentially what we have accomplished is to stay in the same place 
over the last decade," Kilburn said. "We have absorbed more people and more 
automobiles and we have managed to not let the air pollution situation get 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
In the San Gabriel Valley, there is a feeling of impotence in fighting the 
pollution that blows in from the west and settles against the foothills. 
</P>
<P>
Glendora has recorded the most smog alerts in the South Coast Air Basin, and 
thus the nation, every year since 1982. But city officials are quick to point 
out that they are bearing the brunt of a region-wide problem. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not our smog," said Glendora Mayor Pro Tem Larry Glenn. "It blows in here 
and it has nowhere else to go." 
</P>
<P>
City leaders have also been disgruntled about the location of a smog-monitoring 
station in their city. They say Glendora's air quality is no worse than in 
surrounding areas, but that the city's reputation has suffered because the 
Glendora station is near the base of the mountains, where air is the most 
stagnant. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD officials disagree that the Glendora station is unfairly located, saying 
the monitor on Leadora Avenue records about the same levels of ozone that have 
been recorded during spot checks in the rest of the community. 
</P>
<P>
But AQMD officials agreed that Glendora's air is not necessarily much worse 
than the rest of the San Gabriel Valley's. 
</P>
<P>
The Azusa station, for example, reported fewer than half the smog alerts that 
Glendora did this year. But the Azusa monitor has more auto traffic nearby than 
Glendora's, so it registers higher levels of pollutants that come directly from 
car tailpipes, such as nitrogen dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
These "primary" pollutants tend to force out ozone, which is the most prevalent 
and most often cited measure of pollution, said AQMD spokeswoman Claudia Keith. 
</P>
<P>
Glendora officials said most people do not pay attention to such subtle 
distinctions. 
</P>
<P>
The officials were so upset three years ago by the city's high pollution 
readings that they asked AQMD officials if they could move the smog station 
elsewhere, said City Manager Art Cook. The AQMD, however, said it needed the 
same station to consistently report air quality trends. 
</P>
<P>
"We more or less agreed they could keep it here," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
But boosters in a city that calls itself "The Pride of the Foothills" still 
don't like the bad publicity that comes with the high ozone readings. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, we have another agency that is trying to deter our pride or 
tarnish our image," Cook said. "The thing that frustrates me is the lack of 
comparable monitoring stations throughout the foothill communities. 
</P>
<P>
"We are kind of being pegged as the bad boy of the San Gabriel Valley," he 
said. "I think we are being made a scapegoat, in a certain sense." 
</P>
<P>
Most people in Glendora say they have adapted to the bad air with small 
lifestyle changes -- exercising in the mornings and evenings when ozone levels 
are lowest and staying inside on the worst days. 
</P>
<P>
Among shoppers who streamed in and out of a local supermarket recently, the 
majority said the city's low crime rate, highly rated schools and small-town 
feel more than compensate for the brown curtain that usually shrouds the San 
Gabriels. 
</P>
<P>
A little humor doesn't hurt, either. 
</P>
<P>
"I have lived in Glendora since 1961," says Mayor Kuhn. "Fortunately, I have 
never smoked, so I'm probably about (as healthy as) a guy out in the desert who 
has smoked all his life." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SMOG ALERT DAYS 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 smog season, which started May 1 and ended Nov. 1, was the cleanest on 
record in the Los Angeles Basin. The following chart shows the number of first 
stage/second stage smog alert days for ozone throughout the past decade at each 
of the San Gabriel Valley's four reporting stations. Ozone is an invisible 
pollutant that is created when sunlight hits contaminants released by cars and 
industry. First stage alerts (the first number listed) are reported when ozone 
reaches .20 parts per million of ozone, while second-stage alerts are called at 
.35 ppm and above.

L.B. FOLLOWS TREND IN RECORDING FAR BETTER AIR QUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clean air is in the eyes -- or is it the lungs? -- of the beholder. 
</P>
<P>
Air quality officials announced this month that during the six-month smog 
season that ended Nov. 1, the Los Angeles Basin had the cleanest air they have 
ever recorded. There were fewer smog alerts in 1990 than in any year since 
records for Southern California were first maintained in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
That trend held true in Long Beach and southeastern Los Angeles County, which 
did not record a single smog alert, according to the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District. 
</P>
<P>
The showing was especially significant for the two AQMD recording stations in 
the southeastern communities of Pico Rivera and Whittier. As recently as 1984, 
these two stations recorded smog alerts on a total 41 days. 
</P>
<P>
Air district officials called the improvements "mind-boggling" and "dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
But AQMD officials and health experts also say it is too soon to celebrate a 
victory over smog. They say ozone levels are still too high, and other types of 
pollution are actually on the increase in parts of the county's Southeast area. 
</P>
<P>
First the good news: 
</P>
<P>
So far in 1990, AQMD air-quality stations in Long Beach, Whittier, Pico Rivera 
and Lynwood have not reached the .20 parts per million threshold for ozone 
that, under the air district's standards, triggers a smog alert. This is the 
fifth year running that Long Beach has not suffered a smog alert and the second 
year in a row without an alert in Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government uses a more stringent standard for ozone pollution -- 
.12 parts per million. The total number of hours in which ozone topped this 
federal clean-air standard also declined this past smog season compared to 
1989: from 7 to 0 hours in Long Beach, from 90 to 37 in Whittier, from 10 to 3 
in Lynwood and from 150 to 82 in Pico Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
"People here say the smog seems to be getting somewhat better," said Pico 
Rivera City Manager Dennis Courtemarche. "When I first came here in 1982, I 
noticed a little difficulty breathing and I don't notice that as much." 
</P>
<P>
Ozone is a "secondary" pollutant that forms in the air when hydrocarbons and 
nitrogen oxides emitted by cars and industry are exposed to sunlight. That type 
of pollution is worse in inland areas like the San Gabriel Valley, where 
temperatures are higher and the air more stagnant. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD officials say ozone has dropped substantially over the last decade, in 
large part because of greater controls on car exhausts and industrial 
emissions. "When you compare it with the past, it's like night and day," said 
Joe Cassmassi, senior meteorologist with the AQMD. "There's really been a 
dramatic improvement." 
</P>
<P>
But the Southeast has not fared as well with "primary" pollutants, the 
compounds that are spewed directly out of automobile tailpipes and industrial 
smokestacks. 
</P>
<P>
The Lynwood AQMD station, for example, had the highest readings in the Los 
Angeles Basin for carbon monoxide, which comes mostly from car exhausts. It 
showed 55 days in 1989 above the federal threshold of 9.5 parts per million for 
an eight-hour period. Statistics are not yet available for this year for the 
compound, but the federal standard was exceeded 51 times in 1988 and just 32 in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
Carbon monoxide limits the blood's ability to carry oxygen, causing headaches, 
dizziness and shortness of breath. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach/Southeast area also suffered from industrial pollutants, such as 
sulfur dioxide. AQMD stations in Long Beach, Pico Rivera and Lynwood join the 
city of Hawthorne with the highest levels of that pollutant in the basin. 
Sulfur dioxide can cause coughing and nose, throat and eye irritation. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you really turn around and tell people the air is improving when you are 
only talking about one of the constituents, ozone?" said Dr. Russell Sherwin, a 
professor of pathology at the USC School of Medicine. "We understate, rather 
than overstate, what the problem is." 
</P>
<P>
Some Southern Californians believe they are protected from air pollution 
because of their proximity to ocean winds. "The people in Long Beach couldn't 
understand why we were there," said Roger Detels, a UCLA professor of 
epidemiology who studied air pollution in the city. "People would say, 'We are 
on the coast, why would you want to test us?' " While coastal communities still 
are considered to have the cleanest air, Detels and a UCLA research group will 
soon publish the latest chapter in a study showing that areas only slightly 
inland are not immune from pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers compared residents of Glendora and Long Beach with Lancaster, a 
control area with relatively cleaner air. 
</P>
<P>
"Young people tend to have an increase in lung function until the age of about 
25," Detels said. "But in the polluted areas kids did not have as large an 
increase as in the control area. And after 25 years of age they had a greater 
decline in lung function." 
</P>
<P>
The lung performance was as bad for subjects in Long Beach as in Glendora, 
which has the basin's highest ozone concentrations, Detels said. 
</P>
<P>
Other research also has documented the health problems caused by air pollution, 
particularly for children. A USC study, for instance, showed that 
second-graders in the Los Angeles Unified School District had 10% to 15% less 
lung capacity than a comparable group of children in Houston. And their lung 
capacity did not increase as much between the second and fifth grades as did 
the Houston children's, said Dr. Kaye Kilburn, the USC professor of medicine 
who directed the study. 
</P>
<P>
And Sherwin, the USC pathology professor, found "notable" lung abnormalities in 
80% of 100 Los Angeles-area youths who died in homicides or accidents. 
</P>
<P>
"I think essentially what we have accomplished is to stay in the same place 
over the last decade," Kilburn said. "We have absorbed more people and more 
automobiles and we have managed to not let the air pollution situation get 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
The California Air Resources Board is concerned about elevated levels of 
primary pollutants in southern Los Angeles County, said John R. Holmes, the 
board's director of research. 
</P>
<P>
Air board researchers last December and January surveyed thousands of cars and 
analyzed traffic patterns in low-income areas of south Los Angeles in search of 
high carbon monoxide emissions. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators theorize that poor residents might drive older cars that are 
not equipped with contemporary emission-control devices. They also suspect that 
the area suffers because it is crisscrossed by several freeways and because 
poorly synchronized traffic signals increase stop-and-go driving. 
</P>
<P>
The air board expects to have results from its study early next year, Holmes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SMOG ALERT DAYS 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 smog season, which started May 1 and ended Nov. 1, was the cleanest on 
record in the Los Angeles Basin. The following chart shows the number of first 
stage/second stage smog alert days for ozone throughout the past decade at each 
of the reporting stations in Long Beach and Southeast Los Angeles County. Ozone 
is an invisible pollutant that is created when sunlight hits contaminants 
released by cars and industry. First stage alerts (the first number listed) are 
reported when ozone reaches .20 parts per million of ozone, while second-stage 
alerts are called at .35 ppm and above.

AT HOME : A WEE BIT OF SCOTLAND ON THE WESTSIDE; 
</P>
<P>
CHEVIOT HILLS: THE SQUARE-MILE COMMUNITY ECHOES THE SCOTTISH THEME IN ITS 
STREET NAMES, SUCH AS DUMFRIES AND WIGTOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA BENNETT, Bennett is a free-lance writer who lives in Cheviot Hills. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1986, Timothy Homan, a math teacher at Santa Monica High School, bought a 
three-bedroom fixer-upper in Cheviot Hills for $260,000. 
</P>
<P>
Investing $100,000, he added a bathroom, replumbed, relandscaped, refinished 
floors, made cosmetic changes, including wallpaper and paint, and sold the 
house in 1988 for $550,000. 
</P>
<P>
But Homan didn't take his profit and move on. 
</P>
<P>
"I fell in love with Cheviot Hills," he said, "and I found my dream house" -- a 
2,500-square-foot, two-story home that he bought for $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It has three bedrooms, two baths and sits on a beautiful lot and a half, so 
there's great potential to add on," Homan said. "I have wonderful plans for 
this home and I plan to live in it for a long time to come." 
</P>
<P>
Originally a section of farmland famous for its celery, beans and oranges, the 
neighborhood of Cheviot Hills is about one square mile of undulating, 
tree-lined streets located south of Century City and 20th Century Fox Studios, 
north of the Santa Monica Freeway and to either side of Motor Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Built up during the 1930s, '40s and '50s, the area was named by two developers 
who were inspired by the original Cheviot Hills of Scotland. The Scottish theme 
is echoed in its street names, such as Dumfries, Haddington, Wigtown, Troon. 
</P>
<P>
Kaye Van Horn, a field aide for Rep. Tony Beilenson (D-Los Angeles), has lived 
in more than one home in Cheviot Hills -- like many of her neighbors -- and has 
never wanted to leave the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who live here are in love with its unique physical beauty," she said. 
"It's an established community with a special character . . . lovely older 
homes and beautiful landscapes . . . excellent schools and convenient 
location." 
</P>
<P>
"One of this neighborhood's greatest virtues is its accessibility," said 
Richard Van Horn, director of the Mental Health Assn. in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's close to the business communities on the Westside . . . and, because the 
freeway is so close, you can be in downtown Los Angeles or LAX in 15 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
The community is also a "wonderful area to raise children," said Lynn Angalet, 
who with her husband, Bruce, an educational consultant, are raising 4-year-old 
Jason. 
</P>
<P>
"Eight years ago, there were only three children on our street," she said. 
"Then, about the same time that Jason was born, there was a kind of baby boom 
and now there are more than 17 children on our block alone. 
</P>
<P>
"Our older neighbors are terrific. They've all told us how happy they are to 
have young children playing in the neighborhood again." 
</P>
<P>
However, the Angalets face troubling issues common to other couples raising 
families in Los Angeles, including the influence of gangs and drugs in the 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought about sending Jason to a private school but Overland Elementary had 
an orientation program recently that convinced us that it's a very fine school. 
The teachers are very good; they have new equipment; they provide an excellent 
after-school day-care program for working parents, and they have tremendous 
parent involvement," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Millie Chase, a longtime resident who sold real estate in the area with her 
husband, Jack, until they retired in 1978, recalled the early days when the 
land was sold lot by lot. 
</P>
<P>
"The homes were built as the lots were sold -- they were meant to blend in with 
the scenery. It was quite common at that time to have only one house on an 
entire block. That's why Cheviot Hills doesn't have a tract look. That is also 
why the streets stop and start so abruptly." 
</P>
<P>
The houses reflect a variety of architectural styles -- Norman French nestles 
comfortably beside Mediterranean, Spanish mingles with traditional. 
</P>
<P>
Of particular delight to residents are the cottages built in the 1940s and '50s 
by the late Edmond J. Aiken. Sometimes called English cottages or "witches 
houses," the homes rest in cozy landscapes with slanting thatched roofs, 
curving brick walkways and thick mortar oozing between brick and stonework. 
</P>
<P>
Working with his own crew, which included his son, Aiken filled the 
small-scaled rooms with handcrafted doors, beamed ceilings, walls and floors, 
all of which were finished with original paints and stains. 
</P>
<P>
Originally a shipbuilder, Aiken made use of every cozy corner, fashioning 
shelves for display, cupboards for storage and half-oval fireplaces that 
provide a view of crackling fires from any seat in the room. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Aiken built practical, lovable homes, and catered to young couples on 
tight budgets because he knew they would love his homes as much as he did," 
said Rosemary Peters, who with her husband, Ralph, a stockbroker, arranged for 
Aiken to build their first home in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
"He loved funny, odd-shaped lots and would design the house to fit the lot," 
Peters said. "In fact, following his advice, we rejected one parcel that was 
too ordinary for his taste and chose instead a uniquely shaped lot across the 
street that suited the character of our home perfectly." 
</P>
<P>
"He was an artist," said Virginia Counts, who with her husband, J. Curtis, 
bought an Aiken home in 1948. Like other Aiken owners, the Counts kept in touch 
with the beloved home builder and visited him in Northern California shortly 
before his death in 1988 at the age of 99. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Aiken used odd lots of brick and wood that make inevitable repairs next to 
impossible, but also make his unique homes one-of-a-kind treasures," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Like much Southland real estate, Cheviot Hills experienced extraordinary 
appreciation in the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Eliane and Armand Capdeville have lived in Cheviot Hills since the early 1970s 
and have worked together as a real estate agents for most of that time in 
Cheviot Hills, Rancho Park and Century City. They now work for Prudential 
California Realty. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1970, an average 2,000-square-foot home in Cheviot Hills sold for $50,000 
to $70,000. Today, that same home is valued at between $700,000 and $800,000," 
the Capdevilles said. 
</P>
<P>
"And Aiken homes have always been worth more per square footage than any other 
homes. In the early 1970s a 1,200-square-foot, two-bedroom, one-bath Aiken home 
was valued at $60,000; today its value would begin in the mid-$500,000 range." 
</P>
<P>
"There is a special feeling of community that has been maintained throughout 
the years," said Millie Chase, a longtime member of the Cheviot Hills 
Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"The neighbors on our street have a summer block party," she said. "Everyone 
joins in and brings potluck. I'm particularly impressed with the enthusiasm of 
our younger neighbors, one of whom arranged for someone from UCLA to come to 
speak to us and helped our block organize a neighborhood earthquake awareness 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Each neighbor knows the names of every adult and child living in each home, 
the names of their pets and the names of anyone who lives with them or works 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
The neighbors have even chipped in to buy a generator for emergency use in case 
of an earthquake disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always had a strong homeowners' association that's taken on City Hall 
more than once concerning issues affecting our neighborhood, such as the 
commercial development of areas surrounding Century City and what is now known 
as the Westside Pavilion -- development that alarms many of the residents," 
Chase said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some battles we win, some we lose, but it has always been a dedicated group of 
individuals willing to work hard for issues that are important to the residents 
of Cheviot Hills."

DAN LAURIA IS PARENTAL AGAIN IN NBC'S MOVIE ABOUT 'THE BIG ONE' 
</P>

<P>
I've never been married and I have never had any kids," said Dan Lauria, "but 
Ikeep getting these parts." 
</P>
<P>
Over the last three years, Lauria, along with Bill Cosby and Homer Simpson, 
hasbecome one of the best-known TV dads in America thanks to his memorable role 
asthe grumpy, larger-than-life Jack Arnold, the father of 14-year-old Kevin 
Arnold(Fred Savage) on ABC's "The Wonder Years." 
</P>
<P>
The Long Island native is portraying another husband and father in 
NBC'stwo-part miniseries, "The Big One: The Great Los Angeles Earthquake," 
which airsSunday and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Lauria plays the landscape architect husband of a U.S. seismologist 
(JoannaKerns) who believes a major earthquake is about to hit Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a nice guy and I support her. I am not a grump like I am on this show," 
hesaid over lunch at "The Wonder Years" set in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
The actor said the miniseries bears no resemblance to the 1974 
film"Earthquake." "I see this as a protest film," he said. 'Seismologists feel 
nowthat in a 48-hour period they can predict major earthquakes. The 
governmentpolicy is not to inform the people because they fear panic will cause 
moredeaths. A lot of seismologists feel that if people were warned they could 
be insafer places. That's the issue of the movie." 
</P>
<P>
Lauria may be the prototype '60s dad on "The Wonder Years," but before 
theseries he was usually cast as a killer or policeman: "I played a killer pimp 
on'One Life to Live.' " My claim to fame is that I am the one who raped Judy 
Light(Judith Light of "Who's the Boss?") on television." 
</P>
<P>
Lauria was also kicked off the air by the Rev.Jerry Falwell. "It was 1981 and 
hecomplained about violence on daytime TV," he said. So without a warning, 
ABCgave Lauria his pink slip. 
</P>
<P>
"It all worked out for the best," he said. "The following year they brought on 
anew bad guy and he needed a henchman, so they brought me back. So I was 
atwo-year bad guy." 
</P>
<P>
While a fledgling actor in New York, Lauria found it difficult to get an 
agent."They said I was a hard sell because I wasn't anything," he said. "I 
wasn'ttall, I wasn't short, I wasn't fat, I wasn't skinny, I wasn't handsome, I 
wasn'tugly. I just didn't fit anything. I was really depressed and my teacher 
said,'How lucky you are.' I said, 'What do you mean?' She said when they find 
out youcan act, that means you can play anything. So now, I am getting a chance 
to playanything." 
</P>
<P>
Lauria receives letters from fathers after certain episodes of "The 
WonderYears." "The one where I brought little Fred to work with me I got 50 
fanletters, all from older men saying, 'Thanks a lot. Now I know why my son 
thinksI am a such a jerk.' " 
</P>
<P>
Lauria doesn't think Jack Arnold has changed, but "the kids, especially 
Kevin,are starting to see the practicalities of life and how his father deals 
withthat," Lauria said. 
</P>
<P>
Lauria's own parents were wonderful. "It's a real handicap in L.A.," he 
saidwith a laugh. "I have no hang-ups. I don't have to go to psychiatrists. 
Theywere really nice people. My father was a very quiet, gentle guy and my 
mother isjust funny. So I had a great childhood. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't rich, but I played sports all of my life, which I really 
thinkhelped me with acting as far as discipline. Jack Arnold is not like my 
dad. Inever saw my dad growl. Where Jack growls, my father would have probably 
laughedit off." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his success on the series, Lauria's main love is the theater. Last 
yearhe produced the hit play "A Bronx Tale" in Los Angeles and sold the film 
rightsto Universal. "Robert De Niro is directing and starring in it," he said. 
"Theyare supposed to start shooting by August, 1991, and we got paid, so if 
theydon't shoot we still keep the money." 
</P>
<P>
Lauria has been trying for years to persuade the film and TV industries 
tosupport theater as a form of development. "It costs about $30,000 to do one 
ofthese waiver (small theater) plays for five weeks," said Lauria. "But you 
knowwhat? It cost us $30,000 to do 'A Bronx Tale,' and we made a deal for 
$1.7million. It's a very cheap form of development. The head of 
development'sexpense account at any studio is going to exceed what it costs for 
us to put onfour plays." 
</P>
<P>
He hopes to finish "The Wonder Years" early this season so he can get back 
toNew York City and the stage. "I haven't done a play in two years," Lauria 
said."I was always very happy when I was in a play. Half of them I didn't get 
paidfor, but I didn't care. We were doing good work. 
</P>
<P>
"My agents were the ones who said I had won enough awards and now it was time 
toget national recognition. The only way to do that was to get on a series or 
do afilm, and that's why I came out here. Now hopefully, when 'The Wonder 
Years' isover, I can go back and do theater. No good actor stays away from the 
theatertoo long." 
</P>
<P>
"The Big One: The Great Los Angeles Earthquake" airs Sunday and Monday at 9 
p.m. on NBC. "The Wonder Years" airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. on ABC.

ENGINEERS PLAN TO ROLL FAST ON MEASURE M LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a portrait in commuter frustration. John Randell likes to avoid the 
freeway when he drives from his Mission Viejo home to work in Irvine, so he 
spins up Alton Parkway. But it's no quick fix. 
</P>
<P>
Although the broad thoroughfare is hardly bumper to bumper, its traffic signals 
are so poorly synchronized that Randell said he typically grinds to a halt at 
20 or more red lights over just 10 miles. He knows. He's counted them. The 
result is a trip that sometimes takes an agonizing 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But now there's relief in sight. With voter approval last week of Measure M, 
the half-cent sales tax increase, there will soon be a flood of dollars to 
quell many of the most exasperating transportation dilemmas in Orange County, 
among them the synchronizing problem on Alton Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
Keep an eye out. It'll be coming soon to a street corner near you. Up and down 
Orange County, from Stanton to San Clemente, residents should begin noticing 
changes on the highway in the months to come, courtesy of Measure M. 
</P>
<P>
A plethora of orange traffic cones will signal the start. More work crews than 
ever before will begin ladling out asphalt along roads and freeways. New trains 
gorged with commuters headed for Los Angeles or arriving from Riverside are 
eventually expected to click down the tracks. If all goes according to plan, 
the end result will be swifter trips for everyone, whether they're bound for 
work or the local grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
The $3.1-billion infusion of cash expected from Measure M should trickle down 
in varied ways that will be noticeable to anyone who ventures out on the 
county's traffic-choked roads and highways. Improvements will range from subtle 
to substantial, transportation authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
Potholes will be repaired a bit more promptly. Road-widening projects that 
would have gone begging for decades will become a reality far sooner. 
Intersections that once lacked enough left-turn lanes or a simple right-hand 
turn pocket will begin to sprout such improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Car-pool lanes will be added in each direction on the Riverside and Orange 
freeways. Efforts to transform the Santa Ana Freeway from a antiquated, 
car-clogged interstate into a 12-lane superhighway will be speeded up 
dramatically, with the entire project now expected to be completed by the end 
of the decade instead of 2010 or later. 
</P>
<P>
An ambitious new monorail or trolley system could emerge in Central County, 
thanks in large part to money from Measure M. 
</P>
<P>
"It will touch everyone in Orange County," said Stanley T. Oftelie, executive 
director of the Orange County Transportation Commission (OCTC). "We're going to 
be rebuilding our transportation system. We're going to use this money to make 
up for past years of neglect and then keep up and get ahead of the curve." 
</P>
<P>
Like most things in life, all the work can hardly happen fast enough. Money 
from Measure M will trickle in over 20 years, meaning that many of the biggest 
projects will have to be spaced carefully to avoid exhausting the cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, county transportation officials are trying to get a head start on the 
effort, boldly pledging to push ahead immediately, although the half-cent tax 
will not start kicking in at county cash registers until April. 
</P>
<P>
At a special meeting of OCTC on Friday, the agency tentatively agreed to 
proceed with several key projects that will cost more than $82 million. 
Authorities expect to borrow against the anticipated taxes so the time schedule 
for high-priority projects can be moved up. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans, meanwhile, is already gearing up for the increased workload by adding 
people to the Orange County district staff. 
</P>
<P>
Among the first construction projects financed by Measure M will be the 
$40-million Orange Freeway car-pool lanes. Work is expected to begin in 
February, if all goes well. 
</P>
<P>
Officials hope within 18 months also to begin work on the infamous El Toro "Y," 
the jammed confluence of the Santa Ana and San Diego freeways. Measure M will 
provide $55 million for that job, which will add lanes to the Y. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, authorities envision ordering the first phalanx of commute trains 
that are expected to improve rail service between Orange County and Los 
Angeles, ultimately running one train every 20 minutes during peak hours. The 
trains and locomotives take about 18 months to build, so officials do not 
anticipate the new service to begin rolling until late 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Other projects will take a bit longer to hit the ground. A car-pool lane in 
each direction along Interstate 5 from San Clemente to the El Toro Y will be 
built with $80 million in Measure M money, with work probably beginning later 
this decade. 
</P>
<P>
Car-pool lanes will also be added to the Riverside Freeway, likewise later in 
the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
While such high-profile freeway projects will surely command the public 
spotlight, Measure M will also bolster work on scores of streets throughout the 
county. Among the most ambitious projects are the 21 "super-streets" that will 
be crafted with $120 million from the proposition. Under the program, the 
designated streets will get face lifts that include synchronized signals, turn 
pockets and other improvements to speed traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Beach Boulevard will be the first, with work expected to start in February. 
Katella Avenue, Moulton Parkway and others will follow by mid-decade, getting 
face lifts that will include better signal synchronization, more turn pockets 
and other improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Many people can hardly wait. Donna Stubbs, the chief public relations officer 
for the county's tollways agencies, struggles each day in the traffic up 
Moulton Parkway from her South County home to work in Costa Mesa. She wishes 
Moulton Parkway could be improved tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
"In the short stretch between El Toro Road and Lake Forest Drive I'll spend 10 
to 20 minutes in traffic every day," Stubbs said. "Going home is just as bad. 
Moulton is getting worse every day. But I think it'll make a big difference as 
a super street." 
</P>
<P>
Another $50 million of the Measure M money will help coordinate traffic signals 
around the county, and $70 million will go to improve some of the most 
traffic-clogged county intersections. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest chunk of street money, $450 million, will go to local cities for 
road maintenance and improvements. Cities have already drawn up a list of more 
than 300 candidate street projects. The Measure M money will go not only to 
repair potholes but also to widen some streets, provide more turn lanes on 
others and generally ensure that the road network is running up to speed. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, I think this will result in people saving a lot of time on the road, 
particularly during the peak driving hours," said William Morris, public 
services director in Costa Mesa. "We'll be proactive and cure problems before 
they occur, instead of being reactive, only making improvements as traffic 
congestion builds up." 
</P>
<P>
Morris envisions money improving intersections such as Sunflower Avenue at 
Fairview Road and the traffic-choked confluence of MacArthur and Harbor 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim officials have been eyeballing improvements to 28 congested 
intersections. Without Measure M, there was money to improve just six of them 
in the next five years, said John Lower, the city's principal traffic engineer. 
</P>
<P>
With Measure M, the city expects to tackle 16 of the choke points by 
mid-decade, including the intersections of Tustin and La Palma avenues and 
Katella Avenue and Haster Street. 
</P>
<P>
In San Juan Capistrano, the top-priority projects are building an extension of 
Stonehill Drive over a creek bed to provide an alternative to heavily congested 
Del Obispo Street, and the widening of the La Novia Avenue bridge, La Novia 
itself, and Rancho Viejo and Junipero Serra roads. 
</P>
<P>
But even with Measure M, there's still not enough money to tackle all of the 
region's transportation difficulties, experts caution. The flood of money 
during the next 20 years will simply help make a bad situation a bit better, 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would have been a disaster had it not been approved," said John R. 
M. Wilson, a history professor at Southern California College in Costa Mesa who 
rides his bicycle to work to avoid traffic congestion. "It had to be done if 
this place wasn't going to freeze up completely." 
</P>
<P>
Staff writer Jeffrey A. Perlman contributed to this story. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FROM POTHOLES TO OVERPASSES: Where Measure M money goes 
</P>
<P>
In the months to come, residents throughout Orange County will begin to see the 
fruits of Measure M, the half-cent sales tax earmarked for transportation 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
Approved by voters Tuesday, the tax will raise $3 billion during the next two 
decades for transportation projects ranging from fixing potholes to building 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Spending plans include: freeway improvements, mass-transit projects, "super 
streets" and other local road improvements. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the plan, 21 major thoroughfares would be designated super streets, 
with better signal timing, turn pockets with two left-turn lanes, more lanes 
and other improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of local roads will be fixed as a result of Measure M, but city 
councils will decide which roads. Senior citizens and handicapped passengers 
will also pay lower bus fares throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a look at five regions of the county and some of the Measure M 
transportation plans. 
</P>
<P>
1. NORTH 
</P>
<P>
Freeways: Santa Ana Freeway widened to 12 lanes to the county line, with 
completion expected in 2000. Car-pool lanes to be built on the

year and work beginning on the former later this decade. 
</P>
<P>
Major streets: Beach Boulevard, Imperial Highway, Harbor Boulevard, Tustin 
Avenue/Rose Drive, Katella Avenue, Orangethorpe Avenue and State College 
Boulevard to be transformed into super streets with various improvements. 
Katella Avenue work expected first, with others to follow.

</P>
<P>
Freeways: This area is prime beneficiary of freeway money. Will help speed 
completion of Santa Ana Freeway widening throughout Central County. Will add 
three lanes in each direction. Work will now be completed in 10 years instead 
of 20. Intersection of Santa Ana, Orange and Garden Grove freeways to be 
rebuilt in mid-decade. Costa Mesa Freeway to get a new lane in each direction 
toward end of decade. 
</P>
<P>
Major streets: Harbor Boulevard, Beach Boulevard, Katella Avenue and Warner 
Avenue to become super streets. 
</P>
<P>
Roads: El Camino Real in Tustin expected to be widened. Bristol and 17th 
streets and McFadden Avenue in Santa Ana to be widened. New pavement to be laid 
on various streets in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Transit: Several mass-transit systems will connect here. A monorail or other 
"guideway" system would link Santa Ana and Orange with adjacent cities. A new 
light-rail line running along old Red Car trolley line to LAX would end in 
Santa Ana. More Amtrak-operated commute trains will run through this area to 
Los Angeles by 1993. New train station expected to be built in Tustin; 
abandoned station in Orange to be refurbished. New commute-rail link to 
Riverside possibly later in decade. 
</P>
<P>
4. COSTA MESA/NEWPORT/IRVINE 
</P>
<P>
Freeways: Will benefit from reconstruction of the El Toro Y, which acts as a 
logjam for motorists trying to travel on the San Diego Freeway. Elevated 
car-pool lanes planned to sweep over and avoid interchange traffic at junction 
of the San Diego and Costa Mesa freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Major streets: Harbor Boulevard, Jamboree Road, Laguna Canyon Road, Newport 
Boulevard, MacArthur Boulevard, Coast Highway, Adams Avenue and Irvine 
Boulevard to become super streets during next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Roads: Newport Boulevard targeted for widening, as are Irvine Center Drive, 
Jeffrey Road and Culver Drive in Irvine and Victoria and 19th streets in Costa 
Mesa. Money also probably to be spent for signal synchronization. 
</P>
<P>
Transit: Costa Mesa and Irvine may be linked with Central County monorail line. 
Irvine also a destination point for Riverside commute-rail line. More 
Amtrak-operated commute trains to run through this area to Los Angeles by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
5. SADDLEBACK/SOUTH BEACH 
</P>
<P>
Freeways: El Toro Y interchange to be widened and new ramps built. Construction 
starting within 18 months. One new car-pool lane in each direction on 
Interstate 5 from the Y to San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Major streets: Irvine Center Drive/Moulton Parkway/Street of the Golden Lantern 
to become a super street, along with Laguna Canyon Road, El Toro Road, Crown 
Valley Parkway and Coast Highway. Moulton probably completed by mid-decade, 
others by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Roads: Traffic signals on Marguerite Parkway and La Paz Road expected to be 
better synchronized. San Clemente to target widening of El Camino Real. San 
Juan Capistrano expected to widen Rancho Viejo Road. 
</P>
<P>
Transit: More Amtrak-operated commute trains to Los Angeles, with new stations 
likely in Mission Viejo and Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commuter Rail Lines 
</P>
<P>
A. This abandoned railway right of way to be purchased as early as February for 
new public commuter-rail sevice between Orange County and Los Angeles' Blue 
Line. 
</P>
<P>
B. New locomotives and rail cars for more daily commuter trains to Los Angeles 
may be purchased in about 18 months. Aquisitions hinge on pending public 
purchase of Santa Fe rail line.

<P>
Fear of war in the Persian Gulf jolted oil prices for the third straight month 
in October, but slowing economic growth held wholesale price inflation for 
non-food and non-energy items to zero. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said Friday that its producer price index for finished 
goods, one step short of retail, jumped seasonally adjusted 1.1% last month. 
</P>
<P>
That followed increases of 1.6% in September and 1.3% in August, bringing the 
annual inflation rate for the year so far to levels not seen in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
Wholesale prices inflation, on an annual basis was 7% for the first 10 months 
of 1990, the highest since a 7.1% rise in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the October number was higher than the predicted 0.7% rise, stock 
and bond markets rallied immediately after the report because prices outside 
the volatile food and energy sectors were unchanged. This so-called "core" 
inflation rate is considered a better indicator of long-term inflationary 
trends. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have here is an energy problem, which is driving prices higher. Behind 
that, the economy is very weak and is not creating significant inflationary 
pressures." said Ron Schreibman, economist at the National Assn. of Wholesale 
Distributors. 
</P>
<P>
Traders took the absence of core inflation as a sign the Federal Reserve Board 
likely would stimulate the economy with lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
"What is the Federal Reserve waiting for?" said Gary Ciminero, economist at 
Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc., who said he has expected substantial Fed 
easing for the last six months. 
</P>
<P>
The central bank, fearful of triggering a fresh round of inflation, has nudged 
down rates only half a percentage point this year in two increments. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a severely weakened economy-including falling employment, declining 
consumer confidence and a sagging retail sector-the Fed's chief policy-making 
committee may decide at its meeting Tuesday to allow interest rates to fall to 
stimulate growth, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Economists are optimistic that despite the sharp rises of the last three 
months, inflation will remain under control unless war in the Middle East 
destroys Saudi Arabia's oil production facilities. The economy is simply too 
weak for most goods producers to pass on higher energy costs, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a significant change from September's 0.6% rise and may mean that when 
energy prices abate, inflation could settle down to a much lower rate," said 
William McReynolds of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The latest edition of a prominent survey of private economists said the nation 
likely will topple into a recession before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Blue Chip Economic Indicators of Sedona, Ariz., reported Friday that 44 of the 
55 economists in its survey believe a downturn will start before the end of 
this year. Another three said the slump would start in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
To symbolize the shift, the survey newsletter changed its nameplate from yellow 
to red for the first time since the 1981-82 recession. 
</P>
<P>
"The climate is not going to be favorable for an increase in inflation," said 
economist Robert G. Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. "We're in a bad 
inflation patch now, but we'll get through it." 
</P>
<P>
In October, energy costs led prices higher, rising 8% compared to 13.8% in 
September and 9.5% the month before that. 
</P>
<P>
Fuel oil prices rose 15% and were 67.5% higher than a year earlier. Natural gas 
costs, however, edged down 0.3%. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices increased 8% and were 50.2% higher than a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Food prices rose 0.9%, the biggest increase since unseasonably cold weather 
froze southern fruit and vegetable crops in January. 
</P>
<P>
Egg costs were up 9.5%; pork, 8.2%, and beef and turkeys, 5.1%. Prices also 
rose for vegetables and pasta. 
</P>
<P>
Economist Donald Ratajczak said consumer' demand for red meat has fallen about 
as much as is likely and farmers are building their herds in anticipation of 
growing demand. That means that they are sending fewer animals to slaughter, 
pushing prices higher. 
</P>
<P>
The increases were partly offset by declines in the prices of fresh fruit, 
rice, chickens, fish, dairy products, coffee and cooking oils. 
</P>
<P>
In other categories, the price of passenger cars fell 2.7% after jumping 3.4% a 
month earlier. Economists attributed the fluctuations to the fact that price 
increases and discounts this year have been out of sync with auto dealers' 
usual seasonal pattern. 
</P>
<P>
Other declines were recorded for men's and boys' clothing, floor coverings and 
household flatware. Prices rose 3.4% for newspapers and were also up for books, 
women's clothing, cosmetics, tobacco and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
The various changes left the producer price index for all finished goods at 
122.3 in October. That means a hypothetical selection of goods costing $100 in 
1982 would have cost $122.30 last month, up from $114.70 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Prices at earlier stages of the production process were also up sharply, driven 
by energy. Prices rose 1.5% for intermediate-level goods and 8.7% for 
crude-level goods. Excluding energy and food, however, prices rose only 0.4% at 
the intermediate level and fell 1.7% at the crude level. 
</P>
<P>
Crude petroleum prices jumped 29.2% in October.

<P>
HIDDEN COSTS OF ARM CONVERSION; 
</P>
<P>
REFINANCING: MANY HOMEOWNERS WHO WANT TO CHANGE TO A FIXED-RATE MORTGAGE FIND 
THAT IT WILL BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THEY HAD THOUGHT. 
</P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When a young commercial artist bought a townhouse with an adjustable-rate 
mortgage three years ago, she was delighted with her selection of an ARM that 
could be converted to a fixed-rate loan. But as her date for possible 
conversion approaches, she is beginning to wonder whether it is such a great 
deal after all. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of nerve-racking detail in this conversion process. All this 
makes me feel the bank knows a lot more than I do and that they're counting on 
that," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Like many Americans who took out convertible ARMs a few years ago with the 
expectation of an easy conversion to a market-level fixed-rate loan, the artist 
is disappointed. Hours spent pouring over the fine print in her loan documents 
have convinced her that conversion will be neither easy nor necessarily 
economical. 
</P>
<P>
"Conversion is a nice option, but many times people are surprised at the 
interest rate they have to pay," says David Ginsburg, president of Loantech 
Inc., a nationwide mortgage advisory firm. "They realize they'll have to pay a 
premium for the luxury of getting out of their adjustable-rate mortgage, that 
there's no free lunch." 
</P>
<P>
Under typical mortgage contracts, the borrower must be willing to accept an 
interest rate three-quarters of a percentage point above the prevailing market 
rate to convert, according to Keith Gumbinger, president of HSH Associates, a 
financial publishing firm based in Butler, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
That could result in a monthly payment more than $50 over market for a $100,000 
loan or more than $100 for a $200,000 loan. 
</P>
<P>
"People think that when they convert they can get that nifty low rate 
advertised in the newspaper, but that's just not true," Gumbinger says. 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of convertible ARMs has been accountable to the fact that 
"Americans love to have their own way," Gumbinger says. But what many home 
buyers failed to realize when they opted for a convertible ARM is that having 
your cake and eating it, too, comes at a cost, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Many who took out convertible ARMs a few years ago mistakenly assumed they 
could simply convert to a fixed-rate loan bearing the same interest rate 
offered to the lender's other customers at time of conversion, Gumbinger says. 
</P>
<P>
What they didn't notice, he says, is that the lender tacks a premium onto the 
market rate when a conversion occurs. 
</P>
<P>
The premium is related to a figure known as the "margin." In a conversion 
situation, the margin is the amount over and above some prevailing mortgage 
interest rate, or "index," that the converting borrower must pay. Once the 
margin is added onto the index, many who convert wind up with higher monthly 
payments than they projected, mortgage experts say. 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, grasping the arcane details of the conversion process 
can be difficult. Relatively obscure indexes are commonly used as the basis for 
pricing conversions, with the two most common related to wholesale mortgage 
rates set by two giant quasi-federal agencies that buy mortgages from the 
lenders who make them. 
</P>
<P>
Information on the two Washington-area agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, is 
not easily found. 
</P>
<P>
Burrowing into the fine print of her loan documents, for instance, the artist 
learned that her new mortgage rate after conversion would be pegged to a Fannie 
Mae index. But the prose in her loan documents struck her as puzzling at best. 
</P>
<P>
"If you exercise your conversion option, the new fixed interest rate will be 
equal to the Fannie Mae required net yield for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages 
covered by applicable 60-day Mandatory Delivery Commitments in effect as of the 
date forty five (45) days before the conversion date, plus five-eighths of one 
percent (.625 percent) rounded to the next highest one-eighth of one percent 
(.125 percent)," reads the woman's loan document. 
</P>
<P>
Clerks at the savings bank that originated the artist's mortgage are of little 
help in explaining such language or in providing information on where the 
Fannie Mae index stands now or has stood in the past, she says. "They act like 
Joe's bank &amp; grill," she quips. 
</P>
<P>
Still, mortgage experts say lenders are obligated to provide such information 
to borrowers with conversion options. Government agencies such as Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac are a back-up source for data on index behavior. And private 
consulting services, such as Loantech will, for a fee, verify that a borrower's 
conversion has been correctly executed. 
</P>
<P>
Gumbinger, the HSH Associates mortgage expert, says those with convertible ARMs 
shouldn't necessarily assume that conversion is their best option, even though 
the up-front fee for a conversion usually runs only $100 to $500 -- a small 
amount compared to the cost of a full-blown mortgage refinancing. 
</P>
<P>
He counsels homeowners contemplating conversion to weigh several factors when 
deciding how to proceed. These include the interest rate they're currently 
paying on their ARM, where they think mortgage rates will go in the future, and 
how long they intend to remain in their home. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're only going to be there another year, it probably won't pay you to 
convert your ARM," Gumbinger says. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there are psychological as well as financial reasons to unload an 
ARM. Many a homeowner who took out an ARM a couple of years ago has been 
unnerved by upward adjustments on their mortgage rate and yearn for the 
certainty of a fixed-rate loan -- even if that certainty comes at a price, 
mortgage experts observe. 
</P>
<P>
Says the artist: "That's what I bargained for when I took out a convertible 
loan and that's what I really want."

CO-OPS TO CONDOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is in response to the Sept. 23 letter from Herbert H. Fisher regarding our 
article titled "Southland Hot Spot: Converting Co-Ops to Condos" (July 22). 
</P>
<P>
Fisher's letter contained the following incorrect statements regarding co-ops 
and their conversion to condominiums: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- "Property taxes could be affected by a conversion." 
</P>
<P>
In California property taxes are unaffected by a conversion from a co-op to a 
condominium. Reassessment will apply only to units sold. The conversion itself 
does not trigger a reassessment. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- "Community control over property is significantly altered." 
</P>
<P>
In California the laws, statutes and procedures governing the homeowners 
association control over comunity projects are the same for co-ops and 
condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- "The individual owner now assumes personal mortgage liability as a condo 
owner, which the shareholder did not have as a cooperative." 
</P>
<P>
In most co-ops in California the shareholders already have individual loans on 
their co-op units along with the associated personal mortgage liability. This 
liability is the same as that of an owner of a condo with a mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
In co-ops with one blanket loan for the entire project, each shareholder is 
personally responsible for payment of the entire loan amount throgh the 
association. If one co-op shareholder does not make his loan payment, then all 
the other owners must make up that amount, otherwise the lender can foreclose 
on the entire project. 
</P>
<P>
In a condominium, the owner is responsible only for his own loan. 
</P>
<P>
4 -- "They (co-op owners) have no desire to be part of a more expensive . . . 
form of mutual home ownership." 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear when Mr. Fisher uses the term "more expensive" if he is 
referring to the operating expense of the association or the value of the unit 
as a condo versus a co-op. The value of a co-op typically increases when it 
becomes a condo. The conversion almost never changes the operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher also states that financing is available for co-ops. This financing is 
very limited in California.

OPEN HOUSES DEFENDED AS VALUABLE SALES

<P>
Weekend poen houses allow potential buyers to "preview" properties at a relaxed 
pace while answering the questions, "Do we like this neighborhood and 
community?" "Can we afford to buy here?" "Will this suit our lifestyle?" Agents 
aren't simply marketing one selelr's home that afternoon, but an entire way of 
life. 
</P>
<P>
In this already difficult market, if sellers don't have trust in the real 
estate professional's marketing advice and fail to cooperate on open houses, 
caravans and short-notice showings, it is tantamount to cutting off one's nose 
to spite one's face!

OPEN HOUSES DEFENDED AS VALUABLE SALES

<TEXT>
<P>
I read "Open Houses May Be Waste of Time" (by Ellen L. James, oct. 28) with 
great dismay. 
</P>
<P>
More than 12 years ago I began selling real estate for Fred Sands Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
I was advised by many people that Sunday open houses weren't worthwhile. I 
heard, "Do everything you can to get out of doing open houses. Convince the 
sellers it's just a waste of time." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, I heeded their advice. I then had an exerpience for which I am very 
thankful. I listed a home in Beverly Hills. On a Sunday afternoon I saw the 
owner's brother at a local restaurant. He asked why I as not holding his 
siter's house open. I told him, "Open houses are a waste of time." He said he 
had recently purchased his home after seeing it at a Sunday open house. 
</P>
<P>
That evening his sister called me to request that I hold her home open on 
Sundays. I reluctantly agreed, and a few weeks latewr the house was sold 
thorugh a Sunday open house. After that, I held homes open every Sunday. That 
same year I sold my own home to a couple who saw it at a Sunday open house. 
</P>
<P>
I never insist that my sellers have open houses. If they prefer not to, it is 
their choce. I try to use every tool available to sell the properties I 
represent. Sunday open houses make the sale in at leat 10% of my listings. 
</P>
<P>
Open houses are only a waste of time if your home is overpriced. When your 
property is priced competitively, a Sunday open house can only increase your 
chances of selling.

CAP SCORES CAN'T TELL YOU HOW ONE STUDENT DID; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: EXPERTS SAY PARENTS OFTEN MISINTERPRET THE DATA TO CONCLUDE THAT 
THEIR CHILD IS DOING WELL. IT ISN'T NECESSARILY SO, THEY SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Like the well-worn cliche that says you can't tell a book by its cover, you 
also can't tell a student by his or her school's California Assessment Program 
scores. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, when newspapers around the state publish results of the various CAP 
tests, parents pore over the figures, seeking their child's school and 
comparing it to the school down the block. Naturally, parents feel proud if 
their child's school ranks among the top -- many parents, educators say, 
believe that if they send their kids to a high-scoring school, it automatically 
follows that they'll get a top-flight education. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not necessarily so. 
</P>
<P>
Educators around Orange County said that every year about this time, uncounted 
thousands of parents misinterpret the CAP scores -- in effect, they draw 
conclusions that aren't necessarily supported by the facts. 
</P>
<P>
Under the so-called "matrix sample" on which CAP scores are based, the 
educators point out, CAP results are designed merely to paint a broad picture 
of an overall district's performance, not the aptitude of individual students. 
Still, many parents persist in the belief that good scores mean their children 
are doing well. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like looking at a pie," said William Eller, assistant superintendent for 
instructional operations at the Capistrano Unified School District. "Under the 
matrix sample, each student brings an ingredient to the pie, (but) you just 
look at the pie and say, 'This looks good.' I can't look into the pie to find 
out if what the student put into it was good or bad." 
</P>
<P>
Another pitfall often found in interpreting CAP scores is the tendency to rate 
dissimilar districts by direct comparison. Students in affluent districts, for 
example, often have better books and other educational tools, and better access 
to libraries or other quiet places to study. Test scores tend to rise as a 
result of those abstract factors. 
</P>
<P>
The CAP test takes those socioeconomic factors into account by assigning each 
school a rating that reflects the educational and professional level of 
students' parents. Third- and sixth-grade tests determine socioeconomic status 
based on parents' professional level. A rating of 1 denotes parents classified 
as unskilled workers; a 2 rating indicates semiskilled workers, and a 3 is 
assigned to parents who are skilled workers. 
</P>
<P>
Parents of students in grades eight through 12 are rated on a five-point scale 
that denotes educational background. A 1 indicates parents who did not finish 
high school, and a 5 is assigned to parents with advanced degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Although the tests are standardized and take socioeconomic factors and language 
proficiency into account, there are other factors that are not necessarily 
included, such as classroom conditions or how the test is administered. Those 
factors can also influence test scores. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way you can standardize to the point where every district is 
administering the test exactly the same way under the same conditions," said 
Lois Blackmore, coordinator of data analysis for the Garden Grove Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, parents and district administrators would be better served by using CAP 
data to track performance within the district, rather than as a means of 
comparing one district to another, Blackmore said. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is probably most pertinent for individual districts to look at 
(CAP scores) from year to year, because only the people working there know the 
conditions (students) are working under," Blackmore said. "Each district knows 
the percentage of students who may be acquiring the English language. . . . 
Demographic factors (are) taken into consideration as data are aggregated and 
analyzed, but many times those considerations don't get published." 
</P>
<P>
State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig agreed that the way CAP results 
are published can render the results meaningless, and he said the press often 
fails to properly analyze the data. 
</P>
<P>
"How (the results) are reported is really crucial," Honig said. "If you just 
list the scores, a lot of times it doesn't show much. You may have a wealthy 
district (with high scores) that doesn't educate as well as other wealthy 
districts." 
</P>
<P>
Honig also argued that newspapers should also publish results of three or more 
years to show trends, rather than just yearly results, in which "there are 
always normal statistical fluctuations," he said.

YEAR OFF MIGHT DO CAP TEST SOME GOOD; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: DEUKMEJIAN BUDGET CUT COULD HELP IN THE LONG RUN IF THE EXAM'S FLAWS 
CAN BE CORRECTED, EDUCATORS DECIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Gov. George Deukmejian cut funding for the California Assessment Program 
tests this past summer, many educators decried it as an unfair blow to school 
districts that were trying to accurately assess students' progress. 
</P>
<P>
Now, many of those same educators are saying that the budget cut could be a 
blessing in disguise. 
</P>
<P>
For years, even supporters of CAP tests complained that some of the exams 
merely tested students' ability to memorize rather than their ability to 
logically work out problems. The exams were written in such a way that teachers 
could "teach to the test," or simply prime students on problems most likely to 
appear on the test, critics said. 
</P>
<P>
But with the 12th-grade CAP test that was scheduled to be administered in 
December already a victim of the budget cut and with funds frozen by Deukmejian 
unlikely to be released in time to reinstate tests for third-, sixth- and 
eighth-graders by next spring, educators are hopeful that state Department of 
Education officials will use the time they would have spent administering the 
tests to come up with a new and improved exam. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been anticipating a different kind of CAP test, one that's more in line 
with changes in curriculum," said Peter A. Hartman, superintendent of the 
Saddleback Valley Unified School District. "Hopefully, this will give the state 
a chance to improve the CAP test. . . . I would personally prefer a test that 
gave individual student data as opposed to district data." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, CAP scores rely on a "matrix sample" system in which students are 
tested on a small group of questions culled from a larger list of more than 
1,000 questions. The results are meant to provide a statistical analysis of how 
students do on all of the questions. 
</P>
<P>
But the problem, administrators said, is that the tests mask individual 
reponses, making it impossible to determine a student's strengths and 
weaknesses in particular subjects. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't do an item analysis on which students have scored on a particular 
item," said Norman Guith, superintendent of the Orange Unified School District. 
"It's not a very helpful planning tool for us. We'll be able to get along 
without it." 
</P>
<P>
Another problem with CAP tests, Guith said, is that "the state (curriculum) 
framework has changed, but the test hasn't." 
</P>
<P>
"We (districts) all changed according to the state framework, and we aligned 
ourselves with the model curriculum standards, and all of a sudden they come in 
with the old test and test for something we're not teaching," said Guith, a 
longtime CAP test critic. "It's not a current test, which makes it invalid." 
</P>
<P>
William Eller, assistant superintendent for instructional operations at the 
Capistrano Unified School District, said he and other educators are hoping to 
see CAP reading, math, social studies and science tests redeveloped to become 
more like the CAP writing test, which evolved from a multiple choice and 
fill-in-the-blank test to one in which students are required to write sentences 
and paragraphs. The improved CAP writing test, Eller said, better tests a 
student's ability to think rather than memorize. 
</P>
<P>
"Life experience doesn't have anything to do with basic (memorization) skills," 
Eller said. "Life skills have to do with the ability to integrate knowledge 
from a lot of different sources. The CAP writing assessment test provides an 
opportunity to take on a problem and write about it, and, subjectively and 
objectively, a neutral panel can determine if you went through the right 
process to come to a logical conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
While many educators agreed that a year's hiatus in CAP tests could be 
beneficial in the long term, they also expressed concern about the short-term 
effects of a year without them. 
</P>
<P>
James Cox, a consultant to the Orange County Department of Education, said that 
since CAP scores are ordinarily not reported to school districts until well 
into the school year after they were administered, a hiatus of one calendar 
year will mean a gap of two school years in compiling test results. That break 
would create severe statistical anomalies and hinder efforts to study trends at 
the district level, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, school districts that use CAP scores to determine whether 
curriculum changes are necessary could also suffer, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
"For those who look at CAP as an impetus for curriculum reform, it could really 
hurt," Cox said. "There are an awful lot of school districts out there whose 
innovative actions are made as a result of (CAP) test scores. . . The absence 
of CAP could prevent them from continuing to move ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Although some educators are attempting to assess the effect of a year without 
CAP, state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig contends that their analyses 
may be moot. 
</P>
<P>
If CAP tests are to be reinstated in time for the usual spring test date for 
third, sixth and eighth grades, the incoming Legislature would have to pass a 
bill to release the frozen $11 million and get it to the governor's desk almost 
immediately after the start of the new legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
Although most school districts are acting on the assumption that the 
Legislature won't act that fast, Honig said he is confident that the new 
gubernatorial administration will demand immediate action. 
</P>
<P>
"They would have to get something going in January," Honig said. "I think 
they're going to do it. I just can't envision them not having accountability 
for those grades."
