LAW SCHOOL DAVIDS TAKE ON GOLIATHS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: STUDENTS AT THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAW CLINIC OF THE USD LAW SCHOOL ARE 
OFTEN OUTNUMBERED UNDERDOGS WHEN THEY TAKE ON WELL-HEELED LEGAL OPPONENTS.

Even amid the framed diplomas, the Bill of Rights and the basketball hoop that 
hang on Richard (Corky) Wharton's office walls, the tattered orange-crate label 
stands out. 
</P>
<P>
There's something ominously luminescent about the green hillside it shows near 
the Pacific Ocean, where the trees bear fat fruit that's just a little too 
orange. "San Onofre Radioactivity," says the mock label, "Full o' Juice." 
</P>
<P>
The spoof, which hangs prominently above Wharton's cluttered desk at the 
University of San Diego School of Law, is a souvenir from the early 1980s when 
Wharton, one of San Diego County's leading environmental lawyers, represented 
the Friends of the Earth and other foes of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating 
Station. Their challenge of the plant's license application on the grounds that 
the plant is dangerously close to earthquake faults made headlines for months. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Wharton has a lower profile but an abiding crusade: USD's 
Environmental Law Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
Hailed by lawyers as the county's only public-interest environmental legal 
watchdog, the clinic teaches from five to eight law students each semester by 
sending them into the field -- not to mention the stream, the bay or any other 
place that the students find needs defending. The 11-year-old institution 
charges no legal fees but, under Wharton's leadership, it has taken on some 
powerful opponents, from Southern California Edison to the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers. And lately, it's challenging San Onofre again. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, law students Michael Brennan and Michael Haberkorn will appear 
before the state Regional Water Quality Control Board to present allegations 
that San Onofre is violating its national pollutant-discharge permit. Among 
other things, they allege that the plant's cooling system has reduced by 60% 
the area covered by the San Onofre kelp bed -- about 200 acres. 
</P>
<P>
In another case, three more students are helping represent the Sierra Club, 
which is an intervenor in a pending lawsuit that could help decide when San 
Diego will upgrade its Point Loma sewage treatment plant. The federal 
Environmental Protection Agency filed the suit against San Diego last year 
after the city failed to comply with the federal Clean Water Act by the 1987 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
The projects reflect the convictions of Wharton, whose energy fuels the clinic, 
even when money is tight. A fan of paisley and home-brewed beer, he likes to 
talk about what he believes is a growing activism among his students -- even as 
he admits that his own college education in the 1960s was dominated by " 
'Animal House'-type goings on." In the buttoned-down legal world, many agree 
that Wharton stands out. 
</P>
<P>
"When a lot of people think of lawyers, they think of someone in a suit and 
power tie," said Thomas A. Penfield, an attorney who once worked at USD. 
"Corky's more likely to show up in corduroys, a flannel shirt and soft shoes, 
and driving an Isuzu 4-wheel drive." 
</P>
<P>
Wharton, who does wear a suit to court, traces his environmentalism to one of 
his first jobs, working for a New York paper company he describes as "a 
polluting nightmare." (The origins of his nickname, meanwhile, can be found on 
the comic page: as a child, Wharton resembled mechanic Corky Wallet of Gasoline 
Alley). 
</P>
<P>
Now 46, he says his tenacity and determination were tested at an early age. 
When he was 24, the U.S. Army suddenly put him in charge of 140 troops and $1 
million of equipment in Vietnam, right after his dictatorial predecessor had 
been "fragged" (killed by a grenade) by his own men. 
</P>
<P>
"Needless to say, I was quite good to my troops," he said, laughing. "But after 
that, everything else was easy. If things get really tough, I just say, 'At 
least they're not shooting at me.' " 
</P>
<P>
The son of a Philadelphia shipfitter and a school crossing guard, Wharton likes 
to say he came West for good after "it snowed on Easter Sunday and I took it 
personally." He graduated from USD law school and set out to emulate his hero, 
Ralph Nader, who Wharton admires for "pressing issues and defending rights that 
otherwise are not represented." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Wharton looks for cases that have regionwide significance that would 
not otherwise be taken by a private attorney -- usually because there's no 
money to be won. They're not hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
When the Corps of Engineers wanted to build a breakwater off Imperial Beach in 
1986, for example, the clinic sued on behalf of the Surfrider Foundation to 
halt the project, because it was feared the breakwater would cause beach 
erosion. Two barges, one loaded with boulders and one bearing a crane, were in 
position, ready to begin building the $6.9-million wall of rock, when Wharton 
and his students won a court order halting the construction. The breakwater was 
never built. 
</P>
<P>
"We won that case in three weeks, working round the clock," Wharton said, 
estimating that if a private firm had been hired to do the job, their fees 
would have exceeded $40,000. "But nobody won any money. If we hadn't done that 
case, it wouldn't have gotten done." 
</P>
<P>
Other lawyers agree that Wharton's clinic meets a crucial need. Compared to 
other California cities of comparable size, San Diego has "an obvious paucity 
of environmental lawyers," said John Reaves, one of San Diego's relatively few 
environmental attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people who call me with a public-interest gripe, but who don't have 
any money, I send them to the clinic." 
</P>
<P>
Wharton's students clearly prosper by getting their feet wet. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of subtleties to law that you don't learn in law school" 
classes, said Haberkorn, one of Wharton's current students who plans to 
specialize in environmental law. He describes the clinic as "a tremendous 
opportunity to learn proper conduct and proper strategy. I just wish it was the 
only thing that I do." 
</P>
<P>
For Haberkorn, Wharton is an inspiration. "You need somebody who's really 
impassioned about what they're doing, and Corky is," he said. "He's a true 
environmentalist." 
</P>
<P>
Judging by where other students have ended up, they seem to have been inspired 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
Two former students are with the federal Environmental Protection Agency, one 
is on the Council of Environmental Quality, one works with a legislator in 
Sacramento and others work in private practice in San Diego. And Wharton loves 
to help them learn to do it right. 
</P>
<P>
"In detail. I want it in detail," he excitedly told Haberkorn and Brennan as 
they drafted a list alleging the San Onofre power plant's violations of its 
federal discharge permit. "Page numbers, line numbers. Everything should go in 
this baby. Give them everything we've got." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Wharton said he believes practical education should always go hand in 
hand with theoretical study. 
</P>
<P>
"We put them in the middle of the case. They meet deadlines, face the stresses 
of dealing with real people, argue in front of real judges, with real 
verdicts," he said. "Live ammunition, not blanks." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps one of the most important things the clinic teaches, however, is how it 
feels to be outnumbered and outspent. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, when Wharton took on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission over the San 
Onofre power plant, he faced 11 attorneys and 24 paid experts. Wharton's troops 
consisted of two law students and six volunteers. They lost. 
</P>
<P>
"We're always up against huge money, and we don't have any. It's almost like 
we're going out of business every other year," Wharton said. "But you still 
win, every once in a while. And you're always there to keep them honest. That's 
the important thing." 
</P>

DROPOUTS GET JUMP START ON NEW LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the midst of the national debate over how to revamp American educational 
performance and stem the large number of dropouts, students like Jim Thompson, 
Matt Zuniga, Bernadette Carter and Jason Koehler have a few small successes 
they'd like to share. 
</P>
<P>
They, along with eight of their peers, have come back from the scholastic dead, 
moving from the dropout column to near-completion of a high school equivalency 
diploma under an unusual pilot program at Mira Mesa High School in cooperation 
with the San Diego Community College District. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, the effort brings to the high-school campus an existing community 
college program to give older dropouts a second chance, as a way to recapture 
disaffected students at an earlier age and give them a psychological jump start 
through counseling in self-esteem and self-discipline. 
</P>
<P>
The key is completion of the General Educational Development (GED) test, a 
series of exams long used for adults without diplomas to show they possess 
skills and concepts considered necessary for high school graduates. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the effort we're trying with dropouts, I think this can be a real 
benefit for a lot of students," said Ricki Martinez, adult education 
coordinator for San Diego city schools, who helped design the program to Mira 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The dozen students in the pilot had long given up on attending classes 
regularly at Mira Mesa, all for their own reasons -- some academic, some 
family, some personal. 
</P>
<P>
"I had all F/Us in the 11th grade," Thompson said. "Personally, I was bored," a 
fact exemplified by the 31 formal referrals slips that teachers gave him to the 
principal's office for violating normal codes of conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their antipathy toward school, the students -- together with about 100 
others who had stopped attending or were about to drop out -- were corralled by 
counselors to enroll in the school district's night high school diploma 
program. That alternative program at 10 campuses offers students a chance to 
make up credits by taking two or three courses at a time, in an environment 
that bends some of the rules, such as drinking or eating in class, that made 
regular school so onerous for some. 
</P>
<P>
But Mira Mesa Principal Jim Vlassis discovered that the night diploma program 
by itself was proving no panacea. Most students were so deficient in credits 
needed for a regular high school diploma -- most having half or less of the 44 
required -- that completion could take years. 
</P>
<P>
With the majority of them near or already 18 years old, chances of success were 
slim and none, even though many had academic potential, because after turning 
20, students must leave the night program and continue their quest for a 
diploma at the community college level. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics compiled by Martinez showed that few, if any of the students 
referred directly to the community college GED program were completing it. In 
large part, the no-nonsense, impersonal world of adult continuing education 
proved too daunting to these students lacking in self-discipline and 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"So a number of us kicked around the idea of perhaps improving the (outlook) 
for these students" who had the potential to complete the GED for an 
equivalency degree, Martinez said. "For this certain group, we thought about 
creating a bridge" by having the students study for the GED in a high-school 
setting. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the students receive a high school equivalency diploma 
through the accredited community college foundation if they pass the GED and 
complete three social studies courses in economics, U.S. government and U.S. 
history -- two of them in the night program and the third at a community 
college. 
</P>
<P>
For the pilot, Mira Mesa High counselor Gaylord Albright set about identifying 
a dozen or so students who, although slogging along in the night program, 
appeared to have the ability to tackle a community-college GED course. He 
recruited his son Aaron, a basic skills instructor at Madison High, to adapt 
the course to the different environment. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I wanted to prove something," said student Thompson, who readily 
agreed to Gaylord Albright's proposition when approached earlier this year. He 
had tired of sleeping late every day, arising largely to eat a meal and then go 
to work waxing floors for a building maintenance company. 
</P>
<P>
"This can be a gold mine" in recapturing dropouts, Albright said. "A lot of 
dropouts are not 'dumb' as people sometimes think" but rather dislike school 
for reasons of immaturity, or family problems, among many others, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The prep course runs 2 1/2 hours a day, 4 days a week, for 6 weeks, covering 
all areas that the GED will test: writing skills, a writing essay, social 
studies, science, literature and the arts, and mathematics. Students then take 
the five-part GED, with passing grades based on the level at which two-thirds 
of all regular high school graduates in the United States would score. 
</P>
<P>
"In the class, they help you one-on-one, that's different," said Carter, who 
admitted that the attractions of San Diego beaches had proven stronger than 
those of the classroom during most of her high-school career. 
</P>
<P>
Added Thompson: "In a regular class, if you ask a teacher something, you get 
maybe a minute or two, what with 40 kids in there and a couple of loudmouths 
always (trying to disrupt) things." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Barnes, a 17-year veteran of adult education with the community 
colleges, guided Aaron Albright in organizing the course. 
</P>
<P>
"You need constant motivation and (for these kids) more of a classroom 
structure rather than (an alternative) method of giving them independent 
study," she said. "You want the students to see some immediate gratification." 
</P>
<P>
All the educators involved with the program stress that the GED is not an easy 
test. 
</P>
<P>
"It definitely presupposes that you can read" at or near the 10th-grade level, 
Barnes said. Much of the review centers on improving writing and math skills. 
</P>
<P>
Gaylord Albright said that some students who were pre-tested for the pilot 
course needed additional course work beyond the rapid-paced review of the 
GED-prep class. They have been encouraged to continue in night school at Mira 
Mesa but, under another experiment, will be provided special tutors from the 
nearby Miramar Naval Air Station under a cooperative community participation 
plan with the military. 
</P>
<P>
The GED is written by committees of secondary teachers selected from specialty 
subject associations, such as the National Council of English Teachers and the 
American Academy of Science, who decide what is appropriate material that a 
high-school graduate should know, Douglas Whitney, Washington-based director of 
the American Council on Education-GED Testing Service, said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a minimum competence test; the minimum score in California is such 
that 34% of seniors graduating with diplomas would fail it," Whitney said. "A 
person with a GED diploma has outperformed a third of the high school 
graduating seniors in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Whitney added, "We administer it each year to seniors who are graduating and we 
set (passing) standards based on their performance. The test was changed 
substantially in 1988 and a writing essay requirement added in response to the 
national educational reform. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't promote it as a substitute for a high-school diploma -- we require 
people to be at or near (age) 18 before they can take it -- but rather it is 
for adults who did not complete high school on their first go-around," Whitney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"And we are careful to counsel that students need to read at least about the 
ninth-grade level to take a prep course . . . but on the other hand, a majority 
of kids who drop out do not do so because of bad grades so you can't always 
equate dropping out with lack of skill." 
</P>
<P>
Since the GED by itself cannot measure motivation, the community college 
district requires the three social studies courses the completion of which 
means a student has shown at least sufficient discipline to attend class 
regularly. 
</P>
<P>
"That says the students have the capacity to stick with something," said Heiko 
Fredericks, a community college counselor who will work with the expanded 
GED-prep program at Garfield and Hoover high schools as well as Mira Mesa to 
get students to think beyond the diploma itself. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these students are still very uncomfortable with the system," 
Fredericks said. "I have to work hard to penetrate their defenses, to get them 
to start thinking beyond diploma requirements into career thinking, some basic 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't profess to say that the (equivalency) diploma is as desirable as one 
(that comes) from graduating from a San Diego high school, but four years of 
high school is simply not realistic for everyone. . . . I don't think what we 
are doing is a disservice at all to students." 
</P>
<P>
Fredericks cited the case of Matt Zuniga, a self-admitted discipline problem 
who nevertheless has done well in the pilot and needs now only to complete his 
final government class, having passed the GED. 
</P>
<P>
"He is beginning to have one small success followed by another small success," 
Fredericks said. "I see a slight increase in stimulation and interest" beyond 
completion of equivalency requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Zuniga has expressed interest in photography or architecture, and Carter now 
hopes to study nursing.

TEMPLE WELCOMES HAND-SCRIBED NEW TORAH 'AS WE WOULD A BRIDE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rabbi Moshe Klein finally got the last word in. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-generation Jewish scribe from Brooklyn, N.Y., finished a handwritten 
copy of the 3,000-year-old Torah in a rare, two-hour ceremony witnessed Sunday 
by more than 200 members of the Temple Adat Elohim in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Using a feather quill, Klein wrote the last 120 letters in the temple's new 
copy of the Torah, a scroll that defines the laws and culture of Judaism. He 
spent a year copying the document in the traditional fashion, using indelible 
ink on animal-hide parchment wound around two wooden rollers. 
</P>
<P>
The Torah, which is written in Hebrew, is equivalent to the first five books of 
the Old Testament: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. It is a 
history from the Creation to the death of Moses. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the most sacred object we have," said Temple Adat Elohim Rabbi Alan 
Greenbaum. "We welcome the Torah as we would a bride, under a wedding tent with 
a procession." 
</P>
<P>
Greenbaum called the Torah "a wedding ring, the symbol of the relationship 
between God and the Jewish people." 
</P>
<P>
Elaine and Steve Gewirtz carried the Torah, leading a procession of family 
members into the synagogue during the ceremony. Music played and the couple 
walked beneath a traditional wedding tent, called a huppah. The Torah was 
placed on a table in the center of the temple where Klein went to work 
fashioning the last letters of the document. 
</P>
<P>
"I got all choked up, my wife cried," Steve Gewirtz said. 
</P>
<P>
The Gewirtz family paid for the commission of the temple's newest Torah: a 
special three-quarters-size edition lightweight enough for youngsters to tote 
it during bar mitzvah and bat mitzvah ceremonies. More than 100 other synagogue 
members paid to have one of the last 120 letters penned in their honor. 
</P>
<P>
Elaine Gewirtz said young people in the past were unable to carry the temple's 
other two standard-size Torahs when they were called to read during services. 
"We have a lot of families and a lot of children," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenbaum said the procession of singing children, who entered the temple just 
before the Torah, is symbolic of the importance they play in the Jewish faith. 
</P>
<P>
According to an ancient story, Greenbaum said, God tells the Jewish people, 
"I'll give you my Torah, but what will you give in return to guarantee its 
safekeeping? 
</P>
<P>
"First, the prophets are offered as guarantors, but God says no," Greenbaum 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, the sages are offered, but God still says no. Finally, they say, 'We'll 
give you our children,' and God says OK."

PUBLIC DEFENDER DOES IT HIS WAY; 
</P>
<P>
JUDICIARY: HOWARD WACO'S UNORTHODOX STYLE HAD HEADS SHAKING LONG BEFORE HE WAS 
HAULED OUT OF A VAN NUYS COURTROOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA KLEIN LERNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Howard C. Waco was controversial long before he was 
dragged from a courtroom and shoved into another by two Los Angeles police 
officers acting on a judge's orders. 
</P>
<P>
Last Monday's unusual incident set tongues wagging throughout the city's legal 
community. But Waco has long been notorious around the Van Nuys courthouse for 
a rather quirky professional style that frustrates many of the people with whom 
he works. 
</P>
<P>
Court clerks, judges, bailiffs and deputy district attorneys there are apt to 
roll their eyes and groan when Waco's name is mentioned. The consensus from 
dozens of interviews is that Waco is seldom where he should be, a charge Waco 
defends by holding up a calendar crammed with court dates. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't be in every judge's court at the same time," Waco said. 
</P>
<P>
But even his critics say Waco is a sharp, hard-working attorney who takes 
seriously his role as advocate for the accused. 
</P>
<P>
Waco has been the subject of even more controversy than usual since Van Nuys 
Superior Court Judge Raymond T. Mireles sent two police officers -- witnesses 
in a probation violation hearing -- to get Waco, who was representing the 
defendant. "Bring me a piece" or "body part" of Waco, witnesses quoted Mireles 
as quipping. Mireles later told an angry delegation from the public defender's 
office that he thought Waco was in the hallway outside his courtroom and did 
not intend for the officers to use force. 
</P>
<P>
Waco, who earlier had been told by a bailiff that he would not be needed in 
Mireles' courtroom for several hours, was dragged backward out of Van Nuys 
Superior Court Judge Alan B. Haber's court and shoved into Mireles' courtroom. 
He suffered a bruised leg and was indignant enough to retain a lawyer for a 
possible lawsuit against Mireles and the officers. A hearing convened by Haber 
to determine whether the officers were in contempt of his court is scheduled to 
resume Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Many courthouse wags consider the incident to be poetic justice, a view that 
makes Waco's colleagues indignant. Deputy Public Defender Linda Schwartz, who 
saw Waco being dragged out of Haber's courtroom, said he did nothing to deserve 
that treatment. It was, she said, an affront to the court system. 
</P>
<P>
"It shouldn't have happened -- it's terrible what happened, but it's not a 
surprise that it happened to him," said one court clerk. Many of those 
interviewed did not want to be named because they fear repercussions from 
bosses or strains in their working relationships with Waco. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a history of not showing up in court, being late and having an arrogant 
attitude about it," said a court clerk. 
</P>
<P>
"You hope you never have a case on calendar with his name on it," said another 
courtroom employee. "You never know when he's going to show up -- or if at all 
he'll show up. If he leaves the courtroom, you can't count on him coming back 
when you want him." 
</P>
<P>
"He's probably got a heart as big as all outdoors, but he's a big pain to work 
around," said Richard Condiff, the bailiff in Haber's courtroom. "He always 
wants everybody to stop what they're doing and take his case immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Condiff said he even thinks Waco ducked into Haber's courtroom specifically to 
seek sanctuary from Mireles, a charge Waco denies emphatically. Waco added that 
he had no need to hide from Mireles since he had been told he was not needed in 
the courtroom for several hours. Born in the Bronx 50 years ago, to a father 
who sold and repaired clocks and a mother who was a pioneering female 
stockbroker, Waco attended USC School of Law before joining the public 
defender's office 24 years ago. He has spent about 12 years of his career in 
Van Nuys, where he earns about $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
A slender man who describes himself as shy, Waco said he is bemused by all the 
furor surrounding him but doesn't care what his critics say; what matters are 
his clients. 
</P>
<P>
"I challenge the system to the nth degree for the rights of my clients," said 
Waco, whose son is a rookie Los Angeles police officer. "I get a real high out 
of making sure that people's rights are protected, at least when they're in my 
care. I represent the downtrodden. These people appreciate someone who will 
stick up for them for the first time in their lives, who will fight for them 
heart and soul." 
</P>
<P>
Waco's devotion is questioned by few. "He does work hard for his clients, I've 
got to say that," said one deputy district attorney who, in the next breath, 
accused Waco of taking "a perverse pleasure in being obstreperous." 
</P>
<P>
Waco's boss, Bill Weiss, head deputy in the Van Nuys public defender's office, 
said Waco's caseload is no greater than any other deputy's, but that Waco may 
create friction because he doesn't bother with social niceties. "He doesn't go 
into the courtroom to please the judge. He goes into the courtroom to represent 
his client." 
</P>
<P>
Waco is considered by his peers to be an expert at debunking the testimony of 
eyewitnesses, and his cross-examination of a police officer in a narcotics case 
was considered so exemplary that copies are circulated to all public defender 
trainees, said Deputy Public Defender Thom Tibor. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Presiding Judge Richard G. Kolostian said he is 
particularly impressed with Waco because he is "exceptionally well-prepared" at 
Superior Court arraignments. 
</P>
<P>
Most attorneys ask for numerous postponements to prepare for trial, said Head 
Van Nuys Deputy Dist. Atty. Dave Disco. Waco typically will already have read 
the preliminary hearing transcripts, interviewed his client and decided whether 
or not to plead guilty. 
</P>
<P>
A frequent Waco strategy is to exercise his client's right to a trial within 60 
days, forcing the prosecutor to put on a case without ample preparation or 
allow a favorable plea-bargain, Disco said. 
</P>
<P>
"Waco uses this as a very effective tactic to get bargaining leverage for a 
better settlement," Disco said. And when Waco opts for a trial, prosecutors 
fear he must have an excellent defense case, Disco added. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be pleased if every lawyer and district attorney was as well-prepared 
as Howard," said Kolostian. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's incident apparently was not the first time Waco has been strong-armed 
into a courtroom, some say. Los Angeles County Deputy Marshal Rod MacPherson 
said he saw a bailiff put an armlock on Waco and bring him into court on order 
of Superior Court Judge James Satt eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Waco and Satt -- who is now retired -- don't remember the incident, but Satt 
does recall the time he held court until 9:30 p.m. because nobody could find 
Waco earlier in the day when he was supposed to be in court. 
</P>
<P>
Waco showed up late in the afternoon and said he wasn't ready. Satt told Waco 
the court would be in recess until he got ready. "Everyone had to stay late and 
everyone was inconvenienced," Satt recalled. 
</P>
<P>
But Satt was also quick to praise the deputy public defender. Waco has always 
made motions seeking a separate court interpreter for his defendant in cases 
with more than one defendant who did not speak English. Satt always denied the 
motions. The California Supreme Court later ruled that defendants each are 
entitled to have their own translator and Satt now says: "He was years ahead of 
his time." 
</P>
<P>
"He's a hard worker and a smart, brilliant man, well versed in the law," the 
judge said. "Any time you have him as a lawyer you are well represented -- I 
think well above average."

PRIVATIZATION HELPS KEEP LEAKY SHIPS AFLOAT; 
</P>
<P>
L.A. COUNTY: A SIMPLE ECONOMIC BAND-AID IS BEING LABELED EITHER A TOOL TO 
IMPOVERISH MINORITY WORKERS OR AN OVERTAXED SOCIETY'S WHITE KNIGHT. NEITHER IS 
CORRECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Angeles Taxpayers Assn.

<TEXT>
<P>
Two opposing views are loudly trumpeted these days on the subject of government 
agencies contracting with businesses for the delivery of public services, 
popularly called "privatization." 
</P>
<P>
One camp sees it as some sort of free-market white knight riding to the rescue 
of an overtaxed and economically overextended society sorely in need of new 
ways to finance public services at affordable -- if not bargain-basement -- 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
The other side believes that privatization is a fiendish plot engendered by 
"right-wing obsession" -- and, as such it is merely a tool to thump on women 
and minorities and impoverish displaced government employees. 
</P>
<P>
Both views are wildly off the mark, especially where local government is 
concerned (contracting out is one of its long-time tools). 
</P>
<P>
There are a number of fundamental laws of politics and government. One of the 
most basic -- going back as far as the beginning of recorded history -- is that 
for reasons ideological or otherwise, politicians (as opposed to rulers) never 
voluntarily reduce services to their constituents, whether those constituents 
speak at the ballot box or with stones in hand. 
</P>
<P>
Another is that you get what you pay for (this often works well in economics, 
too). A third is that negotiable currency is needed to pay for what you buy. In 
the case of government, as in other facets of daily life, that means goods and 
services -- people and the things they produce. 
</P>
<P>
Trendy political, economic and social theories aside, nothing much has 
fundamentally changed for decades regarding which public services government in 
America should -- and will -- deliver, with the notable exceptions of health 
care and legal aid for the poor. From national to local levels defense, public 
safety, education, economic development and the like have comprised the 
accepted agenda. 
</P>
<P>
To be unaware these days that a buck just doesn't buy what it used to -- 
government services included -- you would have to be Rip van Winkle. Or that 
the sheer number of public service programs (as opposed to the service 
categories themselves) has grown enormously in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Which leaves local governments -- those closest to the people -- in a special 
quandary: How do they pay for what by law they must provide? 
</P>
<P>
Some, such as the city of Los Angeles, have turned temporary fees into 
permanent taxes (which mostly hurts those least able to pay). 
</P>
<P>
Others, such as Los Angeles County, can't rely on taxes. The county, the second 
biggest provider of municipal services in the United States after New York 
City, has virtually no taxing authority. And without special approval from 
Sacramento, it can't even ask the voters to OK changes in the local tax 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
The county has to try to keep a leaky financial ship afloat in large part by 
financing services through savings. Those savings can be made by improving 
efficiency or -- where appropriate and feasible -- by contracting with private 
companies for the delivery of public services at a lower cost than by in-house 
staff, and by the contractual expectation that the services will be delivered 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
Although Los Angeles County is reportedly having problems with its 
vehicle-maintenance contractor, local governments in the county have had 
especially good experiences with privatization of services common to both the 
public and private sectors, such as garbage collection, roadway repairs, tree 
trimming and clerical help. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, there are certain functions that do not immediately seem to lend 
themselves to privatization, such as law enforcement, industrial regulation, 
basic administration and the like, although in some of these areas, a degree of 
privatization has been the historic norm (a small city hiring a private 
attorney as city counsel, for example). 
</P>
<P>
Thus, privatization is not some right-wing scheme to subjugate women and 
minorities or to impoverish working people. Nor is it any kind of free-market 
panacea for overburdened government jurisdictions. It's just a necessary 
socioeconomic Band-Aid to help keep things together for all of us, minority and 
majority alike. As such, at least locally, privatization works when given the 
opportunity.

DAMAGED DESTROYER HEADS TO PORT UNDER OWN POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Kinkaid, a San Diego-based Navy destroyer that collided with a merchant 
ship off Malaysia on Sunday, is proceeding on its own power toward Singapore, 
its original destination, a Navy spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The collision between the Kinkaid and the Singapore merchant vessel, Kota 
Petani, left one American sailor dead and five shipmates injured, according to 
Cmdr. David L. Dillon, a spokesman for the Commander Naval Surface Force, U.S. 
Pacific Fleet in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Sean Michael McPhee, 24, of Santa Rosa, the destroyer's navigator, was 
killed in the collision. The five other Navy personnel involved in the accident 
were not seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported aboard the merchant vessel, Dillon added. 
</P>
<P>
It was the sixth accident involving a Navy ships and aircraft in the last two 
weeks. Seven sailors have been killed or lost at sea and 16 injured in the 
string of accidents. 
</P>
<P>
The Kinkaid and the accompanying frigate Rentz were deployed from San Diego on 
June 16 and were en route to Singapore for a routine port call, according to 
the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
Several fires broke out aboard the Kinkaid and the Kota Petani when they 
collided in the Strait of Malacca -- about 240 miles northwest of Singapore. 
The strait runs between the Malay Peninsula and the Indonesian island of 
Sumatra, connecting the South China Sea and the Andaman Sea. 
</P>
<P>
The fires aboard the destroyer were quickly contained and its crew, with help 
from sailors on the Rentz, helped douse the flames aboard the Kota Petani, 
Dillon said. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials said the Kinkaid was expected to reach Singapore about 12:30 
a.m. PST today where it was to be met by Navy accident investigation, explosive 
ordinance disposal and damage assessment teams that were dispatched from the 
Subic Bay naval base in the Philippines. They will evaluate the damaged ship. 
</P>
<P>
"Until she gets into port we really can't assess the damage," Petty Officer 
David W. Morri said in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Early reports indicated that the Kinkaid did incur damage -- the collision 
gouged a 15 by 56 feet hole above the waterline on the destroyer's starboard 
side. No major flooding was reported, Dillon said. The merchant vessel, which 
is also headed for Singapore, sustained major damage to its bow. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the collision is under investigation. But initial reports indicate 
that the merchant ship struck the destroyer, Dillon said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at the angles, it appears that the merchant ship hit the Kinkaid," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Kinkaid, under Cmdr. John M. Cochrane, is a Spruance-class destroyer 
commissioned in July, 1976. The ship is 563 feet long, 55 feet wide and 
displaces 8,350 tons. It is designed to provide anti-submarine warfare 
capabilities and it was deployed to the U.S. 7th Fleet. The destroyer carries 
20 officers and 297 enlisted personnel, Navy officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The other accidents involving Navy ships and aircraft in the past two weeks: 
</P>
<P>
* On Nov. 9, a Navy Reserve A-7E Corsair II attack jet crashed into an 
apartment complex in Smyrna. Ga., killing two people on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
* On Nov. 1, nine sailors suffered smoke inhalation and four of those were 
treated for burns following an early morning fire in a boiler aboard the tanker 
Monongahela, some 500 miles west of Gibraltar. 
</P>
<P>
* On Oct. 31, three sailors and a reported $4 million worth of non-nuclear 
missiles were swept by a wave from the aircraft carrier Eisenhower near Cape 
Hatteras, N.C. One sailor was missing and presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
* On Oct. 30, a sailor aboard the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson fell into the 
Pacific about 620 miles north of Wake Island and was presumed lost. 
</P>
<P>
* Also on Oct. 30, an F/A-18 pilot dropped a 500-pound bomb on the guided 
missile cruiser Reeves in the Indian Ocean, causing minor injuries to five 
sailors and blowing a five-foot hole in the ship's bow. 
</P>
<P>
* On Oct. 29, a training jet crashed aboard the aircraft carrier Lexington in 
the Gulf of Mexico, killing the pilot and four sailors on the ship.

<P>
As an opening-night ticket holder to the Red Army Chorus performance at the 
Shrine Auditorium, I would like to offer a comment. 
</P>
<P>
To our new Armenian neighbors, welcome to our democratic experiment. I am 
pleased that you are enjoying the freedoms of speech and peaceable assembly 
that our society provides. No doubt you have chosen to join with us because of 
a heightened appreciation of these special freedoms. But the blockage of the 
Shrine Auditorium on opening night did nothing to enhance these liberties 
(Metro, Nov. 4). 
</P>
<P>
In fact this act was a frontal attack on both these basic rights, more in the 
spirit of totalitarianism than of democracy. These freedoms, my friends, are 
for all of us, equally for you and for me. This is part of our special heritage 
as Americans.

Glasnost not to be excluded, however, I found it incredulous that the program

BRODER ON FEDERAL DEBT AND POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How surprising that, as Broder writes, the Washington media have finally 
discovered that our politicians are dismantling our government infrastructure. 
All in the name of the Reaganite slogan: "The government is the problem, not 
the solution." On the one hand, using governmental apparatus to freeze out 
services and dismantling programs, while with the other hand, rewarding the 
super-rich with steep tax cuts, and opening the door to greedy henchmen. 
</P>
<P>
But, Broder myopically puts the blame on all politicians, forgetting that the 
Democratic Party standard-bearers were defeated in three straight presidential 
elections for proposing taxes where needed. The Republicans mercilessly 
describing them as wanting to "tax, tax -- spend, spend." 
</P>
<P>
He should put the blame where it belongs: "Read my lips -- no new taxes!"

COURTS STAND TO LOSE A LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unless the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors abandons its eleventh-hour 
effort to amend an agreement negotiated and approved in good faith by the 
Superior and Municipal Court judges, the county stands to lose $130 million in 
state funds, along with the trust and mutual respect that ought to prevail 
between co-equal branches of government. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the Brown-Presley Trial Court Funding Act -- a measure 
passed to help local governments defray the expense of operating the state's 
court system -- Los Angeles County is eligible to receive the $130-million 
grant. In order to get the money, however, the county must have an agreement 
between the supervisors and the judges on how the funds are to be spent. That 
pact must be approved by Wednesday Until last week, the deadline seemed easily 
attainable. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the courts and county administrators struck a bargain that 
would have divided $61.2 million between the Superior and Municipal courts, 
while the other nearly $70 million would have gone to fund general county 
services and programs. Presiding Superior Court Judge Richard P. Byrne said 
that he is "satisfied with (the agreement)." Richard B. Dixon, the county's own 
chief administrative officer, called the level of court funding agreed upon 
"necessary," since the superivsors would have had to make most of the 
expenditures even without state help. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of judges in both court systems share those views, and last week 
they voted to approve the agreement. The supervisors, however, have refused to 
endorse the pact, insisting that it be amended to include three changes dear to 
the hearts of the board's three conservatives. They demand that, in order to 
get its money, the Superior Court limit attorney voir dire -- jury selection -- 
to 30 minutes or less in civil cases and "the greatest extent permisssable in 
criminal trials"; that the Alternate Defense Counsel (ADC) -- a private 
contractor who represents some indigents when the Public Defender is 
unavailable -- have its program extended into all Superior courts by July 1, 
and that the Superior Court expand its night court program. 
</P>
<P>
All three of these proposals are of contested worth. The question of whether 
Californians wish to surrender their right to trial before a jury in whose 
selection their attorney participated deserves the most serious consideration. 
Alternate Defense Counsel has yet to demonstrate its cost-effectiveness and 
many trial judges privately express reservations about the quality of legal 
representation that it provides. Night court is an interesting but not 
unproblematic reform whose implications require further study. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the merits of these proposals, they touch on issues far too serious to 
be resolved through what amounts to fiscal blackmail. The courts, acting as the 
guarantors of all Angelenos' rights, are correct to resist such rash conduct, 
even if it means losing the state aid. The supervisors have created this 
confrontation, and they can end it by endorsing the existing agreement before 
Wednesday's deadline.

CLEAN AIR: IT JUST MIGHT WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California's clean-air campaign, which spends a lot of time under siege, had 
two days last week that made it look as if it all might work. 
</P>
<P>
One of the good days was more a morale boost for the people in charge of 
pollution controls than the kind of day that actually makes smog go away. But 
the other was the announcement of an important early test of whether the state 
has the patience for a new approach to cleaning up pollution. For more than 20 
years, it has been able to make big gains by controlling major polluters -- 
power plants, refineries and the like. Now it must go after large numbers of 
smaller sources. It must trap pollution by the handful, not by the truckload. 
</P>
<P>
The first good day was Monday when guests of the State and Los Angeles Area 
Chambers of Commerce showed up to hear a discussion of what the invitation 
called "Draconian clean-up measures" being proposed to clear away Southern 
California smog. The Los Angeles Chamber says it agrees with the goals of clean 
air but is sharply critical of what the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District says will have to be done in the future to reach those goals. With its 
mention of possible economic decay and vanishing jobs, the invitation seemed to 
promise a program that would hang Southern California's bold new 20-year 
cleanup plan on the wall and take a bull whip to it. 
</P>
<P>
The guests, instead, got a group of panelists that amounted to a fan club for 
clean air. Before they spoke, Hitachi Ltd., one of the conference sponsors, 
released the results of a poll of Los Angeles residents, 58% of whom said they 
had seriously considered moving out to get away from the smog. Nearly half said 
that major industry is most responsible for paying for clean air. Nearly half 
also said they would be willing to car pool or take mass transit to help wipe 
away smog. 
</P>
<P>
The audience heard a state senator call for a ban on trucks at rush hour. A 
planner said that regional government capable of handling environmental, social 
and economic problems as parts of an inseparable package was essential but 
warned that nothing would work until people trusted government again. An oil 
executive said that his industry waited too long to take clean air seriously 
and had some catching up to do. And so it went. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome might mean nothing more than that the sponsors failed to invite the 
right speakers. We choose to believe it demonstrates that the effort to get 
clean air has as much support as efforts to get clean water and that the 
question is not whether but how the goal is reached. 
</P>
<P>
The other big day involved a move by the state Air Resources Board to require 
manufacturers to make deep cuts in the ingredients of smog that escape into the 
air every day from deodorant spray cans. Regulating something as seemingly 
harmless and personal as a spray can is something new for most Californians. It 
probably will take time for it to sink in that the total pollution from the 
cans that seem too small to matter is about the same amount that escapes into 
the air every day from an oil refinery. How people react in the end will have a 
lot to do with whether Southern California can change the fact that it has the 
dirtiest air in the nation, because it is just such cuts by the handful that 
will be the pattern of the future.

It turns out the best way to avoid heart-breaking, last-second losses is to go 
out and knock some heads, as the Rams proved Sunday in their 31-10 win over the 
New York Giants at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, we mean the Giants, not Jets. Phil Simms, Lawrence Taylor, Ottis Anderson, 
the whole gang that was 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, who barely registered a pulse after last week's loss at Minnesota, 
ended their four-game losing streak with resounding vengeance, playing as if 
they'd been locked in a room with the Death Wish videos. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't anything personal, Giants. You just happened to be in the way when 
the Rams decided to get mad as hell not take it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not losers," tackle Irv Pankey said. 
</P>
<P>
Just losers of four in a row. But the streak ended with a defensive performance 
that may get coordinator Fritz Shurmur's face removed from pool-hall dart 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
All Shurmur ever asked for was a chance to play a game with guys who didn't 
need their positions described to them minutes before kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, he was finally handed a full deck, as inside linebackers Larry Kelm and 
Fred Strickland met in the starting lineup for the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
How does six yards net rushing grab you? The defense, in fact, did nothing but 
grab. It grabbed quarterback Simms and sacked him four times. It grabbed 
tailback Anderson and wished him a happy 32nd birthday next week by presenting 
him seven bruises, one for each yard gained. 
</P>
<P>
All this because Kelm came back? 
</P>
<P>
"I can't claim that," Kelm said. "I didn't play all that great." 
</P>
<P>
But Kelm, who missed the first nine games with a foot injury, and Strickland, 
who was out the last three games with an ankle sprain, helped shut down the run 
and allowed the defense to do its thing. The Eagle reared its head once more, 
allowing Kevin Greene (two sacks) and Mike Piel (two sacks) to get acquainted 
with the opposing quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"We were on a crusade to prove we could play like we can play," Shurmur said. 
"Thank God they didn't lose faith, quit working and start to second-guess. We 
had a feeling we were going to get better. Hell, it's just one time, but it's a 
pretty good start." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams know all about bad bounces. Sunday, their fortunes turned. Mike 
Lansford set the tone by caroming his 44-yard, first-quarter field goal off the 
left upright and through the posts. Tailback Greg Bell fumbled on his second 
carry, deep in Ram territory, but was saved by a Giants' offside penalty. 
</P>
<P>
If the Rams were going to get burned on a Hail Mary pass, they wanted to make 
sure they had a 28-point cushion to lean on. 
</P>
<P>
And Jim Everett and the offense took care of that. Everett awoke from his 
four-game slumber with a record performance, completing 23 of 33 passes for 295 
yards. He completed 18 consecutive passes at one point, breaking his record of 
14 set earlier this season against Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams held just a 10-3 lead in the second quarter after Raul Allegre 
connected on a 22-yard field goal with 1:50 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
But the game turned in a matter of 14 seconds. With 45 seconds left in the 
half, Everett hit Aaron Cox on a 51-yard scoring pass, putting the Rams up, 
17-3. 
</P>
<P>
David Meggett fumbled the ensuing kickoff, with the Rams' George Bethune 
recovering at the 21. On first down, Everett threw a 21-yard scoring pass to 
Flipper Anderson, and that was that. 
</P>
<P>
Everett, who'd seen his efficiency rating fall nearly 20 points in the losing 
streak, was streaking toward league history in the third quarter when he 
completed his 18th consecutive pass, a six-yarder to Damone Johnson. Everett 
said a sideline attendant, whose name he could not recall, was keeping him 
posted on the streak each time he came off the field. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL record for completions is 22, held by Joe Montana. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I knew," Everett said. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the Rams' quarterback doesn't call his own plays, so he had 
little say on the deep, low-percentage pass attempt to Cox that ended the 
streak on his 19th throw. 
</P>
<P>
Everett isn't proud. He said he would have called a few safe screen passes to 
keep the streak going. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd have taken the dinks, sure," he said. "But the play was called to go over 
the top, and that's fine." 
</P>
<P>
Everett was just happy to get out of the game in one piece, coming off four 
weeks in which he's seen three of the best pass rushers in the league in Bruce 
Smith, Richard Dent and Keith Millard. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday was no exception with Lawrence Taylor, who had 12 sacks coming in, but 
the Giants' All-Pro was held to no sacks and two tackles, while twice being 
called for off-sides penalties. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't smell his breath, thank God," Everett said. "I hear it's bad at 
times." 
</P>
<P>
Everett would never know. Rams fullback Robert Delpino recalled Taylor being 
uncommonly quiet on the field. What was there to talk about, other than two 
penalties? 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Rams aren't geniuses, but they followed some sound strategy regarding 
Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran the other way," Rams Coach John Robinson said. "We didn't run to the 
left at all. And when we passed, we always had a tackle on him. Our respect for 
him is unlimited." 
</P>
<P>
That tackle would be Irv Pankey, who burned the midnight oil this week 
preparing for the game's best outside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my day today," Pankey said. "I've played well against him since he came 
into the league. You've got to put in a lot of film time with him." 
</P>
<P>
Pankey said he studied Taylor's rush techniques against other left tackles in 
the league, Gary Zimmerman of Minnesota and Phoenix's Luis Sharpe in 
particular. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor could only give Pankey's film performance a thumb's up. 
</P>
<P>
"They did a good job," Taylor said. "Better than I did and we did as a team. 
They deserved to win. We weren't really ready and my hat's off to them." 
</P>
<P>
Pankey also admitted the Rams may have been more desperate, considering the 
state of their psyches these days. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams couldn't afford another loss, the Giants could. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like live or die," Pankey explained. "That's what it was." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams were taking nothing for granted this time. They've had leads before, 
you know. They led at halftime, 24-3, but have seen larger leads disappear on 
them this season. They led the Green Bay Packers, 38-7, on Sept. 24 and barely 
held on to win, 41-38. 
</P>
<P>
This time, they kept the ball out of harm's way, sealing the Giants' fate with 
a 76-yard, 11-play drive to a touchdown, Bell scoring on a two-yard run to make 
it, 31-3, with 7:38 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Shurmur and the defense hoped to make a point by holding the Giants without a 
touchdown, which would have meant eight straight quarters without allowing the 
opponent a touchdown. But those hopes ended when Anderson scored on a one-yard 
run with 11:30 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Shurmur was vindicated, while others noted how much easier it is to 
coach defense with hands untied. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people realize what this defense is all about," said the 
oft-injured Strickland, a key part in the Eagle strategy. "We had a lot of 
plans to change the defense, but it (the injuries) really set us back. We were 
not playing what we wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
Shurmur, who has drawn heavy criticism in recent weeks about his defense, 
ranked 26th overall, welcomes all letters this week. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as they're interested, I don't care," Shurmur said of fan criticism. 
"I don't think they're doing the hiring and firing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Gaston Green (ribs) and Bill Hawkins (back spasms) were the Rams' inactive 
players Sunday. Giants' tight end Mark Bavaro did not play because of a knee 
injury. . . Jim Everett completed 14 straight passes to close out the first 
half, but not one to Henry Ellard, the NFL's leading receiver. Ellard caught 
No. 15 in the streak, a 30-yarder. It was his only reception of the game. . . 
Now that the streak is over: "It was a tough period we've been through," Coach 
John Robinson said, "the toughest I've ever been through in my life as a 
coach.". . . Giant quarterback Phil Simms had a pretty decent day in a losing 
cause, completing 25 of 38 passes for 237 yards.

DREW GETS POINTS ON THE POINT; 
</P>
<P>
LAKERS: IN 107-98 VICTORY OVER THE MAVERICKS, NEW GUARD SHOWS THAT L.A. NO 
LONGER IS AT A LOSS WHEN JOHNSON ISN'T ON THE COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sprawled between a trio of Laker Girls after making his first three-point 
basket as a Laker, Larry Drew quickly jumped to his feet and harassed Dallas 
Maverick guard Brad Davis into a turnover in the second quarter Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Another player might have lingered, if only for a moment, to savor the shot and 
inadvertent landing. But Drew is a man of continuous motion, of dogged 
determination, attributes the Lakers have not had in a true backup point guard 
in recent seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Drew came from behind to steal the ball from Davis, leading to a basket and a 
quick five-point turnaround that helped turn what was a close game into an 
eventual 107-98 Laker victory over the Mavericks before 16,927, the first 
non-sellout in 37 Laker games at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I should apologize to her," said Drew, referring to the Laker Girl he 
leveled. "But that steal, that has to be the easiest steal of my career. I 
don't think Davis even saw me coming." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers figure to see more of this from Drew. Proving an able backup to 
Magic Johnson at point guard, Drew scored 15 points and had four assists, his 
most productive offensive game of the season. He added to his usual steady 
ballhandling by making seven of nine shots, most of them from outside. 
</P>
<P>
This is new to the Lakers. In recent seasons, Drew's predecessors -- Wes 
Matthews and David Rivers -- hardly played and did not produce when called 
upon, so Coach Pat Riley was forced to play Michael Cooper out of position. 
</P>
<P>
But Sunday night, Drew not only fulfilled his role of feeding passes to James 
Worthy (22 points) and Byron Scott (20) and backing up or playing alongside 
Johnson (22), but he also looked for his own shots. 
</P>
<P>
And already, it looks as if Drew is the Lakers' best off-season acquisition, 
Vlade Divac notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what Larry is about," said Riley, whose team improved its record to 
5-1. "As the season progresses, he'll get more confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"For the last four or five years, Coop has been our backup point guard, but he 
was more of a maintenance guard, just keeping us in the game. But Larry can run 
the break and create other things. Right now, he's still learning the plays and 
adjusting to our style." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers appear near top form, even though they shot just 45.2% and were 
outrebounded, 42-39. Their defensive pressure forced the Mavericks into 20 
turnovers, and they received scoring inside and outside from Worthy and 
Johnson, and almost exclusively outside production from Drew and Scott. 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, the Lakers held the Mavericks under 100 points. That is not 
unusual, though. The Mavericks have been held under triple figures in all four 
losses this season, their only victory coming over the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Roy Tarpley was held to 12 points, but had 14 rebounds. Adrian Dantley 
led the Mavericks with 18 points. But the starting backcourt of Rolando 
Blackman and Derek Harper combined to make nine of 25 shots and 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' backcourt, whatever the combination, has been productive. Drew's 
acquisition has allowed Riley to play Cooper at forward, his natural position, 
and either rest Johnson or play him on the front line with Worthy and A.C. 
Green. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than being wary of a newcomer, as sometimes happens in the NBA, Laker 
veterans embraced Drew. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was asked last summer what we needed, the first thing I said was a 
point guard," Johnson said. "I've been enjoying it since we got Larry here. It 
frees me up to do other things. There's no more wear and tear on me." 
</P>
<P>
Well, not as much. Johnson missed a nearly four minutes of the first quarter 
after being hit in the head and sustaining a neck strain. Riley went with 
Cooper at point guard in that instance and, coincidentally or not, the Lakers 
lost a nine-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Drew spelled Johnson in the second quarter and scored seven points, then played 
with Johnson for part of the fourth quarter and sank four jump shots. 
</P>
<P>
Before Sunday night, Drew made just 34.5% of his shots. But he attempted only 
25 shots in 96 minutes. Riley, among others, urged Drew to look for his shot 
more. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I'm just trying to get the feel for the system," Drew said. "I 
haven't been worried about my shooting. When I'm out there with Earvin and 
James, I look to get them the ball where they like it. 
</P>
<P>
"(Riley) has been talking to me about stepping in and taking the shot when I'm 
open. But I'm not concerned. My philosophy is to play tough defense and let 
your offense generate from that." 
</P>
<P>
Said Johnson: "We kept saying to him, L.D., shoot. Shoot. Shoot. He finally did 
tonight. Then, everybody said, OK. He showed us. He used to light it up against 
us all the time. We were waiting for him to light it up for us." 
</P>
<P>
Drew admits coming to the Lakers has been an adjustment, not just learning 
Riley's offense but also adjusting to a backup role on a winning team. Last 
seen in the NBA two years ago, Drew was a member of the chronically losing 
Clippers. He spent last season playing in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"With the Clippers, it was more me having to create for myself," Drew said. 
"Here, I am running the offense and putting us into the flow. Now, I'm giving 
it to guys who can create with the ball." 
</P>
<P>
On evidenced Sunday night, Drew can be creative himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson on the recurrence of his neck injury: "It's a little sore, but 
it'll be all right." . . . Statistic of the night, courtesy of Laker public 
relations director Josh Rosenfeld: Sunday was the 54th consecutive Laker 
victory on a night when they have not sold out the Forum. . . . Forward Orlando 
Woolridge is eligible to come off the injured list, but there is no timetable 
for his return after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on Oct. 17 to remove bone 
fragments from his right knee. "We haven't had any word yet," Laker Coach Pat 
Riley said. "I'd have to say it'll still be a couple weeks. We aren't going to 
rush him. But when we do get him back, he'll be a big addition for us." . . . 
James Worthy, who slightly sprained his right ankle Thursday night against the 
Golden State Warriors, played 44 minutes Friday against Charlotte but rested 
the ankle on Saturday. "It's better," Worthy said before Sunday night's game. 
"The day off helped. But I'm getting used to the soreness -- all through my 
body." 
</P>
<P>
Partly because of the Lakers' 44% shooting from the field, Riley is starting to 
implement more offensive patterns from last season and less of what he calls 
free-flowing. "We've only been using about 25% of the things that were in our 
offense last year," Riley said. "What I wanted to do was keep it really simple, 
but what I'm not satisfied with right now is that we're getting random shot 
selection. There's nothing wrong with guys having the green light, but they are 
getting shots at random. We used to have a very controled offense. The design 
was to get the ball to specific guys for high percentage shots. Playing in the 
flow right now, we are allowing the ball to be shot by whoever has the best 
shot . . . but we do have to get back to some very specific plays we've run for 
a long time. In the next 15 games, we'll be back to 25% more controled plays." 
</P>
<P>
The Mavericks probably were happy to get back on the road Sunday. They played 
the Clippers in Los Angeles on Wednesday, earning their only victory, then 
returned to Dallas and lost to Portland, 99-91, on Friday. The Mavericks are 
0-2 at home and hearing it from disgruntled Reunion Arena fans. "Of all the 
teams I've been on," forward Adrian Dantley said, "I've never heard the fans go 
off like that." That's saying something, since Dantley has played on six teams 
in his 14-year career. . . . The Lakers are off today and Tuesday, then play 
the Indiana Pacers Wednesday night at the Forum.

RAIDERS COME UNGLUED AS LEAD DOES NOT STICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Raiders had a hole punched in their honeymoon and a dent put in their 
future. They blew a 12-0 lead and a game they needed and now they're back in 
the pack. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't score a touchdown Sunday night, settling for four field goals for 
their four incursions inside the San Diego 20-yard line, and falling finally, 
14-12, to the upstart Chargers, dropping Art Shell to 4-2, his Raiders to 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
That thud you heard was their fortune falling . . . 
</P>
<P>
Raider special teams bled big plays: a kickoff return for a touchdown, the 
second they've given up in three weeks; a blocked punt. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Schroeder had three interceptions, which may make next Sunday the day we 
learn if Steve Beuerlein can play on crutches. 
</P>
<P>
"This one's still kind of a shock," Howie Long said. 
</P>
<P>
Did he think they'd lost one they might need? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," Long said. "It's a big game. It's not the end of the year but it's a 
big game." 
</P>
<P>
The ones you have halfway in your pocket on the road are gigantic. The Raiders 
almost doubled Charger yardage in the first half (196-100) when it was unclear 
what the home team had in mind: Comedy? Tragedy? 
</P>
<P>
What do you call it when your kicker makes a 24-yard field goal . . . and 
you're flagged for delay of game . . . and then your center snaps the ball back 
to midfield . . . and your kicker is flattened trying to recover? 
</P>
<P>
That was ex-Raider Chris Bahr, who was carried off on a stretcher but returned 
with sprained ribs to kick the vital two extra points. In case Bahr was not 
available, Billy Ray Smith had warmed up his kicking form at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the third period, the Raiders stood at the Charger eight-yard line. 
The brilliant-once-more Bo Jackson had 101 yards in 16 carries, having just 
gone for 13, five, six, two, five, five and two in this drive, carrying the 
ball eight times in 10 plays. 
</P>
<P>
It was third and three. The Raiders ran Bo around right end once more . . . but 
Leslie O'Neal came across and snuffed the play for a seven-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Jaeger came on to kick his fourth field goal for a 12-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Then Jaeger, who was supposed to be kicking away from Anthony Miller, got one 
too close. Miller moved over to the middle of the field, caught it, made a 
break back for the right sideline and zipped 91 yards into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, it was 12-7 . . . and the Raiders were unraveling. 
</P>
<P>
On their next possession, Schroeder, under a safety blitz, floated an pass to 
ex-Raider Sammy Seale, who made the interception. This almost led to the 
go-ahead score, except that Mike Harden arranged a little miracle, stripping 
Tim Spencer at the goal line when the Charger halfback was about to complete an 
11-yard scoring run, and recovered the ball himself at the Raider one. 
</P>
<P>
He only prolonged Sunday night's inevitable, it turned out. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders ran three plays and punted -- but not as far as they had hoped. 
Linebacker Ken Woodard got a hand on Jeff Gossett's kick and it knuckled only 
14 yards to the Raider 23. 
</P>
<P>
For those of you with fantastic memories, Woodard is an ex-Bronco, who turned 
the 1986 opener in Denver around against the Raiders, stealing the ball from 
Marcus Allen and carrying it into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
From the 23, it took the Chargers four plays to score. Spencer got all three 
running calls in the little drive, the last from the Raider five. This time, 
when the oath to the goal opened up, he draped both hands over the football, 
and carried it safely to glory. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders had one more possession but O'Neal took care of that. With third 
and eight at the Charger 41, Schroeder scrambled 18 yards for what would have 
been a first down -- except that Rory Graves was called for holding O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
On the next play, third and 18, O'Neal broke through a double team by Graves 
and John Gesek and sacked Schroeder. 
</P>
<P>
The Charger offense then ran out the last 4:21, getting two first downs and 
retiring the Raider offense for the night. 
</P>
<P>
"Our guys had a line in the locker room," said a Charger official. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo don't know end zone." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
At 5-5, the Raiders trail two wild-card contenders by a game -- Miami and 
tonight's Houston Oiler-Cincinnati Bengal winner, both 6-4. The Raiders are at 
Houston next week. . . . Bo Jackson had 103 yards in 21 carries, has three 
consecutive 100-yard games. He had never really had one before this stretch -- 
only his 221-yard game at Seattle and no others of more than 100. . . . Art 
Shell, asked if Jay Schroeder had been sharp enough: "I don't even want to 
think about that right now. I have to watch the films to see if somebody ran 
the wrong route. There are a lot of things that go into it."

Schroeder, asked what he thought of his play: "I don't know. It's hard to say 
what happened individually. We tried hard as a group." . . . Steve Beuerlein 
says he wasn't ready last week, although he practiced lightly, but has hopes 
for this week. "It definitely has a way to go still, but I do feel good about 
my chances," he said of his injured right knee. "I have a tendency to kind of 
paint a rosy picture but I really feel, with a couple days off, I have a 
chance. I have strength straight ahead. It's just not that stable 
side-to-side." . . . The first half was a penalty-plagued mess. Charger guards 
David Richards, the ex-UCLA Bruin, and Broderick Thompson had five holding 
penalties and a false start trying to handle the Raider defensive line.

Michael Chang played almost flawlessly Sunday in crushing Guy Forget of France, 
6-2, 6-1, 6-1, to win the Wembley indoor championships in London. 
</P>
<P>
It was Chang's first tournament victory since he won the French Open title in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
Chang, seeded second, needed only 90 minutes to beat the unseeded Forget. 
Chang, 17, won $80,000, and Forget, who returned to the circuit in September 
after a five-month injury layoff, earned $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It was good to come here and win," Chang said. "I've only got the Masters to 
go, and finishing off the year well is a good confidence boost." 
</P>
<P>
Forget said no matter what he tried, it did not work against Chang. 
</P>
<P>
"It just got worse and worse," Forget said. "Every time I tried to find a 
solution, he came up with a better answer." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe teamed with Jakob Hlasek to win the doubles title by defeating Jeremy 
Bates of Britain and Kevin Curren, 6-1, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Zina Garrison of Houston struggled past the Soviet Union's Larisa 
Savchenko to score a 6-3, 2-6, 6-4 victory in the $250,000 Virginia Slims 
tournament at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt a little bit slow out there today," Garrison said. "The second set she 
hit the ball and won the points and there was nothing I could possibly have 
done. It's just a matter of saying . . . 'I've been working hard, and if you're 
going to beat me, you got to keep hitting winners.' " 
</P>
<P>
Garrison, 25, ranked No 5 in the world, won $50,000 by defeating the unseeded 
Savchenko, 23, for the fourth time in as many matches. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt kind of hopeless out there," Garrison said. "Her backhands were just 
falling . . . Whatever she did was like gold." 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Lendl held off a tough opening-set effort by Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden 
and turned the final into a rout to win the Stockholm Open. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, the world's top-ranked player, won, 7-5, 6-0, 6-3. It was his first 
victory in this tournament, the world's oldest Grand Prix indoors, and his 83rd 
career singles title. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl earned $200,000, Gustafsson $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Gustafsson, who was ranked 92nd in the world, upset three seeded players en 
route to the final -- No. 12 Paolo Cane of Italy, No. 4 Andre Agassi and No. 8 
Mats Wilander of Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Lozano of Mexico and Todd Witsken of Carmel, Ind., defeated the 
top-seeded team of Rick Leach and Jim Pugh, 6-3, 5-7, 6-3, in the doubles 
final. 
</P>
<P>
Sixth-seeded Leila Meskhi became the first Soviet woman in 15 years to win a 
regular-circuit tournament in the United States, defeating second seeded Helen 
Kelesi of Canada, 6-3, 6-4, in a Virginia Slims tournament at Brentwood, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
The last Soviet woman to win a championship was Olga Morozova, who beat Billie 
Jean King in 1974 in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Netter of UCLA defeated Arizona's Scott Sigerseth, 6-4, 6-1, to win the 
Rolex-Intercollegiate tournament at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's Trevor Kronemann and Shige Kanroji, the country's top-ranked doubles 
team, beat Mark Knowles and Fritz Bissell of UCLA, 7-6 (7-3), 6-4, in that 
final.

DETROIT DERAILS MAJKOWSKI, PACKERS;

LIONS: THEY BUILD A 24-3 HALFTIME LEAD, THEN HOLD ON FOR A 31-22 VICTORY.

Green Bay's Dan Majkowski ran out of miracles just as Detroit's stubborn 
defense was running out of gas Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Peete threw two touchdown passes to Richard Johnson and the defense set 
up all of Detroit's points as the Lions beat the Packers, 31-22, for only their 
second win of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Packers have come back to win four games in the fourth quarter this season, 
including a last-second, 14-13 win over the Chicago Bears last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't anybody write that there was a letdown," Packer Coach Lindy Infante 
said. "There was no letdown today. We just got beat by a better team." 
</P>
<P>
The Packers, with Majkowski passing for over 300 yards for the fourth straight 
game, finished with a 31-8 edge in first downs, a 432-128 advantage in total 
yards and controlled the ball 39:25 to Detroit's 20:35. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lions stand-and-deliver defense -- which put Green Bay in a 24-3 hole 
by halftime -- came up with two interceptions, five sacks for 36 yards in 
losses and recovered two of three Green Bay fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of credit has to go to the defense," Peete said. "They got us great 
field position. It's easy to get those 20- and 30-yard drives and score." 
</P>
<P>
Majkowski, who has four of his seven career 300-plus games against Detroit, 
completed 34 of 59 passes for 357 yards but had two costly interceptions, one 
of which was returned 23 yards for a touchdown by Jerry Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason, the ball was slippery," Majkowski said. "I was throwing a lot 
of high balls. They were getting away from me." 
</P>
<P>
His 59 attempts broke the club record of 54 by Randy Wright against San 
Francisco in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed a better effort in the first half," Majkowski said. "We seem to be 
in these situations every week. We're putting ourselves in these situations." 
</P>
<P>
Peete completed only seven of 15 for 77 yards with one interception, but had 
touchdown passes of 17 and eight yards to Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't play a particularly good ballgame today, but I'll take that and get a 
win any time," Peete said. "I had a tough time getting into a rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
The Packers (5-5) dropped to third place, behind Minnesota and Chicago, in the 
NFC Central. Detroit is 2-8. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play well in the first half," Infante said. "We dug ourselves too 
big a hole. We put points on the board in the second half but we couldn't 
generate enough."

DITKA IS EXCITED AFTER BEARS WIN ONE, 20-0

<TEXT>
<P>
A few weeks ago, Coach Mike Ditka said he wasn't sure if his Chicago Bears 
could win another game. 
</P>
<P>
But the Bears' 20-0 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers Sunday was proof 
Ditka's dire prediction was premature. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears turned six Pittsburgh turnovers into 17 points and improved to 6-4, 
one game behind the NFC Central-leading Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited," Ditka said. "I'm encouraged." 
</P>
<P>
Left cornerback Lemuel Stinson, starting in place of Donnell Woolford, had two 
of Chicago's three interceptions. Woolford missed the game because of an eye 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
Stinson covered Louis Lipps, who caught four passes for 112 yards, including a 
60-yard reception. But Stinson also intercepted two passes intended for Lipps. 
</P>
<P>
"Stinson got beat on some plays, but he came back and made some big plays, 
too," Ditka said. 
</P>
<P>
The first interception came on Bubby Brister's first pass of the game and the 
other stopped a Steelers' drive at the Bears' five-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
"Give credit where it's due because he made the plays," Brister said. "But I 
threw the ball right to him." 
</P>
<P>
The Bears' defensive line pressured Brister throughout the game, recording four 
sacks for a loss of 35 yards. One on sack, tackle William Perry threw Brister 
for a 17-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
Perry, whose season was described as "mediocre" by Ditka earlier in the week, 
had four tackles, two sacks and a fumble recovery. 
</P>
<P>
"William played well," said defensive end Richard Dent, who shares the right 
side with Perry. "Nobody's been really running at us the last couple of weeks, 
so we haven't had the opportunity to make the plays." 
</P>
<P>
The shutout was the Bears' first this season. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Butler kicked field goals of 39 and 35 yards. That gave him 22 
consecutive field goals, tying him for the NFL record with Mark Moseley, who 
did it in 1981-82. Butler is 12 for 12 this season.

MIAMI: TRAILING 20-3 LATE IN FIRST HALF, DOLPHINS BOUNCE BACK WITH BIG PLAYS TO 
WIN, 31-23.

<P>
While Dan Marino was making the big plays, the New York Jets were failing on 
the little ones. 
</P>
<P>
Marino threw for three touchdowns as Miami's quick-striking attack rallied from 
a 17-point deficit to beat the New York Jets, 31-23, Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"That's Dan," Dolphin Coach Don Shula said. "That's what he's done throughout 
his career for us. He makes things happen." 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins, beating the Jets for the first time in five years, started making 
it happen when they trailed, 20-3, with 1:28 to go in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Marino, who has had a lot of big games against the Jets, passed to rookie Andre 
Brown for a seven-yard score with 44 seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Then in the third quarter, Marino had two big touchdown pass plays, one good 
for 78 yards to Mark Clayton and another good for 65 yards to Scott Schwedes, 
who was playing in the place of injured Mark Duper. 
</P>
<P>
Sammie Smith added a two-yard touchdown run as the Dolphins outscored the Jets, 
21-0, in the third quarter. The Jets (2-8) are 0-5 at home. 
</P>
<P>
"We hit the big plays, which is what we always have to do against the Jets," 
Marino said. "That's always the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
One of those plays was a big kick. Dolphin rookie Pete Stoyanovich connected on 
the third longest field goal in NFL history, a 59-yarder, in the second period. 
Kicking with a stiff wind estimated at 25 m.p.h., Stoyanovich's line drive 
barely cleared the crossbar. Only Tom Dempsey of New Orleans (63 yards) and 
Steve Cox of Cleveland (60) have done better. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets, meanwhile, were plagued by failures on short-yardage situations. They 
failed on six third or fourth down situations when they needed one yard, 
including twice on runs by Johnny Hector near the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
Inexplicably, the Jets went outside on nearly all the short-yardage plays. 
</P>
<P>
"Their force underneath our guards forced me to go outside," said Hector, who 
has the option where to run on such plays. "They made the plays, we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Which is why Miami is 6-4 and, with a relatively easy schedule ahead, has a 
good shot at the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
After Stoyanovich's kick, the Jets moved 69 yards in six plays, with Ken 
O'Brien throwing a flare pass to Freeman McNeil, who carried into the end zone 
to complete a 25-yard scoring play. 
</P>
<P>
That made it 20-3 with 1:28 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Then Marino, stymied earlier by two interceptions and his own fumble, needed 
just 44 seconds to get Miami its first touchdown. He passed to Schwedes for 32 
and 10 yards, then threw to Brown for the score. 
</P>
<P>
It took Marino just one play in the second half to make it 20-17. Clayton beat 
Bobby Humphery's one-on-one coverage for the longest touchdown reception of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great call by Marino, it wasn't the play called in the huddle," 
Clayton said. "When he came to the line and saw we had man coverage, he checked 
off. He just put it up where it had to be and I just ran to where I had to be." 
</P>
<P>
Stoyanovich missed a 52-yarder to tie midway through the third quarter. But 
Marino struck quickly again late in the period, giving Miami the lead with his 
65-yard touchdown pass to Schwedes.

Three fumbles in the game's first seven minutes Sunday gave Indianapolis Colt 
Coach Ron Meyer a mountainous problem. 
</P>
<P>
"As I said coming in, it looks like a very steep hill," Meyer said in reference 
to Indianapolis' playoff chances after a 30-7 loss to the Buffalo Bills. "It 
looks like Mount Everest right now." 
</P>
<P>
The Colts (4-6) are three games behind the first-place Bills (7-3) in the race 
for the AFC East title and two games behind second-place Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"It is best when you control your own destiny," Colts' offensive tackle Chris 
Hinton said. "But now we have to win the rest of our games and we also need 
some help from other teams if we are going to catch Buffalo." 
</P>
<P>
The game's turning point may have come on the opening kickoff, when Mark Pike 
ripped the ball out of Indianapolis returner James Pruitt's hands. Mickey 
Sutton recovered for Buffalo on the Colt 22-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
"That fumble was a big emotional lift for us," Sutton said. "Both teams came 
out all psyched up and that play set the tone for the whole game." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Kelly took advantage of the mistake, connecting with Thurman Thomas for the 
first of Kelly's three touchdown passes on the day with only 2:12 gone in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
That fumble was forced by a hard hit. The Colts, especially running back Eric 
Dickerson, had no such excuse on the fumbles that ended their next two 
possessions. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Smith recovered Dickerson's first fumble, giving Buffalo the ball at 
midfield, and Scott Norwood kicked a 42-yard field goal to make it 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
On the first play after the ensuing kickoff, Dickerson, who didn't talk to 
reporters after the game, fumbled again when the ball bounced off his knee. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills turned that into a 40-yard field goal by Norwood for a 13-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Touchdown passes of 32 and three yards from Kelly to Andre Reed in the second 
quarter made it 27-0 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills rushed for 232 yards in 51 carries. Thomas had 127 yards in 29 
attempts.

COODY ENDS 16-YEAR DROUGHT WITH PLAYOFF WIN

Charles Coody sank a six-foot birdie putt on the second hole of sudden death to 
earn his first victory in three years on the Senior Tour, winning the Las Vegas 
tournament Sunday at the Desert Inn Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
It was also the first win of any kind in 16 years for Coody. His last victory 
came on the PGA European Tour in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Coody, who entered the final round one stroke ahead of Al Geiberger and Tom 
Shaw, beat out Bob Charles and Chi Chi Rodriguez after shooting an 11-under-par 
205 in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
He shot a bogey-free 69 and used a key save of par on the final hole of 
regulation to forge his way into his first professional playoff. 
</P>
<P>
All three players parred the first playoff hole before Rodriguez's 30-foot 
birdie chip from the fringe at the next hole glanced off the pin and stopped 
inches away. Charles then left a 20-foot birdie putt on the left lip. 
</P>
<P>
Coody responded by sinking his six-footer from below the hole. He earned 
$45,000 for the win. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez might have won had he pulled the pin from the cup instead of leaving 
it in on the second playoff hole. The ball, headed for the middle of the cup, 
hit the pin lightly and bounced inches away. 
</P>
<P>
Charles also had a chance at victory as he stood 12 feet from birdie on the 
first playoff hole but left the shot for his sixth victory of the season inches 
short. It was his bogey in regulation at the par-5 15th hole that first hurt 
his chances, however. 
</P>
<P>
Finishing third was Dave Hill at 207. Al Geiberger, who won at Las Vegas in 
1987, was next at 209. 
</P>
<P>
Charles and Rodriguez earned $24,625 each for placing second in the $300,000 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Senior of Australia recovered from a double bogey at the 14th hole to 
beat Jim Benepe and win the Australian PGA championship in Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Senior, who was tied with Benepe going into the final round, carded a 
one-under-par 71 to win by one stroke after Benepe three-putted the final hole 
to end up with a par-72. 
</P>
<P>
Jose-Maria Olazabal of Spain shot a 67 for a 13-under-par 203 total and 
three-stroke victory in a rain-shortened tournament in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Isao Aoki, who tied the course record with a 65, tied for second with Naomichi 
Ozaki at 206. Barry Lane of Britain eagled the 18th hole for the second time in 
the tournament to tie Ken Green and Nobuo Serizawa for fourth place at 207.

'MAGNOLIAS' COMES UP ROSES FOR RIGHT CHARITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD ROUILARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is rarely a direct connection between the film and the charity cause at 
benefit premieres. Usually the beneficiary of the event is just the studio 
executive's favorite charity. So occasionally the film's stars pull an end run 
around the gala dinner, heading directly for their stretch limousines after the 
screening. Tsk, tsk, tsk. 
</P>
<P>
But the charity was right at home on Thursday night for the benefit premiere of 
Tri-Star Pictures' "Steel Magnolias" at the Cineplex Odeon in Century City. The 
film and the cause were so intimately related that the sold-out 1,400 guest 
crowd missed not a moment of the film nor a second of the gala supper that 
followed at the Los Angeles Ballroom in the Century Plaza Hotel, including 
every one of the film's stars -- Sally Field, Dolly Parton, Shirley MacLaine, 
Daryl Hannah, Olympia Dukakis and Tom Skerritt. 
</P>
<P>
The story of "Steel Magnolias" revolves around a diabetic played by Julia 
Roberts. In theater No. 2 (extra screens had to be added for the huge turnout), 
the guests of the American Diabetes Assn. watched with nary a dry eye in the 
house. Some of them sighed during the film, quietly noting how similar this 
film is to their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
As guests streamed out of the theaters for the gala across the street at the 
Century Plaza, handkerchiefs attended the eyes and press agents attended the 
stars. There was a great deal of chatter about probable Academy Award 
nominations. Even studio heads for whom this picture represents competition 
were sanguine. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Wells, president and CEO of Walt Disney Pictures, who was also honorary 
chairman of the benefit, remarked that "it's a wonderful film, truly 
wonderful." That dashing duo, Jon Peters and Peter Guber, the once and future 
kings of Columbia Pictures, said "great . . . great . . . great . . . yeah, 
great" as they dashed over to the supper. Tri-Star President Jeff Sagansky was 
all smiles. And Ray "I Really Don't Talk to the Press" Stark, whose company, 
Rastar, produced the film, received congratulations from the crowd around him. 
</P>
<P>
The stars of the picture moved around en mass. All the female stars entered and 
left the screening arm in arm. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Field, in a skinny, skinny black velvet Norma Kamali, noted that she felt 
"like I had died and gone to heaven," working with this remarkable ensemble of 
talent: "It was an unbelievable experience -- really joyous and lots of 
laughter." 
</P>
<P>
Director Herbert Ross, in charge of containing all the laughter, stated 
categorically "that it was one of the most spectacular groups I've ever worked 
with." Julia Roberts sensed that a nearly telepathic communication developed 
between the cast members: "When one person was in trouble, suddenly the others 
were right there, personally and professionally." Shirley MacLaine added, "We 
were instant friends. Instant." But Tom Skerritt, the only male lead, had some 
trouble. "I had a love affair with six women," he said, referring to the six 
female stars, "and that's not easy." 
</P>
<P>
The dinner was a quiet, personal affair where many of the film's principals 
related the movie to their lives. Playwright/screenwriter Robert Harling noted 
that this film was a memorial to his sister. Tom Skerritt talked about his 
diabetic brother and his mother who died of diabetic complications. Dolly 
Parton's grandmother also died from complications of diabetes. "I kept her on a 
strict diet," Parton said. "It was hard. But then, it's hard to see suffering 
of any kind. We do what we can." 
</P>
<P>
The evening raised more than $500,000 for the American Diabetes Assn. ADA 
Premiere Committee chair Brigitte Medvin was thrilled, but not surprised, at 
the turnout. "We have had very successful premieres over the last 15 years," 
Medvin said. "The hard-working committees of the ADA have raised more than $4 
million since we first premiered 'Towering Inferno.' " 
</P>
<P>
The proceeds have been applied exclusively to diabetes research. According to 
Tri-Star vice president Richard Fischoff, the three benefit premieres of "Steel 
Magnolias" -- Los Angeles, New York and Atlanta -- have raised more than $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Also present were Chevy Chase, Doug Cramer, William Morris agent Ames Cushing, 
Lee Radziwill, Vanity Fair magazine's Wendy Stark, Columbia Pictures President 
Dawn Steel, Music Center mavens Lenore and Bernard Greenberg, Tony Thomopoulos 
and Cristina Ferrare, Marcia Weisman, Fred and Joan Nicholas, and Kiefer 
Sutherland.

FRANKENHEIMER RECEPTION ROUNDS UP FILMLAND PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American Cinematheque's John Frankenheimer Retrospective this weekend, 
although well done, paled in comparison with the director's first Los Angeles 
round-up. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in the Air Force in the early '50s," Frankenheimer recalled at Friday's 
opening-night reception at the Directors Guild. "They sent me out to do a 
documentary on registered cattle -- what a way to keep the guys off the 
street!" 
</P>
<P>
In researching the film, Frankenheimer met Harry Howard, impresario of "Ranch 
Round-Up," a televised paean to bovine talent. Frankenheimer was offered a job 
as the show's writer, then, when the director was immobilized by alcohol, given 
that job, too. 
</P>
<P>
"There were two cameras," he said. "One on the cows and one on Harry. And Harry 
told me to make sure the camera stayed on him." 
</P>
<P>
From such basic directorial advice, Frankenheimer launched a career that 
includes hundreds of hours of live, televised drama in the '50s, and more than 
two dozen motion pictures, including "The Manchurian Candidate," "Seven Days in 
May," "Black Sunday" and "Grand Prix." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his "Ranch Round-Up" beginnings, birds, not cows, were the main focus 
of the Frankenheimer night that began with a VIP reception, attended by more 
than 100 Cinematheque patrons, before the screening of "Birdman of Alcatraz." 
</P>
<P>
Among those nibbling on the light buffet were Piper Laurie, who starred in 
Frankenheimer's "Playhouse 90" version of "Days of Wine and Roses"; Wolf 
Schmidt, producer of his upcoming "The Fourth War"; and Jeff Berg, the 
director's agent from ICM. 
</P>
<P>
Burt Lancaster, the star of "Birdman," was on hand to introduce the film and 
reminisce with the director. 
</P>
<P>
During the repartee before the screening, Lancaster drew a gasp from the 
audience by revealing that, unbeknown to Frankenheimer or himself, a handler 
had prepared the birds in "Birdman" for scenes in which they grew ill and fell 
from their perches by pouring lighter fluid down their throats. 
</P>
<P>
Though he and Frankenheimer had a difficult relationship on their first film 
together, "The Young Savages," Lancaster specifically requested the director 
for "Birdman." 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody, but nobody, handles a camera like John," said Lancaster. "If John has 
any weakness, in my opinion, at least in those days, he was not sure of himself 
in dealing with scripts. It was difficult for him to deal with scripts in 
motion picture terms. I'd have to assume he knows how to deal with them now." 
</P>
<P>
For Frankenheimer, the problem these days isn't in dealing with scripts, but in 
getting the backing to film them, he noted: "It's terribly difficult to get a 
film made today. You have to go with the flow; you have to go with what you can 
get financed."

SAN DIEGO'S SOVIET ARTS FESTIVAL WAS A STEP IN RIGHT DIRECTION FOR THE CITY;

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Well, it's over. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's first international arts festival -- Treasures of the Soviet Union 
-- officially came to a close Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Did the event, as mayor and festival founder Maureen O'Connor predicted, 
enhance the city's "public image as a player on the international arts scene"? 
Did it transform San Diego, as she anticipated, "from an also-ran city to a 
cultural power"? Did the festival, as she hoped, get the attention of the Wall 
Street Journal and the New York Times? 
</P>
<P>
Critical reviews of festival events stopped considerably short of the mayor's 
hyperbole, and press coverage didn't include several major East Coast 
publications, but neither did the festival seem "thrown together" as some early 
naysayers accused. 
</P>
<P>
Becoming a player on the international arts scene seldom happens overnight, and 
usually not after one test. San Diego's cultural reputation, as defined by this 
triennial festival, will be made over time. But all things considered, the 
journey isn't off to a bad start. 
</P>
<P>
The primary measure of a festival's artistic success comes from how, and where, 
it is critically received. 
</P>
<P>
The artistic high point of the festival was undoubtedly "Brothers and Sisters," 
the epic production by the Maly Theater, which received its U.S. premiere at 
the Old Globe. National coverage of the play included glowing reviews in the 
Christian Science Monitor, USA Today, Variety, the Los Angeles Times and both 
Chicago papers -- the Tribune and the Sun-Times. 
</P>
<P>
But the New York Times -- the newspaper that first wrote about the play more 
than a year ago -- chose to avoid it in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not reviewing it for the simple reason that our main responsibility is 
to major openings in New York," said Frank Rich, theater critic for the New 
York Times, who is among the most respected theater critics in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, that would be true of any out-of-town production, whether it be in San 
Diego or Philadelphia. There was no way to justify our going to San Diego to 
review 'Brothers and Sisters,' which we had written about before. As you know, 
the play was supposed to premiere in New York but didn't because the people 
trying to put it together couldn't come up with the money." 
</P>
<P>
But the Maly production did impress a representative of a national theater 
organization based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Lindy Zesch, associate director of the Theatre Communications Group -- of which 
all of San Diego's major theaters are members -- sounded like a billboard of 
superlatives in saying that the impact of "Brothers and Sisters" on the 
American theatrical community was "enormous . . . stupendous . . . marvelous." 
She said that based on "Brothers and Sisters" alone, the San Diego arts 
festival had to be considered a major success. And, if anything, she said, it 
only serves to bolster the "already eminent reputation" of the Old Globe 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Brothers and Sisters' is a major, major theatrical work," Zesch said by 
telephone from New York. "And apart from the play itself" -- which Zesch said 
she came to San Diego to see -- "I would say the San Diego festival is a model 
for the country as a whole. I would call it a tremendous success -- 
absolutely." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the national press coverage paid only perfunctory attention to the rest 
of the festival. The San Diego 
</P>
<P>
Opera's production of "Boris Godunov" was briefly mentioned by USA Today and 
the Sun-Times, which also made passing reference to the San Diego Repertory 
Theater's world premiere production of "Slingshot." 
</P>
<P>
The festival's music presentations had no premieres on a par with "Brothers and 
Sisters." 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Opera netted strong reviews for "Boris Godunov," which featured 
five Soviet singers in key roles and a Soviet conductor. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Dyer, music critic for the Boston Globe, called the opera "an old 
standby." 
</P>
<P>
Dyer said Boston's 1988 Soviet festival -- "Making Music Together" -- was, in 
his opinion, far more compelling than anything San Diego offered. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston festival's musical offerings included the world premiere of "Dead 
Souls," an opera based on a novel by Nikolai Gogol, with music by Rodion 
Shchedrin. 
</P>
<P>
The chorus and cast were equally divided among Americans and Soviets, Dyer 
said, pointing out that a 50-50 exchange was the purpose of "Making Music 
Together." In that respect, Boston's festival was celebrated not only for being 
the first of its kind but for innovativeness in concept, for taking chances 
artistically. Every single one of its works was contemporary, Dyer said. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-piece Soloists of Leningrad ensemble made its North American debut at 
the San Diego festival, performing alone and with the San Diego Symphony in a 
program that included the U.S. premiere of a work by Soviet composer Vladimir 
Tarnopolsky and the world premiere of a work by American Joseph Schwantner 
commissioned for the festival. 
</P>
<P>
In another program, the symphony performed the West Coast premiere of a work by 
Shchedrin, but the San Diego festival couldn't deliver something Shchedrin 
brought to the Boston festival -- his wife, the legendary Maya Plisetskaya of 
the Bolshoi Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, ballet, arguably the Soviet Union's greatest cultural export, was 
conspicuous by its absence at the San Diego festival. The festival's short lead 
time precluded booking a major Soviet ballet troupe. The Kirov Ballet, for 
example, was already committed to a tour that included a stop in Orange County 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Artistry aside, festival organizers also faced a tremendous administrative 
challenge, and seemed to fare better on that count than their Boston 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
Having had a year to reflect, Dyer said Boston's festival was a financial and 
administrative failure, a fiasco characterized by chaos and a laughably 
Byzantine bureaucracy that attempted to coordinate artists who had never before 
worked together and did not share the same language. 
</P>
<P>
"Just to do that," he said, "took a bravery of the highest order." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego festival organizers were just as brave, spurred on by the determined 
O'Connor, who was often defensive about the event and who took every 
opportunity to admonish doubters. The final numbers aren't in yet, but the 
festival also seems to have fared well financially, judging from the number of 
sold-out events. 
</P>
<P>
That gives the mayor at least some ammunition for defending the festival's 
future. She has said, inadvertently addressing one of the criticisms of her 
leadership, that she will leave future festival planning "to the 
professionals." 
</P>
<P>
She also has said the 1992 festival should thematically recognize the 500-year 
celebration of the founding of the New World. That, too, will be a challenge 
since so much attention is being paid internationally to the anniversary and 
distinguished artists and works will be at a premium. 
</P>
<P>
So if the 1992 festival goes according to the mayor's wishes, there will be 
this bit of irony: The world's cultural community will be celebrating the 
discovery of America, while the mayor, playing a latter day Queen Isabella, 
will be trying to pave the way for the world's cultural community to discover 
San Diego.

Janet Jackson Good for Kids: Janet Jackson's latest album "Rhythm Nation 1814" 
is among the children's books and entertainment products commended by the 
quarterly magazine Parents' Choice. The magazine issues annual awards for 
books, toys, videos, rock albums, computer programs, television shows and 
magazines considered of high value to kids. "The aim is to help lead mothers 
and fathers to holiday purchases that have glamour and good sense," 
editor-in-chief Diana Huss Green said. "Trends this year indicate toy, video, 
book manufacturers are reflecting society's and parents' concerns about 
children." The list ranges from the classics of children's entertainment -- 
like the Disney Channel presentation of "Great Expectations" -- to newcomers 
such as Jackson. ABC's "The Wonder Years" and the Home Box Office presentation 
of "Babar" were among the television programs cited. Shauna Snow

MEXICAN OWNERS OUST GM, CHANGE XHRM-FM FORMAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BRASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego's only radio station managed by blacks and specifically targeting the 
black community, XHRM-FM (92.5), has new management and a new music format, the 
result of a long-running dispute between the station operators and its Mexican 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of October, Willie Morrow, general manager of XHRM for the past nine 
years, was told to cease operating the station by executives of Radio Moderna 
Mexicana, owners of the station. Under Morrow, the station featured soul, 
gospel and rap music. 
</P>
<P>
With Morrow out, the station has switched to a "power" format, featuring dance 
and light rock music. 
</P>
<P>
Morrow paid a monthly fee to the Mexican company for the right to broadcast 
over its Tijuana-based signal, much like the American-based Noble Broadcasting 
has an agreement to operate the Mexican-based XTRA. 
</P>
<P>
However, by the end of October, Morrow had not paid his monthly $55,000 user 
fee for two months. 
</P>
<P>
Best known as the force behind the successful California Curl cosmetics company 
and the San Diego Monitor weekly newspaper, Morrow says he refused to pay rent 
to protest the owner's lack of responsiveness to the station's financial 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
The disagreements started in January, 1988, Morrow said, when the station's 
Tijuana transmitter was blown down in a storm. Although a temporary antenna was 
put up a few days later, a permanent tower was not built for another nine 
months, Morrow said. The station's signal was severely weakened with the 
temporary antenna, he said. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the antenna was back, Morrow said, the station's ratings had 
plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
"At that point I lost all my national accounts," Morrow said. 
</P>
<P>
Continued problems with the studio equipment, which Morrow said he spent 
thousands of dollars to repair, further exacerbated the station's problems. 
Morrow wanted the owners to help absorb the costs of the repairs, and the 
income lost from the transmitter problems. 
</P>
<P>
Morrow hoped his refusal to pay rent would force the owners to help the station 
through rough times. Instead, they ousted Morrow and took control of the 
station. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Moderna Mexicana could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Morrow said he is seeking legal advice. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is very unfair," Morrow said. "When a natural disaster (knocks 
down the transmitter) I think the owners should share (in the costs)." 
</P>
<P>
Which came first, the controversy or the news coverage? 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night's episode of "thirtysomething" included a scene depicting two 
homosexual men in bed together. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the show was over, the KGTV (Channel 10) news team was touting 
reports about the "controversial" scene. During the 11 p.m. newscast, three 
people representing different viewpoints were on hand to analyze the episode, 
much like color commentators at a sports events. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Channel 10 decided there was going to be a controversy long before 
the show went on the air. ABC had warned its affiliates about the scene before 
Tuesday, giving stations ample time to develop news coverage. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Channel 10 received "three or four" phone calls about the 
scene Tuesday night, an unusual amount of complaints for that time of night, 
according to Channel 10 news director Paul Sands. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally thought it was interesting," said Sands, who believes the 
homosexual love scene may have been a first for network television. 
</P>
<P>
By the next day, ABC affiliates around the country were receiving calls about 
the scene, perhaps fueled by the news coverage. Without the prompt news 
coverage, there might not have been such a public stink, which leaves ABC open 
to charges that the scene was included simply as a cheap publicity stunt. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Apregan is out as general manager of KCBQ. The new station owners, Adams 
Communications, which will take over the station later this month, have hired 
Dan Carelli, general sales manager for the Edens Broadcasting station in Tampa, 
WRBQ, to be the new general manager. WRBQ features the same Top 40 dance music 
format used by its San Diego sister station, KKLQ (Q106). 
</P>
<P>
Eagle 105 fans also will notice that new billboards going up today throughout 
the county do not include the Eagle 105 moniker. The new station owners simply 
want to emphasize the traditional KCBQ call letters, according to a station 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
However, the entrance of new owners, Carelli's hiring and the new billboards 
sans Eagle 105 all fuel speculation that a format change may be in the 
station's future. Not so, say station staffers, pointing to the recent Arbitron 
rating trends report, which show Eagle making strong gains, particularly among 
listeners 25-54. 
</P>
<P>
Heads are bowed in silent remorse at Channel 8 due to the news that The Man, 
Dan Rather, will not be coming to San Diego. Seems news events in Germany have 
preempted his trip west to schmooze with local affiliates. However, the 
community forum, "San Diego Under Siege: A Town Meeting About Drugs," scheduled 
for tonight at 7 at Crawford High School, will continue as planned, with Ted 
Leitner handling the host duties solo. The forum will air Tuesday at 8 p.m. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for KNSD-TV (Channel 39) plan to file a motion for new trial in the 
case of Naomi O'Hara. Two weeks ago, a jury ordered Channel 39 to pay O'Hara 
$300,000 because of the station's 1983 news report that erroneously labeled her 
a prostitute. A grand jury report had detailed a night of barhopping featuring 
O'Hara, then-County Supervisor Paul Eckert and a third woman, who was later 
charged with prostitution. Channel 39 will seek a new trial on the grounds that 
the judge inaccurately allowed the jury to hear psychiatric testimony. If the 
motion fails, Channel 39 will appeal the jury's decision, according to attorney 
Steven Davis. . . .

A viewer might have concluded that television news departments are desperate 
for story ideas after both Channel 10 and Channel 8 chose Monday to do features 
on cholesterol. Or maybe there was some pressing new angle? No, it was simply a 
ratings sweeps week, and health issues always go over well with viewers. It was 
simply a coincidence that they picked the same day to do the stories on the 
same subject. . . .

Scott's Secret to Success: What's the key to longevity on television? Willard 
Scott says it's being goofy. "Fall on your face, tell a dumb joke, be a little 
bit of a buffoon," the "Today" show weatherman says in TV Guide. "Even though 
people will just barely tolerate you and almost (embarrassingly) shake their 
heads and say, 'My God,' they'll always invite you to the party." Bryant 
Gumbel's opinion notwithstanding, Scott says one key to his success is being 
corny. "Absolutely!" he says. "I mean, it's my mantle. I love it. Corn is 
forever!" Another key is sincerity. "I do make some stupid mistakes and say 
some dumb things but there's an honesty," he says. "And people know that I love 
them and that I love what I do." Shauna Snow

Farrell's Last Dance: Ballerina Suzanne Farrell, who made a triumphal return to 
the stage in January, 1988, after a hip operation, will dance her last dance 
with the New York City Ballet Nov. 26. The 44-year-old ballerina, who inspired 
choreographer George Balanchine to create some of his greatest dances for her, 
will perform in the Der Rosenkavalier section of "Vienna Waltzes," created by 
Balanchine in 1977. Farrell, who joined the ballet company in 1961, announced 
she would retire in 1986, but the company then said she would wait to see how 
she felt after hip-replacement surgery. She has danced in three ballets since 
then. "If my dancing has been able to express even a fraction of what Mr. B. 
gave me, I will consider myself very fortunate indeed," Farrell said of 
Balanchine. "My last bow will always be to him." Shauna Snow

THOUGHTFULNESS TRIUMPHS IN ANIMATED 'BUTTER BATTLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ralph Bakshi, the iconoclastic director of "Fritz the Cat," and Theodor "Dr. 
Seuss" Geisel, the popular children's author, sound like an odder couple than 
Neil Simon's Felix and Oscar. But their talents blend to make "The Butter 
Battle Book" (airing tonight at 5 p.m. on TNT) one of the most thoughtful and 
original animated specials in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"The Butter Battle Book," Geisel's parody of the superpower arms race, recalls 
the war in "Gulliver's Travels" between Lilliput and Blefuscu over which end of 
a boiled egg to crack. The Yooks eat their eggs with the butter side up; the 
neighboring Zooks eat theirs with the butter side down. As a child, every Yook 
is taught, "you can't trust a Zook who spreads his underneath." 
</P>
<P>
A border conflict involving a slingshot escalates into a battle between 
wonderful Seussian armaments, including the "Eight-Nozzled, Elephant-Toted 
Boom-Blitz." Finally, the rival researchers create a weapon capable of blowing 
their foes to smithereens: "The Bitsy Big-Boy Boomeroo." Geisel ends his story 
with the Yook and Zook generals atop a dividing wall, too scared to drop their 
Boomeroos -- or put them down. 
</P>
<P>
The program was obviously made on a minimal budget, but Bakshi deploys his 
resources skillfully, deftly moving the camera to compensate for the limits of 
the animation. The visuals, adapted from Geisel's illustrations, are supported 
by Charles Durning's understated reading of the narration and Glem Daum's 
forlornly martial score. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike standard cartoon specials, "The Butter Battle Book" offers parents an 
opportunity to discuss a vital issue with their children. When, upon the book's 
publication in 1984, Geisel was criticized for troubling young readers with the 
adult problem of nuclear arms, he replied: "Kids see it, they hear about it, 
they know it's there. You're not telling them anything they don't already 
know." CHARLES SOLOMON

Pope John Paul II canonized Princess Agnes of Bohemia, a medieval Czechoslovak 
nun, on Sunday in the first papal ceremony broadcast on state television in the 
Communist nation. 
</P>
<P>
The pontiff also formally conferred sainthood on a Polish friar, Adam 
Chmielowski. 
</P>
<P>
More than 9,000 Czechoslovaks, including a government delegation, packed St. 
Peter's Basilica to watch the canonization of the princess who turned nun and 
laid a framework for social work in 13th-Century Bohemia, a region that became 
part of modern Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
The live, hourlong broadcast and the unprecedented move of granting travel 
visas to Czechoslovak pilgrims reflected a marked improvement in relations 
between Prague and the Holy See in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to broadcast the ceremony appeared to be in line with an official 
effort to prevent Roman Catholic dissent at a time when Czechoslovakia's 
orthodox Communist leaders are becoming increasingly isolated from shifts 
toward democracy in other eastern European countries. 
</P>
<P>
Also canonized Sunday was Chmielowski, known as "Brother Albert." He was a 
19th-Century painter of religious themes who founded hostels for the poor and 
homeless. He became a Franciscan friar and established a congregation of 
friars.

</P>
<P>
COMPETITION: GARY KASPAROV PROVES THAT HUMANS ARE STILL MASTERS OF THE GAME. 
BUT THE MACHINES HAVE MADE GREAT STRIDES IN RECENT YEARS. 
</P>

Human players still rule the game of chess. World chess champion Gary Kasparov 
proved that last month when he easily crushed his electronic challenger, Deep 
Thought. But how long will human players maintain this advantage over 
chess-playing computers? 
</P>
<P>
That such a match took place at all provides a striking demonstration of how 
far computer chess has advanced in recent years. Only a decade ago, an expert 
player could defeat any computer program in existence. Now all but the 100 or 
so strongest players in the world would lose to today's best chess computers. 
However, Kasparov's decisive wins in both games of his match against Deep 
Thought vividly demonstrate how much further researchers have yet to go in 
designing a champion chess machine. 
</P>
<P>
Put together by a team of five graduate students at Carnegie Mellon University 
in Pittsburgh, Deep Thought played its first game in May, 1988. Since then, the 
custom-built computer has amassed a remarkable record, including several wins 
over players ranked as grandmasters and only a handful of losses. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Deep Thought became the first machine to earn a chess rating 
that put it into the top category of all chess players. Last May, it won the 
world computer chess championship, confirming its status as the world's best 
chess machine. 
</P>
<P>
But the CMU team didn't expect Deep Thought to beat Kasparov. At best, they 
thought the machine could do well enough to force at least one game into a 
draw. 
</P>
<P>
The match's real importance was the opportunity for researchers to learn from a 
chess master. "If you keep winning, you don't learn," CMU's Thomas Anantharaman 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Computer scientists and other researchers have been thinking about 
machine-based chess for a long time. In 1950, Claude E. Shannon, pioneer of 
information theory, explained why he thought chess is a challenge for 
researchers: "The problem is sharply defined, both in the allowed operations 
(the moves of chess) and in the ultimate goal (checkmate). It is neither so 
simple as to be trivial nor too difficult for satisfactory solution." 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the sheer intellectual challenge of the task of programming a 
computer to play chess, the game turns out to be useful for checking out new 
programming concepts that may eventually prove useful in other applications. In 
a sense, chess programs have the same role in developing machine intelligence 
that fruit flies, which reproduce quickly and go through many generations in a 
short time, have in genetic research. 
</P>
<P>
Deep Thought's performance is an apt illustration of how far an intelligent, 
speedy search can go toward mimicking human capabilities. All of today's chess 
programs and machines are fundamentally alike in that they depend largely on a 
systematic, exhaustive search. A computer looks ahead from its current position 
along a branching tree of possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
The program assigns a value to the end of each branch according to its 
strategic strength or weakness. These values are then compared, and the 
computer finally decides how to move. Deep Thought can scan nearly a million 
such positions per second. 
</P>
<P>
But Deep Thought and other chess computers don't play their games simply by 
working out every possible move and all its consequences for a given position. 
There are just too many possibilities for each one to be considered within the 
time limits that govern chess games. 
</P>
<P>
Typical computer chess programs are fast enough to look ahead about four moves. 
Various pruning tricks shorten the search process by taking out many useless 
and obviously silly moves. 
</P>
<P>
Another important shortcut for a program is to assume that its opponent is 
smart and will generally take one of the best moves available. The program need 
not search much beyond the point at which it identifies a particularly strong 
move its opponent can make. Then it can concentrate on responding to such a 
possible move. 
</P>
<P>
Deep Thought, for instance, incorporates an innovative search procedure known 
as "singular extension," which allows the machine to probe as many as 30 moves 
ahead along promising tracks instead of staying with a general search. 
</P>
<P>
The chief weakness of a scheme relying mainly on a fast search is that the 
program is oblivious to problems and traps that lie beyond the reach of its 
search. That's the kind of weakness that Kasparov exploited. 
</P>
<P>
"The computer is too simple, too straight, too primitive," Kasparov said before 
his first game. "If you know a computer well, you can anticipate its moves." 
</P>
<P>
Kasparov avoided the daring moves and slashing attacks that typify his most 
famous matches. Instead he deftly maneuvered Deep Thought into losing 
positions. Unable to search far enough ahead to gauge the effect of key moves 
and distracted from mounting a concerted attack, Deep Thought readily fell into 
the traps Kasparov set. 
</P>
<P>
"Kasparov created positions that forced the computer to do the wrong things," 
says CMU computer scientist and chess expert Hans Berliner, who developed 
Hitech, one of Deep Thought's rivals in the computer chess field. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a particularly clear demonstration of some of Deep Thought's 
weaknesses," says Murray Campbell, a member of the CMU team who is now working 
on a successor to Deep Thought at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in 
Yorktown Heights, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Although the games against Kasparov revealed considerable shortcomings in Deep 
Thought's play at the beginning of a game, they also showed the computer's 
strength in making the best of a bad situation. It can stave off defeat for a 
long time, making the best possible moves while waiting for its opponent to 
commit a mistake. Unfortunately for Deep Thought, Kasparov played flawlessly. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, the world champion will lose to a computer," says Feng-hsiung Hsu, 
another member of the CMU team who is now at IBM. "The question is when." 
</P>
<P>
The answer may come with IBM's project to build an advanced chess machine 
capable of evaluating a billion chess positions per second. "You can use 
technology to get increases in speed, and that's an easy way to make progress," 
Campbell says. 
</P>
<P>
Adding chess knowledge is more difficult. The chess skills usually built into a 
program are generally very simple concepts that any amateur player would know, 
but those concepts combined with speed often create computers that play chess 
better than their human programmers. And programmers are trying to incorporate 
increasingly sophisticated chess knowledge to help computers make better 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Anantharaman is looking into the possibility of designing a system that can 
learn from games played by expert human players. "Human beings are very good at 
finding things that work, but they can't really tell you how important they are 
relative to each other, even though they somehow see it instinctively," 
Anantharaman says. "Instead of trying to get a human expert to tell you exactly 
what to do, you let the program figure out for itself which strategies are good 
and how much weight to give them." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, studies show that chess experts look at only a handful of 
moves and deeply evaluate just a few of them. They tend to rely on an 
instantaneous perception of a chess position as a whole. And the human mind's 
remarkable agility enables it to respond to unexpected situations. Computers 
don't have this kind of global view. 
</P>
<P>
Kasparov is confident that human ingenuity will provide the strategies 
necessary to stay a step ahead of any chess computer, perhaps by learning from 
the way increasingly sophisticated computers themselves play. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any computer will be able to beat the world's best player before 
the end of this century," he says.

HEAT FROM ASTEROIDS KILLED EARLY LIFE FORMS, SCIENTISTS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
THE EARTH: NEW THEORY POINTS TO COLLISIONS THAT VAPORIZED THE OCEANS, 
STERILIZING THE PLANET. 
</P>

Life may have arisen on Earth several times during the planet's first billion 
years, only to be wiped out by the cataclysmic impact of asteroids, a team of 
researchers headed by geophysicist Norman Sleep of Stanford University reported 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
Asteroids landing in the Earth's oceans would have vaporized them, creating an 
atmosphere of scalding steam that would have sterilized the planet, they said. 
Only when such bombardments stopped about 3.8 billion years ago, they reported 
in the British journal Nature, would life have been able to begin evolving to 
its current complexity. 
</P>
<P>
Sleep and his colleagues said their calculations show that a 260-mile-wide 
asteroid striking Earth at a speed of 3,672 m.p.h. would create so much heat 
that the oceans would boil dry. Such an asteroid would be roughly the size of 
the larger asteroids in our solar system. 
</P>
<P>
The team acknowledged no direct evidence exists of such a devastating asteroid 
hitting Earth. That is not surprising, however, because virtually all rocks and 
geologic formations older than about 3.5 billion years have been obliterated by 
the constant activity of the tectonic plates that have formed the planet's 
continents. 
</P>
<P>
They noted, however, that the moon bears scars of heavy asteroid bombardment, 
with the last major impact occurring about 3.8 million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Earth should have been hit with many more projectiles than the moon as it has 
more surface area and larger gravity. Statistically, Earth is also likely to 
get hit with larger objects," the team wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Most scientists think Earth and nearby planets were born about 4.5 billion 
years ago from material left over as the cooling sun shrank. The oldest known 
evidence of life dates back about 3.56 billion years to fossils found in 
Australia by UCLA paleontologist J. William Schopf. Some rocks found in 
Greenland, dating back about 3.77 billion years, also have mineral ratios 
indicating they may have been formed from remains of living organisms. 
</P>
<P>
The new calculations show the hot rock vapor produced by a large asteroid would 
evaporate all ocean water and thereby sterilize the planet with hot steam, 
researchers said. It would take 1,000 to 2,000 years for Earth to cool down 
enough again to support life. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the researchers noted that the impact of an average-sized asteroid 
-- about 114 miles across -- would be powerful enough to vaporize surface 
waters containing the plankton crucial to other life forms. The impact of such 
events would only last about 300 years. 
</P>
<P>
Because heavy asteroid bombardment of Earth apparently ended about 3.8 billion 
years ago, researchers said: "Our estimate for the time of the origin of 
contiguous life converges on this date."

representatives is obvious in a community such as Orange County, where more 
than a fourth of the population is Asian, Latino or other minorities. To fail 
to include them is to risk skewing the offering of art, theater, opera and 
other cultural activities in favor of the dominant white society -- a loss for 
everyone. This is true for privately funded arts groups such as the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center, and even more true for publicly supported groups 
such as Pacific Symphony and South Coast Repertory. 
</P>
<P>
But the governing boards of arts groups in Orange County are far from 
ethnically balanced. 
</P>
<P>
The four major arts groups receiving state subsidies average just 7% 
minorities, according to the California Arts Council, which considers minority 
representation in deciding annual grants. This year, the council cited SCR's 
board composition in cutting its grant request to $81,960, which was 23% less 
than the $106,000 stipend the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
While we worry that it might be a short step from making such a cut to 
dictating local artistic decisions, the council's action does call attention to 
the need for broader representation on the SCR board. 
</P>
<P>
At present, the Tony Award-winning SCR has three minority members -- an 
Asian/Pacific Islander and two Latinos -- on its its 45-person board. First 
housed in a storefront, SCR operates on a $5.3-million annual budget in its 
multimillion-dollar, two-theater complex in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
SCR has shown its commitment to minorities in ways that its board composition 
does not indicate. It sponsors the nationally recognized Hispanic Playwrights 
Project, which showcases budding authors. All told, it spends $500,000 on 
community outreach, some of which benefits the minority community. 
</P>
<P>
SCR leaders say it is hard to find people in the minority community with an 
avid interest in regional theater. But in reducing SCR's state grant, one 
member of the Arts Council contrasted SCR with the Newport Harbor Art Museum, 
which has five minority members on its 28-person board, drawn from the same 
community as SCR. South Coast Repertory takes its role in the community 
seriously. It can show its commitment even more with an ethnically balanced 
board.

SEGOTA SCORES THREE GOALS, LIFTS SOCKERS

Branko Segota was about as much of a pest for the Dallas Sidekicks Sunday night 
as Tatu was for the Sockers two weeks ago in Dallas. Not quite, but almost. 
</P>
<P>
Segota scored three goals to lead the Sockers (2-2) to a 6-2 victory over the 
Sidekicks (3-1) in front of 6,772 at the San Diego Sports Arena. Then he sat in 
the locker room and showed his seventh championship ring to a bunch of 
reporters. The ring was presented in a halftime ceremony honoring the Sockers' 
latest Major Indoor Soccer League conquest, over Baltimore this past June. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, the topic of discussion turned to his hat trick. And, of course, he 
was asked if it meant something special to him after Tatu had done such a 
number on the Sockers in Dallas two weeks ago, scoring five goals in a 9-3 
Sidekick victory in the season opener. Tatu scored just once Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I don't worry about statistics," Segota said. "Scoring means nothing if 
you don't win (a championship ring). He's got one, and I have seven." 
</P>
<P>
In the visitors' locker room, Tatu explained that the Sidekicks were tired 
following their 5-4 overtime victory Saturday night over Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight, I couldn't get my rhythm going," Tatu said. "Some nights it works 
well. Tonight, I couldn't get involved." 
</P>
<P>
Segota's third goal, with 8:19 remaining in the third quarter, gave the Sockers 
a 4-2 lead and the cushion they needed to win easily. They added subsequent 
goals by rookie midfielder Rod Castro and defender Cacho. 
</P>
<P>
Socker Coach Ron Newman has been waiting for Segota to have a game like this 
since the beginning of the season. Segota had scored just two goals entering 
Sunday's game, but Newman said he has been sharp in practice. 
</P>
<P>
"He's looked absolutely incredible," Newman said. "And he's never managed to do 
it on the field. This will do his confidence a world of good." 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, I think Branko feels if he doesn't contribute every time, he's not 
doing his job. He's part of a team. I think he'll really start taking off now." 
</P>
<P>
If his confidence isn't boosted, midfielder Brian Quinn may have given his ego 
a lift by shouting repeatedly after the game' "Branko knows soccer." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego hasn't been the friendliest place for the Sidekicks, who have managed 
to win just one regular-season game in 13 tries in the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"We made some mistakes," Tatu said. "When you're tired, that happens." 
</P>
<P>
That the Sockers led just 3-2 at halftime was thanks largely to defender Mike 
Powers, who spent almost as much time saving goals as goalie Krys Sobieski. 
Early in the first quarter, Powers deflected successive shots from midfielder 
Brian Quinn and forward Zoran Karic when Sobieski was pulled out of position by 
the Sockers' attack. Powers did it again midway through the second quarter, 
blocking a close-range shot by Castro. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers scored their first two goals in similar fashion. First, Segota took 
a corner kick from veteran Steve Zungul with 9:06 remaining in the first 
quarter and sent it whistling by Sobieski with the outside of his right foot. 
Then, after Sidekick defender Doc Lawson scored off an assist from Mark Karpun, 
Segota scored again, taking another corner kick from Zungul to give the Sockers 
a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Tatu's only goal came with 1:30 remaining in the half. He ran on from the bench 
to take a pass from midfielder Kevin Smith, raced by an out-of-position Sockers 
defense and sent the ball into the left corner, his eighth goal of the season. 
Sidekicks 2, Sockers 2. 
</P>
<P>
From then on, the Sockers played as if they remembered vividly the drubbing 
they took in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Newman said he assigned defender George Fernandez to mark Tatu and keep him 
away from the Socker goal. Fernandez met the challenge. Tatu's goal came when 
Fernandez was on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"He made me look silly (in Dallas)," Fernandez said. "I wanted Tatu. I wanted 
to take the best forward and mark him. It proves to me where I'm at in the 
league." 
</P>
<P>
Said Newman: "It's a challenge. I thought I'd give him that special challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the biggest question is whether the Sockers have turned themselves around 
from a rocky start, or whether they are headed for another season of digging 
themselves from the depths after the 11th game. One thing is certain, they know 
to prepare diligently for the Sidekicks. 
</P>
<P>
"We probably treated them with more respect (Sunday) than we did in the 
playoffs last year," Newman said.

CHARGERS SURPRISE RAIDERS; 
</P>
<P>
NFL: FOR THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE WEEK, A TEAM WITH PLAYOFF ASPIRATIONS FINDS THE 
TEAM IN SAN DIEGO HARD TO CONTEND WITH.

Suddenly, it is a brave new world for the Chargers. Blocking punts. Running 
back kickoffs for touchdowns. Overcoming penalties, injuries, fumbles, 
interceptions. And, for the second consecutive week, beating a team that 
figured it was headed for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, it was the Eagles and crusty Coach Buddy Ryan. Sunday night, it was 
the Raiders and their unctuous owner, Al Davis. 
</P>
<P>
At home, on national television and under the pale light of a full moon, the 
Chargers overcame a 12-point deficit and beat the Raiders, 14-12. 
</P>
<P>
"This one," said Raider defensive end Howie Long, "is still kind of a shock." 
</P>
<P>
"With all due respect," said Charger strong safety Martin Bayless. "the 
Chargers were the better team." 
</P>
<P>
Bayless had been audacious enough to predict the Chargers would win last week. 
But his head coach, Dan Henning, wasn't so sure in the first half when he lost 
his deep snapper with a knee injury and his place-kicker with a rib injury. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, Henning recalled what the father of Giant Coach Bill Parcells 
used to say when Henning and Parcells were young coaches together at Florida 
State. "It's always darkest," the elder Parcells would say, "before it gets to 
be pitch black." 
</P>
<P>
It got even worse early in the final period. Trailing by five points, the 
Chargers had driven to the Raider 11 following former Raider Sam Seale's 
interception of a Jay Schroeder pass. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Tim Spencer turned the right end, broke several tackles and 
fumbled. At the one-foot line. Raider strong safety Mike Harden forced the 
fumble and recovered it. But the Chargers, who lost four consecutive games 
earlier this year when they could have won or tied on their last possession, 
were wholly uncowed. 
</P>
<P>
Three plays after Spencer's turnover, the Charger defense that hasn't allowed 
more than 20 points in any of the past eight games stiffened again. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Woodard, acting on a tip from Joe Madden, the special teams coach, burst 
past Raider long-snapper Trey Junkin and partially blocked Jeff Gossett's punt. 
</P>
<P>
Woodard said Madden had told him that once Junkin puts his head down to snap 
the ball, he never brings it back up. Woodard said Junkin never saw him 
standing over him and that he came clean on the block. 
</P>
<P>
It gave the Chargers the ball back on the Raider 23. And the Chargers went 
right back to Spencer. "I never thought of taking him out," Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jim McMahon, who finished with nine completions in 20 attempts for 
88 yards, dumped a swing pass to Spencer for eight. Then Spencer tried left 
tackle for four. Then he burst up the middle for six to set up second and goal 
at the five. 
</P>
<P>
When McMahon saw the Raider defense overshifted in response to the Chargers' 
unbalanced line, he audibled to a play called "40-gut." Right guard David 
Richards cleared the way inside for Spencer to come off his right hip. Right 
tackle Brett Miller wedged Long outside so Spencer could cut inside his left 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
This time Spencer held onto the ball. There were eight minutes and 38 seconds 
remaining. But the Chargers were also able to hold onto the lead. They are now 
4-6. The Raiders, who had won four of their past five, dropped to 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to look at the film and try to stop that in the future," said 
Raider defensive end Scott Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Too late. 
</P>
<P>
"The Raiders prided themselves on a new era," Bayless said. "Today was the 
Charger era." 
</P>
<P>
It just took a while to find it. 
</P>
<P>
Early on, the Chargers showed why their offense ranked 26th in the league after 
nine weeks. On their first two plays from scrimmage, penalties set them back 
four yards and two yards to their own two. Then McMahon threw three consecutive 
incomplete passes. 
</P>
<P>
The next time they got the ball, the Chargers committed two more penalties 
before Hank Ilesic had to punt again. 
</P>
<P>
Yet another penalty, delay of game, nullified a 25-yard Chris Bahr field goal. 
After moving back five yards, things got worse for the Chargers. Rookie center 
Courtney Hall snapped the ball over holder David Archer's head. Bahr retrieved 
the ball at the 41 but got clobbered by Raider Dan Land and had to leave the 
game on a golf cart with what was later described as "sprained" ribs. 
</P>
<P>
Hall was in the game because regular snapper Chris Gannon had left earlier in 
the first period with a bruised right knee. McMahon finished the first half 
with five completions in 13 attempts for 27 yards. The Chargers' total offense 
in the first two periods was 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Raider kicker Jeff Jaeger converted from 23, 36, 33 and 32 yards to 
give the Raiders a 12-0 lead. After his fourth three-pointer, the Chargers' 
biggest crowd of the year (59,151) finally got what it had come to see. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Miller took Jaeger's kickoff at the eight, cut right off a Woodard 
block on Zeph Lee and sprinted up the right sideline for 91 yards and a 
touchdown. It was the second kickoff return for a touchdown in Miller's 
two-year NFL career. And it was the first time any Charger had ever scored more 
than once on a kickoff return. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the Chargers had announced Bahr would not return, he did -- 
converting the extra point following Miller's score. The Chargers' backup, if 
Bahr had not been able to come back, would have either been Ilesic or outside 
linebacker Billy Ray Smith, whose last kick of any import was a 17-yarder in a 
1985 preseason game. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an easy job," Smith said after that kick. "Maybe I can do it when I get 
older." Maybe we'll never have to know. 
</P>
<P>
Almost lost in all the post-game analyses were the game-high 103 yards Raider 
running back Bo Jackson gained on 21 rushes. Jackson's longest run was 20 
yards, and he didn't score." 
</P>
<P>
"Bo don't know the end zone," the Chargers chanted in the locker room after the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
"Our strategy was to gang tackle him and not let him get his shoulders turned 
upfield," said Charger free safety Vencie Glenn. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, like Long, wasn't quite sure what to say. Ask to explain his feelings 
after the game, Bo peeped, "I really don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Said Long: "You say to yourself, 'We should have won.' But we don't have any 
excuses." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
CHARGER NOTES: Charger running back Tim Spencer, who didn't carry the ball 
until late in the third period, led all Charger running backs with 59 yards on 
10 carries. Marion Butts gained 56 yards on 11 tries. . . . Raider quarterback 
Jay Schroeder played the whole game and completed 12 of 25 for 173 yards. . . . 
Each team had three sacks. The Chargers also had three interceptions. . . .

SPENCER NEEDN'T WAIT FOR REDEMPTION;

<P>
CHARGERS: HE BARELY HAD TIME TO BROOD OVER HIS CRITICAL FUMBLE BEFORE COMING 
BACK INTO THE GAME TO SCORE THE WINNING TOUCHDOWN.

<P>
Tim Spencer was sure that he had felt worse before on the football field, but 
at that particular moment Sunday night, he really couldn't recall any others. 
</P>
<P>
Not at Ohio State. Not while playing at Chicago, Arizona or Memphis of the 
United States Football League. Not during his 4 1/2-year career for the 
Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, I was down, real down," he said. "It was one of the most helpless 
feelings I've ever had. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer had just run 11 yards toward the end zone, bouncing off defenders and 
breaking tackles. And just when he stuck his arm out to put the ball over the 
goal line, looking toward the referee to watch him throw his hands up in the 
air, wouldn't you know that someone would come in and spoil the fun. Raider 
safety Mike Harden slapped the ball away from Spencer and then recovered the 
fumble at the one-foot line. 
</P>
<P>
Goodby touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Goodby Charger lead. 
</P>
<P>
Goodby Spencer? 
</P>
<P>
The crowd became silent. Spencer trudged off to the bench. And one by one, his 
teammates came over to console him. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could," Spencer said, "I would have crawled under the bench and hid." 
</P>
<P>
Who could blame him? Here was a guy who had been standing on the sideline the 
entire game until Charger Coach Dan Henning finally called upon him to enter 
the game with just one minute 20 seconds left in the third quarter. And when he 
comes in, what does he do but cough up the ball? 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, this was a game that was being televised nationally. So 
when Spencer fumbles and looks like a man who had just lost his winning lottery 
ticket, guess where the sideline camera focused. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't the time you want to be smiling in front of the camera and be saying, 
"Hi, Mom." 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the worst," Spencer said. "I thought once I fumbled, I'd be sitting 
on this bench the rest of the season." 
</P>
<P>
Well, a funny thing happened. Not only did the Chargers stop the Raiders from 
obtaining a first down, but on fourth down, Ken Woodard blew through the line 
and blocked Jeff Gossett's punt. 
</P>
<P>
Chargers' ball on the Raider 23. 
</P>
<P>
And then came the shocker. 
</P>
<P>
"Spencer, you're back in there." 
</P>
<P>
"Once I heard that," Spencer said, "I said to myself, 'Well, friend, it's now 
or never. Here's your opportunity.' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Don't mess up.' " 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jim McMahon, not about to let Spencer dwell another moment on his 
blunder, went to him on the first play: eight yards on a screen pass. 
</P>
<P>
Second and two from the 15: Spencer over left tackle for a four-yard gain and a 
first down. 
</P>
<P>
First and 10 from the 11: Spencer up the middle for six yards. 
</P>
<P>
Second down from the five: Spencer up the middle, into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Chargers 14, Raiders 12. 
</P>
<P>
Eight minutes 48 seconds were still remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders drove to the Charger 41, but after a holding penalty and a sack, 
they were forced to punt with 4:21 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"When we went back on offense," guard David Richards said, "We knew it was the 
biggest offensive series of the season. We had to run out the clock. We didn't 
want to make the defense go back out there." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers got a first down on Anthony Allen's 11-yard catch on third and six 
but needed one more first down to prevent the need for another punt. 
</P>
<P>
Well, you know the Chargers. Just when the sellout crowd was smelling victory 
over their hated rivals, a holding penalty pushed the ball back to their own 
25. They needed 20 yards for a first down, and the Raiders still had a timeout 
and the two-minute warning left to stop the clock. 
</P>
<P>
It was Spencer for three yards. It was Spencer again for 11. Now, on third and 
six at their own 39 with two minutes left, the Chargers had a decision to make. 
</P>
<P>
They could risk a pass, but an incompletion would stop the clock. They could 
play it safe and keep the ball on the ground, but if they were short, they'd 
have to punt. 
</P>
<P>
And considering that regular long-snapper Chris Gannon had left the game in the 
first quarter with a bruised right knee and that backup Courtney Hall had 
already had botched one snap and almost another, it hardly was a comforting 
feeling. 
</P>
<P>
"When it's third and six and the coach calls for a rush up the middle," 
Richards said, "he's saying to the line, 'Redeem yourself.' " 
</P>
<P>
So if the offensive line was getting that impression with the play call, you 
can just imagine what was going through Spencer's mind when it was called for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was saying this was the biggest play of the year," Spencer said, "and 
I was going to do everything in my power to make it work. 
</P>
<P>
Spencer took the handoff from McMahon, bounced off a couple of defenders and 
bullied his way nine yards to the 48. 
</P>
<P>
He looked across the field at the down marker, saw that he was three yards past 
the first-down mark, and his face broke into an expansive grin. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," he said, "I didn't know a first down could feel so good."

<P>
A look back: The Trojans have reached one preseason goal, a third straight Rose 
Bowl berth, but they may have missed another by just five points. Their two 
losses (14-13 to Illinois in their opener and 28-24 to Notre Dame) have cost 
them a shot at a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
That was on the mind of defensive lineman Tim Ryan Saturday, amid the joy of 
the victorious USC locker room in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have won the Illinois game," he said, "but if you're going to lose, 
it might as well be the first one. I've thought about the fact we wound up just 
five points away. It's not the first time I've just missed a championship. It's 
part of the sport. It hurts, but you've got to go on." 
</P>
<P>
A look ahead: With Gatorade residue still sticking to his hair from Saturday's 
postgame celebration, Trojan Coach Larry Smith threw out the first cliches for 
this week's USC-UCLA game. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always a big game," he said. "A super game. In this one, your previous 
accomplishments go out the window and you just play like heck." 
</P>
<P>
Playing hurt: Arizona's top rusher Saturday was fullback Mario Hampton, who 
gained 62 yards in only nine carries despite a broken hand. STEVE SPRINGER

Fontana High School, The Times' top-ranked team, was seeded first in the 
Southern Section Division I football playoff pairings, which were announced 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers (10-0), the Citrus Belt League champions, will play host to 
Fountain Valley, the defending Division I champion, Friday in the first round. 
There were 16 teams selected in each division, and the finals are scheduled 
Dec. 8-9. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley, which finished fourth in the Sunset League, qualified when 
Huntington Beach, the Sunset League champion, had to forfeit its eight 
victories because it used an ineligible player. Because of the forfeits, 
Fountain Valley qualified as the league's third-place team with a 3-2 league 
record and a 5-5 overall mark. 
</P>
<P>
The other seeded Division I teams are Long Beach Poly of the Moore League, 
Loyola of the Del Rey League and La Puente Bishop Amat of the Angelus League. 
</P>
<P>
In Division III, Capistrano Valley of the South Coast League, is the top-seeded 
team with a 10-0 record. The other seeded teams are El Toro, the runner-up in 
the South Coast League, Los Alamitos of the Empire League and Paramount, the 
San Gabriel Valley League and defending Division III champion. 
</P>
<P>
In a controversial decision, Dana Hills of the South Coast League received an 
at-large bid instead of Lynwood of the San Gabriel Valley League. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills finished the regular season with a 7-3 record but lost three of its 
last five games. Lynwood (5-5) won four of its last five games. Lynwood, which 
played its early-season schedule without quarterback Charles Levy, has lost 
only to Bishop Amat, 28-21, since Oct. 6. 
</P>

BROWN BESS LOOKS IMPRESSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Jack Kaenel was as prepared as a Boy Scout. 
</P>
<P>
Kaenel, 24, bought a new black cowboy hat and a new pair of boots, then went 
out Sunday and rode Brown Bess to a 1 3/4-length victory in the $400,000 Yellow 
Ribbon at Santa Anita, a performance that should clinch an Eclipse Award. 
</P>
<P>
The hat and the boots were for show, as was Kaenel's whip all the way around in 
the 1 1/4-mile race. What worked for Chris McCarron in the Breeders' Cup 
Classic with Sunday Silence worked for Kaenel, who can remember using the whip 
only a few times in Brown Bess' races. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Brown Bess was timed in 1:57 3/5, breaking the Yellow Ribbon record 
by a second and missing by only a fifth of a second the world record set by 
Double Discount at Santa Anita in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
By beating Claire Marine, the 2-1 favorite in the Yellow Ribbon and before 
Sunday the favorite to win the Eclipse Award for best female grass horse, Brown 
Bess is likely to win the division championship. Her breeder and owner, Suzanne 
Pashayan of Fresno, says she won't campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I campaign for my brother (U.S. Congressman Chip Pashayan), but I won't do 
that for this horse," Pashayan said. "I just hope the voters vote without 
prejudice." 
</P>
<P>
Brown Bess' 1989 campaign began in April, after three nondescript starts on 
dirt. In her first race on grass since the previous November, the 7-year-old 
daughter of Petrone and Chickadee won a minor stake at Golden Gate Fields. She 
has been undefeated against females since. The five grass victories in six 
starts have come at four tracks -- Golden Gate, Del Mar, Bay Meadows and now 
Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Darby's Daughter finished second in front of 31,300, beating Colorado Dancer, 
the French filly making her first U.S. start, by a half-length. It was another 
two lengths to Nikishka, who nosed out Claire Marine for fourth place. 
</P>
<P>
Claire Marine had won five out of her last six starts before a fourth-place 
finish in the Las Palmas Handicap three weeks ago. The Eclipse voters -- about 
200 turf writers, Daily Racing Form staffers and track racing secretaries -- 
weigh heavily what horses do at the end of the year, which will help Brown 
Bess, the first California-bred and the oldest horse to win the Yellow Ribbon. 
</P>
<P>
The $240,000 first-place purse put Brown Bess over the $1-million mark in 
earnings. She had ligament trouble when she was younger and the Yellow Ribbon 
was only her 30th start, 18 in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
Brown Bess paid $10.20, $6 and $4. At Bay Meadows, where her home-track 
followers bet with vigor, Brown Bess paid only $5.40 to win. The rest of the 
Santa Anita payoffs were $19.80 and $9.80 for Darby's Daughter, who went off at 
31-1, and $4.60 on Colorado Dancer. 
</P>
<P>
Brown Bess ran in sixth place going down the backstretch, but not more than 
three or four lengths off the lead. Miss Unnameable was the quickest out of the 
gate, dropping out early in the face of fast fractions, with Nikishka, the 
winner of the Las Palmas, and Claire Marine dominating. 
</P>
<P>
Going into the far turn, while Claire Marine and McCarron tried cutting into 
Nikishka's short lead, Brown Bess split horses and began gaining on both on the 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the difference in this mare," Kaenel said. "She used to have to be in 
the clear before she'd run for you. Now all you have to do is point her nose 
and she'll find the hole. And you don't need to whip her, because she's always 
giving it all she's got." 
</P>
<P>
By the head of the stretch, the hole Brown Bess found had closed and she moved 
to the outside, finding Nikishka easy to pass. She took the lead just inside 
the eighth pole, and the only suspense was waiting for the final time on the 
tote board. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Whittingham will win enough Eclipse Awards -- Sunday Silence is assured 
of two, including horse of the year, and Whittingham may also get the trophy 
for best trainer -- but a victory by Claire Marine would have given him one 
more. 
</P>
<P>
"The post position (the inside in an 11-horse field) didn't help," Whittingham 
said. "When you're No. 1, the jockey can't take back too much. But winning the 
Eclipse is not like winning $1 million. None of the horses on the pace got 
anything today." 
</P>
<P>
McCarron was content with his early position. 
</P>
<P>
"She laid perfect," he said. "She moved up comfortably, fired and just couldn't 
keep going. She ran out of steam." 
</P>
<P>
Brown Bess is trained by Chuck Jenda of Bay Area, who had never won a major 
race until his mare captured the Ramona Handicap at Del Mar in August. 
</P>
<P>
"She had been working for this race like she was a 2-year-old,," Jenda said. 
"She's a happy camper now. It's a rarity that a horse this age would suddenly 
do things that she wouldn't do before. Maybe it's experience." 
</P>
<P>
Kaenel says it is Jenda. 
</P>
<P>
"They say horses make jockeys and trainers, but Chuck has made this horse," 
Kaenel said. "She's had problems, but Chuck hasn't run her into the ground. You 
can tell that by the few number of races she's had." 
</P>
<P>
This was Kaenel's biggest victory since, at 16, he outrode Bill Shoemaker on 
Linkage to win the 1982 Preakness with Aloma's Ruler, becoming the youngest 
jockey to win that Triple Crown race. When Kaenel rode Aloma's Ruler into the 
winner's circle at Pimlico, his valet threw him his cowboy hat for the picture. 
</P>
<P>
Kaenel fell under a horse in mid-June, suffering a compound fracture of his 
right leg that caused him to miss one of Brown Bess' races. He got a doctor's 
approval to ride in the Ramona, convincing Jenda that he had recovered by 
handling the mare in a couple of workouts. 
</P>
<P>
After Brown Bess won by a neck, Kaenel went back to the hospital, to have a 
screw removed from his hip. He didn't resume riding until 2 1/2 weeks later. 
Sore hip or not, Brown Bess was at Del Mar for a major race and for Kaenel that 
added up to a command performance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The former record for the Yellow Ribbon was Queen To Conquer's 1:58 3/5 
clocking in 1981. . . . Brown Bess is named after the late Bessie Jenkins, who 
was a housekeeper for Suzanne Pashayan's family. . . . Brown Bess is not 
expected to be retired, and might even make another local appearance this year, 
in the Matriarch at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Oak Tree season closes today with a card that includes the Burke Handicap. 
One of the favorites in Alwuhush, a European horse whose only U.S. start was a 
third in the Man o' War at Belmont Park on Sept. 23. . . . Hollywood Park opens 
Wednesday and the Hollywood Derby will be run next Sunday.

PONTY OVERCOMES VIOLIN'S LIMITS -- BUT NOT THOSE OF HIS REPERTOIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The violin seems an unlikely instrument to front a fusion band. The 
amplification required to put it on equal sonic footing with electric guitars, 
keyboards and tightly miked drum kits causes a loss of the instrument's 
characteristic woody timbres and dynamic range. In short, wiring a violin cuts 
into its expressive capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Electric violinist Jean-Luc Ponty largely overcame these challenges Friday, 
playing a bright-blue instrument in front of an enthusiastic crowd at the 
Celebrity Theatre of Anaheim. In a program that matched originals dating back 
into the '70s with a fair sampling of material from his recently released 
"Storytelling," Ponty painted cool landscapes with deft phrasing, gliding 
portamento effects and the occasional electronic gimmickry while his supporting 
quartet cruised behind. 
</P>
<P>
But that does not mean the evening was without problems. No matter which Ponty 
period it came from, the music showed little diversity over the course of this 
long performance. As the tales unfolded one after another, it became apparent 
that the emphasis was on setting rather than plot. Too many of the numbers 
washed back and forth between chords, recalling such moody seascapes as 
Debussy's "La Mer" and Rachmaninoff's "Isle of the Dead." 
</P>
<P>
Others featured Ponty scaling his way over predictable riffs to high-pitched 
vistas where, like the bear who went over the mountain, he discovered nothing 
more than the other side. 
</P>
<P>
The performance's effect was much like that from a drive across the prairie 
states. Initially, one is impressed with the distance to the horizon and the 
vast blue sky. But then a certain boredom sets in as the unchanging scenery 
stretches on and on. 
</P>
<P>
This does not mean that Ponty has embraced the mellow moods and blind optimism 
of the New Age. Though the chord changes in his music may be as infrequent, the 
general mood was more involved, with frenzied string solos sailing over 
minor-key riffs. This was music with a big beat, thanks to drummer Rayford 
Griffin, with Ponty's own lyrical ways as the romantic focus of interest. 
</P>
<P>
The most interesting compositions heard on this evening were the most recent. 
"In the Fast Lane" used electronic gloss and hard-driving timekeeping from 
Griffin to provide Ponty with a chance to show speed as well as sensitivity. 
"After the Storm," with Ponty taking a turn on keyboards, featured a furious 
introduction before guitarist Jamie Glaser's screaming solo. 
</P>
<P>
The band, whose members can all be heard on "Storytelling," was generally 
competent, if not as tight as heard on the recording. Bassist Baron Browne 
showed plenty of muscle, but lacked crispness. Glaser adeptly provided rhythmic 
chordal backing while his sound carried a head-shaking metallic glint. Wally 
Minko's keyboard support was on the money, and his solos showed a lot of 
harmonic smarts. But, ironically, his acoustic excursions lost a lot of impact 
because of poor reproduction, the piano sounding tinny and distant during a 
moving duet between himself and Ponty entitled "Eulogy for Oscar Romero." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Ponty constructed beautifully melodic solos without becoming 
indulgent. It is obvious that he has the skills to convey high drama on the 
violin, even if the volume levels required for this type of music cut into the 
instrument's expressiveness. With more varied material, Ponty could be leading 
one of the better electric jazz bands around.

EXPOSE AT UNIVERSAL: YOUNG GIRLS IN LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By CONNIE JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Expose put on an hour-plus, no-frills show on Friday at the two-thirds full 
Universal Amphitheatre. No fancy backdrops, no smoke bombs or lasers. The only 
attention-getting device the Miami-based trio utilized was skin-tight stage 
wear that almost diverted attention from the lightweight nature of their 
teen-dream songs. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Curless, Gioia and Jeanette Jurado sport better-than-average voices, but 
there aren't many tunes or arrangements in their repertoire that fully 
capitalize on them. So all the audience had to focus on was the group's 
tough-girl attractiveness, and dance steps that occasionally bordered on the 
ambitious, street-savvy maneuvers of the Paula Abdul School. 
</P>
<P>
That seemed to be worth the ticket price for the group's fans, who were 
predominantly young and Latino on Friday. Long on down-to-earth charm, Expose 
sang their hits with young-girls-in-love conviction and pointed out their 
family members, who filled a good portion of the orchestra seats. Expose has 
racked up several hits in the last couple of years, but the best and most 
distinctive songs are still the early ones: the wistful, gently harmonic 
"Seasons Change" and the dance-oriented "Let Me Be the One," both of which 
Curless delivered with real verve. 
</P>
<P>
The group was scheduled to play Anaheim's Celebrity Theatre on Sunday. CONNIE

NAMIBIAN VOTE PUTS REBELS ON POLITICAL SPOT

WINDHOEK, Namibia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 23 years, the guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's Organization 
fought a bush war to wrest control of Namibia from South African colonizers and 
plant the principles of Karl Marx deeply in the sandy soil of the sparsely 
populated territory. 
</P>
<P>
But today, as SWAPO sits on the verge of realizing its dream in Namibia's first 
free and democratic elections, the rhetoric of war has given way to the 
practicalities of politics. 
</P>
<P>
SWAPO leaders still call each other "comrade," reiterate their devotion to 
socialism and promise a redistribution of wealth from the mostly white 
landholders to the black masses. But, having seen Africa littered with failed 
Marxist policies, they have promised a mixed economy, freedom of speech, no 
mass nationalization and protection for the property of whites who want to 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
"Our policy is to leave the sad history behind us, to adopt a much more 
flexible approach and to write our future on a clean sheet of paper," says 
SWAPO President Sam Nujoma, the bearded leader who has spent half his 60 years 
in exile. His efforts will be watched closely in neighboring South Africa, 
especially by whites who fear that a black government in Pretoria would usher 
in communism and force them out. 
</P>
<P>
SWAPO is heavily favored to win at least a majority in the five-day Namibian 
elections, which ended Saturday. Initial results are expected to be announced 
late today. Ten political parties have been vying for power in the 
U.N.-supervised elections, and SWAPO needs a two-thirds majority to control the 
72-seat constituent assembly and write a new constitution for Namibia. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows for sure what SWAPO will do with the new power. Although Nujoma's 
chief aides hold advanced degrees in political science from American and 
European universities, they have no practical experience in government. Until 
last June, in fact, SWAPO was only a liberation movement with a dream. Now it 
is a political party with a constituency to keep happy and, perhaps soon, a 
country to run. 
</P>
<P>
The Marxist principles to which SWAPO held fast for so long have been dated by 
recent ideological changes in the Soviet Union. And today, African countries 
founded on Marxist principles, from Angola to Mozambique and Ghana to Tanzania, 
are embracing free-market solutions to their economic troubles. 
</P>
<P>
This may be the first and last multi-party election in Namibia. SWAPO has long 
favored a one-party state, believing that the Western model of multi-party 
democracy does not work in developing African countries. But Nujoma also has 
said he would consult with all other parties in mapping the country's future. 
</P>
<P>
"If SWAPO doesn't turn us into a Communist nation, we'll be OK," said Anton 
Ferreira, a white Namibian who waited in line more than six hours to vote on 
the first of five days of balloting last week. 
</P>
<P>
A white woman standing nearby added: "If SWAPO wins, people are going to get 
used to standing in lines like this." 
</P>
<P>
Despite its talk of unity and conciliation, SWAPO's history of planting land 
mines on white farmers' land and allegations that it tortured black Namibians 
believed to be spies has made many here wary. 
</P>
<P>
SWAPO's foreign affairs chief, Theo-Ben Gurirab, says the organization 
regretted the torture. But others, including Nujoma himself, have not been 
penitent. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not regretting anything," Nujoma said as voters went to the polls. "We 
lost hundreds of our comrades in the war because of information those traitors 
supplied to South African troops. Do you think we were stupid enough to let 
them carry on?" 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, SWAPO now says it wants to establish a bill of human rights for 
Namibia. And Nujoma says the fighters of his People's Liberation Army, who 
surrendered their arms to return to Namibia for the elections, will form the 
basis of a small national army designed only for defense. 
</P>
<P>
Few of the country's 80,000 whites, who account for less than 10% of the 
population but own 65% of the land, relish the prospect of a SWAPO government. 
But many agree with SWAPO that South Africa has siphoned off much of Namibia's 
wealth over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been exploited by South Africa for 75 years, why not give Sam Nujoma a 
chance," said J. P. D. Blaauw, a retired brigadier in the South African air 
force. Blaauw, who lived in Namibia as a child, flew from South Africa last 
week to vote and said he plans to move here permanently after independence. 
</P>
<P>
SWAPO will face many of the same logistical problems that South Africa has 
faced in trying to administer the territory, which is twice the size of 
California, with a dozen ethnic groups and only 1.3 million people, 60% of them 
illiterate. To help the South African administration stage the first one-man, 
one-vote national elections in the vast, rugged landscape, the United Nations 
had to bring in more than 7,000 peacekeeping troops, police monitors, election 
supervisors and administrative workers. 
</P>
<P>
An independent government in Namibia will have to accept, at least at first, 
its economic links with South Africa, whose government it calls the "apartheid 
colonialists." About 90% of its exports go to South Africa and three-fourths of 
imports, mostly food, come from there. 
</P>
<P>
Its primary port city, Walvis Bay, will remain a South African enclave even 
after independence. 
</P>
<P>
SWAPO has promised over the years to redistribute the country's resources and 
exert more centralized control over the economy. The main target for land 
redistribution is whites, especially foreign absentee landlords. 
</P>
<P>
"There are white farmers here who own up to 20 farms. That is a crime," Hidipo 
Hamutenya, SWAPO's chief spokesman, says. "They will be asked to choose the one 
they like best and give the rest to the people." 
</P>
<P>
But SWAPO leaders also have said that farmers using their land effectively and 
producing food for the country will be left alone. And they say no land will be 
confiscated without negotiation with the owners. 
</P>
<P>
SWAPO is counting on the country's reserve of diamonds, uranium and other 
minerals, which now make up 75% of foreign exchange earnings, to help it 
improve the schools, health care and housing of black Namibians. 
</P>
<P>
Although it once believed in nationalizing the mining industry, SWAPO now says 
it intends to negotiate new contracts with the mining companies. It 
specifically has said that the companies will be required to reinvest "a 
substantial part" of their profits in Namibia. 
</P>
<P>
The mining companies, which currently have a tax rate of 60%, doubt they can 
afford to pay more. But they believe Namibia's mineral potential has been 
largely untapped and that more mining companies will be lured here if trade 
sanctions against Pretoria, which still extend to Namibia, are lifted. 
</P>
<P>
SWAPO's biggest headache, though, may be dealing with the raised expectations 
of the black masses, most of whom are landless and 30% jobless. 
</P>
<P>
"We will educate the people that independence is not a panacea, that they will 
have to work hard and produce," Hage Geingob, SWAPO's election director, 
recently told the South African magazine Leadership. "It would be a serious 
mistake to believe that independence is the time for people to make big claims 
on the state."

BULGARIANS GREET CHANGE WITH CAUTION, SUSPICION;

SOFIA, Bulgaria 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like news traveling from a distant planet, the world-changing events in Eastern 
Europe have finally touched this isolated capital at the mountainous center of 
the Balkan Peninsula, wedged between ancient Macedonia and the Black Sea. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike Berlin, Warsaw and Budapest, where people have exhibited the joy of 
new-found freedom, the Bulgarians in Sofia have reacted to the dramatic changes 
in their Eastern Bloc neighbors -- and even to the recent surprising shift of 
leadership in their own country -- with characteristic caution, suspicion and 
even disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
Some people say the 500 years of brutal Turkish rule here during the Ottoman 
Empire are responsible for the Bulgarians' reluctance to believe in change. 
Others say it is simply not in the Bulgarian nature to be optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"Bulgarians are a passive people," commented a young biochemist Sunday as he 
strolled somberly along the paved lanes of Juzen Park, the main gathering place 
for the small Bulgarian reform movement. "They mistrust what is happening. They 
had been lied to for more than 40 years (by the Communists), and they have no 
reason to think things have changed." 
</P>
<P>
However, Bulgaria, with a population of 9 million mostly ethnic Slavic people, 
joined what might be called the Gorbachev perestroika (restructuring) club with 
a bang Friday during a meeting of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian 
Communist Party in Sofia. 
</P>
<P>
The old Bulgarian war horse, Todor Zhivkov, 78, was out -- removed from 35 
years of unquestioned power -- with only a curt, formal thank you for his 
"long, selfless, service." It was a rude exit for Zhivkov, who once told a 
British journalist that he hoped to live 150 years so that he could continue to 
rule this history-scarred land bordered by Romania, Greece, Yugoslavia and 
Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
His replacement, longtime Foreign Minister Petar Mladenov, 53, opened his reign 
with a speech lauding the virtues of "pluralism in our opinion." Some members 
of the Communist Party now contend that Mladenov engineered Zhivkov's departure 
by threatening to resign from the 12-member Politburo and publish a letter 
deeply critical of Zhivkov and his family. 
</P>
<P>
But anyone, including some perplexed Western diplomats here, who expected 
dancing in the streets or even modest signs of celebration over the end of 35 
years of autocratic rule by Zhivkov was sadly disappointed this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
An Italian diplomat, his senses activated by the prospect of political upheaval 
in dreary Bulgaria, recounted how he kept rushing fruitlessly to the window of 
his apartment on Saturday at the slightest sound, hoping to see street 
demonstrations or some other acknowledgement of the end of the Zhivkov rule. 
Usually, he said, it was only a car backfiring or a dog barking. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have been surprised if there was more of a public reaction," said 
Deyan Kiuranov, 38, a leader of the reform-oriented organization Eco-Glasnost. 
"People in Bulgaria are not used to being involved in party affairs or public 
affairs." 
</P>
<P>
The change in leadership was depicted by the official press as a resignation, 
but most observers feel it was an internal coup d'etat in the Bulgarian 
Communist Party approved in advance by Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"The congratulatory telegram from Moscow was strikingly prompt," smiled 
Kiuranov. 
</P>
<P>
The cautious reaction by the Bulgarian people to the change in leadership is 
also reflected in the equally cautious strategies of the reform movement, which 
is not as broad-based here as it is in Poland or Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition movement only really surfaced last month during an international 
environmental meeting, Eco-Forum '89, held in Sofia and attended by 35 
countries, including representatives of the United States, Canada and France. 
</P>
<P>
At a park near the center of Sofia, the Bulgarian group calling itself 
Eco-Glasnost set up a protest table. Ostensibly, the table was an effort to 
gather signatures on a petition opposing the rerouting of two Bulgarian rivers, 
the Rila and Mesta, by government engineers. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, most people agree that it was an effort to confront the government 
using the international environmental forum as a protective shield in this 
country, which has a poor history handling dissent. 
</P>
<P>
City officials first asked Eco-Glasnost to move its table to Juzen (South) 
Park, which has a reputation as a political tolerance zone. When organizers 
refused on technical grounds, saying that they had not received a formal order 
asking them to leave, Sofia police moved in, beating and arresting between 22 
and 30 people. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests and beatings angered delegates to the international environmental 
conference being held at the Peoples House of Culture convention center. 
Official protests were lodged by 14 countries, including the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Facing potential international embarrassment, the government backed down, 
permitting a series of legal rallies by Eco-Glasnost and another reform group, 
the Club for the Support of Perestroika and Glasnost. The club is named for the 
reform policies of Soviet leader Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, on Nov. 3, Eco-Glasnost led a rally in the city that attracted between 
5,000 and 9,000 protesters. The protesters chanted slogans calling for reforms 
and democracy in Bulgaria. This time the police did not move in. Although the 
rally lasted only 15 minutes, opposition leaders considered it the biggest 
challenge to authority here in more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
The same cautious approach can be seen in the way the opposition groups are 
organizing to confront the new Mladenov regime.

GERMANS OPEN WALL CROSSING AT HISTORIC HUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WEST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The East German government Sunday opened a new border crossing through the 
Berlin Wall at the historic Potsdamer Platz as the flood of thousands of East 
Germans flowed back and forth across the barrier. 
</P>
<P>
The mayors of East and West Berlin clasped hands at a ceremony before thousands 
of cheering Berliners, celebrating the fifth and latest opening in the wall. 
Potsdamer Platz was once the hub of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
In another concession to reformers, East German leader Egon Krenz urged the 
Communist Party Central Committee, meeting today, to approve a major party 
congress next month to set new policies. 
</P>
<P>
At Potsdamer Platz, once the busiest intersection in Germany but now a razed 
space, West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper met Mayor Erhard Krack as a section of 
the wall -- the demarcation line of the division of Europe -- was broken 
through. 
</P>
<P>
"This is where the old heart of Berlin used to beat," Momper declared. "And it 
will beat again." 
</P>
<P>
Later, West German President Richard von Weizsaecker, a former West Berlin 
mayor, showed up to chat with East German border guards. He appeared at the 
15-yard opening after a church service, where he declared that "the wall is 
finished as a symbol of inhumanity." 
</P>
<P>
But he added: "No one should allow himself or others to have any feeling of 
triumph over anyone else. Now we must stand together." 
</P>
<P>
East German officials said Sunday that the total number of visas issued to its 
citizens is now 4.3 million -- or about a fourth of its population -- since 
travel restrictions were lifted. However, West German authorities said only 
23,000 newcomers have asked to stay. 
</P>
<P>
West German leaders have been encouraging East Germans to remain at home, and 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has pressed Communist leaders to enact reforms to 
persuade their citizens to stay. 
</P>
<P>
West German authorities reported that many East German refugees are 
contemplating returning home -- now that travel restrictions are lifted. 
</P>
<P>
They said that counselors at four receiving centers will be available to advise 
those who are thinking of going back. Those considering returning, sources 
said, are worried about whether they would still find their old jobs and 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
By opening the wall, East Germany's Krenz for the moment appeared to have won a 
gamble. 
</P>
<P>
However, by calling for a Communist Party congress, the supreme authority in 
East Germany, he risks having the entire Central Committee voted out and might 
find his own job in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
This is because the party rank-and-file members and their local leaders have 
been more insistent about major reforms in the country -- and the party -- than 
officials at the top in East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
With speculation about a party purge growing, one West German newspaper said 
three East German Communists, despondent over rapid changes, have committed 
suicide, wire reports said. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Welt am Sonntag identified the three as Herbert Heber, a party 
leader from the Halle area; Gerhard Uhl, a leader from the Dresden area, and 
Helmuth Mieth, a politician from the Schwerin area. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, citing local party sources, attributed the suicides to "mental 
pressures" resulting from the present political situation and the rapid pace of 
change. All three were believed to be hard-line conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
The scene at Potsdamer Platz on Sunday was one of joy and confusion as people 
streamed through in both directions. 
</P>
<P>
The closest East German building is the former Air Ministry of Nazi 
Reichsmarshal Hermann Goering, and nearby is the site of the infamous bunker 
where Adolf Hitler directed the final days of the war and killed himself. The 
ruins of the bunker were long ago bulldozed over so that no physical presence 
would be left. 
</P>
<P>
The East Germans had removed several tall, concrete, graffiti-splashed panels 
from the wall and stacked them just inside their border -- like strange figures 
from Stonehenge. 
</P>
<P>
An East German senior officer said when questioned: "It's been a good feeling 
all morning." An East German police guard standing shoulder-to-shoulder next to 
a West German police officer sported a marigold he received as a gift. 
</P>
<P>
The East Germans wore camouflage uniforms with dark ties underneath, while the 
West Germans donned regular uniforms with tan turtleneck sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
A West German guard remarked: "We've been talking with each other all day. It's 
been very open, surprisingly so. 
</P>
<P>
"I was at the first crossing at Eberswalder Strasse when they opened it up, and 
now I am here today. I have the feeling world history is being made."

DIPLOMACY: GLEN A. HOLDEN, MULTIMILLIONAIRE INSURANCE EXECUTIVE, CAMPAIGN 
CONTRIBUTOR, HORSEMAN AND POLO PLAYER, HAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR APPOINTMENT 
AS AMBASSADOR TO JAMAICA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One Saturday afternoon in March, insurance executive Glen A. Holden came home 
to his Bel-Air mansion to hear his grandson announce, "Hey gramps, the 
President's calling." 
</P>
<P>
In that surprise phone call, President Bush asked his old friend and financial 
supporter to serve as the next ambassador to Jamaica and to play a key role in 
formulating U.S. policy in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
The nomination was by far the highest honor in the career of Holden, a 
self-made multimillionaire who plays polo with such royalty as Prince Charles 
of England and fraternizes with political powerhouses such as Republican Sen. 
Pete Wilson and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Charles Manatt. 
</P>
<P>
Although the garrulous businessman has become a familiar fixture in the 
limousines, board rooms and black-tie events, he is protective of his privacy, 
little known outside the inner circles of the political and social elite. 
</P>
<P>
What is known is that Holden, a life-long political dabbler, has established 
himself as a major campaign contributor and philanthropist. 
</P>
<P>
"I give to a great many things," Holden said. "What may seem like a large 
amount of money to someone is not to another one." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1981, Holden has scattered hundreds of thousands of dollars to more than 
100 candidates and causes -- from a West Covina city council candidate in 
suburban Los Angeles to the Bush presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, Holden is the single largest contributor to the Los Angeles County 
Board of Supervisors. He, his family and his closely held company, the Holden 
Group -- which holds a lucrative county contract -- have donated $117,695 to 
the five supervisors since 1984, according to campaign reports. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, Holden made the Republican National Committee's list of top 
contributors last year, being named to its exclusive "Team 100" by giving at 
least $100,000 to GOP candidates and causes. He is one of only 250 contributors 
in the nation to gain the Team 100 designation. 
</P>
<P>
His contributions, Holden said in an interview, are a way to support those who 
share his belief in the free enterprise system. 
</P>
<P>
"He enjoys the political game," said Ron Smith, a political consultant and 
former deputy to County Supervisor Deane Dana. 
</P>
<P>
Holden, 62, a six-footer with wavy silver hair and deep blue eyes, has the 
looks and manner of a successful politician. According to friends, he is the 
sort who easily works a crowd with a ready smile and firm handshake -- "never 
snooty." He is also a man known to arrive for a polo match by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
He spends his considerable wealth in some disparate ways. On one hand, he has 
contributed more than $600,000 in the past two years to a variety of cultural 
and educational charities, ranging from Pepperdine University to a Hollywood 
day-care center. On the other, he has joined 17 tony social organizations, such 
as the Palm Beach Polo and Country Club and the St. Moritz Tobogganing Club. 
</P>
<P>
Holden -- who divides his time among a Bel-Air mansion, Santa Barbara ranch and 
Palm Desert condo -- said his interest in politics dates back to the 1950s. He 
was finance chairman of the Oregon Republican Party at age 30 and was a 
fraternity brother of Oregon Republican Sens. Mark O. Hatfield and Bob 
Packwood. 
</P>
<P>
Like Ronald Reagan, Holden is a Democrat who turned Republican with a 
vengeance. And in George Bush he found another ally. 
</P>
<P>
The two met, according to Holden, when he was running an insurance company in 
Houston in the early 1970s while Bush was serving as a Texas congressman. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Holden was one of the political insiders who pushed for the inclusion 
of Bush on Reagan's presidential ticket. In fact, Holden says, he and his wife 
shared a limousine with Barbara Bush when they rode to the Republican National 
Convention. 
</P>
<P>
Although he had been a financial backer of Bush, Holden said in a recent 
interview that he was surprised when the president tapped him for the Jamaican 
ambassadorship. Holden said he not sought the $82,500-a-year post, nor any of 
the other 139 ambassadorships. The White House declined to comment on the 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
"He has never even asked for a White House tour," said one Republican 
fund-raiser who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
Holden said that he has traveled throughout the Caribbean, but is not a student 
of Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
Holden -- who still refers to the Peoples Republic of China as "Communist 
China" -- said he believes "Marxism and Communism is going down all over the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
And, he said, he hopes to advance the cause of capitalism in Jamaica, a country 
run by Prime Minister Michael Manley, whom Holden described as once being "very 
leftist, very socialist, if not totally Communist, certainly Marxist." 
</P>
<P>
During the 1980s, Holden said, Manley changed his tune. "In his quest for 
reelection, he reversed himself" and is pursuing free enterprise solutions to 
his country's myriad problems. 
</P>
<P>
"When our President heard that and saw (Manley's) apparent conviction . . . I 
got a call from the White House . . . that the President would like to have 
someone that he knew, that he knew could get results" in assisting the 
transition in Jamaica, Holden said in explaining his nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Holden said he plans to use the embassy for "charitable . . . receptions and 
things" to support educational causes. "They have to develop into other kinds 
of economic and commercial development," Holden said. "People have to be 
trained and cane cutters have to become something else." 
</P>
<P>
Holden's nomination has been confirmed by the Senate and he is scheduled to be 
sworn in later this month. He expects to take his post early in December. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has come under fire from Senate Democrats, particularly Sen. Paul Sarbanes 
(D-Md.), for allegedly appointing an inordinate number of big political 
contributors to ambassadorial posts. Sarbanes has labled some of these nominees 
"unqualified" and sought to block their confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
However, Holden's appointment had bipartisan support, including a lobbying 
campaign orchestrated by former Democratic party chief Manatt, who met Holden a 
decade ago through a mutual interest in the Boy Scouts of America. Manatt also 
is in a partnership with Holden in the ownership of a Westside office building 
that houses Holden's business headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Sarbanes spokesman Bruce Frame indicated that Holden's appointment faced no 
opposition in part because his resume indicates a strong management background 
that "counts for something" in administering an embassy with 300 employees. 
</P>
<P>
While Holden's business experience appears to have helped him win a federal 
appointment, the business that he does with state and local government helped 
make him a wealthy man. 
</P>
<P>
With 4,000 government contracts across the nation, much of the Holden Group's 
business is providing investment and insurance services to public employees, 
including those in Florida, Tennessee and Texas and in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the conservative three-man majority was elected to the Los Angeles 
County Board of Supervisors in 1980, the Holden Group was awarded an exclusive 
contract to administer a $500-million retirement income plan for 50,000 county 
employees. County officials project the company will make $36 million in a 
five-year period from the contract, which was recently extended until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The contract was awarded after a lobbying campaign led by former Democratic 
Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, Holden, his company and his family have contributed extensively to 
the Board of Supervisors' conservative majority. Mike Antonovich has received 
$48,445; Pete Schabarum, $30,750; and Deane Dana, $26,000. But he and his 
company also have contributed $8,000 to liberal Supervisor Kenneth Hahn and 
$4,500 to Supervisor Ed Edelman, the other liberal on the board. 
</P>
<P>
His contributions eclipse those of better known companies and individuals, such 
as the late Howard Hughes' Summa Corp. and real estate developers Nathan 
Shapell and Ray Watt. 
</P>
<P>
Holden said he supports conservative and liberal supervisors alike because 
"that's the best-run government and, by golly, those people ought to be 
supported." 
</P>
<P>
"We do business (with the county), but. . . I've never asked for a favor," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A recent study by the California Commission on Campaign Financing said: "Most 
contributors to Los Angeles County supervisors stated their donations are, in 
the words of one, 'part of the cost of doing business in the county.' " 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum, who has ridden horses with Holden in the Andes, said: "He wants to 
make sure that the Board of Supervisors knows he is an important player in 
providing the services that he does." Schabarum would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Dana said: "I think he likes doing business with us." Dana added that Holden 
has never asked for favors, nor has he received any. Born July 2, 1927, in 
Idaho, Glen Arthur Holden grew up on a ranch near Portland, Ore. He made 
spending money in the Depression through a labor of love -- training horses. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the dozen horses he now keeps are trained by professionals in 
Argentina, Holden maintains his passion for horses through the game of polo, in 
which he has built a national reputation as an amateur. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a high-energy, addictive sport," said Jim Tribbin, manager of the Santa 
Barbara Polo and Racquet Club in Carpinteria. 
</P>
<P>
His passion for polo and his business acumen came together in the late 1970s 
when Holden, according to Tribbin, grabbed the reins of the club after it ran 
into financial problems. He personally guaranteed some of the club's debts and 
helped navigate it back to financial safety, Tribbin said. In appreciation, 
members renamed the grandstand field, Holden Field. 
</P>
<P>
Although daring on the polo field, Holden is a cautious man. His plush office 
in a high-rise on Los Angeles' Westside is under tight security. TV cameras 
monitor visitors coming and going and uniformed guards direct the traffic. 
</P>
<P>
His office suite is decorated with expensive art work -- much of its featuring 
horses -- and includes a tapestry of polo players, which was a gift from the 
Maharajah of Jaipur. 
</P>
<P>
He began selling insurance while studying at the University of Oregon, and he 
married his college sweetheart, Gloria, with whom he raised two daughters and a 
son, Glen Jr. 
</P>
<P>
He went on to build a large and successful insurance agency business based in 
Portland that spread over Oregon, Washington and Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Later he was hired to run an innovative insurance firm, Variable Annuity Life 
Insurance Co., where, Holden said, "I pioneered the whole concept of variable 
annuities and variable life insurance in the United States." Holden moved to 
Los Angeles in 1973 and founded the Holden Group, a closely held company that 
specializes in the "design, marketing and administration of tax-advantaged, 
income-producing plans through annuities, insurance products and real estate." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Holden sold a 59.2% interest in his company to Toronto-based Lonvest 
Corp. for $79 million. 
</P>
<P>
In preparing to leave for Jamaica, Holden is resigning as chairman of the 
Holden Group and plans resign from -- or take an inactive role in -- the many 
civic organizations he serves. 
</P>
<P>
But it is unlikely that Holden will give up his commitment. 
</P>
<P>
"As people get into it, they do more," said Holden explaining the extent of his 
involvement in political and civic causes. 
</P>
<P>
"And it's true, whether it be the Boy Scouts or Pepperdine University or for 
Pete Wilson. . . . I got started pretty early. I was supporting and helping 
political causes and educational institutions the day I got out of the 
university. . . . So I've been at this a long time."

U.S. AID TO E. GERMANY DEPENDS ON REFORM, BAKER SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
EAST BLOC: 'IT WOULD BE WRONG' TO HAVE A DIFFERENT STANDARD THAN FOR POLAND AND 
HUNGARY, HE ASSERTS.

<P>
The Bush Administration would employ a carrot-and-stick approach for any 
economic aid that it might make available to East Germany, with the assistance 
contingent on reforms, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be wrong to have a different standard for East Germany than we do for 
Poland and Hungary," Baker said, referring to U.S. aid packages to those 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the House passed an $837-million package to help reform-minded 
Poland and Hungary -- almost twice what the Bush Administration had proposed. 
</P>
<P>
But the Administration is clearly putting conditions on any U.S. involvement in 
helping East Germany's troubled economy. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be wrong to start funneling economic assistance to any country in 
Eastern Europe, I think, even if we had it to funnel -- and we are somewhat 
constrained in what we can do -- before there is clear evidence that they want 
to reform their economic system," said Baker on ABC-TV's "This Week with David 
Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
"What we have here is a rather significant event in political terms, but it 
doesn't mean a whole lot in economic terms," Baker added. 
</P>
<P>
Both Poland and Hungary have inaugurated significant reforms this year, with 
Poland installing a non-Communist government and Hungary declaring itself a 
multi-party republic. East Germany has promised to hold elections but remains, 
for now, a one-party Communist state. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials also warned Sunday against "premature" speculation 
about the reunification of Germany despite the recent opening of border 
crossings between East and West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"It is premature to jump, to make the great leap -- and it is a big leap -- 
from the right of free travel on the part of East Germans to the question of 
reunification," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many things that have to take place in between. One of those is fair 
and free and even multi-party elections in East Germany. Another is movement 
toward a free economic system, free markets, free enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
Former West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt predicted that German 
reunification might not happen until "the next century." Speaking on NBC-TV's 
"Meet the Press," Schmidt said the primary challenge is to help Eastern 
Europeans establish a functioning economy, or else "the whole process might be 
slithering away." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov, on CBS-TV's "Face the 
Nation," said: "There is not much enthusiasm in other quarters concerning a 
reunited Germany." 
</P>
<P>
Although President Bush has been criticized for reacting too slowly to reforms 
in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, Gerasimov said, "I think he's handling 
it as a real statesman." He also predicted that the United States and the 
Soviet Union "may come to a common ground" at the superpower meeting next month 
in the Mediterranean because "everybody is interested in stability, in not too 
much upheaval in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials continued to urge a strong and cautious approach to 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the Administration would consider economic assistance to the 
Soviet Union, Baker responded that the Soviet Union must work more toward arms 
control and do more to solve regional conflicts. He added that the Soviets 
"won't ask us for American cash. Technical economic advice is what we're 
talking about, not American financial assistance." 
</P>
<P>
Baker said that he had laid down conditions in talks with Soviet officials. "If 
you expect cooperation from us, if you expect us to move from competition 
through dialogue to cooperation, we need to see cooperation in Central America, 
for instance." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, speaking on "Meet the Press," went even further. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to be cautious here. I think it's one thing to encourage the 
Soviet Union to continue its reforms, but we have to remember that the Soviets 
still have thousands of nuclear weapons aimed at the United States; that they 
still occupy Eastern Europe; that, for example, the guerrillas who this morning 
attacked the government of El Salvador in San Salvador are supported by 
Nicaragua and Cuba, and Nicaragua and Cuba are kept alive by an infusion of 
billions of rubles from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as they pursue those policies, I don't think the United States ought 
to be in a position of providing material assistance to the Soviets," Cheney 
said.

Moldavian nationalists called off a demonstration in their capital, Kishinyov, 
after 2,000 more troops were deployed in the city to prevent a repetition of 
Friday's clashes in which 180 people were injured. The city was reported calm 
as police guarded government buildings. Resignation of the republic's hard-line 
Communist leader, Semyon Grossu, is one of the central demands of the local 
Popular Front and other nationalist groups. The Popular Front also is demanding 
more autonomy for the republic, which was created largely out of Romanian 
territory in 1940, as well as the resignation of hard-line local leaders.

PERUVIANS DEFY REBEL THREATS, VOTE FOR MAYORS

<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of Peruvians defied rebel threats and mobbed polling stations to vote 
Sunday in mayoral elections. Maoist guerrillas trying to disrupt the election 
killed a candidate and blew up a church and a school. 
</P>
<P>
Facing hefty fines for failure to go to the polls, voters lined up for blocks 
in front of Lima polling stations. Turnout rose after a slow start in the 
Andean highlands, where the Maoist Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) movement is 
strongest. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the elections a farce, Sendero Luminoso urged Peruvians to boycott the 
elections. Peru has 1,947 municipalities, but election authorities said there 
were no candidates in at least 86 towns due to death threats by the rebels, who 
have killed scores of officials and candidates this year alone. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the guerrillas shot and killed the mayoral candidate of the 
governing center-left American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA) early 
Sunday in Azangaro, near the Bolivian border 470 miles southeast of Lima. 
</P>
<P>
In Huancayo, 140 miles east of Lima, the rebels dynamited a church and a school 
early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The center-right Democratic Front, led by novelist and presidential candidate 
Mario Vargas Llosa, was expected to win the mayoral seats in most cities. But 
in Lima, millionaire television executive Ricardo Belmont, an independent, was 
projected as the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Belmont, 44, has gathered a huge following among Lima residents by blaming 
traditional political parties for the city's crumbling transport and rampant 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
Vargas Llosa said the large turnout in the elections would deal a psychological 
blow to the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
"The big loser in these elections will be terrorism, because the immense 
majority of Peruvians are showing the world that they want to live in freedom 
and peace," Vargas Llosa told reporters.

Jets resumed flying from Dobbins Air Force Base north of Atlanta on Sunday, 
three days after an attack plane crashed into an apartment complex short of the 
runway, killing two people. 
</P>
<P>
Petty Officer Linda Herring said the Navy considered Thursday's crash an 
isolated incident and was not suspending any flight operations. 
</P>
<P>
"If an investigation indicates that changes should be made, we will of course 
make them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation of the crash is expected to take at least 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Naval Air Station Atlanta, next to Dobbins, said earlier that 
pilots were taking a few days off from training flights in the wake of the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot of the A-7E Corsair II, Lt. Cmdr. Robert M. Conlyn Jr., 37, remained 
in critical condition Sunday. Conlyn was the only person aboard the unarmed 
plane and ejected just before it crashed into the apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
Jacquelyn Padovani, 5, who suffered burns over about half of her body, was in 
critical condition. Her pregnant mother, 28-year-old Margie Padovani, died 
Friday night at the hospital from burns, and Richard Dick, 24, died in his 
incinerated apartment.

WORKERS WITH BEST BENEFITS STAND TO LOSE MOST

Richard E. Cecconi retired on March 31, 1986, after 30 years with Republic 
Steel in Warren, Ohio. He was 50, his pension was $2,309 a month and his 
retirement looked secure. 
</P>
<P>
Then Republic's parent, Dallas-based LTV Corp., declared bankruptcy, and the 
federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. took over LTV's underfunded pension 
plans in the biggest pension bailout ever. 
</P>
<P>
Cecconi and thousands of other LTV workers learned what pension rights 
advocates have long warned -- workers with the best pension benefits stand to 
lose the most when the PBGC moves in. Cecconi's pension was cut to $632 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no fairness here," Cecconi said. "I was not an early retiree. I 
worked the full 30 years necessary to qualify for a full pension, and now get 
only 27%." 
</P>
<P>
But without the PBGC, Cecconi and 108,000 other LTV workers and retirees would 
have gotten far less. 
</P>
<P>
"The main purpose of the PBGC was to make sure that people didn't see their 
pensions totally wiped out, and it has been a very definite success," said Alan 
V. Reuther, associate general counsel at the United Auto Workers. "As difficult 
as LTV was, it would have been a complete disaster without the PBGC." 
</P>
<P>
The agency was created by Congress in 1974 as part of a package of 
pension-protection measures known as the Employee Retirement Income Security 
Act. Its mission was similar to that of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., 
which insures bank deposits up to $100,000 per account. 
</P>
<P>
When the PBGC becomes trustee of a pension plan that does not have enough money 
to pay its obligations, the agency pays the pensions up to a certain maximum. 
The ceiling was $750 a month in 1974 and has risen to $2,028 for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The agency guarantees only basic benefits available at age 65 under the company 
plan. Those who retire before 65, such as Cecconi, receive less under a 
formula. For instance, a worker who takes early retirement at 55 will receive 
about half the PBGC maximum. 
</P>
<P>
The agency does not guarantee health and welfare benefits, and pension 
increases granted by the company in the five years before the plan ended are 
reduced according to a formula. 
</P>
<P>
The PBGC insures the pensions of 40 million workers and retirees covered by 
defined-benefit plans, the type promising a specific amount based on age, 
service and salary. Another 36 million workers have defined-contribution plans, 
such as profit-sharing and 401(k) savings plans, which are not insured.

Authorities sought four youths described by police as "big-city gang types" 
after two employees at a check-cashing business in Barstow were shot, one 
fatally, in a robbery attempt. The gunmen approached two women and two children 
shortly after the women had closed the Any Kind Check Cashing office downtown, 
police said. The gunmen demanded money, then shot both women, said Sgt. Wayne 
Ecker. The children were not hurt, and it was not clear whether the four 
assailants escaped with any cash. "We have homicides," Ecker said. "But I can't 
think of anything that was this cold-blooded." Loretta Abeyta-Chabira, 22, was 
declared dead at Barstow Community Hospital after the shooting. The other 
employee, Phyllis Padilla, was listed in critical but stable condition at the 
same hospital.

A human-powered helicopter lifted off the ground in the gym of California State 
Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo, the first such feat in aviation 
history, said students who built the chopper. A bicycle racer pedaled the 
helicopter into the air to the cheers of aeronautic engineering students who 
worked on the project. "There's never been a human-powered helicopter that has 
gotten off the ground," said Neal Saiki, a 23-year-old senior who has worked on 
the project more than two years. The 100-pound copter, known as the Da Vinci 
III, hovered inches above the Mott Gym floor as cyclist Greg McNeil, an 
aeronautical engineering major who races on the U.S. cycling team, pedaled 
furiously. The next step, the students said, will be to fly the helicopter 
again, this time for officials of the American Helicopter Society, who must 
witness the event before it formally becomes a part of aviation history.

<P>
Dolores Gomez Ibarruri, famous as La Pasionaria, the legendary heroine of 
Spain's Civil War, died in a hospital from double pneumonia Sunday night at 93. 
</P>
<P>
La Pasionaria (Passion Flower), a lifelong Communist who remained honorary 
president of the Spanish Communist Party, won fame for galvanizing resistance 
during the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
La Pasionaria's cry of "No pasaran" (They shall not pass) rallied thousands to 
the Republican cause, and she became a symbol of resistance to the dictatorship 
of Gen. Francisco Franco. 
</P>
<P>
"Dolores, this flower of the 20th Century, lives on in the daily activity of 
thousands of men and women in Spain and in the world who aspire to a society 
where life and human beings are regarded as the center of all social and 
political initiative," the party said in a statement after her death. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Juan Beltran, head of the Ramon y Cajal Hospital in Madrid where she died, 
said several members of Ibarruri's family and Communist Party leaders were by 
her side when she died. 
</P>
<P>
Ibarruri fell ill with pneumonia in September but had begun recovering and 
returned home three weeks ago. She was readmitted to the hospital last week 
after suffering a relapse. 
</P>
<P>
A local news agency report quoted party sources as saying Ibarruri's body would 
be embalmed. 
</P>
<P>
Many literary scholars believe that she was the model for Pilar, the energetic 
heroine of Ernest Hemingway's novel of the war, "For Whom the Bell Tolls." 
</P>
<P>
Although her forces were defeated by Franco, she outlived the Spanish dictator 
and ended a 38-year exile in the Soviet Union by returning in triumph in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
In the first democratic elections since Franco set off the bloody three-year 
civil war, she won back the Parliament seat she had held four decades earlier. 
She later gave it up because of her age. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 9, 1985, figures from the international Communist movement -- and from 
Spain's Socialist government -- feted La Pasionaria on her 90th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Born Dec. 9, 1895, into a Roman Catholic mining family in Gallarta in the 
Basque province of Vizcaya, Dolores Ibarruri was the eighth of 11 children. 
</P>
<P>
In her autobiography "The Way," Ibarruri wrote that she had "an unhappy 
childhood and an adolescence without hope" and said the harsh conditions in 
which her family lived turned her into a revolutionary. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew the terrible pain of days without bread and winters without fire." 
</P>
<P>
Her family was too poor to pay for schooling so she abandoned her ambition of 
becoming a teacher. She married Julian Ruiz, a socialist activist five years 
her senior. Ruiz, who claimed he guided La Pasionaria politically, once 
recalled her as being as independent as a mountain goat. 
</P>
<P>
Separated from his wife since the 1930s, Ruiz died a few weeks after her return 
to Spain from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Ibarruri wrote that she found married life "odious and unbearable." Four of her 
six children died in infancy, including triplets born in 1923. 
</P>
<P>
Ruiz was often jailed for labor agitation and unable to feed their two 
remaining children -- a son, Ruben, who died in the battle of Stalingrad, and a 
daughter, Amaya, the sole surviving child. 
</P>
<P>
Dolores Ibarruri turned to politics after Ruiz introduced her to socialism and 
Marxism. She read about the Russian Revolution. "Two names," she wrote later, 
"struck me in my heart and in my head -- Russia and Lenin. I no longer felt 
sad; I no longer felt alone." 
</P>
<P>
She began a career as a labor organizer and strike leader and wrote articles 
she signed as La Pasionaria, a name she chose in 1916 because her first article 
appeared during Holy Week, known in Spanish as the week of the Passion. 
</P>
<P>
In 1934, she led a rebellion by 40,000 miners in the northern province of 
Asturias. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet communism became La Pasionaria's religion. She visited Moscow in 1933 
and 1935, when she was elected deputy to the Parliament from the town of 
Oviedo. 
</P>
<P>
When the civil war broke out in July, 1936, she sent her surviving children to 
the Soviet Union, remaining in Madrid to lead rallies, visit Republican forces 
and make her ringing radio broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
Her ability to recruit fighters was so strong that her enemies often claimed 
that she was being guided directly by Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
With Franco's victory imminent, La Pasionaria fled to the Soviet Union in 1939. 
She was named secretary-general of the Spanish Communist Party in exile in 
1942. She became president in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
She saw the once powerful Spanish Communist Party, which she helped found in 
1920, split into factions and become a minor political force under the 
constitutional monarchy of King Juan Carlos I. 
</P>
<P>
She witnessed the party's move away from Moscow without saying a word. But she 
always remained an unshakeable supporter of the Soviets, who gave her the Order 
of Lenin, one of the Soviet Union's most prestigious honors.

An earthquake that registered magnitude 4.25 struck about 20 miles off the 
coast of Point Mendocino. No damage or injuries were reported, according to the 
state Office of Emergency Services. A Ft. Bragg radio station reported three 
calls from residents who felt the temblor. "I had one lady call and ask if we'd 
just had an earthquake," said Mendocino County Sheriff's Sgt. Tony Craver, who 
did not feel the quake. "There was no feeling, no sensation of an earthquake at 
all."

POLICE DENYING ARREST OF SUSPECT IN SHOOTING OF PREGNANT WOMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Police on Sunday denied published reports that they had arrested a main suspect 
in the shooting of a pregnant woman and her husband last month. 
</P>
<P>
William Bennett, 39, of Boston's Mission Hill section, where the shootings 
occurred, was arrested at his girlfriend's home in suburban Burlington on a 
traffic violation, Burlington police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston Sunday Herald cited unidentified police sources as saying that 
Bennett was a chief suspect in the attack that left attorney Carol Stuart dead 
and her husband, Charles, seriously wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston Sunday Globe also reported that sources familiar with the case said 
that police were focusing on Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
But Joseph Dunford, deputy chief of detectives for Boston police, said in a 
statement released Sunday that no arrest had been made in the Stuart case. He 
refused to comment on the newspaper reports. 
</P>
<P>
Pauline Bennett, mother of the man who was arrested, said that her son was a 
suspect in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been in trouble before. He knew he was a suspect. He was nervous and 
upset about it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Stuart, 30, was shot in the head by a man who abducted her and her 
husband as they were leaving Brigham and Womens' Hospital after a childbirth 
preparation class. 
</P>
<P>
She died shortly after their son, Christopher, was delivered by Cesarean 
section. The infant survived for more than two weeks, but succumbed to a 
respiratory ailment Thursday. His death was ruled a homicide. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Stuart, 29, was in guarded condition in Boston City Hospital after 
surgery Saturday. Hospital officials would not give a reason for the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett has served separate prison terms for shooting two police officers, the 
Herald reported. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Stuart told police that the assailant mistook him for a police officer 
because the couple had a cellular telephone in their car. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett's girlfriend, Faye Nelson, told the Sun of Lowell newspaper in a 
telephone interview that Bennett was with her at the time of the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't do it," she said.

WORDS OF DISBELIEF: 'I CAN'T BE INFERTILE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERRI KOBREN, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The hard part, one of the women says, was hearing the words from her doctor: 
"You need an infertility workup." 
</P>
<P>
"No, I can't be infertile," she thought. "That's not the way my life is 
supposed to be." 
</P>
<P>
But something is obviously keeping her from having a baby. So, her husband has 
a semen analysis to find out whether his sperm are viable, and she takes her 
temperature first thing every morning, looking for the half-degree rise that 
signals ovulation and a one-day window of opportunity for conception. 
</P>
<P>
Sex is scheduled. The postcoital analysis of her cervical mucus follows. The 
other tests come after that. 
</P>
<P>
There is a sisterhood of infertile women. They find one another in the waiting 
rooms of fertility centers, in the recovery rooms outside the operating suites 
where they have had their diagnostic or therapeutic procedures, in the meeting 
rooms or through the telephone support network of Resolve, an organization for 
infertile people. 
</P>
<P>
They trade stories of conception failures, miscarriages, diagnoses, reparative 
surgeries, adoption attempts, drug therapies, crying jags, periods of doubt. 
</P>
<P>
One, whose history of gynecological problems and inability to conceive seems to 
be related to the DES her own mother took during pregnancy, wonders: "How do I 
know this (fertility) drug won't have an effect on the fetus, too?" 
</P>
<P>
Another talks of side effects. Some of the drugs made her gain weight, others 
caused menopausal-type flushes. 
</P>
<P>
And money: $100 a month for the medicine. 
</P>
<P>
And all of them talk about their marriages. "My husband suffered with me," one 
says. "But he got sick of timing sex. I was obsessing about it." 
</P>
<P>
"You're having sex when they tell you to have sex," says another. "You begin to 
feel you have a whole medical team in the bedroom." 
</P>
<P>
Their jobs suffer. "How could I tell my boss, 'You can't put me on night shift 
this week -- I'm ovulating'?" says one. Then there are the well-meaning friends 
and family members. The ones who ask and the ones who don't and the people who 
give advice: "You've got too much stress at work," or "You're too tense; just 
relax and you'll be OK." 
</P>
<P>
"I adopted a child. I quit my job. I'm still not pregnant," one of them says. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to know who to trust," says a woman whose pregnancies, one after the 
other, ended in miscarriage. One doctor diagnosed fibroid tumors. Another 
treated her for progesterone deficit. A third wanted to put her on drugs to 
encourage ovulation and a fourth found a previously unrecognized infection and 
a subtle immune system defect. That doctor finally medicated her, with 
antibiotics and baby aspirin, into a pregnancy that produced a baby. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah, in the Bible, was barren until advanced old age. Rebecca was, too, and 
then had twins. Rachel watched, envious, as Leah produced son after son before 
she, finally, bore two. Miracles still happen. Even after years of infertility, 
some people will suddenly conceive, entirely without medical help and for 
reasons medicine does not understand. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, medical specialists understand a great deal. 
</P>
<P>
And in many cases they can, indeed, help the miracles happen.

TOYS R US, BARNEYS NEW YORK CRACK JAPANESE MARKET VIA JOINT VENTURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amid the rhetoric about the Japanese buying up America as they keep would-be 
business rivals out of Japan, U.S. trade officials recently have had some cause 
for cheer. 
</P>
<P>
Two highly regarded U.S. retailers have joined forces with Japanese 
counterparts in efforts to crack the tough-to-enter Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
Toys R Us, the nation's largest toy merchant, is hooking up with McDonald's Co. 
(Japan) and its dynamic founder, Den Fujita, to open giant discount toy stores 
in Japan, some with Golden Arches appended, starting in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
And Barneys New York, a classy clothier that caters to well-heeled 
professionals, is teaming up with Isetan, a prominent Japanese department store 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Both U.S. merchants realized that, to get past Japan's seemingly endless 
restrictions and to find sites in the island nation's densely packed cities, 
they needed help from executives experienced in slashing through the 
bureaucracy and dealing with Japan's labyrinthine -- some would argue archaic 
-- distribution system. 
</P>
<P>
At stake for the Americans are outlets for U.S.-made goods and potentially 
billions of dollars in sales from one of the world's most freewheeling consumer 
blocks. For the Japanese, a successful venture in their country could help open 
doors in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
To date, Japanese retailers have met with limited success operating stores in 
the United States. But the plethora of well-known U.S. merchants for sale -- 
including Bloomingdale's, Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field's -- has 
prompted some Japanese interest. Sogo Co., an old-line Osaka-based department 
store company, reportedly is looking at Saks, and Tokyu Department Store has 
said it is negotiating to buy Bloomingdale's. 
</P>
<P>
But Hirokazu Ishii, a research analyst with Nomura Research Institute (America) 
in New York, said lack of familiarity with the U.S. culture makes it tough for 
Japanese merchants. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's a good deal for them to buy American department or 
specialty stores," he said. Better to learn from Americans, he said, praising 
the joint venture idea. 
</P>
<P>
To U.S. trade officials, who emerged grim-faced from two days of fruitless 
trade talks with the Japanese last week, these deals offer signs of hope that 
successful American companies can blaze trails on Japanese turf and help narrow 
the trade gap. Although U.S. designer boutiques exist in Japan, no retailer has 
managed to establish a major presence there. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really breaking ground," one trade official said of the Toys R Us 
deal. "It's a win-win situation. 
</P>
<P>
Japan watchers have high expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very practical way of leveraging on someone's expertise and 
know-how," said Yukuo Takenaka, president and chief executive of Takenaka &amp; 
Co., a Los Angeles-based investment banking firm specializing in Pacific Basin 
transactions. "This type of joint venture will continue. (U.S. companies) will 
find that going it alone will be a tough and risky way of doing it in Japan." 
</P>
<P>
The same, he added, is true of the Japanese. "They want new sources of 
merchandise and will be looking for access overseas, including in America," 
Takenaka said. 
</P>
<P>
As with Mitsubishi Estate Co.'s recent agreement to buy 51% of Rockefeller 
Group, those involved in the two retailing ventures agreed that the most 
crucial ingredient was chemistry. "It's like a marriage," one Isetan executive 
said. "The most important thing is that we like each other." 
</P>
<P>
Toys n' Burgers 
</P>
<P>
If they ever erect a Retailing Hall of Fame, Toys R Us and its founder, 
Chairman and Chief Executive Charles Lazarus, will undoubtedly be charter 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Resurrected from bankruptcy just 10 years ago, the Paramus, N.J., company is 
now a robust merchandising machine with more than $4 billion in annual sales 
from 404 U.S. toy stores, 74 international toy stores and 137 Kids R Us 
children's clothing stores. 
</P>
<P>
Having ventured successfully into Canada, the United Kingdom, West Germany, 
France, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Taiwan, Toys R Us was looking to tap 
another market. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan was a logical offshoot," said Robert C. Nakasone, who grew up in the 
Sunland-Tujunga area of Los Angeles and is now vice chairman and president of 
worldwide toy stores at Toys R Us. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials felt that the logical approach would be to get a local 
partner, as they had in other Far Eastern locations. 
</P>
<P>
Toys R Us wanted "someone who understands American business but also 
understands the unique Japanese culture," Nakasone said. 
</P>
<P>
It so happened that Joseph R. Baczko, president of the company's international 
division, and Takuro Isoda, chairman and chief executive of Daiwa Securities 
America, met two years ago while sitting on Georgetown University's forum on 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Isoda arranged a meeting six months later with Den Fujita, the Japanese 
entrepreneur who almost single-handedly turned the Japanese into a 
hamburger-loving people. McDonald's (Japan) is half owned by McDonald's Corp., 
based in Oak Brook, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Toys R Us wanted a partner willing to accept a 20% stake, in exchange for 
helping to secure sites and cut through stiff restrictions on store openings. 
Toys R Us would retain an 80% share. After training in the States, Japanese 
nationals would run the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Baczko and Fujita hit it off. 
</P>
<P>
Although he had not even heard of Toys R Us, Fujita "is a very quick study and 
understood . . . what the basic requirements for success would be in Japan," 
Baczko said. "Fujita speaks fluent English, but more important, he's 
bicultural. He can read Americans very well." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to phones and facsimile machines, the deal came together within about 12 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
After the war, Fujita attended the prestigious University of Tokyo but, instead 
of moving on to a career in government or law, established Fujita &amp; Co., a 
trading company that sells Christian Dior handbags and other high-fashion 
items. 
</P>
<P>
In 1969, a friend in the import-export business introduced him to Ray Kroc, the 
founder of McDonald's, which was seeking an overseas partner. 
</P>
<P>
"When I met Ray Kroc, he told me he had met hundreds of Japanese already" but 
had not really liked anybody, Fujita said in a telephone interview from Tokyo. 
"When he met me, five minutes later he said, 'OK, let's go.' " 
</P>
<P>
Fujita suspects that the quick connection had something to do with the fact 
that both were born in years of the tiger under the Chinese lunar calendar. The 
late Kroc was born in 1902 and Fujita, in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, the 50-50 venture in Japan hit a stumbling block. 
McDonald's wanted its Japanese partner to locate restaurants only in the 
suburbs. Fujita insisted that Japanese cities, with their hordes of young 
people, made more sense. He held out for opening the first Japanese McDonald's 
in the fashionable Mitsukoshi department store on the Ginza in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese media predicted that the venture would be bankrupt within two 
weeks, Fujita recalled. "In Japan, everybody was eating rice and fish. They 
didn't know what was a hamburger." 
</P>
<P>
Fujita, who still reportedly prefers noodles, proved them wrong. Today, at a 
vibrant age 63, he oversees almost 700 McDonald's outlets with $1.2 billion in 
sales. And he taught a thing or two to McDonald's, which now routinely puts 
outlets in cities. (McDonald's Japan and U.S. will split the 20% stake in Toys 
R Us evenly.) 
</P>
<P>
Baczko of Toys R Us admired Fujita's entrepreneurial instincts. During lunch 
one day on the second floor of a Japanese McDonald's, Fujita noticed a poster 
advertising french fries. Fujita called over the manager and noted that anybody 
on the second floor already had decided whether to buy fries. "Why don't you 
put an apple pie poster up there?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"He's our type of guy," Baczko said. "He's an operator." 
</P>
<P>
In 20 years of building McDonald's, Fujita has become intimately familiar with 
real estate. His staff keeps lists of thousands of properties. Moreover, he is 
skilled at clearing bureaucratic hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
Key to the venture's success, officials on both sides say, will be Japan's 
willingness to follow through on promises announced earlier this year to smooth 
the way for big new stores in Japan. In the past, retailers have been required 
to secure an elaborate set of approvals. Many a proposal has taken as long as 
10 years to wend its way through the process. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry agreed to 
put a cap on how long the process can take. What has been an indeterminate 
period has apparently been reduced to 24 months, although the new method has 
yet to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
"Our country is very closed in many directions," acknowledged Fujita, the 
McDonald's (Japan) entrepreneur. "We are the first batter to challenge the 
government red tape. 
</P>
<P>
"If Toys R Us people would like to open a store anywhere in Japan, I can find 
the information immediately," he added. "For example, about 30 kilometers from 
Tokyo, I can get three to five acres easily. McDonald's cannot go alone. But if 
we go together, we have the same customer. If I found three acres for Toys R 
Us, at the same time I can get a half acre for McDonald's." 
</P>
<P>
Fujita said the companies are negotiating for approval on several properties. 
He expects that the venture can open five stores in 1991. Toys R Us plans a 
minimum of 100 stores in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Yukuo Takenaka of Takenaka &amp; Co. predicts that Toys R Us "will 
revolutionize the Japanese toy market." Consumers routinely pay four times as 
much for toys as purchasers in other countries. Mom-and-pop stores, he figures, 
will hustle to compete, so that Japanese customers stand to benefit on two 
fronts: lower prices, resulting from Toys R Us' distribution efficiency, and 
improved service from smaller toy retailers. 
</P>
<P>
Toys R Us has found that its presence in a country expands the overall market. 
The Japanese toy market, though fragmented, stands at roughly $4.5 billion, 
which Toys R Us views as "significantly underexploited." (The U.S. market is 
nearly $20 billion.) Toys R Us figures that it can easily double demand in 
Japan within 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the toys-and-burgers deal was announced, Lazarus and Fujita 
journeyed to Washington to see U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills, an 
outspoken critic of Japan's exclusionary practices. 
</P>
<P>
"We were received with great interest," Lazarus said. "Everybody there was very 
enthusiastic about the prospects." 
</P>
<P>
Among the most excited is Fujita. 
</P>
<P>
"I have confidence that Toys R Us-McDonald's will be No. 1 in the international 
world," he said. "When we open in 1991, there will be a big party." 
</P>
<P>
Barneys/Isetan 
</P>
<P>
In spring, 1988, the Pressman family that founded and runs Barneys New York 
began to think about how to best exploit the Barneys name on a global scale. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1923, the upscale retailer had grown from a small discount 
storefront operation to one of the world's largest specialty apparel stores, 
with a ritzy, 170,000-square-foot Manhattan flagship store housing more than 
30,000 men's suits and a wide array of designer apparel for women, and a 
recently opened, 10,000-square-foot satellite store in the Wall Street area. 
Annual sales had grown to more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
It called on advisers at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. to raise equity capital to 
establish a new business called Barneys America that would open small, upscale 
clothing shops in malls. 
</P>
<P>
At Goldman's Tokyo office, U.S.-educated Masa Mochida sensed a good match in 
Isetan Co., a retailer whose president, 42-year-old Kuniyasu Kosuge, is a 
member of the founding family's fourth generation. The department store chain, 
akin to Nordstrom in its merchandise mix, is the sixth largest in Japan, with 
about $4 billion in sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
"The key was finding a good fit of people," said Robert Pressman, 35, Barneys' 
executive vice president of finance and operations. His father, Fred Pressman, 
is president, and brother Gene is executive vice president of merchandising and 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the Pressmans made contact in October, 1988, with a New York-based 
Isetan official, general manager Yuzaburo Miyake. Soon after, Isetan and 
Barneys representatives met in Japan, and "it was a very good fit almost from 
the beginning," Pressman said. "We liked very much that they were fourth 
generation and we were third." 
</P>
<P>
Largely thanks to Mochida, a University of Pennsylvania graduate who one 
participant said served as a bridge between the two cultures, negotiations 
proceeded apace. By January, an initial agreement had been struck. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiation process entailed getting comfortable. "In the beginning, 
everything was very formal," said J. Markham Green, a Goldman Sachs partner in 
New York. "As they got to know each other, the cultural differences really 
broke down. Now they've got a really kind of fun friendship." 
</P>
<P>
Isetan agreed to make a minority investment in a new retail company that would 
open small specialty stores in malls. Barneys, meanwhile, would make a minority 
investment in a joint venture with Isetan to operate stores in Japan under the 
Barneys New York name. The total investment will run into several hundred 
million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The reciprocal agreement is unusual. Other well-known clothiers, including 
Brooks Bros. and Paul Stuart, operate in Japan strictly under a licensing 
arrangement, with Japanese having full control of the franchises. 
</P>
<P>
Barneys New York's first Japanese store is planned for opening late next year 
near the central Tokyo train station in the Shinjuku section; first-year sales 
are projected to be $40 million. (By 1994, the partners also expect to have 25 
small U.S. stores with revenue exceeding $100 million; one is slated to open 
next February in South Coast Plaza.) 
</P>
<P>
Other stores are being discussed for Singapore, Thailand, Hong Kong and 
Malaysia, where Isetan has operations. 
</P>
<P>
For Barneys, Japan represented a "wonderful consumer market," Pressman said. 
"They are extremely sophisticated, with complete knowledge of fashion and 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, we think the market in Japan . . . is shifting to more specialty stores. 
(The goal is) to deliver specialness." 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest adjustments, Pressman said, has been to Japanese land 
prices. Prime real estate goes for as much as $35,000 a square foot, compared 
to $2,000 in New York or Beverly Hills. On the other hand, Japanese sales per 
square foot can run $3,000 a year, 10 times those of the average U.S. retailer. 
</P>
<P>
Barneys will also have to cope with Japanese practices that vary drastically 
from U.S. methods. In Japan, for example, most of the merchandise is supplied 
by wholesalers who control designer labels through licensing agreements. Any 
unsold merchandise is returned to the wholesaler. Markdowns are almost 
nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
Barneys expects to take a different approach, importing some private-label and 
designer merchandise directly. But Pressman said full details have yet to be 
worked out. 
</P>
<P>
He is certain of one thing, though. 
</P>
<P>
Given the Japanese bureaucracy, "if you do it alone, it will be extremely 
difficult. If you can do it with a good joint venture partner, the process is 
very comfortable and pleasant." 
</P>
<P>
Pressman even took some good-natured ribbing from the golf-loving Isetan folks 
when the two teams were in Hawaii closing a deal. A novice golfer, Pressman was 
complimented for having the "most unique" score at a fancy club -- 120 for nine 
holes. 
</P>
<P>
He's planning to do a bit better next month on a ski trip with some of the 
Isetan principals next month in Deer Valley, Utah. He expects the friendships 
-- and the joint venture -- to last a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"We view it," he said, "as a lifetime project."

DOUGLAS HELPING DISPLACED WORKERS GET BACK ON TRACK;

Joe Brazil spent 25 years climbing up the corporate ladder at Douglas Aircraft, 
only to be pushed off. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil, a former telecommunications director, was the victim of a corporate 
upheaval at the Long Beach-based aerospace firm. Layers of Douglas management 
were stripped away last spring, and 274 senior executives like Brazil ended up 
competing for 74 remaining slots. Brazil lost out and was told to apply for 
lower-level jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt no reason to start out at the bottom someplace else," said Brazil, 51. 
"A great deal of your status in life is tied to your job. I felt that my 
self-esteem had been taken away. I felt very bad." 
</P>
<P>
But instead of quitting, Brazil and more than a dozen other Douglas executives 
have participated in a company-sponsored program designed to patch up battered 
egos and help managers plan the next step in their personal and professional 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-week program, designed for Douglas by Business Life Transitions, a 
Seal Beach-based career management consulting firm, included career and 
financial planning, treks into the wilderness and heavy doses of self-analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Career counseling and Outward Bound outdoor experiences are nothing new in the 
corporate world. But the Douglas program is unusual in that it bundles various 
such activities into one package for displaced workers. 
</P>
<P>
Business Life Transitions was brought in after Douglas Aircraft's corporate 
parent, St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas, mastered a sweeping reorganization 
of the firm and its culture to boost teamwork, quality and profits. 
</P>
<P>
Jack D. Meacham, a Douglas executive who proposed creating the program, said 
there is little willingness among corporations to allow employees "to go off 
and find out about themselves and what they want out of life." 
</P>
<P>
"In my generation, we took what job we could get," said Ivan Workman, a 37-year 
Douglas veteran who saw his responsibilities as director of operations control 
divided up between several departments in the corporate make over. "Nobody ever 
asked us, 'What do you like to do? What do you want to do?' It (the program) 
gave me the confidence and self-esteem to do what I wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
But the program met and continues to suffer from widespread employee suspicions 
about its intent. It has often been described among executives as "suicide 
prevention," and its emphasis on group decision making and the exploration of 
personal feelings and values has made many uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
"They are more of an engineering mentality and they show (only one face) at 
work and then they go home," said Meacham of aerospace workers in general. 
"They are not a people-oriented group as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't prepared for a lot of self-examination," said Brazil. "You're 
wondering, 'Am I worthy? Am I good enough?' You don't really want to know the 
answer because maybe they're right. Maybe I'm not good enough." 
</P>
<P>
Participants kept journals and took tests to analyze their strengths and 
weaknesses. Groups were taken to Lake Arrowhead for numerous outdoor exercises 
that had middle-aged executives walking across and then jumping off a log 
suspended 30 feet in the air. The members were secured to a safety harness 
during the exercise. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole essence of the outdoor experience is to essentially get past one's 
limitations," said Carl E. Samuels, who runs Business Life Transitions along 
with wife Keiko Matsuura. "It helps expand your willingness to look at other 
parts of your life." 
</P>
<P>
The program revealed a lot of individual preferences that had been buried for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"The most common way we got our jobs is because we had done well in our last 
job and moved up," said Jay Perry, 56, who discovered that his previous job as 
director of operations planning required him to be more of an extrovert than he 
would have liked. "Maybe it really did not fit the scenario of what we would 
have liked to do when we grew up." 
</P>
<P>
Several of the 15 executives that have gone through the program grew so 
dependent on each other that they decided to stick together. A group of nine 
men, including Brazil, Perry and Workman, persuaded top officials at Douglas to 
keep them on as in-house trouble-shooters -- the T-Team, a reference to their 
transition. 
</P>
<P>
The members of T-Team, which will decide whether to disband at year-end, are 
helping other managers cope with the changes. The team has also been charged 
with creating closer relationships between Douglas and a select group of 
suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
"You could feel you were in the presence of a team," said Meacham, who attended 
the group's presentation to top management. "They (top managers) would like to 
clone that attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Working as consultants has forced the Douglas executives to apply the 
techniques and attitudes learned during the program. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to learn that we no longer have direct control," said Workman. "You 
can't say, 'Do it.' You say, 'What do you think about it?' It's a new, 
interesting way of doing things."

WHAT THE 1990S HAVE IN STORE FOR THE OIL INDUSTRY; 
</P>
<P>
ENERGY: WITH PROSPECTS FOR STRONGER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND CONTINUING WEAKER 
PRICES, THE OUTLOOK IS NOT GOOD. BUT THERE ARE SOME BRIGHT SPOTS.

<P>
The oil industry is entering the last decade of the century with the muck of 
the 1980s still stuck to its boots like oil from the Exxon Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
The legacy of the Valdez will haunt oil companies in California and elsewhere 
that are just emerging from a period of major restructuring accelerated by the 
collapse of oil prices in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
During that time, major oil companies pared exploration and production staffs, 
closed unprofitable refining operations and improved efficiencies at others, 
and shifted emphasis from domestic to foreign oil prospecting as home-grown 
sources dwindled. 
</P>
<P>
Now, post-Valdez environmental concerns stand in the way of renewed domestic 
oil and gas exploration, and proposed clean air rules threaten to transform the 
industry's gasoline refining business forever. 
</P>
<P>
In California, where environmental regulations are strictest, environmental and 
financial obstacles to new refinery building are already making existing plants 
among the most desirable in the industry -- and this in a place where gasoline 
demand is expected to grow the fastest. 
</P>
<P>
The last gasps of the industry's restructuring can be seen in recent industry 
developments: 
</P>
<P>
California companies such as Unocal Corp. and Occidental Petroleum Corp., as 
well as Mobil Oil Corp. and British Petroleum, have announced reorganization of 
exploration and production units, including some staff cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the layoffs are reflecting the real end of the depression in the 
upstream (exploration and production) side of the industry," said Edward Morse, 
executive publisher of industry newsletter Petroleum Intelligence Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
Several refinery operations have gone on the block recently, many in 
California. Southland Corp. said last week that it would sell its remaining 
half-interest in Citgo Petroleum Corp., which operates a refinery in Northern 
California, to the Venezuelan state-owned oil company for $675 million. Santa 
Monica-based Tosco Corp., the West Coast's largest independent refiner, said 
last week that it was entertaining offers from at least three multinational 
companies for its business. And Unocal is about to close its own deal with the 
Venezuelans, a joint venture to operate Unocal's Chicago refinery that would 
bring Unocal more than $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a recognition that this is a good market here," said Thomas K. 
Nance, Tosco's treasurer. "The supply-demand balance appears to be very tight, 
and the expectation is that the market will only get better." 
</P>
<P>
The desirability of California refineries contrasts with refining in other 
parts of the country. Unocal said last week that it would cease all refinery 
production at its 65-year-old Beaumont plant in Nederland, Tex., which makes 
lube oil, aromatics and solvents. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very out of date for the marketplace. . . . And with the margins as 
they are, you just can't compete," said Unocal spokesman Barry Lane. The Gulf 
Coast region's refining profit margins rank last behind those of three other 
regions of the country, according to a report by Drexel Burnham Lambert. The 
West Coast has the strongest. 
</P>
<P>
In the country as a whole, the restructuring period has resulted in a sharp 
drop in domestic oil and gas production. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really the second round in the long trend of downsizing in the 
exploration and production business that started in '84 or '85," said Phillip 
Ellis, a vice president with Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. "The idea behind 
it was that the U.S. resource base has the highest cost in the world. . . . 
There's a lot of oil and gas left here, but very few elephants," meaning fields 
large enough to reward oil company development. 
</P>
<P>
In 1990, crude oil production will see the sharpest decline since the 1970s, 
according to a forecast by the Independent Petroleum Assn. of America. 
Production dropped 460,000 barrels per day in 1989 over a year earlier, and is 
expected to fall an additional 329,000 barrels per day to 7.4 million in 1990. 
Natural gas production remained level in 1989 at 16.6 trillion cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
The budget for domestic exploration and production, which accounted for about 
75% to 78% of total E&amp;P budgets, now constitutes less than half, Morse 
said. Amoco Corp., traditionally one of the first companies to announce its 
annual exploration budget, says that for the first time in its history, more 
than half of its budget will be spent outside the United States in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"When today's oil executives calculate and form their strategies for the 
future, they confront the fact that U.S. oil production is not likely to occupy 
the cornerstone of their operations," said Dillard P. Spriggs, president of 
Petroleum Analysis Ltd., in a speech at Johns Hopkins University this fall. 
</P>
<P>
But there are some signs that interest in domestic oil and gas exploration is 
picking up as prices stabilize, although no one expects such activity to ever 
match pre-collapse levels. "From almost every perspective, there are signs that 
(exploration and production) operations are increasing, mostly outside the 
U.S., but in the U.S. as well," Morse said. 
</P>
<P>
The prime indicator of new drilling activity -- the rig count -- has been 
climbing steadily in the past few months, according to Baker Hughes Inc., the 
oil services firm. As of Nov. 6, the number of rotary drilling rigs in use rose 
to 1,042. That's still well below the peak level of 4,530 or so in 1981, but is 
nevertheless the highest level since the winter of 1988. For the year, the rig 
count remains below 1988 levels. 
</P>
<P>
Natural gas appears the most promising, especially if clean air regulations 
spur demand and the current oversupply diminishes as hoped. Amoco has made 
natural gas development a prime goal of its domestic operations. It became the 
largest owner of U.S. natural gas reserves with the acquisition last year of 
Canada's Dome Petroleum and part of the Tenneco reserves. 
</P>
<P>
On the refining side, analysts agree that most of the weaker operations have 
been weeded out, and improvements have raised operating rates to their highest 
levels ever as demand remains relatively strong and profit margins remain 
generally good. 
</P>
<P>
Refining capacity is so tight now that prices spike sharply at any disruptions, 
such as Hurricane Hugo's destruction to Caribbean refineries or last month's 
explosion at a Phillips Petroleum Co. plastics refinery in Texas. And some 
observers fear that the high rates of utilization make such disruptions all the 
more likely. 
</P>
<P>
All of which is placing a premium on refinery assets, particularly on the West 
Coast, where refining margins are highest. Environmental regulations make it 
hugely expensive, if not altogether impossible, to build a new plant in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Tight capacity has also renewed interest in other refining assets. Last month, 
Coastal Corp. said it would reactivate the closed Exxon plant in Aruba in the 
Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
A number of things keep analysts from being overly optimistic about a strong 
rebound in the oil industry's fortunes: 
</P>
<P>
Independent producers still await federal action to return tax benefits lost 
during the rewrite of federal tax laws. 
</P>
<P>
Continued oversupply of natural gas could keep prices soft and discourage new 
domestic production. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental pressures could keep drilling out of promising areas. A 
continuation of moratoriums on offshore drilling could put outer continental 
shelf areas off limits to production indefinitely, and post-Valdez concerns 
will probably keep exploration out of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
</P>
<P>
A downturn in the economy could mean the loss of refining profits at a time 
when many will face upgrades to make cleaner gasolines or alternative fuels. 
</P>
<P>
Looming over everything is uncertainty about where oil prices may go. Most 
analysts expect prices to continue at their current levels through the year. 
Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet later 
this month to discuss their nations' production levels and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CUTTING BACK 
</P>
<P>
Arco: The firm announced a reorganization plan in 1986 designed to reduce the 
size of its domestic oil and gas work force by 23% -- about 2,000 employees -- 
and to divest itself of refining and petroleum marketing operations east of the 
Mississippi River, as well as all remaining non-coal minerals operations. 
Money-losing Arco Solar in Camarillo was sold earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron: By 1987, the company had eliminated 27,500 jobs since the 1984 
acquisition of Gulf Oil. The reductions came through the sale of assets and 
consolidation of operations. 
</P>
<P>
Unocal: The company has been selling assets to reduce the heavy debt taken on 
in 1985 when it fought a takeover bid by T. Boone Pickens Jr. The company sold 
its Los Angeles headquarters building, and recently announced it will curtail 
retail operations in the Pacific Northwest and close its Nederland, Tex., 
refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental Petroleum: Announced in early September it will lay off 900 workers 
from its Oil &amp; Gas Corp. unit based in Tulsa, Okla., to streamline domestic 
energy operations.

IMF Approves $1.4 Billion for Argentina: Argentina received approval for a 
$1.4-billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. An IMF spokesman said 
the lending agency's executive board approved the so-called standby 
arrangement, which allows the country to draw down the funds over the next 16 
months. The approval showed that the IMF was satisfied that Argentina had begun 
the process of economic reform that lenders felt was critically needed before 
new funds could be provided. Argentina has made virtually no payments on its 
$60 billion in foreign debt, piling up about $4.4 billion in interest payment 
arrears, according to some estimates.

PIANIST FINDS HE CAN GO HOME AGAIN -- A HERO; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: VLADIMIR ASHKENAZY LEFT HIS HOMELAND 26 YEARS AGO IN SEARCH OF ARTISTIC 
FREEDOM AND RETURNS AS HONORED SON.

<P>
When the pianist Vladimir Ashkenazy left the Soviet Union 26 years ago, it was 
in great bitterness. He was rejecting, as strongly as he could, the Soviet 
system in which he had grown up as soul-destroying and turning his back on the 
Russian motherland. And for that he was called a traitor by many here. 
</P>
<P>
As a young musician, the winner of the gold medal at the prestigious 
Tchaikovsky Competition in 1962, he saw cultural bureaucrats and Communist 
Party hacks squeezing the spirit of out of all the arts, out of his music. "I 
could see a time coming when I would not be able to play a single note," 
Ashkenazy said. "I had to leave." 
</P>
<P>
But this weekend, Ashkenazy returned for the first time in a quarter century, 
and not as a prodigal asking forgiveness but as an honored son whose 
international stature has brought the country new esteem. 
</P>
<P>
"Our country is changing -- rapidly and for the better," he said. "I feel much 
more at home here now than I did 26 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
For Ashkenazy, now 52, it was clearly a homecoming he had yearned for but had, 
until recently, doubted would ever come. 
</P>
<P>
Crowds filled the streets outside the Moscow Conservatory, where he performed, 
the luminaries of Soviet culture came to pay homage, taking up virtually every 
waking moment of his five days here, and gray-haired grandmothers who knew 
Ashkenazy when they were all at school came to renew their friendship. 
</P>
<P>
"The emotions of a return like this are tremendously conflicting," Ashkenazy 
said at the outset of his visit. "But the joy of coming back under these 
circumstances and seeing this rebirth here overcomes the sadness of the past." 
</P>
<P>
Invited back by the Soviet Cultural Fund, which operates under the patronage of 
Raisa Gorbachev, the wife of the country's president, Ashkenazy conducted two 
charity concerts over the weekend by Britain's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, of 
which he is the music director and which is en route to Japan for a tour. 
</P>
<P>
"Had I been invited earlier, I would have thought not just twice or three times 
about accepting, but 10 times or more before agreeing to come," Ashkenazy said. 
"What was happening to this country and its people then had to be opposed and 
denounced. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But I thought that by accepting now and coming to Moscow that I would in a 
modest way endorse what is happening in my country, to support the changes that 
perestroika, glasnost and democratization are bringing." 
</P>
<P>
Echoing the sentiments of many of the other writers, musicians, artists and 
other intellectuals who were driven into exile in the 1960s and 1970s and are 
now returning on visits, Ashkenazy said that the liberalization under President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev would spur the revival of the arts and of Russian culture 
"in ways that will make us all proud again." 
</P>
<P>
"With the new times, with the new concepts of life being put forward, with the 
new freedom that people experience, the effect on every aspect of this 
country's existence will be beneficial," Ashkenazy said, speaking with 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
Even as he reflected, however, on the hard times of the past and the recent 
change, he paused to recall that there had been great work by Russian artists 
even then. 
</P>
<P>
"If (the late Soviet composer Dmitri) Shostakovich were writing now, he 
wouldn't have the material," Ashkenazy said. "The Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and 
Tenth symphonies are all drenched in hopelessness, the feeling that there is no 
light at the end of the tunnel. They deal with desolation. Some of the greatest 
works of art appear at the most difficult times. 
</P>
<P>
"But give me this freedom any time. I am concerned with the life of this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Although he has lived in London, in Iceland with his pianist wife, Thorunn 
(Dody) Johannsdottir, and now in Lucerne, Switzerland, Ashkenazy quickly 
submerged back into the Russian culture from which few emigres ever escape. 
"Half my life has been abroad, and yet I still say 'abroad' to speak about 
where I live and 'home' about a land I left -- odd isn't it?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he also has become accustomed to thinking mostly in English now and found 
himself asking friends and newsmen what the Russian words were for such 
concepts as affinity and free-roaming. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ashkenazy who left the Soviet Union in 1963 was a piano virtuoso, winner 
not only of the Tchaikovsky Competition but others as well; the one who 
returned is now a respected conductor, directing not only the Royal 
Philharmonic but also conducting the Cleveland Symphony Orchestra and the 
Berlin Radio Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
Ashkenazy has appeared in the Southland more than two dozen times since leaving 
the Soviet Union and returns to conduct the L.A. Philharmonic Dec. 8 and 10. 
</P>
<P>
The two concerts in Moscow -- a mix of Tchaikovsky, Beethoven, Walton, 
Rachmaninoff, Mussorgsky, Ravel -- were out of the repertoire of the Royal 
Philharmonic, and Ashkenazy played only one piece, which he could also conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Did he not feel a bit schizophrenic?, he was asked during a question-and-answer 
session with teachers and students at the Moscow Conservatory, the country's 
leading music school. Did he now want to give up the piano for conducting? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, I really don't know," he replied. "There is so much more in 
piano literature that I have not done, but there is even more in the orchestral 
repertoire that I haven't done. I don't know where to put my energy, so I just 
let it flow."

VIACOM SCALES DOWN 'COSBY' RERUN PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When reruns of "The Cosby Show" went into syndication a year ago, they were 
expected to hit TV like a megaton bomb, giving the 187 stations that bought 
them the kind of immense lift that NBC got from the original broadcasts of the 
series. 
</P>
<P>
Expectations for the reruns were so high that stations bid feverishly for the 
show, paying unprecedented prices that totaled more than $600 million in 
overall sales. In Los Angeles, KCOP-TV Channel 13 shelled out about $300,000 
per half-hour episode for rights to the series for the initial 3 1/2-year rerun 
cycle. 
</P>
<P>
But the rerun miracle of "The Cosby Show" -- the big blowout -- never 
materialized. 
</P>
<P>
Despite doing very well -- the Bill Cosby comedy is at the top of off-network 
programming -- the series is drastically dropping its price with sales now 
under way for the second cycle of reruns, which will begin in 1992 or 1993, 
depending on how many episodes are available. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody that bought 'Cosby' paid too much," said KCOP station manager Rick 
Feldman, who, like other buyers, ignored Wednesday's deadline on new sales set 
by the syndicator, Viacom. He said he's in no hurry to renew. 
</P>
<P>
Several station sources said Viacom has dropped the price for "The Cosby Show" 
by one-half or more, depending on how the series fared in individual markets. 
</P>
<P>
At KCOP, where "Cosby" runs at 7 nightly, Feldman said bluntly: "Everybody's 
going to pay less. Those prices people paid, you're not going to see again. The 
prices that many stations paid for 'Cosby' were two or three times more than 
they ever paid for any program. So 'Cosby' has to come back down to reality." 
</P>
<P>
Added Feldman: "TV has changed. It's just tough to get huge ratings when you 
have VCRs and so many new channels to compete with. You buy shows years ahead, 
and by the time they air, the business is different. It's not 'Cosby's' fault. 
It's tremendous. But the TV landscape is altered." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Viacom said the show "has performed extremely well," but 
acknowledged that the other point is whether "it is performing at a level of 
what the price was." 
</P>
<P>
Viacom says the series "has doubled the number of stations that were ranked No. 
1 in their time period." But some stations are threatening not to renew "The 
Cosby Show" at all. That would have seemed inconceivable a year ago, and still 
is surprising -- the series remains a huge hit on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
A new development has also complicated matters: Viacom has paired "The Cosby 
Show" with its spinoff, "A Different World," as a rerun package, which has 
turned off some buyers. And realizing it's dealing with stations that think 
they got burned the first time around, Viacom is even offering, at no added 
cost, five extra episodes of "Cosby" each week to stations that take the 
two-show package. 
</P>
<P>
Under Viacom's two-show proposal, stations could take one or both of the 
series, turn down the entire deal or make counter-offers. 
</P>
<P>
Did "The Cosby Show" live up to KCOP's expections in its first rerun season? 
"No," said Feldman. "It did about a point less in the ratings than what we 
thought it would do, but the demographics were good. Network affiliates that 
bought it as a lead-in to the news got hurt the most. It turned out not to be a 
good lead-in. But it is tops off-network. And for independent stations like us, 
it did really well." 
</P>
<P>
What was expected, however -- especially for the huge prices charged -- was a 
rerun blastoff that would be a franchise-maker, turning around the entire 
fortunes of stations, the way "MASH" repeats did. 
</P>
<P>
" 'MASH' didn't cost much to buy in its first rerun cycle," said Feldman, "but 
it took off in renewals. The show did incredible demographics almost anywhere 
you ran it in the schedule over a long period of time. It's definitely No. 1 in 
the syndication hall of fame."

PRO-CHOICE RALLY DRAWS THOUSANDS; 
</P>
<P>
ABORTION: RANCHO PARK GATHERING FEATURES DOZENS OF POLITICIANS AND HOLLYWOOD 
CELEBRITIES, INCLUDING JESSE JACKSON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Pro-choice activists flocked by the thousands to Rancho Park on Sunday for a 
star-studded rally that featured dozens of politicians and Hollywood 
celebrities -- from the cast of the television show "L.A. Law" to the Rev. 
Jesse Jackson, who exhorted the crowd to "fight for the right of 
self-determination." 
</P>
<P>
"We're not the puppets of the court!" Jackson bellowed from a stage festooned 
with purple and white balloons -- colors chosen because they were used in the 
women's suffrage movement. 
</P>
<P>
"Puppets do not have choices," Jackson declared. "People have choices, and that 
which God has endowed us with, no court can take away." 
</P>
<P>
His message came midway through the rally, which was part of a series of 
sunrise-to-sunset demonstrations that began at dawn in Kennebunk, Me., near the 
vacation home of President Bush, and ended at dusk with a candlelight vigil in 
San Francisco. The day was intended to mobilize pro-choice forces in the wake 
of last July's U.S. Supreme Court decision giving states more power to restrict 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
The Rancho Park celebration, reportedly the nation's second-largest, drew 
20,000 people, according to Los Angeles police. But rally organizers put the 
figure at 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We're overwhelmed," said John Hoyt, who organized the event for the Greater 
Los Angeles Coalition for Reproductive Freedom. "It's the biggest crowd I've 
ever been in." 
</P>
<P>
The densely packed crowd stretched from the stage near Motor Avenue to a soccer 
field about a hundred yards away, blending into a colorful sea highlighted by 
hot-pink baseball caps bearing the word "Choice" and bright blue "Keep Abortion 
Legal" signs. 
</P>
<P>
Police assigned about 40 officers -- including 10 on horseback -- to the rally 
and said the event was peaceful. But throughout the day, small pockets of 
anti-abortion protesters at the edge of the park confronted pro-choice 
activists, who far outnumbered them. 
</P>
<P>
At one point about six college students -- all members of the conservative 
Young Americans for Freedom -- chanted, "Shame! Shame! Shame!" while dozens of 
pro-choice activists encircled them, drowning them out with shouts of "Choice! 
Choice! Choice!" 
</P>
<P>
"We're outnumbered about 1,000 to one," 25-year-old Craig Denofrio, one of the 
anti-abortion protesters, yelled above the din. "I feel really intimidated." 
</P>
<P>
In another confrontation, a woman approached a group of fundamentalist 
Christians, leaned over and declared to one man: "You're a woman killer. How 
does it feel to be a woman killer?" 
</P>
<P>
She then snapped his picture and walked away, explaining afterward that she is 
a health teacher who deals with pregnant teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Such incidents, however, were rare. Instead, the mood at the park near Century 
City was largely relaxed and festive, with parents and their children enjoying 
the sunshine, elderly people picnicking on blankets and dogs romping about. One 
German shepherd sported a pro-choice T-shirt, prompting a passer-by to remark, 
"Another dog for choice." 
</P>
<P>
The rally kicked off at 12:30 p.m., with the celebrities singing an off-key 
rendition of "America the Beautiful" while many in the crowd waved tiny 
American flags. The song was followed by actress Barbra Streisand, who read the 
text of the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, which legalized the 
right to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Then actress Holly Hunter -- who portrayed "Jane Roe" in a television movie 
about the landmark case -- introduced the real Roe: Norma McCorvey. 
</P>
<P>
"After 16 years," McCorvey told the crowd, "the abortion battle has turned to 
war." 
</P>
<P>
The event, which concluded at about 5 p.m., drew people of all ages -- 
including three pro-choice junior high school students who came without their 
parents. Those who came said they did so for both personal and philosophical 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want women ever to be put upon the way we were," said Marcia Spiegel, 
62, of Rolling Hills Estates. "I saw my friends who had back-room, coat-hanger 
abortions. I'm terrified. I see movement back to a world my grandmother came 
out of." 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Scribner of San Pedro came to Rancho Park with a pro-choice placard in 
her hand, a baby in a pouch strapped across her chest and three other young 
children in tow. "We're living in a man's world," she said. "If men were the 
child bearers, there would be abortion clinics on every street corner." 
</P>
<P>
Explained Paula Williams of Whittier: "I've had an abortion, and I've had a 
child. I know what it's like to carry a child when you want one and when you 
don't, and it's two different things." 
</P>
<P>
Other women at the rally said they, too, have had first-hand experiences with 
abortion. Among them was actress Ali McGraw, who told a hushed audience that 
she ended an unwanted pregnancy before the procedure became legal. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about fear, degradation, potential maiming -- the absolute reality that 
your doctor, if you were lucky enough to have one, would go to jail, the 
probability that you could die," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to stars, the celebration was attended by various elected officials 
who chastised President Bush and Gov. George Deukmejian. In October, Bush 
vetoed legislation that would have authorized federal abortion funding for rape 
and incest victims. In July, Deukmejian cut $24.1 million from the state budget 
for family planning clinics. 
</P>
<P>
California Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) pledged that her fellow 
state legislators would restore the governor's cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're starting a campaign that says, 'This legislature belongs to women, too!' 
" Waters said. "We're starting a campaign to say, 'George Deukmejian, give us 
back our money.' " 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Pat Schroeder (D-Colo.) offered words to another chief 
executive named George. 
</P>
<P>
"George," she said, referring to President Bush, "read their lips."

LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sidney may have a mug only a mother could love, but he is a canine prodigy and 
a genuine celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Kathy Wood, Sidney's owner, who beams with motherly pride as Sidney 
hops on his skateboard for a ride down the sidewalk in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Sidney the 4-year-old English bulldog is a skateboard fanatic, a dog whose 
talents soar above and beyond the usual Frisbee-catching, ball-chasing and 
paw-shaking that is the lot of many lesser dogs. 
</P>
<P>
His feats on the skateboard -- he's also fond of skim boarding -- have landed 
him in People magazine and earned him an invitation to appear on Late Night 
With David Letterman's "Stupid Pet Tricks" segment. 
</P>
<P>
He has also been discovered by a nationwide skateboard manufacturer, appearing 
in the company's promotional videos as a talented and adorable beach bum. 
</P>
<P>
Wood, manager of the Pampered Pet Kennel in Laguna, is thrilled with all the 
attention but declined the invitation to appear with Letterman because she 
didn't want Sidney to fly across the country in the cargo hold of an airplane. 
Sidney flies coach or not at all, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wood picked up Sidney when he was just 2 months old and claims that she never 
actually taught him how to ride his extra wide board. It was just something 
that he took to. 
</P>
<P>
"He just jumped on the back of the board one day while my friend's son was 
skateboarding, pushed the boy off and skated away," she said. "Now I have to 
literally hide his skateboard from him, he loves it so much." 
</P>
<P>
Sidney's technique consists of a two paw on, two paw off stance to build up 
speed, balancing on all four paws on the board and craning his neck towards the 
concrete in an effort to see the wheels when he really gets going. He continues 
skateboarding until the board inevitably crashes into something, at which point 
Sidney turns his body around and continues in the opposite direction -- even 
when the board faces backwards. 
</P>
<P>
Sidney gained greater fame among skateboarders when, by a chance encounter, he 
was chosen to appear in a promotional videotape produced by Santa Barbara-based 
Powell Peralta, one of the nation's largest skateboard builders. 
</P>
<P>
The company discovered Sidney when Wood met the wife of a cameraman who 
produces skateboard videos for the company, according to Jim Fitzpatrick, the 
company's promotions manager and video screenplays writer. 
</P>
<P>
Although dubious about Sidney's skill, the company scripted him anyway in the 
skateboard video "Public Domain." 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we would have to do a lot of staging and manipulation of the dog to 
make the thing work," Fitzpatrick said. "But this idiotic dog knew exactly what 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
In the video, Sidney chases professional skateboarder Lance Mountain, who's 
known as the clown of the sport, off his board and steals it, Fitzpatrick said. 
Mountain tries to retrieve it in the same manner that Sidney stole it -- hiding 
behind a tree and then giving chase -- but he falls flat on his face. 
</P>
<P>
"Robert (the cameraman) came back saying you guys won't believe this," 
Fitzpatrick said. No editing of the raw footage was needed, Fitzpatrick said. 
</P>
<P>
The video generated fan mail from youngsters across the country, many who 
wanted to know if Sidney was Mountain's dog and others asking if Sidney's scene 
was staged, Fitzpatrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Sidney appears in the company's new video to be released later this month, this 
time stealing not only Mountain's skateboard but that of another pro, too. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from his nationwide star status, Sidney has become something of a local 
celebrity as well. 
</P>
<P>
Penny Milne, an animal behaviorist and trainer at Canyon Animal Hospital in 
Laguna Beach, knows Sidney and explains his fondness for skateboarding as "very 
unusual." 
</P>
<P>
"It is something I have never seen in a dog before," Milne said. "Not only 
riding a skateboard is unusual, but what is also interesting is that Sidney is 
interested in anything board-like." 
</P>
<P>
"We all know that dogs will chase after things that are moving and try and bite 
and grab them with their mouth," Milne said. "The fact that Sidney can ride and 
propel these moving objects is what is extraordinary. Most bulldogs are truly 
bull-like. It is unusual to have one as cooperative and bright as Sidney." 
</P>
<P>
Milne said English bulldogs are "an extremely determined and focused breed. 
They have motivation to do what they want rather than what you want. As far as 
the skateboarding talent goes, a bulldog's body shape, with its low center of 
gravity, may contribute, but mainly Sidney is just a character. It's just a 
Sidney quirk."

COUNCIL TO TAKE UP PROSPECT ST. PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday will consider a new proposal for the Prospect 
Street project, where a developer wants to build condominiums and single-family 
homes on a former gravel pit. 
</P>
<P>
The developer, Orange Homes, has plans for 485 condominiums and 73 houses on 
the old Conrock gravel pit. The Planning Commission recommended approval of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1988, the City Council unanimously rejected a proposal by a different 
developer, Silvercrest Corp., to bring 210 manufactured homes onto the site. 
</P>
<P>
The 70.8-acre site is west of Prospect Street, south of Collins Avenue, east of 
Santiago Creek and north of Walnut Avenue.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CONVENTION CENTER GETS FACE LIFTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU FULTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until this year, the first impression created by the Anaheim Convention Center 
could be captured in one word: orange. 
</P>
<P>
Not the muted orange fashionable in today's Southwestern decor, but pumpkin 
orange, tangerine orange, screaming bright orange. To maximize Anaheim's 
identification with Orange County, the interior designers of the city-owned 
building decided to go all out, with orange walls, orange carpeting, orange 
chairs and orange signs. 
</P>
<P>
The orange, accented by dark brown and an occasional splash of blue, wore well 
through the psychedelic era but held little charm in the yuppie-influenced 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"We were starting to get some complaints from clients," acknowledges Ted Lewis, 
the center's operations manager. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim, not wanting to lose any lucrative convention business because of a 
color scheme, decided to spend $10 million to remodel the facility. This will 
be the first facelift in the center's history, with the idea to make the whole 
place look like a giant hotel lobby, said Lynn Thompson, the facility's general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more and more convention sites being developed," Thompson said. "In 
order for (this) convention center to maintain its leadership position, we must 
keep apace with the needs of our clients." 
</P>
<P>
While the remodeling is taking place, a $30-million expansion is happening 
behind the Space Age convention center, which from a distance looks like a 
flying saucer that happened to land across the street from Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion will add 158,000 square feet of space, providing the capacity to 
handle more of the enormous trade shows that provide an increasing amount of 
business to convention centers, Lewis said. The remodeling should be finished 
in about six weeks, with the expansion scheduled for completion early next 
year, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
All 835,000 square feet of the improved convention center will be decorated in 
the colors of the 1990s: soothing teal blue, gray, burgundy and mauve. Many of 
the center's walls have already been painted a pale gray, except for a strip of 
eye-catching orange along the floor soon to be concealed by a black baseboard. 
</P>
<P>
The orange carpeting, spotted by 22 years of spilled drinks and gum stains, has 
been scrapped for a mottled floor covering of burgundy, black and navy blue. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't know the comparison, it's hard to imagine the change," Lewis 
said, "but psychologically, our employees have commented that the colors have a 
much more pleasant feel." 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim has a big stake in improving the convention center because it is a key 
to the tourism industry, the city's largest source of revenue. In 1988, a 
record million delegates attended conventions at the center, generating $1.4 
billion in revenue, according to city statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates spend an average of $1,040 each while staying in Anaheim, providing 
the city with $15.5 million in annual revenues from just the 10% tax paid on 
hotel rooms. Those kinds of figures, and projections that convention center 
attendance will increase 71% in the next two years, persuaded city officials to 
approve the sale of $40 million in bonds to pay for both the expansion and 
modernization of the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Besides more space, the center will gain 1,700 parking spaces and a $2-million 
building for its workers that will house repair shops, break rooms, dressing 
rooms, storage and the like. 
</P>
<P>
With the latest expansion, the center will have more than doubled its capacity 
since opening in 1967 and secured its position as the largest such facility on 
the West Coast. The center has been expanded twice before, in 1974 and 1982, 
but there was never enough money to remodel the place, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
About the only orange left these days is in the uniforms worn by the employees, 
but those are on the way out too. The bright-orange shirts and blazers will be 
giving way to teal-blue coats and gray pants, a uniform designed by Walt Disney 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange served the convention center well," Thompson said, "but it's not very 
orange any more at all." MARY LOU FULTON 
</P>

Photo, FOCUSThe Anaheim Convention Center is midway through a major expansion 
that will result in the facility offering more than double the space it did 
when it opened in 1967. And one of the most noticeable changes is that the 
color orange -- once used to identify everything in the center -- is fading 
fast, to be replaced by lighter blues and grays.; Photo, Anaheim Convention

completed, facility will be double size it was in 1967. DAVID MURONAKA / Los

PEDESTRIAN DIES AFTER BEING STRUCK BY VAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 74-year-old pedestrian died of injuries he suffered in a weekend traffic 
accident, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said John Jakonen of Fountain Valley was walking across Bushard 
Street, just north of Garfield Avenue, about 6 p.m. Saturday when he was hit by 
a van as he stooped to pick up a newspaper he had dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Jakonen was rushed to Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center but 
died shortly after the accident, police said. 
</P>
<P>
No charges or citations were filed, but the investigation is continuing, police 
said.

COUNCIL TO CONSIDER PROPOSAL FOR HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Plans by La Quinta Motor Inns to construct a 168-unit, three-story hotel in 
Garden Grove will be considered tonight when the City Council meets. 
</P>
<P>
The $8-million project, planned for a 2.8-acre site at the northwest corner of 
Haster Street and Garden Grove Boulevard, has been delayed while the city and 
the San Antonio-based developer wrangle over issues raised by the proposed 
hotel's location in the Santa Ana River flood plain. 
</P>
<P>
Under guidelines issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the project 
would have to be elevated five feet to protect it in the event of a flood of a 
severity to be expected once in 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 23, city officials determined that La Quinta was in default of its 
agreement with the city for failing to submit completed plans, including the 
five-foot elevation, by Aug. 30. All the parties are scheduled to try to 
resolve the issue tonight, which could result in a time extension or the 
cancellation of the agreement with La Quinta. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting is scheduled for 7:30 p.m.

COUNCIL WILL WEIGH REZONING PROPOSALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council will decide tonight whether a number of properties on the 
Balboa Pennisula, around McFadden Square and in West Newport will be rezoned 
for low-density residential use. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the properties are currently zoned for commercial or high-density 
residential use. 
</P>
<P>
The rezoning, which would be effective 30 days after adoption, would affect new 
buildings and renovations to existing buildings. Owners also would be prevented 
from subdividing lots. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents have objected to the new zoning because it limits their building 
options. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission initiated the rezoning to help limit the areas' density 
and voted unanimously in favor of it on Oct. 19. 
</P>
<P>
The council meets at 7:30 p.m. at Newport Beach City Hall.

COUNCIL TO CONSIDER RECYCLING PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council will consider a proposal tonight to join a comprehensive 
recycling program sponsored by the South Orange County Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The program includes a range of suggestions, including curbside pickup of up to 
five types of recyclable material and expanded use of drop-off centers. 
</P>
<P>
In a 60-page study of recycling options, the chamber suggests designating days 
for residents to set out different materials, including glass, aluminum and 
plastics. 
</P>
<P>
Such a program could be started for as little as $10,000, the study said. A 
less expensive option would attach newspaper bins to garbage trucks so the 
recyclables could be picked up simultaneously with household waste. 
</P>
<P>
A drop-off center could be launched with $5,000 in equipment and staffing needs 
of 30 to 40 hours a month.

HIGH-TECH RESURRECTS TRADE RITUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dale Williams had the windows of his car tinted, wallpapered his house, bought 
new shoes, and went out to eat at dozens of fine restaurants -- all without 
spending a penny. 
</P>
<P>
No, he didn't steal anything. Williams got those goods and services the 
old-fashioned way: by bartering. 
</P>
<P>
He is among more than 3,000 merchants, laborers and professionals who have 
rediscovered barter through an Orange-based company that offers a high-tech 
version of the ancient trade ritual. 
</P>
<P>
The outfit, Trade American Card Corp., held its annual barter exposition over 
the weekend at the Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa. Williams was among 
hundreds of people who flocked to the event to eyeball the goods jammed into an 
airy exhibit hall. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, I got myself some shoes, and I'm working a deal for some Western boots 
for my daughter for Christmas," said Williams, who trades the services of his 
typesetting and voice mail firm for other merchandise and services. "Through 
the years, I've bartered for a variety of things, just about whatever struck my 
fancy." 
</P>
<P>
Under the Trade American Card system, members who pay a $495 initiation fee can 
sell their goods and services to others in exchange for trade credits instead 
of cash. 
</P>
<P>
Members can then spend the accumulated points on merchandise or professional 
services offered by other members. Anyone can join, as long as they have 
something worthy of barter. 
</P>
<P>
The range of goods and services traded through the computerized system is vast: 
One can barter for a hair transplant or pay for croissants from a bakery. 
Professional services offered by members include behavior modification and 
biofeedback. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 restaurants participate in the system, along with graphic 
artists, locksmiths, lawyers, lawn mower repairmen and landscape contractors. 
An assortment of physicians and dentists can be hired through barter. 
</P>
<P>
"I even gave birth to my daughter on barter -- I traded with my obstetrician," 
noted Sondra Ames, vice president of the Trade American Card network. "And 
we've got a mortician who can offer you a casket. From cradle to grave, we've 
got it all." 
</P>
<P>
Ames helps run the agency with her husband, Michael, who founded the firm in 
the early '70s. Today, more than $1 million a month is bartered by members of 
the network, she said. The only money involved is what participants are billed 
each month for sales taxes and the 10% cut that Trade American Card takes on 
each transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the biggest two days of the year come during the barter expo at 
the fairgrounds. This past weekend was no different: Ames said she expected 
upward of $2 million in bartering to be done. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, the folding tables covered with an assortment of wares -- from 
cooking utensils and computers to stuffed dolls and sports equipment -- gave 
the convention the look of any old swap meet. 
</P>
<P>
But looks can be deceiving. There was nary a dollar bill to be seen. Wallets 
were firmly tucked in purses or pockets. 
</P>
<P>
"You can find almost anything here," said Susan Schapel, owner of a Tustin silk 
flower shop. "I've put all three of my children in braces through barter. I've 
done all my car repairs, 100% of the printing for our shop. And I've done fun 
things, like going out to dinner." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the network members are owners of small, independently operated 
businesses. Services such as printing, medical help for valued employees, car 
repair for commercial vehicles and other work-related services are valued trade 
items, Ames said. 
</P>
<P>
Kimberly Salotti said the barter system has helped her 1-year-old 
designer-clothing firm get off the ground, easing cash-flow problems and 
opening up a whole new market of customers that otherwise might never have 
materialized. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been the best business move I've made," she said, estimating that up 
to 50% of her business has come through the barter association. "It's a 
networking system, and everyone just wants to help." ERIC BAILEY

FOR OPENERS, CAPISTRANO VALLEY HOPES TO END SPELL OF BAD LUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Capistrano Valley High School has earned the top seeding in the Division III 
football playoffs and is expected to be named Orange County's mythical champion 
today by virtue of its 22-21 South Coast League victory over El Toro last week. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the question is: Can Capistrano Valley end a playoff jinx in which it has 
lost in the first round in six of the past seven years? 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley (10-0) opens the playoffs Friday by playing host to Burbank 
Burroughs. If the Cougars win, it will be the first time they have won an 
opening-round playoff game since defeating Los Altos, 30-24, in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
El Modena has beaten Capistrano Valley three times in the first round since 
1984, and the Cougars have been eliminated in the opening round six times since 
they moved to the Southern Section's most competitive division in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, El Toro (9-1) was seeded second in the division and will play host 
to Gahr (7-3) Friday night at Irvine High School. Los Alamitos (9-1) was seeded 
third and defending champion Paramount (9-1) was seeded fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Dana Hills (7-3), the fourth-place team in the South Coast League, received the 
at-large entry over Lynwood (5-5) of the San Gabriel Valley League. Dana Hills' 
losses were to Capistrano Valley, El Toro and Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
"Is there any tougher division than this?" said Bob Johnson, El Toro coach. 
"There are six or seven teams who have a legitimate shot at winning the 
championship, but some of those teams could also get beat in the first round." 
</P>
<P>
John Barnes, who has led Los Alamitos to the division finals the past two 
years, says the 16-team field is one of the strongest since the division was 
formed in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"This division is stronger than Division I," Barnes said. "There's some real 
good offensive teams. There's going to be a lot of scoring." 
</P>
<P>
The most attractive first-round game matches Santa Ana (8-2) against Loara 
(8-1-1) at Western High. The game features two standout running backs -- Coy 
Collins of Loara and Garner Hicks of Santa Ana -- and two of the county's 
winningest coaches -- Herb Hill of Loara and Dick Hill of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Dave White, Edison football coach, said he has had problems explaining to his 
players how the league principals declared Edison (5-0) co-champion with Ocean 
View (4-1) in the Sunset League after Huntington Beach's forfeitures for 
starting an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
But White quickly analyzed the Division I pairings and said, "There's one team 
(Fontana) up here, and then 10 more who could break through with some breaks 
and get to the final." 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Fontana (10-0) is the only undefeated team in the division and will 
play host to Fountain Valley (5-5) in the opening round. Fountain Valley 
qualified for the playoffs when Huntington Beach had to forfeit its victories. 
</P>
<P>
"Fontana is the team to beat because of its physical style of play and great 
winning tradition," said Mike Milner, Fountain Valley coach. Fontana defeated 
Fountain Valley, 21-0, in the 1987 championship at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei, winners of six of its past seven games, travels to the University of 
Redlands Friday to play Redlands. Coach Bruce Rollinson isn't happy about the 
long trip. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought with the degree of difficulty of our schedule and by winning six of 
our last seven games that we would have gotten a game in the county," Rollinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The most interesting first-round game matches Ocean View (7-3) against San 
Gorgonio (7-3) at Huntington Beach High. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Gaytan, former Ocean View coach, led San Gorgonio to a third-place finish 
in his first year. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking the weight room that I helped to build at Ocean View could be 
the difference in the game," Gaytan said. "I understand their line is big and 
strong." 
</P>
<P>
Howard Isom, Ocean View coach, was the defensive coordinator under Gaytan in 
1985. Isom led Ocean View to its first league championship since the school 
opened in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
"Huntington Beach's forfeitures took some of the luster off being in the 
playoffs," Isom said. "I really feel for their kids." 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills and Estancia, two of the county's four teams with 10-0 records, are 
seeded first and second, respectively, in Division VI, and defending champion 
Corona del Mar (7-3) received the at-large entry. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar plays fourth-seeded Pacifica (8-1-1) in a rematch of last year's 
semifinal game that Corona del Mar won, 14-7. 
</P>

"It was one of the best high school games I've been involved in," said Bill 
Craven, Pacifica coach. "We had the ball on their eight-yard line when the game 
ended." 
</P>
<P>
Valencia, which has advanced to three consecutive championship games, was 
unseeded for the first time since 1985 when it shared the title with Western. 
Valencia was seeded first in 1988 and 1986 and second in 1987 and 1984, but 
Coach Mike Marrujo isn't concerned about being unseeded in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter if you're seeded, just as long as you get to the final 
game," he said. "Once we lost the coin flip to Savanna, I knew we wouldn't be 
seeded this year." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor (8-2) plays third-seeded Glenn (9-1) at La Mirada High. Glenn 
won the Suburban League championship, its first title since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Meiss, first-year coach at Orange, had a good idea of what to expect in 
Division VIII after his team qualified for the playoffs for only the second 
time this decade. 
</P>
<P>
"The schools are so spread out, you have to get on the phone to find out about 
them, and then order a bus to play them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Orange (7-2-1) drew a home game against Atascadero (8-2). When Meiss 
learned that Santa Ana Stadium was vacant, he jumped at the opportunity to play 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe Atascadero will get fatigued on the bus ride coming down here," Meiss 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Trabuco Hills (9-1) was seeded second behind Yucaipa (10-0) 
in the division. Trabuco Hills plays host to an at-large entry, Riverside Notre 
Dame (7-3), Friday at Mission Viejo High. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier Christian (10-0) is seeded second in Division IX behind Montclair Prep 
(10-0) and will play host to Leffingwell Christian (3-5) Friday night at 
Whittier College. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Ron Papazian has scored 29 touchdowns for Whittier Christian and 
needs four in the playoffs to break the county mark of 32 set in 1982 by Jim 
Farrell of Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
Hot heats: How hot was it at the Southern Section cross-country preliminaries 
Friday at Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut? 
</P>
<P>
In one heat of the girls' 1-A division, Angela Richardson of Beaumont was in 
fourth place when she hit the air strip portion of the course, about 200 yards 
from the finish line. Had she been able to hold onto fourth, Richardson would 
have qualified for Saturday's finals. But Richardson, overcome by the 
temperatures in the 90s, walked the final 100 yards and placed 10th. Said meet 
announcer Doug Speck: "People walking the air strip? I'd say that sort of 
symbolizes the day." 
</P>
<P>
Edison's Shelley Taylor won her heat in the fastest time for a county girl, 
18:30. University's Tanja Brix, second in 18:48, and Villa Park's Susannah 
Thrasher, third in 19:23, stayed with Taylor through the first 1 1/2 miles. But 
Taylor took over going up Poop Out hill, pulling away with what appeared to be 
little effort. 
</P>
<P>
Last year as a freshman, Taylor finished fourth in the Southern Section finals. 
This year, she is the overwhelming favorite, and it's not something Taylor 
likes to hear. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to say, 'Oh, I'm gonna win,' or something like that," Taylor 
said. "When people say, 'Oh, don't worry Shelley, of course, you'll win, you 
always do!' That makes me real mad. . . . I'm wearing myself out. I expect so 
much from myself. I try so hard to 
</P>
<P>
please everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Woodbridge, Orange County's top-ranked girls' cross-country team and a 
perennial county power, dominated its 2-A heat as its top five finished third, 
fifth, seventh, ninth and 10th to win, with 34 points. The Warriors managed 
without two of their best runners, Kaci Keffer (flu) and Kim Tardif (foot 
injury). Katie Durham, their No. 4 runner, competed despite a severe case of 
shin splints and finished 10th. 
</P>
<P>
"This is by far the finest team we've ever had," Woodbridge Coach George Varvas 
said. "We have so much depth. We have eight quality runners, so we can really 
cover ourselves if someone has a bad race or is hurt." 
</P>
<P>
In this week's finals, Woodbridge again will face Agoura, the defending state 
champion, which won its heat with 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
With the elimination of Corona del Mar's boys' team and Newport Harbor's girls' 
team in the preliminaries, much was said about the Southern Section's playoff 
system in cross-country, and little of it was good. 
</P>
<P>
Although both teams are the defending state champions in the medium schools 
division -- and both are ranked among the top five in the state -- neither will 
be able to defend their titles Nov. 25 at Fresno. This has less to do with how 
the teams ran than it does with the Southern Section's current playoff system. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern Section competition, both Newport Harbor and Corona del Mar, which 
have fewer than 1,300 students, compete in the 4-A division with schools up to 
twice their size. It's not until the state meet -- where schools compete in one 
of three divisions based on enrollment -- that they've been able to compete 
against schools of their size. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, however, teams will enter Southern Section playoffs in divisions 
based on enrollment -- the same enrollment-based divisions as they'll compete 
in at the state meet. This is similar to the system basketball adopted last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, it'll offer some relief to the smaller schools.

GRAND CHAMPIONS TENNIS AT RANCHO SAN CLEMENTE; 
</P>
<P>
YOUTH IS SERVED AS LLOYD WINS THE FINAL

<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe it wasn't the battle of the ages. But when John Lloyd and Hank Pfister 
played Sunday to decide the singles champion in the 35-and-over Prudential 
Bache Grand Champions tennis event, the advantages of youth were evident. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd, who at 35 was the youngest player competing in the event, defeated 
36-year-old Pfister, 6-4, 6-2, at the Rancho San Clemente Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Lloyd and Pfister, who both have retired from the Grand Prix tour, 
appeared out of shape as they ran down and returned many well-placed shots. 
"Not only are we the youngest," said Pfister, "I think we train the hardest." 
</P>
<P>
In the early part of the match, it didn't appear that the going was going to be 
easy for Lloyd. He and Pfister were returning serves well and hitting hard. 
Each broke the other's serve in the first set. 
</P>
<P>
After the early breaks, the two held serve until Lloyd broke Pfister in a game 
in which Pfister double-faulted to go ahead, 4-3. The break cost Pfister the 
set, but he had a chance to regain control early in the second set before 
faltering. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave me three or four Christmas presents on big points," Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
Tied, 2-2, in the second set, Pfister lost his composure and his serve. One of 
his volleys went into the net and the next went long, prompting a vocal 
outburst. 
</P>
<P>
"Come on," Pfister said. "Make him earn it." Pfister then double-faulted. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't do that," said Pfister, who won $5,000 for second place. "It's a 
flip of the coin. You can't make three unforced errors and give him a break 
when you have lost the first set." 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd earned $7,000 and has won three of the five Grand Champions events that 
he has entered. This is his first year on the 10-event tour. 
</P>
<P>
In the doubles final, Bob Lutz of San Clemente won a record 20th Grand 
Champions title, teaming with Sandy Mayer to defeat Sherwood Stewart and Kim 
Warwick, 1-6, 6-3, 7-5. Lutz and Mayer each won $1,400; Sherwood and Warwick 
shared $2,000.

E. GERMANY ELECTS 2 REFORMERS;

PARLIAMENT SHAKES UP LEADERSHIP

<TEXT>
<P>
East Germany's Parliament chose a leading reformer as premier today, and in a 
surprise move elected a moderate non-Communist as its speaker for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Hans Modrow, the new premier, replaces Willi Stoph, who resigned along with his 
44-member Cabinet last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Modrow, 69, is a well-known reformer within the Communist Party, which has been 
headed by Egon Krenz since Oct. 18. Krenz himself has promised some reforms, 
including free elections. 
</P>
<P>
Modrow, the only candidate for the post, is charged with forming a new 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The vote came at the end of an extended session in which the Parliament, until 
now a simple rubber stamp for the ruling party's policies, broke out into the 
open debate it had avoided for four decades. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the body elected a non-Communist, Guenther Maleuda, as its new speaker 
in an unprecedented secret ballot. The ruling Communist Party did not propose a 
candidate for the post. 
</P>
<P>
Maleuda was elected to replace Horst Sindermann, a Communist Party official who 
was sacked from the ruling Politburo last week. 
</P>
<P>
Maleuda surprisingly defeated Manfred Gerlach, chairman of the Liberal 
Democratic Party, who was one of the first politicians to call for broad 
political and economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Maleuda, 58, is chairman of the Democratic Peasants Party, one of the four 
small parties that have been allied with the Communists for 40 years. During 
the political turmoil in recent weeks, the four parties have been cautiously 
exploring ways of becoming more independent. 
</P>
<P>
The elections came after a weekend in which East Germans by the millions 
exercised their new freedom to travel, a right granted by the government to 
counter an exodus of emigres to the West. 
</P>
<P>
East Berliners today began returning to their jobs after four days of frenzied 
celebrations at the newly opened Berlin Wall, and officials said fewer than 1% 
of those who crossed into the West during the weekend chose to stay in West 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 East German visitors still headed West today, West German 
authorities said. The flow of visitors was far slower than during the weekend, 
when more than 3 million people made the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Today, more than 200,000 East Germans marched in Leipzig to demand free 
elections from a government that already has been pressured into granting them 
free travel. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, gathered in the city that has become the focus for protests 
against the East German leadership, demanded the Communist Party abolish its 
monopoly on power. 
</P>
<P>
West German television newscasts estimated the number of protesters at between 
200,000 and 300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, the Communist Party's 163-member Central Committee set Dec. 15 for 
an emergency party congress, which would have the power to elect an entire new 
Central Committee and change party politics. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, French President Francois Mitterrand invited the leaders of the 
European Community countries to a special meeting Saturday in Paris to discuss 
the rapidly changing situation in Europe.

BUSH TRIES TO SOFTEN POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF ABORTION ISSUE

<TEXT>
<P>
The White House sought today to minimize abortion as a political issue in 1990 
and gave belated recognition to Sunday's rallies in the capital and across the 
nation by pro-choice activists. 
</P>
<P>
Striking a conciliatory tone after weeks of strong anti-abortion statements, 
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: "People should take a position on 
this issue according to their strong moral and religious and personal beliefs, 
and that should be the deciding factor -- not politics." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater's comments came as abortion rights activists were pledging to channel 
their energy from last week's election victories into 1990 political campaigns 
to assure that women continue to have freedom of choice. 
</P>
<P>
Despite President Bush's strong sentiments against abortion and his recent 
vetoes of two abortion financing bills, the President welcomed Sunday's capital 
rally, attended by more than 150,000 people, Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly approve of the rally and are glad that they (participants) have 
exercised their right to speak out," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Republican gubernatorial candidates in Virginia and New Jersey, who share 
Bush's anti-abortion views, were defeated in off-year elections last week.

SALVADOR OFFENSIVE MOVES INTO SUBURBS; OVER 150 DEAD IN HEAVY REBEL FIGHTING

<P>
Government troops fired on leftist guerrillas from helicopter gunships in the 
suburbs of San Salvador today in their attempt to defeat a rebel offensive that 
left at least 150 dead in the heaviest fighting of the 10-year-old civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Sporadic bursts of machine-gun and mortar fire echoed through the city as 
rebels dug into positions and the government tried to rout them. 
</P>
<P>
Rightist President Alfredo Cristiani, whose U.S.-backed government had been 
holding peace talks with the guerrillas until last Wednesday, declared a state 
of siege Sunday and the military imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew. 
</P>
<P>
The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) guerrillas started the 
operation with attacks on Cristiani's official and private residences Saturday 
night, but the president was not harmed. 
</P>
<P>
Among the dead was an American, identified as Christopher Babcock of Washington 
state, a teacher at the American School in San Salvador, who was hit in the 
head by a grenade fragment. 
</P>
<P>
An FMLN spokesman, Arnaldo Ramos, said in a television interview that the 
offensive began because "the government has presented proposals that demand 
surrender" and because of an Oct. 31 bomb attack in which 10 people were killed 
at a leftist union headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the number of dead in the 
offensive may be as high as 300, including civilians, guerrillas and soldiers, 
with more than 300 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
A Reuters photographer saw at least five military helicopters firing into the 
streets in the eastern suburb of Soyapango today, scene of some of the heaviest 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of fighting outside the capital were sketchy, but the guerrillas were 
said to have attacked army barracks throughout the country and military sources 
said fighting continued in several areas. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, which gives El Salvador about $1 million a day, blamed 
Nicaragua, Cuba and unidentified Soviet Bloc countries for aiding the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
But presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that the Salvadoran government 
seemed to have the crisis under control and that U.S. involvement in the 
fighting was "not anticipated."

MARCOS SKYSCRAPER ON WALL STREET AUCTIONED FOR A PALTRY $77 MILLION; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: NEW YORK CITY BUILDING SECRETLY BOUGHT BY FERDINAND AND IMELDA 
MARCOS SOLD FOR JUST ABOVE THE MINIMUM ASKING PRICE.

<P>
A 66-story Manhattan skyscraper owned by the ousted late Philippines President 
Ferdinand E. Marcos and his wife, Imelda, was sold at auction in Federal Court 
here today for $77,000,100 -- a price that just barely covered its mortgage and 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The price for 40 Wall Street was only $100 over the minimum price set by 
mortgage holder Citibank to get its investment and expenses back. 
</P>
<P>
The special court-appointed master overseeing the sale, Stephen Estroff, called 
the low price a tragedy, saying it did not look as if the Philippine 
government, which claims the property was secretly bought by the Marcoses, will 
realize any money from the sale. 
</P>
<P>
The price was sharply lower for the building than the $108.6 million it fetched 
when first auctioned off last July. 
</P>
<P>
But the original buyers, real estate developers Ralph and Joseph Bernstein, who 
had a business connection with the Marcoses, could not find the financing to 
complete the deal and now stand to lose a $1.5-million deposit. 
</P>
<P>
The building is one of four properties secretly owned by the Marcoses in 
Manhattan that a Federal Court here has ordered sold off. 
</P>
<P>
The Marcoses were charged with looting the Philippine treasury of more than 
$100 million and then defrauding U.S. banks of $168 million to buy the 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos died in September after being ruled too ill to stand trial but his wife 
faces trial for fraud and conspiracy next March. 
</P>
<P>
The building at 40 Wall Street was bought by a group headed by developer Burton 
Resnick. 
</P>
<P>
The sale was ordered by Federal Judge Pierre Laval and the money is to go into 
an escrow fund until the dispute between the Philippine government and the 
Marcoses over the buildings is settled. 
</P>
<P>
Another building owned by the Marcoses, a 10-floor shopping mall called Herald 
Center, was auctioned off last week for $25 million, its minimum price. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Abrahams, the attorney for Citibank, said the low price for 40 Wall 
Street reflected a soft market for Manhattan real estate. Asked if he was 
surprised, he said, "Nothing surprises me any more in this case." 
</P>
<P>
There are still two more buildings owned by the Marcoses to be sold but no date 
has been set for their auction.

The mother of former Prime Minister David Lange today said she hates her son 
after weekend revelations that he left his wife for his speech writer. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart is full of hatred, and I don't want to speak to him," Lange's 
80-year-old mother, Phoebe, told reporters. "We will all pray that he comes to 
his senses." 
</P>
<P>
Lange, 47, announced he and his wife, Naomi, had separated after 21 years of 
marriage. He gave no reason. 
</P>
<P>
But Wellington's Dominion Sunday Times newspaper quoted his wife as saying in 
an interview that her husband was stolen by his longtime speech writer, 
Margaret Pope. She complained that the couple's three children needed a father.

Lange resigned after five years as prime minister in August, citing health 
reasons. His romance fueled speculation that he would quit politics, but Lange 
said today that he intends to contest his seat at Mangere in next year's 
general election. 
</P>
<P>
As prime minister, Lange clashed sharply with the United States over New 
Zealand's policy of banning nuclear weapons from its territory. 
</P>
<P>
Lange's mother told reporters that her son contacted her last Tuesday to tell 
her he was leaving his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"I was furious. I didn't swear, but I told him in no uncertain terms what I 
thought of him," she said.

Hundreds of University of Massachusetts students chanting "No More Cuts" put up 
picket lines around major classroom buildings today in a boycott protesting 
state budget cuts at the school. 
</P>
<P>
University spokesman Arthur Clifford said it was not immediately clear how many 
students were staying away, but some classes were being held. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Nelson, a junior from Sunderland and a boycott organizer, claimed a 
majority of the morning classes at the 25,000-student university had been shut 
down and students at the university's Boston campus and at the University of 
Lowell were considering joining the protest.

President Bush today named 27 citizens, including medical pioneer Dr. Jonas 
Salk, former Atty. Gen. William French Smith and ex-Dallas Cowboys Coach Tom 
Landry, as advisers for the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"All share my goal of ridding America of illegal drugs," Bush said at a White 
House ceremony where he signed an executive order creating the Presidential 
Drug Advisory Council. 
</P>
<P>
With drug policy director William J. Bennett at his side, Bush gave the 
advisory panel the mission of finding better ways to: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Encourage employers to keep workplaces drug-free. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Enlist the aid "of many Americans who want to volunteer their time and 
energy to winning the war on drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Communicate to all Americans, especially our young, the importance of 
staying off drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Coordinate the multitude of private and nonprofit anti-drug efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Involve the private sector in the building of prisons and jails. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who in September unveiled an anti-drug strategy that will cost nearly $8 
billion, said, "The scourge of illegal drugs upon the lives of many Americans 
is simply devastating, and with the help of this advisory council, I look 
forward to stopping this devastation and guiding our nation toward an 
intolerance of illegal drug use." 
</P>
<P>
The council, given a two-year life span, will be headed by Texas businessman 
William Moss, an oil and gas investor from Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Members, in addition to Salk, Landry and Smith, include: 
</P>

Lebanon's new president designated veteran Muslim politician Salim Hoss as 
prime minister today and Gen. Michel Aoun, the Christian army commander, 
rejected the choice. 
</P>
<P>
Hoss and Aoun have led rival Muslim and Christian governments since the 
six-year term of President Amin Gemayel ended in September, 1988, with 
Parliament unable to agree on a successor. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun issued a statement saying the Hoss nomination was "as unconstitutional as 
the election" Nov. 5 of President Rene Mouawad. 
</P>
<P>
The session at which Parliament elected Mouawad and endorsed a peace plan was 
held in Syrian-controlled north Lebanon because Aoun threatened to shell the 
Parliament building in Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Mouawad, a Christian, instructed Hoss to form a national reconciliation 
government with the mission of ending the 14-year-old sectarian civil war, in 
which more than 150,000 people have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
Police reported exchanges of artillery and small-arms fire across Beirut's 
sectarian dividing line between Aoun's Christian army units and Muslim militias 
backed by Syria. Each side accused the other of starting the battle and no 
casualty reports were available. 
</P>
<P>
A six-month artillery war between Aoun's men and a Muslim alliance led by the 
Syrians killed at least 930 people and wounded 2,744 before a truce arranged by 
the Arab League ended it in September. 
</P>
<P>
Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate 
issued in 1976, the year after the war began. Aoun calls the Syrians an 
occupation force and has declared a "war of liberation" to drive them out.

Presidents and royalty inaugurated the world's largest atom smasher today, a 
pan-European experiment designed to reveal what makes up the universe. 
</P>
<P>
The $750-million machine, called a Large Electron Positron Collider, is a long 
concrete ring running underground at the Franco-Swiss border. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is planning to build an even larger atom smasher, the 
Superconductor Super Collider, in Texas for almost $6 billion. So far, Congress 
has allocated $200 million toward that project. 
</P>
<P>
French President Francois Mitterrand, Swedish King Carl XVI Gustav and other 
European personalities formally opened the LEP, which has already been churning 
out findings since it began running in July. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing a formal inauguration ceremony, Carl Gustav described LEP as a major 
triumph of European scientific cooperation while Mitterrand said it was a 
"giant step in fundamental research." "The world's largest scientific 
instrument will help penetrate the mystery of nature's structure," the French 
president added.

HIGH COURT LETS DETROIT PAPERS JOIN

An evenly divided Supreme Court today upheld the planned partial merger of 
Detroit's two daily newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, by a 4-4 vote, affirmed a ruling that former Atty. Gen. Edwin 
Meese III acted reasonably last year when he approved a joint operating 
agreement for the two papers, the Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970 authorizes the attorney general 
to give financially failing newspapers an exemption from federal antitrust 
laws. Today's ruling was the court's first on a joint operating agreement 
between newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
The partial merger had been challenged by a group of Michigan advertisers and 
readers. 
</P>
<P>
Under the 100-year agreement, the two newspapers would combine their business, 
advertising and production departments but maintain separate news and editorial 
staffs. 
</P>
<P>
The News would receive 55% of the merged company's profits during the first 
year but that percentage would drop to 50% by the seventh year. Thereafter, the 
profits would be evenly divided. 
</P>
<P>
Today's 4-4 vote, which under the high court's rules automatically upheld a 
federal appeals court decision, was set up when Justice Byron R. White 
disqualified himself from the case for unexplained "personal reasons." 
</P>
<P>
A split vote by the justices sets no binding precedent for similar 
controversies in the future, mainly because there is no clue as to the 
reasoning of any justice. 
</P>
<P>
Today's ruling was announced in a one-sentence decision that did not divulge 
which justices voted to allow the partial merger and which voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit News is owned by Gannett Co. Inc., the nation's largest newspaper 
publishing group. The Free Press is owned by Knight-Ridder Inc., the second 
largest. The organizations proposed the partial merger in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the deal, calling themselves Michigan Citizens for an Independent 
Press, contend that the Free Press is not a failing newspaper even though it 
lost $10 million between 1981 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The opponents say the Free Press and the News, which lost $50 million in the 
same period, were unprofitable solely because both papers cut prices in an 
unsuccessful effort to force each other out of business.

Novelist William Styron says that in 1986 he almost joined the ranks of such 
authors as Ernest Hemingway, Virginia Woolf and Jack London who have committed 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"Like many great American writers," Styron wrote in December's Vanity Fair, "I 
used alcohol as the magical conduit to fantasy and euphoria, and to the 
enhancement of the imagination." 
</P>
<P>
But in 1985, Styron's body suddenly rejected alcohol, "which for so long had 
kept my demons at bay." Deprived of this crutch, depression swooped in. 
</P>
<P>
After months of emotional darkness, he said, he redrafted his will, penned a 
suicide note, and threw out a prized personal journal in preparation for 
killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "I drew upon some last gleam of sanity," and the next day checked 
himself into a hospital for treatment.

Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank presented President Bush with a letter 
carrier's cap and bag today as a tribute to Bush's prolific letter-writing, 
then delivered a jesting notice about the bill to taxpayers for the postage. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the traits for which you've become well-known is writing brief 
congratulatory thank-you messages," Frank told Bush after the President gave 
opening remarks to an international postal gathering. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, during your first year as the nation's chief executive, you've 
generated more personal correspondence than many other Presidents during their 
entire administrations," Frank added. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to point out that every one of those has been franked," said the 
postmaster general. A postal frank is free postage provided by the taxpayers 
for the President and for members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, in his speech to the Universal Postal Union, noted that "every week, I 
receive up to 60,000 letters from every state in the union and from nearly 
every country in the world. You can get a lot of free advice in this job."

West Virginia University will play in the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Fla., on 
Dec. 30, with Clemson as the Mountaineers' likely opponent, a newspaper 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Times-West Virginian of Fairmont, quoting "reliable sources," said WVU 
(7-2-1) wanted to play in the Hall of Fame Bowl in Tampa, Fla., on New Year's 
Day but went with the Gator Bowl when the Hall of Fame wouldn't commit. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia Athletic Director Ed Pastilong told the paper he could neither 
confirm nor deny the report. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't locked anything up yet," said Gator Bowl President Charles Hughes. 
"West Virginia is certainly high on our list. So are Penn State and a Big 10 
team." 
</P>
<P>
However, "I think something along those lines (a West Virginia-Clemson game) 
could happen," Gator Bowl Executive Director John Bell told the Florida 
Times-Union in Jacksonville.

BASEBALL'S TRANQUILITY IS ABOUT TO STRIKE OUT;

MAY HAVE A SHATTERING ONE.

<P>
The tranquility Fay Vincent detected between management and players during the 
earthquake-interrupted World Series is not likely to continue for long, to the 
commissioner's chagrin. 
</P>
<P>
Bargaining toward a basic agreement to replace the one that expires Dec. 31 
will begin here this week with preliminary meetings between the owners' 
negotiating team, the Player Relations Committee and the players' union, the 
Major League Players Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Talks are not expected to intensify until the week of Dec. 10, after management 
finishes conducting its business at the winter meetings Dec. 2 to 7 in 
Nashville, Tenn., and the Players Assn. holds its convention at about the same 
time in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
This week, however, Player Relations Committee director Barry Rona will 
officially present to Players Assn. director Donald Fehr an outline of a 
proposed revenue sharing plan, the major thrust in the owners' negotiating 
stance. Already, there are rumblings of skepticism about the plan in the 
union's hall. The sides that seldom agree on anything seem to have another item 
upon which to disagree. 
</P>
<P>
At the general managers meetings last week in Palm Springs, Rona outlined the 
preliminary proposal, which calls for what he termed "a working partnership." 
</P>
<P>
Rona's proposal was for management to divide players into two categories: those 
with experience of six seasons or more and those with experience of fewer than 
six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
For players in the second group, a pay-for-performance scale would determine 
salaries. Money for that would come from a revenue sharing fund of all 26 
clubs. The percentage of the clubs' revenues to be shared would be negotiated. 
Signing of free agents in the first group would be determined by some form of 
salary cap, although Rona prefers not to use that phrase. 
</P>
<P>
"There would be no cap on any player's salary, and there would be no cap on a 
club's payroll," he said. "A club may drive the payroll up to any level, but 
once it reaches a certain plateau it cannot sign other clubs' free agents. 
Clubs must reach the minimum payroll either by doing it on their own or by 
signing free agents, their own players or their own free agents. If not, the 
money must be turned over to the players in a lump sum." 
</P>
<P>
The pay-for-performance scale for players with between zero and six seasons' 
experience would be based on a formula using statistics over two years, similar 
to the Elias Sports Bureau's ranking system to determine compensation for clubs 
losing players to free agency. 
</P>
<P>
The union is critical of management's proposal because it is designed to 
eliminate salary arbitration, a system the Players Assn. wants to continue; the 
association intends to negotiate toward making the system applicable to more 
players. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985 labor talks, the union agreed to limit salary arbitration to players 
with three or more but fewer than six seasons' experience (players with six or 
more seasons can become free agents).

SENSITIVITY HAS COST N.Y. JETS' MCNEIL HIS 1ST-STRING JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN GREENBERG, THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When he was a rookie in 1981, it was a sprained foot. In '83, a separated 
shoulder. In '84, broken ribs. In '86, a dislocated elbow. In '87, a severely 
pulled hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
When three-time Pro Bowl starter Freeman McNeil doesn't have a great season, 
it's usually because of injuries -- his own. 
</P>
<P>
But can he now be having his worst season partly because of injury he caused to 
another? 
</P>
<P>
Sounds absurd, doesn't it? Many people will tell you that the sheer folly of 
trying to run behind the New York Jets offensive line is reason enough for any 
running back to have a bad season. 
</P>
<P>
But in McNeil's case, it seems there's more to it than that. McNeil "suffers" 
from a malady rarely admitted to in the macho world of the NFL: sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
But McNeil's sin was not his sensitivity. His sin was in letting it disturb his 
concentration. Letting it get in the way of his job. 
</P>
<P>
It happened early in the second quarter against the Indianapolis Colts Oct. 1. 
The Jets ran a sweep to the right, Roger Vick the ball carrier. In a clean, 
above-board play, McNeil knocked down Colts linebacker Alston O'Brien with a 
roll block. 
</P>
<P>
When the play was over, so was O'Brien's season. He had torn knee ligaments and 
terrible pain. He would require surgery. Because of McNeil's block, his career 
was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
When he realized what he'd done, McNeil, helpless and heartbroken, lingered 
over O'Brien's fallen form. It was the first time McNeil had been directly 
responsible for another player's injury. Distraught, he took himself out of the 
game and kneeled on the sideline, his head in his hand. He did not play the 
rest of the half. 
</P>
<P>
McNeil played the second half, but he was, he admitted, in a fog. He made 
several mistakes, including lining up in the wrong spot and missing a block on 
a key play inside the Colts' 10. And when the Jets ran a play like the one in 
which Alston was injured, McNeil, faced with another Colts linebacker, hit him 
high rather than low. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, McNeil sought out Alston to see how he was. A Colts publicist 
said there were tears in McNeil's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Jets Coach Joe Walton publicly criticized McNeil after the game for letting the 
team down, for being mentally out to lunch in a game the Jets lost, 17-10. The 
next day, McNeil went to Walton's office and apologized. He apologized for 
losing his concentration. He did not apologize for his emotions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to make any of my emotions wrong," McNeil said later. "I should 
have been able to bounce back, to collect my thoughts and go out there and 
play. The initial contact (with Alston) was devastating. I had lost focus on 
what I was supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks later against the Bills, McNeil still hadn't found his focus. He 
dropped two passes and made a fumble that led to a Bills touchdown. He also 
botched a handoff from quarterback Mark Malone that caused another fumble. He 
missed several blocks. 
</P>
<P>
The next week against the 49ers, Walton moved Johnny Hector into the starting 
lineup. McNeil played only sparingly in the Jets' loss to the 49ers, and in 
their last-second win over the Patriots Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, McNeil touched the ball only once in the first half against the 
Patriots. But when he did, he ran 19 yards for a touchdown. It was the first TD 
the Jets offense had scored in 14 quarters. You'd figure a guy who runs 19 
yards for a TD the first time he touches the ball should be given it more 
often. 
</P>
<P>
But while Hector carried 21 times for 72 yards, a 3.4 average, McNeil -- the 
only active back to average more than four yards a carry in eight consecutive 
NFL seasons -- carried only twice more. When the game was on the line, he was 
on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
McNeil, genuinely proud of being a team player, refuses to gripe. It's part of 
life, he said, just a brief "down" he'll use to increase his resilience and 
determination. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to say that I'm this or I'm that," McNeil said, "but I'm a man 
built on emotion. There has to be a certain emotion, a passionate feeling, for 
me to enjoy something." 
</P>
<P>
McNeil's sensitivity to the plight of others has always made him an All-Pro off 
the field. He is active in the United Way, Big Brothers, MS, Students Against 
Drunk Drivers, and a Long Island-based anti-hunger crusade founded by the late 
folk singer, Harry Chapin. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not a charity thing he turns down," said Jets publicist Ron Cohen. 
"He'd rather go to one of those things than a paid speaking engagement. Because 
then he's not obligated to anything but his values." 
</P>
<P>
When Hurricane Gloria hit in September, 1985, McNeil drove around Long Island 
in his pickup truck, helping stranded motorists. During the off-season and on 
virtually every Tuesday during the season -- the players' day off -- McNeil 
visits schools and speaks to kids about drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some things that are so important that you don't even think about 
yourself," McNeil said. 
</P>
<P>
But when you lose your starting job, there is more time to think. Isn't it a 
bit depressing to realize that the very traits that make Freeman McNeil such a 
good person are hindering his career? Just as doctors must harden themselves to 
death so they can have the emotional energy to help the living, so must an 
athlete avoid getting so caught up in another's misfortune to the degree that 
it affects his own performance. 
</P>
<P>
In the Jets media guide, Walton called McNeil "an excellent team leader. . . . 
We have learned to expect only the best from him." 
</P>
<P>
It would be nice if we could again see Freeman McNeil at his best on the field. 
But it's not as important as the good he does off it. Or as enduring.

BETTING THE SYSTEMS: PARLAY SHOW BETS -- AND GO HOME HAPPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN DASH, TIMES STAFF WRITER Dash is the author of two books, Great 
Betting Systems and Win With Great Betting Systems. His column, Great Betting 
Systems, ran weekly for two years in the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many years ago at one of the horse racing books in Las Vegas, two youths were 
down to their last $2 after blowing their money on craps. Losing the $2 meant 
finding a job or looking for handouts, and neither idea was really a good one 
in Las Vegas. After much debate, they decided, as any gambler would, to bet the 
$2 to show on a horse they had picked from the Racing Form. They won. Feeling 
lucky, they decided to bet their entire bankroll to show on another nag. Again 
they won! Needless to say, they won nine straight show bets, parlaying their 
money after each win. Thus, they ended up with about $83, which bought them 
dinner and got them back to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, they had played one of my favorite systems. If you're the sort who 
can't stand to take the time to handicap, who finds the small type just so much 
gibberish but who enjoys the thrill of racing, the roar of the crowd and a 
small wager now and then -- a show parlay on public favorites may be just your 
cup of tea. Even if you're a hardened race track veteran, an old warhorse 
looking for a sure thing, this system could be for you. A show parlay on 
favorites might be just right when your money starts dwindling or when the 
races aren't all that promising. 
</P>
<P>
If you simply stick to making automatic show bets on public favorites, the 
system, of course, eliminates all thinking. Instead of going through a maze of 
calculations that might complicate a pleasant day at the track or force you 
into taking aspirin for a headache, simply scan the totalizator board, an 
electronic device in the infield in front of the grandstand, club house and 
turf club that records all betting on win, place and show. Best of all, when 
most everyone goes home a loser, you, happily, can end up with a profit! 
</P>
<P>
 The horse with the most money wagered on it to win and the one with the lowest 
odds becomes the public favorite every race, day in and day out. It also 
becomes your choice to show. 
</P>
<P>
 It's that simple! Nothing complicated. 
</P>
<P>
What the system requires, however, is patience at the beginning as you're 
building up your bankroll. Heavy favorites -- and you keep betting them no 
matter how low the odds drop -- may put a lid on your profit, particularly 
during the first three or four races, but don't despair. It may seem boring at 
first but, believe me, it gets exciting as you keep winning. 
</P>
<P>
At this stage of the system, you shouldn't be concerned with how much you're 
betting or winning, but only with continuing the show parlay. Remember, winning 
all races without a loss is your main objective. It's what will get you a big 
payoff for a small investment. 
</P>
<P>
When winnings begin to increase more than 500%, that's when bettors will need 
all their will power. The problem with many horse players is that they 
genuinely intend to parlay all nine races. However, when actually faced with 
making a large bet, they suddenly decide that a buck in the hand is worth two 
in the bush. So they quit and take their profits or they pull back part of 
their winnings and continue the system. 
</P>
<P>
True, they're ahead of the game. But what they fail to realize is that getting 
ahead is only a means to an end. When in front, say $25, their risk is still 
only $2 -- their original investment! 
</P>
<P>
Consider the story of the hard-nosed race track gambler who parlayed eight 
straight win bets from $2 to $25,000. He lost the $25,000 on the ninth race. 
When he got home, his wife asked him how he came out for the day. 
</P>
<P>
"I dropped two bucks," he answered. 
</P>
<P>
This should be your attitude. You've got to go all the way and forget any 
intermediate profit. 
</P>
<P>
What are your chances of show parlaying all nine races? 
</P>
<P>
Seemingly astronomical! Still, it's a lot better than making a bet based on the 
length of a horse's tail or the color of the jockey's eyes. As a matter of 
fact, your chances are pretty good when you consider that public favorites at 
race tracks across the United States win about 28% to 32% of their races. Also, 
figures disclose that these same favorites run in the money about 60% of the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
So exactly how does the system work? 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 8, 1989, the fifth day of the Oak Tree season at Santa Anita race 
track, all nine favorites ran in the money. Here's what they paid for show:

After deducting the $2 you bet on the first race, your profit for the nine 
races would have been $70.50. 
</P>
<P>
And don't for a minute think nine favorites rarely show. It's less of a long 
shot than you might imagine. On Oct. 14, at the same Oak Tree meeting, the 
favorites again ran in the money. Here's what they paid: 1. Go Steady Lad, $3; 
2. So This Is It, $3.60; 3. Feeling Tipsy, $2.40; 4. Tight Spot, $2.40; 5. 
Movinglikeawinner, $3; 6. Love Beat, $2.40; 7. Dramatic Joy, $2.60; 8. 
Hawkster, $3.40; 9. Smart Deception, $2.80. 
</P>
<P>
Your profit, after deducting the $2 initial bet, would have been $31.90. Not as 
much as on Oct. 8, but still a substantial amount for $2. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, if you're a conservative bettor, you'll never go for broke on all 
nine races. What you should do is set a win limit. This can be any amount. No 
matter what the limit, however, make sure it's set at the beginning of 
wagering. And once the amount is reached, you can start over again with your 
original bet or you can cut your profit in half and start over. Either way, 
you'll end up winning for the day. 
</P>
<P>
Also, no matter how you bet, if you win a few races and then lose, don't worry. 
Just begin again. Under no circumstances, however, do you increase your bet. 
Many times, when I lost the fourth or fifth race, I started over with a $2 bet 
and I still ended up with a profit for the day. I didn't break the bank, but I 
didn't lose either. The point is, losing one race isn't a catastrophe. Just 
stick with the system. 
</P>
<P>
And if your Aunt Minnie wins more often by picking names out of a hat or your 
Uncle Max wins big by wagering on the names of his nieces and nephews, don't be 
discouraged. Continue the show parlay. 
</P>
<P>
And what happens when you run out of dough? You won't really, because you're 
not investing all that much. In any case, don't go looking for the city's 
tallest building. At least, you'll have to admit, it was fun while it lasted!

ST. LOUIS' DURHAM, OAKLAND'S BANDO FILE FOR FREE AGENCY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oakland catcher Chris Bando and St. Louis first baseman Leon Durham filed for 
free agency today, leaving a record 90 free agents available. 
</P>
<P>
There would have been one more, but Tim Teufel, who had filed earlier, agreed 
today to a new contract with the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
The deadline to file was 1 p.m. EST and the 90 free agents topped the previous 
record of 89, set in 1977. The deadline for filing also was the time clubs 
could begin to make monetary offers to free agents. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Rice, who was eligible for free agency, did not have to file because the 
Boston Red Sox placed him on waivers today. Rice, who has spent his entire 
15-year career with Boston, will become a free agent without compensation 
Thursday.
