The Toronto Maple Leafs ended a six-game losing streak with a 5-2 victory over 
the Winnipeg Jets Monday night and ruined Ed Olczyk's return to Maple Leaf 
Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
The Maple Leafs traded Olczyk and Mark Osborne to the Jets Saturday for 
defenseman Dave Ellett and forward Paul Fenton. 
</P>
<P>
Olczyk's first shift in the second minute of the first period was greeted with 
polite applause from the announced crowd of 15,612. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd gave Olczyk a mixed review when he snapped Osborne's pass over Jeff 
Reese's glove at 5:27 of the second period to slice Toronto's lead to 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto's Doug Shedden, who has spent most of the last four seasons in the 
minors, scored his first NHL goal since 1986 at 7:54 of the first period. 
Shedden scored again at 10:50 to make it 2-0, and Vincent Damphousse and 
linemate Dan Marois combined to make it 3-1 at 17:46 of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
The Leafs, turning in their best defensive effort of the season, outshot 
Winnipeg, 33-23.

Steve McKinney, 37, a daredevil who skied at more than 100 m.p.h. and once flew 
a hang glider off Mount Everest, was killed when the stranded car in which he 
was sleeping was struck by another vehicle near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said that McKinney's car apparently suffered mechanical trouble 
on Interstate 5 early Saturday and McKinney had climbed onto the back seat to 
sleep before seeking help.

If the Chargers' offense is predictable, it doesn't bother Coach Dan Henning. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to be whatever you want to call us, and win four out of every 
five and have no interceptions and one legitimate fumble in five games," he 
said. "Predictable. 
</P>
<P>
No imagination. All the comments that I've heard in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally when you end up with a tendency it's because you're doing something 
pretty good, because you keep going back to it until somebody stops it. We have 
a tendency to run (Marion) Butts." 
</P>
<P>
Running back Ronnie Harmon performed more than adequately in relief of the 
injured Rod Bernstine Sunday, carrying 10 times for a 7.1-yard average. What 
keeps him from carrying the ball more when Bernstine is healthy? 
</P>
<P>
"He makes things happen in the hole, but there are times that Bernstine or 
Butts, when things get closed up in there tight, may push for another yard or 
two," Henning said. "Ronnie doesn't have the same kind of push." 
</P>
<P>
Bernstine missed Sunday's game with a hamstring injury. Henning said it won't 
be known until Wednesday whether Bernstine will be healthy for Sunday's game at 
Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Tackle Leo Goeas, whose foot was injured when he was stepped on in Sunday's 
19-7 victory over the Broncos, is expected to be healthy enough to practice 
this week. Henning said the Chargers had no significant injuries after the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said the original plan to use linebacker Gary Plummer on offense came 
in training camp when the Chargers waived Joe Mickles, a Plan B running back 
acquired from the Washington Redskins during the off-season. Plummer scored the 
Chargers' only touchdown Sunday on a one-yard run. . . . A sack credited to 
cornerback Donnie Elder Sunday has been changed to a half-sack shared with 
linebacker Leslie O'Neal. DON PATTERSON

MANCILLAS QUITS POST AT CASTLE PARK

<P>
Jorge Mancillas, head football and track and field coach at Castle Park High 
School, has resigned from those positions citing time and family commitments as 
the primary reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been coaching for 15 years, and I just felt like I needed a break," said 
Mancillas, 38. "I feel I have more of a responsibility to my family." 
</P>
<P>
Mancillas, who played defensive line for the Castle Park team that won the 1968 
county championship, has coached at the school for seven years, including the 
past two as head football coach. The Trojans finished 5-5 this year, fourth in 
the Metro Conference, after going 4-6 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Mancillas, who teaches Spanish and physical education as well as helping with 
the wrestling team, said he will remain in those capacities. He also did not 
rule out returning to coaching football. 
</P>
<P>
"If they make me an offer I can't refuse, I won't," Mancillas said. 
</P>
<P>
Castle Park could have received an at-large bid in the 3-A Division football 
playoffs. However, the coach must be present at the seeding meeting for the 
team to be considered, and Mancillas chose not to attend Saturday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"We set a goal at the beginning of the year," Mancillas said. "If we finished 
third in the league or better, we'd go. We were 3-4 in the league and I didn't 
want to go into the playoffs with a losing record. I don't think a team that 
finishes fourth in any league should go to the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Falling short of the goal was the main reason Mancillas did not attend 
Saturday's meeting, but he also said injuries have reduced Castle Park's roster 
to 33 players and only five offensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
The Helix girls' volleyball team is steaming mad . . . and with good reason. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders (30-0) are the only undefeated team in the county but they 
remain unranked in state polls and are mentioned in 'the best of the rest' in 
the national rankings. Meanwhile, Torrey Pines (23-2) is ranked third in the 
state and Poway (20-4) is fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting more and more mad," Helix Coach Mike Welch said. "It's really 
disappointing. The girls have worked very hard and they're never recognized." 
</P>
<P>
Helix did earn the top seeding in the Division II playoffs and will play 
unranked Monte Vista (26-8) at 7:30 tonight in the semifinals at Serra High 
School. Torrey Pines, seeded second, will play third-seeded Escondido (13-6) at 
5 at Serra High School. 
</P>
<P>
This will be the third meeting between Helix and Monte Vista, which finished 
first and second in the Grossmont 3-A League. Helix defeated Monte Vista twice, 
both in close matches. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have preferred them to be in the other bracket," Welch said, "but I'm 
also really happy to see two Grossmont 3-A teams in the semifinals." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's Ramona-Clairemont volleyball match had to be rescheduled after 
referees failed to show up. The teams will play their Division III quarterfinal 
match at 4 p.m. today at Ramona. The winner will then play USDHS on Wednesday 
in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
It's not unusual to find football fans dancing in the stands when their team 
makes a big play. But during home games at Mission Bay, a 20-piece jazz 
ensemble gives the fans something else to dance about. The band has forsaken 
march cadences and fight songs for hip funk riffs and verses of jazz standards. 
</P>
<P>
The unique format was the idea of band director Rey Vinole, an actor/musician 
who attended Mission Bay and played in garage bands with former classmate and 
rock innovator Frank Zappa during the 1950s. Vinole's band is so popular the 
school allowed a parent to build a grandstand stage next to the pressbox, and 
community groups frequently call on the students to play for them. 
</P>
<P>
"They're tremendously popular on campus," Vinole said, "but they much prefer to 
go out and do a gig. They really feel like they're professionals." 
</P>
<P>
The band plays for free but often receives donations for the Mission Bay music 
program, much needed in the wake of Proposition 13 budget cuts. The ensemble 
has grossed $1,800 since September, and Vinole expects it to raise more than 
the record $3,000 it did last year. Vinole said many former students have gone 
on to successful entertainment careers in Hollywood, Las Vegas and Broadway. 
The band's next school engagements will be at home boys' basketball games.

Despite winning its final three football games on the road and finishing 7-2 
for the second year in a row, the University of San Diego was not selected to 
participate in the NCAA Division III playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Of 288 schools, only 16 are selected. 
</P>
<P>
With big victories over Azusa Pacific, 21-10, and Menlo College, 28-14, in 
their last two games, the Toreros were under consideration for their first 
berth since 1973. Redlands, which defeated USD, 28-14, earlier in the year, 
finished 8-1 and was the only West Coast school to make the playoffs, which 
begin Saturday. JIM LINDGREN

Parliament empowered the Romanian government Monday to rule the economy by 
decree and speed up reforms aimed at building a free-market system after four 
decades of communism. 
</P>
<P>
Both chambers of Parliament voted by an overwhelming majority to give Prime 
Minister Petre Roman special powers. Roman had requested them in a report on 
the economic reforms he presented to Parliament Oct. 18. 
</P>
<P>
He had demanded a free hand to declare emergency economic measures over the 
next six months. 
</P>
<P>
This includes the power to change taxes and duties and to negotiate foreign 
credits without referring to Parliament.

President Fernando Collor de Mello has proposed doubling the number of 
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, admitting Japan, Germany, 
India, Brazil and an unspecified African country. 
</P>
<P>
Television and newspaper reports said the Brazilian president made the 
suggestion in brief talks in Tokyo on Sunday with Japanese Prime Minister 
Toshiki Kaifu. 
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian idea is that the five suggested new members would not have a 
veto. The existing permanent members, the United States, Soviet Union, China, 
Britain and France, all have veto power. 
</P>
<P>
Total membership of the Security Council is currently 15.

VOTERS OK OF TERM LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, an elected official displays disdain and arrogance for the people 
he governs. State Sen. Robert Presley ("Taking California Back to Amateur 
Status," Commentary, Nov. 8) believes that only self-serving, "experienced" 
professional politicians can serve their constituencies well because they are 
more competent and experienced and obviously understand the issues much better 
than the people whose lives are affected by their legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Personally, I feel that the electorate should have the widest latitude in 
electing individuals who will serve them honestly and that we already have the 
ability to vote out, recall or impeach those who compromise the public trust. 
And yet I cannot support the paternalistic argument that insiders know what is 
best for us. The current state of affairs -- locally, regionally and nationally 
-- shows this argument is false. 
</P>
<P>
If experience equalled good leadership, we would not see the great schism 
between the haves and have-nots, fiscal irresponsibility at all levels of 
government, diminished strength in several sectors in our economy and an 
alienated electorate that feels its voice stifled in the cacophony of 
special-interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
Those who serve the public well are those individuals who are true leaders -- 
those who have a commitment to act in the best interests of the community, 
those who have fresh ideas and common sense and will tackle problems in 
innovative ways and those who consider issues dispassionately and thoughtfully. 
Experience has its place, but by no means should it be the deciding factor.

THEY GOT THE WRONG GUY; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT, NOT CNN, IS HURTING NORIEGA TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cable News Network will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a lower court's 
order banning it from airing taped telephone conversations between deposed 
Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega and his legal defense team. CNN argues, 
correctly, that any attempt to prohibit it from airing the tapes that have come 
into its possession is a prior restraint on its constitutional freedom to 
gather and disseminate news. That freedom embodies a principle so vital to 
safeguarding individual liberties and so basic to bolstering democratic 
processes that the high court should not -- cannot -- have any problem in 
crushing this effort at censorship. 
</P>
<P>
The storm over the Noriega tapes is seen by some as a fundamental clash between 
equally imperative constitutional rights. On one side is the First Amendment's 
guarantee of a press unfettered by governmental efforts to dictate what may be 
reported. On the other side is the Sixth Amendment's assurance that anyone 
accused of a crime must have a fair trial. Two rights, each of consummate 
importance. But are they truly in conflict here? No, because in broadcasting a 
government-made recording of a telephone conversation between Noriega and an 
employee in his lawyer's office, CNN did nothing to undercut his right to an 
impartial trial. 
</P>
<P>
It acted instead, faithful to the highest standards of selfless journalism, to 
protect that right. For if Noriega's defense has in any way been compromised 
because his telephone calls were improperly taped, then clearly it is the 
government that recorded those calls that should be called to account. It is 
not CNN, which has acted only as the instrument for exposing possible 
governmental misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Prisons, which operates the federal facility near Miami where 
Noriega is being held, informs prisoners that their telephone calls may be 
taped. Noriega was so warned and signed a paper last January acknowledging that 
he understood the policy. But not all calls are routinely taped. To protect the 
confidentiality of lawyer-client relations, conversations on legal business are 
not to be monitored. A prisoner need only notify authorities if his requested 
phone call involves legal business. At that point the taping system is supposed 
to be turned off. 
</P>
<P>
CNN and Noriega's lawyers have now agreed that the network will refrain from 
broadcasting any more tapes until the Supreme Court rules on CNN's appeal. So 
far it has played one of the seven tapes it has on the air, in defiance of a 
restraining order and at the risk of being held in contempt. 
</P>
<P>
Now the issue is about to go to the Supreme Court. Never before in the nation's 
history, says noted First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams, has the court affirmed 
a lower court attempt to censor beforehand what a news organization may report. 
It would be astonishing if it were to do so here. 
</P>
<P>
CNN has done nothing to jeopardize a fair trial for Noriega. It has revealed 
activities by the government that in themselves may put the guarantee of a fair 
trial at risk. Exposing those activities isn't a crime, but a public service.

CHRISTMAS GIFT TO THE ECONOMY; 
</P>
<P>
WHY THE FED SHOULD LOWER INTEREST RATES ANOTHER NOTCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The economy is beginning to resemble a patient with many more ailments than any 
one doctor can keep track of. The question seems not to be whether there will 
be a recession but whether it will be a deep one and a long one. Predictions of 
a severe economic winter are so commonplace that the rare economic optimist is 
wisely staying indoors and keeping his curtains closed to avoid ridicule. 
</P>
<P>
What must be kept in plain view through all the doom and gloom, however, is the 
nation's ability to control its fate. To a greater extent than in the past, the 
nation possesses the tools to try to direct the economy out of its current 
malaise. One such tool involves lowering either the discount rate or the 
federal funds rate. The latter was lowered a quarter point late last month. 
</P>
<P>
Lowering either one would help. 
</P>
<P>
It would help stimulate a lethargic economy, make new funds available to 
investors and consumers and provide a welcome psychological boost. The argument 
against a lowering is that it would contribute to inflationary pressures. 
Indeed, the fear of fueling inflation is always one of the reasons, if not the 
main reason, the Federal Reserve in recent years has held back and resisted 
calls to lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
That's the responsible posture, but in the current economic climate soaring 
fuel costs are contributing to inflation, yet little else is. Alan Greenspan, 
chairman of the Federal Reserve's board of governors, must understand that it 
would be prudent to lower rates a quarter point. That won't cure the economy's 
many ills, but it won't worsen the fever by denying needed and readily 
available medication. Another quarter point downward would hardly be a euphoric 
drop, but along with the previous quarter-point drop, it would suggest a trend 
line of confidence and conviction.

VOTERS OK OF TERM LIMITS

I found Robert Presley's lament most entertaining. The passage of Proposition 
140 does not necessarily indicate that the majority of the people of California 
have lost faith in the professionalism of their legislators. 
</P>
<P>
It just might, however, indicate that the people have come to believe their 
legislators have been just a little too professional at the wrong things, i.e., 
collecting honorariums, soliciting bribes, selling votes and attending 
fund-raisers while allowing "immense social and economic problems" to go 
unsolved and even unaddressed. Frankly, the legislators of the California 
Assembly and Senate have only themselves to thank for the passage of 
Proposition 140.

While I understand the public's frustration with the system, term limits are 
not the proper cure. There are more appropriate means of ensuring turnover and 
restoring faith in the process. 
</P>
<P>
One is meaningful campaign-finance reform, including reducing rates for 
political advertising and challenging the U.S. Supreme Court's 1976 ruling 
equating campaign spending with free speech. Last year, I proposed spending 
limits on California races to challenge the court decision, and I'll push the 
legislation again this time. 
</P>
<P>
The most needed change is true grass-roots politics. I was told by all the 
"experts" not to challenge an incumbent two years ago. Incumbents can be 
defeated (four Assembly members lost last week), but challengers need spirited 
grass-roots campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Why hard work instead of term limits? Because some incumbents should be booted 
out, but the good ones should stay awhile. As a freshman legislator, I turned 
to experienced colleagues for advice on complex policy issues. Who will all the 
freshmen in 1997 turn to after Proposition 140 takes effect? Lobbyists 
representing special interests, rather than a colleague who represents the 
public interest and who has built up expertise in key issue areas.

DOES LAMING THE LEGISLATURE UPSET THE CONSTITUTION?; 
</P>
<P>
THE LEGAL VIEW: THIS SHIFT IN THE BALANCE OF POWER MAY GO BEYOND THE AUTHORITY 
OF INITIATIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD F. UELMEN, Gerald F. Uelmen is dean of Santa Clara University School 
of Law and president of the California Academy of Appellate Lawyers.

<TEXT>
<P>
Proposition 140 will accomplish a huge shift in the balance of political power 
in Sacramento. Term limits will mean business as usual for the executive 
branch. Throughout California's history, only Gov. Earl Warren served more than 
two terms. The Legislature, however, has seen a succession of leaders whose 
power emanates from longevity. 
</P>
<P>
It is highly unlikely that first-term senators, or even second-term Assembly 
members, will be selected Assembly Speaker or president pro tem of the Senate, 
or even be appointed to chair key committees. The effect of the term limits is 
that we will see a succession of Assembly speakers every two years, with every 
Speaker being a "lame duck" from day one. 
</P>
<P>
Since term limits are prospective, Gov.-elect Pete Wilson, if he serves two 
terms, may have to deal with Willie Brown and David Roberti for six more years. 
But future governors will see a regular change of legislative leadership every 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
This fundamental shift of power offers the strongest constitutional challenge 
to the validity of Proposition 140. While the initiative was sold as a check on 
the entrenched power of political incumbency, the real agenda was a shift of 
political power away from the legislative branch and into the executive branch. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the electorate is free to accomplish such fundamental shifts by 
changing the Constitution. The real issue, however, is whether such changes can 
be achieved by initiative, as opposed to a constitutional convention or a 
legislatively approved proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The state Constitution originally provided two methods for change: a convention 
of delegates to revise it, or a proposal enacted by both houses of the 
Legislature to amend it. Either method required a vote of the people in favor 
of the constitutional change. But the distinction between revision and 
amendment reflected a preference for greater deliberation before truly 
fundamental changes were enacted. 
</P>
<P>
When the power of the initiative was added to our state Constitution in 1911, 
the distinction between a revision and an amendment was preserved. Gov. Hiram 
Johnson's measure provided that initiatives could only amend the Constitution, 
still reserving the power to revise to a constitutional convention. Johnson was 
very familiar with the distinction. He served as co-counsel with his father in 
an 1893 case in which they successfully argued that a constitutional change 
should be struck down because it was so fundamental it amounted to a revision. 
The proposal would have established a commission with the power to move the 
state capital from Sacramento to San Jose. That case is still the leading state 
Supreme Court precedent. 
</P>
<P>
In 1966, the power to revise the Constitution was extended to legislative 
proposals. Thus, only initiative measures are now precluded from revision of 
the Constitution. Only initiative proposals go directly on the ballot without 
an opportunity for public debate and correction of drafting flaws. Proposition 
140 has its share of flaws. The measure, for example, leaves out the new office 
of insurance commissioner from its term-limit provisions. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, despite upholding Proposition 13, the California Supreme Court 
recognized that "even a relatively simple enactment may accomplish such 
far-reaching changes in the nature of our basic governmental plan as to amount 
to a revision." Thus, the length or complexity of a measure does not determine 
whether it is a revision or an amendment. 
</P>
<P>
The court is considering a challenge to Proposition 115, the crime initiative 
adopted by the voters in June, on the grounds that it too is a revision of the 
Constitution beyond the power of an initiative. The measure also accomplishes a 
fundamental shift of power, stripping state courts of the authority to construe 
state constitutional rights more expansively than the federal courts construe 
the federal Constitution. A decision is likely before the end of the year, and 
the case will be closely watched for its potential impact on Proposition 140. 
</P>
<P>
But even if the challenge to Proposition 115 succeeds, the decision may not 
help the legislative leadership. The fundamental changes wrought by Proposition 
115 are a direct and immediate result of changes in the language of the 
Constitution itself. The changes wrought by Proposition 140 will play 
themselves out as more subtle and gradual shifts of power. 
</P>
<P>
However subtle and gradual, Proposition 140 will mark an important change in 
the relationship between future governors and legislative leaders. Despite the 
bashing of the current legislative leadership, the long-term implications of 
this fundamental shift were barely discussed during the campaign. That's one of 
the problems with initiative measures. The real issues tend to get lost in the 
sound bites and slogans.

ONLY BUMS WILL RUN, ONLY BUMS WILL RULE; 
</P>
<P>
THE POLITICOS: BY POISONING THE CLIMATE FOR POLITICIANS, WE'RE DRIVING OUT THE 
GOOD PEOPLE THAT TERM-LIMIT PROPONENTS HOPED TO ATTRACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN ORNSTEIN, Norman Ornstein is resident scholar of the American 
Enterprise Institute, a public- policy think tank, in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This has been a banner year for anti-politicians. Ralph Nader has raised huge 
sums of money with direct-mail appeals bashing Washington; Jim Wheaton, head of 
the California chapter of Common Cause, spearheaded the state's term-limitation 
drive; businessman Jack Gargan began a national movement and organization to 
throw all incumbents out. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the anti-politician talk has been cynical manipulation of the polls and 
public sentiment for partisan and individual advantage. But a great deal of it 
has been motivated by real concerns that our system is not working, that we 
need different and better people running for office and in office. Those with 
pure motives will sadly find their efforts not just futile but 
counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
America's distaste for politicians has a rich historical tradition. But in 
years and decades past, we still reserved some considerable respect for those 
willing to devote a portion of their lives to public service. Reasonable 
people, accomplished people, good people, could still find many good reasons to 
run for elective office and to devote some time, energy and attention to public 
service. 
</P>
<P>
These days, however, the distaste for politicians has deepened, whipped up with 
intensity by anti-politicians like Nader, Wheaton and Gargan. The result is a 
soured climate in which all politicians and the field of public service 
generally have been tainted with a broad brush of venality, corruption, 
selfishness, cowardice and immorality. Add to this the web of 
conflict-of-interest regulations, the zeal of press and pundits for poking into 
private lives and the financial and family sacrifices required for many to move 
to Washington or state capitals for service in elective office. Does anybody 
really expect that the result will be a large, fresh group of our best and 
brightest jumping up to run for office in the future? 
</P>
<P>
Not many rational people of accomplishment and means are going to make 
substantial sacrifices to compete for a job in which they will immediately be 
labeled criminals or worse -- including those noble citizens who 
term-limitation proponents hope to make "citizen legislators." By poisoning the 
climate for politicians generally, anti-politicians are busily ensuring that 
our future candidates for office are more likely to be deadbeats or demagogues 
who will exploit the anti-political climate for their own ambitions, with 
little concern for the consequences of what they do in their limited terms of 
office; taking short-term advantage of policies that may have great long-term 
costs will be more, not less, tempting for them. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-politicians' burn-and-slash approach punishes politicians by limiting 
terms, capping pay, cutting pensions and destroying perks, but does nothing to 
enhance real competition in elections or to encourage top-flight political 
challengers. Their major contribution is to take away whatever limited 
incentives now exist and poison the climate even more. 
</P>
<P>
As "throw the bums out" moves from selectively separating the bums from the 
good guys and toward identifying all politicians as bums, we will come ever 
closer to a self-fulfilling prophecy -- only the bums will run, and rule.

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prospects for peace in the Middle East caused the Dow Jones Industrial Average 
to gain 96.5 points, or nearly 4%, over the past two trading days, according to 
Irving Katz, director of research for Thomas Green/San Diego Securities. The 
true impact of current events on the nation's economy is now becoming more 
apparent, Katz said. "We are in, or are heading into, a recession, which can 
now be talked about since the election is over," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
The recession is being exacerbated by a loss of consumer confidence, high 
interest rates, devaluation of real estate, restrictive bank lending practices, 
the growing cost of the savings-and-loan bailout and the costs associated with 
the military buildup in the Middle East, Katz said. All of that activity should 
eventually cause the Federal Reserve Bank to lower interest rates, Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
Utility stocks, which offer a safe haven for depositors who fear a recession, 
are moving up in price, Katz said. San Diego Gas &amp; Electric gained $1.50, 
to $46, after making a new, all-time high of $46.125. At this price, its $2.70 
annual dividend is returning 5.8% to shareholders. Southern California Edison 
Corp., SDG&amp;E's prospective merger partner, is selling a point off of its 
all-time high. SDG&amp;E shareholders are to receive 1.3 shares of Southern 
California Edison for each of their shares if the proposed merger is completed. 
</P>
<P>
The best gain among local companies was made by Price Co., which gained $2.75 
during the past week and $3 during the previous week. That move might be 
attributed to recent acquisitions of the Wholesale Club by Walmart and the 
Warehouse Club by the Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. 
</P>
<P>
Some depressed San Diego stocks managed good gains last week. Medical Imaging 
Centers of America gained $1.50, and Mycogen gained $1.25. Cubic, Alliance 
Pharmaceuticals and Mail Boxes Etc. each gained $1. 
</P>
<P>
On the down side was PS Group, which recorded a new 1990 low of $30 despite 
recent reports that Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway is continuing to 
increase his stake. Buffett's last investment, which raised his ownership to 
22.3%, was made at $33 a share.

WARNER CENTER COPES WITH A HIGH VACANCY RATE; 
</P>
<P>
OFFICES: THE LARGE SUPPLY OF EMPTY SPACE IS DUE PARTLY TO A PUSH BY DEVELOPERS 
TO GET THEIR PROJECTS ON BOARD BEFORE LOCAL RESTRICTIONS MAKE FUTURE PROJECTS

<P>
Marvin Gayle was a die-hard Westside veteran, having kept offices for more than 
20 years in Century City and in Beverly Hills for a decade before that. So when 
the business litigation and personal injury attorney was asked by his young 
partner and secretary to consider moving to the Warner Center in Woodland Hills 
to be closer to where they all live, he flatly refused. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wasn't interested," Gayle said. But not wanting to appear inflexible, 
he agreed to look at a new building owned by the Voit Cos. "I came out here, 
looked at it," Gayle said, "and told them we were moving." 
</P>
<P>
That was in September and now, Gayle said, he commutes from his Encino 
residence in less than 15 minutes. He has a view of the Santa Susana Mountains. 
His Valley-based clients like his new location and his Westside clients haven't 
shunned him. "Once they get here, they're impressed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
About two decades after the Warner Center's first building rose out of corn 
fields, the 1,100-acre master-planned development -- built on the former ranch 
of late Warner Bros. President Harry Warner -- is the Valley's answer to 
Century City and is home to about 14 million square feet of commercial space. 
</P>
<P>
But like much of the office market in Southern California, Warner Center has 
felt the impact of the nationwide commercial real estate slump and is saddled 
with a large supply of empty space. Gayle doesn't have many neighbors in the 
so-called Warner Center VI, the 20-story office tower that opened in January at 
a construction cost of about $100 million. The building is only about 35% 
leased. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the average vacancy rate for all of Warner Center is about 20%, which 
is much higher than the 14% overall vacancy rate for the Valley in the third 
quarter, according to a Grubb &amp; Ellis Commercial Real Estate Services 
study. And while some local office markets, such as Westwood, had vacancy rates 
above 20%, the rate in downtown Los Angeles actually fell during the quarter to 
13% -- a 17-month low. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Warner Center has become a prestigious business address within the 
Valley, and it has some hidden strengths for the future. The high vacancy rate 
in Warner Center is partly due to the push by developers to get their projects 
on board before local growth restrictions make future projects more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Many developers, including big national companies such as JMB Realty, Trizec 
Properties and LaSalle Partners, have plans to build large projects in Warner 
Center. JMB, for instance, plans to develop 22 acres surrounding the Blue Cross 
of California headquarters on Oxnard Street, which it purchased two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But after Warner Center III, a 26-story office tower developed by Voit, is 
finished early next year, there will probably be a few years in which no 
construction takes place in Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, developers in Warner Center with buildings to fill concede that 
they must take a long-term view of profits, and that means offering prospective 
tenants costly concessions such as several months free rent and free parking to 
entice them to move in. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes you a little longer to make a decent return on investment in today's 
marketplace," said Richard B. Shapiro, vice president of Elins Development, 
which recently opened a 60,000-square-foot office building in Warner Center. It 
could take three years after construction starts for a developer to reach an 
operating profit, Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
A few new buildings account for nearly all the vacant space in Warner Center, 
including the Warner Center VI project, which Voit -- Warner Center's biggest 
landlord with about 3 million square feet of office space -- opened with 
partner Copley Real Estate Advisors of Boston. Other buildings nearby that 
opened recently include a two-building office complex by Trammell Crow, and the 
Elins building. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Center is bounded by Vanowen Street on the north, Topanga Canyon 
Boulevard on the west, De Soto Avenue on the east and the Ventura Freeway on 
the south. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Graham, an office-leasing specialist at Coldwell Banker Real Estate 
Services, said tenants continue to be attracted by Warner Center's rental 
rates, which at $1.80 to $2.50 a square foot are lower than downtown Los 
Angeles and Westside rates. Warner Center rents are slightly higher than rents 
on Ventura Boulevard in Encino and Sherman Oaks -- the Valley's other major 
business area -- but local growth limits have also created a shortage of space 
along the Ventura corridor, which has helped funnel tenants west to Warner 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro of Elins Development said business people are also increasingly viewing 
Warner Center as "a viable place" to locate because buildings are newer and 
have more amenities than in other areas of Los Angeles, and a diversified labor 
pool lives nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Also, with little additional office space likely to be added to Warner Center 
for at least a few years after Voit's Warner Center III is opened next year, "I 
think we're slowly creeping into a landlord's market," said Sheryl L. Mazirow, 
a senior marketing consultant at Grubb &amp; Ellis in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
It could stay a landlord's market if Warner Center developers keep facing more 
bureaucratic snags before projects can be approved. The Warner Center Specific 
Plan, the master plan for the area, is now being updated and many developers 
have put projects on hold until the new plan is adopted by the Los Angeles 
Planning Department, which isn't expected until late next year. Development in 
Warner Center and elsewhere has also been slowed because of the savings and 
loan crisis, which has made it harder to obtain financing for real estate 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Warner Center has begun attracting a broader range of tenants, 
said William Lassetter, marketing director for Voit's Warner Center properties. 
Until recently, Warner Center offices were occupied almost exclusively by 
insurance and health-care companies, such as Transamerica Insurance, Cigna 
Health Plans and Chubb Group. Within the past year or so, however, other types 
of businesses have started to move in, including law firms, software companies 
and more offbeat businesses such as Malibu Grand Prix, an operator of amusement 
parks that feature amateur auto racing. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Center also recently landed its first entertainment company tenant, 
movie theater and cable TV operator United Artists Communications, which last 
month signed a lease for 14,000 square feet in Voit's Warner Plaza VI. 
</P>
<P>
But while new tenants are moving in, there's also the possibility that as space 
grows tighter, old tenants will move out. Just last week, Health Net, a health 
maintenance organization that has been in Warner Center since 1984, announced 
plans to move to Thousand Oaks by 1994. The company, which leases more than 
100,000 square feet from Voit, said the decision was motivated by its desire to 
own its own building to accommodate its rapidly expanding work force.

TUJUNGA WASH: MINORU ISUTANI WANTS TO BUILD A $60-MILLION COURSE THAT WILL LURE 
THE BIG TOURNAMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
No one would ever confuse the barren Tujunga Wash area of the San Fernando 
Valley with Pebble Beach, the picturesque village on the Monterey Peninsula. 
But to Minoru Isutani, they serve the same purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Isutani, a reclusive and controversial Japanese developer, is trying to 
assemble several prestigious U.S. golf courses and give them a revered place in 
the world of professional golf. He bought Pebble Beach Co., which includes the 
famed Pebble Beach and Spyglass Hill golf courses, hotels and other assets, for 
roughly $800 million in September. Now his company, Los Angeles-based Cosmo 
World Corp., wants to build a 355-acre, $60-million private golf course and 
clubhouse in the Tujunga Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Why the Tujunga Wash, which is a flood plain that lies just northwest of 
Sunland? Because it offers several features that Cosmo believes are crucial if 
its Los Angeles International Golf Club is ever to attract a major tournament. 
And that's how Isutani hopes to set his new course apart from the thousands of 
others and drive up the value of the property exponentially. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed site is within the city limits of Los Angeles; it's relatively 
flat, making it easy for galleries to roam the course; it's close to the 
Foothill Freeway and has an access road, Foothill Boulevard; and it could also 
look good on television, as the course site lies in the flat plane below a 
wedge of the San Gabriel Mountains that would serve as a backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
Isutani, 50, is a golf nut who has made his reputation in this country by 
purchasing some of the great names in the golf business. Besides Pebble Beach 
and Spyglass, two years ago he bought Ben Hogan Co. of Fort Worth, a maker of 
golf equipment begun by the legendary golfer. 
</P>
<P>
Now Isutani wants to build something great in golf, rather than just buy it. 
Cosmo makes no secret of its desire to pull the Los Angeles Open, one of the 
regular stops of professional golf's PGA Tour, from its current site at the 
renowned Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades to Isutani's Los Angeles 
International course. Failing that, Cosmo wants to land another PGA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to get the L.A. Open, we'd like to get some other events, like maybe 
the U.S. Open or the PGA Championship," said Steve Timm, a Cosmo vice president 
who is heading the Tujunga project. "Most developers who are spending the kind 
of money we're spending are always looking for a way to showcase their project, 
and what better way to do it than to have it on television?" 
</P>
<P>
But getting the L.A. Open is easier said than done. The tournament is run by 
the Los Angeles Junior Chamber of Commerce, which is currently negotiating a 
new five-year contract with Riviera that would begin after the 1991 L.A. Open 
is held at Riviera next February. 
</P>
<P>
In a bit of irony, Riviera is dubbed "Hogan's Alley" because Hogan won several 
tournaments there, including the U.S. Open in 1948. But the course is now owned 
by a separate Japanese company, Marukin Shoji Co., reflecting the growing push 
by the Japanese to combine their desire for U.S. real estate investments and 
their passion for golf. 
</P>
<P>
Even after five years, "there would have to be some tremendous, compelling 
reasons for us to be there and leave Riviera," said Bob Leo, executive director 
of the chamber and the L.A. Open. "Right now we're not contemplating any move." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Cosmo's course would be a private club limited to 500 members 
who would pay about $40,000 or $50,000 to join, and $300 to $350 a month in 
dues. The club does not plan any housing around the course, but members could 
relax in a 40,000-square-foot clubhouse. Cosmo isn't accepting membership 
deposits until it gets approval to break ground, but Timm claims 900 people 
have expressed interest in joining. 
</P>
<P>
Before they can tee it up, Cosmo has to spend several million dollars more than 
it planned to assuage environmental and flooding concerns -- even though the 
wash is dry most of the time. And Cosmo has several more hurdles to jump before 
it can start construction in April at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, there's the thorny matter of the slender horned spine flower. The 
flower grows in two sections of the wash, and because it's on the federal 
government's endangered species list, Cosmo had to spend more than $1 million 
to redesign the course to keep the fairways a safe distance from the plants. 
</P>
<P>
That's small change compared with what Cosmo would spend to alleviate any 
problem of flood damage to nearby neighborhoods. Cosmo is ready to build a 
$15-million channel that would run across the northern part of the wash, 
keeping any flood waters away from both the course and houses in Sunland that 
lie just south and east of the site. 
</P>
<P>
Cosmo, in fact, makes a big point about its willingness to spend that kind of 
money for what it believes is a major public-works and safety project. 
</P>
<P>
"We right now can take 200 or 300 homes out of reach of a possible 100-year 
event," Timm said, referring to a catastrophic, once-in-a-century flood. "Our 
golf course will protect the lives of people. That's the one thing that's been 
overshadowed" by Cosmo's critics. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the course include certain homeowners groups in the area such as the 
Sunland-Tujunga Assn. of Residents. The group has yet to say whether it's 
formally for or against the course, but it clearly has lots of concerns. 
</P>
<P>
J. Sylvia Gross, land-use chairman for the group, listed two of them: Would 
fertilizers and insecticides used by the course find their way into the water 
system? Would the 3 million cubic yards of fill that Cosmo proposes to haul 
into the site be washed away by a major storm? 
</P>
<P>
"We also want to know how polluted that fill is before it gets put back on 
wetland," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Sunland-Tujunga Chamber of Commerce and other residents support the 
course. One is Clark Drane, a former insurance man and former member of the 
city's Board of Zoning Appeals. He organized a group to help support Cosmo 
through the approval process. 
</P>
<P>
"Sooner or later something is going to happen to that land in the wash, and it 
couldn't be put to any better use than a golf course," he said. As for the 
critics, Drane said "there are some people, rightly or wrongly, who would 
oppose anything in the wash, even if it was gold bullion you put in there." 
</P>
<P>
The go-ahead must come from the city Planning Commission. The panel is awaiting 
an environmental impact report before it slates public hearings on the plan. 
The commission's decision could ultimately be appealed to the City Council. If 
all goes well, Cosmo would begin building the course in April, construction 
would take about 15 months and the first golfer could tee off in the summer of 
1992, Timm said. 
</P>
<P>
Timm, a former assistant club professional golfer at Riviera, joined Cosmo in 
1986 and found the site for the Los Angeles International course in early 1987. 
Nearly all of the land was owned by two entities -- the Mary Akmadzich family 
trust and CalMat Co., a cement company. Cosmo paid $2 million, or $5,500 an 
acre, for the trust's 360 acres, and obtained CalMat's 130 acres by swapping an 
equal amount of land it owned to the west of the wash, Timm said. 
</P>
<P>
Isutani, who lives in Tokyo and is a "middle 80s to low 90s" golfer by Timm's 
account, also is trying to develop a golf resort near Las Vegas and is 
co-developing one along the Kona Coast in Hawaii. He has drawn some controversy 
here and in Japan, where his affiliated companies own 13 golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
Isutani has been accused by some critics of allegedly overselling memberships 
to his Japanese courses. Japanese magazines also have questioned his 
relationship with former NTT Corp. Chairman Hisashi Shinto, who was convicted 
last month of political bribery in a stock scandal case. As a result, Isutani's 
application for a Nevada gaming license reportedly is getting close scrutiny by 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Cosmo officials have denied any wrongdoing on Isutani's part. 
</P>
<P>
Financially, Isutani does not expect to start earning an immediate return on 
his investment from the Tujunga course's operations, especially because of the 
added costs needed to address the environmental problems of the area, Timm 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Isutani is more concerned about where the course will rank among golf's U.S. 
venues. Timm said the question is: "What will it be worth when it's done?"

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: VENTURA ENTERTAINMENT ALTERS TERMS OF WARRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura Entertainment Group Ltd., a North Hollywood television and movie 
producer, said it reduced the exercise price of its class B warrants from $16 
to $2 for a period of 23 days to end Nov. 30. This effectively entitles the 
holder to purchase two shares of common stock for $2. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura Entertainment has struggled recently, losing $2.60 million on revenues 
of $3.08 million in the eight months that ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, a group led by Networth Partners L.P., a New York investment 
partnership, said it has boosted its holdings in Ventura from 7.6% to 9.7% or 
753,560 common shares, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. The partnership bought 161,000 shares from Oct. 4 to Oct. 19 for 
prices ranging from $7.62 to $9.50 per share, for a total price of $1.48 
million.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: ST. IVES LABS' PROFIT UP 42% IN 3RD QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
St. Ives Laboratories Inc., recovering from a marketing goof, said its 
third-quarter profit jumped 42% from a year earlier on a 9% increase in sales. 
</P>
<P>
In the quarter ended Sept. 30, St. Ives' net income rose to $835,731 from 
$590,532 a year earlier, and its sales rose to $27.5 million from $25.3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Based in Chatsworth, St. Ives makes shampoos and other personal-care products. 
In late-1989 and early this year, its earnings had slumped largely because the 
company had put its hair-care products in new packages that bombed with 
consumers. St. Ives has since gone back to its previous packaging and its 
profit rebounded in the latest quarter. 
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of 1990, however, St. Ives' profit was still down 33% 
from a year earlier, to $2.47 million from $3.71 million. Its nine-month sales 
fell 6% to $78.6 million from $83.5 million.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: STORAGE PROPERTIES POSTS $690,000 QUARTERLY INCOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Storage Properties Inc., a real estate investment trust that invests primarily 
in self-storage warehouses, reported net income of $690,000 on revenue of 
$790,000 in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
There are no comparable year-earlier figures, because Storage Properties began 
operations on Sept. 12, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The publicly held company is headed by B. Wayne Hughes, who is also chairman of 
Public Storage Inc., a major operator of self-storage facilities. 
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of 1990, Storage Properties earned $1.80 million on 
revenue of $2.06 million. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Storage Properties' directors also authorized the company to buy 
back up to 200,000 of its common shares in periodic open-market purchases. 
Storage Properties completed its initial public stock offering only a few weeks 
ago.

LOUISVILLE IS SET TO FACE SEC FOE; 
</P>
<P>
FIESTA BOWL: TEMPE, ARIZ., WILL REMAIN THE SITE FOR THE GAME. THE HALFTIME SHOW 
MIGHT HAVE A CIVIL RIGHTS THEME TO ALLAY CONTROVERSY OVER KING HOLIDAY. 
</P>

<P>
Barring any more last-minute surprises, 20th-ranked Louisville will play one of 
three Southeastern Conference teams -- Tennessee, Alabama or Auburn -- in the 
Fiesta Bowl at Arizona State's Sun Devil Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
An official announcement is expected today, but bowl sources said Monday that 
Louisville, which finished the season 9-1-1, has agreed to accept the Fiesta 
invitation. The situation with the remaining bid is slightly more complicated. 
Here are the conditions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- If Mississippi wins the SEC title and the automatic Sugar Bowl bid, then 
the Fiesta selection committee will choose between Tennessee or the 
Auburn-Alabama winner. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If Tennessee wins the SEC championship, then the Fiesta will choose the 
Auburn-Alabama winner. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If Auburn or Alabama wins the SEC title, then the Fiesta would offer 
Tennessee the bid. 
</P>
<P>
Only three days ago, embattled Fiesta Bowl officials were seriously discussing 
canceling this season's game. At issue was the failed referendum calling for an 
Arizona state holiday honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Because of the vote, 
much-wanted schools such as Virginia declined to play in the Tempe-based bowl. 
</P>
<P>
And only two days ago, Fiesta officials spent their entire Sunday calling at 
least a dozen teams, probably more, in search of two programs that would be 
willing to accept a bid. The Fiesta offered its estimated payout of $2.5 
million and assurances that significant efforts were under way to diffuse the 
King situation. 
</P>
<P>
Among the possibilities is a halftime show that would feature a civil rights 
theme. NBC, the network responsible for the broadcast, has indicated to Fiesta 
organizers that it might consider enlisting the help of some of its 
entertainers. Also being discussed is an additional $200,000 fee paid to the 
participating universities. The money would be earmarked for a school's 
minority affairs program or minority scholarship fund. 
</P>
<P>
For Louisville, the Fiesta invitation marks the first time since 1977 the 
Cardinals will play in a bowl game. Coach Howard Schnellenberger called each of 
his team's 24 seniors at 6:30 a.m. Monday and met with them an hour later. 
Later that day, after talks involving Schnellenberger, university President 
Donald Swain and Athletic Director Bill Olsen, the bid was accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the presidents of Tennessee, Auburn and Alabama, were gathering 
information regarding the Fiesta Bowl. Satisfied with the Fiesta's efforts and 
intent, approval was given to play in the New Year's Day game. 
</P>
<P>
Should the alliance somehow fall apart, the Fiesta also has talked to Baylor 
and North Carolina. The Fiesta made a brief run at Colorado State, but Colorado 
State decided Monday to stay with the Freedom Bowl, which said it will invite 
the Western Athletic Conference school. 
</P>
<P>
The effects of the Fiesta's actions were immediately felt. Southern Mississippi 
will probably take Louisville's place in the All-American Bowl. North Carolina 
could take Southern Mississippi's spot in the Independence Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC deal leaves Mississippi, if it doesn't win the conference title, to 
play in the Gator or Peach bowl. The Gator would get first choice between the 
Rebels or the Auburn-Alabama loser.

KING CONTROVERSY: NAACP DECRIES GOLDEN BEARS' DECISION TO PLAY WYOMING IN 
TUCSON'S COPPER BOWL AS RAMIFICATIONS OF HOLIDAY REJECTION SPREAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Copper Bowl was unable to avoid the mounting controversy over the Arizona 
voters' rejection of Martin Luther King Day as professional and college sports 
officials re-evaluated their future dealings with the state on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The University of California, the center of the Free Speech movement in the 
1960s, was condemned by the NAACP for accepting an invitation to the Dec. 31 
postseason game in Tucson. California is scheduled to play Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Bears, tied for second with USC in the Pacific 10, voted unanimously 
to play in Tucson, as did Wyoming players. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Roach, Wyoming's coach and athletic director, said: "We got the squad 
together and the players voted to accept a formal invitation. 
</P>
<P>
"If a tremendous wave of opposition develops, we would possibly reconsider our 
decision, and bowl officials have said they understand that." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona voters last Tuesday defeated two measures that would have created a 
paid state holiday. One that would have substituted a paid King holiday for a 
paid Columbus Day was turned down by a 3-1 margin; the other, which would have 
kept a paid Columbus Day and added a paid King holiday, lost by fewer than 
17,000 votes out of more than one million. 
</P>
<P>
"We just don't understand how a school with the University of California's 
tradition could have made this decision," James Williams, an NAACP spokesman in 
Washington, told reporters. "The University has always been a campus that has 
fostered humanitarian ideals." 
</P>
<P>
The NFL has threatened to pull the 1993 Super Bowl out of Arizona, and Fiesta 
Bowl officials are reeling after losing Notre Dame and Virginia, whose 
representatives said they would not accept bids to play in Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
But the Copper Bowl appeared to escape controversy until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Cal (6-3-1), which has not been to a bowl game since the 1979 Garden State 
Bowl, has a majority minority student enrollment. It also has a minority 
chancellor, Chang-Lin Tien, the first Asian to head a major research university 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the players were united in playing in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Dickson, Cal's defensive end, said he was willing to accept criticism from 
Berkeley's liberal element. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to tell how much support we're going to get with our decision or 
what will be the ramifications," said Dickson, who is black. "We don't agree 
with what Arizona is doing, but at the same time that should not stop us from 
participating in something we've worked six, seven months to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no control over how people vote. If we were to sit out the game, I 
don't think that's going to influence any political ways." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Juanso, a spokesman for Cal, said the team wanted to do something as a 
tribute to Dr. King. 
</P>
<P>
"Something subtle, possibly an emblem on a jersey, possibly (on) a helmet," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Michael Wolgelenter, assistant sports editor of the campus newspaper, the 
Daily Californian, said the players voted not to wear any kind of emblem. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to several players today and there was no hesitation about accepting 
the bid," Wolgelenter said. "They're aware of what they're doing and the 
significance of the issue, but there don't seem to be any reservations." 
</P>
<P>
The Daily Californian published an editorial today supporting the players' 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost everybody (on the editorial board) expressed some reservations about 
Cal going to the game," said Cedric Puleston, editor and chief. "But the 
decision was left up to the players and they voted unanimously to go, that's 
what we respect, the way the decision was made." 
</P>
<P>
Wyoming officials said their players would wear armbands as a salute to King. 
"(Players) requested that due to the situation . . . that they wear an emblem 
somewhere on the uniform as a tribute to Dr. King," Roach said. 
</P>
<P>
If Phoenix loses the 1993 Super Bowl, which would be a blow to an already 
depressed economy, the game probably would be moved to Pasadena or San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Awarding San Diego the game, however, could present NFL officials with a 
similar scenario. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego twice has been embroiled in controversy over the use of King's name. 
In 1987, the city council voted to rename Market Street as Martin Luther King 
Jr. Way. But the decision was overturned by voters in a referendum, which 
changed the name back to Market Street. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, San Diego Board of Port Commissioners voted against renaming a newly 
constructed convention center after King. 
</P>
<P>
NBA officials relocated their winter meetings in Phoenix after the King holiday 
was voted down in the Arizona state legislature. 
</P>
<P>
NBA Commissioner David Stern said of the Super Bowl: "We wouldn't have 
scheduled it there in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
Backlash from the vote concerns Lamar Whitmer, chairman of the Maricopa County 
sports Authority. One of the group's main objectives is getting a baseball 
expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
Whitmer said the chances of winning a franchise could be jeopardized if 
reaction against the state continues.

"The possibility of having a Super Bowl pulled is not encouraging," he said. 
"It's hard to tell if this will have a lasting effect. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not fair to the people of this state to label them as bigots or the 
Alabama of the 90s. But people inside the state feel they are being called 
racists." 
</P>
<P>
George Raveling, USC's basketball coach and a consultant for the Black Coaches 
Assn., agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm certainly not prepared to brand a whole state of people as racist," 
Raveling said. "I have a lot of mixed feelings about what's right and what's 
wrong in the situation. Obviously, they knew going in that if the vote failed 
they stood to lose the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Little indication was given Monday whether baseball teams based in Arizona for 
spring training are considering relocating. 
</P>
<P>
Eight teams train in Arizona -- the Angels, San Francisco Giants, Chicago Cubs, 
Seattle Mariners, Milwaukee Brewers and Oakland Athletics are based in the 
Phoenix area. The Cleveland Indians are in Tucson, the San Diego Padres in 
Yuma. 
</P>
<P>
Angel spokesman Tim Mead said that it seemed unlikely the team would move its 
training facility. "It hasn't come up," Mead said. "There aren't a lot of 
options if it did become an issue. I don't think it's going to involve us. 
</P>
<P>
"It's safe to say the options are pretty limited for Cactus League clubs." 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher Dennis Rasmussen, player representative of the Padres, said it would be 
difficult to boycott. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure the issue's going to come up at our player-rep meetings in December, 
but I don't think it's going to be a big issue for the simple reason being that 
this isn't a one-game stand like the Super Bowl," Rasmussen said. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Greenberg, deputy commissioner of baseball, said it would be difficult to 
relocate eight teams. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tempestuous issue that we're keeping an eye on, but we obviously are 
going to have spring training in Arizona," he said. "It's a different issue for 
us then it is for other sports in that we have an on-going relationship and in 
some cases a contractural relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Werner, Padre chairman, called the Arizona vote disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
"How it affects the San Diego Padres is something we'll have to determine," 
Werner said. "We'll have to weigh playing there -- with our proximity to San 
Diego -- with the other issues. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd hope the issue isn't a dead issue because I think we (major league owners) 
have a responsibility to make sure the dialogue keeps alive." 
</P>
<P>
Locally, Phoenix Cardinal players said Monday the decision will hurt Cardinal 
recruiting. They said the NFL's Plan B free agents, who each spring can choose 
their future employers from among several clubs, might avoid Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Sharpe, the Cardinals' player representative, said: "If I was in position 
to negotiate with other teams, it would (adversely) affect my decision to play 
here. I wouldn't want to come (to Arizona). It means that much to me."

The World League of American Football might not get started on schedule next 
spring because of the economy, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
"Today there are a lot of uncertainties," Tagliabue said on the eve of a 
meeting of NFL owners. "The economy isn't as robust as it was when the idea of 
the league was launched."

THIS PHILADELPHIA STORY MOSTLY ABOUT DEFENSE; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: THE EAGLES GET BACK INTO NFC EAST RACE BY DEFEATING THE REDSKINS, 
28-14.

<P>
Reggie White and his defensive teammates proved Coach Buddy Ryan's point Monday 
night that defense can score as well as offense. 
</P>
<P>
The defense set up or scored three touchdowns in a span of 3:51 late in the 
third quarter to break a 7-7 tie and lead the Philadelphia Eagles to a 28-14 
victory over the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
The defense knocked out both of the Redskins' active quarterbacks, Jeff 
Rutledge and Stan Humphries, forcing reserve running back Brian Mitchell, a 
wishbone quarterback in college at Southwestern Louisiana, to finish the game. 
</P>
<P>
The victory put the Eagles (5-4) back in the middle of the NFC playoff race. 
The Eagles won their third straight since a 13-7 loss at Washington, pulling 
them into a tie with the Redskins, four games behind the unbeaten New York 
Giants in the NFC East. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Philadelphia's touchdowns came directly from the defense, a 30-yard 
interception return for a score by William Frizzell in the first quarter and an 
18-yard fumble return by Clyde Simmons in the middle of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
It was a wakeup call for the Eagles, who led the league in turnover ratio with 
a plus 24 last year but started Monday night's game at minus three. 
</P>
<P>
"No doubt about it, it was one of the best defensive games we've played since 
I've been here," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
Randall Cunningham, who passed for 132 yards and ran for 42, and Heath Sherman, 
who rushed 124 yards in 35 carries, led the offense. 
</P>
<P>
White's 33-yard return with the first interception of his career set up 
Cunningham's two-yard touchdown pass to Sherman. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth touchdown came after a sack by White stuffed the Redskins inside the 
10, leading to Keith Byars' nine-yard pass on an option to Sherman. 
</P>
<P>
With 30 m.p.h. wind gusts hindering the offenses, the teams went off at 
halftime tied 7-7 on Frizzell's return and an eight-yard touchdown pass from 
Rutledge to Don Warren. 
</P>
<P>
Rutledge, who passed for 363 yards in the second half indoors last week in a 
41-38 overtime victory over Detroit, couldn't cope with the Eagles or the 
weather this time. He completed six of 19 attempts for 63 yards before leaving 
in the third quarter with an injury to his right thumb. 
</P>
<P>
White knocked Humphries out of the game with a knee injury in the fourth 
quarter, and on came Mitchell to lead a 56-yard drive capped by his own 
one-yard dive. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell was the first player in NCAA history to pass for over 5,000 yards 
(5,447) and run for over 3,000 (3,335). The Redskins drafted him on the fifth 
round.

NOTHING-TO-LOSE PASS CAN BECOME WINNING PROPOSITION 
</P>

<P>
One of the NFL's worst offensive formations, and probably its least popular, is 
the kneel-down formation. 
</P>
<P>
It is used by many teams in the last minute of the half or the game, when the 
quarterback takes the snap and, forsaking a chance to score a quick touchdown, 
kneels down to run out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
"The NFL tells us they're in the entertainment business," says Times reader 
Norton Beach. "Do they think we're paying to see an athlete hunker down?" 
</P>
<P>
It isn't likely that Chuck Knox, who coaches the Seattle Seahawks, was 
considering that question Sunday. But he probably won the game when he 
renounced a splendid opportunity to send in a kneel-down play three seconds 
before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
At that moment, with Seattle losing, 6-3, Knox ordered a long pass, which 
enabled quarterback Dave Krieg to practice the Seahawks' desperation offense. 
</P>
<P>
And although the play failed, the next desperation pass that Krieg threw -- on 
the last play of the game -- beat the Kansas City Chiefs as Paul Skansi caught 
it in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Like any other play in football, the desperation or Hail Mary pass has to be 
practiced. That's the best strategic argument against the kneel-down formation. 
</P>
<P>
Most coaches reason that the odds are almost hopelessly against completing long 
passes when the clock is running down. 
</P>
<P>
"Why wear out your wide receivers?" Hall of Famer Sid Gillman asks. "They could 
pull a muscle. A lot of bad things could happen. 
</P>
<P>
"Coaches aren't in the entertainment business. They're in the winning 
business." 
</P>
<P>
That's one side. 
</P>
<P>
The other side is that a long desperation throw makes more sense than a 
kneel-down play because it provides as many as four scoring chances: 
</P>
<P>
 -- It could be deflected for a completion. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It could be deliberately deflected by a receiver tipping the ball away on a 
designed play. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It could bring an interference penalty setting up a closer-in shot. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It could be completed to the intended receiver. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders are still ahead in the AFC West because, this time, Krieg's was 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
The Chiefs demonstrated again in the Seattle game that a talented, skillful 
pass defense isn't much help in pro football if accompanied by a unproductive 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
It was after a Kansas City linebacker, Derrick Thomas, sacked Krieg seven times 
that Krieg got up and won it with his last throw. 
</P>
<P>
The pass-defense problem for any pro club is that no passer can be roped on 
every play. Any quarterback is bound to complete a few against any NFL defense. 
</P>
<P>
In Kansas City, despite Thomas' record binge of sacks, Krieg completed 16 of 23 
for 306 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Chiefs have probably the AFC's best defensive, offensive and special-team 
players -- except at Steve DeBerg's position, quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
They have produced only one touchdown in their last three games -- and the 
defense scored that. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL fined Raider owner Al Davis again Sunday -- in effect. It took $300,000 
or more away from Davis and the Green Bay Packers when it scheduled the Rams 
against the New York Giants at the same hour, 1 p.m., in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
To an estimated 20,000 or more potential Raider-Packer fans, the free Ram-Giant 
game on TV was preferable, holding attendance at the Coliseum to 50,855. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't easy for the Rams to sell out Anaheim Stadium, which seats 69,008, but 
it has proved almost impossible for the Raiders to sell out the 92,488-seat 
Coliseum -- with or without a competing game in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the NFL never schedules the Giants against the Jets in competing 
games. It can't -- because they play in the same stadium. 
</P>
<P>
For scheduling purposes, it should pretend that the Raiders and Rams play in 
the same stadium, too. 
</P>
<P>
The league's present scheduling policy is a disservice to its own teams as well 
as to pro fans who follow both the Rams and Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
The most likely explanation is that the NFL office is still mad at Davis. 
</P>
<P>
In their 29-16 defeat Sunday, the Raiders learned that the best time to have 
played the Packers this year was in the first half of the season, when they 
were a struggling team. 
</P>
<P>
As a former Ram coach, Tommy Prothro, used to say: "The thing that counts in 
football is who you play when." 
</P>
<P>
By the time the Raiders got around to Green Bay, quarterback Don Majkowski had 
finished his own personal training camp and, after a few rough early-season 
performances, had finally come almost all the way back to his 1989 form. 
</P>
<P>
When the other Packers were in their training camp last summer, Majkowski was 
holding out for a multiyear, multimillion-dollar contract, which the club 
wouldn't give him. 
</P>
<P>
If it had, it would be that much closer to the Super Bowl. For he is a genuine 
talent. Throwing on the run, he is nearly as accurate as the San Francisco 
49ers' Joe Montana, even in the midst of eight sacks. 
</P>
<P>
As Derrick Thomas learned, seven or eight sacks can be surmounted. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think its ever possible to miss a training camp and get things down," 
Green Bay Coach Lindy Infante said. "You can't get the guy enough repetitions." 
</P>
<P>
The 8-1 Chicago Bears, who play in Green Bay's division, can be thankful for 
that. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Raiders, they know now what Prothro meant. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants have been talking about their money packages lately -- their nickel 
and dime defenses and the others -- in which, on passing downs, they add one to 
three defensive backs to the starting four. 
</P>
<P>
As Giant General Manager George Young said when asked about the club's fast 
start: "Our money packages have been on the money." 
</P>
<P>
If you're looking for a reason to promote the Cal State Long Beach coach, 
George Allen, for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, that's one good one. 
</P>
<P>
For it was Allen who, as the 1960s coach of the Rams, invented the nickel 
defense. He came up with both the alignment -- five defensive backs replacing 
four -- and the name for it. 
</P>
<P>
One day against a particularly strong passing team, Allen added another 
defensive back and called him the dime back. 
</P>
<P>
His and other clubs, needing even more help, subsequently put in quarter and 
dollar defenses. 
</P>
<P>
As a college coach, Allen, 72, had a chance Saturday to join Auburn's Pat Dye 
and the other famous college coaches this year by playing for a tie. Instead, 
Allen went for two and beat Cal State Northridge, 25-24. 
</P>
<P>
The undefeated 49ers ran the ball with a little more style Sunday night in 
Dallas, but as a running team they still are no match for the undefeated 
Giants, their opponent at Candlestick Park Monday night, Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Few teams match the Giants for ground power, as they demonstrated again in 
Anaheim Sunday. Although they won, 31-7, the score was 10-7 in the second half 
when, on second and 11, rookie running back Rodney Hampton burst 19 yards 
through the Rams for a touchdown on the game's big play. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants also attack with a tough old workhorse, Ottis Anderson, as well as a 
5-foot-7 pony back, David Meggett, who weighs 180 pounds, not to mention a sure 
old blocker, Maurice Carthon. 
</P>
<P>
Their running plays set up quarterback Phil Simms' decisive passes against the 
Rams as surely as Majkowski's passing against the Raiders set up the Packers to 
run for a season-high 101 yards. 
</P>
<P>
In the Giant-49er game, Montana will be on his own unless the 49ers can in the 
meantime find a running attack. 
</P>
<P>
"We're concerned," said 49er Coach George Seifert. "We're working on it every 
week." 
</P>
<P>
Quote Department: 
</P>
<P>
Boomer Esiason, Cincinnati quarterback, on how the Pittsburgh Steelers have 
caught the Bengals for first in the AFC Central: "We've got guys open, and I'm 
not hitting them." 
</P>
<P>
Bubby Brister, Pittsburgh quarterback, on the Steelers' rise from 1-3 to 5-4: 
"We should be proud and enjoy it, because the first month was hell." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Henning, San Diego coach, on winning four of his last five: "There is an 
overall stability factor that we hadn't had earlier or last year." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Ditka, Chicago coach, on chasing the 49ers and Giants: "I don't think 
there are very many people even right now who respect (the Bears). That's the 
way I like it. That's the way I want it."

NO MIDDLE GROUND IN RIVALRY; 
</P>
<P>
BRUINS: IT'S EITHER THE THRILL OF VICTORY OR HEARTACHE OF DEFEAT AGAINST USC, 
DONAHUE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Terry Donahue has participated in the UCLA-USC football series for 21 years as 
a player, assistant coach and head coach. 
</P>
<P>
The cross-town rivalry is an integral, emotional part of his life and he summed 
it up Monday by saying: "There's an unbelievable vacuum between the peaks and 
valleys (of the games). I can remember the games like they were yesterday and 
the thrill of victory and heartache of defeat are hard to describe. But there 
is no land in between." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue conceded that last year's 10-10 tie with USC might have been the vacuum 
filler. 
</P>
<P>
In most instances, though, Donahue has run the gamut of emotions in a series 
that began in 1929, was discontinued from 1931 until 1936 and then resumed 
until the present. 
</P>
<P>
"The wins are the greatest of the greatest and the losses are the worst of the 
worst," said Donahue of his involvement. 
</P>
<P>
So the Trojans and Bruins will battle again Saturday at the Rose Bowl with only 
pride and city bragging rights at stake. 
</P>
<P>
Washington has already clinched a berth in the Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the importance of the game is not diluted in Donahue's mind. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of great rivalries in the country," Donahue said, "but there 
is no rivalry in the United States where two major institutions share the same 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"That fuels the competitiveness. We also have the normal factors that go into a 
fierce rivalry. We also have the additional factors of everybody (alumni) going 
to work together, sharing the same office building, same car pool rides and 
going to the same parties." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what was his most satisfying win in the series, Donahue didn't hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
"It was 1980," he said. "It was the first time." 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to his first victory over USC as a head coach after four 
straight losses to the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
Then, he reminisced about some of the games. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been fighting this battle for a long time and that's what makes it 
unique, too, the struggle and competition," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have the scar where I hit the locker after the 1977 game (USC won, 
29-27, on a late field goal)." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue was on the UCLA scout team in 1964 and didn't play in the game. 
However, as an undersized lineman, he vividly remembers the 1965 game that UCLA 
won, 20-16, on Gary Beban's late, long touchdown pass to Kurt Altenberg. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember Kareem Abdul-Jabbar jumping up and down on the field, saying, 
'We're going to the Rose Bowl, we're going to the Rose Bowl.' He was only a 
freshman at the time." 
</P>
<P>
As for the most disappointing losses, Donahue said it was difficult to single 
them out. 
</P>
<P>
"As intense as the rivalry is, there is an element of mutual respect, or 
class," Donahue said. "I never thought the rivalry was bitter as some other 
rivalries. I never felt that way about this game." 
</P>
<P>
His latest involvement was the 10-10 tie last year -- and he had mixed 
emotions. 
</P>
<P>
USC was a 17-point favorite and headed for the Rose Bowl. UCLA had a chance to 
win on the final play of the game when Alfredo Velasco's 54-yard field goal try 
hit the cross bar and bounced back onto the field. 
</P>
<P>
"When that ball hit the crossbar and bounced backward, it just summed up our 
season," said Donahue of his team's 3-7-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
This time, a winning season hangs in the balance Saturday for UCLA with its 5-5 
record. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins are coming off an emotional, 25-22 victory over Washington in 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the win over Washington does two things psychologically," Donahue 
said. "It alerts USC that UCLA is a decent team by beating Washington. And it 
certainly gives our team confidence that we beat the conference champion and 
that we're capable of playing with anyone in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
"One factor is to our disadvantage and the other to our advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be a great game. USC has a better record (7-2-1), but we have 
a chance to win if we play our best game. It's always an exciting time for the 
city."

Although Colorado is second behind Notre Dame in the rankings, Buffalo Coach 
Bill McCartney wants the Irish to win their final two regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
If Notre Dame beats Penn State and USC and Colorado beats Kansas State 
Saturday, their Orange Bowl showdown will be a clear-cut clash for the national 
title. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, they'll win their two games and we'll win ours, and it will be for 
the championship," McCartney said. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish (8-1) were a near-unanimous pick as the top team in Monday's 
Associated Press poll. They received 55 of 60 first-place votes and 1,495 of a 
possible 1,500 points from a nationwide panel of sports writers and 
broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado (9-1-1) got the other five first-place votes. Miami (6-2) rose two 
spots to third and Georgia Tech (8-0-1), the only major team without a loss, 
jumped from seventh to fourth. Brigham Young (8-1) went from eighth to fifth.

A RED-LETTER KIND OF YEAR FOR REDLANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the start of the season, Occidental was regarded as the consensus choice to 
repeat as the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference football 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Mike Maynard of the University of Redlands had other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that we were going to be a real good football team," he said. "I 
thought we'd be in this position." 
</P>
<P>
Redlands finds itself in the position of competing in the NCAA Division III 
playoffs for the first time in school history this week. It will be the first 
postseason appearance for the Bulldogs since they advanced to the second round 
of the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics playoffs in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs, ranked No. 3 in the West, will take an 8-1 record into their 
first-round game against Central of Iowa on Saturday afternoon in Pella. 
Central, also 8-1, is ranked No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
After a 27-21 loss to San Francisco State on Oct. 6, Maynard was concerned that 
his team's playoff hopes might have vanished. 
</P>
<P>
"When we lost to San Francisco State, I was a little concerned because I 
thought they might not recognize the quality of the San Francisco State team we 
played," he said. "Regardless of what their final record was, they were a 
pretty good Division II team at the time." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Maynard, his team apparently saved its best for last this 
season. The Bulldogs rolled over their competition in going undefeated in the 
SCIAC, and the coach said the loss to San Francisco State might have provided 
the impetus. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we came together a lot after that game," he said. "I think that loss 
put the pressure on them to the extent that they knew they had to dominate in 
order to be noticed." 
</P>
<P>
In outscoring their conference opponents by 223-74, including a 52-14 rout of 
Occidental Nov. 3, the Bulldogs clinched their first SCIAC title since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
It also marks the first postseason appearance for a SCIAC team since Occidental 
was humiliated by Central, 71-0, in the Division III playoffs in 1985. Maynard 
is looking at the game as an opportunity to lend credibility to Division III 
football on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real opportunity and we have a major responsibility to more than just 
our own football team," he said. "We're representing our conference, the West 
Coast and more." 
</P>
<P>
Maynard says his team will have its hands full against a Central squad that 
will be making its seventh consecutive appearance in the Division III playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the best teams I've faced in my coaching career and we're 
looking forward to it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The coach said the program that the Flying Dutchmen have developed is a model 
for Redlands to follow for the future. 
</P>
<P>
"They are one of the teams that we expect to be like over the next seven or 
eight years," he said. "They are the kind of team that we would hope to be like 
in the future but we would hope to be ready for them now. We expect to play a 
good game against them." 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs, who average 33.5 points, appear to have a good future in players 
such as sophomore quarterback Brian Harmon and junior fullback Curt Landreth. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon has completed 103 of 171 passes for 1,368 yards and 15 touchdowns and 
led the SCIAC in passing efficiency. Landreth has rushed for 1,024 yards and 10 
touchdowns to surpass the 1,000-yard plateau for the second straight season. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been able to throw with an element of surprise and that's because we've 
also been able to run effectively," Maynard said. 
</P>
<P>
He also credits the team's offensive line, including guard Mike Caspino and 
tackle Paul Querro, in the success of the offense. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the first thing our opponents probably look at," Maynard said. "Our 
line has been very effective the last two years and to get any kind of running 
attack I think you need that." 
</P>
<P>
He said the team's run-oriented offense matches well with the Flying Dutchmen. 
</P>
<P>
"We run the football and so do they," Maynard said. "We're well matched when 
you look at the numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Maynard is hoping that Saturday's game is a beginning as opposed to an end for 
the Redlands program. 
</P>
<P>
"Our ambition is not to be a flash in the pan," he said. "We want to do this 
every year and try to bring in new people every year. We're trying to build a 
consistent winner year in and year out and I think we're off to a good start." 
</P>
<P>
It is understandable if Cal State Northridge and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo have 
mixed feelings about competing in the NCAA Division II football playoffs this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Not that either team is unhappy about advancing into postseason play. But 
neither expected to be paired against the other in the first round of the 
16-team playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (7-3) and San Luis Obispo (9-1) will meet in an opening-round game 
at 1 p.m. Saturday in San Luis Obispo. It will be the second time in the last 
15 days that the Western Football Conference rivals will meet. 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo defeated Northridge, 6-3, in the first meeting in Northridge as 
the teams tied for the conference title. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Lyle Setencich also doesn't want to make too much of his team's 
home-field advantage for the game. Especially not after Northridge defeated San 
Luis Obispo, 13-10, last year in San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
"We both know each other well," he said. "There's not a lot of difference in 
our teams and it doesn't matter where we play." 
</P>
<P>
The game will match several of the top offensive players in the conference. 
Northridge, making its first Division II playoff appearance in school history, 
has been sparked by running back Albert Fann with 918 yards rushing and 10 
touchdowns and 28 receptions for 218 yards. 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo, which is making its first playoff appearance since it won the 
Division II title in 1980, has been led on offense by quarterback David 
Lafferty and running back Joe Fragiadakis. Lafferty is the leading passer in 
the WFC and Fragiadakis is the team's top rusher and receiver. 
</P>
<P>
College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
The winner of Saturday's Division II playoff between Northridge and San Luis 
Obispo will meet the winner of Saturday's game between top-ranked North Dakota 
State (10-0) and Northern Colorado (7-3) in the quarterfinals next week. . . . 
In the Division III playoffs, a Redlands victory would send the Bulldogs into a 
second-round game against either St. Thomas of Minnesota (7-2-1) or 
Wisconsin-Whitewater (10-0) next week.

PAT VALENZUELA IS HOSPITALIZED, ATTORNEYS SAY

Jockey Patrick Valenzuela, 28, is hospitalized at an undisclosed location in 
San Diego County, according to his attorneys, Sam Silverstein and Nicholas 
Micelli. 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys told Hollywood Park stewards that they will offer "clear and 
convincing proof" Wednesday that the troubled jockey's problems aren't 
drug-related. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hollywood Park steward Thomas Ward said: "They don't even know really 
what the proof is going to be. They hope to have the reports Tuesday or early 
Wednesday. Our next meeting is scheduled for 11:30 a.m. Wednesday." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, who was suspended for 60 days last year after testing positive for 
cocaine, called in sick Nov. 3 at Santa Anita, then later that day refused to 
take a drug test when asked to by Dr. Neal Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
Why did Valenzuela refuse to take a drug test 10 days ago? 
</P>
<P>
"(Silverstein and Micelli) indicated the reports that they will have will 
indicate that (Valenzuela) was free of drugs on the Saturday in question," Ward 
said. 
</P>
<P>
All Summer Sale needed to end his six-race losing streak was a return trip to 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Unsuccessful since winning the Hollywood Turf Express nearly a year ago, the 
4-year-old Summer Time Guy gelding led wire-to-wire Monday in the $61,150 Rich 
Cream Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Able to get away with a relatively easy first quarter-mile (22 1/5), the 2-1 
favorite had enough left to hold off 25-1 shot One Drink and won by a nose. 
Ridden by Alex Solis, who won twice Monday to give him 12 victories in the 
first six days of the meeting, Summer Sale covered the six furlongs in 1:07 
3/5, a fifth of a second off Zany Tactics' course record. 
</P>
<P>
Navajo Storm, the 3-1 second choice, was third, then came Roman Avie, Sulaymi, 
Astro, Splurger, Cove Way and Mister Modesty. Gallant Sailor, Due To The King 
and Frost Free were scratched. 
</P>
<P>
Live The Dream, who won the 1989 Hollywood Derby, is the 121-pound highweight 
for Sunday's $100,000 Citation Handicap at 1 1/8 miles on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
Scratched from the closing-day Carleton F. Burke Handicap at Oak Tree in favor 
of the Citation, Live The Dream has run some of his best races on the Hollywood 
Park turf. He was also second in last summer's Sunset Handicap behind Petite 
Ile. 
</P>
<P>
Next on the list at 120 pounds are Fly Till Dawn, the upset winner of the 
Budweiser International at Laurel last month, and Notorious Pleasure, who won 
Oak Tree's Col. F.W. Koester Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Little Brianne, who went wire-to-wire in the Las Palmas Handicap, and 
multiple-stakes winner Stylish Star are the 119-pound highweights for 
Saturday's feature, the $100,000 Dahlia Handicap at 1 1/16 miles on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
Cien Fuegos, a $450,000 yearling purchase, broke his maiden in Monday's sixth 
race at Hollywood Park and probably earned himself a spot in the Hollywood 
Prevue Breeders' Cup Stakes Nov. 23. 
</P>
<P>
The prep for the $1-million Hollywood Futurity Dec. 9, the Prevue is also 
expected to attract General Meeting and Olympio, two other 2-year-olds who were 
impressive in their maiden victories. 
</P>
<P>
Trained by Wayne Lukas, Cien Fuegos won by 6 1/2 lengths Monday under Gary 
Stevens as the 2-5 favorite. A son of Seattle Slew out of Miss Oceana, he 
covered the 6 1/2 furlongs in 1:16 3/5. Miss Oceana, who won 11 of her 19 
starts, died of complications while giving birth to Cien Fuegos. 
</P>
<P>
Cien Fuegos will be nominated to the Prevue, according to Jeff Lukas, who said, 
"We've always thought he's had a lot of potential."

Photo, COLOR, Honoring the County's War Dead: Eight-hundred American flags were 
raised Monday for a brief Veterans Day ceremony in memory of war veterans 
buried at Memory Garden Memorial Park and Mortuary in Brea. The tradition, 
which began with just six flags in 1957, was sponsored by veterans groups from 
Brea, Placentia and Fullerton, including the American Legion and Veterans of 
Foreign Wars. The flags are the original burial flags donated by each veteran's 
family. They are flown twice a year on Veterans Day and Memorial Day. There are 
more than 1,400 veterans buried in the park. Most of whom fought in World War I 
or II. KEN HIVELY / Los Angeles Times

LETTER FROM NORTH POLE DELIVERED TO CHULA VISTA -- 32 YEARS LATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Breese family was never much on writing letters -- or, as it turns out, on 
receiving them, either. 
</P>
<P>
But the Breeses got lucky a few days ago when a letter dropped out of the 
postal twilight zone into Chula Vista -- 32 years after it was mailed from the 
Nautilus, the world's first nuclear-powered submarine, during the first 
transpolar voyage under the North Pole. 
</P>
<P>
"Hell, no, I haven't got the foggiest idea what was in it. I didn't even know 
it was missing. I'd forgotten all about it," said Denny Breese, the seaman who 
penned the missing letter to his younger brother, Nick. They learned of its 
discovery last week. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a hell of a long time ago," Denny Breese added. "I was amazed, very 
surprised, to say the least, that it was found." 
</P>
<P>
The letter -- more significant for its commemorative seal and being lost for 
more than three decades than for its simple contents -- now is in the hands of 
the Breese boys' father, R. V. (Bus) Breese, the 77-year-old family patriarch 
who still lives in Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, my yes, it was a big surprise," Breese said. "Denny didn't write that 
much. Maybe once a month at the most. The whole family is like that though. 
That's what makes this all the more interesting." 
</P>
<P>
Denny Breese, now 56 and hunting sunken treasure in the Atlantic Ocean off 
North Carolina, was a 25-year-old electronics specialist when he wrote his 
brother in Chula Vista a one-page letter dated Aug. 6, 1958, three days after 
the historic voyage. 
</P>
<P>
Breese, despite his disinclination to write letters, sensed a bit of history in 
the making and hurriedly penned 15 to 20 letters to relatives and friends. 
</P>
<P>
The letters were stamped with special markings -- a large map of the North Pole 
and postmarked USS NAUTILUS. NORTH POLE. 11:15 p.m. AUG. 3, 1958 -- and sent 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick, this will be short, but I just found out that (the) mail is leaving the 
boat in about 15 minutes. Please forgive me, I promise I'll write soon as we 
get in.... I just want you to get this envelope that was stamped at the North 
Pole. Some people think they'll be worth money to collectors someday. Drop me a 
line. I'll write from England. 
</P>
<P>
 Love, your brother, 
</P>
<P>
 Denny. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nautilus' voyage was a success, but the letter disappeared. Denny Breese 
wasn't the only one to have forgotten it. 
</P>
<P>
"No, he didn't know anything about it until just the other day," said Nick's 
wife, Sandra, from Ft. Worth, Tex., where he lives now. "It was a surprise." 
</P>
<P>
Although postal officials occasionally can explain the whereabouts of missing 
letters being delivered years later -- there have been sacks of mail discovered 
in long-locked attics or closets -- no one seems to know where Denny Breese's 
letter has been all these years. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, it did not even attract the attention of the mail carrier who 
delivered it; he must have been either dead-tired at the end of the day, or 
else he regularly handles cargo from the Eisenhower era. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego postal officials say they have no idea where the letter was, but last 
week the letter arrived at the old Breese homestead in Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The Breeses moved more than 20 years ago, but the house's residents now, Kathy 
Atkinson and Samuel and Amanda Rothstein, asked neighbors and learned that Bus 
Breese still lived a few blocks away. They hand-delivered it. 
</P>
<P>
"That was awful nice of them," Breese said. "They didn't have to do that. They 
could have just thrown it away." 
</P>
<P>
Breese, a prizefighter during the Depression and a retired fire chief, said he 
will keep the letter for at least a few days until he decides how to get it to 
his son, Nick. 
</P>
<P>
Breese thinks highly of the U.S. Post Office -- "I've never had a bill lost 
yet," he said -- but he is hesitant about dropping the long-lost letter into 
another mailbox. 
</P>
<P>
"I could send it special delivery, but I don't know," he said. "The odds of it 
getting lost again are 10 million to one, but Nick might be out here soon, so 
maybe I could just wait and hand it to him. 
</P>
<P>
"That might be the best bet."

ECONOMY MAY HOBBLE GROWTH DOWNTOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two of Southern California's largest and strongest real estate developers, the 
Koll Co. and Davidson Communities Inc., nearly two weeks ago were forced to 
scrub a $111-million high-rise condominium project in downtown San Diego 
because they were unable to obtain financing. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, questions are being raised about whether the demise of the joint 
venture's Huntington project signals a change in the fortunes of downtown San 
Diego, where growth has boomed for several years. 
</P>
<P>
A top Koll official says that, although the long-term future for downtown 
high-rise construction remains bright, the short-term outlook is murky. That's 
because lenders are pulling back and requiring substantially more up-front 
equity in a project -- in essence, a large down payment -- and, in the case of 
office buildings, significantly more preleased tenants before they will make 
loans, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Others are more optimistic, cautioning not to make too much of the failure by 
Koll and its partner, Davidson, by drawing broad generalizations about what is 
happening downtown. The Huntington condominium proposal, they say, would have 
been a tough sell even before the slowdown in the national economy. 
</P>
<P>
But one thing seems to be clear, according to several people involved in 
downtown's resurgence: Downtown development is now under a new set of rules and 
pressures dictated by a number of related financial factors. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a new economic conservatism that is making real estate loans much 
tougher to come by, a trend expected to last at least for the next year or so 
and which could lead to the delay or abandonment of some projects, big and 
small. 
</P>
<P>
To some, that isn't entirely bad, as the financial marketplace puts on the 
brakes and becomes more driven by consumer demands and less speculation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're definitely in a different kind of market," said Paul G. Desrochers, a 
top official of Centre City Development Corp., the agency in charge of 
downtown's redevelopment. "It's going to be cautious, conservative growth done 
in smaller chunks than what we've seen the last couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
Desrochers was in Chicago attending an Urban Land Institute conference when the 
Koll announcement was made Nov. 2. The ULI is considered the country's leading 
urban land use association and is composed of developers, government and 
private land planners, academicians and financiers. 
</P>
<P>
"That's all we heard all week, that lenders now want a tremendous amount of 
equity (as a down payment) and preleasing. Many of the traditional lenders are 
out of the market for now," Desrochers said. "This is absolutely a national 
trend." 
</P>
<P>
The new financial factors at play include the general downturn in the national 
economy, new capital requirements imposed on the savings-and-loan industry, 
concern about the federal budget deficit, the slowdown in San Diego's and 
Southern California's housing market, renewed conservatism on the part of Far 
Eastern lenders and financial partners, market jitters over the Middle East 
crisis and predictions in the business press of a bust in Southern California's 
commercial and residential real estate markets. 
</P>
<P>
It all adds up to making it tough to get a loan. 
</P>
<P>
William R. (Biff) Porter, Koll vice president, knows all about that. He says 
that, despite what others may think, the Huntington project was financeable. 
But it was delayed, in part by the City Council as it weighed the merits of 
another proposal in an open development competition. By the time the Huntington 
was approved by the council and a negotiation agreement was made final last 
January, the financial markets had begun to shift. 
</P>
<P>
All along, Porter said, the Koll and Davidson companies had been negotiating 
agreements requiring 20% equity to qualify for a loan to build the 36-story 
edifice. But the dose of bad economic news hitting the country raised the 
equity requirement to 30%, a jump of more than $10 million, which Koll said it 
was not able to raise. 
</P>
<P>
Porter said that, as a standard business practice, Koll doesn't put up its own 
money as equity, instead raising it from other sources. In this case, the 
company had negotiated almost exclusively with Far Eastern companies. 
</P>
<P>
After first being favorable to the Huntington, the Far Eastern firms balked, in 
part because of fluctuations in the Japanese stock market, escalating real 
estate prices in Japan and higher costs imposed on them to borrow money, Porter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
An added ingredient, Porter said, were articles in national business magazines, 
such as Barron's and Fortune, that predicted a bust in Southern California's 
housing boom, particularly in the high-end market above $600,000, which was the 
Huntington's niche. 
</P>
<P>
"The new message is that development (both residential and commercial) has to 
be tenant-driven," Porter said, adding that Koll spent about $300,000 on the 
Huntington, not counting the company's staff time. "A lot of this is a reaction 
to a lot of stuff that was built (nationally) that didn't need to be built." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Porter said, he expects things in the downtown development 
business to maybe "get a little bloody before it gets better," as companies 
adjust to the new conditions. 
</P>
<P>
A bit more optimistic is Patrick Kruer, a member of the Centre City Development 
Corp. board of directors, a developer and a veteran real estate financier. 
Kruer has been a board member of Federal Home Loan Bank Board of San Francisco, 
a former member of the Federal Savings and Loan Advisory Council in Washington 
and vice chairman of the board of the California Housing Finance Agency. He is 
a current board member of the Center of Real Estate and Urban Economics at 
University of California, Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Kruer, who had opposed the Huntington, said the project didn't have the right 
location or views to command high-end condominium prices, and thus it was 
harder to obtain financing. "I hate to be right on something like this," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Banks, Kruer said, are under great pressure. He says the stock of many major 
banks is depressed and trading at 50% to 60% of its value, making it hard for 
banks to raise money and grow. "They are being much more selective" than in the 
past, and "their requirements are much tougher," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the new climate, he said, financing will become the "real linchpin" 
of the CCDC's decisions on selecting development projects. 
</P>
<P>
"More than ever, we're going to have to make sure the equity is in place to 
make a project economically feasible," Kruer said. "Highly leveraged projects 
will have difficulty getting construction financing." Although things are 
tight, they aren't impossible, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kruer believes that the specter of economic bust in California is not based on 
fact. While the state is not recession-proof, and the new economic caution is 
warranted, California and downtown San Diego are not anywhere near development 
paralysis, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Kruer bases that belief on several factors: continued high demand for housing, 
with hundreds of thousands more people coming into the state each year than are 
leaving; statewide employment growth close to twice the national average; the 
appeal of downtown San Diego to foreign investors because land prices are a 
bargain compared to Los Angeles or San Francisco, and the reality that downtown 
is no longer "the pioneering situation" it was 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Both Kruer and Porter, for example, agree that downtown remains the place to be 
now and in the long run, although some developers may have to adjust the size 
of their buildings or wait until demand dictates better conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Porter says Koll expects to build another high-rise office building next to its 
building on Broadway sometime in 1993-94, when it expects renewed demand after 
the current crop of new office buildings are nearly full. 
</P>
<P>
But, in recognition of the market, Porter says, his company expects it will 
have to prelease 45% to 50% of the building before it can get financing. In 
contrast, Koll's first office high-rise needed to be about 25% preleased to 
nail down a loan. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Porter said, the company will stay downtown and concentrate on 
smaller projects, such as mid-rise developments confined to portions of blocks, 
which he said will be easier to finance at project costs substantially less 
than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
The CCDC's Desrochers and Kruer believe downtown will continue to be a magnet 
for construction of reasonably priced rental units, noting that the luxury 
condominium market may be over-saturated with One Harbor Drive, the twin-tower 
high-rise under construction. 
</P>
<P>
That project, for example, had to have half its units sold before it was able 
to obtain financing, according to Desrochers. 
</P>
<P>
"Downtown," said Porter, "still offers good opportunities. There's no doubt it 
will continue to expand and grow."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VETERANS START WORK ON LONG-SOUGHT MEMORIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a struggle that has lasted longer than some wars, a group of Hawthorne 
veterans finally broke ground during the weekend on an armed services memorial. 
</P>
<P>
For the last five years, the Hawthorne Veterans Council has held garage sales 
and raffles, cashed in empty aluminum cans and charged a quarter a scoop for 
food at fund-raising suppers to raise money for the project . 
</P>
<P>
Despite the groundbreaking, the veterans council cannot declare victory yet. 
During the next six months, the group will use about $31,000 to install 
flagpoles and concrete slabs at the memorial site outside Hawthorne Memorial 
Center. The grand monument the veterans have in mind will have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have enough to complete the thing like we want to," said Ben 
Ainsworth, a member of the veterans council.

HOSPITAL RELEASES OFFICER WHO SURVIVED SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Patrol officer Diane Hall, 40, who was wearing a bulletproof vest when shot, 
was released from Mercy Hospital Monday afternoon in good condition, after 
surviving wounds in the chest and abdomen, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Because she was wearing the bulletproof vest, she suffered only powder burns, 
as well as bruising and abrasion where the bullets hit the jacket," the 
spokeswoman added. "She's very fortunate to have been wearing that vest." 
</P>
<P>
Police said Hall was shot by Jimmie Ray Reeves Jr., 23, who was shot and killed 
by police as he tried to escape. 
</P>
<P>
Hall and another officer had been dispatched to 30th Street and Central Avenue 
in East San Diego at 8:54 p.m. Sunday to investigate the report of a burglary 
in progress, said Lt. Dan Berglund, who heads the homicide division of the San 
Diego Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Berglund said the "ballistic vest" worn by Hall, a five-year veteran of the 
force, saved her life. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Jim Clear, a spokesman for the department, said Monday that bulletproof 
vests were optional when first introduced in 1980 but were made mandatory a 
year later. 
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's incident, the first officer on the scene, Ed Rosenbloom, checked 
the exterior of the residence and noticed a screen had been taken from the rear 
of the house, Berglund's report says. Rosenbloom then walked to the front yard 
just as the two-officer cover unit -- Hall and partner Cheryl Dean -- were 
arriving. 
</P>
<P>
The three officers walked to the back yard and heard a noise, which came from a 
man who appeared to be hiding in a cardboard box beneath a tree, Berglund said. 
As one officer attempted to make contact, the man ran away. When he was finally 
apprehended, he struggled with the three officers, Berglund added. 
</P>
<P>
Reeves then pulled Rosenbloom's gun from his holster and began firing, striking 
Hall in the chest and abdomen and on the handle of her gun, Berglund said. 
Reeves continued firing until the officers wrestled the weapon away, he added. 
</P>
<P>
When the man then attempted to flee, all three officers fired their weapons, 
killing him, Berglund's report says. Reeves died of "multiple gunshot wounds," 
a spokesman for the San Diego County medical examiner said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Reeves, described by the spokesman as an unemployed transient, was dead at the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Hall's injuries, Rosenbloom injured his hand, thumb and back. Officer 
Dean escaped injury.

ROBERT L. BOTHWELL SR.; RETIRED NAVY CAPTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert L. Bothwell Sr., a retired U.S. Navy captain and former president of the 
Woodland Hills Country Club, has died at his Woodland Hills home. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
Bothwell died Sunday of cancer, said his son James L. Bothwell. 
</P>
<P>
Born Jan. 19, 1921, in Royersford, Pa., Bothwell served two years in the U.S. 
Army in the late 1930s before switching to the Navy, graduating from the Naval 
Academy in 1943. He received master's degrees from Princeton University and the 
Naval War College. 
</P>
<P>
He saw combat during World War II as a gunnery officer in the Pacific. He later 
graduated from Naval Flight School and flew more than 90 night missions during 
the Korean War, receiving four air medals in addition to the Distinguished 
Flying Cross. 
</P>
<P>
From 1956 to 1959, he commanded air attack squadrons on the aircraft carrier 
Shangri-La, based in Coronado, Calif., and was on the staff of the Secretary of 
Defense at the Pentagon from 1963 until his retirement in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Bothwell worked for Hughes Aircraft Co. in Canoga Park from 1965 to 1985, when 
he retired as assistant manager of the firm's strike systems division. He was 
elected president of the Woodland Hills Country Club's board of directors in 
1982, serving one year, and served several additional years on the board. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife of 47 years, Inez Bothwell; sons Robert L. Bothwell 
Jr. of San Diego, Max L. Bothwell of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, and James 
L. Bothwell of Annandale, Va.; and seven grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service is planned for 2 p.m. today at Pierce Brothers-Praiswater 
Mortuary, 7245 Remmet Ave. in Canoga Park. Burial at Arlington National 
Cemetery in Virginia will follow later this week. Aftercare California 
Cremation and Burial Society is handling the arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
Donations can be made in Bothwell's name to the American Cancer Society, San 
Fernando Valley Unit.

LANDFILL HEARINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The juxtaposition of the two articles "Realtor Convicted on 2 Tax Charges" and 
"Hearing on Landfill Site Report Scheduled" on Oct. 20 is a sad commentary on 
priorities in reporting. 
</P>
<P>
We are grappling with a seriously irreversible issue: Shall we fill our 
endangered and beautiful urban canyons with "killer trash" while we criticize 
other nations for destroying their rain forests? 
</P>
<P>
Over 80 people signed up to speak at the hearing; only 24 were heard by 10 p.m. 
We asked for a continuation so that the complex "Integrated Solid Waste 
Management System" document could have full public review. We also asked for an 
extended time for written comments so many groups not notified officially could 
express themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Not one NIMBY (Not in My Back Yard) argument emerged in that meeting. People 
were opposed to landfills anywhere. Most were supporting recycling now. Veteran 
community activists are watching this process and wondering if this might not 
be an initiative issue. Then our elected officials would really find out how 
their constituents feel.

STREET WISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing as a very concerned citizen and homeowner of Sherman Oaks in 
regard to the appalling conditions on the south side of Ventura Boulevard, 
between Woodman and Ventura Canyon avenues. 
</P>
<P>
For the past several weeks, my 11-year-old daughter has been reading "50 Ways a 
Child Can Help Save Our Planet." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, she decided to walk to school instead of being driven. We began 
this new ritual this morning and were overwhelmed by the atrocious conditions 
we experienced on this stretch of the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
One of the attractions for me in moving to Sherman Oaks over 14 years ago was 
the quaintness of the neighborhood. As a longtime resident of this area, I was 
very sad to see the small shops that lined that street close. The last thing we 
need is another strip center, mini-mall or office complex. But I remained 
quiet. 
</P>
<P>
However, after viewing the disgraceful conditions along this street this 
morning, I cannot remain silent. The filth, soot, garbage and debris my 
daughter and I witnessed is an outrage. 
</P>
<P>
It is bad enough to have to view all of these once delightful shops closed down 
and boarded up, but shouldn't the owner be compelled to clean up the trash 
while he awaits his building permits? 
</P>
<P>
What an example this is setting for our young people. My child made a personal 
commitment to help clean up our air by walking to school the 1.5 miles. She 
should not be exposed to this unnecessary and flagrant environmental abuse in 
the process.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
EXPLORING SAFETY OPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yorba Linda city officials and the Fairmont Private School need to come up with 
a better way of ensuring safety for young children at a dangerous crossing near 
the school. Three youngsters were seriously injured at dusk there last week 
when a driver -- who told police that she never saw the students -- ran into 
the children crossing Valley View Avenue as they returned from a park. 
</P>
<P>
The crossing lies between existing crosswalks to the north and south on a 
thoroughfare that neighbors say has become a dangerous speedway. There doesn't 
seem to be any question that teachers take special precautions to get groups 
back and forth safely for play periods, but that clearly isn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
There is, after all, always a first time, despite the safety record the city 
says it has, and despite the good luck students at that crossing had 
previously. Just one incident is one incident too many. A crosswalk, a 
pedestrian signal or a crossing guard are obvious options. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have said that it would both be unusual and unsafe to install 
such a crosswalk in the middle of a city block where the youngsters cross to 
the park. But what good are crosswalks to the north and south of a busy school 
crossing if the need is at some place in the middle? After what happened last 
week, what additional provisions could be more unsafe than what now exists? 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the school needs to review its safety precautions. It does not 
routinely employ crosswalk guards, but the city does for its public schools. 
Obviously, the private school can learn something from the public ones. 
</P>
<P>
The recent time change has hastened the arrival of dusk and created 
late-afternoon danger. But there's a larger problem -- the increasing traffic 
and pace of life in Orange County in general. There are other pedestrian 
trouble spots around the county and this accident dramatizes the need for 
better safety provisions. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, if schools cannot provide better assurance of safety, walk the 
group the long and safe way around.

BRANDO SAYS HIS DAUGHTER TRIED TO HANG HERSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marlon Brando says that his despondent daughter, the key witness in his son's 
approaching murder trial, tried to hang herself early Sunday and is being 
maintained on life support systems at a Tahitian hospital. 
</P>
<P>
In an emotional interview with The Times, Brando said late Sunday night that 
Cheyenne Brando, 20, had attempted suicide at the family compound in Punaauia 
about 4 a.m., only days after being treated for an overdose of tranquilizers 
and antidepressant drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Cheyenne hung herself," the actor said, adding that she has been placed on a 
respirator. She is expected to live, he said, "but we don't know if there's 
been brain damage or not." 
</P>
<P>
Brando has been critical of Los Angeles County prosecutors who want to subpoena 
Cheyenne to testify at the trial of her half brother, Christian. He is accused 
of murdering her boyfriend, Dag Drollet. The actor believes the ongoing efforts 
to return her from Tahiti to testify are contributing to Cheyenne Brando's 
mental state. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County district attorney's spokesman Mike Botula said Monday that 
prosecutors have no way of verifying Cheyenne Brando's condition and will 
continue their legal fight to force her to return. 
</P>
<P>
"We are proceeding with the legal facts at hand," he said. "If it (her mental 
condition) presents itself in court, we will deal with it at that time." 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials in Tahiti confirmed that Cheyenne Brando again is under 
their care, but declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Brando said he desperately wants to be beside his daughter, whom he calls "the 
most precious thing in the world to me," but said that he cannot afford to 
jeopardize his son's trial, where he is expected to testify. 
</P>
<P>
"The (expletive) judge is going to arrest me," he said, referring to the French 
magistrate hearing a civil case against Cheyenne Brando in Tahiti, where she is 
charged with being an accessory to Drollet's murder. The magistrate has said 
that he wants to question the actor. 
</P>
<P>
"They (French authorities) would detain me by taking my passport, and I'm stuck 
in Tahiti. . . . I could be down there a year," Brando said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he remains in seclusion at his Mulholland Drive estate, where last May 
16 Drollet was shot to death by Christian Brando -- the beginning of a 
nightmarish chain of events for the reclusive Brando. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the shooting, Christian Brando -- the actor's son by his 
first wife, actress Anna Kashfi -- was jailed for three months, then released 
on bail secured by his father's beloved hilltop home. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Brando claims that the shooting occurred accidentally during a 
struggle between the two men. The fight, he said, began after Cheyenne Brando, 
who at the time was pregnant with Drollet's child, had complained that Drollet 
had beaten her. 
</P>
<P>
Cheyenne Brando flew home to Tahiti after telling police her half brother's act 
was no accident. There, she was charged in a complaint filed by the victim's 
father. She gave birth to Drollet's child weeks after his death, and has been 
hospitalized several times since then. 
</P>
<P>
She has given several conflicting statements to authorities about Drollet's 
death, at one point implicating her father and her brother's girlfriend. The 
elder Brando was in the house when the shooting occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Cheyenne Brando has been stalked by hordes of tabloid photographers and 
reporters, telling one flippantly that she would be happy to talk -- for 
$75,000. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, she was hospitalized in intensive care after a drug overdose left 
her temporarily comatose, and only days after her release she has again tried 
to take her life, her father said. 
</P>
<P>
"This case is tearing everyone apart," said Brando, who blames the district 
attorney's office -- which has been trying for five months to pressure her to 
come back to testify although French authorities have seized her passport -- 
for her present mental condition. 
</P>
<P>
He asked whether Steven Barshop, the deputy district attorney prosecuting the 
case, was "going to bring a girl back who one week takes an overdose and one 
week tries to hang herself." 
</P>
<P>
Barshop, reached by telephone late Monday, said he had no knowledge of Cheyenne 
Brando's most recent suicide attempt and refused comment on whether, if reports 
of the attempt are true, prosecutors would continue to seek her as a witness. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles defense attorney Robert Shapiro, who represents Christian Brando, 
confirmed late Monday that the young woman has been re-hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Luc Eyrol, director of Mamao hospital in Papeete, told The Times that 
French law prohibits release of information about a patient's condition without 
authorization from the family. 
</P>
<P>
Even if she is hospitalized, Botula, the prosecutor's spokesman said, "she 
could be perfectly healthy by the time she is needed to testify. We have no 
choice but to proceed as we have in trying to secure her return to the U.S. to 
testify." 
</P>
<P>
The defense claims her mental state would render her testimony worthless. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Patt Morrison contributed to this story.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEPUTY KILLS MAN WHO ALLEGEDLY PULLED GUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A sheriff's deputy in Carson shot and fatally wounded a man in a motel room 
early Monday after the man pointed a gun at the deputy, sheriff's officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Grayson, 26, of Carson was struck once in the chest about 1 a.m. at the 
Dare-U-Inn in the 17300 block of South Main Street, said Sgt. Robert Stoneman. 
</P>
<P>
Grayson was taken to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, where he died. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's officials said that two deputies, who were not identified, were on 
foot patrol when they heard loud noises from a motel room. As they walked past 
the room, three people came out. Grayson stood in the doorway. 
</P>
<P>
When deputies asked if everything was all right, Grayson went into the room, 
pulled out a handgun and pointed it toward the deputies, Stoneman said. One 
deputy fired twice. 
</P>
<P>
Stoneman said Grayson had no criminal record and that there did not appear to 
be anything illegal going on in the room. The deputies told investigators they 
did not know why Grayson drew his gun.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RATE OF BLACKS IN COLLEGE NOT SLIPPING, 
STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The college enrollment rate of young blacks is stagnating, not slipping as 
recent reports have suggested, a study released Monday in Santa Monica found. 
</P>
<P>
The study by the RAND Corp. also concluded that if black youths are to regain 
the large enrollment strides they made before the mid-1970s, they must have 
special attention in their early school years, again when they get ready to 
decide whether to go to college and once they are there. 
</P>
<P>
The study, titled "Trends in Postsecondary Enrollment of Minorities," was aimed 
at clarifying "seemingly inconsistent" research results about minority college 
enrollment, its author and RAND researcher Daniel Koretz said. 
</P>
<P>
Some reports have detected a decline in black enrollment and attribute it to an 
array of social and economic problems that especially affect young black males. 
Other surveys and research data have failed to find any such trend.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CAMPFIRE SUSPECTED IN 40-ACRE BLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A brush fire that erupted before dawn Monday in a Topanga Canyon clearing that 
teen-agers use as a hangout scorched 40 acres and shut down a canyon road but 
damaged no structures, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire began about 3:50 a.m. near Old Topanga Canyon and Zuniga roads. 
</P>
<P>
By 7 a.m., about 200 firefighters had circled the blaze, Los Angeles County 
Fire Capt. Frank Lopez said. One minor injury to a firefighter was reported. 
</P>
<P>
The fire's cause was not known, but an illegal campfire was suspected. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze started at a local landmark known as "the swings," a clearing in a 
brushy and wooded area that sheriff's deputies regularly patrol to clear out 
young people who go there to drink, light bonfires and play on swings installed 
on several trees, a sheriff's deputy said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire closed Old Topanga Canyon Road between Mulholland Highway and Topanga 
Canyon Boulevard.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OREGON HAS DIFFICULTY OBTAINING CHILD CARE 
DEBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A spokesman for the Oregon attorney general's office said that state may have a 
hard time collecting money owed by the Ecclesia Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the controversial religious group that was founded in Los Angeles 
owe the state more than $30,000 for care for children of the group, officials 
have said. 
</P>
<P>
The state took 53 Ecclesia children into custody in 1988 after the beating 
death of Dayna L. Broussard, 8-year-old daughter of group founder Eldridge 
Broussard Jr. Four group members were convicted in the death. 
</P>
<P>
A judge ruled in June that the parents must pay for the care. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Lemman of the attorney general's office said last week that the state is 
keeping tabs on their employment status. The group has formed a construction 
company, Troy's Construction, and is trying to buy property in Portland, Ore. 
Lemman said it might be difficult to force the firm to comply with orders that 
it withhold wages to meet the state payments.

CALTECH TO BE HOME FOR MOST POWERFUL RESEARCH COMPUTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The world's fastest and most powerful computer will be installed at Caltech 
next spring to aid in researching such complex scientific issues as global 
changes in the environment and climate, according to an announcement that is to 
be made today in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
The supercomputer, capable of making 32 billion operations per second, will be 
the cornerstone of a cooperative program involving 14 research institutions 
called the Concurrent Supercomputing Consortium. 
</P>
<P>
Known as the Delta System, the computer is being built by Intel Corp. as part 
of a research collaboration between the firm and Caltech. The system employs 
many high-speed microprocessors, which are linked through a communications 
network. 
</P>
<P>
The computer's performance can be enhanced by adding more microprocessors 
through a process called concurrency. The system also reveals how rapidly the 
computer business is changing because it is several times more powerful than 
the most powerful computers available just a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Such high-speed computers are essential to major research projects because they 
allow scientists to keep tabs on billions of bits of data that may change every 
second. That is true for such matters as the study of the atmosphere because 
information from millions of sensors changes continually, and only a 
supercomputer can make it possible for scientists to keep track of data and 
analyze results. 
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted that the most powerful computer in the world will be housed at 
Caltech," Thomas E. Everhart, president of Caltech, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Development of the Delta System and related Caltech research was funded by the 
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. The supercomputer will be used for a 
range of projects, including study of the depletion of the ozone layer, 
simulating aerodynamic characteristics of high-performance aircraft, the human 
genome project and various space projects by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the consortium include JPL, several national laboratories, DARPA, 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Science Foundation, 
Purdue University and Intel.

RADIO SALUTE TO VETERANS RUNS GAMUT FROM WWI TO OPERATION DESERT SHIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Winston Roche's old, blue eyes get misty when he thinks about the glory days, 
such as they were. 
</P>
<P>
He was 17, fresh out of Los Angeles High School and, as he put it, "I really 
wanted to fight the Kaiser." 
</P>
<P>
Now 92, Roche would spend 22 months "over there," through the battles of 
Chateau Thierry, Aisne-Marne and St. Mihiel; surviving mustard gas, machine-gun 
fire and misery in its more mundane forms. 
</P>
<P>
He and other soldiers would dine on French rolls plucked from the mud, washing 
them down with cold coffee from their canteens. In the Argonne, they went 42 
days without bathing. Sometimes they would rub coffee into their stubble before 
attacking it with safety razors. 
</P>
<P>
Roche likes Veterans Day. It gives the North Hollywood resident a chance to put 
on his tattered World War I victory medal -- "my favorite" -- as well as his 
French Croix de Guerre and his Purple Heart. 
</P>
<P>
With another generation of Americans facing the prospect of war -- including 
his grandson Robert, a Navy petty officer second class aboard the aircraft 
carrier Saratoga -- Veterans Day takes on added urgency. 
</P>
<P>
The old doughboy, as U.S. infantrymen were known in World War I, was among 
scores of veterans and families of servicemen who gathered Monday at Patriotic 
Hall in Los Angeles for a special Veterans Day broadcast on KABC radio by 
talk-show host Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the auditorium, the crowd listened as Jackson interviewed CBS news 
correspondent Charles Kuralt and other guests, ranging from Roche to a 
4-year-old boy whose Marine father is in Saudi Arabia as part of Operation 
Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
Wives with husbands abroad tried to control their children. Members of American 
Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars posts wore their caps and ribbons. Street 
people drifted in to partake of the free lunch; some, they said, were Vietnam 
veterans. 
</P>
<P>
"We started out feeding families as our guests. But what it's really turned 
into, we're feeding the homeless vets who occupy this area," said Nelkane 
Benton , KABC's director of community relations. "This is even better than we 
thought it would be." 
</P>
<P>
On Veterans Day, "you feel proud to be American, regardless of your present 
situation," said James Williams, a Vietnam veteran, who said he has been 
homeless for two years. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its commercial sponsors, the radio show promoted the station's 
"Operation EGBOK" -- an effort to gather 1-million Christmas cards for American 
troops in the Persian Gulf. EGBOK is an acronym for "Everything Is Going to Be 
OK." Someone placed a giant poster for the cause beneath a portrait of the 
ill-fated crew of the space shuttle Challenger. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of politics or strategic considerations, many veterans said it was 
important to support servicemen and servicewomen overseas. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing that hurt us in Vietnam wasn't the bullets or the shrapnel, 
it was the lack of support from the American people," said Simba Roberts, who 
wore camouflage clothing for the occasion. "We have to support our soldiers -- 
not the war, not the government -- but the individual soldiers." 
</P>
<P>
Among those who gathered at Patriotic Hall, a recurring theme was the hope that 
diplomatic efforts would succeed in averting war. But there was little 
optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"He was supposed to be home in January," Angela Register, watching over three 
young sons, said of her husband in Saudi Arabia. The rotation of forces has 
recently been canceled. "I just hope nothing happens. . . . God knows I need 
him home; the boys need him. Whatever happens is is God's hands, and He has to 
bring him home safely. That's what we pray." 
</P>
<P>
Another recurring theme was an expression that, if there is combat, American 
military action should be swift and decisive. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like we're headed that way, because of the buildup" of forces, said 
Sharon Deehan, a Woodland Hills hospital administrator who served as a nurse in 
Vietnam. "I think we need to get in, do what we have to do, and get the hell 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Roche also expressed hope for either a peaceful resolution or a short war. 
</P>
<P>
"You know the Vietnam vets and this post-traumatic stress syndrome? We had 
shellshock," Roche said. 
</P>
<P>
The old veteran smiled when he displayed his scarred shins and throat burned by 
mustard gas, and a finger, its tip torn off by a German bullet. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-year-old Elsye Roche, wooed 57 years ago with tales of the Great War, 
expressed hope that her grandson will not have such stories or souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
Does she think war is coming? 
</P>
<P>
"I just really don't know -- I'm not into all the intricacies," she said. "I 
just wish we can make up our minds, one way or the other."

HYDRANT AT APARTMENTS WAS PARTLY SHUT; 
</P>
<P>
THOUSAND OAKS: THE FIREPLUG WAS IN VIOLATION OF COUNTY CODE. BUT INVESTIGATORS 
SAY IT WAS NOT USED TO FIGHT THE BLAZE THAT CLAIMED BUILDINGS AT THE KNOLLS 
COMPLEX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
One of the fire hydrants at a luxury Thousand Oaks apartment complex ravaged by 
fire over the weekend had been partially turned off -- a violation of the 
county fire code, fire investigators said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The fire code states that hydrants must be working when structures are in the 
framing stage, as were about 18 of the apartment buildings destroyed Saturday 
at The Knolls complex on Avenida de los Arboles, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire investigator David Chovanec said it is unknown who turned off the hydrant, 
one of nine at the apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
However, Chovanec said it is common for contractors or subcontractors to shut 
off a hydrant in one area for brief periods of time to work on a main water 
line for plumbing purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The hydrant was reactivated by an official from the Thousand Oaks Utilities 
Department about 5 p.m. Saturday, two hours after the fire started, said 
Assistant Fire Chief Jim Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said the hydrant was not close to the fire and was never used to battle 
the blaze Saturday. He said fire hydrants go in and out of service all the 
time, and hydrant placement often is designed to have one go out of service, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as we know it's out of service, we can handle it," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Marshal Dick Wilson said that after an investigation Sunday, officials 
"came away feeling everything was proper and in place." 
</P>
<P>
When firefighters had trouble drawing sufficient water supplies Saturday, they 
initially complained that the water system was not working properly. However, 
officials now believe that low water pressure was caused by their efforts, 
which overwhelmed the system, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The water system at the complex is designed by Fire Department standards to 
deliver about 2,250 gallons of water per minute, Smith said. But the first two 
engines on the scene each were using 1,000 gallons of water per minute. As more 
engines tapped into the system, the water pressure dropped, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department sets standards for complexes based on how much water is 
needed to defend completed structures, which are protected from fire with 
stucco walls on the exterior and wallboard on the interior. 
</P>
<P>
But about 18 of the buildings that burned to the ground were just wood framing, 
extremely vulnerable to fire, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, water pressure was lowered when pipes burst in some of the burning 
buildings as they collapsed and spilled about 1,000 gallons of water per minute 
into the streets, officials said. The pipes were clamped off by midnight, Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials tapped into water supplies from a neighboring complex about two 
hours after the fire began, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, firefighters were still hampered by high winds and low humidity, which 
at one point contributed to a firestorm, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was similar to World War II incendiary bombings," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Newport Beach-based Regis Homes Corp., the project's co-owner, 
declined comment. Officials at the Thousand Oaks offices of the Lang Ranch Co., 
the project's co-owner and developer, could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was ignited about 3 p.m. Saturday by a plumber using a torch to solder 
a pipe, officials said. The fire spread quickly to adjacent buildings, which 
were close together and in the open wood-framing stage of construction, 
officials said. It slowed when it reached buildings with stucco, but some of 
those also suffered damage. 
</P>
<P>
The fire caused $10 million damage to structures and $2 million to construction 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two buildings burned to the ground, and three others were heavily 
damaged. Another building also suffered minor damage, Chovanec said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was contained about 9 p.m. Saturday, and crews continued to work 
Sunday, bulldozing buildings and dousing them with water so smoldering embers 
would not reignite. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, fire officials continued to field calls from concerned neighbors who 
noticed smoke from smoldering embers in the area. A fire engine was stationed 
at the complex for safekeeping, officials said.

DEPUTY APPEALS SUSPENSION OVER USE OF NIGHTSTICK;

<P>
A sheriff's deputy who allegedly violated department policy by jabbing a 
suspect in the head with a baton has appealed his superiors' decision to 
suspend him. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Civil Service Commission is scheduled to hear arguments today to 
decide whether to overturn the three-day suspension of Deputy Steven Capuano. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two Camarillo brothers arrested by Capuano on Dec. 28, 1989, 
have filed a civil rights suit alleging police brutality. 
</P>
<P>
Capuano used only the force necessary to restrain the suspect, said Joel Block, 
Capuano's attorney from the Santa Monica law firm of Silver, Goldwasser &amp; 
Shaeffer. 
</P>
<P>
But according to the Sheriff's Department, Capuano used undue force and applied 
the potentially dangerous baton in violation of department policy when he 
arrested Michael Harvey on suspicion of stealing a vehicle in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
"In the struggle Capuano found himself in, he appears to have gone overboard," 
said Lawrence Matheney, an assistant county counsel who is representing the 
Sheriff's Department in the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Capuano and Deputy Timothy Cowgill were told that brothers Christopher and 
Michael Harvey had stolen a vehicle belonging to their employer, Marvin McCabe 
Jr. McCabe had fired them from his sheet-metal firm earlier that day, Matheney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies found the truck parked across the street from the Harveys' house 
and arrested Christopher Harvey without incident when he came out of the house. 
</P>
<P>
However, when his brother emerged, Christopher Harvey yelled for him to return 
to the house to avoid arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Believing that Michael Harvey was going to flee, Capuano put his hand around 
Harvey's arm and put him face-down on the lawn, Matheney said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Harvey allegedly clasped his hands under his chest, apparently so 
deputies could not handcuff him, officials said. He was being noncooperative 
but was not combative, Matheney said. 
</P>
<P>
Capuano apparently noticed that his nightstick had fallen out of his holster, 
Matheney said. The deputy later said he was afraid the suspect would grab the 
stick and use it as a weapon, Matheney said. 
</P>
<P>
Capuano picked up the nightstick and used it at the back of Michael Harvey's 
neck to hold down his head, Matheney said. 
</P>
<P>
He apparently "jabbed" Harvey a couple of times on the side of the head and cut 
his ear, breaking the skin, Matheney said. Eventually, Michael Harvey was 
handcuffed, and the brothers were taken to the Camarillo station for 
questioning, Matheney said. 
</P>
<P>
It was subsequently discovered that one of the brothers had been using the 
truck for several years to travel to and from work. When the brothers were 
fired, they said they would take the truck home and empty out their belongings, 
Matheney said. McCabe reported the truck stolen, Matheney said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the brothers apparently had put dog feces in the cab of the 
truck and put powdered cleanser in the gas tank, Matheney said. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers were never booked, and charges were never filed, Matheney said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Sheriff's Department reprimanded Capuano, ordering a suspension that 
cost him $400 to $500 in lost wages, Matheney said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Sheriff Oscar Fuller said in a May 10 letter to Capuano that it is 
against department policy to intentionally strike a person above the shoulders 
with a baton. In addition, Fuller said Capuano put the baton behind Michael 
Harvey's head and leaned on it with both hands, which "could have caused 
serious, if not lethal, injuries." 
</P>
<P>
Capuano further violated policy by failing to document the actions in a 
memorandum to his division commander, Fuller said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Capuano denied some of the actions took place and said the penalty was 
excessive for his alleged conduct. 
</P>
<P>
"He admitted to using a baton -- to using a small portion of it to prod the 
suspect in the side," Block said. "It wasn't like any swinging blows of any 
kind." 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Block said, Capuano slipped and nicked the suspect slightly in 
the ear. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Harvey brothers have filed a lawsuit against Capuano, Cowgill, 
the Sheriff's Department, McCabe and Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The Harveys' suit, which was filed Oct. 3 in the 2nd U.S. District Court in Los 
Angeles, asks for $1 million in compensatory damages and an unspecified amount 
in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
It alleges, among other things, that the Harveys' civil rights were violated 
when the deputies were not properly disciplined for illegal assaults on the 
Harveys. It also alleges that they were put under emotional distress when 
McCabe issued a false statement to police, and that they were falsely 
imprisoned when they were taken into police custody. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the suit charges that excessive force was used by the deputies, 
such as when one of them held Michael Harvey as the other kicked him. As a 
result, Harvey suffered injuries, including cuts, bruises, pain and mental 
suffering. 
</P>
<P>
And it alleges that the county and Sheriff's Department have failed to properly 
investigate such incidents and discipline the officers involved.

DEVELOPER ASSAILS MAYOR'S COMMENTS

<P>
The lawyer for a development company that had its affordable-housing project 
put on hold last week by the Ventura City Council accused the city's mayor 
Monday of making "spurious allegations" against his client. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Mitchel B. Kahn of Oxnard said Ventura Mayor Richard Francis repeated 
"false reports and accusations" against KNM Development Co. and its president, 
Ernest T. Mansi, in public meetings and to the press. 
</P>
<P>
These reports, Kahn said, were fabricated by opponents of a 147-unit KNM 
affordable-housing project in east Ventura to discredit the developer and halt 
the planned development. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Ventura City Council voted unanimously to postpone voting on the 
project, pending a city attorney's investigation into the status of at least 10 
lawsuits allegedly involving development projects linked to Mansi. 
</P>
<P>
The vote followed Francis' disclosure that he received information from unnamed 
residents living near the proposed KNM project, alleging that Mansi and the 
development companies he controls have been involved in significant litigation 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not . . . necessary to provide a point-by-point refutation to each of 
the spurious allegations made about KNM Development Co. Inc. or Mr. Mansi since 
we believe the city attorney will capably review each and every concern 
expressed in the media and in the public meetings by the mayor and provide the 
City Council with accurate information, which will reaffirm the good names of 
Ernest T. Mansi and KNM Development Co. Inc.," Kahn said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 2, Francis said in an interview that a lawsuit linked Mansi to a 
condominium project in Oxnard in which a roof collapsed. But Kahn said Mansi 
was not involved in any such projects. 
</P>
<P>
Francis was out of town Monday and could not be reached for comment. SANTIAGO

MAN COLLAPSES AS WARRANT IS SERVED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 25-year-old man, apparently shocked when he saw police, collapsed and 
reportedly suffered a seizure during a drug bust in Ventura, during which seven 
Ventura residents were arrested, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Todd Trisler, 25, was hospitalized after Ventura police and the Ventura 
County district attorney's office served a search warrant about 1 a.m. Saturday 
at the Country Inn at Ventura at 298 S. Chestnut St., police said. 
</P>
<P>
A friend of Trisler said the man had been taking drugs, drinking and had 
asthma, Police Sgt. Steve Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
The bust, which netted about five ounces of methamphetamine worth about $6,000, 
occurred after detectives learned that Trisler and his brother, Eugene, were 
selling drugs at the hotel, Bowman said. Police obtained a search warrant for 
the hotel room and for Eugene Trisler's cars, Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
When the warrant was served, Michael Trisler and Kevin Scott Izer, 24, were in 
the room, where police found a half-ounce of methamphetamine, he said. 
</P>
<P>
After Michael Trisler collapsed, he was taken to Ventura County Medical Center 
for observation. He was released that afternoon and arrested on outstanding 
warrants and on suspicion of possessing methamphetamine for sale and of being 
under the influence of drugs, Bowman said. He was being held in the Ventura 
County Jail on $25,500 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Izer gave several false names before telling officers his identity, Bowman 
said. He was arrested on suspicion of possessing drugs for sale and on 
outstanding warrants, and was being held in the Ventura County Jail on $11,452 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Trisler returned to the room just after Michael was taken to the 
hospital. A search of his car revealed four ounces of methamphetamine, and he 
was arrested on suspicion of being under the influence of drugs and of 
possessing methamphetamine for sale, Bowman said. He was being held in the 
County Jail on $10,000 bail, a jail spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Trisler's wife, Shelly, 26; Zachary Donald Lee, 20; Marcy Lynn Ramsdell, 
23, and Candace Marie Leith, 30, returned to the hotel room after Eugene was 
arrested, Bowman said. A small amount of methamphetamine was found in the 
purses of Leith and Shelly Trisler, and they were arrested on suspicion of 
possessing methamphetamine and of being under the influence of drugs, Bowman 
said. Shelly Trisler was being held in the Ventura County Jail on $5,000 bail 
and Leith was released from jail, a jail spokesman said. 
</P>

Lee and Ramsdell were arrested on suspicion of being under the influence. CAROL

COUNCIL TO WEIGH BAN ON ALCOHOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THIA BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ojai officials will consider a ban on alcohol consumption in all public parks 
and on city sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council will discuss the request tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Lt. Larry Weimer said he is seeking the ban on alcohol because 
drinking by adults at Little League games has been a problem for years. 
</P>
<P>
Weimer said several fights among rowdy fans and minor accidents involving drunk 
drivers prompted his request, along with continuing problems in enforcing a 
vague city law. The law prohibits drinking on public roads and in parking lots 
but does not mention sidewalks. One bleacher at Sarzotti Park actually occupies 
a sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
Weimer, who serves as the city's police chief, wants the law to be clearer and 
to contain a section making it illegal to drink alcohol in any city park 
without a special permit. Event sponsors would apply to the city to obtain a 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Andy Belknap is recommending that the matter be referred to the 
city's Parks and Recreation Commission for further review and public hearings.

DEADLINE SET FOR EPA DECISION ON STRICTER SEWAGE STANDARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congress has set a Nov. 30 deadline for a federal decision on whether to 
require more intensive treatment of the sewage being pumped into the ocean off 
the Palos Verdes Peninsula at a rate of 380 million gallons a day. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is the timing of an Environmental Protection Agency ruling on a waiver 
request by the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts. 
</P>
<P>
The sewage agency wants to be exempted from tighter treatment standards 
affecting the effluent it sends into the ocean from its giant Carson sewage 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
The Nov. 30 deadline for the EPA ruling, contained in an appropriations bill 
signed Monday by President Bush, was enacted at the request of U.S. Rep. Mel 
Levine (D-Santa Monica). 
</P>
<P>
Levine said the measure will end more than a decade of delays in removing what 
he said is one of the most serious environmental threats to Los Angeles 
County's coastal waters. 
</P>
<P>
Sewage officials said the deadline will hamper the EPA's ability to weigh their 
argument that tighter standards are unnecessary, costly and counterproductive. 
Sanitation districts spokesman Joe Haworth said the measure "reduces our 
chances for fair consideration."

MIRACLE MOMS; 
</P>
<P>
CANCER ONCE MEANT END OF A PREGNANCY; CHEMOTHERAPY HAS CHANGED THAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LANIE JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new mother studied the petal-pink baby sleeping beside her. 
</P>
<P>
"I call him my little miracle baby," Pam Baird said as she gazed at 8-week-old 
Nathan. 
</P>
<P>
Miracle indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Baird learned she had breast cancer not long after she learned she was 
pregnant. A nationally known oncologist urged an immediate abortion, then 
chemotherapy, as her best chance to survive. 
</P>
<P>
But after consulting more than a dozen specialists and a hospital ethics 
committee, Baird, like a growing number of pregnant women with cancer, decided 
to try to beat the disease -- and keep her baby. 
</P>
<P>
After a mastectomy, she began an aggressive course of chemotherapy. Every few 
weeks for most of her pregnancy, Baird reported to the Breast Care Center in 
Orange for injections of three anti-cancer drugs. Sometimes the powerful toxins 
made her vomit. Sometimes her blond curls fell out in handfuls. And sometimes 
-- scared for her baby and whether she would live to raise him -- all she could 
do was cry. 
</P>
<P>
But once a month, at the obstetrician's office, Baird was reassured by a 
black-and-white ultrasound image that showed a normal baby curled tightly 
inside her. 
</P>
<P>
In August, about five weeks early, Baird, 35, delivered a healthy, 5-pound, 
4-ounce boy. And this week, after finishing her last chemotherapy treatment, 
she and her husband, Rodger, celebrated with champagne. 
</P>
<P>
Baird's cancer is in remission, her current oncologist, David Margileth said, 
adding: "Here's a breast cancer patient I feel optimistic about. . . . Here's a 
woman I think will be around to raise her baby." 
</P>
<P>
Cancer is rare in pregnancy. A spokeswoman from the National Cancer Institute 
estimated that a malignancy occurs once in a thousand pregnancies. Breast 
cancer occurs once in every 3,500 pregnancies. (Cancer occurs in 36 out of 
1,000 people in the general population.) 
</P>
<P>
But when it does occur, it raises deep emotional and ethical questions for 
patients and their doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Should the mother-to-be have an abortion? Can she afford to delay cancer 
treatment until her baby is mature enough for delivery? Will the baby be harmed 
by chemotherapy? And will the mother live to care for her child? 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, obstetricians and oncologists say, the standard 
recommendation when breast cancer occurred during pregnancy was an immediate 
abortion followed by mastectomy, radiation or chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, an abortion had been recommended because the physician was 
uncomfortable about doing the treatments necessary for the mother for fear of 
injuring the fetus," said Dr. Frankie Ann Holmes, an assistant professor of 
medical oncology at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Today, some doctors still advocate abortion, but many others, including Holmes, 
are convinced that "you don't have to terminate." 
</P>
<P>
Radiation therapy is still considered harmful to the baby during all stages of 
pregnancy, and diagnostic abdominal X-rays have been associated with a high 
risk of leukemia after birth and other malignancies, some doctors report. 
</P>
<P>
But chemotherapy is a different story. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-cancer drugs can harm a baby during the first trimester when the heart, 
lungs and other organs are developing, medical articles have reported. But many 
of the same drugs can be used safely in the second and third trimester, Holmes, 
other oncologists and obstetricians have reported. 
</P>
<P>
At the Houston center, for instance, four breast cancer patients who had 
chemotherapy during pregnancy gave birth to normal babies this year, Holmes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some doctors admit they are uncomfortable when it comes to treating a 
pregnant woman for cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody kind of wrings their hands a little bit," said Dr. Robert Dillman, 
director of the Hoag Cancer Center in Newport Beach. "You really would like to 
get the fetus out." 
</P>
<P>
Margileth said that as Baird's pregnancy continued during the chemotherapy, "I 
tossed and turned about this. . . . Are we doing the right thing?" 
</P>
<P>
Margileth said he was also concerned that the normally happy experience of 
pregnancy had become a troubling one because of the cancer. "Here's this nice, 
3-to-4-month pregnant person that you just wish was shopping at South Coast 
Plaza for maternity clothes -- rather than getting adriamcyin (a chemotherapy 
agent)," Margileth said. 
</P>
<P>
Another concern: There is little data showing the long-term effects of 
chemotherapy on the child. Doctors say they simply don't know if the children 
will develop major problems later, such as infertility or leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
"We worry," said Dr. Gerald Gilchrist, chairman of pediatrics at the Mayo 
Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and of the American Academy of Pediatric's section 
on hematology and oncology. He added: "I don't think anyone knows." 
</P>
<P>
Baird noticed a lump in her right breast late last January, shortly after she 
had weaned her first son, Rory, now 17 months. Not long after that, a home 
pregnancy test and then a visit to Orange obstetrician Peter Anzaldo confirmed 
she was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Anzaldo suggested that the breast lump might be caused by a clogged milk duct, 
Baird said, but sent her to the Breast Center for a more detailed exam. 
</P>
<P>
A biopsy revealed a large, cancerous tumor. And in March, as Baird entered her 
second trimester, she had a mastectomy. That surgery showed her cancer had 
spread, invading one lymph node. Thus, the debate began in earnest. Should 
Baird abort? Should she continue her pregnancy and have chemotherapy? 
</P>
<P>
Baird wasn't sure what to do. "I had a 10-month-old son. I didn't want to die 
of breast cancer and leave him without a mother. . . . But I didn't want to 
have an abortion." 
</P>
<P>
Margileth began researching the issue, reading journal articles and contacting 
experts around the country. When his first contact, a renowned breast cancer 
specialist, emphatically recommended abortion, Baird spent a sleepless week in 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
But Margileth continued his inquiries, finding many oncologists who thought 
Baird could continue her pregnancy and start chemotherapy in the second 
trimester. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Baird's family and friends did their own research. Her brother, a 
medical student, sent copies of the few nationally reported studies on cancer 
in pregnancy. A friend, an oncology nurse, talked to experts at the National 
Institutes of Health. Her mother, who was also being treated for breast cancer, 
talked to doctors. 
</P>
<P>
And her husband, Rodger, an environmental chemist, asked the National Cancer 
Institute for a list of reports on pregnant women with cancer, then wrote to 
their authors asking how the babies had fared. 
</P>
<P>
The three doctors who responded offered good news: The babies were normal. 
Exulted Korean obstetrician Doo Sang Kim: "The bottom line is, 'The baby is now 
4 years and 5 months old and very healthy!' " Dr. Thomas G. Day Jr., director 
of gynecologic oncology at the James Graham Brown Cancer Center in Louisville, 
Ky, wrote: "I would like to reassure you that if chemotherapy is started after 
12 to 14 weeks, it is probably safe." 
</P>
<P>
The Bairds took one more step. At Anzaldo's suggestion, they asked St. Joseph 
Health System's perinatal bioethics committee to review their case. A 25-member 
committee that included doctors, a geneticist, a social worker and a priest 
listened as Anzaldo presented diverse opinions on what to do. The committee 
provided a forum for the issues, but no recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Rodger Baird called the meeting "cathartic. They didn't have any 
lectures for us. I spent half the time asking technical questions of the 
geneticist." 
</P>
<P>
But when it ended, the Bairds had come to a conclusion. Three days later, in 
her 15th week of pregnancy, Pam Baird received her first dose of chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I had it, I just cried," she recalled. "It was scary" to know 
she was pregnant and yet three powerful, toxic drugs -- Adriamycin, Cytoxan and 
an agent called 5 Fu -- were coursing through her veins. 
</P>
<P>
Although she became nauseated and her hair fell out, the treatments never 
seemed to affect the baby, Baird said. Each month, "I just relied on Dr. 
Anzaldo that everything was all right. At each visit, he took a sonogram and I 
could see the baby move." 
</P>
<P>
Nathan Trilling Baird was born prematurely, by Cesarean section, after Baird's 
amniotic fluid began leaking in the eighth month of her pregnancy. Anzaldo does 
not believe the anti-cancer drugs caused the premature birth or affected the 
baby. 
</P>
<P>
The Bairds are thankful -- and still a little amazed -- that chemotherapy 
didn't hurt their son. "These are really nasty compounds," Rodger Baird said. 
"But the baby's definitely healthy." 
</P>
<P>
As for Pam Baird, she is busy caring for cuddly Nathan as well as trying to 
keep track of Rory, an active toddler. 
</P>
<P>
And she has some suggestions for other women who might find themselves pregnant 
and diagnosed with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't just rely on one doctor," she advised. "Take the initiative to research 
it. Don't just go on blind faith." 
</P>
<P>
The Bairds recently wrote to the three cancer specialists they had heard from, 
thanking them for their responses and reporting that mother and baby were fine. 
</P>
<P>
And Pam Baird said she was considering sending one more letter -- and a picture 
of Nathan -- to the prominent breast cancer specialist who had urged an 
abortion. The note will be brief, Baird said: "This is the baby we wouldn't 
have had."

GERMANY: FACING THE FEARS; 
</P>
<P>
REUNIFICATION: A SYMPOSIUM ORGANIZED BY THE GOETHE-INSTITUT AND UCLA QUESTIONS 
HOW THE NEW GERMANY WILL DIFFER FROM THE OLD, DIVIDED ONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN HENDRIX, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Is Germany going to frighten the world again? 
</P>
<P>
Jorg von Uthmann, a New York-based correspondent for a German newspaper, 
attempted to answer his own question with a reassuring assessment of the new 
Germany's future. 
</P>
<P>
"Germans have discovered that to dine in Strasbourg or to own a house in 
Tuscany, they do not have to conquer the soil." 
</P>
<P>
No sooner were the words out of his mouth, then a wit in the back of the room 
called out a new option: "Buy it!" 
</P>
<P>
The laughter was immediate and hearty, one more indication that fears of the 
newly reunified Germany's economic power co-exist with -- and for some, 
overshadow -- fears of a militarist state. 
</P>
<P>
Such fears were on the agenda of "Educating Fritz," a symposium on 
German-American relations organized by the Goethe-Institut Los Angeles in 
collaboration with UCLA's history department. 
</P>
<P>
The three-day gathering of scholars, politicians, political activists and 
writers at the Beverly Hills library closed Sunday with more questions than 
conclusions. But the frankness of the questioning -- with fears, prejudices and 
traumatic memories aired so openly -- was an indicator to most who attended 
that the symposium was a success and such questioning is urgently needed. 
</P>
<P>
Humor surfaced repeatedly, in spite of the fact that many panelists presented 
their remarks in the form of scholarly papers -- heavily referenced and 
detailed -- read in monotone. Humor, however, never obscured the seriousness of 
the occasion. The symposium took place, as one member of the audience reminded 
everyone at the closing session, "in the shadow of the Third Reich." 
</P>
<P>
Stereotypes about Germans were explored. Anton Kaes, a professor of German 
literature and film at UC Berkeley, listed such characteristics as 
aggressiveness, arrogance, recklessness, self-pity, insensitivity and a desire 
to be liked. He reminded the audience that such traits were attributed to 
Germans recently and at a high level, during a meeting between British Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher and some of her top advisers. 
</P>
<P>
In book after book on the Germans, Kaes said, a radical distrust is evident. 
Three major wars in 70 years (1870, 1914, 1939), he said, have led many 
historians to describe "being German as an incurable disease." Even Time 
magazine got into the act, he said, offering a cover story on a "prescription 
for Germany," diagnosing a bad case of psychocultural aggressiveness, paranoia, 
and megalomania. 
</P>
<P>
"Fear is on the agenda again," Kaes said. 
</P>
<P>
Several panelists alluded to the question: Are German and Nazi interchangeable 
terms? Many Americans and West Europeans seem to think so, according to several 
speakers. 
</P>
<P>
Marion Countess Donhoff, an 82-year-old self-described "Prussian" whose family 
was active in the resistance against Hitler, gave a historical overview. Chief 
editor of the German weekly, "Die Zeit" since 1973, the countess said the 
Allied Powers refusal to distinguish between Germans and Nazis seriously 
damaged the opposition's strength. 
</P>
<P>
Looking toward the future of a reunified Germany, she acknowledged: "Our allies 
are scared. Each state is anxious that with such economic power, Germany may 
succumb to the temptation of converting economic power to political power." 
</P>
<P>
But Donhoff reminded the audience that two postwar generations have been 
educated to think in terms of freedom and tolerance rather than 
authoritarianism, based on education policies set by the British and Americans 
during the occupation, and said the majority of Germans do not aspire to 
dominate, but to merge into Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't let judgments that were once justified become prejudices," at such a 
crucial time, she urged, lest "they become self-fulfilling prophecies." 
</P>
<P>
Although scholarly in presentation, the symposium was open to the public. The 
general public, however, did not show up. Rather, people with some personal, 
and traumatic, attachment to the subject were drawn there. 
</P>
<P>
Eleanore Boer of Los Angeles stood up and announced she had been a member of 
the Hitler Youth Movement in east Prussia, now Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Grimacing and breaking into tears, she said, "It is a most horrible thing for a 
young person to realize all of a sudden you had been lied to. 'You are nothing. 
Your people are everything,' we were told." 
</P>
<P>
Calling out to her from across the room, while the scholars looked on, Anna 
Fischer, a Holocaust survivor from Poland, asked her, "Did you honestly believe 
you were ubermenschen (supermen)? I was a slave laborer. I was all the time 
thinking about the young people -- what were they thinking? You were being 
indoctrinated about the evils of the Jews." 
</P>
<P>
The two women continued on for a few dramatic moments, Boer at one point 
singing some lines of a racist song that she shocked her mother with as a young 
girl. 
</P>
<P>
" 'What are you thinking about when you sing that?' my mother asked me. "I'm 
not thinking about anything. It's just a song,' and it was true. I didn't 
think." 
</P>
<P>
Kurt Margulies, an Austrian-born Jew, who lost many of his family members 
during the Holocaust, repeatedly asked: "So, can there be another Hitler?" He 
is convinced there can be, and quoted Germans who, he said, had themselves 
predicted such a calamity if two conditions were met: reunification, and 
wide-scale unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely not," was the consensus of the experts in the room, whether 
Germans, Americans, Jews or Gentiles. 
</P>
<P>
"Germany is really different (now)," Henryk Broder, correspondent for the 
Jerusalem Post in Germany and Poland, said. A German-born Jew himself, Broder 
said the question of another Hitler was irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
"The only question now important," Broder said, "is how Germany will deal with 
its own history, its own future." 
</P>
<P>
His observation echoed that of another Jew, Michael Nutkiewicz. As director of 
the Martyrs' Memorial and Museum of the Holocaust at the Jewish Federation of 
Los Angeles, Hitler and the Holocaust are never far from his consciousness, yet 
hearing the same question about another Hitler on Friday, he said, "I find it 
an odd question at this point. It's a question only an older person would ask. 
The most dangerous question I can ask of Germany is, 'How tolerant is the 
society? Is it possible to become pluralistic? If not, how will they treat 
non-German elements?' " 
</P>
<P>
Nutkiewicz said that one of the great ironies of postwar reality was that a 
similar conference could be held on Israel. "The postwar mentality, pluralism, 
statehood -- they have very similar problems. . . . Both peoples, coming out of 
a very common experience, are incredibly self-critical, hypersensitive about 
history, and that's all for the good." 
</P>
<P>
The one panelist who saw the most indicators in modern Germany of nationalism, 
fascism and totalitarianism was Petra Kelly, member of Germany's Parliament and 
leader of the Greens party. She delivered a staggering negative list of signs 
and portents that added up to an indictment: Forbidden lyrics from the past 
heard being sung on Hitler's birthday; omissions of any reference to the 
Holocaust in the reunification treaty; echoes of Hitler's "1,000-year reich" in 
current references to the "next 1,000 years of peace and prosperity"; 
limitations on the immigration of Soviet Jews; deportation of Vietnamese 
students and workers from East Germany, with people speaking openly of being 
"Vietnamese-free"; and, "most painful, the West German merchants of death, who 
are without morals" in their dealing with Iraq, and, before, Libya, selling 
them chemicals for warfare. 
</P>
<P>
Without denying any of it, Donhoff argued it was unfair of Kelly to offer her 
description as "the only picture" of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Taking Kelly on, political scientist Joyce Mushaben of Georgetown University 
told her, "Democracy presumes a positive concept of human nature. If you do not 
believe in the possibility of human change and reform, you should resort to an 
enlightened despot." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the proceedings the Germans underscored their gratitude to America, 
starting with occupation policies that helped them rebuild and become the power 
they are today. With some irony, Americans, smarting over their current 
economic decline, were reminded of early plans, discussed seriously during the 
war, to decentralize Germany and turn it into an agrarian and pastoral society. 
</P>
<P>
As much as the financial help, however, the Germans seemed grateful for the 
lessons in tolerance, freedom and the capacity to look to the future that 
Americans brought them.

LACK OF TALENT PULLS PLUG ON 'RADIO HOUR'

<P>
It's not even Thanksgiving yet, but already the first Christmas play of the 
season has weighed in. 
</P>
<P>
Are we lucky? No, we are not. 
</P>
<P>
This is hardly a heavy weigh-in at the North Coast Repertory Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"The 1940's Radio Hour," by UCSD professor Walton Jones, is so light-headed and 
fragile in concept that it dissolves like so many snowflakes in front of a 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
The setting is a live radio broadcast from New York on Dec. 21, 1942, and 
revolves around the lives of the producers, performers and stage hands. Cliched 
character sketches take up a lot of our time, but they are not the heart of the 
show. They seem to exist just to perform more than a dozen period songs, the 
show's real star. The cast also does live ads and comedy sketches. 
</P>
<P>
This approach might have worked -- if more than one of them could sing. 
</P>
<P>
Nostalgia alone might have carried the show had the casting been right. This 
show needs singers who can belt and croon solos in 1940s style as if they are 
stars. Instead, what we have is a cast ranging from non-singers trying to act 
the part of vocalists to novice singers who lack force in delivery. The bumpy 
musical direction by Don Le Master doesn't help, either. 
</P>
<P>
But, with the exception of Tracy M. Hughes, who belts out a memorable "I Got It 
Bad and That Ain't Good" as singer Geneva Lee Browne, there is no one who can 
really sell a song. And that ain't good. To the performers' credit, however, 
they do better on the harmonies. 
</P>
<P>
Director Daniel Yurgaitis, who also did the choreography, keeps the pace 
frenetic. In part, that's in keeping with the chaotic feeling on the set of a 
live program. But it also seems a vain attempt to cover up the hollows at the 
center of this talent pool. And there is no amount of funny business that can 
cover that up. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Seger, with experience in radio announcing, seems well cast as radio 
producer Clifton A. Feddington. But, when they give him a song to sing? Please. 
Likewise, Stanley Madruga, a very funny actor, had no business being cast as 
lead singer Johnny Cantone. Even if Johnny is a drunk and a has-been, he should 
at least have the semblance of a good voice -- producers don't keep stars on 
for charity. 
</P>
<P>
Another piece of mystery casting is Michael Collins, who is called on to play a 
trumpet and sing as band member Biff Baker. He does neither with any authority. 
</P>
<P>
Supporting singers Sarah Lang (as the hot platinum-blonde Ginger Brooks) and 
Michele Aimee Moore (as the prissy schoolgirl Connie Miller) have adequate 
voices, but both are undercut by John-Bryan Davis' costumes and wigs. Davis, 
who has had finer moments in other productions, has the supposedly sexy Brooks 
looking downright dowdy in a somber navy blue dress and a wig that looks like 
it is weighing down her head. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, meanwhile, who is carrying on a romance with lead-singer-to-be B.J. 
Gibson (John Grzesiak), is unattractively adorned in a white blouse and skirt 
with mousy brown locks. 
</P>
<P>
Only Nicole Santina as singer Ann Collier looks elegant in a period-perfect 
hairdo wearing a sleek black number with slits up her sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
A good sense of atmosphere is provided by the rest of the ensemble -- which has 
its strength in the acting department. Some nice light-footed dance numbers 
thrown in by Grzesiak are also a plus. 
</P>
<P>
But the best part of the show is the grittily authentic set and lighting by 
Ocie Robinson. That alone may bring back memories. The current talk of war in 
the Middle East may also bring back thoughts of the conflicts of 1942. But does 
the play have anything to say besides that? Maybe just this: 
</P>
<P>
Even though the North Coast is a non-Equity (non-union) company, it needs to 
look harder for talent. San Diego is a city that has a lot of fine amateur 
voices that should have been able to handle this material. And, if the talent 
wasn't there, this show shouldn't have been, either. 
</P>
<P>

INDEPENDENT HOLLYWOOD COMPANY HIRES THE HOMELESS FOR 'JEREMIAH POLLOCK'

LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A white Lincoln Continental with two well-dressed couples inside slows down to 
a near-crawl, four faces all but pressed against the windows, as it cruises 
eastward on 9th Street in the early morning hours. Though they aren't about to 
stop and ask questions, this being one of the most crime-ridden neighborhoods 
in downtown Los Angeles, the couples can't help but stare at the klieg 
light-illuminated commotion on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
A group of about 35 shabbily dressed men, most of them black, seems to be 
clamoring for someone's attention in front of a motion picture camera mounted 
on a crane. The Continental driver and passengers no doubt are wondering if the 
camera subjects are homeless people causing some sort of scene or merely 
actors. 
</P>
<P>
The answer: both. 
</P>
<P>
Skid Row denizens have been recruited not only as extras but as supporting 
actors and even crew members on the set of "Jeremiah Pollock: The Life of an 
American Saint," an independently produced drama shooting on location downtown 
and in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Hiring street people is, in the selfish sense, an attempt at gleaning utmost 
authenticity by using the real homeless McCoys, and, on a more altruistic 
level, an attempt to put something back into the community while taking 
dramatic license from it. 
</P>
<P>
The steps taken have been unusual for a Hollywood production: Three homeless 
people have been hired as paid interns, each of whom will, at the end of 
production, be provided with first and last months' rent and security deposit 
money in order to hold down an apartment while looking for the next job. A 
small percentage of the film's pre-profit receipts as well as net gross have 
been earmarked for homeless charities. And then there are those -- some down on 
their luck, some mentally ill -- who've been picked to be in the movie. 
</P>
<P>
As written and directed by Eames Demetrios, an award-winning documentarian 
making his first dramatic film, "Jeremiah Pollock" is a heavily stylized, 
tragicomic fable about a wealthy computer wizard who takes drastic measures to 
help the homeless and, in the process, tries in vain to absolve his own guilt. 
In the scene being shot, the Pollock character has just given the penniless 
locals an access code that will allow them to withdraw unauthorized cash from 
bank automatic teller machines, and chaos is about to ensue. 
</P>
<P>
No chaos on the set, though. The film crew and the Skid Row folk have been 
getting along on this six-week shoot with minimal problems, though each group 
feels out of its element at certain points in the production. This morning, 
working in a "bad" area on a 7-p.m.-to-7-a.m. shooting schedule, it's the 
crew's turn to get a little nervous. 
</P>
<P>
"I was quaking in my boots earlier, but it's OK," said a female production 
assistant. "This is supposed to be the worst night of the month down here, 
because welfare checks just came out." And more money means more crack, at 
least on this end of the Row, where missions are few and pipes are plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
The smokers are huddling safely away in the dark around the corner, though. And 
the more sober locals gathered to be immortalized in the mob scene seem pleased 
to have been made a part of the film's making and not left as onlookers. That 
inclusion is never a given, even when other movie crews come to the 
neighborhood to use East Skid Row's mean streets as a colorful set. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Neely, the director of the Homeless Outreach Project located on this same 
block, has a beef with Hollywood invading his constituents' turf. 
</P>
<P>
There was a big Hollywood production company that "shot a movie about the 
homeless down here this summer, and guess what they did?" asks Neely. "They 
brought in homeless people from central casting! Like we need more homeless 
people down here. They brought cardboard boxes down. Hey, we've got tons of 
cardboard boxes already. People here said, 'They got people made up to act 
homeless, and I'm already homeless!' Out of a $20-million budget, this 
community got (nothing). That burns me up. If that's not exploiting the 
community, what is? 
</P>
<P>
"That's insensitivity, but this is sensitivity," adds Neely, who has been a 
bridge between the community and the "Jeremiah Pollock" filmmakers. Vegetarian 
meals for the crew and Skid Row extras alike are being served up in the 
Outreach Project's headquarters this morning. "It demonstrates how a production 
company can work with a disadvantaged community and both of them can derive 
some benefit. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't imported anybody -- they're all from right down here, all races, 
all creeds represented. I've been really pleased at the way it worked out, that 
our community had an opportunity to demonstrate we can do something. As you can 
see, this is not an unruly group of people. Just regular people. Nobody came up 
and threatened to hit you on the head." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's not a setting that lacks the potential for problems, and everyone 
is keeping their eyes open as the late-night hours fly by. 
</P>
<P>
"I went down to the doughnut shop to get cigarettes and there were 17 guys 
standing outside smoking crack," says Mary Ann Dolcemascolo, the unit still 
photographer. "And that was before sundown. Imagine what it's gonna be like at 
3 in the morning. I used to hang around down here and shoot four or five years 
ago, but things have gotten worse. Too much drugs. There used to be more 
families." (The dark storefront of Para Los Ninos, a support center for 
homeless parents and children, is a few doors down.) 
</P>
<P>
The last time Dolcemascolo worked in this neighborhood was when the gang-themed 
movie "Colors" shot some scenes nearby. Representatives of that production had 
walked through the area well in advance and solicited the cooperation of the 
locals, "but there's always people who aren't around and don't hear and then 
want to create a problem . . . They were stoning the van." 
</P>
<P>
"So many people that come down here to shoot, they take away," says Southern 
Comfort, a member of the Homeless Writers Coalition who uses the liquor moniker 
as his stage name. "They have actors that walk out of wardrobe all smudged up. 
In my way of thinking, they could at least hire two or three (homeless) guys to 
walk in back, and that would be a way of putting something back. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a low-budget movie, and they're not making lots of money, but they're 
doing something," he says. "And it's taking guys away from doing something that 
could be detrimental to them or land them in jail. There's a lot of creativity 
down here. If you don't have somewhere to exert that, it can turn into a 
negative thing. It's good to be around other artists and not around other 
non-productive things." 
</P>
<P>
The clash of cultures wasn't always a smooth blending on the set. One of the 
three homeless production interns, Rick (he preferred not to give his last 
name), told of one early misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
"They have stereotypes about us, and we have 'em about them. Just by the nature 
of many of us being black while many of them are white, and that many of us 
either live or have lived on Skid Row, when certain funny, strange things 
happen, automatically you tend to think it's some kind of prejudice or 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"There were incidents. They brought some people out that were living right on 
the sidewalk and used them as movie extras. And there's a standard procedure in 
Hollywood, I guess, that the crew members eat first, and the extras really are 
almost like second-class citizens. When we were treated this way, we 
automatically thought it was because we were from Skid Row and they were better 
than us. 
</P>
<P>
"I was getting mad about some of these things. It wasn't intended, but we 
didn't know that that's how Hollywood works, that that's their procedure, that 
these people eat first and we don't. We thought it was some kind of slight to 
us, and it was just a misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think, on their part, they should have possibly more looked into this 
ahead of time. Like, say, if you were making a movie about gang members, and 
you had gang members as extras, and you made them do different things that the 
other people didn't do -- they may get mad and blow up the set, see." 
</P>
<P>
"That's Walt Disney's nephew!" whispers one of the extras to another, pointing 
across 9th Street toward Tim Disney, the film's executive producer. The excited 
extra was off by only a little: Disney is the son of Roy Disney Jr., who was 
the son of Walt's brother Roy. 
</P>
<P>
There's no mistaking "Jeremiah Pollock" for a Touchstone release, however, in 
either theme or budget. Disney did work for Walt Disney Pictures a few years 
back, in the animation department -- he co-wrote the hit "Oliver and Company" 
-- but has moved on to smaller and better things. 
</P>
<P>
The projected budget for "Jeremiah Pollock" is about $350,000, which, Disney 
admits, is about as inexpensively as you can make a full-length feature using 
35-millimeter film stock. (The picture is being shot in black and white.) He 
hopes to give it a good send-off at one of the prestigious film festivals next 
year, to be followed by a run in selected theaters along the lines of, he says, 
previous indie hits like "Stranger Than Paradise" and "Drugstore Cowboy." 
</P>
<P>
Writer-director Eames Demetrios also hails from interesting stock, as the son 
of San Francisco sculptor Aristides Demetrios and grandson of designer Charles 
Eames. After several critically hailed documentaries, including ones focusing 
on the legacies of his father and grandfather, he approached Tim Disney -- an 
old Harvard classmate -- with the idea for a film that would center around 
homelessness from a different perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's going to surprise people," says Disney, "because it's a more 
abstract treatment of the issue than they're expecting. It's not a feel-good 
movie where homeless guy makes good. And it's not a documentary, which is I 
guess the only thing that's been made about the subject except for some TV 
films." 
</P>
<P>
Straightforward it's not. In addition to providing the street people with 
access to unlimited, unauthorized cash from bank machines, the title character 
also decides to go on a secret hunger strike until homelessness is ended -- 
that is, until his death. The film's stylization comes in with this 
semi-hallucinating character's awareness of Los Angeles as a literal urban 
wilderness. It'll be on the surreal side, especially for any viewers led by the 
title to expect a Mitch Snyder-style saint instead of the movie's somewhat 
cracked hero. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's going to be a stretch for some audiences," says Disney, "but 
that's what's gonna save it from being overly didactic. It's a hard subject to 
talk about without being heavy-handed. I think the abstract elements embellish 
or illustrate things without having to put it into words all the time." 
</P>
<P>
And though the hero manages to provide the homeless with cash, most of them 
then use it to buy drugs, with the exception of Jeremiah's chief antagonist, 
Gregor, who buys a vacant lot and starts a farm. The message is that the 
homeless must eventually be "ready to help themselves," equipped with the tools 
of self-reliance. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is not to say that people are bad because they're taking drugs," 
Demetrios explains. "What we're saying is that these problems are so complex 
and deep-seated that you can't solve it just by handing somebody money, if you 
don't offer any (psychological) reconstruction of their lives. The way we 
usually solve big problems in our society is either by throwing money at them 
or by symbolic action, neither of which is adequate. Something better is 
required." 
</P>
<P>
But isn't hiring a few homeless people for this production also a token act, 
not quite as grand as the title character's movie martyrdom, but ultimately 
just as symbolic? 
</P>
<P>
"The way this industry works is, people say 'I'm looking for a production 
assistant,' and we're trying to bring people into that network. That would be 
the real victory. We'll see if that happens. That was our plan, not just to 
offer a quick fix but to get people into a situation where they could get a 
work history, because it's very hard to get a work history if you don't have an 
address. And then give people a leg to stand on after the film, the leg being 
the first and last months' rent so they'll have a base from which to look for 
employment." 
</P>
<P>
And what if, instead, the money is used in real life the same way as in the 
script? 
</P>
<P>
"When we went and shot downtown, and paid the extras money, I'm sure a lot of 
them used that money to buy drugs," says Disney. "But that's not a 
responsibility that we can take on. We can't decide for them how they spend 
their money. Some of those people probably also bought food for their babies." 
</P>
<P>
Florence Hawkins, an artist from the Skid Row area who was hired to paint some 
of the surreal set backdrops, believes she'll go on to other film jobs through 
this introduction to the business. 
</P>
<P>
"When they hired me, it was like a dream come true, because it gives me an 
opportunity not only to get a nice resume going but to go to other companies 
when this project is over," she says. "They intend to give me a letter of 
recommendation. At least I hope so." 
</P>
<P>
Disney admits that, in the midst of encouragement, he's tried not to raise the 
interns' hopes too high about their prospects for continued employment in the 
film business. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to be optimistic but to stress that it's a competitive business," 
Disney says. "That's a serious problem we tried to deal with carefully. But 
we're a film company, so there's only so much we can do. We're not a career 
counseling organization. I wish our organization could exist long enough to 
follow up -- because follow-up is something that's lacking in most homeless 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, I think if all small businesses took on a small program like ours, it 
would make a world of difference. But nobody seems willing to help. Certainly, 
the taxpayers don't." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, if central casting needs any more credible street people the next 
time Hollywood comes calling, there'll be a "Jeremiah Pollock" alumni cast list 
available. A few may be harder than others to reach -- some of the actors list 
street-corner pay phones or shelter or flophouse lobby phones as their home 
numbers on the call-up sheet -- but the savings in superfluous makeup and 
wardrobe personnel for that special stubble look might be worth the extra 
trouble. Cardboard boxes available on request.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: LEGENDARY, BUT STILL ACTIVE, BENNY 
CARTER TO PLAY ELARIO'S

Alto sax man Benny Carter didn't shred jazz traditions to establish new forms 
like Charlie Parker did. Instead, Carter, whose roots are in the days of Big 
Band swing, built a career around his sophisticated composing and arranging 
skills and a subtle sound that emphasizes warm, melodic ideas above all else. 
</P>
<P>
At 83, Carter continues to turn out the polished, swinging improvisations and 
catchy, original songs that have been his trademark since he launched his 
career in Big Bands during the 1920s. In the '30s, he emerged as a leader, and 
has since fronted numerous Big Bands and small groups. 
</P>
<P>
Proof of his enduring finesse is this year's "My Man Benny, My Man Phil," an 
album with fellow alto man Phil Woods. Including six of Carter's own tunes, the 
session captures Carter in fine form, his bright, full sound as strong as ever. 
</P>
<P>
Carter plays Elario's Friday through Sunday in a quartet with Larry Nash on 
piano, Larry Gales on bass and Sherman Ferguson on drums. Show times are 9 and 
10:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
As a crack studio musician, guitarist Tommy Tedesco shows up for work hauling a 
suitcase loaded with string instruments. For example, he's spending the first 
part of this week adding mandolin and guitar to the sound track for the movie, 
"The Godfather Part III." But this Friday and Saturday nights at All That Jazz 
in Rancho Bernardo, Tedesco, the closet be-bopper, will be free to play 
whatever he wants. Sets each night are at 8, 9:15 and 10:30 at the new club 
adjacent to the Wall Street Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
The format will be something Tedesco calls "Confessions of a Studio Player." In 
between songs, he regales audiences with stories of some of the things he has 
seen and done during more than 30 years of studio work. Tedesco will 
concentrate on acoustic and electric guitars, accompanied by local bassist Bob 
Magnusson, but he also plans to hoist a mandolin to show how well it can work 
for jazz. 
</P>
<P>
The material will include several of his own tunes, many of them built around 
Brazilian rhythms. Tedesco has played on hundreds of albums, either under his 
own name or behind musicians as diverse as the Beach Boys, Linda Ronstadt, Ray 
Charles, Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley. His most recent album was last year's 
"Hollywood Gypsy." Tedesco's credits include soundtracks for the television 
programs "MASH," "Ozzie and Harriet," "Gilligan's Island," "My Three Sons" and 
"Charlie's Angels" on television, and for movies including "Bonnie &amp; 
Clyde," "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial" and "The French Connection." 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Cecelia Coleman has been stirring things up in L.A., getting solid 
reviews and winning this year's Shelley Manne Memorial New Talent Award from 
the Los Angeles Jazz Society. Coleman, 28, plays the Horton Grand Hotel 
downtown Saturday night at 8:30. She hasn't recorded an album of her own, but 
she plays on a new one from saxophonist Ben Clatworthy. Schooled by pianists 
Charlie Shoemake and Joanne Grauer, Coleman says her roots are "in be-bop, but 
more of the straight-ahead kind, an Art Blakey kind of thing." She counts 
pianists Red Garland, Bud Powell and Mulgrew Miller as influences. 
</P>
<P>
In search of a recording contract, Coleman plans to record a demo tape of 
original music later this year. She may include a few of her own songs this 
weekend, teaming with locals Gunnar Biggs on bass and Holly Hofmann on flute. 
Incidentally, Hofmann's new album, "Further Adventures," with Mike Wofford, Bob 
Magnusson and Sherman Ferguson, is finally in music stores following an August 
release. Pianist Wofford wrote the title cut. Bassist Magnusson contributed 
"Jillian's Waltz" in honor of his daughter, and other tunes are by Art Pepper, 
Thelonious Monk and Djavan. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Saxman Spike Robinson makes his first appearances at Elario's Wednesday 
and Thursday nights at 8:30 and 10:30. Robinson is back to health after two 
bouts of meningitis last year, which left him with a three-month gap in his 
memory and a slight limp. Based in Denver, Robinson lives several months a year 
in England. A new album is his second with trumpeter Harry (Sweets) Edison. San 
Diego-based guitarist Mundell Lowe returns from a tour of England on Thursday, 
and may show up to jam with Robinson Thursday night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Basia fans who still have tickets for the singer's canceled July show in San 
Diego can exchange them to hear her next Monday night at 8 at the Civic Theatre 
downtown. With music that layers her smooth, sexy vocals over Brazilian 
rhythms, the singer has captured a wide light jazz and pop audience. Her first 
album, the 1988 "Time and Tide," topped Billboard's Contemporary Jazz chart for 
eight weeks and went platinum (1 million sales). "London Warsaw New York," 
released earlier this year, quickly went gold (500,000) and is close to 
platinum, according to a publicist. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Singer Peggy Lee has canceled her Nov. 17 appearance at the Civic Theatre due 
to exhaustion. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by Time magazine's story last month on young players keeping 
traditional jazz alive, San Diego drummer Chuck McPherson is into 
straight-ahead jazz more than ever with his new Modern Jazz Disciples, 
featuring Alan Eicher on piano, Dave Marr on bass and Dale Fielder on sax. The 
group plays Friday nights at 8 through November at Barnett's Grand Cafe at the 
Embassy Suites Hotel downtown. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Friday night at 8:30 at the Horton Grand Hotel downtown, pianist Rick Helzer, 
who teaches jazz at San Diego State University, teams up with flutist Holly 
Hofmann and bassist Gunnar Biggs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Next Wednesday night at 8, Fattburger plays the Cannibal Bar at the Catamaran 
Resort Hotel in Pacific Beach. . . .

Lucas Victory: A Canadian judge has ruled in favor of George Lucas in a lawsuit 
over the film "Return of the Jedi," saying the filmmaker and creator of the 
"Star Wars" trilogy did not infringe upon the copyright of a script by a 
Canadian writer. The ruling, made Friday, comes after five years of litigation 
over the origin of the Ewok characters that appeared in "The Return of the 
Jedi," the third film in the trilogy. Canadian Federal Court Judge W. Andrew 
MacKay ruled against plaintiff Dean Preston, who charged that Lucas had 
appropriated the fuzzy animal-like characters from his script "Space Pets," 
which he submitted to 20th Century Fox in 1978. CLAUDIA PUIG

Garbo's Things Not Alone: For a limited time only, thousands of New Yorkers are 
walking on Greta Garbo's rugs, eyeballing her Renoirs and inspecting items that 
are expected to fetch $20 million when auctioned off this week by Sotheby's. 
Garbo's paintings go on sale today and Wednesday, and her furniture, including 
a Louis XV chair with a rip in its salmon upholstery, is to be sold Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Garbo collection will remain on view at the auction house next to the Henry 
Ford II collection of Impressionist paintings, department store king Jerome 
Ohrbach's collection of Monets and Matisses and paintings that belonged to the 
late violinist Jascha Heifetz. More than 7,000 visitors have viewed the Garbo 
exhibit since its opening Friday. CLAUDIA PUIG

Art Imitating Life: A scene in "Rocky V" between Sylvester Stallone and his 
neophyte-actor son, 14-year-old Sage, may be left on the cutting-room floor 
because it came too close to real life, Stallone told Redbook. 
</P>
<P>
Stallone and his first wife, Sasha, divorced in 1985 and Sage and his brother 
Seargeoh, 11, remained with their mother. In the scene, Rocky tells his son 
"that no matter what, I'll never desert him," Stallone said. "I really lost it 
in that scene. Then Sage started to lose it because he'd never seen his father 
cry. It was all hitting too close to home, and I may take it out of the movie 
because it's just too emotional." CLAUDIA PUIG

Nelson's Goods on the Road: Willie Nelson's real estate holdings, including his 
golf course and recording studio, were padlocked Monday after the Internal 
Revenue Service seized the country singer's properties in six states to satisfy 
$6.5 million in back taxes. The actions were taken less than two months after 
the IRS placed $16.7 million in liens on Nelson's real estate holdings and 
personal property. The order applies to Nelson's property in Texas, Alabama, 
California, Colorado, Hawaii and Washington. CLAUDIA PUIG

'BIG ONE' ON SHAKY GROUND; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THE CONSENSUS OF SCIENTISTS WAS THAT MANY OF THE SPECIFICS AS 
DRAMATIZED IN THE MOVIE WERE 'CREDIBLE' AND 'POSSIBLE' BUT 'NOT PROBABLE.' 
</P>

<P>
In the latest offering of disaster-as-art, the NBC miniseries "The Big One: The 
Great Los Angeles Earthquake" amounted to a beyond-worst-case scenario, 
according to scientists and specialists in earthquake watching. 
</P>
<P>
The consensus of those surveyed by The Times was that many of the specifics of 
earthquake science as dramatized in the movie Sunday and Monday were "credible" 
and "possible" but "not probable." 
</P>
<P>
Earth scientists and emergency-service officials who saw the movie at an NBC 
promotional screening seemed pleased with it, even joyful, on the grounds that 
it might shake people into more fervent preparations for major tremors. The 
plot -- which "starred" shakers of 5.7, 8.0 and 7.2 Richter magnitude -- 
included some instructional details, such as using survival kits and turning 
off gas pipes into the house. 
</P>
<P>
But some were unhappy with the catastrophic depictions, among them Paul Flores, 
executive director of the Southern California Earthquake Preparedness Project, 
a state-sponsored information clearinghouse. He said, with harsh 
understatement, that "The Big One" was "counterproductive." 
</P>
<P>
"I've been at this nine years," he stated angrily, "and you work so hard to get 
over this notion of apathy or futility -- and this is what this movie is 
showing." If anyone thought a magnitude-8 earthquake was likely here, there 
wouldn't be any point in trying to meet earthquake-resistant building 
standards, Flores maintained. 
</P>
<P>
He said the movie had many misrepresentations. For one thing, he insisted that 
buildings would not all topple as the program suggested, "especially 
steel-framed high-rise buildings." 
</P>
<P>
And geology professor Kerry Sieh of the California Institute of Technology, a 
pioneer in the attempts to predict earthquakes, complained that the miniseries 
had its Big One running five minutes long: "It would be more likely a minute 
long. And they had so many aftershocks. That was pushing it." Emphasized Asst. 
Fire Chief Frank Borden, who runs the Disaster Preparedness Division that is 
probably the largest of its kind in the country, "Yes, we're going to have a 
major earthquake, and, yes, people do need to prepare because earthquakes are 
survivable. That's the key issue. The first part of the movie was 
semi-educational. (But) one of the problems at the end is that it went on 
killing people." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Heaton, scientist in charge of the U.S. Geological Survey field office in 
Pasadena, noted that viewers got a mixed signal from the movie -- that they 
were left with an impression that one out of four people were killed, "which 
would mean millions dead; then they came on and said it's hundreds of 
thousands." 
</P>
<P>
The experts also said that NBC's drama was "at the extreme" in its depiction of 
predicting earthquakes. To a quiet but ominous undertone of music, the movie 
showed miniquakes at Bombay Beach, dropping oil field pressures in Baldwin 
Hills, rising radon readings, a methane gas explosion in the Fairfax district, 
gurgling in the La Brea tar pits and satellite laser measurements showing 
slight movement of Mt. Wilson toward Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, if all those things actually happened," Heaton speculated, "we still 
wouldn't have the theory to tie them all together. But if all those things did 
come in -- which, by the way, wouldn't happen because we don't have the funds 
to do it -- there'd be a lot of sweating." 
</P>
<P>
But California does have a very precise quake response plan, as opposed to the 
movie images about battles over what and when to tell the public. In fact, the 
state has issued five quake advisories in the last six years based on data from 
the U.S. Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time we did it was the Upland earthquake," said Lucile Jones of the 
survey staff, who specializes in foreshocks as clues to predicting 
probabilities and was a key source for the screenwriters, providing much of 
their model for the character of Claire Townsend (played by Joanna Kearns). "It 
was having so many aftershocks that we did this advisory that they could get 
larger than the first one. In fact, we had three earthquakes of 4.7 or 4.8 and 
the main shock was only 5.2. So in that sense we were right. 
</P>
<P>
"We managed to get that statement out (to emergency management organizations) 
and issued to the press within an hour and a half, and along with it was 
information and suggestions for appropriate responses on the part of the public 
and local government." 
</P>
<P>
The problem, Heaton said, is that most members of the public are reluctant to 
act on such predictions because of the very long odds involved: "Probabilities 
today are one in 10 or one in 20. Those are numbers that are high enough to 
concern us but low enough that it still means that it (an advisory) could mean 
a false alarm. Some people would say, 'Big deal.' " 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. George Morrison, chief of staff to Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates 
and an architect of the city's Earthquake Prediction Response Plan, said that 
people want two-to-one odds that the next quake is in, say, 47 minutes: "But we 
aren't close to that. We can say, 'Yes, there's enough activity that we can 
expect an earthquake in the range of 3.5 to 5.8 within the next three weeks. 
And people say, 'Ho hum, I'm going to roll over and go back to sleep.' " 
</P>
<P>
Heaton found "The Big One" fraught with irony. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody told me the budget was $10 million (sources told The Times it was 
$9.5 million), and that's 10 times the budget of our office. And it struck me 
that this is so indicative of Southern California society, that they're willing 
to spend 10 times the money in a fictionalization of something than on the real 
situation. The perfect example of Southern California denial."

RICK DU BROW: NO SHOCK: 'BIG ONE' DOES WELL IN L.A.

</P>
<P>
BOX SCORE: That NBC miniseries about the major earthquake predicted for Los 
Angeles naturally got a heavy tune-in here in its opening segment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"The Big One: The Great Los Angeles Earthquake" averaged 29% of the local TV 
audience -- with the figure actually soaring above 30% as the first half of the 
two-parter ended. 
</P>
<P>
And NBC's version of the quake, with all its horror, was yet to come Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Big-city viewers around the nation, however, showed hardly more interest in 
L.A.'s nightmare than in two competing broadcasts Sunday -- CBS' Michael 
Douglas-Glenn Close film, "Fatal Attraction," and ABC's "Call Me Anna," in 
which Patty Duke starred in a story of her life. 
</P>
<P>
Overnight averages for the major markets gave "The Big One" a 16.3 rating, 
"Call Me Anna" a 16.2 and "Fatal Attraction" a 15.8, with each of the programs 
winning 24% of the audience, according to NBC figures. 
</P>
<P>
National ratings, yet to come, sometimes vary. 
</P>
<P>
ABC actually gave competitor NBC a slightly bigger audience for its earthquake 
opener. But NBC said its figures may be weighted differently to allow for such 
factors as preemptions and market size. "The Big One" was preempted by NBC's 
Dallas station for the Dallas-San Francisco NFL football game. 
</P>
<P>
The second part of "The Big One" was scheduled for showing in Dallas Monday, 
with a brief opening recap of the first half that viewers missed. 
</P>
<P>
While Sunday's competition was the biggest showdown of the November ratings 
sweeps, interest was also high Saturday as ABC's "Twin Peaks" finally -- 
apparently -- resolved the murder of Laura Palmer. The episode averaged a solid 
22% audience share in Los Angeles and 19% in big cities overall. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Big Three networks pulled out the stops promoting their Sunday 
specials, none came close to last week's one-hour NBC program celebrating the 
200th episode of "Cheers." National ratings show it earned a 29.5 rating with a 
stupendous 44% share of viewers. 
</P>
<P>
SILVER LINING: Considering TV's shameful lack of black family life in weekly 
drama series, it's good to see NBC's police show "In the Heat of the Night" 
make some progress with the married couple played by Howard Rollins and 
Anne-Marie Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Even competitor Roseanne Barr says she likes "In the Heat of the Night" -- 
although it goes head-to-head weekly against her Tuesday "Roseanne" series on 
ABC. She's a big fan of "Heat" co-star Carroll O'Connor from his days on "All 
in the Family." 
</P>
<P>
NAILED: Hurrah for the viewer who sent a blistering letter to his cable 
company, saying: "Charging subscribers for a program guide is equivalent to a 
restaurant charging its patrons a stiff fee for a look at its menu." 
</P>
<P>
RETREAT: "Personalities," the syndicated news magazine shown on KTTV Channel 
11, is hurting. First, host Charlie Rose quit. Now the series -- pummeled by 
such 7 p.m. competition as "Entertainment Tonight," "Wheel of Fortune" and 
"Cosby Show" reruns -- has been yanked and rescheduled, starting this week, at 
11:30 p.m. daily (12:30 a.m. Friday nights). It's replacement at 7 p.m. on 
KTTV? Good old standby "MASH." 
</P>
<P>
TREAT: TV viewing may be low on Thanksgiving Day, but KCOP Channel 13 figures 
it has the perfect solution -- the Oscar-winning film "The Last Emperor," which 
will air uncut at 7 p.m. The female lead is Joan Chen, now of ABC's "Twin 
Peaks." 
</P>
<P>
COUCH POTATO SPECIAL: Should be a cornucopia of show business history when Carl 
Reiner visits NBC's "Later With Bob Costas" for a two-part interview Wednesday 
and Thursday nights following the David Letterman show. Worth taping, for sure. 
</P>
<P>
GRAND SLAM: On the Costas show last week, Chris Evert said Martina Navratilova 
was coached into developing a killer instinct against her that made all the 
difference in their rivalry. "Unfortunately, it worked," said Evert. "It was 
bad for our relationship, but she started beating me." 
</P>
<P>
ALL SHOOK UP: NBC's outrageously exploitative promotion for "The Big One: The 
Great Los Angeles Earthquake" reached some kind of nadir with a press release 
that was headlined: "Small Quake Felt in Southern California Four Days Before 
'The Big One.' " This was just one of a series of promotional dispatches from a 
network that suddenly developed this great sense of public responsibility about 
earthquakes just in time for the November sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
DRAWING BOARD: ABC apparently would like a stronger series than "Head of the 
Class" between its high-powered Tuesday tandem of "Who's the Boss?" and 
"Roseanne." And the producers of "Head of the Class," worried that this could 
mean the ax even though the show's done well, have sent out letters asking for 
press support. An ABC spokesman says no decision has been made on "Class" and 
that "it wouldn't necessarily be off -- it could be moved." 
</P>
<P>
VISITORS: Jack Benny's daughter, writer Joan Benny, drops in on the Johnny 
Carson show Friday. And Dennis Hopper hosts this week's "Saturday Night Live," 
with Paul Simon as a guest. 
</P>
<P>
MOODY BLUES: If the show's as good as the script, "Midnight Caller" will have 
something special Friday when Robert Klein guest-stars as a once-famous, 
now-troubled, radical radio disc jockey of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>

'NOVA' UNCOVERS THE DOUBTS ABOUT U.S. 'SMART' WEAPONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

With the Bush Administration's new strategy of doubling U.S. military forces in 
the Persian Gulf in order to display an offensive stance toward Iraq, fresh 
attention is being focused on the heart of U.S. military might: The high-tech, 
"smart" weapons that were so much a part of the expensive military build-up 
during the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Many Pentagon strategists consider this computerized arsenal the 
ace-in-the-hole against a less-developed power like Iraq, but as the ultimate 
test for these weapons may be fast approaching, doubts are emerging about them 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
The KCET/Nova co-production, "Killing Machines," (tonight at 8 on Channels 28 
and 15 and at 9 on Channel 50) raises the most sobering questions yet. 
</P>
<P>
During the height of the Cold War, tank-heavy Warsaw Pact armies compelled 
outmanned American-led NATO forces to digitize the battlefield, ushering in 
high-precision missiles, planes and tanks. Quality over quantity, as the 
military mantra went. 
</P>
<P>
But as with every technological development in weaponry (the report shows 
author Tom Clancy comparing the new machines to the repeater rifle of the 19th 
Century), arms trade expands, and your customer today may be your enemy 
tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is this more stark than with Iraq, although "Machines" fails to track 
how Western Europe and the United States helped feed Saddam Hussein's own 
machine. It does, though, show how a Third World guerrilla force in 
Afghanistan, using a basic smart weapon like the Stinger anti-aircraft gun, 
blew the Soviet superpower out of the sky. Smarter, cheaper, more compact 
weapons have democratized military power: A superpower may no longer be so 
super. 
</P>
<P>
Producer Mitchell Koss strives for balance, but somehow the several critics of 
smart weapons -- including Adm. Eugene Carroll and defense consultant Donald 
Mayes -- come through louder, for several reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The weapons remain untested in a real war and may not work. Mock U.S.-Iraq 
battles staged in the Mojave Desert have Iraq winning. Footage shot on-board 
the high-tech U.S.S. Vincennes when it accidentally shot down an Iranian 
passenger plane dramatize the danger of looking at an enemy on a radar screen 
rather than with your own eyes. The human factor behind the machine may be our 
own worst enemy.

Changes in Plastics Ban: Minneapolis, which caused a tremor in the plastics 
industry when it decided to prohibit some plastic packaging for consumer goods, 
announced that it would launch a broad-based recycling effort that would allow 
continued use of some plastics. 
</P>
<P>
The ban will still go into effect Jan. 1. But the recycling effort will, in 
practice, keep on store shelves much plastic packaging originally targeted by 
environmentalists. The new recycling effort comes after a six-month 
demonstration program by a Washington-based industry group, the Council for 
Solid Waste Solutions.

Two Commodity Dealers Banned: Two former commodity futures salesmen at the 
Chicago Mercantile Exchange were each fined $150,000 and permanently barred 
from the exchange for fraud, the CME said. Norman Furlett and Ira Greenspon 
were accused of a scheme to divert customers' profits into their own accounts. 
They had worked at GNP Commodities Inc. The CME said the two have repaid 
customers an unspecified amount.

Saturn May Add More Models: General Motors Corp.'s highly touted subsidiary 
will expand from three to 10 models by 1994, an automotive journal reported. 
</P>
<P>
Automotive News said Saturn also may increase its plant capacity. The Spring 
Hill, Tenn., company will add a luxury sedan and coupe, a coupe convertible, 
two station wagons and two two-door hatchbacks in the next three years, the 
News said. The cars appear to be selling well. In fact, some dealers say they 
have a backlog of orders.

SETTLEMENT REACHED IN VIDEO PIRACY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hollywood studios, which maintain that the industry loses more than a 
billion dollars a year worldwide to video piracy, have driven one top 
manufacturer of video descrambling devices out of business. 
</P>
<P>
VSA Ltd., an Oregon company, has agreed to halt production of its "movie 
stabilizer," which is capable of defeating the anti-copy code used on 
prerecorded tapes. In an out-of-court settlement, the company will also pay 
$2.5 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the plaintiffs expect a U.S. District Court judge to approve the 
agreement soon. Universal City Studios Inc. brought the case against VSA, but 
the entire motion picture industry is actively behind efforts to drive such 
companies out of business. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Morgan, a senior vice president at Universal, said VSA is the largest 
nationwide distributor of stabilizing devices, which are capable of defeating 
the electronic picture scrambler used on videocassettes of most major movies as 
a way to discourage illegal copying. 
</P>
<P>
VSA had held that the device simply improves picture quality on many rental 
films. But Universal said VSA's so-called black boxes had slipped into the 
hands of thousands of professional video pirates who used the boxes to make 
illegal copies of films that were later sold or rented to the general public. 
</P>
<P>
"They sent out tens of thousands of these devices," Morgan said. "And they sold 
them to retailers almost exclusively. There were mom-and-pop operations all 
around the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement prohibits VSA and its subsidiaries from selling or promoting any 
device that is capable of defeating the copyguard placed on prerecorded 
cassettes by Macrovision, the company whose copyright-protection process is 
used by most major film studios. VSA is also barred from producing any future 
device that removes the anti-copying protection on prerecorded tapes. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for VSA could not be reached for comment Monday. In an earlier 
interview, attorney Gerri Sue Lant said VSA was the innocent victim of a 
malicious and unfounded lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The motion picture industry, however, insists that piracy is among its biggest 
problems. Mark Harrad, a spokesman for the Motion Picture Assn. of America, 
said there are hundreds of lawsuits pending against people suspected of 
contributing to the piracy problem. Piracy is particularly common in foreign 
countries such as Thailand, where copyright laws are relatively lax. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan called the VSA case an important victory but added that Hollywood is 
still fighting a losing battle. He said 10% of all videotapes available in 
retail stores are pirated. Morgan also said industry investigators are on the 
trail of a Los Angeles woman who is reportedly selling thousands of illegal 
tapes to retailers out of the trunk of her car. 
</P>
<P>
"This (lawsuit) is just one of many things we have to do out of due diligence," 
Morgan said. "The VSA case is not a major breakthrough. What we're really doing 
is running around sticking our fingers in a whole lot of dikes."

PC ACCESSORY FIRM SETTLES ITS MICROSOFT SUIT 
</P>

<P>
Z-Nix Co., the small Pomona personal computer accessory maker that last week 
sued PC software giant Microsoft for restraint of trade and breach of contract, 
said Monday that the two companies have resolved the dispute that led to the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the settlement, Microsoft has agreed to issue a license to Z-Nix 
to use Microsoft's popular Windows software through the end of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The two companies said they would negotiate a renewal when the first license 
expires. Both companies said they were pleased by the terms of the settlement, 
but neither would reveal its details. 
</P>
<P>
Z-Nix, which makes computer point-and-click devices known as mice, sued 
Microsoft last Wednesday for at least $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleged that Microsoft, after agreeing to license Windows software to 
Z-Nix for $27.50 per copy, sought to double that fee when the Pomona company 
wanted to pair the software with its own product, a mouse device used to point 
to material on personal computer screens. Z-Nix alleged that Microsoft's fee 
hike was designed to price Z-Nix out of the market and protect its own brand of 
competing PC mouse devices. Z-Nix representatives labeled Microsoft's actions 
"unfair business practices" and said the $1-billion-a-year company was stifling 
innovation in the PC industry. 
</P>
<P>
But Monday after resolving the dispute, Z-Nix said it would withdraw its suit 
and the allegations about Microsoft's business conduct it made when publicizing 
the suit.

S&amp;LS SAY REGULATORS MAY BE HURTING RECOVERY; 
</P>

THRIFTS: INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES SAY OVERLY HARSH AGENCY REVIEWS ARE SCARING OFF 
INVESTORS. IF IT KEEPS UP, THEY ADD, SOME FIRMS THAT COULD SURVIVE MAY NOT.

<P>
Savings and loan executives meeting here Monday said federal regulators' zeal 
in trying to protect taxpayers is producing inconsistent, overly harsh reviews 
of thrifts that are scaring off investment dollars needed for survival. 
</P>
<P>
In a theme heard repeatedly at the annual U.S. League of Savings Institutions 
convention, thrift executives complained that regulators are pressuring them to 
bolster the financial cushions that protect against losses. At the same time, 
they said, regulators are scaring off investors through tough examinations that 
force thrifts to set aside large amounts of money to cover potential losses on 
loans. Regulators also are pressuring them to cut or eliminate dividends, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, they maintained, investors are shunning thrifts. The uncertainty 
caused by the government's actions, they contended, could result in the failure 
of some savings and loans that otherwise might survive. 
</P>
<P>
"Government must not smother us with its attention. Government must give us 
room to breathe . . . to catch our breath before the next hurdle," said Kenneth 
D. Seaton, chairman of the trade group. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators from the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp. have been marching through the S&amp;L industry, putting 
thrifts through tough examinations in an effort to contain the tab that 
taxpayers will pay for failed S&amp;Ls. That tab already has grown to an 
estimated $600 billion over 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
The agencies are forcing S&amp;Ls to recognize more real estate loans as 
problems and leaning on them to set aside large amounts of money for 
unspecified losses that may occur in the future. Stocks of thrifts have 
plunged, which investors say is partly due to the uncertainty caused by the 
reviews. 
</P>
<P>
In California, thrifts such as Coast Savings Financial in Los Angeles and First 
Nationwide Financial in San Francisco have posted large losses after their 
regulatory examinations. Some analysts believe that nearly all major S&amp;Ls 
in the state will have to post losses when regulators get around to reviewing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest complaints heard Monday is that the OTS and FDIC have widely 
different views about the health of real estate loans, with the FDIC generally 
acknowledged as taking a tougher tack. In addition, executives complained that 
they are being forced to set aside too much money for unspecified possible 
future problems on loans that may or may not occur. 
</P>
<P>
Two top regulators, OTS Director Timothy Ryan and Michael Patriarca, who heads 
the OTS' San Francisco office, acknowledged that examinations have been 
inconsistent. In a sharply worded comment, Patriarca told one panel that 
thrifts are getting confusing messages from OTS and FDIC examiners. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's embarrassing that the government hasn't gotten its act together 
better than it has and is speaking with multiple voices," Patriarca said. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said he recognizes that the examination process is subjective. He said he 
hopes one of his actions -- consolidating the OTS' 12 district offices into 
five regional offices -- will make examinations more consistent. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan offered no other specifics. He also said he did not know how to send 
investors a clearer signal of what to expect for thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have the $64,000 answer. I just know it's a problem, and it's one we 
are struggling with," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert E. Lackovic, chief executive of First Nationwide Bank in San Francisco, 
said regulators examined the San Francisco thrift much more thoroughly than in 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't get a lot of credit for past history. It doesn't make a difference 
how you've done in the past," he said.

BILL GATES PAINTS A PERFECT WORLD

<P>
When Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates talks, the personal computer industry 
listens -- even if the message is a little bit vague. That was certainly the 
case Monday, at least, as Gates gave the keynote address at the huge Comdex 
trade show here to an overflow crowd of computer dealers, equipment vendors and 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
The vision he presented was certainly an appealing one -- a computing world 
where a standard desktop machine will give access to a broad range of text, 
voice and video information at the simple touch of a mouse. The barriers 
between different software programs -- word processing and spreadsheets, for 
example -- would disappear, allowing people to move seamlessly from one type of 
computer application to another. 
</P>
<P>
Thus it would be possible to search a central database for, say, a chart that 
someone else at the company had created, attach that to an electronic mail 
message, stick a video picture into that same message, make a few voice 
annotations, and then send it off -- all with just a few clicks of the mouse. 
</P>
<P>
Gates calls his concept "Information at Your Fingertips" and considers it the 
key to dramatically expanding the base of personal computer customers at a time 
when PC industry growth has all but stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Gates, however, specifically avoided discussing what products might make his 
concept a reality. 
</P>
<P>
However Gates' vision is ultimately implemented, Microsoft is well positioned 
to maintain its monopoly on the software that controls the basic functions of a 
personal computer. It's certainly more secure than the other big PC monopoly: 
Intel Corp.'s chokehold on the supply of the microprocessors that provide the 
basic brains of a PC. 
</P>
<P>
Advanced Micro Devices on Monday gave the first public demonstration of its 
long-awaited "clone" of Intel's hot-selling 386 microprocessor. The AMD chip -- 
called the AM386 since last Friday, when a court denied an Intel request to bar 
AMD from using that name -- was shown running on off-the-shelf computers from 
Compaq Computer and International Business Machines. Mike Webb, head of 
marketing for the product, said AMD's own tests and those of the 20 PC makers 
who have samples showed it to be completely compatible with Intel's version. 
</P>
<P>
By all appearances, AMD is ready to begin selling its three versions of the 
386, including a low-power model aimed at portable PCs. But Intel has been 
fighting tooth and nail in the courts, and AMD's efforts could still be at 
least partially thwarted by several pending lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Though AMD officials deny it, the continuing shadow of the Intel lawsuits might 
explain why the company won't discuss when the product will be released, or how 
much it will cost. 
</P>
<P>
What are customers supposed to do with old equipment when they invest in fancy 
new stuff? The unceremonious answer has long been "throw it away." 
</P>
<P>
But Alex Randall, co-founder of the Boston Computer Exchange, has been bucking 
this reality for a while. He announced at Comdex what is believed to be the 
first national dealer program for used PC trade-ins. About 275 Valcom computer 
stores nationwide will now accept trade-ins from customers buying new machines, 
with prices based on the Boston Computer Exchanges' widely used valuations. 
</P>
<P>
An IBM AT that might have cost $2,000 new in 1988 is now worth $650 on a 
trade-in, for example. The Boston Computer Exchange then sells the machines, 
many in overseas markets such as Eastern Europe that are technology-hungry but 
cash-poor. A lot of computer dealers don't like the trade-in concept -- lots of 
trouble, not much profit -- but Randall says more dealers will be signing on 
soon.

GOOD SIGNS ON OIL, GULF PUSH DOW UP 51.74 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The stock market took a giant step forward on Monday, as investors reacted to 
the possibility of lower interest rates, falling oil prices and an easing of 
tensions in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index jumped 51.74 points, or 2.1%, to close at 
2,540.35, while broader measures of market strength also showed strong gains. 
In all, U.S. investors earned roughly $52.6 billion in paper profits on Monday, 
according to Wilshire Associates, a Los Angeles investment house that measures 
the value of U.S. common stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's gain followed a 44.80-point Dow rise Friday. However, analysts remain 
divided on the market's future. Some believe that the strong gains of the past 
two sessions signal the end of the slide that started last August. Others say 
this is just a good day in an otherwise bad market. And some believe that it is 
just too soon to tell. 
</P>
<P>
Although investors are expressing more optimism about a wide variety of 
economic and political prospects, the main reason for stocks' strong showing 
was the widespread belief that the Federal Reserve will move to lower interest 
rates this week, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
The reason: Recently released producer price figures indicated a slowing 
economy at a time when oil prices seem to be stabilizing. The price of crude 
oil for December delivery fell $2.02 a barrel Monday to close at $31.87 on the 
New York Mercantile Exchange. This combination has reduced near-term inflation 
worries and may help spur the Federal Reserve to ease credit quickly and 
decisively. 
</P>
<P>
Investors believe that lower interest rates would prove beneficial for both the 
economy and corporate earnings, market experts said. 
</P>
<P>
"The lowering of interest rates makes investors think that if we do have a 
recession, it won't be a particularly bad one," Johnson added. If the Fed does 
lower rates soon, some expect the market to continue climbing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this could be the beginning of a significant turnaround in the 
market," said Eugene E. Peroni Jr., director of technical research at Janney 
Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is historically more concerned with economic factors than political 
and military ones. Now the focus is more on interest rates and what they can do 
for the economy and for future earnings." 
</P>
<P>
The bond market was closed Monday in observance of Veteran's Day. 
</P>
<P>
Among market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Financial stocks led the market because of the expectations of lower rates 
and the perception that the issues have fallen to bargain levels. Some of the 
biggest gainers included First Interstate, which jumped 1 1/8 to 20; Wells 
Fargo, up 2 3/8 to 51 3/4; BankAmerica, up 1 1/2 to 23 3/4, and Citicorp, up 1 
to 13 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Among S&amp;Ls, Great Western soared 1 1/8 to 11 1/4, CalFed jumped 1/2 to 3 
3/4, and Ahmanson rose 1 to 14 1/4. The two strongest percentage-gainers in the 
Dow index were financial stocks as well: American Express, up 2 to 21 5/8, and 
Primerica, up 1 1/4 to 20 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
* Technology stocks, often viewed as a proxy for the broad economy, also were 
strong. Microsoft jumped 4 1/8 to 68 7/8, AST Research rose 2 to 26, IBM gained 
2 3/4 to 113, Compaq rose 2 1/4 to 51 3/8 and Advanced Logic gained 3/4 to 8. 
</P>
<P>
* Airline stocks rebounded from their recent sharp slump. AMR, parent of 
American Airlines, soared 1 7/8 to 48 1/8, Delta rose 2 to 57 3/8 and USAir 
rocketed 1 3/8 to 15. 
</P>
<P>
* Among other blue-chip stocks, Eastman Kodak was up 3/4 to 41 1/2, General 
Electric rose 1 5/8 to 55 3/8, and Merck closed at 82 3/8, up 1 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, gaining issues outpaced decliners by about a 3-to-1 margin, with 
161.39 million shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, compared 
to 145.16 million on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Stock Exchange composite index climbed 2.90 to 174.07, or 1.7%. 
The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 3.75 to 294.78, or 1.3%, 
and the NASDAQ over-the-counter composite jumped 9.51 to 351.46, a 2.8% rise. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices also climbed in foreign markets. In Frankfurt, the DAX 30-share 
index rose 20.75 to 1,402.24. And in London, the Financial Times index gained 
11.3, closing at 2,051.9. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo market was closed Monday for Emperor Akihito's enthronement. In 
today's trading, prices were up sharply at midday, with the Nikkei 225-share 
average gaining 773.04 points to 23,704.84. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Hope for Rate Drop Depresses the Dollar 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell broadly in sleepy trading on world currency markets Monday, 
largely in anticipation that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Trading was extremely light, with many bank trading floors closed for Veterans 
Day. Lack of news indicating increased volatility in the Middle East kept 
investors focused on what the Fed might do after Tuesday's meeting of its 
policy committee. 
</P>
<P>
Also driving down the dollar's value against foreign currencies was a slide in 
oil futures services. 
</P>
<P>
Traders were discouraged by a $2.02 drop in the December contract for light, 
sweet crude to $31.87 per barrel. 
</P>
<P>
The oil drop added strength to the Japanese yen because traders read it as a 
favorable sign for Japan's oil-dependent economy. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell against the yen in New York, closing at 128.30 yen, down from 
Friday's 129.70. In overnight trading in Tokyo, the dollar traded at 130.50 
yen, unchanged from Friday's close, and in London, it fell to 128.80 yen. 
</P>
<P>
The British pound also strengthened to $1.9660 from $1.9655 late Friday. In 
earlier London trading, the British pound traded at $1.9627, compared to 
$1.9670 late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
War Worries Abate; Metals, Oil Decline 
</P>
<P>
Prices of gold and silver futures, following the lead of oil futures, declined 
Monday on a day of light trading highlighted by a consensus that war in the 
Persian Gulf is not imminent. On other commodities markets, soybean futures 
rose and grains fell. 
</P>
<P>
Gold settled on New York's Commodity Exchange $4.10 to $2.50 lower, with 
November at $382.30 an ounce; silver settled 4.4 to 3.1 cents lower, with 
November at $4.19 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell after Democratic 
lawmakers remained adamant that President Bush must get the support of Congress 
before attacking Iraq or seeking to liberate Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Light sweet crude settled $2.02 to 17 cents lower, with December at $31.87 a 
barrel; heating oil settled 3.83 to 1.83 cents lower, with December at 86.52 
cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline settled 4.70 to 3 cents lower, with December 
at 83.53 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Soybean futures prices rallied from sharp weekend losses on the Chicago Board 
of Trade as commercial buyers began to cash in on the oversold product. 
</P>
<P>
Soybean futures prices slipped to an 8 1/2-month low on Friday, after an 
Agriculture Department report that indicated a larger than expected supply of 
soybeans.

SEVERAL FIRMS TO BOOST THEIR SPENDING IN 1991 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Several major oil company executives said Monday that they will boost 1991 
spending, a move that is in keeping with recent industry trends and is not 
influenced by the Middle East crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The executives, in interviews at the annual meeting of the American Petroleum 
Institute, said they are basing their plans for modest increases in spending 
next year on expectations that oil prices will stabilize in the low 
$20s-per-barrel range once the crisis is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Such prices would be higher than before Iraq invaded Kuwait, but lower than 
they are now. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, crude oil for December delivery closed down $2.02 a barrel at $31.87 
in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Although increased oil revenues have prompted some companies -- including 
Unocal Corp. and Chevron Corp. -- to speed up drilling plans, executives said 
their long-range strategies remained unaffected by the crisis, which has driven 
prices as high as $40 in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a long-term business, and you don't turn the money on because the oil 
price spikes," said Lawrence G. Rawl, chairman of Exxon Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Although spending plans vary from company to company, many of the executives 
said they would boost spending on exploration and production of oil, 
particularly overseas. In refining and marketing, there is a complicating 
factor as oil companies prepare their 1991 budgets: the unknown costs of 
retrofitting refineries to meet requirements of the proposed federal clean air 
act. 
</P>
<P>
Rawl said Exxon, the nation's largest oil company, would probably spend a 
little more than the $8.3 billion it expects to spend in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon plans few changes in its current allocations, with about 20% to 25% of 
the budget going to refining and marketing, 10% to chemicals and the rest to 
exploration and production. About 65% of Exxon's exploration and production 
budget is spent overseas, the rest in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
As for the effects that the clean air act might have on spending, he said Exxon 
had not placed a figure on it -- "but it's going to cost a lot." 
</P>
<P>
No. 2 Mobil Corp. will spend more than $6 billion in 1990, considerably higher 
than before, said Chairman Allen E. Murray, who also is API's board chairman. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a very aggressive budget that we adopted for the year 1990, one of the 
highest we've ever had, because we think things look good for the oil industry, 
and the basics seem to be coming back into line," Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
But for next year, he added, "if you're asking me if I'm suddenly going to set 
our exploration people loose assuming (that the price of oil is $40 a barrel), 
the answer is we are not." 
</P>
<P>
Texaco Inc. plans to spend about $3.1 billion in 1991, an increase over 1990's 
estimated $2.9 billion and 1989's $2.3 billion, said James W. Kinnear, 
president and chief executive. About two-thirds of that will go to exploration 
and production, he said. Texaco will spend another $600 million through 
affiliated companies, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron Corp.'s 1990 capital spending will come in at $4 billion. Next year, 
"it will be up a not-insignificant amount," said Chairman Kenneth T. Derr. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the exploration and production money will go overseas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He estimated that the company also must spend more than $500 million in the 
next five years just to meet initial requirements of the clean air act, though 
he declined to guess total costs. 
</P>
<P>
British Petroleum will increase capital expenditures "something more than 
inflation" from current levels of about $6.5 billion worldwide, said James 
Ross, president of subsidiary BP America Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Ross expects spending in the United States, which is more than $2 billion a 
year, to go up slightly next year. 
</P>
<P>
At Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co., "we're going to be drilling more 
wells next year, so our spending will be up some," said Chairman Lodwrick M. 
Cook. 
</P>
<P>
He estimated that spending would increase to around $3.5 billion, with 
expenditures heavily weighted to Arco's U.S. operations in Alaska and the lower 
48 states. 
</P>
<P>
Unocal Corp. will boost capital spending more than $1.1 billion above 1990's, 
said Chairman Richard J. Stegemeier, who noted: "We have chosen to accelerate 
our drilling program this year . . . that would have been in next year's 
budget."

TRIMEDYNE'S LASER TO UNCLOG ARTERIES APPROVED BY FDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trimedyne Inc., a Tustin medical laser catheter manufacturer struggling to 
revive flagging sales, said Monday that it has received Food and Drug 
Administration approval to market the first "cold laser" for opening blocked 
leg arteries. 
</P>
<P>
Trimedyne in 1987 was the first company to win the FDA's approval to market a 
laser-powered "hot-tip" catheter to sear through fatty plaque in leg arteries. 
The hot laser uses laser energy to heat the metal tip of a catheter, which is 
then threaded through arteries to vaporize blockages. 
</P>
<P>
But hot laser sales fell off when the medical community expressed preference 
for an alternative technology, the cold laser, which uses a free beam of 
laser-produced light, administered in short bursts, to remove plaque without 
producing significant heat. Doctors prefer it because they want to eliminate 
the possibility of thermal damage to healthy tissues. 
</P>
<P>
Although Trimedyne's hot laser has shown success in opening clogged leg 
arteries, the FDA has not approved it for use in the heart. The market for 
using lasers to unblock clogged heart arteries is estimated by Trimedyne to be 
worth up to $800 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Trimedyne began developing a cold laser about two years ago. The Trimedyne 
Omni-Pulse laser approved by the FDA is powered by a holmium crystal that 
generates short bursts of ultraviolet light to vaporize plaque, said Richard 
Demmer, Trimedyne's executive vice president, who added, "The medical world has 
said the cold laser is the way to go, and now we have met the challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Demmer said it is too soon to tell if the cold laser will prove superior to the 
company's hot laser in treating blood vessel blockages in the legs. 
</P>
<P>
Trimedyne's main objective, he said, is to get the cold laser approved for 
cardiac use, although he acknowledges that the process will probably take two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Another Southern California firm, Advanced Interventional Systems of Irvine, is 
expected to become the first U.S. company to get federal approval to market a 
cold laser to treat blocked coronary arteries. 
</P>
<P>
A FDA medical panel recently approved the AIS device as an alternative to 
bypass surgery in certain cases when balloon angioplasty -- forcing an opening 
with pressure -- is ineffective in clearing a patient's heart arteries. 
</P>
<P>
Trimedyne lost $6.2 million on revenue of $10.2 million for the first nine 
months of its fiscal 1990 year, contrasted with earnings of $929,000 on revenue 
of $26.6 million for the year-earlier period.

North Korea and Japan are to hold a second round of preliminary talks Saturday 
aimed at ultimately establishing diplomatic relations between them. 
</P>
<P>
The discussions, which occur against a backdrop of political change throughout 
Northeast Asia, will take place in the Chinese capital, where both countries 
have embassies. An earlier round of talks in Beijing had left unsettled key 
questions of where, when and at what level formal talks on diplomatic ties 
should begin. 
</P>
<P>
Among other outstanding issues: North Korea's demand that Japan pay 
compensation both for the period of its colonial rule in 1910-45 and for its 
postwar "political hostility." Tokyo is balking at any compensation related to 
the postwar period.

 LEADERS OF 34 NATIONS WILL MEET IN PARIS NEXT WEEK. TIMES CORRESPONDENTS IN 
KEY CAPITALS REPORT ON THEIR HOPES AND FEARS FOR THE CONTINENT.

<TEXT>
<P>
When the leaders of the 34 nations of the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) convene next Monday around a pale, oval-shaped 
table in Kleber Center in Paris, it will mark the official end of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
The summit meeting will also signal the start of the construction of a New 
Europe -- with the heads of government playing a role not unlike their 
predecessors at the 1815 Congress of Vienna, which reorganized the Continent 
after the Napoleonic Wars. 
</P>
<P>
The national boundaries redrawn at that historic, 19th-Century conference 
basically stood for 40 years. And while next week's CSCE meeting has no such 
sweeping brief, it does bring together in a harmonious mood former bitter 
antagonists. 
</P>
<P>
A centerpiece of the three-day summit will be the signing of an unprecedented 
treaty sharply reducing conventional arms deployed in Europe by East and West 
-- a goal believed hopelessly visionary not long ago. 
</P>
<P>
And after the ceiling lights dim and the television crews pack up, a small new 
CSCE Secretariat, probably based in Prague, will address itself to the 
nitty-gritty implementation of the lofty goals that will be enunciated in 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
These will include what some call a new Magna Carta, named for the 775-year-old 
agreement between the English king and his subjects which served as the 
foundation for democratic government. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be taking concrete steps afterward for the broad ideas the summit will 
espouse," said U.S. Ambassador John J. Maresca, representative to the CSCE 
Summit Preparatory Committee, which has been laboring in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
"These involve a document stating a commitment to human rights as a basis for 
government, free elections, and establishing a market system as the best way 
toward economic prosperity." 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end -- in addition to the small CSCE secretariat of about 10 
staffers -- officials will be manning a Conflict Prevention Center to stave off 
regional quarrels (probably to be set up in Vienna); establishing a CSCE 
mechanism to monitor national elections (probably in Warsaw); and setting up 
regular consultations of the 34 foreign ministers, probably twice a year, as 
well as summit meetings of the heads of government every other year. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting is also expected to appoint a semi-permanent CSCE parliamentary 
body, probably consisting of representatives from member nations' legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
And in Vienna immediately afterward, a new round of CFE talks will begin, which 
will attempt to reduce in a binding treaty the number of troops allowed in 
Central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The CSCE is not without its critics: Some officials fear a premature push for a 
CSCE that would take over military security responsibilities in Europe. Others 
warn that a permanent CSCE organization runs the risk of becoming an impotent 
"talking shop," which will be unable to make fast and firm decisions. 
</P>
<P>
The CSCE began life in Helsinki in 1972 when it was set up to deal with three 
main areas or "baskets" of issues: military security, economic cooperation, and 
human rights. There were 35 CSCE members then -- all the European states except 
Albania, along with the Soviet Union, the United States and Canada. This year, 
the number dropped to 34 with the unification of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The first CSCE agreement was the Helsinki Final Act signed in 1975 -- which 
established so-called "confidence-building measures" between East and West, set 
standards for human rights, and endorsed existing European boundaries. There 
have been follow-up CSCE meetings, in Belgrade (1977-78), Madrid (1980-83), and 
Stockholm (1984-86), but the Paris summit promises to be dramatically different 
from all the others. 
</P>
<P>
"The Paris summit," commented U.S. Ambassador Maresca, "will really be a 
celebration of the end of the Cold War."

That's one of the questions that architects, urban planners, economists and 
engineers from Latin America, the United States and Europe will be addressing 
at a seminar in the Ecuadorean capital this week jointly sponsored by the Getty 
Conservation Institute and the Regional Project for Cultural Heritage and 
Development of the United Nations.

<TEXT>
<P>
It will be a coming-out party for the New Europe, and the guests are to leave 
most of their weapons at the door. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the splendor of a 34-nation summit meeting in Paris next week, members of 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Warsaw Pact countries are to sign a 
historic treaty reducing the number of conventional forces -- tanks, artillery, 
and aircraft -- that both sides have stationed in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The landmark accord formally recognizes the end of the Cold War-era threat 
posed by the military forces of the former Soviet Bloc, which has disintegrated 
in the wake of the recent changes in Soviet foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
But the agreement comes amid political crosscurrents that raise serious 
questions about whether arms negotiations such as these have much of a future. 
</P>
<P>
Actual events -- such as the moves by the newly emerging East European 
democracies to expel remaining Soviet forces from their countries -- have been 
outpacing the negotiations. And with the Cold War over, there is less anxiety 
about war and, to some extent, less sense of urgency about traditional arms 
control efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The treaty limiting Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) provides for the Soviet 
Union and its former East European allies to slash their European arsenals by 
40% -- and for NATO to cut its European forces by 3% -- to comply with new 
equal arms ceilings on both sides of the now-fallen Iron Curtain. 
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, most of the surplus equipment must be destroyed, 
and each side will be authorized to conduct on-site inspections to verify that 
the other is complying with the terms of the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
And together with the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) agreement expected 
early next year, the CFE pact represents a milestone from which to view both 
the record of arms control negotiations to date and their prospects reaching 
into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Background 
</P>
<P>
Arms control has been central to U.S.-Soviet relations for more than a 
generation, and invariably has been controversial. 
</P>
<P>
The first U.S.-Soviet arms control treaty, in 1963, banned nuclear tests in the 
atmosphere, space and oceans. It succeeded in limiting radioactive 
contamination of the environment and demonstrated that the superpowers could 
begin to slow the arms race, if not stop it altogether. 
</P>
<P>
A decade later, in 1972, the first Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, known as 
SALT I, established ceilings on long-range nuclear missiles and bombers. But 
the limits that it set were higher than either side's actual arsenal, thereby 
legalizing a further arms buildup. 
</P>
<P>
A second strategic treaty in 1979, SALT II, called for minor reductions by the 
Soviet Union. But it contained a major loophole: Although the pact limited the 
number of missiles each side could have, it did not restrict the number of 
warheads each missile could carry. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, by taking advantage of new multiple-warhead technology, the 
superpowers were able during the 1980s to quadruple the number of strategic 
warheads they had targeted on one another atop essentially the same number of 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the START accord now nearing completion is to be the first 
strategic arms treaty to actually reduce the total number of weapons that the 
two sides have amassed -- by 30% overall, with a 50% cut in the most 
threatening ballistic missile warheads. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations to cut conventional weapons arsenals in Europe also have a 
checkered history. Talks between NATO and the Warsaw Pact nations achieved 
virtually nothing in 15 years before they were superseded by the CFE 
negotiations in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Even the new CFE treaty, which provides for the largest negotiated arms 
reductions in world history, has drawn its share of criticism. Skeptics say it 
has taken far too long and in itself moved only marginally toward making the 
world a safer place. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, the negotiations have been overtaken by events. Last February, 
for example, negotiators set manpower limits of 195,000 each for U.S. and 
Soviet troops in the central zone of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
But by July, those ceilings were obsolete. The new East European governments 
and the reunited Germany are forcing all Soviet forces out of the region by 
1994. As a result, the manpower limits were dropped out of the treaty; only 
weapons will be affected by the pact. 
</P>
<P>
Arms talks can also delay cuts that a country wants to make on its own. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials say part of the reason that Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev announced unilateral cuts of half a million troops in 1988 was that 
he feared that leaving such reductions to negotiations would actually delay 
their implementation. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, U.S. officials speculate that if the United States had tried to 
negotiate the withdrawal of thousands of short-range nuclear warheads from 
Europe a decade ago rather than unilaterally bringing them home as it has, the 
weapons might still be there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Debate 
</P>
<P>
How much can the world expect from arms control negotiations? Are they worth 
the effort? 
</P>
<P>
After studying the impact of arms-control talks over the past three decades, 
Harvard University professors Albert Carnesale and Richard Haass conclude that 
"what emerges above all is the modesty of what arms control has wrought. 
</P>
<P>
"If the history reveals anything, it is that arms control has proven neither as 
promising as some had hoped (in saving money and reducing tensions) nor as 
dangerous as others had feared (in lulling the Western public into accepting 
Soviet superiority)," they write. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth L. Adelman, a former director of the Arms Control and Disarmament 
Agency, gives an even harsher verdict. 
</P>
<P>
The big change in global security has come "not from arms negotiations, but 
from changes in the Soviet Union -- as we saw in the summer of 1989 when the 
Soviet threat ended," Adelman argues. "It had nothing to do with arms control." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters counter that Adelman expects too much of arms control. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Mendelsohn of the private Arms Control Assn. admits that the process has 
its shortcomings, but he notes that unilateral cuts do not provide for 
verification, for ensuring against reintroduction of forces, or for monitoring 
destruction of the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, proponents argue that arms-control agreements too often are judged on 
their technical merits rather than their political significance in 
bridge-building between the superpowers. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the U.S.-Soviet INF treaty of 1987 -- to eliminate medium-range 
nuclear missiles -- was insignificant militarily. The Soviets reduced their 
arsenal by 1,667 warheads, or only about 5% of their stockpile. The United 
States cut was 429 warheads, less than 2%. 
</P>
<P>
"But the political significance of the INF agreement -- the improvement in the 
U.S.-Soviet relationship in the second half of the Ronald Reagan Administration 
-- far outweighed the technical problems related to the details of military 
doctrine," foreign policy specialist Joseph S. Nye Jr. wrote in Foreign Affairs 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the importance of arms-control mechanisms to limit proliferation to 
Third World nations -- and of U.S. and Soviet example-setting to spur the 
process -- will grow rather than diminish as East-West tensions abate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Outlook 
</P>
<P>
The consensus is that despite its faults, arms-control efforts will continue -- 
but with a significant shift in their scope and direction. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, experts were forecasting another extended, wide-ranging strategic 
arms negotiation -- to be called START II -- that might seek to halve again the 
number of offensive nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the 8,000 to 9,000 warheads that would be permitted under START I, 
the talks would seek to set a limit of perhaps 4,000 warheads. And the 
loopholes and defects in the present agreement might be eliminated in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
But key Administration officials now believe that the flaws in START I should 
be attacked first in narrower negotiations, and that the most destabilizing 
weapons -- land-based missiles with multiple warheads, most capable of surprise 
attack -- should get top priority. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials also want to focus on making nuclear arsenals more stable -- a 
goal that might be better served by agreement to ban multiple warheads on new 
missiles than by another drastic reduction in the number of U.S. and Soviet 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Another high U.S. priority will be talks to ensure who has physical control 
over nuclear weapons in times of crisis. Officials are especially concerned 
about how well Soviet nuclear weapons can be safeguarded from dissidents and 
terrorists during times of domestic unrest. 
</P>
<P>
A similar shift on the conventional arms control agenda may occur. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiators already are committed to follow-on talks to deal with the 
troop-levels issue, which has been excluded from the CFE treaty. But U.S. 
officials would prefer that any new negotiations emphasize new 
"confidence-building measures," such as including more visits by foreign 
observers to military maneuvers and reducing the size of the maneuvering forces 
(now 13,000 men) that may be subject to inspection visits. 
</P>
<P>
Washington also is likely to press for an "open skies" agreement that would 
permit inspection overflights by aircraft that are equipped with the most 
advanced electronic sensing gear. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, high on the new arms control agenda will be efforts to expand and 
intensify multinational cooperation to prevent further proliferation of 
chemical and nuclear weapon technology -- and delivery vehicles such as 
ballistic missiles -- by Third World nations. 
</P>
<P>
While Iraq is the main threat today, U.S. officials are only slightly less 
worried about nuclear war between Pakistan and India, North Korea's growing 
potential to build nuclear devices, and Iran's desire to match whatever Iraq 
does.

First it was the Cuyahoga, the river in Cleveland that was so polluted it 
caught fire. Now, there's Lake Ontario, the lake that's so full of chemicals it 
develops photographs. 
</P>
<P>
Or so says Jeremy Lynch, a third-year photography student at Ryerson 
Polytechnical Institute here. Lynch has a portfolio of black-and-white pictures 
of the Toronto lake front developed, he says, in water from the lake itself. He 
says he added no chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really scary," said Lynch. "I have one print that's almost like a regular 
photograph," so perfect is the quality of the image. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Eastman Kodak say they are skeptical of Lynch's claims, but his 
professor at Ryerson, Bill Scanlon, stands behind his student. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not pulling the wool over anybody's eyes, by any means," Scanlon said. 
"People have done this before, but nobody paid that much attention." 
</P>
<P>
Nor does it come as any surprise to Toronto environmental and health officials 
that something is wrong with Lake Ontario, the source of this city's drinking 
water. "This gives us a bit of a picture of the state of the water today," said 
Bob Pickett, Toronto's assistant director of water pollution control. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch got interested in the photographic potential of lake water last spring, 
when he was drinking in a bar with some friends and a heavy rain was falling 
outside. Lynch gazed out at the downpour and thought about acid rain, which has 
been killing marine life in the lakes of southern Ontario for years. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew acid rain doesn't develop film," Lynch says, but he began thinking that 
maybe lake water would. 
</P>
<P>
The photographer says he first called various provincial environmental 
officials to ask where he could find water heavily contaminated with mercury 
and iron, chemicals that were used to develop daguerreotypes in the early years 
of photography. The officials refused to give out such information, he says, so 
he set off by himself to the Lake Ontario shoreline. He took samples of water 
from near places that struck him as promising: factories, a shipyard, an 
airport, a beach, the mouth of a canal, a ferry landing. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I did it in the worst possible places," he says, adding that he 
made his rounds on calm days, when there were no waves to disperse the scum 
floating at the water's edge. 
</P>
<P>
Next, Lynch exposed some film and put it into film-developing canisters with 
his various water samples. 
</P>
<P>
Darkroom chemicals take about 10 minutes to develop a roll of film, but lake 
water turns out to take a lot longer. Lynch says he started developing his film 
at 8 a.m., and the negatives didn't come up on the film until the afternoon of 
the following day. Lynch said he swirled the contents of the canisters every 
half an hour or so, to keep the pollutants dispersed in the water. He says he 
spent the night hitting the 20-minute "snooze" bar on his alarm clock to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Some water samples produced no negatives. Water from the beach, for instance, 
was full of bacteria that ate the emulsion off Lynch's film, he says. The best 
sample for developing turned out to be the one he took at the shipyard, where a 
rusting old cargo vessel was apparently leaching a lot of iron into the water. 
</P>
<P>
After he had his negatives, Lynch took his water samples to a local chemical 
recycling plant for a professional analysis. His initial hunch, that mercury in 
the water was developing the film, proved to be wrong; mercury appeared only in 
minute quantities. But there was plenty of iron. And the shipyard sample also 
turned out to contain about 1% diesel fuel, with lesser quantities of motor 
oil, dye, varnish and paint. 
</P>
<P>
Fuel oils and paints contain some of the same chemicals used in the modern 
photo-finishing process, Lynch says. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch's portfolio won't win any prizes for aesthetics; the pictures are rudely 
composed and the tones run generally from white to gray, without many true 
blacks to add interest. Lynch says he wants it that way. He said he tried to 
shoot Toronto's lake front the way a tourist with a point-and-shoot camera 
would, going for simple views rather than thoughtful composition. He likes it 
that the lake water's suspended grit, fuzz and fibers left ghostly images on 
his prints. 
</P>
<P>
"Grain the size of golf balls," he says with satisfaction, pointing to a 
blotchy sky in one of his pictures. He thinks the poor quality of the 
photographs only adds to their environmental message. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Lynch's Toronto collection is complete, he said he wants to travel to 
the waterfronts of other great American cities and develop their images in the 
local waters. Niagara Falls, the Statue of Liberty, Detroit's Renaissance 
Center -- he thinks his treatment of each could provoke thought, or maybe even 
action, on the part of viewers. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's going to make people think a lot more," he said. "Shoving 
something down someone's throat is not as effective as showing him."

</P>
<P>
JORGE CARRILLO OLEA SAYS HIS APPOINTMENT TO THE POST OF ANTI-DRUG CZAR DOES NOT 
REFLECT A SHIFT IN OFFICIAL POLICY. IT MAY, HOWEVER, BE A SHIFT AWAY FROM 
ALLEGED HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN COMBATTING DOPE DEALERS.

MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This country's new drug czar, Jorge Carrillo Olea, has met repeatedly with U.S. 
officials to reassure them that his appointment does not signal a shift in the 
country's aggressive anti-narcotics program and coordination with the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari named Carrillo Olea to the top drug post 
Oct. 15 to replace Javier Coello Trejo, under whose leadership the Federal 
Judicial Police had captured record quantities of cocaine but reportedly 
committed widespread human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
"There is great uncertainty in the United States about what Carrillo's attitude 
will be regarding (bilateral) coordination," said a source in the Mexican 
attorney general's office. "There will be more coordination. He's interested in 
a more fluid exchange of information." 
</P>
<P>
The bespectacled Carrillo told reporters at a press conference after his 
appointment that "international cooperation is key to combatting this social 
phenomenon -- drug trafficking." 
</P>
<P>
Before taking the drug post, Carrillo Olea was director general of national 
security, a job that included analyzing the flows of South American narcotics 
through Mexico. Salinas named him to the new post with the title of general 
coordinator of investigations and the fight against drug trafficking; because 
he is not a lawyer, he could not legally be appointed to the post of deputy 
attorney general that Coello held. 
</P>
<P>
At 53, Carrillo, a retired army general, has a background in army intelligence 
rather than police work; he is far more polished and political than was his 
gruff and burly predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
"He is someone with a military training who is hard and intransigent but 
intelligent and political," said the source in the attorney general's office 
who declined to be identified. "Coello didn't have the political sensibilities 
that he has." 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. source comparing the two said, "He (Carrillo) is a sharp instrument 
instead of a blunt instrument." 
</P>
<P>
Coello, who held the job of deputy attorney general for two years, first ran 
into trouble with the Mexican press and people when he publicly defended his 
bodyguards against charges that several of them gang-raped more than a dozen 
women in Mexico City early this year. 
</P>
<P>
National and international human rights groups also held him responsible for 
the torture, extortion, kidnaping and murder allegedly committed by the Federal 
Judicial Police under his authority. Government officials conceded that Salinas 
brought in Carrillo to clean up the department's actions and image. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Salinas proposed new laws aimed at curbing police torture. 
Under the laws that must be approved by the National Congress, interrogations 
would be carried out by lawyers from the attorney general's office rather than 
by federal police, and they would be conducted in the presence of a defense 
attorney. Confessions no longer would be sufficient evidence on which to 
convict a suspected criminal; suspects illegally detained would have to be 
released. 
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. drug officials feared that the changes might mean the Salinas 
administration was pulling back on its anti-drug efforts. Salinas has served 
two years of his six-year term, and past administrations have tended to let 
down their guard on the drug front after two years, falling into a pattern of 
police corruption by the final two years. 
</P>
<P>
Since his appointment, Carrillo has met with U.S. Ambassador John D. Negroponte 
as well as with top Drug Enforcement Administration officials in Mexico. He has 
told them that police will vigorously pursue drug traffickers while observing 
human rights and that the government will continue to develop its Northern 
Border Task Force, a program to intercept cocaine-laden aircraft headed for the 
United States from South America. 
</P>
<P>
"He said his appointment should not be interpreted as a change in policy," said 
one U.S. official. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the human rights policy is going to diminish their (Mexican police) 
effectiveness at the street level, but not at the program level," the American 
official added. "You have to treat (suspects) like you do in the United States 
now, which means they have all the leeway in the world to say nothing. 
Investigations will go more slowly." 
</P>
<P>
Coca, the plant from which cocaine is produced, is not grown in Mexico, but 
Mexico is a major route for getting the drugs into the United States. U.S. 
officials estimate that 300 to 350 metric tons of South American cocaine passes 
through Mexico into the United States each year. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Mexican government cooperation in the fight against drug trafficking 
has grown immensely under Salinas. The U.S. government is to deliver nine armed 
Huey UH-1H helicopters to Mexico beginning this month for the Northern Border 
Task Force to use in bringing down the drug planes. Eleven Mexicans currently 
are in training to fly the helicopters at Ft. Rucker, Ala. The helicopters will 
be on loan. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico also will purchase two Cessna Citation fixed-wing aircraft with radar to 
track drug flights from South America. A U.S. Customs team has been in Mexico 
for several weeks training pilots to use the radar, fly and repair the planes. 
On one such training mission last month, the Mexican government captured six 
tons of cocaine in Ciudad Jimenez, Chihuahua -- the largest seizure ever in 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. and Mexico officials said they will continue to work together through the 
Northern Border Task Force. They said that U.S. P-3 radar aircraft will track 
flights from Colombia into international waters off the coast of Mexico, where 
the American planes will hand off tracking of the flights to the Mexican 
Cessnas. The Cessnas will follow the Colombian planes to clandestine strips in 
northern Mexico, where they will be met by federal police in the armed 
helicopters. The Cessnas cannot land on the dirt airstrips. 
</P>
<P>
The Chihuahua raid essentially was a dry run of this. 
</P>

"This proves that when all the elements are in place, it goes right," said a 
U.S. official.

U.S. and Mexican officials said they expect Carrillo to keep a lower profile 
than his predecessor, but to be equally active. They said he has been holding 
meetings with police commanders to impress upon them that there will be new 
laws regarding arrests and investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Human rights and the fight against drug trafficking "are not incompatible," 
Carrillo told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of uncertainty among the commanders," said a Mexican official. 
"Carrillo is stressing legality to them. He is going to be different in style. 
The hand of Carrillo will be seen when the continued efficiency of the police 
is felt, but legally; when we announce five tons of cocaine has been captured 
and the judge doesn't say, 'But the pilot was tortured, his confession was 
extracted through torture.' "

From Secretary General Manfred Woerner on down, officials of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization publicly welcome the permanent establishment of a CSCE 
secretariat. Privately, however, some NATO officials express reservations that 
the CSCE may try to bite off more than it can chew in terms of its security 
brief. 
</P>
<P>
And NATO is not alone. The European Commission, the executive arm of the 
12-member European Community (EC), is also nervous that the new CSCE 
secretariat might try to usurp some of its policy-making powers. 
</P>
<P>
As NATO searches for a new role in the wake of the Cold War, its 16 members 
believe that an organization that has proven its immense worth during the past 
40 years should not be upstaged by an untried newcomer. 
</P>
<P>
"NATO has been closely consulted about the future of the CSCE," observed a 
deputy ambassador here. "Our members have been in the forefront of advocating 
the various measures expected to be approved at the Paris summit." 
</P>
<P>
And another NATO official added: "We see the institutionalization of the CSCE 
as complementary organization to NATO. But CSCE cannot and should not replace 
NATO. Why? Because CSCE will be made up of 16 NATO nations, the Eastern 
Europeans, and 12 neutral or nonaligned countries. NATO works by consensus -- 
by the silence rule. That is, one asks: 'Any objections? If not, motion 
carried.' 
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to imagine the 34 countries in CSCE reaching a consensus on many of 
the hard questions on security that will undoubtedly have to be faced." 
</P>
<P>
The officials at NATO's Brussels headquarters contend that a sizable military 
force is still needed in Europe until it is clearer that the Soviet Union no 
longer poses a threat to the West. 
</P>
<P>
As one NATO diplomat put it: "We don't want to be rivals with the CSCE, or for 
that matter, the EC, or the Western European Union (WEU -- a group of European 
NATO members who jointly consult on defense matters). NATO will help in any way 
we can, as we watch how the CSCE develops as an institution. But this will take 
years, and, meanwhile, we should make sure that NATO isn't scrapped before 
there is something just as effective to take its place." WILLIAM TUOHY

<P>
Reassessing a changed Continent, the Mediterranean countries of Europe are now 
looking more south than north in formulating plans for their security through 
the century's end. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet imperialism has been replaced by more fragmented but hardly less 
troubling threats stoked by strife in the Middle East and hunger in North 
Africa. The specter of terrorism, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism, common 
environmental concerns, and how to control the swell of economic and political 
refugees from Africa crowd the new security agenda. 
</P>
<P>
The Mediterranean countries of France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Turkey, 
all support CSCE and its programs as a safeguard of their continental security. 
But they also argue that the Persian Gulf crisis has reinforced the need for 
strong security cooperation among Mediterranean countries. 
</P>
<P>
As a supplement to the CSCE, some of the major European Mediterranean countries 
want to create a southern counterpart that would include non-European neighbors 
in North Africa as part of a Conference on Security and Cooperation in the 
Mediterranean (CSCM). 
</P>
<P>
The still-fledgling idea of Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis and 
Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, his Spanish counterpart, is to create an 
instrument for resolving conflicts in the Middle East by grouping countries in 
a vast area from Iran to Mauritania. To make the somewhat Utopian idea more 
credible, they also seek American participation. 
</P>
<P>
France and Portugal would be among the European sponsors of CSCM, although the 
French are not persuaded that any such organization should extend beyond the 
European and Africa Mediterranean and into the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing fears heard throughout southern Europe, Ordonez has warned of a 
possible "collision course between Islam and the West." De Michelis is 
proposing that the European Community nations contribute one-quarter of one 
percent of their gross national products to aid the Maghreb countries -- the 
principal source of migration, much of it illegal, to countries like France, 
Italy, and Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Greece, an economic backbencher with Portugal in the rich man's European 
Community, is a bit player with singular security concerns. Chief among them is 
divided Cyprus, where minority Turks live in a self-proclaimed republic that 
only Ankara recognizes. 
</P>
<P>
The Greeks, like their archenemies in Turkey and other southern-tier countries 
as well, also worry about the spillover of economic refugees fleeing a newly 
free but desperately poor Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the southern-tier countries, and at great economic cost, Turkey is the 
most active and unabashed pro-Western player in the ongoing gulf crisis. After 
40 years of preoccupation with the Turkish-Soviet border, it is now Turkey's 
border with Iraq that counts -- to Turkey and to the West. Squadrons of 
American fighter-bombers are poised at Turkish bases, and 100,000 Iraqi troops 
are pinned down by Turkish forces along their common frontier. WILLIAM D.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One cold November night in 1981, a fire swept through the cluttered hillside 
mobile home of Ray Girdler Jr., killing his wife and child. 
</P>
<P>
Girdler escaped, running to his car in his undershorts for a fire extinguisher 
that he never used. He stood by, unburned and unblackened, while flames leaped 
into the starry desert sky. 
</P>
<P>
"They're gone," Girdler said to a neighbor. "They're gone." 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters would later call it an exceptionally hot blaze; witnesses saw it 
from Highway 69, the two-lane road that winds through brush-covered hills on 
its way into this picturesque former gold-mining town of 30,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
The extreme intensity of the fire was what led suspicion back to Ray Girdler. 
He was convicted of murdering his wife, Sherry, and daughter, Jennifer, for 
$6,000 in insurance money. State fire investigators testified to scientific 
"proof" of arson: heat-warped metal, burn patterns on the trailer floor in the 
shape of pools of liquid, multiple locations where the fire appeared to start. 
</P>
<P>
It was clear, the state experts said, that Girdler had splashed at least a 
gallon of flammable liquid -- probably gasoline -- inside the trailer. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, after eight years in Arizona State Prison, eight years without 
his wife and child, eight years of insisting he was wronged, Girdler is back in 
the news: a man who may be innocent, after all. Advances in fire science have 
wrought a stunning turnabout, providing explanations for the fire that suddenly 
seem to justify Girdler's version of events. In September the 44-year-old 
Girdler was granted a new trial, which is now pending. 
</P>
<P>
The case vividly illustrates the difficulties of criminal prosecution in the 
face of evolving knowledge; how yesterday's certainties sometimes dissolve into 
troubling ambiguities; how science and justice are uneasy partners. 
</P>
<P>
Girdler is not alone. He is one of two men in Arizona whose convictions for 
arson murder are being reexamined by the courts. The cases involve the same 
zealous state arson investigator, the same defense lawyers, the same scientific 
videotapes and experts. 
</P>
<P>
The sagas of Ray Girdler and John Henry Knapp, 45, a Mesa resident who was sent 
to Death Row after his two young daughters died in 1973, represent virtually 
the same legal battle. Each man bases his hopes for freedom on the relatively 
new scientific understanding of "flashover," a phenomenon in which a fire, even 
an innocent one, can virtually explode in a small room to temperatures of 2,000 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
In flashover, scientists now say, hot fire gases gather near the ceiling and 
radiate heat, causing combustible items on the floor, such as carpeting or 
clothing, to burst into flame. The phenomenon was filmed in the mid-1980s by 
researchers at Harvard University and the National Bureau of Standards' Center 
for Fire Research. It has changed assumptions about fire investigation because 
flashover can mimic arson, producing the same intense burning with multiple 
points of ignition. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to come to grips with the fact that in the past, physical 
evidence which may just occur naturally . . . has been taken as evidence of 
arson," said former firefighter Richard L. P. Custer, who is revamping fire 
investigation guidelines for the National Fire Protection Assn. in Quincy, 
Mass. "The erroneous theories of what indicates arson, such as holes burned 
into floors, multiple points of origin and dribble marks, have been written up 
in books and reinforced by word of mouth. 
</P>
<P>
"The real solution to this thing is education." 
</P>
<P>
Of the two Arizona cases, Girdler's is perhaps more striking in its turnabout 
and less complicated by unanswered questions. Journalist J. W. Casserly of the 
Phoenix New Times perceived Girdler as guilty based on the original trial 
testimony. "Now, after seeing all the (flashover) evidence come back, I don't 
think there's a jury in the United States that would put Ray Girdler in jail 
again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Girdler's in-laws, Carl and Jean Akers, have never believed that Girdler would 
kill. They say he loved his wife and child. 
</P>
<P>
"Surely," said Jean Akers, "if there had been any animosity or anything we 
would have felt it. We just never thought he should be in prison." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
College Sweethearts 
</P>
<P>
Six years after they met in junior college, Ray and Sherry Girdler found a 
50-foot single-wide trailer selling for $2,750. "A steal," Ray told people in 
1980. It contained a kitchen at one end adjacent to a den with sliding glass 
doors. A short hallway led to a small bedroom, a bathroom and a master bedroom. 
The rear door was near the master bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
With a year-old baby, the Girdlers were looking to the future when they hauled 
the purchase to a scrubby ridge of homes three miles outside Prescott. 
</P>
<P>
But from the day they moved in, the Girdlers struggled with bills. They were 
unemployed in the autumn of 1981 and the phone had been cut off. They were in 
jeopardy of losing gas and electrical service and were more than six months 
behind on their mobile home payments. 
</P>
<P>
"Sherry . . . would really get frantic about (the finances)," Girdler said 
later. Meanwhile, he read Popular Science, tinkered with placing a windmill on 
the roof to save power costs and schemed of selling used novels in a mobile 
van. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the fire. According to Girdler's account, Sherry and the baby had 
gone to bed. A night owl, Girdler stayed up smoking on the den couch and 
watching TV. He drank several beers and went to bed about 2:15 a.m., only to be 
awakened soon afterward by a family cat. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounded like (the cat) was in some kind of distress . . . upset or 
something," Girdler said. "I stood up beside the bed and . . . I remember 
(Sherry) saying: 'Oh, my God' because we knew there was smoke." 
</P>
<P>
He assumed Sherry was going for the baby, Girdler would later tell jurors. "I 
was thinking it was a fire, and if I could get the fire extinguisher on it 
quick enough I could contain it." 
</P>
<P>
Stepping outside, Girdler hurried toward his car. Passing the sliding-glass 
doors of the den, he could look inside and see the fire on the couch -- not yet 
large enough, he said, for alarm. But he struggled several minutes to free the 
extinguisher from a clasp on the car floor. 
</P>
<P>
The next time he looked through the sliding-glass doors, Girdler said, the 
blaze engulfed the room, and suddenly his only thought was to find his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see shapes without my glasses. I can't see very well, but I can see 
shapes," Girdler said, "and I didn't see (Sherry) anywhere. I was thinking: 
'Where is my honey?' -- and she wasn't out there." 
</P>
<P>
By now, intense heat and smoke blasted from the rear door, keeping him out, 
according to Girdler. He yelled for help and a neighbor, Tom Tucker, rushed to 
the scene and shut off the gas valve. Tucker also found the heat too intense to 
enter and stood with Girdler while the flames climbed. 
</P>
<P>
Sirens became audible in the distance. "He just, you know, kept saying: 
'They're gone, they're gone,' " Tucker recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Girdler's behavior then became strangely disinterested. While Tucker hurried 
downhill to lead firefighters to the trailer, Girdler turned and walked away. A 
short while later he was at Tucker's home, asking for a beer. He sat on the 
couch, apparently calm, while his wife and daughter burned. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters required 4,000 gallons of water to stop the fire. The trailer was 
a smoldering hulk by the time state fire investigator Robert Humphrey began his 
work the following morning. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey found signs that led to a further inspection by Arizona's chief deputy 
fire marshal, David Dale, a thin, balding man who would become the key 
scientific witness against Girdler; he was "the top in his field," prosecutor 
Robert Landis would later tell jurors. "(Dale) wrote the book on fire 
investigations." 
</P>
<P>
Dale's investigation took only two hours. He concentrated on collapsed 
bedsprings and heat-warped aluminum -- signs of tremendous heat. Dale also 
studied the floor. The degree of burning there was abnormal, a contrast to the 
principle that "heat goes up and out," the investigators agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Patterns were visible -- areas of greater and lesser burn -- and in some places 
the floor had charred completely through. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies were in the baby's bedroom. They contained about twice the levels of 
carbon monoxide poisoning necessary for coma. A table leg was found lying 
across Sherry Girdler's torso. Her skull was broken. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Husband Arrested 
</P>
<P>
Girdler was arrested four days after the fire and tried for murder the 
following April. Prosecutor Landis stressed Girdler's financial problems and 
his apparent indifference to the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
Although the fire's heat caused numerous fractures and amputations in both 
victims, Landis saw the table leg as significant. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe that was used to incapacitate her -- we don't know," Landis told jurors. 
Girdler, meanwhile, walked away "unmarked, unblemished, unscathed . . . 
unconcerned with the fire." Court-appointed defense attorney Kemp Wilhelmsen 
found one witness, the Rev. John Hollowell, who testified to the tragedy's 
impact on Girdler. At his church office the day afterward, Girdler "broke down 
in intense grief, weeping and crying," the pastor said. 
</P>
<P>
The defense argued that the fire was accidental, caused by a smoldering 
cigarette left on the den couch or by an electrical short in the wall socket 
behind it; one cord there ran through the floor to an outdoor freezer. 
</P>
<P>
Wilhelmsen debunked the table leg as a weapon: How then could it wind up on top 
of the ashes? 
</P>
<P>
But the scientific evidence was strong. Humphrey and Dale spoke of arson as "a 
fact" of the case and testified that a "liquid accelerant" was splashed 
liberally throughout the trailer. No chemical traces of fuel were found, but in 
such a hot fire, the two experts noted, the accelerant often burns completely. 
</P>
<P>
Dale further ruled out the possibility that the fire was set by an intruder. 
Fuel vapors would have created an instantaneous holocaust. A sleeping Girdler 
could not have escaped. "Whoever was lying in that bed at the time of ignition 
would most certainly burn and very seriously," Dale said. 
</P>
<P>
At mid-trial, prosecutors unveiled another blow to the defense: A two-time 
convict named Danny Ketner, who had shared a cell with Girdler, testified to 
hearing a confession from a disconsolate Girdler. He said Girdler had blurted: 
"I shouldn't have killed my baby." 
</P>
<P>
"What did you say?" Ketner said he asked incredulously. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing," Girdler purportedly said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Girdler denied making the statement, the guilty verdict surprised no 
one. "Don't you think, ladies and gentlemen, that if the defendant had anything 
at all going for him regarding how the fire occurred -- anything that would 
contradict the experts -- don't you think that" would have come out? Landis 
thundered. 
</P>
<P>
Girdler was sentenced to two consecutive life terms. Dale was again a witness 
at the presentencing hearing, where he addressed the heinous nature of the 
crime in light of a possible death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Time and again, Dale compared the case to one of Arizona's most notorious arson 
convictions, another in which Dale had been a key witness. That case, dating to 
a cold November night eight years prior, involved another debt-plagued man 
named John Henry Knapp. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Children Died 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, John Knapp was 28, a burly Vietnam veteran who suffered intense 
migraines. Laid off from a job at a can factory, Knapp worked sporadically 
driving a cab. Unpaid bills had resulted in the intermittent loss of telephone, 
electrical and gas service at the squalid tract home in Mesa he shared with his 
wife Linda and two young daughters. The Knapps cooked on a Coleman stove. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Knapp did not work and was plagued, her husband said later, by 
depression; she had previously attempted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
The fire of Nov. 16, 1973 -- which killed Linda Marie Knapp, 3, and Iona Knapp, 
2 -- began at 8 a.m. and rapidly engulfed the children's tiny bedroom. John 
Knapp later claimed the children must have been playing with matches, perhaps 
trying to keep warm. (According to defense attorneys, matchbooks were found 
throughout the household debris.) Knapp told jurors he had been asleep on a 
sofa bed in the living room. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember, very vague, I woke up and I saw my wife walking towards the 
hallway and I heard the kids crying," Knapp testified. "The next thing I 
remember . . . I heard my wife scream." 
</P>
<P>
In Knapp's version, he found his wife trying to reach the children in a room 
filled with fire. He pulled her back, ran outside, struggled with a garden hose 
and smashed a window to spray the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
The case would become a soap opera, as surreal and twisted as a David Lynch 
film. While firefighters recovered the children's charred bodies, Linda Knapp 
was hysterical, neighbors testified; John, however, was calm, even talkative -- 
"like the host at a cocktail party," one witness said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators, including David Dale, found evidence of intense floor-level 
burning in patterns suggesting a liquid accelerant. An empty Coleman fuel can 
was discovered buried in a closet. 
</P>
<P>
Police halted the funeral just before the tiny coffins were lowered into the 
ground, announcing there would be an inquest. The same night, without telling 
her husband, Linda Knapp left with her father for Nebraska, answering police 
questions only when they traveled there to see her. John Knapp, meanwhile, was 
interrogated by authorities at the charred house and later at the police 
station. 
</P>
<P>
Knapp discounted suspicions that his wife set the fire. But it was arson, 
police insisted. If his wife were innocent, he must have set the fire. 
</P>
<P>
The interrogation lasted several hours. Knapp began to complain of severe 
headaches. He was seeing spots, he said. He became so tormented, according to 
transcripts, that he began pulling out his hair. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, versions of the session diverge. According to police Sgt. Robert 
Malone, Knapp then confessed to the crime: "He said he loved his wife very much 
and that he didn't want to lose her. He felt that perhaps the loss of their 
children would bring them together. . . . He was tired of seeing them eat dog 
food and cat food and drinking the cat's milk. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The confession was never recorded or transcribed. Knapp later denied making the 
comments, saying his migraine was so bad he began answering "yes" to every 
police question. 
</P>
<P>
At trial, a Tucson engineering consultant named Marshall Smyth presented 
time-lapse photographs and videotapes in Knapp's defense, showing the startling 
speed at which children's mattresses could erupt in roaring flame. The jury 
deadlocked and a second trial began. This time the judge excluded Smyth's 
photographic evidence. The consultant asked to construct a full-scale model of 
the tiny bedroom to conduct a fire demonstration, but the court declined to 
allocate the necessary $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
Knapp was ultimately convicted and sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
By the time of the Girdler fire and subsequent confinement at Arizona State 
Prison, Knapp had been there for seven years -- on Death Row. Knapp continued 
to fight, however. Numerous appeals and legal petitions were being filed, all 
in vain. 
</P>
<P>
"And then," said defense attorney Larry Hammond, "a series of odd things began 
to happen: Linda Knapp divorces him, moves to Utah, remarries, has a son. The 
boy's name is Russell Sorensen. 
</P>
<P>
"Russell, when he's about 6 years old, has a fire in his little bed -- almost 
dies." 
</P>
<P>
The incident was not immediately known to the Phoenix law firm of Meyer, 
Hendricks, Victor, Osborn &amp; Maledon, which had agreed to take on Knapp's 
case pro bono -- without payment. But the firm hired a private investigator who 
found Linda Knapp's second husband, Warren Sorensen, in a jail where Sorensen 
was doing time for forgery. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had split and were involved in a custody battle. Sorensen talked of 
the fire in his son's bed and claimed that Linda Knapp had privately confessed 
of killing her two children in Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
American Lawyer magazine later investigated the case for an article it 
entitled, "An Innocent Man on Death Row," and reported evidence of other fires 
at Linda Knapp's home. Linda Knapp, however, denied setting or confessing to 
the one that killed her children. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosures went nowhere in court. A judge ruled that the information might 
tend to incriminate Linda Knapp, but it fell short of clearing her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1985, a turning point came: Fire consultant Smyth learned of academic 
studies concerning flashover and obtained videotapes. Harvard had filmed a 
one-inch flame growing to engulf a room in less than seven minutes. Flashover 
could melt synthetics, creating petroleum-based liquid runs like those of 
flammable fuels. 
</P>
<P>
New court petitions were drafted. Either Linda Knapp started the fire or it 
could be blamed on matches and flashover, defense attorneys figured. Either 
way, John Knapp's culpability was now seriously in question. 
</P>
<P>
In early 1987, Superior Court Judge Stephen A. Gerst agreed, granting Knapp a 
new trial. The prosecution stalled. "The next thing you know," Hammond said, 
"John Henry Knapp walks out of the jail a free man." 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen years had gone by. Stepping into the streets, the smiling, gap-toothed 
Knapp was mobbed by reporters and TV cameras. It was one of the biggest 
judicial news stories in Arizona history, carried statewide by media making 
their fledgling attempts at explaining flashover. And one of the most 
interested readers of all was Popular Science aficionado Ray Girdler. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Letter to Law Firm 
</P>
<P>
Girdler's letter to the law firm of Meyer, Hendricks was handed around like 
prank mail. "How many more of these will we get?" attorneys joked. But, 
according to Hammond, the more they looked into the case, the more they were 
amazed. 
</P>
<P>
"Girdler is a shocking case," Hammond said. "I could understand how a jury 
could convict Knapp. I could understand how the passions and the prejudices of 
the case, coupled with the 'confession,' could lead a jury to do that. Girdler, 
the closer you get to that case, the more inexplicable it becomes." 
</P>
<P>
The law firm, just finished with one costly pro bono crusade, reluctantly took 
on another. Testimony at a new hearing began this year in June. 
</P>
<P>
Girdler's lawyers, again using a private detective, had taped an interview with 
Danny Ketner, the former convict who testified to Girdler's purported 
confession. Now, Ketner conceded that Girdler's comment, "I shouldn't have 
killed my baby," might have been merely an expression of remorse -- Girdler 
feeling responsible. 
</P>
<P>
David Dale was called. Under questioning by defense attorney Ed Hendricks, Dale 
appeared as a different man than the one touted in 1982 as the man who "wrote 
the book" on arson. 
</P>
<P>
"I never wrote any books," Dale testified; in fact, he acknowledged, the only 
article he ever circulated was one he had plagiarized from another firefighter. 
Dale had never graduated from high school. He passed an equivalency test in 
1963 -- just before becoming a fireman -- after holding jobs as a shoe 
salesman, a parking attendant and a tool-and-die-maker. 
</P>
<P>
The damaging testimony seemed to set up Dale for Hendricks' next line of 
questioning. Did Dale know about the phenomenon of flashover, and its 
consequences, at the time of Girdler's trial? Despite the fact that discussion 
of the phenomenon was confined largely to a few academics at that time, Dale 
answered that he did. 
</P>
<P>
"But you didn't tell the judge or jury about (flashover), did you, sir?" 
Hendricks demanded. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I did not." 
</P>
<P>
Hendricks now raised a scientific point that had gone all but overlooked during 
the trial -- the high levels of carbon monoxide in the victims. 
</P>
<P>
How could Sherry and Jennifer Girdler consume so much carbon monoxide in an 
instantaneous inferno? Hendricks wondered. They would have inhaled large 
volumes of superheated air. And yet, he pointed out to Dale, the autopsies 
showed no searing of the lungs, bronchial tubes or trachea. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know that," Dale said. 
</P>
<P>
"You didn't know that because you didn't bother to read the autopsy reports?" 
</P>
<P>
"That's correct," Dale said. 
</P>
<P>
Dale declined to be interviewed because of the pending new trial. However, in 
spite of his concessions, he still clings to his assertion that the fire was 
arson: "Absolutely," he told a reporter. "Today I'm no less persuaded (of 
Girdler's guilt) than after my initial findings." 
</P>
<P>
The order of a new trial came soon after another startling development: The 
rearrest of John Henry Knapp, three years after his release from prison. Knapp 
would be retried, after all, the Arizona attorney general's office announced. A 
preliminary hearing began in late August and it appeared conceivable the two 
trials might proceed concurrently. 
</P>
<P>
Hammond wonders how many innocent men might be in prison based on arson 
evidence that is now questionable -- just as he wonders how to account for the 
impassive behavior of Ray Girdler and John Henry Knapp at moments of tragedy. 
Hammond theorizes that there is something inscrutable about death by fire. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't see the people die," he said. "You can't see who's dead behind the 
flames. Your mind won't let you grasp the horror of it."

BUILDUP WILL FORCE SOME WAR-OR-PEACE DECISIONS

<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and President Bush, caught in a tightening vise 
of confrontation, face war-or-peace choices as the American military buildup 
mounts in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Both have stuck doggedly to their tough positions over the nearly 3 1/2 months 
since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, with Bush building a political and military 
wall around Iraq and Hussein holding onto the oil sheikdom like a bulldog. 
</P>
<P>
With the American deployment of up to 240,000 more troops to the Persian Gulf 
expected to tip the military balance firmly in favor of the United States 
within two months, talk of a diplomatic solution is on the rise. But it is a 
course full of pitfalls for both sides -- with no assurance of success. 
</P>
<P>
If a deal is to be struck, probably under the cover of intra-Arab negotiations 
that have yet to get off the ground, the formula will be delicate and neither 
side will get what it set out for. 
</P>
<P>
For Iraq, Hussein faces an implied timetable for withdrawing his troops from 
Kuwait or risking U.S. attack. His previous open-ended strategy of 
delay-and-discuss may be obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Milton Viorst, an author who has written extensively about Iraq and the 
Middle East, said the most likely resolution of the conflict would spring from 
recognition by Hussein that he is outgunned. 
</P>
<P>
"He is not going to win anything until Bush makes the decision that this has 
got to be a diplomatically resolved problem," Viorst said in an interview in 
Washington. "(But) he is not going to cave in to Bush unless there are some 
negotiations. He will not accept an ultimatum." 
</P>
<P>
In a standoff, some options will look better than others to Baghdad: 
</P>
<P>
* Iraq will continue to divert international attention from the anguish of 
occupied Kuwait by talking peace and dealing out some of the thousands of 
Western and Japanese captives held in Iraq and Kuwait as insurance against 
military attack. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign political personalities have streamed to Baghdad in recent weeks in 
hopes of persuading Hussein to release some hostages. Some, like Britain's 
former Prime Minister Edward Heath and Germany's ex-Chancellor Willy Brandt, 
declared that they are prepared to go again and said that Hussein's position on 
Kuwait has its points. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Baghdad could be expected to continue its attempts to split the 
international coalition opposing it, particularly the five permanent members of 
the U.N. Security Council. Any one of the five could veto future resolutions 
tightening the economic and military stranglehold on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Geoffrey Kemp, a senior associate at the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment 
for Peace, said there has been "an indication that (Hussein) is inching toward 
dialogue." He theorized that Hussein could pull his army out of Kuwait city 
into the northern portion of the sheikdom, which he said would "put pressure on 
Bush to lift the (trade) embargo" sanctioned by the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, Hussein could hang on, he said, adding: "His advisers may be 
saying to him, 'Time is on our side. Bush may want a war, but he's going to be 
stopped by all sorts of people.' " 
</P>
<P>
* Economically and militarily, there is little that Hussein can do to better 
his position. He has called up every possible reserve, including men in their 
50s who survived the war that the president launched against Iran in 1980, one 
year after consolidating power in Baghdad. The successful trade embargo has 
blocked any chance of large-scale weapons imports, but military analysts credit 
domestic weapons production with war-proven resourcefulness. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the next two months, the embargo is expected to grind at the 
general economy, damaging the transport and industrial sector dependent on 
imported spare parts and raw materials. 
</P>
<P>
A sign of the pain surfaced late last month when Iraq imposed gasoline 
rationing. A week later, the government declared there had been a mistake in 
calculations and fired the oil minister, who had said the lack of imported fuel 
additives was restricting supplies. The unpopular rationing plan was lifted, 
and Hussein's son-in-law was named to replace the minister. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of food imports presents difficulties, but in a regimented society, 
the 17 million Iraqis grumble privately and make the sacrifices demanded by the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
* The key option open to Hussein is to deal. Iraq's pre-invasion demands were 
clear: Hussein wanted full control of the Rumaila oil field it shared with 
Kuwait and possession of two Kuwaiti islands that hinder access to the Persian 
Gulf from the Iraqi port of Umm al Qasr. 
</P>
<P>
Those demands, which many Arab leaders euphemistically term "Iraq's legitimate 
rights," would be central to any deal. 
</P>
<P>
When Arab leaders call for a summit, they are talking about such a deal, not 
about Hussein's grandiose proposals to solve the problems of the entire Middle 
East. The suggestion is that Hussein has a price -- and it is the oil field and 
the islands. 
</P>
<P>
Although such a proposition might be banged out in the name of Arab unity, it 
would mark a political letdown for leaders on both sides of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein would have to give up Kuwait, which he has declared Iraq's 19th 
province. Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf states would not escape the shadow 
of a continuing threat from ambitious Baghdad. Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak, now locked in a feud with the Iraqi strongman, would face an ascendant 
Hussein in the struggle for leadership of the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
Non-Arab Iran, itself eager to control the gulf, would be competing with an 
Iraq with greater access to its waters. Israel, with the only armed forces 
rivaling Baghdad's in the region, would be looking at an Iraqi military with 
its fangs intact. 
</P>
<P>
And the rulers of Kuwait, their state looted of its fabled treasures, could 
only tremble. 
</P>
<P>
Helena Cobban, a scholar at the Foundation for Middle East Peace, a 
Washington-based organization working for Arab-Israeli reconciliation, 
estimated that there is a 60-40 chance that Hussein would withdraw his forces 
in coming months if he sees the military balance as unfavorable. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to still give him a favorable way out -- which doesn't mean we give 
him chunks of Kuwait, but we give him some assurance that we are not going to 
track him down to a bunker in Baghdad," Cobban said. 
</P>
<P>
"If he sees himself surrounded . . . if his regime is going to be dismantled 
anyway, he's going to make sure the U.S. comes down with him."

U.S. BISHOPS CALL ON BUSH TO AVOID WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's Roman Catholic bishops Monday overwhelmingly endorsed a statement 
urging the Bush Administration to avoid war in the Persian Gulf, except as a 
last resort, and to use restraint to prevent civilian casualties if diplomatic 
efforts fail. 
</P>
<P>
In approving the statement drafted by Los Angeles Archbishop Roger M. Mahony by 
a vote of 249 to 15, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops became one of 
the first major U.S. groups to challenge the Bush Administration's policy in 
the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony stressed the "just war" doctrine -- enunciated in pastoral letters by 
the bishops in 1983 and 1986 -- which says that the use of force must be "a 
final and last resort." He added at a news conference, "It would be our 
judgment that today we are not at that moment." 
</P>
<P>
The group also agreed to make the gulf crisis a special focus of its annual 
fall meeting, which opened Monday. However, a move to debate the issue in a 
public session was narrowly headed off by more conservative bishops, who opted 
instead for a closed discussion Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The statement urging the Administration to "stay the course of persistent, 
peaceful and determined pressure against Iraq" was sent by Mahony last week as 
an open letter to Secretary of State James A. Baker III. 
</P>
<P>
It noted the "just war" doctrine and said that if war becomes inevitable, "the 
military means used must be commensurate with the evil to be overcome and must 
be directed at the aggressors, not innocent people." This means that any war 
would have to be limited, the statement said, and it rules out tactics that 
"could clearly target civilian lives." 
</P>
<P>
Any military action should also be sanctioned by international assent and by 
Congress, the statement added. 
</P>
<P>
Presenting the letter for formal approval Monday, Mahony said it was written 
expressly with a view to influencing Administration policy. It was dispatched 
to Baker before Bush's announcement last week of a buildup of forces in the 
gulf -- action that Mahony called "a significant new ingredient" for debate. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony's stated judgment that the gulf crisis does not yet justify military 
force was echoed by Thomas J. Gumbleton, auxiliary bishop of Detroit. "It is 
very clear that the conditions of a 'just war' are not fulfilled in this 
instance," he said during debate. 
</P>
<P>
Gumbleton last week had said he would ask the bishops to sign a statement 
asking Catholic soldiers to become "selective conscientious objectors" and 
actively resist offensive deployment. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony several times noted with approval Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's offer 
for a "deep dialogue." But despite Hussein's call for dialogue Sunday, on 
Monday the Iraqi leader seemed to reject an emergency summit proposed by 
Morocco's King Hassan, saying that talks might be used as a cover for an 
"American-Zionist" attack on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The bishops' agreement to push for further debate -- a move that could result 
in an even stronger statement against U.S. policy in the gulf -- seemed to be 
spearheaded by several of the same bishops who have been most strongly opposed 
to accepting any ethical basis for maintaining a nuclear deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the move were Gumbleton, Bishops Francis T. Hurley of Anchorage, 
Alaska, John F. Kinney of Bismarck, N.D., and Michael H. Kenney of Juneau, 
Alaska. Kenney, in debate, declared himself "appalled" that the Persian Gulf 
crisis was virtually ignored by most candidates in last week's elections. 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston, a more conservative voice, led a countermove to 
keep the discussion off the public agenda of the conference and place it 
instead in Wednesday's closed-door executive session. The proposal barely 
passed by a 126-118 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony, speaking to reporters, made it plain that he voted against Cardinal 
Law's move to close the discussion. He added: "I am going to encourage a public 
statement of some kind which will (help stimulate) public debate before we 
leave here."

MOLINA SAYS SHE'LL RUN AS LATINO UNITY FALTERS; 
</P>
<P>
SUPERVISORS: COUNCILMAN ALATORRE SAYS HE MIGHT OPPOSE FELLOW COUNCIL MEMBER. 
STAGE IS SET FOR A LIVELY BATTLE IN REDRAWN 1ST DISTRICT.

Efforts to choose a consensus Democratic candidate for Los Angeles County 
supervisor from the Latino community seemed to have failed Monday as City 
Councilwoman Gloria Molina announced her candidacy and longtime rival 
Councilman Richard Alatorre, withholding his blessing, said he might enter the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, the development sets the stage for a lively contest between 
Molina and Sarah Flores -- two strong Latina candidates -- who have stepped 
forward in hopes of becoming Los Angeles County's first Latino supervisor this 
century. 
</P>
<P>
Molina emerged as the choice of U.S. Reps. Edward R. Roybal (D-Los Angeles) and 
Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente) to oppose the Republican Flores in a Jan. 22 
election in a new, heavily Latino district carved out by a federal judge in a 
historic voting rights case. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre said Monday that he is considering running for the seat. "I have no 
intention right now of backing anyone else but me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre, who along with state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) was 
conspicuously absent from Molina's press conference, said he withdrew from 
private talks with other Latino politicians last weekend because of concern 
that the behind-the-scenes maneuvering would lead to the kind of racial 
polarization that the voting rights lawsuit sought to remedy. 
</P>
<P>
Filed by civil rights groups and the U.S. Justice Department, the lawsuit 
spurred U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon to rule last summer that county 
supervisors deliberately diluted Latino voting power in drawing district 
boundaries in 1981. As a result, Kenyon redrew all district lines and ordered a 
new election in the realigned 1st District. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe some of my colleagues have lost sight of what we have achieved in 
this lawsuit," Alatorre said. "Some appear to believe that we need only select 
a consensus candidate . . . and that the seat can be collected as an 
entitlement. This is a sure prescription for defeat and continued frustration 
in the Latino community." 
</P>
<P>
Flores, a former aide to Supervisor Pete Schabarum, wasted no time Monday in 
branding her opponent as the choice of "the East Los Angeles bosses" who are 
attempting to turn a nonpartisan race into a partisan affair. Officially, the 
board is nonpartisan. But the five-member board controlled by conservatives has 
followed a party line in making decisions on funding of programs. 
</P>
<P>
"I welcome the challenge," said Flores, who finished first in a June primary in 
the old 1st District, only to see the results thrown out by a judge. "I'm a 
tough lady, too." 
</P>
<P>
During a news conference in Pico Rivera, Roybal and Esteban Torres said they 
agreed to support Molina after Alatorre and Art Torres decided not to attend a 
private meeting Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Three of us, a majority, have come together in agreement," Molina said. "And 
if that is not quite consensus, it is very close to it." Molina said the short 
campaign season -- 10 weeks -- made a speedy decision necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was a follow-up to a Friday session attended by all five Democratic 
politicians. It was designed to prevent a divisive battle in the Latino 
community that could lead to the election of a Republican, possibly even a 
non-Latino, to succeed the retiring Schabarum in the new 1st District. 
</P>
<P>
The new district stretches from El Sereno and Lincoln Heights east to Irwindale 
and La Puente and southeast to Santa Fe Springs. Latinos make up 51% of the 
voters and 71% of the residents. Democrats outnumber Republicans 66% to 23%. 
</P>
<P>
Molina said Monday that she has represented about 30% of the new district in 
her capacities as a councilwoman or assemblywoman. She said she spent the day 
poring over political data and maps with her campaign consultant and started 
calling local officials to seek their endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, 52, said the new district encompasses 25% of the old district, where 
she finished first and which she has represented as a field deputy to Schabarum 
for a number of years. 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre said in an interview that he refused to participate in further talks 
after hearing that Roybal and Esteban Torres had already made up their minds to 
support Molina before Sunday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of a consensus was a good idea," Alatorre said. "I went into it 
objectively and honestly. I didn't feel that others were doing the same." 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre said he also was concerned about the exclusion of other Los Angeles 
County Latino politicians from the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
He also expressed concern that the closed-door meetings would produce a "Latino 
consensus candidate who will enter the campaign with the public perception that 
he or she is seeking office to represent only the Latino community, and with 
little regard for the other 49% of the voters of the 1st District or the 
diverse communities in the balance of the county." 
</P>
<P>
Alatorre, 47, said he is trying to resolve legal questions over whether he can 
run for supervisor without giving up his council seat, which is up for 
reelection in April. He has until Nov. 30 to decide. Molina can run without 
risking her council job because she does not face reelection until 1993. 
</P>
<P>
"It is ironic that Mrs. Molina has always criticized other people for the same 
thing (closed-door meetings)," Alatorre said. "But when it goes in her favor, 
it's OK." 
</P>
<P>
Molina defended the process that led to her candidacy. "The meeting included 
all those interested in running," she said. "Reaching agreement is just plain 
smart, part of a winning strategy." 
</P>
<P>
If Alatorre decides to enter the race, it would not be the first time he has 
tangled with Molina. 
</P>
<P>
Molina, 42, defeated an Alatorre-backed candidate to win election to the City 
Council in 1987. Ironically, she was elected to a seat drawn by the council to 
settle a voting rights lawsuit similar to the one brought against the county 
board. 
</P>
<P>
Raised in Pico Rivera and Montebello, Molina became politically active as a 
student at Rio Hondo Community College. She went to work as an aide to Art 
Torres when he was an assemblyman and then joined President Jimmy Carter's 
Administration as deputy director in San Francisco for the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
She then joined the staff of Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), 
serving as his top Southern California deputy before winning election to the 
Assembly in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Matthew G. Martinez (D-Monterey Park) has also expressed interest in 
running for supervisor. He could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Art Torres also could not be reached, but he has previously said he is not 
interested in running. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors' conservative majority still holds hope that an 
11-member panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals will agree to review the 
redistricting case, again throwing the election into limbo. Failing that, 
supervisors said they will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. If such a review 
is granted, the election could be postponed again.

BLOOD SUPPLY IN MANY POORER NATIONS UNSAFE, EXPERTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The supplies of blood available for medical transfusions in the United States, 
Canada, Australia, Japan and most of Western Europe are extremely safe, thanks 
to increasingly sophisticated screening for AIDS, hepatitis and other 
contagious diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Such screening, however, continues to be largely unavailable in Africa, China, 
the Soviet Union and much of Eastern Europe and the Middle East, resulting in 
blood supplies contaminated with disease. 
</P>
<P>
Those assessments of the world's blood supply were presented by physicians and 
health care professionals in Los Angeles on Monday at the 1990 Joint Congress 
of the International Society of Blood Transfusion and the American Assn. of 
Blood Banks. 
</P>
<P>
Experts said that while blood banks in most Western industrialized nations 
experience only periodic shortfalls in blood and blood products, many of the 
world's poorest and least developed countries continue to suffer from chronic 
shortages of blood, resulting in thousands of deaths every year. 
</P>
<P>
"Blood can never be guaranteed safe," said Dr. Gordon T. Archer of the Red 
Cross Blood Transfusion Service in Sydney, Australia, and president of the 
International Society of Blood Transfusion. "It never has been (100%) safe and 
probably never will be." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Archer said, "in the United States . . . blood is safer today than it ever 
has been before," despite AIDS and AIDS-related viruses and other recently 
discovered communicable diseases. 
</P>
<P>
For every unit of blood transfused in the United States, there is less than a 
1% chance of becoming infected with a serious disease, said Dr. Toby L. Simon, 
executive vice president and chief operating officer of Blood Systems Inc. in 
Scottsdale, Ariz., and president of the American Assn. of Blood Banks. 
</P>
<P>
So safe is the blood supply in the United States, in fact, that two groups of 
scientists concluded in the New England Journal of Medicine this month that, 
even though it is possible to use an additional test to screen donated blood 
for the AIDS virus, it is unnecessary to do so. 
</P>
<P>
According to researchers at UC San Francisco and USC who oversaw those studies, 
the existing test for the AIDS virus in donated blood is so effective that the 
odds of developing AIDS from tainted blood in the United States now runs 
somewhere between 1 in 38,000 and 1 in 153,000, which in medical terms is 
considered a minuscule risk. 
</P>
<P>
The risks of serious infection from blood transfusions are similar in most 
other industrialized countries, but that is certainly not the case in many 
other areas of the world, said Dr. Richard J. Davey, a blood specialist at the 
National Institutes of Health who has been assigned temporarily to the World 
Health Organization in Geneva to study the world's blood supplies. 
</P>
<P>
In parts of the Middle East, Indonesia, Pakistan and India there is little or 
no screening, especially in rural areas, Davey said. As a result, in those 
countries, as well as in China, the Soviet Union and much of Eastern Europe, 
where almost no blood screening is done, the risk of contracting hepatitis and 
in some cases malaria or other contagious diseases from transfusions runs quite 
high. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most contaminated supplies of blood in the world is in Africa, 
largely because of the high incidence of AIDS in that country, Davey said. Of 
the 8 million cases of human immunodeficiency virus infection, which causes 
AIDS, more than 5 million are estimated to be in Sub-Saharan Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Between 65% and 70% of the 2 million transfusions given each year in Africa 
rely on blood that has not been tested. That rate is actually somewhat better 
than it has been in the past. "It is an improvement," Davey said, but it is 
still not anywhere near what it should be. 
</P>
<P>
One of the blood-testing problems facing many countries is outdated equipment. 
</P>
<P>
In Eastern Europe, for example, blood is not collected in disposable containers 
as it is in the United States, but in glass bottles, which "haven't been used 
in the U.S. since the 1950s," Davey said. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem in screening blood for disease is the cost of running the 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
Blood screening runs between $5 and $10 per test, accounting for as much as 
half the total costs of blood transfusions. In the United States, there are now 
seven separate tests run on every unit of blood. The tests are designed to 
detect syphilis; hepatitis B; HIV, HTLV I and II (AIDS-related viruses), 
hepatitis C and and non-A and non-B hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
Some American health advocates contend that there is a need for other tests as 
well. For example, it is thought that Lyme disease, a debilitating inflammatory 
joint disorder transmitted by ticks, might also be transmitted through blood, 
although there have been no confirmed transmissions through donated blood. 
</P>
<P>
Of particular concern to health officials in New York and Los Angeles is 
Chaqas' disease, a major cause of heart and bowel disease in Central and South 
America. The disease, named for a Brazilian physician, is caused by a parasite 
that is normally spread by the reduviid bug (also known as the assassin or 
kissing bug). But in at least two documented cases cancer patients in the 
United States have gotten the disease from transfusions, leading some health 
officials to believe it may be time to begin screening for the disease, 
particularly in parts of the country where there have been huge influxes of 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Most experts, however, urge caution, saying the incidence of the disease is not 
yet large enough -- and indeed may never become large enough -- to warrant the 
imposition of a Chaqas test.

HISTORIAN TELLS TALES OF MOJAVE WATERWAY

Clifford J. Walker is a historian and an expert on a river many think is a myth 
-- the 150-mile Mojave River, one of the longest and largest underground rivers 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people don't believe there is a Mojave River. They see the dry bed 
not realizing that beneath it flows a wide, wide river," said Walker, 60, who 
teaches a course on the history of the Mojave Desert at Barstow Community 
College. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote the 352-page book "Back Door to California: The Story of the Mojave 
River Trail," published in 1986 by the Mojave River Valley Museum Assn. It 
tells the story of the river and its importance from prehistoric time to the 
turn of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Walker is head of the association that owns and operates the Mojave River 
Valley Museum in Barstow. He has been teaching English and history at Barstow 
High School for 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
East of town, Walker looked across the dry river bed where it is a mile wide 
with 20-foot-high walls of sand on each bank. 
</P>
<P>
"During the floods of 1938 this was full of cascading water, shoreline to 
shoreline. Downstream in Baker, people were rescued in rowboats. This happens 
during years of heavy rains in what most people think of as the bone-dry Mojave 
Desert. Sounds incredible, doesn't it?" said Walker. 
</P>
<P>
The river's headwaters are in the San Bernardino Mountains near Cajon Pass. It 
ends at the Mojave Sink or Soda Dry Lake at Baker. During the Ice Age, it 
continued on into Death Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"Down through the centuries the river was a prime source of water for Indians. 
The river runs above ground in a few places. In past years, it surfaced in many 
more places than it does today. It flowed above ground for a short distance in 
Barstow until a few years ago," said Walker. 
</P>
<P>
Indian campsites are still evident along the river, where Indian paintings and 
carvings can be seen on nearby rock outcroppings. 
</P>
<P>
At Oro Grande, footprints of a group of adults and children walking across the 
muddy banks of the Mojave were frozen in time when covered with lava. 
Scientists have dated the footprints to be 5,120 years old, reported Walker in 
his book. 
</P>
<P>
Walker leads museum and classroom field trips to historic places along the 
river. Near Yermo, he shows the site where the skeleton of a headless horseman 
collapsed on the remains of a horse was found in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
"A battle between horse thieves and ranchers happened at that location in the 
1840s. It's believed the remains were of a young man killed in the skirmish. 
But why his head is missing is a mystery," said the historian. 
</P>
<P>
Not far from where the headless horseman was uncovered are ruts made by 
hundreds of wagons crossing the desert on the old Mojave River Trail along the 
dry riverbed. The trail was used by wagon trains from 1848 until the late 
1800s. 
</P>
<P>
"Jefferson Hunt was the first to use wagons on an old mule trail that spanned 
the desert. He led 100 wagons from Salt Lake City to Las Vegas, then across the 
Mojave Desert to Southern California, charging $10 a wagon for his services," 
said Walker. 
</P>
<P>
Remains of prehistoric animals have been found all along the shores of the 
Mojave River: saber-toothed cats, mammoths, wolves, sloths, four kinds of 
camels and two kinds of horses -- one the size of a fox terrier, said Walker. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't look like much on the surface, but the Mojave River is a very 
exciting river that played a key role in settling Southern California," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"During Prohibition, several bootleggers had stills tapping the crystal clear 
underground waters of the Mojave River, distilling their illegal products in 
this out-of-the-way place for sale in the Los Angeles area." 
</P>
<P>
Walker's next book will be the story of Prohibition in California.

JUDGE ORDERS ABSENTEE VOTE COUNT HALTED; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: WITH NARROW LEAD FADING, DEMOCRATIC ATTORNEY GENERAL CANDIDATE ARLO 
SMITH CHALLENGES THE METHOD OF BALLOT TABULATION IN ORANGE COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As Democrat Arlo Smith's lead faded Monday in the bitterly fought race for 
state attorney general with Republican Dan Lungren, Smith campaign attorneys 
were mounting a legal challenge in Orange County concerning the way absentee 
ballots are being tabulated. 
</P>
<P>
In the first major update of the absentee ballot count since last Tuesday's 
election, former five-term congressman Lungren picked up 5,904 votes on Smith 
in Los Angeles County, the county registrar's office announced. 
</P>
<P>
Until Monday, Smith, the San Francisco district attorney, had led Lungren by 
28,836 votes statewide with up to 500,000 absentee ballots remaining to be 
counted. A statewide update of absentee votes -- which tend to tilt toward the 
Republican Party -- is scheduled to be released by the secretary of state's 
office today. 
</P>
<P>
The Smith camp, which has raised the possibility of absentee-vote fraud, is 
moving to legally challenge the tabulation of absentee votes. The first step 
was asking that the vote count be stopped in Orange County; court actions 
elsewhere in the state are being considered. 
</P>
<P>
After an unusual weekend hearing in Orange County, Superior Court Judge James 
Smith ordered Orange County Registrar of Voters Donald Tanney to cease counting 
absentees pending a hearing on the issue Wednesday, unless Tanney alters his 
tabulating methods. 
</P>
<P>
Citing scattered reports across the state, the Smith camp has charged that GOP 
workers may have illegally submitted absentee ballot applications on behalf of 
an undetermined number of voters by forging signatures. The state election code 
requires that voters apply for their own absentee ballots. Smith is alleging 
that many voters who otherwise properly cast absentees did not apply for the 
ballots themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Smith campaign attorneys are demanding that Tanney and other registrars not 
count absentees until they compare signatures on ballot applications with those 
on completed ballots. 
</P>
<P>
County registrars throughout the state have been comparing the signatures on 
completed ballots with those on voters' original affidavits of registration. 
</P>
<P>
Until Wednesday's hearing, Smith said, Tanney could begin his count anew only 
if he checked all three signatures -- those on the registration affidavits, the 
ballot applications and the ballots themselves -- to ensure that voters applied 
for their own absentee ballots. But Tanney, calling the method unnecessary and 
wasteful, said he would not proceed until after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"My position is that what we're doing is fine and I want to fight that one 
out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Approximately 50,000 absentee ballots remain unopened in heavily Republican 
Orange County -- enough to possibly swing the election in Lungren's favor. 
</P>
<P>
But GOP officials said Lungren may pick up more than enough votes elsewhere in 
the state today to surpass Smith even without Orange County reporting. In Los 
Angeles, where more than 60,000 absentees are still uncounted, Lungren's 
5,904-vote gain came out of 77,000 votes counted since Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Terming Lungren's gain in Los Angeles County "great," campaign spokesman Dave 
Puglia said, "We're confident we're going to win this." 
</P>
<P>
Smith campaign manager Marc Dann said, "I would have rather it had been us 
gaining votes in Los Angeles County . . . but it (still) looks like it's going 
to be very close." 
</P>
<P>
Dann added that additional court cases may be filed in other counties today. 
"If it's close," he said, "Arlo will exercise his rights to the full extent of 
the law." 
</P>
<P>
State Republican Party officials reacted with disdain to Smith's legal 
maneuverings. 
</P>
<P>
"He ought to stop being a crybaby," state GOP Chairman Frank Visco said at a 
Burbank press conference. "To spend public money on a redundant type of an 
activity . . . is ludicrous . . . and is stalling the process." 
</P>
<P>
Visco said the Republican Party -- which mailed more than 6.5 million absentee 
ballot applications to GOP households -- strictly cautioned its workers not to 
sign any absentee applications on behalf of voters. 
</P>
<P>
"They're taking some isolated situations and blowing so much smoke," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Countered Dann: "Look, if Visco had nothing to hide, he'd encourage the Orange 
County Board of Supervisors to tell the registrar to compare the (signatures). 
. . . Why they just won't do that . . . I don't understand." 
</P>
<P>
Dann said the Smith campaign received numerous reports of voters arriving at 
the polls to find that they had already been sent absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Tanney, however, said such incidents occur sporadically and this year is no 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
Even if some absentee ballots were applied for illegally, the registrar said, 
ballots ultimately cast by voters to whom they were issued should be counted. 
</P>
<P>
"The intent of the law is to encourage people to participate in the election," 
Tanney said. "Why would you disenfranchise the voter who in good faith voted? . 
. . If I have a sealed ballot with the signature of the voter, as far as I am 
concerned that is a valid ballot and deserves to be counted."

YELTSIN HOPEFUL OF KEY ACCORD WITH GORBACHEV; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO MEN ON SHARING NATURAL RESOURCES 
WOULD HELP LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR ECONOMIC REFORMS. 
</P>

<P>
After months of bitter wrangling, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his 
principal rival, Boris N. Yeltsin, the president of the Russian Federation, may 
be near a crucial agreement on how to share the country's natural resources and 
industrial base, Yeltsin said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
That agreement, if concluded soon, would help lay the foundation for economic 
reforms and for a new treaty among the Soviet Union's constituent republics, 
including Russia, the largest, on the country's future as a federal state. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, speaking after a weekend meeting with Gorbachev, said that, for the 
first time, the central government has agreed to initially negotiate the key 
issues of how to share the country's vast wealth and to manage its economy -- 
and only then to tackle how to restructure the Soviet Union and realign 
relations among the republics and between them and Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"We experienced pressure until yesterday (Sunday)," Yeltsin told a commission 
drafting a new Russian constitution. "That pressure was aimed at making us sign 
a union treaty first and settle all other issues later. . . . We could not 
accept that, and we won't." 
</P>
<P>
But he and Gorbachev had agreed, first in two hours of one-on-one talks and 
then in another three hours of talks with their prime ministers, that parallel 
Soviet and Russian commissions would be established to settle the division of 
powers between the central and republic governments, the ownership of 
industrial enterprises and the use of natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
The commissions would also discuss changes in the banking system, state 
finances and economic management. They would then work together on drafting the 
new union treaty, which Yeltsin said could be ready by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"The document delimiting functions (of the central and Russian governments) 
will serve as the basis for the federal treaty," Yeltsin said. 
</P>
<P>
But no treaty would be signed before there were also agreements on sharing of 
natural resources -- including oil, natural gas and gold -- and on management 
of the banking system and financing of the central budget. 
</P>
<P>
As outlined by Yeltsin, the understanding reached with Gorbachev could help end 
the prolonged impasse exacerbating the country's triple crisis: economic 
disintegration virtually unchecked by any reforms; breakup of the Soviet Union 
as a centralized state, and the inability of the present political situation to 
resolve these and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has not commented on his discussions Sunday with Yeltsin, but it was 
he who approached the Russian populist after a political meeting last week and 
proposed the Kremlin talks. 
</P>
<P>
The official Soviet news agency Tass described the talks between the two men as 
"businesslike and principled." 
</P>
<P>
Although much negotiation lies ahead, Gorbachev appears to have made 
significant concessions in agreeing that the constituent republics can work out 
in advance the terms on which they remain in Soviet Union and in recognizing 
that they have a right, which takes precedence over the claims of the central 
government, to the resources and enterprises on their territory. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, in return, committed himself and Russia to the Soviet Union and 
against its breakup. "I am for a strong union and union treaty," Yeltsin said 
Monday, denying suggestions made in the conservative press that he was 
attempting to dismantle the Soviet Union even at the risk of civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Whether this will end the feuding between Gorbachev and Yeltsin is uncertain, 
but the two appear to understand that they need each other. "The two leaders 
seem to be 'doomed' to cooperation, irrespective of their personal likes and 
dislikes and their political rivalry," a political analyst for Tass wrote 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
An alliance formed in early August collapsed last month amid angry 
recriminations after Gorbachev refused to proceed with radical economic reforms 
as agreed to with Yeltsin, who strongly favored a 500-day "forced march" to 
develop a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
But Yeltsin found that Russia could not proceed alone or carry out even modest 
economic reforms without resolving what the central government owns and what 
belongs to the republic as well as without agreeing about whose laws take 
precedence. 
</P>
<P>
"A clear-cut distribution of powers between the center and the republics, above 
all Russia, would be the first step toward eliminating the vacuum of power at 
various levels," Tass commentator Andrei Orlov wrote. "It would help remove the 
dangerous uncertain in relations with other countries and give a fresh impetus 
to economic reforms."

PRI CLAIMS VICTORY IN MEXICO ELECTIONS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party on Monday claimed an "undeniable" 
victory in the vast majority of the 121 municipal elections in the State of 
Mexico, while both major opposition parties stepped up their charges of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Leftist leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas in a press conference accused the government 
of stealing the election and called for it to be annulled. 
</P>
<P>
Official results from Sunday's vote for mayors and a state legislature are not 
due until Wednesday. But the ruling party, known as the PRI, released 
unofficial figures conceding in only three of the municipalities. Results were 
unavailable for a few towns. 
</P>
<P>
"In at least 80% of the races, the triumph for our party is undeniable," 
national PRI representative Juan Maldonado Pereda told reporters in the state 
capital of Toluca. 
</P>
<P>
One of the victories claimed by PRI officials came in Naucalpan, the nation's 
wealthiest municipality. Their partial figures show the PRI with a 2-to-1 lead 
over the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
But leaders of the conservative National Action Party, or PAN, say their 
numbers indicate the vote is too close to call based on partial results, and an 
independent pollster said his exit poll showed that the PRI and PAN were 
virtually tied in Naucalpan. 
</P>
<P>
"Only the full vote count can tell us who actually won," said pollster Miguel 
Basanez, a former state attorney general. He said election officials evicted 
his surveyors from polling places in other areas of the state. 
</P>
<P>
Astolso Vicencio, a PAN federal deputy from Mexico, accused the PRI of 
election-day fraud. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a large number of problems in Naucalpan because the PRI wanted to 
win at any cost," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Vicencio and Cardenas charged that the government stole ballot boxes, 
expelled their parties' observers from polling places, allowed people to vote 
without credentials and forced some to vote for the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
"In general, the worst vice was the carousel voting -- taking people from poll 
to poll with false credentials to vote several times," Vicencio said. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico, the country's most populated and industrialized state, surrounds Mexico 
City. The Mexico election is being viewed as a test of the government's 
commitment to fair elections and as a preview to the 1991 national vote for the 
federal Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico was one of five states won by Cardenas' Democratic Revolutionary Party 
in the 1988 presidential vote. A high abstention rate in Sunday's election 
appears to have hurt the opposition and helped the PRI, which has an 
experienced party machine and more resources. 
</P>
<P>
The PRI results recognize victories for National Action in the towns of 
Cuautitlan and San Martin de las Piramides. 
</P>
<P>
The official party also recognized a victory for Cardenas' party in Cocotitlan.

2 RIGHT-WINGERS FACE RUNOFF IN GUATEMALA;

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A right-wing businessman and a former leader in one of Guatemala's bloodiest 
regimes who has strong roots in the nation's large evangelical movement emerged 
Monday as the candidates to be president in January after a first round of 
voting failed to select a majority winner. 
</P>
<P>
With 76% of the votes counted from Sunday's balloting, the two leading 
candidates were Jorge Carpio Nicolle of the National Centrist Union, the 
pre-election favorite, with 25.33%, and Jorge Serrano Elias of the Solidarity 
Action Movement, with 25.03%. Ten other candidates shared the remaining bvotes. 
</P>
<P>
The two front-runners, who have no basic differences on dealing with human 
rights abuses and economic inequities and who are both acceptable to 
Guatemala's still-dominant military, will run again Jan. 6. The winner will 
succeed Christian Democrat Vinico Cerezo Arevalo, who was ineligible to run 
again. It will be Guatemala's first transfer of power from one elected 
government to another. 
</P>
<P>
Carpio, a conservative 48-year-old newspaper owner, has suffered from a 
reputation as a lackluster candidate; one of his major supporters once 
described him as having "the charisma of a baked potato." And he has faced 
opposition from other members of the business elite who say his moderation on 
some social policies betrays his economic stance. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Serrano, the evangelical and onetime chief assistant to Gen. Efrian 
Rios Montt, the former dictator, who was a major surprise. He had been expected 
to finish no better than third. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, an unexpected combination of factors put him in the runoff, 
including the significant support he gained from backers of Rios Montt, who was 
disqualified from running for president earlier this year because he had gained 
power in a 1982 coup. 
</P>
<P>
Serrano, a 45-year-old Stanford University engineering graduate with a 
hard-line conservative economic view, had served as head of Rios Montt's 
Council of State and was an outspoken supporter of the general's bloody policy 
of repression. And he has tacitly echoed Rios Montt's campaign pledge that he 
would use similar tactics to deal with Guatemala's high crime rate and social 
disarray. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, many experts say they think Serrano also has greatly 
benefited from the support of the 35% of the country belonging to the 
evangelical movement, although he played down religion as a public issue. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, both candidates immediately began looking for alliances among the 
losing parties, with Serrano playing to the third-place finisher, right-wing 
businessman Alvaro Arzu, who has a personal and political bone to pick with 
Carpio, and the remnants of the outgoing Christian Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Carpio is expected to try to pick up Christian Democratic support as well and 
to obtain the backing of the country's large but apolitical Indian population. 
</P>
<P>
But neither Carpio nor Serrano has a truly distinctive program, particularly on 
the most serious issues facing Guatemala: one of the world's worst human rights 
problems and a rotted economy marked by a nearly singularly unbalanced 
distribution of wealth. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, neither candidate has proposed fundamental changes in what is one of 
the most unbalanced economic systems in Central America -- one that has left 
more than half the country underemployed or unemployed. According to the World 
Bank, only 13% of Guatemala's 9 million inhabitants live above the poverty 
line, and illiteracy stands at 67%. 
</P>
<P>
None of this is likely to change as a result of Sunday's elections. In a recent 
interview with the New York Review of Books, Edmond Mulet, a Carpio supporter, 
said: "Nobody in Guatemala dares to mention the idea of redistributing wealth. 
Everybody knows it should be done. . . . But if you say it too loudly, you 
scare the (large landowners) and the army. The gap between rich and poor 
remains."

Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said in published remarks that Egyptian troops 
would not enter Iraq but could move into Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. Mubarak also 
said he had told Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein that he would help arrange for 
Arab troops to separate Iraq and Kuwait and offered to mediate an Iraqi 
withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the nation's Roman Catholic bishops said any war should be 
limited to avoid civilian casualties and urged diplomacy as an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Agriculture Department said its toll-free hot line is doing a 
brisk business handing out tips on what kind of treats are best to send troops 
in the Persian Gulf. The number is 1-800-535-4555. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic Front: 
</P>
<P>
Morocco's call for an Arab summit on the Persian Gulf crisis received limited 
backing. Among those expressing support for the effort: Jordan, Mauritania, the 
Palestinian Liberation Organization and China. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of the European Community urged their counterparts from five 
Arab countries to use any influence they have with Iraq to urge the 
unconditional release of hostages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Front: 
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress expressed increasing concern over the military buildup in 
the Persian Gulf. "If George Bush wants his presidency to die in the Arabian 
desert, he's going at it very steadily," Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's spokesman quickly retorted, "Not a shot's been fired. What are these 
guys talking about?" He also said that while the White House will work closely 
with Congress, it might be forced to order military action without 
congressional approval in the event of "unforeseen kinds of provocations." 
</P>
<P>
In Germany, analysts predicted that the fate of German hostages held in Iraq 
could become a major issue in the first all-German elections Dec. 2.

Iraq ordered a British diplomat Monday to leave Baghdad within 10 days for 
using "inappropriate language" to demonstrators outside the British mission, 
prompting London to retaliate by expelling an Iraqi diplomat, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said Iraq accused James Tansley, the second secretary at 
London's mission in Baghdad, of making derogatory remarks about Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein while addressing a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Office said that, on Friday, Tansley was given 10 days to leave 
Iraq. In response, Britain has given a second secretary at the Iraqi Embassy 10 
days to leave Britain, it added. 
</P>
<P>
Britain, one of Hussein's strongest critics, has sent thousands of troops to 
join the U.S.-led multinational force confronting Iraq in the Persian Gulf 
area.

CNN AGREES TO LIMITS ON NORIEGA TAPES

Manuel A. Noriega and Cable News Network agreed Monday to postpone their 
constitutional showdown over taped conversations until the U.S. Supreme Court 
rules on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Under the deal worked out in federal court, CNN must refrain from playing any 
tapes of talks between the imprisoned former Panamanian leader and his 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
In return, Noriega's defense delayed a request for contempt penalties of up to 
$300,000 per broadcast against the network. U.S. District Judge William M. 
Hoeveler also delayed his order demanding that CNN hand over seven disputed 
tapes to the court. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is to keep Gen. Noriega from being denied a fair trial," defense 
attorney Jon May said. "I'm not here to squeeze blood out of CNN." 
</P>
<P>
He said suspending the contempt proceedings will allow the Supreme Court to 
focus on the broader constitutional question balancing protections of the 
attorney-client privilege and freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's attorneys on Saturday had asked the judge to find CNN in contempt 
after the network defied his court order and televised a contested tape. 
</P>
<P>
CNN attorney Terry Bienstock said the network accepted the deal, but had the 
right to play other Noriega tapes as long as they did not include conversations 
with his attorneys. The judge agreed. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta-based network is expected to file its appeal to the Supreme Court 
later in the week, a CNN spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"We agreed that CNN would not air, pending Supreme Court review, any 
attorney-client conversations that it has in its possession," Bienstock said. 
"We just want the issues to be narrowly and properly framed before the Supreme 
Court." 
</P>
<P>
May said Monday's deal stops the clock on the contempt penalties, but does not 
prevent the defense from later asking for fines against CNN. 
</P>
<P>
Although attention has focused on the media, May said there are also other 
potential parties to the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a whole bunch of people in the U.S. who may have these tapes, 
including the State Department and the CIA," he said. Lead Noriega attorney 
Frank A. Rubino has said the tapes were leaked to CNN by a Panamanian official 
who received them from the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
A newspaper in Panama City reported Monday that Panamanian Atty. Gen. Rogelio 
Cruz will ask the United States for copies of the tape-recorded Noriega 
telephone conversations. 
</P>
<P>
It said Cruz is convinced that the tapes would prove Noriega's involvement in 
criminal activities inside Panama after the Dec. 20 U.S. military invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Rubino has said he expects to ask for dismissal of all charges against Noriega 
based on government misconduct in recording the calls. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from Colombia's Medellin 
cocaine cartel.

The Air Force would not divulge the nature of the payload, but civilian experts

LOW WATER PRESSURE AT FIRE BLAMED ON OVERTAXED SYSTEM

<P>
Fire investigators said Monday that one of nine hydrants in a luxury Thousand 
Oaks apartment complex ravaged by fire over the weekend had been partially 
turned off -- a violation of the county fire code. 
</P>
<P>
Fire codes require hydrants to be working when structures are in the framing 
stage, as were 18 of the 25 apartment buildings destroyed Saturday at The 
Knolls complex on Avenida de los Arboles, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire investigator David Chovanec said it has not been determined who turned off 
the hydrant. 
</P>
<P>
However, Chovanec said that it is common for contractors or subcontractors to 
shut off a hydrant briefly while plumbing work is being done. 
</P>
<P>
The hydrant was reactivated by an official from the Thousand Oaks utilities 
department about 5 p.m. Saturday, two hours after the fire started, said 
Assistant Chief Jim Smith of the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
However, Smith said that the hydrant was not close to the fire and was never 
used to battle the blaze Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials originally complained that the water supply was inadequate, 
believing several hydrants might have been turned off. Instead, they said 
Monday, it had been determined that the low water pressure they experienced 
Saturday was caused by their own firefighting efforts, which overwhelmed the 
system, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that because the fire struck unstuccoed, wood-frame structures it 
spread more quickly and buildings were less flame-resistant than if they had 
been completed. Consequently, firefighters needed more water more quickly.

PHONE FIRMS PLAN NEW AREA CODE; 
</P>
<P>
COMMUNICATIONS: RAPID GROWTH IN ORANGE COUNTY, INLAND EMPIRE DICTATES DECISION 
TO SPLIT THE 714 ZONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Faced with a shortage of phone numbers because of rapid growth in Orange County 
and the Inland Empire, GTE and Pacific Bell officials have decided to carve a 
new area code out of the existing 714 area, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Phone company officials said they will announce today who among the region's 
4.7 million customers will be affected by the split when it takes effect in 
January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike past area code changes in the state, this one has a twist: 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the phone companies will offer three proposed boundaries 
for the new area code and allow time for public response to help decide how the 
boundaries will look, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to gather from our customers input as to where they would like to 
see the boundaries for the new configuration set up," said GTE California 
spokesman Larry Cox. 
</P>
<P>
The new review system is dictated by legislation sponsored by state 
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) and signed into law in July. The 
public hearings on the three proposals are to be held Nov. 26-30 in Orange 
County and the Inland Empire. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the proposals are made public, there were some grumblings of 
opposition Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Told about splitting the 714 area code, Orange County Chamber of Commerce 
President Lucien D. Truehill predicted "a lot of resistance if they split this 
county up into different area codes. This is a dramatic change and it's going 
to be a shock to the business community. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to require a lot of changes for business just as far as stationery 
and things like that. But more than that, there's the danger of the region 
losing its identity when you break up the area code like that," he said.

O.C. ABSENTEE BALLOT COUNT ORDERED HALTED; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: A JUDGE ACTS AFTER ARLO SMITH, DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR ATTORNEY 
GENERAL, CHALLENGES THE PROCEDURE. 
</P>

<P>
As Democrat Arlo Smith's lead faded Monday in the bitterly fought race for 
state attorney general with Republican Dan Lungren, Smith campaign attorneys 
were mounting a legal challenge in Orange County concerning the way absentee 
ballots are being tabulated. 
</P>
<P>
In the first major update of the absentee ballot count since last Tuesday's 
election, former five-term Congressman Lungren picked up 5,904 votes on Smith 
in Los Angeles County, the county registrar's office announced. 
</P>
<P>
Until Monday, Smith, the San Francisco district attorney, had led Lungren by 
28,836 votes statewide with up to 500,000 absentee ballots remaining to be 
counted. A statewide update of absentee votes -- which tend to tilt toward the 
Republican Party -- is scheduled to be released by the secretary of state's 
office today. 
</P>
<P>
The Smith camp, which has raised the possibility of absentee-vote fraud, is 
moving to legally challenge the tabulation of absentee votes. The first step 
was their asking that the vote count be stopped in Orange County, where Lungren 
was leading by a 2-1 margin in semiofficial returns and where about 50,000 
absentee ballots remain unopened, enough to possibly swing the election in 
Lungren's favor. 
</P>
<P>
Court actions elsewhere in the state are being considered. 
</P>
<P>
After an unusual weekend hearing in Orange County, Superior Court Judge James 
Smith ordered Orange County Registrar of Voters Donald F. Tanney to cease 
counting absentees pending a hearing on the issue Wednesday unless Tanney 
alters his tabulating methods. 
</P>
<P>
Tanney said his staff would have begun tabulating the ballots Sunday afternoon 
and could have issued an updated report today. But the judge's order has 
temporarily frozen results in Orange County, leaving not just the race for 
attorney general up in the air, but also city council races in Anaheim and 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Citing scattered reports across the state, the Smith camp has charged that GOP 
workers may have illegally submitted absentee ballot applications on behalf of 
an undetermined number of voters by forging signatures. The state election code 
requires that voters apply for their own absentee ballots. Smith is alleging 
that many voters who otherwise properly cast absentees did not apply for the 
ballots themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Smith campaign attorneys are demanding that Tanney and other registrars not 
count absentees until they compare signatures on ballot applications with those 
on completed ballots. 
</P>
<P>
County registrars throughout the state have been comparing the signatures on 
completed ballots with those on voters' original affidavits of registration. 
</P>
<P>
Until Wednesday's hearing, Smith said, Tanney could begin his count anew only 
if he checked all three signatures -- those on the registration affidavits, the 
ballot applications and the ballots themselves -- to ensure that voters applied 
for their own absentee ballots. But Tanney, calling the method unnecessary and 
wasteful, said he would not proceed until after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"My position is that what we're doing is fine, and I want to fight that one 
out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Dann, Smith's campaign manager, said: "Those are illegal votes. . . . The 
GOP saw a loophole, they knew . . . Orange County never checks applications." 
</P>
<P>
But GOP officials said Lungren may pick up more than enough votes elsewhere in 
the state today to surpass Smith even without Orange County's reporting. In Los 
Angeles, where more than 60,000 absentees are still uncounted, Lungren's 
5,904-vote gain came out of 77,000 votes counted since Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Terming Lungren's gain in Los Angeles County "great," campaign spokesman Dave 
Puglia said, "We're confident we're going to win this."

Dann said: "I would have rather it had been us gaining votes in Los Angeles 
County . . . but it (still) looks like it's going to be very close." 
</P>
<P>
Dann added that additional court cases may be filed in other counties today. 
"If it's close," he said, "Arlo will exercise his rights to the full extent of 
the law." 
</P>
<P>
State Republican Party officials reacted with disdain toward Smith's legal 
maneuverings. 
</P>
<P>
"He ought to stop being a crybaby," state GOP Chairman Frank Visco said at a 
Burbank press conference. "To spend public money on a redundant type of an 
activity . . . is ludicrous . . . and is stalling the process." 
</P>
<P>
Visco said the Republican Party -- which mailed more than 6.5 million absentee 
ballot applications to GOP households -- strictly cautioned its workers not to 
sign any absentee applications on behalf of voters. 
</P>
<P>
"They're taking some isolated situations and blowing so much smoke," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Countered Dann: "Look, if Visco had nothing to hide, he'd encourage the Orange 
County Board of Supervisors to tell the registrar to compare the (signatures). 
. . . Why they just won't do that . . . I don't understand." 
</P>
<P>
Dann said the Smith campaign received numerous reports of voters arriving at 
the polls to find that they had already been sent absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Tanney, however, said such incidents occur sporadically and this year is no 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
Even if some absentee ballots were applied for illegally, the registrar said, 
ballots ultimately cast by voters to whom they were issued should be counted. 
</P>
<P>
"The intent of the law is to encourage people to participate in the election," 
Tanney said. "Why would you disenfranchise the voter who in good faith voted? . 
. . If I have a sealed ballot with the signature of the voter, as far as I am 
concerned that is a valid ballot and deserves to be counted."

CROWD JAMS KNOTT'S FOR A PARK FREEBIE;

<TEXT>
<P>
Knott's Berry Farm officials got more than they bargained for Monday when they 
offered free Veterans Day admission to active and retired military service 
people and their families. 
</P>
<P>
So many people showed up for the freebie that the amusement park had to turn 
away visitors at 1 p.m. The California Highway Patrol issued an alert advising 
motorists to avoid Beach Boulevard because of the thousands of cars jamming 
city streets en route to the park. And, amusement park secretaries found 
themselves flipping burgers to help out besieged cooks at food stands. 
</P>
<P>
The free admission was apparently broadcast at all Southern California military 
commands and advertised in local newspapers. As a result, all seven parking 
lots were full by early afternoon, forcing park officials to declare the event 
a sellout. 
</P>
<P>
"It was certainly greater than we expected. This would be comparable to a 
Saturday during the summer," said park spokesman Stuart Zanville. "It was a 
gratifying response to our invitation." 
</P>
<P>
Park officials have extended the offer through Saturday, allowing families who 
were turned away to return any time between now and then. However, for some 
such as Edward and Bridgett Goins, who made the trip from San Diego with their 
two young children, a rain check wasn't quite good enough. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to plan trips like this, we can't just come," said Edward Goins, 26, a 
staff sergeant at Edwards Air Force Base. "It took us a long time to get here." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the gates, there were long lines to get on most rides. But for those who 
had gotten in free, there was nothing but praise for the amusement park's 
patriotic gesture. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was really nice that they did that," said Michelle Nelson, 24, who 
came with her husband and two children from March Air Force Base in Riverside. 
"It really inspires the guys and the girls in the military to see that people 
care." 
</P>
<P>
Admission usually costs $21 for adults, $17 for children 3 to 11 and $15 for 
expectant mothers, seniors and disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
For families of four like the Luteses of Bellflower, it was quite a bargain. 
"We would normally have paid $56 plus," said Cathy Lutes. "I thank them very 
much for doing this." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the crowds, Knott's officials extended park hours until 8 p.m., two 
hours past the normal closing time. Although the park refused to disclose 
attendance figures for the day, fire officials estimated maximum park capacity 
at about 20,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
The free admission was originally intended only for the relatives of service 
people serving in the Persian Gulf. But in honor of Veterans Day, Knott's 
officials decided to admit free anyone who is currently serving in the 
military, or retired, and their children ages 3 to 11. 
</P>
<P>
After this year's experience, will they repeat the offer? 
</P>
<P>
"We'll review it when the time comes," said park spokesman Bob Deuel. "But this 
was kind of an unusual set of circumstances."

ENVIRONMENT: KARLIN MARSH KNOWS ABOUT THE POLITICAL REALITIES OF LAND-USE. BUT 
THAT HASN'T STIFLED HER VOICE ON SOME ISSUES.

<P>
Back when she wrote a series of textbooks for the then-new course of 
environmental studies for Orange County's public schools, biologist Karlin 
Marsh included a few chapters on community activism. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years later, she says, those chapters seem a little naive. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned a lot in the intervening years," Marsh, 52, said wryly. "I've 
learned a lot about science and I've learned a lot about politics." 
</P>
<P>
For Marsh, a self-described "farm girl," those lessons have come from more than 
a dozen years of work in the environmental trenches, working as a consultant to 
some of the county's major developers and, more recently, to public agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh's down-home bluntness occasionally has thrust her into the center of 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, for example, Marsh and two other biologists warned in a report that 
a proposed 2,500-home development on the edge of O'Neill Regional Park would 
jeopardize one of Southern California's richest natural habitats unless it were 
moved several hundred feet farther from the park. 
</P>
<P>
County land planners commissioned the report at a cost of $8,000 but never 
formally presented it to the Planning Commission. A few weeks after the report 
became public, the commission, upon the recommendation of its staff, approved 
the proposed Las Flores Planned Community by a 5-0 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners cited the county's overriding need for more affordable housing 
and the Santa Margarita Co.'s pledge that 60% of the homes would sell for less 
than $250,000, the average cost of a new house in the county. Santa Margarita 
Co. executives had dismissed Marsh's report, noting that she had previously 
gone on record against the project. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh, a widely respected biologist who has worked as a consultant since the 
late 1970s, previously declined comment on the Las Flores project. But she 
discussed herreport and the county's response during an interview Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh, softly graying and given to folksy metaphors, said she was "disappointed 
for the critters" in O'Neill Regional Park but was not surprised by the 
commission's approval of the project. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a whole lot more energy and time and -- sometimes -- money to make a 
difference in this county than I ever conceived of in the mid-'70s," Marsh 
said. "It's not easy for Joe Blow on Elm Street to make a difference anymore or 
even for very well organized environmental groups to make a difference. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I think Las Flores was a good example. Here you had some of the best field 
biologists in the area saying, 'Hey, there (are) problems here that need to be 
considered.' " 
</P>
<P>
The project still needs to be approved by the Board of Supervisors, which is 
scheduled to take up the proposal at its Dec. 5 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh, who says she practices what she preaches, works out of her home, made of 
natural wood siding and set down into the hillside at the end of an unmarked 
dirt road in Silverado Canyon. Her office, at the top of her three-story home, 
rests above a canopy of oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
A creek with tiny rainbow trout gurgles about 100 feet from the house. From her 
window, she's far more likely to spot a chickadee than a fellow human. Her 
husband, Gordon Marsh, curator of UC Irvine's Museum of Systematic Biology, 
shares her love of nature and is likely to be seen roaming the grounds of their 
home in the late afternoon, sometimes in search of insects, which he collects. 
</P>
<P>
Her two children from a previous marriage, a son and a daughter, are grown and 
live in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh is a transplant from West Virginia, the daughter of an engineer who 
raised his family on a sheep farm because his wife was uncomfortable with 
crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh graduated from Allegheny College in Meadville, Pa., and did some 
postgraduate work at the University of Pittsburgh. She came to California from 
West Virginia with her former husband, who was transferred here in the late 
1960s. She worked as a nature guide in Orange County parks and as an 
environmental education teacher in the county's public school system until the 
mid-1970s, when the first stirring of the environmental movement began. 
</P>
<P>
Nathaniel Lamm, the school system's administrator of environmental education, 
recalled the public's heightened interest in teaching youngsters about the 
environment, but he noted the county's dearth of reference materials. Lamm 
turned to Marsh, whom he had met several years earlier while she was working 
for one of the county's nature conservancies and who seemed a natural for the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't really have a good reference point. That's where Karlin came about," 
Lamm recalled. "She is one of those rare individuals who can take something 
very technical and make it understandable. . . . She's very much in demand." 
</P>
<P>
Marsh eventually wrote three volumes, reprinted numerous times, that until a 
few years ago remained the principal reference books for environmental 
education in the county's schools at the elementary and junior high school 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
The first book provides an overview of the county's biological communities, the 
second provides a more detailed look at the county's coastal wetlands and 
mountain habitats, and the third looks at the effect of development and 
urbanization on the county's wildlife, Marsh said. 
</P>
<P>
At the time Marsh was asked to write the reference, she was already bored with 
teaching and eager for a new challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"You can only give so many nature walks to little snappers," she quipped. "I 
figured there must be something more out there."

FPPC CLEARS SHERIFF OF MISSPENDING FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Fair Political Practices Commission has cleared Orange County Sheriff 
Brad Gates of wrongdoing following claims by a local citizen that Gates had 
illegally spent thousands of dollars in campaign funds in winning reelection to 
a fifth term earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Central to the dispute were allegations that Gates had sidestepped state 
election law by using more than $1,600 in campaign funds to rent space at a San 
Juan Capistrano equestrian center that his wife owns, and using the space as 
his reelection headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
State law would have precluded Gates or family members from accepting campaign 
funds as rent payments, officials said. But the FPPC found that because the 
Ortega Equestrian Center is owned by a separate corporate entity -- not in the 
name of Gates or his wife -- the rental was legal. 
</P>
<P>
Gates' wife, Diana, is the sole shareholder of the corporate entity, Otra Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"The lease arrangement does not violate (the Political Reform Act's) personal 
use provisions," FPPC Counsel John G. McClean wrote in an Oct. 19 letter to 
Shirley L. Grindle of Orange, who has monitored the campaigns of county 
officials since 1974 and brought a complaint with the state against the sheriff 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the Orange County district attorney's office in May found no 
campaign violations in Gates' action after reviewing Grindle's claims. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the equestrian center issue, Grindle had also taken Gates to 
task for accepting $2,000 in campaign contributions from the firm of Valenti 
and Coelho Inc. in February, 1989, allegedly in violation of state law that 
bans donations in excess of $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
The FPPC said in its Oct. 19 letter: "While this appears to be a violation of 
the (Political Reform) Act's contribution limits, we have decided not to take 
formal enforcement action. At the time the contributions were accepted, the 
contribution limits were new, having become effective on Jan. 1, 1989. 
Furthermore, (Gates' reelection committee) returned the excess amount of the 
contribution following the filing of this complaint." 
</P>
<P>
The FPPC also noted that the contribution limits were overturned by a federal 
court in September, throwing the entire issue into confusion. 
</P>
<P>
Grindle had also attacked Gates for his far-reaching use of campaign funds, 
citing such expenses as limousine service to events and $1,565 worth of Los 
Angeles Rams football tickets for staff and supporters. 
</P>
<P>
While the FPPC did not address the various expenses individually or respond to 
Grindle's request for an audit of Gates, it did say: 
</P>
<P>
"Each of the expenditures complained of is one which could have a relation to a 
political, legislative, or government purpose, and there is no evidence to 
indicate that such purposes do not exist. Absent such evidence, we have decided 
to close this file." 
</P>
<P>
Gates, who was reelected sheriff in June, defeating Fullerton Councilman Don 
Bankhead, could not be reached for comment Monday on the ruling, nor could 
officials in the FPPC office in Sacramento, which was closed for Veterans Day. 
</P>
<P>
Grindle took some satisfaction in the FPPC's position, noting in particular 
that the commission may adopt new regulations that would close off the legal 
technicalities that she said allowed Gates to pay rent to his own wife for his 
campaign headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed FPPC regulations could erase the distinction between a corporate 
entity and a candidate or his family in the regulation of campaign funds. 
</P>
<P>
Gates' lawyer, Darryl Wold of Costa Mesa, noted that the sheriff probably won't 
be able to pay rent to his wife's company in the future for a campaign 
headquarters. But because of the overturning of the contribution limits in 
Proposition 173, he can instead accept the space as a contribution from the 
company -- as he had done before 1989, Wold said. 
</P>
<P>
The end result, Wold said, would be the same: Gates could use the equestrian 
center for a campaign headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"This is space he needs for his records and things, so it's a matter of 
convenience," Wold said. "There's nothing wrong with it. (Grindle's) 
allegations were motivated by her support for Gates' last opponent, Don 
Bankhead, and she just ginned up these charges with no legal basis because she 
didn't understand the law."

TENANTS JOIN PAPER DRIVE FOR CHARITY

<P>
Workers arriving at 4 Hutton Centre Drive Monday got coffee, doughnuts -- and 
empty cardboard boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, on almost every desk in the 10-story building -- from private, polished 
executive offices to secretary's cubicles -- boxes will be filled with recycled 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
The impetus for the recycling program came from a copywriter in the building, 
John Jay, 46, who began collecting discarded paper around his company, Foote, 
Cone and Belding Advertising, and from other offices. 
</P>
<P>
As more people in the building became interested, Hutton Management Services, 
the building manager, agreed to set up a formal program and pay for the 
cardboard boxes and bumper stickers which were handed out Monday. 
</P>
<P>
For Jay, the program is a welcome relief from the 12 hours a week he has spent 
collecting paper, sorting it and carting it in his pickup truck to a recycling 
center. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got my life back now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Jay stood in his green "Treepeople" T-shirt and urged colleagues to 
grab boxes along with doughnuts as they headed for the elevators. 
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to save about 175 pounds of paper a day and raise about 
$300 a month. That money will be divided among the building's tenants and given 
to charities of their choice. Foote, Cone and Belding will use the money to buy 
trees for the Costa Rican rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the company has contributed $250 for 1,000 trees through a nonprofit 
group called Arbofilia. The group hires native families to plant the trees and 
care for them, creating jobs as well as restoring the rain forest, Jay said. 
</P>
<P>
In the next couple of weeks, he plans to travel to Costa Rica to see the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
John Bonomo, assistant director of Hutton Management Services, said the company 
plans to expand the recycling project to its other buildings, beginning with 
another next week. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Jay said, he hopes that all 12 of Hutton's buildings will be 
recycling. In fact, Bonomo said, "I'd love to offer a challenge to all the 
other property-management companies to do the same thing."SHANNON SANDS

EL DORADO TO HOST ACADEMIC DECATHLON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 22nd annual academic decathlon for 11th- and 12th-graders in Orange County 
will be held Saturday at El Dorado High School in Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
The competition includes tests in math, science, economics, fine arts, 
literature and social science. Contestants must also present prepared and 
impromptu speeches, write an essay and be interviewed by judges. This year's 
topic for the final event, the Super Quiz, is space exploration. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with that theme, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Rockwell 
International will be setting up two space exhibits at the high school on 
Saturday for participants and guests. 
</P>

CSUF GETS $301,000 BIOMEDICAL GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton has been awarded a $301,000 grant to start a program to 
encourage more ethnic minorities to enter biomedical careers such as chemistry 
and biology. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in January, eight students will work as research assistants to four 
of the university's top research scientists involved in projects funded by the 
National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Each student will be paid to work part time during the academic year and full 
time for at least eight weeks during the summer. In addition, the program will 
include tutorial assistance, a peer support group and a seminar program. 
</P>
<P>
The National Institute of General Medical Services provided the grant to launch 
the Minority Biomedical Research Support Program at Cal State Fullerton. The 
director of the program will be Bruce Weber, professor of chemistry and a 
former chairman of the chemistry department. 
</P>
<P>
"Our hope is that one day there will be so many minorities working in medical 
and research laboratories and teaching in universities that we will no longer 
need this program," Weber said in a statement.

GARDENERS' SMALL PLOTS WORTH LOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
To local dentist Madrid Uso, the small patch of hilltop soil he tends with his 
wife, Jenny, means more than the cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower they will 
harvest. 
</P>
<P>
"This is good therapy," Uso said. 
</P>
<P>
It's a concept not lost on Harry Otsubo, for whom the 2 1/2-acre Harry Otsubo 
Gardens is named. Otsubo, 76, owner of the Dana Point Nursery, has been 
gardening and farming all his life. But, like the Usos, he wanted his own plot 
on the hillside overlooking Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"People love nature, whether it's animals or vegetables," Otsubo said. "There's 
something fascinating about things growing. I think that's what keeps a farmer 
going. He actually sees something that's the result of his work, and can watch 
it grow." 
</P>
<P>
At the gardens, people may lease any one of 48 plots of heretofore expensive 
Dana Point soil, either 10 feet by 20 or 20 feet square, for $10 or $20 a year, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
What they use the plot for is up to the gardener. 
</P>
<P>
"These are cool season vegetables," said Jenny Uso, pointing to some baby 
seedlings poking through the soil. "After Christmas, we plan to try some 
strawberries." 
</P>
<P>
On her parcel, Michele Cuevas has planted lettuce, Brussels sprouts and various 
herbs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping I won't have to buy any at the store," said Cuevas, who tends her 
plot daily with her two daughters, Brooke and Bridget. Michele is Otsubo's 
granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the Harry Otsubo Gardens evolved out of hours of discussion by the 
board of directors of the Capistrano Bay Park and Recreation District, said 
Lynn Muir, a board member and local architect. The acreage was deeded to the 
park district by the developer of the Searidge condominium project across 
Street of the Golden Lantern in exchange for the right to build. The gardens 
opened this fall, and already all but a few plots are taken. 
</P>
<P>
"At first we weren't sure what to do with it, but we finally decided that 
rather than just have it sit there, why not let people have a garden for 
themselves," Muir said. 
</P>
<P>
It was patterned after similar projects in Leisure World, Fullerton and the 
"Victory Garden" television program, Muir said. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured there was a school (Dana Hills High School) right across the 
street, so there was already a place for people to play nearby," said Otsubo, 
another district board member. 
</P>
<P>
The rocky soil was rototilled and fertilized by the district, which also 
provides water. But Otsubo, with decades of experience, suggests that may not 
be enough. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest part is getting started," he said. "You need to work the soil and 
add mulch and fertilizer. I always tell people it's like a cake, you can put 
all the ingredients together, but if you don't blend them right, they won't 
work for you." LEN HALL

CITY TO STUDY MORE CAR-POOL INCENTIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the wake of a state agency's veto of the city's smog-reduction package, the 
City Council will discuss additional incentives at its afternoon study session 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District requires Newport Beach, like 
other Orange County cities, to offer city employees incentives to car-pool and 
use public transportation in an effort to reduce traffic congestion and air 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The plan that the city originally submitted to the AQMD included establishing a 
bicycle loan program, preferential parking for car poolers and on-site transit 
subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
However, in a letter rejecting the proposed package, AQMD Transportation 
Program Director Sarah Siwek said that the incentives listed by the city would 
not be sufficient to reach the goals mandated by state law. 
</P>
<P>
City officials must look into such additional measures as financial incentives 
for car pooling, alternate work weeks and parking fees for single-occupancy 
cars, the letter reads. If the city does not modify its plan, it could face 
fines and criminal penalties. 
</P>
<P>
One possibility that the council will consider is paying employees who car-pool 
with two or more people an extra $30 a month. Those who car-pool with one other 
person would receive $15 extra per month.

<P>
City employees received raises this month as the final installment of a 
three-year contract took effect. 
</P>
<P>
As negotiated in the original agreement, general employees received a 5% pay 
increase while raises for the Police and Fire departments were based on the 
median salaries of 10 Orange County cities. 
</P>
<P>
The average increase for Fire Department employees was 6% and the average for 
police was about 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Management personnel also received salary increases. Excluding department 
heads, a 2.5% increase was approved across the board with an option for an 
additional 2.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping the police and fire employees' salaries in line with those of other 
cities was a major factor during negotiations, officials said. After many 
heated discussions, it was agreed to make adjustments according to the salaries 
other cities were paying.

3 HOMES DAMAGED IN ROOF FIRES CAUSED BY BURNING TREE

Roof fires caused by embers from a burning tree damaged three houses on Monday, 
fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
They said the fires caused an estimated $15,000 in damage to the three homes. 
</P>
<P>
Burning embers from the tree near the Costa Mesa Freeway apparently floated 
over the freeway, igniting the three shake roofs, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange Fire Department is investigating how the tree caught fire. "We think 
some kids were over there starting it," Capt. Douglas Mochizuki said. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Jones was home doing work for his construction business when he smelled 
smoke. "There were ashes all over the neighborhood," Jones said. "I was worried 
about my own home." 
</P>
<P>
Jones ran outside and saw that the houses on both sides of him were on fire. He 
then grabbed a garden hose and climbed on top of neighbor Francis Warring's 
house. Three construction workers on a project nearby also spotted the blazes 
and helped to contain them. 
</P>
<P>
Warring, 72, was treated at the scene for heat and exhaustion before being 
taken to St. Joseph's Hospital where he was examined and released, fire 
officials said. It took about 20 minutes for engine units from Orange and 
Anaheim to control the fires near the 2300 block of Sacramento Street, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Luckily we had some very helpful citizens," Mochizuki said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones' home was not damaged due to the precautions he had taken. He had removed 
wooden shingles and installed sprinklers on the roof. 
</P>
<P>
"These roofs are probably 20 to 25 years old and are very dry," Mochizuki said.

PRESSURE MADE RABBITT RUN; 
</P>
<P>
CROSS-COUNTRY: BUT NOW, UC IRVINE ATHLETE IS REALIZING HER POTENTIAL BY NOT 
THINKING SO MUCH ABOUT WINNING. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There is so much to think about, and so little of it seems to escape Buffy 
Rabbitt. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the concept of potential. Or rather, consider the concept that one's 
potential is unfathomable. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's impossible to know your potential," said Rabbitt, once a spindly 
Newport Harbor High School freshman who couldn't run a mile, and now an 
All-American runner four times over at UC Irvine. "Your potential is only 
manifested in the races you run. How can you know?" 
</P>
<P>
Ponder the idea of fame, or even of local renown. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like how people assign importance to people they don't know, just for 
having run a time," Rabbitt said. "I just don't see myself that way." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, she says, in her case there is the matter of her name, which is a big, 
hanging pitch to punsters everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that a large part of my "fame" is the fact that I have a humorous 
name," Rabbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Examine, analyze, articulate -- Rabbitt can do all those things as well as she 
can run a cross-country course or the 1,500 meters. 
</P>
<P>
And that, Rabbitt has decided, can be a problem. Too much thinking. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, Rabbitt, then a junior, set her mind on having an outstanding 
track season in her first season back after a year in France. Not only would 
she qualify for the NCAA championships, she decided, but she would run a 
personal best. 
</P>
<P>
She concentrated and she planned. She diligently recorded pre-race thoughts and 
post-race analyses. 
</P>
<P>
And she struggled to qualify for the NCAAs, and never beat her best time. 
</P>
<P>
Troubled, she thought again. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to the conclusion that one reason I didn't reach my goals was because I 
put so much pressure on myself," Rabbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Was it fear of failure that hounded her? Or for Rabbitt, friendly but 
soft-spoken, was it fear of fame? 
</P>
<P>
All Rabbitt knew was that it was pressure, overwhelming pressure. 
</P>
<P>
So now she is playing the grandest mind game of all -- she is studiously not 
thinking about it, with great success. 
</P>
<P>
As sixth-ranked Irvine goes into the NCAA cross-country championships Monday in 
Knoxville, Tenn., Rabbitt is achieving the -- pardon the term -- potential her 
coaches have seen since she was a freshman, when she became the first Irvine 
woman to make All-American in cross-country. 
</P>
<P>
This season, she has won five of the six meets she has competed in, including 
the Big West Conference championship and the NCAA regional championship. In the 
only race she didn't win, she finished second to Wisconsin's Suzy Favor, who is 
considered the top middle-distance runner in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Vince O'Boyle, the Irvine coach, is hoping for a top-five finish at the NCAA 
championships for Irvine's deep team. 
</P>
<P>
And for Rabbitt, he says, "top 10, conservatively." 
</P>
<P>
Rabbitt, of course, isn't thinking about it, if she can help it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just looking at a race as an opportunity to have fun, just to do my best 
with out being intimidated," Rabbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Nervousness, once a pre-race staple, has grown more rare. 
</P>
<P>
There are days this season when she is not nervous until an hour before the 
race. This in contrast to the Olympic trials in 1988, when she was nervous for 
weeks in advance and then was disappointed in her performance, failing to make 
the final. 
</P>
<P>
"I really like to keep the nervousness down," Rabbitt said. "I'm finding it 
doesn't help me. I think there's a difference between that energy you have that 
can be termed adrenaline and that almost gut-wrenching feeling that can feel 
like ground glass in your stomach. I think really it can be determined that has 
no positive effects." 
</P>
<P>
This has been a season in which Rabbitt, for so long a follower, is Irvine's 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
She has to be. No one else can keep up. 
</P>
<P>
Before now, despite her talent, she had been a reluctant star, deferring to 
such older runners as Jill Harrington and Beth McGrann. In Irvine's 
team-oriented program, that was praiseworthy, and it was something Rabbitt 
enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier to put out your best effort when you have the support of a group," 
Rabbitt said. "You can help each other to achieve. It can be as simple as when 
you're hurting, someone saying, 'Come on.' " 
</P>
<P>
Now, she has stepped forward, alone if she has to. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, she's not running with people," O'Boyle said. "Before she would 
have either Brigid (Stirling) or (Harrington) and kind of match up. This year 
she has let herself make the decision, 'I'll go out, and if people want to run 
with me, fine.' We haven't had other people to run with her." 
</P>
<P>
Rabbitt has been running at the front. She hasn't much known who is running 
behind her, or who she will compete with at Knoxville next week. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost purposefully leave myself in the dark," she said. "I don't have time 
to read Track &amp; Field News. All right, I admit it. I don't know who has 
what times or who got third in the Pac-10." 
</P>
<P>
Goals? The one most often mentioned is simply to do her best, not set her 
sights on times or places. 
</P>
<P>
"That practice produces pressure that I feel I don't need," Rabbitt said. "I'm 
self-motivated enough that I know I'm going to race to the best of my ability 
no matter what place I get or what time I get. I don't need to motivate myself 
by saying I have to catch that person to get second." 
</P>
<P>
It sounds simple, almost too simple. 
</P>
<P>
"I know sports psychologists are really adamant about preparing for your race," 
Rabbitt said. "Ironically, this works for me." 
</P>
<P>
She is doing what she did when she began running, as a high school freshman in 
glasses and deck shoes who couldn't complete the training run. She says she is 
just trying her best. 
</P>
<P>
"Supposedly as you grow older, you get more intelligent and learn more and more 
complex things," Rabbitt said. "The idea of being in a sport in order to try to 
do the best you can is a simple one I probably always want to have with me." 
</P>
<P>
She will take it with her into the NCAA cross-country championships, and into 
her final track season this spring. 
</P>
<P>
After that, another chance in the Olympic Trials lies ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't given a great deal of thought to the next trials because I'm 
concerned about the here and now, this cross-country season," Rabbitt said. 
"I'm not even thinking about track." 
</P>
<P>
But she knows the trials await, because people will not let her forget. When 
Rabbitt does remember it, she thinks about the disappointment of last time. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I was at my peak," she said. "The next time, I want to feel 
ready and not feel so intimidated. If I ever do reach that level again, I want 
to feel confident so intimidation will not hinder my potential."

FREEDOM WANTS COLORADO STATE; FIESTA CHOOSES 
</P>

Colorado State will receive an invitation to the Freedom Bowl, officials 
announced Monday, and 20th-ranked Louisville will play one of three 
Southeastern Conference teams -- Tennessee, Alabama or Auburn -- in the Fiesta 
Bowl at Arizona State's Sun Devil Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State and Oregon apparently will be opponents in the Dec. 29 Freedom 
Bowl game at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Oval Jaynes, the Colorado State Athletic Director, said his university would 
accept the bid when it can be officially extended Nov. 24. Oregon Athletic 
Director Bill Byrne made a similar statement last week. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State, the second-place team in the Western Athletic Conference, and 
Oregon, the fifth place-team in the Pacific 10, each have 7-3 records. 
</P>
<P>
"The two teams are excited about coming to the game," said Don Andersen, who is 
the executive director of the Orange County Sports Assn., which runs the bowl 
game. "Neither team is looking at this as a consolation prize." 
</P>
<P>
It will be the first bowl appearence for Colorado State since 1948, when the 
Rams lost to Occidental College, 21-20, in the now-defunct Raisin Bowl in 
Fresno. It is the second bowl appearence in the 95-year history of the school. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as two years ago, Colorado State's program was floundering. The 
Rams were 1-11 in 1988 and 1-10 the season before. Earle Bruce, who coached at 
Ohio State from 1979 to 1987, took over the program in 1989 and led Colorado 
State to a 5-5-1 season. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Colorado State won more than seven games was in 1977, when the 
Rams were 9-2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon will be making back-to-back bowl appearances for the first time in the 
history of the university. Last season, the Ducks defeated Tulsa, 27-24, in the 
Independence Bowl in Shreveport, La. 
</P>
<P>
An official announcement is expected today, but Fiesta Bowl sources said Monday 
that Louisville, which finished the season 9-1-1, has agreed to accept the 
Fiesta invitation. The situation with the remaining bid is slightly more 
complicated. Here are the conditions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- If Mississippi wins the SEC and the automatic Sugar Bowl bid, then the 
Fiesta selection committee will choose between Tennessee and the Auburn-Alabama 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If Tennessee wins the SEC, then the Fiesta will choose the Auburn-Alabama 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If Auburn or Alabama wins the SEC, then the Fiesta would offer Tennessee 
the bid. 
</P>
<P>
Only three days ago, embattled Fiesta Bowl officials were seriously discussing 
canceling this season's game. At issue was the failed referendum calling for an 
Arizona state holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr. Because of the vote, 
much-wanted schools such as Virginia declined to play in the Tempe-based bowl. 
</P>
<P>
And only two days ago, Fiesta officials spent their entire Sunday calling at 
least a dozen teams, probably more, in search of two programs that would be 
willing to accept a bid. The Fiesta offered its estimated payout of $2.5 
million and assurances that significant efforts were under way to diffuse the 
King situation. 
</P>
<P>
Among the possibilities is a halftime show that would feature a civil rights 
theme. NBC, which is the network responsible for the broadcast, has indicated 
to Fiesta organizers that it might consider enlisting the help of some of its 
entertainers. Also being discussed is an additional $200,000 fee paid to each 
of the participating universities. The money would be earmarked for a school's 
minority affairs program or minority scholarship fund. 
</P>
<P>
For Louisville, the Fiesta invitation marks the first time since 1977 the 
Cardinals will play in a bowl. Coach Howard Schnellenberger called each of his 
team's 24 seniors at 6:30 Monday morning and met with them an hour later to 
discuss the situation. Later that day, after talks involving Schnellenberger, 
Donald Swain, university president, and Bill Olsen, athletic director, the bid 
was accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the presidents of Tennessee, Auburn and Alabama, were gathering 
information regarding the Fiesta Bowl. Satisfied with the Fiesta's efforts and 
intent, approval was given to play in the New Year's Day game.

IRVINE STRUGGLES BUT STOPS FINNISH NATIONAL TEAM

IRVINE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UC Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan was hoping to see an improving Anteater 
basketball club on the court in the team's second exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
A victory seemed to be a given. After all, the Finnish national team that 
Irvine met Monday night in the Bren Center had lost to Chapman College by 31 
points Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of revving its running game in preparation for the season opener 
against UCLA in less than to weeks, Irvine struggled to a 101-90 victory, 
trailing briefly in the first half and playing to a halftime tie. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't concerned with playing the Finns as much as I was with how much we 
had improved," Mulligan said. "We haven't." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine, coming off a 5-23 season that was the worst in school history, didn't 
lead by double digits in the second half until 6 minutes 9 seconds remained, 
when Ricky Butler's layup off a pass from Gerald McDonald gave the Anteaters an 
11-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
And Mulligan knew, it might have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Finns hadn't gotten into foul trouble, they might have won," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Four Finnish players fouled out. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, Irvine's senior center, led the Anteaters with 32 points, 27 of them in 
the second half. Butler made 14 of 20 shots and also had 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Aside from Butler, I can't think of anyone else who played well," Mulligan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In their first exhibition game, a 127-122 loss to High Five America, the 
Anteaters struggled with turnovers and poor free-throw shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine committed 19 turnovers Monday, down from 29 in the first exhibition 
game. 
</P>
<P>
But the Anteaters still struggled at the line, making only 26 of 42 free throws 
(62%), compared to 53% in the first exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps most disappointing to Mulligan was the team's fast break, which he 
has hoped will be its trademark. A busy fall schedule of conditioning and 
early-morning workouts didn't seem to have yielded much Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I was disappointed in our break, and our lack of conditioning, which I can't 
believe," Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Von Lutzow, a sophomore forward, added 15 points for Irvine, and sophomore 
guard Dylan Rigdon, who made only three of 11 shots, added 13. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Herbert scored 16 points for the Finnish team, leading five players in 
double figures.

GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Melizza Benitez 
</P>
<P>
School: El Modena High School 
</P>
<P>
Sport: Volleyball 
</P>
<P>
Position: Setter 
</P>
<P>
Class: Junior 
</P>
<P>
Marni Hichborn might get most of the attention for leading El Modena's 
undefeated girls' volleyball team, but it's Benitez who sets up Hichborn for 
the 16 to 17 kills she averages. Benitez had 42 assists and eight blocks in the 
Vanguards' four-game victory over South Torrance Saturday in the second round 
of the 3-A Division playoffs. In the first round Thursday, she had 29 assists 
and six blocks in a three-game victory over Temecula Valley. And this from a 
player who has been a setter for less than a year. After last season, in which 
Benitez was a second-team all-Century League outside hitter, El Modena Coach 
Craig Tefertiller asked her to become a setter. "She's just a superior athlete 
with good instincts for setting," Tefertiller said. "She gets the ball to the 
right players at the right time. She's only 5-9 but she must have a six-foot 
wingspan because she's the second-best blocker on the team after Marni." 
</P>
<P>
Other top performers: 
</P>
<P>
Page Bartelt, who swept her singles sets (6-0, 6-1, 6-0) to lead Capistrano 
Valley to a 14-4 victory over University in the first round of the 4-A Division 
girls' tennis playoffs Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Mauney and Marta Bickert, who had 18 and 17 kills, respectively, for 
Capistrano Valley in a four-game victory over Santa Margarita Thursday in the 
first round of the 5-A Division girls' volleyball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Martha Pinto, a Katella runner who had the best time for an Orange County 
runner (18 minutes 6 seconds for three miles) and won her II-A Division heat at 
the Southern Section cross-country preliminaries Saturday at Mt. San Antonio 
College. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Prigmore, who had 22 kills for Calvary Chapel in a three-game sweep of 
First Lutheran in the first round of the Small Schools Division playoffs 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Shelley Taylor, who won her II-AA Division heat by more than a minute for 
Edison, finishing in 18:27 in the Southern Section cross-country preliminaries 
Saturday.

KEATING GRAND JURY CONSIDERED OTHER S&amp;L INDICTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state grand jury that indicted Charles H. Keating Jr. and three others on 
securities fraud also considered charging several other employees of Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan and its parent firm with wrongdoing, recently released grand 
jury transcripts reveal. 
</P>
<P>
But to keep the complex case manageable, prosecutors advised the 22-member 
panel to limit the indictment to the top officials of Lincoln and Phoenix-based 
American Continental Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to go after the people truly responsible for this behavior in a way 
that promises some possibility of success in a time frame soon enough to be 
meaningful to the victims," Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas 
Papageorge told the grand jurors. 
</P>
<P>
The result was a 42-count indictment in mid-September for alleged securities 
fraud against Keating, former American Continental President Judy J. Wischer 
and Robin S. Symes and Ray C. Fidel, both former presidents of Irvine-based 
Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito set aside 22 counts of 
the indictment because many of the charges did not clearly state the alleged 
wrongdoing. The judge gave the prosecutors until Nov. 19 to rewrite the 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment charges the defendants with falsely stating and failing to state 
the true risks associated with the sale of $200 million in American Continental 
bonds to more than 17,000 investors. Those bonds became worthless after the 
company filed for bankruptcy protection in April, 1989, and regulators seized 
Lincoln the next day. Regulators estimate that Lincoln's collapse will cost 
taxpayers more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury transcripts, which were released Friday, give a picture of the 
prosecutor's strategy. The state wanted to keep the indictment narrow to make 
it understandable to a trial court jury. 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, prosecutors decided to drop their original effort to seek 
charges of conspiracy and grand theft by false pretenses because the charges 
were too complex and difficult to prove, the grand jury transcripts show. 
</P>
<P>
At the closing arguments before the grand jury on Sept. 11, prosecutors came 
with a proposed indictment in hand naming Keating and three others. They argued 
against expanding the case to include more defendants or more charges. 
</P>
<P>
One of the grand jurors, Glenn Buchanan of Sherman Oaks, confirmed in an 
interview Monday that the panel considered including several other Lincoln and 
American Continental officials in the indictment but finally agreed with the 
prosecutor's approach. 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan said grand jurors considered bringing charges against American 
Continental executives Robert J. Kielty, Andrew Ligget and Jack D. Atchison and 
Lincoln executive Dariush Razavi, a top aide to Fidel. The grand jury discussed 
indicting at least two others. 
</P>
<P>
While none of the people identified by Buchanan have been indicted, their names 
appear often in the 4,500 pages of grand jury testimony publicly released. They 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Before joining American Continental at a salary of nearly $1 million, Atchison 
had been a partner at the accounting firm of Arthur Young &amp; Co. in Phoenix 
and was head of the audit team that produced the last two American Continental 
financial statements. 
</P>
<P>
Those statements, much criticized by thrift regulators, were largely what the 
state Department of Corporations relied on in approving the sale of American 
Continental bonds, even though the state agency's staff had developed a strong 
case for denying approval of the bond sale. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury also wanted to delve more into the role of state regulators in 
the sale of nearly $200 million worth of debt securities at Irvine-based 
Lincoln's 29 Southern California branches, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan said a minority of grand jurors wanted to bring in more regulators to 
determine the state's role in approving the sale of the bonds, but proposals to 
subpoena them were defeated. A separate investigation by the Sacramento 
district attorney's office is looking into possible wrongdoing involving state 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury also narrowly voted down a proposal to subpoena U.S. Sen. Alan 
Cranston (D-Calif.), he said, to testify about his relationship with Keating, 
former chairman of American Continental. 
</P>
<P>
In August, near the end of the investigation, the grand jury came close to 
issuing a subpoena for Cranston, Buchanan said, but instead sent a letter 
simply requesting him to appear. The senator's lawyer responded at the time 
that Cranston, who was out of the country at the time, was too busy and could 
not provide meaningful information.

BROKERAGE SAVORS BIG COURT VICTORY OVER A GOLIATH; 
</P>
<P>
LITIGATION: THE $9.2-MILLION VERDICT AGAINST DALLAS-BASED TRAMMELL CROW CO., 
BUYER OF THE FLUOR CORP. HEADQUARTERS, GLADDENS THE HEART OF BILL LEE, FOUNDER 
OF LEE &amp; ASSOCIATES.

<P>
For most commercial real estate brokers, the fascination comes in doing the 
bigger deal. 
</P>
<P>
But for Bill Lee, founding partner of Lee &amp; Associates, moving up has often 
meant frustration. The medium-size brokerage that carries his name does not 
have the clout and reputation of larger competitors, often leaving him out of 
the blockbuster transactions. 
</P>
<P>
So it is with glee that Lee savors his firm's $9.2-million court victory last 
week against Trammell Crow Co., the Dallas-based commercial developer and 
management company. The judgment means more than money to Lee. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of people who will be captured by a broker involved in a 
$340-million deal," he said in an interview Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, which occurred five years and one month ago, involved the closing of 
one of the county's largest commercial real estate deals. Trammell Crow bought 
the former Fluor Corp. headquarters in Irvine. Lee claimed that his firm had 
brought the parties together and demanded a $9-million commission. Crow and 
Fluor resisted. 
</P>
<P>
After a trial that lasted five months, an Orange County Superior Court jury 
ruled in favor of Lee &amp; Associates. The jury awarded the brokerage a 
$6-million fee. With interest and damages, Lee &amp; Associates stands to 
pocket $9.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot at stake," Lee said. "There's the embarrassment of being wrong, 
then there's the impact that being wrong has on your business life." 
</P>
<P>
While the case is not the first in which a broker has sued for commission, it 
is the largest such dispute in Orange County. The names of the firms involved 
made it highly visible. Lee said he received 35 calls from fellow brokers 
congratulating the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Trammell Crow is expected to appeal the judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Lee did not personally have a financial stake in the outcome of the case. The 
big financial winners were the five partners who were running the Orange office 
of Lee &amp; Associates in 1985: Chuck Witters, John Earnhart, Paul Earnhart, 
Doug Himes and Mike Martin. 
</P>
<P>
But Lee, the spokesman for the company, which is organized as a series of 
partnerships with no corporate office, said the victory should boost the 
reputation of the firm in the eyes of the commercial real estate community. 
</P>
<P>
It has not always been a highly visible brokerage. Lee feels that the firm's 
image as a small player may have prompted Trammell Crow partners to ignore its 
pleas for the $9-million share of the proceeds from the sale of Fluor's 
signature building. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not so sure the major (brokerage) firms would've found themselves in the 
same position," Lee said. "Maybe they viewed us as somebody who couldn't 
sustain the fight." 
</P>
<P>
Lee &amp; Associates opened its doors in El Toro in 1979 and had four locations 
when the Orange partnership -- which has since moved to Santa Ana -- decided to 
sue Fluor and Trammell Crow. Fluor, the huge Irvine-based engineering and 
construction firm, was later dropped from the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The brokerage has grown in the last 18 months to eight offices and now has 
doubled the number of its sales associates from 100 to 200 and partners from 40 
to 79. And it has expanded beyond Orange County into San Diego, Los Angeles, 
San Bernardino and Riverside counties. Five new offices are planned within the 
next three years, four of them in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
A new office of Lee &amp; Associates opens when a core of three to five 
experienced brokers can raise at least $250,000 to start business. The 
company's other partners can invest and receive 6% of the gross revenue of the 
new partnership each year. Each office divides its profits at the end of the 
year among its partners. 
</P>
<P>
Sales associates join an office with the understanding that they can be voted 
in as a partner at the end of three years. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said the company's structure, which allows brokers to become owners in the 
firm, is the reason why it is expanding now during tough economic times. A 
larger competitor, Grubb &amp; Ellis, announced late last week that it would 
lay off 400 people nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"In a market like this, there are brokerage companies that are cutting 
commissions to stay profitable," he said. "They are cutting support. Brokers 
are looking around to see what alternatives are available." 
</P>
<P>
Lee, 48, is known as a broker who does well in a declining marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
"The key is in discerning what will pay you and what won't," he said. "You 
really have to know who's got money to buy and who has a real need to move into 
a big space. It's knowing the market. Also, in a tough marketplace, you've got 
to make sure you're working on as many deals as possible because a certain 
percentage won't happen, won't get financing." 
</P>
<P>
Lee has just returned to a daily commute to the firm's new City of Industry 
office after five years of working from an office in his Newport Beach home. He 
decided to work from home when his daughter was born and to coach his three 
boys in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
A former guard for basketball teams in three Southern California colleges, Lee 
has a degree in physical education and taught at St. Monica's High School in 
Santa Monica before becoming a salesman for 3M Corp. Three years later, in 
1970, he entered real estate. For two years in the mid-1970s, he was the top 
salesman for the Newport Beach office of Grubb &amp; Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
By working from the City of Industry office, Lee said, he is hoping to add to 
the push to move the firm into Los Angeles. He foresees the firm's expanding to 
other cities and competing with the likes of a Cushman &amp; Wakefield, Grubb 
&amp; Ellis and Coldwell Banker. 
</P>
<P>
He hopes the recent suit will change the way his company is perceived. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think a broker wants to be labeled as a litigant, but at the same 
time, I know a broker doesn't want to be labeled as someone who can be 
intimidated into accepting less than what had been agreed to," Lee said.

MIDWEST QUAKE FEARS ARE BOON TO COUNTY COMPANIES; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY: MARKETERS OF SURVIVAL KITS REPORT SURGE IN BUSINESS FROM THE NATION'S 
HEARTLAND, WHERE A MAJOR TEMBLOR HAS BEEN PREDICTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"The Big One," NBC's fictional account of a major earthquake in the Los Angeles 
area, hadn't yet hit the airwaves when the phones started ringing at Great 
Shakes Inc. in Brea a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which packages earthquake survival kits, wasn't getting inquiries 
from local folks worried about a calamity. The pickup in business came from 
folks living half a continent away. 
</P>
<P>
Great Shakes is among a number of Orange County companies who report a spurt in 
business due to a surge in earthquake awareness along the Mississippi River, 
from Chicago to Memphis, where residents have been warned by a scientist to 
prepare for a major temblor in early December. 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't very many businesses back there that specialize in earthquake 
survival," said Tommy Rainey, vice president of Emergency Lifeline, a Santa Ana 
firm that sells emergency survival kits and conducts earthquake preparedness 
seminars. "When people in Missouri think of quakes, they think of Southern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
Climatologist Iben Browning, 72, of New Mexico said in March that an unusual 
alignment of planets on Dec. 2 and 3 would create a 50% chance of a major quake 
then on the New Madrid fault. 
</P>
<P>
In response, several school districts and cities in the fault zone, which runs 
from Marked Tree, Ark., to Cairo, Ill., have made tentative plans to dismiss 
students and pull together disaster and public safety workers during the 
critical two-day period. 
</P>
<P>
And as December draws near, newspapers and radio and television news programs 
in the region have focused attention on Browning's warning and reminded 
residents of the great New Madrid quakes in the winter of 1811-12. 
</P>
<P>
A series of quakes, including four that scientists say would have measured 
between 8 and 8.7 on the Richter scale had that measuring system existed at the 
time, rocked the then sparsely settled region that winter. No other earthquake 
in the United States has been rated as high as 8.7. The San Francisco quake of 
1905 has been rated an 8.3-magnitude temblor, and the Bay Area quake of Oct. 
17, 1989, was recorded at 7.1 on the Richter scale. 
</P>
<P>
The New Madrid quakes -- which were felt as far east as Washington -- destroyed 
scores of cabins and farm buildings, killed dozens of people and reportedly 
reversed the flow of the Mississippi River for a brief time. 
</P>
<P>
As people living along the New Madrid fault have been reminded of the nearly 
2-century-old devastation, the fear in the heartland has meant better business 
for certain companies in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency Lifeline, started in 1985 by Kathy Gannon -- a native of Missouri -- 
has seized the opportunity to plug into the region's new quake awareness by 
launching a program of safety seminars in Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee and 
Kentucky. The firm also has mailed 10,000 catalogues to quake-zone addresses, 
hoping to spur mail-order sales of its survival kits. 
</P>
<P>
Great Shakes sales manager Marvin Marquis said his firm also has mailed 
catalogues -- more than 5,000 of them -- to schools and businesses in the New 
Madrid fault zone and has been receiving inquiries about its survival kits from 
people in that region for more than a month now. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which has 300 employees and operates several branch offices around 
the country, offers a variety of retail and custom-designed survival kits that 
include food and water, first-aid and sanitation supplies, survival equipment 
and, at the upper end of the price scale, emergency shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Retail kits, the type generally ordered by individuals or small businesses, 
cost $12.95 to $3,995, Marquis said. Custom kits can run "many thousands more," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like Emergency Lifeline, Great Shakes also conducts safety seminars and just 
completed a series in Chicago and Memphis that was geared to earthquake 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at several civil and structural engineering firms in Orange County 
said they haven't experienced any recent increase in business, either from the 
Midwest or from locals responding to NBC's two-part earthquake movie, which 
ended Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
But that, they said, is because they deal with corporate and government clients 
and not with individuals, who are more likely to be upset and spurred to action 
by a movie like "The Big One." 
</P>
<P>
Shawna Sandoval, a receptionist and secretary at American First Aid Supply in 
Brea -- another of Orange County's survival-kit marketers, said Monday that she 
saw an increase in phone orders after the first part of the TV movie aired 
Sunday night and that she expects more calls today "after the part runs that 
shows all the destruction." 
</P>
<P>
Sandoval, who handles the company's phone orders, said she also has seen a 
definite increase in orders and inquiries from the Midwest in recent weeks.

flagging sales, said Monday that it has received approval from the Food and 
Drug Administration to market the first so-called "cold laser" for opening 
blocked arteries of the legs. 
</P>
<P>
Trimedyne in 1987 was the first company to win the FDA's approval to market a 
laser-powered "hot-tip" catheter to sear through fatty plaque in leg arteries. 
The hot laser uses laser energy to heat the metal tip of a catheter, which is 
then threaded through the arteries to vaporize the blockages. 
</P>
<P>
But sales of the hot laser fell off when the medical community expressed 
preference for an alternative technology known as a "cold laser." A cold laser 
uses a free beam of laser-produced light, administered in short bursts, to 
remove the plaque without producing significant heat. Doctors prefer it because 
they want to eliminate the possibility of thermal damage to healthy tissues. 
</P>
<P>
While Trimedyne's hot laser has shown success in opening clogged leg arteries, 
the FDA has not yet approved it for use in the heart. The market for using 
lasers to unblock clogged heart arteries is estimated by Trimedyne to be worth 
up to $800 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Trimedyne began developing a cold laser about two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Demmer, Trimedyne's executive vice president, said his company's 
Omni-Pulse laser, approved by the FDA, is powered by a holmium crystal that 
generates short bursts of ultraviolet light to vaporize plaque. 
</P>
<P>
"The medical world has said the cold laser is the way to go and now we have met 
the challenge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Demmer said it's too soon to tell if the cold laser will prove 
superior to the company's hot laser in treating blood vessel blockages in the 
legs. 
</P>
<P>
Trimedyne's main objective, he said, is to get the cold laser approved for 
cardiac use, although he acknowledges that the process will likely take two 
years. Another local firm, Advanced Interventional Systems of Irvine, is 
expected to become the first U.S. company to get federal approval to market a 
cold laser to treat blocked coronary arteries. 
</P>
<P>
An FDA medical panel recently approved the AIS device for use as an alternative 
to bypass surgery in certain cases when balloon angioplasty -- forcing an 
opening with pressure -- had been uneffective in clearing a patient's heart 
arteries. 
</P>
<P>
Trimedyne lost $6.2 million on revenue of $10.2 million for the first nine 
months of its fiscal 1990 year, contrasted with earnings of $929,000 on revenue 
of $26.6 million for the corresponding year-earlier period.

COMMUNITY DENTAL OFFERS TO BUY 5 OF DHA'S 8 CLINICS

DHA Dental Inc., the operator of eight dental clinics in Orange, Los Angeles 
and Riverside counties now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, said it has received an 
offer from Torrance-based Community Dental Services Inc. to purchase five of 
its clinics for $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
The five clinics are in Santa Ana, Anaheim, Costa Mesa, Covina and Bellflower. 
</P>
<P>
Not included are DHA clinics in Orange, Carson and Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
DHA has been soliciting bids for the clinics since July, three months after it 
filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition because it was unable to pay $1.7 
million in federal and state taxes. Chapter 11 allows a company to continue 
operating while developing a plan to repay its debts and reorganize. 
</P>
<P>
"DHA is seeking court authorization to sell its eight clinics," said Robert 
Opera, an Irvine bankruptcy attorney representing DHA. 
</P>
<P>
An essential part of the agreement is to preserve the continuity of patient 
care, Opera said. 
</P>
<P>
"The prospective buyer, Community Dental Services, has agreed to continue 
treatment of existing DHA patients in all of the DHA clinics," he said. The 
company said it has about 10,000 patients at its clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Community Dental is affiliated with Smile Care Dental Group, also of Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, DHA listed sales of $20 million and debts of $17 million. The 
company's eight clinics currently employ about 60 dentists among its 300 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Opera said the company would prefer to sell the clinics, if possible, to one or 
two buyers rather than piecemeal. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hopeful of preserving as many jobs as possible through the sale of the 
business rather than going through a liquidation of the assets," said Donald A. 
Patrick, DHA's acting chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing on the motion to sell the DHA clinics has been set for Nov. 21 in 
Santa Ana.

Rockwell International Corp. has formed a strategic alliance with an Italian 
aerospace and defense electronics manufacturer to go after business in the 
international aircraft avionics market. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Rockwell's Defense Electronics division in Anaheim said 
details of the agreement with the Milan-based company, Fabbrica Italiana 
Apparecchiature Radio-elettriche S.p.A., will be released at a press conference 
Wednesday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian company has "some expertise that will really be valuable to us," 
said Rockwell spokeswoman Christine Rodriguez. She said that Fabbrica is a 
leading developer of aircraft radar. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell spokesman Tony Longo said the two firms plan to compete for contracts 
to upgrade avionics equipment for the roughly 1,800 F-5 fighter planes used by 
air forces worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said the agreement is part of a growing trend within the U.S. defense 
industry for companies to team up with international partners to bid on large 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Fabbrica has about 1,100 employees and had 1989 sales of $128 million. Its 
major shareholders include Setemer Ericsson, the Italian defense subsidiary of 
Sweden's Telefonaktiebolaget L M Ericsson; and Finmeccanica, a financial 
holding concern of Italy's IRI Group.

RICH LITTLE MAKES A WEAK IMPRESSION; 
</P>
<P>
JUDGING BY THE MEDIOCRE MATERIAL SUNDAY, HE APPARENTLY FIGURED THAT JUST 
SHOWING UP AT THE PERFORMING ARTS CENTER WAS ENOUGH.

You could feel the tension in the halls of the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center on Sunday night. Under orders from the headlining superstar himself, 
ushers cut short the intermission and rushed audience members back to their 
seats just minutes after the end of the opening act. Nervous Center staffers 
whispered among themselves about the reason the performer could keep himself 
from his fans no longer: "Rich," they told one another, "has a plane to catch." 
</P>
<P>
Odds are that Rich Little caught his plane, because he didn't waste any time 
coming up with material. Instead of using his facility for mimicry to any comic 
end, Little banked on the premise that the marvel itself was worth the price of 
admission. 
</P>
<P>
Thus began a 90-minute shtick of celebrity voices mouthing lines about 
incontinence, sex organ size and patriotism; like 2 Live Crew's Luther 
Campbell, Little seems to have figured out the kind of topics sure to please 
any crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The high point of Little's act was its opening number, "Talk Like Celebrities," 
which he sang to the tune of "Talk to the Animals" from "Doctor Dolittle." 
Dishing out a lyric as Groucho Marx here or Jackie Gleason there, he preserved 
the best element of the TV commercials and game-show appearances that 
distinguish his career: brevity. 
</P>
<P>
With the other sketches, Little dragged out his tepid jokes over achingly long 
minutes, giving ample opportunity to note the dissimilarities between his 
impressions and the genuine articles. 
</P>
<P>
When you can see Johnny Carson doing his own monologues most nights a week on 
television (or live, for free, at the NBC studios in Burbank), what's the 
appeal of a Little sketch that seeks to do nothing but copy Carson at his most 
stilted? 
</P>
<P>
Other overlong sketches sought to portray celebrities in unlikely occupations: 
Andy Rooney as a boxing announcer, Dr. Ruth Westheimer as a bank teller, James 
Mason as an English teacher. What could have made a mildly amusing routine of 
quick one-liners was instead milked like a prize Guernsey; does it really take 
five minutes to get across the humor of seeing Jimmy Stewart as an air-traffic 
controller? 
</P>
<P>
For his most ambitious sketch, Little lowered a video screen over the stage to 
project a red-wigged image of himself as "Nightline" host Ted Koppel. The 
recorded Koppel acted as quizmaster for the game show "Presidential Pursuit," 
in which Little played contestants George Bush, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter and 
Richard M. Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
Though he aped the patter of a famous newsman and four familiar Presidents, 
Little still managed to avoid his taboo areas of topicality and relevance. 
Nixon entered the news recently with the opening of his controversial library 
in nearby Yorba Linda, but this, as well as Bush's role in the Persian Gulf 
crisis, budget chaos and election comeuppance, didn't rate a mention. Instead, 
Little chose easier avenues of attack, giving us a Reagan who forgets and a 
Carter who's an idiot. 
</P>
<P>
No one expects Little to display the talents of, say, Harry Shearer, whose 
sketches on National Public Radio use scathing mimicry of newsmakers to 
underscore deviously satirical writing. 
</P>
<P>
But if he plans to end his shows with a call to war (in the voice of local hero 
John Wayne, he demanded that Americans either pull out of the Middle East or 
"beat the hell out of those towel-heads"), Little should offer a bit more to 
think about than whether imitation is really the sincerest form of flattery. 
</P>
<P>
The best bit of this evening middlebrow-beating didn't come from Little. Credit 
instead goes to singer Julie Budd, whose opening act centered on a tribute to 
her late Las Vegas mentor, Liberace. 
</P>
<P>
As slides of the entertainer were projected on the giant screen, the taped 
voice of Liberace spoke from beyond the grave to introduce his favorite song, 
"The Impossible Dream." Budd then sang the number in an unearthly duet with 
Liberace, his voice adding a touch less macabre than surreal.

The Laguna Playhouse has received two $5,000 grants for its Disabled Actors 
Project from the BankAmerica Foundation and the McDonnell Douglas West 
Employees Community Fund. The 2-year-old project trains young physically 
challenged actors. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Toyota USA also contributed $5,000 to the project. 
</P>
<P>
"We are especially proud that this particular program not only provides 
cultural accessibility, but also acts as a therapeutic human service by 
building self-esteem among youngsters overcoming a variety of physical 
impairments," said David J. Knutsen, of BankAmerica's Laguna Beach branch. 
</P>
<P>
The McDonnell Douglas grant was the first made by the fund to the Laguna 
Playhouse. In another first-time grant, the Subaru of America Foundation 
contributed $1,000 to the Playhouse for its Youth Theater. 
</P>
<P>
More than $5,000 was raised Sunday at the Righteous Brothers' Hop in Fountain 
Valley in an evening of entertainment to benefit Rainbows to End Hunger, the 
Education Network and the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force. Righteous 
Brother Bill Medley headlined the event, which featured the bands After Hours 
and Mystery School and performers Ken Orso and Mary Ekler.

A MORNING OF QUINTETS AT THE TAPER

Croissants, coffee and chamber music at the Mark Taper Forum remains one of the 
more endearing traditions in Los Angeles, with its unorthodox yet civilized 
starting time -- 10:45 a.m. -- and free refreshments on the L.A. Music Center 
plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday morning's edition at the Taper featured just a pair of cornerstones of 
the clarinet literature -- the clarinet quintets of Mozart and Brahms -- and 
the Pacific Symphony's principal clarinetist, James Kanter. 
</P>
<P>
In the wrong hands, this could have meant a morning of routine languor. But the 
skilled ad-hoc quintet on hand (Kanter, violinists Margaret Batjer and Rene 
Mandel, violist Richard Elegino and cellist David Speltz) proved otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
With Mandel playing first violin, the Mozart work was treated to a warmly 
affectionate reading, emerging properly into a crisp finale. Kanter tended to 
blend in reticently with the strings, displaying an occasional, slightly 
harsh-edged tone in the softest passages. Yet he proved himself technically 
unflappable, clearly articulating the rapid variations in the finale. 
</P>
<P>
The performance of the Brahms quintet definitely had more heat, much of which 
was generated by the gutsier, more assertively emotional playing of first 
violinist Batjer, switching places with Mandel. Particularly moving was the way 
the quintet projected the aching melancholy of the second movement. 
</P>
<P>
The series' indefatigable artistic director, Henri Temianka (who will turn 84 
on Monday), prefaced each work with his usual lively, humanizing commentary on 
the composers. He also announced that he would be reducing his activities as an 
organizer for the series, while remaining available for speaking, conducting or 
playing.

THOUGHTS OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN OVERSHADOW THE LA HABRA COMMUNITY THEATRE 
PRODUCTION.

<P>
The fact that director Marla Gam-Hudson was barred from casting a black actor 
as Romeo in the La Habra Community Theatre's "Romeo and Juliet" will remain the 
pressing element as the production closes its run this Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Gam-Hudson said she wanted the interracial casting as a way to comment on 
bigotry. To give further resonance, the director was considering moving 
Shakespeare's tragedy of doomed love from Verona, Italy, to modern South 
Africa. Intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
But the company's board of directors vetoed her, claiming that a black Romeo 
and a white Juliet would be too controversial for the troupe's regular 
subscribers and that such an approach would subvert their desire for a more 
traditional staging of the drama. Faint hearts and worried minds never did much 
for the evolution of art. 
</P>
<P>
We'll never know whether the original concept would have inspired the kind of 
hand-wringing protests over expressionistic license that have become almost 
commonplace in Orange County. Nor will we know if it would have been a bad 
directorial move on a purely objective level. 
</P>
<P>
And there's the rub. Besides stripping Gam-Hudson of her artistic autonomy, the 
board, by its preemptive action, removed the public from the process, 
dismantling its right to make its own judgment on the production's validity. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of this, the board's defense -- that it was protecting theatergoers 
and preserving the play's integrity -- is weak. Besides, Gam-Hudson wasn't 
talking about an aggressively provocative or pornographic approach that would 
test the community's values. She was talking about an interracial relationship, 
a common enough reality in our lives. 
</P>
<P>
Two white actors (Christopher Lance Walker and Christian Leffler play on 
alternating days) were finally cast opposite Stefane Zamorano's Juliet. It's 
unfortunate that both men have faced their role under this cloud, but 
apparently they are holding up. Leffler got good reviews from local newspapers, 
and Walker, who was in the Saturday show I saw, did reasonably well despite 
some missteps. 
</P>
<P>
Within the traditional framework, Gam-Hudson has chosen to emphasize the 
youthful vivacity of her lovers over their romantic longings. Walker hews to 
this approach closely -- his Romeo is full of puppy love and percolating 
hormones for his Juliet. 
</P>
<P>
Although all of Walker's adolescent bopping about (this is a swain who can't 
keep still) can divert one from the play's drama, he does come across like a 
kid completely lost to his emotions. 
</P>
<P>
That creates some tension, both erotic and comic, between him and Zamorano, who 
presents a Juliet with a rapidly rising temperature. Zamorano has fun with the 
role; her Juliet is a sensualist -- she almost writhes in anticipation during 
the famous balcony scene. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, neither Zamorano nor Walker offers fully shaded performances, but 
they are the production's best. The downside here is that Gam-Hudson's pacing 
is erratic, as are most of the other portrayals. 
</P>
<P>
Shakespeare places demands on community theaters that other writers don't -- 
from the simple handling of arcane, poetic language to the depth of his 
universal characters -- and the stress is evident. 
</P>
<P>
Still, besides Zamorano and Walker, there are other pluses, like Rand L. 
Hudson's revolving set, a rather complicated and accomplished design by 
community theater standards. I wonder how he would have handled the challenge 
of a South African locale. 
</P>

BANKS, S&amp;LS SHOW MIXED 3RD QUARTER; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS: SOME FIRMS REPORT INCREASED EARNINGS BECAUSE OF 
ACQUISITIONS, WHILE OTHERS SEE THEIR PROFITS FALL BECAUSE THEY PUT ASIDE MONEY 
FOR POTENTIAL LOAN LOSSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Major banks and savings and loans in the area escaped big losses in the quarter 
that ended Sept. 30, unlike some important banks nationwide. But, as a group, 
the local banks and S&amp;Ls turned in mixed performances. 
</P>
<P>
Of the nine larger banks and S&amp;Ls in the region stretching from Ventura to 
Glendale, four reported an increase in quarterly profits, two reported profits 
after losing money a year ago and three reported a decline in earnings. None 
reported losses. 
</P>
<P>
Usually results at financial institutions depend mostly on how they are 
affected by interest rates. But in the recent quarter the most notable declines 
and gains in profits depended on a variety of factors: Some institutions 
reported increased earnings because of acquisitions, while others saw their 
profits fall because they put aside money for potential loan losses. 
</P>
<P>
Although recession fears abound nationwide, John Keating, chief executive of CU 
Bancorp, the Encino parent of California United Bank said, "I don't see a 
recession now." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, California United boosted its contribution to reserves for 
possible loan losses. As a result, the bank's net income fell 22% to $1.2 
million in the quarter, even while its assets grew 6% to $463.6 million. A 
loan-loss reserve is money a bank puts aside in case borrowers default on their 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
By contributing $1.45 million to its loan-loss reserves this quarter, compared 
with $300,000 a year ago, California United increased its overall reserve to 
$4.79 million from $3.67 million a year before. But the change did not reflect 
an increase in problem loans. Non-performing loans -- a category that includes 
real estate the bank repossessed, plus loans with payments past due -- barely 
inched up, to $5.99 million from $5.96 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
So why did Keating boost these reserves now? To be conservative, he said, in 
case the local economy really does slow down. 
</P>
<P>
Banks and S&amp;Ls in the quarter saw prevailing interest rates fall slightly 
compared with a year ago. One measure of the decline is that the average 
overall interest rate paid by savings and loans in California, Arizona and 
Nevada on their savings accounts, certificates of deposit and other money they 
borrow fell from 8.81% in September, 1989, to 8.09% in September, 1990, 
according to the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
But the decline was too small to be very important to banks. In general, banks 
are able to cope with changing rates because they can quickly lower the 
interest rate they pay on deposits if there is a decline in the interest rate 
they can charge on loans. 
</P>
<P>
The largest bank in the region, Independence Bank in Encino, said its net 
income plunged 72% to $250,000 for the third quarter. But the bank's assets 
grew 22% to $764.6 million on Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Independence's chairman, Fulvio V. Dobrich, said profits fell because in the 
year-ago quarter the bank made no contribution to its loan-loss reserves, while 
this year it added about $1 million to those reserves in the latest period. 
Independence is privately owned, and Dobrich said it does not try to smooth out 
its results by making smaller, more regular additions to those reserves. 
</P>
<P>
From June 30 to Sept. 30, Independence's non-performing assets increased from 
about $30 million to about $39 million, but Dobrich said the increase was due 
to a single loan. And since the end of the quarter, he said, non-performing 
assets have actually dropped to below $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
Independence's addition to its loan-loss reserve meant the bank did not do well 
during the quarter according to one key measure of performance -- return on 
average assets. The ROA is the annualized rate of profit a bank earns on its 
average assets, and a return of 1% is considered excellent. But Independence 
turned in an ROA of just 0.13% in the latest quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Levy Bancorp, the Ventura parent of Bank of A. Levy, said its net income 
increased 30% to $2 million for the third quarter, giving the bank an 
impressive ROA of 1.32%. Levy's assets grew 7% to $621.3 million as of Sept. 
30. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County National Bancorp, the parent company of Ventura County National 
Bank and Frontier Bank, saw its assets bulge 65% to $400.9 million on Sept. 30. 
Meanwhile, Ventura's third-quarter profit jumped 71% from a year ago to $1.4 
million. Both increases were due mostly to the bank's acquisition of Frontier 
in October, 1989, and to its acquisition of the deposits of Westco Savings Bank 
earlier this year. Ventura's third-quarter ROA was 1.04%. 
</P>
<P>
TransWorld Bancorp, the Sherman Oaks parent of TransWorld Bank, said its net 
income grew 13% to $620,000 for the third quarter, giving it an ROA of 1.13%. 
TransWorld's assets grew 10% to $226.4 million on Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
APSB Bancorp, the parent of American Pacific State Bank in Sherman Oaks, 
enjoyed a good quarter. APSB did increase its loan-loss reserves, although 
problem loans haven't increased. But the bank's earnings continued to be strong 
as net income grew 30% to $566,000 for the quarter, while its assets climbed 
15% to $204.1 million on Sept. 30. APSB had an ROA of 1.14%. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen nothing related to recession yet," said Frank J. Ures Jr., chief 
executive of the bank, which specializes in making loans to small businesses, 
under a program sponsored by the federal Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The story was different for thrifts in the period. Unlike banks, S&amp;Ls lend 
most of their money in the form of adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) whose 
interest rates are sometimes adjusted only once or twice a year and so don't 
keep up when rates are rising. Meanwhile S&amp;Ls have to pay higher rates to 
attract and keep deposits. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, such climbing interest rates were hurting S&amp;Ls. But thrifts are 
enjoying the benefits of a slight decline in rates this year, which took the 
squeeze off their profits. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Citadel Holding Corp., the Glendale parent of Fidelity Federal 
Bank, said it had a profit of $4.9 million in the third quarter that ended 
Sept. 30 compared with a loss of $2.3 million a year before. Citadel's assets 
climbed 14% to $5.63 billion, buoyed by the thrift's acquisition in August of 
the deposits and certain assets of Westwood Savings &amp; Loan and Investment 
Savings &amp; Loan from the federal government. Nevertheless, Citadel's ROA for 
the period was an unimpressive 0.36%. 
</P>
<P>
Glenfed, parent of the region's largest thrift, Glendale Federal Bank, said its 
profit fell 10% to $17.7 million in the period, its fiscal first quarter. 
Meanwhile Glenfed's assets inched up 2% to $25.1 billion on Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Keith P. Russell Jr., Glenfed's chief operating officer, said one of the main 
reasons for the profit performance was that Glenfed has all but stopped selling 
mortgages it writes to investors; as a result, Glenfed's gains from loan sales, 
before taxes, dropped to $1.5 million in the recent quarter from $19.1 million 
a year before. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Glenfed halved its quarterly dividend to shareholders, to 15 cents, 
to save about $5.4 million that the S&amp;L will use to boost its capital, 
which is the money a thrift must have as a cushion against possible losses. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Glenfed said its net earnings from "continuing operations" -- its basic 
loan-making business -- climbed to $19.6 million for the first quarter from 
$15.6 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Even Valley Federal Savings, a Van Nuys thrift, earned a profit of $5.5 million 
for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 compared with a loss of $70.7 million a 
year before. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Federal has been operating under the terms of a strict agreement with 
the federal Office of Thrift Supervision because its capital reserves do not 
meet federal standards. In reaching the agreement last spring, Valley Federal 
dodged the immediate threat of being seized by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
In the same quarter a year ago, most of Valley Federal's loss came from 
writeoffs made in its All Valley Acceptance Co. subsidiary, which made loans on 
mobile homes. But Valley Federal also lost money then on its basic 
deposit-gathering and mortgage-lending business. 
</P>
<P>
As of Sept. 30, the S&amp;L still had a deficit of $22.3 million in tangible 
capital -- essentially its net worth minus the value of some non-cash assets. 
Valley Federal said its earnings so far this year were slightly better than 
what the government's plan requires. And the S&amp;L has shrunk in size, as is 
called for under the plan, by about 14% to $2.72 billion in assets as of Sept. 
30.

GRAVE-ROBBERS COME UP SHORT IN BIZARRE CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Would-be grave-robbers attempted to dig up the body of a suspected drug dealer 
-- buried in Newhall with a jewelry-studded watch and gun -- but failed because 
they did not dig deep enough, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
The desecrated grave of Robert R. Hagen was discovered Monday at Eternal Valley 
Memorial Park, but Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department investigators remain 
puzzled by the bizarre crime. 
</P>
<P>
Hagen, 25, was shot and killed in his customized Mercedes-Benz on July 24 
shortly after leaving a hearing at the Van Nuys Courthouse, where he was facing 
four charges of arson. At the time, police said he had long been suspected of 
being a drug dealer, though he was never charged. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Neville, manager of the cemetery, said Hagen was buried along with several 
rings and a watch and pistol encrusted with jewels that his family believed had 
sentimental value to him. 
</P>
<P>
Hagen's casket was placed in a concrete vault nine feet below ground, Neville 
said. On top of it, another empty concrete vault was placed. It is to be used 
when Hagen's mother dies, Neville said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's investigators said the unknown grave-robbers -- equipped with a 
shovel, pick, gloves and masks to guard against odor -- dug into the first 
vault, but they gave up after finding it empty and apparently believing that it 
was Hagen's burial vault. 
</P>
<P>
But what confused the would-be grave-robbers also confused the investigators. 
</P>
<P>
"We had an empty concrete vault," Lt. Harvey Cantor said. "Our initial 
conclusion was that a coffin was missing." 
</P>
<P>
That changed after cemetery officials checked records and determined it was a 
"double-depth" grave, Neville said. 
</P>
<P>
What remains is the mystery of why the grave was desecrated. Though Neville, 
who directed Hagen's burial, said several pieces of jewelry were buried with 
him, investigators and others familiar with the murder victim said that the 
value of the belongings is strictly sentimental.

<P>
President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian republic said today that Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev has agreed to divide authority between their rival governments, a 
major step toward ending the nationwide paralysis of power. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement appeared to mark a major concession by the Soviet president, who 
has not yet commented publicly on his five-hour meeting Sunday with Yeltsin, 
his political archrival. 
</P>
<P>
"Russia has chosen its path and is on its way," Yeltsin told Russia's 
Parliament today in the most detailed account yet of Sunday's session. 
</P>
<P>
The two men have appointed commissions that are discussing how the two 
governments should divide such fundamental responsibilities as foreign affairs, 
national security, taxation, banking and currency, Yeltsin said. 
</P>
<P>
The commissions' decisions would redefine the very basis of power in the Soviet 
Union. The vast Russian republic is home to half the Soviet Union's 287 million 
people and composes two-thirds of its territory. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said he had proposed to Gorbachev "a new system of state power: the 
formation of a coalition government of national unity in which the candidates 
for several posts would be proposed by the Russian Parliament." 
</P>
<P>
The Russian president was greeted with laughter and applause in the chamber 
when he added that he "did not ask for many posts, just three, prime minister, 
defense and finances," jobs that form the crux of Soviet power. 
</P>
<P>
The nation has undergone a crisis of authority since a declaration of 
sovereignty last June by the Russian republic, which has the lion's share of 
the nation's natural resources and wealth. 
</P>
<P>
The result has been a series of conflicting laws and decrees issued by Yeltsin 
and Gorbachev and the national and Russian parliaments that have virtually 
paralyzed commerce across the country, worsening the already dire shortages of 
food and other consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
"We are starting the process that should have started after we passed our 
declaration" of Russian sovereignty in June, Yeltsin said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he told the Soviet president that the crisis was caused because "you 
are conducting a policy of diktat from the center," in violation of the old 
Soviet constitution and violation of recent agreements between the two men. 
</P>
<P>
"You did not officially recognize the division of functions between the center 
and Russia," Yeltsin said. 
</P>
<P>
"The same happened with the economic program, that is, everything is coming 
from the center," with Gorbachev unwilling to share power with the national and 
Russian parliaments, Yeltsin told the lawmakers.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov, the witty "voice of glasnost" 
who gave the Soviet government a human face, has been rewarded with an 
ambassadorship in a European country, Tass said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet news agency, citing "reliable Foreign Ministry sources," said Vitaly 
Churkin, a close aide to Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, will replace 
Gerasimov as the chief official contact for several hundred foreign reporters 
based in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov was not immediately available for comment. An aide confirmed that he 
will go to a European capital as a Soviet ambassador but said his exact 
assignment was not known. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov's droll sense of humor, sometimes acerbic tongue and stylish clothes 
gave his briefings an air of entertainment as he and correspondents from around 
the world matched wits in a give-and-take previously unknown in Moscow.

An Israeli reserve soldier was shot to death today by a man who infiltrated 
from Jordan, and a Palestinian man stabbed two paramilitary border police 
officers in Jerusalem's old walled city, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The fatal wounding of reserve Staff Sgt. Pinchas Levy, 37, occurred about 2 
a.m. near Adam's Bridge, a crossing point north of the town of Jericho that 
links the occupied West Bank to Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
He was the second soldier slain in the area in a week. 
</P>
<P>
The policemen stabbed in Jerusalem were both slightly wounded, a police 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the latest in a series of stabbing attacks in Jerusalem since the Oct. 8 
Temple Mount shootings, in which police opened fire on Palestinian 
stone-throwers, killing 20 Arabs and wounding 140. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, Israel jailed without trial three senior Palestinian leaders in the 
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry said it ordered Radwan Abu Ayyash, head of the Arab 
Journalists Assn., and journalist Ziad Abu Zayyad jailed for six months for 
membership in the banned Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, security sources said Dr. Ahmed al-Yaziji, an alleged PLO activist 
in Gaza, was ordered jailed without trial for a year under emergency defense 
regulations.

The strongest typhoon to hit the Philippines in nine years swept across the 
central islands today with 150 m.p.h. winds, killing at least 14 people, 
sinking ships and forcing 240,000 people to flee their homes. 
</P>
<P>
The navy said a merchant ship with 25 crew members was missing off Mindanao 
island and that 16 boats had sunk off Cebu island. 
</P>
<P>
Three sailors were reported missing in the Cebu sinkings. 
</P>
<P>
At least 17 people, including six Americans, were trapped on an oil rig off 
Palawan island after 68 other workers were evacuated, said Maj. Antonio 
Babijes, chief of the Manila Rescue Coordinating Center. 
</P>
<P>
He said officials asked U.S. Air Force and Navy authorities to assist in 
evacuating the rig after a rescue boat was forced back by rough seas. The rig 
is operated by Alcorn Production-Philippines Inc. 
</P>
<P>
After wreaking considerable destruction in the midsection of the nation of 
islands, the so-called "super typhoon" passed into the South China Sea in the 
evening, sparing populous metropolitan Manila and U.S. military bases in the 
northern Philippines its fury. 
</P>
<P>
The storm smashed into Leyte from the Pacific Ocean with sustained winds of 150 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The typhoon then raked rice, coconut and sugar farms in Cebu, Negros, Panay and 
Palawan islands. Its winds weakened to 100 m.p.h. before it moved out into the 
South China Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Relief agencies said two people were killed in Panay island, seven in Negros 
and five in Leyte. Most of the fatalities either drowned or were hit by flying 
debris. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said downed communications and power networks prevented a full 
assessment of damage and casualties, and they feared the death toll would go 
up.

RATION EGGS, FLOUR AND MEAT, MAYOR OF LENINGRAD URGES

Leningrad's reformist mayor urged the City Council today to ration eggs, flour, 
meat and other necessities, saying it is the only way the city will get through 
the winter without hunger and unrest. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire country is introducing ration cards, and we unfortunately cannot 
avoid it either," Mayor Anatoly Sobchak said. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet television showed shoppers in Leningrad, the country's second-largest 
city, waiting in 500-yard-long lines for such ordinary items as butter, milk 
and chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
"Citizens standing in queues since morning want their representatives to take 
faster and, most of all, more decisive actions," the television announcer said. 
</P>
<P>
A few items are already rationed in Leningrad, but the new plan, if adopted, 
will be one of the most comprehensive rationing plans in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Leningrad officials said the council is likely to make a decision Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Sobchak suggested that without rationing, public anger over shortages could 
endanger President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's political reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"Democracy is facing a hungry winter," he said. "It is crucial for democracy to 
survive this winter. The only solution I see is to introduce ration cards now." 
</P>
<P>
Moscow already has rationed sugar and cigarettes, limiting residents to 4.4 
pounds of sugar and 10 packs of cigarettes per person in November. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow's City Council is expected to expand its ration system to include meat, 
butter and flour starting Dec. 1. Soviet newspapers have given varying accounts 
of the amounts of those items that Moscow residents would be allowed to buy. 
</P>
<P>
Local officials in other cities have rationed meat, vodka, butter and similar 
staples.

Israel has introduced a machine that fires lumps of gravel the size of eggs to 
disperse Palestinian demonstrators, military sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
It was designed especially for use against Palestinian demonstrators in the 
35-month-old intifada, a revolt against Israeli rule in the occupied West Bank 
and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said the device is not lethal and causes less harm than rubber and 
plastic bullets. 
</P>
<P>
Israel has been criticized for using lethal force against Palestinians. At 
least 738 Arabs have been killed by Israelis since the start of the Palestinian 
uprising in December, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The gravel shooter can fire up to 600 lumps of gravel a minute over a distance 
of 75 yards, Israel radio said. 
</P>
<P>
An earlier gravel shooter proved ineffective at close range.

1,000 SQUATTERS STAGE RIOT IN EASTERN BERLIN;

<P>
Berlin suffered its worst street violence in a decade when more than 1,000 
militant squatters fought a pitched battle with riot police overnight. Hundreds 
of people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
The squatters, angered by the clearance of three occupied houses in east Berlin 
on Monday, pelted police with gasoline bombs, stones and metal bars, set fire 
to cars and a streetcar and dug deep trenches in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Outnumbered and forced to retreat at first, police fired tear gas and water 
cannons to contain the rioters, who fashioned barricades out of cars, garbage 
containers, building huts and barbed wire. 
</P>
<P>
It was the latest episode in a rising spiral of violence since unification a 
month ago and raised questions about the social stability of the new German 
state. 
</P>
<P>
"When young people in Germany try to use other means to point to problems, no 
one listens. When they use violence, the interest grows," sociologist Wilhelm 
Heitmeyer told German television. "Politicians must not miss the warning 
signals." 
</P>
<P>
The Berlin city government came under criticism for provoking the violence. 
</P>
<P>
"Some 135 injured police officers and untold plunder and destruction are the 
result of a flawed security policy by the Berlin political authorities," the 
head of the German police union, Martin Gregg, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The riots could raise new objections among Germans to moving the government 
from Bonn to Berlin, a choice facing the pan-German Parliament to be elected 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
Squatters have occupied about 100 houses in east Berlin since the fall of the 
Berlin Wall last November, protesting against a housing shortage and plans to 
raise rents heavily subsidized by the former Communist government. 
</P>
<P>
A stringent element, including many from other parts of Germany and Europe, 
have occupied virtually an entire street in the run-down Friedrichshain 
quarter, where Monday night's violence took place. 
</P>
<P>
The quarter was calm by daybreak today, but burned-out cars and remains of the 
barricades closed the area to traffic.

QUICK CASH;

FAST-TRACK NOW LEADS ONLY TO PAWNSHOPS

<P>
Pawnshops are increasingly becoming home to the gold that made the 1980s 
glitter as layoffs rack Wall Street and other industries. 
</P>
<P>
But after years of being rudely portrayed by Hollywood as a usurious business 
preying on the impoverished, the pawnbroking industry is loath to be seen as a 
leading recessionary indicator. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln Square Pawnbrokers is an example of the boom. Newly hard-pressed New 
Yorkers have contributed to a 10% jump in unreclaimed valuables hocked this 
year at the tiny pawnshop. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the largest increase in 15 years," said owner Gary Kalter. He said 
gold jewelry is his most frequently pawned item. 
</P>
<P>
Kalter is not alone in reaping a windfall from the weak U.S. economy. Many of 
the roughly 8,000 U.S. pawnbrokers report that white-collar professionals who 
just a few years ago wouldn't be caught dead near their shops are skulking in 
to hock their Rolex watches, diamond rings and other symbols of the fast-cash 
'80s. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these former high-fliers -- including lawyers, developers and real 
estate agents -- need cash to buy Christmas gifts or other luxury items but 
have exceeded their credit card limits. 
</P>
<P>
But, while business is booming across the nation, times are decidedly mixed in 
New York City. Tough state regulations and high rents have helped reduce the 
number of pawnshops from 120 in 1940 to 20 in 1980 to just 15 in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Squeezed between a peep-show store and a Pizza Hut, S&amp;G Gross Co. in 
mid-town Manhattan writes about 100 loans a day, or about 25,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
A loyal customer base has helped the four-generation business remain in the 
hands of Robert Gross, 71, and his son Gary, 46. 
</P>
<P>
Tapping the shop's new computer system, Gary notes that keeping track of 
customers' loans has cut down on some of the haggling.

TIDE OF STATE TAX REVENUES EBBS, INDICATING RECESSION; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: OF STATES' THREE MAIN TAXES, THE CORPORATE INCOME TAX FARED WORST, 
WITH A 0.9% AVERAGE DECREASE.

<P>
Sluggish state tax revenues, despite large rate increases passed by some 
legislatures, suggest that many states already are in a recession, according to 
a national survey. 
</P>
<P>
A study by the Center for the Study of the States in Albany, N.Y., indicates 
that New England and mid-Atlantic states are experiencing the weakest tax 
revenues, in contrast to the Far West, where they are strongest. 
</P>
<P>
In the three months from July through September, the average increase in state 
tax revenues was 5.4% compared to the same quarter a year ago. In half the 
states the increase was 5.1% or less, which is lower than the rate of 
inflation, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
The revenue picture would have been even bleaker without large tax rate 
increases passed in Kentucky, Nebraska, New Jersey and Oklahoma. Excluding 
those four, the average increase was 4.9%. 
</P>
<P>
"Such a small increase has important implications about both the health of the 
economy and the state of state finances," said Steven Gold, the center's 
director. "It implies that the economies of many states are in recession and 
that many state budgets are afflicted by fiscal stress." 
</P>
<P>
Of the three main state taxes, the corporate income tax had the worst results, 
with a 0.9% average decrease, reflecting sharply lower profits. Twenty-three of 
the 42 states with corporate income taxes reported decreased revenues from 
them. 
</P>
<P>
California reported a 2% decline in corporate taxes but fared much better than 
average with personal income tax revenue, up 8.2%; sales tax revenue, up 6.3%, 
and total tax revenue, up 8.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, general sales tax revenue was up an average 4.5% and personal 
income taxes were up 5.6%. 
</P>
<P>
"The sluggish growth of the sales tax indicates that consumption spending is 
very weak," Gold said. "The relatively small increase in the personal income 
tax reflects weakness in the growth of wages, salaries and other forms of 
income." 
</P>
<P>
States with the largest revenue increases, according to the report, were 
Nevada, Kentucky, Hawaii, West Virginia, Nebraska, Oklahoma, New Jersey, Texas, 
Missouri, Idaho, Illinois and South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Overall revenue decreases were reported by Montana, Connecticut, New York, 
Massachusetts, Ohio, Wyoming and, due to an accounting change, North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
During legislative sessions this year, 10 states made tax changes expected to 
increase annual revenue by at least 5%, while seven more raised taxes by 1% to 
5%, the study said. Most are already in effect.

Stocks in Japan scored their eighth-biggest gain ever today as Japanese 
investors returned from a long weekend to find that oil prices had dropped and 
the yen had strengthened. 
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo stock market's key 225-share Nikkei average surged 1,041.87 points, 
or 4.54%, to 23,973.67. 
</P>
<P>
The market was closed Monday for Emperor Akihito's enthronement. 
</P>
<P>
The surge helped support advances elsewhere, with most major Asian stock 
markets rising. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo's strength lasted through the day even though the yen fell a bit against 
the dollar after advancing in New York on Monday on speculation that the 
Federal Reserve would loosen interest rates after meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed at 128.77 yen and 1.4755 marks after Monday's New York close 
of 128.55 and 1.4765. Its rise against the yen today was on speculative buying, 
dealers said.

After two days of healthy buying, Wall Street traders took profits today, 
sending stocks mildly lower. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 4.95 points at 2,535.40. Volume on 
the New York Stock Exchange was a moderate 160.24 million shares, while 
advancing stocks outpaced losers by about 8 to 7. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said sharply rising bond prices -- a reflection of dealers' hopes that 
the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates soon -- stopped blue chip stocks 
from falling further. 
</P>
<P>
Profit taking was the main reason for the Dow's decline. In the previous two 
sessions, the 30-share index rose by a combined 96.54 points. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day, the market had been fluctuating in a narrow range. 
</P>
<P>
"My guess is it is the pause that refreshes," said Michael Metz, an analyst 
with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. "We've had a nice 100-point run in the last two 
sessions. I think we're seeing a little profit-taking." 
</P>
<P>
Stocks posted their gains as oil prices dropped sharply, but oil was moving 
back up today, and some analysts believed that had put a brake on the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little bit of a deterrent," said Jack Solomon of Bear Stearns &amp; Co. 
He said the market seemed to be "resting." 
</P>
<P>
Among actively traded issues, Philip Morris was down 5/8 at 48 3/4 with an hour 
before the closing, Federal National Mortgage was up 3/4 at 32 3/4, American 
Express was up 7/8 at 22 1/2, IBM was down 1/2 at 112 1/2, General Electric was 
up 1/2 at 55 7/8 and Pepsi Co. was up 3/8 at 25 3/8. Toys R Us was up 7/8 at 23 
5/8. 
</P>
<P>
On the government bond market, long-term issues posted the steepest gains as 
the market positioned itself for lower interest rates amid more negative news 
about the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The price of the government's bellwether 30-year bond, which climbed 29/32 
point on Friday, was up another 3/4 point, or about $7.50 per $1,000 in face 
value at midday. Its yield, which falls when the bond's price rises, tumbled to 
8.55% from 8.62% late Friday. The government bond market was closed Monday for 
Veterans Day. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices moved higher on the opening, building on gains posted overseas on 
Monday.

<P>
A new basketball conference that would include top independents DePaul and 
Marquette and several Metro Conference teams is expected to be formed within a 
week, the president of Memphis State said today. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the new league, to be called the Big Midwest, are drawing up 
affiliation agreements for DePaul, Marquette, St. Louis, Alabama-Birmingham and 
Metro teams Memphis State and Cincinnati, Dr. Thomas Carpenter, Memphis State's 
president, said. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving the Metro Conference and joining the Big Midwest is "an opportunity we 
should move with," Carpenter told the Commercial Appeal of Memphis in an 
interview published today. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter said he met Sunday with Metro Commissioner Ralph McFillen, who is 
trying to hold his conference together after the recent defections of Florida 
State and South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he's trying to get West Virginia to agree to join the league, but I 
told Ralph he's been working on that for months and hasn't made any progress," 
Carpenter said. "I'm just not going to hold my breath." 
</P>
<P>
He said he expects officials with the new conference to announce its formation 
soon, perhaps within a week.

The attorney for shot put world record-holder Randy Barnes said today he was 
trying to arrange a Dec. 22 hearing for his client's appeal of a two-year 
suspension from competition. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes was suspended last week by the International Amateur Athletic 
Federation, the world governing body for track and field, after testing 
positive for steroids at a meet in Malmo, Sweden, in August. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney John Dowd said a hearing date hadn't been finalized, but he was 
shooting for late next month. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes has said the IAAF's drug testing procedures in his case were shoddy. He 
has denied taking steroids and insisted that the sample tested by the IAAF was 
not his. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes' appeal will go through The Athletics Congress, the national governing 
body. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes' world record is 75 feet, 10 1/4 inches, set in May.

COYOTE IS WILY AS AN ACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VERNON SCOTT, UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Coyote, namesake of the wily canines that thrive in the hills above 
Hollywood, similarly is a survivor in the thickets and bracken of the studios 
down on the flatlands. 
</P>
<P>
Coyote is a non-star, an actor who picks off plum roles but who rarely gets top 
billing. 
</P>
<P>
In "Die Laughing," "The Pursuit of D. B. Cooper" and others, including "E.T. 
The Extra-Terrestrial," "Cross Creek" and "Jagged Edge," Coyote made enormous 
contributions to the success of the films, but not as the star. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Coyote may be seen in "The Man Inside," once again in a supporting role as 
an unsympathetic, vicious writer for a German scandal sheet. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the supposition that I'm unusual in that I don't play leading-man 
roles," Coyote said. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe there are two kinds of stars. One I call 'transformers,' and the 
others, 'icons.' It's not a judgment; it's a description. If you are a 
transformer, the audience will never love you or clutch you to its bosom, 
whether you're Robert De Niro or Dustin Hoffman. People will never love them 
like they love Cruise or Eastwood and the other icons. 
</P>
<P>
"Transformers make people uneasy. If I can be a completely believable murderer 
or homosexual and then a completely believable lover, it makes people nervous 
as to their idea of who they are."

Best-selling author Tom Clancy, whose "The Hunt for Red October" and other 
thrillers are noted for their detail of military technology and combat 
maneuvers, says an end to war is desirable and possible. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no law of God or nature that says we have to have a conflict 
anywhere," Clancy said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
He is in Omaha through today to speak at a benefit for the Greater Omaha 
Chamber of Commerce and the Omaha Public Library Foundation. He is also 
scheduled to tour Strategic Air Command headquarters with Gen. John T. Chain, 
the SAC commander, as his guide. 
</P>
<P>
Known for being publicity-shy, he reportedly consented to the visit at the 
urging of Chamber of Commerce President Bob Bell, a retired Navy vice admiral 
he met at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
"I got hustled very skillfully," he said. "I don't mean to seem ungracious, but 
I have four kids. I'm just domestic, I'm sorry. I think there were two weeks in 
this year I didn't have to leave home for something."

BARITONE IN JOHN THE BAPTIST ROLE UPSTAGED BY BLOODY HEAD

<P>
It isn't the heavy breathing over Salome's dance of the seven veils that 
bothers opera singer Michael Devlin. It's being upstaged night after night by 
his own disembodied head. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very strange; it's very strange indeed," said Devlin, who plays John the 
Baptist in the Washington Opera production of Richard Strauss' "Salome," and 
loses his head over a pretty woman. 
</P>
<P>
The head, of course, is fake. But a strikingly realistic fake. It lolls on 
Salome's silver platter, eyes rolled back, blood oozing from beneath its long, 
matted hair, with a latex face that looks exactly like Devlin's. 
</P>
<P>
To judge by the gasps from Kennedy Center audiences, the head almost steals the 
show. It's a big enough star to command a personal makeup artist and stagehand. 
</P>
<P>
The head was made from a life mask of Devlin, a baritone from Seattle, for the 
original Peter Hall production of "Salome" at the Los Angeles Music Center in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
The head was bald when it arrived in Washington, so wig maker Dennis Bergevin 
spent 40 hours hand-stitching and stapling a three-foot mane of human hair and 
cotton dreadlocks to the skull. The wig cost about $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Before each performance, a plastic bladder inside the skull is filled with a 
$37 quart of Nextel Brand Simulated Blood, a urethane-based suspension of red 
microbeads. It is unplugged shortly before the head is presented to Salome. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the curtain falls, makeup specialist Cynthia Ludwig and the 
stagehand rush the bloody head to a janitor's sink and wash it clean with cold 
water. Then it is carried downstairs in an elevator and put under a hair dryer 
for two or three hours. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before its next stage appearance, the face gets a fresh layer of 
greenish white pancake makeup with dark shadows here and there, bright red 
lipstick on the mouth and glycerine to make it look sweaty. 
</P>
<P>
For much of the 90-minute opera, John the Baptist or Jokanaan (the prophet's 
Hebrew name) sits in a dark cistern where Herod has imprisoned him. He shouts 
dire warnings to the sinners above and emerges briefly to scorn seductive 
Salome's advances. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sitting down there on a chair, singing into a microphone and watching 
(conductor) Gerry Schwarz on a little television set," Devlin said. "And two 
feet to the right is my head, lying in a bucket of blood. It's quite 
disconcerting." 
</P>
<P>
Jokanaan doesn't get the girl, and who can blame her? After all, he denounces 
her as a "daughter of Sodom" and refuses even to look at her. So she strikes 
her bargain with Herod: She dances her veils away to total nudity before the 
leering king, and she wins Jokanaan's head on a platter. 
</P>
<P>
After the executioner's ax falls in the dungeon, Devlin sneaks to the wings to 
watch soprano Maria Ewing, who plays Salome, make steamy love to his head. She 
cuddles it, nibbles it, showers it with kisses. "I will bite it with my teeth 
as one bites a ripe fruit," she sings. 
</P>
<P>
Jokanaan might be forgiven for asking himself, "Did I say something wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
Devlin has appeared a dozen times or more in this production of "Salome" in the 
past four years, but says he's still fascinated by his severed head. 
</P>
<P>
After the ax falls, he said, "I always stand offstage and watch the rest of the 
show. It's never lost its power, seeing the executioner lift my head out of the 
cistern. It's my face. It's a chilling sight."

THE COLD WINDS OF REALITY

By HARRY ANDERSON, Harry Anderson is a former Times staff writer who wrote the 
California &amp; Co. column. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Oh, what a time we had in the 1980s! In Southern California, the value of our 
homes more than doubled during the decade, and that added $150 billion to our 
collective wealth. Our personal income rose more than 60%. We increased the 
number of cars we own by 25%, and we spent almost 90% more at our retail 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about a party. No wonder the hangover we're suffering in 1990 seems so 
dreadful. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, everybody has become sober and more cautious -- especially here in 
the Southland, where the feeling of economic well-being is inextricably linked 
to the value of a home. If prices are rising rapidly, as they were for most of 
the 1980s, people make certain assumptions about their future and make other 
decisions about purchases and careers accordingly. But if prices are not 
rising, our sense of economic well-being starts to falter. 
</P>
<P>
These days, every neighborhood seems to have several houses for sale. Few are 
selling, and prices have been falling steadily for the past year. As a result, 
we're all feeling less rich, less secure and less carefree. 
</P>
<P>
And that feeling, more than any other, can play a large part in turning our 
current slowdown into a deep recession. 
</P>
<P>
The fundamental underpinning of the Southern California economy is the 
single-family home and its pricing, according to a report issued earlier this 
year by the Wall Street investment firm of Salomon Bros. Because of the huge 
amount of new wealth generated by the home price run-up of the 1980s, people 
were able to leverage themselves and increase their standard of living by means 
of mortgages and home equity loans. 
</P>
<P>
"Therefore," the Salomon Bros. report prophetically concluded, "any hiccup in 
house prices could reduce economic activity and affect a broad base of people." 
</P>
<P>
What this means, in its simplest terms, is that people can no longer count on 
their homes to be their best investment. The expectation that a home in 
California is the safest, surest way to make money is dwindling. So now what 
should you do? 
</P>
<P>
The best advice may be simply not to panic. 
</P>
<P>
In California, this may sound like heresy, but a house is meant to be lived in, 
not traded like a share of stock. Its purpose is to shelter you from the 
elements, not make you a millionaire. People in many other parts of the nation 
have no expectation of selling their homes for huge profits. Unfortunately, we 
do. 
</P>
<P>
The realization that homes may no longer be such a great investment, according 
to some experts, may actually help Southern Californians seek new and better 
places to invest their money. And that process may refocus our attention on 
solid investment principles, the type taught in beginning economics classes: A 
share of stock is only as valuable as the company that issues it, for example, 
and the bigger the potential profit, the higher the risk. And so on. 
</P>
<P>
For some people, particularly in go-go Southern California, the rules of Econ 
101 were suspended in the 1980s. We heard about the unending flood of money 
from abroad, driving up our real estate and commercial markets and making every 
investment here a sure thing. We heard that growth made the Golden State 
recession-proof. 
</P>
<P>
Forget it. 
</P>
<P>
For at least the next few years, California will be a very slow growing place, 
and many of its biggest industries -- particularly aerospace and construction 
-- will be cutting back. That means a lot of well-paying jobs may disappear. 
Recessions in other world economies, notably Japan, are likely to slow the 
influx of foreign investment. Unlike other housing booms in California, that of 
the 1980s was fueled in large measure by foreign money; and if it disappears, 
the current slowdown could be much more severe than earlier busts. 
</P>
<P>
Even if we avoid a recession according to the classic definition, we won't 
avoid considerable economic pain and slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of all this, our personal investment strategies may start to look 
much more like those of our parents and grandparents. Saving a healthy portion 
of our income may be the safest, surest way to build wealth. Slow, 
unspectacular and boring, perhaps, but solid and dependable. It is an 
investment that depends on no outside forces, unlike home prices. 
</P>
<P>
Investing a portion of those savings in a variety of things -- some stocks, 
some mutual funds, some real estate, some bonds -- may protect us from losing 
big if any one thing goes sour. Again, not very exciting; the adrenaline isn't 
pumping. 
</P>
<P>
This dose of reality may be hard for some to accept, particularly those who 
rode the crest of California's economic boom in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
But those who accept the new realities and invest according to the 
tried-and-true rules of Econ 101 are those most likely to do well as we sober 
up in the 1990s.

John Owen did a lot of simple things right. 
</P>
<P>
When his company started a 401(k) plan, a tax-deferred retirement savings 
program, he signed up and contributed the maximum amount. He worked for a 
healthy company -- Union Bank -- and stayed there for 24 years. And, when he 
was younger, he put as much discretionary income as possible into mutual funds 
and real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Between Social Security, his pension, 401(k) plan and other investments, Owen, 
65, now says he's reasonably sure that he and his wife will be comfortable 
through retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to luxuriate in opulence and wealth, but we don't feel as if 
we are going to have to scrimp and starve either," Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
This level of comfort doesn't "just happen." Owen started investing and 
planning when he was about 35. If he'd started much later, Owen said he's not 
so sure he'd be in such good shape today. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, investment experts maintain that once you've hit age 55, the time for 
planning is nearly past. There are a few things you can do at this late stage, 
but it is certainly more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"After 55, most of your options revolve around the alternatives you have with 
the pension plan you are currently enrolled in," said Gregg Ritchie, partner at 
the accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick. "Generally, at this point, you are no 
longer looking for wealth accumulation. You are looking to conserve principal 
and live off the earnings." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, how you invest your money at this age is of paramount importance. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, the income you have to work with in retirement starts with what 
you've accrued in your company-sponsored pension plan, Ritchie said. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals usually will have to choose among three main methods of receiving 
these pension payments: a lump sum, monthly payments for the duration of the 
retiree's lifetime or monthly payments that continue for the duration of the 
lifetimes of both the retiree and spouse. 
</P>
<P>
Monthly payments under either the single or joint survivor plans are generally 
based on average life expectancies. So the best choice depends on your personal 
situation: whether you need monthly income, whether you are concerned about 
your spouse's ability to get by after you are gone and how long you expect to 
live. If you are in good health and your 95-year-old grandmother is still going 
strong, you might earn more money through the monthly payments than a lump sum. 
But if you were anxious to invest in something that required substantial 
amounts of cash, you might prefer to take your money all at once. 
</P>
<P>
From a tax standpoint, lump sum payments are relatively less attractive than 
previously because the 1986 tax act limited income averaging. Now, most newly 
retiring wage earners can average their income only over five-year periods, 
compared to 10 years under the previous law. In general, financial planners 
say, it makes sense from a tax standpoint to take a lump sum distribution only 
if declaring one-fifth of the amount as annual income would still keep you 
below the 28% tax bracket. 
</P>
<P>
Those who opt for lump-sum payments are best advised to invest the proceeds 
conservatively, added Robert M. Coleman, a certified financial planner with 
Coleman Financial Planning Group in Pasadena. Treasury bills, certificates of 
deposit, highly rated municipal bonds and money market accounts are probably 
the best investment options because they are comparatively safe and provide 
relatively steady monthly income. 
</P>
<P>
Although some other investments pay higher rates of interest, retired investors 
need to be cautious because they have little hope of replacing money lost 
through bad investments, Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
And investors should not be fooled by promoters. A higher investment return 
always means a greater risk. 
</P>
<P>
Older investors are well-advised to use Treasury bills and bonds as their 
standard for the safest investment possible. Rates of return exceeding Treasury 
rates are usually riskier, but returns lower than Treasury rates are not 
necessarily safer. 
</P>
<P>
To determine the safety of an investment, find out if the principal is 
government guaranteed. If someone else guarantees the investment, make sure you 
have the guarantee in writing and you are confident of the backer's financial 
strength. As a final check, always ask yourself, "If this is such a great deal, 
why is it being offered to me?" Is the promoter a personal friend who has your 
best interests at heart? If not, and a high return is "virtually guaranteed," 
why wouldn't the promoter just borrow money and invest in it for himself? 
</P>
<P>
Not every retiree has money to invest, and many find they need cash to meet the 
escalating cost of living. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners with accumulated equity can tap it as a source of capital. Choices 
include selling the home and moving into smaller, less expensive quarters, or 
taking advantage of the new "reverse mortgages," a type of a loan specifically 
designed for house-rich but cash-poor older folks. 
</P>
<P>
In a reverse mortgage, the lender makes monthly payments to homeowners based on 
the value of their houses. The bank is repaid when the homeowner -- or most 
likely his heirs -- sells the house. The amount of the loan and monthly 
payments depend on the borrower's age and the appraised value of the home. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the obvious benefits, these loans have drawbacks, which include high 
fees and, in most cases, high interest rates, which makes them most attractive 
only to very old homeowners with substantial equity in their homes. Moreover, 
they are offered only on a limited basis in most states. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, many financial planners say most homeowners are better off simply 
selling their homes and taking advantage of a one-time tax break that allows 
them to keep $125,000 of the profit tax-free. 
</P>
<P>
Estate planning is also a major concern for most investors in this age group 
who want to ensure that their survivors receive as much as possible with as 
little hassle as possible. 
</P>
<P>
If you are affluent, you might consider giving away part of your estate early. 
Under current federal rules, you are allowed to give away up to $10,000 per 
person per year without triggering a special tax. It is particularly advisable 
to give away assets that are likely to appreciate significantly before you die, 
Ritchie said. 
</P>
<P>
Living trusts, which hold assets in trust for your survivors, are also a good 
idea. Although they do not save on taxes, they save heirs from probate costs 
and delays. It does, of course, cost money to transfer your assets into the 
trust. But, in many cases, the cost is far less than probate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TIPS 
</P>
<P>
* Take advantage of tax rules for older Americans. Homeowners age 55 and older 
can sell their homes and take advantage of a one-time tax break that allows 
them to keep $125,000 of the profit tax-free. 
</P>
<P>
* Use Treasure bills and bonds as the standard for the safest investment 
possible. Rates of return exceeding Treasury rates are usually riskier, but 
returns lower than Treasury rates are not necessarily safer. 
</P>
<P>
* Look into the possibility of a living trust. It won't save on taxes, but it 
can save your heirs probate costs and delays.

<P>
Jeannette DeWyze and Steve Wolfe have been married 16 years. They have two 
children, a house in San Diego and two thriving careers. But every month, they 
sit down, add up their expenses and split them in half. They have never had a 
joint bank account. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Williams and Ron Thompson were married last year. They live in the 
condominium in Los Angeles that she bought before they married. She pays for 
their food and clothes. She put his name on her savings account. But his money 
goes into his business. 
</P>
<P>
"Household expenses? Not my problem, baby," mused Ron, an artist and general 
contractor who, like his wife, asked not to be identified by his real name. 
"This is a little early 1990s male chauvinism." 
</P>
<P>
There are few rules left governing how couples handle their assets. The women's 
movement and the divorce rate have put an end to that. Some merge everything, a 
few merge nothing. And more and more, couples alight on some murky middle 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, it happens haphazardly. They marry in their thirties with a modern-day 
dowry of bank accounts, investments and careers. Out of habit, they may start 
off keeping things separate. But they soon mingle them, all too often with 
little or no thought. 
</P>
<P>
The consequences of their non-decisions can be dire. If the marriage ends, a 
spouse can lose more than his shirt. Yet financial planners and marriage 
counselors say they are struck by a common theme: how much money matters and 
how little it is discussed or understood. 
</P>
<P>
"Money is critical in our marriages," said Jean Flannigan, a psychotherapist in 
West Los Angeles. "I think it is the single most important symbol of the 
underlying issues. We project our psyche, or our soul, onto money." 
</P>
<P>
"People will share intimate information about their sex life with their best 
friend, but they won't share their finances," said Rose Greene, a financial 
planner in Santa Monica. "It is the most private subject, and it has the most 
amount of shame associated with it." 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when our hang-ups perhaps mattered less. Men made money and 
most women didn't. Couples married young, without houses, investments, children 
from previous marriages. They pooled everything. After all, hadn't they married 
for life? 
</P>
<P>
But these days, most women work. Some earn more than their husbands or derive 
self-esteem from being self-supporting. Many couples marry later, in their 
thirties and forties, bringing wealth from an earlier life. And half of all 
marriages end in divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Contemplating breakup, therefore, has become a necessary evil. Otherwise, 
ex-partners can find themselves fleeced -- their hard-earned assets split 50-50 
under community property laws or passed on, inadvertently, to a surviving 
spouse's children from a previous marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Under California's community property system, money earned through either 
spouse's work during the marriage becomes community property. If the marriage 
ends, those earnings must be served up for division under the terms of a 
divorce settlement. 
</P>
<P>
But assets acquired by either spouse before the marriage can be held as 
separate property -- not subject to division in a divorce -- as long as an 
absolute separation is maintained and there is no intentional or inadvertent 
"commingling" of assets. 
</P>
<P>
According to financial planners, more and more couples are keeping at least 
some property separate, especially in second marriages. Some do it because they 
have stopped believing that marriage is permanent; others do it to protect 
their children's inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
Many hold their house jointly, splitting the mortgage payments. Investments 
from before the marriage remain separate. They set up separate and joint bank 
accounts and credit cards. Only over time do they begin making joint 
investments and "merging." 
</P>
<P>
What is the best way? 
</P>
<P>
Most financial planners insist it is impossible to generalize; any financial 
arrangement must be tailored to the couple in question. If there is one rule, 
they say, it's that couples should talk about money in advance. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it has to do not necessarily with just protecting the assets but 
protecting the egos," said Alan Ungar, a certified financial planner in 
Calabasas. "It's much less a financial planning decision than it is an 
emotional one." 
</P>
<P>
Rose Greene and Carol Rabaut have been lovers for 12 years. Rose has kept her 
inherited assets in her own name. But the two women share a lot -- a house in 
West Los Angeles, a car, two dogs, a cat and an explicit agreement on how they 
would divide things if they split up. 
</P>
<P>
"I think some people mistake the way they hold assets with the degree of 
commitment," said Greene, a financial analyst, who sees in her job the damage 
wrought by what she calls indiscriminate merging. "I don't think I love Carol 
one iota less because I choose to hold assets in my own name." 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, are wary of such separateness. They fear it symbolizes bad 
faith. Some say they would never marry a man who asked that they sign a 
prenuptial agreement; indeed, weddings have been called off at the last minute 
over that issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm certainly suspicious of people who really keep things separate," said 
Sarah Williams, the 41-year-old television executive who pays all of her 
husband's living expenses. "I mean, joining funds is like the least of the 
commitment to joining your lives together." 
</P>
<P>
And a few, like Jeannette DeWyze, prefer to keep everything totally separate. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in the early years of my marriage I was very concerned about 
preserving my own autonomy within the union," said DeWyze, a 37-year-old 
writer. "I guess it was always important for me to feel I could make it on my 
own outside of marriage." 
</P>
<P>
"It just fit us, and our psychological makeup," she said. "It's only from other 
people's reactions that I get some idea of how weird people think it is." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TIPS 
</P>
<P>
* Couples should talk about money in advance because the consequences of 
non-decisions can be dire. Ex-partners can find their hard-earned assets split 
50-50 under community property laws or passed on, inadvertently, to a surviving 
spouse's children from a previous marriage. 
</P>
<P>
* Under California's community property system, money earned through either 
spouse's work during the marriage becomes community property. If the marriage 
ends, those earnings must be served up for division under the terms of a 
divorce settlement. 
</P>
<P>
* Assets acquired by either spouse before the marriage can be held as seperate 
property-not subject to division in a divorce-as long as an absolute separation 
is maintained and there is no intentional or inadvertent "commingling" of 
assets.

<TEXT>
<P>
You don't have to wait until your paycheck bounces to find out if your company 
is getting into financial trouble. And you don't have to quit if it is. 
</P>
<P>
During an economic downturn, many firms tighten their belts, take a hard look 
at costs, see sales slipping. Take heart: More often than not, firms weather 
these tough times. But there are still warning signs that indicate that things 
are indeed in bad shape, and you need to know what they are early enough to 
decide if you should bail out. 
</P>
<P>
What are the red flags? Experts break them into three basic categories: Dead 
giveaways, leading indicators and what one business professor calls "little 
nuances." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dead Giveaways 
</P>
<P>
* Becoming a "slow payer" to trade vendors. 
</P>
<P>
"When an employer who used to pay bills at 30 days starts stretching those 
payables to 45 and 60 days, that's an indication of real problems with cash 
flow," says Ronald S. Orr, a partner in the insolvency practice at Gibson, Dunn 
&amp; Crutcher in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
How do you find out if your boss is starting to sit on payables? 
</P>
<P>
If you're in a position of hiring the vendors but aren't responsible for 
writing the checks, it will probably be you whom they call to complain. 
</P>
<P>
Or network inside your company to see if there's a cash bind. The rate at which 
receivables (what customers owe your company) are paid is usually about the 
same as the rate the company pays its bills. In other words, no money in, no 
money out. 
</P>
<P>
* Debt load. 
</P>
<P>
When a company doesn't have the funds to pay loans, it's got problems. If you 
work for a publicly held firm, it's easy to find out what the debt situation 
is. Go to the business library at a local university -- UCLA has a particularly 
comprehensive one -- and do some research in Standard &amp; Poor's or Moody's. 
</P>
<P>
"When a company's debt rating falls below investment grade, look out," says 
Dick Levin, the Phillip Hettleman professor of business at the University of 
North Carolina in Chapel Hill. Typically, a rating below C may indicate 
mounting problems. 
</P>
<P>
* Layoffs and firings. 
</P>
<P>
This is an obvious one: Your company isn't making the money it needs to pay its 
people. 
</P>
<P>
* A stock price that is falling like a rock. 
</P>
<P>
If investors and analysts are growing wary of your company, maybe you should be 
too. 
</P>
<P>
* High-ranking management defections. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the people in the second tier," says R. Emmett Jones, a certified 
public accountant and teacher in the business department at Mendocino College 
in Ukiah, Calif. "They are high up enough to have a view of the real financial 
position of the firm, but they don't have everything at stake; it's not their 
whole life." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leading Indicators 
</P>
<P>
* Sales and marketing staff defections. 
</P>
<P>
"They know when competitors are starting to get your customers and they know 
when your market share is starting to slide," Jones says. 
</P>
<P>
* Insiders selling stock instead of buying. 
</P>
<P>
This information is readily available in the financial press. If you start to 
see a lot of your officers and directors selling big batches of their holdings, 
it may mean that they know something you don't. 
</P>
<P>
* Freezes in wages and hiring. 
</P>
<P>
This is an early warning that your boss is trying to cut personnel costs. The 
next step might be a dead giveaway: layoffs and firing. 
</P>
<P>
* The founder kicks himself upstairs and brings someone else in to run the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Your boss may just want to retire and go fishing, or he may realize that things 
have gotten out of control and he needs help desperately. This move is 
especially indicative when it leads to: 
</P>
<P>
* A striking change in the "personality" or management style of your company. 
</P>
<P>
When a firm goes from paternalistic (lots of company parties, Christmas cards 
from the boss, pats on the back) to hard-nosed and uptight, watch out. Dick 
Levin says a sudden spate of "save the paper clips memos" are clues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Nuances 
</P>
<P>
None of these by themselves mean anything. Taken together and accompanied by 
some of the more tangible signs of trouble, they may mean trouble. 
</P>
<P>
* Cutbacks in continuing education for employees. 
</P>
<P>
* Cutbacks in advertising. 
</P>
<P>
This is a quick-fix place to save when cash is tight, although most experts 
agree that a firm in trouble should probably advertise more, not less. 
</P>
<P>
* No new machinery; not fixing existing machinery when it breaks until 
absolutely necessary. 
</P>
<P>
* A general decay in the looks of the office or plant -- no fresh paint, dirty 
carpets, unkempt grounds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Bottom Line 
</P>
<P>
What can you do if all factors add up to problems? You need to weigh several 
factors before deciding to leave. 
</P>
<P>
First, don't panic. Bankruptcy law provides employees with "priority claims" on 
the company's assets of up to $2,000 per worker. Even if your firm goes under, 
you will probably get paid for work already done, and if your company is in a 
Chapter 11 reorganization, you can probably stay on staff with a fair amount of 
confidence. The firm needs you more than ever to emerge from the 
reorganization, according to Ronald Orr. 
</P>
<P>
Larger firms are required by federal law to provide a 60-day notice of plant 
closings or provide 60 days' pay to workers in an immediate plant closing. 
</P>
<P>
Running to the regulators, if the company is public, may strike you as a good 
idea, but think twice. "What did the company do wrong? It's not a crime to go 
bankrupt, and employees have a duty to the company," Orr says. "Unless you're 
sure that there's something illegal going on, such as with a government 
contract, you expose yourself to a lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
Dick Levin suggests making a list of pros and cons of leaving: Is your pension 
funded? If your company's pension plan is "qualified," and most are, you have 
some measure of protection. The federal Pension Benefit Guarantee Program backs 
up your pension much as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. backs up bank 
deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Can you take your pension with you? With some plans, you can. 
</P>
<P>
Are you marketable? Is this a temporary or permanent situation? 
</P>
<P>
If you do decide to leave, make sure that you're not jumping from the frying 
pan into the fire. If your entire industry is in a downturn, going across the 
street to a competitor may be a big mistake. At least your current employer may 
have some loyalty to you, and he is a known quantity. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that it's much easier to track information about publicly held 
firms. Although private firms' failure rate is about the same as public 
companies, you have to be a bit more enterprising to keep yourself informed.

THE HEART OF A GAMBLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Frankly," says Peter Lynch, the investment guru recently retired from guiding 
Fidelity Magellan, the nation's biggest mutual fund, "there is no way to 
separate investing from gambling." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there are many different ways to gamble. Just because you think 
it's a hoot to buy a lottery ticket once a week doesn't mean you have the 
stomach to sit down at the poker table with Amarillo Slim. Likewise, the fact 
that your neighbor moved to Bel Air after borrowing against her life insurance 
to invest in oil wells doesn't mean that you have to play such a high-stakes 
game. 
</P>
<P>
No question: you've got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em. But 
you've also got to know whether you want to be dealt in at all. This quiz can 
help you determine how much investment risk you're prepared to bear, bear 
market or bull. 
</P>
<P>
Answer the following questions, loosely based on risk assessments devised by 
Fidelity Investments, IDS Financial Services Inc., LFS Benefit Services, the 
Heaphy Trust Group and Donoghue's Moneyletter. A scoring key follows. 
</P>
<P>
1. How old are you? 
</P>
<P>
a. Under 35. 
</P>
<P>
b. 35 to 49. 
</P>
<P>
c. 50 to 64. 
</P>
<P>
d. Over 65. 
</P>
<P>
2. When making investment choices, I am most concerned about... 
</P>
<P>
a. Keeping even with inflation. 
</P>
<P>
b. Getting rich quick. 
</P>
<P>
c. Not losing my shirt. 
</P>
<P>
d. Adding to my wealth so I can afford more of the things I need or want. 
</P>
<P>
3. When the financial markets become erratic, I... 
</P>
<P>
a. Put all my money into a savings account so I don't have to worry about it. 
b. Just don't understand what is happening. 
</P>
<P>
c. Watch knowingly, aware that what goes down must come up, and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
d. Figure there are opportunities in the making. After all, you can't get rich 
without taking chances. 
</P>
<P>
4. When the stock market crashed in October, 1987, I... 
</P>
<P>
a. Sold my stocks and mutual funds and vowed never again to put my money in 
anything more risky than a candy machine. 
</P>
<P>
b. Took my broker's advice and started buying. 
</P>
<P>
c. Was unaffected; I don't invest in the market. 
</P>
<P>
d. Was paralyzed by fear, did nothing, and saw most of my investments 
eventually recover. 
</P>
<P>
5. I borrow money... 
</P>
<P>
a. Only to buy a car or home. 
</P>
<P>
b. To invest in deals that seem likely to make the money grow. 
</P>
<P>
c. Never. 
</P>
<P>
6. My buddy Jack wants me to join him on a road trip to Las Vegas. My wife and 
I had planned to use the $800 we'd saved to buy a new couch. I... 
</P>
<P>
a. Decide with my wife to risk $200 at the tables in hopes we'll be able to buy 
a nicer couch than we'd planned. 
</P>
<P>
b. Thank Jack for the invitation but explain that I have no money to spare. 
</P>
<P>
c. Empty the back account, figuring I'll be able to redo the whole living room 
with my casino winnings. 
</P>
<P>
7. On Feb. 1, I bought a mutual fund at $20 per share after it had been 
recommended by Forbes, Business Week, Louis Rukeyser and my rich uncle. On 
March 1, the fund was selling for $15 a share. I... 
</P>
<P>
a. Cancelled my magazine subscriptions, sent a black rose to my uncle and sold 
the shares at a 25% loss. 
</P>
<P>
b. Asked my uncle to hold my hand while I waited for the fund to rebound. 
</P>
<P>
c. Bought more. If the fund was a good deal at $20, it was that much better at 
$15. 
</P>
<P>
8. My neighbor Arnie, a software engineer, says his company's new spread-sheet 
program makes Lotus 1-2-3 look like the Rosetta Stone. He's buying as much 
stock as he can and says I should, too. I invest: 
</P>
<P>
a. Nothing. Everybody touts his employer's stock. 
</P>
<P>
b. One month's salary. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. 
</P>
<P>
c. Three months' salary. You can never get enough of a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
d. Five months' salary. If Arnie's going to be able to put a pool in his 
backyard, I am, too. 
</P>
<P>
9. I've lost $500 playing roulette in Vegas. To win it back, I'm prepared to 
wager... 
</P>
<P>
a. $1,000. I'm feeling lucky. 
</P>
<P>
b. $500. I at least have to cover my losses. 
</P>
<P>
c. $100. Small steps first, big steps later. 
</P>
<P>
d. Nothing. This obviously isn't my night. 
</P>
<P>
10. My company has just established a new savings plan, promising to match my 
payroll deductions up to 5% of my salary. I... 
</P>
<P>
a. Don't sign up, because a few dollars a week will never add up to much. 
</P>
<P>
b. Sign up for the maximum deduction, figuring that the worst I can do is 
double my money. 
</P>
<P>
c. Request information on how my money will be invested, so I can determine if 
I can better invest the same amount elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
11. Little Tillie, our first child, has just been born, and we want her to be 
the first member of the family to attend USC. Knowing how much this will cost, 
we take the cash gifts she receives and buy... 
</P>
<P>
a. Shares in an aggressively managed growth mutual fund. The market may bounce 
up and down, but she's bound to be way ahead in 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
b. Savings bonds. A sure thing is the only place for Tillie's college fund. 
</P>
<P>
c. Shares in a traditional growth-and-income mutual fund. We wat the money to 
appreciate, but not with a lot of risk. 
</P>
<P>
d. Items Tillie needs immediately, such as clothes and toys. We can start 
saving next month. 
</P>
<P>
12. The head of the President's Council of Economic Advisers says interest 
rates could go up in the next few months, though the signs aren't clear. I am 
just about ready to buy a house, but even at current rates, I can barely afford 
the mortgage on the home of my dreams. I... 
</P>
<P>
a. Buy now, with an adjustible-rate mortgage. The lower initial rate allows me 
to qualify, and if the payments go up next year, I can worry about it then. 
</P>
<P>
b. Start looking for a less expensive home. 
</P>
<P>

0-25 points: You don't know a bond from a bongo. Before you can even begin to 
assess your willingness to take risks with your money, you need to educate 
yourself about investing options. Visit the public library and pick up 
"Marshall Loeb's 1990 Money Guide," "Kiplinger's Make Your Money Grow" or the 
"Complete Guide to Managing Your Money" from Consumer Reports Books. 
</P>
<P>
26-35 points: You are extremely averse to risk. You will want to put your money 
where it is safest: in certificates of deposit, money market funds, bond mutual 
funds or growth and income mutual funds. Your money won't grow very quickly in 
up markets, but you'll be reassured by the knowledge that, ultimately, the 
tortoise outlasted the hare. 
</P>
<P>
36-49 points: You are an astute investor who weighs risks and rewards and seeks 
to maximize your gain without taking unwarranted gambles. You will want to 
diversify your investment portfolio with stocks, bonds, mutual funds and a cash 
position. You also may be willing to seek out partnership opportunities through 
a knowledgeable, trusted financial adviser. 
</P>
<P>
50-60 points: You are an aggressive risk-taker, as apt to go bungee jumping as 
to make a speculative investment in a start-up company. You may be willing to 
invest in growth stocks, growth funds and even chancier ventures. Be warned: 
the higher the return you seek, the greater your risk of losing your capital. 
But then you probably would just pick up the pieces and start again.

UP IN THE AIR ON THE COST OF HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Across the country, desperate sellers are hatching strange and creative plots 
to ensnare prospective buyers: special financing, decorator allowances, 
Caribbean trips. One hopeful seller even appeared recently in a major newspaper 
polishing his bait -- a Rolls-Royce that would be thrown in with his 
$1.5-million house. 
</P>
<P>
As the number of anxious and motivated sellers grows, it would seem an ideal 
time for buyers to jump in. Indeed, both prices and interest rates are 
dropping. But so are the numbers of home sales. 
</P>
<P>
So where are the buyers? 
</P>
<P>
Initially, their dearth was attributed to the astronomical prices, which many 
potential buyers simply couldn't afford. But as the latest housing downturn 
continues, the reasons have become more complex. Economic uncertainty makes 
consumers more cautious, and the threat of a recession and the Persian Gulf 
crisis have created ample uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, some buyers are waiting for prices to drop even further, a 
scenario many experts fully expect, and perhaps by as much as 20% in some 
areas. But it may be more than that. The traditional, frenetic "buy now, before 
it's too late" psychology has been replaced by a more cautious approach as 
buyers catch their breath and ponder a decision. 
</P>
<P>
Some have decided to rent until the current housing problems blow over. Others 
are putting off a move-up purchase until they are more confident about the 
economy -- and their ability to sell their own house. 
</P>
<P>
Yet if it's a newly constructed house you want, this is the time to buy, say 
the experts. Once the bargains are gone, builders are unlikely to be caught 
again in the overbuilding trap. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the brightest aspect to the decline in home prices is the resulting 
expansion in the pool of potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
For first time in years, the California Assn. of Realtors' affordability index 
is improving. In June, the latest figures available, 18% of the state's 
households could afford a house at the median price of $194,821. A year 
earlier, only 14% could afford the median-priced house, which cost $199,441. 
The median is the point where half the homes cost more than that price and half 
cost less. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, 15% of the households could afford the median price 
house of $215,029. A year earlier, only 10% could buy at the median figure of 
$220,253. 
</P>
<P>
But, so far, the increasing affordability of homes is not stimulating buyers. 
Statewide, sales of existing single-family homes are down 14.9% from a year 
earlier, according to the latest figures. Sales of condominiums were down 9.3%. 
Meanwhile, sales of newly constructed homes are faring even worse. 
</P>
<P>
According to the National Assn. of Home Builders, sales of new homes dropped 
41% from August, 1989, to August, 1990, in the Western region of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
The situation offers some bargains for the right buyers, particularly to a 
first-time buyer who doesn't have to worry about selling another property and 
buyers who must act immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are a qualified buyer, there are motivated sellers," advised John 
Flynn, a partner in Arthur Andersen &amp; Co.'s real estate group. "I don't 
know that waiting will get you a better deal, if you are willing to bargain and 
negotiate." 
</P>
<P>
This counsel is probably most true for buyers considering newly constructed 
homes. Although most expect the housing slump to continue another year or two, 
inventories of new houses will not last that long, said David L. Knowles, 
managing director of Salomon Bros., the New York investment house. 
</P>
<P>
New regulations contained in the savings and loan bailout restrict the amount 
an institution can lend to a single builder, cutting off a traditional source 
of financing for many developers. And, because builders are having trouble 
borrowing, they will build less. 
</P>
<P>
"The question of whether or not to buy, at least for new construction, is 
simple," Flynn said. "Buy now, because builders are not going to build more for 
awhile." 
</P>
<P>
The situation is more complicated for the move-up buyer because, for those in 
the game, real estate is really just one big chain reaction. In order to buy, 
most people must first sell. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of houses at or below the median price tend to be firmer than those 
above it. And houses in the lower end of the market usually sell faster because 
they have a larger pool of prospective buyers. These days, as the prices goes 
up, houses stay on the market longer and usually sell at a bigger discount. 
</P>
<P>
Experts expect prices of most resale housing to continue their downward spiral 
for 12 to 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll see another 10% to 20% (drop) in the next year to year and a half," 
said Lawrence A. Krause, chairman of a financial planning firm in San Francisco 
that bears his name. "Times are going to be tougher. It is naive to think that 
your area will be immune." 
</P>
<P>
Krause advises that buying a house only makes economic sense these days if you 
plan to live in it for several years. Otherwise, you should rent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"And if you (already) own, remember that it shouldn't make a whole lot of 
difference to you if the value of your house goes up or down a little," he 
added. "If it were listed on the New York Stock Exchange and lost five points, 
would you sell it?"

HOBBY INCOME CAN BE TAXING; 
</P>
<P>
THE IRS VERDICT ON WHETHER AN ACTIVITY IS BUSINESS OR PLEASURE IS SOMETIMES A 
JUDGMENT CALL.

<P>
American taxpayers who mix business with pleasure have to be careful not to get 
tangled up with the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
As old as that precept may be, it carries an up-to-date message for 
moonlighters who earn income from a hobby or other sideline activity. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the endeavor in question is composing greeting-card verses, breeding 
show dogs or growing vegetables in your back yard, Uncle Sam has a claim on any 
proceeds it brings in. 
</P>
<P>
The size of that claim may well depend on whether the enterprise qualifies as a 
business or is deemed a not-for-profit hobby. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of a bona fide business, taxpayers are normally allowed to write 
off all expenses, even if to do so produces a loss that reduces their other 
taxable income. 
</P>
<P>
With a hobby, by contrast, expenses can be deducted only against income from 
the activity itself. "Hobby losses are considered non-deductible personal 
losses," point out the authors of the just-published 1991 edition of "J.K. 
Lasser's Your Income Tax." 
</P>
<P>
Just how do you distinguish between the two? Through legislation and rulings 
over the years, a series of standards has evolved. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, any venture that shows a net profit for three out of five 
consecutive years is presumed to establish itself as a business in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
If you breed or train horses for racing or show, the requirement is two years 
out of seven. 
</P>
<P>
In the event that those criteria aren't met, notes the United &amp; Babson 
Investment Report, a Boston-based advisory service, "the status of an activity 
is judged on a case-by-case basis, since the circumstances and facts of each 
are unique." 
</P>
<P>
Among the yardsticks that can be applied: Is the venture operated in a 
businesslike manner, with a substantial amount of expertise, expenditure of 
time and effort and diligent record-keeping? 
</P>
<P>
Does it hold out the prospect of some reasonable return on investment? Is there 
a practical basis for hope that assets used in the activity will increase in 
value? 
</P>
<P>
And, conversely, does it involve spending a lot of time in pursuits that are 
recognized as sources of recreation and personal enjoyment? Can the money it 
brings in make a real difference in your personal financial affairs? 
</P>
<P>
"While none of these tests alone would qualify an activity as a hobby, the 
general picture that evolved from all the tests would," United &amp; Babson 
says. 
</P>
<P>
With all the effort that has been devoted to defining the difference between 
hobby and business, the verdict often comes down to a judgment call.

PLANNING FOR YOUR LEISURE YEARS CAN GENERATE MANY PERPLEXING QUESTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps one of the biggest myths in our society is that your retirement years 
are easy. Sure, quitting your job may not require much effort, but the rest of 
it -- such as knowing how to manage and invest savings wisely and how to 
negotiate the maze of Social Security regulations -- is hard. Doubts and 
uncertainity persist. And answers are hard to come by. 
</P>
<P>
Here are five retirement questions most often raised by readers of "Money 
Talk," a question-and-answer column regularly appearing in the Sunday edition 
of The Times' Business section. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I will be retiring in a few months and have opted to take a lump sum pension 
payment of about $200,000. What steps can be taken to shelter this distribution 
from immediate taxation? This is a sizable portion of what I will be depending 
on for income during my retirement. -- R.T. 
</P>
<P>
A. Basically, you have two alternatives. You may put your entire pension 
distribution into a tax-deferred individual retirement account or you may pay 
taxes on it now and probably take advantage of a special income averaging 
benefit available to many in this age bracket. 
</P>
<P>
Which is the better choice? Torrance financial planner Thomas Gau believes that 
you would be far better off rolling the pension account into an IRA. But let's 
walk through the situation and explain why. 
</P>
<P>
If you turned age 50 before Jan. 1, 1986, you are eligible to take advantage of 
a special 10-year income averaging, a tax benefit that essentially treats the 
$200,000 lump sum distribution as though it had been received over 10 years. 
Gau estimates that even using this tax break, you would be liable for about 
$50,000 in state and federal taxes for the year, leaving you with about 
$150,000 to invest for retirement. Remember too that earnings from this 
investment are still taxable; it is just the principal on which the tax has 
been paid. 
</P>
<P>
Gau argues that if you rolled his pension distribution into an IRA and invested 
it wisely, you could withdraw whatever you needed from the account and pay 
taxes only on that amount. Gau notes that many retirees are in a low tax 
bracket, which means that less of their pension distribution goes to taxes. 
</P>
<P>
As a rule of thumb, Gau says that pension distributions in excess of $100,000 
should not be subjected to the special 10-year income averaging, but rather 
should be rolled into IRAs. "Unless you need the money right away for some 
reason, the 10-year averaging doesn't make sense for distributions over 
$100,000," he says. "Why pay the taxes right away when you can defer it and 
probably pay less." 
</P>
<P>
Q. If a woman has been married more than 10 years to two different husbands, 
does she have a choice of which man's benefits to claim for ex-spouse Social 
Security payments? If she were married to the second husband for less than 10 
years, may she still claim benefits from the first marriage if it lasted more 
than 10 years? What are the payment levels: Are her benefits based on a 
percentage of the taxes paid during the marriage, or are the benefits based on 
the total amount of taxes paid by the former spouse into Social Security? -- 
A.R. 
</P>
<P>
A. A divorced person who was married at least 10 years to the same spouse is 
entitled to claim Social Security benefits on the ex-spouse's account. This 
applies equally to men and women, although most ex-spouses claiming the benefit 
have been women. 
</P>
<P>
If the ex-spouse is alive, the claimant must be at least 62. At 62, the 
ex-spouse is entitled to 37.5% of the wage earner's benefits. If the ex-spouse 
waits until 65 to claim benefits, the payment is 50% of the wage earner's 
benefits. The wage earner need not be receiving benefits in order for the 
ex-spouse to claim his or hers -- so long as the couple has been divorced at 
least two years. (This last point varies substantially from the qualification 
criteria for married couples, which do require that the primary wage earner be 
receiving benefits in order for the spouse to receive spousal benefits.) 
</P>
<P>
If the wage earner is dead, the ex-spouse is considered equivalent to a widow 
or widower. He or she may claim benefits at 60, and, at this age, is entitled 
to receive 71.5% of what the wage earner would have received. The percentage 
increases until reaching the full 100% if the ex-spouse is age 65 when benefits 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, the ex-spouse and the current spouse are both treated as the widow 
or widower, and both receive a full 100% of the wage earner's benefits; they do 
not split the benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Ex-spouse benefits are based on the total contributions made by the wage earner 
during his or her working career, not just those made throughout the duration 
of the marriage. People who have been married more than once, for longer than 
10 years, may claim benefits against the ex-spouse with the largest Social 
Security account. And a divorced person who was remarried for less than 10 
years may claim benefits on the account of the first spouse. However, as long 
as a person remains remarried, he or she may not claim benefits on the account 
of the ex-spouse. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, one point that bears repeating: Benefits paid to an ex-spouse in no 
way reduce the amount available for the primary wage earner and his or her 
current family. They are entirely separate payments. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I have recently heard of something called a reverse mortgage. I own my home 
free and clear, and I would like to tap into my equity so I can have more money 
to enjoy my life. -- N.I. 
</P>
<P>
A. Reverse annuity mortgages were created in the late 1970s to help senior 
citizens who have substantial equities in their homes but need additional cash 
to meet their living expenses. Basically, these mortgages allow owners to tap 
into their equity without selling their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how they work. Typically a lending institution makes the homeowner a 
loan for up to 80% of its appraised value. After taking its loan fees and 
points up front, the institution then pays the homeowner the balance of the 
loan in equal monthly installments, minus accruing interest on the already 
dispersed funds, for as long as he continues living in the home. The loan -- 
actually the amount dispersed plus interest -- is repaid when the house is sold 
by the owner or his heirs. 
</P>
<P>
These open-ended loans are complicated because it's impossible to know how long 
the homeowner will continue to live in the house. If he stays just a brief 
time, the reverse mortgage proves a costly way for the elderly homeowner to 
pull equity out of the house, since loan fees and points on the full potential 
loan amount is assessed at the outset. However, if he stays a very long time, 
the lending institution stands to pay out more than the home may be worth. 
Because of this latter issue, several institutions offering reverse mortgages 
require that they share in any appreciation of the the borrower's home during 
the course of the loan. 
</P>
<P>
According to the American Assn. of Retired Persons, three private lenders 
currently offer reverse mortgages to California homeowners. They are: American 
Homestead in New Jersey, (800) 233-4762; Providential Home Income Plan in San 
Francisco, (800) 441-4428, and Capital Holding Co. in Kentucky, (800) 942-6550. 
Each lender offers a slightly different loan package, explains Bronwin Belling, 
a housing counselor for the AARP, so it is important for borrowers to carefully 
evaluate their choices before making a commitment. For example, Belling 
explained that with a $200,000 loan at 10%, monthly payments from the three 
lenders previously mentioned would range from $903 to $1,124, with 
substantially varying requirements and restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
For more information about reverse mortgages, send a self-addressed, stamped 
envelope to the Independent Living Resource Center, 70 Tenth St., San 
Francisco, Calif. 94103. Another source is the American Assn. of Retired 
Persons. Send a self-addressed, stamped envelop and ask for Home-Made Money,

</P>
<P>
Q. My friend's husband a few years ago died after retiring, and my friend was 
shocked to discover that his pension stopped with his death. Now my husband, 
who is also retired, is ill and is not recovering. How can I find out whether 
his pension ends with his death? Shouldn't there be laws to protect women like 
me? -- M.Y. 
</P>
<P>
A. First of all, there is a law now that provides just the sort of spousal 
protection that you are talking about. Under the Retirement Equity Act, which 
became effective in 1985, a spouse must consent to the type and terms of the 
pension plan a worker elects to receive at retirement. The law was designed to 
prevent just the type of horror your friend undoubtedly experienced when she 
learned that her husband's pension did not continue, even at a reduced rate, 
after his death. 
</P>
<P>
Is is entirely possible that this law became effective after your husband 
elected the terms of his pension. But you can still find out what those terms 
are. Simply contact the pension plan administrator at his former company. Also, 
our experts advise that it may be possible for your husband -- if he is not 
incompetent or completely incapacitated -- to change the terms of his pension 
payment. Again, you can check this through the company. 
</P>
<P>
Even if you're not at or near retirement, this is probably as good a time as 
any to check how your pension plan is structured. Do payments continue when you 
die? If so, at what level? Are you satisfied with the choices you made years 
ago, when retirement seemed as remote as the moon? If not, can you change them? 
Should you? This is not just an issue for older folks.

There was a time, not long ago, when it was still taboo to talk about money. 
The subject was right up there with race and class: pervasive, but unfit for 
polite dinner con versation. 
</P>
<P>
Then something happened. Things changed. And what I wanted to know was, when 
did it become OK to talk about money? Stranger still, how on earth did it come 
to seem mandatory? 
</P>
<P>
The answer turns out to have nettlesome implications. Like any right-minded 
moralist, I abhorred the Reagan-era obsession with precocious wealth and 
corporate success. BMWs give me emotional hives. Suspenders are the devil's 
plaything. All this talk of money makes me shudder. 
</P>
<P>
I still hate the acquisitive mentality. But I've come to believe that all the 
talk is something else again. I've come to believe the talk is -- dare I say 
it? -- a very good thing. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is simple. When nobody talked about money, there were really two 
kinds of people: those with so much dough it didn't need discussion, and those 
with so little there was nothing to discuss. 
</P>
<P>
Things are different now. An awful lot of people have a little money. Sure, the 
Reagan Administration made the rich richer at the expense of the poor and 
middle classes -- in some ways, with their complicity. But even if the 
concentration of American wealth has never stopped increasing, a huge middle 
class somehow sprang up. 
</P>
<P>
This vast bourgeoisie is a relatively modern product of everything from estate 
taxes to World War II to a nation increasingly made and descended of 
extraordinarily motivated immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, the investment opportunities of this middle class have exploded. 
</P>
<P>
Through mutual funds, the smallest savers have access to investment 
opportunities previously restricted -- by tradition, fees and secrecy -- to the 
rich. An article in this newspaper recently explained how someone with $1,000 
could easily assemble a diversified portfolio reaching from Treasury bills to 
gold. Another reported that money managers catering to the very rich don't 
particularly outperform funds open to any Joe or Jane Saver right off the 
street -- good news to the 23 million households investing in mutual funds, up 
400% in just a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does this help make capital markets efficient. It also makes them more 
democratic. What we have witnessed, in fact, in accelerating fashion since the 
Depression and with steps backward only in the 1980s, is the increasing 
democratization of money in America -- something we all favor in principle but 
don't always like in practice. 
</P>
<P>
Telling people not to talk or think about money is like telling slaves to wait 
for heaven in the afterlife, or schoolteachers not to form unions. The stupid 
fact is that money is indispensable, not only to survival but for the leisure 
to create laws, art and so forth. Civilization would dry up without the stuff. 
The miracle is not that we talk about it. It is that, for so long, we didn't. 
</P>
<P>
So when did all this change? My friend Joe Nocera, who is writing a history of 
personal finance, pinpoints a single year. In 1972, he notes, the money market 
mutual fund was born, which enabled the average saver to earn an unregulated, 
market return, and what was then Time Inc. created Money magazine, which 
"brought money out of the closet." 
</P>
<P>
The forces that got us all talking about money are manifold. Joe's favorite is 
inflation during the Nixon and Carter years. With prices and interest rates 
going haywire, these became a subject of obsessive concern. John Updike's 
"Rabbit Is Rich" captures the period beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
A related factor is the enormous increase in real estate prices in the past 
couple of decades. The deregulation of bank interest rates played a role, as 
did the astonishing bull stock market. 
</P>
<P>
The growth of personal credit was equally astonishing and important. Trusty old 
M1, the favorite money-supply measure of Econ 1A, was nearly destroyed as a 
meaningful figure by money market funds and a zillion credit cards. Remember 
the old saw about the tidal wave that might result if everyone in China jumped 
off a chair simultaneously? Well, imagine what would happen to the velocity of 
money if every middle-class American whipped out the plastic in his pocket and 
simultaneously charged it to the hilt. All of us now have the power to create 
money; we're like walking Federal Reserve Banks. 
</P>
<P>
Let's not forget women. The democratization of money included jobs for them, 
and increasingly, equal pay for equal work. Except for the odd paradox that all 
these new workers may have contributed to a price structure that makes two 
incomes seem mandatory, more women have become masters of their own finances. 
And since money is, to an unfortunate extent, destiny, they were suddenly 
masters of a lot more. 
</P>
<P>
Good for them. Good for everyone. If we have to hear a lot of boring talk about 
money, well, personal freedom is not without its modest price. Anyone who 
thinks we overlook the Bronte sisters because we're obsessing over money is 
crazy. Being poor certainly won't help Johnny read, success in school being 
correlated to family income. More important, shutting up about money won't make 
anyone better off.

LIZ SMITH: 'JUSTIFY MY LOVE' VIDEO FEATURES MADONNA'S NEW GUY

MADONNA IS in Paris getting ready to begin making the video of her new single, 
"Justify My Love." This is one of two fresh songs on her greatest-hits 
compilation titled "Immaculate Collection." 
</P>
<P>
The star co-wrote this song with Lenny Kravitz, a guy who knows a lot about 
controversial women. (He is wed to "Cosby" kid Lisa Bonet.) Madonna's husky 
rendition of the song isn't something one would get up and dance to -- recline 
to, maybe. "Justify My Love" is to be directed by Jean Baptiste Mondino, who 
put the blond one through her paces for the "Open Your Heart" video in which 
she played a peep-show dancer. 
</P>
<P>
The singer's new steady guy, Tony Ward, will have a prominent role in the 
video. He could be the reason Madonna's faction is saying that "Justify My 
Love" will be Madonna's "sexiest and most romantic video ever." But don't 
"they" always say something like that? All I know about Tony Ward is that he is 
like a taller, darker, sexier version of Sean Penn and said to be a very sweet 
person. 
</P>
<P>
SO, WHY, with all this plush hype, didn't Madonna show up at Glamour magazine's 
big "Ten Women of the Year" awards for 1990, or send a representative? Insiders 
claim it was because Glamour's art department retouched Madonna's teeth, 
filling in the gaps in their cover photo. And SHE didn't like that one bit. 
Glamour described the star as "personifying women's power of 
self-determination." You got that right. 
</P>
<P>
ANJELICA HUSTON is startlingly blond in her new movie, "The Grifters," and the 
dark beauty says she enjoys the change. She explains: "Wearing the blond wig 
immediately made me feel different. . . . As a blonde I got a kind of 'halo' 
effect. But I was a serious, no-nonsense blonde. Sometime though, I'd like to 
be one of those real fun blondes." 
</P>
<P>
"The Grifters" has some good word-of-mouth and opens for one week in December 
to make it eligible for the Academy Awards.
