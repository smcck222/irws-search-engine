An initiative asking the Seattle school board to halt busing of students to 
achieve racial balance was declared approved, by a margin of 50.4% to 49.6%, 
after absentee ballots were counted. The unofficial count in last Tuesday's 
election had it losing by 70 votes. The school board must vote on whether to 
implement the initiative. If it does, schools will receive about $4.5 million a 
year from sales taxes for "magnet" school programs designed to achieve 
voluntary integration. However, rights organizations have vowed to sue if the 
board does approve the initiative. No vote has been set.

Most of the 25,000 students at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst 
boycotted classes and several hundred of them set up picket lines around campus 
to protest repeated budget cuts in higher education. The students, joined by 
some professors, began picketing outside several academic buildings at 8 a.m. 
and said the strike will continue until the Legislature meets their demands for 
a progressive tax package and stops cuts in education funding, including no 
additional faculty or staff layoffs.

The House passed a bill to transfer a priceless collection of more than a 
million Indian artifacts from New York's Museum of the American Indian to the 
Smithsonian Institution for display in Washington and New York. It would create 
a Museum of the American Indian in the last available space on the Washington 
Mall and establish another museum in lower Manhattan. The bill stipulates that 
the Smithsonian, when possible, would return its collection of about 18,000 
Indian remains to their original tribes for burial.

Lettuce workers represented by the Teamsters at Bud Antle Inc. went back to 
work in Huron, Santa Maria and Salinas, ending an 18-day strike. Union workers 
voted nearly 10 to 1 to accept a new three-year contract with Antle that 
includes an 8-cent hourly pay increase and other benefits. Some 3,000 Teamsters 
workers struck the Bud Antle lettuce operations in the three areas on Oct. 26 
after rejecting the company's original contract offer. Bud Antle officials 
refused to comment on the new pact, but union officials said that while it did 
not increase the previously rejected wage proposal, the new pact did provide 
for improvement in work hours and other benefits. Union officials said the 
contract was approved by a 2,240-248 vote.

A new ordinance intended to prevent Coronado residents from storing 
recreational vehicles on city streets is so strict it requires police to 
impound big cars like Cadillacs and Lincolns, officials have found. The city 
law bars vehicles longer than 18 feet from parking on residential streets for 
more than three hours. City Council members passed the measure in response to 
numerous complaints about motor homes, considered a blight by many in this 
affluent town across the bay from San Diego. To show the city meant business, 
police have hauled off five RVs in the past month. Police Chief Jerry Boyd said 
that limousines "are longer than 18 feet, so I guess they are included in the 
ordinance."

JUDGE'S RULING CLEARS WAY FOR ROACHE TO RUN; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: A SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE SAID THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT CAPTAIN CANNOT 
BE PREVENTED BY DEPARTMENT POLICIES FROM OPPOSING HIS BOSS IN THE NEXT 
ELECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Sheriff's Capt. Jim Roache cannot be prevented from running against San Diego 
County Sheriff John Duffy by policies in the Sheriff's Department, a Superior 
Court judge ruled Monday, adding that the policies impose a "chilling effect" 
on potential political candidates and the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Philip D. Sharp also said that a second Sheriff's Department policy 
prohibiting employees from publicly criticizing Duffy or his department is 
unconstitutional because it essentially prevents Roache from conducting an 
effective campaign to unseat Duffy in next year's election. 
</P>
<P>
"This has such a chilling effect that he can't even be a candidate," the judge 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Roache, who did not attend the Monday afternoon court hearing, said the ruling 
all but clears the way for him to join three other prospective candidates in 
filing next year against Duffy, who, after 20 years as sheriff, is seeking an 
unprecedented sixth term. 
</P>
<P>
Roache said the decision now makes it "highly probable" that he will run for 
sheriff. He said he will probably make a formal announcement within a week. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not totally surprised by the decision," Roache said in a telephone 
interview, explaining that his lawyer and his own research had convinced him 
that Duffy's policy is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time for a change," Roache said. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy, who also did not attend the hearing, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
But his attorney, Dan Wallace, chief deputy in the county counsel's office, 
said that Duffy has all along indicated that he planned to waive the policies 
to allow Roache to campaign for sheriff and to publicly criticize the Sheriff's 
Department. But Wallace said that the matter is "very complex" and that Duffy 
simply had not had enough time to reverse the provisions. 
</P>
<P>
And he said that Roache, by bringing a lawsuit to force Duffy's hand, was 
actually engaging in political grandstanding. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of this hearing was to drum up publicity for Capt. Roache," 
Wallace said after the judge issued his rulings. "That's blatantly clear." 
</P>
<P>
He also downplayed the judge's choice of terms in saying the provisions imposed 
a chilling effect on Roache's constitutional rights, and he said he does not 
consider the judge's orders a rebuke of Duffy's management style. 
</P>
<P>
"This is language of art," Wallace said. ' "Chilling effect' is a common term 
in legal language. It's not a rebuke at all." 
</P>
<P>
But Everett Bobbitt, a private attorney representing Roache, said his client 
proceeded with the court case because he worried that Duffy might not waive the 
policy until the filing deadline next spring. If that happened, Bobbitt said, 
Duffy would be so far ahead of Roache in raising campaign funds that a Roache 
candidacy would be virtually fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
"Roache did everything under his power to get Duffy to change the policies," 
Bobbitt said after the hearing. "We were forced to court by Duffy." 
</P>
<P>
Bobbitt added that it would have been foolhardy for Roache, with almost 20 
years on the Sheriff's Department, to ignore the policies and campaign on 
Duffy's promise that they would be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you risk it on Sheriff Duffy's promise to change the rules?" Bobbitt 
asked. "Would you trust Sheriff Duffy?" 
</P>
<P>
He denied Wallace's contention that the lawsuit was a publicity ploy for Roache 
and said the judge was correct in describing the policies as having a chilling 
effect on First Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems so clear in this country that you can criticize public officials," 
Bobbitt said. "And he (Wallace) as a lawyer should recognize that himself. I 
would not have gone forward and represented someone who is violating the 
Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
At issue before the court were two separate departmental policies. 
</P>
<P>
The first was a provision that prohibits staff members from running against the 
incumbent sheriff, which the judge said "constituted a chilling effect, even 
though the sheriff has indicated an intention to revoke the archaic provision. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clearly unconstitutional. Mr. Roache should be entitled to relief under 
the law." 
</P>
<P>
The second issue dealt with a separate policy that prohibits staff members like 
Roache, who supervises the Lemon Grove station, from publicly criticizing Duffy 
or his Sheriff's Department. Roache maintained that this policy violated his 
right to free speech, and effectively gutted any serious campaign he might 
bring against the incumbent sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be construed that this policy prevents legitimate public debate for 
Mr. Roache concerning his views of the Sheriff's Department," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
The other likely candidates are former San Diego Police Chief Ray Hoobler, 
Escondido Police Chief Vince Jimno, and San Diego Deputy Police Chief Manuel 
Guaderrama.

JUDGES PROBE PROSECUTORS' CHOICES ON DRUG ARRESTS; 
</P>
<P>
ENFORCEMENT: DEFENSE LAWYERS CLAIM POLICE TARGET MINORITIES UNDER 'SCHOOLYARD' 
LAW. PROSECUTORS SAY OFFICERS GO WHERE PROBLEM IS GREATEST. 
</P>

Three federal judges sharply questioned prosecutors and defense lawyers Monday 
about claims that the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles has selectively 
targeted blacks and Latinos for prosecution under a 1986 federal law requiring 
stiff prison terms for dealing drugs near schoolyards, playgrounds and video 
arcades. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge W. Matthew Byrne Jr. said the judges had decided to jointly 
question the lawyers because nine currently pending cases in federal court here 
raise the same question. But Byrne said the judges would rule separately on 
whether each case should be dismissed on grounds of selective prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Congress passed the so-called "schoolyard law" as part of the Controlled 
Substances Act to combat drug sales within 1,000 feet of a schoolyard, or 100 
feet of a playground or video arcade. 
</P>
<P>
Local authorities have made virtually every arrest in these cases in Southern 
California. They then consulted the U.S. attorney's office to determine whether 
the defendant should be prosecuted in state or federal court. 
</P>
<P>
Where these cases are prosecuted is significant, because federal sentences are 
stiffer. For example, a defendant in state court could receive only a six-month 
sentence for an offense that would bring 20 years in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Byrne said the defense lawyers would have a tough task to prove selective 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
"We might be terribly concerned about how these cases were selected," he said, 
but "the only way you can prevail on this motion is to prove that the selection 
(of defendants) was made on the basis of race." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attorney's office set up a special program to prosecute schoolyard 
cases in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Mary Gibbons of North Hollywood told the judges that since 
then, 91 of the 92 people charged under the law in federal court here were 
either black or Latino. She said this showed that the U.S. attorney's office 
was intentionally targeting minorities for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
"They're only looking in South-Central Los Angeles and the Hispanic areas," 
Gibbons said. "They're just not looking in white areas for schoolyard cases. 
They're only looking in areas where they're going to find minorities." 
</P>
<P>
Such enforcement, she said, raises further questions about the tactics of the 
Los Angeles Police Department and the U.S. attorney's office.. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbons said the U.S. attorney's office has jurisdiction in seven Southern 
California counties, but the only cases it had filed under the schoolyard law 
were generated by police agencies in Los Angeles County -- primarily the Los 
Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven G. Madision replied that "race was not a factor" in 
the office's decisions on whom to prosecute. He said the decisions were based 
on criteria set out by former U.S. Atty. Robert C. Bonner Jr. -- primarily the 
quantity of drugs sold and whether the person had prior convictions. Persons 
who did not meet the criteria were referred to the district attorney's office 
for prosecution in state court. 
</P>
<P>
However, Madison said he did not know the answer to several questions posed by 
judges Byrne, Terry J. Hatter Jr. and Mariana R. Pfaelzer. They included how 
many of the cases involved children, how many of the arrests were made at 
night, how many of the arrests were made in public housing projects and the 
racial composition of persons whose cases were referred to state court. Federal 
Judge Richard A. Gadbois Jr. also participated in Monday's hearing, but did not 
question the attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
The judges indicated that they were wary of granting defense lawyers extensive 
discovery because of what they considered the wide-ranging nature of the 
requests. Judge Pfaelzer called their request for information on how officials 
in the LAPD made decisions about what areas to target "very-far reaching." 
</P>
<P>
However, the judges also indicated that they were puzzled that there were 
virtually no cases involving white defendants, as it is well-known that there 
is considerable drug-dealing in some white neighborhoods and in some schools 
with predominantly white student bodies. 
</P>
<P>
"Why are all these cases from minority areas?" Hatter asked Madison. 
</P>
<P>
"The police went where they thought the problems were the greatest," the 
prosecutor replied. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Hatter said he believed the LAPD could generate cases from white schools 
because "they have undercover agents" in those schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't the real problem (that) nothing was being presented to you (for 
prosecution) except minority cases?" Pfaelzer asked Madison. 
</P>
<P>
He responded that he didn't know, because "we don't keep records on race." 
</P>
<P>
For months, several federal judges have privately expressed dismay about some 
of the schoolyard cases filed in Los Angeles. The judges feel that some of 
these cases are more appropriate for state court because they are generated by 
local law enforcement and do not involve large-scale crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Byrne said he had handled one case where "a 20-year-old girl" was charged and 
convicted under the law after selling $25 worth of crack cocaine to an elderly 
LAPD informant while in her boyfriend's apartment in a housing project within 
1,000 feet of a schoolyard. 
</P>
<P>
The woman received a five-year sentence, a mandatory minimum under current 
federal law. Byrne questioned the wisdom of "the prosecutorial discretion" 
involved in filing the case in federal court rather than state court. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a separate question" from selective prosecution, Madison responded. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it is," Byrne said. "I hope someone is thinking about it because a 
substantial number of us are deeply concerned about those decisions."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-RTD WORKER CHARGED IN ILLEGAL COMPUTER 
USE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Rapid Transit District employee has been charged with using an RTD 
computer to help her run a video pirating operation, prosecutors said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Karen F. Fox, 40, a former RTD junior systems programmer, was charged last week 
with 18 counts of illegal computer access and use and four counts of videotape 
piracy. 
</P>
<P>
A co-defendant, Michael A. Pagan, also 40, was charged with two computer law 
violations. All the charges are misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation by the FBI, RTD police and a private agency hired by the 
Motion Picture Assn. of America found that Fox was allegedly making illegal 
copies in her Pasadena home of rented videotaped movies and selling them for 
$10 each. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn said Fox was using her computer at RTD 
headquarters to catalogue her extensive videotape library and keep track of 
orders for pirated tapes. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators raided Fox's home March 10 and seized 805 videotaped movies, 
along with seven VCRs, Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said Fox gave some of the copied material to Pagan, a former RTD systems 
programmer. 
</P>
<P>
Pagan and Fox, who was fired by the RTD last month, surrendered to RTD police 
on Friday and were released on $5,000 bail each. They are scheduled to be 
arraigned Dec. 13 in Municipal Court.

It's the kind of off-screen situation you might expect in Hollywood: 
</P>
<P>
A performer has the female lead in a television series although he is actually 
a male. And he virtually refuses to perform on camera or cooperate at publicity 
sessions unless his young mistress is sitting nearby. 
</P>
<P>
His agent even brought along the mistress to the Headliners Awards banquet 
staged over the weekend by the Los Angeles Press Club at the Biltmore Hotel. 
She sat at a separate table while the actor received an award. 
</P>
<P>
"He loses interest in things if he doesn't see her sitting there," explained 
one of the people in his entourage. 
</P>
<P>
The mistress goes by the flashy name of Falcon. 
</P>
<P>
The actor, we're sorry to say, boys and girls, is . . . Lassie. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Adams writes, "While I was moving at a snail's pace from Mandeville 
Canyon due to the slide on Pacific Coast Highway, I was following a Mercedes 
with a license plate that read: 
</P>
<P>
"'PCH CLSD."' 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, if you're a member of the These-Things-Happen-in-Threes cult, you 
no doubt took comfort from the fact that, following the landslide that shut 
down PCH and the shipwreck that closed Culver Boulevard, a small plane landed 
on the Golden State Freeway Sunday. 
</P>

Customers with coupons for one Long Beach car wash should read the small print, 
especially if the grime on their car could be carbon-dated.

<P>
Now that East Germany's leaders have stopped using the Berlin Wall as a 
restraining device, an Encino capitalist wants to buy it. But it may not be for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
"I phoned the embassy today (Monday) and they said they'd probably want to keep 
it," said Barry Stuppler, a rare coin dealer who has offered to give East 
Germany $50 million for the 28-mile-long concrete wall. 
</P>
<P>
"They pointed out that the Chinese have used their wall for a tourist 
attraction and said they (East Germany) might do the same." 
</P>
<P>
Stuppler's plan is to open a factory in East Germany that would break the wall 
into several million 3-inch pieces that would be sealed in plastic and sold -- 
accompanied by certificates of authenticity -- for up to $100 each. 
</P>
<P>
"We would hire East Berliners to produce them, and they would find out what 
entrepreneurship is all about," Stuppler said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the merchandising idea occurred to him after he saw TV pictures of 
joyful West Berliners chipping away at the wall with hammers after East Germany 
announced an end to travel restrictions for its citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Stuppler said that since making his offer, he has heard from several people who 
would like to invest in his scheme as well as people who have tried to interest 
him in others. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, "One had an idea for a scented ball for garbage 
disposals." 
</P>
<P>
The telephone system at Banning High in Wilmington is in danger of flunking 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Faculty members recently received this bulletin: 
</P>
<P>
"Due to the phone problems if you get any calls, remember to get the person's 
name and phone number right away before you get cut off!!!"

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ACCOMPLICE IN TODD BRIDGES CASE SENTENCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harvey Duckett, who pleaded no contest to charges that he helped actor Todd 
Bridges allegedly shoot a convicted drug dealer, was sentenced Monday to three 
years' probation by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges, 24, the former child star of the television sitcom "Diff'rent 
Strokes," was acquitted last Tuesday of attempted murder and attempted 
voluntary manslaughter charges. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a mistrial was declared on a lesser charge of assault with a 
deadly weapon after jurors deadlocked 8 to 4 in favor of acquittal on the 
count. Prosecutors plan to announce Nov. 21 whether they will retry Bridges on 
the assault count. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges was charged with shooting convicted Texas drug dealer Kenneth (Tex) 
Clay eight times last Feb. 2 inside a South-Central Los Angeles rock house. 
</P>
<P>
Clay testified that after an argument between himself and the actor, Bridges 
and Duckett kicked open the door of the house. Bridges then stood over him and 
repeatedly shot him with a handgun, Clay said. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges testified that he was so intoxicated with cocaine from a four-day drug 
binge that he does not remember shooting Clay.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PILOT CRASH-LANDS ON FREEWAY OVERPASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal investigators said Monday they will try to determine what caused an 
engine failure that forced the pilot of a small plane to make a crash landing 
Sunday on a freeway overpass in Sun Valley, injuring himself and a passenger 
when the aircraft clipped a light pole and grazed a car. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot and passenger were identified by Los Angeles police as Robert 
Gaugenmaier, 62, and his wife, Judith, 50, of Studio City. The single-engine 
Cessna 182 they were in crash-landed at 4 p.m. on the Sunland Boulevard 
overpass above the Golden State Freeway, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The Gaugenmaiers were both in stable condition Monday at Pacifica Hospital of 
the Valley. Nursing supervisor Judy Fischer said both suffered back injuries 
and cuts and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the plane was heading from Sedona, Ariz., to the Burbank 
airport but went down shortly after Robert Gaugenmaier reported to the tower 
that he thought he was having engine problems. 
</P>
<P>
The plane clipped a light pole before it crashed onto the roadway, grazing a 
1978 Cadillac Seville carrying a woman and her two children, who were not hurt, 
said Sgt. Phil Butler. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Wall of the National Transportation Safety Board said his office will 
handle the investigation.

BARGES PROVIDE CRUCIAL LIFELINE FOR CATALINA; 
</P>
<P>
SURVIVAL: ALL THE NECESSITIES FOR LIVING ON THE ISLAND MUST BE BROUGHT OVER 
FROM THE MAINLAND. IF THE WEATHER TURNS FOUL OR THE TIDES ARE BAD, AVALON 
RESIDENTS START TO WORRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's a thought that may not cross the mind of the average tourist to Santa 
Catalina Island this weekend, but almost everything he buys or eats was sent 
over from the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
And more than likely, that souvenir T-shirt or those fresh salad vegetables 
made the 22-mile crossing to the island by barge. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina's most vital links to the mainland are based at Berth 184 in Los 
Angeles Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Dubbed Islander and Islander II, the two 128-foot-long barges transport food, 
fuel, clothing, cars, construction materials and just about everything else it 
takes to live in Avalon or Two Harbors, the even more isolated community on the 
other side of the island. 
</P>
<P>
Their task is awesome: to supply the necessities of life to Catalina's more 
than 3,000 year-round residents and as many as 15,000 visitors a day during the 
peak summer tourist season. 
</P>
<P>
Making more than 200 round trips annually from their Wilmington berth to their 
island landing near Pebbly Beach Road, about a mile east of Avalon, the 
flat-bottomed barges are Catalina's umbilical tie to "overtown." 
</P>
<P>
The barges, pulled by tugboats across the channel, make round-trip crossings at 
least five times a week in summer and three times a week in winter, depending 
on the tides and the whims of the weather, said Jim Radcliffe, vice president 
of Catalina Freight Lines. 
</P>
<P>
"The barge is definitely the one and only major necessity on the island," Sally 
Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband own a wholesale food supply company, as well as Fred and 
Sally's, one of Avalon's two supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina's remoteness is one of its greatest attractions, but it also means 
that residents and merchants must rely heavily on sea transport, particularly 
for items like fresh fruit, vegetables and other perishables. Mail and some 
small packages are delivered by air. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the Santa Catalina Island Co. announced a sweeping, 15-year 
development plan that will overhaul much of Avalon. The plan includes the 
construction of new hotels, a new fire station and, eventually, a new City Hall 
and civic complex. Once development begins, the barges' importance to the 
island's existence will increase because builders will rely on them to 
transport needed materials. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the challenges of building over here is our geographic isolation and 
the need to plan out exactly how the construction process is going to work, 
because it's totally different from the mainland," said Ron Doutt, vice 
president of the Santa Catalina Island Co. "You can figure anything built on 
Catalina is going to cost at least 50% more (than on the mainland)." 
</P>
<P>
The logistics include coordinating the arrival of the right kinds of 
construction workers with the right goods, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you forget an order of 4-by-4s or you forget some bolt, you can't go down 
and just pick up what you've forgotten," Doutt said. "You've got to wait for 
the next barge and hope that is a priority item and will get on." 
</P>
<P>
Whether a last-minute order makes it onto the barge depends on the item -- food 
and fuel take priority -- its size and whether the barge is full, said Leo 
Hernandez, who manages freight company operations in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
The barge is a "roll-on, roll-off" operation, meaning that already loaded truck 
trailers are driven over a ramp directly onto the barge, where the trailers are 
disconnected from the truck and parked for the cross-channel ride to Avalon. 
There, the trailers are either unloaded at the company's warehouse or 
reconnected to a truck and hauled to their island destination. 
</P>
<P>
"In those trailers, we put all of the island's building products, all of the 
food services, all of the clothing -- everything," said Ed Fine, manager of 
barge operations at Avalon. "Everything that it takes for a community to live." 
</P>
<P>
The barge also carries nearly 3 million gallons of fuel a year, including 
diesel fuel to operate Southern California Edison Co.'s power plant on the 
island, Radcliffe said. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina Freight Lines, which employs about 18 people in Avalon and Wilmington 
during the peak summer season, has operated the barges since 1958, Radcliffe 
said. Before that, the Santa Catalina Island Co. transported goods by steamer.

POSTSCRIPT: SNYDER OUT OF CITY HALL BUT NOT ADVOCACY BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He was once a "barefoot barrio kid from East Los Angeles," but Arthur K. Snyder 
wound up serving 18 years on the Los Angeles City Council. He can still look 
out over his old Eastside district from his 37th-floor law offices in 
downtown's Wells Fargo Center. 
</P>
<P>
A burly redhead of German-Irish descent, Snyder, 56, defied all the odds and 
drove his opponents to distraction after a 1972 court decision forced a change 
in his district's boundaries, handing him a district that was 60% Latino. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, he objected vigorously -- not because he didn't like Latinos, he 
said, but because political opponents were trying to win in court what they 
couldn't win at the ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
"The city approached it as if they would elect a Hispanic," he said. "What a 
phony baloney thing they did." 
</P>
<P>
Even his opponents concede that he paid scrupulous attention to his 
constituents' needs. He spoke Spanish at public gatherings and kept winning 
reelection -- even as his district became more Latino. 
</P>
<P>
"It gave me a real challenge," he said. "Nobody was interested in doing what 
was needed on the Eastside." 
</P>
<P>
Controversy was never far removed, despite his political success. He had a 
series of accidents in city-owned cars and once was tried -- and acquitted -- 
on drunk driving charges. 
</P>
<P>
He was removed as chairman of the council's powerful Planning Committee in 1979 
after colleagues complained that he was using the position to solicit campaign 
contributions. Similar charges led to his ouster from the South Coast Regional 
Coastal Commission in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, his second wife, Michele Noval, charged in divorce proceedings the 
same year that he battered her and abused their then 5-year-old daughter. 
Neither allegation led to criminal charges, and Snyder was given visitation 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
Time spent with his child since the divorce has enabled him to "appreciate what 
a father and daughter relationship should be," he said in a recent interview. 
"Right now, I would say, is the happiest time of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Through all Snyder's personal and political controversy, his constituency 
remained loyal. 
</P>
<P>
"The ones who laughed and cried with me were the people in my district," he 
said. "They were the ones who knew I cared. It didn't matter what the press 
said." 
</P>
<P>
Citing concern for his current wife's health, Snyder resigned from the council 
in 1985. Richard Alatorre succeeded him, becoming the council's first Latino 
member in more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Capitalizing on valuable connections built during 30 years in local politics, 
Snyder has moved smoothly into a new legal career, practicing what he prefers 
to call "advocacy." The former councilman's contacts have made him one of the 
most sought after lobbyists in the city, although, he said, "I don't consider 
myself as a lobbyist. I represent my clients as an attorney." 
</P>
<P>
He said he might "fold up" his firm when he turns 65, and only "maintain a 
small practice that keeps me close to my friends. I don't know that I could 
ever completely retire." 
</P>
<P>
He has learned to take a "longer view" that keeps him from getting as excited 
with "momentary matters," he said. But that view "doesn't keep me from being a 
very strong advocate for my clients." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to lose." JOHN H. LEE

IRISH ACTIVIST GRANTED RELEASE ON $25,000 BAIL; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: SIOBHAN O'HANLON ALLEGEDLY CONCEALED AN EXPLOSIVES CONVICTION ON 
IMMIGRATION FORMS. U.S. MAGISTRATE SAYS SHE ISN'T LIKELY TO FLEE. 
</P>

<P>
A federal magistrate set bail at $25,000 Monday for an Irish activist charged 
with lying to U.S. immigration officials about a 1985 conviction in Northern 
Ireland on charges of possessing explosives. 
</P>
<P>
In setting bail for Siobhan O'Hanlon, U.S. Magistrate Charles F. Eick said the 
Irish national, arrested by FBI agents Thursday in Whittier, has enough ties in 
Los Angeles County to prevent her from fleeing the country before her trial. 
</P>
<P>
She is charged with failing to disclose the explosives conviction on 
immigration forms she filled out in New York City last month. 
</P>
<P>
Eick said the nature of the charges "militates heavily against detaining the 
defendant." He also postponed until Thursday a hearing on whether O'Hanlon's 
trial will be moved to New York. 
</P>
<P>
The magistrate said much of his decision to grant bail was based on commitments 
from members of the local Irish-American community to offer their homes as 
collateral for the bond. At least 10 couples have offered their homes, said 
immigration attorney Peter Schey. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agents arrested O'Hanlon as she arrived at the Sprinkler Fitters' Union 
headquarters for a speech to members of the Irish Northern Aid Committee. 
</P>
<P>
O'Hanlon spent two years in prison in Northern Ireland after her 1985 
conviction on the explosives charges. 
</P>
<P>
O'Hanlon came to this country last month to speak before the Irish American 
Unity Conference, a coalition of groups seeking an end to the fighting between 
the British government and Irish activists in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
"She came to address the conference and then she traveled around the country," 
said Imelda Hughes, a member of the Irish Northern Aid Committee and one of the 
homeowners who offered to put up her house to meet the bond payment. "I know 
her off and on, but I'm not about to put up my house for anyone who would skip 
town." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes said O'Hanlon's arrest has galvanized -- and angered -- many in the 
local Irish-American community. 
</P>
<P>
"It totally incensed Irish-Americans," she said. "People born in Belfast know 
they get no justice, but people born here thought they did. (The arrest) came 
as a big shock to them." 
</P>
<P>
O'Hanlon has spoken in several cities since addressing the Irish American Unity 
Conference, including San Diego and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
O'Hanlon is a volunteer at the Belfast headquarters of Sinn Fein, the political 
wing of the Irish Republican Army.

Beefed-up security and more police officers may be responsible for the 
relatively tame crowd at Sunday's Chargers-Raiders National Football League 
game at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 59,100 fans who attended Sunday night's game, only five people were 
jailed on drunk and disorderly charges, said Lt. Bill Hoover of the San Diego 
Police Department. Officers also issued 44 citations for other infractions, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another 18 people were ejected from the game, 16 were taken to a detoxification 
center and 17 were questioned by police, Hoover said. 
</P>
<P>
Willie O'Ree, director of Strategic Security, the private firm hired by the 
Chargers to handle security for Charger home games, said: "It went a lot 
smoother than expected. We were afraid fights would break out after the Raiders 
took the lead, but then the Chargers took the lead, and everything mellowed 
out." 
</P>
<P>
O'Ree said he had about 100 security officers working the game. He said a crew 
of 50 is normal for a Chargers game. 
</P>
<P>
When the Chargers played the Philadelphia Eagles Nov. 5 at the stadium, police 
and stadium security broke up more than 50 fights, made nine arrests and 
ejected 15 disorderly fans from the game.

A longtime copy editor for the San Diego Tribune was reported missing by 
concerned co-workers after many attempts in San Diego and Tijuana failed to 
locate him, police said. 
</P>

Abe Rillos Gutierrez, 53, who has worked for the Tribune since 1971 and told 
his employers in July that he was living in Tijuana hotels, has not been seen 
at the newspaper since Nov. 3, when he worked his normal shift, said police 
spokesman Bill Robinson. Gutierrez called in sick the evening before the next 
day's shift, as well as Nov. 5, the day before he was scheduled to work again, 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Tribune reporters unsuccessfully checked with hotels, hospitals, jails, morgues 
and police in Tijuana and San Diego before reporting Gutierrez missing Friday, 
Robinson said. His son and daughter in Phoenix also have been unable to locate 
him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time Gutierrez has been missing, Robinson said. The copy 
editor disappeared for one day last July, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez is about 6 feet tall, weighs 190 pounds, and has curly, dark brown 
hair, Robinson said. He drives a tan, two-door car with California license 
plates. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information regarding his whereabouts is asked to call the San 
Diego Police Department's missing persons office at 531-2277, or at 531-2000 in 
the evenings.

PARENTS WANT MORE BILINGUAL HELP AT SCHOOL; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: ONE-FOURTH OF THE STUDENTS AT A TARZANA SCHOOL SPEAK LITTLE OR NO 
ENGLISH. PARENTS SAY THE RESULTING CHAOS RUINS THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Parents of children attending a Tarzana elementary school complained to the Los 
Angeles school board Tuesday that a shortage of Spanish-speaking teachers and 
aides is creating a climate of chaos, saying Spanish-speaking children disrupt 
classrooms because they cannot understand the teachers. 
</P>
<P>
About a quarter of the 760 students attending Wilbur Avenue Elementary School 
are bused from crowded inner-city schools and speak little or no English, 
parent Malka Tasoff said. The school has 14 bilingual classes but employs only 
two bilingual teachers and four bilingual aides, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want more bilingual teachers and more bilingual aides," Tasoff said. 
</P>
<P>
Without a bilingual teaching staff, English-speaking children spend most of 
their time helping others learn English, the parents told the board. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter first tries to explain, then to demonstrate and finally to teach 
the other children herself," said Garrie Katznelson. "As a result, her test 
scores are going down. This is not right, and this is not fair for any of the 
children at that school." 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Steve, said that children from the predominantly white, 
middle-class neighborhood surrounding Wilbur have suffered headaches, stomach 
aches, bouts of asthma and sleeplessness since the beginning of the school year 
because of language problems in many classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
School board President Jackie Goldberg said the district "is recruiting 
heavily" and offered a $5,000 bonus this year to attract bilingual teachers but 
still lacks two-thirds of the teachers needed to handle growing numbers of 
Spanish-speaking students. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg told the parents that neighborhood schools in less crowded areas of 
the district, such as the West San Fernando Valley, must accommodate students 
from more crowded areas where classroom seats are unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a situation of choices until we build more schools," Goldberg 
said. "We are out of space, pure and simple." 
</P>
<P>
Board member Julie Korenstein, who represents the area, told parents that the 
district would investigate whether the school can hire more bilingual aides to 
assist classroom teachers.

<TEXT>
<P>
Kudos to those who went to court to seek restraining orders against Los Angeles 
County authorities who extort contributions to the United Way and other 
charities from their employees (Metro, Nov. 3). 
</P>
<P>
My charities are my business. Every year, I and millions of other employees are 
badgered, harassed, coerced and strong-armed to contribute time and money to 
our employers' pet charities. 
</P>
<P>
Irrespective of any verbal or written reassurance, the employees contribute 
mostly out of fear. We feel that our failure to contribute will jeopardize our 
chances for advancement or will aggravate a pre-existing or future disciplinary 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
It is time to ban all solicitations for donations from the workplace and to ban 
any kind of payroll deductions for any charities.

KRAUTHAMMER ON ISRAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Krauthammer's column ("Shamir Is Guarding Israel, Not Quibbling," Op-Ed 
Page, Nov. 5) defending Shamir's refusal to negotiate with Palestinians outside 
the occupied territories betrays a thinly veiled pro-annexation bias. 
</P>
<P>
If either Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir or Krauthammer were seriously 
interested in establishing a lasting territorial compromise between Israel and 
the Palestinian people, locking the 3.5 million Palestinians living outside the 
West Bank and Gaza out of the peace process would be the worst way to achieve 
it. For without the political and economic support and continued loyalty of 
these external Palestinians, a weak Palestinian mini-state in the West Bank and 
Gaza could readily be undermined by "Palestinian outsiders" claiming no 
allegiance to its borders, leaders or political institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Israel's own long-term security, thus, depends on obtaining the binding 
commitment of the Palestinian diaspora and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization, in addition to the territories existing residents, to any 
negotiated peace. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the majority of Palestinians nor Jews may be able to live in the 
resulting Palestine or Israel. But the majority of both must have "their 
homeland" to support. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's and Krauthammer's objection to talking to external Palestinians about 
this path to peace, indeed, is not a "quibble." It is a calculated political 
monkey wrench thrown into the peace mechanism itself.

KRAUTHAMMER ON ISRAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Krauthammer joins such notable syndicated columnists as William F. Buckley, 
George Will, Patrick Buchanan and others in taking his opportunity to stroke 
Israel. He devotes his entire column to pointing out that Israel should only 
negotiate with Palestinian "insiders" and not those Palestinians outside of the 
occupied territories. This despite the fact that Palestinians, wherever found, 
are almost 100% in favor of the PLO representing their interests. 
</P>
<P>
Krauthammer could well have pointed out that Israel has consistently violated 
the human rights of the Palestinians in the occupied territories. He could have 
written of deportations, confiscation of property, demolition of homes of those 
suspected of throwing stones, appropriation of land, midnight visits by Israeli 
troops battering down doors, concentration in camps of thousands without charge 
or trial, beatings of prisoners by soldiers and shooting indiscriminately into 
crowds when confronted by stone throwers. 
</P>
<P>
But our columnists know which side butters their syndications. 
</P>
<P>
These "honorable" writers are able to discern human rights violations in the 
Soviet Union, Cuba, Panama, China and any number of other countries. However, 
their pens dry up and their word processor screens are blank when they have an 
opportunity to bring, via their columns, some slight indictment of Israel for 
the violations visited on Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
It is truly unthinkable that many of our most noted figures of the media, 
together with our Administration and Congress, have become toadies to Israel 
and are unable to bring themselves to write the truth as Americans know it.

KRAUTHAMMER ON ISRAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Intifada's 'Shock Troops' Masked," the well-written and informative article by 
Daniel Williams (Part A, Oct. 29), again points out the lamentable condition to 
which present Israeli leadership has sunk. Their new policy of opening fire on 
anyone in the West Bank and Gaza Strip wearing a scarf or hood is simply a 
continuation of the inhuman brutality which they have so long inflicted on 
their Palestinian charges. 
</P>
<P>
I visited the Israeli-occupied areas in August and was appalled at what I found 
there. Israeli officials regularly appropriate private land without cause. The 
Palestinian population is subjected to collective punishment for the suspected 
misdeeds of a few. Homes of those believed to have connections with dissidents 
are summarily demolished. Individuals may be held in detention for up to a year 
without trial. Schools and vocational training centers are shut down with even 
the dissemination of homework assignments forbidden. Now, as hapless 
Palestinians try to insulate themselves from the damp winds of winter, they 
face sudden death at the hands of Israeli soldiers. Could any situation be more 
tragic or more pathetic? 
</P>
<P>
The barbarous tactics employed by Israel's far-right leaders will ultimately 
prove ruinous for that nation. Such cruel policies provide no real opportunity 
for meaningful dialogue, no chance for a lessening of tensions, no opening for 
peace. Sadistic repression always breeds violent rebellion in a never-ending 
vicious circle. Only when Israel's decision-makers see the human faces of those 
in the occupied lands can there be hope of reconciliation and an end to the 
awful carnage.

IT'S TIME TO TRY AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Battered but resilient, the Democratic and Republican leaders of the House are 
preparing to call for another vote to approve pay raises for members of 
Congress and certain other federal officials. This takes no small political 
courage, given the working over Congress suffered earlier this year at the 
hands of an organized anti-pay- raise lobby. But the House leadership is 
displaying more than bravery as it prepares to face renewed wrath. It is also 
acting realistically and responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
For when all the shouting is over, this fact remains: In a competitive 
marketplace, federal judges and other high-level officials are underpaid. The 
overdue effort to raise federal pay deserves not demagogic condemnation but 
public support. 
</P>
<P>
No one argues that public service need be as remunerative as the private 
sector, but at the same time it's absurd to ask those who go into public 
service to accept severe economic penalties. Current top pay for Congress and 
federal officials and judges is $89,500. Measured against average family 
income, measured, indeed, against the realistic aspirations of most wage 
earners, that's a lot of money. It is not a lot, however, given what talented 
people in federal service could earn in the private sector. There are probably 
very few federal judges, assistant secretaries or senior civil servants who 
couldn't expect to double or even triple their pay by opting out of public 
life. 
</P>
<P>
And Congress? The argument for raising congressional pay is not so much a 
matter of equity as of ethical practicality. To augment their salaries members 
of Congress have for years left themselves free to solicit and accept outside 
income, $26,850 annually in the case of representatives, $35,000 for senators. 
Where does this money come from? In almost every case, it comes from people or 
organizations that are eager to curry favor or buy influence. This is 
demeaning, corrupting and scandalous, a taxpayer-robbing abuse of public trust 
that has long cried out for elimination. 
</P>
<P>
The measure being prepared for a House vote would junk so-called honorariums -- 
never was a word so misapplied -- as well as sharply restrict outside income 
and fees for professional services. In exchange, top federal officials would 
get a two-tier pay raise to about $120,500 in 1991. The exact scope of the 
proposed ban isn't yet clear. It may be that a toughening beyond what is 
contemplated will be required. What is known is that a pay increase for senior 
federal officials is overdue, and so is a far stricter ethical system governing 
outside congressional income. The chance to deal responsibly with both these 
questions is again at hand.

HEALTH CLINICS AT HIGH SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Health clinics are now operating at three Los Angeles high school campuses, and 
evidence is accumulating that their supporters were right and the worst fears 
of their critics were unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
All three provide general health care and offer birth-control information on 
request. With the necessary permission of their parents, thousands of students 
have made use of the health centers at Jordan High School in Watts, Los Angeles 
High School in the Mid-Wilshire District and San Fernando High School in the 
Valley. Hundreds of students use the privately funded clinics, which have been 
in operation for two years, but few seek contraceptives. 
</P>
<P>
One statistic that should put the fears of critics to rest is that only 15% 
seek birth-control pills or condoms, according to a report provided recently to 
school board members. Another statistic to cheer those who support the clinics 
is that an impressive 95.5% of those students who do request birth-control 
information do not get pregnant. That pregnancy rate cannot be compared with 
the general school population because overall statistics are not yet available. 
</P>
<P>
That is encouraging because nearly 1 million teen-agers get pregnant every year 
and teen pregnancy is the leading cause of the failure of young women to finish 
high school. That, in turn, means wretched futures not only for young parents 
but often for their children. There is no simple solution, but certainly 
greater access to birth-control information and contraceptives is an important 
element. 
</P>
<P>
Most teen-agers use the student clinics for routine medical attention such as 
immunizations, sore throats and earaches. More serious problems are referred to 
county health centers. A significant percentage also seek counseling for 
typical teen-age difficulties with parents and weight, or more serious concerns 
involving gangs, drugs, alcohol -- even suicide attempts. 
</P>
<P>
One depressing statistic is that nearly 70% of the students come from families 
with no health insurance. They have few options for routine medical care or 
birth-control information. But at least on three campuses, help is now at hand.

A COSTLY HOUR WITH SWEENEY TODD, DDS; 
</P>
<P>
LIVING: WHEN YOUR DENTIST SAYS 'OPEN WIDE,' HE MEANS YOUR WALLET, NOT YOUR 
MOUTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CALVIN TRILLIN, Calvin Trillin writes a column in New York.

<TEXT>
<P>
My dentist -- Sweeney Todd, DDS -- had his receptionist phone me to say that I 
should come in for an appointment. I figured Sweeney was having cash-flow 
problems again. 
</P>
<P>
"What is it this time?" I asked the receptionist. 
</P>
<P>
"He says that he was looking at your X-rays, and you need a crown in the lower 
left something or other," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mean what is it with me," I said. "What is it with him? Did the kid's 
college tuition bill just come in? Would you mind just shouting back there and 
asking him how much he owes for what? I'd like to get myself prepared." 
</P>
<P>
"I can't," the receptionist said. "He's in the Caribbean until next Tuesday. 
Before he left, he gave me a list of patients to call. He told me that he'll 
need you for an hour on the first appointment." 
</P>
<P>
"An hour on the first appointment?" I said. "Sounds like Jamaica. Or maybe 
Antigua. This is definitely no cheapie to the Bahamas. That time he went to the 
Bahamas he only needed me for a half-hour session with the dental hygienist. 
May I ask if he took the wife and kids?" 
</P>
<P>
"And his in-laws," the receptionist said. 
</P>
<P>
"Erghh," I said, with some feeling. "I think we're talking gold crown here. 
Maybe even root canal." 
</P>
<P>
I showed up for the hour appointment anyway. What's the alternative? I don't 
think I'm up to auto-dentistry. 
</P>
<P>
I could switch dentists, of course, but I've become sort of used to old 
Sweeney. I'd feel something was missing if a dentist didn't accompany his 
drilling with a lot of talk about how much electricians charge for a simple 
rewiring job these days. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, I don't know any other dentists. I don't admit that to Sweeney Todd, 
DDS, of course. In fact, I've been telling him for years that some friends of 
mine are always singing the praises of the dentist they all go to, a relatively 
recent arrival from Kyoto known to his grateful patients as Magic Fingers 
Yamamoto. 
</P>
<P>
"They say he's got the touch of an angel," I said of Yamamoto, as I settled 
into the chair and prepared for the assaults of a deeply tanned Sweeney Todd, 
DDS. 
</P>
<P>
"Open wide, please," Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, Yamamoto belongs to some sect that believes the exchange of large sums 
of money corrupts the soul," I continued. "For crowns and bridges, he does 
wonders with the same material used for the common paper clip. His fees, of 
course, are nominal. Basically, he seeks his rewards in inner fulfillment. He 
spits on money -- or he would if he weren't so polite." 
</P>
<P>
"Spit, please," Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney had stopped his banging around and was standing next to his instrument 
cabinet peering at some X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you see there, Sweeney?" I asked. "A new transmission for your BMW? A 
long weekend with the missus in the Adirondacks?" 
</P>
<P>
Sweeney held the X-rays up to the window to get a better look. "Won't be able 
to get away for the next few weekends," Sweeney said. "We're doing an addition 
to the kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
"You never cease to amaze me, Sweeney," I said. "I've seen those television 
commercials that show doctors seeing all sorts of little bitty doodads through 
the miracle of CAT scans -- or not seeing them, really, because all of the 
patients in those commercials turn out to be OK -- but you've got to be the 
only medical man who can look at an X-ray with the naked eye and see an 
addition to your kitchen. What's your secret?" 
</P>
<P>
"I have a better X-ray machine," Sweeney said, knocking over the water glass as 
he turned toward me, "but it's expensive. Very expensive. Open wide, please."

PROP. 103: ILLUSION SEEKING REALITY; 
</P>
<P>
INSURANCE: FAIRNESS IS A TWO-WAY STREET. THE INDUSTRY CAN'T KEEP CARRYING 
UNINSURED AND RISKY DRIVERS AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN R. WOLEN, Alan R. Wolen is an attorney with a Los Angeles firm that 
represents a number of insurers in the current rate hearings. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ceaseless attacks against the insurance industry are attributing the lack of 
rate rollbacks and refunds under Proposition 103 to insurance companies' 
"greed." 
</P>
<P>
Let's take time out to recognize a few realities. The first is that insurance 
companies do indeed try to make profits. It is called capitalism, the American 
way of life, a way that has survived and outperformed other economic systems, 
notably the regulated and bureaucratic structures now crumbling in Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The second reality is that the operative provisions of Proposition 103 were 
modified dramatically by the California Supreme Court to make them lawful. As 
Proposition 103 was originally written, rate rollbacks were required of all 
casualty insurers. As modified by the Supreme Court in a decision effective 
only four months ago, insurers could obtain relief from the refunds and rate 
rollbacks to the extent necessary to earn "a reasonable rate of return." 
</P>
<P>
Hearings are now being conducted to establish standards and components of a 
reasonable rate of return. Consumer groups and insurers are both represented at 
these hearings, accompanied by attorneys. Some seem to think that there is 
something wrong with allowing the insurers to be part of these hearings. But 
the fundamental fairness of our system requires that those whose interests are 
affected have an opportunity to be heard. 
</P>
<P>
To a very large extent, the rollbacks and refunds promised to the public in 
seeking votes for Proposition 103 are illusory. The rates charged by some 
insurers are insufficient for profitable operations, and those charged by 
others are lower than necessary or merely adequate to generate a reasonable 
rate of return. And persons insured with these companies should not expect 
refunds or rollbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, some insurers are highly profitable and may be subject to rollbacks 
and related refunds to the extent that "reasonable rates of return" are 
exceeded. The complexities involved in determining reasonable rates of return 
are substantial. Only four months have elapsed since the Supreme Court's 
decision became effective, and hearings on the manner and procedures for 
determination have already commenced. Thus, the hysteria about nothing having 
been done about rates for a year is inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
What Proposition 103's supporters did not tell us is that reform is needed in 
the tort system for insurance costs to be lowered. Some insist that insurers 
reduce expenses by going after "fraud," but this brings us to two other 
seldom-mentioned realities: Fraud is very difficult to prove, and nonpayment of 
claims based on unestablished fraud may give rise to charges of "bad faith." 
Bad faith claims create even greater exposure to the insurer than the 
fraudulent claim, which, unhappily, is often paid because fraud cannot be 
proven. 
</P>
<P>
The simple truth is that the current tort system encourages fraud; it also 
encourages costly and lengthy litigation over who is at "fault," and if both 
parties are, which one bears the larger share of blame. This system returns 
much more to doctors and lawyers than it does to insured people, and clogs up 
our courts so that cases often have to wait years for trial. 
</P>
<P>
The solution is not to terminate private enterprise in the insurance business 
and set up a state monopoly or is it to create another layer of costs 
associated with rate justifications and hearings. Things can be done to reduce 
auto repair costs and fraud; however, legislation will be required. 
</P>
<P>
Some people point to the state-run system in British Columbia as a model for 
California. Essentially, that is a system in which claimants deal with their 
own insurer (the state) regardless of who is at fault. California voters and 
the Legislature have defeated "no-fault" measures that would eliminate much of 
the doctors' bills and lawyers costs from claims. Such systems have resulted in 
lower rates in New York and Florida and have been supported by many in the 
insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
However, merely by enforcement of two existing laws, those of us who are 
insured can stop paying for most of the bad drivers across the board. Because 
of political considerations, there is little effective enforcement of the 
mandatory insurance law, so many uninsured drivers remain among us. Those 
drivers provide no reimbursement of costs paid by your company when they cause 
collisions and injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Those who are insured under "assigned risk" policies, forced by the state on 
all auto insurers, pay premiums equal to about half of what your company pays 
out for claims and administrative expenses attributable to those policies. 
Again for political reasons, increases in assigned-risk premiums have been 
consistently denied, even though the law requires that rates keep pace with 
costs. Again, insured drivers subsidize the gap. 
</P>
<P>
Regulation of rates does not mean lower rates; it means that rates are set to 
permit a reasonable rate of return. Those rates may be lower or higher. If the 
volume of claims and the costs of doing business continue upward, rates will 
follow. Costs are increasing due to the rate-making process alone. 
</P>
<P>
We need to take meaningful action to reduce fraudulent claims, require 
insurance for all drivers, have assigned-risk policyholders pay their fair 
share, permit negotiated arrangements between insurers and auto-body repair 
facilities, and even reconsider adoption of a "no-fault" or modified negligence 
recovery system. These will reduce costs arising from claims, and that will 
result in lower rates. 
</P>
<P>
There is no free ride -- refund and rollback entitlement cannot happen unless 
rates exceed what is necessary to make a reasonable rate of return. Any other 
result would be confiscatory. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, we are left with the options of continuing to bash insurers for not 
rolling back rates because they face increasing claims and costs, or really 
doing something legislatively about reducing these claims and costs, thereby 
permitting lower rates.

SOMETIMES, HE'S TERROR OF TORONTO; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: EVEN TO HIS OWN TEAM, MAPLE LEAF OWNER HAROLD BALLARD IS A MASTER 
MANIPULATOR. 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To fully understand what people think about Harold Ballard, owner of the 
Toronto Maple Leafs, look no further than the team's media guide. 
</P>
<P>
Last season it introduced Ballard as "one of the most loved and most hated 
people in Canada." This season, the guide calls Ballard a "master promoter and 
manipulator of the media." 
</P>
<P>
And that is from his own team. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has its George Steinbrenner, the controversial owner of the 
New York Yankees. Canada, for better or worse, has Harold Ballard. 
</P>
<P>
Once, Ballard was one of the so-called Silver Seven, the directors who managed 
Maple Leaf Gardens and the wildly successful Maple Leaf hockey team. Now it's 
only Ballard, alone and very much in charge. He has delighted in fighting with 
the newspapers, the business Establishment, even the government. And he has 
loved nothing more than defying the edicts of the National Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
He has been caustically and publicly critical of his players and coaches. He 
once threatened to trade his entire team, said a player's poor play was because 
the player was a born-again Christian, and called Czech players who defected 
traitors. He has defied league orders and refused to allow Soviets to play in 
his building. 
</P>
<P>
A lifetime of acrimony may have caught up with Ballard, who is 86 and in poor 
health. He is convinced that his three children are waiting for him to die so 
they can share his vast wealth. His oldest son was recently convicted of 
assaulting Ballard's girlfriend. His youngest son is out on bail after having 
been arrested for breaking into the Ballard family home. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of the year, Ballard bought out two of his children, who had 
shares in the team and Maple Leaf Gardens, lest they carry through on a plan to 
mount a hostile takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the Maple Leafs continue to play the mediocre hockey that has 
characterized the team since Ballard took control 18 years ago. Today they are 
9-10 and in fourth place in the Norris Division, which is not bad, really, 
considering the nonsense the team has endured since before the start of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
In the space of a week in August: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The general manager resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two potential replacements rejected the job. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The coach, about to be fired, quit. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The chief scout offered to become general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The new coach agreed to terms while still under contract to another team. 
</P>
<P>
The Maple Leafs once represented all that was successful and prosperous about a 
hockey club. The team has won 11 Stanley Cups. It is situated in a city that 
many consider North America's hockey mecca. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, under Ballard's leadership, the team's record has been better than .500 
only five times. He has hired and fired 11 coaches in his 18 years. It has 
appeared to some that Ballard has viewed the team more as a tool to gain 
publicity for himself than to regain a Stanley Cup for his team. 
</P>
<P>
Wrote Scott Morrison, a sportswriter for the Toronto Sun, "Other teams have 
struggled, of course, but there remains no apparent hope for a turnaround with 
the Leafs, whose constants the past two decades have been losing, turmoil, and 
Ballard, all of which might actually be redundant." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PAL HAL AND THE FAMILY 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Bill Ballard, Harold's oldest child, was convicted of assaulting 
his father's female companion. Bill, 42, who is a partner in Concert 
Productions International, was found to have punched Yolanda Ballard in the 
face and kicked her in the stomach last year as she was escorting him out of 
Ballard's apartment at Maple Leaf Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Yolanda Ballard is not a relative but has been Ballard's companion since 1983 
and has legally changed her surname from MacMillan. 
</P>
<P>
The trial featured hilarious court antics, including Yolanda's dentures nearly 
falling out, crying and histrionics, and almost palpable acrimony from all 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the principals made faces during the testimony of others. 
</P>
<P>
Yolanda Ballard, a former telephone operator, in her testimony decribed 
Ballard's three children as "maggots and vultures who cannot wait for this man 
to die." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Bill Ballard characterized his father's girlfriend to the 
arresting officer as "human garbage." 
</P>
<P>
Yolanda Ballard has filed a $1-million civil lawsuit against Bill Ballard, 
claiming serious physical damage from the incident. 
</P>
<P>
The former Yolanda MacMillan, a blonde, 50ish divorcee, came into Ballard's 
life in 1982. MacMillan, like Ballard, spent time in prison on a fraud 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, she pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit fraud and 
perjury. MacMillan was alleged to have conspired with an attorney to alter the 
will of a wealthy and aging man. The forged will was valued at $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
She served four months of a three-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard, who has not given a one-on-one interview in three years, declined to 
be interviewed for this story. No members of his family could be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
At one time, Ballard clearly wanted his children to share in his estate. In 
1966, he established H.E Ballard Ltd., a private holding company, and 
designated each of his children to have a third of the shares of the company's 
stock. H.E. Ballard Ltd. controls 70.8% of the Maple Leaf Gardens' common 
stock, but Ballard himself holds 9.5% of the common stock and 308,029 shares of 
preferred stock. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Ballard is fighting to regain control of that Ballard Ltd. stock. 
</P>
<P>
Last June he averted a hostile takeover of the team and building by his son, 
Bill. To do that, Ballard bought 24% of son Harold Jr.'s shares for $25 
million. He had already consolidated his position by buying out his daughter, 
Mary-Elizabeth, for $15.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Bill is taking legal action against the sale of Harold Jr.'s stock, saying 
there existed a contract that gave Bill first option on sales of such stock. 
</P>
<P>
The rise and fall of Maple Leaf stock may be reasonably charted by following 
Harold Ballard's health. When Ballard suffered a heart attack in 1988, shares 
in Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd., the company that owns the hockey team and the 
arena, jumped $3.50 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Six months later, when 
Ballard entered the hospital for a quintuple heart-bypass operation, the stock 
rose again, by $2.75 a share. 
</P>
<P>
In ghoulish response to Ballard's returns to good health, the stock falls. 
</P>
<P>
Morton Schulman, a Toronto physician and heavy investor in the stock, said it 
plainly a few years ago: "We know he has diabetes. We know he doesn't follow 
his diet. We know he's 83. That's why I started buying stock." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AS THE LEAFS TURN 
</P>
<P>
Ballard was 68 when he became president of Maple Leaf Gardens, and not much of 
a hockey man. Wrote biographer William Houston of Ballard's management prowess: 
</P>
<P>
"Ballard, by taking over the running of the hockey team, had thrust himself 
into the contemporary world of professional hockey and was in over his head. It 
was a time when the Leafs needed shrewd and cunning management, but they didn't 
get it from Ballard." 
</P>
<P>
Ballard never adjusted well to criticism about his team in the Toronto papers. 
In the mid-70s, he banned a Globe and Mail reporter from team flights and the 
dressing room. Five more Globe reporters were restricted in their access at the 
Gardens, until, finally, Ballard barred the entire Globe and Mail staff from 
the press box. 
</P>
<P>
In the early '80s, the Globe was not given even the most basic information 
regarding the team, no media guides or even notification of press conferences. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Orr, a reporter with the Toronto Star for 26 years, has seen both a kind 
side to Ballard and a vicious one. Orr, who like Ballard rises early, used to 
go on long walks with Ballard when the team was on the road. One day Orr wrote 
a column that was mildly critical of Ballard. Orr got the silent treatment from 
then on. 
</P>
<P>
More than that, Orr said, Ballard spread the rumor that Orr, who is married, 
was gay. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard for years ignored an NHL rule regarding equal access and barred female 
sportswriters from the Leafs' locker room. 
</P>
<P>
"Women will be allowed to go in the locker room if they undress first," Ballard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
No one has been spared Ballard's opinions. He regularly refers to minorities in 
derogatory terms and seems to enjoy his outrageous comments. 
</P>
<P>
He has also delighted in making fun of NHL President John Ziegler, variously 
referring to Ziegler as "the little dictator," a "know-nothing shrimp" and a 
"twerp." 
</P>
<P>
Their battles have ranged from significant to trivial. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, when the league required that players' names appear on the backs 
of their hockey sweaters, so as to make them easier to identify on television, 
Ballard refused to comply, saying that it might hurt sales of game programs. 
</P>
<P>
When Ziegler threatened to fine the team, Ballard finally ordered that the 
names be stitched in blue on the sweaters' blue background. It was impossible 
to see them. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard also feuded with the fledgling World Hockey Assn., calling member of 
the new league "carpetbaggers." 
</P>
<P>
When Gordie Howe scored his 1,000th goal while playing for the New England 
Whalers of the WHA, Ballard refused to put the announcement on the Garden 
scoreboard, saying, "A blind man could score in that league." 
</P>
<P>
Today, it is only the force of Ballard's personality that has prevented the 
Kings from being moved to the Norris Division and the Leafs to the Smythe. That 
sensible and cost-saving move has the approval of nearly every league official, 
except Ballard. Privately, King officials say that as long as Ballard is alive, 
the move will never be approved. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SLIGHTING THE SOVIETS 
</P>
<P>
Ballard is staunchly anti-Communist, calling the Soviets, "Parasites and 
barnacles who steal our money." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in 1972, it was Ballard who sold the television rights to the first Soviet 
hockey series in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
In the years since, however, Ballard's position has not softened and he has 
reveled in the little things he could do to slight the Soviets. In September of 
1983, he canceled an appearance of the Moscow Circus at Maple Leaf Gardens. 
That was in response to the downing by Soviet fighter jets of Korean Air Lines' 
Flight 007, in which 269 people died. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, when a Soviet team played the Canadian Olympic team in the 
Gardens, this message flashed on the scoreboard: "Remember Korean Air Lines 
Flight 007 Shot Down By The Russians. Don't Cheer. Just Boo." It was signed, 
"Harold." 
</P>
<P>
Ballard has bragged that, upon visiting Lenin's tomb in Moscow, he urinated on 
the monument and then put a Maple Leaf sticker on it. 
</P>
<P>
In light of recent warmer relations between North American and Soviet hockey 
interests, Ballard's stubborn defiance is starting to be less funny and more 
unacceptable to the NHL, which has signed an agreement that will bring one of 
four Soviet teams to all NHL cities next month. Ballard must allow the Soviets 
to play the Leafs on Dec. 31, or contravene league by-laws and run the risk of 
a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
He has not said what he plans to do. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BALLARD GOES TO PRISON 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, Ballard was convicted on 47 of 49 counts of theft and fraud. He was 
found to have diverted money from the Gardens' accounts to his own. 
</P>
<P>
The 69-year-old Ballard was sentenced to three years in federal penitentiary 
and, after several weeks' assessment at Millhaven Prison, was assigned to the 
minimum security Bath Institution. There, he spent his days operating a fork 
lift in the supply department. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, though, he ran Maple Leaf Gardens business affairs from a public 
phone in the prison's visitors' room. 
</P>
<P>
Orr, like other columnists in Canada, had fun with the idea that Ballard was 
behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
"I called him Millhaven Fats for a while," Orr said. "Ballard always claimed I 
didn't know what prison he was in. He said he was at the prison at Bath. Fine. 
Then I called him the Bath Tub. He didn't like that, either." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
H.B., THE PROMOTER 
</P>
<P>
"He sees himself as the great promoter, which is a lot of bull," Orr said. "He 
couldn't promote the second coming with the original cast." 
</P>
<P>
Just the same, promoting may be the one thing Ballard has done well. Consider 
his booking of the Beatles concert in the Gardens. The group was by then, in 
the summer of 1965, a worldwide sensation. The Beatles were booked for one show 
in the Garden in August right after their triumphant show in Shea Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Weeks before the show, the lines for tickets wrapped around the building. 
Ballard watched with amazement and hit on an idea. He would sell tickets to two 
shows. However, he neglected to tell the Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein. 
</P>
<P>
When he found out, Epstein was outraged. But Ballard won. The Beatles did two 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard also figured another way to squeeze money out of the shows. 
</P>
<P>
In his book, Houston writes: "It was one of the hottest days of the summer and 
more than 300 fans fainted from the heat and hysteria as 18,000 jammed the 
arena for each performance. It was then that another plan went into effect. 
Ballard purposely delayed each performance . . . the first for 90 minutes and 
second for 75 minutes. He turned off the fountains in the arena, turned on the 
heat and told his concessions operators to put away the small cups. By selling 
large soft drinks to the thirsty fans, a large profit was made." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE FUTURE 
</P>
<P>
Ballard has had quintuple heart-bypass surgery. He is a diabetic who injects 
himself with insulin daily. He spends most of his time in a wheelchair. But he 
almost single-handedly runs the Maple Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
"They have the smallest front office of any team in the league," said one NHL 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Why does he do it and for how long will he? 
</P>
<P>
"It keeps him going," said Roseanne Rocchi, Ballard's attorney. "He loves being 
in control. He just loves it all." 
</P>
<P>
His effectiveness as an owner is simple to chart. The Leafs have been among the 
worst teams in hockey for years. Trades are made that make general managers 
stare at their desks in disbelief. Ballard has gone from being an amusing but 
bellicose figurehead to one who is in a position to irreversibly damage a 
once-great team. 
</P>
<P>
Canadians have long since lost their patience with Ballard and his rantings. 
Even though the Gardens sell out every home game, increasingly many seats are 
empty. 
</P>
<P>
Said a former Canadian columnist, reflecting national opinion of Ballard: 
"There are a lot of days when Harold Ballard gets up in the morning and he 
forgets to do up the zipper in his head." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever else he is, though, he still is the boss. And not his family, the 
league or public sentiment is likely to force him out.

PENN STATE LIKELY FOE FOR HOLIDAY; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: NITTANY LIONS HAVE AN AGREEMENT TO PLAY WESTERN ATHLETIC 
CONFERENCE CHAMPION, SOURCES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Penn State will play in the Holiday Bowl against the Western Athletic 
Conference champion, sources familiar with the bowl pairings said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Official bids cannot be extended until Nov. 25, but the sources said the 
Holiday Bowl has an unofficial agreement with Penn State to play in the Dec. 29 
bowl at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Holiday Bowl and Penn State, citing National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. rules, said they would not comment before the official selection 
date. But only an unexpected change of events could upset the pairing, the 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The opponent for the No. 17 Nittany Lions (6-2-1) has not been determined, but 
No. 21 Brigham Young has the inside track to the WAC title and the conference's 
automatic Holiday Bowl berth. The Cougars (8-2, 5-1) can clinch their first 
Holiday Bowl appearance since 1984 by beating Utah Saturday and San Diego State 
Nov. 25 in their final two games. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs (6-3-1, 4-2) are one of three teams that have a chance at the 
conference title should BYU falter. The others are Air Force (7-3, 4-1) and No. 
24 Hawaii (8-2, 5-2). 
</P>
<P>
As late as last week, sources said, Penn State likely was headed to the Hall of 
Fame Bowl in Tampa, Fla., but that scenario changed Saturday when the Nittany 
Lions were tied by Maryland, 13-13. The Hall of Fame Bowl, concerned that with 
games remaining Saturday against No. 1 Notre Dame and Nov. 25 at No. 19 
Pittsburgh the Nittany Lions could finish 6-4-1, turned its attention to No. 22 
Ohio State as a likely opponent for No. 11 Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
That brought the Holiday Bowl into the picture. The Holiday Bowl, which will 
pay a record $1 million per team, had unsuccessfully pursued Penn State in the 
past and has scouted them extensively this year. The Nittany Lions were one of 
the preferred choices to meet Brigham Young in 1984 in what turned out to be 
the national championship game, but at 6-5, Penn State elected not to go to a 
bowl that year. BYU went on to defeat Michigan, 24-17, to finish 13-0. 
</P>
<P>
The Nittany Lions, even if they lose their last two games to finish 6-4-1, are 
an attractive team, bowl sources said, because of their strong fan following 
and their position as the biggest television draw in the populous Northeast. 
The Holiday Bowl recently extended its contract with ESPN to televise the game 
through 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of Penn State also gives the Holiday Bowl an opportunity for the 
second consecutive year to spotlight the player who professional scouts 
generaly agree is the top running back in the country. The Nittany Lions are 
led by Blair Thomas, who has rushed for 1,077 yards after coming back from 
reconstructive knee surgery that sidelined him last season. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the game featured Heisman Trophy winner Barry Sanders of Oklahoma 
State, who rushed for a Holiday Bowl-record five touchdowns in a 62-14 victory 
over Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State also boasts one of the strongest defenses in the country. The 
Nittany Lions have allowed 83 points in nine games, an average of 9.3 per game. 
The most points they have yielded was in a 17-16 loss to No. 4 Alabama three 
weeks ago in which their attempt for a winning field goal was blocked in the 
final seconds. That ended a five-game winning streak that began after a 14-6 
loss to Virginia in their opener.

SUNDAY SILENCE TO UNDERGO SURGERY FOR SMALL BONE CHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY HOVDEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sunday Silence, whose recent victory in the Breeders' Cup Classic more than 
likely clinched the 1989 horse of the year title, will undergo surgery Thursday 
for the removal of a bone chip in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-minute procedure will be performed at the Hollywood Park Equine Clinic 
by Dr. Greg Ferraro. The prognosis is for a full recovery, and for Sunday 
Silence to be able to return to competition in about five months. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Charlie Whittingham had little doubt that Sunday Silence suffered the 
injury in defeating archrival Easy Goer by a neck in the Nov. 4 Classic. 
</P>
<P>
"We know he didn't have it going into the race, and yet the chip is so small it 
didn't show until we'd galloped him two or three days after he got home," 
Whittingham said. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro described the injury as nothing out of the ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
"If he had to have a chip, this is the best kind to have," the veterinarian 
said. "Unless something else is found, this type of chip has the best 
prognosis." 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham, who also owns 25% of Sunday Silence, is likewise optimistic that 
his champion 3-year-old colt will come back to the races next year as good as 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
Besides his victory in the Classic, Sunday Silence won the Kentucky Derby, the 
Preakness, the Santa Anita Derby and a record $4,578,454 in 1989. He ranks 
third in all-time earnings behind Alysheba and John Henry. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Hancock of Lexington, Ky., owns 50% of Sunday Silence and Dr. Ernest 
Gaillard of La Jolla owns the other 25%. Reached at his Stone Farm on Monday, 
Hancock said he briefly considered retiring the colt to stud. 
</P>
<P>
"From what Charlie told me, though, he'll come back 100%," Hancock said. 
"Anyway, I think 4 is a little too young to send a horse to stud. They don't 
really mature as a racehorse until they get to be 4 or 5. 
</P>
<P>
"If everything goes all right, I'd like Sunday Silence to have a shot at 
winning the Classic again next year," Hancock said. "Maybe even get the 
earnings record. Racing needs stars, and he's certainly a popular horse." 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham said he detected heat in Sunday Silence's knee late last week, a 
few days after the colt's return to Santa Anita from his victory over Easy Goer 
in the Classic at Gulfstream Park. Ferraro said that X-rays revealed a chip 
about the size of the nail on an adult's index finger. 
</P>
<P>
"It is located above the joint, and not on a weight-bearing surface," Ferraro 
said. "That's why a horse can recover quickly and be able to run very well." 
</P>
<P>
Said Whittingham: "I've had many horses come back better than ever from that 
kind of injury. We took a chip out of Balzac's knee and look what he went on to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
As a 3-year-old in 1978, Elizabeth Keck's Balzac injured his knee while 
finishing second to Affirmed in the Santa Anita Derby. He returned for 
Whittingham the next year, won the Oak Tree Invitational and earned nearly half 
a million dollars after his operation. 
</P>
<P>
Spend a Buck was another high-profile thoroughbred who bounced back after knee 
surgery for removal of a bone chip. He had that surgery in November of his 
2-year-old season, then returned in the spring of 1985 and won the Kentucky 
Derby and, eventually, was voted horse of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"There's some people who would go ahead and train a horse with a chip still in 
there," Whittingham said. "You can get away with it, but sometimes the chip 
gets to grinding away at the cartilage, and you end up with worse damage. Just 
as well to get it out of there and start fresh." 
</P>
<P>
Plans originally called for Sunday Silence to get a brief vacation and be 
pointed for the San Fernando Stakes at Santa Anita in mid-January. The injury 
will deprive him of a chance to run in the $500,000 Strub Stakes in February 
and the $1,000,000 Santa Anita Handicap in March. 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't break my heart," Whittingham said. "If he wins a lot early in the 
year, he ends up carrying too much weight in handicaps later on. Anyway, he's 
still growing. A little extra time off will do him a world of good." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence was shipped from Santa Anita to Hollywood Park early Tuesday 
morning with the rest of Whittingham's stable. The colt will remain at the 
track during his recovery, and if all goes well, Whittingham said, Sunday 
Silence could go back into training in about three months.

JIM MURRAY: HIS LEADERSHIP PUT PGA TOUR ON THE GREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't look now, but who would you guess is the longest-running commissioner in 
all the field of sports? Why, the commissioner of golf is the correct answer. 
You might say he is the Deane (ouch!) of athletic commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of people were surprised when Deane Beman became commissioner of golf in 
1974. They thought the game already had one -- Arnold Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
Other people didn't think the game needed one. Golf is the last stand of the 
freebooter, the rugged individualist in this era. Remember, these guys pay to 
play. There's no team plane, no coach, trainer. They even have to provide their 
own clubs and golf balls and get to the tee on time themselves. 
</P>
<P>
They're only semi-welcome at some of the venues they play -- L.A. Country Club 
won't even hear of having a pro tournament, even a U.S. Open. They take care of 
their own board and room and transportation. 
</P>
<P>
They are the Bedouins of sport. You would think they would be as hard to govern 
or regulate as a school of sharks. Golf is a game of self-reliance. None of 
this "We" stuff for the birdie-makers. 
</P>
<P>
Deane R. Beman was an unlikely candidate to lead this nomadic, headstrong band. 
A dry, somewhat taciturn individual who was an insurance man, Deane played golf 
the way he played life -- meticulously, cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
There was no room for error the way Beman played. When you are the short hitter 
he was, the rough is Siberia. Beman could never waste a shot. He wore out two 
four-woods a year. 
</P>
<P>
He probably never had an eagle putt in his career. If he did, he would have 
made it. He won four pro tournaments in five years, two U.S. Amateurs and was 
in a playoff for a third. He won the British Amateur and finished second in a 
U.S. Open. It was an extraordinary career for a guy who never heard anything on 
a fairway but, "I believe it's you, Deane." 
</P>
<P>
There were those who thought the professional golfers didn't need a 
commissioner so much as they needed a warden. But Beman considered the 
challenge just another par-five to a guarded green -- two woods, a seven-iron 
and one putt. 
</P>
<P>
The PGA wasn't exactly giving the product away that calendar year, but the 
prize money was $7,895,450. Last year, Beman's 15th, it was $36,959,307. 
</P>
<P>
The four-wood is still working fine. 
</P>
<P>
The plus about golf is that, other sports may sell beer and razor blades, golf 
sells Cadillacs and Caribbean cruises. You don't need big numbers in the 
ratings, just big spenders. 
</P>
<P>
The graph went steadily up. Beman ruffled feathers, talked, so to speak, on 
someone's backswing. But he was jealously protective of the tour he had been 
hired to guide. 
</P>
<P>
He put in the all-exempt tour, which eliminated Monday qualifying. The idea -- 
Gary McCord's -- was that Monday qualifying made permanent rabbits of the 
players because, once they shot their way into the tournaments they only sought 
to keep themselves there by just trying to make the cut, not to win. 
</P>
<P>
Beman also protected the sponsors. Where the by-laws mandated a player tee it 
up in at least 15 tournaments a year, guaranteeing a sponsor Nicklaus or 
Trevino in a minimum of one-third of the tournaments, there was pressure to 
relax the restriction in the case of foreign players. Beman resisted and then 
finally threw the problem in the lap of his tournament policy board and the 
general membership. 
</P>
<P>
The foreign players might have won the Ryder Cup, but they lost this 
international competition. Even if it cost the tour Seve Ballesteros, the 
15-tournament requirement stuck. The word to the Europeans was, "If you want 
our money, play our game." 
</P>
<P>
He led the PGA out of its middle-man category and into active participation 
with the formation of PGA Tour Investments, which includes 13 new stadium-type 
tournament players' courses, teaching centers and other golf real estate 
development. PGA assets have grown from $730,000 to $70 million. 
</P>
<P>
The senior tour, which began with two tournaments in 1980, is 40 tournaments 
strong and growing. The Ben Hogan Tour, golf's minor league or mini-tour, will 
kick in with 30 events next year. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at 51 regular tour events, 42 senior events and 30 Ben Hogan 
Tour events next year," Beman says. "We will be playing for a total of $75 
million." 
</P>
<P>
A pretty creditable stewardship, reflects the Deane of golf. "I'm not sure it 
can get much better." 
</P>
<P>
But Deane Beman, as usual, is not satisfied with just par. If there is a hazard 
on his fairway, it is that the PGA does not have a "major" to sell. He hankers 
either to supplant the Masters as the fourth or create his own fifth major. 
</P>
<P>
"We are running a business here," he complains. "And you have no idea what a 
plus it is to have a star event in your briefcase when you're dealing with 
television. Don't you think baseball is glad to have the World Series in its 
quiver? Football has the Super Bowl. College basketball has the Final Four. 
Hockey, the Stanley Cup. Those help sell the whole package." 
</P>
<P>
Beman has striven mightily to make, first, the World Series of Golf a "major" 
and more recently the Players Championship. 
</P>
<P>
He does this by sweetening the pot. Victory in the Players Championship 
provides for 10 years' exemption on the tour. For a golfer, that's a castle in 
Spain. 
</P>
<P>
The public, however, does not get any institutionalized goodies and it remains 
to be seen whether the players' enthusiasm can translate to fan enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rozelle is gone from pro football. Baseball has had, tragically, three 
commissioners in a year, David Stern is only in his fifth year at the helm of 
the NBA. The word czar is overworked and misleading. 
</P>
<P>
But no one speaks for his sport any more authoritatively -- or successfully -- 
than Deane Beman. As usual, you may be ahead of him off the tee. But when you 
get on the green -- well, you better make the putt.

SWIMMER VICTOR DAVIS, 25, DIES OF INJURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Victor Davis, Canada's flamboyant Olympic gold-medal swimmer, died Monday from 
injuries incurred Saturday in an accident that Montreal police still are trying 
to unravel. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, 25, was pronounced dead at 11 a.m. PST, said Jacques Charbonneau, a 
spokesman for Notre Dame Hospital in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors gave Davis little chance of surviving after suffering a severe skull 
fracture, brain and spinal damage and multiple bruises from being hit by a car. 
</P>
<P>
Charbonneau said that at the family's request, Davis' body remains connected to 
life-support systems to keep his organs -- which were not injured in the 
accident -- viable for use in transplants. 
</P>
<P>
Davis will be buried in his hometown of Guelph, in southern Ontario. Funeral 
services are expected to be held Friday, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, with a Maple Leaf tattoo on his chest, Davis became a national hero 
when he won a gold medal in the 200-meter breaststroke and a silver in the 
100-meter breaststroke at the Los Angeles Games. 
</P>
<P>
Police have said they are treating the case as a traffic accident and have 
turned the case over to the accident investigation squad. No charges have been 
filed, which has led to some confusion and controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' family and friends have questions about the incident and his family has 
hired a well known Montreal criminal lawyer to explore further course of 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the Davis case is not classified as hit-and-run because the driver 
of the car went to the police station after the accident. The driver, a 
19-year-old man who has not been identified, told police he thought he hit 
something. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the same as leaving the scene of an accident," said Pat Hickey of the 
Montreal Gazette. "One of the reasons you would have that distinction is 
because you have a lot of remote areas and it is difficult to wait around for 
police." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, police said they have not laid manslaughter charges because 
details of the accident are unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they are examining the car to figure out who is responsible for the 
accident outside a bar in suburban Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue. The bar is one of six 
along a narrow strip about a mile from John Abbott Community College. 
</P>
<P>
Three men who were in the car told police that Davis was standing in the road 
and threw a bottle of orange soda at the car, cracking the windshield. 
</P>
<P>
They told police that they panicked and sped away, but did not see what 
happened to Davis. They said they assumed he moved out of their way. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' girlfriend, Donna Clavel, however, had a conflicting account. 
</P>
<P>
Clavel, 22, said Saturday that the three men were drinking at a table next to 
Clavel, her friend, Jennifer Watts, and Davis. She said her group left the bar 
and Davis walked across the street to buy an orange soda. When Davis returned, 
the men were outside shouting at Clavel and Watts, Clavel said. 
</P>
<P>
Clavel said the men got into their car and drove to the corner and turned 
toward Davis, who was standing in the street. She said the car accelerated and 
hit Davis, although he tried to get out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
"In the American system there is some sort of charge of negligence even if not 
deliberate, but that does not exist here," Hickey said. "This could be written 
off as an auto accident."

DODGERS, ANGELS PLAN TALKS WITH FREE AGENT LANGSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Set to battle over free agents Mark Langston and Robin Yount in what may become 
a Freeway Series of a different nature, the Dodgers and Angels begin the 
process today, when Fred Claire, the Dodgers executive vice president, meets 
with left-handed pitcher Langston and his agent, Arn Tellem. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, according to a source, have a Wednesday meeting with Langston and 
Tellem. 
</P>
<P>
Langston is believed to favor the Dodgers, Angels and San Diego Padres on the 
basis of location, but bidding is expected to stretch from coast to coast, and 
began Monday when the 90 players who filed for free agency were eligible to 
accept offers from clubs other than their own. 
</P>
<P>
Langston heard from only the Seattle Mariners, under new ownership since 
Langston, who spent five-plus seasons there, was traded to the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
Yount, as a center fielder who can bat leadoff, represents the solution to the 
Dodgers' two most pressing needs. 
</P>
<P>
Yount is vacationing in Hawaii. The speculation is that, at 34, he is reluctant 
to leave the American League and may be interested in the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tony DeMarco, the agent for free agent pitcher Fernando Valenzuela, 
said the Dodgers have increased their offer from one year to one year and an 
option for 1991, but the money in both years is still less than the $1.85 
million that Valenzuela received in 1989 and far less than the three-year, 
$6-million package that Valenzuela is believed to be seeking. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Bill Plaschke and Helene Elliott contributed to this story.

Jim Rice was placed on waviers Monday, ending 15 seasons with the Boston Red 
Sox that produced 382 homers, 1,451 RBIs and 2,452 hits. 
</P>
<P>
Rice will become an unrestricted free agent Thursday if he clears waivers. The 
Red Sox last month refused to exercise a $2.4-million option in his contract 
for 1990.

Rice batted .234 last season with three homers and 28 runs batted in. He had

MALONE, STOCKTON LEAD JAZZ TO VICTORY

<TEXT>
<P>
Karl Malone had 33 points and 16 rebounds and John Stockton had 30 points and 
16 assists Monday night to lead the Utah Jazz to a 106-93 victory over the 
Washington Bullets at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
The Jazz led 50-44 at halftime as both teams shot poorly. Utah outscored 
Washington, 16-7, to start the second half to take a 66-51 lead. Stockton had 
five points during the run, Malone had four and Bob Hansen made a three-point 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
Ledell Eackles led the Bullets with 24 points, but Washington's two leading 
scorers, Jeff Malone and Bernard King, finished with four and seven points, 
respectively. Malone averaged 27.5 points as the Bullets won five of their 
first six games, and King averaged 18 points. 
</P>

The Bullets scored the first seven points of the fourth quarter to close to 
79-70 with 9:45 remaining, but that was as close as they got.

Atlanta 112, Orlando 104 -- Dominique Wilkins scored 34 points and Moses Malone

BRUINS ARE GIVEN ANOTHER REASON TO POINT FOR TROJANS

The sobering news from Las Vegas hit Mike Lodish "like a kick in the face," the 
UCLA defensive tackle said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
USC was installed as a 17-point favorite over UCLA for Saturday's game at the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA hasn't been considered such a longshot since 1983, when it was a 17 
1/2-point underdog before losing to Nebraska, 42-10. 
</P>
<P>
Even 10 years ago, when they endured their only other losing season under Coach 
Terry Donahue and went against a USC team that included Heisman Trophy 
winners-to-be Charles White and Marcus Allen, the Bruins were only 14 1/2-point 
underdogs before losing, 49-14. 
</P>
<P>
The latest betting line, Lodish said, "shows disrespect for a program that has 
done so well in the last seven or eight years." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, a 3-7 record and a five-game losing streak, the Bruins' longest in 
one season since 1963, aren't exactly shining lights. 
</P>
<P>
The oddsmakers' low opinion of the Bruins, Lodish said, could serve as a 
motivating factor for the Bruins against a Trojan team that is 8-2 and ranked 
eighth, has the nation's No. 1 rushing defense and has clinched a third 
consecutive trip to the Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
"It bothered me, yet at the same time it might help us," Lodish said of the 
point spread. "If we can stick (the Trojans) hard in the beginning and really 
press them, that would be the only chance we would have of beating them." 
</P>
<P>
A victory over USC, Lodish said, would make the Bruins' season. 
</P>
<P>
Said Mike Farr, the Bruins' senior split end: "I'm not going to say it would 
make our season, but it would take away some of the pain we've felt in the last 
six weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Both Lodish and Farr, who came to UCLA four years ago after playing together at 
Brother Rice High School in Birmingham, Mich., said that the prospect of a 
Bruin upset this week is not as outlandish as some might think. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a great team," Lodish said of the Trojans. "There's really nothing you 
can say against the Trojans. They're very intense players -- their defense is 
outstanding. But they're beatable. 
</P>
<P>
"You just have to keep hammering them and coming at them." 
</P>
<P>
Tenacity, of course, is an intangible the Bruins have lacked. 
</P>
<P>
Their starting quarterback, Bret Johnson, hasn't led a second-half touchdown 
drive in their last six games and the Bruin defense has faltered more often 
than not after halftime, allowing Oregon State and Washington to mount long 
drives to game-winning scores. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan, Stanford and Oregon also overtook the Bruins after halftime. Last 
Saturday at the Rose Bowl, Oregon outscored UCLA in the second half, 24-0. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes in the second half we tend to -- not fold -- but we aren't as 
solid," Lodish said. 
</P>
<P>
The season, obviously, hasn't unfolded as planned. 
</P>
<P>
"The expectations we had were that we were going to be a contender for the Rose 
Bowl and that it was going to come down to the USC-UCLA game again," Lodish 
said. "We thought we had every chance in the world to go undefeated until this 
game." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't happen, but a victory over the Trojans, Lodish said, would at least 
take some of the sting out of what could be the Bruins' losingest season since 
1963. 
</P>
<P>
"We would be the only Pac-10 team to beat them," he said. "Considering our 
record, that would be quite an accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
Quite an upset, too. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson has been pulled from three of the Bruins' last four games, but asked if 
the redshirt freshman will start again this week, Donahue said: "I'm 
anticipating right now that he will." 
</P>
<P>
Will Jim Bonds play? 
</P>
<P>
"It depends how the game goes, but I would say that we wouldn't hesitate to use 
him," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Donahue said that Johnson and Bonds would share time in the Bruins' 
last two games, but Bonds didn't play against Oregon until the fourth quarter 
-- after the Ducks converted two third-quarter interceptions by Johnson into 
touchdowns and a 28-20 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Craig Davis, asked if the Bruins would attempt to intimidate USC's 
redshirt freshman quarterback, Todd Marinovich: "He's not going to be too 
intimidated by a team that's 3-7." 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
Freshman cornerback Carlton Gray said Monday that, after returning home to 
Cincinnati for a week after the USC game, he will join the UCLA basketball 
team. Gray, a 6-foot-2 point guard, was a high school All-American last season 
at Cincinnati's Forest Park High School. . . . Senior split end Mike Farr, 
asked if the shuffling of quarterbacks has divided the team into Bret Johnson 
and Jim Bonds camps, said: "I'm sure some players have their own preferences 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
Describing USC's defense as fabulous, Coach Terry Donahue said: "Over the 
years, I've seen them have some really good defensive teams, but I'm not sure 
this isn't as good as any defensive team I've seen." . . . Donahue, on USC 
linebacker Junior Seau: "I'm not sure anybody in the league plays any harder 
than he does. He's become a dominant player."

PADRES PREPARE GALA IN HOPES DAVIS WILL WIN CY YOUNG AWARD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Padres are hoping to welcome back reliever Mark Davis today with a gala 
celebratory party at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Lane, the Padres' Chicago-based attorney, already has sent in his RSVP. 
The entire Padre front-office will be on hand. Reporters and cameramen are sure 
to be there scribbling notes and taking footage of every smile and each 
thank-you speech. 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, but before anyone gets the wrong idea, this is not going to be a press 
conference announcing that Davis is re-signing with the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
No, what the Padres are anxiously anticipating, is that they can stage a 
ceremony announcing Davis as winner of the National League Cy Young Award. 
</P>
<P>
Davis and Mike Scott of the Houston Astros are expected to finish in the top 
two spots in the Cy Young balloting, with the winner being anybody's guess. 
Davis led the big-leagues with 44 saves. Scott led the National League with a 
20-10 record. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement will be made at 3 p.m. (Pacific Standard Time) today, and if 
Davis is declared the winner, the Davis family will be headed on the first 
flight out to San Diego, compliments of the Padres. If Davis finishes second, 
well, a telephone hookup will have to do. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone had told me four years ago that Mark would be up for the Cy Young 
award," said Candy Davis, his wife, "I'd say you belong in a loony bin. It's 
really hard to believe what's happening." 
</P>
<P>
It was four years ago when Davis was coming off a 5-12 season in his first 
season as a reliever for the San Francisco Giants. The year before he was 5-17. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he's considered the best reliever in the game. 
</P>
<P>
He was honored Monday in New York by Rolaids for his accomplishments, but 
instead of being able to savor the award, he was hounded by questions of his 
free agency. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres' last offer Friday to Davis was a three-year guaranteed contract for 
about $6 million, but on Monday, agent Alan Hendricks began listening to offers 
from other teams. Hendricks and Lane talked again Monday, but no new offers 
were exchanged. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have any discussions of any consequence," Lane said, "but we will 
keep the lines of communication open. 
</P>
<P>
"We made sure today that it was OK to bring Mark out if he wins the Cy Young, 
and Alan was very supportive. We're dying for Mark to win the Cy Young, and 
after that, we're dying to sign him." 
</P>
<P>
Davis and his wife still are hopeful of re-signing with the Padres, but because 
he still is without a contract, he said Monday he has no choice but to listen 
to other offers. 
</P>
<P>
"I had hoped after the season that it would be done fairly quickly," Davis 
said, "but it wasn't, so we have other options we would like to consider."

TIE VOTE ALLOWS MERGER OF DETROIT PAPERS; 
</P>
<P>
MEDIA: THE SUPREME COURT SPLITS 4-4 ON LETTING THE TWO DAILIES COMBINE BUSINESS 
OPERATIONS. BUT THE LARGER ANTITRUST ISSUE REMAINS UNSETTLED.

<P>
The Supreme Court, on a tie vote, cleared the way Monday for Detroit's two 
daily newspapers to merge their business operations. But the justices left open 
the pivotal question of what conditions justify giving newspapers a virtual 
business monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
As a practical matter, the high court action ends a 13-year-old newspaper war 
in the nation's sixth-largest metropolitan area and permits the Detroit Free 
Press and the Detroit News to share their business, printing and advertising 
operations. The two papers will retain independent news and editorial page 
staffs. 
</P>
<P>
As a legal matter, however, the court was unable to define the point at which 
two closely matched and money-losing papers can be offered relief from 
competition under the 1970 Newspaper Preservation Act. Because the justices 
were deadlocked 4-4, they issued only a one-line order affirming an appeals 
court ruling approving the Detroit merger. 
</P>
<P>
The 1970 law created an exemption from the nation's antitrust laws to save 
competing newspapers. If one paper is in "probable danger" of "failing," 
according to the law, it can ask the Justice Department for a "joint operating 
agreement" with its competitor. 
</P>
<P>
But according to critics, the law, instead of preserving real competition, is 
actually permitting large media corporations to create business monopolies. 
</P>
<P>
The two Detroit papers, now subsidiaries of the nation's two largest newspaper 
chains, cut their prices and advertising rates in 1976 and then ran up huge 
losses. Between 1979 and 1986, the Detroit Free Press, a Knight-Ridder paper, 
said it had lost $81 million, and its directors sought relief under the 1970 
law. If the Free Press were not permitted a partial merger with the News, 
Knight-Ridder officials threatened to shut down their paper. 
</P>
<P>
But a group of Detroit-area advertisers and union workers who challenged the 
newspaper merger contended that the Free Press essentially manufactured its 
losses, with the intent of gaining a monopoly. As they saw it, Knight-Ridder 
pursued a fail-safe strategy. If it could force the then independently owned 
Detroit News to fold, its paper would have the market to itself. If not, it 
could then ask the government for the JOA, which creates an advertising 
monopoly for the two papers. Last year, Knight-Ridder officials refused to talk 
to William McMaster, a Michigan investor, who said he wanted to buy the Free 
Press and continue its independent operation. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, four members of the Supreme Court voted to uphold last year's 
decision by former Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III approving the JOA in Detroit. 
Four other justices voted to overturn Meese and block the merger. A deadlock 
was created when Justice Byron R. White bowed out of the case for what he said 
were "personal reasons." 
</P>
<P>
In February, a federal appeals court in Washington, on 5-4 vote, had ruled in 
Meese's favor, and the Supreme Court's action Monday upholds that ruling. The 
court did not say how the justices voted. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the court's 4-4 split brought differing interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
Edward J. Atorino, a newspaper analyst with Salomon Bros., said the court 
decision means that a JOA "is still a viable out for the newspaper business to 
save a competing voice in the market." 
</P>
<P>
But Washington lawyer William Schultz, who represented those who challenged the 
Detroit JOA, said the close vote in the high court "sends a strong signal for 
newspapers to think twice" before seeking relief from competition. "It's our 
hope this will be enough to keep newspapers competing on their own," said 
Schultz. He added that he may file a petition seeking a rehearing by the 
justices, but such petitions are rarely granted. 
</P>
<P>
Under a JOA, the two newspapers not only save money on printing and other 
business operations, but they can afford to charge more for subscriptions and 
advertising. In Detroit, the JOA is expected to convert what had been annual 
losses of $10 million a year for both papers into an estimated 
$100-million-a-year profit to be shared by the two companies. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department says 23 cities, including San Francisco and Seattle, 
have newspapers operating under JOAs, but Detroit is the largest.

JAPANESE GROUP TO BUY BILTMORE FOR AN ESTIMATED $219 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stately Biltmore hotel and office complex in downtown Los Angeles is being 
sold for a reported $219 million to Japanese investors, it was revealed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Biltmore Partners, a limited partnership, agreed to sell the Biltmore Plaza to 
T.A.T. Los Angeles Ltd., a partnership that real estate sources say is composed 
of two large, low-profile Japanese companies that own more than $1 billion 
worth of properties in Hawaii and California. The Biltmore Plaza includes the 
renovated 66-year-old Biltmore Hotel and office building and a 2-year-old 
office tower. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction reflects renewed health in the downtown Los Angeles hotel 
market and would put an even bigger piece of downtown Los Angeles into the 
hands of foreign owners. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement also follows by less than two weeks the completion of the sale of 
another major downtown hotel, the Los Angeles Hilton &amp; Towers, for $168 
million to South Korean investors, including Korean Air Lines. 
</P>
<P>
Biltmore Partners, managed and primarily owned by the First Boston Corp. 
investment banking firm, did not reveal the identity of T.A.T. Los Angeles 
other than to say it is a Delaware corporation composed of investors who have 
been "very active in the development and ownership of hotel and residential 
properties in Hawaii and California." 
</P>
<P>
But real estate sources said the companies in T.A.T. Los Angeles own more than 
$1 billion worth of properties in Hawaii and California, including hotels owned 
under various names with U.S. partners. In Hawaii, those hotels include Hyatt 
and Westin properties, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Biltmore Partners also declined to reveal the sales price for the 700-room 
Biltmore Hotel, the 24-story Biltmore Tower, which contains 130,000 square feet 
of office space, and the Biltmore Court, a wing of the old hotel that was 
renovated into 235,000 square feet of office space. 
</P>
<P>
But sources in the real estate community put the sales price at about $219 
million. The transaction, which is expected to close within 90 days, reportedly 
is being financed by the Industrial Bank of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Biltmore Partners bought the then-threadbare hotel in December, 1984, for $75 
million. The group subsequently spent $200 million sprucing up the hotel -- $40 
million went into the luxury hotel alone -- building the tower and converting 
part of the hotel into offices. 
</P>
<P>
The Biltmore price is difficult to compare to other properties because of the 
mix of hotel and office space, real estate and hotel experts said. But, they 
noted, the $168-million downtown Hilton deal, which was completed Nov. 2, 
included a slightly larger hotel with less office space that was nearly fully 
leased. Offices at Biltmore Plaza are only about 60% leased, real estate 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel will continued to be managed by Windsor Hotel Group, whose principals 
are Carlos C. Lopes and Eric Prevette. 
</P>
<P>
The management company's aggressive marketing of the hotel has done much to 
improve occupancy and raise room rates in the last 18 months, said Bruce 
Baltin, a partner in Pannell Kerr Forster, an accounting firm whose specialties 
include hotel consulting. 
</P>
<P>
"From the marketing perception, it's turned from a loser to a winner," Baltin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been well received in the market," said R. Britton Colbert, a senior 
principal in charge of the hotel and restaurant practice at Laventhol &amp; 
Horwath, a Los Angeles-based accounting firm. "You always like to see an older 
hotel that has been renovated come back." 
</P>
<P>
Occupancy in general has been rising at downtown hotels during the last few 
years, and the market has become increasingly competitive, Colbert said. The 
downtown Hyatt recently reopened after a renovation, and the Hilton also has 
been redone. 
</P>
<P>
Hotels had a rough time of it until recently because there was little to bring 
people downtown to spend the night, he said. But a growing entertainment scene 
and more successful office buildings rejuvenated the market, he said. The 
expansion of the Los Angeles Convention Center in the early 1990s will help 
even more, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Biltmore Partners took an aging dowager of a hotel that was gripped by 
less-than-genteel decay and turned it into a luxury showplace while retaining 
the building's historic touches. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel was built by a group of local businessmen at a cost of $10 million 
and opened on Oct. 1, 1923, to much fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
In 1927, the Biltmore hosted a banquet at which the Academy of Motion Picture 
Arts &amp; Sciences was formed and the design for the Oscar was conceived. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel was billed as the "largest and grandest hotel west of Chicago," and 
served as a rest stop for celebrities, royalty and several U.S. presidents, 
including Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy.

GRIFFIN TO REDUCE ROLE IN RESORTS TO DELAY BANKRUPTCY; 
</P>
<P>
CASINOS: BONDHOLDERS ARE TO BECOME THE COMPANY'S NEW MAJORITY OWNERS UNDER A 
SWEEPING FINANCIAL REORGANIZATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hollywood producer Merv Griffin has agreed to sharply reduce his ownership in 
Resorts International as part of a sweeping financial reorganization that 
temporarily delays bankruptcy for the ailing casino company, it was announced 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the plan is a proposal for Griffin to reduce his majority 
ownership in Resorts to 22% in exchange for a steep reduction in the company's 
debt. The reorganization makes the bondholders the new majority owners of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Griffin indicated that better days are ahead for 
Resorts, which owns casino hotels in Atlantic City and the Bahamas. "I'm going 
to work my butt off to get value for that company and it can be done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Resorts also announced that it has set aside money to fund bondholder 
litigation against Donald J. Trump, the Manhattan real estate developer from 
whom Griffin bought Resorts last year. 
</P>
<P>
Though not final, the agreement is a milestone in Griffin's efforts to 
extricate himself from his severe difficulties as a casino operator. 
</P>
<P>
He has owned the company for only a year, during which it has been continually 
buffeted by heavy losses and turmoil. Griffin, whose 24-year career as a 
television talk show host ended in 1986, presently owns 95% of Resorts. 
</P>
<P>
The reorganization calls for bondholders to agree to sharp reductions in 
principal on the company's long-term debt, which now has a face value of over 
$900 million. 
</P>
<P>
Resorts bondholders would receive new debt valued at $400 million plus a 78% 
equity interest in a new, publicly traded company headed by Griffin. Griffin 
would be chairman of the new firm and have the power to pick a majority of its 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after weeks of arduous negotiations, pitting Resorts 
against the committees representing the bondholders. The bondholders range from 
institutional investors to retirees. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals will now go to the bondholders for their approval, a process that 
will likely take two to three months. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been major concessions on all sides," said Kaye Handley, an analyst 
for R. D. Smith &amp; Co. in New York, an investment firm that specializes in 
distressed securities. "This was a sincere effort to come up with a capital 
structure that the company can afford." 
</P>
<P>
Handley added, however, that there are "significant dissensions" in the ranks 
of the unsecured bondholders. "It's not at all clear that it will go through," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilbur Ross, investment adviser to the secured bondholders, said the creditors' 
committees went along with the agreement largely because Griffin would still be 
in charge as chairman and chief stockholder. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the single most important part of the deal," said Ross, an investment 
banker for Rothschild Inc. in New York. "Normally, the creditors hate the 
management and want them thrown out." 
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for Griffin to invest an additional $30 million in Resorts, 
but Resorts has also agreed to cancel a $50-million loan that it made to one of 
Griffin's companies. The net effect is that Griffin's personal investment in 
the firm will be reduced from $100 million to $90 million, officials close to 
the deal said. 
</P>
<P>
Resorts officials are betting heavily that its fortunes will improve 
dramatically when Trump opens his $1-billion-plus Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic 
City next April. Resorts and the Taj are located next to one another at the 
eastern end of the city's storied Boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that once Donald opens the Taj, it will bring hordes of people to that 
end of the Boardwalk," Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
But Resorts' unsecured bondholders are still likely to sue Trump, charging that 
his sale of Resorts to Griffin was a fraud and did not leave Resorts with 
enough assets to pay its debts. In a statement, Resorts said it would set aside 
an initial amount of $5 million to "fund litigation against Mr. Trump" and his 
companies. Any proceeds from the litigation will be distributed to the 
bondholders, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Trump answered with a statement of his own, saying Griffin should accept "full 
responsibility for Resorts' current financial problems" and urged him not to 
pursue "wholly baseless and ultimately wasteful claims against me." 
</P>
<P>
Resorts' restructuring is a complex plan that deals with six separate bond 
issues dating back 10 years. The first four were unsecured issues that were 
sold to a mix of small and large investors, while the last two issues were 
secured offerings sold mainly to institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the secured bondholders will accept relatively minor 
reductions in principal in exchange for a 2.5% interest in Resorts' new issue 
of common stock. The unsecured bondholders are being asked to take sharp 
reductions in principal in exchange for more than three-quarters of the stock. 
</P>
<P>
The plan allows Resorts to avoid cash interest payments on the bonds for at 
least the first year, thus permitting the firm to continue with a much-needed 
$50-million renovation of its flagship property, an aged casino hotel in 
Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
Only last Friday, Resorts announced that it was likely that its creditors would 
shortly file petitions to force the company to operate in bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
Though creditors did file those petitions on Sunday to preserve their legal 
claims against Trump, it should be several weeks or months before Resorts is 
legally forced to operate under the supervision of a bankruptcy judge. 
</P>
<P>
And, creditors say, if the reorganization plan is swiftly approved, it is 
likely that Resorts' stay in bankruptcy court will be short. The plan needs the 
approval of at least two-thirds of the bondholders as well as the consent of 
regulatory authorities in New Jersey and the Bahamas.

DEAL REFLECTS JAPANESE PUSH INTO HOTELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY YOSHIHARA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Biltmore Hotel will become the newest entry on a list of some of the 
world's best-known hotel and leisure properties that are now owned by Japanese 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
The purchases are part of the massive flow of Japanese investments that have 
poured into the United States and other foreign countries over the last three 
years. Since the Japanese have exhausted most of the prestige "trophy" office 
buildings available for purchase, they have diversified into other types of 
properties, such as hotels. 
</P>
<P>
But the interest in leisure properties reflects another strategy as well: To 
capture and recycle some of the money spent abroad by the ubiquitous Japanese 
tourists, of whom a record 8.5 million are expected to travel to foreign 
countries this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese investment dollar is looking to diversify geographically and by 
product type globally," explained Jack Barthell, a managing partner at the real 
estate consulting firm of Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years ago, Japanese investments in leisure properties were mostly 
confined by choice along the blue shores of Waikiki. Today, they span the world 
from Australia to China to Brazil and Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
The list reads like a Who's Who of a five-star travel guide: Hotel Bel Air in 
Beverly Hills, the Inter-Continental Hotel chain, the Algonquin in New York, 
Moana in Honolulu, Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades, Dana Point Resort 
in Laguna Niguel and La Costa Resort &amp; Spa. 
</P>
<P>
Purchases of U.S. hotels and other leisure properties accounted for about 22% 
of the record $16.5 billion Japanese interests invested in all U.S. real estate 
in 1988, according to Kenneth Leventhal. "We expect the dollar amount and 
percentage of the total will significantly increase from 1988 levels," Barthell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's move into a more consumer-oriented economy is encouraging more leisure 
time. Travel ties in to hotel, resorts, golf courses and other leisure 
activities. "It's like ANA (All Nippon Airways) having hotels and flights in 
cities, a kind of vertical integration," said Barthell. 
</P>
<P>
That in turn helps from a merchandising standpoint. "It's not unlike United 
Airlines a few years ago when it bought Hertz and Hilton Hotels . . . it's good 
business," he added. (United's parent company has subsequently divested itself 
of those properties.) 
</P>
<P>
"The tourist factor can't be exaggerated," said Christopher Mead, editor of the 
monthly newsletter, Japanese Investment in U.S. Real Estate Review. "Southern 
California is a major destination for Japanese tourists." 
</P>
<P>
Destinations and places with well-known and prestigious names are a big lure. 
"The Japanese focus on prestige properties," added Mead. "Japanese like to 
focus on prestige items whether it's hand luggage or suits or foreign guests, 
like President Reagan. They are willing to pay top dollar for recognizable 
names. The prestige value goes beyond (the tourist), they can list a property 
in the corporate brochure of the parent company, it helps to enhance or add 
prestige." 
</P>
<P>
Barthell said Japanese investors also like hotels because "they are operating 
businesses, not just real estate plays. They can be operated effectively and 
more profitably if money is spent on physical appearance and upkeep in the 
level of service. Also hotels are perceived in this country to be overbuilt and 
risky investments. They are overbuilt and risky but we're not seeing more 
hotels coming on line, so those that exist can do better."

Ex-Banker Pleads Guilty: A former Tustin bank president pleaded guilty to 
conspiracy for giving phony credit information to five Las Vegas casinos so 
they would approve credit lines for several alleged organized crime officials. 
Roger McGinnis, 52, of Orange, admitted in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles 
that while president of Far Western Bank in 1984 he helped to provide bad 
credit information to five casinos. He faces up to five years in prison and a 
$10,000 fine. Sentencing is scheduled for Jan. 18.

JAPAN'S TRADE SURPLUS TAKES RECORD DROP

Japan's trade surplus plunged 39.4% to $4.66 billion in October from $7.68 
billion a year earlier, the largest fall ever recorded, the Finance Ministry 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Booming demand for imports, dramatically weaker exports and a strong dollar 
were behind the data, economists said. They expected the total 1989 surplus to 
narrow markedly from last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We should see a significant decline this year," said Soichi Enkyo, an 
economist at Bank of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
"These are made-to-order numbers, and they get Japan off the hook for the GATT 
meeting this week," said Ken Courtis, senior economist at DB Capital Markets 
(Asia). 
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade starts Wednesday in 
Tokyo. The world trade body will discuss disputes including those arising from 
Japan's large trade surplus. 
</P>
<P>
International Trade and Industry Minister Hikaru Matsunaga was quoted as saying 
Monday that the surplus would narrow to about $84 billion in 1989 from $95 
billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not so much that exports are collapsing, but that imports are up," 
Courtis said. 
</P>
<P>
Imports in October surged 16.3% from a year earlier to $18.33 billion. 
Economists said exports sank to their lowest level since June, 1985, shrinking 
1.9% to $22.99 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Strong Japanese domestic demand for wood, timber, pulp, paper, natural gas and 
other raw materials helped boost imports, analysts said. Crude oil imports 
surged. 
</P>
<P>
"Strong Japanese domestic demand is helping import growth," said Chiharu 
Sumita, economist at investment house UBS Phillips &amp; Drew International. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted a 30.6% rise in imports from the European Community in October.

LOWER INTEREST RATES HELP HOME RESALES RISE 2.7%

Resales of single-family houses increased 2.7% in the third quarter, spurred by 
lower interest rates and recovering markets in the South and Midwest, the 
National Assn. of Realtors reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In California, 501,600 existing single-family homes closed escrow during the 
third quarter, down 4.2% from the previous quarter and 14.6% below the third 
quarter of 1988, according to the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the median price of a home slipped 0.4% from $201,729 in the second 
quarter to $200,933 in the third quarter. Even with the decline, the 
third-quarter median price was 14.6% higher than the like period a year ago, 
when the median price was $175,400. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the national median price for a house rose 2.1% to $95,000, although 
there were wide regional differences, the realtors group said. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've got here is a picture of a housing market in which activity remains 
historically strong, but varies across the country," said John Tuccillo, the 
realtors' chief economist.

BUSINESS GROUPS PLEAD FOR HEALTH-CARE SUPPORT; 
</P>
<P>
WORKPLACE: THE SKYROCKETING COST OF EMPLOYEE BENEFITS PROMPTS FOUR ASSOCIATIONS 
TO ASK CONGRESS FOR HELP. THEIR APPEAL IS A REVERSAL OF PAST STANDS ON THE 
ISSUE.

Four powerful business groups, admitting that "we are losing the . . . battle 
to make available quality health care at reasonable cost" to workers, pleaded 
for help Monday from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The urgent tone of the appeal marked a sharp reversal of business's traditional 
antipathy to government involvement in health-care issues. Frightened by 
medical-care costs that are rising at twice the rate of inflation, powerful 
segments of the business community seem willing to consider government controls 
that might have been unthinkable a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between business and government "is essential if we wish to retain 
the vitality of our current health-care system and yet be economically 
competitive in the future," said a letter that was sent to every member of 
Congress. It was issued by the National Assn. of Manufacturers, the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business and the 
National Assn. of Wholesaler-Distributors. 
</P>
<P>
The groups represent a broad range of employers, from giant manufacturing 
companies to tiny "mom-and-pop" stores. 
</P>
<P>
Business spent $162.5 billion last year for their workers' group health 
insurance and for Medicare's share of the payroll tax, according to the 
manufacturer's group. Spending has climbed 31% since 1985, outpacing the 21% 
growth in the nation's production of goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
"America's health-care system is considered by many to be the best in the 
world, yet its cost threatens to undermine its viability," the business groups 
said in their letter. 
</P>
<P>
"Effectively managing health-care inflation is a top priority of the business 
community -- a concern expressed in various corporate surveys and national 
polls," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
The groups made no specific proposals. Instead, their letter seemed to concede 
that business is finding it impossible to control spending for health care and 
wants government help. 
</P>
<P>
Many companies have been trying to control growth in health-care outlays by 
shifting costs to their employees. Some have increased the deductible that 
their workers must pay before insurance coverage begins; others have required 
workers to pay more of the monthly insurance premium. 
</P>
<P>
Some workers have rebelled. In the bitter strike by miners at Pittston Coal in 
Virginia, a key issue is the withdrawal of some health benefits for retired 
miners. The recent strike at various telephone companies involved an 
unsuccessful management proposal that workers pay more for their health-care 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Employers have also sought to cut costs by paying a fixed fee to health 
maintenance organizations for the yearly health care of their workers. But HMOs 
have failed to deliver the promised savings, the business groups said. 
</P>
<P>
The country needs to improve "health-care quality while controlling its cost, 
and phasing in access for the uninsured," the groups said in their letter to 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"We are striving toward this goal and earnestly require your help in this most 
difficult task. Such cooperation is essential if we wish to retain the validity 
of our current health-care system and yet be economically competitive in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
NAM President-elect Jerry J. Jasinowski said Monday that "the major business 
groups agree on the need to improve quality, reduce health-care costs, expand 
access on a phased basis, make data on health-care providers publicly available 
and evaluate the safety and effectiveness of new medical technologies." 
</P>
<P>
The letter "represents nearly the entire gamut of American business," 
Jasinowski said. "I can't think of many issues such a diverse group can agree 
on. But controlling health costs . . . has business speaking in one voice." 
</P>
<P>
The United States spends about $600 billion a year on health care. That 
represents 11.2% of the nation's economic output, or about twice the spending 
rate in the other major industrialized nations.

Dataproducts Faces Another Foe: David J. Greene &amp; Co., a New York 
investment firm, raised its stake in Dataproducts Corp. to 5.5% and threw its 
support behind another group's effort to oust Dataproducts' directors. In a 
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Greene said it now owns 1.1 
million shares of the Woodland Hills-based maker of computer printers. Greene 
also said it favors a proposal by DPC Acquisition Partners to take over 
Dataproducts' board and then liquidate the company. DPC also had made a 
$10-a-share tender offer to buy the company, which Dataproducts rejected.

WALL REFUSES TO RESIGN AS TOP S&amp;L REGULATOR

<P>
Embattled savings and loan regulator M. Danny Wall refused to resign Monday and 
said President Bush "wants to hear the other side of the story." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said in an interview published Saturday that he is considering whether to 
dismiss Wall, who is under fire for his handling of the investigation of 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
But Wall, after testifying at a congressional hearing Monday, told reporters 
that the President "knows that one is innocent until proven guilty." He said he 
had acted properly in handling the case of Lincoln, which suffered a financial 
collapse that may ultimately cost the taxpayers $2 billion, making it the 
biggest single thrift failure. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew far less than people think we did," said Wall, who rejected a 
recommendation by federal regulators in San Francisco in 1987 that the Federal 
Home Loan Bank Board seize Lincoln then. Instead, the bank board seized Lincoln 
in April of this year, after its losses had mounted substantially. 
</P>
<P>
"We had insufficient basis to take the actions (the San Francisco regulators 
were) asking for," Wall said. He was chairman of the bank board then and is now 
chairman of its successor agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision. 
</P>
<P>
The Lincoln issue has become politically explosive because of efforts by five 
senators, including Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), to intervene with federal 
officials on Lincoln's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Wall said Monday that Cranston's calls to him in 1987 and 1989 were "perfectly 
appropriate." In 1987, Wall said, Cranston urged a prompt decision on a pending 
regulatory review of Lincoln, and in 1989 Cranston asked for a rapid decision 
on whether the government would permit the sale of Lincoln to outside 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said Monday that the Senate 
Ethics Committee is conducting a serious inquiry into the actions of the five 
senators: Cranston, Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), John Glenn (D-Ohio), Dennis 
DeConcini (D-Ariz.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.).

merger in American history on Nov. 27, joining business operations but keeping 
separate news staffs, the papers announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came within hours of the 4-4 Supreme Court vote clearing the 
way for the merger, three years and a spate of legal hurdles after Gannett Co. 
and Knight-Ridder announced the proposed truce in April, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The merger will cost an estimated 500 people their jobs and ends one of the 
last knives-and-chains newspaper rumbles in the country, but it will ensure the 
Free Press' survival. Knight-Ridder had promised to close the paper if the 
merger were not approved. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever said a tie was like kissing your sister didn't have it quite right," 
Detroit Free Press Executive Editor Heath Meriwether said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it hurts competition, creates a monopoly, and I think it sets a bad 
precedent for other markets in the country," said Allen Lengel, staff writer of 
the Detroit News. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gannett estimates, the merger will turn current annual losses of 
$20 million at the Free Press and break-even status at the News into combined 
profits of up to $100 million within five years. 
</P>
<P>
Under the so-called joint operating agreement, which is set for 100 years, the 
Free Press will publish mornings, the News afternoons, and jointly weekends. 
The deal, which will split profits 55-45 to Gannett for five years and then 
evenly, required a special exemption to antitrust laws under the 1970 Newspaper 
Preservation Act and approval of the U.S. Attorney General's Office. 
</P>
<P>
But after three years of legal wrangling and local outrage, even the response 
on Wall Street seemed subdued. 
</P>
<P>
"The termination of the loss helps Knight's earnings, and doesn't mean much to 
Gannett, but in the future should add to both companies," said J. Kendrick 
Noble Jr. of the New York brokerage Paine Webber. 
</P>
<P>
"There is weak ad linage pretty much everywhere, but this provides some help in 
an otherwise weakening outlook," said Edward J. Atorino of Salomon Bros., who 
is less optimistic about the short-term prospects of newspaper stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Gannett shares closed at $41.875 Monday, up 87.5 cents a share. Knight-Ridder 
closed at $51.125, up 12.5 cents. Analysts said the stock prices already 
largely reflected the expectation that the merger ultimately would be approved. 
</P>
<P>
The subdued response may also be due to the bad blood stirred with the local 
community and the legal miscalculations by the newspapers since Gannett bought 
the News from its family owners in April, 1986, in a celebrated deal. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, it announced the proposed truce with Knight-Ridder. 
</P>
<P>
The city was stunned. Since the News had only a slight edge in readers (and 
roughly 60% of ad revenue), some local interests doubted that the Free Press 
was really failing, as required under the 1970 law to win approval. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts expected that eventually the Free Press would prevail because it 
was the dominant morning paper, the cycle that seemed most likely to grow. 
</P>
<P>
The Times also learned that the two sides actually had discussed the merger 
before Gannett bought the News, despite assertions by both sides to the 
contrary. 
</P>
<P>
And suspicions were raised about the weakness of the two papers, too, since 
Gannett and Knight-Ridder are the nation's first- and second-largest newspaper 
companies in circulation. 
</P>
<P>
Gannett and Knight-Ridder wanted the deal to go through without a public 
hearing, arguing that it was unnecessary and that delay would only hurt the 
Free Press. 
</P>
<P>
But over the next three years, Knight-Ridder's lawyers' expectations of what 
would happen were often wrong, and by this year the worsening condition of the 
Free Press was costing Knight-Ridder about 25 cents a share, or nearly $2 
million a month. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1986, for instance, the antitrust division of the Justice Department 
said the two companies had failed to prove that the merger was necessary and 
ordered public hearings. They began a year later, a strange civic opera on the 
economic vibrancy of Detroit, with the mayor and five labor unions contending 
that the city could still support two papers. 
</P>
<P>
The Free Press said it had lost $100 million in nine years, and Knight-Ridder 
threatened to close the Free Press if the merger were disallowed. 
</P>
<P>
But internal documents showed that the two papers had lost money, at least in 
part, because each was engaged in a deliberate strategy to destroy the other, 
forgoing profits now for a monopoly later. 
</P>
<P>
The administrative law judge in the case disapproved the merger. If the two 
papers tried, he said, they could both be profitable. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1988, outgoing Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III overturned the judge's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
But just two days before the merger was to go into effect, a U.S. District 
Court issued a restraining order freezing it. 
</P>
<P>
The merger remained in legal limbo for another year, through two separate 
District Court rulings and finally a hearing at the Supreme Court testing 
Meese's decision. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court was expected to take months to write its opinion. The 4-to-4 
vote, with Justice White recusing himself, made writing an opinion unnecessary.

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The parking lot adjoining the Grand Mosque boils into an urban stew by midday. 
Bulldozers belch clouds of dust from the pedestrian plaza under development 
next door. Cars of downtown shoppers crawl across the construction debris. And, 
defying the scorching heat five times a day, a swarm of Muslim faithful stream 
out of their offices to the mosque to pray. 
</P>
<P>
But on one Friday last month, the bulldozers and the cars were herded aside, 
and a line of police officers formed a human barricade near the center. 
Presently, six men were led in, nudged to their knees and, with a few swift 
swishes of a sword, delivered of their heads. 
</P>
<P>
The loudspeakers of the mosque that usually sing the call to prayer recited the 
men's crimes: highway robbery, murder, drug trafficking. Somewhere near the 
back of the crowd that had gathered someone shouted "Al Hamdulillah!" (Praise 
God!) The rest of the onlookers began clapping quietly. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounded a lot like the applause after a good chip shot in golf," said a 
Western diplomat, who watched this 15-minute dispensation of Islamic justice. 
</P>
<P>
There was little need for spectacle. Already this year, executions under Saudi 
Arabia's Koranic law are more than three times the number last year. The number 
of severed hands -- Islam's punishment for thievery -- is also up. 
</P>
<P>
While a number of factors may be at work in swelling the swordsman's business 
in downtown Riyadh, sociologists and government officials here say a rising 
wave of thefts and drug-related crimes points up the isolated desert kingdom's 
growing difficulties in holding the outside world at bay. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly two decades, Saudi Arabia was a Middle Eastern outpost of the 
American dream, an oil-fueled wonderland where entire cities sprang up along 
empty coastlines, where six-lane highways were laid over the old camel routes 
almost overnight and spectacular new international airports brought in millions 
of foreign workers to help build a new country. 
</P>
<P>
The vast pool of crude oil under the desert floor was earning more than $100 
billion a year for the few million Saudis who had wandered largely penniless 
across the Arabian peninsula only half a generation before. Because it could 
afford to, Saudi Arabia, the guardian of Islam's holy cities of Mecca and 
Medina, remained -- in the midst of a dizzying economic boom -- a haven for one 
of the strictest Islamic societies in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the veritable siege of Western workers, Saudi Arabia has remained a 
country without alcohol, without public entertainment and without substantial 
contact of any kind between unmarried men and women. Women emerge from their 
homes only heavily veiled in black and are not permitted to work except with 
other women. The Koran and Islam's sometimes harsh law, the sharia, remains the 
country's only constitution. 
</P>
<P>
But now, weathering a devastating slump in world oil prices that has diminished 
petroleum revenues to less than one-fifth of what they were, the fabled oil 
sheiks of the Arabian desert are learning the fine art of belt-tightening -- 
and all that accompanies it. 
</P>
<P>
Government spending has been cut by half, eliminating, for instance, the large, 
free stipends that Saudi undergraduates studying abroad once received and 
substantially slowing the flow of foreign aid to poorer neighbors throughout 
the Middle East. Western contractors who earlier cashed in on the building boom 
are now left waiting months or longer for their money. The bountiful Saudi 
budget is running a deficit for the sixth straight year -- and many Saudis have 
begun to wonder privately whether the miraculous desert kingdom can ever be the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
"We took the West as our model, and now we are trapped by it," explained Hani 
Draye, a young writer and government employee and one of several youthful 
Saudis who, in interviews over the past month, expressed fears that economic 
realities -- the need for many women to work, for example -- and a growing 
generation of Saudis who expect more than the government can deliver threaten 
to change forever a country whose religious traditions span 13 centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 65% of all Saudis are less than 25 years old, and nearly all of them, 
Saudi sociologists say, grew up in an era when the government provided not only 
free tuition but a monthly salary for all university students and well-paying 
government jobs after graduation. Now, the government has said it can no longer 
afford to be the employer of last resort, and though the unemployment rate 
remains nominally non-existent, Western analysts say it cannot stay that way 
for long. 
</P>
<P>
One diplomat said he received a report that the criminals executed last month 
had left notes with their victims declaring they were university graduates 
without jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"We were forced to do this," the notes reportedly said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a nomad, from a tent," said Mohammed Oteibi, who went from being a 
sheep-herding Bedouin to a doctorate-level sociology professor at King Saud 
University in a matter of a few years. His father still lives in a tent near 
the gleaming Saudi capital of Riyadh, but Oteibi worries that he doesn't have 
the same ready answers for his children that his father had for him. His 
19-year-old daughter wants to go abroad alone to study; Oteibi, who studied 
himself in the United States, says no, not without her brother, or a husband, 
to look out for her. But he can't explain exactly why. 
</P>
<P>
"You are Saudi," he says finally. "No matter whether you went to the U.S. or 
Japan or Mars. You are Saudi. And you should do as they do." 
</P>
<P>
Maha, his daughter, fumes. Oteibi frets. 
</P>
<P>
"There is very rapid change, and for me, it's scaring me, to tell the truth," 
he says. "We used to have values, we used to have a lot of things, and we are 
missing it. The sky rained a lot of money on this area, but the social fabric 
is fading away." 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is a place where the modern and the ageless are in a state of 
perpetual collision. 
</P>
<P>
Just a few blocks from the parking lot of the Grand Mosque is old Riyadh, or 
what can still be glimpsed of it. Ancient mud-brick houses have been left 
standing, but entire rows have been blocked by modern office towers and 
shopping centers built directly up to their front doors. 
</P>
<P>
On the outskirts of the city, men drive out to the desert's fringe at twilight, 
pitch a tent and pass the hours as Saudis for hundreds of years have passed 
their evenings: sipping tea, playing cards, talking -- but now, often, over the 
drone of a battery-operated television. 
</P>
<P>
One recent afternoon, a Saudi cab driver careened madly down a mountain 
highway, the traditional red-and-white head scarf that all Saudi men wear 
streaming out the front window. Just at sunset, he threw the car over to the 
side of the road, skidded to a stop and leaped out. 
</P>
<P>
Rushing over to a roadside faucet, he began furiously washing his hands, face 
and feet. It was prayer time, one of five times during the day when life all 
over Saudi Arabia comes to a temporary halt. Shops close. Offices empty. 
Television soap operas are interrupted with the drone of Koranic verses. After 
touching his forehead to the desert sand as the sun set over Mecca, the cab 
driver strolled back to the car, the last of his prayers still on his lips. 
</P>
<P>
Saudis are constantly faced with the challenge of living as 7th-Century Muslims 
in a country approaching the 21st Century. One man, for example, last month 
wrote to an Islamic adviser in the newspaper to find out how, in the age of 
modern jet travel, one can be sure he is actually bowing in the direction of 
Mecca in mid-flight. 
</P>
<P>
Worried another: "I laugh often and much. I am told that this is forbidden in 
Islam. Is it true?" 
</P>
<P>
(True, he was advised. "Too much laughter," the Prophet Mohammed once said, 
"causes the heart to die.") 
</P>
<P>
Only now, with the economic recession, are Saudis starting to catch their 
breath. After years of total directional confusion, for example, Riyadh, a city 
of 1.5 million people, has just gotten round to a project to name its streets 
and give all houses a number. The project has been delayed by lengthy arguments 
over precisely what names the streets should have. 
</P>
<P>
In the sprawling port city of Jidda, former Mayor Mohamed Said Farsi is 
credited with preserving a large section of the city's historic downtown while 
undertaking some of the most phenomenal construction projects ever attempted by 
a municipal government. 
</P>
<P>
As a close friend of Saudi King Fahd, Farsi had a virtual blank check 
throughout the 1970s to shape the city, and his wand was sweeping. Four 
thousand kilometers of roads, including the largest seaside corniche in the 
world, were built in 10 years. Farsi wanted an open-air museum along the beach, 
and a museum complete with the works of painter Joan Miro and sculptor Henry 
Moore appeared. 
</P>
<P>
Swept up by his own grand vision, Farsi declared that all the houses in Jidda 
should be white -- to the consternation of many longtime Jiddans, who thought 
their houses should remain as they were. People were even more irritated when 
Farsi, taken with the idea of building a new road, would sometimes take over 
their property and build the road without notifying them first. 
</P>
<P>
"If you inform people so far (in advance), they would never allow it," he 
explained in a recent interview. More important, he said, was getting the roads 
finished so that new roads could be built after them. 
</P>
<P>
"You see," he explained, "if I do this road in two months, I have time to do 
other road after two months, while you still have money. If you don't do it in 
two months, you spend only 2 million riyals in one year. If you finish in two 
months, you can spend 5 million riyals in one year." 
</P>
<P>
Farsi and his dream for Jidda embody the whole sense that permeated the Saudi 
boom years, a sense of urgency, of the need to catch up fast. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was fast, because time is very important to us," he said. "I 
remember I was at an embassy dinner one time, and a man asked me, some cities 
have electrical problems, some telephone problems, some sewage. What is your 
problem? I was thinking, and I told him, my problem is time." 
</P>
<P>
It was that being in a hurry that led Saudi Arabia to import huge numbers of 
foreign laborers, technicians and contractors to build and run the new 
factories; drivers, houseboys and waiters to hold down domestic jobs while 
young Saudis were off at the university. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, only 7 million of the 11 million people who live in Saudi Arabia are 
Saudis; the rest are foreign workers who are sending large sums of valuable 
hard currency back home and -- even more troublesome for the Saudis, government 
officials and sociologists admit -- are, for all their alien Western ways, the 
ones who keep Saudi Arabia running. 
</P>
<P>
A key aspect of the country's just-completed five-year plan is both to 
diversify the economy -- develop ancillary industries to make Saudi Arabia less 
dependent on exporting crude oil -- and to replace much of the foreign work 
force with locals, a process known as "Saudization." 
</P>
<P>
To a large degree, it is beginning to work. Saudis now hold most top management 
positions at key Saudi companies. Aramco, the American oil company that 
launched Saudi Arabia as the world's largest exporter of oil, became wholly 
Saudi-owned last year. Technical schools have begun turning out Saudi graduates 
bound for mid-level jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But the process has been painful, many businessmen and government officials 
said in interviews, because young Saudis still expect a university degree -- 
and a white-collar job to go along with it. 
</P>
<P>
Said A. M. Alsadhan, secretary general of the Civil Service Council, which 
helps oversee the country's mammoth civil service network: "The impression is 
that the young Saudi may not be willing to accept the conditions of the working 
environment in the private sector. He doesn't want to work long shifts, he 
doesn't want to work on Thursday (the first day of the Saudi weekend), he 
doesn't want to be scrutinized. 
</P>
<P>
"But these are a lot of assumptions that have never been supported by any 
pragmatic study that you can depend upon. There is only one way to find out, 
and that is for Saudization to roll in. It needs a lot of courage, and it needs 
a lot of loyalty as well, believing that this country has given a person so 
much that he has to give back royalties, so to speak." 
</P>
<P>
A young Saudi industrialist, educated in the United States, said he has second 
thoughts about hiring fellow Saudis who have never traveled abroad: "How am I 
going to communicate with this guy? He spends two hours praying, and he doesn't 
work," he said impatiently. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand," he said, remembering how much he changed during his years 
in America, "am I going to be accepted? . . . The lower middle class are trying 
their best to communicate. They speak some English, and they try to somehow be 
superficially in touch with the real world, but when it comes to real 
communication, sharing ideals and views, it's very different. But the bottom 
line is, you can either by co-opted, or you can be alienated. Because these two 
forces will never meet." 
</P>
<P>
There is an almost mystic stillness to the desert night air. It is heavy and 
hot and, here in the mountains above the Red Sea, sheltered from the salty 
breeze blowing in over the ports below. 
</P>
<P>
On nights like this, Saudi men often drive out to one of the coffeehouses 
nestled in the shelter of the rocky hills -- quiet, open dens covered with 
Oriental carpets and soft pillows where, for hours on end, they sip mint tea, 
smoke a dizzying molasses brew from a gurgling water pipe and philosophize. 
</P>
<P>
"The Third World surrounds us. We are surrounded by idiots. And I sometimes 
think we are idiots, too," a young Saudi banker said on a recent night over 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything you see, it was built by foreigners, and they go home. How are we 
going to learn if we don't dirty our hands? We don't have Saudi plumbers, we 
don't have Saudi electricians, this is the problem. You see a lot of people 
working for the government, they are not qualified for their jobs. They come to 
work at 8 and open the paper, and at 12 they close the paper and go home. 
Because there is nothing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Leaning forward, and looking around to make sure no one was listening, he 
grabbed his white head scarf and long white robe. "Look at this," he hissed. 
"We look like ghosts, and the women are in black. Why? I want to see it 
progressing, and our reputation is going down the drain. And it hurts. 
Sometimes, I'm outside, and I cannot say I'm a Saudi. 
</P>
<P>
"I go out," he explains, "because I have to. I can live here for one, two, 
three months, but I want to see a normal life, normal people. So what I do is I 
work hard two or three months, I take a vacation one week, 10 days, I go out, I 
do whatever I want, I come back. Another frustration period. I work hard, make 
money, I go out again. Sometimes I'd just like to go to a movie; sometimes I'd 
like to go to a park. I'd like to have a choice. But my choice is to get 
bored." 
</P>
<P>
Government officials admit privately they must accommodate frustrations like 
these. But they also say they must balance that against a rising tide of 
conservatism among many Saudis who have not traveled abroad -- and who are 
likely to turn increasingly to Islam as a refuge in a time of mounting economic 
uncertainties. 
</P>
<P>
"I think things are getting better," said Abdulrazag A. Algain, assistant 
deputy minister for planning. "As a machine, nobody will stop it. But we don't 
like to challenge everybody, to challenge religion. After all, they are our 
fathers and our brothers. 
</P>
<P>
"Planning isn't easy work," he said. "You have to plan, you have to dream; some 
of your dreams end up a nightmare. There are some things that happened here too 
fast. But we are not sorry. We were in a panic, you know. Everybody was in a 
panic. The government was in a panic. We wanted to build our country. We had 
the money to do it. But now the slowdown has given us a chance to think."

SALVADORAN ODYSSEY: ALICIA PURSUES HER DREAM TO L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In July, Alicia stole away from her home in El Salvador and embarked on a 
perilous journey northward across Guatemala and Mexico. All she possessed were 
her wits, $300 and dreams of a better life in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
It took months, but Alicia finally arrived in Los Angeles, having braved 
bandits, corrupt police, clandestine smugglers and immigration agents from 
three countries. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Alicia lives with Salvadoran friends in a tiny apartment in North 
Hollywood. Armed with the fake identification papers that have become 
commonplace in the world of illegal immigrants, she works more than 10 hours a 
day in a garment factory to be able, eventually, to send money to her four 
small children in La Libertad, a town in western El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"At last," Alicia said in a recent interview, "I can feel more at ease." 
</P>
<P>
The first half of Alicia's story was recounted in The Times in September when 
she reached Mexico City after a dangerous, three-week, 800-mile trek from El 
Salvador. In another month and a half, she would reach Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Alicia's odyssey is a story of struggle and survival that could easily belong 
to any of the thousands of Central Americans who leave their homes each year in 
a quest for work north of the U.S.-Mexico border. It also illustrates the 
heightened danger that solitary women -- striving to escape poverty, violence 
or both -- increasingly face in making the trip. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as now, Alicia asked that her full name not be published. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the first half of her journey, the oft-traveled leg from Mexico 
City to Los Angeles seemed almost easy. 
</P>
<P>
Deserted by her alcoholic husband, Alicia, 29, left her one-room home in La 
Libertad on July 27, resolved that she could no longer raise her children with 
the $5 a week she earned washing clothes. It hurt to leave them behind with 
relatives, she said, but there was no other way. She couldn't bring herself to 
say goodby. 
</P>
<P>
During the three weeks that followed, she would pay a "coyote" -- a smuggler of 
people -- to sneak her into Mexico from Guatemala, she would wade a river, walk 
miles along rural back roads and hide in the brush. Often hungry, cold and 
desolate, she was robbed and threatened by armed bandits and narrowly escaped 
being raped; other women companions were not so lucky. Police frequently 
demanded bribes. But an occasional stranger also lent refuge and assistance. 
</P>
<P>
When she reached Mexico City, a Salvadoran friend put her up while she wrestled 
with the decision of whether to continue. She risked being deported all the way 
back to El Salvador if caught crossing into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But Alicia was determined to forge ahead. 
</P>
<P>
First, it would be necessary to create a Mexican identity. That way, she would 
only be sent back to Tijuana if apprehended while crossing into the United 
States. With the help of friends, she obtained a false birth certificate that 
indicated she had been born in San Miguel de Allende, in the central Mexican 
state of Guanajuato. 
</P>
<P>
New Accent 
</P>
<P>
And, like many Central Americans who make the same illegal journey, she began 
to practice the sing-song accent and the slang used by Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
"If they (immigration agents) detect a Central American accent," Alicia said, 
"it's all over." 
</P>
<P>
Alicia also had to wait for money. Most of the $300 she had borrowed in El 
Salvador, and had sewn into her clothing when she left, had been spent along 
the way to Mexico City. Her cousin in Los Angeles would send her another $200 
for the final part of her trip. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, she was ready. On a morning late in September, she dressed in a beige 
corduroy skirt and jacket, a piece of clothing discarded by her friend's 
employer but still in good condition, and boarded a bus to Tijuana, 1,800 miles 
away. In her hands she grasped the fake birth certificate. 
</P>
<P>
After pulling out of Mexico City, the bus passed through the city of 
Guadalajara and headed north toward Hermosillo along the Gulf of California, 
skirting rocky beaches, endless desert and bountiful farmland. But Alicia paid 
little heed to the scenery, constantly fearful of being stopped by authorities. 
She slumped in her seat during much of the 48-hour ride. 
</P>
<P>
Twice, police stopped the bus, ordering all passengers out while they searched 
the luggage. And twice, Mexican immigration agents stopped the bus at roadside 
checkpoints, demanding that all passengers present their papers. Several 
passengers who did not have proper papers were taken from the bus and 
questioned. 
</P>
<P>
But well-dressed, well-groomed Alicia did not arouse suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
"They looked at me," she said, "but they did not mistake me for an immigrant." 
</P>
<P>
Although Alicia offered her birth certificate to one agent for inspection, he 
merely glanced at it and moved on. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving in Tijuana, Alicia took a taxi to a low-end motel that her cousin, who 
has lived illegally in Los Angeles for nearly a year, had told her about. She 
then went to a public pay telephone to call the cousin, but she had trouble 
dialing the number, not knowing to use the required prefix. 
</P>
<P>
As she fiddled with the phone, she noticed a tall, mysterious man watching her. 
Fearing he might be a "spy" for immigration authorities, she fled. But the man 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
For the next several hours, she tried to elude him, ducking into a cafe and a 
run-down movie house before finally losing him as dusk fell. She never learned 
who he was or what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
The experience left Alicia unsettled and eager to move on. Luckily, however, it 
would turn out to be the only truly tense moment she endured while in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Alicia was able to make the call to her cousin, who promised to 
arrange for a coyote in San Diego who had been recommended by another friend. 
He would cost $400. Less than 24 hours later, the coyote sought Alicia at the 
motel, identifying himself and using the cousin's name as a sort of password. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's go," she answered him. 
</P>
<P>
The pair took a taxi to an apartment complex near the border, and the coyote 
left Alicia with a woman in one of the apartments to wait until nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
At 10 p.m., Alicia and the coyote made their first foray into the United 
States. But they would be caught by U.S. Border Patrol agents after being seen 
by authorities from a helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
"We passed through a fence and ran and ran," Alicia remembered. "But they 
nabbed us. 
</P>
<P>
"Overhead, they saw us from the helicopter. We threw ourselves on the ground, 
but it was flying very low, and shined a light on us." 
</P>
<P>
When the chopper landed, Alicia said, three agents got out and placed handcuffs 
on the coyote. The two were put in a truck and returned to a holding cell where 
they were required to give their names and nationalities. Alicia, summoning her 
fake birth certificate, claimed successfully to be Mexican. 
</P>
<P>
What amazed Alicia more than anything was the sheer volume of people doing 
exactly what she was doing -- attempting to cross the border. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many people, passing through and passing through," she said. 
"Like in parades." 
</P>
<P>
In the 12 months ending in September, 366,000 arrests were made of people 
crossing the border illegally in the San Diego region, according to the U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service. An estimated 45% of all illegal entries 
into the United States are made along an eight-mile stretch of the border near 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Another Try 
</P>
<P>
Once the holding cell was packed with people, Alicia said, they were taken back 
to the Mexican side of the border in a bus and deposited there. Far from 
discouraging, it was an almost festive moment. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the women called to the immigration agents, 'See you in a little 
while,' " she said. "One woman blew the agent a kiss and he laughed." 
</P>
<P>
Alicia and her coyote returned to the fence at the border to wait until Border 
Patrol agents on motorcycles and on horseback seemed to leave. At about 4 a.m., 
they tried again, joining another rush of humanity streaming through the fence 
and over the sandy hills toward San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Alicia remembers running for 15 minutes solid, then walking another 45 minutes 
or so until they reached a safehouse outside San Diego. It was nearly 6 a.m. 
She was given some food and use of a bathroom, then allowed to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
She would have to wait two days at the house, until word arrived that it was 
safe to continue. At that point, Alicia and six others boarded a carpeted van 
that traveled from San Diego, through Orange County and into Los Angeles, 
delivering people "like packages," she said. The driver showed his illegal 
passengers how to open the doors from inside in case the van was stopped by 
police and they would have to flee. 
</P>
<P>
Alicia's was the last stop. North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Alicia rested the weekend she arrived at her cousin's North Hollywood 
apartment, part of an inexpensive complex full of children located off a busy 
San Fernando Valley thoroughfare, and then set off to find a job. Quickly, she 
was able to plug into the network of Salvadorans who share work, housing, 
church and information. 
</P>
<P>
Using those contacts, Alicia visited several seamstress shops over the next 
five days before being hired to trim threads and iron clothing. She works 
alongside five to a dozen women. 
</P>
<P>
Wages are low, Alicia says. She is paid 6 cents a piece, not even enough to 
muster $100 a week. But she is learning to operate the sewing machines and 
hopes for higher-paying work. 
</P>
<P>
"At least it pays for food," she said, adding she has still not been able to 
earn enough to send back to her children. 
</P>
<P>
The easiest part was obtaining phony work papers, Alicia said. Under the 1986 
Immigration Reform and Control Act, employers are required to demand from 
workers documents showing they are in the country legally. But, ever since the 
law went into effect, there has been a boom in counterfeit document production, 
according to both INS officials and illegal immigrants themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Like thousands of other illegal immigrants, Alicia's relatives knew exactly 
where to obtain the papers. Their source would be a woman in a small office in 
North Hollywood who simply needed a small picture of Alicia. Almost immediately 
she produced a fake "green card" and a fake Social Security card. Price: $45. 
</P>
<P>
"Since it's crooked, it's quick," Alicia said. 
</P>
<P>
Alicia and her cousins said employers readily accept these fake papers, often 
with a wink and a smile indicating they know they are not authentic. Under the 
law, employers can be fined for knowingly hiring illegal immigrants but are not 
required to verify the validity of immigration papers. 
</P>
<P>
Difficulties have not ended for Alicia. About a week after she arrived, her 
cousin's husband went on a drunken rampage, she says, beating both women. They 
have fled and are living with friends in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"After all my efforts to get here, this is not what I expected" to have to deal 
with, she said. 
</P>
<P>
She also is in debt: the $300 she borrowed in El Salvador, the $400 her cousin 
paid the coyote plus the other $200 the cousin sent her in Mexico City. Alicia 
reached North Hollywood with about $25 and 100,000 Mexican pesos, worth about 
$40. 
</P>
<P>
When she first arrived, Alicia felt a sense of relief and anticipation, 
tempered by a nagging sadness. To welcome Alicia, her cousin had put out 
snapshots of Alicia's children. Something familiar, the cousin thought, would 
make Alicia feel at home. But instead, Alicia burst into tears at seeing the 
photographs. 
</P>
<P>
"That is the moral pain I carry," she said emotionally. "It hurts me, but I 
must wage this fight." 
</P>
<P>
Alicia said she asks her mother and brother, who are caring for the children in 
La Libertad, to mention her name to them occasionally so they will not forget 
their mother. She wants to work in Los Angeles long enough to earn money for 
her family, perhaps enough money to buy a small house in El Salvador. That 
could take years. But she is emphatic about one day returning home to her 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"They are my children," she said. "I have to be at their side." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Like thousands of Central Americans, Alicia left her home earlier this year and 
embarked on an illegal and dangerous journey to find work in the United States. 
Her story was first told in The Times in September, when she had made her way 
from El Salvador to Mexico City. Since then, she has fulfilled her goal of 
reaching Los Angeles and is trying to eke out a living by sewing clothes. 
Increasingly, lone women like Alicia are making the trip, leaving their 
children behind and braving particular peril.

NEW-FOUND SITE IN JUNGLE MAY BE FIRST MAYAN CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A UCLA archeologist has identified what is apparently the earliest major center 
of Mayan civilization yet found, a discovery that extends the era of Mayan 
cities back four centuries into a period that was thought to be dominated by 
simple village life. 
</P>
<P>
The extensive stone monuments and temples in the newly discovered city of 
Nakbe, in the dense tropical forest of northern Guatemala, show "that the 
advances which created the most sophisticated pre-Columbian society in the New 
World may have occurred much earlier than was previously assumed," said UCLA's 
Richard Hansen. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery will shed new light on why the Maya "accomplished things no other 
tropical forest society accomplished in the New World," Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
The excavations at Nakbe, announced Monday by UCLA, are "of extraordinary 
importance to our understanding of the origin of Mayan civilization," said 
anthropologist David Friedel of Southern Methodist University. 
</P>
<P>
The new findings follow on the heels of surprising reports this summer by 
anthropologist Arthur Demarest of Vanderbilt University that the Mayan society 
-- previously believed to be one of history's most peaceful civilizations -- 
collapsed in the 9th Century AD as the result of internecine warfare. 
</P>
<P>
These new discoveries from the beginning and end of Mayan civilization, Friedel 
added, are "revealing with breathtaking clarity not only their (the Maya's) 
vision of the world, but the breadth and complexity of their political 
organization." 
</P>
<P>
The new find dates from a period when the Maya were transforming themselves 
from a centuries-old rural agrarian society to a more sophisticated and complex 
urban society. Researchers are particularly interested in the factors that led 
to this transformation because it sheds light on the more general question of 
how societies are formed. 
</P>
<P>
Although they are not yet sure, the researchers believe that urbanization arose 
as a mechanism to counter the innate hostility of the environment, to promote 
trade, and to consolidate religious and political ideologies. 
</P>
<P>
Nakbe lies in the isolated central department (state) of Peten in Guatemala, 
about 350 miles from Guatemala City. The site was first identified as a 
potential location of advanced Mayan civilization in 1930 by archeologists 
performing an aerial survey of the region. But no significant work occurred at 
the site until the UCLA team carried out its excavations from February through 
April of this year. 
</P>
<P>
That delay arose primarily as a result of the site's isolation. Nakbe "is three 
days on foot from the nearest road," Hansen said. "We used 123 mules to 
transport our stuff in, then kept 14 mules hauling water and supplies for the 
three months we were there. They had to cross swamps and wade through muck up 
to their bellies. It's hard to appreciate the problem if you haven't been 
through it." 
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the isolation probably protected the site from looting. 
</P>
<P>
Their excavations revealed thousands of artifacts, tombs and temple structures, 
some ranging from 40 to 65 feet in height. Other buildings on the site, which 
have not yet been excavated, are estimated to be as tall as 150 feet, which 
would rival pyramids from the more modern Mayan city of Tikal. 
</P>
<P>
The excavated buildings date from 600 to 400 BC, in the so-called middle 
Pre-Classic period. Previously, the most advanced structures from this period 
to be discovered were crude villages with low stone platforms measuring from 
three to six feet tall. Hansen has not yet dated the taller pyramids. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers also dug up more than 65,000 potsherds, ceramics, human and 
animal figurines, seashells and obsidian and stone tools, which should reveal 
many details about everyday life in this first Mayan city. 
</P>
<P>
They also found an artifact that may prove to be one of the most significant 
Mayan sculptures ever discovered, a 10-foot-high fragmented slab of intricately 
carved limestone erected by Pre-Classic Mayan rulers. It depicts two 
individuals in royal clothing facing each other. One has his hand extended, 
pointing to a deity between them. Hansen believes the stone slab commemorates 
an important historical event whose nature he plans to discuss in a forthcoming 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen and his colleagues also found the remnants of an even earlier village 
below Nakbe, filled with soil and rubble. 
</P>
<P>
"The construction appears to have preserved the village below," Hansen said in 
a telephone interview from his home in Rupert, Ida. "It's almost like finding a 
Mayan version of Pompeii," the Neapolitan city preserved intact when it was 
buried by an eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. 
</P>
<P>
The construction of Nakbe must have been an enormous task, Hansen said. "All of 
the building materials had to be hauled to the location, rock by rock and 
basket by basket, by hundreds of Mayan workers to construct the massive 
platforms and buildings." 
</P>
<P>
Even drinking water was a problem. During their excavations, the UCLA team 
members had to haul water nearly four miles to the site on mules. "The Maya 
didn't have mules or beasts of burden to do that with," Hansen said. That lack 
led them to develop systems to collect rainwater from the roofs of temples and 
other buildings and channel it into storage facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem that must have impeded construction, Hansen said, is that the 
city was surrounded by swamps. "In order to maintain local trade and exchange, 
they had to construct causeways . . . large, rubble-filled constructions up to 
two yards high and 20 yards wide," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That construction would have allowed them access to neighboring farmlands and 
would have consolidated political authority. 
</P>
<P>
The Maya were unique, Hansen said, because "they were able to achieve the 
greatest level of sophistication in the face of a very hostile environment." 
What researchers are trying to determine, he added, "is why they became 
sophisticated all of a sudden." 
</P>
<P>
The very hostility of the environment may have been a major civilizing 
influence, Hansen speculated. "It was so difficult to live there that it 
required centralized authority to maintain logistics and the life style they 
desired." 
</P>
<P>
Another clue to the civilizing influences was the large amount of seashells and 
obsidian discovered at Nakbe, all of which had to be imported from elsewhere. 
Hansen and others speculate that centralized authority was established in part 
to carry out such imports in exchange for a variety of goods, including food, 
chocolate, cotton textiles, forest products, medicines and jaguar pelts. 
</P>
<P>
"Seashells are very important to Maya public ceremonial life," said SMU's 
Friedel. "Great conch shells were used to fashion trumpets that were blown to 
declare the presence of the gods. Small shells were used as little bells and 
tinklers sewn onto the clothes of the elite for public ceremonies." Eventually 
the shells were also used as a form of money. 
</P>
<P>
Obsidian, he added, "was highly prized for ritual bloodletting and was a sacred 
material for all the people of meso-America." 
</P>
<P>
"Another factor, which we are hot on the trail of, is the role of religious 
ideology as an impetus in developing huge cities," Hansen said. The early 
leaders "had a huge control of labor to build these enormous buildings, and it 
appears from our excavations that the sole purpose was ideological. It's not 
funerary; we don't find burials like in later periods." 
</P>
<P>
The buildings did not necessarily serve as churches either, he said. "I'm more 
inclined to think that these buildings were constructed with the idea of 
consolidating the authority of an emerging elite and tying that into religious 
theology. That fits very well with what we know of later Maya mythology, where 
the king became divine and had divine ancestry." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen speculates that it was sometime during the era of Nakbe's construction 
that the authority of kings stopped being earned by achievement and started 
being passed down from fathers to sons. 
</P>
<P>
But solving these riddles, he said, "will take years and years of 
investigation."

ABUSE, BIAS BY INSURERS ALLEGED IN CANCER CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Consumers Union and a coalition of health groups filed a petition with the 
state Monday charging that insurance companies have engaged in an 
"unconscionable pattern of abuse and discrimination" against families who have 
children with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The petition, filed with Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie, contends that 
insurance companies have added to the trauma of cancer for many families by 
delaying payments, denying benefits for procedures that should be covered, 
raising premium rates and imposing limits on benefits without proper notice. 
</P>
<P>
The petition did not single out any individual insurance companies but called 
on the commissioner to investigate these alleged practices and revoke the 
licenses of companies found to act improperly. 
</P>
<P>
"Health insurers operate with almost total disregard for both the law and for 
simple decency," said Rose Hughes, a leader of the recently formed Parents of 
Kids with Cancer. "The insurance commissioner has to protect the public from 
such abhorrent abuse." 
</P>
<P>
When her son had cancer, Hughes said, her family lost their house, car and 
other belongings -- in part because their insurance company delayed some 
payments for months and refused to pay for some treatments that should have 
been covered. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, insurance companies are required to pay all claims within 30 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Barnhart, a lobbyist for the Assn. of California Life Insurance 
Companies, said that most health insurance companies meet the deadline. He 
acknowledged, however, that disputes arise over claims that cancer victims 
believe should be covered but are considered by the companies to be 
experimental and therefore not eligible for payment. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie's office issued a statement saying she is "very concerned about the 
availability and affordability of health coverage -- and the efficient delivery 
of such services -- in California." 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie, who is considering running for the office of state insurance 
commissioner in 1990 when it becomes an elective post for the first time, 
expressed a willingness to cooperate with the coalition that filed the 
petition. 
</P>
<P>
But her office noted that the commissioner oversees only a portion of the 
health insurance industry because some companies are regulated by other 
agencies and some insurers are exempt from state regulation. 
</P>
<P>
The petition cites nine alleged cases of abuse and discrimination against 
cancer patients by insurance companies. In some cases, the document claims, 
delayed payments and denied benefits created extreme financial hardship for the 
families and jeopardized treatment for the patients. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the coalition conceded the petition was intended, in part, 
to help shape next year's race for insurance commissioner and make health 
insurance an important part of the public debate.

LIE TESTS FOR POLICE APPLICANTS AFFIRMED; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: APPELLATE PANEL SAYS POLYGRAPH EXAMS DO NOT VIOLATE CONSTITUTIONAL 
RIGHTS TO PRIVACY. THE RULING WILL BE BINDING ON TRIAL COURTS THROUGHOUT THE 
STATE.

<P>
A state Court of Appeal ruled Monday that cities and counties may require 
applicants for jobs as police officers to submit to polygraph tests about their 
character and background. 
</P>
<P>
In a 2-1 decision, the panel rejected claims that such testing violated the 
state constitutional right to privacy or conflicted with statutes that bar such 
tests for public safety officers already on the job. 
</P>
<P>
"(Municipalities) have a compelling governmental interest in conducting a 
comprehensive background investigation and in utilizing the polygraph 
examination to protect the public from applicants who may be attempting to 
conceal undetected criminal activity, racial prejudice, sexual aberrance or 
violent tendencies," Appellate Justice James F. Perley wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
The panel noted that the right to privacy was "not absolute" -- and said that a 
city's interest in ensuring its officers were of the highest integrity 
outweighed any harm suffered by an applicant who loses a job opportunity for 
refusing the test. 
</P>
<P>
The court acknowledged that some critics have questioned the reliability of the 
polygraph, or so-called "lie detector." But proponents and opponents of the 
device agree that a polygraph test can distinguish between truth and deception 
"with an accuracy greater than chance," the panel said. 
</P>
<P>
"Given a police officer's unique status in society, compulsory polygraph 
testing of applicants for police officer positions is justified," Perley said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision sought to resolve an important question left open by a ruling by 
the state Supreme Court in 1986 that held unconstitutional any involuntary 
polygraph tests for public employees. State statutes already had barred such 
testing of private employees and police officers. The court's holding, however, 
did not settle the issue for applicants for public safety jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's ruling, unless overturned by the state high court, will be binding on 
trial courts throughout California. According to attorneys in the case, at 
least half of the cities and counties in the state currently require applicants 
for public safety jobs to take polygraph tests. 
</P>
<P>
Michael H. Roush, an attorney representing the city of Vallejo in its defense 
of the practice in the case before the court, welcomed the ruling. "Cities have 
an interest in making sure they hire the right candidates for jobs that have 
important powers in this society," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard L. Pinckard, a deputy city attorney representing San Diego and three 
other cities backing Vallejo in the case, said the ruling was especially 
important in view of state laws barring polygraph exams for officers already on 
the job. "The only place to catch (wrongdoers) is at the pre-employment stage," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco attorney Duane W. Reno, who represented a former officer who 
challenged the tests, said an appeal to the state Supreme Court would be 
considered. Reno said there are "less intrusive means" to screen applicants. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling came in the case of Clarence E. Rust, a former police officer in the 
city of Vallejo who was granted disability retirement for chronic back problems 
but later sought reinstatement to the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Rust refused the city's requirement that he take a polygraph test and filed a 
lawsuit, charging violation of his constitutional and civil rights. In support 
of his suit, he cited the statutes that prohibit officers from being forced to 
submit to such tests against their will, along with language in the 1986 state 
high court decision suggesting cities would bear a heavy legal burden in 
justifying the tests for applicants for public safety jobs. 
</P>
<P>
A Solano County Superior Court rejected Rust's claims and the Court of Appeal, 
in its ruling Monday, affirmed that ruling, concluding that both applicants -- 
and ex-officers seeking reinstatement -- could be required to take the tests as 
a condition for getting the job. 
</P>
<P>
The panel noted that pre-employment polygraph screening is widely used by 
intelligence and law enforcement agencies throughout the United States. 
Although 23 states, including California, have in some way restricted tests, 14 
have specifically permitted law enforcement agencies to conduct them for 
applicants, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
Perley's 23-page opinion was joined by Appellate Justice Carl West Anderson. In 
dissent, Appellate Justice Marc Poche said that ex-officers like Rust should be 
treated like officers holding jobs and be protected against involuntary testing 
when they seek reinstatement.

BOEING WILL PAY FINE IN SECRETS CASE; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: FIRM PLEADS GUILTY AND IS PENALIZED $5.2 MILLION. JUDGE QUESTIONS 
WHETHER FINE IS STIFF ENOUGH IN LIGHT OF A 'SERIOUS BREACH OF SECURITY.'

<P>
The Boeing Co. pleaded guilty Monday to two felony charges of trafficking in 
secret Pentagon planning documents and was ordered to pay more than $5.2 
million in fines and costs. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge T. S. Ellis III, in Alexandria, Va., questioned whether the 
fine negotiated by the Seattle-based company and prosecutors was adequate in 
light of what he called "a very serious breach of security." He also berated 
the firm for failing to send a senior executive to offer the plea. 
</P>
<P>
Defending the size of the penalty, Randy I. Bellows, an assistant U.S. 
attorney, told the judge that Boeing had cooperated fully in the investigation 
and assured him there "was no evidence" that information in the documents had 
been revealed to any "foreign power." 
</P>
<P>
Bellows also said that the government could not establish that Boeing had used 
the bootlegged documents for unfair advantage in winning any specific 
government contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force is reviewing the case to determine whether Boeing should be 
suspended or barred from future government contracts. Capt. Jack Giese, an Air 
Force spokesman, said it is "too early to speculate" on the outcome of the 
review. Ellis, clearly annoyed that no one from the firm appeared in court, 
ordered Boeing Chairman Frank Shrontz to send a letter expressing "contrition" 
for the firm's admitted illegal acts. A company spokesman said Shrontz would 
comply. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing was represented in court by a Washington-based outside attorney, Robert 
S. Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
The case, though similar in nature, is not related to the continuing "Ill Wind" 
investigation into corruption in Pentagon procurement. The Ill Wind probe has 
uncovered numerous cases of consultants employed by major defense contractors 
bribing Pentagon officials to obtain secret data to give them an advantage in 
winning military contracts. 
</P>
<P>
The Boeing plea followed the August indictment of former Boeing executive 
Richard L. Fowler on fraud and conspiracy charges for obtaining hundreds of 
classified and sensitive Pentagon budget and planning papers for the aircraft 
company between 1979 and 1985. Fowler's trial is set to begin early next month. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing plead guilty to possession of two documents, a closely held five-year 
Defense Department budget plan and a high-level Navy "decision memorandum" 
issued by the defense secretary's office in August, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not some minor document," the judge said. "This is a fairly sensitive 
and clearly classified secret set of documents." 
</P>
<P>
Boeing spokesman Paul Binder in Seattle said: "Obviously, we take this very 
seriously. It goes beyond the $5 million (in fines). It's a black mark on the 
company and something we do not want to tolerate. We have taken every step 
possible to assure that similar incidents do not occur." 
</P>
<P>
He said that none of the people involved in the case were still employed by the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing's government sales in 1988 were $4.79 billion of total sales of $16.97 
billion. In the first nine months of this year, Boeing sold a total of $4.2 
billion in aircraft, parts and services to the government. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing, the nation's 10th-largest defense contractor, is based in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler is quoted in court documents in his case as telling company and 
government investigators that black market trading in illicit Pentagon 
documents was widespread in the defense industry in the late 1970s and early 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler, who has denied any illegal acts, is a former Air Force budget analyst 
who maintained ties to several of his former colleagues, who he said provided 
him with a regular flow of inside information. 
</P>
<P>
Dealing in bootlegged Pentagon documents first came to light in 1985, when GTE 
Corp. and several of its executives and consultants were charged with 
conspiracy to obtain secret electronic-warfare data. GTE pleaded guilty, but 
charges against all but one of the individuals were dropped.

AUCTION OF BILLY WILDER'S ART FETCHES $32.6 MILLION 
</P>

<P>
A $32.6-million auction of film maker Billy Wilder's collection Monday night at 
Christie's kicked off a heady week of Impressionist and modern art sales. 
</P>
<P>
Enormous prices are on the agenda this week and Christie's and Sotheby's are 
predicting record sales, but the Wilder affair got off to a shaky start. 
Several pieces brought less than their low estimates and a few others failed to 
sell. The auction soon gathered steam, however, and eventually exceeded 
Christie's most optimistic estimate by more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The 83-year-old collector kept his wit during the fray. "It was less 
nerve-wracking than a film preview," Wilder said, and proclaimed himself 
pleased with the results amid a crowd of friends and fans. 
</P>
<P>
"Head of a Woman," a 1921 classical pastel portrait by Pablo Picasso, brought 
the auction's top price of $4.8 million but less than Christie's low estimate 
of $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Two works by Joan Miro more than made up for the Picasso. A sprightly 1936 
gouache, "The Farmer and His Wife," valued at $1.5 million to $2 million, 
brought $2.7 million from an unidentified American dealer. "The Star," a 1927 
oil inspired by a dream, commanded $2.6 million -- significantly more than 
Christie's high estimate of $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Seven works sold for more than $1 million each, including Picasso's "Two Nude 
Women and Head of a Woman" ($1.98 million) and Alberto Giacometti's painted 
bronze sculpture "Standing Woman II" ($1.1 million). 
</P>
<P>
Records were set for 12 artists. Balthus' painting of a teen-age nude, "La 
Toilette," sold to a European dealer for a record $2 million. Ernst Ludwig 
Kirchner's painting "Two Nudes on a Blue Sofa" brought $1.5 million, a high for 
the German Expressionist. 
</P>
<P>
The auction also set records for Joseph Cornell ($495,000), Nicolas de Stael 
($638,000) and Mario Marini ($671,000). 
</P>
<P>
Wilder, who was born in Austria and worked in Berlin as a young man, moved to 
Hollywood in 1934. He acquired most of his modern art in the late '40s, '50s 
and early '60s. Those were his prime film-making years, when he directed the 
Academy Award winners "The Lost Weekend," "Sunset Boulevard" and "The 
Apartment," as well as "The Seven Year Itch" and "Some Like It Hot." 
</P>
<P>
Although Wilder lacked the means to buy major paintings by renowned artists, he 
snapped up high-quality works on paper and small sculptures and developed a 
sharp eye for new talent. 
</P>
<P>
The works sold at Christie's range from figurative to abstract and cover nearly 
100 years, but they reflect a fondness for Expressionist nudes, literary twists 
and spicy wit. 
</P>
<P>
Wilder's modern art covered the walls of his former home in Beverly Hills and 
his present apartment on Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles contingent including his wife, Audrey, actresses Claudette 
Colbert and Angie Dickinson and writer Dominick Dunne watched the auction from 
Christie's boardroom, but Wilder joined the crowd in the sale room. 
</P>
<P>
He has not revealed what he plans to do with his millions. 
</P>
<P>
Impressionist and modern art auctions will continue tonight with a big-ticket 
sale at Christie's, including 14 works from the Paul Mellon collection valued 
at $85.5 million to $90 million. Drawings and watercolors will go on the block 
Wednesday morning at Christie's, followed by relatively low-priced paintings 
and sculptures in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The auction crowd will move to Sotheby's on Wednesday night for the season's 
most highly publicized event -- the sale of Picasso's "Au Lapin Agile." 
Sotheby's officials have predicted that this 1905 cafe scene depicting the 
artist as a harlequin may break Picasso's record of $47.9 million and possibly 
bring more than the $53.9 million paid for Vincent van Gogh's "Irises," the 
world's most expensive artwork.

HOSS NAMED LEBANON'S PRIME MINISTER

Lebanon's new president Monday designated veteran Muslim politician Salim Hoss 
as prime minister in a move challenging Christian strongman Michel Aoun, who 
has refused to relinquish power, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Hoss and Maj. Gen. Aoun have led rival Muslim and Christian governments since 
the six-year term of President Amin Gemayel ended in September, 1988, with 
Parliament unable to agree on a successor. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun issued a statement Monday saying the Hoss nomination is "as 
unconstitutional as the election" Nov. 5 of President Rene Mouawad. 
</P>
<P>
The session at which Parliament elected Mouawad and endorsed a peace plan was 
held in Syrian-controlled northern Lebanon because Aoun had threatened to shell 
the Parliament building in Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Mouawad, a Christian, instructed Hoss to form a national reconciliation 
government with the mission of ending the 14-year-old sectarian civil war, in 
which more than 150,000 people have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
Police reported exchanges of artillery and small-arms fire across Beirut's 
sectarian dividing line between Aoun's Christian army units and Muslim militias 
backed by Syria. Each side accused the other of starting the shooting. No 
casualty reports were available. 
</P>
<P>
A six-month artillery war between Aoun's forces and a Muslim alliance led by 
the Syrians killed at least 930 people and wounded 2,744 before the Arab League 
arranged a truce in September. 
</P>
<P>
Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate 
dating from 1976, the year after the war began. Aoun calls the Syrians an 
occupation force and has declared a "war of liberation" to drive them out. 
</P>
<P>
Later Monday, Aoun said: "This will be an unconstitutional government. It will 
not be a national reconciliation government; it will represent one side. Even 
if the whole world recognizes it, Hoss' government will be a government 
operating in the shadow of Syrian occupation. Governments cannot survive only 
on foreign recognition." 
</P>
<P>
Mouawad, 64, designated Hoss, 59, a Sunni Muslim, after three days of 
consultations with political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Hoss said the 55th government since independence from France in 1943 would 
implement the peace accord worked out in Taif, Saudi Arabia, which includes a 
plan for sharing power between Christians and Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
Mouawad, Hoss and Hussein Husseini, the Shiite Muslim who is Speaker of 
Parliament, received about 50 foreign ambassadors at the president's temporary 
headquarters -- the prime minister's office in Muslim West Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
"I call upon all of you to join our march toward peace," Mouawad said in a 
seven-minute address. "We consider the Taif accord an introduction to peace and 
a launching pad for a new republic based on equality among all Lebanese."

Salim Hoss, a Sunni Muslim who has been a voice of moderation through 14 years 
of civil war in Lebanon, returns to the prime minister's office for the fourth 
time in 13 years to try to end the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
The 59-year-old economist is a firm backer of democracy, a free-wheeling 
economy and Christian-Muslim coexistence. He is married to a Christian. 
</P>
<P>
Hoss' main asset is the wide respect he commands among both Christians and 
Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
His previous tenure in office began June 2, 1987, a day after Prime Minister 
Rashid Karami was assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
Trained as an economist at the American University of Beirut, Hoss obtained a 
doctorate in economics and business administration from Indiana University in 
1959. 
</P>
<P>
The tall, balding, bespectacled Hoss does not smoke or drink and normally goes 
to bed early. He prefers Oriental food and likes to spend evenings listening to 
classical music.

ISRAELI SOLDIER SLAIN, 2ND INJURED IN GAZA AMBUSH

Palestinian gunmen ambushed Israeli soldiers riding in a jeep, killing one and 
wounding another, in the first attack of its kind during the Arab uprising, 
Israeli army officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The attack took place in the Gaza Strip, which has been racked by violence as 
the Israeli army seeks to crush the nearly two-year-old Palestinian uprising. 
</P>
<P>
The entire Gaza Strip, home to about 700,000 Arabs, was closed off to 
outsiders, and parts of it were put under curfew while the army looked for 
suspects in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"Automatic gunfire was directed at (an Israel Defense Forces) vehicle traveling 
in the Sheikh Ajalin neighborhood in Gaza (City) in the evening," an army 
spokesman said. "As a result of the gunfire, an IDF soldier was killed and 
another was wounded." 
</P>
<P>
The dead soldier was identified as Cpl. Saul Trechtenbroit. He was the fifth 
Israeli soldier killed while on active duty in the occupied lands during the 
uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Two other uniformed soldiers were shot to death after being kidnaped while 
hitchhiking inside Israel proper. An eighth off-duty soldier was stabbed to 
death in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Military sources said the ambush was carried out by Muslim fundamentalists of 
the Islamic Resistance Movement, known as Hamas. Several Hamas members were 
arrested last week as suspects in the earlier kidnapings and slayings of the 
two Israeli soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
The use of firearms to carry out attacks on Israeli soldiers has been rare 
during the uprising, with the weapons of choice commonly being knives or 
stones. But due to mounting Palestinian casualties, the underground leadership 
of the intifada, as the uprising is called by Arabs, had been warning of 
escalation. 
</P>
<P>
More than 600 Palestinians have died at the hands of Israeli soldiers, while 36 
Israelis have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors of efforts to kill more soldiers have been sweeping the West Bank and 
Gaza for weeks. In the West Bank village of Al Birah, residents reported a 
recent gasoline bomb attack on an army convoy that wounded a high-ranking 
officer. The report could not be confirmed, but the town has been under curfew 
for the past four days, with all entrances to it sealed off by large roadblocks 
made of sandbags and stone. 
</P>
<P>
The army clamped curfews on large parts of the West Bank today in anticipation 
of Wednesday's anniversary of the Palestinian declaration of independence. 
Schools were ordered shut in Gaza until Saturday; in the West Bank they were 
ordered closed for two months. 
</P>
<P>
In many towns and villages, outlawed Palestinian flags are flying from mosques 
and electricity lines.

Two months after the East Germans first discovered a hole in the Iron Curtain

this North Sea port declared his city so filled with refugees, it could take no

</P>
<P>
That was last week.

When East Germany threw open its borders last Friday, Bremen's mayor, Henning

What was once the butt of black jokes in the early days of the city's refugee 
problem was suddenly on the edge of reality. 
</P>
<P>
"The catastrophe is here," explained Hans-Christoph Hoppensack, the city's 
housing director, as officials in Bremen and other large West German cities 
braced themselves for the worst. 
</P>
<P>
Initially at least, the avalanche of East German refugees predicted by some has 
not yet occurred. Of the estimated 2 million East Germans who flooded across 
the inter-German frontier and the Berlin Wall last weekend, only 23,000 
requested permanent resettlement in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
West German Interior Ministry officials also noted that the number of refugees 
had dropped from 13,000 per day on Friday to just under 3,500 by Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But for both federal and local authorities responsible for refugee welfare in 
West Germany, these are nerve-racking times. 
</P>
<P>
A national housing shortage, already serious, has suddenly become critical. 
Public authorities are spending resources they say they don't have, and 
competition for jobs has become acute in many parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
In a nation that has always worried excessively about the fragility of both its 
prosperity and its democracy, the influx of refugees has also raised concern 
about new social strains. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, and 
the softening political climate in Eastern Europe already have unleashed a 
flood of ethnic Germans trapped in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe since 
the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Before last week's dramatic opening of the inter-German borders, the (West) 
German Assn. of Towns and Cities in Cologne had predicted an influx of 3 
million refugees into West Germany over the next six years. 
</P>
<P>
"This projection has been totally overtaken by events in East Germany," said 
the association's spokesman, Ewald Mueller. 
</P>
<P>
Before East Germany's repressive regime suddenly relaxed stringent travel 
restrictions and promised free elections, more than 1.4 million East Germans 
had formally applied to abandon their homeland for good. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 East Germans have arrived in West Germany since September. 
</P>
<P>
How many may now reconsider their decision to leave East Germany -- or how many 
of those already in West Germany might think of returning home to a more 
relaxed political climate -- is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
"There are one and a half million East Germans over there now trying to decide 
what they should do -- make something of the new chance or leave," Scherf said. 
"It's completely impossible to know which way it will go." 
</P>
<P>
But what Scherf and the mayors of other large West German cities do know is 
they are fast running out of resources to care for the newcomers and places to 
put them. 
</P>
<P>
In Hamburg, the city has already chartered two ships to house 1,300 refugees 
and is preparing to convert school gymnasiums into dormitories. 
</P>
<P>
"We can only anticipate the influx is going to continue as it has," said 
Hinnerk Fock, spokesman for the Hamburg government. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency shelters have been activated in Frankfurt and Bonn, while in Bremen, 
new arrivals are being housed in West German army barracks as the underground 
shelter is hastily prepared and housing officials talk of requisitioning empty 
dwellings in the city. 
</P>
<P>
In a profile typical of many of the country's cities, Bremen boasted a surplus 
of housing until late 1987. 
</P>
<P>
However, with the steady arrival early last year of ethnic Germans from Poland, 
Romania and the Soviet Union, this surplus was quickly exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
The city then built a series of temporary dormitories and three weeks ago won 
permission to house newly arriving East German refugees on nearby military 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
The British, French and U.S. governments also have offered to house refugees at 
their military bases in West Germany, but Scherf said that no U.S. or British 
base commander in the Bremen region had yet agreed to such a move. 
</P>
<P>
As in other German cities, Bremen has launched an emergency building program -- 
but that will have little impact on the community's immediate housing crunch. 
</P>
<P>
With Bremen's once-bustling port in decline and unemployment running at around 
15% -- twice the national average -- city officials worry about growing social 
divisions between haves and have-nots and an eventual backlash against 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a honeymoon period now, but this can't last," Scherf said. "If you 
don't have a job or a place to live, it's extremely worrisome. It can lead to 
new kinds of (social) divisions. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a danger in this process," he added. "It's a real threat to the 
democratic development of the country." 
</P>
<P>
Added Regina Bruss, author of a book on the city's early postwar years and an 
exhibits organizer at a Bremen museum: "Those who have lived here all their 
lives and can't find work are clearly upset when someone comes in and gets a 
job immediately." 
</P>
<P>
A few miles west of the city center, on the campus of Bremen University, 
student leaders expressed anger that officials ignored their pleas for 
additional housing, yet now launch an emergency construction program for 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Students last year briefly lived in tents to protest the city's housing 
shortage. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, there is absolutely no understanding for this," said the university's 
student council president, Andreas Bovenschulte. "It's hypocrisy." 
</P>
<P>
The student leader added: "We've always demanded that empty houses be 
requisitioned, but were told it was against the law. Now they are going to do 
it for the refugees." 
</P>
<P>
He said the present euphoric mood in the country eventually would be overtaken 
by a growing resentment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the government's fault, but the refugees could end up being a scapegoat," 
Bovenschulte said. 
</P>
<P>
In part, his remarks reflected a sharp generational difference in West 
Germany's reaction to its refugee problem. 
</P>
<P>
Older Germans, who remember another, far larger wave of refugees who came West 
in the chaos that followed the Nazis' collapse in 1945, have been quicker to 
volunteer material help than those too young to have memories of such events, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Those who lived through those early postwar years also say West Germany's 
enormous prosperity has left residents less rather than more willing to help 
newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
Many recalled a deep sense of solidarity among people who existed on 1,000 
calories per day, grubbed for coal and made sweaters from old sack material. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a greater preparedness among people then to rebuild together than 
there is today to divvy up and let others have a share of the prosperity," 
Scherf said. 
</P>
<P>
Scherf complained, for example, that some city landlords have said they prefer 
to keep their buildings empty rather than rent them out. 
</P>
<P>
"That's clearly a provocation, and we must force them to rent those places," he 
said.

ABORTION ISSUE WILL FADE, WHITE HOUSE SAYS 
</P>

<P>
The White House suggested Monday that abortion laws will not be a deciding 
issue of next year's elections and called divergent views on the subject a 
"matter of principle," not of politics. 
</P>
<P>
Marlin Fitzwater, President Bush's spokesman, also voiced recognition of 
rallies in favor of abortion rights that took place Sunday in the capital and 
elsewhere around the country. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly approve of the rally and are glad that (participants) exercised 
their right to speak out," Fitzwater said of the Washington gathering, which 
drew a crowd estimated at 150,000. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater made the comments in the aftermath of last week's elections, in which 
Republicans who espoused Bush's view that abortion should be outlawed lost to 
pro-choice Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
After weeks of tough anti-abortion talk from the White House and two vetoes of 
abortion-financing legislation, Fitzwater suggested that Bush has no quarrel 
with those who support legal abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The rally on Sunday "was expressing the views of a lot of people who feel very 
strongly and very deeply about that subject," Fitzwater said. "Abortion is an 
issue that people feel strongly about on both sides. It's a matter of 
principle." 
</P>
<P>
Bush favors amending the Constitution to prohibit abortion. He vetoed two 
spending bills that would have extended Medicaid coverage to abortions for poor 
women who were victims of rape or incest. Currently, federal funds may pay for 
an abortion only if pregnancy endangers the mother's life. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater recently said that Bush would not hire anyone for a policy-making 
position who did not share his view on abortion. But on Monday, he said: 
</P>
<P>
"It's our belief that people should take a position on this issue according to 
their strong moral and religious and personal beliefs, and that should be the 
deciding factor, not politics." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about poll results indicating that pro-choice positions helped Democratic 
gubernatorial candidates in New Jersey and Virginia last week, and in the New 
York mayor's race, Fitzwater said: "We think there were a lot of issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Any number of factors resulted in the victories and the losses for the 
particular candidates. . . . Abortion was an important issue, but . . . people 
don't decide elections on one issue." 
</P>
<P>
As to whether the White House shared some GOP strategists' worry that the 
abortion issue might handicap Republicans in 1990, Fitzwater said: "No."

JACKSON COOL TO CAPITAL MAYOR RACE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: HE SAYS OFFICE HAS TOO MANY RESTRICTIONS. STATEHOOD FOR DISTRICT OF 
COLUMBIA IS NOW HIS TOP PRIORITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Rev. Jesse Jackson on Monday all but ruled out running for mayor of the 
District of Columbia next year because he said the restrictions on mayors 
prevent them from solving their cities' worst problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The notion of Jesse being mayor (with) the rules beyond my control is 
unappealing," Jackson said at a meeting with Times editors and reporters. "I've 
thought the situation through." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who was in Los Angeles for the abortion-rights rally Sunday and 
television tapings Monday, said the federal government -- and particularly the 
White House -- has too much control over spending priorities that affect local 
governments in numerous ways. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter who is driving the car if the gas is being siphoned off," 
Jackson said when asked why inner-city blacks in particular have continued to 
suffer even as black mayors have been elected around the country for nearly two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who ran for President in 1984 and 1988, insists that he now plans to 
direct much of his energy into trying to gain statehood for the District of 
Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
The district's budget and its laws are overseen by Congress, and the 700,000 
residents have only one non-voting delegate to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue from where I stand in terms of growth and expansion," Jackson said, 
"is not who will be mayor of D.C. with all those liabilities, but who, under 
self-determination, will be the senators, the governor, lieutenant governor. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would be interested in one of those jobs, Jackson replied, "Well, 
it is premature to conclude what role I would play once we got into the 
kingdom." 
</P>
<P>
Always a harsh critic of the Administration of former President Ronald Reagan, 
Jackson said, "A combination of freezing the minimum wage for 10 years on one 
hand and cutting the supply of affordable houses on the other hand equals an 
epidemic of homelessness. That is above the level of a mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"The easy access to guns and to drugs is an international issue. It is 
presidential stuff. So is educating those who are victimized. That is not 
something cities can handle without some help and some real partnership." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson recently moved from Chicago to the District of Columbia, setting off 
speculation that he may run for mayor even if Mayor Marion Barry, an old 
Jackson friend, does not step aside. 
</P>
<P>
"D.C. has more people than five other states," Jackson said. "These places have 
two senators and congress people who vote. D.C. pays more taxes than 10 other 
states. In the Vietnam War, it was third from the top in soldiers sent who 
died." 
</P>
<P>
A majority vote by both the Senate and the House and presidential approval 
would give the district statehood, but Congress has never shown much interest 
in making this happen. 
</P>
<P>
On another topic, Jackson strongly objected to the conclusion by some political 
pundits that last week's victories for black candidates in the New York mayor's 
race and Virginia gubernatorial race meant that he was being eclipsed as a 
black leader. 
</P>
<P>
David N. Dinkins was elected as New York's first black mayor and L. Douglas 
Wilder apparently will become the nation's first elected black governor. A 
recount is expected in the tight Virginia contest. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson stayed in the background in both campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that Doug (Wilder) ran a campaign fashioned to the contours of his 
state," Jackson said. "So to try to play us off against each other is unfair 
and racist. . . . He didn't ask Teddy Kennedy to campaign for him and Kennedy 
lives in McLean, Va. 
</P>
<P>
"In New York, (the Republicans) tried to use me to whip up fear rather than 
hope, so we made the judgment that we must not give them that option around 
which to polarize." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson added, "Last week was tremendous progress for white America. Black 
Americans and women -- we expanded in last week's elections. White Americans 
matured."

BUSH PUTS SALK, LANDRY, 25 OTHERS ON DRUG PANEL

<P>
President Bush on Monday enlisted 27 citizens, including a medical pioneer, an 
admiral and a football coach, to advise him in the battle against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Bush signed an executive order at the White House creating the new Presidential 
Drug Advisory Council. 
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony, Bush recalled that when he announced his anti-drug strategy two 
months ago: "I asked the question, 'Who's responsible?' Everyone who uses 
drugs. Everyone who sells drugs. And everyone who looks the other way. 
</P>
<P>
"This council is composed of people, leaders in each of their fields, who will 
not look the other way," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
The new advisers "all share my goal of ridding America of illegal drugs," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, which has a two-year life span, will be headed by a Dallas oilman, 
William Moss, and includes Dr. Jonas Salk, discoverer of the polio vaccine; 
former Dallas Cowboys coach Tom Landry, and retired Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., 
former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the committee are such corporate chief executives as Roger B. Smith of 
General Motors Corp. and Robert Wright of NBC, as well as Dr. Burton Lee III, 
the White House physician, and William French Smith, attorney general in the 
Ronald Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
With drug policy director William J. Bennett at his side, Bush urged the 
advisers to find better ways to: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Encourage employers to keep workplaces drug free. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Enlist volunteers in the fight against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Communicate to all Americans, especially the young, the importance of 
staying off drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Coordinate existing private and nonprofit anti-drug efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Involve the private sector "in the building of prisons and jails." 
</P>
<P>
Bush announced a nearly $8-billion anti-drug program two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Other panel members include: 
</P>
<P>
James E. Burke of Princeton, N. J., former chairman of Johnson &amp; Johnson; 
Alvah H. Chapman Jr. of Miami, former chairman of the board of Knight-Ridder 
Inc.; the Rev. Edward A. Malloy, president of the University of Notre Dame; 
William J. McCarthy of Arlington, Mass., president of the International 
Brotherhood of Teamsters; Ruben B. Ortega, police chief of Phoenix, Ariz., and 
Richard F. Schubert of McLean, Va., former president of the American Red Cross.

JOGGER ATTACKED IN CENTRAL PARK TO GO HOME FOR HOLIDAY

The woman who suffered brain damage when she was gang-raped and beaten in 
Central Park has recovered so well that she is planning to have Thanksgiving 
dinner with her family in the Pittsburgh, Pa., area, a court source said. 
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old investment banker, who was left for dead after she was attacked 
while jogging on April 19, has been recovering at a dramatic pace at Gaylord 
Hospital in Wallingford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
"She leaves the hospital frequently, returns to Manhattan and visits her 
apartment," the source said. "She's going to be with her family on 
Thanksgiving." The woman is originally from the Pittsburgh area. 
</P>
<P>
She is eager to testify at the trial of six teen-agers charged with raping and 
attempting to murder her, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
But she will be allowed to do so only if family, doctors and prosecutors think 
it is in her best interests. 
</P>
<P>
The woman owes her life to the puddle of cool mud in which her attackers left 
her, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
"The mud acted as a cool compress. It prevented excessive swelling and damage 
of the brain," the court source said.

'MAGGOT MAN' WAGES UP-CLOSE BATTLE ON PEST;

<P>
INFESTATION: WHILE STATE ENTOMOLOGIST SEARCHES BACK YARDS, RESIDENTS GIRD FOR A 
DOUBLE-DOSE OF MALATHION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
State entomologist Lorin Bronson looked up Monday as he straddled a bucket full 
of slimy slices of persimmon and joked, "The kids call me the maggot man." 
</P>
<P>
Then Bronson returned to his thankless job of searching for creamy white and 
wiggling Medfly worms from fruit plucked from a tree on Mound Avenue in South 
Pasadena where three adult flies were discovered a week ago -- the latest of 
half a dozen Medfly finds in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of that find and an additional discovery in Alhambra, state and 
county officials have decided to spray a 22-square-mile area around the street 
of quaint 80-year-old wood-frame homes with the pesticide malathion -- not once 
but twice. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual double-shot of the paint-eating pesticide in an area that has never 
been sprayed before was ordered because pest control officials fighting 
infestations in six sectors of the county have temporarily run out of sterile 
Medflies. Normal procedures call for spraying an area with malathion and then 
releasing millions of sterile female flies, which overwhelm the males and breed 
them out of existence. 
</P>
<P>
The first spraying is scheduled for Thursday night with the second to follow 
sometime over the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have enough sterile Medflies for new areas where the infestation has 
emerged," said Bob Atkins, Los Angeles County deputy agricultural commissioner 
in charge of pest prevention. "We've exceeded the capacity of our breeding 
center in Hawaii and we are now requesting sterile flies from Guatemala and 
Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
Bronson had all day to think about that and other aspects of the infestation as 
he cut and sliced more than 50 persimmons in a white plastic bucket. 
</P>
<P>
"These maggots are disgusting, man. They live in their own digestive soup of 
bacteria and spoiled fruit," Bronson said, peering at a gooey slice through a 
magnifying glass. "Me, I'm doing a public service. If this bug gets established 
in California, it'll be here until the next ice age." 
</P>
<P>
Bert Carlisle, owner of the 50-year-old persimmon tree, has resigned himself to 
getting sprayed twice with pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm picking persimmons like a son-of-a-gun and giving them away as quickly as 
I can," said Carlisle, 49. "If it takes two shots of malathion to knock off the 
Medfly, no problem, I can handle that." 
</P>
<P>
Carlisle's next-door neighbor, Leo Rakowski, was less certain about the effect 
the sprayings might have on a beehive he tends on the roof of his garage. 
</P>
<P>
"All I ask is that they tell me the night before they spray so I can lock up my 
bees," said Rakowski, 74, a prominent business owner in the area. "What else 
can I do?" 
</P>
<P>
Bronson said, "Some bees will die from feeding on droplets of bait. But we've 
never lost a hive from spraying." 
</P>
<P>
Around the corner, the manager of a popular coffee shop that stays open until 2 
a.m. daily pondered the prospect of getting sued by customers whose cars may be 
doused with droplets of pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
"But we won't close early, that's for sure," said Rick Harper, 26, manager of 
the Salt Shaker Restaurant, which has a parking lot that accommodates up to 80 
cars. "I'm going to post a sign on the front door saying, 'They'll be spraying 
and I do recommend you cover your car.' "

NAVY ACCIDENT TOLL CLIMBS TO 102 FOR '89, HIGHEST IN DECADE;

From the crash two weeks ago of a training pilot into an aircraft carrier, 
killing five, to Sunday's accident involving the San Diego-based destroyer 
Kinkaid, the Navy has been plagued by a nightmare of men killed at sea and in 
plane crashes. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Sean Michael McPhee, 24, a navigator from Santa Rosa, Calif., was killed 
when the Kinkaid collided with a freighter off Malaysia. His death brought the 
year's toll to 102 Navy personnel killed during training and standard operating 
procedures -- the highest in the decade -- officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 63 men were killed and there were 69 major accidents. So far in 
1989, there have been 67 major accidents involving loss of life or more than 
$1-million damage to Navy property. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent string of accidents, Navy officials said, their personnel 
are well-trained and maintain a high regard for safety. 
</P>
<P>
"The readiness of today's naval forces has never been better," said Adm. C.A.H. 
Trost, chief of naval operations, in a statement released Monday. "The Navy 
faces an unforgiving and inherently dangerous environment at sea. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite uncompromising attention to safety procedures and exhaustive training 
standards, the dangers are always present. And despite our best efforts, 
accidents do happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials pointed out that this year's death toll includes 47 sailors killed in 
what they called the bombing of the battleship Iowa last April. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not consider the Iowa an accident," said. Lt. Greg Smith, a Navy 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy determined that an explosion aboard the Iowa was an "act of suicide" 
by Gunner's Mate Clayton Hartwig, who died in the blast. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, an average of 70 men have died each year while serving the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
The collision involving the Kinkaid, one of five accidents in recent days, was 
part of "what has been a bad couple of weeks for the Navy," said Cmdr. David 
Dillon, a spokesman for the commander of the Pacific Fleet in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
McPhee was killed as he rested in his berth. Five others were injured. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they have taken the unusual step of installing five telephone 
lines aboard the vessel to allow sailors to call home in an effort to prop up 
flagging morale among the crew. 
</P>
<P>
"The crew is working, working to get things back to normal," said Lt. Cmdr. 
David Cunningham, who was reached by telephone aboard the ship in Singapore. "I 
have no idea how long that will take. We're doing everything possible to make 
life as normal as possible on board." 
</P>
<P>
Navy accidents in recent weeks include: 
</P>
<P>
* Thursday, a Navy Reserve jet crashed into a Georgia apartment complex, 
killing two residents. 
</P>
<P>
* Nov. 1, nine sailors suffered smoke inhalation and four were treated for 
burns after a boiler fire aboard the tanker Monongahela, about 500 miles west 
of Gibraltar. 
</P>
<P>
* Oct. 31, three sailors and a reported $4 million of non-nuclear missiles were 
swept overboard by a wave striking the aircraft carrier Eisenhower near Cape 
Hatteras, N.C. One sailor is presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
* Oct. 30, a sailor fell overboard from the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson in the 
Pacific about 620 miles north of Wake Island and is presumed lost. 
</P>
<P>
* Oct. 30, a pilot dropped a 500-pound bomb on the guided missile cruiser 
Reeves in the Indian Ocean, causing minor injuries to five sailors. 
</P>
<P>
* On Oct. 29, a training jet crashed aboard the aircraft carrier Lexington in 
the Gulf of Mexico, killing the pilot and four sailors aboard the vessel.

Combustion Engineering Inc., a diversified international manufacturing and 
service concern, said Monday that it agreed to be bought by a European 
industrial conglomerate for $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd., a Swiss-Swedish supplier of technical equipment and 
services, will pay $40 each for all of Combustion Engineering's outstanding 
shares in a tender offer to start later this week. 
</P>
<P>
Combustion Engineering stock surged $13.50 a share to close at $39 in heavy 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, with analysts saying that they expect 
the European company to succeed with its friendly takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
The transaction is not subject to financing, the announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are paying top dollar for it," said analyst George Gaspar at Robert W. 
Baird Inc., who noted that the offer was high enough to discourage any 
potential rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Combustion Engineering evolved from a New Jersey company called the Locomotive 
Superheater Co., founded in 1910, into a provider of high-tech industrial 
products such as computerized controls for plants. 
</P>
<P>
It restructured after its primary business of selling power plant equipment and 
services went into a decline in the early 1980s and has been successful selling 
the technology internationally. Some 40% of its sales come from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd., a supplier of electrical equipment and services for 
industry, has annual sales of about $20 billion and is owned by Sweden's Asea 
AB and the Swiss-Swedish Brown Boveri et CIE AG. 
</P>
<P>
Combustion Engineering, which supplies the power generation, process and public 
sector markets, had 1988 sales of about $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the offer will be subject to a number of conditions, including 
the tender of shares representing at least 80% of the outstanding stock. 
</P>
<P>
A definitive merger agreement was approved by directors of both companies.

ANHEUSER-BUSCH MAY HAVE TO SHARE MARKETING RIGHTS FOR SHAMU 
</P>

<P>
Anheuser-Busch has agreed to spend $1.1 billion to buy the Sea World parks from 
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, but it may have to share the marketing rights to 
their symbol, Shamu the killer whale. 
</P>
<P>
The Orlando-based HBJ already has a licensing agreement with Watson General 
Pictures of La Jolla, which created the cartoon "Shamu -- The Beginning" that 
has not yet appeared on television. 
</P>
<P>
Any proceeds from the animated special or merchandising spinoffs will be shared 
among Anheuser-Busch of St. Louis, Watson General Pictures and Watson's partner 
in the making of the movie, Lion's Den Venture. 
</P>
<P>
Anheuser-Busch will also have to share profits, which analysts say could reach 
into the millions of dollars, from the marketing of other Sea World characters 
and animals, according to the licensing agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Anheuser-Busch spokeswoman Vicki Pearlman said the company knew about Watson 
General Pictures when it agreed to purchase the parks from HBJ in September. 
The sale of the Sea World parks is set to close later this month. 
</P>
<P>
"The company was aware of the licensing agreement relating to the Shamu 
character," she said. 
</P>
<P>
One expert said Anheuser-Busch may try to buy the rights back from Watson 
General Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think Anheuser-Busch would want control of the characters," said Bert 
Boksen, who follows theme parks for the Raymond, James &amp; Associates 
regional brokerage in St. Petersburg. "Somebody else . . . could portray Shamu 
in a commercial drinking Miller beer." 
</P>
<P>
HBJ and Sea World officials were not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Watson General Pictures' 1988 annual report indicates that the agreement gives 
Sea World royalties of 6% to 50% of proceeds from merchandising as well as a 
share in proceeds from the cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
Watson General Pictures says in its 1988 annual report that its plans include 
"initiating of a worldwide marketing and merchandising program" to promote the 
photogenic killer whale as well as television specials, a feature film valued 
at $6 million to $8 million, and a children's TV series. 
</P>
<P>
The report also says that Watson has been approached by "a major merchandising 
company" that is interested in marketing the Shamu projects with the company. 
The company was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Pearlman would not say whether Anheuser-Busch has been in touch with Watson 
or has an interest in buying rights back from Watson.

SOFTWARE FIRMS MAKING IT BIG IN EMPLOYEE TRAINING PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, San Diego County Business Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past decade, a new generation of software companies has emerged to 
help corporations reduce the increasing cost of employee training, which adds 
up to more than $40 billion a year nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
One such company is Courseware/Andersen Consulting, a Scripps Ranch-based 
software company that assists corporate clients in developing and implementing 
self-administered, personal computer-based learning software. The training 
programs reduce the cost and time involved in employee training and make the 
programs demonstrably more effective, industry observers said. 
</P>
<P>
International Business Machines, for example, has reduced by half the time it 
used to take to train its computer sales personnel, an improvement due in part 
to systems designed by Courseware/Andersen Consulting. The savings to IBM total 
in the hundreds of millions of dollars, Courseware/Andersen Consulting partner 
John Splavec asserted Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Self-administered, PC-based software programs now represent 50% of a typical 
IBM corporate training curriculum, Splavec said, up from zero eight years ago. 
The rest of a trainee's time is generally spent in a classroom setting or on 
the job, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Known simply as Courseware before it was acquired for more than $5 million last 
July by Chicago-based Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. accounting and consulting firm, 
Courseware/Andersen Consulting has been a leader in developing "interactive" 
systems that employ video disks to give training systems a personal touch. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1972 and based in San Diego since 1977, the company got its start 
designing training systems for the Navy, including flight training programs for 
pilots and gunnery practice instruction for sailors. 
</P>
<P>
The company was "discovered" by IBM in 1981, which then gave it a $10,000 
contract to analyze the effectiveness of its marketing training. The 
relationship with IBM subsequently has grown to the point that IBM is 
Courseware/Andersen Consulting's largest customer, accounting for more than $1 
million per year, or 20% of the company's expected $6 million in 1989 revenue, 
Splavec said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Other clients include NCR, Apple Computer, Fujitsu Systems of America and 
Leadership Studies of Escondido, a corporate leadership training firm that has 
taught more than 1 million corporate managers, Splavec said. The bulk of the 
Courseware/Andersen Consulting's products are sold to computer and insurance 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., one of the nation's "Big Eight" accounting firms, 
came into the picture after Courseware sent out feelers to the industry that it 
was looking to forge a "strategic alliance" to pursue the booming systems 
integration market. The term is the catch-all phrase used to describe 
companies' attempts to unify disparate elements of the electronic office into 
systems easily used by all employees. 
</P>
<P>
The combination with Andersen is a "natural fit" because Andersen had a similar 
employee training practice within its Andersen Consulting subsidiary numbering 
400 employees. Splavec said the worldwide network of Andersen offices will 
afford Courseware/Andersen Consulting "a tremendous opportunity to expand our 
services." 
</P>
<P>
The firm's sales could reach $13 million by 1992, he said. The company and its 
60 employees will remain based in San Diego, however. 
</P>
<P>
Splavec, 48, himself a former IBM computer salesman, was one of a half dozen 
major shareholders who, combined, held a controlling interest in Courseware 
stock before the sale to Andersen. Other major shareholders are co-founders 
Gerald Faust, Jonah Hymes, C. J. Ross and Gene Regard. Only Regard is still a 
full-time employee. 
</P>
<P>
Why are the PC-based training systems more efficient than classroom settings? 
Splavec said it has to do with the fact that most classroom curricula are 
geared to the "bottom 15% to 20%" of a class, meaning that a majority of 
students are held back by the minority. 
</P>
<P>
Students on the PC-based programs can proceed at their own speed. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the computer training programs are non-threatening, unlike the classroom 
environment in which many adult students are afraid to ask what they think are 
dumb questions, Splavec said. "You can ask the PC all the dumb questions you 
want and not be intimidated by it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The need for employee training in the workplace is heightened by the presence 
of sophisticated equipment. But the need is also exacerbated because 25% to 33% 
of all high school graduates would flunk one adult literacy test or another and 
must be brought up to speed by their employers, Splavec said. 
</P>
<P>
Another key is that systems such as those designed by Courseware/Andersen 
Consulting include built-in self-assessment functions that do not allow the 
student to go forward until he or she has mastered the material to be learned. 
The self-assessment function also allows the trainee to jump ahead to the 
appropriate place in the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
The self-assessment function also gives companies the means to measure the 
success of the training programs, a key element as the cost of employee 
training rises, said Jack Bowsher, the retired head of IBM's employee education 
program who now lives in Westport, Conn. Bowsher is also the author of 
"Educating America, Lessons Learned in the Nation's Corporations." 
</P>
<P>
"When companies are spending billions on these programs, it tells you that they 
are getting very serious about how to train and retrain employees," Bowsher 
said. "What it amounts to is that companies are putting more measurement into 
the things. They want people to like (the material), learn it and apply it, and 
they want it to have a business result." 
</P>
<P>
"As companies become more professional about wanting a higher return on 
training, they turn to someone like Courseware who have instructional 
designers, media experts and professional educators who know how to build high 
quality courses that will ensure what we call 'mastery of learning,' or that 
all the students will learn." 
</P>
<P>
The integration of video technology displayed on a PC's high-resolution monitor 
in particular has helped PCs augment classroom teaching as the means of 
transferring "corporate culture," or history, tradition and beliefs, Bowsher 
said, a critical objective in most employee training programs.

STATE AGENCY SEEKS HISPANIC CHAMBER'S HELP; 
</P>
<P>
JOBS: THE STATE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL HAS ASKED THE CIVIC GROUP TO IDENTIFY 
SMALL, MINORITY-OWNED BUSINESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Tapped by a state employment agency to help it award at least $2.5 million in 
employee training funds, the San Diego County Hispanic Chamber of Commerce is 
quickly establishing its presence in a region where a surging Latino population 
accounts for nearly 20% of the county's residents. 
</P>
<P>
Although barely a year old, the chamber was chosen last month by the state 
Employment Training Panel (ETP) to identify small, minority-owned businesses 
that would profit from financial assistance in training new hires or retraining 
current workers. Now numbering 170 members, the chamber was formed last 
November to enhance the development and growth of Latino enterprises in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber will apply directly to the ETP on behalf of the small businesses 
that it identifies and has an opportunity to obtain at least $2.5 million of 
the panel's funds, said ETP assistant director Rhonda English-Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Established in 1982, the Sacramento-based agency administers $55 million 
annually from the unemployment insurance fund to help employers establish 
training programs for its workers, English-Johnson said. Although ETP money is 
available for large corporations, the funds designated for the chamber are 
earmarked to assist small businesses, minority-owned or women-owned operations. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had trouble in the past reaching small businesses, the real mom and pop 
shops," English-Johnson said. "Such a small operation, typically, only needs to 
get one person trained. Even if it's for a good program, that's not 
cost-effective for us. We need to have a training class. As a result, we 
couldn't really help those who needed help the most. 
</P>
<P>
"But the chamber, with its tremendous network into the community, can identify 
several businesses that each have one or two individuals that need the same 
type of training," English-Johnson said. "They can get a consortium of seven or 
eight people (from different companies) together for us." 
</P>
<P>
The ETP's recruitment of the San Diego County Hispanic Chamber of Commerce is 
an example of how both government agencies and corporate America are 
increasingly turning to Latino professional organizations to reach the 
exploding population group that is expected to reach 30 million -- or 15% of 
the total U.S. population -- by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, U.S. companies, recognizing this group's projected purchasing power 
of more than $170 billion, spent $550 million advertising to Latinos, 12.1% 
more than in 1987, according to Hispanic Business, a monthly magazine. 
</P>
<P>
American companies are also eager to work with the growing number of quality 
Latino companies in the U.S. to reach this fast-growing population group, 
according to Joe Lira, national administrator of the United States Hispanic 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The Kansas City, Mo.-based group was founded in 1979 to foster the growth and 
development of Latino business enterprises directly and through the support of 
its national network of 200 Latino chambers and professional organizations. 
</P>
<P>
According to Lira, there will be 400,000 Latino-owned and operated businesses 
in the United States by 1990, up from 270,000 in 1975. Lira added that such 
companies reported total revenues of $23 billion last year and hire 1.5 million 
workers annually. 
</P>
<P>
"As Hispanic businesses have grown so has the need for organizations that 
foster its growth and allow these businesses to become a major part of 
corporate America," Lira said. 
</P>
<P>
"Just in the last two years we gained 20% of our membership -- our biggest gain 
ever," Lira said. "But we except even more growth in the next couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego County Hispanic Chamber of Commerce represents the interests of 
3,500 Latino-owned and operated businesses and 473,800 Latino residents in the 
county, according to Arnoldo B. Uribe, one of the chamber's founders and its 
acting president. 
</P>
<P>
"With such numbers, we definitely recognized that there was a need to establish 
an organization that would strive specifically to foster Latino businesses," 
Uribe said. "A lot of our members belong to the regular Chamber of Commerce, 
but to be very honest, they have done very little to promote our own little 
businesses. They just don't have that kind of manpower." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after it was established, the chamber began sponsoring seminars, 
workshops and social events in an attempt to give its members as many 
networking opportunities as possible. Uribe said individual chamber membership 
costs $75. Small to medium businesses are charged $150 and corporations $500. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm having a party and need a caterer, I'm going to go to one of the 
caterers who is a member of the Chamber," Uribe said. "And, when he needs 
flowers for an event, I hope he comes to my place. That's what this is all 
about." After serving 16 years in several educational posts at San Diego State 
University, Uribe, 43, recently opened Fiesta Bonita Florist in Bonita. 
</P>
<P>
So far the chamber has sponsored workshops that have taught participants how to 
get involved with U.S.-Mexico trade, including participating in the booming 
maquiladora industry, on waste management and activities linking buyers to 
vendors. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the chamber plans to take an active role in educating its youth to 
ensure business success. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our primary goals is to counter the tremendous dropout rate among our 
youth," Uribe said. "In the state, nearly 50% of Latino students don't graduate 
from high school, and in the county it's definitely more than 40%. If we don't 
reverse this trend, we recognize that there won't be a next generation of 
Latino businesses." 
</P>
<P>
The education committee's first function is a fund-raiser dance scheduled for 
Feb. 9 at the Marriott Hotel in Mission Valley, Uribe said. The chamber hopes 
to net $10,000 from the dance, all of which will be used for scholarships to 
assist high school seniors aspiring to attend college. 
</P>
<P>
The committee is also in the midst of establishing a "speakers' bureau" by 
tapping its professional members to serve as role models and to lecture at the 
county's schools.

BROKERS OFFER CASH, PRIZES TO REKINDLE HOUSING SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In August, when television producer John ("Real People") Barbour put his 
four-bedroom house in Toluca Lake up for sale for $1.2 million, he figured it 
would sell in a breeze. The house has a pool, a Jacuzzi, is close to the 
studios -- and three months later it's still looking for a new owner. "It's 
taking a little longer than we thought," Barbour said. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody is more eager to find a buyer than Barbour's broker, Sol Taylor of Jon 
Douglas Co. in Studio City, who figures to get a hefty commission when it 
finally does sell. The problem is that the housing market in the San Fernando 
Valley has slowed considerably. The inventory of houses and condominiums for 
sale is up more than 50% from a year ago, while the number of houses and 
condominiums that sold last month was down 20% from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
What to do? Sellers and real estate agents are increasingly using inducements 
to entice brokers who represent buyers to see their properties and get them 
sold in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor plans to pay some of the closing costs for the buyer of Barbour's house, 
plus a cash bonus -- he won't say how much -- to the broker who brings the 
elusive buyer in. Last week Taylor held an open house at Barbour's house -- the 
fifth since it went on the market -- and used free food and refreshments to try 
to lure brokers. Only nine brokers turned up out of the 200 invited. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a start, Taylor said. "If you get a dozen agents to show up, it's a 
success." 
</P>
<P>
"People got spoiled when the market was faster," said John O'Rourke of John 
O'Rourke Realty in Northridge. "Anybody could sell anything. This is more of a 
normal market." 
</P>
<P>
These days sellers and their listing agents are offering everything from 
lottery tickets, Hawaiian vacations and cash bonuses ranging from $500 to 
$25,000 -- depending on the size of the transaction -- to higher commissions 
for brokers who deliver a buyer for a certain price and by a certain date. They 
are also putting on open house parties, sometimes with bands and valet parking, 
and giving away door prizes, all to try to get brokers in to see houses for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor also has a Woodland Hills condominium he's trying to sell. When he held 
an open house at the condominium last week, he handed out lottery tickets. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest inducement is to fatten the agent's commission if somebody 
sells a property. In most housing transactions, the listing agent and his 
agency -- who represents the seller -- and the selling agent and his agency -- 
who represents the broker -- split a 6% commission. As recently as last spring 
that tradition still held. But in the past few months, some homeowners have 
offered to pay a bonus to the selling agent who represents the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
A case in point is Michele Petit, an independent Chatsworth real estate agent, 
who is trying to sell her house in Chatsworth for $269,900, and she is offering 
a 1% commission bonus to an agent who finds a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes a difference," Petit said. "It gets the selling agent more 
motivated." 
</P>
<P>
Some homeowners say the incentives work. Alicia Stevenson, a sound effects 
specialist, put her Sherman Oaks condo on the market in August and offered a 
$500 bonus to any agent who found a buyer. The condo sold for $152,000 in two 
days, compared to the average wait of about 90 days. After she offered the 
bonus, the traffic of real estate agents and prospective buyers increased. "I 
was making a profit off my place anyway," she said, "and I got a good price for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Ray Carlos, a Coldwell Banker broker in Simi Valley, is offering to pay for a 
trip for two to Hawaii for the agent who brings in a buyer for an Encino Park 
house that Carlos listed for sale at $209,900 six weeks ago. "I might get less 
money," he said, "but something is better than nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Mosk, director of Mike Glickman Realty's condo and townhouse division in 
Woodland Hills, recently bought a Las Vegas slot machine to use at open houses. 
He hands out tokens to brokers, who get free pulls on the slot machine and a 
chance to win trips or other prizes. He has also floated a helium-filled blimp 
the size of two cars outside a house and ran a bubble machine at another. "It's 
just for them to have fun and see the darn property," he said. 
</P>
<P>
These incentives are creative, but why not just lower the asking price on the 
property? Brokers say that isn't enough. "There's so much inventory, agents 
can't see everything on the market. At least if you have a bonus, the agent is 
going to show that house," said Sheri Wegand, a broker at Montelone &amp; 
Associates in Sherman Oaks. Wegand is following her own advice. She's offering 
a $10,000 bonus to an agent who brings in a buyer for an Encino estate that 
she's listed for sale at $1.395 million. 
</P>
<P>
Wegand recalled the case of a North Hollywood house that wasn't attracting any 
offers, probably because it was next to an apartment building. After a few 
months, a bonus was offered and suddenly there were several bids for the house, 
and it sold. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying it was because of the bonus," she said. "But it definitely got 
a lot of agents over to see it." 
</P>
<P>
Not all brokers are keen on the idea of incentives. "Incentives are good, and 
they can work, but they're not a guarantee to sell a property," O'Rourke said. 
"The best way is just to market it well." 
</P>
<P>
James R. Gary, who runs his own realty company in Woodland Hills, said he 
discourages brokers working for him to offer or accept incentives other than 
higher commissions. "What I object to . . . is they tend to hurt the buying 
agent's credibility with his buyer. So I don't believe in special inducements," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
But many real estate agents, such as Joan Knox of J.R. Taylor &amp; Associates 
in Woodland Hills, say luncheons, lottery tickets and bonuses are here to stay 
-- at least as long as the market is slow. "I see nothing wrong with that type 
of thing," Knox said. "I'm not saying brokers are lazy and don't see anything. 
But if it's not seen, it's not going to get sold."

ROAD SHOW OFFERS LOUD LOOK INTO A DESIGNER'S VISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Heralded by caravans of Space Age vehicles and accompanied by an entourage of 
eager young assistants sporting T-shirts blazoned with his signature, Signor 
Luigi Colani led "Automorrow 89," his famous international design circus, into 
town last week. 
</P>
<P>
A fast-talking midway barker sporting a luxuriant handlebar mustache and a 
colorful striped blazer, Ringmaster Colani strode among the vividly colored 
avant-garde cars scattered over the green lawns of Pasadena's Art Center 
College of Design. Followed by a flock of adoring students, Colani ran through 
a polished patter that laid out the principles of his philosophy of 
"bio-design." 
</P>
<P>
"Except for crystalline structures, nature has no straight lines," Colani 
declared, "Every natural form, from the shape of a shark's body to the 
trajectory of an asteroid, follows a curvilinear pattern." 
</P>
<P>
Curves are everywhere in bio-design. Colani's bullet train's nose is shaped 
like a giant tip of a guided missile. A large scale model of a supersonic 
airliner resembles a female form in flight. Many of Colani's cars resemble eggs 
that enclose their occupants like recumbent embryos waiting to be hatched. 
</P>
<P>
Variously described by European and American design publications as a 
"visionary sculptor/engineer," "the architect of the automobile," and "the 
Leonardo Da Vinci of the 20th Century," Colani has created challenging and 
extraordinary styles for everything from male toiletries -- including bars of 
scented soap bearing his effigy -- to high-tech racing yachts. Among his best 
known designs are those for Sony stereo headphones and Canon's easy-grip T-90 
camera. 
</P>
<P>
But the big act in Colani's "Automorrow 89," and the reason for the designer's 
current international tour through the United States, Europe, Japan and the 
Soviet Union, is a radical collection of experimental cars. 
</P>
<P>
"Automorrow 89" began its worldwide odyssey last month on Utah's Bonneville 
Salt Flats, the world's leading auto test grounds. There Colani subjected his 
slow human-powered mini-cars and his fast engine-powered racers to exhaustive 
speed and endurance tests. The vehicles, which are all designed with a concern 
for fuel economy and ecological sensitivity, are designated as "Utah" models in 
honor of the legendary flats. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 2, intended as a prototype for short distance urban transportation, is a 
two-seater, three-wheeled, human-powered fiberglass egg less than three feet 
high weighing a mere 116 pounds. Its two pedaling drivers lie cushioned and 
supine, watching watch the road through pounding knees. When the legs tire, an 
auxiliary 30cc moped engine helps keep the fiberglass egg rolling. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 3, a one-person version of the above, weighs 35 pounds. Its composite 
alloy, bobbin-shaped shell fits its lone driver like a second skin. Both Utah 2 
and Utah 3 are light enough to be lifted and carried by their riders. 
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow's vehicles have to be lean and mean," Colani said. "They must 
generate maximum use within a minimum size. There is no future for the 
overweight, overpowered monsters now being churned out by the world's auto 
industry. We are running out of room in our cities and out of breathable air. 
We are losing touch with natural rhythms." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Colani's views of current auto design are caustic. "Most car 
styling is pure design prostitution," he said. "It is made to please a legion 
of publicists who have conned a gullible public into lusting after false 
smiles. We cannot continue for long in this massive obscenity that is 
destroying our cities and our souls. 
</P>
<P>
"If people yearn for the va-va-vroom of overpowered engines, let them slip a 
noisy race car audio tape in the decks of their human-powered autos. They can 
set their blood on fire without burning up the world."

Colani's version of a vroom vehicle is his Utah 8, a low-riding two-seater 
powered by a 1,000cc turbocharged BMW power-plant capable of reaching 150 
m.p.h. Utah 8's curvaceous white plastic body fits tight to a carbon-fiber 
chassis with a weight of only 1,300 pounds. The car's fuel economy of 35 miles 
to the gallon is extraordinary for a high-performance racer. 
</P>
<P>
In response to concerns about the safety of people riding at high speed in such 
flimsy containers, he shrugged: "I favor a low-speed, lightweight 
transportation strategy. High speeds are for long-distance travel by train and 
plane, not for cities. Even with overpowered cars, high speeds are seldom 
possible in the universal urban congestion we have created in the past 20 
years." 
</P>
<P>
If his cars aren't meant to travel fast, why are they so radically aerodynamic 
in shape? "People love the idea and the romance of speed," Colani said. "We 
produce automobiles that look as if they're flying even while parked in the 
driveway. It is the primal image of the jet fighter, that hawk of the sky, that 
haunts our dreams." 
</P>
<P>
Colani, 61, learned to dream creatively as the son of an Italian businessman 
living in Berlin. The four Colani children were never given toys; instead their 
parents urged them to create their own from wooden blocks, paper, cardboard and 
colored crayons. After a course in painting at Berlin's Academy of Art, Colani 
studied aerodynamics and racing car design at the University of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Now based in Berne, Switzerland, Colani travels the world, stirring up 
corporations and organizations as conservative as Japan's Mitsubishi and 
Detroit's American Iron and Steel Institute with his provocative yet artful 
showmanship. A spokesman for the AISI explained why they are one of the 
sponsors of his current global tour: "With the industrial use of steel in 
steady decline, we are very much in need of innovative concepts such as those 
offered by Signor Colani." 
</P>
<P>
"I love steel," Colani confirmed. "For me fiberglass and plastics are just a 
temporary substitute for the new generation of lightweight metal alloys the 
industry is beginning to develop." 
</P>
<P>
Carving expressive curves in the air, Colani exclaimed: "Steel is the sexiest 
of all man-made materials; its potential shapes are sensuous beyond imagining. 
I embrace steel's future like a lover, and together we will produce a host of 
beautiful and sensible children."

*Styron's choice: Novelist William Styron says that in 1986 he almost joined 
the ranks of such authors as Ernest Hemingway, Virginia Woolf and Jack London 
who have committed suicide. Styron wrote in December's Vanity Fair that he 
"used alcohol as the magical conduit to fantasy and euphoria, and to the 
enhancement of the imagination." But in 1985, he said, his body suddenly 
rejected alcohol, and he grew depressed. After going so far as to redraft his 
will and to pen a suicide note, Styron checked himself into a hospital for 
treatment and regained his will to live.

* Split: The wife of former New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange says her 
husband has left her for his speech writer, and Naomi Lange wants the speech 
writer's identity known. "The point is he's gone off because of Margaret Pope," 
Mrs. Lange said in a newspaper interview. "Society is totally sick when people 
rob other people's husbands, and I think Margaret Pope's name should be 
exposed." Lange had said in a two-line statement that he had separated from his 
wife, whom he married in London in 1968.

* Leavin' on a jet plane: Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, flew out 
of Hong Kong Monday, ending what could be the last royal visit to the British 
colony before China resumes sovereignty in 1997.

* Early Thanksgiving: A post-campaign television commercial by New Jersey 
Gov.-elect James Florio may prompt a few double takes. There's no campaign 
rhetoric this time, just a simple word of thanks. In the ad, a beaming Florio 
tells voters he appreciates the landslide victory they gave him last week over 
Republican James Courter.

'30S TREATMENT FOR VARICOSE VEINS MAKES A COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No matter how beastly the heat, Sheila Parker wouldn't wear shorts. Not even to 
the beach. "I just didn't want anyone to see my legs," the 38-year-old San 
Clemente businesswoman says. 
</P>
<P>
She was self-conscious about the unsightly varicose veins that crisscrossed her 
legs like a road map. Then she heard about sclerotherapy, a nonsurgical 
injection technique to obliterate the veins. 
</P>
<P>
Six treatments and $2,400 later, Parker is wearing shorts. And giggling about 
eyeing even shorter shorts. 
</P>
<P>
Sclerotherapy is catching on, especially in leg-conscious Southern California. 
In the last three years, at least six specialty vein clinics have sprung up 
from Beverly Hills to La Jolla. Others are due to open in Riverside and the San 
Fernando Valley. And more than 100 dermatologists, plastic surgeons and other 
physicians also offer the treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Sclerotherapy isn't new. It debuted in the 1930s but was not used as often as 
the more effective "stripping" surgery, in which veins are cut or tied off. 
</P>
<P>
But sclerotherapy's comeback, doctors say, is prompted by greatly refined 
techniques and consumer demand for nonsurgical, quick-recovery treatments. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents claim sclerotherapy fills that bill: Patients can walk out of the 
doctor's office and right back to work. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers first must decide, however, who should perform the procedure. That's 
not an easy task, considering there's a turf war raging between doctors who 
specialize in sclerotherapy and those who devote just part of their practices 
to it. 
</P>
<P>
The specialists say they do the job more quickly and effectively; the 
generalists claim their work is just as good and costs less. 
</P>
<P>
The fees range from $150 for a half hour to $300 for specialists. 
</P>
<P>
On one point sclerotherapy advocates agree: It can rule out the need for 
surgery for all but the worst varicose veins. 
</P>
<P>
About 36 million Americans, mostly women, have varicose veins, often swollen, 
blue and lumpy, or the smaller spider veins, clusters of threadlike, purplish 
veins. 
</P>
<P>
"Varicose veins occur when increased pressure in the leg veins prevents blood 
from returning to the heart normally," says Dr. Jan Victor Karlin, medical 
director of the Vein Clinics of America in Beverly Hills. "Some blood pools in 
the superficial veins and stagnates, stretching and enlarging the vessels. Once 
veins become varicose or spidery, healthy veins take over their work." Heredity 
plays the most significant role in varicose veins, Karlin says. But pregnancy 
and long periods of standing can aggravate the condition. Eliminating the 
unsightly veins isn't just vanity-driven. The vessels can throb, ache and make 
standing impossible. 
</P>
<P>
In sclerotherapy, a doctor injects a "sclerosing" solution that collapses the 
walls of the vein. "A scar forms," says Dr. Charles J. Frahm, co-director of 
the Weinberg Vein Clinics in La Jolla and Beverly Hills, "and is reabsorbed by 
the body." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors disagree on the best sclerosing solution to use -- saline or a variety 
of others. The FDA has approved only one solution: sodium tetradecyl sulfate, 
according to spokeswoman Susan Cruzan. 
</P>
<P>
But doctors who use other solutions, such as saline, claim they're just as 
safe. Whatever solution is used, it stays at the injection site, not spreading 
to surrounding healthy veins. 
</P>
<P>
Patients say the procedure doesn't hurt much. 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Mason, a television and movie costumer, rested comfortably on an 
examining table recently while Karlin injected the solution dozens of times. 
"I'm aware of the needle going into the vein," she said, "but there's no real 
pain. It feels like little pin pricks." 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Parker, of San Clemente, rates the treatments as far more comfortable 
than a trip to the dentist or electrolysis. "Those both hurt worse." 
</P>
<P>
Patients can return to work immediately after the treatment, says Karlin, but 
they must wear tape, bandages or special elastic stockings for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
"We tell patients to walk for 30 minutes a day, too," adds Karlin, because the 
exercise can help speed healing. 
</P>
<P>
Bruising at the site of the injection is common but other side effects are 
rare, claims Dr. Brian McDonagh, medical director of Vein Clinics of America. A 
few patients have fainted at the sight of the needle. Some patients have 
contracted a mild rash. 
</P>
<P>
A very small number have experienced anaphylactic shock. After treatment, 
experts say, patients should be closely observed for any allergic reaction. 
Some doctors even give a test dose and then observe the patient. 
</P>
<P>
The number of treatment sessions needed varies by extent of disease. At Vein 
Clinics of America, a typical patient needs six treatments and often spends 
$1,800, says McDonagh. But one Beverly Hills physician charges a typical 
patient $800 to $1,000 for six sessions. Costs are sometimes 
insurance-reimbursed. 
</P>
<P>
Some sclerotherapy proponents claim a high success rate -- 99% or better. 
</P>
<P>
"The veins we obliterate can't grow back," McDonagh says. But new spider or 
varicose veins can appear. "About 10-15% of patients get more spider veins 6 to 
12 months later, requiring more treatment." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Rhonda Rand, a Beverly Hills dermatologist who modifies patient 
expectations by telling them, "I can make you 80% better." 
</P>
<P>
That's good enough for some patients. "I'm thrilled with the results," says 
Mason, who resorted to the treatment primarily for pain relief. "After two 
treatments, my veins don't feel as 'angry' at the end of the day. They don't 
hurt as much." 
</P>
<P>
Another patient, Mary J. Anderson, a 76-year-old Garden Grove woman, underwent 
three treatments at a Vein Clinics of America facility but isn't quite 
satisfied. "The veins still show some," reports Anderson who has asked for a 
full refund, but has only received back doctor's fees. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, there may be another solution. A few doctors are trying to zap 
spider veins with a special laser. Available on a limited basis, the laser 
works somewhat like a microwave oven, killing the targeted veins from the 
inside out but leaving the surrounding tissues unaffected, says Dr. Karen 
Sherwood, USC assistant professor of dermatology and plastic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Pain is minimal, says Sherwood. "It feels like a rubber band being snapped 
against your skin." Often, just one treatment is needed, she says, and costs 
are comparable to sclerotherapy fees. 
</P>
<P>
But sclerotherapy fans are dubious. "Laser would take forever and a day," says 
McDonagh, who thinks that treatment is best reserved for "one or two spider 
veins on the face." On legs, they can leave scars, adds Rand. 
</P>
<P>
First, Check With Your Doctor 
</P>
<P>
People interested in undergoing sclerotherapy or laser therapy should check 
with their own doctor first, advises Dr. Karen Sherwood, USC assistant 
professor of dermatology and plastic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Once patients get a go-ahead, she suggests asking a specialist who performs 
sclerotherapy or laser therapy these questions: 
</P>
<P>
* How many such treatments have you done? 
</P>
<P>
* What are your success rates? 
</P>
<P>
* How many treatments are needed and what will each cost? 
</P>
<P>
* What results can I expect and how quickly? 
</P>
<P>
* What are the side-effects? 
</P>
<P>
* Do you observe patients after the procedure in case of allergic reactions? 
</P>

ART BUCHWALD: THE INSIDE DIRT ON CAMPAIGNS

<TEXT>

Dirty Eddie, campaign manager for Howard McClintic, was packing up his 
literature and campaign signs. 
</P>
<P>
"I am proud of the fact that it was a clean political campaign," he told me. 
"Race never played a role in the contest -- not once, even when we said that 
our opponent went to school with Willie Horton." 
</P>
<P>
"But McClintic was white and so was his opponent." 
</P>
<P>
"All the more reason for not mentioning the race issue. At the beginning of the 
campaign, McClintic announced that he would not introduce color as an issue. He 
stuck to his promise." 
</P>
<P>
"With that statement, he made it an issue." 
</P>
<P>
"McClintic never made it an issue. His opponent, Glockenspiel, did when he 
attacked McClintic for raising it in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
Dirty Eddie continued, "When we started out we decided to take the high road in 
the campaign -- even if it meant losing." 
</P>
<P>
"Is that why you ran a TV commercial of Glockenspiel beating up senior citizens 
in a public park?" 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that the voters had a right to know what turned Glockenspiel on. Was 
it less fair than the other side showing our guy in a raincoat flashing in 
front of a McDonald's restaurant?" 
</P>
<P>
"I am curious about how you managed to get film of Glockenspiel and Noriega 
riding in the same seat on the Ferris wheel." 
</P>
<P>
"It's incredible what you can do with a computer these days." 
</P>
<P>
"Dirty Eddie, I know you ran a clean campaign, but there are some who feel that 
you spread stories about Glockenspiel which weren't necessarily true." 
</P>
<P>
"Like what?" 
</P>
<P>
"Like the time you said that he had to take steroids before he could go out to 
campaign." 
</P>
<P>
"We only mentioned it when they claimed that McClintic was a compulsive gambler 
and bet on his own race. We weren't looking for low-down things to say about 
the other side, but you have to fight fire with fire, or your election will go 
up in smoke. We had so much dirty stuff that we didn't use." 
</P>
<P>
"Such as?" 
</P>
<P>
"Glockenspiel has one of the highest cholesterol counts of anyone running for 
office this year." 
</P>
<P>
"Why didn't we know that?" 
</P>
<P>
"He keeps his cholesterol results in a numbered Swiss bank account." 
</P>
<P>
"Dirty Eddie, it seems to me that the last two weeks of the campaign were the 
worst. Both sides took off their gloves. After what we saw, are you still 
trying to tell me that you ran a clean campaign?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'd bet my life on it. We were entirely issue-oriented." 
</P>
<P>
"Was that why you leaked the story about your opponent being the serial killer 
of Gladly Heights?" 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't say that he was. We just raised the question. That's what political 
campaigns are all about. If someone running for office is a serial killer, the 
public has a right to be informed. We didn't claim that he was unfit for the 
job." 
</P>
<P>
I asked him, "What are you doing with all that stuff you're packing away?" 
</P>
<P>
"Saving it for next year. Politicians will pay anything in 1990 to find a 
squeaky clean campaign manager like myself."

'LOST FORMICANS' MIRRORS THE ANGST OF THE '80S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One way for the playwright to deal with the confusions of his time is to trace 
them back to a single cause. For Clifford Odets in the '30s, the problem was 
simple: greed. Life mustn't be "printed on dollar bills." 
</P>
<P>
For Constance Congdon, author of "Tales of the Lost Formicans" at the Matrix, 
the problem isn't simple. She is not sure what has gone wrong in the '80s. All 
she knows is that everything is coming apart, starting with the family. How to 
convey this? Go with the flow. 
</P>
<P>
Realizing that a play needs a form, Congdon does connect her tales. But very 
loosely. We are supposedly watching a sort of 3-D video of life on Earth in the 
late 20th Century, prepared by scientists on another planet several eons down 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
They know us as the Formicans, a lost tribe who spent Saturday afternoons 
worshipping at the mall. (The play ends with the mall in flames.) It may be 
that they had agents among us. It may even be that they helped to drive us 
crazy. 
</P>
<P>
Congdon has some fun with this Planet X business, linking it to the conspiracy 
theories that help the credulous keep the faith these days. (Don Schlossman 
plays an earnest young Formican who points out that J.F.K. was assassinated in 
a Lincoln convertible. "Think about it." Hmm.) 
</P>
<P>
But Congdon doesn't pursue her little green scientists too far. (They don't 
have to be played that way for us to see them that way.) Her real concern is 
for the creatures on their screen. As with "The Skin of Our Teeth," once you 
strip away the sideshow, you find a family play. 
</P>
<P>
"Home" is a leitmotif, but the home under observation is on the rocks. Dad is 
off on some private mental journey of his own, occasioned by Alzheimer's 
disease. (Actor Hal Bokar shows how absorbing Dad finds this.) Mother (K 
Callan, pale as the grave) wishes she had as good an excuse to tune out the 
real world. 
</P>
<P>
Their two daughters (the conscientious one, Joan McMurtrey, and the rowdy one, 
Lois Foraker) are suffering Post-Divorce Stress Syndrome, as evidenced by an 
insane urge to torch Foraker's ex-husband's Corvette. 
</P>
<P>
And the teen-age grandson is your typical monster of the malls. Is it his fault 
that it costs $100 to talk to a buddy in New York for an hour? "I didn't ask to 
be born, you know." (Insufferable boy, and actor Joshua Goddard shows that he 
could do some real damage, like Cain in "The Skin of Our Teeth.") 
</P>
<P>
"Tales of the Lost Formicans" inspires the laughter of recognition. Yes, that's 
how it is in the late '80s, everybody bemoaning the absence of old-fashioned 
values as they leave the house to torch a Corvette or to meet somebody in a 
motel. Values are for other people. We have needs. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Congdon doesn't see her characters as vicious. They're simply going for the 
gold of self-realization, as recommended by the '60s and '70s. But actress 
McMurtrey, at the center of the play, sees that it doesn't help to blame Abbie 
Hoffman or Ronald Reagan or Dr. Ruth for getting us into this mess. As her 
mother says, nobody's minding the store any more. We have to make our own moral 
selections. 
</P>
<P>
McMurtrey doesn't put this realization into words. It's not that kind of play. 
But she does make a journey, with the help of co-directors Lee Shallat and 
Kristoffer Siegel-Tabori, and this helps to unify a play that is too honest to 
propose any univocal explanation for the confusions of the day, or any instant 
remedy for them. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe "instant" is part of the problem. By constructing the play in bits and 
pieces, Congdon gives us a slight case of information anxiety, surely one of 
the symptoms of the age. By going with the flow, she has created a play that 
stays on track. We have beheld her aliens and, lo, they are us.

FOLK FILMS: DEPENDING ON WHAT LES BLANK FILM IS PLAYING, COUNT ON THE AROMA OF 
GARLIC OR RED BEANS AND RICE. FOR THIS ARTIST, AND HIS AUDIENCE, OLFACTORY 
NERVES PLAY A BIG PART.

Walk into most movie theaters and the smell of popcorn usually fills the air. 
But walk into a theater where a Les Blank film is showing and you're liable to 
have your olfactory nerve responding to the distinct scent of garlic or the 
aroma of red beans and rice, depending on what film is playing. 
</P>
<P>
It's all part of experiencing the quirky work of Blank, known for his "folk 
films" that explore regional music and film. 
</P>
<P>
Blank's latest film, "I Went to the Dance," kicks off a retrospective of his 
work beginning Wednesday at the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art. After the 
screening, the audience will be served gumbo, in keeping with the film's topic 
-- Cajun and zydeco music. The recipe, supplied by Cajun musician Marc Savoy, 
will be prepared by chefs from Vic's in La Jolla. The ingredients are right 
from the source -- Blank was in Louisiana last weekend and brought back the 
spicy supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"This started when I was shooting 'Spend It All' and not knowing what to shoot, 
so I shot some footage of people cooking," Blank said. "Then, during editing 
and screening sessions, I started cooking at my studio. That allowed me to lure 
people over to give me feedback." 
</P>
<P>
That led to food actually being prepared and served at public screenings, as 
with "Garlic Is as Good as Ten Mothers" (an experience Blank calls 
"aroma-round"), and "Always for Pleasure" (known as "smell-around"). 
</P>
<P>
In "Garlic" -- much of it shot at the garlic festival in Gilroy -- whole heads 
of the plant were roasted in toaster ovens in the theater, while in "Pleasure" 
-- about Mardi Gras in New Orleans -- red beans and rice were cooked outside 
the theater and brought in at the precise moment they are being served during a 
scene in the film. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Blank's work over the past 20 years has focused on the music and food 
of Louisiana. For his latest film, he returns to the swampy locales seen in 
prior films such as "Spend It All" (1971) and "Dry Wood" (1973) -- both about 
Cajun music -- and "Hot Pepper" (1973) about zydeco. 
</P>
<P>
"I Went to the Dance" is billed as "the definitive history of Cajun and Creole 
music in Louisiana" -- an 84-minute piece that includes performances by a 
virtual Who's Who of the genres: old-timers such as the late Clifton Chenier 
and the Balfa Brothers and relative newcomers such as Rockin' Sidney and Savoy. 
</P>
<P>
The film was completed earlier this year and had its official premiere at the 
Montreal and Telluride film festivals. It opened theatrically in San Fransciso 
recently and 
</P>
<P>
grossed $23,000 in the first eight days -- a disaster by Hollywood standards, 
but an impressive showing for an independent documentary. 
</P>
<P>
"It's longer than my previous films on the subject," said Blank, who is 
spending a year as "Distinguished Filmmaker in Residence" at UCSD. "It's a 
feature-length film and more linear than the others. It proceeds through the 
history of Cajun music and Creole people from Africa. It's treated as a 
definitive study of the whole subject without being overly laborious. It's 
education that's entertaining." 
</P>
<P>
Blank, a native of Tampa, got his first taste of Louisiana culture while 
attending Tulane University. He moved to Los Angeles in the early '60s and 
attended USC's film school with the intention of becoming a big-time movie 
director but soon found himself drawn to a more personal form of film making. 
</P>
<P>
With his quiet, unassuming manner, Blank makes unobtrusive, loving films that 
are essentially celebrations of their subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 All screenings begin at 7:30 p.m. Admission is $2 for museum members, $3 for 
others, except for Wednesday's premiere when tickets are $4 for members, $5 for 
others. The lineup for the La Jolla retrospective is as follows:

PUCCINI'S RARE 'SWALLOW' FLUTTERS IN LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Magda, the all-too worldly heroine with the voice of silver and heart of gold, 
is serving tea to her young lover, Ruggero, at their rented villa near Nice. 
The time is 1865. The season is spring. One can hear swallows. One can see the 
distant ocean through a grove of olive trees. The joy of sensuality is in the 
air. Also the pain of renunciation. 
</P>
<P>
This is supposed to be the opening scene of the third act of Puccini's 
sublimely kitschy, seldom-performed "La Rondine." The title translates as "The 
Swallow." 
</P>
<P>
It is a lovely little tear-jerker embellished with lilting waltz fragments, 
shimmering flights of lyric expansion and fine operatic passion. The work 
began, in 1914, as a mock-Viennese operetta and ended up, at its Monte Carlo 
premiere three fateful years later, as a fragile verismo exercise. 
</P>
<P>
The enterprising Long Beach Opera had its trendy way with "La Rondine" on 
Sunday. As usual, the producers couldn't, or wouldn't, leave sweet enough 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
Take that scene in the last act. At the Center Theater, Magda and her friend 
inhabit a black marble mausoleum. Maybe it is a bathhouse. 
</P>
<P>
The nostalgic soprano gushes onward and upward about "l'amor, l'amor, l'amor" 
while the nearly naked tenor languishes in a hot tub. He tries valiantly to 
look casual. Modesty -- or is it her traditional prima-donna physique? -- 
requires the heroine to keep on her billowy sari. However, she does muster a 
lot of awkward lolling and rolling, solo and in duet, on the cold, wet floor. 
</P>
<P>
This is all very, very modern. Also very silly. 
</P>
<P>
Hugo de Ana, the designing director imported from Argentina, forces the action 
forward to some vague period after World War I. Magda becomes a flapper. Except 
for scarlet blossoms that are strewn by the chorus about the stately stage 
during the celebrated second-act concertato, the favored color scheme is black 
on black. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of what becomes a performance within a performance -- that 
cliche again -- the bleak set is invaded by a rowdy camera crew. Apparently, we 
are watching the filming of a silent movie. 
</P>
<P>
Don't ask why. Either De Ana purposely abandons this little conceit after 10 
minutes, or it just slips his mind. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the interpretive innovations are not particularly offensive. Some 
touches are even stylish and amusing. Much of the direction is chronically 
slick, however, and it tells us nothing helpful about the essential tone and 
the substance of Puccini's pathos. 
</P>
<P>
Most damaging is the shift in periods. The tragedy of Magda lies in a conflict 
between her personal morality and that of a confining society. She is made to 
forswear pure love because of a shady past (she was, horror of horrors, a rich 
man's mistress). That may have made sense during the Second Empire. It hardly 
rings true in the Terrible Twenties. 
</P>
<P>
"La Rondine" is an unabashedly old-fashioned creation. It really needs a 
traditional proscenium and the customary theatrical distances to accommodate 
its cozy once-upon-a-time conventions. Those conventions did not find a 
congenial home at the Long Beach Opera -- with its glaringly intimate ambience, 
its potentially awkward thrust stage and dogged commitment to dramatic 
reassessment. 
</P>
<P>
The casting of the title role aggravated the problem. Rosa Vento commands a 
gleaming, tremendously promising spinto soprano that impresses even when she 
sings too loud or doesn't quite ascend to the proper pitch (the final 
pianissimo sigh was a case in point). Unfortunately, she tends to rely on 
histrionic generalities, and, hampered additionally by De Ana's unflattering 
costumes, she could do little here to foster the desired romantic illusion. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Austin Kelly as the sappy Ruggero looked very innocent, even in his bikini 
skivvies. Apart from a few stressful moments, he sang with nice tenorial ardor. 
</P>
<P>
The less lofty lovers offered more strain than charm. Sunny Joy Langton turned 
Lisette into a strident soubrette. Rodney Nolan solved the poetic problems of 
Prunier in terms of buffo lyricism. David Myrvold grumbled sourly as Magda's 
sugar daddy. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing Randall Behr (drafted as a stand-by maestro by the San Francisco 
Opera), Michael Recchiuti conducted with considerable flair and obvious 
sympathy. The stationing of the modest little orchestra upstage, behind a 
scrim, created the usual communication problems, television monitors 
notwithstanding, and one could have wished for a bit more lustrous string tone. 
Still, this was an auspicious debut under trying conditions. 
</P>
<P>
The opera, incidentally, was sung in Robert Hess' functional English 
translation. One actually could follow the plot without the distracting benefit 
of supertitles. That was a pleasure.

Sotheby's May Televise Auction Action: Meanwhile, in London, Sotheby's auction 
house is considering televising its sales live to the United States, which 
would give armchair connoisseurs a chance to bid on a yacht, an Old Master or a 
thoroughbred horse without leaving home. Sotheby's said Monday that if the 
response from its top clients is strong, it will begin televising London sales 
to subscribers in the United States via cable and satellite next year. 
Sotheby's will invite 2,000 top clients to subscribe to the service at a cost 
of about $195 a month. If the idea takes off, transmission of live sales in New 
York and Hong Kong will follow. Subscribers would receive three pieces of 
equipment -- a windowsill satellite dish to receive Sotheby's signal, a 
receiver to unscramble it and a touchpad to make bids. ALEENE MacMINN

Check Out This Art Auction: A plan to sell off part of Czechoslovakia's state 
art collections through Christie's auction house has provoked concern that the 
nation's cultural legacy may be liquidated for badly needed hard currency. The 
controversial sale, which Christie's hopes to hold at its London sales rooms 
next fall, came to light in a recent issue of the Communist Party cultural 
weekly Kmen. Six museums, including the National Gallery and the State Jewish 
Museum, are drawing up as yet undisclosed lists of items for auction after 
Christie's proposed the sale, to be managed through an official Czechoslovak 
body known as Art Centrum. However, the Prague Museum of Applied Arts, 
containing valuable pieces of Bohemian glassware and furniture, has refused to 
take part, deeming the proposal "wrong in its very essence." According to a 
draft agreement with Christie's, Art Centrum has suggested selling "excess 
items and damaged exhibits" so museums could obtain currency to fill in gaps in 
existing collections or to improve security and storage facilities. ALEENE

nominees -- James Woods and Melanie Griffith -- to star in Ernest Hemingway's 
"Hills Like White Elephants." The Hemingway story, about an American expatriate 
couple facing the end of their long affair, is the first film in an HBO 
trilogy, "Men and Women." Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne will adapt the 
story and Tony Richardson will direct the David Brown production. The trilogy, 
which also includes stories by Dorothy Parker ("Dusk Before Fireworks") and 
Mary McCarthy ("The Man in the Brooks Brothers Shirt") will premiere on HBO 
next summer. ALEENE MacMINN

PRODUCER BUCKS TREND TOWARD FAST-PACE SHOWS; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: KCET'S NANCY SALTER FAVORS A PERSONAL, INTIMATE APPROACH TO 
DOCUMENTARIES. HER LATEST, 'LIVING THE LAST DAYS,' TOOK NINE MONTHS TO MAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Think of Nancy Salter's work as the opposite of "48 Hours." 
</P>
<P>
Salter, 44, has been producing documentaries for Los Angeles public-TV station 
KCET for 20 years -- at her own distinct pace. While CBS' "48 Hours" careens 
through a news story in just two days, Salter's probing one-hour documentaries 
might take as many as 26,280 hours (that's three years, and not such a catchy 
title) -- though the average production time is closer to nine months. 
</P>
<P>
Salter's programs, which have netted seven local Emmys, shun the hard-hitting 
investigative approach of a "48 Hours" or a "60 Minutes" -- as well as the high 
drama of today's new crop of "reality" shows, such as "Unsolved Mysteries" and 
"America's Most Wanted." She favors a highly personal, intimate style of 
documentary making. 
</P>
<P>
Achieving that level of intimacy, Salter says, takes lots of time and plenty of 
videotape. 
</P>
<P>
Salter spent three years following several infertile couples determined to 
conceive a child for a 1988 documentary called "Expecting Miracles." In 1983, 
she spent months gaining the trust of several Los Angeles-area families who 
eventually talked freely to her camera about family violence and incest in 
"Generations of Violence." 
</P>
<P>
Salter's newest documentary, "Living the Last Days," which airs at 8 p.m. 
Wednesday on Channel 28, focuses on another touching local story -- that of 
Brownlie Hospice, located near Elysian Park, one of the first hospices for 
people dying of complications from AIDS. It was nine months in the making. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Kulczycki, KCET's senior vice president and station manager, 
acknowledges that Salter's approach is expensive. She shoots an average of 60 
hours of tape per documentary. Not only does it take time to shoot the material 
-- it can take as long or even longer to edit it down to an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Kulczycki believes the extra time and money are worth it, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Nancy's got a gift for making powerful documentaries about how people live and 
the choices they make," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's important to apply resources to opening up some large questions, 
and looking at the human effects and implications," Kulczycki continues. 
"Nancy's gift is that she is able to get people to talk to her." 
</P>
<P>
Salter says she has stayed at KCET all these years both because the station 
tolerates her pace and to avoid the cruel world of fund-raising, the bane of 
independent documentary makers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the style that I like to do things in; it's just kind of worked out 
for me to do it here," she says simply. "It's not as though anyone has ever 
said, 'We like how long it takes this woman to do these programs.' " 
</P>
<P>
An unassuming woman who seems virtually untouched by pop culture, Salter pays 
little attention to network documentaries (the only network show she says she 
watches regularly is CBS' "Falcon Crest"). Despite her bevy of Emmys, she says 
she has had no offers to work on network news shows or reality shows. Nor, she 
supposes, would she want to. 
</P>
<P>
"In all that 'reality' stuff now, people are staging a lot of it, all the 
re-enactments," she says. "I really like to get the actual thing happening. 
What I like is when we're there and the camera is actually rolling and 
something wonderful happens." 
</P>
<P>
By "wonderful," Salter means "real" -- something unfolding on camera, rather 
than being described by a talking head. A scene from "Living the Last Days," 
for example, casts an unexpected light on a resident's death: The patient wants 
to die; staff members surround his bed, holding his hand, assuring him that 
death will come soon. The end of his life becomes bittersweet rather than 
merely tragic. 
</P>
<P>
Salter has also grown weary of the investigative style. "When you're working on 
news and public-affairs kinds of series, it's very much designed by a committee 
of people. They're still, in a way, fitting into a formula. As time goes on, 
the stories tend to repeat themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Salter tries to avoid tension between herself and her subjects by staying 
off-camera, often avoiding the use of a narrator to allow those involved to 
tell their own stories. Still, sometimes her subjects insist on creating 
friction. When producing "Expecting Miracles," for example, some of her 
subjects resented the fact that Salter has children. At Brownlie Hospice, one 
staff member at first told her she had no right to try to capture the feelings 
of the residents because Salter was not herself HIV positive. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such concerns, Salter says that no one, including the terminally ill 
residents at Brownlie, has ever asked her to turn off the camera once they had 
agreed to participate.

A NEW DAWN FOR DAY-LEWIS; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: PORTRAYING DISABLED IRISH PAINTER AND WRITER CHRISTY BROWN IN 'MY LEFT 
FOOT' HAS PROVEN TO BE HIS MOST DIFFICULT ROLE. BUT IT HAS PROVIDED HIM WITH A 
STAR TURN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's hard to imagine a more unglamorous movie role than the one of Christy 
Brown, the late Irish writer and painter whose muscles were so affected by 
cerebral palsy that he could barely speak or move without great physical 
effort, sometimes accompanied by spasms, grunts and spitting. 
</P>
<P>
In a profession where actors so often are heard to anguish over whether a 
certain part will spoil their image, Daniel Day-Lewis, who plays Christy Brown 
in the new film "My Left Foot," has shredded the wisdom of Hollywood. In his 
short but already notable career, Day-Lewis has been seen on the big screen as 
the upper-class Edwardian twit in "A Room With a View," a homosexual London 
punk in "My Beautiful Laundrette" and a sensual Czech surgeon in "The 
Unbearable Lightness of Being." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, surely this was the most difficult assignment to date for the 32-year-old 
Old Vic graduate whose technical virtuosity has been matched by an equal 
passion to avoid easy answers to anything. When the question was put to him 
over tea at the Carlyle Hotel in midtown Manhattan, Day-Lewis said: "Everything 
seems to be difficult to me. Everything really seems impossible. And then you 
do it. I guess it was. I mean, I don't know really. I'm sure everyone will 
assume it was. I suppose it must have been." 
</P>
<P>
Then comes a smile, an indication that this grappling for truth, at least over 
tea, is not an occasion for suffering. There is always time for that later. 
Day-Lewis, the son of Britain's former Poet Laureate C. Day Lewis and actress 
Jill Balcon, is not the sort of public man who tries to make you believe that 
he has the world figured out. Nor has he been the kind of actor who shifts 
effortlessly into the self-promotion gear. On this visit to New York from 
London to help get the word out about "My Left Foot," he was in high spirits, 
unstudied and at ease even as he questioned what it is he's doing. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously with something like this, it's not an easy film to encourage people 
to go and see. The awful truth is that half of me doesn't want them to see it." 
</P>
<P>
Really? 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's perversity, but I can't be so pretentious as to think that it will 
carry with it some great meaning for a great number of people. I don't want to 
be a salesman because it would be so much against the spirit in which the film 
was made." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it is easy for an actor to say such things when the early reviews have 
been suitable for framing. In any case, Day-Lewis will never be taken for a 
salesman. In the Carlyle lobby, he looked pleasantly unkempt, like a wiry Irish 
cowboy in jeans and blue-denim shirt with a red bandanna around his neck and a 
mop of black hair at outlaw length. 
</P>
<P>
"We set about making the film not knowing really whether it was possible or 
not," he said, referring to writer-director Jim Sheridan, who brought him the 
script, "but with a huge desire to take it on. Perhaps more importantly, a lack 
of anxiety over the fact that it might be impossible. Neither of us actually 
cared about that. Which is desperately important in making films, which so 
often tend to be weighed down with expectations imposed by outside influences." 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan, who grew up in the same working-class Dublin known to Christy Brown, 
had worked as a playwright and director in Dublin and New York but had never 
made a movie before. That didn't bother Day-Lewis after he read the screenplay 
Sheridan wrote with Shane Connaughton. 
</P>
<P>
"The script itself is a very powerful piece of writing. Very few scripts I've 
read exist in their own right as beautiful pieces of work. But that was." 
</P>
<P>
Before filming, Day-Lewis was able to spend almost three months in Ireland 
learning about Christy Brown from those who knew him, as well as studying the 
effects of cerebral palsy, a neurological disease that interferes with muscular 
control, including speech. 
</P>
<P>
Once filming started, he insisted on remaining in character off camera as much 
as possible, even continuing to speak in the halting drawl of someone whose 
facial muscles don't work properly. He restricted himself to a wheelchair, was 
lifted in and out of cars and was fed by others. He said the experience was 
invaluable for the role, although what he learned was not pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the most obvious thing to say is the incessant rage you feel being 
beholden to other people, about the lack of consideration of other people, the 
huge lack of sensitivity. It's strange what happens, regardless of the conceit, 
even though everybody knew who I was and what I was doing. When people see 
someone in a wheelchair, their attitudes change. People's voices change, they 
start treating you like a child. 
</P>
<P>
The film reflects many of the new attitudes toward disability brought about in 
the last 10 years by disabled civil-rights activists -- that Christy Brown is 
not so much a victim of his disease as of the societal prejudices that bar him 
from a normal life, including an active sex life, until he breaks down the 
prejudice with the combined force of his talent and corrosive personality. 
</P>
<P>
In the person of Day-Lewis, Brown is shown to be an abrasive, often difficult 
character who commonly insulted people, started fights and was not easy to 
love, except for his mother (played by Brenda Fricker) who stood by him always. 
</P>
<P>
"Christy's thing was to force people into an open confrontation as if to say, 
'This is how I am. I can be dangerous. I can be drunk. I can fight with the 
best people.' He just insisted on that confrontation," Day-Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Born into a big, poor Irish family in 1932, Brown was assumed to be mentally 
incompetent until one day, at the age of 9, he was able to clutch a piece of 
chalk between the toes of his left foot and write the word mother on the stone 
floor. His left foot was the only part of his anatomy that he could control. 
</P>
<P>
As he learned to control it more deftly, he became a commercially successful 
painter, then a writer, breaking into print with "My Left Foot," his 
autobiography, followed by "Down All the Days" and other books. He died in 1981 
at 49, after choking on a piece of food at dinner. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Down All the Days' was probably his greatest work," DayLewis said, "and I 
think the film is closer in spirit to (it). 'My Left Foot' was a very nice 
book, a very simply written book but almost sanitized for public consumption. 
Then came this sort of volcanic torrent of rage and anguish in 'Down All the 
Days' and that was really the sound of his true voice for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
The film spans much of Brown's life (with a younger actor, Hugh O'Conor, 
playing the boyhood scenes) showing many of the battles he fought to be 
accepted and some of the bitter setbacks he endured. One of his lowest moments 
comes during a restaurant scene in which he learns that his love for a woman 
doctor is unrequited, and he responds by pulling a tablecloth and its contents 
to the floor with his teeth. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked Jim to set it up so that we could do the whole scene in one shot," 
Day-Lewis said. "I had a sense of what was going to happen, but I didn't know 
exactly. I said I didn't want to rehearse or discuss the scene, and I think I 
created an incredibly unpleasant atmosphere in the room before we began to 
shoot it because I was filled with a sense of foreboding about it. And I think 
little by little, it just began to get to people." 
</P>
<P>
When he was preparing for the movie, which was made for about $2 million in 
Ireland, Day-Lewis heard from a number of disabled people, including some 
actors, who were "apprehensive," he said, about his playing the part. 
</P>
<P>
"Some were very angry about it. It's something we discussed a lot. There's 
nothing that I can do about it." 
</P>
<P>
The reaction to the film from the disabled community in Britain and Ireland, 
where the film opened last summer, "seemed to be good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very complicated. To some people, the film will encourage the belief that 
everything worked out fine for Christy Brown, that people might think (disabled 
persons) don't need our consideration after all. He had a tough life, he 
survived, he had a great spirit and, you know, he got the girl in the end. 
There is a great danger in that, and at the same time, it's a true story." 
</P>
<P>
Finishing his pot of mint tea, he said he had no immediate plans. "The thing 
about 'Hamlet' is that I had to take stock of things a bit when that happened. 
I've just been drifting a little." 
</P>
<P>
He will go back to London, where he lives simply in "an empty house" he bought 
not long ago. Possibly, he will get on a motorcycle and just travel across the 
countryside, which is one of the things he likes to do when he's not getting 
into somebody else's skin. 
</P>
<P>
Although he grew up in a house full of books and under the nose of the nation's 
poet laureate, he says he never felt any pressure to be a writer. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite the opposite. I mean, I was aware of the family name and what it meant 
and I wanted in some way to be able to contribute to that name. I was quite 
proud of it. But it never occurred to me to write." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Day-Lewis gravitated to his mother's side of the family, without her 
encouragement. "Not that she discouraged me, but she'd have loved it if I'd 
become an electrician, I'm sure. Or anything but an actor."

Tri-Star took the top spots in the box office for the second weekend in a row 
with two major success stories. The John Travolta comedy "Look Who's Talking" 
grossed $11.4 million for a per-screen average of $6,953. The fall 
record-breaker has totalled $74.3 million in only five weeks of release and is 
already the third highest-grossing fall film behind 1986's "Crocodile Dundee" 
and 1987's "Fatal Attraction." Meanwhile, director Jean-Jacques Annaud's 
adventure film "The Bear" fell just 5%, grossing $4.8 million. Universal's 
"Dad," starring Jack Lemmon, expanded from 107 to 1,108 screens and finished 
third in the box office at $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
* Samuel Goldwyn's "Henry V" grossed a smash $78,025 in only three theaters -- 
in Los Angeles, New York and Toronto. The retelling of Shakespeare's classic 
story by British theatrical wunderkind Kenneth Branagh averaged $26,008 per 
screen.

POP CAPSULES: HINOJOSA: NOT JUST ANY SWEETHEART OF THE RODEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tish Hinojosa has a honey of a smooth, country-croonin' voice, and at McCabe's 
on Friday, this sweet Texan indulged in homespun "cowboy romanticism" in such 
songs as "It's the Way of Life in the Real West" and "Voice of the Big Guitar." 
A real dude-ranch dream, right? 
</P>
<P>
But Hinojosa isn't just any old sweetheart of the radio. There is an 
unavoidable dollop of what some would consider political correctness in her 
music too, and her frequent bilingual excursions, celebrations of border 
crossings by the Latino hopeful, and between-song references to heroes like 
Jesse Jackson might land her in trouble in a few honky-tonks back home. There 
are more undercover illegal immigrants than little dogies being driven in 
lovely songs like "Border Trilogy," from her "Homeland" album, which doesn't 
just mix American country and Mexican music styles, but makes the real 
connection between them clear. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who might enjoy a less theatrical Linda Ronstadt or a folkier Rosie 
Flores would no doubt be delighted by her 3-to-1 ratio of English to Spanish 
songs: some traditional Mexican ballads, some honky-tonk, some pop. Hinojosa 
herself is a real -- como se dice en espanol? -- border-crosser. CHRIS WILLMAN

DANNEMEYER SCOLDS OFFSHORE DRILLING FOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If the oil industry is to win a public relations war with environmental 
"grass-eaters and daisy-pickers," it must persuade average Americans that 
offshore drilling creates jobs and promotes energy independence, Rep. William 
E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) said in a weekend speech. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the environmentalists, Dannemeyer said: "These Good Neighbor 
'Scams' are the same ones (who) lock up the California coastline to further 
development only after they have ensured their own beachfront properties. The 
average citizen will understand this hypocrisy and will most likely tell these 
'eco-nuts' to get a real job." 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer made the remarks Saturday in San Francisco to the board of directors 
of the National Ocean Industries Assn., a trade group that represents about 330 
firms directly and indirectly engaged in offshore drilling. A copy of 
Dannemeyer's remarks was released Monday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The conservative congressman was one of four members of a panel that discussed 
the role that offshore oil drilling should play in the nation's energy policy. 
Other members included California Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), a critic of 
offshore drilling, and representatives of Chevron Corp. and the Natural 
Resources Defense Council, a major environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
Congress earlier this year put a moratorium on offshore drilling along much of 
the nation's coast, including off Orange County and most of Southern 
California. It is scheduled to remain in effect until next October at least. 
Since 1981, Congress has annually imposed drilling moratoriums along the 
northern and southern coasts of California. 
</P>
<P>
A Cabinet-level task force in January is scheduled to recommend to President 
Bush whether to proceed with plans to grant drilling leases at three sites off 
the coasts of Florida and California, including one tract off Orange County. 
Shell Oil Corp. and Unocal currently operate four deep-water drilling platforms 
in federal waters between nine and 12 miles off the county's coast. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime advocate of drilling for oil in the outer continental shelf, 
Dannemeyer told the trade association board that the environmental movement has 
successfully made its case against drilling by mounting a massive campaign of 
fund raising, advertising and lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Dannemeyer said, the ecological dangers posed by offshore drilling 
platforms are minimal. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a well-financed, active army of environmental grass-roots driven by a 
deeply embedded ideology vs. an under-utilized sleeping army of consumers, (oil 
industry) employees and oil businesses," Dannemeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is time for the industry to go on the offensive and take (its) case to the 
people. The average citizen must be told that while he must suffer the 
consequences of energy dependence and oil shortages, the grass-eaters and 
daisy-pickers who created these political dilemmas will always make sure their 
cars start in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
But Laguna Beach Mayor Robert F. Gentry, a longtime opponent of offshore oil 
drilling, accused Dannemeyer of "grossly underestimating" the potential impact 
of oil drilling off Southern California. He added that the congressman refuses 
to listen to warnings from federal experts, including what he said were U.S. 
Department of the Interior predictions of a "75% chance of a 1,000-barrel or 
more oil spill" in the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
"The federal government is telling us there is risk," Gentry said. "So why 
doesn't Mr. Dannemeyer know that?" 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach City Councilwoman Evelyn R. Hart, another offshore oil drilling 
opponent, said the "risks are too great" to allow exploration and production of 
oil along Orange County's 42-mile coastline. The greatest impact, she said, 
would be on the region's already polluted skies. Studies have shown that the 
diesel-powered platforms would release large amounts of nitrogen oxides and 
particulates. 
</P>
<P>
"The quantity and quality of oil off Orange County's coast is just not worth 
the adverse impact that would result," Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
David B. Goldstein, a senior staff scientist with the Natural Resources Defense 
Council, said Monday that he told the drillers that the least expensive and 
most efficient way to reduce dependence on foreign oil is through conservation, 
not offshore drilling. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Goldstein said, improving the energy efficiency of household 
refrigerators would, over the next 23 years, save an estimated 1.5 billion 
barrels of oil. The cost of saving that much oil is far less than pumping an 
equivalent amount from reserves in the outer continental shelf, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, chairman of the House Interior Committee's subcommittee on water, power 
and offshore energy, generally agreed with Goldstein. For example, Miller said, 
imposition of a gasoline mileage standard of 40 miles per gallon on the highway 
and 30 in the city would save 7.5 billion barrels of oil over the next 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"If the oil industry were up on the Hill lobbying to raise mileage standards, 
their arguments that (outer continental shelf) development is important to our 
national energy posture would have more credibility," Miller said in remarks 
prepared for the Saturday meeting.

ONLY IN O.C.: The Irvine Co. didn't exactly get the results it expected when it 
defended its controversial Laguna Laurel project in big ads last weekend. . . . 
As thousands marched to protest the proposed development, the company urged 
readers to phone for its side of the story. . . . Instead, most of the 60 
people who called Monday didn't want a brochure -- they wanted to get on a 
waiting list for the houses. Steve Emmons and Dana Parsons

ABORTION: Pro-choicers demonstrated by the thousands Sunday, and now they're 
moving into South County to round up allies from an unlikely but potentially 
vote-rich source: Leisure World. . . . A Planned Parenthood auxiliary group has 
been established in the Laguna Hills retirement community -- the first such 
seniors group in the western United States, the organization says. . . . 
Pro-choicers, realizing that seniors are much more likely to vote than others, 
note that Leisure World has about 21,500 residents. Steve Emmons and Dana

DENG TELLS VISITORS IT'S ALL OVER, BIDS GOODBY TO POLITICAL CAREER 
</P>

Senior leader Deng Xiaoping told a visiting Japanese delegation Monday that it 
was the last group of foreign visitors he will meet in his decade-old role as 
China's top leader. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to take this opportunity to formally say goodby to my political 
career," Deng told the Japanese business group, according to the official New 
China News Agency. "You are the last group of respected guests I will meet. 
Retirement must be genuine so that new leaders will not feel embarrassment in 
their work." 
</P>
<P>
Deng, 85, formally retired Thursday from chairmanship of the Communist Party's 
Central Military Commission, his last party post. Communist Party General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin, 63, was named to succeed Deng in the important military 
position, and Deng's comments Monday appeared to be a further attempt to boost 
Jiang's political power. 
</P>
<P>
"To practice genuine retirement, I will no longer meet visitors in the name of 
the collective, the party or the state," Deng told his guests. 
</P>
<P>
By virtue of his prestige and personal connections, Deng is widely expected to 
remain China's most powerful leader for as long as he is in reasonably good 
health. He also did not claim that he will no longer see foreigners under any 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
But Deng's statement Monday means that in meeting foreign dignitaries, he will 
no longer be the official top representative of the Chinese leadership. He also 
indicated that he will no longer greet foreigners at the Great Hall of the 
People. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be impolite if I refrain from meeting some old friends when they visit 
China in the future," Deng said. "In that case, I can visit them at the place 
where they stay. We will chat about friendship and non-political affairs. . . . 
The party, government and army leaders should be given a free hand in their 
work, and I will not meddle in their affairs. This is essential for their 
growth and work." 
</P>
<P>
Deng was speaking to a 35-member Japanese mission led by Ryoichi Kawai of the 
Japan-China Economy and Trade Assn. The group, with representation from various 
business circles, is the most high-powered Japanese business delegation to 
visit China since martial-law troops were used to crush pro-democracy protests 
in Beijing in early June. 
</P>
<P>
Deng praised Jiang, an engineer and former Communist Party head in Shanghai who 
was named national party chief in late June, as a "very capable man." 
</P>
<P>
"As an intellectual, he is more knowledgeable than I," Deng said. "Of course, 
he is less experienced than I because he is only 63." 
</P>
<P>
Deng also offered a strong endorsement of China's year-old economic 
retrenchment program. This program, now officially scheduled to last for at 
least two more years, has been described by some foreign and Chinese analysts 
as an attack on Deng's policies of market-oriented reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, wire services quoted sources in Beijing as saying that the Communist 
Party Central Committee has formally ousted former party chief Zhao Ziyang from 
its ranks nearly six months after he was accused of supporting the student-led 
democracy movement.

Ahmed Khomeini, an outspoken radical and son of Iran's late supreme leader, the 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, was appointed Monday to the country's top defense 
and security policy-making body. 
</P>
<P>
Tehran Radio said Iran's spiritual leader, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, named 
Khomeini, 42, as one of his two personal representatives on the National 
Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first official post for Khomeini, a clergyman who built a reputation 
as his father's chief aide and personal secretary from the 1979 Islamic 
revolution to the elder Khomeini's death last June. 
</P>
<P>
Ahmed is looked upon by anti-Western radicals as a rallying symbol in the 
post-Khomeini era, being dominated by the more pragmatic President Hashemi 
Rafsanjani.

MISSION VIEJO COUNCIL SETS RECALL ELECTION

Petitions seeking the recall of City Councilman Robert A. Curtis contain more 
than 750 duplicate signatures, a number city officials found startling but not 
enough to cancel plans for a special election, which the council approved 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 3-0, with one abstention, to set the special election for 
Feb. 27. The ballot will include a proposal to require that all annexation 
measures involving more than 100 acres receive voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very startled by that, by the number of duplicates," Mayor William S. 
Craycraft said after Monday's vote. "If there's been any illegality, I 
certainly hope it will be investigated." 
</P>
<P>
Recall leaders denied any wrongdoing and said the duplicates were accidental. 
</P>
<P>
Craycraft was the lone council member to abstain from the special election 
vote. He said later that his abstention was "based on the fact that recall 
should be used only in a case of malfeasance of an officer, and I haven't seen 
that here." 
</P>
<P>
Curtis, who was not present during Monday's vote, has said he believes that the 
recall is an effort by local developers to punish him for his positions 
advocating slow growth for the city. Developers, most notably the Mission Viejo 
Co., are the largest contributors to the recall effort, which has raised more 
than $150,000 to unseat the councilman. 
</P>
<P>
Out of 12,026 signatures turned in on the petitions, 776 were found to be 
duplicates, according to a certificate presented to the council on Monday by 
City Clerk Ivy J. Zobel. All told, 4,066 signatures were invalidated, leaving 
7,960 valid signatures, 190 more than the 7,770 needed to force a special 
election. 
</P>
<P>
The recall campaign has come under investigation before, and the Orange County 
district attorney's office is reviewing petitions that were allegedly 
distributed by invalid circulators, people who were not legally registered to 
vote in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Zobel cautiously answered a series of questions from Craycraft during Monday's 
afternoon council session. Craycraft repeatedly asked whether she had found 
evidence of forgery among the petitions. 
</P>
<P>
"That wasn't what I was checking," Zobel answered. 
</P>
<P>
"Are there any forgeries that you are aware of?" Craycraft asked again. 
</P>
<P>
"None that I'm aware of," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Zobel said she had seen some signatures that "did not match" 
voter registration forms but added that she had found no evidence of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Monroe, chairwoman of the Coalition to Recall Councilman Curtis, said 
recall leaders discovered duplicate signatures as they reviewed the petitions 
before turning them in, but had left them because they wanted to turn in the 
raw petitions. 
</P>
<P>
"We would not touch those signatures," she said. "That would be tampering." 
</P>
<P>
Monroe could not explain the large number of duplicates but said she expected 
many people signing the petitions were approached more than once and agreed 
without thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"This can happen," she said. "As the people went door-to-door, they signed. And 
when they saw it at the supermarket, they signed again." 
</P>
<P>
City officials estimate that the election will cost about $40,000 and have 
budgeted $60,000.

ROLLING REMEDY FOR BIG ONE IS CHRISTENED BY PACIFIC BELL 
</P>

<P>
Pacific Bell on Monday christened a part of a $4-million "insurance policy" 
that company executives are gambling will keep phone lines open even if the Big 
One shakes Orange County to its foundation. 
</P>
<P>
A 48-foot-long tractor-trailer rig filled with banks of computers and digital 
phone equipment was officially rolled out by Pacific Bell officials, who touted 
the unit as a "potential lifesaver" in the event of a disaster such as a major 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The gleaming rig, nicknamed the Restoration Express, is the first 
self-contained phone center on wheels in the nation. American Telephone &amp; 
Telegraph Co., for which it was made, says it can handle calls from up to 8,000 
phone lines at once without relying on a centralized office. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a complete central office that can be moved within a matter of hours 
to almost any location and start operating. It is unique," said Jim Jevicky, 
Southern California account executive for AT&amp;T. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell, which serves about 800,000 county customers, has ordered a second 
mobile phone center, as well as a smaller unit that can be airlifted to remote 
locations. One of the large rigs will be based somewhere in Orange County, the 
other 18-wheeler in Los Angeles County. The three mobile units -- which cost 
$1.7 million each for the two large ones and $600,000 for the smaller one -- 
are viewed by company officials as one of the cornerstones of its evolving 
disaster preparations. 
</P>
<P>
During last month's devastating Northern California earthquake, Pacific Bell's 
telephone network escaped widespread problems. Although several of the 
company's Bay Area offices were damaged in the 7.1-intensity temblor, none of 
the key computer components or switching equipment was wrecked. 
</P>
<P>
Service to the company's 2.5 million Bay Area customers was never down -- only 
interrupted by the crush of calls from friends and relatives outside the 
region, Pacific Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
But Pacific Bell officials are quick to note that the Oct. 17 quake was not the 
long-predicted, much-feared Big One. 
</P>
<P>
Should a more powerful temblor strike in Southern California, particularly on 
the Newport-Inglewood Fault running along coastal Orange County, phone company 
officials think that some of their three dozen local phone centers could be 
closed by damage to structures or switching equipment. 
</P>
<P>
That could sever phone service to some communities for hours, even days. 
</P>
<P>
But with the new mobile phone centers, service could be restored within an hour 
or two, said R.A. (Bob) Kohn, district manager of customer services for Pacific 
Bell's southern division. The units could be transported to the scene of a 
disaster or could operate from several miles away. If the local power is out, 
the mobile units can run on batteries or a diesel generator. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our insurance policy that during an emergency we can still provide some 
basic level of service," said Kohn at Pacific Bell's Tustin office, where 
executives christened the tractor-trailer rig by breaking two champagne bottles 
filled with confetti across its front. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't guarantee we will restore phone service to everyone -- that's not 
possible," Kohn said. "But we can provide access to a phone for many people in 
an affected area, by maintaining public phone lines through Red Cross shelters 
and other disaster centers." 
</P>
<P>
A crew of four can operate the highly sophisticated hardware and computer 
software that makes up the guts of this rolling nerve center. It is equipped 
with 13,000 feet of copper and fiber-optic cable that can tap into existing 
phone lines at a Pacific Bell facility or splice into underground lines. 
</P>
<P>
The rigs are outfitted to service up to 5,000 phone lines but can be modified 
to handle 3,000 more lines, Kohn said. Service priority would be given to 
emergency providers: police, fire, civil defense, hospitals and the military. 
</P>
<P>
Advances in computers and digital hardware have allowed designers to fit all 
the switching equipment into one such rig. In the past, the ability to set up 
remote phone-switching operations has existed, but two or three tractor-trailer 
rigs were often needed and a linkup with an existing phone center to relay 
calls outside the area was always needed. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike its forerunners, the Restoration Express can make long-distance and 
overseas calls directly without routing calls through another office. 
</P>
<P>
The existence of the mobile center should help Pacific Bell avoid what happened 
to an Illinois phone company in May, 1988. About 35,000 Illinois Bell customers 
were without phone service for nearly a month after a fire in a switching 
station, which housed computerized equipment that connected local and 
long-distance calls. 
</P>
<P>
"With this unit, we could roll into place and get service back to some of those 
customers in the same day," Kohn said. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Pacific Bell services about 88% of the residential and 
business phone customers that General Telephone Co. serves in Fountain Valley, 
Huntington Beach, Laguna Beach, Huntington Beach, Seal Beach and Westminster. A 
spokeswoman for Pacific Bell said an arrangement is being worked out that would 
allow General Telephone to use the Pacific Bell mobile center in a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Kohn said the mobile units will be used as training centers until needed in a 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"At $1.7 million a piece," Kohn said dryly, "they are a little expensive just 
to park and lock up."

CLOSER COUNCIL TIES TO ADVISERS URGED

<P>
Communication is muddled between the City Council and its various advisory 
boards and commissions, a blue ribbon committee warned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Council members indicated they plan to appoint a committee to help solve the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
The blue-ribbon committee, which studied the situation for nine months, said 
Mayor Wes Bannister should meet regularly with each board, should hold 
quarterly round-table meetings with the leaders and should hold annual banquets 
to honor them all. 
</P>
<P>
Some board members "feel you're so far removed from them, you are the 
untouchables," committee member Noble Waite told the council. Waite was a 
councilman from 1958 to 1962. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also suggested eliminating the youth board, which it found 
largely ineffective. Council members agreed to study the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Advisory boards and commissions are designed to help guide the council on 
issues ranging from historic preservation to arts to transportation. After a 
January meeting at which council members agreed they were displeased with their 
relationship with these boards, Bannister called for the blue-ribbon committee, 
composed of former council members Ron Shenkman, Norma Gibbs, Waite and Ruth 
Finley. 
</P>
<P>
Another committee will be named to implement the recommendations by June. JOHN

ANTISERUM WORKING ON 3 SICK HORSES

<P>
An experimental antiserum given to three horses suffering an illness that has 
killed 18 horses in Southern California appears to be working, officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials also were encouraged that no new cases of the illness surfaced over 
the weekend at the Orange County Fairgrounds Equestrian Center, where the 
sickness was discovered on Oct. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Nine horses have died in Orange County, and botulism has been blamed. Officials 
believe that the toxin was in hay cubes manufactured in Utah and shipped late 
last month to at least 60 stables from Ventura to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
State officials have issued a recall of more than 850 tons of the cubes 
produced and distributed by Paramount Cubing, a Los Angeles County firm that 
denies that its product led to the deaths of any horses. The recall should be 
complete by the end of this week, said Stanley Buscombe, chief of feed and 
fertilizer for the state Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Operators of the equestrian center, where 260 horses are boarded, stopped using 
the hay cubes last Monday, switching to loosely baled alfalfa. The illness has 
a five- to seven-day incubation period, thus officials are optimistic that no 
more horses will be stricken. 
</P>
<P>
The conditions of three horses apparently have stabilized, possibly the result 
of the antiserum used to treat them since late last week. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Southern California, several other horses became ill over the 
weekend, but none has died. The illness strikes the equine's nervous system, 
apparently "short-circuiting" their nerve endings, causing their legs to quiver 
uncontrollably. STEVEN R. CHURM

BUSY BANK BANDIT STRIKES FOR 6TH TIME 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One of Orange County's most prolific bank robbers struck again Monday, racking 
up his sixth holdup in less than a month by robbing an Orange savings and loan 
association office, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
The latest holdup by the man called "the Tijuana bandit" came after four 
robberies on Friday committed by another bandit. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the flurry of robberies, however, the FBI's supervisory agent in Santa 
Ana said that his office finished the federal fiscal year Sept. 30 showing a 
reduction in the number of bank holdups -- 254 in the 1988-89 fiscal year, 
compared to 316 the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Agent Bucky Cox credited the formation of a team of FBI and local police, 
called the Bank Robbery Apprehension Team, and the start-up of a hot line for 
tipsters in Orange County (800-442-2244) as key factors. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest holdup at about 9:50 a.m. Monday, the armed robber showed a note 
demanding money to a teller at the American Savings branch at 111 Main St. in 
Orange, Cox said. He left with an undisclosed amount of cash. 
</P>
<P>
He has been dubbed the "Tijuana bandit" because of his habit of wearing a straw 
hat with "Tijuana" embroidered on it. But he switched to a white, Panama-style 
hat on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The robber wore sunglasses, a blue blazer and a white dress shirt. He was 
described as middle-aged with a brown-and-gray mustache, Cox said. He is 
believed responsible for five other bank robberies in Irvine, Tustin and Santa 
Ana since Oct. 26. 
</P>
<P>
A second robber hit four thrifts in quick succession Friday. Cox said that 
robber was being called "the Vet," because he struck on Veterans Day. 
</P>
<P>
The second bandit held up American Savings, 8231 La Palma Ave. in Buena Park; 
the Bank of California at 11900 Brookhurst Street in Garden Grove; Central 
Federal Savings at 10081 Valley View St. in Cypress, and Fullerton Savings, 
1201 E. 17th St. in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The man is described as being 25 to 30 years old, 6-foot-2 and slender. He wore 
jeans and a baseball cap over his light-brown, curly hair. CHRIS WOODYARD

COUNCIL TO CONSIDER DEVELOPER SWITCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Plans to switch developers of a proposed seniors apartment complex will be 
considered tonight in a joint session of the City Council and the Stanton 
Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
A new development agreement has been prepared by the city, and if approved, 
Beverly Hills-based Jan Development Co. will assume the responsibilities of the 
original developer, Newport Pacific Development Co., to build the 335-unit Park 
Stanton Seniors Apartment project at Beach Boulevard and Katella Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council approved the concept for the complex in January. The low-cost 
apartments were the first part of a three-phase, $61-million project that could 
eventually include a new City Hall, a recreation center and a large commercial 
development. 
</P>
<P>
The go-ahead for the first phase hinged on the issuance of a $17.75-million 
state housing bond to buy the land from the city and to pay Newport Pacific to 
build the complex, according to Greg Beaubien, assistant city manager. 
</P>
<P>
The state approved the bond in August, and the developer was given until Nov. 
17 to put together financing for the bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
When it appeared the financing might not materialize, Jan Development began 
negotiations with the city as an alternate developer, according to Beaubien. 
</P>
<P>
The new agreement with Jan Development is "essentially the same" as the 
agreement approved for Newport Pacific, said City Manager Terry Matz. PEGGY

FUNDING PLAN OKD FOR WIDENING BRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City and county officials have agreed to a funding plan for the widening of an 
old two-lane bridge over Trabuco Creek, which will allow Rancho Viejo Road to 
be expanded to four lanes. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan approved last week by the City Council, the county will 
contribute $1 million for design and construction of the bridge. San Juan 
Capistrano could contribute up to $600,000, according to a plan submitted by 
Public Works Director William D. Murphy, although the city's expenses are 
expected to be in the range of $135,000.

CLEANING UP COMMUNITY IS HIS GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Groups of teen-agers chat on the sidewalks and the warm smells of dinner 
cooking drift through the air at dusk in the Hoover-Wilson district in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
With children playing on the narrow strips of lawn, the scene seems peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
But come dark, many parents shoo their children inside because they say that 
the Hoover-Wilson area -- the 27 crowded, dilapidated apartment buildings on 
Wilson and Hoover streets west of Glassell -- isn't safe. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Hoover-Wilson say they see drug-dealing, prostitution and 
graffiti, but they don't move because the rent is low. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get somebody emptying a .38-caliber revolver in front of your bedroom 
window, you better call it a bad neighborhood," said George Popescu, who has 
lived in the area for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
Just across Glassell Street from Hoover-Wilson is another neighborhood, one 
where young middle-class families and retired couples live in neat houses with 
well-manicured lawns. 
</P>
<P>
Dore Teichman and his wife, Cindy, live there and they are angry about the 
situation across the street. Dore Teichman has spent the past two years trying 
to get the city to clean up Hoover-Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
He says he is tired of listening to gunshots and sirens, tired of seeing drug 
deals go down in the streets and graffiti scarring the walls. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he's moving, but he's not giving up the fight. 
</P>
<P>
Teichman plans to make a plea to the Orange City Council tonight: Do something 
about the Hoover-Wilson district. Now. 
</P>
<P>
Teichman said he will ask the City Council to declare the Hoover-Wilson area a 
blight and make its improvement a high priority; put a barrier between Glassell 
and the alley that runs between Hoover and Wilson; prohibit the construction of 
high-density apartment complexes; adopt a zero-tolerance policy against owners 
of buildings, fining them for any violations, and adopt the type of 
property-maintenance ordinance that Anaheim uses. 
</P>
<P>
If he doesn't get action, Teichman said, he plans to begin a recall effort 
against the mayor and possibly the other council members. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a step that I take lightly, and it's not a step that I'm real proud 
of, but I don't know what else to do," Teichman said. 
</P>
<P>
But others suggest that patience is required. 
</P>
<P>
"An area like that takes years to deteriorate. You're not going to see it turn 
around overnight," code-enforcement officer Susan Tully said. 
</P>
<P>
She and other city officials say the city has been making an effort to clean up 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
The city has stepped up code enforcement and police enforcement in 
Hoover-Wilson and has formed a task force to deal with the problems, City 
Councilwoman Joanne Coontz said. 
</P>
<P>
Since police arrested 18 suspects on drug-related charges several weeks ago, 
residents concede that the streets have been a little quieter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still out there. We know it's there, but it's gotten better," said Marion 
Bacon, who manages six apartment buildings there. "I'm sure the word is out 
that there's undercover narcotics officers working the area." 
</P>
<P>
Tully said the city is preparing a case for prosecution against a property 
owner in the area whose buildings have severe structural problems. 
</P>
<P>
Bacon said many problems are caused by owners who don't want to maintain their 
properties. Her owner cooperates, she said, and makes whatever improvements she 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem is overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
"We see 10 to 15 people per unit sometimes," Tully said. "Some of the 
apartments have large closets, and we've found people sleeping in closets. In 
some, there's no furnitures, just bedrolls." SHANNON SANDS

YOUNG CITIES OFFER TIPS TO COUNTY'S NEWEST; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: DANA POINT AND MISSION VIEJO OFFICIALS ADVISE THEIR LAGUNA NIGUEL 
COUNTERPARTS TO HIRE A GOOD CITY MANAGER AND A GOOD CITY ATTORNEY -- AND TO 
'STAY IN TOUCH' WITH THE PEOPLE. 
</P>

<P>
What advice do you give a newborn city? 
</P>
<P>
Judy Curreri, who became Dana Point's first mayor when her community became a 
city about 11 months ago, said that "staying in touch" is among her prime 
recommendations for future council members in Laguna Niguel, which will become 
the county's 29th city Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"It becomes harder and harder, after you've become a city, for the council 
members to get out among the people and find out what they're saying and what 
they want," Curreri said. "But it's so important. I've even changed my 
grocery-shopping habits so I can see people. I shop two or three times a week 
now, just so I can run into more people." 
</P>
<P>
Curreri was among officials from Dana Point and Mission Viejo who, in 
interviews, provided pointers that could be useful to the new city. Mission 
Viejo became a new city in March, 1988; Dana Point's cityhood became effective 
Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a short transition time," Curreri said regarding Laguna Niguel, where 
voters approved cityhood in a landslide last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"In Dana Point," she said, "we had six months to make the change to cityhood, 
and we still found ourselves pretty rushed. So one of my recommendations to 
Laguna Niguel would be to make very good use of that transition time." 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo City Councilman Christian W. Keena said the main thing is to 
"pick a very good city manager and a very good city attorney, because they set 
the tone for your new city. 
</P>
<P>
"Those two individuals, and their experience and their knowledge of municipal 
government, will either be a hindrance or a help. So their selections become 
the two most important decisions a new city makes." 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo Mayor William S. Craycraft concurred: "We were extremely 
fortunate to have an experienced city manager who knew exactly what to do as 
far as recruiting staff and getting the city off the ground. That's crucial. 
It's of paramount importance to hire a top-notch city manager and hit the 
ground running." 
</P>
<P>
Craycraft also advised Laguna Niguel council members to "hire competent 
department heads" and "keep politicking out of city business." 
</P>
<P>
They should also be prepared for an avalanche of homework, he added: "I found 
it startling. There's a tremendous amount of data to review and digest." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel should also make it a priority "to retain control over future 
development and to preserve the charm and beauty of their unique community," 
Mission Viejo City Councilman Robert A. Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel council members should also determine as soon as possible the 
city's needs for sewers, roads, civic buildings, parks, schools and other 
infrastructure, based on future growth projections, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Along the same lines, Dana Point's assistant city manager, John Donlevy, 
advised: "The first thing they need to do is to get a financial consultant. The 
second thing would be to retain an engineering firm to take inventory of the 
streets, sidewalks and medians. . . . They'll also need to set up departments. 
They'll also have to start appointing commissions." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, he said, the new City Council will need to consult with the county 
over essential community services being provided by county government. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to have to get in and work really closely with the county right 
off the bat," Donlevy said. 
</P>
<P>
While talking recently with an employee of the Laguna Niguel Community Services 
District, which will become part of the new city government, Donlevy said he 
told her, "Look out, because here it comes," referring to the onslaught of 
new-city problems and decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the problems, all who were interviewed about their own recent cityhood 
experiences agreed that the effort is well worth it. 
</P>
<P>
Forming a city gets people in a community closer to their government, Mission 
Viejo's Keena said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still the best and most responsive to the needs," he said. "It gives the 
residents a way to communicate more closely with their local government. . . . 
It works."

UNITED WAY CONTRIBUTIONS LAG FOR FIFTH YEAR RUNNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials with United Way of Orange County said Monday that they fear that the 
charity will fail to meet its fund-raising goal -- for the fifth consecutive 
year -- if the rate of giving continues to lag at its current pace. 
</P>
<P>
Even though many employers are reporting increased levels of United Way giving 
this year, overall pledges are below the goal, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The agency has set a goal of $20.5 million this year, a 10% increase ever the 
1988 pledge total of $18.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
However, at midpoint of the fund-raising campaign, only an estimated 43% of the 
goal has been met, according to an agency report. 
</P>
<P>
"We've witnessed some reductions in the size of companies that have been 
traditional United Way campaign supporters," said campaign chairman Ronald L. 
Merriman, managing partner of Peat Marwick Main &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The United Way helps support 121 organizations in the county, including the 
Salvation Army, the American Cancer Society, the Red Cross and other health and 
welfare groups. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's primary means of support is through payroll deductions. Officials 
said that because of corporate belt-tightening, several companies have fewer 
employees from whom to solicit funds. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly hard hit have been computer, communications and aerospace firms, 
Merriman said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the pessimistic prediction, Merriman said that there has been no 
falloff among companies that traditionally support the agency and that other 
crises such as the Bay Area earthquake have not hindered fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
But this year's campaign carries the familiar baggage of past efforts. Despite 
increases in overall giving, the campaign has failed to meet its fund-raising 
goal in each of the last four years, falling about $600,000 short last year. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are concerned that county corporations still contribute far less per 
capita than in comparable areas. 
</P>
<P>
According to the 1988 Orange County Survey, residents gave just $8.34 per 
capita to charity last year -- a 30% decline from 1987 -- compared to a 
national average of $18.79. 
</P>
<P>
The United Way also does comparisons, grouping cities according to population 
and other factors. Of six similar areas -- Boston, Baltimore, San Diego, 
Atlanta and St. Louis -- Orange County ranks last in amount raised per capita. 
</P>
<P>
"It touches every organization if you have a community that doesn't give, and 
wae are not immune to that," Merriman said. "But we tend to forget that this is 
an area with a high cost of living, and that is played out in maybe not the 
same level of giving as other areas." 
</P>
<P>
The county has also gained notoriety of late for a less-than-accepting attitude 
toward programs aimed at helping the poor. 
</P>
<P>
However, community leaders said they are reluctant to attribute the United 
Way's woes to a charity backlash. 
</P>
<P>
"The United Way funds pretty established things, so I don't think they would 
suffer" from a backlash, said Jean Forbath, chairwoman of the Orange County 
Human Relations Commission and executive director of Share Our Selves, a Costa 
Mesa-based relief group. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, I think it is a reflection of our community becoming more 
self-centered and inward-looking," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Forbath also said many people may have doubts about the efficiency of 
charitable groups, believing that most of the money goes to overhead and not to 
the people who most need it. 
</P>
<P>
Fund-raising costs for the United Way are among the lowest of any charity, 
spokesman Jeff Rocke said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that 82 cents of every dollar raised goes directly to local agencies 
for services.

EVERETT CAN SHOOT FROM HIP AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: THE QUARTERBACK HAS FINALLY RECOVERED FROM HIS POINTER INJURY, SUFFERED 
THREE WEEKS AGO, WHICH WAS MORE SERIOUS THAN EVER DISCLOSED. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Everett's career took a New York Giant leap forward Sunday, painful as it 
was. History takes kindly to quarterbacks who work miracles on bum knees and 
bad backs, and now Everett can assume a proper place on the trainer's table. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out the hip pointer Everett suffered three weeks ago against New 
Orleans was more serious than ever disclosed and, more to the point(er), the 
Rams didn't want it known lest the injury be considered an excuse for Everett's 
sagging numbers and his team's skidding fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, no question about it," Coach John Robinson said Monday. "We tend to 
downplay injuries as much as we can, but I think his throwing motion was 
affected." 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, it's much more manly to mention injuries after wins than losses. 
Everett admitted Monday that the hip pointer, or deep bruise, may have 
subconsciously changed his hip rotation and thus, his throwing motion. Now, 
pass rushers such as Bruce Smith and Richard Dent can change your hip rotation 
in a hurry, too, but that's another story. 
</P>
<P>
Everett thinks the injury threw his whole body out of whack. He awoke Sunday 
morning with a painful and stiff back, probably a result of compensating for 
his hip, he guesses. 
</P>
<P>
In between series, Everett could be found doing Jane Fonda workout stretches on 
the sidelines, trying to work out the kinks. It didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
"At halftime, we had the meeting with him standing up and a guy massaging his 
back while we're talking offense," Robinson said. "But that's part of what that 
position is. It isn't just the stats, it's finding a way to play when things 
are crappy." 
</P>
<P>
Everett had both the statistics and the will, setting a Rams' record with 18 
consecutive completions in the 31-10 victory over the Giants. All told, Everett 
completed 23 of 33 passes for 295 yards and two touchdowns. Touching his toes 
would have posed more a problem. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson compared Everett's performance to one being played out in the 
immediate vicinity Sunday by Giants' quarterback Phil Simms, who was wearing a 
brace to protect a bad ankle. 
</P>
<P>
"He's out there with a metal sleeve on his leg, his team's going down the tubes 
and he's not playing very good," Robinson said. "But he is something else, I 
think, that guy Simms. I just love him. I think he's one of those guys. I think 
Jim, going through this period, gets more like Simms." 
</P>
<P>
Slowed by the bad ankle and battered by the Rams' pass rush, Simms still 
managed to complete 25 of 38 passes for 237 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd always point to Simms as a guy who keeps coming back," Robinson said. "A 
guy like Phil Simms, you'd better kill him, you'd better not just wound him." 
</P>
<P>
If you don't think the role of the Rams' running backs has changed, take a look 
at Sunday's numbers. The Rams didn't have a runner gain more than 45 yards, yet 
used the skills of four backs -- Greg Bell, Buford McGee, Robert Delpino and 
Cleveland Gary -- to combine for 138 yards rushing in 38 carries. That used to 
be a good day for one Ram, Eric Dickerson. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the four players also gained 128 receiving yards in 12 receptions. 
</P>
<P>
Variety will apparently be the spice of the Rams' offense for years to come. 
The Rams are already packaging their backs, using Delpino and McGee in split 
fullback sets on some downs. 
</P>
<P>
Gary, the first-round pick from Miami, made his most significant contribution 
against the Giants, leading Ram runners with 45 yards in eight carries. 
</P>
<P>
And running isn't even what Gary does best. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear to me," Robinson said, "that Cleveland Gary has to be in the game, 
because his skills as a receiver are outstanding." 
</P>
<P>
Delpino, a second-year man and fifth-round pick, is simply the Rams' most 
versatile player. Sunday, he gained 34 yards rushing and 70 yards receiving, 
while continuing to be impressive on special teams. 
</P>
<P>
Delpino played 26 downs of offense and 13 downs on special teams. 
</P>
<P>
The only back missing out on the fun is Gaston Green, who missed Sunday's game 
with a rib injury. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback LeRoy Irvin (ankle) dressed for Sunday's game but said he could have 
played only in a case of emergency. He should be ready for Sunday's game 
against Phoenix. . . . With linebackers Larry Kelm and Fred Strickland back in 
the lineup, the Rams were able to play 16 downs of Eagle defense. "And I 
thought we played it well," Coach John Robinson said. "The defense looked more 
like our defense of last year than any time this year." . . . The Rams are 
carrying only seven defensive backs at the moment, and are hoping to make it 
work until cornerback Alfred Jackson comes off injured reserve in two weeks. "I 
don't know what to do," Robinson said. "We have some sorting out to do." . . . 
Despite the recent slump, Robinson is satisfied how his team has fared against 
some of the league's top teams. "We've certainly played the best in the league, 
and most of them even," he said. "We've beaten the two teams (San Francisco and 
the Giants) with the two best records, which is an interesting thing." . . . 
Second-year man Mike Piel has done well since becoming the starter at right 
defensive end two weeks ago. Sunday, he had two sacks. "Piel has established 
himself as a solid player," Robinson said. "That's very pleasing to us." . . . 
The six rushing yards allowed by the Rams' defense Sunday was the second-fewest 
in team history. The Rams held the Chicago Bears to one yard rushing in a 1952 
game. . . . Greg Bell has 26 touchdowns since becoming a Ram in October 1987. 
Eric Dickerson holds the team's career touchdown mark with 58 from 1983-87.

Those huge sighs of relief you heard late Sunday afternoon were those of Rams 
fans and Coach John Robinson as the quarterback shook the slump which had 
bedeviled him over the last four weeks and reverted to his early-season form. 
With the offensive line providing optimum protection, the fourth-year pro 
completed 23 of 33 attempts -- including a club-record 18 in a row -- for 295 
yards and two touchdowns.

FOOTBALL: THE TITAN RUNNING BACK SETS THE NCAA RECORD FOR MOST RUSHING YARDS IN

Mike Pringle sat in the Cal State Fullerton training room Monday, tending to 
the aches left behind by another bruising performance. At hearing the news, he 
looked up, incredulous. 
</P>
<P>
"Really?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
Really. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle has a national rushing record. Again. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't the record. Indiana's Anthony Thompson saw to that Saturday, rushing 
for 377 yards to set the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division I 
single-game record, breaking the record of 357 that Pringle shared with 
Washington State's Rueben Mayes for one week. Or less than one week, depending 
on whether you count from the day he got the yardage or from the day he found 
out about it, after a five-yard statistician's error was corrected. 
</P>
<P>
Now Cal State Fullerton is happy to announce that -- barring any more of the 
unforeseen circumstances that the past week has seen -- Pringle will soon be 
immortalized in the NCAA record book under the heading, Most Yards Gained, Two 
Consecutive Games. 
</P>
<P>
He set the record Saturday by rushing for 269 yards against Cal State Long 
Beach. Combined with his 357 yards against New Mexico State, he had 626 in two 
games, breaking by one yard the record set last season by Oklahoma State's 
Barry Sanders, the Heisman Trophy winner. 
</P>
<P>
At the news of the record, Pringle shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
"They keep coming up with records I don't know about," he said. "I just wait 
till Monday now to find out what I did Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
This time, what he did Saturday was simply overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters missed it. Mel Franks, the sharp-eyed sports information director who 
caught the five-yard error, missed it. 
</P>
<P>
And Titan Coach Gene Murphy and his staff, who took the heat for not sending 
Pringle back in the game with a chance to break the record against New Mexico 
State? 
</P>
<P>
They caught it. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a record, and we went after it," deadpanned assistant coach Don Morel, 
who announced the record at Murphy's weekly luncheon Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, who has been bothered by the uproar over keeping Pringle on the 
sidelines, feigned indignation and turned on the sarcasm. 
</P>
<P>
"We want this Pringle incident in the paper," Murphy said. "We put him back in 
the game so he could get the record." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the coaching staff wasn't aware of the record during the game. But in 
revealing it on Monday, the coaches got the best of the local media -- on a tip 
from a Herald-Telephone reporter who noticed the record while researching 
Thompson's mark in Bloomington, Ind., and called Morel and offensive 
coordinator Bill Wentworth, who grew up in Bloomington. 
</P>
<P>
So as another game approaches, here is a synopsis of Pringle's record saga: 
</P>
<P>
The record could have been his, but Murphy kept him on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The record was his, but he would have to share it. 
</P>
<P>
The record was no longer his at all. 
</P>
<P>
But another record is. 
</P>
<P>
And next week? 
</P>
<P>
Pringle, who Monday was named the Big West Conference offensive player of the 
week for the fourth time this season, needs 181 yards against San Jose State to 
break the Fullerton and Big West single-season rushing record of 1,789 yards 
set by Obie Graves in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
He will be dueling San Jose State's Sheldon Canley for the national all-purpose 
yardage championship. 
</P>
<P>
And if he can come up with 312 yards? 
</P>
<P>
He can break Sanders' record in that esteemed category, Most Yards Gained, 
Three Consecutive Games. 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Marcus Bell of Etiwanda High School, Joe Bertrand of Verbum Dei High, Michael 
Bloodworth of Palisades High and Joe Small of College of the Sequoias, formerly 
of Bolsa Grande High, have signed national letters of intent to attend 
Fullerton on basketball scholarships, Coach John Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Hennessey of Orange Coast College, formerly of Edison High, Claudette 
Jackson of Golden West College, Felicia Smith of St. Mary's Academy, Tiffany 
Luciow of Apple Valley High and Kelly McClanahan of Palm Desert High have 
signed letters of intent with the women's basketball program, Coach Maryalyce 
Jeremiah said.

WALL REJECTS PRESSURE TO QUIT AS TOP S&amp;L REGULATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Embattled savings and loan regulator M. Danny Wall refused to resign Monday and 
said President Bush "wants to hear the other side of the story." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said in an interview published Saturday that he is considering whether to 
dismiss Wall, who is under fire for his handling of the investigation of 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
But Wall, after testifying at a congressional hearing Monday, said the 
President "knows that one is innocent until proven guilty." He said he had 
acted properly in handling the case of Lincoln, which suffered a financial 
collapse that may ultimately cost the taxpayers $2 billion, making it the 
biggest single thrift failure. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew far less than people think we did," said Wall, who rejected a 
recommendation by federal regulators in San Francisco in 1987 that the Federal 
Home Loan Bank Board seize Lincoln then. Instead, the bank board seized Lincoln 
in April of this year, after its losses had mounted substantially. 
</P>
<P>
"We had insufficient basis to take the actions" sought by the San Francisco 
regulators, Wall said. He was chairman of the bank board then and is now 
chairman of its successor agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision. 
</P>
<P>
The Lincoln issue has become politically explosive because of efforts by five 
senators, including Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), to intervene with federal 
officials on Lincoln's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Wall said Monday that Cranston's calls to him in 1987 and 1989 were "perfectly 
appropriate." In 1987, Wall said, Cranston urged a prompt decision on a pending 
regulatory review of Lincoln, and in 1989 Cranston asked for a rapid decision 
on whether the government would permit the sale of Lincoln to outside 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said Monday that the Senate 
Ethics Committee is conducting a serious inquiry into the actions of the five 
senators: Cranston, Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), John Glenn (D-Ohio), Dennis 
DeConcini (D-Ariz.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.). 
</P>
<P>
All five senators received significant campaign contributions from Lincoln's 
owner, Charles H. Keating Jr., the Arizona financier who controlled Lincoln's 
parent firm, American Continental Corp. of Phoenix. The inquiry is designed to 
determine if the panel should conduct a full investigation of the five senators 
with the help of an outside counsel. 
</P>
<P>
"The matter is being investigated," said Mitchell. "The fact that the Ethics 
Committee does not put out press releases does not mean that it is not 
investigating the matter very seriously." 
</P>
<P>
All five senators have been asked by the committee to respond to the charges 
that they improperly influenced the federal regulators' dealings with Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), who has been 
holding hearings into the Lincoln debacle, has said Wall systematically misled 
the committee about the extent of the nation's failing S&amp;L problem and 
mishandled his regulatory duties. He has asked the President to fire Wall. 
</P>
<P>
Wall responded Monday that the committee has not yet given him a chance to 
provide his version of events. "Many questions should be asked and answered in 
a timely fashion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wall is now scheduled to testify to the House Banking Committee next Tuesday. 
The hearings resume today with the testimony of Securities and Exchange 
Commission Chairman Richard C. Breeden, who will discuss his agency's inquiries 
into the activities of Lincoln and American Continental. 
</P>
<P>
Wall's comments Monday followed an appearance before a special House Banking 
Committee task force that is monitoring the S&amp;L bailout. The hearing dealt 
with the Resolution Trust Corp., the new agency created to shut down insolvent 
S&amp;Ls and dispose of their assets such as real estate acquired when 
borrowers were unable to repay their loans.

MERCURY S&amp;L STOCK TAKES A 29.6% DIVE;

THRIFTS: A HUNTINGTON BEACH FIRM IS ONE OF 800 THAT FEDERAL REGULATORS HAVE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Investors abandoned ailing Mercury Savings &amp; Loan Assn. in droves Monday, 
driving the price of the thrift's thinly traded stock to a seven-year low of 
$2.38 a share, down $1 for the day. 
</P>
<P>
In heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange, 53,200 shares of Mercury 
changed hands Monday -- about eight times the last month's average daily volume 
for the stock. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Huntington Beach thrift said they know of no new information 
about the thrift that would account for the trading -- a statement echoed by 
thrift industry analysts. 
</P>
<P>
The plunging stock price slashed Mercury's market value by 29.6% and gave the 
S&amp;L the dubious honor of leading the Big Board's list of percentage losers 
for the day. 
</P>
<P>
The $2.2-billion thrift's stock price has been gently sliding since 1986 but 
began a headlong dive a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury common stock slipped below $4 a share for the first time in nearly six 
years on Nov. 7, the day after federal regulators said 800 S&amp;Ls across the 
nation would not be able to meet new financial standards to be imposed Dec. 7. 
Mercury is one of the 800. 
</P>
<P>
The steep stock decline has been especially worrisome for Mercury because it is 
actively seeking new capital through a merger or outright sale. A declining 
stock price greatly reduces value to a would-be purchaser. 
</P>
<P>
Just a month ago, Mercury's stock traded at $5 a share, giving the company a 
base market value of $31.6 million. At Monday's closing price of $2.38, that 
base has been cut nearly 53%, to $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
The stock of one other California thrift, Columbia S&amp;L, also dropped 
sharply Monday. Columbia's common stock price was down 63 cents to $3.88 a 
share, a 13.9% loss; its preferred stock dropped 50 cents a share to $3.63, off 
12.1%. 
</P>
<P>
Investors who sold Mercury and Columbia shares Monday were probably reacting a 
few days late to the tough new S&amp;L capital rules issued last week, 
suggested Henry S. Peltz, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods. The New 
York institutional brokerage specializes in the banking and thrift industries. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, S&amp;Ls must maintain much higher levels of capital than 
most now carry, and the capital requirements are even tougher for thrifts with 
a lot of untraditional investments. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia, which has executive offices in Beverly Hills and administrative 
offices in Irvine, has long eschewed the S&amp;L's traditional role of making 
mortgage loans on single-family homes, and instead has operated much as a Wall 
Street investment firm. It maintains a huge portfolio of so-called junk bonds 
-- risky unsecured corporate debt that pays a high return if the issuing 
corporations stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury has stayed largely in the mortgage lending business but in the last 
year has been forced to restate earnings and revalue its portfolio, as federal 
regulators mounted a campaign against what they see as lax accounting standards 
that have enabled many thrifts to artificially inflate the value of their 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
In Mercury's case, the regulatory pressure resulted in a reversal of the 
S&amp;L's 1988 annual earnings report. A $6.1-million profit originally 
reported in February became a $7.4-million loss in March -- and was reassessed 
once again in May into a $13.8-million loss. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury has also reported losses in every quarter so far this year, for a 
cumulative nine-month loss of $5.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
As of June 30, the ratio of the S&amp;L's capital to tangible assets was just 
half of the 1.5% that will be required Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 19, Mercury announced that it had retained Merrill Lynch Capital 
Markets to help it find ways to raise new capital, through merger or outright 
sale if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L's previous low stock price was $1.91 a share in the second quarter 
of 1982 -- a year when the local and national housing markets were in a major 
slump and most S&amp;Ls were losing money. Mercury rebounded nicely, however: 
By mid-1986 its stock was selling at an all-time high of $15.13 a share. 
</P>
<P>
But federal regulators began worrying aloud in 1987 that the thrift industry 
was in trouble -- worries that have been realized with the failure of hundreds 
of thrifts across the country -- and Mercury's stock, along with that of most 
other S&amp;Ls, began slipping again. 
</P>
<P>
It dropped to $4 a share for a short period at the end of 1987, and for the 
next 23 months -- until early last week -- had ranged from $4.13 to $9.67 a 
share.

EX-BANK HEAD PLEADS GUILTY TO CONSPIRACY

A former Tustin bank president pleaded guilty Monday to one count of conspiracy 
for giving phony credit information to five Las Vegas casinos so they would 
approve credit lines for several alleged organized crime figures. 
</P>
<P>
Roger McGinnis, 52, of Orange, admitted in U.S. District Court that while 
president of Far Western Bank in 1984 he helped to provide bad credit 
information to five casinos: Binion's Horseshoe, the Las Vegas Hilton, the MGM 
Grand Hotel and Casino, the Sands Hotel and Casino and the Desert Inn and 
Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
He faces up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Sentencing before 
District Judge Stephen V. Wilson is scheduled for Jan. 18. 
</P>
<P>
The five casinos extended loans worth thousands of dollars to Robert Benjamin, 
John DeMattia and Morton Goodman. 
</P>
<P>
DeMattia pleaded guilty to wire fraud in April, 1988, in connection with the 
scheme. He also pleaded guilty to extortion in an unrelated case and received a 
three-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Goodman, who is trying to negotiate a plea bargain in the case, and DeMattia 
are alleged associates of a Los Angeles organized crime family, according to 
Department of Justice special attorney Drew Pitt. 
</P>
<P>
Pitt said he did not know how McGinnis first became associated with the men. 
McGinnis was indicted in October, 1987, on 19 counts of conspiracy and wire 
fraud. All but one of the counts were dropped as part of a plea bargain.

UNION ASSAILS CHINESE PRACTICES AT U.S. PLANT; 
</P>
<P>
WORKPLACE: EMPLOYEES EXPECTED TO GET THEIR JOBS BACK WHEN THE CHINESE BOUGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
China's Communist government espouses the rights of the working class, but 
laborers at its steel plant in the United States say the boss is a stingy, 
rotten capitalist. 
</P>
<P>
CitiSteel USA Inc., a subsidiary of the China International Trust &amp; 
Investment Corp., a state-run agency of the Chinese government, bought bankrupt 
Phoenix Steel in June, 1988, for $13.5 million. After the new owner invested an 
additional $56 million, it reopened the plant in March. 
</P>
<P>
The venture is just one of several U.S. businesses that Beijing has dabbled in 
as part of a broader economic-reform policy. In recent years, for example, 
Chinese government entities have acquired or invested in a machine plant in the 
Pittsburgh area, a West Coast refinery, a chemical factory in Louisiana and a 
plot of timberland in the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
The steel plant in this Delaware River town had been organized by the 
steelworkers union, which contends that it had a promise from the new owners to 
rehire former workers. But CitiSteel says it promised nothing and can hire 
whomever it wants. 
</P>
<P>
"We have hired former workers. They (Phoenix Steel) had 800 people. We have a 
right to select," CitiSteel Chairman Lu Ming said. 
</P>
<P>
CitiSteel has about 220 workers and expects employment to peak at about 300 by 
early 1990. Only about 25% of CitiSteel workers are former Phoenix employees. 
</P>
<P>
CitiSteel spokesman Edwin Golin said the company cannot hire indiscriminately 
because Phoenix employees allegedly were cited for pilfering and sabotage 
during the last three years of Phoenix's operations. 
</P>
<P>
"CitiSteel needs the luxury of hiring the people that they feel are best 
qualified for the job, whether they were a previous worker or not, and that's 
what they're doing," Golin said. 
</P>
<P>
The union filed an unfair labor charge with the National Labor Relations Board 
in February, alleging that CitiSteel refuses to hire former union members. A 
decision is pending. 
</P>
<P>
CitiSteel makes steel plate for bridges, buildings and heavy machinery. Phoenix 
Steel manufactured armor plate for submarines. 
</P>
<P>
The steelworkers union demonstrated outside the Chinese Embassy in Washington 
and sent an open letter to the Chinese government that said CitiSteel's hiring 
practices are an "outrageous treatment of workers." The union hasn't received a 
reply. 
</P>
<P>
"It has no place in American industry. How ironic! The People's Republic of 
China, which professes to be a workers' government, in their own land, is 
guilty of suppressing workers in ours. . . . CitiSteel may like to call itself 
a 'Socialist Conglomerate,' but when it comes to worker issues, it acts just 
like the worst capitalist," the letter asserts. 
</P>
<P>
CitiSteel "refers to itself as an entrepreneurial enterprise in the United 
States of America," Golin said. "They're working within the culture of this 
country, and this country is free enterprise. The union is saying that's bad." 
</P>
<P>
When the plant is fully staffed, workers will be allowed to vote on whether 
they want union representation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Norman P. Hayman, staff representative for the union's District 7 in King of 
Prussia, Pa., said the union feels that it was duped. 
</P>
<P>
It supported CitiSteel before the Delaware General Assembly for an exemption to 
the state's Coastal Zone Act, which heavily restricts industries in 
environmentally sensitive areas such as the banks of the Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, former Chancery Court Chancellor Grover C. Brown, a lawyer for L. 
H. Chang, a Hong Kong businessman who helped China negotiate to buy the 
company, testified before the state Senate on behalf of CitiSteel in its bid 
for the exemption. 
</P>
<P>
"It is their intention to utilize those former workers who have the skills and 
can be the most helpful in getting the plant open," Brown said then. 
</P>
<P>
It appears that CitiSteel has literally done that -- hired skilled workers 
only, although the union interpreted Brown's statement to mean preference would 
go to all former union members. 
</P>
<P>
Hayman said that in a meeting with the company in June, "they told us 
two-thirds of the skilled work force came from the Phoenix Steel unit," but the 
unskilled work force, which is a majority of the employees, does not include 
former Phoenix workers, Hayman said. 
</P>
<P>
"The people they really had to have they got them. It just shows an anti-union 
(attitude). They just don't want to deal with the union," Hayman said. 
</P>
<P>
Some CitiSteel employees said they prefer working in a non-union plant. 
</P>
<P>
One worker, who spoke on condition that he not be identified, said he was a 
former Phoenix Steel worker and union member but does not want the union back. 
He contends that the day Phoenix Steel closed, the union left town. 
</P>
<P>
"They never gave us any kind of help at all, and now they want back in, and I 
don't think they should," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It would probably be worse if the union was back in the plant. They make 
demands, and these people are just trying to start out. Let the people try to 
get it together first," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He says benefits are about the same, and he's making more money for doing the 
same job he did for Phoenix. He declined to say exactly how much he makes. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot less tension and a lot less griping. Everybody's pulling their 
load. When you don't have a union behind you, you pull your load more. 
</P>
<P>
"You're working in a more relaxed atmosphere. You're not worrying about 
benefits and your rights. You just do your job and you get paid for what you 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Union members, some with 30 years or more service, lost seniority and their 
pensions, and some were sent home with less than $100 compensation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what else you can do in a situation where a plant is sold," 
Hayman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever we can do, we're doing. At the same time, I don't want to take away 
anybody's sense of indignation. But I also think there are a lot of union 
people out there who are appreciative of what we're doing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The union's concerns over the hiring practices caught the attention of the 
Delaware Senate, which passed legislation this year that would require 
CitiSteel to hire more former Phoenix employees by Jan. 1 or lose its operating 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
The bill is pending in the House, and the General Assembly does not reconvene 
until January.

<P>
Last year, Micom Communications was a company in trouble. The Simi Valley-based 
concern was losing money and employed too many managers for its needs, yet was 
still uncertain about its strategy for the future. 
</P>
<P>
But in the past year, Micom, which makes devices that allow computers to "talk" 
to each other and share information, has been overhauled. 
</P>
<P>
New management took over, 36% of Micom's work force was laid off and overhead 
costs were slashed. Micom, with sales expected to total $85 million this year, 
says it's profitable again and expects growth with some new products, even 
though its parent company showed a loss in the quarter that ended June 30.

The changes were triggered when Micom Communications was taken private as part 
of a $334-million leveraged buyout of the former Micom Systems in September, 
1988, by the New York investment firm Odyssey Partners. 
</P>
<P>
Micom also has a new corporate parent, Black Box Inc., which Odyssey Partners 
named for Black Box Corp., a Lawrence, Penn., mail-order business for data 
communications products that was Micom Systems' most profitable company. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Black Box umbrella, the Black Box catalogue business and Micom 
Communications are the only remaining operations. Three other former Micom 
Systems units were sold by Odyssey Partners for a total of $82.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Micom Communications had no choice but to scale down. In a leveraged buyout, an 
acquisition is paid for with borrowed money and the debt is paid off with cash 
from the acquired company's operations or by selling off pieces of the firm. 
Black Box still has about $200 million in debt left from the buyout, Micom 
said, requiring interest payments of $21 million this year. But Micom asserted 
that cash generated from its business and that of the catalogue company should 
cover that bill. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Micom was losing $2 million to $4 million a year when it was 
acquired, Odyssey held onto it because "they felt if we could get this business 
under control and manage it efficiently, this could be a real turnaround," said 
Gilbert Cabral, Micom's president and chief executive. Cabral, who formerly 
headed Micom's manufacturing operations, is the only remaining member of the 
previous management team. 
</P>
<P>
After the buyout, Cabral cut the work force by more than 400 -- the company 
presently employs 711 -- and disbanded the firm's direct sales force. He closed 
manufacturing plants in Mexico and the Far East, consolidated manufacturing in 
California and Puerto Rico and is in the process of selling and leasing back 
the company's Simi Valley headquarters. In all, he reduced costs by about $17 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
"It was ugly," Cabral said of the cutbacks. "But a cost structure had been 
built up that was too excessive for the company." He said he expects Micom to 
earn 7 or 8 cents per dollar of sales before taxes in the current fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite trimming down, the company faces a more daunting challenge: It must 
continue to bring out new products that will allow it to compete in a 
marketplace where technological innovations happen so fast that products 
introduced just a few years ago might already be obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
"There's this evolution, so if you don't have a product, somebody else is going 
to get the business," said Steven D. Levy, an analyst with the investment firm 
Hambrecht &amp; Quist in New York. "If everyone's going to diet soda, you'd 
better have a diet soda." 
</P>
<P>
Micom's main product lines include devices that allow companies to save phone 
line costs by squeezing more data onto one line and equipment that lets 
computers "talk" to each other electronically. Micom aims for the less 
expensive end of those markets with about 300 products ranging from $80 to 
$250,000. 
</P>
<P>
But overall demand for Micom's bread-and-butter products has leveled off as new 
technologies have been developed. While Micom is still holding onto its 
traditional product lines, which Cabral says still produce steady sales, he 
hopes the company's growth will come from new products that it plans to begin 
shipping next month. 
</P>
<P>
These include equipment that transmits voices and data on the same phone line 
and products that save money by allowing data to flow through one of several 
alternative routes. 
</P>
<P>
The voice-data technology, which can cut a company's phone bills by half or 
more, has already taken hold among Fortune 500 companies. But Micom is gearing 
its versions of the products, priced at $4,000 to $6,500, to smaller companies 
that use phones extensively. It is a new market in which Republic Telcom in 
Boulder, Colo., is the biggest player. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Sleek, a marketing and communications specialist for Republic, said 
Republic doesn't fear Micom. "They're still back at square one," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Larry Cynar, an analyst at Dataquest, a market research firm in San 
Jose, said Micom might have latched on to a growing market in the early stages. 
"It's got more risk associated with it than going into a business that's 
known," he said. "But then again, the potential for them is to grab a big 
market share if it turns out to be a bigger market than I can foresee right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Vonarx, Micom's vice president of sales and marketing who left the company 
in 1985 but returned last year after the buyout, projected sales of Micom's new 
voice-data products will total $5 million this year and $10 million next year. 
</P>
<P>
How did Micom foul up in the first place? In the late 1970s and early 1980s, 
Micom captured a large share of the low-capacity, low-priced end of the market 
for computer communications equipment. But in 1985, "a wall was hit and the 
business started declining," Cabral said. Part of the decline was due to an 
overall market slowdown, but it also was because the company had diversified 
into higher-end products and was not paying enough attention to its main 
business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The previous management "was basically milking the core business" to pay for 
the new product lines, said Barry Phelps, a Micom employee since 1987 who was 
elevated to chief financial officer after the buyout. 
</P>
<P>
Micom Systems' earnings declined from $22.1 million on $194 million in revenue 
in the fiscal year ended March 31, 1985, to $9.8 million on revenue of $218 
million in the fiscal year ended April 3, 1988, the last full year the company 
was public. Its stock fell from a record high of $49.75 in 1983 to $6.50 in 
late-1987. When a dispute erupted among directors over the company's direction, 
the decision was made to find a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
After the buyout, Odyssey immediately sold Micom Digital, a Herndon, Va.-based 
data communications products firm that was Micom's biggest money-loser, to 
Telematix for $9.65 million. Interlan, a Boxborough, Mass., manufacturer of 
high-speed communications equipment that links computers in one building, was 
sold to Racal Interlan in May for $58 million. Micom Borer, the firm's United 
Kingdom subsidiary, was purchased by Tricom Group in May for $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
Odyssey split the remaining subsidiaries into two independently run businesses. 
Black Box, the catalogue company, is considered the industry standard for 
mail-order computer parts and was consistently profitable even through Micom's 
bad times. Gene Yost, Black Box's president, said he expects the company to 
post more than $100 million in sales this year, a 20% gain from last year. 
</P>
<P>
According to documents filed last summer with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission in connection with an offering of debt and equity, the parent 
company, Black Box Inc., lost $2.6 million on revenue of $169 million in the 
fiscal year ended March 31, and lost another $732,000 on $46 million in revenue 
in its fiscal first quarter ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Though Phelps said Odyssey is satisfied with Micom's performance so far, a 
former Micom executive, who asked not to be identified, said it's likely that 
Micom Communications will be sold within a few years. "The guys that bought it 
are basically financial buyers," he said. "In general, those buyers aren't long 
term." 
</P>
<P>
Brian D. Young, Black Box's president and an Odyssey general parter, did not 
return phone calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
Cabral is concentrating on trying to bring the company back to a sense of 
normalcy after the upheaval of the past few years. He's instituted such 
programs as quality education classes, paid out companywide bonuses and calls 
all employees "team members." 
</P>
<P>
These efforts have helped to improve morale, Cabral said. "People are back to 
work in this company, whereas before they were more concerned about what was 
going to happen to Micom," he said.

POP CAPSULES: MADRID'S MECANO FINDS AN AMERICAN AUDIENCE 
</P>

<P>
If you're a fan of Euro-pop and the dance rhythms and baby voice of Paula 
Abdul, the Spanish trio Mecano may be just the group for you. The Madrid-based 
band is described as the biggest-selling Spanish group in the world and a 
favorite in Latin America. Though Mecano is on its first U.S. tour, it appears 
to already have a large following in this country: It played three nights at 
the Palace this weekend, and the super-appreciative audience on Saturday sang 
along with many of the band's disco-like tunes and ballads. 
</P>
<P>
Mecano is strongest when playing up-tempo dance music like "Los Amantes" (The 
Lovers), "Un Ano Mas" (One More Year) and "La Fuerza del Destino" (The Force of 
Destiny), which put the spotlight on the riveting lead singer Ana Torroja, 
whose dance movements ranged from Isadora Duncan-like free-form ballet to funky 
aerobics. The group is much better in concert than on record -- Torroja's 
gentle, high-pitched voice sounds weak and insipid in the studio. Despite the 
mediocrity of many of the numbers (the music is all written by keyboardist 
Nacho Cano and his brother, guitarist Jose Cano), the band put on a theatrical, 
fun show that the audience seemed to love. CLAUDIA PUIG

COLLISION AT SEA ADDS TO LIST OF NAVY'S MISHAPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since Oct. 29, when the crash of a Navy airman making his first aircraft 
carrier landing killed five, to the collision Sunday of the San Diego-based 
destroyer Kinkaid, the last two weeks have been a nightmare of Navy men killed 
at sea and in plane crashes. 
</P>
<P>
The death of the Kinkaid's navigator, Lt. Sean Michael McPhee, 24, of Santa 
Rosa, came as the destroyer collided with a merchant vessel in the pre-dawn 
darkness off Malaysia. It brought the year's toll to 102 Navy personnel killed 
during training and standard operating procedures, the highest in the decade, 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 63 men were killed, and there were 69 major accidents. So far in 
1989, there have been 67 major accidents involving loss of life or more than $1 
million damage to Navy property. 
</P>
<P>
But Navy officials say that, despite the recent string of accidents, their 
personnel are well-trained and maintain a high regard for safety. 
</P>
<P>
"The readiness of today's Naval forces has never been better," said Adm. C. A. 
H. Trost, chief of Naval Operations, in a statement released Monday. "The Navy 
faces an unforgiving and inherently dangerous environment at sea. Despite 
uncompromising attention to safety procedures and exhaustive training 
standards, the dangers are always present; and, despite our best efforts, 
accidents do happen." 
</P>
<P>
Officials point out that this year's death toll includes 47 sailors killed in 
the explosion aboard the battleship Iowa last April. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not consider the Iowa an accident," said. Lt. Greg Smith, a Navy 
spokesman. The Navy determined that an explosion aboard the Iowa was an "act of 
suicide" by Gunner's Mate Clayton Hartwig, who died in the blast. Although 
officials include the Iowa deaths in their tally, the other fatal incidents 
occurred during training exercises or routine operations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith and other officials say the accidents and deaths during the last few 
weeks are unrelated and do not reflect a trend. Since 1984, an average of 70 
Navy personnel have died each year in duty-related incidents. 
</P>
<P>
The collision involving the Kinkaid, one of five accidents in recent days, was 
part of "what has been a bad couple of weeks for the Navy," said Cmdr. David 
Dillon, a spokesman for the commander of the Pacific Fleet in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The 563-foot Kinkaid, which sailed through the Strait of Malacca on its own 
power, reached Singapore waters Monday about nine hours later than officials 
had expected, Dillon said. The 8,350-ton destroyer was met by tugs that 
escorted it to the Sembawang Shipyard for repairs and investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The Kinkaid has a crew of 20 officers and 297 sailors. The accident occurred 
about 240 miles northwest of Singapore when the destroyer and the Kota Petani, 
a 430-foot Panamanian-registry freighter, collided. The freighter had taken on 
a cargo in Singapore and was headed for the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
McPhee was killed as he rested in his berth. Five other Navy men were injured 
and four of them were taken to Mt. Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore, Dillon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
To bolster morale among the crew, officials installed five telephones aboard 
the Kinkaid to allow sailors to call home -- an unusual practice, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The crew is working, working to get things back to normal. I have no idea how 
long that will take," said Lt. Cmdr. David Cunningham, executive officer of the 
Kinkaid, reached by telephone aboard the ship in Singapore. "We're doing 
everything possible to make life as normal as possible on board." 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham declined to describe the accident, saying: "An investigation is in 
process and, until that's finished, we really can't say anything. The 
investigators are already on board." 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, a Kansas native, said he did not know whether the crew would wait 
for repairs to be finished or be sent elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The Kinkaid was on its way from the Indian Ocean for a scheduled port call in 
Singapore when it collided with the freighter. The collision ripped a 
15-by-56-foot hole above the waterline on the starboard side of the destroyer. 
</P>
<P>
Officials do not know why the collision occurred. It happened at 5:19 a.m., and 
the skies were dark though clear, Dillon said. The sea conditions do not appear 
to have contributed to the accident, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The earth is covered with three-quarters water, and still ships collide," 
Dillon said. "It's unfortunate that all these accidents seem to be occurring in 
one short period of time." 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Naval Safety Center will investigate each of the accidents 
that has struck the Navy this year, Navy spokesman Smith said. Excluding the 
explosion aboard the Iowa, "we are having our best year," Smith said. This 
year, there have been 1.8 accidents for every 100,000 hours of flight, or the 
Navy's safest flight rate ever, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials do not expect to ease up the Navy's training. Adm. Trost said 
training "on deployed ships and aircraft, at all times of the day or night, in 
varying environmental conditions and in realistic operational situations" has 
resulted in a "high state of readiness." 
</P>
<P>
Others say that Navy personnel are at lower risk than people in other 
occupations. In 1987, there were 49 deaths per 100,000 agriculture workers; 38 
per 100,000 miners. During the same year, the rate was 12 deaths per 100,000 
Navy personnel. These figures, however, involve a range of Navy personnel, from 
those with desk jobs to those working aboard ships. The Navy does not have 
statistics available for men whose jobs might place them at higher risk. 
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, the (military) population as a group tend to be better educated 
than the population at large and more safety-oriented than the population at 
large," said John Welmsley, a spokesman for USAA, an insurance company whose 
clients are 95% military. 
</P>
<P>
But, although officials quote safety data, many confess privately to an 
uneasiness as the toll of accidents has climbed in the last two weeks: 
</P>
<P>
* On Nov. 9, a Navy Reserve jet crashed into a Georgia apartment complex, 
killing two residents. 
</P>
<P>
* On Nov. 1, nine sailors suffered smoke inhalation, and four were treated for 
burns after a boiler fire aboard the tanker Monongahela, about 500 miles west 
of Gibraltar. 
</P>
<P>
* On Oct. 31, three sailors and a reported $4 million of non-nuclear missiles 
were swept overboard by a wave striking the aircraft carrier Eisenhower near 
Cape Hatteras, N.C. One sailor is presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
* On Oct. 30, a sailor fell overboard from the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson in 
the Pacific about 620 miles north of Wake island. He is presumed lost. 
</P>
<P>
* On Oct. 30, a pilot dropped a 500-pound bomb on the guided missile cruiser 
Reeves in the Indian Ocean, causing minor injuries to five sailors. 
</P>
<P>
* On Oct. 29, a training jet crashed aboard the aircraft carrier Lexington in 
the Gulf of Mexico, killing the pilot and four sailors aboard.

Former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger was the target of protesters' 
eggs and tomatoes today during an appearance with the Duchess of Kent, the 
former Sarah Ferguson, at Leeds University in England. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Weinberger nor Fergie was hit, but a bag of flour landed near the 
duchess. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,500 protesters denounced Weinberger as a warmonger because of U.S. 
support for the Contras in Nicaragua, but Weinberger said the reception didn't 
bother him. In fact, he said it made him feel like he was back in the United 
States.

The U.S. Navy has decided to sharply curtail aircraft flights and warship 
movements for 48 hours to study safety procedures after a recent series of 
accidents around the world, defense officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a safety stand-down. They will look at their procedures to see if 
something more can be done for safety," said one of the officials, who asked 
not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest in a string of incidents, at least 13 sailors and shipyard 
workers were injured in Norfolk, Va., today in a fire aboard the helicopter 
landing ship Inchon, the seventh accident involving a U.S. warship since Oct. 
11. 
</P>
<P>
Both Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Navy officials said earlier that the 
accidents, which included U.S. ships and aircraft firing at or bombing one 
another, showed no pattern. 
</P>
<P>
But some experts have called for a close look at safety procedures as the 
random accidents have mounted. 
</P>
<P>
One sailor was in serious condition and another in guarded condition at 
hospitals in Norfolk after the brief morning fire aboard the Inchon, which was 
docked at a shipyard for routine maintenance, according to Navy Lt. Cmdr. Steve 
Burnett. 
</P>
<P>
"It was apparently an electrical fire. As far as we can determine, there were 
no other serious injuries," Burnett said. He said the fire in a power 
distribution room on the hangar deck of the Inchon was quelled shortly after it 
broke out at 9:30 a.m.

EAST BLOC: THE MOST HARD-LINE OF SOVIET BLOC NATIONS WILL ALLOW TRAVEL OUT OF

Premier Ladislav Adamec said today that Czechoslovak citizens will no longer 
need exit permits to travel outside the country, a major reform in one of the 
last hard-line East Bloc nations. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement comes less than a week after East Germany lifted most travel 
restrictions on its citizens and opened its borders to the West, triggering a 
flood of visitors to West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In an address to the Czechoslovak Federal Assembly, Adamec said his government 
regards "tourism as the citizens' important right to get to know the world, 
gain experience and establish personal contacts." 
</P>
<P>
Czechoslovakia has been among the most resistant countries in the East Bloc to 
the Soviet-style political reforms sweeping Poland, Hungary and now East 
Germany. It has crushed public dissent and jailed protesters calling for 
democratic reforms. Police used truncheons and arrested scores during 
pro-reform demonstrations in October. 
</P>
<P>
During the summer, the government eased some travel restrictions but did not 
lift the requirement for an exit visa when traveling to the West. Authorities 
have often refused to allow leading dissidents to travel abroad. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, President Bush hailed the development. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of Czechoslovakia have the same aspirations for freedom that others 
have, and I would expect we'd see further changes there, just as we have seen 
in Poland, Hungary and in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). So 
it's a very good and encouraging step," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
Adamec said the government was changing the law to make travel easier. He did 
not say when the new rule would take effect, but it was expected to begin in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
"The processing of travel documents is being speeded up," Adamec said. "For 
travel to non-socialist countries and to Yugoslavia, exit visas will not be 
necessary." Yugoslavia is a Communist country but is not aligned with the 
Warsaw Pact, so travel to it had been restricted. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Czechoslovak citizens wishing to travel West must apply for exit 
visas with the Interior Ministry. Before a trip is authorized, would-be 
travelers must also obtain stamps from their employers and from military 
authorities.

DUPED ON INVESTMENTS, LINCOLN DEPOSITORS SAY

Victims of the worst thrift failure in history told a House committee today 
that they were duped into investing their life savings in what they were told 
were federally insured securities only to learn later they were worthless junk 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Connie Wickman, 78, of West Hills in the San Fernando Valley told the House 
Banking Committee that she and her 80-year-old husband were devastated when 
they were told earlier this year that their $25,000 in bonds sold through 
Lincoln and issued by its parent company, American Continental Corp. of 
Phoenix, was lost. 
</P>
<P>
"When a senior citizen loses their life savings, it is not only the money they 
lose, but something more important," she said in a barely audible voice. "They 
have failed -- themselves, their children, their families and also in tomorrow, 
believing there is nothing left for them to believe in." 
</P>
<P>
The Wickmans are among 22,000 people, mostly Los Angeles-area retirees who 
state and federal officials say were targeted by Lincoln to switch nearly $200 
million in federally insured deposits into junk bonds after federal examiners 
first recommended closing the S &amp; L in May, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Those bonds became virtually worthless when American Continental declared 
bankruptcy last April, one day before the government finally seized its Irvine 
Lincoln subsidiary which had lost an estimated $2 billion in savers' federally 
insured deposits. 
</P>
<P>
The government last month filed a $1.1-billion suit against Lincoln's owner, 
Phoenix millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr., charging fraud and racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, both the FBI and the Senate Ethics Committee are investigating 
whether five senators, including Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who received $1.3 
million in political contributions from Keating, intervened with federal 
regulators in keeping Lincoln open for two years after government examiners 
recommended closing it down. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston and the four other senators -- Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), John McCain 
(R-Ariz), Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) and John Glenn (D-Ohio) -- have denied 
any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
But Mrs. Wickman's daughter, Frances Rose of West Hills, held Keating and 
Cranston responsible for what she described as a fraud that could make her 
parents destitute in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, Keating has contributed a total of $974,000 in 
either campaign funds to Cranston or to voter registration and other political 
causes headed by members of Cranston's family. Among the items being 
investigated by the FBI is whether any of that money was illegally diverted 
from Lincoln depositors' accounts.

Priests, nuns and health workers used to dealing with AIDS sufferers today 
attacked the Vatican's first conference on the disease for not being prepared 
to listen to AIDS patients themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm quite distressed that this conference about AIDS has totally ignored 
people with AIDS," said Peter Larkin, a Roman Catholic from London who suffers 
from the disease. "I get a bit tired being told how I feel and how I think, and 
I would prefer if people asked me," he told a splinter group of priests, nuns 
and health workers. 
</P>
<P>
About 80 people broke away from the conference to stage their own meeting 
during a lunch break that turned into a virtual insurrection against conveners 
of the conference. 
</P>
<P>
John White, an Irish Catholic priest with acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
who was evicted from the conference Monday for holding up a banner reading "The 
Church Has AIDS," was readmitted today after some participants petitioned for 
him to be allowed back in.

<P>
Kohl laid a wreath at the camp's death wall, where 30,000 victims were shot. He 
then bowed his head and stood in silence as Poland's chief rabbi, Pinchas 
Menahem Yoskovitch, recalled the Holocaust and prayed for the dead, most of 
whom were Jews. 
</P>

"The warning (given by) this place must never be forgotten. Unspeakable harm 
was inflicted on different peoples here, above all European Jews, in the name 
of Germany," Kohl wrote in the camp visitors' book.

<TEXT>
<P>
Prince Franz Josef II of Liechtenstein, head of state of the tiny principality 
during a half-century that saw it become one of the world's richest nations, 
has died at age 83, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
He was the world's longest-reigning monarch when he died late Monday after a 
long, undisclosed illness and less than a month after his wife, Princess Gina, 
died at age 67. 
</P>
<P>
Franz Josef was the 12th ruler of the 270-year-old nation, last remnant of the 
Holy Roman Empire. The principality covers 61 square miles of rolling land and 
rugged mountains between Switzerland and Austria. 
</P>
<P>
His 51 years as head of state spanned the rise of this tiny democratic state 
from an underdeveloped and rural country to a sophisticated industrialized 
nation with one of the world's highest per-capita incomes. 
</P>
<P>
He enjoyed great popularity among the 28,000 inhabitants, often mixing with 
them in the streets of Vaduz, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
"I am ruling over a happy country," the prince once said in a rare interview. 
"It is a happy country because it is small." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984 he handed over his executive powers to his son, Prince Hans Adam, the 
oldest of his five children. But he retained the ceremonial role of head of 
state and continued to meet many well-wishers every year during the festivities 
marking his birthday on Aug. 16, a public holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The family's art collection of 1,400 Rubens, Van Dyck and other old master 
paintings has a current estimated value of $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
Prince Hans, 44, who now succeeds as monarch, is a trained economist.

<P>
Industrial production fell 0.7% in October, due in part to a strike in the 
aircraft industry and the effects of the California earthquake, the government 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Board said October's drop followed no change in September's 
output and a 0.3% gain in August. 
</P>
<P>
The decline had been expected following the Labor Department's report earlier 
this month that the manufacturing sector had lost 13,000 jobs in October. At 
the same time, the department reported a drop in the average manufacturing work 
week and said overtime was virtually non-existent. 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector has been among the hardest hit by the Fed's 
tight-money policies as the central bank tries to contain inflation by slowing 
the economy without tipping it into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
"The October decline largely reflected a strike in the aircraft and parts 
industry and some production disruptions, particularly in computers and related 
parts, resulting from the recent earthquake in California," the Federal Reserve 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Excluding these effects, the total index would have been nearly unchanged in 
October, continuing its recent sluggish trend." 
</P>
<P>
In another report, the Fed said the operating rate of the nation's factories, 
mines and utilities fell 0.8 of a percentage point to 82.8% in October, 
reflecting the decline in the production rate. The operating rate measures not 
only output but also changes in productivity levels. 
</P>
<P>
Factory use had dipped in September to 83.6% from 83.8% in August. The rate 
posted 10-year highs of 84.3% last December and January.

Backlash against Japanese direct investment in the United States is a "media 
preoccupation of the week" and will have no lasting political effects, former 
White House budget director David Stockman said today. 
</P>
<P>
Stockman is now a partner in a private investment bank, The Blackstone Group, 
which helped engineer the recent Sony Corp. takeover of Columbia Pictures 
Entertainment Inc. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to a reporters' group here he predicted that a decline in U.S. 
reliance on foreign capital and a lack of grass-roots political concern over 
Japanese merger and acquisition moves will gradually take the issue off the 
public agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Stockman said most Japanese direct investment does not have enough impact on 
voter sentiment to have any real effect on Congress, and that as Japanese 
spending is diffused through the economy, reaction will become increasingly 
favorable. 
</P>
<P>
"The negatives of direct investment are not as obvious as they are in trade," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is going to throw out a senator because he didn't take a forthright 
stand against Japanese direct investment." 
</P>
<P>
Stockman also predicted that the dramatic easing of East-West tensions will 
result in U.S. defense spending being cut from about 7% of gross national 
product now to no more than 4% in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
That could relieve the current account deficit and cut the U.S. need for 
foreign capital by about $150 billion a year, he said. "The defense cuts will 
gather enormous momentum and will make the budget deficit manageable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the current concern over Japanese direct investment was almost entirely 
"headline-activated" during a period when there was a vacuum of other things 
for the media to be preoccupied with. 
</P>
<P>
"Eastern Europe will now displace other issues on the front burner of 
attention," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the level of Japanese direct investment in the United States is too 
minimal to be considered an invasion, and is not likely to grow significantly.

Chalk's International Airlines, which has ferried tourists and gamblers between

Merv Griffin's Resorts International, the financially strapped owner, said it

Described as the world's oldest airline, Chalk's stopped flying to Paradise

CAR MARKET SLUMP FUELS 1% DECLINE IN OCTOBER RETAIL SALES

<P>
Retail sales, pulled back by a sluggish automobile market, fell 1% in October 
for their first decline in eight months, the government reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said overall sales dropped to a seasonally adjusted 
$144.5 billion last month after rising 0.9% in August and 0.7% in September. 
</P>
<P>
The last time retail sales fell was in February, when they dropped 0.4%. They 
were unchanged in June. 
</P>
<P>
The October decline was the largest since a 6.7% drop in January, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Retail sales account for about one-third of the nation's economic activity and 
are watched as a sign of the extent to which the Federal Reserve's policy of 
fighting inflation by tightening credit is slowing the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Auto sales, lacking major incentive programs during the month, plunged 5.1% in 
October. Car sales, which represent about 20% of the retail total, had been 
propped up by incentives for much of the year and rose 0.5% in September and 
2.2% in August. 
</P>
<P>
The October decline was the largest since auto sales fell 26.5% in January, 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding the automobile category, retail sales edged up 0.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of durable goods -- items expected to last at least three years -- fell 
2.7%, their steepest fall since a 2.8% decline in October 1987. Durable sales 
were flat in September after gaining 2% in August. 
</P>
<P>
The durable goods market has been particularly hard hit by the Fed's 
interest-rate policies because such purchases often are financed by loans. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of building materials rose 0.9% after falling 1.3% in September and 
advancing 1.7% in August. Furniture and other home furnishing sales edged up 
0.3% following a 0.6% drop in September and a 1.6% gain in August. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of non-durable goods edged up 0.1%, following a 1.1% gain in September 
and a 0.1% decline in August. 
</P>
<P>
Non-durable categories showing increases were department stores, up 0.3%; 
grocery stores, 1%; apparel, 0.2%, and drug stores, 1%. 
</P>
<P>
Non-durable categories posting declines were gasoline stations, down 0.9%, and 
restaurants and bars, off 0.2%. 
</P>
<P>
For the three months from August through October, overall retail sales were up 
6.3%. Sales for the first 10 months of 1989 were up 6% over the same period of 
1988.

<P>
Stock prices retreated broadly today, with blue chip issues leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 16.18 to 2,610.25. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 622 up, 818 down and 513 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 143.17 million shares, against 140.75 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index closed at 187.51, with a loss of 0.71. 
</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index finished 0.18 lower at 
371.52. 
</P>
<P>
Uncertainty about the outlook for lower interest rates and uneasiness about the 
economy's condition discouraged buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Several reports released before trading began confirmed economic weakness, 
particularly in the manufacturing sector. 
</P>
<P>
Retail sales fell a full percentage point in October, and the Commerce 
Department cited a slumping automobile market. The Federal Reserve reported 
that industrial production dropped 0.7% in October. 
</P>
<P>
But the statistics didn't paint a completely clear picture because they were 
influenced by special circumstances, analysts said. A strike in the aircraft 
industry and the effect of the California earthquake crimped overall output. 
</P>
<P>
Traders have been hoping that the central bank would mute the effect of the 
economic slowdown by undertaking a significant loosening of its credit policy. 
So far, the Fed hasn't taken any big steps. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury bond prices rose modestly in light early trading today. By 
midday, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up 1/8 point, or $1.25 per 
$1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to the price, slipped to 
7.86% from 7.88% Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
were up 1/16 to 3/32 point, intermediate maturities were 1/16 to 1/8 point 
higher and long-term issues ranged from 3/32 to 3/16 point higher, according to 
the Telerate Inc. financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted by midday at 8 7/16%, up from 8 3/8% late Monday.

Two Twin Cities radio stations say they have made deals to acquire small pieces 
of the Berlin Wall and will give them away to listeners. 
</P>
<P>
A third station called the idea "pretty tacky." 
</P>
<P>
KDWB-FM made the first offer Monday morning when announcer Steve Cochran 
invited listeners to win a piece of the wall by calling the station. The 25th 
caller wins. 
</P>
<P>
KJJO-FM expects to start its promotion Friday. It will give away its 40 small 
pieces by asking listeners to call when they hear songs with wall in the 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Boen, general manager at KTCZ, said he was noncommittal when a radio 
syndicate offered 40 pieces of the wall for $500. 
</P>
<P>
The promotion "trivializes the whole episode," he said. "It kind of hit us as 
pretty tacky."

Photo, Pricey Picasso -- This self-portrait painted by Pablo Picasso may set a 
record for 20th Century art Wednesday in an auction at Sotheby's. The painting, 
"Au Lapin Agile," depicts a melancholy Picasso dressed as a harlequin at a cafe 
in 1905. The sale may break the $53.9 million paid for Vincent van Gogh's 
"Irises," the world's most expensive artwork. (See story A4.) United Press

Israeli playwright Joshua Sobol's Holocaust drama "Ghetto" was named London's 
Best Play of 1989 today at the annual Evening Standard Drama Awards. 
</P>
<P>
"Ghetto," set in a Lithuanian ghetto in 1942, opened at London's 
state-subsidized Royal National Theater April 27 to near-unanimous raves and 
ran in repertory through Nov. 9. It had earlier flopped on Broadway, closing 
after 33 performances. Narrated in flashback by a ghetto survivor, the play 
tells of the last days of the theater troupe that flourished briefly in the 
city's German-occupied Jewish ghetto in Vilna from January, 1942, onward. The 
troupe was liquidated in September, 1943.

Samuel F. Pickering, the inspiration for the offbeat prep schoolteacher played 
by Robin Williams in "Dead Poets Society," still has not seen the popular 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth, I didn't know who Robin Williams was," said Pickering, 
48, a professor of English literature at the University of Connecticut. "I 
finally saw him on TV the other day. He's a nut." 
</P>
<P>
Pickering, a Nashville native interviewed by phone from his home in Storrs, 
Conn., said he does not mind the celebrity the film has brought. 
</P>
<P>
"A woman walked up to me in the supermarket the other day and told me I was 
such an inspiration that she was giving up the insurance business to go back to 
being a schoolteacher," he said.

ASK DR. RUTH: WORLDS APART: HE TAKES MANHATTAN, SHE TAKES THE FARM

Q. I am in my late 60s, my lady is in her mid-70s. The age difference is of no 
importance, but our life styles come between us. She is happy on a ranch two 
states away; I like living in a city where I have lived for 20 years and have 
activities, associations, a few friends. She is warm and hospitable; I am more 
introverted and solitude-seeking. 
</P>
<P>
Her children know about our friendship, mine do not. I can't ask her to leave 
her country life, and I don't want to leave my urban one. We are both 
comfortably well-off. How do we arrange our future? No one has ever made me as 
happy as she does, and my company seems to be very pleasing to her. 
</P>
<P>
A. What's the rush to settle down in one place or the other? If you are well 
enough fixed for income, you can spend time with each other sometimes in her 
place, sometimes in yours. That sounds sensible, but something keeps the two of 
you from adopting this simple plan, or rather letting yourselves drift into it. 
</P>
<P>
It would seem that you each have preoccupations connected with your places of 
residence. You mean so much to each other, but not enough to give up your 
interests. In fact, your interests are more interesting to you than your 
affection for each other. This is no crime. It is a good thing to have a life 
you like living, concerns that keep you occupied. You are not ready to accept 
living out on her ranch, but maybe in a while it will seem a pleasant life and 
your city preoccupations may not seem so important. Or the pleasures of living 
in town may captivate her. Why not go along as you are for a while, and find 
out what happens? 
</P>
<P>
Q. I am 60 and I have been stimulating myself to orgasm regularly since 
puberty. At present I would say I do this about six times a week. Is this 
likely to impair my future health? 
</P>
<P>
A. No. There is no medical evidence that doing this has any health effect at 
all.

COMMISSIONERS PROMISE FREE TELECASTS;

CABLE TV: CONGRESSMEN ARE UPSET BY INCREASING NUMBER OF MAJOR SPORTS BROADCAST 
ON PAY-PER-VIEW BASIS.

<P>
Several senators and congressmen said today that they will take action if too 
many major sports events went from broadcast to cable or pay television, but 
two league commissioners promised that free telecasts will continue. 
</P>
<P>
"The lure of big bucks may well prompt sports leagues and teams to completely 
bypass free TV, writing off those people who can't afford cable or can't get 
it," Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) said at a Judiciary Committee hearing 
on sports television. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as this senator is around, that won't happen," Metzenbaum added. 
"Congress has some leverage here, given the favorable antitrust treatment 
granted to sports leagues. We'll use that leverage, if need be." 
</P>
<P>
Metzenbaum and others voiced concern about recent deals giving cable systems 
exclusive rights to many sports events, such as the 175 major league baseball 
games to be shown in each of the next four years by cable network ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
CBS, meanwhile, is cutting the number of weekly over-the-air televised baseball 
games from 26 to 16 but will carry the league playoffs and World Series. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN also carries 13 pro football games a season as well as hundreds of college 
football and basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
"These developments are cause for serious concern," Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman 
(D-Conn.) said. "We are witnessing the development of two tiers of sports 
programs -- those available to the general public and those available to 
consumers who can pay to receive them on cable." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent and National Football League Commissioner 
Paul Tagliabue said cable broadcasts will add coverage for sports fans, not 
reduce it. Tagliabue said the overwhelming majority of NFL games will stay on 
free TV. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not see pay-per-view for the Super Bowl for the balance of this 
century," Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
Pay-per-view systems require viewers to pay in advance to see individual 
programs, such as movies and sports events. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent said the number of baseball games available in local markets has 
increased sharply in recent years and free TV games exceeded cable telecasts by 
over 55%. He said even with the new cable agreement, each team could broadcast 
as many as 130 games a year in their markets. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Reps. Charles E. Schumer and Thomas J. Downey of New York said they 
are upset because the New York Yankees sold rights to all their baseball games 
beginning in 1991 to cable television, as have the New York Knicks basketball 
team and all three local hockey teams this season.

"I get so many letters from there. I think the people who write just want to be

Among the most memorable letters Graf said she has received came from a

The driver of the car that struck and fatally injured Canadian swimming star 
Victor Davis was not drunk, a passenger in that automobile said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Dres, who leases the black Honda that hit Davis outside a bar Saturday 
night, told the Montreal Gazette that the 19-year-old driver, whom he did not 
identify, was behind the wheel because he was not drunk. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone else was the designated driver of the car because he was sober," Dres 
said. "It's just the smart thing nowadays to have a designated driver." 
</P>
<P>
The Olympic champion was declared clinically dead two days after the accident. 
Davis was removed from life-support systems after showing no response to tests 
by doctors, said Jacques Charbonneau, a Notre Dame Hospital spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Family and friends are questioning a police statement on the accident and have 
hired a top criminal lawyer, Raphael Schachter. 
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be a flagrant contradiction as to what appears to be the 
position of the authorities, in determining that the incident was a simple 
traffic accident, and the facts that have been made available to me," Schachter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A police statement released Saturday night said the driver of the car "was 
unable to avoid hitting the man, who was standing nearly in the middle of the 
street." (Story, C2.) 
</P>
<P>
The statement said the fatal crash was not considered a hit-and-run because the 
driver, a 19-year-old man, reported immediately to a nearby police station. 
Davis' family believes another of the three men in the car may have been 
driving, and the car taken to police was not the one that struck Davis. 
</P>
<P>
The swimmer's girlfriend, Donna Clavel, 22, has said Davis was run down by a 
car carrying three men who had earlier flirted with Clavel and a friend, 
Jennifer Watt.

Steve McCarthy, who lost a fight to a shoe wielded by an opponent's mother, 
withdrew from the rematch today because of the flu. 
</P>
<P>
"He is genuinely ill," said Jack Bishop, McCarthy's manager. "He's very sick." 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy was to have fought Tony Wilson on Wednesday in a rematch of their 
light-heavyweight fight in September that was halted when Wilson's mother 
climbed into the ring and clobbered McCarthy with a high-heeled shoe. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy needed four stitches in his head and refused to continue the bout, 
which made headlines round the world. The referee awarded the fight to Wilson, 
and his decision was upheld by the British Boxing Board of Control. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's mother, Minna, apologized for her behavior and said she would never 
attend one of her son's fights again. 
</P>
<P>
She said she was reacting to chants she regarded as racist from members of the 
crowd in Southampton. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilsons, from Wolverhampton in the English midlands, are black. McCarthy, 
from Southampton, is white.

DISMISSED ACADEMIC ADVISER LOSES SUIT AGAINST UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: WOMAN ALLEGES SHE WAS FIRED FOR INVESTIGATING RECORDS OF STUDENT 
ATHLETES.

<TEXT>
<P>
A federal jury returned a verdict in favor of the University of Nebraska in the 
case of an academic adviser who sued the school and top officials, claiming she 
was fired for investigating the records of student athletes. 
</P>
<P>
The jury of four men and three women returned the verdict Monday in favor of 
University General Studies supervisor Dr. Donald Gregory and Vice Chancellor 
James Griesen in the suit filed by Mary Jane Visser, a 19-year employee. 
</P>
<P>
University attorney David Buntain said the verdict vindicates Gregory and 
Griesen, "both dedicated public servants, and it shows the strength of our jury 
system that they were able to wade through eight days of testimony and 200 
exhibits and come to a just result." 
</P>
<P>
Visser's attorney, Thom Cope, said today he fears that the jury's decision 
might make other UNL employees afraid to speak up for their rights. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe Mary Jane Visser was right from day one, and I still believe that to 
this day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cope said he is still considering his options, but noted that he's waiting for 
an expected ruling from U.S. District Judge Warren K. Urbom, who presided over 
the case, on the sex discrimination part of the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The jury decided against her claim of sex discrimination under Title VII of the 
Civil Rights Act, but that part of the verdict was advisory and not binding on 
any decision the judge might make, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cope said Visser still could receive back pay and her job back if Urbom rules 
in her favor on the civil rights matter. 
</P>
<P>
Visser filed suit against the university shortly after her termination in 
September, 1988. She claims she was fired after she began investigating the 
academic records of student-athletes. University officials said Visser was 
dismissed for poor work habits, including tardiness, doing personal business on 
work time and unexplained absences. 
</P>
<P>
In closing arguments last week, Cope told the jury that when Visser began 
raising questions about the athletic department, "the rules started changing." 
</P>
<P>
He said her concern with student athletes dated back to 1985 when she began 
seeing the same students in academic trouble over and over again. 
</P>
<P>
In his closing, Buntain said Visser was not able to accept criticism. 
</P>
<P>
Buntain contended that she started reviewing student athletes' records as a 
vendetta against the university. 
</P>
<P>
Buntain said he doubted the verdict would be appealed. "The issues were fact 
issues which would make an appeal difficult."

ALWUHUSH RUNS MONSTER RACE IN BURKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Judging from his performance Monday in the $224,400 Carleton F. Burke Handicap, 
Alwuhush is aptly named. 
</P>
<P>
In Arabic, Alwuhush means monster and the Nureyev colt certainly terrorized his 
nine opponents in the Grade I stake on closing day of the Oak Tree meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Ridden by Jose Santos for Hall of Fame trainer Angel Penna, the Virginia-bred 
4-year-old pulled away in the stretch and won by 4 1/2 lengths before 23,634. 
</P>
<P>
After skipping the Breeders' Cup Turf, Alwuhush covered the mile and a quarter 
on the turf in 1:58, two ticks slower than Brown Bess did in winning the Yellow 
Ribbon on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Never far behind pace-setter Speedratic, despite being very wide coming down 
the hillside, the 9-2 second choice took command with two furlongs to run and 
cruised to his fifth victory in 16 races. 
</P>
<P>
He is one for one for Penna, who has trained notables such as Allez France, 
Waya, Relaxing, Private Account and Bold Reason, among others. Campaigned in 
Europe as a 2- and 3-year-old, Alwuhush joined his new barn after finishing a 
distant third in the Man o' War at Belmont in his first U.S. start Sept. 23. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't find out he wasn't going to be able to run in the Breeders' Cup until 
I got to Florida," Penna said. "But I think this is better for the horse. We 
had another week this way. Now I think we'll stay for the Hollywood Turf Cup 
(next month). 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he had some speed and there wasn't much speed in the race, so I was 
glad to see him up close to the pace." 
</P>
<P>
Santos was happy about the Burke and its $134,400 winner's share, but he would 
have loved a shot at the $2-million Turf at Gulfstream Park Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he could have won that day," the jockey said. "He impressed me. I've 
been working him and every time I've gotten on him he's improved. He just took 
off at the quarter pole. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a real good course. It's real fast and the horse handled it well. He 
never bobbled and horses used to it do that a lot here." 
</P>
<P>
Frankly Perfect, the lukewarm 3-1 favorite, outran Speedratic by half a length 
for second. Haut Arandu was another nose back in fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Making his first start since being beaten by a whisker in the Sunset Handicap 
at Hollywood Park, Frankly Perfect had no real mishaps in his first race with 
Chris McCarron aboard. 
</P>
<P>
"He finished strongly," McCarron said. "He was very strong the whole way. I had 
a little traffic to negotiate or I think he would have been a little closer 
second." 
</P>
<P>
Pranke, who upset Frankly Perfect in the Sunset, tore the suspensory ligaments 
in his left front leg in the stretch and had to taken from the track in a van. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no fracture and he's remarkably comfortable," Mark McCreary, assistant 
to trainer Eddie Gregson said later from the barn. "We'll have to see what 
happens in the next 24-48 hours." 
</P>
<P>
Pranke, a 5-year-old son of Cipayo, was fitted with a splint and the concern is 
whether the blood supply to the injured area remains good. 
</P>
<P>
Although Pranke would have posed no danger to Alwuhush, Laffit Pincay thinks he 
might have been second. 
</P>
<P>
"He was really moving," he said. "Then, he just took a bad step. I could feel 
it going, but I had trouble pulling him up." 
</P>
<P>
Oak Tree's 32-day season ended with increases in both daily average attendance 
and handle. 
</P>
<P>
The average total attendance, including the nine inter-track locations, was 
28,475, up slightly more than 5% over 1988. The average handle was an Oak Tree 
record $6,268,268, a bit more than 5% higher than last year. 
</P>
<P>
On-track, however, the numbers were down a bit. The average attendance in 
Arcadia was 21,903, down 1.6% and the average handle of $5,016,340 was off 
two-tenths of a percent from 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased with the increases in overall daily average attendance and 
handle, as well as the increases at the inter-track locations alone," said Ray 
Rogers, Oak Tree's executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"But just as important is that our on-track business was virtually even with 
last year, which is against the general trend we've seen since the introduction 
of inter-track wagering." 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Delahoussaye made it two straight riding titles with 40 victories. 
Russell Baze was second with 28 and Robbie Davis third with 26. 
</P>
<P>
"(Agent) Terry (Lipham) has been working hard and doing well, we've been having 
some luck and I've been riding well," said Delahoussaye, who also won the Del 
Mar crown. "It's just a combination of things. It's exciting. You're riding 
with the best jockeys in the world and to be on top is a great achievement." 
</P>
<P>
Ron McAnally, also repeating what he'd done at Del Mar, was the top trainer, 
picking up 13 wins, three more than Gregson and four more than Ron Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
Present Value, who upset Rahy in the Ramser and Goodwood Handicaps, and 
Hawkster, spectacular in winning the Oak Tree Invitational, were among the 
winners in best of the Oak Tree meeting balloting by reporters. Besides being 
named top grass horse, Hawkster was also selected the best 3-year-old. Other 
winners included: Brown Bess, older filly or mare, grass filly or mare; 
Akinemod, 3-year-old filly; Grand Canyon, 2-year-old; Dominant Dancer, 
2-year-old filly; Prime Concord, claimer; Sam Who, sprinter; Effusive Bounty, 
development; Oak Tree Invitational, race; Eddie Delahoussaye, jockey; Ron 
McAnally, trainer, and Jesus Castanon, apprentice. 
</P>
<P>
Oak Tree Notes 
</P>
<P>
Alwuhush paid $11.40, $5.40 and $4 and the exacta coupling him with Frankly 
Perfect was worth $126. . . . Apprentice rider Kim Eldridge picked up her first 
victory at Santa Anita when she guided Al Capital to a wire-to-wire, $33 upset 
in the third race. A 23-year-old native of Washington, she had ridden three 
previous races locally. She had won two other races before at Bay Meadows and 
Sacramento, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Pay The Butler and Hawkster left Monday for Japan to prepare for their 
engagement in the Japan Cup Nov. 26. Pay The Butler, the defending champion, 
worked seven furlongs in 1:25 4/5 Monday morning before leaving. . . . After a 
day of rest, Hollywood Park will open its abbreviated fall-winter meeting 
Wednesday. First post is 1 p.m. and the season will run through Christmas Eve.

ALMANAC / PAYING CASH FOR HOMES: NUMBER OF CASH SALES IN CALIFORNIA JUMPS 14% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of homes purchased in California without recorded financing jumped 
14% in the first eight months of 1989, compared with the same period last year. 
In the seven Southland counties, the booming Inland Empire experienced a 
tremendous increase in cash sales, while the more expensive coastal areas saw 
declines -- 32% in the case of Orange County. Price appears to be the key 
factor, according to a survey by TRW Real Estate Information Services. The more 
expensive a home is, the less likely it is to be bought without financing. 
All-cash homebuyers generally fall into two groups: the wealthy and 
"empty-nesters" who are cashing in on the equity built up in their homes.
