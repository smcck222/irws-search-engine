Photo, Grounded and in a Fog: Heavy fog covered Orange County on Wednesday 
morning, closing John Wayne Airport and tangling the rush-hour commute. 
"Visibility here is zero," Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Joe Davies 
said at 8:30 a.m. from the airport. Early flights were canceled or delayed. Air 
commuters had to adjust their plans, creating a jam at telephones. Carole White 
and Ken Julius (above) waited it out at a window, and Phil McCarty of El Toro

Over the years, the USC-UCLA game has inspired such pranks as the defacing of 
each school's mascots, the printing of fake notices canceling each other's pep 
rallies and, in one case, an aerial fertilizer drop. 
</P>
<P>
The rivalry this week is reflected in several anti-UCLA jibes sprinkled 
throughout 28th Street, an off-campus newspaper billed as USC's "Voice of the 
Row." 
</P>
<P>
A section titled, "What They Say Vs. What They Mean," includes such lines as: 
</P>
<P>
"When your high school friend says, 'I think UCLA has more to offer me than 
USC,' she means, 'Dad lost $10,000 in the stock market crash and can't afford 
USC."' 
</P>
<P>
However, USC's academic reputation wasn't enhanced by one student who said his 
school was superior to UCLA because "I don't think they (UCLA) have even won us 
twice over the past eight years." 
</P>
<P>
That's a tough punch line to beaten. 
</P>
<P>
Fantasy and reality in L.A.:

Tom Bratter of Palms points out that the exterior depicted as the home of the 
TV station in the series, "WIOU," is the old Hollywood Citizen-News building. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, La Opinion, the Spanish-language daily, has moved into the Title 
Guaranty and Trust Building, which was the mythical headquarters of the "Los 
Angeles Tribune" in the TV show, "Lou Grant." 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, lots of non-newspaper scenes continue to be shot in the ornate 
lobby of the old L.A. Herald-Examiner building. 
</P>
<P>
James Brodhead of Sherman Oaks has noticed a strange phenomenon associated with 
model homes. Many lack driveways. Yes, here in Freeway City. Instead, Brodhead 
pointed out, the garage doors are "blocked by lawns, pathways, flower beds." 
Why? he asks. 
</P>
<P>
The answer is that the garage is often used as an office by the salespeople. 
</P>
<P>
There's another factor, though we're certain it's a minor consideration. You'll 
notice (in the accompanying photo) that the front yard looks quite a bit bigger 
without a driveway. And more attractive to would-be buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, once they're sold, even model homes are required by law to add driveways. 
</P>
<P>
Our note about the new "Only in Beverly Hills" newspaper column at Beverly 
Hills High started us wondering, for purely selfish reasons, about the origin 
of the phrase, "Only in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
It's no doubt a regionalism derived from "Only in America," a phrase that bore 
a rags-to-riches connotation. 
</P>
<P>
"Only in L.A.," of course, connotes oddballs and eccentrics. Our investigation 
is continuing, but we did find a mention in the the 1974 movie, "Chinatown." 
</P>
<P>
In one scene, detective Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) eyes a body in the morgue 
and mutters: 
</P>
<P>
"Middle of a drought and the water commissioner drowns -- only in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
From our file of Forgotten Traffic Solutions:

"Word has come from San Diego that the district attorney has determined that 
fast racing between L.A. and San Diego must stop," the Auto Club's Touring 
Topics reported in 1909. 
</P>

"He is said to have deputized a number of farmers residing along the route . . 
. to keep a watchful eye on speeding motorists."

Stupid Bureaucrat Tricks: Weeks after requesting a report from Sacramento, an 
L.A. City Council aide was told by a state official, "I'm sorry I haven't done 
that work. I've been busy at productivity meetings."

<P>
Speaking of stupid, on Wednesday we mistakenly called the late Wild Bill 
Davison a clarinetist. Bill Hux, Rockey Spicer and several other faithful fans 
of his called to say that Wild Bill was a cornetist.

IN DEFENSE OF RONALD REAGAN

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In answer to the letters of Shirley Wolf and Phil Pister on naming the new 
state building for Ronald Reagan (Nov. 8): 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it is entirely fitting that the man who governed California so well as his 
fiscal policies proved, a man who as President bankrupted the entire Eastern 
Bloc, a man who removed the threat of atomic warfare between the Soviet Union 
and the U.S., thus saving hundreds of millions from annihilation or perhaps 
saving the human race, a man who caused the Communist tyrants to be deposed in 
so many countries -- yes, it is entirely fitting that the new Los Angeles state 
building be named in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
In fact this honor is not even enough of a tribute for the accomplishments of 
Reagan. The whole world should acknowledge what this great American did for it.

DEFEAT OF BIG GREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times reported (Nov. 7) that in conceding defeat of Prop. 128 initiative 
backers charged: "The opposition campaign financed largely by chemical and oil 
companies had succeeded in confusing the voters." Blaming the chemical and oil 
companies is truly a cop-out for an initiative that was confusing enough 
without any opposition campaign. 
</P>
<P>
In all probability, if the oil companies campaigned for Prop. 128, it would 
have lost by an even wider margin. 
</P>
<P>
The lessons from Prop. 128 should be etched in the minds of future supporters 
and authors of initiatives. They should learn to address a single subject that 
can be thoroughly understood by the voting public. Each area addressed by Prop. 
128 (offshore oil drilling, old-growth redwood preservation, environmental 
advocate, etc.) is a worthwhile cause that voters do care about. However, 
together these subjects form an unwieldy combination with unclear fiscal and 
administrative responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
The other important lesson to be learned is that future initiative supporters 
must be able to clarify what the proposition entails. The campaign for Prop. 
128 never gave voters confidence that the backers could even understand all its 
implications and costs. 
</P>
<P>
Most people wanted more specifics on cost and implementation that the 
opposition was only too happy to provide based on their biased viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
The vote against Prop. 128 was not a vote against the environment or 
Assemblyman Tom Hayden. It was a vote against poorly written, "do all" 
propositions and poor campaign tactics.

DEFEAT OF BIG GREEN

<TEXT>
<P>
The oil, chemical and agriculture industries spent millions to defeat Prop. 
128. Also, The Times advocated a vote against Big Green. 
</P>
<P>
Critics said it was too complex. They are right. It is a complex issue. Critics 
said the wording was flawed. They were right. But what can we expect when we 
are forced to legislate via the initiative process because strong lobbies with 
conflicting interests immobilize our elected officials? 
</P>
<P>
Critics also said it would be very costly. They were right. However, it has 
become so costly because we have ignored environmental issues for so long. What 
the critics neglected to say is the cost of not cleansing the environment of 
cancer-causing chemicals and pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, Prop. 128 has alerted us to the danger of chemicals and will help 
educate us about their proper use. We must tell our elected representatives and 
our newly elected governor that now is the time for action.

FOOD FOR THOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The notion is nothing if not novel and visceral. But it may help others better 
understand the pervasiveness and dimensions of world hunger. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight in Hollywood 200 movie stars and celebrities will pay $150 each to 
attend a fancy banquet. And not so fancy. Only a few will get to dine on the 
gourmet three-course meal. Nearly one-third will have to make do with rice and 
beans, a standard dinner in many developing countries. And a majority of the 
guests will sit on the floor and use their hands to eat rice and water, the 
most common meal in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Who gets to eat what will be decided by drawing straws. 
</P>
<P>
That's the idea of The Hollywood Hunger Banquet, a celebrity charity event 
co-chaired by actors Danny Glover and Edward James Olmos and scheduled in West 
Hollywood and three other cities elsewhere in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The Oxfam-backed exercise is designed to call attention to how food is 
distributed today throughout the world -- and to raise money for the hungry. 
While 15% of the world population routinely eat well, according to Oxfam 
America, 30% eat simply, and the 55% who live in the poorest nations eat 
whatever they can. World hunger is not limited to starving babies in Ethiopia, 
a popular misconception. Millions of people -- one out of five -- are so 
chronically malnourished they cannot lead productive lives. Thousands of people 
-- the majority of them little girls under 5 -- die from hunger and related 
diseases every day. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt the Hollywood dinner is a gimmick. But it got our attention -- and 
now, perhaps yours.

Until last Sunday I'd never seen the Vietnam War memorial in Sacramento. The 
bronze statues and reliefs are striking: a nurse bending over some poor fellow 
who's just had his arm sawed off; a B-52 with 750-pounders trickling earthward 
from its bomb doors; a GI reading, to judge from his expression, a Dear John 
letter; a POW. The names of California's dead in that war run the circumference 
of the memorial's outside walls. A parks worker was wiping the dust off them 
with a swatch of newspaper, watched by three men who looked like Vietnam vets. 
</P>
<P>
The day before, I'd read another call from Henry Kissinger for the United 
States to go to war in the gulf, with bombers heading for Baghdad and those 
"surgical strikes" that Kissinger loves to summon in his prose. Many of the 
names on the wall in front of me belonged to men who died in Vietnam after 
Richard Nixon came to power in 1969, Kissinger in tow. 
</P>
<P>
I walked round to see if San Clemente, whence flowed some of the orders that 
ended in those deaths, had paid human tribute to Nixon's and Kissinger's 
concepts of national security and honor. There were two: "Lt. Whynaught, 
Jeffrey L. 22" and "S.P.4 Goodman, Greg F. 22." One often forgets how young are 
the soldiers sent to war. Whynaught and Goodman were senior to many of the 
names around them, hundreds of boys in their late teens. 
</P>
<P>
There's no doubt that the national sentiment now is not for war. In Congress 
they say the mail from constituents is running 5-1 or 10-to-1 against. The 
majority don't see the point of it, fear the consequences of it, yet many are 
fatalistic. Send that big a force to the gulf, one often hears, and war is 
bound to break out. The President and his secretary of state amplify the 
rhetorical tempo of doom as they invoke the failure of sanctions "so far" and 
claim the consensus of the world that stiffer measures are justified. 
</P>
<P>
Little bits of news or gossip augment the sense of menacing buildup. A 
newspaper in New Jersey reports that nurses in hospitals around Maguire Air 
Force Base are being put on 24-hour alert to expect casualties; a White House 
staffer tells a foreign journalist that one of the first targets of U.S. 
bombers over Baghdad would be the satellite uplinks. They don't want footage of 
carnage coming through on CNN, or real-time interviews with the Iraqi leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing that everyone knows there's no consensus at home, George Bush and James 
Baker exaggerate the degree of consensus abroad. Put the self-interest of Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher and the British aside -- the Sabahs treat London as 
their money center and are a big prop to the pound sterling -- and this 
consensus is where it was in mid-August. Germany, France and the other Common 
Market countries, plus the Soviets, support U.N. sanctions but as yet, nothing 
further. The effort to alter Japan's constitution in order to send a token 
force collapsed in failure. Turkey's prime minister stresses that Turkey is not 
interested in being one launch point for attack. 
</P>
<P>
In Egypt and Saudi Arabia, some now question whether it is in the Arab interest 
to have Iraq devastated as it was by the Mongol Halagu in the 13th Century at 
the fall of the Abbasid Caliphate. Such destruction -- called for by the 
Kissinger war claque -- would leave Israel as the unchallenged military power 
in the region, with Iran as a potential threat. 
</P>
<P>
So there is no international agreement as yet for anything beyond the U.N. 
sanctions, despite the huff-puff rhetoric from Baker, nor is there significance 
in the suggestion that these sanctions are not working. At the time they were 
first imposed the most optimistic timetable was, and still is, that Iraq would 
come under serious pressure only by next February or March or maybe even later 
in the year. 
</P>
<P>
The timetable of the war party has always been brisk. Abuse of the War Powers 
Act to launch a war the people don't want is best done swiftly, under cover of 
darkness, as Kissinger well knows. The timetable of the peace party has always 
been measured: adopt sanctions, enforce them, be open to negotiating proposals 
that could settle the crisis without further violence, reduce the vast U.S. 
ground deployment in Saudi Arabia and have any remainder under U.N. command. 
</P>
<P>
Though there have been negotiating proposals and diplomatic opportunities, it's 
amazing how Bush has wedged himself into the "no compromise" posture that cost 
so many lives in Vietnam. If the voices of restraint here had been as powerful 
in the early 1960s as they are today, those memorial walls in Sacramento and 
Washington need never have been, and countless Vietnamese would still be alive. 
Such voices should double in power now, lest new memorials be built tomorrow.

PERSPECTIVE ON MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN A HERO LETS US DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM RASPBERRY, William Raspberry is a syndicated columnist based in 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Of course it matters that Martin Luther King Jr. appears to have plagiarized 
important sections of his doctoral dissertation. It won't change (though it may 
be used to justify) the opinions of those who never thought him worthy of 
adulation. It won't make him less of a hero (though it will certainly render 
him more human) to his legions of admirers. 
</P>
<P>
But it matters -- matters a great deal -- and those who say otherwise may be 
yielding to wishful thinking. As a certified King admirer, I was among those 
whose first reaction to the revelation of his probable academic cheating was to 
insist that it was no big deal. My admiration, I told myself, was based not on 
his scholarship: It was based on his leadership of perhaps the most important 
social movement in the history of this country, on the eloquence of his words 
and actions that moved America to rethink its racial attitudes, change its laws 
and refocus its fundamental dream. 
</P>
<P>
King's most important contribution, I reminded myself, was his gift of courage: 
the courage to resist -- and to inspire countless others to resist -- the Jim 
Crow laws that had seemed a permanent way of life in the Deep South; the 
courage to stand up (or to go limp in passive resistance) against threats of 
jail, economic reprisal and physical harm; the courage to look his own 
impending death in the eye and still go forward with his campaign for racial 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
I still admire him for that. But I also admired King the scholar, a man to whom 
philosophical ideas and political action seemed inseparable, who was as willing 
to borrow the seminal ideas of the great theologians as to appropriate the 
nonviolent techniques of a Gandhi. I treasured his courage, but I also 
treasured the ideas that lay behind the courage and the words that gave it 
force. I have used his example to impress on young people the value of 
scholarship and to tell them (and myself) that intellectual integrity is no 
less valuable than physical courage. 
</P>
<P>
So it cannot be inconsequential that his scholarship and his intellectual 
integrity are now called into question. In one area, at least, my hero has let 
me down, and it makes me sad. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't that I had thought King perfect, or that I joined those who willfully 
overlooked his shortcomings -- or who contended that anyone else should. His 
storied fondness for women and his marital cheating did not, for me, detract 
from either his courage or his moral leadership on the racial front. (My 
objection to the "womanizing" revelations of his friend and picked successor, 
the late Ralph David Abernathy, was not that I thought King's human weaknesses 
should be concealed but that they should not be exploited by someone King had 
let so completely inside and so completely trusted.) 
</P>
<P>
The newest revelations are different, because they call into question not 
King's weaknesses but his strengths. Claybourne Carson, the Stanford University 
researcher picked by King's widow to head the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers 
Project, and a committed admirer of King, has been forced to acknowledge that 
"several" of the martyr's papers, as well as his dissertation, "contain 
numerous appropriated passages that can be defined as plagiarism." 
</P>
<P>
It's a bitter fact that the revelation comes just after the defeat of an 
Arizona bill to make King's birthday an official holiday. It will be used as 
evidence that the Arizona voters were right. 
</P>
<P>
They weren't. The importance of the proposed bill was that it honored America's 
foremost black leader. It was not based on King's reputation as a scholar, but 
on the undeniable fact of his leadership. And those who voted against it would 
not have voted differently if Claybourne Carson's scholars had disclosed that 
the theologian Paul Tillich had stolen from King's work, rather than the other 
way around. Evidence after the fact does not alter the racism implicit in what 
happened in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
But I cannot say it doesn't matter. King the scholar has been diminished, even 
if King the leader stands as tall as ever. I suppose we can draw lessons from 
the revelations -- just as we draw lessons from the discovery that other people 
we admire turn out to have their feet of clay. We need to understand that our 
heroes are, after all, human beings. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't alter my sadness that for now, and in one area of his 
still-astounding career, my hero let me down.

<P>
Three days after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, a senior White House official 
sighed: "At least Congress is out of town." The President, crossing the White 
House lawn from his helicopter, was asked by reporters how he planned to 
respond. He snapped back, "Listen, watch and learn." 
</P>
<P>
That has set the tone. It has been the President's business: personal and 
private. But now that there soon may be 400,000 U.S. personnel in the Persian 
Gulf region, it is time to involve 535 other Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Congress can clarify U.S. policy. Only Congress can legitimize 
offensive action with forces this numerous. 
</P>
<P>
It was nearly eight years after the first U.S. casualties in Vietnam before 
U.S. forces there numbered 400,000. When Allied leaders met at Casablanca 13 
months after Pearl Harbor, neither MacArthur in the Pacific nor Eisenhower in 
Europe had more than 350,000 U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
The problem today with Desert Shield is not that U.S. forces were deployed too 
quickly, without congressional ratification. Halting Iraq required haste. But 
the President simultaneously stipulated the purpose of the deployment to be not 
mere containment but the unconditional withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait, and 
restoration of Kuwait's regime, to be achieved by military force if economic 
sanctions did not suffice. 
</P>
<P>
The 1973 War Powers Act triggers congressional consultation and ratification or 
termination of deployment initiated by presidents when U.S. forces are in 
situations "where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by 
the circumstances." Is this the case now, with U.S. officers telling the troops 
to be prepared for an offensive soon? 
</P>
<P>
The President characterizes the nearly doubling of the deployment as necessary 
"to provide an adequate offensive military option" if economic sanctions fail 
over an unspecified span. But a short span is implied by the decision 
(simultaneous with the additional deployments) that troops will not be rotated 
out of the desert until the basic mission is accomplished. This means that the 
embargo is not to be given a chance to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
The wrong worry today concerns "another Vietnam," meaning a large, protracted 
conflict entered into by stealth and small increments, without congressional 
involvement. Actually, Congress debated and funded Vietnam at every stage. 
</P>
<P>
A more apposite and ominous analogy is to the outbreak of World War I, when 
mobilization acquired a deadly momentum. France set in motion 3 million men on 
4,278 trains, an intricate operation that, once begun, was almost impossible to 
modulate. When the Kaiser wanted a pause in Germany's mobilization, he was told 
it would be impossible to reroute 11,000 trains. Europe went to war because it 
had started to go toward war. 
</P>
<P>
Some people say that U.S. pronouncements and deployments that have already been 
made mean the United States will be dangerously diminished and Saddam Hussein 
dangerously enhanced if Desert Shield does not quickly achieve its objective. 
If this is the President's thinking, then the United States is heading for war 
because it has put in place the capacity for war. 
</P>
<P>
When are Americans, who have listened and watched and not learned much in three 
months, going to be told -- and sold -- clear objectives and a convincing 
rationale? 
</P>
<P>
The two undeclared wars since World War II were embittering. America entered 
World War II in its third year after Japan attacked. We entered World War I 
after direct attacks on our vital interests (freedom of the seas, the 
Lusitania), and for a comprehensible, if extravagant, goal (to make the world 
safe for democracy). 
</P>
<P>
Are Americans now to fight for the vacuity of a "new international order"? Or 
to make the Middle East safe for Kuwaiti feudalism? Even if punishing Iraqi 
aggression is a vital U.S. interest, what justifies starting a clock for action 
that precludes a full test of sanctions? 
</P>
<P>
Must Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait be followed by a reduction of Iraq's 
conventional, chemical, biological and potential nuclear capabilities? If, say, 
Pakistan has both nuclear weapons and a dangerous leader, will we then be 
bound, by the Iraqi precedent, to disarm Pakistan? 
</P>
<P>
Some supporters of untrammeled presidential discretion want it used to bomb 
Iraq just enough to degrade its power, but not enough to destabilize the 
regional balance of power. Who has the skill to apply force in such precise 
dosages? 
</P>
<P>
The War Powers Act is of dubious constitutionality and cumbersome formality, 
and the President's war of nerves with Iraq should not be undercut by a clock 
controlling when Congress must ratify or reject Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
But a comparable danger is a war begun with unclear goals and uncertain 
domestic support. Congress should be convened to listen, watch, learn, clarify 
and legitimize.

Allegations about King's extramarital exploits and recent charges of plagiarism 
of his college papers take nothing away from his accomplishments as the 
lightning rod for black Americans seeking government recognition of their 
endowed, unalienable rights. What it does is support those who felt more time 
was needed to study King's life and background before he was honored with 
national and state holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Black giants like Booker T. Washington, George Washington Carver and Frederick 
Douglass may be even more suitable subjects to honor with a holiday or other 
recognition because their lives have withstood the test of historical scrutiny.

Deep Regrets: "This is really getting kind of embarrassing," said Harry 
Thomason, co-executive producer of CBS' "Designing Women," in reference to 
Wednesday night's refueling of a feud with co-star Delta Burke during an 
interview on ABC's "The Barbara Walters Special." Burke grew teary when 
discussing how her complaints about her treatment risked "losing my career and 
my good name and the money." Thomason repeated an earlier admission that "I did 
yell and scream at her once two years ago -- and believe me, for that I am 
deeply, deeply sorry . . . I really don't know what else to say." CLAUDIA PUIG

Motions Filed: Attorneys for British heavy metal singer Ozzy Osbourne filed a 
motion Wednesday for summary judgment in a federal court in Macon, Ga., 
requesting that a multimillion-dollar product liability lawsuit against the 
rock star be dismissed. Osbourne is being sued by the parents of Michael 
Waller, a 16-year-old who took his life after allegedly hearing pro-suicide 
subliminal messages hidden in Osbourne's music. The motion states that expert 
witnesses for the plaintiff deposed in Macon last month failed to provide 
evidence of any subliminal content. CLAUDIA PUIG

Rod the Clod?: A woman is suing Rod Stewart, claiming she was hurt while 
attending a concert when the British rock singer kicked a soccer ball that 
struck her in the hand. Patricia Boughton, 37, of Utica, Mich., said she 
suffered a ruptured tendon in her middle finger and a possible break when she 
was struck by a soccer ball Stewart kicked during a June 22 performance. The 
lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Oakland County Circuit Court, seeks at least $10,000 
in damages. CLAUDIA PUIG

Photo, The View From Ground Zero: Four protesters delayed the test of a British 
nuclear weapon Wednesday by infiltrating the remote Nevada Test Site and making 
their way to ground zero. The device, with an explosive force about 12 times 
that of the Hiroshima atomic bomb, was detonated more than two hours behind 
schedule. Energy Department officials rejected claims that the protesters were 
near ground zero until they popped into view of cameras monitoring the site six 
minutes from detonation. Greenpeace identified the protesters, above, as Lorna 
Richardson, 25, Juley Howard, 23 and Jane Gregory, 27, all of London. With them 
was Michael Perry, 27, of the Rocky Mountain Peace Center. The four probably 
will be charged with trespassing, Energy Department spokesman Jim Boyer said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'MESSENGER OF THE LORD' SUSPECT PLEADS NOT 
GUILTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man accused of being the "Messenger of the Lord" rapist pleaded not guilty 
Wednesday to charges that he sexually assaulted six women. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph B. Socha, 28, a graduate business student at Cal State Dominguez Hills, 
is charged with 28 counts of robbery, kidnaping and sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
He denied all of the charges at an arraignment Wednesday in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Arthur Jean ordered Socha to remain in custody without 
bail and scheduled a Jan. 2 trial. 
</P>
<P>
At Socha's preliminary hearing last month, four women identified him as the man 
who sexually assaulted them in August and September in Long Beach and San 
Pedro. The district attorney's office later filed additional charges against 
Socha stemming from sexual assaults on two more women. Those assaults occurred 
in August in Long Beach and Inglewood, prosecutors said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police are searching for the son of a North Hollywood man whose 
badly beaten body was found this week dumped in the hills above Studio City, 
authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Dominguez, 19, was being sought for questioning in the death of his father, 
Alexander Dominguez, 46, said Lt. Ron La Rue. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives searching the Dominguez residence, which the father and son shared, 
found evidence of a struggle, La Rue said. But he would not say if the youth 
was a suspect in his father's death. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Alexander Dominguez, a painter, was found wrapped in a blanket 
Tuesday in a brushy area near the 7800 block of Mulholland Drive. Police said 
he had been dead at least two days.

JUDGE REJECTS LANCASTER'S LAST CHALLENGES TO PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge gave state corrections officials another victory Wednesday in their 
fight to build a state prison in Lancaster, rejecting the remaining challenges 
in a suit brought by the city of Lancaster and Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge John Zebrowski denied a request to order the 
state to build only a medium-security prison, rather than the maximum- and 
medium-security facility now planned. 
</P>
<P>
The opponents also demanded that state officials expand a planned "greenbelt" 
to shield the 2,200-bed facility from the surrounding neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, which Zebrowski issued without comment, resolves the second part 
of a lawsuit filed by Lancaster and the county in January. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a judge ruled in the state's favor on challenges by Lancaster and 
the county to an environmental review of the 252-acre site in west Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Grading began at the site earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
The only remaining legal recourse for opponents -- who say that the prison will 
hurt the Antelope Valley's economy, infrastructure and image -- is to appeal 
the rulings. 
</P>
<P>
An appeal of the environmental ruling has been filed and will be heard sometime 
in the spring, when work will have already begun on a $50-million contract for 
the prison's housing units. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we are disappointed," said David Mann, a lawyer for the city of 
Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
He said the city will consider appealing Zebrowski's decision and consolidating 
that effort with the appeal on environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
City and county lawyers still hope that an appellate court will temporarily 
halt construction and order a new environmental review, Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
They believe that the findings of a new study could lead to a compromise 
agreement to choose a less populated site in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But both sides say that chances of blocking the prison are diminishing as 
construction progresses. 
</P>
<P>
Even if an appellate court requires the state to upgrade the environmental 
review, lawyers said, justices may be less likely to delay construction that is 
well under way. 
</P>
<P>
"A court would give that serious consideration," Deputy Atty. Gen. Robert Mukai 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Wednesday morning hearing, Zebrowski questioned the argument by lawyers 
for Lancaster that 1987 legislation, which created the prison and a companion 
prison in East Los Angeles, permits only a medium-security institution. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Van Blarcam, a city lawyer, argued that the bill did not specify a 
security level. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, corrections officials were bound by previous legislation 
calling for a medium-security prison. 
</P>
<P>
In response, Mukai argued that the law gives discretion on security level to 
the Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation authorizing construction of several other prisons did not specify 
security level, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancaster prison is scheduled to begin operating in 1992.

REFLECTIONS: TRYING TO BE THE MODEL SINGLE MOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Perry C. Riddle 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lorena Diaz is a single parent struggling to launch a modeling career. Chance 
Adam Diaz, her 3-year-old son, enjoys going along on interviews, and sometimes 
he gets the job. They live in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
I started working when I was 13 years old. I worked for the city, cleaning up 
parks -- the boots and the jeans and the gloves and the helmet and the little 
vest, the whole outfit. We worked the hottest hours of the day in the 
summertime, carrying dirt from one place to another, clearing the horse trails 
of the weeds and everything. 
</P>
<P>
I thought: "Oh my gosh, this is terrible. No wonder everybody hates to work." 
But after that, all my jobs were easy, because that was so difficult. 
</P>
<P>
My parents were able to afford a lot of things for us, but I wanted a special 
kind of jeans and my own shampoo and everything. I was able to buy my own 
things even when I still lived at home. 
</P>
<P>
That's pretty much what I thought of then, just being able to buy what I want 
to buy and wear what I want to wear and look how I want to look. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since ninth grade I wanted to be a model. When I was younger, and still 
now, when I think of modeling I think of modeling beautiful $1,000 outfits like 
they do in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
I moved out when I was about 17 years old, and then I had a baby when I was 18, 
and it was the greatest thing in the world. I'm happier than I ever thought I 
could be. I've always wanted a baby, ever since I was little. I used to play 
with my dolls until I was in the 7th grade. 
</P>
<P>
But being a single parent has its bad points. Sometimes I get depressed, and I 
think, "Oh, no," when I'm rushing around late. But every other time it's fine, 
because I'm just glad I had him. I'm glad it didn't go any other way. 
</P>
<P>
I started weightlifting just to keep in shape. I work out three nights a week, 
and I go to Bible study on Tuesday at my mom's house. It's nice, because the 
last time I can remember my family all together like that was when I was 12 
years old at dinner time. 
</P>
<P>
It's not really religion to me; it's just getting closer to God and reading the 
Bible. It made me a better person in a lot of ways -- just being a better mom 
to my son, not getting angry all the time and just being more patient with him. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer I heard on the radio about the Hispanic Model Search. I went on the 
interview and I took my portfolio, and they just asked me a few questions, so, 
"Maybe we'll call you." I said. "Thank you." So they called me. I was in the 
contest. That was the one in Montebello for J.C. Penney. 
</P>
<P>
I just did my best, and I had lots of fun with it. I smiled a lot, and I won. I 
was surprised, I was shocked and I was so happy. I felt like Miss America when 
they gave me my roses, walking down the aisle. I never really experienced 
anything like that before. 
</P>
<P>
They told us if you win you go to Dallas for the big final. I thought if I win 
it will be great. If I lose it won't be a big deal, because then I won't have 
to go on the airplane. But then I won, and that was my first time on an 
airplane, my first time out of the state, so I got a lot of things out of it. 
</P>
<P>
When they announced the winner, we were standing there smiling, and I wanted to 
cry. When you want something really bad, it affects you. But at the same time, 
I wasn't really surprised because everyone did so well. 
</P>
<P>
My son is the most important thing to me. He's great, he's a character, and he 
looks just like me and he does everything like me. He goes out on interviews 
with me a lot. He did a diaper commercial when he was a year and a half old, 
and he did great. They loved him. He sees himself on TV, and he'll go, "There I 
am, my 'mercial, my 'mercial." 
</P>
<P>
He goes when I go, and then I go with him. I think either he'll make it or I'll 
make it. Whichever one, it'll be good. If he makes it, that'll be enough.

BURBANK OKS 129-HOUSE PROJECT; 
</P>
<P>
VERDUGO HILLS: THE CITY WILL WITHHOLD A GRADING PERMIT FOR THE SITE UNTIL THE 
BUILDER PROVES THAT HE WILL REPLACE A FEDERALLY PROTECTED WETLANDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mired for nearly eight years in bitter public debate, a proposal to build 129 
luxury homes in the Verdugo Mountains above Burbank has been given the City 
Council's reluctant blessing, but the developer was forbidden to begin 
construction until he proves that wetlands on the site will be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 3 to 1, with Councilman Robert Bowne abstaining, the council 
Tuesday approved Sherman Whitmore's controversial plans for 117 acres he owns 
in Cabrini Canyon. But the council directed the city's public works director to 
withhold a grading permit until Whitmore can show that he has offset the 
potential destruction of 1.4 acres of federally protected wetlands which will 
be destroyed when 2.2 million cubic yards of dirt are bulldozed. 
</P>
<P>
Whitmore is required by federal law to create or enhance at least 3 1/2 acres 
of habitat elsewhere. Although Whitmore would have been required to provide 
plans for wetlands mitigation to federal officials anyway, withholding the 
grading permit forces him to complete plans for the conservation work before 
building can start. 
</P>
<P>
Threatened with a legal challenge by Whitmore if they rejected his project, 
Mayor Thomas Flavin, Vice Mayor Michael Hastings and Councilman Tim Murphy 
approved the development. All three said before voting that their action was to 
protect the city from a lawsuit by Whitmore. Because Whitmore's project was 
tentatively approved by a previous council, current members were legally bound 
to allow the project to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Mary Lou Howard, a longtime opponent of Whitmore's plans for the 
hillside, dissented. 
</P>
<P>
Bowne abstained from discussion and voting after several people at the meeting 
questioned whether he had reserved one of the lots in Whitmore's tract. 
</P>
<P>
Bowne denied the allegations, saying he excused himself to avoid "the 
unnecessary and unfair criticism" of a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Whitmore has fought for nearly eight years for city permission to build the 
houses. The proposal generated widespread opposition from conservationists, who 
wanted the hillside area left undeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
In a final effort to quash the project, more than 50 opponents crowded the City 
Council chambers and hinted that they may pursue legal action to reverse the 
council's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Do not allow the threat of litigation to sway you because there is potential 
for litigation from both sides," said Connie Wilson of the Burbank Mountain 
Reserve Protection Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Council members spent nearly an hour Tuesday grilling City Attorney Joseph 
Fletcher in hopes of finding legal grounds to reject Whitmore's project. But 
Fletcher said the council was legally bound to approve it.

NBA ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
DIFFERENT DAY, DIFFERENT BIRD FOR THE CELTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Most players and teams dislike playing on successive nights in different 
cities. In fact, Cleveland protested about playing back-to-back 26 times this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers were sent a revised schedule, and now they play 27 times on 
consecutive nights. 
</P>
<P>
But Boston's Larry Bird was grateful for the chance to play the night after one 
of the worst games of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Bird, who scored only five points in 28 minutes when the Boston Celtics were 
overwhelmed in Milwaukee Tuesday night, made amends in spectacular fashion 
Wednesday night at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Bird scored 45 points in 44 minutes to lead the Celtics to a 135-126 victory 
over the Charlotte Hornets. Bird, who was 18 for 28, also had eight assists, 
eight rebounds and blocked five shots. 
</P>
<P>
Bird may have relished back-to-back games, but the Hornets didn't. They didn't 
really have time to enjoy Tuesday's romp over Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Bird didn't seem to impress himself. "I took a lot of shots and that's why I 
got a lot of points," he explained. "I haven't been taking many shots 
recently." 
</P>
<P>
He shot only seven times in his five-point effort against Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Chris Ford was unhappy with the Celtic defense. "Fortunately," he said, 
"Larry brought us through." 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 112, Milwaukee 95 -- The Bucks didn't think much of back-to-back 
games, either. They were flat in East Rutherford, N.J., after having trounced 
the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Coleman, No. 1 pick in the draft last summer, sparked the Nets to an 
impressive victory. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman scored four of his 20 points in a 6-0 run that gave the Nets the lead 
for good late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 113, Indiana 95 -- The Cavaliers, who will play 16 of their first 18 
games in back-to-back sets, are adjusting to the difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
With Danny Ferry scoring two quick baskets and setting up another to trigger a 
24-5 run in the second quarter, the Cavaliers won their third in a row. 
</P>
<P>
It has been mostly downhill for the Cavaliers after opening the season at 
Boston and playing at Detroit the next night. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 112, Atlanta 104 -- After getting 23 points and 13 rebounds in a 
victory at Indiana on Tuesday, Charles Barkley was even better at home. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley scored 34 points and grabbed 13 rebounds to lead the 76ers to their 
second victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Miami 105, Dallas 93 -- Rony Seikaly carried the Heat to victory at Miami with 
30 points and 21 rebounds. It was the Heat's first victory over the Mavericks.

THE BOTTOM TEN / STEVE HARVEY: POLLS DISPUTE: WHO IS BETTER, FULLERTON OR NEW 
MEXICO STATE?

<P>
THE COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
Enough about the bottom teams. Let's be positive. After all, this is the week 
of the historic matchup between New Mexico State, ranked No. 175 in USA Today's 
Top 193, and Cal State Fullerton, ranked No. 176. 
</P>
<P>
There's disagreement among the pollsters over which is the superior team. The 
National Sports Daily gives Fullerton (1-10) a slight edge, ranking the 
Disneylanders at No. 105 in its Top 106 ratings. New Mexico State (0-10) is 
106. 
</P>
<P>
The game's in Las Cruces, N.M., meaning New Mexico State has the home desert 
advantage. Plus, the Fullertonites may have trouble adapting to all that fresh 
air. Whatever, the winner seems assured of an invitation to the Poulan Weed 
Eater Independence Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Another Weed Bowl entry could be Oregon State (1-9), a 49-point loser to USC. 
The Trojans, of course, have accepted an invitation to play UCLA Saturday in 
the Rose Bowl.

</P>
<P>
THE PROS 
</P>
<P>
It was a double humiliation for Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
First, of course, was the Giants' 31-7 leisurely romp over the outclassed Rams. 
Second was the stunning revelation by CBS announcer John Madden, a California 
resident nearly all his life, that he had never visited Disneyland. Colleague 
Pat Summerall didn't dare ask him about Knott's Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the situation grew grimmer and grimmer for Foxboro, which fell to 
the former Baltimore Colts. One of the Patsies' biggest problems is that they 
are slower than NBC's "Ten-Minute Ticker," which flashes the scores about once 
every 19.7 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Andre Ware, the third quarterback to play for the Pontiac Lions this 
year, had a disastrous debut. Not only did he throw two interceptions, but on 
an end run he obliterated the team's sideline Gatorade table. Typical rookie 
mistake.

EDMONTON GETS WELL WITH MESSIER'S RETURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Messier returned from a knee injury a month sooner than expected and 
wasted no time getting the Edmonton Oilers straightened out. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers had lost nine in a row and had the worst record in the National 
Hockey League (2-11-2). 
</P>
<P>
But Messier provided a spark Wednesday night at Edmonton. He assisted on two 
goals, then scored into an empty net with 32 seconds left, and the Oilers ended 
their longest losing streak with a 5-3 victory over Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers, who lost another star, Jari Kurri, when he elected to play in 
Italy, were 1-11 while Messier was out. 
</P>
<P>
Messier failed to score in the four games he played before being injured. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Gelinas scored the winning goal with nine minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 5, Washington 3 -- The Maple Leafs, who won only two of their first 19 
games, handed the Capitals their third loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Reid scored a short-handed goal in the first period at Toronto to help the 
Maple Leafs take a 4-1 lead. When the Capitals closed the gap in the third 
period, Reid scored again to clinch it. 
</P>
<P>
It was Toronto's second victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The Maple Leafs are 4-16-1, the Capitals 10-10-0. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 3, Detroit 2 -- Power-play goals by Michel Goulet and Frantisek Kucera 
led the Blackhawks at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
The victory enabled Chicago to regain first place in the Norris Division, one 
point ahead of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 3, Boston 1 -- One brief flurry in the third period at Hartford, 
Conn., was all the Whalers needed to win. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the 60 minutes, the Bruins outplayed the Whalers. But in 108 
seconds beginning early in the last period, Yvon Corriveau, Ron Francis and 
Dean Evason scored for Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Ray Bourque scored for the Bruins in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 6, Winnipeg 4 -- It is not surprising that the Penguins have the 
leading scorer in the league. It is surprising that in the absence of injured 
Mario Lemieux, the top scorer is John Cullen. 
</P>
<P>
Cullen, in his third NHL season, assisted on two goals at Winnipeg and has 39 
points in 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux hasn't played, but the Penguins are 10-7-2. DAN HAFNER

COMPUTER FILE: DEPRESSION THERAPY ON PC: DICEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE J. MAGID, LAWRENCE J. MAGID is a Silicon Valley-based computer 
analyst and writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Feeling depressed? Why not talk it over with your computer? 
</P>
<P>
Overcoming Depression, a $200 program for IBM PCs and compatibles, is intended 
to help "the 25% of the population who are depressed at some time in their 
lives." The program combines a text-based tutorial with the opportunity for you 
to go through a free association session with the computer as therapist. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't the first time I've seen a program designed to help people overcome 
psychological problems, but the authors' credentials, along with the price, 
prompted me to take a serious look. 
</P>
<P>
Although the program can be educational and fun, I question its therapeutic 
value and worry that, for severely depressed people, it could even be 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
The program's content was written by Dr. Kenneth M. Colby, a professor of 
psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the UCLA School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which Colby refers to as a tutorial, is organized into seven 
lessons: Negative Self-Comparisons in Depression, Mood Ratios and Value 
Dimensions, Ideal Standards, Reprogramming Yourself, Obstacles to Overcoming 
Depression, Changing Values, and Suicide and Antidepressant Medication. 
</P>
<P>
Each lesson begins with information that explains the topic so the user can 
better understand depression and how it can be overcome. 
</P>
<P>
Lesson 1 begins with an explanation of the program's goals and explains that 
"it can help in the same way that books inform you about bad-back problems or 
controlling cholesterol." 
</P>
<P>
Several screens later, the program says it can give you "specific cognitive 
strategies and tactics for working your way out of your depression" through 
"explanations, instructions, examples and homework exercises." 
</P>
<P>
In this respect, the program is no different from a book or pamphlet. Colby, a 
recognized authority, is providing tips and information that may be of value. 
</P>
<P>
After a few screens of text, however, the program asks three yes or no 
questions: "Do you feel sad frequently?" "Do you feel sad for days and weeks at 
a time?" and "Do you have a low opinion of yourself?" 
</P>
<P>
Once you've answered the questions, it goes into a dialogue mode. In other 
words, you interact with the computer, just as if it were a real therapist. You 
are instructed to "express your thoughts and feelings in your own words." 
</P>
<P>
This part of the program can be fun, and it can even lead to insights. But if 
you weren't crazy when you start using it, you're likely to be driven there by 
the way the program responds. 
</P>
<P>
The software, according to Colby, is able to comprehend about 30,000 words. If 
it recognizes the words you type, it responds in a way that its authors feel 
might be appropriate. But it makes lots of mistakes. I engaged the program in a 
discussion about being overweight. Although I'm not overweight now, the problem 
has haunted me in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Here is the transcript of the dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
Larry: I am upset because I am overweight. 
</P>
<P>
Program: What makes you so upset with yourself? 
</P>
<P>
Larry: I'm too fat. 
</P>
<P>
Program: How come you are fat? 
</P>
<P>
Larry: Because I eat too much. 
</P>
<P>
Program: When you are upset, your appetite can increase or decrease, which I 
admit is not very useful information. 
</P>
<P>
Larry: I know that. 
</P>
<P>
Program: What else can you say about what you know in this regard? 
</P>
<P>
Larry: I think I would feel better if I were thin. 
</P>
<P>
Program: Why are you thin? 
</P>
<P>
Larry: I'm not thin, I'm fat. 
</P>
<P>
Program: Why aren't you thin? 
</P>
<P>
Larry: Forget it. 
</P>
<P>
Program: We were talking about your depressed feelings. Please tell me more 
about them. 
</P>
<P>
Larry: I can't control my appetite. 
</P>
<P>
Program: What makes you want to keep everything under control? 
</P>
<P>
Larry: I don't want to control everything, just my appetite. 
</P>
<P>
Program: But perhaps you want to keep everything under control. 
</P>
<P>
Larry: No, I don't. 
</P>
<P>
Program: A feeling of helplessness is common in depression. What are your ideas 
about helplessness? 
</P>
<P>
It got worse. At one point the program asked me about my eating habits, and I 
said that I sometimes "binge." The program associated "binge" with a drinking 
problem so it started asking irrelevant questions about drinking. 
</P>
<P>
At another point, it asked me whether being overweight affected my sexual 
relations. I responded that I was married and that it didn't seem to have much 
of an impact. The program asked me why I was so concerned about marriage. I 
can't imagine a real therapist asking such an irrelevant question. 
</P>
<P>
I wouldn't mind the program if it were sold as a curiosity item. Nor would I 
object if it were presented purely as an experiment. But this program is priced 
and promoted as serious therapy. Its 15-page manual doesn't even carry the 
usual disclosures and warnings about seeking professional help. 
</P>
<P>
I would consider it a tragedy if a severely depressed person turned to this 
program instead of seeking help from a qualified professional. Colby, however, 
argues that "90% of the people with mental health problems never get to see a 
mental health professional because of the high cost and social stigma." 
</P>
<P>
Users "even like the program's mistakes," Colby said. "As a patient, the doctor 
is in control. Here you can laugh at its mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Stuart Schwartz, professor of clinical psychiatry at Robert Wood Johnson 
Medical School, agrees that the tutorial part of the program "can be a good 
substitute for self-help books" but feels that the "interactive element is very 
suspect." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Charles Walton, a Palo Alto-based psychiatrist, believes that the program 
could be useful in some cases but worries about it being used by severely 
depressed people. 
</P>
<P>
"I can imagine patients who feel totally despairing and hopeless trying this 
and concluding that it proves their total failure and worthlessness," Walton 
said.

JACK SMITH: EPITAPHS: HUMOR RUNS DEEP; CEMETERIES DON'T DIG IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In writing about the joy of epitaphs the other day I mentioned that my own 
would be simply: Have a nice day. 
</P>
<P>
Donald G. Way accuses me of inconsistency, noting that I had previously 
indicated that I wished to go up in smoke; to be cremated, not buried. That's 
true. I happen to be claustrophobic, and do not want to be placed in a box and 
buried or entombed. I'd crack up. 
</P>
<P>
I see no reason, though, why a person's epitaph can't simply be a message he 
leaves, even though it isn't engraved in stone. Perhaps mine will be included 
in my obituary, if any. 
</P>
<P>
Louise Stocks of Claremont observes that "Have a nice day" is not very 
appropriate for a cemetery. "How could anyone in a cemetery (residents or 
visitors) do that?" 
</P>
<P>
Cemeteries are in fact peaceful and pleasant places. I have enjoyed hours 
reading epitaphs in old English cemeteries (or graveyards, as they call them 
there). The grass is green; flowers blow; the countryside lies all about; the 
church stands nearby, quaint and sturdy. And one is secretly grateful that one 
is not among the great majority. I'm sure the epitaph "Have a nice day" would 
be appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, numerous readers have sent me examples of curious epitaphs they have 
encountered or invented. Louise Stocks sends one she composed years ago to be 
read as the Neptune Society scatters her ashes in the Pacific: 
</P>
<P>
 Over the side 
</P>
<P>
 Without a long speech; 
</P>
<P>
 Hope she goes out 
</P>
<P>
 And not up on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 My old colleague Burt Sims has never been able to get printer's ink out of his 
veins. His own epitaph reflects a common frustration of every reporter: 
</P>
<P>
 Burt Sims, newsman, 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated again . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Finally got the Big Story 
</P>
<P>
 -- And no way to phone it in. 
</P>
<P>
 I know what he means. I still have nightmares in which I am unable to reach my 
paper with a big story. And, of course, Burt and I will both miss the biggest 
one of all -- our own demise. 
</P>
<P>
James E. Halferty of Pasadena says this one was found in a New England cemetery 
on the tombstone of a waiter who lived into very old age: 
</P>
<P>
 His Maker finally caught his eye. 
</P>
<P>
 John Gibson of Visalia recalls a classic from the famous graveyard on Boot 
Hill, in Tombstone, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 Here lies Lester Moore 
</P>
<P>
 Shot four times with a .44 
</P>
<P>
 No less, no more. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Reed of Montebello thinks this one may be from the same site, though he 
can't vouch for it: 
</P>
<P>
 Here lies the body of 
</P>
<P>
 Dear old Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 First a virgin, then a harlot. 
</P>
<P>
 For thirteen years she 
</P>
<P>
 Preserved her virginity, 
</P>
<P>
 Surely the record in this vicinity. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Gast of Laguna Hills recalls one that might have come from the same 
vicinity: 
</P>
<P>
 Here lie the bones of Jenny Jones; 
</P>
<P>
 For her, life held no terrors. 
</P>
<P>
 Born a virgin, died a virgin, 
</P>
<P>
 No runs, no hits, no errors. 
</P>
<P>
 And evidently she broke Charlotte's record. 
</P>
<P>
Gast says that when his wife, Mary died, in 1960 he wanted to inscribe "Waiting 
for Louis" on her niche in a San Fernando Valley columbarium. On the next-door 
niche, reserved for him, he wanted to put "Late as usual." Alas, the cemetery 
demurred and he had to settle for "Adored" and "Adorer." I must remind myself, 
whatever I do, not to end up in that humorless place. 
</P>
<P>
James F. Hurley, a senior vice president of CalFed, attributes this one to 
Hilaire Belloc, the French-British poet, essayist and novelist, though it could 
hardly have been for himself: 
</P>
<P>
 He died in despair, 
</P>
<P>
 In debt and a ditch, 
</P>
<P>
 The poor unfortunate 
</P>
<P>
 Son of a bitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Eggen offers some she found in "The Literary Life and Other Curiosities," 
by Robert Hendrickson: 
</P>
<P>
Ernest Hemingway -- 
</P>
<P>
 Pardon me for not getting up. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Benchley -- 
</P>
<P>
 This is all over my head. 
</P>
<P>
 George Bernard Shaw -- 
</P>
<P>
 I knew if I stayed around long enough, something like this would happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemingway, Benchley and Shaw are certainly capable of having written those 
epitaphs for themselves, but, modern cemeteries being as solemn as they are, I 
doubt that any of them appear on their tombstones. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Lane offers an epitaph written by his uncle, Ed Shoaff, for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell the National Enquirer I'll get in touch. 
</P>
<P>
(The National Enquirer, of course, is a supermarket newspaper that is 
unnaturally concerned with life after death.) 
</P>
<P>
First prize for the most anticlimactic epitaph is one offered for herself by 
Helene Burkholder of Oxnard: 
</P>
<P>
"Your article on epitaphs was particularly intriguing. I spent much of the day 
mulling the meaning of my life. There was nothing unusual in my past. Certainly 
my family loved me and would miss me; my employers had always been satisfied 
with my work; so there was only the thought of what had been left undone. What 
would I regret if I were to die suddenly? Suddenly it was clear: 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I had eaten more chocolate."

INSTALLATIONS TAX MEMORIES IN DIFFERENT WAYS

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Memory may be a fragile instrument, but it is as solid a foundation as we have 
on which to build our identities, our values, our hopes and our worlds. On a 
collective level, memory and history intertwine and serve as the scaffolding 
upon which we construct cities and civilizations. 
</P>
<P>
The nuances between memory and reality, received history and lived experience 
are at the heart of two video installations at UC San Diego's Mandeville 
Gallery (through Dec. 16). Bruce and Norman Yonemoto's "Framed" offers shifting 
perspectives on the government-generated documentation of Japanese-American 
internment camps of the 1940s. Barbara Steinman's "Borrowed Scenery" attempts 
to call attention to borders and boundaries, both real and imagined. 
</P>
<P>
The Yonemotos, brothers who live in Los Angeles and have been collaborating on 
videotapes since 1976, have produced a work that is at once both oblique and 
breathtakingly poignant. The intellectual impact of "Framed" relies on some 
knowledge of the subject, the forced detention of 120,000 Japanese-Americans, 
beginning in 1942, for purposes of "national security." The work's emotional 
impression, however, seeps straight through the skin with the slow burn of a 
lie told about a close friend. 
</P>
<P>
The darkened corridor in which "Framed" is set features a large painted 
backdrop of a sky on one long wall and a rectangular window on the other. The 
window must be seen at a distance of several feet, for a wooden railing 
encloses the space before it in the manner of a witness stand. Through the 
window, two layers of imagery can be seen: still images projected onto a 
gauze-like screen and, behind that, government-produced black and white films 
from the 1940s on a video monitor. 
</P>
<P>
It is stated fairly late in the approximately five-minute cycle of video 
excerpts that they are set in three of the "assembly centers" used for 
temporary containment of Japanese-American detainees. But it is made clear 
early on that these are not candid scenes of classroom instruction, dancing and 
other leisure activities, for a clapboard with filming notations announces the 
beginnings of several takes. 
</P>
<P>
The shameful reality of the assembly centers and internment camps fails to mesh 
with the glorified, sanitized view of life presented by the government in these 
tapes. The friction between the bitter truth and the honeyed lies stirs 
resentment, and also fear and curiosity over what other distorted visions have 
entered the collective consciousness and eventually been embraced as historical 
fact. 
</P>
<P>
Detainees at the camps and assembly centers were not allowed to keep their 
cameras, according to the insightful catalogue that accompanies "Framed." (The 
catalogue was produced by the Long Beach Museum of Art.) Accurate visual 
documentation of the sites simply doesn't exist to counteract the bulk of 
fallacious, government-sponsored material. 
</P>
<P>
What Bruce and Norman Yonemoto do to bring out the intimate reality of living 
in detention is to isolate still fragments of the video images and project 
these on the semi-transparent screen in front of the video monitor. The faces, 
postures, details of security signs and spelling lessons reinforce the breach 
of justice committed during the late war years simply through their blunt, 
uncontrived honesty. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the cycle of still and video images, a bright light comes on, 
directed at the viewer. Suddenly, the window becomes a mirror, and we see our 
own reflection. The edges of the painted backdrop behind us are well beyond the 
frame, so we appear to be standing before an unobstructed patch of sky. 
Briefly, we are framed -- falsely so, without warning or our consent -- and the 
Yonemotos' message hits home in yet another, deeply powerful way. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Steinman's installation has more immediate, visual impact than the 
Yonemotos', but none of its enduring intelligence or depth. 
</P>
<P>
A large, low wooden trough painted black and filled with rock salt dominates 
the darkened gallery space alloted to "Borrowed Scenery." Five video monitors 
with the same continuous image of rippling water can be seen through clearings 
in the salt, which has been raked, albeit sloppily, in the fashion of Japanese 
rock gardens, with striations and ripples suggesting the pattern of water. 
Slides projected from above onto the surface of the salt trough include images 
of a world map, a labyrinth and various other vague, notational patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Three light boxes with photographic transparencies hang nearby. Each bears a 
single image and a single word. "Immigrant" captions a photograph, from the 
1930s or '40s, of a section of a ship with passengers looking over the edge. 
"Tourist" accompanies a distanced image of a large luxury liner, and "Refugee," 
a picture of a smaller boat, filled with Southeast Asians, tossing about in 
rough water. 
</P>
<P>
Dramatically different intentions, motivations and levels of security define 
these three categories of traveler. Hierarchies begin to form in the mind as 
associations with the images and labels emerge. This aspect of the installation 
is mildly evocative, but its relationship both to the trough construction and 
to the Canadian artist's stated intent to address the issue of borders is left 
entirely unresolved.

FALLEN ANGEL: LANDON'S TIFF WITH NBC; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THE VETERAN ACTOR, PRODUCER AND DIRECTOR HAS TAKEN HIS NEW SERIES 
TO CBS AFTER A RUN-IN WITH NBC'S BUSINESS AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After more than 30 years on NBC as an actor, producer, writer and director 
involved in three long-running series -- "Bonanza," "Little House on the 
Prairie" and "Highway to Heaven" -- Michael Landon has taken the highway to 
CBS. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Landon begins filming the two-hour pilot for "Us," the story of a man 
renewing family ties after 17 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit. And 
with that pilot, Landon, 54, ends what he called in a 1988 interview with The 
Times an "exclusive" professional relationship with NBC. Although never under 
contract to develop new series only for that network, "I do it out of loyalty," 
Landon said then. 
</P>
<P>
That loyalty is over. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview at his office at Columbia Pictures Television -- which is 
producing the "Us" pilot that Landon wrote -- Landon said he took the project 
to CBS because those in charge of NBC's business affairs department rewarded 
his years of service by being "just plain rude, flat out rude" to him. 
</P>
<P>
"It basically had (nothing) to do with Brandon Tartikoff (chairman of NBC 
Entertainment Group) or (NBC Entertainment President) Warren Littlefield or any 
of those guys (in the entertainment division)," Landon said. "It basically had 
to do with a corporate attitude on the part of West Coast business affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just an attitude -- not with me, because I don't really discuss 
anything with them -- but with people who have been with me since I've been at 
NBC -- my agent, my business manager. Kind of the same kind of attitude you'd 
give someone who just came in off the street, whom you had never met. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"My post-production people received (an) award every year from NBC for the only 
show that promptly delivers every single episode without presenting a problem, 
and instead of having an attitude of 'Hey, that's terrific,' it's the attitude 
people end up having with their relatives: 'Hey -- they're just around.' " 
</P>
<P>
Landon said that he had discussed "a number of series possibilities" with NBC 
but had been met with unwillingness to listen to his ideas. He said that he 
never specifically presented NBC with the concept for "Us." He added that 
Tartikoff and Littlefield tried to persuade him to come back to NBC after 
hearing of his rift with the business affairs department, but by then it was 
"too late." 
</P>
<P>
When asked who specifically was responsible for offending the Landon team, 
Landon gave the name of John Agoglia, president of NBC Enterprises -- "who will 
have no idea what we're talking about," Landon said sarcastically. 
</P>
<P>
Agoglia said that he was, indeed, mystified by Landon's complaints: 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Landon and I have known each other for a long time; I am a little 
disappointed by his comments. There are certain jobs in the industry where you 
are relegated to wear the black hat, and I guess (chief of) business affairs is 
it. To my knowledge, other than a small finishing-up of old business, we don't 
have anything outstanding with Michael, nor did we have any major argument or 
disagreement. . . . Maybe Mr. Landon's anger is misdirected." 
</P>
<P>
As to Landon's charge that NBC was not interested in meeting with him, Agoglia 
said such decisions are made by the entertainment division, not the business 
department, and "I can't imagine that Brandon or Warren would not immediately 
respond to Mr. Landon wanting to present an idea. . . . Michael is a great guy. 
We'd love to have him back at NBC anytime." 
</P>
<P>
Tartikoff was equally bemused by Landon's anger, but said that it possibly had 
to do with a financial concern. (Landon said that the disagreement had nothing 
to do with money.) 
</P>
<P>
"The world has changed; the economics of television has changed," Tartikoff 
said. "I don't know whether it was fair or not, I don't know specifically what 
the allegations were, I just know that Landon was being asked to deficit 
something in a way that he hadn't been asked before, and he was offended by 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really have the power to go to those people (the business affairs 
department) and say: 'You have to give Michael Landon what he wants -- I demand 
it,' " said Tartikoff. "That wouldn't be my style anyway, but that's not the 
way the company works." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Landon seems happy to be resurfacing on CBS. The two-hour pilot, 
which has no scheduled airdate, will kick off the hour drama series, slated for 
fall of 1991. Landon portrays Jeff Hayes, who gets another chance at life when 
he is found innocent after 17 years in prison, and begins to travel the country 
writing a Charles Kuralt-style newspaper column about the people he meets. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling with him are his father (Barney Martin), who must learn to accept him 
after years of anger over his son's alleged crime, and his 17-year-old son 
(newcomer Casey Peterson), whom he never had the chance to get to know. 
</P>
<P>
Landon said that his new character would represent a departure from his 
"Highway to Heaven" character, Jonathan Smith, an angel serving a probationary 
term on Earth trying to win his way back to heaven by performing good deeds. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this will have a bit more edge to it -- it's hard to be flawed if 
you're an angel," Landon said. "It'll give me an opportunity to do an hour show 
that doesn't have to wrap up everything at the end of an hour, and clean up all 
the loose ends. If the family characters are interesting enough -- and getting 
men to talk to each other is a kind of interesting proposition . . . you can 
have fun, you can have dramatic moments. And I don't have to be on the same 
sets all the time -- we can move around and meet a lot of different people in 
this country, because it's going to be based on a lot of things that are 
actually happening, from (stories in) little newspapers you don't hear of very 
much. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a show where you're going to be able to guess exactly what's going to 
happen," Landon added. "It's like life is."

'AGAINST THE (BLEEP) LAW'; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: FRIDAY'S FREE-SPEECH EPISODE OF THE FOX COURTROOM DRAMA CREATED A 
PROBLEM -- HOW TO BROADCAST A COMEDIAN'S PROFANE ROUTINE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-six years ago this month, Lenny Bruce was convicted of violating an 
obscenity statute during one of his profanity-riddled performances in a New 
York comedy club. 
</P>
<P>
Just last month, a Florida record store owner was convicted of selling a 
sexually explicit album by the rap group 2 Live Crew that had been deemed 
obscene by a federal court judge. 
</P>
<P>
The more things change, the more ways some people find to "repress and censor 
and promulgate their own authority," says Michael Butler, whose script for the 
"Against the Law" episode that airs Friday at 9 p.m. on Fox is an unabashedly 
vocal defense of the First Amendment -- warts, swear words and all. 
</P>
<P>
The "Contempt" episode of "Against the Law" -- a series that dives face-first 
into the ethically charged cases of an outlandish, self-employed attorney named 
Simon MacHeath (played by Michael O'Keefe) -- centers around the obscenity 
trial of an obnoxious comic named Rainey Folts (Tom Sizemore) who is busted for 
using a flurry of profanity during a stand-up routine in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The program was filmed using the actual words in dispute, which will be bleeped 
on the telecast to comply with Fox's broadcast standards. 
</P>
<P>
"In a sense, it is ironic that we have a show about free speech and we have to 
bleep the very words we are saying should be protected," Butler said. "But we 
knew we were up against that going in and I think the point is worth going for 
even with those constraints." 
</P>
<P>
In the episode, the comedian Folts is portrayed as a nihilistic, 
confrontational gadfly, much like Lenny Bruce, although the content of his act 
lacks the maturity and bite that Bruce's social critiques possessed. In many 
respects, Folts' shtick has more in common with Andrew Dice Clay. The merits of 
Folts' performance, however, are immaterial, Butler said. He is merely a 
catalyst for his attorney to come to the realization that the principle of free 
speech is under attack and must be defended as a cornerstone of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Butler speaks from profound personal wounds. During the McCarthy-era communist 
witch hunts, both his father, screenwriter Hugo Butler, and his mother, writer 
and actress Jean Rouverol, were blacklisted. Unable to find work and unwilling 
to face the wrath of the House Committee on Un-American Activities, which had 
subpoenaed his father, Butler's parents moved their family to Mexico in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that my parents were blacklisted and that I grew up in an era in 
which it seemed that all of our First Amendment rights were in danger," Butler 
said, "I know how it feels to be vilified, to experience the formidable odds of 
repression that societies are capable of. I lived in tremendous fear during 
those years." 
</P>
<P>
As his career as a screenwriter has become more secure, Butler, who co-created 
"Against the Law" and has written the screenplays for the Clint Eastwood movies 
"The Gauntlet" and "Pale Rider," said that writing about issues central to his 
own experiences and beliefs has become increasingly important. 
</P>
<P>
One of the intricacies of the free-speech issue that "Against the Law" explores 
is that the actual performance of the allegedly obscene material is relevant to 
the issue of what constitutes "speech." In the episode, as in the 2 Live Crew 
trial, the prosecution asks a policeman to read a transcript of Folts' comic 
routine. He reads it badly, flubbing the words and draining the act of any 
humor or poignancy. Folts objects to the butchering of his work, insisting that 
the exact words and the manner in which they are spoken make all the 
difference, transforming the foul language into his own form of 
self-expression. 
</P>
<P>
But, of course, you can't hear these words on network TV. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Chernin, the president of the Fox Entertainment Group, denied that the 
broadcast standards of network television constitute censorship. Since 
broadcast television is beamed free into everyone's living room, he said, 
programmers have an obligation to be sensitive to "community standards" in 
regard to language, sex and violence. The "Against the Law" episode, he said, 
advocates the right to free speech among adults who pay for the right to listen 
to that speech in a night club, and he sees no irony or hypocrisy in Fox's 
advocating such a position while bleeping the dirty words. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a current issue and I think a very good issue for a show on this 
network," said Chernin, whose company has come under attack in the past few 
years for pushing the boundaries of "broadcast standards" with such series as 
"Married . . . With Children" and "In Living Color." "And it fits in to where 
we have been trying to move the show. We're trying to make it more topical and 
have more fun with it." 
</P>
<P>
"Against the Law," is a show that in some ways has been as embattled as the 
First Amendment. Butler created it with David Manson, who has produced such 
feature films as "Birdy" and "Bring on the Night." But after so-called 
"creative differences" with Fox, Manson quit as executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, who said that Fox rejected the first five story lines he and Manson 
presented to them, still serves as a consultant to the show, but he is no 
longer involved on a daily basis. The free-speech episode was originally 
scheduled to kick off the series last September, but Fox wanted some 
restructuring and reshooting of the story, Butler said, which forced the 
postponement. 
</P>
<P>
"What interested us was to produce what William James might have dubbed 
entertainment of the educational variety," Butler said. "I'm frankly not sure 
that the network would have been unhappy if we left out the educational part." 
</P>
<P>
So far the series has explored such issues as jailhouse snitches and capital 
punishment. An upcoming episode deals with a case of eco-terroism seemingly 
lifted straight from the diary of the radical environmental group Earth First. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a repudiation of quality or issues or education or anything like 
that," said Chernin, who insisted that he still greatly respects Manson and his 
staff. "It was just that we didn't see eye to eye." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Blatt, an attorney and the producer of such TV and feature films as "Common 
Ground," "Raid on Entebbe" and "The Boost," is now the executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
None of these comings and goings and differences of opinion have helped the 
series win any fans. Airing Sundays at 10 p.m., "Against the Law" was often the 
lowest-rated of any prime-time show each week. 
</P>
<P>
But Chernin said that Fox believes the series is too "wonderful" to simply 
write off and decided to move it to Fridays at 9 p.m. to see if it can attract 
a broader audience.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: STAGE / NANCY CHURNIN: GASLAMP THEATER GAMBLES ON 'FRANKIE 
AND JOHNNY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Gaslamp Quarter Theatre Company has exactly two weeks before opening 
Terrence McNally's "Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune" at the Hahn 
Cosmopolitan Theatre. But it has have miles to go, financially speaking, before 
it opens. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in -- as can be expected in the two weeks before mounting the show -- a 
tight situation. We need to raise $50,000," said the Gaslamp's managing 
director Steve Bevans, adding, however, that the theater has some "good 
prospects" for the money. 
</P>
<P>
But they don't have the money yet. 
</P>
<P>
One prospect for the deficit-plagued theater is getting "Frankie and Johnny" on 
stage. Bevans acknowledges that the chances for launching next year's season 
hinge on the San Diego premiere of this Off-Broadway being a hit. (A $5 sneak 
preview to the show's last dress rehearsal Nov. 25 is available through the San 
Diego Theatre League.) 
</P>
<P>
Pam Grier and William Anton will co-star at the Hahn in this love story about a 
short-order cook trying to persuade a wary waitress that they are meant for 
more than just a quick passionate encounter. 
</P>
<P>
Bevans said he is hoping for $75,000 in single-ticket sales to help finance the 
theater's next season. The entire deficit, however, runs as high as $850,000 to 
$1 million. 
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, Bevans said, the company will announce its 1991-1992 season 
in January. It will begin with Alan Ayckbourn's "A Woman in Mind" in late 
January or early February for a six-week run, which will complete the suspended 
1990 Hahn Cosmopolitan subscription series. The season is scheduled to continue 
in April of 1991 and play through March of 1992. There will be gaps in the 
season open to rental shows -- probably during the summer months. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80-85% of the Gaslamp's Elizabeth North subscribers exchanged one of the 
shows they were owed from the canceled season for "Dusk to Dawn at the Sunset," 
a co-production with Ensemble Arts Theatre that will run through Nov. 25. 
Bevans said he is happy with the turnout for "Dusk to Dawn" -- which averages 
houses of 60-95% -- and is talking to Ensemble Arts about future 
co-productions. 
</P>
<P>
If you've seen Sheri Glaser's one-woman show, "Family Secrets" at the Hahn 
Cosmopolitan, you know all about Mort, his long-suffering wife, Bev, their 
daughters Sandra and Fern (who renamed herself Kahari) and Grandma Rose, who 
just discovered octogenarian love. 
</P>
<P>
But, unless you've caught the show in the last two weeks, you may have missed a 
new character: a spiritual channeler named Miguel, who is married to 
Fern/Kahari. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican-born Miguel is not officially part of the show yet; Glaser still 
considers him "a work-in-progress." 
</P>
<P>
He comes out after the curtain closes on Glaser's five other characters. And he 
will continue to appear at each show until "Family Secrets" ends Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Miguel wears a brightly colored bandanna, a green sharkskin suit, a black 
T-shirt and a beard. He's also the only character without a Bronx accent. And 
he's the only character who asks for audience participation. 
</P>
<P>
"He lets another entity in who died thousands of years ago. Kumbiya," Glaser 
said on the phone from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Kumbiya? That's right, Glaser said, spelling the name. As in "Someone singing 
my Lord, Kumbiya." 
</P>
<P>
Kumbiya is a person in that song? 
</P>
<P>
Glaser laughed. "To me he is." 
</P>
<P>
"The way to get Kumbiya to come is to sing the song. Then Kumbiya asks the 
people if they have some questions for him." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the questions that have come from the audience are: 
</P>
<P>
What's going to happen to Dianne Feinstein? and Will there be a war in the 
Middle East? 
</P>
<P>
Kumbiya's answers? 
</P>
<P>
"Dianne will stay away on a long vacation, and if we keep thinking there will 
be a war, there will be. It is up to us to meditate. Life is like a salad bar. 
You can come up as many times as you like and put different things on your 
plate, and one day you'll have dessert." 
</P>
<P>
Part of Miguel's imagery comes from his former life as a waiter at a health 
food restaurant, which is how he met Kahari. 
</P>
<P>
She ordered cream of mushroom soup and he advised against it. He told her she 
was probably allergic to cow's milk and guessed that her mother didn't breast 
feed her. She cried and he held her for a while. 
</P>
<P>
For Miguel's character, Glaser is still working out slides and music, which 
accompany all the other characters. Her creative team is taking shots of the 
people Miguel fashions himself after: Gandhi, Buddha, Joan of Arc and Mother 
Teresa. She expects to have the presentation firmed up enough to give Miguel a 
slot in the show right after intermission when "Family Secrets" reopens at Los 
Angeles' Heliotrope Theatre on Nov. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Glaser is also expecting investors at the Los Angeles run who may be interested 
in financing a New York production of the show. Meanwhile, she is working on a 
"Family Secrets" script for Showtime. 
</P>
<P>
"If they buy the show, we'll do it like a special and maybe spin off a series, 
and then they'll cast the characters with other people," said Glaser. "Now that 
will really be weird." 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAM NOTES: Thomas Hall has been trying to bring the Maly Theatre of 
Leningrad back to the Old Globe Theatre for about a year. Now, the Maly 
recently signed an agreement with the Stamford (Conn.) Theatre to appear there 
next fall. That could be the start of the consortium Hall is trying to assemble 
to defray the costs of a Maly visit. "I'm hopeful that it will anchor the 
beginning of a tour," the Globe's managing director said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The current United States International University production of "Who's Afraid 
of Virginia Woolf?" at the Theatre in Old Town has attracted the attention of 
the American College Theatre Festival, an annual competition to find the best 
productions and performers. Three judges have seen it, and three more are 
scheduled to see it Sunday, closing night. A decision will be made by the end 
of December as to whether it will go to Sonoma Valley for a regional contest. 
The winner there will head to the John F. Kennedy Center in Washington in 
March. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Actors Theatre will sponsor what it hopes will be the first 
annual San Diego Actors' Festival Feb. 3-10. The event, which will be held at 
Sushi Performance Gallery, will feature three to four one-acts per evening and 
judges from San Diego theaters will select "Festival Encores" for additional 
performances Feb. 22-23. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Teatro Mascara Magica is back at the Bowery Theatre's Kingston Playhouse to 
present a one-act play, "Cronica de Un Secuestro" ("Chronicle of a Kidnapping") 
by Argentine playwright Mario Diament on Mondays and Tuesdays. The show will be 
presented in Spanish through Nov. 27, with an English reading to follow Dec. 
3-4. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Gaslamp Quarter Theatre Company will present comic Don Victor in his new 
show, "Yada Dada" Dec. 6-15, with a special signed performance for the 
hearing-impaired Dec. 13.

STAGE WATCH: CRAWFORD'S RETURN JUICES UP 'PHANTOM' SALES 
</P>

Michael Crawford's Dec. 31 return as "The Phantom of the Opera," announced last 
week, has goosed the show's box office, where sales had been lagging. 
</P>
<P>
After the news hit the papers Friday morning, the box office grossed $467,265 
in one day -- and $1,545,038 by the end of Tuesday. On an average day, the 
gross is between $80,000 and $100,000, reported a spokeswoman. She added that 
it wasn't possible to separate, out of the latest figures, the sales for the 
Crawford performances from those for the remaining performances starring Robert 
Guillaume, who's in the show through Dec. 30. But the announcement of 
Crawford's return certainly made a big difference. 
</P>
<P>
It occurred during the worst-selling week in the history of "The Phantom" in 
Los Angeles. The gross for last week's performances was $629,518. The weekly 
ceiling for the show ("if we were to get full price for every ticket," said the 
spokeswoman) is $730,000, and the show had been grossing an average of $700,000 
until recently. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets bought from the box office or the official telephone charge line cost 
$32.50-$50, but many tickets, especially for weekend orchestra seats, command 
higher prices at ticket agencies, which buy blocs of tickets. And these 
agencies took note of the news of Crawford's return. 
</P>
<P>
One agency doubled its tariff from $125 for the remaining Guillaume 
performances to $250 for the Crawford shows -- and jacked up the price of its 
remaining New Year's Eve tickets (which cost $75 at the box office but are sold 
out there) from $195 to $650 upon learning that Crawford will return at that 
performance. Fourteen New Year's Eve tickets were available at this agency as 
of Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Another agency exercised more restraint, raising prices from $80-$175 to 
$100-$200. 
</P>
<P>
Houston-based North American Ticket Outlet Inc. ran an ad Sunday, which had 
been prepared prior to the big Crawford announcement, noting rumors of his 
return and offering $99 weekend orchestra tickets to Crawford's shows if the 
buyer also purchased the same number of tickets to a Guillaume performance at 
the same price. 
</P>
<P>
"All I'm doing is protesting scalping," said Cameron Frye, owner of North 
American, which he said he created specifically for the purpose of selling 
"Phantom" tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to entering the ticket business, Frye -- who said he has seen "Phantom" 
13 times -- had been offering "Phantom" tickets to clients of his insurance and 
shipping businesses, buying them at $200 apiece from scalpers. "It became quite 
a burden," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So he decided to employ classic scalper technique to bring down the resale 
price for the public, as well as his clients. He had his employees call the 
ticket charge line every 30 minutes to find out when new blocs of tickets were 
put on sale (usually months in advance of the performances) -- and when he got 
a nibble, he immediately used a number of different credit cards to buy the 
maximum five tickets per card. 
</P>
<P>
"I put $300,000 on the line" in his pursuit of "Phantom" tickets, he said. He 
reeled off the numbers of orchestra seats he had for Saturday nights in 
January, ranging from 212 to 297. 
</P>
<P>
Frye contends, to quote from his ad, that "We are ticket brokers, not 
'scalpers'." He claimed he's doing it all for "the ordinary person" and that he 
isn't making any money on it, after deducting phone bills, ad costs and other 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
He declared that if he ever sells "Phantom" tickets for more than $99, "they 
can come and shoot me." 
</P>
<P>
Other ticket brokers have called him since his ad ran, trying to buy tickets 
from him for resale at higher prices, he said. Though they don't reveal their 
identity, he said he could detect them -- because they "sound like New York 
used car salesmen." 
</P>
<P>
Among those who plan to be in the audience on New Year's Eve to welcome 
Crawford back are Dean Willard and his daughter, Emily. It was Willard who paid 
the top bid of $27,500 for a pair of Crawford's house seats last April (the 
money went to charity) at what was billed as Crawford's final performance, as a 
present for his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"She's enthusiastic and we're all pleased," said Willard. He doesn't resent the 
fact that the performance last April wasn't so final after all, he added. In 
fact, he paid $1,100 for four Dec. 31 tickets. 
</P>
<P>
His daughter, who has seen "Phantom" 38 times, agreed that the news of 
Crawford's return was "wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
In other "Phantom" news, an Actors' Equity official confirmed that the union 
waived two rules to allow Crawford's return. One prohibits actors from being 
replaced by non-resident aliens (Crawford is British), and another requires a 
year to pass before a foreign star can return to a role. 
</P>
<P>
The waiver was linked to an agreement by the "Phantom" producers to meet to 
explore ways to increase the employment of minority actors in "Phantom," said 
Equity business representative Ralph Braun. However, a spokeswoman for the 
"Phantom" producers denied the linkage. Such a meeting will take place, she 
said, but it's "part of an overall industry effort" to examine minority 
casting. "These are two separate issues." 
</P>
<P>
Another Equity official noted that waiving the rules for Crawford protects 
other Equity jobs, because "Crawford's tremendous draw" helps extend the run of 
the show. 
</P>

"The Vortex," at the Doolittle Theatre, Jan. 17-March 31.

CRITIC AT LARGE: DAHR UNCAGED, COURTESY OF THE FEMINIST IBSEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The struggle of women for recognition and equality seems as contemporary as the 
ERA but is, in truth, as old as gender itself, and Sappho, Boadicea and Joan of 
Arc. Down the decades the desires and the frustrations have been observed and 
enunciated by men as well as women. 
</P>
<P>
In modern times, Ingmar Bergman's "Scenes From a Marriage" caught poignantly 
the tugs and pride of rising consciousness and the thrust to liberation. He had 
a Scandinavian predecessor, Henrik Ibsen, who, in his 19th-Century day, created 
a gallery of remarkable, vigorous women. 
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian actress Juni (pronounced Yuni) Dahr was last in Los Angeles in 
1988 doing a one-woman show called "Joan of Arc: Vision Through Fire." The 
sense of her evening was to present Joan the real human being, with fears and 
doubts, rather than the myth or the saint. 
</P>
<P>
Now Dahr has returned to Los Angeles for a one-time-only showcase performance 
(Monday night at the Westwood Playhouse) of a new show she has fashioned called 
"Ibsen Women: Put an Eagle in a Cage." The subtitle is from Ibsen's "Vikings of 
Helgeland," and what the character, Hjordis, says in full is, "Put an eagle in 
a cage and it will bite the bars, whether they are of iron or gold." 
</P>
<P>
Ibsen's women are frequently encaged, in some cases preferring death or flight 
to the ongoing entrapments. Dahr portrays Hjordis as one of the five Ibsen 
women in view. She is also Hilde in "The Master Builder," Hedda in "Hedda 
Gabler," Mrs. Alving in "Ghosts" and Nora in "A Doll's House." 
</P>
<P>
The idea for the Ibsen evening, Dahr says, arose while she was doing "Joan of 
Arc" in Los Angeles. She developed it while in residence at NYU under a 
Fulbright grant and another from the Norwegian government. It was first 
performed in 1989 at an international Ibsen symposium at Yale and has since 
been seen in New York, at Stratford-on-Avon in England, in Rome, throughout 
Scandinavia and in San Francisco last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Why is Ibsen so actual today?" Dahr asks in a kind of unabating wonder. "He 
taught me what it is to be a woman today, what it is to be free. He writes 
about what it is to be engaged not only with society but within yourself. He 
sees what is freedom, even within relationships." 
</P>
<P>
Dahr talks with audiences after the performances and says that men respond to 
the material as well as women. "They want to talk to me about their marriages 
and their relationships," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"Ibsen once said that if you want to know him, you must know Norway. I change 
it. I think if you want to know Norway you must know Ibsen. The Norwegian soul 
has a dark side and a light side." 
</P>
<P>
Dahr is from Oslo, and acting appealed to her early on. "The child inside you 
wants to search, explore, to see rooms I don't know about, people I haven't 
met." But she was also shy as a child and deferred the acting. She spent a year 
in the mountains in the ecologically aware '70s, worrying about nature, 
survival, our separation from our roots. But in the end she went to the 
national dramatic school in Oslo, then spent a dozen years in repertory at the 
National Theater in Bergen. 
</P>
<P>
Norwegian television filmed her "Joan of Arc." "I'd only done it mostly in 
churches and ruins, and I couldn't do it on a stage. So we took a crew and went 
to an island in the far north, a tiny place with ruins, 4,000 people and 8 
million birds. The people had never seen theater." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier she had spent a year in Poland, studying at Grotowski's avant-garde 
Theatre Laboratory, where she mastered enough of the language to be able to 
act. She and her sister Eva have formed a film production company and made a 
prize-winning short called "Dolce Vita," which was shown at the Women in Film 
festival here. They now have in post-production a feature called "Troll," from 
a story by the Norwegian writer Jonas Lie. It is not, she says, about the cute 
figures of folklore but rather about the demons within us.

COUNTY ORDERED TO RESTORE $7.6 MILLION IN HEALTH CUTS; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: JUDGE'S RULING CASTS DOUBT ON LEGALITY OF PLAN TO SLASH ADDITIONAL 
$12.6 MILLION FROM MEDICAL SERVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge on Wednesday ordered that $7.6 million in health care 
cuts be restored by Los Angeles County, throwing into question the legality of 
the county supervisors' plan to cut an additional $12.7 million in medical 
services next month. 
</P>
<P>
The development intensifies pressure on the supervisors to come up with money 
they had hoped to receive from the Proposition 134 liquor tax before voters 
defeated it last week. On Tuesday, supervisors voted to seek the help of 
legislators from the county in lobbying Gov.-elect Pete Wilson to restore state 
aid to public and mental health services. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives for Supervisors Deane Dana and Mike Antonovich said they would 
have to confer with county lawyers before commenting. "I don't know where we 
are supposed to get the money," said Katherine Barger, Antonovich's deputy for 
health affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Ed Edelman said he would favor tax levies by the county or 
reductions in other departmental budgets if Wilson's transition team rejects 
the county's bailout pleas. 
</P>
<P>
Deep cuts in allocations to counties were ordered by Gov. George Deukmejian 
last summer to deal with the state's deficit. The health cuts, in adult 
outpatient clinics of the county's public hospitals, have substantially limited 
patient access to those clinics and lengthened the waiting times for those who 
are treated. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County mental health system also faces $41.9 million in cuts, 
which advocates say will effectively destroy the system. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary injunction issued Wednesday in the public health case was 
sought by groups representing poor patients dependent upon county health 
services. Judge Dzintra Janavs found that cutting $7.6 million in services from 
the already overburdened county hospitals unacceptably reduced the 
accessibility and quality of medical care. State law mandates medical services 
for the poor be comparable to those available to non-indigent people. 
</P>
<P>
The Western Center on Law and Poverty and the Legal Aid Foundation of Los 
Angeles, who filed the class-action lawsuit last August, now must submit their 
own plan for reinstating the eliminated services. Melinda Bird, the Western 
Center's lawyer in the case, said she would do so by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The county then must file a response, which typically contains objections to 
the timing or feasibility of the advocates' proposal, Byrd said. It will be up 
to the judge to resolve those differences in an instructional order to the 
Department of Health Services. The injunction also could be appealed to a 
higher court, Bird said. 
</P>
<P>
County Counsel Patrick Woo, who handled the case for the Department of Health 
Services, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Bird said the injunction's most immediate effect may be to deter the county 
from going ahead with additional cuts. If the supervisors order those cuts -- a 
hearing is scheduled Dec. 13, followed by a vote on Dec. 18 -- Bird said her 
organization will ask the court to block their implementation. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman said he has no intention of voting for more cuts, just as he opposed 
the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Irving Cohen, director of administration for the Department of Health Services, 
said he was awaiting instructions from county lawyers before beginning the 
process of restoring medical services to their pre-August level. 
</P>
<P>
It will not be easily done. 
</P>
<P>
About 70 employees were laid off and more than 100 others were transferred. 
Simply sending the latter group back to their previous assignments could lead 
to service disruptions where they now work, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually when you get an injunction, it is before you cut so you don't have to 
restore anything," Cohen said. "But now we hope the judge will give us enough 
time to figure out how to restore all this." 
</P>
<P>
Of the six county hospitals, only High Desert Hospital in Lancaster was spared 
cuts in its outpatient services. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, the effect reduced the number of patients seen each month in 
cardiac, neurology, eye, joint and other clinics, and increased the wait for 
appointments. Already averaging 12 weeks for a first appointment, the cuts in 
clinic hours and staffing added at least four weeks to the process. 
</P>
<P>
Janavs found that these delays left "a number of indigents without minimum 
medical assistance and in some cases with perhaps none." 
</P>
<P>
She cited the example of the gynecological oncology clinic at Women's Hospital, 
where patients are referred who already have abnormal PAP smears, an indication 
of cancer. Women's Hospital is part of Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, 
which was hard hit by the cuts, along with Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
According to evidence in the case, the clinic was forced to reduce patient 
visits from 1,000 to 500 per month. The Department of Health Services had 
argued that patients who couldn't be seen at the hospital clinics would be able 
to get care at county-operated health centers. 
</P>
<P>
But there are no gynecological oncology services at the health centers, and 
comparable clinics at other county hospitals could not take the overflow from 
Women's Hospital, the judge said. Accordingly, the cuts in service and 
treatment delays constituted "irreparable harm" to women with gynecological 
cancers, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
Janavs also cited testimony from Dr. James Houghton, King/Drew medical 
director, that the hospital's neurology clinic was so curtailed that new 
patients now wait five months for an appointment. The waiting period in 
obstetrics and oncology is four months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The judge found that King/Drew's emergency room was already operating at a 
"minimally adequate level" when cutbacks at the clinics forced a new load of 
patients on the emergency room staff. That, too, constituted irreparable harm 
to patients, the judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, state auditors on Wednesday said the county 
Department of Mental Health has failed to adequately monitor millions of 
dollars in contracts with private clinics. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the contractors failed to make changes in procedures ordered 
by the department during a two-year period, according to the report by the 
office of the state auditor general. Such lack of oversight reduces confidence 
that mental health clients are receiving good care at reasonable cost, the 
auditors said. 
</P>
<P>
In a written response, county Mental Health Director Roberto Quiroz said he 
generally agreed with the auditors' conclusions, and has taken steps to improve 
contract monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony W. Harris, executive director of the Assn. of Community Mental Health 
Agencies, which represents clinics under contract to the department, said he 
has no problems with the report or the prospect of more scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
"We just hope there is a mental health system left in Los Angeles County to 
audit," he said, referring to the $41.9 million in funding cuts the supervisors 
are scheduled to vote on Tuesday.

HYPERACTIVITY STUDY YIELDS CLUES TO CAUSE, THERAPY; 
</P>
<P>
PSYCHIATRY: BRAIN ABNORMALITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONDITION IS IDENTIFIED. UP 
TO 5% OF CHILDREN ARE AFFECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Researchers have for the first time identified a brain abnormality associated 
with hyperactivity, the disorder that causes up to 5% of children to be 
restless, inattentive and often disruptive in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Using a highly sensitive imaging technique to observe the activity of brain 
cells, psychiatrists from the National Institute of Mental Health found 
decreased activity in the portions of the brain that are involved in control of 
attention and motor functions. 
</P>
<P>
Their results, reported today in the New England Journal of Medicine, 
"represent a clear advance in our understanding" of hyperactivity, said 
psychiatrist Gabrielle Weiss of Montreal Children's Hospital in an editorial in 
the same journal. 
</P>
<P>
"It's exciting because it gets us much closer to more effective treatment," 
said Frederick K. Goodwin, head of the federal Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental 
Health Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The results will also help to explain why the stimulant Ritalin can, 
paradoxically, calm the children and improve their attention span. Eventually, 
the studies could also lead to development of better drugs for the disorder, as 
well as to new ways to diagnose it -- a task that is often very difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Hyperactivity, which is now formally called attention deficit-hyperactivity 
disorder, is the most common psychiatric disorder of childhood, afflicting from 
2% to 5% of all youngsters. It usually begins before the child reaches school 
age, and affects boys about eight times as often as girls. 
</P>
<P>
Some previous evidence suggests that it is at least partially genetic in 
origin. As many as 60% of hyperactive children continue to display the symptoms 
in adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
"Hyperactive children are frequently in trouble with their parents and teachers 
and are unpopular with other children," Weiss wrote. About 25% of them have 
specific learning disabilities, and another 40% exhibit a pattern of starting 
fights, stealing and lying, or of disobedience, defiance and rule breaking. 
</P>
<P>
Between 70% and 80% have their symptoms alleviated by taking the stimulant 
Ritalin, which is the most common form of therapy. As many as 800,000 Americans 
are now taking the drug for the disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Psychiatrist Alan J. Zametkin and his colleagues at the National Institute of 
Mental Health studied 25 adults who were mildly hyperactive and 50 normal 
adults using a technique called positron emission tomography. The researchers 
injected sugar molecules labeled with a radioactive isotope into the subject's 
bloodstream and used the scanning technique to monitor how brain cells use the 
sugar. 
</P>
<P>
Zametkin and his colleagues found that the brains of the hyperactive adults 
used, on average, 8.1% less sugar than those of the normal controls, indicating 
that the brain cells were 8.1% less active. The largest reductions in activity 
were found in regions called the pre-motor cortex and the superior prefrontal 
cortex -- regions that have been shown to be involved in the control of 
attention and motor activity. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very enthusiastic because . . . this gives us a window into the brain to 
know what areas are involved," said psychiatrist James Satterfield of the 
National Center for Hyperactive Children in Encino. "It's an exciting time 
because we've never been able to do this kind of thing before." 
</P>
<P>
Zametkin cautioned that his studies involved a very select group of patients: 
adults with mild hyperactivity who have never taken Ritalin and who have a 
hyperactive child themselves. Adults were chosen for the five-year study 
because the researchers did not want to infuse a radioactively labeled compound 
into children, because of the potential health risk and the children's 
inability to give free consent to the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
They are now studying teen-agers with no family history of hyperactivity in 
order to determine if the results can be extended to all types of patients. 
Zametkin said the studies are easier now that the researchers know precisely 
where to look for evidence of reduced activity. "And by studying younger and 
sicker kids, we may find a greater reduction (of activity)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said they may eventually -- and "very carefully" -- extend the studies to 
still younger children in hopes that the technique might provide a definitive 
way to diagnosis the disorder. 
</P>
<P>
The mental health institute group has also studied the effects of Ritalin on 
the patients in the hope of understanding how the drug works, but they are not 
yet ready to reveal their results because they have not been published. 
</P>
<P>
Zametkin noted that previous studies in animals have shown that Ritalin 
increases the activity of brain cells, but added that "I would never in a 
million years bet a nickel that it is going to do the same thing in humans." 
</P>
<P>
The discovery would seem to close the door on the already discredited 
hypotheses that hyperactivity is caused by food additives or excessive sugar 
consumption.

POLICE IN BERLIN ROUT SQUATTERS, ARRESTING 300

<TEXT>
<P>
Amid an escalating climate of youth violence in eastern Germany, 1,500 to 2,000 
German police backed by bulldozers and water cannon fought an intense, two-hour 
battle Wednesday before clearing militant youths from a squatters' ghetto in 
the eastern section of Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials said 70 officers and 15 youths were injured and more than 300 
people were arrested in connection with the action. 
</P>
<P>
With a vehemence rarely experienced in a city known for urban disturbances, 
youths standing on the rooftops of derelict six-story apartment buildings they 
had occupied in recent months attacked police using flares, cobblestones and 
Molotov cocktails. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to kill us," Wolfgang Hoffmann, one of the police involved in the 
operation, said. 
</P>
<P>
The crumbling, 70-year-old apartments had been scheduled for renovation when 
they were first occupied by the squatters. City Interior Minister Erich 
Paetzold said it required 1 1/2 hours for police to break through the heavily 
fortified barriers and get into the houses, in the working-class district of 
Friedrichshain, which borders the old Berlin Wall. There were reports of 
hand-to-hand combat between police and squatters. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 apartment buildings in question were eventually cleared, and by early 
evening, police had fenced off some entrances. They said they would remain 
until the buildings' doors and windows were bricked in. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the battle) had an intensity I haven't seen before," a Berlin police press 
spokesman, Hans-Eberhard Schultz, told reporters at the scene a few hours after 
the fighting had ended. "I've been a police spokesman for 10 years and followed 
most of these kinds of actions. The opposition was so strong that the police 
had to move back and regroup." 
</P>
<P>
Late Wednesday, a group broke away from a mainly peaceful demonstration against 
the police action, smashed several store windows and pelted police with rocks. 
</P>
<P>
Social scientists believe the growing violence in the former East German 
Communist state stems from a collapse of state authority; a largely discredited 
police force hard-pressed to enforce the law without its traditional instrument 
of fear, and angry hard-core groups of disaffected youth, upset about a chronic 
housing shortage and rising unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the police units used Wednesday were imported from North 
Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony, previously part of West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"The housing shortage, unemployment and decay are a social time bomb that can 
explode anywhere," Berlin Mayor Walter Momper said. "Berlin reflects the social 
conflicts of the whole of Germany and the social problems of unification." 
</P>
<P>
Momper denounced the squatters as violence-prone criminals and expressed 
concern about the level of violence and what he called "the preparedness to 
kill." 
</P>
<P>
"It's plain murder lust," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
The arrest of leading members of a partner in Momper's coalition, the 
Greens/Alternative List -- including the party's press spokesman -- both 
embarrassed the Social Democratic mayor and threatened the coalition with 
collapse barely three weeks before the general election. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition Christian Democrats blamed the city government's earlier permissive 
stance toward squatters, a charge Momper rejected as election rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the severity of Berlin's housing shortage, Momper's government has 
in many cases tried to formalize the basis upon which many squatters have 
occupied buildings in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The squatters in Friedrichshain -- predominantly young people whose core 
appeared to be mainly from the western part of the previously divided city -- 
had dug trenches up to five feet deep in the street, then constructed 
barricades of scaffolding, barbed wire and even a sea-freight container. 
</P>
<P>
After the battle, police on one rooftop found what they called a "super-Molotov 
cocktail" -- an oversized glass vessel filled with gallons of gasoline and oil. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God it wasn't used. . . . It would have had the impact of a bomb and set 
the entire street on fire," said the Police Department's president, Georg 
Scherz. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday morning's violence was the latest in an escalating series of clashes 
in eastern Germany between police and young people. Heavy fighting in the same 
location Monday left more than 130 police officers and an undetermined number 
of squatters injured. 
</P>
<P>
In separate recent incidents outside Berlin, young soccer hooligans last 
Saturday used tear gas against police in the northern city of Rostock, while 
police in the industrial city of Magdeburg deployed water cannon and dogs and 
resorted to tear gas to break up a crowd of hooligans who had damaged shops in 
the city center. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, German soccer officials were forced to cancel the last match 
between the West and East German national teams scheduled for next week in 
Leipzig because police said they were unable to guarantee the security 
required. One youth died Nov. 3 in Leipzig in soccer-related violence.

OFFICIAL REBUTS CHALLENGES TO CENSUS FIGURES 
</P>

Census Bureau officials warned Los Angeles and other cities Wednesday that many 
population count challenges are likely to be dismissed because local officials 
tried to pass off vacant buildings, empty lots and other uninhabited places as 
occupied housing units. 
</P>
<P>
Delivering her sharpest rebuttal to date of charges that census enumerators 
undercounted many communities, Census Director Barbara Everitt Bryant told the 
census and population subcommittee of the House Post Office and Civil Service 
Committee that early housing unit counts "were largely accurate." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant acknowledged that the bureau had committed some coding errors, resulting 
in overlooked dwellings, but she said that the agency corrected those mistakes 
when found by punching updated information into a computer database. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant said that the bureau's computers were able to correct mistakes made by 
census counters in New Jersey, who reportedly fabricated information about some 
hard-to-count households without actually visiting them. An investigation into 
the allegations resulted in census officials recounting 18,303 households in 
northern New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant said that the bureau is unwilling, however, to recount some blocks 
flagged by city officials because they contained "large amounts of error or are 
out-of-date compared to census counts." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the bureau's efforts to correct its counting errors, Rep. Thomas 
C. Sawyer, the Ohio Democrat who heads the subcommittee, said: "I'm grateful 
they made the effort, but concerned they had to." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant, however, charged that local officials had made far worse mistakes in 
their efforts to discredit the bureau's preliminary figures. 
</P>
<P>
"There was one lively example in Queens (New York), where the city said there 
were 414 housing units on what turns out to be a piece of the Gateway National 
Recreation Area, and all we can find are three lifeguard benches," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant declined to identify other cities that made such mistakes or to quantify 
the number of claims expected to be rejected for bogus documentation. The 
bureau is expected to respond to the cities' challenges later this month. 
</P>
<P>
The challenges involve preliminary census findings released in September as 
part of the bureau's efforts to review the accuracy of the decennial census. 
Many urban mayors, state governors and congressional leaders have complained 
that their localities were undercounted. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, city officials reported that the census missed nearly 49,000 
dwellings, or almost 6% of the city's total housing stock. 
</P>
<P>
Across the country, about 25% of 39,198 local governments officially responded 
to the bureau's findings, including eight large cities that questioned the 
counts of more than 2,000 residential blocks in their jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Simmens, assistant executive director of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, 
said that because city leaders did not know which challenges would be rejected 
by the bureau, they could not respond to Bryant's charge that inaccurate data 
was used to support their challenges. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Simmens used the census director's comments as an opportunity "to 
reiterate our call for a statistical correction of the 1990 census." The 
conference has served as an umbrella group in a series of legal battles with 
census officials. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant said that the bureau is on schedule to meet a legal requirement to 
deliver a final count of the nation's population to President Bush before Dec. 
31. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not speculate on what those numbers will be," she told the panel. "That 
is an announcement for the President to make."

HOSPITAL EXPOSES WOMAN, 23, TO RISK OF GETTING AIDS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: WHILE BEING TREATED FOR BACK PAIN, SHE RECEIVED AN INJECTION WITH 
SYRINGE THAT HAD BEEN USED ON HIV-POSITIVE PATIENT.

<P>
A 23-year-old San Diego woman was exposed to a deadly virus at a hospital here 
after she was treated with a syringe that had been used on an AIDS patient, 
medical officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, whose name was not released, was notified by doctors at Mercy 
Hospital 36 hours after being treated for job-related back pain that she had 
been exposed to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, her 
attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and the 
state Department of Health Services confirmed that the incident, which happened 
Sept. 25, is under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Levine, the attorney representing the woman and her family, said this is 
the first case in the United States in which a patient has been exposed to an 
AIDS-related virus with a syringe used on another person -- a claim federal and 
state officials could not confirm. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Keyser, president of Mercy Hospital, acknowledged that a serious mistake 
had been made. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why the syringe was not disposed of, he said, "Obviously, that should 
have happened." 
</P>
<P>
"The medical risk to this patient is very limited," Keyser said, because the 
needle was inserted into a tube, which was attached to the woman's body, rather 
than being injected directly through the skin. 
</P>
<P>
Levine said his client may know within three months whether or not she is 
HIV-positive. 
</P>
<P>
Levine said the woman, whose occupation he refused to disclose, was sent to the 
hospital with an "insignificant lower-back injury" she suffered at work. A 
magnetic resonance imaging test showed no damage. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no problem with her disc or cervical spine," Levine said. "It was 
very minor. For some reason, the workers' compensation doctor decided to order 
a bone scan. That involved a radioisotope dye injection, which would have 
detected a herniated disc." 
</P>
<P>
"She received the injection, and 36 hours later, on Sept. 27, she received a 
call at 1:15 a.m. She was told to report to the hospital immediately, that she 
'might have caught a virus.' She reports to the hospital and is greeted by the 
head of the radiology department, a hospital vice president and a physician who 
specializes in infectious diseases. 
</P>
<P>
"She was then told she had been injected with a syringe used previously on a 
patient known to be HIV-positive, and that the same syringe, instead of being 
disposed of by the attending technician, was then used on her. They refused to 
explain how or why such a mistake occurred." 
</P>
<P>
Levine and physicians unrelated to the case say it is customary for "any and 
all" syringes to be disposed of as soon as they are used. 
</P>
<P>
"The standard procedure is that you never use a used syringe on another 
person," said Dr. Donald Ramras, deputy director of the San Diego County Health 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Keyser refused to name the technician who made the injection but did say the 
person was no longer employed by the hospital. He refused to say whether the 
technician had been fired.

The Supreme Court of Ireland on Wednesday ordered the extradition to Britain of 
an alleged IRA bomber who is in his 36th day of a hunger strike to fight 
extradition. 
</P>
<P>
The accused man, Desmond Ellis, was flown by military aircraft to London after 
losing the appeal. He will stand trial in Britain on conspiracy and explosives 
possession charges arising from a 1981 London bombing campaign in which three 
people died, police said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the Irish court has ordered the extradition to Britain of 
someone wanted on terrorist charges under new Irish laws intended to simplify 
the extradition procedure.

ITALIAN DC-9 JETLINER CRASHES AND BURNS IN SWITZERLAND; 46 ABOARD DIE

An Alitalia DC-9 jetliner approaching Zurich airport crashed into a hillside 
and burned Wednesday night, killing all 40 passengers and six crew members 
aboard, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Flight AZ404 of the Italian airline, coming from Milan, crashed about 8:20 p.m. 
five miles north of Kloten International Airport outside Zurich, near the 
village of Weiach, airport spokesman Peter Gutknecht said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses reported what appeared to be fire and explosions before the plane 
crashed into a wooded hill, Zurich police told a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few on board were Italians, an Alitalia spokeswoman said. Italian 
reports said most of the other passengers were apparently Swiss and Japanese. 
Alitalia said it did not expect to publish a full passenger list before today. 
</P>
<P>
The Swiss Federal Meteorological Office said that visibility at the time of the 
crash was good -- up to 10 miles, with light rain and light winds. Early 
reports had cited heavy rain. 
</P>
<P>
Fire raged in the wreckage and woodside for at least 1 1/2 hours, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Hanni Steffen, a nearby resident and a medic, said she rushed to the site but 
all help appeared too late. 
</P>
<P>
"The plane was burning like a volcano," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Italy's state-run RAI television said first reports appear to discount the 
possibility of a terrorist act but that the crash did not seem linked to the 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
The plane broke apart on impact. Smoking wreckage, covered with firefighting 
foam, was scattered about the muddy hillside. The tail section had broken off. 
One landing gear and a section of wing were also discernible. 
</P>
<P>
The plane was on time after a 50-minute flight from Milan when it disappeared 
from radar screens, Gutknecht said. 
</P>
<P>
Swiss aviation authorities said they have begun an investigation, and Italian 
authorities said they will dispatch a team of investigators.

SUHARTO'S VISIT HIGHLIGHTS EASING OF CHINA'S ISOLATION;

Indonesian President Suharto arrived in Beijing on Wednesday on a visit that 
highlights recent gains by China in breaking out of the diplomatic isolation it 
fell into last year. 
</P>
<P>
The visit by Suharto, who brought along an entourage of more than 100, 
coincides with visits by Thai Prime Minister Chatchai Choonhavan, Argentine 
President Carlos Menem and five U.S. congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. group, headed by Rep. Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio), is the first 
congressional delegation to visit China since last year's massacre of 
pro-democracy protesters in Beijing. In the 17 months since the crackdown, 
which prompted Western economic and political sanctions, there had been just 
two visits to China by individual members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Wednesday, the congressmen said the key purpose of their 
trip is to urge Chinese leaders to take steps -- primarily the release of 
political prisoners -- that could defuse congressional sentiment critical of 
Beijing and thereby ensure the preservation of strong trade ties. Otherwise, 
Congress may vote next year to end China's most-favored-nation trade status, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
Suharto's visit, the first by an Indonesian leader since 1964, is important 
partly for marking the full resumption of close ties between the two nations 
after 23 years of estrangement. Indonesia suspended diplomatic relations with 
Beijing in 1967, two years after an attempted Communist coup in Jakarta that 
Indonesia alleged was backed by China. The two nations restored ties only last 
August, and Suharto's six-day visit is now expected to promote expanded trade. 
</P>
<P>
The flurry of diplomatic activity in Beijing comes just one day after Chinese 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen returned from a high-profile Middle East tour that 
included talks in Baghdad with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and in Saudi 
Arabia with King Fahd. 
</P>
<P>
China's support for efforts to reverse Iraq's conquest of Kuwait has 
contributed to the easing of Beijing's isolation in Western capitals. The 
European Community ended most of its sanctions against China last month, while 
Japan began taking steps this summer toward restoring normal ties. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. congressmen visiting Beijing said there is no linkage between China's 
stand on Iraq and Sino-U.S. trade issues. But they expressed appreciation for 
Beijing's stance in the gulf crisis.

BAKER TO SEEK SUPPORT OF 3 KEY AFRICAN NATIONS 
</P>

<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III will meet this weekend with foreign 
ministers of three African members of the U.N. Security Council to see if they 
would support a resolution authorizing military action against Iraq, U.S. 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The votes of the three nations -- Ethiopia, Zaire and Ivory Coast -- will be 
crucial if the Bush Administration decides to go ahead with plans to seek 
standby authority to take offensive action against Iraq should peaceful means 
fail to end the occupation of Kuwait. By enlisting their support, the United 
States would gain broader approval among neutral and Third World nations for 
its gulf stance. 
</P>
<P>
Baker already has discussed the issue with leaders of the other permanent 
members of the Security Council -- the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China 
-- as well as with Canada, one of 10 rotating members. The permanent members 
could have killed the resolution with their veto power. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his sessions with representatives of the three African 
countries, Baker is expected to meet with officials of two other temporary 
Security Council members -- Finland and Romania -- during the European summit 
meeting next week in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. government, supported by Britain, maintains that it has ample 
authority to attack Iraq under the "collective self-defense" provisions of the 
U.N. Charter, specific Security Council authorization would provide a firmer 
political base. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, France, Canada, Turkey and a number of other nations whose 
support is vital to any military action have said that they oppose the use of 
force unless it is authorized in advance by the Security Council. Baker told an 
interviewer last week in Moscow that Security Council authorization "would be 
preferable from the standpoint of preserving as much of this unprecedented 
consensus that supports what's being done in the gulf as possible." 
</P>
<P>
"Most countries believe that would be preferable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have made it clear, however, that the Administration will seek a 
Security Council vote only if passage is assured. Baker's current round of 
consultations is intended to test the waters for such a measure. 
</P>
<P>
The United States would like to bring the measure to a vote this month while it 
still holds the council presidency under the U.N. rotation system. On Dec. 1, 
the presidency moves to Yemen, an Arab nation that has been lukewarm, at best, 
to the possible use of force against Iraq. Although the nation holding the 
presidency cannot thwart the will of the majority, it can create procedural 
hurdles to make action more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, the Security Council has approved 10 
resolutions condemning Baghdad's aggression. Many of them were passed 
unanimously, and all had at least 13 of the council's 15 votes. Only Cuba and 
Yemen did not support all the measures. A resolution authorizing offensive 
military action would be far more controversial, however. 
</P>
<P>
Baker leaves today for Brussels, where he will meet with officials of the 
12-nation European Community. U.S. officials said that he will urge the 
community to increase its financial support for Turkey, Egypt and the emerging 
democracies of Eastern Europe, all of which have been hard hit by the crisis 
and the soaring price of oil. 
</P>
<P>
Although the location of Baker's meetings with the African diplomats has not 
been disclosed, it is believed to be Geneva. Baker then will join President 
Bush in Paris on Sunday for the summit meeting of the 34-nation Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe.

Iraqi fighter planes have increased reconnaissance activity near the Saudi 
border in the last two weeks, indicating a heightened military alert against a 
possible U.S. strike, according to American and Saudi officials. 
</P>
<P>
The stepped-up Iraqi missions, including high-speed charges toward the border, 
are regarded as a response to new bellicosity from the United States and as the 
clearest sign to date that Iraq is taking the American threats seriously, the 
officials said.

"They feel they're under pressure," Saudi air force Col. Abdul Rahman Bluwi 
said Wednesday in describing what he said is "some increase" in Iraqi activity 
monitored in round-the-clock surveillance missions by Saudi Arabia and the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Other knowledgeable officials said the Iraqi upsurge marks a shift from a light 
pace of flight operations in the early months of the crisis to what they 
describe as a sometimes-heavy rate now, some of them from newly activated air 
bases in Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
But Bluwi, the commander of Saudi AWACS early-warning radar surveillance 
aircraft, told the first reporters permitted to observe such a Saudi mission: 
"We know exactly what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
The increase in the Iraqi missions comes as the U.S. military begins what the 
commander of U.S. AWACS operations here described as a "tilt toward an 
offensive role." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Saudis and Americans both are increasing their emphasis on AWACS 
(airborne warning and control systems) aircraft that can coordinate a possible 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
On a daylong mission over Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, a Saudi AWACS plane 
demonstrated what is the closest military coordination being conducted between 
the new allies. 
</P>
<P>
The two countries' systems are continuously airborne and are linked to produce 
a vivid radar picture of air traffic across the kingdom and deep into Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The windowless planes that serve as flying war rooms can look hundreds of miles 
into enemy territory. They provide a capability that has revolutionized aerial 
warfare from the days in which pilots had to rely on their own on-board radar. 
</P>
<P>
The transformation, said Maj. Doug McMaster, an Air Force liaison officer 
flying aboard the Saudi plane, "is like you were in a dark room and then you 
turn on the lights and you see everything." 
</P>
<P>
Aboard the Saudi AWACS on Wednesday, weapons operators monitored half a dozen 
radar screens on the dome-crowned plane. They watched anxiously as an 
unidentified plane with military characteristics flew slowly in Jordanian 
airspace near Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi officers said the route and behavior of the plane made them confident 
that the aircraft was from a friendly country. But in what is a tense 
atmosphere in the skies, they dispatched a pair of Saudi fighters to take a 
closer look at what turned out to be an incoming Omani transport plane. 
</P>
<P>
In just an hour on post near the Saudi-Iraqi border, they kept close watch on 
at least five Iraqi aircraft, none of which ventured closer than 25 miles to 
Saudi Arabia. Later the AWACS coordinated a mock battle pitting Saudi F-15s 
against other fighters playing the role of incoming Iraqi "bandits." 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft worked throughout the flight in high-tech tandem with a U.S. AWACS 
plane to divide control of the crowded skies and keep a lookout to the north 
for possible attack. U.S. commanders praised the work as a "truly unified 
operation." 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia purchased its own AWACS planes from the United States in 1981 in a 
$9-billion package that still stands as the largest arms sale in history. The 
sale was completed despite strong opposition from supporters of Israel. The 
AWACS aircraft were not delivered to the kingdom until 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But the close bond between the two air forces was forged earlier. In the early 
1980s, U.S. planes were stationed in Saudi Arabia to keep watch over the 
Persian Gulf during Iraq's eight-year war with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Most Saudi AWACS officers trained in the United States, and officers from both 
services said the experience is paying dividends. Of about 10 AWACS in the 
combined fleet here, five are Saudi planes. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Saudi aircraft are considerably less advanced than those now in 
the U.S. fleet. Designed to minimize the threat to Israel, they are suited 
principally for defensive operations and have not been modernized since their 
delivery four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In the current crisis, American commanders warned, those limited capabilities 
could restrict the role of the Saudi planes in managing any attack against 
Iraq. Americans fly aboard the Saudi AWACS during most missions here to make up 
for a lack of Saudi training. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans said that combined training since the crisis began has improved 
Saudi tactics in "more aggressive" operations. But Bluwi, the Saudi commander, 
also indicated that more advanced AWACS technology might come to Saudi Arabia 
as a product of the current alliance against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The colonel acknowledged that Saudi Arabia did not deploy its AWACS fleet on 
round-the-clock surveillance of Iraq until after the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait 
-- despite the buildup of Iraqi forces that began weeks before.

NEWS SURVEY: 62% OF THE RESPONDENTS PAID CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE CRISIS. NEARLY

<P>
For the fourth month in a row, Americans paid extraordinary attention to news 
of the Persian Gulf crisis -- even though the issue was largely ignored by 
candidates in this month's elections -- according to a survey released today. 
</P>
<P>
And although Democrats hope that their call for economic fairness will bring 
them closer to the White House, the survey shows that most Americans are 
unaware even of the results of the budget debate. 
</P>
<P>
These are two of the findings in the November Times Mirror News Interest Index, 
a monthly survey that measures public response to the news. The surveys are 
conducted by the Times Mirror Center for People &amp; the Press, an operation 
of Times Mirror, which owns the Los Angeles Times and other media enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 62% of Americans paid close attention to news about the Persian 
Gulf. No other story has held such intense public interest over so prolonged a 
period in the two years that Times Mirror has conducted these monthly surveys. 
The plight of American hostages in Iraq was closely followed by 49%. 
</P>
<P>
Americans also began paying more attention to news of the economy, as much as 
after the October, 1987, stock market crash. In both instances, 40% followed 
the stories. 
</P>
<P>
And 34% of respondents said that they had paid very close attention to the 
budget negotiations in Congress, although most were left confused. Only 46% 
knew that Congress adjourned having reached a budget agreement, while 30% 
thought it had not, and 24% had no idea. 
</P>
<P>
Some evidence suggests that respondents did not recognize many differences 
between the final budget deal and the one negotiated earlier by the White House 
and congressional leaders. For instance, even among those who were aware of the 
budget agreement, public support was virtually identical to the earlier plan -- 
35% in favor, 47% opposed. 
</P>
<P>
While analysts believe that the recent elections reflected widespread 
discontent with Washington, Americans had little grasp of the lawmaking that 
Congress and the White House had actually done. 
</P>
<P>
Only one new law penetrated public consciousness -- the banning of smoking on 
all domestic flights was recognized by 64%. 
</P>
<P>
And some evidence suggests that President Bush might feel little political 
fallout from legislation he had vetoed. For instance, 27% thought that Bush had 
signed a civil rights bill into law. Only 29% knew that he had not. Likewise, 
19% thought that he had signed into law the family leave bill, while 23% knew 
that he had not. 
</P>
<P>
This ignorance of legislation was just as evident among those most affected. 
Only 29% of non-whites knew that the civil rights bill was vetoed, for 
instance. And only 20% of women under age 40 knew that the family leave bill 
was vetoed. 
</P>
<P>
More generally, 32% of Americans said they paid very close attention to 
criticisms of President Bush for changing his mind on taxes and for being 
seemingly inconsistent in his statements about the Persian Gulf. Democrats paid 
closer attention to these stories (38%) than Republicans (28%). 
</P>
<P>
The survey, which interviewed 1,208 adults Nov. 8-11, has a margin of error of 
plus or minus three percentage points.

<P>
Political Front: 
</P>
<P>
President Bush assured members of Congress that war with Iraq is not imminent 
and that he is willing to give economic sanctions more time to work. But he 
declined to promise to seek prior congressional approval of any military 
offensive, lawmakers said. 
</P>
<P>
Key Republican congressmen said the bipartisan consensus supporting the 
President's gulf policies has been restored. 
</P>
<P>
Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney authorized the mobilization of 72,500 more 
reservists, bringing the total authorized to 125,000. So far, 35,562 reservists 
have been called to active duty as part of Operation Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi planes have stepped up reconnaissance missions near the Saudi border in 
an apparent response to the American military buildup in the gulf, according to 
U.S. and Saudi officials. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic Front: 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III plans to meet in Europe this weekend with 
foreign ministers from several members of the U.N. Security Council to seek 
support for a proposed resolution that would authorize use of force against 
Iraq if sanctions fail. 
</P>

FIERY SUMMATIONS HEARD IN MURDER CASE; 
</P>
<P>
SLAYINGS: THE DEFENSE AND PROSECUTION PAINT WILDLY DIVERGENT PORTRAITS OF THE 
SOCIALITE CHARGED IN THE TWO KILLINGS.

<P>
In highly emotional summations, a defense attorney and a prosecutor painted two 
wildly divergent pictures of the woman who has admitted killing her former 
husband and his new, young wife as they slept. 
</P>
<P>
Calling it an ambush and a double execution, a prosecutor said Wednesday that 
La Jolla socialite Elisabeth Anne (Betty) Broderick fully intended to kill her 
ex-husband and his wife because she crept into their bedroom while they slept 
and "blew them away." 
</P>
<P>
But as he has throughout the trial, defense attorney Jack Earley characterized 
Broderick as an emotionally devastated woman who had intended only to kill 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
In a summation that the defense said badly miscast Broderick's emotional state, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry Wells said the killings were the culmination of years 
of planning and a smoldering, constant hate for her ex-husband, prominent 
lawyer Daniel T. Broderick III. 
</P>
<P>
When the time was right -- after their four-year divorce was over, when Betty 
Broderick had nothing left to gain in the courts and needed again to be the 
"center of attention" -- she killed him and his new wife, Linda Kolkena 
Broderick, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
Urging the jury to return two first-degree murder convictions, Wells said, "You 
don't point a .38-caliber gun loaded with hollow-tipped bullets at two people 
lying in bed early in the morning and fire without intending to kill them." 
</P>
<P>
Broderick, 43, is charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the Nov. 5, 
1989, killings. She could be sentenced to life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Broderick, who was 44, was a leading medical malpractice lawyer and a 
former president of the San Diego County Bar Assn. Linda Broderick, who was 28, 
was his office assistant. 
</P>
<P>
After 16 years of marriage, Daniel and Betty Broderick separated in 1985. 
During their bitter divorce, which was not final until 1989, she accused her 
husband of cheating her out of her fair share of his seven-figure annual 
income. 
</P>
<P>
Earley said Wednesday that, as Betty Broderick had testified, she sought only 
to talk to Daniel Broderick when she stole into his house, then crept into his 
bedroom before dawn. 
</P>
<P>
The Brodericks' bitter divorce had made her feel immense emotions of anger, 
rage and depression, Earley said. Broderick stepped into the bedroom and 
encountered another rush of emotion because, for the first time, she saw her 
ex-husband in bed with his new wife, he said. 
</P>
<P>
She fired her gun, but not in a cold and calculating way. Instead, she was at 
the mercy of her emotions, out of control, like a boat without a rudder, Earley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Her act was one of craziness, one of emotion, one that should never have 
happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both lawyers were emotional during their closing arguments, raising their 
voices often and gesturing frequently to the jury. Broderick, however, wrote 
notes to her attorney and, for the most part, sat impassively with her chin in 
a hand, looking away from the jury. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge Thomas Whelan said he would instruct jurors 
today on their five options in the case -- first- and second-degree murder, 
voluntary and involuntary manslaughter and not guilty on any charges. 
</P>
<P>
The case, which has aroused extraordinary attention in San Diego, drew an 
overflow crowd Wednesday to the county courthouse that included civics students 
from El Cajon Valley High School.

SHERIFF GAVE DRUG MONEY TO PUBLIC AGENCIES 
</P>

Sheriff John Duffy provided more than $60,000 in seized drug proceeds -- which 
he had deposited in a secret checking account -- to government agencies, 
according to a summary of the account released Wednesday under court order. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Harrison Hollywood, who had ordered Duffy on Tuesday to 
turn over the more than $1 million left in the account, ordered the sheriff 
Wednesday to explain during a hearing how he had spent the money. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all of the $61,802 went to the district attorney's office for its 
participation in drug busts and to various city governments that contract with 
the Sheriff's Department for service and are entitled to share in the proceeds 
from drug raids. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy also spent $5,400 for an attorney to defend himself in a civil lawsuit, 
according to the summary. County auditors warned Duffy in June that spending 
drug money for attorneys was improper when they discovered that he paid nearly 
$70,000 earlier this year to the same law firm for work on the suit. 
</P>
<P>
The county's sheriff for 20 years, Duffy did not seek reelection. His last term 
has been marked by continual controversy. He has feuded with the Board of 
Supervisors for months over who controls money and property seized in drug 
raids. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy had control of the money until July, when supervisors voted to usurp his 
spending authority. Duffy had wanted to spend $450,000 on laptop computers for 
his department. The supervisors wanted the money spent on security measures at 
the jail in Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy lost the battle, but decided he would not let county supervisors 
determine how the money was spent. In September, he opened the secret account 
with the San Diego office of Security Pacific National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy wrote 15 checks, mostly to the district attorney's office and to the 
cities of Vista, Encinitas, Poway, Lemon Grove and San Marcos, governments that 
contract with the Sheriff's Department and share in proceeds from drug busts. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy wrote a check Tuesday for $1,044,429, the entire amount left in the 
account, which Harrison had ordered him to deposit in a court-controlled trust 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison has asked retired Superior Court Judge William Yale to mediate the 
dispute involving Duffy, the supervisors, the county counsel and the 
sheriff-elect.

Federal Highway Administration bureaucrats have decided that San Franciscans 
will have to put up with the earthquake-damaged Embarcadero Freeway at least 
until April, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Art Agnos, his staff and the state Department of Transportation had been 
under the impression that demolition of the elevated roadway could begin in 
January. But Caltrans officials said federal regulations require an 
environmental report before the 80,000 tons of freeway can be removed. The 
$15-million tear-down project is now slated to begin 1 1/2 years after the Loma 
Prieta earthquake. City officials, merchants and critics of the double-decked 
freeway want to demolish the roadway as soon as possible to help solve traffic 
problems.

PROTESTERS DELAY NUCLEAR TEST AT NEVADA SITE

Four protesters delayed but failed to halt the test of a British nuclear weapon 
Wednesday by infiltrating the remote Nevada Test Site and making their way to 
ground zero. 
</P>
<P>
The device, with an explosive force about 12 times that of the Hiroshima atomic 
bomb, was detonated at 11:17 a.m., more than two hours behind schedule after 
the four were removed by security officers, Department of Energy authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The protest, by Greenpeace, is the second time in three years that anti-nuclear 
activists have infiltrated the sprawling desert site in an effort to halt such 
a test. Members of the group in Germany also staged a protest at the British 
Embassy in Bonn. All British nuclear tests are conducted in Nevada under a 
mutual defense treaty with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Energy Department officials rejected claims that the four protesters were near 
ground zero until they popped into view of cameras monitoring the blast site 
during a technical hold six minutes from detonation. 
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace spokeswoman Junior Bridge identified the protesters as Juley Howard, 
23, Jane Gregory, 27, and Lorna Richardson, 25, all of London, and Michael 
Perry, 27, of the Rocky Mountain Peace Center. 
</P>
<P>
The four probably will be charged with trespassing, Energy Department spokesman 
Jim Boyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Motion from the blast was felt at Las Vegas City Hall and atop the city's 
high-rise hotels. It registered 5.1 on the earthquake scale at the National 
Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.

Be careful about where you sit in the Sangamon County Building, where the 
toilets have been exploding lately. 
</P>
<P>
A water tank in the building's basement filled with air Tuesday, and the excess 
pressure caused five toilets to be blown apart, sending the porcelain flying. 
</P>
<P>
Court reporter Jerry Wedeking was a witness. He flushed a toilet in a 
fourth-floor jury room and saw dollar-size pieces of porcelain fly around him. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I did was check to see if there were any pieces sticking in 
me," said Wedeking, a 27-year courthouse veteran.

DAVE DISTEL: PLUMMER EXCELLING IN 3 WAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William (Refrigerator) Perry became famous around the world a few years back 
when the Chicago Bears let the offense borrow him from the defense and then 
handed him the football. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, part of William's charm was that he could wear the Equator as a 
belt. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers now have a character doing almost exactly what Perry did. They too 
have a defensive starter who has become an offensive goal-line specialist. 
</P>
<P>
You've seen that funny number in the backfield. 
</P>
<P>
50. 
</P>
<P>
You don't expect anyone wearing the number 50 to be in position to handle a 
ball unless the game is basketball . . . or the guy is a pitcher. In football, 
centers and linebackers wear numbers in the 50s. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Plummer is a linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
He is the mystery man who wears 50 in the Chargers' offensive backfield. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe he's not such a mystery man any more. You can be assured that the 
Kansas City Chiefs, this week's opponents, are fully aware that Plummer is not 
in the backfield to serve as a bodyguard for Marion Butts or Rod Bernstine or 
Ronnie Harmon. 
</P>
<P>
The idea in using a guy like Plummer in the backfield is that he presents the 
potential for surprise. A lot of teams, for example, use interior offensive 
linemen as tight ends or wingbacks in short-yardage situations, but seldom are 
they taken seriously as people who could hold the ball if it was handed or 
thrown to them. 
</P>
<P>
So the Chargers take the inside linebacker and run him onto the field with the 
offense and turn him loose with the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Understand, now, that Plummer has not exactly become a workhorse in the 
offensive backfield. What he is, to be sure, is a workhorse on the field, 
period. He does these cameos in the backfield in addition to handling his 
regular chores as a defensive starter and more regular chores as a special 
teams performer. 
</P>
<P>
In a different way, Gary Plummer is a triple threat. 
</P>
<P>
He has led the Chargers in tackles since he joined the team as a free agent in 
1986. This fact alone should come as a bit of surprise, because this is not 
exactly a no-name defense. What's surprising is that none of the big names, 
such as Billy Ray Smith or Lee Williams or Leslie O'Neal or Gill Byrd, led this 
team in tackles. 
</P>
<P>
This free-agent guy does. The Chargers' leading tackler played JC football at 
somewhere called Ohlone College, which no longer plays football; walked on at 
Cal, which only recently seems to have rediscovered how to play football; and 
started his professional career with the USFL, which has gone the way of 
Ohlone. This background would not suggest this guy came to the Chargers a 
can't-miss prospect. 
</P>
<P>
All the guy does is his job . . . and two or three other people's. 
</P>
<P>
That Plummer became a fullback, a position he has never played in all of his 
life, came about because of the one-back offense. All of the backs were 
basically tailback types and the coaches wanted a fullback type for 
short-yardage situations. 
</P>
<P>
"They asked the defensive staff who they'd recommend," Plummer said, "and they 
said myself and Henry Rolling. I learned all the goal-line plays, but I never 
thought much would come of it." 
</P>
<P>
However, the box score now tells us that Plummer has caught one pass (for a 
touchdown) and run once (for a touchdown). The pass was against Pittsburgh and 
the run was last Sunday against Denver, both from the one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a dream that I'd ever score," he said. "When it happened against 
Pittsburgh, it was like a little moment of glory for all the blue-collar 
workers . . . because I consider myself to be a blue-collar worker." 
</P>
<P>
That moment would pale compared with the touchdown run against Denver in front 
of a sold-out home crowd. This game, eventually a 19-7 victory, was up for 
grabs before Plummer's dive into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
About the only thing he didn't do well was spike the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to see linebackers show extra-curricular skills," mused Billy Ray 
Smith, Plummer's linebacking sidekick, "but we're going to have to have a 
session to work on that spiking." 
</P>
<P>
True to his nature, Gary Plummer thanked Coach Dan Henning and offensive 
coordinator Ted Tollner for having the confidence to hand him the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Also true to his nature, he is still just a blue-collar guy. This defensive 
starter turned offensive surprise has not found himself inundated with 
endorsements or late-night (or early morning) television appearances. 
</P>
<P>
This is not William Perry revisited. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people got into the Fridge thing because he weighed 370 pounds," 
Plummer said. "I'm about 130 pounds shy of that." 
</P>
<P>
Again, he is just too ordinary a guy for such commotion. 
</P>
<P>
However, this has brought about subtle changes in the Plummer household. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," he said, "it has had its drawbacks. My wife complains that she can't do 
the housework any more when the offense is on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the only time Leigh-Anna Plummer can be sure her husband is not on the 
field is halftime. When he comes home with a trombone, she will know she has to 
watch then, too.

FINALLY, RAYE HAS HIS WAY; 
</P>
<P>
AZTECS: H-BACK COMES OUT OF THE BACKGROUND AND PUTS TOGETHER A BIG GAME AGAINST 
HAWAII. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Forgotten Man cut across the middle of the field, plucked the football out 
of the air and shifted toward the end zone. It was only Jimmy Raye, the ball 
and about 35 yards of open field. 
</P>
<P>
His legs pumped as hard as ever. He was running to salvage his senior season, 
rushing to give San Diego State the lead. Sprinting back into the Aztec 
playbook. 
</P>
<P>
Once, he was right there on a prominent page, laughing and catching and hugging 
the football. Lately, the focus of this picture has been somewhere else. Raye 
still starts and plays quite a bit, but he has been part of the background. 
</P>
<P>
He was SDSU's third-leading receiver last year. He caught 45 passes for 745 
yards and four touchdowns. Neither of the top two receivers were returning, so 
Raye came into this year prepared to be a leader. 
</P>
<P>
But while fellow receivers Dennis Arey and Patrick Rowe have taken turns atop 
the national receiving charts, Raye, the H-back, has quietly became a role 
player. It's third down and short? Get the ball to Raye. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the Hawaii game, he had 29 receptions for 222 yards. Rowe and Arey? 
They had caught 43 passes apiece, Rowe for 843 yards and Arey for 742. 
</P>
<P>
Raye was frustrated. It was more than simply statistics. Mainly, SDSU was 
having a disappointing season. The Aztecs had won only three of their first 
seven games. And, Raye had dropped a few balls this season, most notably one in 
the end zone during a victory over Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I wasn't doing my part to help the team," Raye said. 
</P>
<P>
And Saturday he was in the middle of the Hawaii defense, running wildly for the 
end zone. 
</P>
<P>
He made it. He crossed the goal line untouched, completing the long leg of a 
44-yard touchdown pass from Dan McGwire, giving the Aztecs a 7-0 lead with 9:51 
to play in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Hasn't he always made it? This is a guy who many said was too small and too 
slow, and yet he is completing his fifth year of football at SDSU (he 
redshirted his freshman year). This is a football player who, at 5-foot-8, 
could get lost in a group of sportswriters, and, at 155 pounds, probably 
wouldn't outweigh many. Curtis Johnson, SDSU receivers' coach, said Raye ran a 
4.84 40-yard dash when Johnson arrived two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
How does that measure up? 
</P>
<P>
"That's probably a lineman's time," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Oh. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to hard work -- particularly this summer, when he pounded his body with 
weights and ran -- Raye's speed has improved, slightly. Johnson said the Aztecs 
haven't timed him lately, but he's probably down to a 4.55 or 4.6. Better, but 
still not enough to make cornerbacks shudder. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Raye finished the Hawaii game with 10 catches for 209 yards -- eighth 
best single-game total in SDSU history -- and the touchdown. Both the 
receptions and yards were career highs, and it was the first time this season 
he has gone over 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's made it easier to take, but I wouldn't say it made my season," 
Raye said. "I still have high expectations of myself. With three more games to 
go, I want to have three more good games. If it's possible, I want to end the 
season strong. What Saturday's game did for the most part was put me in the 
right frame of mind. I was starting to doubt my ability to play." 
</P>
<P>
Aztec coaches say the biggest reason Raye hasn't gotten the ball as much as 
Rowe and Arey is because of the way SDSU has been defensed this season. 
</P>
<P>
"With our running game and the way people have been running coverages, he 
hasn't been the guy who's been open," Coach Al Luginbill said. 
</P>
<P>
Against Cal State Long Beach, Raye caught just two passes for 14 yards. Against 
both Air Force and UCLA, it was two for 13. 
</P>
<P>
When you've grown up around football, those kinds of games are difficult to 
take. Raye is the son of Jimmy Raye II, the offensive coordinator of the New 
England Patriots and a former Michigan State quarterback. Raye II was the MSU 
quarterback when the Spartans played Notre Dame in the 1966 "Game of the 
Decade." 
</P>
<P>
Raye doesn't remember his father's playing days, but by the time he was old 
enough to go to school, his father was coaching -- the San Francisco 49ers 
first, followed by Detroit, Atlanta, the Los Angeles Rams, Tampa Bay, Atlanta 
again and now New England. 
</P>
<P>
Raye has watched film with his father from the time he was 6 or 7, and he would 
attend training camp, get to know the players and learn football. He was a 
ballboy in Atlanta's training camp for three years, starting when he was 11. 
Several of the players became like older brothers to him, particularly 
receivers Alfred Jenkins, Alfred Jackson and Wallace Francis. 
</P>
<P>
Football lives are never easy and, in this case, the game made Raye and his 
father close, but it has also distanced them. They talk on the telephone once 
or twice a week, but the last time Raye's father saw him play in person was 
when Jimmy was a junior at Irvine High and his father was coaching the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Raye's father almost saw him play a college game once. It was in 1988, when 
Atlanta played at San Francisco and the Aztecs were at Stanford. But Jimmy Raye 
II's plane didn't land in San Francisco until the third quarter of the SDSU 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing I regret about this job more than anything else. . . . I'd trade 
it all in for the chance to share his experience," Jimmy Raye II said this week 
during a break from watching films in the Patriot offices. "To be there and 
watch him play, live, and to be there when he comes out of the locker room. I'd 
trade it all in. But it pays the bills." 
</P>
<P>
During their telephone conversations this year, Raye has tried to mask his 
disappointment at the way the season has gone. He figures his father has things 
difficult enough the way the Patriots are playing. But it has been difficult to 
hide it all. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really pleased at his fortitude, how he has hung in there," Jimmy Raye II 
said. "I told him to stay in there and when the phone rings, be ready to answer 
it. Those things have a way of working out." 
</P>
<P>
That's what Johnson has been telling Raye, too. Be patient, Johnson has said. 
You'll get your chance. The ball will come to you. 
</P>
<P>
But it didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps me to get the ball early in the game, to get into the flow," Raye 
said. "In the early part of the season, it didn't happen. I found myself losing 
concentration during a game, and a ball would come to me and I might drop it 
because I wasn't concentrating." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, SDSU's H-back, Monty Gilbreath, was the team's leading receiver. 
Maybe that's why Raye expected to help the Aztecs more than he has. Maybe, too, 
that's why opposing defenses have, for the most part, taken the H-back out of 
the offense. 
</P>
<P>
But then, a sliver of light appeared. Here came Hawaii, and SDSU coaches told 
Raye to get ready. They had noticed something. 
</P>
<P>
"(Hawaii) tried to cover him with a linebacker," Luginbill said. "Anytime 
anybody does that, the H-back in our offense is going to catch a bunch of 
passes and probably have some big plays." 
</P>
<P>
To Raye's delight, the Rainbows learned that the hard way. He is a forgotten 
man in SDSU's offense no longer. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really good to see him catch some balls," McGwire said. "He's got that 
fire in his eyes. 'Give me the ball.' He's got an itch for the end zone when he 
gets the ball. I've got an extreme amount of confidence in him." 
</P>
<P>
Said Raye: "I kind of felt like I was due. Sometime during the season, 
something big was going to happen. It all came together in one game." 
</P>
<P>
And now, after Rowe and Arey's exploits this season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"You have a second to talk about Jimmy Raye?" someone asked Johnson one night 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy's turn now, eh?" Johnson asked back. 
</P>
<P>
You bet.

ROD BERNSTINE STILL BOTHERED BY HAMSTRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PATTERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rod Bernstine's hamstring is still bothering him, which probably means Ronnie 
Harmon will get increased playing time at running back for the second week in a 
row when the Chargers (5-5) play Sunday at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dan Henning said he wasn't sure if Bernstine would be able to play, 
though Bernstine said he felt a lot better in practice Wednesday than he did 
last week, when he could barely walk. Marion Butts, the starting running back 
who didn't start last week because of a thigh bruise, is likely to start 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon replaced Butts as the starter in Sunday's 19-7 victory over Denver and 
had a season-high 10 carries for a 7.1-yard average. Harmon has carried 39 
times in 10 games, which isn't a lot, but considering he had a total of 17 
carries all of last season in Buffalo, he isn't complaining. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, anything is better than Buffalo. This is his explanation for why he 
didn't play more while with the Bills: "Because the coach didn't like me and 
the quarterback didn't like me. It wasn't a matter of whether I could play or 
not it was a matter of if they wanted me in there or not. And that's just the 
way it went." 
</P>
<P>
Being a Charger is different. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is here to play football, not to see who likes who," Harmon said. 
"You come here to work. That's it. After that you go your separate ways. It 
shouldn't matter whether you like that person or not. As long as you do your 
job on the field that's all that matters." 
</P>
<P>
H-back Joe Caravello, who suffered a season-ending injury to his kneecap in 
practice three weeks ago, paid a visit to the Charger locker room. He was on 
crutches. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a brace that looked big enough for a redwood tree, Caravello said he 
feels bad not to be a part of the recent winning streak. That doesn't mean he's 
sorry they've picked up steam since he went down. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they go to the playoffs," he said. "That's the only way I can make any 
more incentives." 
</P>
<P>
Caravello, who had surgery two weeks ago, has begun rehabilitation but won't be 
healthy enough to play football for at least three months. 
</P>
<P>
Punter John Kidd switched dressing chambers Wednesday in search of a little 
solitude. He used to be next to kicker John Carney. No more. 
</P>
<P>
Carney kicked four field goals in Sunday's victory over the Broncos and there 
were so many reporters crowded around Carney that Kidd couldn't get to his 
locker. 
</P>
<P>
Wait long, John? 
</P>
<P>
"At least two or three minutes," he said. "At least." 
</P>
<P>
As Kidd was moving his stuff Wednesday, Carney said: "The man eats my Danish 
(pastry) and reads my newspaper and now he's dogging me." 
</P>
<P>
But at least Carney will have more room to hold court. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to convert this locker into a podium with a microphone," Kidd said. 
"There just wouldn't be room for all my stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Chargers questionable for Sunday's game: Bernstine (hamstring), linebacker 
Richard Brown (thigh), Butts (thigh), cornerback Gill Byrd (ankle), safety 
Vencie Glenn (thigh), guard David Richards (shin). 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City Chief injuries: Center Tim Grunhard (thumb), safety Jeff Donaldson 
(knee), and linebacker Dino Hackett (shoulder) are all questionable. 
</P>
<P>
Quick statistic: Dan Fouts is one of 10 NFL quarterbacks who has passed for 
more than 30,000 career yards. Fouts (43,040) reached this mark in 131 games, 
fewer than any of the others. John Unitas (40,239) reached this mark in 141 
games, Joe Montana (33,889) in 147. DON PATTERSON

VOLLEYBALL: HELIX TAKES A 31-MATCH WINNING STREAK INTO TONIGHT'S THE SECTION 
TITLE CHALLENGE. ALREADY, THE HIGHLANDERS POSSESS THE CONFIDENCE OF CHAMPIONS.

<P>
Michael Welch kicked back on the grass outside the Helix High gymnasium while 
his girls' volleyball team went through a light workout Tuesday afternoon in 
preparation for a San Diego Section Division II semifinal match that evening. 
</P>
<P>
The opponent would be Monte Vista, a fierce league rival that had twice given 
the Highlanders a scare during the regular season. This would be the most 
important match of the season. A victory would send Helix to its first section 
title game. 
</P>
<P>
Welch, a clean-cut 26-year-old, was asked to consider the possibility that his 
Highlanders might lose. Wild laughter was ringing through the open double 
doors. Welch smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't worry," he said. "We won't lose." 
</P>
<P>
Welch wasn't being brash. He was supremely confident, extremely nonchalant. And 
why not? His team was 30-0. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Welch inherited a team that was 0-16 the previous season. Nine months 
ago, the players decided 1990 would be the year Helix would win its first 
section championship. And Tuesday, Helix rescued itself from the clutches of 
defeat, trailing 2-1 in games, and defeated Monte Vista again, 10-15, 15-6, 
2-15, 15-2, 15-10, to advance to today's 5 p.m. final against Torrey Pines 
(24-2) at Mira Mesa High. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders defeated Torrey Pines, 15-9, 13-15, 15-13, Sept. 15 to capture 
the championship of the Helix Invitational. Although Torrey Pines remains 
ranked No. 3 in the state and Helix is unranked, no other Division 3-A team in 
county history has won 31 games in a row. Helix's 29 consecutive home victories 
are also a 3-A record. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlanders' all-senior lineup is 85-8 over the past three seasons. In 
1988, Helix won its first of three Grossmont 3-A League championships. Times 
have changed at a school where, Welch said, volleyball was considered nothing 
more than "a social sport," and the team had four different coaches in four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The team that once laughed when it lost now laughs only when it wins, which is 
all the time. After all, no Bill Walton basketball team at Helix was ever 31-0. 
</P>
<P>
"The desire of these girls is very high," Welch said. "It's not that they're 
not afraid of losing, it's just that they want to win and they're going to do 
whatever it takes." 
</P>
<P>
They've won with startling ease. Twenty-two of their victories have come in 
straight games. But they've come frightenly close to losing. There was the 
scare Halloween night, when Granite Hills had match point in the fourth game. 
Then there was Tuesday's semifinal, a two-hour marathon played in front of the 
relentless screams of a packed crowd in the Serra High gym. 
</P>
<P>
The streak, as well as a season of hopes and dreams, was all but over. Helix 
went into the tank in its 15-2 loss in game three, unable to serve, receive or 
finish any ball. The team was emotionally frazzled. 
</P>
<P>
But Welch, unfazed, gathered his girls and said "all we need is two more 
games." Helix scored the first point of game four by saving a ball that 
ricocheted wildly off a ceiling cross beam. 
</P>
<P>
And so started the team's greatest comeback. 
</P>
<P>
"This was one of the greatest displays of heart I've seen," said Karrie Downey, 
Helix's heavily recruited middle blocker. "Nothing was there (in the third 
game). It was zero. We couldn't find a groove." 
</P>
<P>
There are two obvious reasons for the miraculous turnaround in the Highlanders 
and their uncanny success this season: Welch and Downey. 
</P>
<P>
When Welch -- who grew up in the San Fernando Valley and played volleyball at 
L.A. Pierce College and Cal State Chico -- interviewed for the Helix job, 
administrators made him promise he would stay for more than a year. He promised 
that and much more. 
</P>
<P>
Welch and his assistant, Thad Trent, 23, brought a youthful exuberance, putting 
together a team program that resembles a press guide and starting a newsletter 
this season. He leaves volleyball updates on his telephone answering machine. 
He coordinated a fund-raising efforts to send his team to an August tournament 
in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
He's also brought the poise and determination of a taskmaster. During 
practices, Welch puts his starters in impossible-to-win circumstances, stacking 
the opposition, playing against them himself and making them score three times 
to earn a point. This, he says, takes the anxiety out of real matches. 
</P>
<P>
"You see them right now," he said before Tuesday's match. "It's three hours 
before the semifinal match and they're so relaxed, it's like they're getting 
ready to go to the beach." 
</P>
<P>
The girls' challenge to win the section title was the result of a goal-setting 
session Welch held with the players and parents in February. 
</P>
<P>
"The players themselves decided," he said. "If I tell them what they want -- if 
I say, 'Hey girls, you want to win CIF?' -- it doesn't mean that much. Now I 
remind them, 'This is what you decided you want. How are you going to get 
there?' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't coach by telling them. I coach by asking them questions. 'What did you 
do wrong? How can you improve on that?' So by game time, they feel comfortable 
with their own decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Welch made his boldest move late in the season when he put the team through a 
second conditioning program, the type normally set aside for the preseason. The 
long workouts, filled with intense speed drills, left the players gasping down 
the stretch. Now, he says, the team is physically peaking. 
</P>
<P>
But Welch's best ploy may have come in Hawaii, when he took a team separated by 
cliques and mixed the girls in different hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Said Welch, "Now people I thought would never be friends are best friends." 
</P>
<P>
Welch has never been one to put up with nonsense, and he had to make that point 
immediately when he took the team in 1987. After a winless 1986, Helix finished 
9-13. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time I got here, (the program) had hit rock bottom," he said. "After a 
loss, they'd all be laughing. I had to tell them, 'It's not OK to lose. You 
just humiliated yourselves.' " 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Helix jumped to 26-5 and its first league title. In 1989, the 
Highlanders finished 29-3, falling to Torrey Pines, ranked 15th in the country, 
in the section semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
But Welch would be hard-pressed to figure what Helix's fortunes would be 
without Downey, whom he calls the top college prospect in the county. The 
5-foot-10 senior is a remarkable athlete, with a vertical leap near 31 inches, 
lightning quickness and breathtaking reflexes at the net. In four years, three 
as a starter, she has 1,109 kills, 277 blocks for points and 208 service aces. 
Her season totals thus far are 411, 104 and 79. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate stats," Downey said after her best match ever Tuesday. She finished 
with 27 kills and seven blocks and dominated the most important night in the 
program's history. 
</P>
<P>
"There are times that she is the most unbelievable player I've ever seen," 
Welch said. "If she gets this burning desire in her, forget it. Turn out the 
lights, shut the door and leave." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Downey and others must face the realization that Torrey Pines could turn 
out the lights on Helix's fairy tale season tonight. All great teams lose 
sometime. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at our team compared to Torrey Pines, man-for-man we're not at 
their level at all," Downey said. "We may not have the strongest hitters in the 
county and we may not have best defensive players, but we have a lot of heart. 
When times get tough, we pull together. We're a comeback team. 
</P>
<P>
"I love this team."

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: IT'LL TAKE AN UPSET TO DISLODGE THE 3-A FAVORITE; KEARNY,

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Where's Jose Rijo when you need him? 
</P>
<P>
Rijo, the Cincinnati Reds' unofficial prognosticator, repeatedly proclaimed the 
regular season and postseasons to be over before they were. For him, the San 
Diego Section 3-A football playoffs would be easy. 
</P>
<P>
Morse? 
</P>
<P>
"It's over." 
</P>
<P>
Rijo would have said that three weeks ago when the Tigers pounded Point Loma, 
40-13. That was one of Morse's toughest games during a marvelous 10-0 season. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it is not over, but Morse is the overwhelming pick to run away with 
its second championship in three years. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers, with two certain all-county players -- tailback Gary Taylor and 
quarterback Teddy Lawrence -- in their backfield, have the most prolific 
offense in the history of California high school football, according to state 
records compiled by Cal-Hi Magazine. With 489 points, Morse surpassed the state 
regular-season scoring record by one point. Vallejo High set the old mark in 
1954 with Dick Bass running in the offense. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine anybody beating Morse," Lincoln Coach Vic Player said. "That's 
one of the best teams I've seen around here in a long, long time." 
</P>
<P>
And how does Morse Coach John Shacklett react to the praise being heaped on his 
team? 
</P>
<P>
"That's kind of nice," he said. "Very flattering. But that's all it is." 
</P>
<P>
In defense of the top challengers, they all have good ones. Helix, which 
allowed 2.5 points per game, Chula Vista, 9.0, and Point Loma, 9.3, have the 
top three scoring defenses in the county. Mira Mesa is sixth at 11.6. Rancho 
Buena Vista allowed four more points this season than a year ago, when it 
defeated Morse -- the last team to do so -- in the 3-A championship game. 
</P>
<P>
There have been bigger upsets should someone like Helix (8-1), Rancho Buena 
Vista (8-2), Point Loma (8-1), Mira Mesa (8-2) or even Chula Vista (8-2) manage 
to defeat Morse somewhere along the line. But should any of the other 10 teams 
in the 3-A playoffs knock off the only unbeaten team in the county . . . well, 
the Reds swept the A's. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-A, it is a completely different story. 
</P>
<P>
Parity dominates both brackets, with no clear-cut favorite in either of them. 
</P>
<P>
Kearny (8-1-1) is a worthy choice but probably can be taken out of its game. 
Stop Darnay Scott and you likely will have stopped the Komets. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino, the defending 2-A champion, has won six of its last seven, but lost 
its first three. Its most recent loss was 17-16 to Oceanside (4-4-2). 
</P>
<P>
West Hills, not even picked to win the Grossmont 2-A League at the beginning of 
the season, is in a position to do what Rancho Buena Vista did two years ago 
and El Camino in 1976, win a championship in its first season with a senior 
class. The Wolf Pack (8-2), winner of seven in a row, including three against 
3-A teams, was the only team in the county returning its entire starting lineup 
from last year. 
</P>
<P>
Madison (6-4) won the City Central League in its first year after moving from 
the City Western. St. Augustine (6-3-1) won the first City Harbor League 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla (8-1-1) tied for the City Western title with Kearny, but missed a 
chance at the league's No. 1 position in the playoffs by one foot. After the 
Vikings had tied Kearny in the regular season, the Komets won the tiebreaker, 
8-6. La Jolla's Steve Alford was stopped at the one-foot line by Scott on a 
two-point conversion attempt. 
</P>
<P>
And then there are the other non-championship teams, five of them from the 
Avocado League, where there were six ties this season. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad (7-2-1), Ramona (5-5), San Marcos (6-3-1), Escondido (5-5) and 
Oceanside have all been hot at some point in the season and are all capable of 
at least advancing to the second round. 
</P>
<P>
Said El Camino Coach Herb Meyer, "Like somebody told me last week, 'You've got 
to go back and re-win the league.' " 
</P>
<P>
Two other teams -- Grossmont and Lincoln -- should not be counted out, either. 
Grossmont, which tied Lincoln in the quarterfinals last year but lost on a 
tiebreaker, again was playing well before going 1-1-1 to end the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
A young Lincoln lost its first five games for the first time since 1969, and 
most wrote them out of the playoff picture all together. After that, the 
Hornets changed the offensive personnel around, won four of their last five and 
sneaked into the playoffs. You can bet La Jolla is not overlooking its 
first-round opponent from the Central League. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla-Lincoln, originally scheduled for Saturday, has been moved to 7:30 
p.m. Friday at Patrick Henry High. 
</P>
<P>
Should Lincoln win it all, it would finish 8-6, which would stir up the 
two-year-old argument about having 16 teams in each division. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Section expanded to a 12-team draw for each division in the 
mid-1980s and to 16 teams last year. A few, like Castle Park Coach Jorge 
Mancillas, felt the honor was missing in going to the playoffs with a .500 
record or worse. Mancillas chose not to attend the seeding meeting, which 
automatically eliminated Castle Park (5-5) and had rippling effects elsewhere 
in the 3-A pairings. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater Coach Andy Sanchez, who played with Mancillas on the 1968 Castle 
Park team that won the county championship and is still good friends with him, 
said Castle Park's absence from the playoffs cost Sweetwater (7-3) a chance at 
hosting a first-round game. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Red Devils will play at Rancho Buena Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, if Morse continues playing as it has, will it really matter?

"Picnic at Hanging Rock" (1975), directed by Peter Weir. 115 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Rated R. An early gem from the director of "Dead Poets' Society" and "Witness," 
this one is set in 1900 Australia, where three girls and their teacher vanish 
while on a school outing. A psychedelic/supernatural story supposedly based on 
an actual account. 
</P>
<P>
"Miracle Mile" (1989), directed by Steve DeJarnatt. 87 minutes. Rated R. Among 
the best of the nuclear apocalyptic films, the mood of this one resembles that 
of the quirky "After Midnight." A man races against time after mistakenly 
receiving a message that missiles have been launched and World War III is an 
hour away. Intense, humorous and powerful. ERIK HAMILTON

"Koyaanisqatsi" (1983), directed by Godfrey Reggio. 87 minutes. No rating. For 
the art film devotees among us, a movie with visual splendor and a hauntingly 
rich score by composer Philip Glass. 
</P>
<P>
It first lulls with serene images of nature, then abruptly cuts to man's 
destructive influence over the very planet that sustains him. The title is Hopi 
Indian for "life out of balance." 
</P>
<P>
"Fright Night" (1985), directed by Tom Holland. 105 minutes. Rated R. Scary, 
funny and intentionally campy, "Fright Night" involves a teen-ager who thinks 
his new next-door neighbor is a vampire. Chris Sarandon makes a wisecracking, 
smug resident Dracula, and Roddy McDowall plays "The Great Vampire Killer" with 
verve. A perfect mix of comedy and chills. MIKE BELL

If you're looking for ferns and mineral water, don't come here. It's strictly

In the early 1920s it was a barbershop, serving root beer and sandwiches to 
waiting customers. When Prohibition ended, the health department said either 
serve food and beer or cut hair. The beer still comes in frosted 20-ounce 
schooners, the eggs are pickled on the premises, there's pool and snooker in 
the back room, and freshly roasted peanuts and cigars are sold behind the bar.

Birraporetti's, 3333 Bristol St. (in South Coast Plaza, near Sears), Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Open from 11 a.m. daily. Last call is 1:30 a.m. (714) 860-9090. A gleaming, 
upscale watering hole with lots of room to stretch out and a hassle-free 
environment. It attracts a somewhat cosmopolitan clientele, but if your idea of 
a bar is to jockey for room along with lots of vivacious, talkative people, 
well . . . have you thought of moving to Chicago? CATHY CURTIS

THE CORNER BAR: MILD EXCITEMENT WHERE ONCE WERE ONLY LIMA BEANS

There's a good reason the drinking age in California is 21 -- kids would be 
bored by most bars. Their protest would probably have something to do with bars 
being dank, cramped, Naugahyde-filled places. 
</P>
<P>
I think kids have a good point. I like cavernous bars that promise mild 
excitement and pollution-free lungs upon departure. 
</P>
<P>
I've found such a place at Tia Juana's in Old Irvine, which is housed inside a 
restored 95-year-old lima bean warehouse. The zeppelin-like wood and corrugated 
metal ceiling guarantees that the A-bomb could go off inside and not smoke up 
the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The bar itself is 75 feet long, providing plenty of room to belly up to or -- 
for the less sociable among us -- there are private tables, some with views of 
the trains that zing by outside. 
</P>
<P>
Order a cerveza (they claim to serve any Mexican beer an aficionado can name) 
or one of their hand-shaken (never blended) margaritas on the rocks, and 
pretend you're inside some upscale south-of-the-border restaurant that actually 
has napkins. 
</P>
<P>
The sweet-and-sour margarita mix is produced by a local "juicer" exclusively 
for Tia Juana's. Customers, who range from construction workers trucking in off 
the Santa Ana Freeway to Irvine Spectrum suits rolling in after a hard day of 
reconfiguring the wheel, can harden the mix with one of 18 different kinds of 
tequila. 
</P>
<P>
Mercifully, airings of Monday Night Football occur only once a week, replaced 
the other six nights by live music. Rock 'n' roll gets its moment Fridays and 
Saturdays, and a South American Folk duo plays guitars and pan flutes Sundays, 
Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, you can eat Mexican food here too, underneath a platoon of pinatas. 
Ever dined with a papier-mache Ninja Turtle dangling above you? Now that's what 
I call mild excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 Tia Juana's Long Bar &amp; Mexican Cafe Deluxe, 14988 Sand Canyon Ave., 
Irvine. The bar is open 11 a.m to midnight Sunday through Thursday, till 1:30 
a.m. Friday and Saturday. (714) 551-2998.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: FAST FOOD THAT'S FRUGAL, FRENCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If you're among the gastronomic skeptics who consider the phrase fast food as 
an oxymoron that ranks up there with "military intelligence," Petite France 
might well change your mind. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: Grilled chicken in a pithy lime caper sauce, served with a side of 
fresh steamed vegetables and a choice of pasta, rice or a roll, for $3.95. More 
in the mood for seafood? Check out the prawns sauteed with cilantro sauce for 
$4.95. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to pull out all the stops, try the beef bourguignon in a red wine 
sauce for $4.25. Or if you're truly a big spender, sample the New York steak 
with herb or shallot sauce -- that's a hefty $5.95. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Petite France's menu offers four chicken entrees, three beef, one pork, 
three fish and two with prawns -- all but the New York steak are under $5. 
There are also three modest salads available. 
</P>
<P>
About the only giveaways that this store-front stand is a low-budget operation 
are the foam serving trays and plastic utensils. The quality of the food is 
light years beyond the nearest Happy Star. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is that Petite France is run by a Vietnamese family that has paid 10 
years of dues in a number of French restaurants, including Au Chambertin in 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
The best dish I've had was a filet of trout in a champagne sauce, although the 
champagne sauce has been supplanted by a pink sauce with the trout on the 
recently revamped menu. 
</P>
<P>
Located in a shopping center at Harbor and Newport Boulevards, Petite France 
has been open less than a year and already has gone through a name change as a 
result of a split in the business partnership. (Originally it was "Poulet de 
France," a name the other partner has taken to Newport Beach.) 
</P>
<P>
The owners have applied for a beer-wine license to supplement their modest soft 
drink list and plan to expand the operation by opening a full-service 
restaurant in Santa Ana by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Petite France, 1835 Newport Blvd., Suite D-156, Costa Mesa. Open daily, except 
Sunday, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. (714) 650-9363.

USED NEEDLE EXPOSES PATIENT TO AIDS; 
</P>
<P>
DISEASE: A SYRINGE USED ON AN AIDS PATIENT IS REUSED ON A WOMAN BEING TREATED 
AT MERCY HOSPITAL FOR A MINOR BACK INJURY. FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES ARE 
INVESTIGATING, AND A LAWSUIT IS PENDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A 23-year-old San Diego woman was exposed to a deadly virus at a hospital here 
after having been treated with a syringe used previously on a patient with 
AIDS, medical officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, whose name was not released, was notified by doctors at Mercy 
Hospital 36 hours after being treated for job-related back pain that she had 
been exposed to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, her 
attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and the 
State Department of Health Services confirmed Wednesday that the incident, 
which happened Sept. 25, is under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Levine, the attorney representing the woman and her family, said 
Wednesday he intends to file suit in February against Mercy Hospital and its 
parent corporation, Catholic Health Care West. 
</P>
<P>
Levine said a 90-day waiting period accompanies any case in which doctors or 
hospitals are named as defendants. He said officials at Mercy, which is in the 
Hillcrest section of San Diego, have refused to provide records pertaining to 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
Levine said this is the first case in the United States in which a patient has 
been exposed to an AIDS-related virus through injection with a syringe used 
previously on another person -- a claim federal and state officials could not 
confirm. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Keyser, the president of Mercy Hospital, acknowledged Wednesday that a 
critical mistake was made. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why the syringe was not disposed of, he said, "Obviously, that should 
have happened." 
</P>
<P>
"The medical risk to this patient is very limited," Keyser said, because the 
needle was inserted into a tube, which was attached to the woman's body, rather 
than being injected directly through the skin. 
</P>
<P>
Levine said his client may know within three months whether she's HIV-positive, 
but she faces "an umbrella of danger" for the rest of her life. 
</P>
<P>
"She faces issues of future employability, problems in her relationships with 
men and in whether she's eligible for certain types of health insurance," 
Levine said. "This is a nightmare of major proportions." 
</P>
<P>
Levine said the woman, whose occupation he refused to disclose, was sent to the 
hospital with an "insignificant lower-back injury" she sustained at work. She 
received a magnetic resonance imaging test -- a type of X-ray -- which turned 
up negative. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no problem with her disc or cervical spine," Levine said. "It was 
very minor. For some reason, the worker's compensation doctor decided to order 
a bone scan. That involved a radioisotope-dye injection, which would have 
detected a herniated disc. Even without the risk of AIDS, they should have 
realized that radioisotope dye, once it's used, is nothing less than nuclear 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
"She received the injection, and 36 hours later, on Sept. 27, she received a 
call at 1:15 a.m. She was told to report to the hospital immediately, that she 
'might have caught a virus.' She reports to the hospital and is greeted by the 
head of the radiology department, a hospital vice president and a physician who 
specializes in infectious diseases. 
</P>
<P>
"She was then told she had been injected with a syringe used previously on a 
patient known to be HIV-positive, and that the same syringe, instead of being 
disposed of by the attending technician, was then used on her. They refused to 
explain how or why such a mistake occurred." 
</P>
<P>
Levine and physicians unrelated to the case say it is customary for "any and 
all" syringes to be disposed of as soon as they're used. 
</P>
<P>
"The standard procedure is that you never use a used syringe on another 
person," said Dr. Donald Ramras, deputy director of the San Diego County Health 
Services Department. "You use a syringe only once. Obviously, someone made a 
big mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Keyser refused to name the technician who made the injection but did say the 
person was no longer employed by the hospital. He refused to say whether the 
technician had been fired. 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Trujillo, district manager for the division of licensing and 
certification for the State Department of Health Services, confirmed Wednesday 
that his agency is investigating the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Trujillo said Mercy Hospital reported the incident to his agency in early 
October, about a week after it happened. He said the worst that could happen to 
Mercy would be a review that might cause the hospital's certification to be 
re-evaluated on a state and federal level. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. George Rutherford, the chief of the infectious diseases branch of the State 
Department of Health Services, said Wednesday that he's more concerned "about 
the larger issues this case raises." 
</P>
<P>
"Are there blind spots involving infection control that we're overlooking?" 
Rutherford said from his office in Berkeley. "Procedures are quite a bit 
different now than they were five years ago, before AIDS became so prominent. 
</P>
<P>
"With the advent of AIDS, infection control guidelines have been extensively 
revamped. But our concern is whether they're adequate enough even now to 
address all possible situations. The harsh reality in a hospital setting is, we 
need to treat everyone as if they have a highly infectious disease." 
</P>
<P>
Rutherford said that, in developing countries, needles are re-used "constantly, 
but in the United States? No, it's a big no-no, even before the AIDS scare." 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Levine accused the hospital of trying to cover up the mistake, but 
Keyser said the "error was not detected until about 24 hours after it was 
made." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't wish to comment on that," Keyser said. "Our No. 1 concern right now is 
that patient. We contacted her and got the infectious-disease specialist 
involved in it immediately. We're very concerned. Any time something isn't in 
the best interest of a patient, it's a big concern to everybody around here. 
We're doing everything we can to see that an incident like this never happens 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Levine said he also wondered whether other patients at Mercy might have been 
exposed -- which Keyser heatedly denied. Levine said his client is now 
suffering side effects from injections of AZT, an anti-viral drug used to slow 
the march of the AIDS virus through the body's system. 
</P>
<P>
"The people at Mercy traumatized her," Levine said. "They forced a terrible 
decision on her with AZT, saying she might incur risks of cancer, as well as 
liver and kidney damage, but 'It's up to you.' "

COUNTY SAYS TAX DEFEAT THREATENS 21 PROJECTS; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: OPPONENTS OF THE HIKE MAINTAIN THEY WERE CORRECT IN THEIR BELIEF 
THAT MEASURE A WOULD HAVE ENCOURAGED GROWTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Twenty-one proposed developments in the Santa Rosa and Ojai valleys are in 
jeopardy because voters rejected funding for road improvements under Measure A, 
county planners said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists say the county's announcement reveals an important issue they 
say some officials tried to play down throughout the election: Measure A would 
have encouraged growth. 
</P>
<P>
"This just affirms our judgment," said Neil Moyer, an opponent of Measure A, 
which lost in last week's election by a 2-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ventura County Planning Director Keith A. Turner, the county's 
General Plan prohibits development where there are inadequate roads to handle 
an influx of new residents. 
</P>
<P>
And since the county does not have the funding to improve Santa Rosa Road or 
California 33, county staff will suggest that officials deny the proposed 
developments -- which would add 370 residential units to the two most rapidly 
developing areas of the county, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors still have the 
option of going against the staff recommendation and approving the projects, 
such action would be difficult to justify, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
"Without Measure A, we don't see any source of money to allow the projects to 
go forward," Turner said. The measure, which would have raised the sales tax 
half a cent, sought $24 million to improve Santa Rosa and Moorpark roads and 
$30 million to widen California 33. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the election, officials for the Ventura County Transportation 
Commission and the state Department of Transportation said the measure would 
not encourage development. On Wednesday, Mary Travis, project manager of the 
transportation commission, held fast to that position. 
</P>
<P>
"There are other safeguards, such as air quality measures, that would have 
stopped the projects," Travis said. 
</P>
<P>
But Supervisor John Flynn said Wednesday that he agrees with the 
environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it," Flynn said. "It's like water. If you don't have it, you don't 
have growth." 
</P>
<P>
He said he had supported the measure because it would have placed the county in 
a better position when bidding for state funds to upgrade other roads in the 
county and to construct the link between the Simi Valley and Moorpark freeways. 
</P>
<P>
But Flynn and Supervisor Maggie Erickson said they will go along with staff 
recommendations to halt the developments in the Santa Rosa and Ojai valleys if 
there is not adequate funding to upgrade roads. 
</P>
<P>
"The roads are already overburdened," Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
The first nine of the 21 proposed developments are scheduled to go before the 
County Planning Commission this morning. According to county planners, the 
projects -- which would have added 278 homes on 370 acres in the Santa Rosa 
Valley, east of Camarillo between Thousand Oaks and Moorpark -- seemed headed 
for approval until Measure A was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo officials, who have complained that the developments would have 
burdened their roads and resources, said they were pleased with the staff 
recommendation to reject the projects, referred to as the Caston Trust 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager William Little said his staff will attend the meeting to encourage 
the Planning Commission to follow the staff recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
"These proposed developments are just beyond the resources of the area," Little 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the commissioners do, the proposed developments will go before the 
Board of Supervisors on Dec. 4, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he did not know when the other projects -- which include six more in 
the Santa Rosa Valley and six in the Ojai Valley -- will come up for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Klaiber, vice president for Hamdan Project Development Corp., which has 
proposed one of the nine developments in the Santa Rosa Valley, said he had 
been watching Measure A. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Measure A would have been very helpful," he said. Without it, he said, 
developers are in a "wait-and-see" mode.

COUNCIL PANEL OKS EXTENDING BEACH BOOZE BAN; 
</P>
<P>
RECREATION: TRIAL BAN MADE TWO LOCATIONS SAFER, CLEANER AND QUIETER, RESIDENTS 
SAY. THE FULL COUNCIL MUST APPROVE EXPANDING THE BAN TO MOST OTHER CITY 
BEACHES. 
</P>

<P>
Impressed with the results of a trial ban on alcohol at a city beach and inland 
park, a San Diego City Council committee Wednesday recommended making those 
prohibitions permanent and extending the ban to most other city beaches. 
</P>
<P>
With area residents saying that the test ban has made La Jolla Shores' Kellogg 
Park and the North Park Community Park safer, cleaner and quieter, the 
council's Public Facilities and Recreation Committee voted unanimously to 
extend the no-alcohol restrictions to other beaches stretching from Mission 
Beach to the city's northern border. Larsen Field in San Ysidro also would be 
included in the ban. 
</P>
<P>
"The beach has been returned to the families -- it's the best thing you've ever 
done," said La Jolla resident Lewis Musser. "The homeless, winos, druggies and 
gangs are gone." 
</P>
<P>
Although the committee's recommendation to extend the ban from Mission Beach to 
Del Mar must be approved by the full council in January, the panel's 5-0 vote 
Wednesday demonstrated that a majority of the nine-member council favors such 
an expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Under Wednesday's action, the committee also will consider extending the ban to 
Mission Bay Park, as well as to other city beaches and inland parks, early next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The strong council support for extending the alcohol ban stems from the success 
of the experimental restrictions that began at La Jolla Shores and North Park 
in August. The six-month trial ban, scheduled to expire next February, was 
adopted after a proposed citywide ban on drinking at beaches and parks sparked 
a spirited citizens' protest, prompting the council to retreat to a more 
limited experiment. 
</P>
<P>
According to a city manager's report, the ban has dramatically reduced noise, 
vandalism and litter at La Jolla Shores, its adjacent Kellogg Park and North 
Park Community Park. 
</P>
<P>
At La Jolla Shores, for example, there was only half as much litter and trash 
over the Labor Day holiday as there had been on July 4, city maintenance 
workers reported. Similarly, the ban produced "marked improvements in park 
safety" at North Park, with a 64% drop in calls to police, a 75% decline in 
graffiti and vandalism, less gang presence and reductions in the homeless 
population, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"By all measures, the trials were successful," said Terri Williams, deputy 
director of the city Park and Recreation Department's coastal division. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 20 beach-community residents who testified at Wednesday's hearing 
concurred with that assessment, as they urged the council to not only extend 
the current ban but also to expand it to other neighborhoods. In some areas 
such as Mission Beach, residents argued that the ban should apply not only to 
the beach itself, but to nearby streets as well to prevent rowdiness and other 
drinking problems from simply being pushed back several blocks into the 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"Mission Beach cannot tolerate alcohol any longer in public places," said 
resident Pat Gallagher. "There can't be any halfway about it. We're dealing 
with an element that has no respect for public property, no respect for laws, 
no respect for anything." 
</P>
<P>
Since the trial ban took effect last summer, opponents have argued that the 
restriction unfairly punishes law-abiding individuals who responsibly enjoy an 
occasional drink at beaches or parks. It is fairer, they contend, to simply 
have the police cite people who are publicly intoxicated or overly rowdy than 
to forbid everyone from drinking in recreational areas. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing that sentiment, City Councilman Bruce Henderson initially expressed 
skepticism about a broad expansion of the ban, arguing that "fair and quick 
punishment of offenders" is preferable to "taking the rights of ordinary 
citizens away." 
</P>
<P>
Seeking a "less intrusive approach," Henderson suggested that any expansion of 
the ban to Mission Beach be limited to 15-foot strips along the oceanfront 
walkways -- a proposal that was rejected as ineffective and unenforceable. 
</P>
<P>
Others, moreover, argued that allowing alcohol at beaches and parks harms the 
rights of a majority of beach-goers, with loud beach parties and a small number 
of ill-behaved drinkers ruining non-drinkers' enjoyment. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality is that a majority of the people who come to the beach don't 
drink," said Bill Luther, president of the Mission Beach Town Council. "A 
minority of the users are ruining it for the majority." 
</P>
<P>
The only objection to the alcohol ban at Wednesday's meeting came from two 
graduate students at UC San Diego, Daved Fremont and Laura Tedder, who said 
that beachfront residents' complaints dealt more with crime and vagrancy than 
with drunkenness. Tedder also drew hisses and boos from the crowd when she 
suggested that many of those in favor of the ban "really are interested in 
raising the value of their property." 
</P>
<P>
Framing the issue, Councilman Bob Filner, the committee's chairman, said that, 
although he sympathizes with the complaints that an across-the-board ban would 
outlaw even responsible drinking, such restrictions are needed to protect the 
public's access to beaches and parks. 
</P>
<P>
"We have red lights at streets, even though a lot of people are inconvenienced 
by them and people probably could pass safely without them," Filner said. "In 
the interest of the general public, you need some safety guidelines. This is 
one of those areas where you have to give up something for the greater good."

METZGER REJECTS DEAL TO LET HIM REMAIN IN HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
White supremacist Tom Metzger defiantly rejected an agreement that would have 
allowed him to temporarily remain in his Fallbrook home if he shut down his 
nationwide racist campaign, a San Diego attorney said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
James E. McElroy, a lawyer representing the family of a Portland, Ore., man who 
allegedly died at the hands of Metzger-inspired "skinheads," said the agreement 
would have kept the 52-year-old television repairman from losing his home while 
appealing a multimillion-dollar civil judgment against him. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the agreement, Metzger, the leader of the group White Aryan 
Resistance, was to "shut down his hate machine," suspending publication of his 
newspaper and taped telephone messages on his national hot line, McElroy said. 
</P>
<P>
Metzger was also to cancel his "Race and Reason" cable TV show and not make any 
public appearances to further his white supremacist cause, or start any new 
racially motivated organizations. 
</P>
<P>
He would also have had to sacrifice the deed to his ranch-style home -- valued 
at about $100,000 -- to the family of the late Mulugeta Seraw until 30 days 
after the result of his court appeal, the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
"The deal was for Tom Metzger to quit the war business," McElroy said, "to quit 
rabble-rousing people across the country to hate nonwhites and Jews. Stop your 
organization, and we'll stop trying to collect on your house." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, however, the day after McElroy sent a written copy of the 
agreement for Metzger to sign, Metzger instead sent copies of the four-page 
agreement to the press -- along with a drawing decrying what he called an 
"exorcism of freedom of speech." 
</P>
<P>
The cartoon shows a Metzger look-alike riding the back and covering the mouth 
of attorney Morris Dees, who last month won a $12.5-million judgment against 
Metzger and several others. 
</P>
<P>
"You can take my house, my business, my income from me and my family of eight," 
the cartoon reads. "But you can't take my FREEDOM! Morris, GO TO HELL!" 
</P>
<P>
In a faxed copy of the cartoon to McElroy, Metzger also scribbled the message: 
"Sorry Jim, no deal," the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
McElroy said he was confused by Metzger's mixed signals. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm befuddled, but then I'm frequently befuddled over what Tom Metzger does," 
he said. "I was trying to do him a favor by letting him stay in the house he 
and his wife have inhabited for years while he went about what could be a 
lengthy court appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"But he acts like I was trying to talk him into something. My response is to go 
full speed ahead. He could have done things the easy way. But, if Tom Metzger 
wants to do things the hard way, well, then, I'm his man. If he wants me to 
start getting tough today, then I'll do it. 
</P>
<P>
"Because this is going to be a long fight. This judgment is good for 20 years. 
And I'll be on his case for 20 years, grabbing every asset he ever dreamed of 
owning." 
</P>
<P>
Seraw, 27, was an Ethiopian immigrant who was beaten to death by Portland 
skinheads in November, 1988. A Multnomah County jury held in October that 
Metzger, his son John, 22, and the White Aryan Resistance took part in a civil 
conspiracy that resulted in Seraw's death. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Metzger intentionally sent recruiters to Portland with the mission to 
incite violence against blacks and Jews, the jury found. 
</P>
<P>
Metzger, reached Wednesday at his Fallbrook home, said he wasn't fooled by what 
he called a ploy to shut down his organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody shuts me up," he said. "I'll never sit still for any agreement to gag 
my phone line, newspaper or video show. There's no way nobody on this planet is 
going to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Metzger acknowledged that he met with McElroy two weeks ago at the attorney's 
San Diego office. "I went to hear what he had to say. I listened and I said, 
'Put it in writing,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
"What this shows is that the total mood behind that lawsuit had nothing to do 
with liability for that killing. The idea was always to shut me up in terms of 
my political beliefs. This was just another step in doing that." 
</P>
<P>
McElroy said Metzger initially agreed to the terms during their meeting but 
wanted them put in writing. "It was something we did confidentially. He told 
me, 'I'll do it.' And then he sends it to all the newspapers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like Tom is just searching for more media publicity, like he fears 
he's going to die once the spotlight is shifted from him," McElroy said. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Metzger also denied newspaper reports that half the money 
contributed to his organization was used to pay his credit card bill and other 
personal expenses that included $260 in payments for a hairpiece. 
</P>
<P>
"Brother, this is no doubt going to be a war," he said. "It's going to be a 
long war."

RETIRING DISTRICT HEAD TO BE HONORED

<P>
A reception today will honor Helen Beebe, who is retiring next month as board 
president of the Simi Valley Unified School District after more than 20 years 
in various district positions. 
</P>
<P>
Beebe, who has served on the board for nine years, started with the district in 
1968 as a junior high school principal and retired in 1981 as director of 
curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
She was appointed to the board in February, 1982, to fill a vacancy created 
when a member moved, and voters twice returned her to office. 
</P>
<P>
She did not seek reelection this year, saying that she wanted to spend more 
time volunteering for her church and for the American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
She is credited with pushing for smoke-free campuses and voluntary drug testing 
for athletes, and was a strong supporter of implementing a middle-school system 
in the district. 
</P>
<P>
"This community has a good school system, but I don't think they always 
appreciate it," said Beebe, who is 67. "They sometimes get bent out of shape 
about one issue and forget about the whole picture." 
</P>
<P>
The two board seats at stake in the Nov. 6 election were filled by political 
newcomer Carla Kurachi, who had 31.8% of the vote, and businessman Douglas 
Crosse, who had 20.1%, unseating incumbent Lewis Ross. 
</P>
<P>
The reception for Beebe will begin at 3:30 p.m. at the district's headquarters, 
875 E. Cochran St. Her last school board meeting will be Dec. 4, and the new 
board will meet Dec. 18. STEPHANIE STASSEL

FIRE AT COMPLEX TO DELAY NEW SCHOOL

<P>
A massive fire at a Thousand Oaks luxury apartment complex will delay 
construction of a $4-million elementary school in central Thousand Oaks, school 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the proposed school's 600-student population is expected to come from 
The Knolls complex, where a fire last Saturday destroyed 22 buildings and 
caused damage estimated at $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to revise our enrollment projections," said Ali Kiafar, 
director of planning and facilities for the Conejo Valley Unified School 
District. "Construction will definitely be postponed." 
</P>
<P>
The unnamed school was originally planned to be ready at the earliest by 
September, 1992. Exactly when the school will be constructed is contingent on 
rebuilding the destroyed apartments, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither officials of Regis Homes Corp. in Newport Beach nor Lang Ranch Co. in 
Thousand Oaks, co-owners of the project, could be reached for comment Tuesday. 
Kiafar said he plans to contact company officials later this week to discuss 
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Developer fees, required of new housing in the area, will pay for building the 
elementary school, which would serve kindergarten through sixth-grade students. 
The school, to be located at the corner of Whitechapel Place and Knightsbridge 
Avenue, will be equipped for computers in each classroom and will include an 
in-house cable system and a science lab. STEPHANIE STASSEL

DUFFY USED $61,802 OF SECRET FUND; 
</P>
<P>
SHERIFF: UNDER COURT ORDER, DUFFY REVEALS HOW HE SPENT MONEY FROM HIS SEIZED 
DRUG ASSETS ACCOUNT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
San Diego County Sheriff John Duffy distributed more than $60,000 in seized 
drug proceeds from a secret $1-million checking account he created to bypass 
the county's spending approval, according to a summary of the account released 
Wednesday under court order. 
</P>
<P>
Forced by court order Tuesday to turn over the $1.044 million he gathered in 
the secret account, Duffy also was under Superior Court Judge Harrison 
Hollywood's order to show during a hearing Wednesday how he spent the money. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all of the $61,802 he spent went to the district attorney's office for 
its participation in drug busts and to various city governments that contract 
with the Sheriff's Department for service and were entitled to share in the 
proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
But Duffy also spent $5,400 for an attorney to defend himself in a civil 
lawsuit. County auditors warned Duffy in June that spending drug money for 
attorneys was improper when they discovered that he paid nearly $70,000 earlier 
this year to the same law firm for the same purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood asked a court-appointed certified public accountant to verify Duffy's 
account. Duffy attorney Janet Houts said the sheriff has asked U.S. Atty. Gen. 
Dick Thornburgh to audit the entire county drug fund account. 
</P>
<P>
The county's sheriff for 20 years, Duffy's last term has been marked by 
continual controversy. He has been feuding with the Board of Supervisors for 
months over who controls the money and property the Sheriff's Department seizes 
in drug raids. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff had control of the money until July, when supervisors voted to 
usurp his spending authority. At the time, Duffy wanted to spend $450,000 on 
laptop computers for his department. Supervisors wanted the money spent on 
security measures at the South Bay jail in Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy lost the battle, but decided he would no longer let county supervisors 
determine how the money was spent. He said the county had violated federal 
guidelines for how the money can be spent. 
</P>
<P>
In September, he opened a checking account with the San Diego office of 
Security Pacific National Bank and deposited 11 checks totaling $372,697. A 
week later, he added eight more checks that totaled $303,689. On Nov. 1, the 
day after county auditors discovered the secret account, Duffy deposited 17 
more checks that totaled $423,109. The account earned $6,745 in interest. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant County Auditor William J. Kelly said Wednesday it appears that Duffy 
earned 5% to 6% interest on the secret account. The county treasury earns 9%, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said that Duffy violated a county ordinance that requires all 
funds be deposited into the county treasury. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy wrote 15 checks from the secret account, most to the district attorney's 
office and the cities of Vista, Encinitas, Poway, Lemon Grove and San Marcos, 
city governments that contract with the Sheriff's Department and share in the 
drug bust proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
One check, in the amount of $5,400, went to Duffy attorney Martin J. Mayer to 
defend the sheriff against deputies involved in the so-called "Rambo Squad" 
case at the El Cajon jail. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy previously had paid nearly $70,000 to the same law firm, which county 
auditors rejected as an improper expenditure and asked him to repay. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy wrote a check Tuesday in the amount of $1,044,429 -- the entire amount of 
the fund -- which Judge Hollywood had ordered him Friday to deposit in a 
court-controlled trust fund. 
</P>
<P>
At the sheriff's request, Hollywood ordered the county to deposit drug money 
not contained in the secret account into the court's trust fund, where it is to 
be frozen until the matter is resolved. Hollywood said he did so to show both 
parties that he is impartial. 
</P>
<P>
The county turned over $555,000 and was allowed to exclude $1.2 million the 
county already appropriated from the sheriff's budget. 
</P>
<P>
Of the $1.2 million, the appropriations included: $404,300 approved for the 
Chula Vista Jail improvements; $241,675 for a electronic bracelets for 
prisoners who were participating in a home surveillance program; and $50,000 
for a study on whether to establish a regional crime lab. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood has asked retired Superior Court Judge William Yale to mediate the 
dispute among Duffy, the Board of Supervisors, county counsel and sheriff-elect 
Jim Roache. Roache, who is to be sworn in Jan. 7, was in court Wednesday and 
said he was concerned about how the drug funds can be spent in the future. 
</P>
<P>
All parties agreed to a Dec. 20 mediation date, although they will try to meet 
earlier. Hollywood also asked the county counsel to study how other counties 
resolve disputes over drug funds. 
</P>
<P>
Roache said he had not taken a position on whether the sheriff or supervisors 
should have authority over the money until his attorney, Everett Bobbitt, 
studies federal and state laws that govern the use of the money. He said he 
disagreed that Duffy was permitted to use the money for attorney's fees.

A LEAF FROM LOMITA'S BOOK: L.A. MAY BAN NOISY BLOWERS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE L.A. CITY COUNCIL IS STUDYING A REGULATION THAT WOULD 
EFFECTIVELY BAN USE OF GAS-POWERED LEAF BLOWERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four years ago, Lomita became the first city in the South Bay to ban leaf 
blowers because of complaints from residents about dust and the high-pitched 
snarl of the machines. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes Estates and Hermosa Beach soon followed with prohibitions of their 
own, and other South Bay cities imposed a host of restrictions on the blowers' 
use. In Rancho Palos Verdes, for instance, it became illegal to operate the 
machines on Sunday or during the evening. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners in Los Angeles also demanded regulations, but failed when the 
gardening industry fought back and blocked a proposed ban on gasoline-powered 
blowers in residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
Now, thanks to Councilman Marvin Braude, opponents of blowers in Los Angeles 
are getting a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
Braude has introduced a motion to the City Council that industry officials say 
would effectively ban gas-powered leaf blowers in the city. The measure, which 
was referred to the council's environmental quality committee last week, would 
reduce the maximum noise permitted by the blowers from 65 decibels to 60 
decibels. (A busy street may generate 70 to 80 decibels of noise.) 
</P>
<P>
"The continual use of gasoline-powered leaf blowers is a nuisance in our city 
and a terrible imposition on the peace and quiet its residents want to enjoy," 
Braude said in announcing his proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The measure is intended to force gardeners to return to traditional rakes and 
push brooms or convert to electric blowers, which city officials said are far 
less noisy than their gas-powered counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
Most gas-powered leaf blowers generate more than 60 decibels and would not be 
able to comply with Braude's proposed ordinance, according to the Police 
Department, which enforces city noise ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
"There is something about the noise level of the gasoline-powered leaf blower 
that gets to everyone and drives them mad," said Joan Graves, who co-chairs a 
group of Pacific Palisades residents advocating a ban on the machines. "I don't 
know what it is. I would like a scientist to explain it to me. Lawn mowers 
don't do it; even tree trimmers don't do it. It is the leaf blower that just 
drives you out of your mind. It is just torturous." 
</P>
<P>
In the canyons of Pacific Palisades, residents have taken to stuffing towels on 
windowsills and doorjambs to keep dust from gasoline-powered leaf blowers from 
invading their homes. 
</P>
<P>
In Hancock Park, a homeowners group is organizing a telephone complaint line to 
keep track of dozens of gripes from members about the blowers' noise. 
</P>
<P>
And at Los Angeles City Hall, the blowers continue to rank as a major source of 
irritation among many constituents, who write letters and make phone calls 
complaining to council members. 
</P>
<P>
"I have had six calls today from people who don't even live in our district," 
said Glenn Barr, an aide to Braude. "From the perspective of complaints we get, 
it is reaching critical mass. People are at the point where they don't want to 
deal with this anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Braude's proposal has raised the ire of Southern California's gardening 
profession, which has seen a growing number of cities impose restrictions on 
the machines in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks ago, Claremont approved a ban on gas-powered blowers, beginning 
in February, and last month Irvine officials began licensing the machines and 
requiring safety classes for their operators. Other cities across the region, 
from Beverly Hills to Cypress, have either banned the blowers or restricted 
their use. 
</P>
<P>
"That equipment is the livelihood of the gardeners," said Bill Kondo, executive 
secretary of the Southern California Gardeners Federation, which represents 
about 3,500 professional gardeners. "Yes, we are going to oppose it. We are 
meeting Saturday to discuss it." 
</P>
<P>
The federation, joined by other industry groups, killed a similar effort to ban 
the blowers in Los Angeles four years ago. At that time, dozens of homeowner 
groups opposed to the blowers were unable to overcome gardeners' and 
manufacturers' objections that the measure would have a devastating economic 
impact on the city's largely minority gardening industry. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky sponsored legislation that would have 
prohibited gasoline-powered blowers in residential areas, but he was unable to 
garner enough votes for it on the City Council. Councilman Gilbert Lindsay, who 
helped defeat the Yaroslavsky motion, said the debate was about nothing more 
than affluent homeowners not wanting to be disturbed by "good, honest" 
gardeners trying to earn a living. 
</P>
<P>
Kondo said gardeners need the blowers because they are faster and more 
efficient than push brooms, and he said it is often too difficult to find a 
power source for electric models. "What do you do if nobody is home and there 
is no outside outlet?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kondo said his group intends to fight Braude's proposal, the ultimate 
fate of the blowers may actually be taken out of the city's hands. The South 
Coast Air Quality Management District is expected to recommend next month that 
a ban on all leaf blowers -- gasoline and electric -- be included in the 
agency's 1991 clean air plan. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD spokesman Tom Eichhorn said the blowers pollute the air by stirring up 
dust and dirt. The gasoline-powered blowers, moreover, produce exhaust 
emissions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Barr, Braude's aide, said the councilman was aware of the AQMD proposal but 
decided to move forward with a city ban anyway. He said there is no guarantee 
that the AQMD recommendation ultimately will be included in the clean air plan, 
and he said it could be years before such a restriction would take effect. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of our constituents aren't willing to wait," Barr said. "The noise is 
driving them up the wall."

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PORT OF HUENEME; 
</P>
<P>
DEL MONTE TO IMPORT 50% MORE BANANAS

<P>
Del Monte Tropical Fruit Co. will import 50% more bananas through the Port of 
Hueneme each year beginning in January, company spokesmen have told Oxnard 
Harbor District commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
The company's weekly load will jump from 100,000 to 150,000 tons a year, 
including fruit shipped for Turbana Corp. 
</P>
<P>
After the Ecuadorean fruit reaches Ventura County's deep-sea port, it is 
distributed across the West Coast and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Turbana formerly shipped its bananas into the Port of Los Angeles on vessels 
owned by United Fruit Co., growers of Chiquita-brand bananas. The ports of Los 
Angeles, Long Beach and Hueneme are the only West Coast ports that handle 
bananas. 
</P>

At their Tuesday meeting, Oxnard Harbor District commissioners called the 
contract a tremendous boon to the port's economic viability. Del Monte 
officials expect to pay the port about $100,000 more per year.

Port customers are charged fees based on the length of ships, length of stay

Turbana once shipped bananas into Ventura County on its own vessels, but as the

ships.

"It's 50% more bananas with minimum impact on the port," said William Buenger, 
the port's deputy executive director. "The ships are already here. It compacts 
it." DONNA DOWLING

Banana cargo -- An article in Wednesday's edition was unclear in stating the

Port of Hueneme. The company has been shipping 100,000 tons of bananas a year 
into the port. During 1991, the company says it will increase that figure to 
150,000 tons.

TORRANCE TO PAY $1.9 MILLION TO SHOOTING VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Torrance has agreed to pay more than $1.9 million in damages to 
settle a civil lawsuit brought by construction worker Patrick J. Coyle, who was 
shot in the neck by a Torrance police officer during a May, 1988, traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for the city to pay Coyle and his wife $750,000 within the 
next year, with the remainder of the money to be paid quarterly over 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The city's goal was to avoid going to trial," City Atty. Kenneth Nelson said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Coyles' attorney, Brian J. Panish, said: "The settlement is a compromise for 
both sides." 
</P>
<P>
The personal injury damages are to compensate Coyle for medical bills, lost 
income, pain and suffering and attorneys' fees, Panish said. 
</P>
<P>
Coyle, 33, a former Torrance construction worker, suffers long-term medical 
problems from the shooting, Panish said. The police bullet remains lodged in 
his neck near his spinal cord, and he experiences difficulty walking. He also 
has experienced blurred vision and difficulties walking, Panish said. 
</P>
<P>
Coyle is currently in County Jail, completing a sentence of up to one year 
after pleading guilty to possession of a controlled substance from a separate 
incident, Panish said, adding that Coyle is due to be released in about two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Coyle will not be able to return to construction work after he leaves jail, but 
he hopes to find a job that is more sedentary, Panish said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit arose from a shooting that occurred May 9, 1988, at Western Avenue 
and 227th Street in Torrance. Coyle was shot after the Torrance police stopped 
him for questioning while he rode his motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
The three officers involved in the incident -- Timothy Thornton, Timothy Pappas 
and Mark Holden -- initially told investigators that the shooting occurred as 
Coyle made a sudden motion toward a wrench tucked into his waistband. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators closed the case, but reopened it when Thornton told superiors 
that Pappas fired the shot at Coyle accidentally, several moments after Coyle 
put the wrench on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
All three officers were dismissed from the force. 
</P>
<P>
Holden pleaded no contest last June to a single misdemeanor count of filing a 
false police report. He was sentenced to one year of unsupervised probation and 
a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Pappas pleaded no contest last year to a misdemeanor count of filing a false 
report and was ordered to pay a fine and serve a year on summary probation. 
</P>
<P>
Thornton was granted immunity in return for testifying against the two other 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick and Nancy Coyle filed a civil lawsuit against the city in September, 
1988. The city later acknowledged liability, and, in exchange, Coyle agreed to 
drop his efforts to obtain punitive damages from the police officers and 
Torrance Police Chief Donald Nash, Panish said. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement ending the lawsuit calls for the city to pay Coyle a total of 
$1,935,859. It actually will cost the city about $1.4 million, because the 
payments will be made over 15 years, and money set aside to pay the Coyles will 
generate interest, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
The money will come from the city's self-insurance fund, which totaled 
$10,476,000 as of June, said Ken Flewellyn, assistant finance director. The 
fund includes money for workers' compensation and general liability cases. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said the Coyle agreement marks the last of a rash of major cases against 
the city involving police activities. 
</P>
<P>
In the most widely publicized of those cases, the family of Kelly Rastello, 19, 
of San Pedro, last year won a $6-million civil judgment against the Torrance 
police. Rastello was killed in a collision with a vehicle driven by off-duty 
Torrance Police Sgt. Rollo Green. 
</P>
<P>
Panish, the Coyles' attorney, also represented the Rastello family.

GANG VIOLENCE CLAIMS A MODEL SON, STUDENT; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: 16-YEAR-OLD ROBERT DELGADO OF GARDENA WASN'T KILLED OVER DRUGS OR MONEY, 
DETECTIVES SAY. INSTEAD, HE FELL PREY TO ETHNIC RIVALRY BETWEEN TWO GROUPS OF 
IMMIGRANTS. 
</P>

<P>
Each morning before Robert Delgado left for school, he made his bed and kissed 
his parents goodby. He kept his room immaculate, and when he came home, he 
cleaned the kitchen and bathroom before setting rice on the stove for the 
family's dinner. 
</P>
<P>
A junior at Leuzinger High School before he was killed in a drive-by shooting 
last week, Robert sang baritone in the school's award-winning Select Chorale. 
He had decent grades and teachers spoke well of him. 
</P>
<P>
He regularly attended church, and, knowing his parents couldn't afford to send 
him to college, he planned to join the Air Force to earn tuition. By all 
accounts he was extremely close to his parents, who came to Gardena from the 
Philippines in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
But his friends at school knew something that Romeo and Cleofe Delgado did not: 
Robert had recently joined a gang. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, Robert's murder was like hundreds of gang-related shootings that 
have claimed the lives of more than 550 people in Los Angeles County this year. 
But police say the tensions that erupted into gunfire Nov. 5 differ from those 
that plague traditional Los Angeles gangs who fight over drugs, money and turf. 
</P>
<P>
The gang rivalry that cost Robert his life "is not over drugs, and it's not 
over money," said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Detective Ed Milkey. "It's based 
on nationalities more than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after he came to the United States and began his freshman year at 
Leuzinger, Robert met members of a relatively new Filipino gang called 
Hellside. While he had other friends and interests, say family and 
acquaintances, language and culture helped forge an irresistible bond between 
him and the gang members. At school, they often could be heard talking in 
Tagalog, their native language, and sometimes they lifted weights together at 
the gym. 
</P>
<P>
For two years he resisted joining the gang, friends said. But four weeks ago, 
Robert agreed to be "jumped" into the gang, accepting a ritual beating that 
marked his affiliation. As part of the ritual, he received the gang name 
"Angel" and a cigarette burn on his left wrist, a fellow gang member said. 
</P>
<P>
Although police and Robert's parents say they are puzzled by his decision, some 
of Robert's friends and acquaintances say they saw it coming. 
</P>
<P>
"The people he was hanging out with, they were all in the gang," said Leuzinger 
senior Roy Zirpoli, who sang with Robert in the Select Chorale. Joining the 
gang "wasn't something he did because he wanted to be in the gang," Zirpoli 
said. "He did it because his friends were in. There was a lot of pressure on 
him to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Police and gang specialists describe the gang as composed largely of students, 
many from Leuzinger in the Centinela Valley Union High School District. While 
members are known for having fist fights with rivals and occasionally spraying 
graffiti on walls around the South Bay, they "are not out there running the 
streets, jumping on people and doing dope deals," Milkey said. 
</P>
<P>
However, their main rival, a Vietnamese gang whose members are drawn from as 
far away as Orange County and the San Gabriel Valley, is not as reticent about 
violence, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Animosity between the gangs led to a series of pay-back beatings in recent 
weeks. Then, on Nov. 5, the Vietnamese gang decided to settle the score with 
guns. "No one expected this," Milkey said. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after classes were dismissed, a car stopped in front of a house on 147th 
Street where Robert was standing with a group of gang friends. Riding in the 
car was a Vietnamese gang member who had been beaten by Filipino gang members 
earlier in the day on the Leuzinger campus, police said. He pointed, and shots 
were fired. 
</P>
<P>
A bullet struck Robert in the head. He died on the sidewalk, clutching his 
school books. 
</P>
<P>
Police Tuesday arrested three men and one juvenile on suspicion of the murder, 
but refused to release their names, saying they are seeking other suspects in 
the killing. Milkey said Robert probably was not their target. 
</P>
<P>
For Romeo Delgado, a former Filipino police officer who came here in 1985 in 
search of a better life for his family, Robert's death left questions. 
</P>
<P>
After taking two years to establish himself in Gardena, Romeo, now a medical 
lab assistant, was joined by Cleofe and Robert in 1987. The Delgados, who left 
three younger children behind in their hometown of Bacolod, were planning to 
reunite the family once they could pay for a large enough apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting on their son's bed Tuesday, the Delgados said they probably will let 
their children finish high school in the Philippines before sending for them. 
</P>
<P>
After showing off Robert's room, his papers, his wallet with their picture in 
it and a computer that only Robert knew how to use, Romeo said of the gang: "If 
I knew about that group, I would stop him. But I never heard Robert made 
trouble. For us, he was a good one." 
</P>
<P>
At Robert's funeral at St. Jerome Catholic Church on Monday morning, the 
disparate elements of Robert's short life came together. 
</P>
<P>
While members of the Select Chorale sang "One Moment in Time," about 15 of 
Robert's homeboys sat apart in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Chorale instructor James Johnston remembered him as "a good person, who was 
always warm and friendly" and who often started rehearsals with an impromptu 
solo followed by a self-mocking "oops." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to remarks by the priest earlier that Robert was now singing in a 
celestial choir, Johnston said: "I envy that choir because (it) surely has an 
excellent baritone now." 
</P>
<P>
But at the Delgados' request, the priest also spoke candidly about Robert's 
gang affiliation, urging his friends to do their part to stop the cycle of 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
"There's so much peer pressure out there to get involved," noted Father Gerard 
G. King. "The gangs here in Los Angeles are a terrible thing, and we should all 
try to do our best to work against that mentality . . . and give encouragement 
to those who don't want to be involved." 
</P>
<P>
Romeo Delgado said he worries that the pay-backs will continue. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want revenge," he said. "My son already is dead -- it hurts so I 
cannot take it. But I don't want the story to repeat. All I'm asking for now is 
justice."

<P>
An exclusive Ojai country club will be the site this weekend of an 
international conference that is expected to draw three former leaders of the 
United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, former Japanese Prime Minister 
Yasuhiro Nakasone, and 30 other political and business leaders are scheduled to 
participate in the closed-door inaugural meeting of the U.S.-Japan Leadership 
Council at the Ojai Valley Inn and Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S.-Japanese relationship is of utmost importance and, though it has been 
good over the years, the image is that it has been confrontational," said Jon 
Strom, the council's program coordinator. "What we're trying to do is create a 
new level to the relationship and overcome the regular day-to-day type of 
negotiating." 
</P>
<P>
The council was the brainchild of Robert McFarlane, the national security 
adviser to former President Ronald Reagan who pleaded guilty to four 
misdemeanors stemming from the Iran-Contra scandal. Strom said McFarlane 
continues to command considerable respect in the international community, as 
indicated by the caliber of participants in the first of the council's biannual 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Talks will center primarily on "mutual security" of the two nations, Strom 
said, including discussion of the Middle East crisis, world economic conditions 
and the easing of Cold War tensions. 
</P>
<P>
The 216-room Ojai Valley Inn is located on a 220-acre complex that includes an 
18-hole golf course.CHRISTOPHER PUMMER

U.S. REFUSES TO HELP ENCINITAS FOOT BILL FOR MIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three weeks after Encinitas sent a $281,695.25 bill to the federal government 
seeking repayment for money spent trying to solve its migrant laborer problem, 
the city got its answer: No. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, an attorney for the General Accounting Office in Washington sent a 
letter to Encinitas Mayor Pam Slater explaining that federal laws do not 
provide for such a payment. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, for our office to authorize payment on a claim, it must arise from 
a statute or other source of law mandating compensation by the federal 
government," stated the letter from General Counsel James F. Hinchman. "We are 
aware of no authority to pay the claim you have submitted." 
</P>
<P>
Cleve Corlett, director for public affairs for the General Accounting Office, 
put it more bluntly: "There is no law on the books that says we have to pay 
this bill," he said. "So we won't." 
</P>
<P>
In October, Slater sent a letter to the GAO warning that attempts to deal with 
the thousands of both legal and illegal farm laborers who now make their homes 
in Encinitas had pushed the city to the breaking point. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Encinitas became the first city in California to declare a state of 
local emergency over frustrations with migrant laborers -- a cry for help city 
officials say has gone unheeded from either Washington or Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Councilwoman Marjorie Gaines said she expected such a response 
from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"It comes as no surprise to me," she said. "What it's going to take is a 
class-action lawsuit against the federal government. But we're going to need 
some help in the form of other local cities filing similar claims. Then, maybe 
something can be done." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Rep. Ron Packard, R-Oceanside, said he thinks the class action suits 
against the federal government are a good way to get Washington officials to 
pay their share of the costs of illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
City and counties are going broke trying to keep pace with the waves of 
immigration, Packard said. The suit might force the federal government to 
reimburse local government up to $2,600 per documented and undocumented laborer 
to cover such costs as housing, law enforcement and medical care, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The bill sent by Encinitas included $118,000 for operation of a transients 
program designed to bridge relations between migrants and citizens; $57,000 to 
evacuate an encampment of Guatemalans on city-owned land, as well as $49,000 
for a year-old job center the city has operated to help documented laborers 
find work.

NEW MURAL BRIGHTENS DRAB HARBOR-UCLA PEDIATRIC WAITING AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As usual, the pediatrics waiting room was standing-room only. 
</P>
<P>
Mothers jiggled anxious infants. Toddlers ran across the floor. A baby howled. 
In all, more than 30 adults and children were awaiting medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
It is a scene that repeats itself daily at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center 
pediatrics clinic, where people often wait an hour or more in what had been a 
nondescript room with long, tan-colored walls. But last week, the vista changed 
slightly. 
</P>
<P>
A new mural occupies the wall above the crowded sofa. And some of the 
mural-makers -- members of the Palos Verdes Junior Women's Club -- showed up 
for its dedication last Friday afternoon. The stylishly dressed women listened 
to a few speeches and sipped punch in the waiting room as young mothers and 
children watched, some looking mildly surprised. 
</P>
<P>
The mural, made up of 16 canvas squares, depicts a butterfly's metamorphosis 
amid a field of purple flowers. It was donated to the hospital by the women's 
club and dedicated to the memory of the deceased daughter of a club member. 
</P>
<P>
The outline of the design was first drawn in Georgia by Atlanta-based artist 
John Feight. He shipped the canvas panels to California, where club members 
painted them during a picnic last spring, with help from their families and 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
They added the color according to Feight's instructions, much as if they were 
executing an oversized paint-by-numbers game. 
</P>
<P>
Feight, 50, traveled to the Harbor medical center for Friday's dedication. "We 
are all care-givers in one way or another," he told the assembled club members 
and patients. 
</P>
<P>
Feight is the founder of the Foundation for Hospital Art, which he describes as 
a nonprofit group launched in 1984 to provide art for hospitals and nursing 
homes. So far, the foundation has provided more than 5,000 murals to more than 
250 hospitals in 60 countries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those murals were donated by community clubs and hospital auxiliaries. 
The Palos Verdes club, for instance, painted another Feight mural last year and 
donated it to San Pedro Peninsula Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Feight, who once worked in advertising, said he has made a mission of changing 
and softening the hospital environment. He carries with him a photo album of 
his work, including an elaborate mural of painted archways in a once-bleak 
hallway at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
"Art can become of some value if you put it where people need it the most," he 
said. "What we're talking about here is more than art. It's an attempt to 
comfort and heal." 
</P>
<P>
People who are seriously ill or dying deserve to have beauty around them, he 
added. "We should have the opportunity to die in soft places." 
</P>
<P>
He motioned at the new, purple-flowered mural with its butterfly hanging above 
the roomful of waiting mothers and children. 
</P>
<P>
"I want people to sit here and look up and begin to see a sequence there," 
Feight said. "The butterfly may take them away from their pain a little bit."

COLLEGE STILL SEEKS TO USE KING'S NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Allegations of plagiarism against the late Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. have 
not dampened enthusiasm for renaming UC San Diego's Third College after the 
slain civil rights leader, college officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A Stanford University historian this week said King had plagiarized numerous 
passages in his doctoral dissertation and other academic papers. 
</P>
<P>
Third College "Provost Cecil Lytle remains very supportive of Dr. King's 
achievements and contributions to society as whole" and continues to strongly 
advocate the college's renaming after King, said Mae Brown, the college's 
director of academic advising. 
</P>
<P>
A proposed agreement between the college and the Martin Luther King Jr. Center 
for Non-Violent Social Change in Atlanta nearly is completed, about a year 
after college officials proposed the renaming and several months after the 
college began negotiating for an endorsement from the King Center. 
</P>
<P>
No date has been set for concluding those talks and deliberations are 
continuing, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
King Center officials were not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The King Center is asking the college to issue a statement in support of 
nonviolent social change and establish a scholarship fund or an endowed chair 
in King's name, Brown said.

Coretta Scott King, King's widow, is concerned about the depth of San Diego's 
support for her late husband after proposals to name Market Street and the 
convention center after King failed in recent years, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
College officials expressed confidence that Third College will be able to 
incorporate King's theories of nonviolent social change into its framework, but 
said raising funds for scholarships or an endowed chair will offer a more 
difficult challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Third College, established in 1970, was the third undergraduate college created 
at UCSD. The issue of renaming it arose several times until 1985, when the UC 
Board of Regents made the Third College name official. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, however, Lytle, who was named provost a year earlier, rejuvenated the 
issue and supported using King's name. 
</P>
<P>
The civil rights leader's name received the most votes last year from a review 
process involving students, faculty and administrators, and a university 
committee approved the proposal, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The measure's outcome depends on the college satisfying the King Center's 
requirements and the final approval by UCSD Chancellor Richard Atkinson and the 
UC regents.

CREATIONISTS EVOLVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is difficult to believe that Phillip E. Johnson ("Unbelievers Unwelcome in 
the Science Lab" Opinion, Nov. 3) is a law professor, in view of some of his 
assertions, e.g., "Nobody doubts . . . ," "Most Americans are . . . " and "Most 
people believe . . . " 
</P>
<P>
How did he arrive at those conclusions? 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, it is interesting to note the evolution of Creationists in this country 
as depicted by Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
As science has somehow managed to educate some Creationists, they have been 
compelled to progress from embracing the six-day construction project dogma to 
acknowledging that maybe it took a bit longer. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether God has worked a substantial amount of undisclosed 
overtime or fashioned a program that executed the plan over the course of 
millennia. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the case, the closest Creationists come to accepting evolution, 
apparently, is to claim that God created that too, maybe on the seventh day.

TEACHERS RESPOND ON TORRANCE TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teachers believe the article "Torrance Teachers, Parents at Odds Over Returning 
Tests to Students," which ran on the South Bay pages on Nov. 4, did not 
adequately present our position. 
</P>
<P>
Returning tests to students is not the issue. Of course we return tests and go 
over them thoroughly with our students. It is an essential part of the learning 
process. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is whether there should be a requirement that all tests leave the 
classroom with the students. 
</P>
<P>
What would be gained? A few of the tests might make it home to the parents for 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
What would be lost? The students' chance to test themselves against materials 
developed by textbook publishers for use nationwide. If the tests left the 
classroom, it would breach security commitments made by users of the tests to 
these publishers. 
</P>
<P>
Cheating is a serious problem. We would not want to inadvertently reward those 
who have access to previously administered tests, rather than an understanding 
of the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Countless hours of teacher time would be lost. We attempt to devise tests that 
challenge students with higher levels of critical thinking and analysis -- not 
just rote learning. 
</P>
<P>
These tests are extremely difficult to devise -- impossible, in fact, if we 
have to start from scratch every time. Questions often need several revisions 
to most effectively measure understanding of the texts and other classroom 
content. If we could afford to change texts more often, perhaps this would be a 
less serious problem. 
</P>
<P>
But the most damaging -- absolutely crucial -- aspect of this lost time would 
be the cost to other essential parts of the teacher's job, including classroom 
preparation and responding to students' writing. 
</P>
<P>
Parents should be involved in their children's education. We have encouraged 
parental help in our summer reading program and in a tutorial center we are 
establishing. 
</P>
<P>
There are many other ways parents have supported and can support the schools, 
but analyzing responses to a test without knowing the instructional context 
could only be useful if it is in conference with the teacher involved. 
</P>
<P>
We are deeply concerned about how to help our students and use a broad range of 
assessment techniques. Tests play only a part in this process and should not 
become the focus rather than the learning itself. 
</P>
<P>
For those parents who are sincerely concerned about going over a test with a 
teacher and find it impossible to meet during the day, we've found that a phone 
conversation can clear up most questions. 
</P>
<P>
We as teachers have been creating quality education in Torrance for a number of 
years and welcome all who share our commitment. However, we believe this 
requirement would be both divisive and counterproductive.

GRADE-SCHOOLERS GET A HIP EDUCATION IN OPERA; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ARE SINGING THE PRAISES OF THE L.A. MUSIC 
CENTER OPERA'S 'A MUSKRAT LULLABY' PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Opera, generally thought of as the entertainment of the evening gown and tuxedo 
set, is coming to the Bart Simpson and L.A. Gear set. 
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of professionals from the Los Angeles Music Center Opera, 
grade-school students throughout the county are learning to slither like 
alligators, play the drums on trash-can contraptions and sing heartily in the 
chorus of a children's opera. 
</P>
<P>
After five weeks of training, they will unveil the opera, "A Muskrat Lullaby," 
on their school stage, sharing the spotlight with professional singers. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent dress rehearsal at Grand View Boulevard School in Mar Vista, the 
children, who play alligators and muskrats, went through the score and blocking 
-- their movements on stage -- in preparation for that afternoon's performance. 
Location director Paul King ordered the gators to stay low to the ground and 
act less polite and more "snarly." 
</P>
<P>
The opera involves about 120 youngsters in the fourth through sixth grades. 
Several of the children had seen Mozart's "The Magic Flute" or Oliver Knussen 
and Maurice Sendak's "Where the Wild Things Are" on field trips last year. 
</P>
<P>
But before the "Muskrat Lullaby" project, most had no idea what opera was. And 
if they did have an opinion about opera, teacher Brenda Richards said, it was 
that it was weird or boring. 
</P>
<P>
" 'You hear all these notes, and you don't know what they're saying,' " 
Richards recalled her fourth-graders saying. 
</P>
<P>
"Even for adults," added director King, the stereotype is that opera is "a 
bunch of fat ladies on stage singing." The opera company's school program, he 
said, aims to leave children with "their first memory of opera (as) something 
they participated in." 
</P>
<P>
With the L.A. Music Center Opera team, a school production is not a casual 
undertaking. They conduct workshops in which the children sing musical scales, 
learn creative dramatics and acquire a basic music vocabulary. Such people as 
Llewellyn Crain, manager of the opera's education and community programs, and 
opera docents explain opera and teach lines and cues. Composer and librettist 
Edward Barnes and percussionist John Fitzgerald lead rehearsals and talk about 
their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty hard to learn how to breathe in the first lesson," said muskrat 
Hailey Singh -- that is, inhale through the nose, exhale from the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
She and other students said they had been teased by some classmates about being 
in the opera and wearing handmade animal masks. "They think it's for wimps, 
they think it's dumb, because you're singing," Hailey said. 
</P>
<P>
But opera has caught on, teachers said. At recess, "(students will) sing, 'Will 
you throw the ball to me?' " Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of the children play in a percussion band on instruments they built 
themselves under Fitzgerald's guidance. Among the instruments are a drum made 
of three aluminum cans hanging inside a box, a "zipper guitar" made of a dowel 
and a metal spring strung between a garbage can and a coffee can, and glass 
canning jars filled with water and played with pencils with new erasers. 
</P>
<P>
They are "junk instruments -- easily made, easily repaired," Fitzgerald said. 
They were all built in less than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Playing them, however, took some practice, the youngsters said. "You have to 
keep track, look at the teacher, (and know) your instrument," said aluminum can 
drummer Jason Clouse, 9. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the unusual instruments, "Muskrat Lullaby" has elements of 
Charleston, salsa, rock 'n' roll and rap. "The style is . . . accessible and 
entertaining," said Crain, "more like Sondheim than like Puccini." 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted kids to feel it was real hip, real cool," she said. 
</P>
<P>
No matter that the children don't exactly achieve bel canto. "We don't care how 
good they sound," Crain said. "Most important to us is that they understand 
this process" of creating an opera and they are coaxed "out of their shells or 
their everyday world." 
</P>
<P>
So it helps that "Muskrat Lullaby," which is based on the book "Mama Don't 
Allow" by Thacher Hurd, is set in a swamp. The plot is simple: A singing group 
consisting of Miles the Muskrat and three other animals (played by members of 
L.A. Opera's resident company) goes to the swamp to practice. They are nearly 
eaten by a gang of alligators, but they sing themselves to safety by crooning a 
lullaby and putting the 'gators to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
There's a moral, of course: "The singing group uses music and cooperation to 
get themselves out of this predicament," Crain said. 
</P>
<P>
The student performers say they've been learning that along the way. 
Fourth-grader and alligator Claudia Marroquin said she liked working with her 
classmates, but she added that it's difficult at times because "some people 
don't listen, and they screw it up." 
</P>
<P>
The "Muskrat Lullaby" program, started in March, is the brainchild of general 
director Peter Hemmings, who ran a similar project when he led Scottish Opera. 
The program is financed by government agencies and private foundations and 
costs about $2,300 per school, with the school chipping in $800. By the end of 
this month, "Muskrat Lullaby" will have traveled to 29 schools in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The opera company is so pleased with the way the program has gone that it is 
developing a similar program for junior high and high schools, Crain said. 
</P>
<P>
On performance day at Grand View, 11 people from the opera company took part, 
including the singers and technical crew. They brought costumes, a few props, 
conga drums, slide whistles and other instruments. The big star, from the 
children's standpoint, was bass-baritone Richard Bernstein, who played the role 
of the alligator boss, dressed in top hat, black coattails with green jewels 
and metallic green pants. 
</P>
<P>
The student alligators and muskrats seemed dazzled by the show even as they 
were in it. Accompanying composer Barnes on keyboards and Fitzgerald on drums, 
the sounds of the children's percussion band -- the boing of the spring, thunk 
of the garbage can, ticktock of the aluminum cans and plock of the canning jar 
tops -- were amazingly melodic. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes said he was delighted at the way the youngsters shed their shyness as 
the 20-minute performance progressed. "They learn the value of being a ham on 
stage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The audience of about 200 students first whooped and giggled but were soon 
entranced. The alligators popped up out of character occasionally and the band 
missed a few beats, but they were given a chorus of bravos. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fun," said a breathless Laura Farahat, 9, who dressed for her part in 
apple-green turtleneck and stretch pants. 
</P>
<P>
The performance is over now, but it's not the finale of "Lullaby" yet. Waiting 
back in the classroom, said Richards and other teachers, are science 
experiments on the sounds of liquid-filled jars, assignments to write reports 
on muskrats and other animals -- and tapes of Puccini.

MOORPARK'S CRAWFORD SIGNS LETTER OF INTENT; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: RAIDER POINT GUARD WILL PLAY NEXT SEASON FOR NEW MEXICO 
STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A long-running, long-distance courtship came to fruition Wednesday when Sam 
Crawford, Moorpark College's sophomore point guard, signed a letter of intent 
to play basketball for New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford said New Mexico State recruited him when he was at Westchester High 
but that he had failed to meet NCAA Proposition 48 eligibility requirements. 
Crawford said it was then that New Mexico State steered him in Moorpark's 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
He visited the Las Cruces campus the weekend of Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them before I came, if I liked it, I was going to sign," said Crawford, 
who gave an oral commitment two days after his visit. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford (5-foot-7, 150 pounds) averaged 20.7 points a game, led state players 
with 12.1 assists a game and set five school records. Crawford said he will not 
redshirt and boldly stated that he expects to replace the incumbent point 
guard, senior Randy Brown, a first-team All-Big West Conference selection last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark held a press conference Wednesday to announce the signing and Crawford 
ran the press conference in much the same way he directs the Moorpark offense, 
unpredictably and with flair. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to start," Crawford said. "If nothing else, I can bring a little bit 
of excitement. If not that, controversy. I've been good for that." 
</P>
<P>
Crawford, who led Moorpark to the final eight of the state tournament, took 
only one other official visit, to Sacramento State. He said he might have had 
more offers had he waited until the spring signing period but likely would not 
have changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State finished 26-5 and tied eventual national champion UNLV for the 
Big West championship last season before being knocked out in the first round 
of the NCAA tournament by Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
The New Mexico State coaching staff is unable to comment on Crawford until it 
receives the signed letter of intent by return mail.

NORTHRIDGE STAYS HOME IN STOCKING ITS PROGRAM; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE RECRUITING: EARLY SIGNING PERIOD BEGINS WITH COMMITMENTS FROM 
CHATSWORTH VOLLEYBALL PLAYER AND SIMI VALLEY THIRD BASEMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Placing a bit of the future in the hands of athletes with more potential than 
renown, the Northridge athletic program welcomed two more recruits into the 
fold on the first day of the NCAA early signing period. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Urcan, a third-team All-City Section volleyball player for Chatsworth High 
last season, and Tyler Nelson, an unheralded baseball player at Simi Valley 
High, both accepted scholarship offers Wednesday, the first day high school 
seniors can sign a letter of intent. 
</P>
<P>
Urcan is a 6-foot-5, 200-pound middle blocker, and Nelson is a 6-2, 185-pound 
third baseman. Urcan's specialty is blocking, Nelson's is hitting. But two 
common threads led them to Northridge -- a chance to attend a school close to 
home and a belief in the coach who recruited them. 
</P>
<P>
"I've talked to a lot of coaches, but I like the way (CSUN Coach) John Price 
runs his program. I just like the way he is," Urcan said. "That and it's a lot 
better when you have your friends there watching you play. It's an added 
confidence boost." 
</P>
<P>
Urcan helped Chatsworth reach the City 4-A final last season but it was his 
play for a local club team last summer that caught Price's attention. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a good athlete who moves well. He has all the qualities of a big-time 
player," Price said. "He's a great catch for us." 
</P>
<P>
And yet another local one. Of the 16 players on the CSUN practice roster, 12 
are from area schools -- including all six probable starters. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal all along was to get the top local guys and I think Gene should be 
one of the best players out there this year," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, a right-handed hitter who batted .343 for Simi Valley last season, is 
projected as a power hitter by CSUN Coach Bill Kernen. 
</P>
<P>
"He can hit and I think he's going to develop some power for us," Kernen said. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson will play third base for Simi Valley this spring, but he can also catch 
and play first base. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson joins pitcher-first baseman Scott Sharts and utility player Andy Hodgins 
as Simi Valley High products on the Matador roster.

HARVARD WATER POLO TEAM BLOWS CHANCES AND MATCH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Having a man advantage proved to be no advantage for the Harvard High water 
polo team Wednesday in its Southern Section 3-A Division quarterfinal match 
against La Serna. 
</P>
<P>
Seven times La Serna was called for a penalty that left Harvard with a 
six-on-five manpower edge, and seven times the host Saracens failed to 
capitalize. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, Harvard lost by seven goals, 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Pyle scored three goals for La Serna, despite suffering a cut in the 
corner of his right eye in the first quarter. His final goal broke a 5-5 
third-quarter tie and gave third-seeded La Serna (21-4) a lead it never 
relinquished. 
</P>
<P>
Pyle was taken to a hospital for stitches after the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid is tough," said Harvard Coach Rich Corso, whose sixth-seeded Saracens 
(22-7) struggled against a tough man-to-man defense. "He needs stitches in his 
eye and tells his coaches, 'Don't take me out.' I respect his attitude. He was 
the key." 
</P>
<P>
Corso also pointed to his team's inability to score with an extra player as 
another factor. 
</P>
<P>
"We were tentative with the ball at six-on-five," Corso said. "You can't be 
like that in championship play." 
</P>
<P>
Said senior captain Brian Border: "Our six-on-five looked good in practice. If 
we made a few of those, we would have done better." 
</P>
<P>
Even with their problems with the extra man, the Saracens battled the Lancers 
to a 4-4 halftime tie. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard started the third period as the more aggressive team. Ryan Salceda put 
in his own rebound to give Harvard a 5-4 lead. Shortly after that, three 
Harvard players broke free toward the La Serna net, but an official stopped the 
breakaway by calling a foul against La Serna. 
</P>
<P>
La Serna shut down Harvard, then Ryan Loeff tied the score, 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
"The momentum shifted after the call," La Serna Coach Tom Losonsky said. "When 
we tied it, the momentum shifted all the way back to us." 
</P>
<P>
La Serna scored the next five goals to clinch the match. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Serge scored five goals, four in the final period, for La Serna. Jim 
Toring scored four goals for Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
In another Southern Section 3-A quarterfinal water polo match: 
</P>
<P>
Riverside Poly 8, Agoura 6 -- Kevin Driscoll and Terry Polapink each scored two 
goals for ninth-seeded Agoura (18-6) in Riverside.

SYLMAR BEATS BIRMINGHAM TO REACH VOLLEYBALL FINAL

Michelle Solano believed that Sylmar High had something to prove in the 
Spartans' 15-6, 15-13, 4-15, 17-15 victory over Birmingham in the City Section 
3-A Division volleyball semifinals Wednesday night at Hamilton High. 
</P>
<P>
Solano made her point in the decisive fourth game to guide Sylmar to the 3-A 
title game against Marshall on Saturday night at Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall defeated Van Nuys, 15-13, 15-8, 15-7, in the earlier semifinal at 
Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
Solano, a 5-foot-6 middle blocker participating in her first year of 
volleyball, recorded 11 of her match-high 18 kills and two service aces as 
Sylmar held off a furious Birmingham rally. 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar had defeated Birmingham, the 3-A runner-up last season, in five games 
early in the season to win the Valley Pac-8 Conference title. "The last time we 
played them, we were nervous," said Solano, who also had 20 digs and four aces. 
"This time we felt we were equal. We definitely wanted to show them that we 
were for real." 
</P>
<P>
Griselda Vasquez had 16 kills and six blocks and setter Andrea Cervantes added 
36 assists for Sylmar (15-1), which had only three players back from last 
year's team that lost in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Seemingly beaten, Birmingham (13-3) rallied from a 13-5 deficit and three match 
points in the fourth game to take a 15-14 lead before falling. 
</P>
<P>
Tina Larson paced Birmingham with 13 kills and seven blocks and Merideth Lewis 
had eight kills. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 6-4, in the third game, the Braves scored nine points in a row, 
winning on a Larson spike deep into the back row to force the fourth game. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys (12-2) got the long and short end against Marshall (11-5) in the other 
semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall's Kathy Ham, a 5-foot-2 setter, and Cherri Halliburton, a 6-foot-1 
middle blocker, stymied Van Nuys with 10 kills and nine blocks, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys raced to a 5-0 advantage in the first game and extended its lead to 
8-3 before Marshall rallied to go ahead, 11-10. 
</P>
<P>
"The first game was the one that broke our backs," Van Nuys Coach Dave Bessler 
said. "We would have to play our best and they would have to play their worst 
for us to win. They just didn't make any mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Joanne Harry and Thuy-Van Le led Van Nuys with 14 and 13 kills, respectively.

PACBELL TO PUT PHONE BILLS ON PC DISKETTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Corporate telephone customers, some who struggle with monthly phone bills that 
typically run 600 to 1,200 pages, may get some relief next month from Pacific 
Bell. 
</P>
<P>
The phone company plans to start offering a billing system that will allow 
companies to receive listings of their monthly charges on personal computer 
diskettes. The bills, which come complete with special software, can simply be 
inserted into personal computers, which then sort, group and analyze the 
charges according to the customer's needs. 
</P>
<P>
The target audience for the service, which will work with IBM personal 
computers and compatible models, are large companies making 300,000 or more 
toll calls per month and attorney's offices, ad agencies and other professional 
firms that apportion telephone charges on a case or project basis. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been asking for this for four years," said Paul Chapman, manager of 
telecommunications at Trans World Airlines' Western regional headquarters at 
Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman said that the airlines' 1,500-worker complex at LAX is served by more 
than 300 telephone lines and that the phone bill that he has been sorting and 
analyzing by hand for years runs about 600 pages per month. "Now, I can do this 
all on my PC spreadsheet program and be done with it in a fraction of the 
time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell's computerized bill, which will cost $15 per month plus a $100 
one-time charge, is the latest in a handful of similar products that phone 
companies across the nation have recently begun to offer their business 
customers, many of whom are reeling from the costs and chaos generated by the 
deluge of new telecommunications services, including computer networks and fax 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
"As telecommunications, computer networks and the like become more important to 
businesses, executives increasingly need to understand how these services are 
being used in their businesses -- by whom, for how long and between what 
locations," said Stephen Sazagari, a telecommunications analyst at Dataquest, a 
San Jose market research firm. The information, he said, can help businesses 
select not only the proper phone services to install but the most cost 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
Phone companies say their new computerized bills satisfy this "need to know" 
and give them a competitive advantage serving large business customers, 
traditionally the most valued by utilities because of their volume usage and 
lower per-capita maintenance requirements. 
</P>
<P>
A Pacific Bell spokesman admitted the company's primary motivation in offering 
the new service -- after studying its potential for nearly four years -- is its 
concern that its monopoly market will be opened up to competitors in coming 
years, competitors who could lure away valued corporate business. 
</P>
<P>
"We have customers who swear they would leave us is we ever pulled Fonview," 
said Robin Lloyd, the manager of U.S. Sprint's computerized billing system. 
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts remain largely unconvinced that the bill-on-a-diskette 
represents much of an improvement over paper bills, especially when compared to 
what businesses could have. 
</P>
<P>
The real breakthrough service that big businesses need, said Douglas Gold, 
director of communications research at International Data Corp. in Framingham, 
Mass., is on-line, instantaneous monitoring of telephone usage. 
</P>
<P>
Allowing businesses to tap into phone companies' computers to retrieve daily, 
or even hourly, phone usage summaries, he argues, could provide vast quantities 
of information so quickly that businesses could adjust their strategies and 
marketing programs. 
</P>
<P>
"These boutique billing options they have now are fine, but we're going to have 
to wait for a few more years for the more valuable billing services, such as 
instantaneous, minute-by-minute accounting of network usage," Gold says.

RETAIL SALES BARELY RISE, POINTING TO GLOOMY CHRISTMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
Retail sales managed an anemic 0.1% gain in October, the Commerce Department 
reported Wednesday, and betting is heavy that the all-important Christmas 
shopping season will be a washout. 
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't much Christmas cheer in those numbers," said Allen Sinai, chief 
economist with Boston Co., a New York-based investment firm. "It shows that 
consumers are hunkering down." 
</P>
<P>
Fueled by higher gasoline prices, retail sales totaled $152.3 billion in 
October, compared to $152.1 billion in September, the Commerce Department said. 
If cars, trucks and automobiles are not counted, retail sales were unchanged in 
October. If gasoline sales are removed, retail sales actually dropped 0.1%. 
</P>
<P>
When adjusted for inflation, Sinai said, retail sales for the month were down 
0.5%. 
</P>
<P>
In September, retail sales increased 1.3%. October sales were 4.9% higher than 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, automobile manufacturers said Wednesday that U.S. vehicle sales 
rose 2.4% in early November, despite a drop in sales of light trucks. The total 
of cars and trucks sold from Nov. 1 through Nov. 10 was 241,357, up from 
235,750 in the period last year, one of the weakest sales periods of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The government retail sales report for October showed weakness in several 
sectors, including home furnishings, department stores and apparel, said Alison 
Lynn Reaser, vice president and senior economist for First Interstate Bank in 
Los Angeles. "It appears people may be cutting back even on eating out," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the dollar volume of automobiles sales was up in October, the actual 
number of units sold was down, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bright notes in the report were a 1.5% rebound in building materials, which had 
fallen 1.5% in September, and a 1.6% boost in drugstore purchases on top of a 
0.9% gain in September. Gasoline sales jumped 3.2%, reflecting higher oil 
prices since Iraq invaded Kuwait in August. 
</P>
<P>
October sales of durable goods -- things such as cars and refrigerators that 
are expected to last longer than three years -- rose 0.7%. Non-durable goods 
sales slipped 0.2%. 
</P>
<P>
Department store sales fell 0.6% despite heavy discounting and advertising. 
Clothing store sales dropped 1% while furniture stores saw a 0.3% decrease. 
Automotive dealerships reported a 0.7% gain. 
</P>
<P>
Sales were off 0.5% at food stores and 0.3% at restaurants. All the Commerce 
Department statistics are adjusted for seasonal variations. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers probably will continue special promotions and sales this year, Reaser 
said. Many stores earn half their annual profits during the Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumers probably can find some fairly good bargains, so that's good news," 
she said. "But it's going to be the most difficult year the retail industry has 
had since the last recession."

Iroquois Pipeline Approved: A $583-million pipeline to supply Canadian natural 
gas to the utilities in the northeastern United States moved a step closer to 
construction as the five-member Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
unanimously approved the project. The decision came after months of debate 
between utility companies and environmentalists over whether or not the 
370-mile Iroquois Gas Transmission System project was needed. The pipeline, 
carrying natural gas from Alberta, will run from Iroquois, Ontario, to Long 
Island, N.Y., crossing New York state and Connecticut.

REAL ESTATE BROKER MAY LAY OFF 500; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: THE MOVE BY JON DOUGLAS CO. IS SEEN AS MORE FALLOUT FROM THE RECENT 
SLOWDOWN IN HOME SALES. 
</P>

Jon Douglas Co., one of the best-known real estate brokerages in Los Angeles, 
is preparing to lay off as many as 500 agents, or about 20% of its sales force, 
the company confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The news is the latest evidence of the continuing deterioration in California's 
residential real estate market, whose decline accelerated after Iraq's Aug. 2 
invasion of Kuwait sent consumer confidence plunging. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Great Western Real Estate closed its new home sales division and 
fired 39 full-time employees. 
</P>
<P>
"Eight weeks ago, the (business) faucets were shut off," said one interior 
decorator in Orange County whose livelihood is highly dependent on new-home 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
In a phone interview, Jon Douglas said he has ordered managers of his 36 
offices in California to evaluate the least productive agents -- the bottom 20% 
-- and decide whether they should be fired. 
</P>
<P>
The company has more than 2,400 agents in offices, mainly in West Los Angeles, 
Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley. "What I told our managers is, 'If . . . 
the agents are not doing their job, then you've got to get rid of them,' " said 
Douglas, whose firm is one of the 10 largest real estate brokerages in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Among the early casualties were at least 10 agents in the Marina del Rey office 
who were fired last Friday, according to one of those let go. Several were said 
to be trainees who had only begun. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a shock to a lot of hard-working people who believed they wouldn't be 
let go unless they were dishonest or evil," the fired agent said. 
</P>
<P>
One rival applauded Douglas' move. "To the degree he is laying off 
nonproductive real estate agents . . . I think it's an intelligent move that 
every large, legitimate regional brokerage is examining very closely right 
now," said Rick Merrill, president of Prudential California Realty in Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Another rival, Fred Sands, questioned the wisdom of the move, pointing out that 
firing agents does not save much money because they work on commission. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas said the managers should complete employee evaluation within two weeks, 
leading to a staff reduction of as many as 500. He said the number, though, 
could be "much less."

American Loses Route Decision: American Airlines lost its pitch for a coveted 
Chicago-Tokyo route as the U.S. Department of Transportation affirmed an 
earlier decision to give it to United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
American said it was "extremely distressed" with the decision, which it 
contends "slams the door on any hope of competition in the Pacific." United is 
the nation's leading transpacific carrier; the DOT gave United the route 
because it serves more destinations from Tokyo than American. The DOT also 
affirmed a previous decision to award Delta a Los Angeles-Tokyo route.

Michael Milken's Sentencing Delayed: Sentencing of the former junk bond 
financier will take place next week, a clerk for U.S. District Judge Kimba M. 
Wood said. The sentencing was expected to take place this week. 
</P>
<P>
No reason for the delay was given. A specific date and time for the sentencing 
was not announced. Milken, 44, the former head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s 
high-yield bond department, faces up to 28 years in prison for his guilty plea 
to six felony counts of conspiracy and fraud related to illegal securities 
trading. Prosecutors are seeking a stiff prison sentence. Milken and his 
attorneys have asked the judge for a term of community service. Sentencing 
initially was scheduled for Oct. 1 but was delayed for a hearing into 
additional government allegations against Milken. Milken submitted a lengthy 
letter to the judge accepting responsibility for his crimes but requesting 
leniency.

ICAHN PICKS PANEL TO KEEP AN EYE ON USX BOARD; 
</P>
<P>
STEEL: THE INVESTOR SAYS HIS COMMITTEE WILL CHECK ON WHETHER THE FIRM 
RESTRUCTURES THE WAY HE WANTS. IF NOT, HE'LL SEEK TO REPLACE THE DIRECTORS.

Investor Carl C. Icahn unveiled a "shareholder enhancement committee" for USX 
Corp. on Wednesday and said its five members would seek election to the board 
next year unless the Pittsburgh-based conglomerate restructures itself along 
lines he wants. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn, who owns 13.3% of the steel and energy firm once known as U.S. Steel 
Corp., portrayed the committee as a "liaison" between USX and shareholders. It 
is headed up by well-known shareholder-rights advocates. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to USX Chairman Charles Corry spelling out plans for the committee, 
Icahn -- himself the chairman of Trans World Airlines, which he took over in 
1985 -- said the group wouldn't seek board seats if USX enacts "a meaningful 
restructuring plan and corporate governance changes." 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring refers to Icahn's longstanding effort to get USX to spin off 
its steel division, which he says has depressed the price of USX stock. About 
70% of USX sales and 80% of profits this year have come from its Texas Oil 
&amp; Gas Co. and Marathon Oil Co. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn lost a proxy fight on the issue last May, when shareholders defeated a 
proposal requiring the board to split the steel and energy divisions into two 
corporations to be owned by existing shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
However, USX has since taken steps toward selling at least part of its steel 
operations. Last month, its board approved the transfer of USX's steel division 
to a wholly owned subsidiary in what is viewed as a precursor to the sale of 
those assets, either to the public or various steel companies that have shown 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
As to Icahn's latest thrust, USX said it "will review (his) demands in due 
course." 
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Corry, Icahn applauded his "apparent change of heart" and 
urged that any proceeds from the sale of steel assets go directly to 
shareholders as a special dividend. 
</P>
<P>
Just how the special shareholder committee fits into Icahn's strategy wasn't 
immediately clear. But one of its directors, Harvard University Prof. John 
Pound, said it "absolutely isn't" a prelude to a takeover attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the hostile takeover efforts of the 1980s, it is "a less 
confrontational mechanism" for making publicly held corporations more 
accountable to shareholders, said Pound, who heads a corporate voting research 
project at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. 
</P>
<P>
Pound and Stanford University law professor Ronald Gilson are co-chairmen of 
the group, which also includes Darius Gaskins, former Burlington Northern 
Railroad chief executive who now is a Harvard economist; Paul Quirk, head of 
the Massachusetts state pension fund board, and Katherine Schipper, professor 
at the University of Chicago business school. 
</P>
<P>
According to Icahn's letter, they will consult with shareholders on various 
issues, including the steel spinoff. Icahn is paying the members $15,000 each 
and giving them 300 shares of USX stock, which was worth $32.125 a share at the 
close of trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. Pound and Gilson 
will get an extra $7,500 as co-chairmen. 
</P>
<P>
Icahn said he was paying them in advance "to ensure the independence" of their 
findings. However, he said they all agree with him that "U.S. corporations in 
general have lost their competitive edge in world markets because managements 
are not held truly accountable to shareholders, the real owners of our public 
corporations."

ENTERTAINMENT; 
</P>
<P>
JACKSON GOING FOR BIG ROYALTY INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pop superstar Michael Jackson has dispatched his legal representative to New 
York to nail down the final details of a revised contract with CBS Records that 
is expected to be the most lucrative in music history. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson lawyer Bertram Fields went to New York this week to join the singer's 
primary contract negotiator -- New York attorney Allen Grubman -- who is 
seeking to secure from CBS Records a special production arrangement for Jackson 
as well as royalties of more than $2.50 per album, sources say. Jackson is also 
asking CBS Records, which is owned by Sony Corp., for his own recording label 
and other concessions, a source close to Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
The entertainer is proposing that CBS Records advance him more than $18 million 
per album, a cost that the company would recoup from Jackson's $2.50-plus 
per-album royalty. Pop music royalties typically range from $1 to $1.50 per 
album, including publishing royalties. 
</P>
<P>
It could not be learned whether the per-album royalty is based on the retail or 
wholesale album price or whether the proposed royalty includes publishing 
rights or other costs. Royalties negotiated under standard CBS Records 
contracts normally include publishing royalties and are based on an album's 
wholesale price. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the stiff royalty being sought by Jackson would leave CBS Records with 
precious little profit, industry sources say. One entertainment lawyer 
estimates that under Jackson's current agreement with CBS Records, an album 
would have to sell more than 6 million copies before CBS Records would make any 
money. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are extraordinary numbers," said another entertainment lawyer. "CBS 
doesn't have a lot of room left over to pay for publishing royalties, shipping, 
manufacturing and overhead. . . . On the other hand, there are probably a lot 
of other labels out there who would love to sign Michael Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
CBS Records spokesman Bob Altshuler declined to comment about the status of 
contract negotiations with Jackson or speculate about the artist's importance 
to the label: "We never talk about any negotiations with anyone," Altshuler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But CBS Records has been under pressure to reach an accord with the entertainer 
in the wake of the rancorous departure of its volatile former chief executive, 
Walter R. Yetnikoff, who often boasted of his close relationship with CBS 
Records' artists. 
</P>
<P>
Yetnikoff's relationship with Jackson deteriorated in June when he got into a 
dispute with rival record industry mogul David Geffen over Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Yetnikoff and former Jackson attorney John Branca had opposed a Geffen effort 
to get Jackson to perform for the soundtrack of the movie "Days of Thunder." 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the dispute, Jackson fired Branca, hired new lawyers and 
advisers, and asked CBS Records to renegotiate his current record contract, 
which would have paid him an estimated $18 million for his next album. 
</P>
<P>
While no entertainer apparently has a record deal that rivals Jackson's current 
pact with CBS Records, Jackson, who is known to be obsessed with setting music 
industry precedents, wants to make sure his deal far outdistances that of any 
other artist, including his sister Janet Jackson, who is currently 
renegotiating her contract with A&amp;M Records.

INVENTOR SETTLES FORD SUIT FOR $10.2 MILLION; 
</P>
<P>
AUTOS: THE CREATOR OF INTERMITTENT WINDSHIELD WIPERS STILL PLANS TO PURSUE 
PATENT-INFRINGEMENT SUITS AGAINST 19 OTHER COMPANIES.

<P>
The inventor of intermittent windshield wipers ended a 12-year-old 
patent-infringement lawsuit against Ford Motor Co. on Wednesday by accepting 
$10.2 million from the auto maker. 
</P>
<P>
A Ford attorney called the settlement "extremely reasonable," adding that the 
agreement resolved all disputes between the company and 63-year-old inventor 
Robert Kearns. 
</P>
<P>
Kearns had sued 19 other auto makers, claiming that they violated his patent on 
intermittent windshield wipers -- the kind that operate at intervals and are 
now standard or optional on nearly all cars sold in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Kearns and his attorney said they still plan to pursue their suits against all 
the auto makers. Chrysler Corp. may be the next defendant up for trial, but a 
Chrysler spokesman indicated that his company may be willing to settle. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the Ford settlement, we're encouraged that we will probably be able 
to reach agreement with Mr. Kearns without extended litigation," Chrysler 
spokesman Tom Houston said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pleased to be done with the litigation," said Ford attorney Malcolm 
Wheeler. "We still believe that if we had another shot at it, the patents would 
have been held invalid." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the goal was the magnitude of the money," Kearns said after 
signing the settlement in U.S. District Judge Avern Cohn's courtroom. "What I 
saw (as) my role was to defend the patent system. If I don't go further, there 
really isn't a patent system." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Durkee, one of Kearns' attorneys, said Chrysler probably would be the next 
legal target. Chrysler, Durkee said, has agreed not to contest the validity of 
Kearns' patents, an argument that took up time in the Ford trial. 
</P>
<P>
Durkee said the settlement, of which his firm is expected to get 30% to 40%, 
was a good deal for Ford. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Ford got away with more than they should," Durkee said Wednesday. 
"They made a profit from their infringement." 
</P>
<P>
Dealers have sold an estimated 20 million Ford, Lincoln and Mercury cars 
equipped with intermittent wipers. After legal defense costs, the settlement 
nets Kearns 33 cents per car. 
</P>
<P>
If the Ford settlement pattern were followed with Chrysler's estimated 13 
million cars with intermittent wipers, it would work out to about $4.3 million 
without legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Kearns, a former Gaithersburg, Md., resident who now lives in a rented 
apartment in Houston, filed the suit claiming that he installed a set of 
intermittent windshield wipers on a 1962 Ford Galaxie and took it to the auto 
maker. 
</P>
<P>
Kearns, who was a professor at Wayne State University in Detroit at the time, 
said he was led to believe that Ford would buy his invention by the number of 
questions engineers asked. 
</P>
<P>
When that failed to happen, he sued. 
</P>
<P>
Four law firms have represented him during the course of the litigation. One 
mistrial was declared after a jury was unable to decide on an award. During a 
retrial, Kearns left Cohn's courtroom after writing an angry letter to the 
judge and disappeared for several days. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the settlement money due in an escrow account by the end of the week, 
Kearns said he plans to pay off some legal debts and, perhaps, buy a house in 
Texas. And he'll continue the legal battles to protect his patent. 
</P>
<P>
"They (lawyers) are running a business," he said. "I'm running a cause."

<TEXT>
<P>
Apple-picking -- it's a pastime as American as . . . well, apple pie. And every 
autumn, this is where a growing number of Southern Californians come to do it. 
</P>
<P>
For loads of fruit and fun -- by the bag, basket or bushel -- they come to this 
mile-high, apple-growing region about 90 minutes east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A bumper crop of Jonagolds, pippins, Staymen Winesaps, Arkansas Blacks and 50 
other varieties grown in the glen, offer visitors easy pickings right through 
the holidays, say growers. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneered by Enoch Parrish, a potato farmer-cum-apple rancher in the 1860s, 12 
local orchards now produce about 360,000 bushels of apples each season, or 
roughly 1,000 bushels an acre. Several of the apples turn up in some of the 
3,500 pies sold each weekend from five restaurants along the Oak Glen Road 
"loop." 
</P>
<P>
"This is our slice of paradise," said Mark Robertson, co-owner of the 320-acre 
Los Rios Rancho, the area's largest apple farm. 
</P>
<P>
In fall, Oak Glen's native sycamores, box elders and liquid ambers are awash in 
crimson and gold. Here is vivid evidence that Southern California does 
experience all the blaze and glory of the changing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Oak Glen is the closest you're going to come to the scenery of the 
Appalachians and Blue Ridge mountains," said Scott Riley, co-owner of Riley's 
Historic Farm and Orchard, formerly part of the Joe E. Wilshire ranch founded 
in 1871. 
</P>
<P>
But even in such a pristine setting, a few seeds of discontent are beginning to 
take root. Farmers struggle against the vagaries of Mother Nature, such as 
freezes, drought and coddling moths, while enthusiastic developers wave 
fistfuls of cash for their land. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody in his right mind would put houses in here," said Freeman House, the 
fiddle-playing owner of the nine-acre Stone Pantry Orchard, a stone's throw 
from Riley's. 
</P>
<P>
To keep the developers at bay, some farmers are resorting to recreational 
farming. They open up their orchards to visitors who pick their own apples and 
press their own cider for free. 
</P>
<P>
At Riley's, Oak Glen's first recreational farm, ranch guests can enjoy 
hayrides, hoedowns, hiking trails, campfires, pioneer crafts, barnyard animals 
and carriage weddings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become 60% of our income," Riley said. "And we need to do more of that to 
pay for the trees." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbor Freeman House described entertainment farming in simple economic 
terms: "I'm getting 80 cents a pound for U-pick, which is more than you pay in 
the market for fruit," he said. "But the thing I'm really selling is a day in 
the country and the experience of going out and picking the apple and learning 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
At Los Rios, another recreational farm, visitors find two commercial cider 
presses, a winery, bakery, salesroom, bird pen, animal corral and weekend pony 
rides. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not in competition with Disneyland," Robertson said. "It doesn't cost 
money to get in. Our hope is that people will come up and buy a few apples and 
have a piece of pie." 
</P>
<P>
On fall weekends, however, Oak Glen can attract what seem like Disneyland-size 
crowds, swelling the mountain enclave's population of 500 by several hundred. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little Coney Island-ish at times," said Alex Law, who opened Oak Glen's 
first fruit stand in 1931. "But it's our livelihood." 
</P>
<P>
Harvest time in the glen promises a full crop of activities for the whole 
family, say growers. Call local ranches and salesrooms for picking schedules 
and information on coming events. Many are open to the public only on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 To reach Oak Glen from Los Angeles, take Interstate 10 east to the Yucaipa-Oak 
Glen off-ramp. Follow Yucaipa Boulevard east to Oak Glen Road, then follow the 
well-marked road to the orchards. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hi-Country Orchards, 38695 Oak Glen Road, (714) 797-4249. 
</P>
<P>
Owners Doug and Sandy Sheets say they share the best of both worlds. Apple 
trees on the property are available for U-pick and U-press cider. Customers 
also can purchase a wide assortment of apples brought in from their family-run 
orchard in Omak, Wash. A large, stainless-steel kitchen on the premises 
produces apple butters, jellies, jams, pie-fillings as well as a variety of 
sugar-free apple products. 
</P>
<P>
* Johnny Appleseed Ranch, 38070 Potato Canyon Road, (714) 797-7575. 
</P>
<P>
A former dairy farm, the 50-acre U-pick ranch produces 11 varieties of apples. 
There is a self-serve cider press as well as fresh-picked apples and raw cider 
for sale in the apple shed. 
</P>
<P>
* Los Rios Rancho, 29610 Oak Glen Road, (714) 797-1005. 
</P>
<P>
Owned and managed by Mark, Robbie and Annie Robertson, Los Rios has four acres 
of U-pick apples. The cider press squeezes 4,000 gallons of cider a week. 
Behind the barn, Frank Rivers runs a small winery and produces a hard apple 
cider with a 9% alcohol content. 
</P>
<P>
* Law's Cider Mill and Ranch, 38392 Oak Glen Road, (714) 797-1459. 
</P>
<P>
From Alex Law's roadside stand has grown a mini-apple empire, which now 
includes a coffee shop, gift shop and cider mill, all operated by family 
members. The senior Law still runs the apple stand and the family's 60-acre 
apple ranch. While customers wait in line for a slice of hot apple pie, they 
are entertained by a machine that automatically peels, cores and slices the 
apples. About three pounds of apples fill each pie. 
</P>
<P>
* McFarland's Ranch, 38500 Oak Glen Road, (714) 797-4060. 
</P>
<P>
From 1951 to 1989, Pat and Minabelle McFarland divided chores on their 22-acre 
ranch. Pat ran the salesroom while his wife supervised the cider mill. With 
Pat's death last year, Minabelle presses on, promising to stay open "through 
February or March, or until the last apple is sold." 
</P>
<P>
* Parrish Pioneer Ranch, 38561 Oak Glen Road, (714) 797-2010. 
</P>
<P>
Enoch Parrish planted Oak Glen's first apple tree here in the 1860s. Today 
several varieties are grown under the supervision of Juan Vasquez, ranch 
foreman since 1942. Owners Joe and Betty Burkle manage the 101-acre ranch, 
including a village with bakery, restaurant and several specialty shops. 
Enoch's home, built in 1876, is now an antique shop. Each Sunday, Johnny 
Appleseed distributes small pouches of apple seeds, with one set of 
instructions for city folk and another for country folk. On Dec. 1, carolers 
and a hand-bell choir will usher in the Christmas season. At 6 p.m. Betty will 
throw the switch to light up the village. Visitors also can breakfast with 
Santa on Dec. 8, 9, 15 and 16 at 10 a.m. Reservations are $6 a person. 
</P>
<P>
* Riley's Farm &amp; Orchard, 12253 S. Oak Glen Road, (714) 790-2364. 
</P>
<P>
Joe E. Wilshire bought the ranch in 1871 for a chicken, a saddle, a jug of 
whiskey and $8. Today, owners Dennis, Scott and "Grandpa" Riley are committed 
to keeping the ranch "100 years behind the times." On weekends at 12, 1 and 2 
p.m., the musical Rileys lead guests through marches, reels and quadrilles in a 
cavernous red barn built in 1887. In the General Mercantile, pick up some 
horehound candy, grind your own coffee or play a game of checkers by the warmth 
of the potbelly stove. 
</P>
<P>
* Snow-line Orchards, 34900 Oak Glen Road, (714) 797-3415. 
</P>
<P>
Owners Mert and Shirley Hudson operate a 1920 mechanical cider press for which 
parts no longer exist; each glass of juice may be the last. Irene and Nathan 
Simpson, better known among locals as Grandma and Grandpa Apple, host the 
apple-tasting bar. Strangely enough, Snow-line may be more famous for its 
spreading chestnut tree, reputed to be the Southland's oldest, than its apple 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
* Stone Pantry Orchard, on Oak Glen Road between Willowbrook Ranch and the 
Wilshire Apple Shed. No phone. 
</P>
<P>
Carved from the old Wilshire spread, Stone Pantry is a small U-pick, U-press 
orchard owned by Freeman House, a cello and trumpet-playing member of the 
Garden Grove Symphony. He says his nine acres of trees are irrigated with the 
same mountain spring water that supplies the Arrowhead Water Co. "If it was 
legal for me to bottle the water, I'd be a millionaire," House said.

Bob Weir, a medical researcher and laboratory equipment designer for 26 years, 
now fashions pioneer crafts in his woodworker's shop. During the week, he dons 
his tricorn, operates his peddle lathe and performs on the claw hammer banjo in 
conjunction with Riley's weekday school tours. He also sells Staymen Winesap

The smallest apple ranch in the glen boasts 29 varieties of apples and an 
antique apple polisher that resembles a small car wash. A half bushel of apples 
and pears goes into each bottle of cider, enough to generously fill a 
one-gallon bottle to take home and a couple of glasses for your immediate 
refreshment. Jim Woods prunes all his own trees, carefully opening center 
branches so that the sunlight can color the fruit. Wife Pat serves apple 
samples like a wine connoisseur, her slices ranging from bland to tart to 
sweet.

ERMA BOMBECK: MR. &amp; MRS. SUPERMAN?; 
</P>
<P>
IT HAS A HOLLOW RING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's always news when a bachelor of long standing gets off the dime and decides 
to take a bride. The world was atwitter recently when Clark Kent (a.k.a. 
Superman) proposed to the Daily Planet's star reporter, Lois Lane. Not since 
Prince Charles and Hugh Hefner decided to take their respective plunges has 
there been such a flap. 
</P>
<P>
I knew people were waiting longer to get married these days, but 50 years! Get 
outta here. I thought that kind of snap decision-making rested only with our 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
To tell you the truth, I don't feel good about this marriage. On one hand we 
have an aging crime fighter with one foot in the kryptonite. On the other, we 
have an old reporter who will not only have to jump-start her biological clock, 
but who has the mind of a food processor. (If Clark Kent takes off his glasses 
before climbing into the marriage bed, Lois won't even know who he is.) 
</P>
<P>
I hate to say it, but some people should remain in a single state. 
Personalities such as Smokey the Bear, Cathy, Miss Piggy and Warren Beatty are 
better off traveling alone. I'd hate to hear Barbie and Ken are getting 
married, despite the fact that all those little trousseaux that would be 
snapped up by indulgent mothers could put this country back on its economic 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
I don't want Mary Worth saying, "I'd like to meddle in your life, dear, but my 
husband likes to eat dinner at 6." I don't want to hear a Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtle say, "Jeez, my kid spilled oatmeal on my guitar strings," or that Mrs. 
Batman wore her husband's tights to aerobics and sprung a run in them. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow it's unnatural for Superman and Lois to be arguing about what kind of a 
phone booth they want installed at the house so he can change his clothes, 
AT&amp;T, MCI or Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
I can just imagine Lois' mother when she hears the news. "What do you see in 
this man?" 
</P>
<P>
"Mother, he's faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, 
and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound." 
</P>
<P>
"He's not good enough for you, Lois." 
</P>
<P>
"Mom, please. I've been waiting for his proposal for 50 years." 
</P>
<P>
"So, we're not asking you not to get married. We're just asking you to wait."

BEST BETS: TRUMPETER'S SOUNDS TO MIX WITH QUINTET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If seeing the world's jazz greats is on your list of entertainment priorities, 
you won't want to miss trumpeter Freddie Hubbard at the Wheeler Hot Springs 
restaurant Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Playing everything from be-bop to free jazz to '70s fusion, Hubbard displays a 
virtuosity equalled by few. 
</P>
<P>
His long list of accolades includes a Grammy. Recently, he was chosen the "best 
trumpet player in the world" in a Down Beat readers' poll. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard will be joined Friday by local pianist Theo Saunders and members of 
Hubbard's quintet, including accompanying trumpeter Bob Shephard and drummer 
Ralph Penland. Concert-goers will hear an encyclopedia of musical ideas on the 
trumpet, as well as Hubbard's fuller-sounding fluegelhorn performance. 
</P>
<P>
Seating for the two-hour concert is $25. A dinner show package is $50. Wheeler 
Hot Springs is at 16825 Maricopa Highway, Ojai. For more information and 
reservations, call 646-8131.

BEST BETS: GRAPHIC ART AND A JAZZY TRUMPET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Conejo Valley Art Museum opens Friday with an exhibit titled "Chasing the 
Line" by Claire Falkenstein. For Falkenstein, a major California artist best 
known for her metal works, this exhibit is like no other she has done before. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be the first time I have had an exhibition with graphics playing the 
dominant part of the display," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Falkenstein, 81, is best known for her metal sculptural webs, suggestive of 
molecular structure and biological growth patterns. But it is her drawings, she 
said, that are responsible for her success. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm only existing as an artist because of trial and errors that come about 
through drawings. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is connected. It's a natural progression working from paper and 
moving through to sculpture," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Those interested in meeting Falkenstein can do so during an opening 7 p.m. 
reception Friday. Falkenstein will present a slide show and lecture on her 
work. A documentary by Jay Carmichael, featuring the artist, will follow. 
</P>
<P>
"Chasing the Line" will continue through Dec. 24. The museum is at 191 Wilbur 
Road, Thousand Oaks. Call 499-4355.

NIGHT LIFE SPECIAL BEAT; 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
MEMBERS OF THE ENGLISH BEAT AND THE SPECIALS HAVE JOINED FORCES TO FINANCE 
THEIR OWN U.S. TOUR.

<P>
There are some elementary laws that seem to govern rock 'n' roll. For example, 
rock 'n' roll groups never die, the members just form new groups. Secondly, 
that yahoo with the whistle will always sit behind you, while the seven-foot 
dancing fool will always be in front of you. And, of course, concert T-shirts 
cost around 20 bucks and no one will ever believe you were there if you don't 
buy one. Finally, the bathroom is always out of order. 
</P>
<P>
Law No. 1 is germane this week because two of the best ska dance bands ever -- 
the English Beat and the Specials -- are coming together as a single band, 
brand-new for the '90s, the Special Beat. The new band features, among others, 
vocalist Neville Staples from the Specials and Ranking Roger, former Beat front 
man. Also joining the band for the West Coast dates will be the Beat's other 
lead singer, David Wakeling. 
</P>
<P>
And the band is doing it without any help from its friends. The Special Beat 
has no record, no record company, no music videos, no hits, no concert 
T-shirts, but a 35-date concert tour including a Monday night dance-a-thon at 
the venerable Ventura Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping to get an American label interested," said Staples in a recent 
telephone interview. "We're financing the tour ourselves, so we couldn't afford 
to bring the Beat's old sax player, Saxa, but if we get a record deal we will 
next time. So far, the tour has been brilliant." 
</P>
<P>
And Staples has been pleased with the crowds, so far, which he said have been 
very good -- not great, but good. "All of our old fans were there plus a lot of 
new ones who I think were too young to come and see us back in the early '80s," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The band will be performing the biggies from both groups -- which hit their 
strides in the early '80s, then broke up. The English Beat was a headlining 
act, playing often in Southern California, including a memorable performance at 
the first US Festival in 1982. Musical proof that the whole is indeed greater 
than the sum of its parts, the Beat mutated into General Public, a band 
featuring both Roger and Wakeling. The rhythm section from the Beat fared best, 
forming Fine Young Cannibals, which, so far, has made lots of money. The 
Specials went on to become Fun Boy Three then the Specials AKA, both garnering 
critical acclaim, but not a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
None of the later incarnations came close to rivaling the breakneck 
ya-gotta-dance ska music of the original bands. Ska music is infectious to any 
and all feet within a 12-block radius -- it could make a statue of a guy 
yawning at the opera get up and dance. 
</P>
<P>
"Ska music is basically Jamaican with a chop-chop downbeat," Staples said. 
"Reggae music evolved from ska music -- reggae just slowed down the beat. We 
put life back into ska by upping the tempo of the original ska stuff. People 
like Prince Buster in the '50s were the first ska artists to make an impression 
in England." 
</P>
<P>
There is a considerable Jamaican population in England, said Staples, who is 
from Coventry and grew up listening to ska music. "When the Specials started in 
1977, I was a deejay," he said. "Then I started going to their rehearsals, then 
their gigs, helping with the gear and stuff. Then I became their mixer guy. One 
night they were opening for the Clash, and I was deejaying with a mike and the 
crowd loved it, and I got onstage." Working with Roger was something he wanted 
for a long time, Staples said, but Roger always seemed too busy. 
</P>
<P>
"But then last year, at a UB40 show, Roger and I got on stage and really hit it 
off, and now, here we are. I've always loved performing. I'm a maniac on 
stage," Staples said. 
</P>
<P>
Get those dancing shoes ready -- they'll be getting a serious workout, even 
before the Special Beat takes the stage. Opening will be the Oingo Boingo 
spinoff band, Food For Feet, plus the best reggae/rock band in Ventura, the 
Lion I's. 
</P>
<P>
"We just love meeting new people," Staples said. "We're proof that black guys 
and white guys can get along just fine. People just sing along, and of course, 
dance. We just have a good time and make people happy. What could be better?"

JIM NAYLOR PULLED THE PLUG ON KAMIKAZE CYCLE RACING. VENTURA RACEWAY IS MAKING 
SOME MONEY. 
</P>

<P>
It was the chariot race from Ben Hur 20 times a night! Speedway motorcycle 
racing featured riders with no friends, no fans, no fear and no sense -- riding 
spindly motorcycles that accelerated from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in less than three 
seconds with no brakes. No kidding! Four or six crazy riders would try to pass 
one another around corners where only three would fit. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the injury rate equaled that of the extra crew members who 
beam down to that uncharted planet with Kirk and Spock. It was a heavy-metal 
concert with no music. "Speedway" was part Rollerball, part Roller Derby, part 
ice hockey and a kamikaze attack on wheels. 
</P>
<P>
Speedway at the Ventura Raceway -- the "Commotion by the Ocean" -- was the 
antidote for Tuesday night television for local racing fans for 18 years. It 
was a party interrupted by some racing. It's a party somewhere else now. 
Speedway croaked at the Ventura Raceway in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
And, according to owner and promoter Jim Naylor, without speedway, the Ventura 
Raceway has never been healthier. 
</P>
<P>
"When I would see 'Flyin' ' Mike Faria and 'Sudden Sam' Ermolenko go 
wheel-to-wheel for four laps, it used to get me all pumped up," Naylor said. 
"What can I say? I love it. But it just got harder and harder over the years to 
get riders to come up here and we finally had to pull the plug on speedway." 
</P>
<P>
But there are plenty of other types of vehicles that are just as loud, just as 
fast, and maybe just as exciting. The Ventura Raceway now routinely stages 
races involving street stocks, mini-stocks, TQ midgets, USAC full midgets and 
motocross. And since speedway went south for the duration, the Ventura Raceway 
is actually making money after 10 years in the red, Naylor said. 
</P>
<P>
"Motorsports have been on a continuous upswing for the last three years, 
particularly the stock cars and the USAC Midgets," said Art Amelio, assistant 
manager for the Ventura County Fair. "We see continued growth for motor sports 
at this location." 
</P>
<P>
The raceway, located at the County Fairgrounds, opened in 1971 to stage 
speedway motorcycle races. The promoter, a one-armed ex-racer named Johnny 
Mantz, was killed in 1972 in a traffic accident in Oak View. The "godfather of 
speedway," Orange County promoter Harry Oxley, took over the operation for the 
next five years, and the Ventura Raceway prospered, often drawing over 3,000 
racing fans. 
</P>
<P>
Riders, who sounded as if they just rolled off the guest list at the Big House 
-- Danny (Berzerko) Becker, Mike (The Madman) Muntean, (Dangerous) Dubb Ferrell 
and Fillmore's own Bobby (Insane) McLain -- dazzled the fans with meticulous 
motorcycle moves. And the likes of National Champion Mike Bast, Mike Curoso and 
Dennis Sigalos were just as good (even better), despite the fact that they 
couldn't afford a decent nickname. The last American world champion, Bruce 
Penhall, was a Tuesday night regular. 
</P>
<P>
A riders strike crippled the speedway in 1978 and Oxley bailed out of Ventura, 
leaving a new promoter, Mike Doyle. By 1979, he was bankrupt, and Port Hueneme 
native Naylor bought the Ventura Raceway in order to promote TQ midget races, 
inheriting the speedway in the bargain. It lasted another 10 years as Naylor 
enlarged the track more times than Warren Beatty changed girlfriends. 
</P>
<P>
The raceway had its ups and downs. Speedway Magazine called it Track of the 
Year in 1985. But in the 1984 preseason opener -- the Spring Classic -- the 
riders refused to ride despite a full house, saying that the condition of the 
track was too dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Naylor wouldn't have won any popularity contests that day. Then National 
Champion Mike Bast led the riders strike and was quoted as saying to Naylor, 
"What if I break my neck? Are you going to tell me you're sorry?" 
</P>
<P>
The other top riders agreed with Bast and the race was off. Later, the Speedway 
Control Board told Naylor he wouldn't open the season unless he fixed the 
track. He did. 
</P>
<P>
Speedway began to lose its attraction to racing fans, gradually becoming about 
as popular as the edible screwdriver. Three-quarters of the sellout crowds came 
disguised as empty seats. Top riders began to stay away because Ventura was too 
far, too fast and too cold. 
</P>
<P>
"The riders strike in 1978 was actually the beginning of the end," said Naylor. 
"The rider walkout at the 1983 Spring Classic didn't help, either, and finally 
the road work on the Conejo Grade in '87 and '88 was about the last straw. It 
was just too hard to get here from L.A. Also, we couldn't get any local press 
coverage." 
</P>
<P>
And that was the end of speedway. 
</P>
<P>
"But motocross lives," Naylor said. 
</P>
<P>
"We started doing motocross the next weekend after the last speedway race in 
April, 1988. Last weekend, for example, we had 131 riders sign up to race. 
We've had over 700 different motocross riders here." 
</P>
<P>
Naylor has been involved in racing all his life. Racing is his life. On 
Fridays, he can be found building the race track, and he's also the track 
announcer. 
</P>
<P>
When he's not at the track, Naylor has a business, Auto Graphics, a custom 
painting/lettering shop in Oxnard. He paints lots of race cars. 
</P>
<P>
"I originally got into racing because I had no choice. It was my dad's No. 1 
hobby. It's all he cared about." 
</P>
<P>
Now it is all Naylor cares about. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the cars. I love the smells, the noise, the competition. I love good 
racing."

It's difficult to shop and cook for one person. On Thanksgiving, it is 
particularly hard. The traditional holiday meal takes hours to cook and usually 
there is too much food for one person to enjoy. Then there is the problem of 
trying to enjoy it alone. 
</P>
<P>
If you'd rather not cook, and if you'd like to share the holiday with other 
single seniors, there are plenty of dining opportunities available Nov. 21-24. 
</P>

Ventura interior designers Jone Pence and Paul Morse have learned to turn 
adversity -- and rot -- to their advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Their refurbishment of a bathroom for Ventura Design House '90 recently earned 
them a prestigious award sponsored by Remodeling Magazine and the National 
Assn. of Home Builders (NAHB) Remodelors Council. Design House '90 was a 
fund-raiser for the Ventura County Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
"The bathroom wasn't functioning for over a year because of a leak in the 
shower. We had to demolish it," Pence said . "There was ivy growing in the 
walls and dry-rot all over the floor and leading to the master bedroom." 
</P>
<P>
The well-earned award will be presented in January at the NAHB convention in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Moorpark's Community Services Department just came out with its 
catalogue of winter recreation activities. To highlight the schedule, the 
department made up one of those puzzles in which you have to find words hidden 
within a grid of letters. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the activities and phrases that puzzlers are asked to find include: 
"holiday craft faire," "musical fun time," "tree lighting ceremony" and "bus 
schedule." 
</P>
<P>
When there is a chill in the air, a light breeze, turkey and all the fixin's -- 
we don't know about you, but our thoughts always turn to bus schedules. 
</P>
<P>
More incoming info.: We received a fax from an ad agency telling us that 
McDonald's is donating 4,100 trees to Thousand Oaks. (Or is that Five Thousand 
Oaks?) Anyway, the cover sheet of the fax read: 
</P>
<P>
"If you do not receive, please call (the phone number)." 
</P>
<P>
It's just a good thing we received it. If we hadn't, we wouldn't have known who 
to call. Or why. 
</P>
<P>
How does one get to Carnegie Hall? Avocado bread might do it. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura-based Gold Coast Community Chorus has been invited to perform at 
the famous performance center in July, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The string attached: Each of the 125 members must pay about $1,000 for travel, 
food and lodging. So to help with expenses, they are having a "Send a Singer to 
Carnegie Hall Bake Sale" in front of the Longs Drug Store at 50 N. Ashwood in 
Ventura on Saturday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Choir Director Kurt Berentsen understands the no expenses paid deal: "Obviously 
with an incredible amount of talent nearby they don't have to pay to ship 
people from the West Coast." 
</P>
<P>
More thought for food: 
</P>
<P>
If you've just been eating the stuff, you've been missing out. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just so much you can do with food when you start really thinking about 
it," said Jeanette Scovill, president of the California Vegetarian Assn. 
</P>
<P>
To prove it, she's organized a decoration contest that uses only edible 
materials. She suggests herbs, dried flowers and chilies. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes a lot of sense here in Southern California to use red chilies for the 
holidays," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Participants are asked to make an edible holiday decoration and bring it to the 
Conejo Valley Art Museum in Thousand Oaks on Nov. 30 at 6 p.m. The registration 
fee is $10 for groups and $2 for individuals. Winning decorations will be 
displayed at the museum. For information call 492-0811. 
</P>
<P>
And remember, these are to be vegetarian. So no meat or cheese wreaths, please.

THEATER REVIEW 'ARTURO UI'; 
</P>
<P>
POWERFUL BRECHT; 
</P>
<P>
THE DIRECTOR HAS MANAGED TO SQUEEZE ARTISTIC BLOOD OUT OF THIS POLEMICAL 
TURNIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Should the theater be appropriated to promote the interests of politics, 
religion, advertising or anything whatever, except art? One of the functions of 
the critic is to raise that question. 
</P>
<P>
Patrons arriving at the Studio Theater are confronted with huge placards 
exhibiting blown-up newspaper and magazine articles entitled "The Roots of 
Skinhead Violence," "The American Neo-Nazi Movement Today" and "Peril from an 
Imperial President." The last, a denunciation of President Bush's current 
Middle East policy. 
</P>
<P>
A press release informs us that visiting director Frank Condon "has become 
known as a master of blending exciting entertainment with politically 
controversial and challenging content." 
</P>
<P>
Inside is the worst dialectical theater piece Bertolt Brecht ever wrote, "The 
Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui." Brecht himself had so little regard for this 
play that it was never produced in his lifetime, never underwent final revision 
-- much less the 20 to 30 revisions per play he was known for. 
</P>
<P>
In the hands of a second-rate director, all of the above would be a recipe for 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
But, in fact, Condon is an artist of a director. He has managed to squeeze 
copious amounts of artistic blood out of this polemical turnip. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp, clean, astringent, visually and aurally striking, with every theatrical 
element dynamically fused, this is a textbook example, a paradigm, a veritable 
monument to the art of Brechtian theater. An educational video should be made, 
students from other schools should be bused in. One would have to go to Theatre 
am Schiffsbauerdamm in Berlin to see Brecht this pristine. 
</P>
<P>
All the famous Brechtian devices are lined up like an arsenal: naked lighting, 
documentary film, placards, a narrator, alienation, musuk (background music 
that does not engage the emotions), continuous brutality, graphic violence, 
caricature, allusive names, agitprop crudeness and the brusque, 
brain-staggering illogic of propaganda plays. 
</P>
<P>
Set in Chicago (Germany) in the 1930s, a two-bit gangster Arturo Ui (Hitler) 
and his gang (Nazis) wrest control of the Cauliflower Trust (wealthy landowners 
and industrialists) from Dogsborou (Reich Pesident von Hindenburg), burn down 
the warehouse (the Reichstag fire), kill Dullfet (Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss) 
and take over the act in neighboring Cicero (Austria). 
</P>
<P>
Ui, well played by Jason Cottle, is Chaplinesque. But lest we miss the point, 
we are squarely hit over the head with several baseball bats in the form of 
documentary footage of Hitler projected on a hanging video screen and ongoing 
commentary by the narrator delivered in an odd style that can only be described 
as manic smugness. 
</P>
<P>
High production standards are provided by Michael Devine, scenery; Dunya 
Ramicova, costumes; Tim Becker, lighting; Carol Whaley, makeup and hair design; 
Michael Mortilla, music, and Ralf Remshardt, acting as dramaturge. 
</P>
<P>
While slick packaging can momentarily sway judgment, ultimately the salient 
truth here is that Brecht has survived when myriad agitprop playwrights have 
fallen into obscurity. The reason is that Brecht at his worst still has enough 
vestiges of artistic genius to cast a powerful spell. 
</P>

<P>
The Berlin Wall wasn't the only famous wall to go away lately. Music fans 
mourned the passing of those eclectic L.A. rockers Wall of Voodoo, who played 
their final gig last year, capping a career that spanned 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
But those same fans will be happy to know that WOV's final frontman, Andy 
Prieboy, is alive and well in Los Angeles. He has a new album on Orange 
County's Dr. Dream Records, "Upon My Wicked Son," and also a video on MTV, 
"Tomorrow Wendy." 
</P>
<P>
Although Prieboy's music isn't quite as weird as Wall of Voodoo, it's close. 
Evoking a number of quirky styles, Prieboy's music would be difficult to cover, 
let alone describe. He's this week's Happening Solo Performer. A keyboard 
player, Prieboy will open for another serious singer-songwriter, Peter Case, at 
The Pub on the campus of UC Santa Barbara on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Prieboy discussed his life and times in a recent telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
How's the record doing? 
</P>
<P>
The record is doing really well -- actually astoundingly well. The first 
printing sold out. 
</P>
<P>
How often do you play? 
</P>
<P>
Well, I sort of take it as it comes. I was supposed to do this extensive tour 
with Concrete Blond, but immigration wouldn't let their drummer into the 
country -- he's British. I hope to tour with them sometime next year. Right 
now, I'll be touring with Peter Case through November. Then I'll start work on 
my next record. I'm always writing. 
</P>
<P>
Do you have a band or will you be doing the solo thing? 
</P>
<P>
It'll be a solo show -- just Andy, his piano and his cigarettes. I'm planning 
on having a band next year, but not now. 
</P>
<P>
What happened to Wall of Voodoo? 
</P>
<P>
Well, I think the older members just got tired of it. They moved to Europe. 
They just got fed up with record companies and the music business in general. I 
was in the band for five years, but they were in the band for 10 years. We're 
still friends and everything -- we're not officially broken up -- it's just 
sort of a hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
Will you do any Wall of Voodoo songs? 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, I do. The show I do is never planned -- I never know what I'm going to do 
next. I love living by my wits. 
</P>
<P>
How did you get started in the music biz? 
</P>
<P>
I couldn't get a job at an auto parts store. Music became an addiction for me, 
and one day, I was hooked. You just wake up one day, and you're a musician. 
Right now, I have free access to two recording studios, so life is good. 
</P>
<P>
Who are some of your musical influences? 
</P>
<P>
My ultimate coolest musical influence is my collection of old 78s. It's 
pre-World War I stuff, mostly Slavic -- Polish, Czech and like that. I'm a 
Czech, so I can relate to it -- it's great, out-of-time, out-of-tune and it 
really made an impression on my still pliable 10-year-old brain. In fact, the 
beginning to "Joliet" on the album, is this really old 78 from my collection. I 
really love all the scratches on the song. 
</P>
<P>
You have a video on MTV now -- do you think you'll end up with half of Bon 
Jovi's money? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, I want half of Bon Jovi's money and I'm also having his baby. Actually, 
the bottom line is that Dr. Dream has allowed me total creative freedom. That's 
a lifelong goal, to have freedom and still be allowed to function within the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow Wendy" sounds like the Beach Boys' "Wendy" gone to hell. What's the 
song about? 
</P>
<P>
It's about a prostitute from my hometown of Gary, Ind., who gets AIDS and 
committed suicide. True story. It's also about the death of a city in the 
Industrial Age. Places like Gary and Pittsburgh were once the backbones of 
America, and now it's like the Depression all over again. People have lost 
their homes -- it's the end of a way of life. And there's lots of Wendys out 
there. 
</P>
<P>
You cover a classic Canned Heat rocker, "On the Road Again," that comes out 
much differently than their version. Why that particular song? 
</P>
<P>
I like doing covers. It's like a signpost, or a guiding light or something. I 
felt Canned Heat's version was very unsettling, sort of a fever dream on a 45. 
The song just happened to coincide with events in my life, like ending a 
six-year relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Your song "That Was the Voice" is an anti-gay bashing song. Any story behind 
that one? 
</P>
<P>
Yeah. Two guys attacked me in Silver Lake with baseball bats. I had gotten into 
an argument with my girlfriend and felt like taking a walk. These two guys 
couldn't have seen me for more than 10 seconds before they attacked me. As it 
turned out, there is a gay bar right up the street. It was like the spirit of 
Adolf Hitler was beating me. What do you call someone who goes out to have a 
good time and takes a baseball bat? During the whole thing, I could hear their 
girlfriends laughing. Someone called the cops but they never came. 
</P>
<P>
Does bad love make for good songs? 
</P>
<P>
That's something I've been wondering about lately. 
</P>
<P>
What's the best and worst thing about being a rock star? 
</P>
<P>
The best thing is freedom. The worst thing is the effect the scene has on those 
around you. I've never been married or had a child, but the women in my life 
have had to go through a real bumpy ride. When it gets bumpy, I seem to get 
bumped. 
</P>
<P>
What was your strangest gig? 
</P>
<P>
With Wall of Voodoo we played this communist festival in Italy in this castle 
that was 16 blocks long. Anyway, I came up wearing a Ronald Reagan mask, waving 
a communist flag. These guys tried to beat me up, then our keyboard player 
punched the wrong guy. Anyway, friendly autograph seekers finally saved us. 
</P>
<P>
What do you do for fun? 
</P>
<P>
Well, the other night, these three women and I, well never mind. . . . I paint. 
I read a lot -- I'm an avid history buff. Writing, touring and performing -- 
that's for me. I really don't have time for a hobby. 
</P>
<P>
What would be your dream gig? 
</P>
<P>
To open for Morey Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
What would be your nightmare gig? 
</P>
<P>
To have Morey Amsterdam open for me. 
</P>
<P>
Describe Andy Prieboy music. 
</P>
<P>
Very dense.

A LOCAL PHOTOGRAPHER HAS SELECTED 40 PHOTOS FOR A DISPLAY DEPICTING THE SANTA

Chris Gardner was one of the many media photographers in the nation to capture 
on film the six days of the Santa Barbara fire last June. 
</P>
<P>
"The fire was a tragedy to so many and obviously I wish it never occurred," 
Gardner said. "Yet it was very surreal, and terribly exciting, and it was 
beautiful in a way." 
</P>
<P>
Gardner, who lives in Santa Barbara and works for the Independent, a weekly 
newspaper, said he wanted to put all the images of the fire in one room. So he 
selected 40 photos from magazines and newspapers that show the tragedy, the 
excitement and the beauty of the fire. The prints, from photographers with the 
city's local newspapers and the Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles Daily News, 
Newsweek magazine, Time magazine and National Geographic will be on display at 
the Contemporary Art Forum now through Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Gardner's favorite photos include a man running down his driveway just 
as flames are about to engulf his house, and a couple embracing amid the rubble 
that was once their home. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a war scene without the bodies," Gardner said. "I will never forget it. 
I feel honored to have been there. And at the same time I feel ashamed because 
I sort of enjoyed it." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit is free. The gallery in the Paseo Nuevo shopping center is open 
Tuesday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. A reception for "Fire on Film" 
is scheduled from 5 to 7 p.m. Saturday. Call 966-5373. 
</P>
<P>
The fiery and soulful yet sweet sounds of the Mighty Diamonds will come to the 
Graduate nightclub in Isla Vista Saturday at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The reggae trio is known as much for gentle harmonies as the ability to bring 
an audience to its feet and into dance. 
</P>
<P>
The group formed in 1969 and has just released its 24th album, "Go Seek Your 
Rights." Past albums include "Ice On Fire" and "Changes," which featured the 
1982 hit "Pass the Kutchie." 
</P>
<P>
Tickets are $15, available at the Graduate, 685-3112, or charge by phone, 
966-1466. Doors open at 7 p.m. Spencer the Gardener is guest artist. 
</P>
<P>
The rise of the Black Panthers, the free-speech movement and the anti-war 
demonstrations of the late '60s and early '70s are some of the events that 
changed the course of American social and political life. 
</P>
<P>
Six years in the making, the documentary "Berkeley in the '60s" was completed 
this year. The production is an archival assemblage of raw footage from the 
mass marches, demonstrations and confrontations of the 1960s. Interspersed are 
recent interviews with 16 activists from that decade, including Black Panther 
co-founder Bobby Seale and free-speech movement leader Jackie Goldberg, now 
president of the Los Angeles Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
The film will be shown at the University of California's Campbell Hall at 8 
p.m. Sunday. Admission is $6. Director/producer Mark Kitchell will discuss the 
film after the screening. Call 893-3535. 
</P>
<P>
Also at UCSB's Campbell Hall, Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky will read from 
his works at 8 p.m. Tuesday. An English translation will be provided. Tickets 
are $6. Call 893-3535. 
</P>
<P>
Voznesensky, 57, is considered one of Russia's leading poets and many of his 
books have been published internationally. Among the titles published in the 
United States are "Nostalgia for the Present" (1979) and "An Arrow in the Wall" 
(1989). Voznesensky is also co-author of the rock opera "Yunon and Avos," which 
was a hit in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
The works of Santa Barbara painter and sculptor Harold Hall Bass, better known 
as "Skye," will be shown at the Green Dragon Art Studio and Espresso Bar, 22 W. 
Mission St., Saturday through Nov. 30 
</P>
<P>
Skye was diagnosed as having Parkinson's disease in 1979 when he was only 40, 
yet he continues to sculpt despite the often disabling effects of the disease. 
A free reception for the artist will be held Sunday at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Art/Life magazine is celebrating its 10th anniversary with seven simultaneous 
exhibits on three continents, one of which runs now through Dec. 15 in the 
Reynolds Gallery at Westmont College, 955 La Paz Road. The exhibit and 
reception, scheduled from 4 to 6 p.m. Dec. 1, are both free. Call 565-6000. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Cardella, who began the magazine in his Santa Barbara kitchen, selects 
200 works of art each month -- submitted from around the world -- for the 
magazine. Each issue, which costs $50 and includes silk-screens, prints, 
photographs, poetry, short stories and collages, is meant to reflect what's 
current in art. 
</P>
<P>
Shakespearean actor Patrick Stewart, best known as captain of the USS 
Enterprise in the television series "Star Trek: The Next Generation," will 
perform a solo dramatization of Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol." 
</P>

Tickets for the 8 p.m. Saturday presentation at UCSB's Campbell Hall are $12, 
$14 and $16. Call 893-3535.

The next time you find yourself searching for a desirable bottle of vino to 
complement that rack of lamb, may we suggest a nice locally produced Pinot 
Noir? You heard me right. But I said locally produced, not locally grown. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County's fertile soil may be just what a plethora of vegetables and 
fruits need, but it doesn't do it for the wine grape. That commodity, which 
supports the local wine industry, has to be imported from coastal California 
counties to the north. Part of the reason is that Ventura County's more arid 
temperatures do not produce a comparable wine grape -- and its loam is actually 
too fertile. 
</P>
<P>
"Wine grapes can be grown in marginal soil," said Brooks Painter, the winemaker 
for Leeward Winery in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"Farmers can do far better raising other, more prosperous crops." 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, local wineries look to San Luis Obispo, Monterey, Santa Clara and 
Santa Barbara counties for grape supplies. All of those counties offer grape 
varieties intended to accentuate taste differences. 
</P>
<P>
Painter said the variety of the grape, its production location and the climate, 
weather and the soil in which it is raised all play a pivotal role in 
determining the taste of the final product. 
</P>
<P>
Leeward Winery, Ventura County's largest, offers four types of wine. 
</P>
<P>
"Our specialty is a Chardonnay variety," Painter said. "It's by far our most 
popular wine." 
</P>
<P>
During the fermentation and aging process, Leeward Winery uses French oak 
barrels that provide its Chardonnay with flavorful embellishments such as a 
"vanilla and buttery flavor" with a "dry, tropical fruit pear and pineapple" 
side to it, Painter said. 
</P>
<P>
The 60-gallon French oak barrels -- at $600 apiece -- are made of hand-selected 
wood and last up to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The first six years they are used for our Chardonnay and the last four for red 
wines," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Leeward Winery produces an average of 15,000 cases a year. It also offers the 
following red wines: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir and the blush 
variety Coral. 
</P>
<P>
So what are the guidelines when serving wine with dinner entrees? 
</P>
<P>
"The general rule through the years was to serve white wines with white meats 
and red with red meat," Painter said, "but that doesn't necessarily need to be 
adhered to." Dishes such as pastas with white sauce, linguine and clams, 
chicken and fish can be served with the versatile, full-flavored Chardonnay, 
Painter said. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally like it with grilled swordfish and with lighter meats like pork 
tenderloins," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Leeward's newest release, the Pinot Noir, is a "wonderful perfumed variety, 
smooth, and is excellent with baked salmon and lamb." 
</P>
<P>
Leeward Winery, in existence since 1979, is located at 2784 Johnson Drive, 
Ventura. Tours and wine tasting are available seven days a week from 10 a.m. to 
4 p.m. Call 656-5054. 
</P>
<P>
Wine enthusiasts can check out what area wineries have to offer at this 
weekend's Olivas Rancho Winefest. From 1 to 4 p.m. Sunday at the Olivas Adobe 
Historical Park, 4200 Olivas Park Drive, Ventura, 12 vintners from Santa 
Barbara and Ventura counties will showcase their select wines. Proceeds will 
benefit restoration of the site. The four Ventura County wineries will be in 
attendance: Leeward Winery, the Ojai Vineyard (Oak View), Old Creek Ranch &amp; 
Winery (Oak View) and the Rolling Hills Winery (Camarillo). 
</P>
<P>
The afternoon includes live bluegrass music entertainment, and participants 
will receive a commemorative wineglass. Hors d'oeuvres, fresh breads and 
cheeses will also be available. 
</P>
<P>

TORRES JOINS RACE FOR SUPERVISOR; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: HE SAYS THAT CONCERNS ABOUT SPLITTING THE LATINO VOTE IN THE NEW 1ST 
DISTRICT ARE UNFOUNDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Sen. Art Torres joined an increasingly crowded field of Latino candidates 
in the 1st Supervisorial District on Wednesday, and he said that any concern 
about splitting the vote and creating an opening for non-Latino candidates is 
unfounded and unfair. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not a monolithic community," the East Los Angeles Democrat said. "We 
don't apply consensus to candidates in the other communities throughout Los 
Angeles. So I don't think that standard ought to be applied to us. I think our 
community is educated and smart enough to be confronted with different 
choices." 
</P>
<P>
The field for the Jan. 22 election at present includes Torres, City 
Councilwoman Gloria Molina and Sarah Flores, a former aide to retiring 
incumbent Pete Schabarum. U.S. Rep. Matthew Martinez (D-Monterey Park) also has 
announced his intention to run for the seat, and several lesser-known hopefuls 
also have expressed interest in running. 
</P>
<P>
The election was called by U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon, who previously 
had found that the county discriminated against Latinos systematically over the 
decades in drawing district lines. A new 1st District was created with the 
intention of providing Latinos with an opportunity to win election to the 
five-member board. 
</P>
<P>
So far, no established non-Latino candidates have expressed interest in the 
seat, but some Latino politicians are worried that the abundance of Latino 
candidates might divide and weaken the Latino vote, allowing a non-Latino 
candidate to win. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, there is that danger," said Molina, who unsuccessfully sought to become 
the consensus Democratic candidate from the Latino community. Flores, the lone 
prominent Republican candidate in the nonpartisan race, said she could be 
helped if the Democratic politicians split the Democratic vote. 
</P>
<P>
A number of political analysts found it unlikely a non-Latino could win the 
seat, especially since a candidate must capture more than 50% of the Jan. 22 
vote to avoid a later runoff between the two top vote-gatherers. They said the 
Latino community is geared up to deliver one of their own to the now 
conservative board. The political numbers also weigh heavily on the side of a 
Latino candidate. Latinos account for 51% of the voters and 71% of the 
population. 
</P>
<P>
"The days of Art Snyder are over," said Joe Sanchez, a Latino political 
fund-raiser. He was referring to the former councilman who repeatedly withstood 
Latino challenges in a heavily Latino district. "This time we are very 
organized." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Cain, associate director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at UC 
Berkeley, agreed, adding: "Even if they split the vote, it means that all that 
has to happen is that one of them makes it in the top two. 
</P>
<P>
"The top vote-getting Latino can count on the support consolidating for the 
general election," added Cain, who served as a redistricting consultant to the 
U.S. Justice Department in the voting rights case. "It should work out OK. The 
one danger is we may start to see some of the underlying divisions of opinion 
if the campaign gets bitter. That might lead to a low turnout or lack of unity 
for the general election." 
</P>
<P>
Cain, also citing a political lesson from Snyder's tenure, pointed out that the 
new 1st Supervisorial District does not contain heavily Anglo enclaves like 
Eagle Rock, where large numbers of Anglo voters swung City Council elections in 
Snyder's favor. Councilman Richard Alatorre, a Latino, finally won election to 
the council after Snyder resigned. 
</P>
<P>
In the short, 10-week campaign, only a big name has a chance, Cain said. 
</P>
<P>
"That is going to work for the advantage of these well-known Latino 
politicians," the political scientist said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodolfo Acuna, professor of Chicano studies at Cal State Northridge, said: "The 
worst that is going to happen is a brown-white runoff, and then it is up to all 
of us to support the Latino candidate." 
</P>
<P>
Acuna, like some other Latino political experts, bridled at any suggestion that 
too many Latinos were vying for the office. 
</P>
<P>
"When a lot of Anglo-Americans run, they call it democracy," Acuna said. "When 
we run more than one for office, they call it factionalism." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Carmen Perez, an aide to Supervisor Kenneth Hahn and a national vice 
chair of the Democratic Party, said: "The fact of the matter is that this 
community has been hungry and waiting for this. . . . If there were 10 white 
males running, they would all probably be told they are civic minded. You get 
10 Latinos and they're told they are diluting the vote. That's not so." 
</P>
<P>
Hahn was expected to announce today his support of Torres. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing his candidacy at his alma mater, Montebello High School, Torres 
sought immediately to defuse possible political fallout from his 1987 and 1989 
arrests for drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a man who has made mistakes in the past," he said. "I am a man who has 
grown and confronted those mistakes. I believe they have made me a stronger 
individual." Torres last year completed a 25-day treatment program for 
alcoholics. 
</P>
<P>
Molina was an aide to Torres when he was an assemblyman. But they grew apart 
after he backed her opponent in the 1987 council race. 
</P>
<P>
There were early signs the race might prove lively as the candidates stated 
their working ground rules for negative campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to attack my opponents," Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
Molina said she would only attack Flores. 
</P>
<P>
Flores said she would attack both Torres and Molina, and she did, calling them 
"East Los Angeles political bosses" -- a reference to the failed attempt by the 
two Democrats and others to deliver a consensus candidate to run against her. 
</P>
<P>
As Torres held his press conference, a few students held up placards reading 
"Unity is strength" and "Why split our vote?" 
</P>
<P>
Paulina Gonzalez, a high school senior, asked Torres if he was not concerned 
about splitting the vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the people have a right to choose between candidates," he said.

IT'S AN ILL WIND BLOWING FOR SMOKERS, HUDDLED IN CORNERS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: THE GREAT AMERICAN SMOKEOUT HAS HELPED TO BANISH THEM FROM THE 
MAINSTREAM, MAKE THEM THE PARIAHS OF THE '90S. 
</P>

<P>
For former Monterey Park Mayor Pat Reichenberger, the craving hit about every 
two hours during long, tedious City Hall meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Residents packed the council chambers, speakers roared at the podium, decisions 
had to be made. But every two hours, a single thought pounded her brain: 
"Cigarette." 
</P>
<P>
With no smoking allowed in council chambers, there was only one way out. 
Reichenberger would intone to the packed assembly hall: "At this time, a break 
has been requested." 
</P>
<P>
"It was my decision so I decided I could have a cigarette," Reichenberger now 
ashamedly admits. "You have to lie a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
These are tough days for smokers -- and today is one of the worst, when smokers 
feel even more besieged than usual. It's the 14th annual Great American 
Smokeout, an event designed to bring the country closer to the U.S. surgeon 
general's goal of a smokeless society by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to ignore it," Reichenberger said. 
</P>
<P>
By their own estimation, smokers have become the pariahs of the '90s. Scorned, 
hounded and reviled, they have been banished to dingy smoking rooms, reeking 
bathrooms and butt-littered street corners. 
</P>
<P>
"You're more socially acceptable if you're a heroin addict," complained Patty 
Prickett, an avowed environmentalist who eats only organic food, but still 
smokes a couple of packs a day. 
</P>
<P>
Katie Row, spokeswoman for the American Cancer Society's Central Los Angeles 
Chapter, agreed that for some nonsmokers, smoking has dropped below drug 
addiction on the vice scale. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like drinkers drinking or drug users using drugs," she said. "When 
people smoke, they injure the people around them." 
</P>
<P>
Although the numbers of smokers is dwindling (less than 30% of the adult 
population), for those who continue the habit, life has become an increasingly 
difficult job of finding new ways to keep puffing. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to learn to be cunning," Reichenberger said. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Forren, a Lompoc resident with a two-pack-a-day habit, said the days of 
indignant smokers righteously battling any infringement of their right to puff 
in public are over. 
</P>
<P>
He has adopted a strategy of adaptation to the new virulent climate. "Things 
are getting rough out there, even at home," he said with a sense of 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Forren said he asks now if he can smoke whenever he goes to someone else's 
house. He usually sits in the nonsmoking sections of restaurants to accommodate 
his family. For the last few years he has accepted banishment to the patio 
whenever he wants a cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God I don't live someplace like Montana," he said, envisioning himself 
buried by a blizzard on his front porch. 
</P>
<P>
The outcry against smoking has reached the point where some simply prefer 
hiding their habit. 
</P>
<P>
Spouses smoke at work, but gargle before returning home. Dates avoid the 
subject. Dick Russell, a free-lance environmental writer, attended a conference 
on chemical sensitivity recently and put his cigarette in his jacket before 
entering the room. 
</P>
<P>
"You get a little paranoid of people looking at you doing this awful thing," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Most smokers agree that the social stigma against smoking has reached fever 
pitch in just the last decade. Medical evidence has been mounting against them 
since 1964 when the U.S. surgeon general linked smoking with lung cancer, but 
the anti-smoking frenzy has escalated since 1986, when the surgeon general 
detailed the unhealthy effects of second-hand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
The irony of the smoking debate is that many, if not the majority of smokers, 
agree that it is an unhealthful addiction for themselves and others. 
</P>
<P>
"At some point you have to admit that all this evidence is undeniable," said 
John Wasielewski, district representative for Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los 
Angeles) and an avid smoker. "We all keep waiting for the 100-year-old guy 
whose secret is smoking three packs a day and drinking, but it isn't going to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
Local ordinances against smoking in public places and reports of travelers 
being hauled off to jail for smoking on flights haven't helped the smoker's 
image much either. 
</P>
<P>
"At least we're not crack addicts," said the health conscious smoker Prickett, 
who spent much of this year railing against the state for spraying malathion. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, said Prickett, is that most nonsmokers see smoking not as a 
powerful physical addiction, but rather as a disgusting and obnoxious habit 
akin to spitting in public. 
</P>
<P>
Prickett has tried to stop smoking at least six times. She tried quitting all 
at once, then gradually. She tried hiding cigarettes and putting scary 
anti-smoking articles on her walls. 
</P>
<P>
She tried aversion therapy, in which you smoke until you're sick. She enjoyed 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest part is defending something you don't feel great about," she said. 
"I'm not proud of smoking. I'm a real addict." 
</P>
<P>
But with the rising tide of outrage against smoking, a backlash has begun to 
build from smokers. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Van Heusen of Bellflower has a T-shirt warning passersby that to 
"hassle" him for smoking "could be hazardous to your health." 
</P>
<P>
"I tell people to mind their own business," he said as he savored a cigarette 
in front of the county Criminal Courts Building during a break from jury duty. 
</P>
<P>
George Follman, vice president of a hang glider and wind surfing company in 
Newport Beach and a smoker for 20 years, agreed that the attacks against 
smoking have gone too far. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gotten real bad," he said. "I can't even feel comfortable smoking in a 
smoking area." 
</P>
<P>
He was infuriated by the smoking ban on flights in the continental United 
States. "If they ban smoking on international flights, I'll quit flying." 
</P>
<P>
Follman, who used to smoke while hang gliding by putting his craft into a stall 
just long enough to light a cigarette, said he actually quit once 10 years ago, 
but was brought back into the fold by a near-death experience. 
</P>
<P>
It happened in 1981 on the Japanese island of Kyushu where he was planning to 
demonstrate a new model ultralight airplane. 
</P>
<P>
He launched off a peak in 30 m.p.h. winds and knew right away it was a bad 
idea. His craft was tossed out of control. He was blown over the jungle, over 
the ocean, past a web of high-power wires. The craft's gas pedal broke off. 
Follman prepared for death. 
</P>
<P>
He struggled to regain control of the plane and managed to crash-land in a rice 
paddy, leaving his plane a wreck. He was dazed, but unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
When his rescuers arrived, the first thing he did was reach for a pack of 
Japanese cigarettes dangling out of a rescuer's pocket. "I sucked that one 
down," he said. He has been smoking ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Any special plans for the Great American Smokeout? 
</P>
<P>
"I intend to smoke my brains out," he said. 
</P>

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITIES WANT TO DRAW UP OWN REDISTRICTING 
PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dissatisfied with the political splintering of the San Gabriel Valley under a 
court-sanctioned redistricting plan for the county Board of Supervisors, 
several cities are collecting money to hire experts to draw up their own plan. 
</P>
<P>
The San Gabriel Valley Assn. of Cities wants to place most of the area in one 
supervisorial district, and to enlarge the board from five members to seven. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed redrawn lines would be submitted to the Board of Supervisors next 
year for consideration during reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two cities have been asked to contribute $500 each to hire National 
Demographics Corp. of Claremont -- at a total cost of $22,500 -- to draw 
proposed supervisorial boundaries using 1990 census data. Donations also are 
being solicited from a number of corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Cities that have agreed to contribute include Alhambra, Arcadia, Azusa, 
Glendora, La Puente and San Dimas.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AIR DEFENSE CHIEF SEES VICTORY IN EVENT OF 
WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gen. Donald J. Kutyna, commander of the North American Air Defense and the 
United States Space Command, said Wednesday that in the event of a war with 
Iraq, U.S. air forces will dominate the skies but refused to predict how 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is assured, but we've got very capable forces," Kutyna said after 
addressing the Pasadena Rotary Club. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't make a call on how soon . . . but I think our forces will prevail." 
</P>
<P>
Kutyna also said that the rapprochement with the Soviet Union does not rule out 
the need for greater defense capabilities in space, in particular the so-called 
Star Wars system. The Soviets continue to build strategic weapons to maintain 
their world power status, he said, and "you've got to keep a deterrent." 
</P>
<P>
Other countries still hostile to the United States, such as Libya, are also 
developing missiles that can reach the United States, he said.

NURSING YOUNG AMBITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly two dozen fifth- and sixth-graders from Los Feliz Elementary School got 
a chance to act the part of surgical nurses at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center 
in Hollywood Wednesday during the hospital's observance of National Operating 
Room Nurse Day. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in surgical "scrubs," they washed their hands and arms in antiseptic 
solution and then were taken on a tour of the surgical wing. They were even 
given a peek at a minor surgery in progress, said Kaiser Permanente spokeswoman 
Linda Quon. The tour was meant to be fun, but it also had serious purposes -- 
to encourage youngsters to consider nursing as a career.

"Wake up, mama." The cry jolted Alice Rhodes from a restless sleep July 22. 
There was pounding on the door of her Pasadena apartment. Jimmy's been shot in 
the head, her daughter-in-law screamed. 
</P>
<P>
Rhodes, 45, who comes from a family of Pentecostal ministers, rushed to the 
emergency room of Huntington Memorial Hospital. By the time the doctors allowed 
her to see her youngest child, 22-year-old Jimmy Wilburn was dead. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how to explain it . . . how I feel on the inside," Rhodes said. 
"A very dear life was taken from me. That life came from my body. He was my 
friend, my son, my baby." 
</P>
<P>
Three days later, Sherry Peterson, 48, a tall, stoic woman who works as a 
paralegal, called the Pasadena Police Department. She had heard that officers 
were circulating a photo of her son as a suspect in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Convinced there had been an error, she invited police to her small rented home 
in Monrovia to clear up any misunderstanding. The next morning, three 
plainclothes homicide detectives arrived with an arrest warrant and, at 
gunpoint, dragged 21-year-old Michael Peterson away. 
</P>
<P>
Although Peterson could face a life sentence if convicted -- the trial is 
tentatively scheduled to begin Monday (in Pasadena Superior Court -- his mother 
is convinced he will come home. 
</P>
<P>
"You go to sleep thinking about it, and you wake up thinking about it. I 
imagine it's much like what the mother of Jimmy Wilburn is going through," 
Peterson said. "I'm sure it would make her furious to hear that. But it's 
totally devastating when you know he's innocent and nobody believes you." 
</P>
<P>
Women like Alice Rhodes and Sherry Peterson do not show up in the statistics 
that chronicle the rising tide of violence in many of Los Angeles County's 
low-income communities. But they are part of the trail of victims. 
</P>
<P>
Each tells a similar story of hope, sacrifice and regret. Rhodes and Peterson 
both came to California in search of a better life. Each struggled to raise her 
children in Pasadena without the help of a father at home. 
</P>
<P>
The 9-millimeter bullet that brought them together was fired with the kind of 
indiscriminate fury that has become a daily occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Wilburn was sitting with friends on Del Monte Street at 3:20 a.m., 
waiting for a ride home. His mother said he liked to go there to play dominoes. 
Officers said he was at a gang hangout where members of a Bloods sect gathered. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Peterson, according to the police report, had a reputation on the 
streets for shooting Bloods. His mother said her son was home asleep that 
night. Peterson, on his lawyer's orders, says nothing. Officers said he was 
seen in a blue Nissan Maxima holding his thumb and index finger in the shape of 
a "C," the sign for the rival Crips gang. 
</P>
<P>
As the car cruised past, four or five shots exploded from the driver's side. 
Everybody, except Wilburn, scrambled for cover. One of the bullets lodged in 
Wilburn's brain. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives give only the standard police line that both victim and suspect were 
"associated" with local street gangs. "They don't carry membership cards," said 
Sgt. Monte Yancey. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Rhodes and Sherry Peterson said their children knew members of gangs, but 
never joined. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy was a black boy in a black neighborhood with black friends, but that 
doesn't make him in no gang," Rhodes said. "It certainly doesn't mean he 
deserved to be killed in that way." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said: "When you grow up in Pasadena and you're black, you know kids 
who end up being gang members. You go to school with them and you play football 
with them. Michael didn't stop being friends with them just because they were 
in a gang. But that doesn't make him a gang member." 
</P>
<P>
In Pasadena Superior Court last month, while lawyers argued pretrial motions, 
Sherry Peterson and Alice Rhodes sat in the hallway, barely noting each other's 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to stay away from her," said Peterson, dressed in a stylish purple 
pantsuit, her gray-streaked hair carefully coiffed. "She gets out of control, 
crying and yelling and screaming at me about how my son killed her son. . . . I 
come from a family where you cry into a bath towel before you let anyone see 
your tears." 
</P>
<P>
Rhodes, wearing a bright floral blouse and green skirt, stared nervously out 
the sixth-floor window. 
</P>
<P>
"She's so cool," Rhodes said. "So professional. I guess I am emotional. But I'm 
not trying to act no way. Sometimes I just cry."

RTD DRIVER KILLED FALLEN MOTORCYCLIST, POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
An RTD bus driver who allegedly ran over and killed a fallen motorcycle rider 
in Canoga Park and then continued on her route was arrested on suspicion of 
manslaughter Wednesday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Teresa LaBarba, 35, of Canoga Park, could also face a felony hit-and-run charge 
when evidence from the accident is presented to prosecutors, Traffic Officer 
Gary Weller said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said LaBarba was driving her bus south on Topanga Canyon Boulevard about 
10 a.m. when it ran over Eric Edwards, 20, of Chatsworth, and crushed him. 
Moments earlier, Edwards had fallen off his motorcycle when he lost control of 
it near the intersection of Sherman Way. 
</P>
<P>
"The motorcyclist crashed and the bus driver ran over him," Weller said. "She 
never touched the motorcycle. Then the bus took off." 
</P>
<P>
Police said five passengers were on the bus and it was unclear whether they saw 
the accident or told LaBarba to stop. Detectives were attempting to locate them 
for interviews Wednesday night. One of the passengers who was contacted told 
police he did not see or feel the accident, Detective Wayne Dufort said. 
</P>
<P>
Weller said it was initially unclear who had hit Edwards until witnesses told 
investigators it was an RTD bus. The RTD was then contacted and LaBarba, who 
was known to be driving a route in the area, was ordered by radio to return to 
the accident scene, Weller said. 
</P>
<P>
LaBarba, an RTD driver for seven years, told investigators that when she 
noticed the motorcycle in the street behind her, she radioed RTD supervisors to 
report that there had been an accident but that it did not involve her. She 
then continued on her route. 
</P>
<P>
"She is claiming she didn't know she hit him," Weller said. 
</P>
<P>
However, police said two witnesses who were not on the bus said they saw the 
vehicle bounce as the front and rear tires struck Edwards.

JIM MURRAY: NORMAN KEEPS ON STORMIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For golf, it was the worst news since the word came Hogan couldn't putt any 
more, Palmer was turning gray and Nicklaus was building courses instead of 
dismantling them with a one-iron. 
</P>
<P>
Golf is a game that doesn't need square grooves, courses with railroad ties all 
over them or even trick games made for television. Golf needs stars. Without 
them, the game is headed for the deep rough. 
</P>
<P>
That's why the game was ready for smelling salts at the published report that 
Greg Norman -- Greg Norman! -- was going to have to quit tournament golf. For 
the game, it had all the dismaying effect of a ball in the water on the 72nd 
hole of the Open. Golf's gonzos from Deane Beman to the heads of networks and 
cable operators gazed at the report with all the horror of a guy who just found 
a rattlesnake in his hip pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Golf can ill afford to lose a player of Norman's magnetism. He has what 
Hollywood used to call "star quality." No one ever looked out at a golf course 
and said, "Which one's that?" when Greg Norman went by. You may not be able to 
tell David Peoples from Peter Persons, may get mixed up between Ken Green and 
Billy Ray Brown or not know whether it's Dan Pohl or Don Pooley, but no one 
ever mixed up the Great White Shark with the minnows. 
</P>
<P>
Charisma comes in many forms. Ben Hogan had it in the sheer relentless drive -- 
a grim, dogged pursuit of perfection, stalking the game of golf as if it were a 
dangerous animal he had to bring to bay. You got goose pimples when Hogan came 
down a fairway a shot behind and the ball sitting prettily where it usually 
sat, in the exact center of a par-five fairway. 
</P>
<P>
The young Arnold Palmer was as exciting as Cagney with a machine gun in a gang 
war. Arnold brawled with the golf course. Arnold made a two or a 12 with the 
same reckless, go-for-it fervor of a guy jumping through a skylight. Jack 
Nicklaus treated a golf course with the disdain normally reserved for your 
inferiors. He taught it its place. 
</P>
<P>
Norman is as exciting on a golf course as Dempsey with his man on the ropes or 
Joe Montana with a man open in the end zone. There's no defense to his game. 
Like Palmer in his prime, he goes for a two. He's never tried to par a hole in 
his life. He never hits the safe shot. A case in point was this year's British 
Open. Norman, trailing the eventual winner, Nick Faldo, by two shots came up to 
the 12th hole in the third round. Faldo slapped his drive over in the deep 
gorse. He looked like a double-bogey, at least. Norman's play, then, was to hit 
a nice conservative bunt out into the fairway, make his sure par and, perhaps, 
tie up the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
Not our Greg. The Shark reared back, took his full 360-degree slide into the 
ball -- and knocked it way out into the ozone and into a fairway trap. The last 
place he wanted to be. He dissipated his advantage -- and his opportunity to 
win the Open. A longtime Norman-watcher in the press room sighed. "God couldn't 
have reached down and gotten Greg to swing easy," he admitted. "Not even if He 
grabbed the club." 
</P>
<P>
This sort of derring-do is good for a game in which the goal seems to be to 
amass money, not victories. But Norman plays for twos, not seconds. 
</P>
<P>
So, when the British news service this week reported that Norman was thinking 
of calling it a career because of a wrist injury, golf needed smelling salts. 
</P>
<P>
Norman has a wrist injury, all right. The facts are, he's had it since he was a 
teen-age rugby player in Australia. He's played with it all his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I aggravated it when I hit a rock at the 10th hole on the second round at the 
Open in Brookline in '88," Norman recalled as he stood on a practice tee at 
Sherwood Country Club the other afternoon, getting ready for his annual Ronald 
McDonald Children's Charities tournament, an event that pits the 20 of the most 
celebrated players in the game against each other in team competition. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost every golf shot I've ever hit, I feel pain," he admitted. "I had a bone 
scan and a CAT scan. The cartilage and ligaments were torn, and I'm always 
going to have it. There's some arthritic growth and scar tissue, but there's 
nothing operable that will help. 
</P>
<P>
"But I have no intention of quitting golf." 
</P>
<P>
It's something you learn to live with. You and I live with a slice or a 
spasmodic putting stroke. Norman lives with a wrist throb at impact. 
</P>
<P>
Norman has won nine tournaments on the American tour and 58 others around the 
world, including the 1986 British Open and every tournament of note on the 
Pacific Rim. 
</P>
<P>
But Norman is almost as famous for the tournaments he didn't win. He lost the 
1986 PGA when Bob Tway chipped in -- out of a sand trap -- over his head on the 
final hole at Inverness. He lost the 1987 Masters when Larry Mize chipped in 
over his head on the second playoff hole. He lost the 1984 U.S. Open in a 
playoff to Fuzzy Zoeller. He lost the 1989 British Open in a playoff to Mark 
Calcavecchia. He's good. Just don't call him Lucky. 
</P>
<P>
Only a Greg Norman of today's tour players could bring off a Ronald McDonald 
tournament where 80 selected sponsor-players pay $20,000 to the charity for the 
privilege of playing two rounds with the world's greatest 20 golfers. No other 
player today rates that kind of identification. 
</P>
<P>
His tournament is a mixed bag of team play with the legendary likes of Jack 
Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Raymond Floyd, Hale Irwin and Chi Chi Rodriguez 
trading scrambles and best balls against the more contemporary opponents such 
as Curtis Strange, Mark O'Meara, Mark Calcavecchia, Wayne Levi, Ian 
Baker-Finch, Ben Crenshaw and Lanny Wadkins. 
</P>
<P>
You can see why the game hopes the Shark continues to play with pain for years 
to come. Besides, it evens the odds a bit for the rest of the field.

UCLA VS. USC / SATURDAY, AT ROSE BOWL; 
</P>
<P>
USC'S CONTROVERSIAL CATCHES CORNER UCLA AGONY MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Eric Turner reasons that USC owes UCLA 14 points. Bruin fans would say that's 
merely a down payment for all the points supposedly stolen by the Trojans over 
the years. 
</P>
<P>
Turner, UCLA's free safety, was referring to controversial touchdowns scored by 
the Trojans in the 1987 and '89 games at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there have been more controversial plays in the series that began in 
1929. 
</P>
<P>
The recent plays in question were scoring catches by Erik Affholter and Gary 
Wellman. They were similar inasmuch as they occurred in the right corner of the 
end zone at the peristyle end of the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Affholter's catch in 1987 was more meaningful because it provided the Trojans 
with a 17-13 upset victory and a berth in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the fourth quarter, Rodney Peete threw a 33-yard pass that 
Affholter juggled in the end zone. It was ruled that he had possession long 
enough, depriving the Bruins of an opportunity to play in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"I just saw the ball at the last minute and pulled it down," Affholter said, 
pulling the Bruins down with him. 
</P>
<P>
The circumstances weren't as dramatic last year. USC had already clinched the 
Rose Bowl bid, and UCLA (3-7) was struggling. 
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, Todd Marinovich threw a 13-yard pass to Wellman, who made 
the catch while barely staying in bounds in the end zone. Or was he? 
</P>
<P>
Turner and other Bruins contend that although Wellman made a great catch, he 
was out of bounds. The Times ran a photo later that seemed to show Wellman made 
a legal catch. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins never bought it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good catch, but not a touchdown," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
The game ended in a 10-10 tie when a 54-yard field-goal try by UCLA's Alfredo 
Velasco hit the crossbar and bounced back. 
</P>
<P>
The Coliseum corners have been cruel to the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
In 1969, in the gathering gloom of late afternoon, USC's Sam Dickerson caught a 
32-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Jimmy Jones with 1 1/2 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Dickerson caught the ball in the right corner of the end zone at the closed end 
of the Coliseum to give USC a 14-12 victory with the Rose Bowl on the line for 
both teams. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Trojans wouldn't have been in position to score the winning 
touchdown if not for a fourth-down pass interference penalty, called against 
Danny Graham (covering Dickerson), that gave USC a first down at the UCLA 
32-yard line. Jones' pass was overthrown, but Graham didn't know it at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I had made a good play, but I had slipped and didn't see Jones throw 
the ball," Graham said. "I didn't know if the pass was thrown badly or not. 
</P>
<P>
"I hoped to get my hands on Dickerson as he got his hands on the ball. But when 
I looked up, an official had thrown his flag." 
</P>
<P>
That the ball was uncatchable was not a consideration for an official at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Another pass interference penalty against UCLA in 1977 caused Coach Terry 
Donahue such anguish that he smashed his hand against a locker after the game. 
</P>
<P>
USC already had been eliminated from the Rose Bowl race, but UCLA was due to be 
invited if it beat the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed the Bruins were on the verge of that, leading, 27-26, in the final 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans were trying to get into field-goal range, but time was running out. 
</P>
<P>
On third and 10 from midfield, USC quarterback Rob Hertel threw a pass intended 
for Kevin Williams. It was incomplete, but UCLA defensive back Johnny Lynn was 
cited for pass interference, giving USC a first down at the Bruin 40-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Hertel threw a 17-yard pass to Randy Simmrin to get into field-goal range. 
Frank Jordan kicked a 38-yard field goal with two seconds remaining to knock 
the Bruins out of the Rose Bowl and put Washington in. 
</P>
<P>
Although fate has felled the Bruins several times in their rivalry with USC, 
they benefited from a pass interference penalty in the 1959 game. 
</P>
<P>
USC was unbeaten at the time and ranked No. 2 nationally. It seemed that the 
game might end in a 3-3 tie when UCLA quarterback Bill Kilmer threw a pass that 
was intercepted by USC's Willie Wood at the Trojan seven-yard line in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But USC's Jerry Traynham was called for pass interference, giving UCLA the ball 
at the seven. Three plays later, UCLA's Ray Smith scored, spoiling an unbeaten 
season for the Trojans and sending the Bruins to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans claimed that the official who made the call was upfield and not in 
position to make such a decision. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most significant game of the series was played in 1952. Not only 
were the teams playing for a Rose Bowl berth, as they have so many times, they 
were both undefeated and untied. 
</P>
<P>
That was a first in the series and hasn't been matched since. 
</P>
<P>
USC won, 14-12, when Trojan guard Elmer Willhoite intercepted a pass thrown by 
Paul Cameron and returned it 72 yards to the UCLA eight-yard line in the second 
half, setting up the winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, an unlikely play was the difference. 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, USC wingback Al Carmichael was apparently stopped on a 
reverse. However, as he was going down, he threw a lateral to tailback Jim 
Sears, who ran 75 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin fans contend to this day that Carmichael threw a forward, illegal lateral 
to Sears. 
</P>
<P>
Some games may be difficult to recall now, but disputed plays have a life of 
their own.

STEVENS HURT IN 5-HORSE SPILL; 
</P>
<P>
HOLLYWOOD PARK: NATION'S TOP MONEY-WINNING JOCKEY SUFFERS BROKEN ELBOW AFTER 
MOUNT GOES DOWN. HE WILL BE SIDELINED THREE TO FOUR WEEKS.

<P>
Gary Stevens broke his right elbow and four other jockeys escaped serious 
injury in a horrifying five-horse spill during the first race Wednesday at 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's top money-winning rider in 1990, Stevens is expected to be out of 
racing for three to four weeks, according to Dr. Robert Kerlan. Stevens was 
thrown when his mount, Rotation Speed, broke down while battling for the lead 
on the far turn. 
</P>
<P>
This caused a chain reaction because most of the 11 other 3-year-old fillies in 
the $16,000 claiming race at six furlongs were behind Stevens. Akrotiri, ridden 
by James Corral, tripped over the fallen Rotation Speed; and, Corey Nakatani on 
Zone Of Danger; Armando Bellido on Madame Lil, and Kent Desormeaux on Davy's 
Squaw, also went down. 
</P>
<P>
Davy's Squaw was actually the first to brush Rotation Speed while swerving to 
avoid the accident, and Desormeaux was able to stay on his mount for a stride 
or two. 
</P>
<P>
There were early reports that Stevens had broken his arms and several ribs, but 
initial X-rays proved negative. Hours later, the broken elbow was discovered. 
Dr. Greg Adamson, who treated Stevens, said it was a minor fracture. Stevens 
also suffered bruises on his buttocks. 
</P>
<P>
Aiming for his first Eclipse Award, Stevens, 27, began Wednesday's program with 
$12,713,913 in purses, giving him an $809,631 lead over runner-up Jose Santos. 
Stevens had won with six of 31 starters in the Hollywood Park meeting. 
</P>
<P>
This wasn't the first time Stevens had been injured near the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1987, he broke an ankle in a starting gate accident at Santa 
Anita, forcing him to miss the Breeders' Cup a week later at Hollywood Park. He 
was sidelined 11 weeks in late 1985 after suffering a broken shoulder and a 
knee injury in a morning workout spill at Santa Anita. Last year, he broke his 
right wrist at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux returned to ride the rest of his mounts, and Bellido was cleared to 
come back but had no other mounts. 
</P>
<P>
X-rays of Nakatani and Corral at Centinela Hospital Medical Center proved 
negative, but both jockeys suffered mild concussions. Nakatani also strained 
his left hip, and Corral had various bumps and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
Trained by Steve Young, Rotation Speed hadn't started since finishing third in 
a $32,000 claiming race on Sept. 28 at Fairplex Park and had been scratched 
from a $25,000 claimer on Oct. 17 at Santa Anita. The Tri Jet filly suffered 
multiple breaks of the cannon bone in her right foreleg and was destroyed on 
the track. Rotation Speed had been examined by veterinarian Ray Baran Wednesday 
morning. None of the other horses were injured. 
</P>
<P>
The spill was the second of note in the meeting. Last Thursday, Laffit Pincay 
broke his collarbone in a post-race accident.

STAMS ON TOP AFTER GOING INSIDE; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: A RESERVE OUTSIDE LINEBACKER LAST SEASON, HE'S NOW A STARTER AND LEADS 
THE TEAM WITH 56 TACKLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Life on the outside is uncomplicated and largely free of double-team blocks, 
blind-side blows and 270-pound guards steaming straight into your chest. 
</P>
<P>
Life on the inside, however, is a mess -- and often rather painful. Knee 
injuries seem to hunt down and fell everybody who plays inside linebacker in 
the Rams' 3-4 front sooner or later. 
</P>
<P>
And linebacker Frank Stams, lucky guy, got moved from the outside to the inside 
last year, his rookie season, because there basically wasn't anybody else fit 
enough. Forgive him if he felt like a volunteer at the Alamo. 
</P>
<P>
And this year, he has played so well there after another wave of injuries -- 
first Larry Kelm, then, when he got back, Fred Strickland -- that Stams 
probably has locked himself into that position for the rest of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Oh well, Stams says philosophically, it may not be as glamorous as blitzing the 
quarterback, but he is playing. And as his strong, team-leading 10-tackle 
performance against the New York Giants last Sunday showed, he is playing 
quality football heading into this Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a little kid playing with big kids -- that's the way it is," Stams 
said. "You're going to get better playing sooner and playing faster, so I think 
that's what's happening to me. It's unfortunate those guys (Kelm and 
Strickland) got injured, but it gave me a chance to learn things faster and be 
in there sooner. 
</P>
<P>
"It has accelerated, I think, the way I play . . . if I'm making any 
improvement at all." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams say there is no doubt Stams has improved from last year's introduction 
to the middle. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Stams started three games, played in all 16, and was in on 27 
tackles. This season, the 1989 second-round pick from Notre Dame has started 
all nine games and leads the team with 56 tackles. He is teamed with Kelm at 
inside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a starter now," said defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur. "Last year, he 
was in there as a stop-gap guy, and as soon as Kelm or Strickland got well, 
then they would go in there and play, and he'd be on special teams and not 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"He's playing, he's taking every snap in practice, he's in the games now. As a 
result, I think his production is showing it." 
</P>
<P>
Stams is the first to admit that it has been a bumpy transition from the 
outside rusher he was at Notre Dame to hurdling the mental complexities -- not 
to mention trapping guards -- presented him on the inside. 
</P>
<P>
He has to make some of the defensive signal calls before the snap. He has to 
make sure he isn't caught looking the wrong way when an offensive lineman comes 
looking for a target. And he has to do all this while adapting to never being 
able to free-lance in a wide-open space. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Shurmur points out, Stams hasn't yet had a full training camp as a 3-4 
inside linebacker because in his rookie year he started on the outside and this 
year the Rams were toying with their since-ditched 4-3 alignment. 
</P>
<P>
But for all that, in a mostly dreary Ram season, Stams has been one of the 
team's few -- only? -- twinkles. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I was kind of worried at first," Stams said of the day he was told he 
was moving inside. "Were they happy with me at outside linebacker? All kinds of 
things run through your mind. 
</P>
<P>
"But then you just go from there and say, 'Hey, this is where they want me, and 
if I'm going to play, this is where I'm going to play.' So then I just tried to 
take in everything they threw at me as much as as I could." 
</P>
<P>
Said Shurmur: "It's vastly different. There isn't any comparison between the 
two. Everybody says a linebacker. I think you've got to find out whether he's 
an inside guy or an outside guy, then that determines it." 
</P>
<P>
Stams credits the late Carl Ekern, a long-time Ram inside linebacker and last 
year a volunteer assistant coach, for tutoring him on the basics of the 
position. 
</P>
<P>
After last Sunday's game, in which Shurmur said he thought Stams piled up even 
more tackles than the postgame tally, that's where he's going to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's a very good player there," Shurmur said. "We've had a lot of guys 
playing in there, and I think he's going to be one of those kind of guys before 
it's done. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a deceiving player, because if you put him out there and time him and see 
how high he jumps, you'd say, 'Oh, average.' But you put him on the field and 
when everybody's playing the game of football, then it's much better than 
average. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an instinctive football player. A lot of guys have got great numbers, got 
great physiques, got a lot of things going for them, but when it comes to just 
kind of finding the guy with the ball, they fall a little short. They're groove 
jobs. You've got to show them every step to the ball. Him, he gets to the 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
He may get to the ball fine from the inside, but Stams is pretty clear in 
saying that he wouldn't mind doing it from another spot -- if possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel that I'm just strictly an inside linebacker," Stams said. "I feel 
comfortable at that position. I'm happy to be there and I like playing it. But 
I don't feel that I'm strictly an inside linebacker. I feel if they asked me to 
play another position, I'd be happy to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Gee, wonder what position that might be?

NEWSWIRE: SURVEY: SOME BLACKS EXPECT TOO MUCH OF SPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although black athletes say sports help them get better grades and stay in high 
school, a Lou Harris survey shows too many have unrealistic expectations of 
getting college scholarships and professional contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-nine percent of black high school athletes queried said they expected to 
play in college, and 43% said they could make it in professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
Of whites, 39% thought they would get to play in college and 16% thought they 
had a shot at the pros. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, no more than 1% of high school athletes make it in college sports, 
and only one in 10,000 goes on to the pros. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that we've sold the black community decade after decade, that 
sport is the way out of poverty," said Richard Lapchick, director of 
Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society. "This 
outlines the problems we have to get black students to focus on alternatives."

<P>
FIESTA BOWL NEARLY WAS VOTED OUT OF BUSINESS

Winners and losers in this year's bowl sweeps: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Loser: Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
From New Year's Day giant to scapegoat. Organizers came very close to canceling 
the game because of the polarization caused by the defeated Martin Luthur King 
Jr. holiday referendum. They even considered a move to Jack Murphy Stadium in 
San Diego, but that was shot down by the NCAA. Just as well: It would have been 
a public relations and logistics catastrophe. Making matters worse, the Fiesta 
wanted Notre Dame; it got Louisville. A banner week, it wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Loser: Copper Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
See Fiesta Bowl. The NAACP already has condemned California for accepting an 
invitation to play in the Tucson-based bowl. Not exactly the sort of publicity 
the Copper Bowl folks were hoping for. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Winner: Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
When Iowa and Illinois were beaten last Saturday, thus giving every team in the 
Big Ten at least two losses, the idea of inviting the conference runner-up 
became less appealing to the Sugar Bowl selection committee. Enter the 
Cavaliers, who solved all sorts of problems -- theirs and the Sugar Bowl's -- 
by accepting the bid to travel to New Orleans. Virginia, which previously had 
been considering the Fiesta Bowl, earns about $700,000 more by playing in the 
Sugar Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Winner: Southern Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
The 25th-ranked Golden Eagles, previously destined for the Independence Bowl 
and a fun-filled stay in, uh, Shreveport, La., upgraded to the All-American 
Bowl. The payout -- $600,000 -- is the same, but Southern Mississippi gets ESPN 
instead of Mizlou and a Dec. 28 playing date rather than Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Loser: Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Beware of purple bandwagons. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Winner: Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
The Cornhuskers panicked and committed themselves to the Citrus Bowl long 
before they needed to. Turns out to be a great move, especially now that 
Georgia Tech, ranked No. 4, is the only undefeated team. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Loser: Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels, ranked 15th, have a good team but little television appeal. Nor are 
they known for bringing lots of fans to bowls. Then again, Ole Miss has been to 
only four bowl games in the last 20 years. The Sugar Bowl is praying the Rebels 
don't win the Southeastern Conference title and receive the automatic bid to 
New Orleans. The Fiesta Bowl has its choice of the non-SEC winner and, given 
its druthers, would take Auburn, Alabama or Tennessee before inviting Ole Miss. 
Too bad. The Rebels are worth watching. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Winners: Notre Dame, Colorado, Louisville and Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame and Colorado get a national championship rematch. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville gets a $2.5-million Fiesta Bowl paycheck, compared to the $600,000 
payout it would have received from the All-American Bowl. The Cardinals' first 
bowl game since 1977 is a New Year's Day game. Their first television 
appearance since 1983 is on a major network. Of course, there might be a price 
to be paid for the decision to venture to Arizona. We'll see. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech gets a chance to win a national title if several things happen, 
including another regular-season loss by Notre Dame, followed by an Irish 
victory over Colorado in the Orange Bowl. Georgia Tech would then need to 
wallop Nebraska in the Citrus Bowl. Hey, a similar scenario worked for Miami 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC considered pulling its teams out of Fiesta Bowl contention -- but not 
for long. Two reasons: The decision to play was one for the university 
presidents to determine; and the SEC office saw nothing morally wrong with 
accepting a Fiesta Bowl bid. 
</P>
<P>
"The general consensus of a lot of people in our conference is that it's 
preposterous to hold the Fiesta Bowl accountable for the actions of the 
voters," said Brad Davis, SEC assistant commissioner. "Those of us here in the 
South are used to the broad swath of indicting everyone for the actions of some 
people. You've got to cut through the grandstanding of the situation and really 
look at the facts. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, where do you stop?" Davis said. "Does an institution not play a bowl 
in California because (the state) might have a very liberal abortion law? Is 
the SEC office in Birmingham held accountable because the state capitol in 
Montgomery flies a rebel flag?" 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he expects the SEC to be criticized for participating in the Fiesta 
Bowl. "We're going to take some hits on it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wave goodby to the NCAA rule requiring bowl selection committees to wait until 
Nov. 24 to extend official invitations. Dick Schultz, NCAA executive director, 
said he expects the deadline to be abolished at the organization's convention 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a ridiculous rule," Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
Bowls can be penalized by the NCAA for ignoring the current rule, but it never 
happens. By never formally inviting a team until Nov. 24, the selection 
committees avoid punishment. 
</P>
<P>
If the NCAA has its way, the bowl people themselves will determine their own 
date, if any, for extending bids. And as usual, the bowl people, as they do now 
under the current format, will disregard the guidelines and arrange 
"unofficial" matchups. 
</P>
<P>
"The bowl association will try to come up with some sort of self-regulation 
that would hopefully attempt to keep some sense of order to the selection 
process, not that there's much now," said John Reid, executive director of the 
Holiday Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"The most likely to be injured are the schools that come on strongly at the end 
of the season." 
</P>
<P>
One other thing to remember about next season: As a safeguard of sorts, a team 
must beat at least six Division I-A opponents to be eligible for a bowl. That 
means the minute a team such as Notre Dame wins that sixth game, bowl scouts 
will be there with pens poised. 
</P>
<P>
For those clamoring for a Division I-A football playoff system, take heart. 
Schultz said one is on its way. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just my own personal feeling, but I think that we'll have one before the 
decade is over," he said. "But I think it will be later in the decade, rather 
than earlier in the decade." 
</P>
<P>
Schultz said he envisioned a playoff that would, at first, include only two or 
four teams. 
</P>
<P>
When listing the nation's best running backs, don't forget to include Army's 
Mike Mayweather among the candidates. Colorado's Eric Bieniemy, Notre Dame's 
Raghib Ismail and Washington's Greg Lewis get most of the publicity, but 
Mayweather deserves mention, too. He rushed for 129 yards against Air Force 
last Saturday, which gives him eight 100-yard games this season and 21 in his 
career. . . . Virginia receiver Herman Moore isn't expected to return for his 
final year of eligibility. Moore, who has caught touchdown passes in an 
NCAA-record nine consecutive games, hasn't revealed his decision, but all 
indications point to first-round status in the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
Our top 10: (1) Notre Dame, (2) Colorado, (3) Georgia Tech, (4) BYU, (5) Miami, 
(6) Texas, (7) Florida, (8) Virginia, (9) Washington, (10) Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
Our waiting list: Ohio State, Louisville, Penn State, Mississippi, Houston.

Coach John Robinson continued to praise little-used running back Gaston Green 
Wednesday, saying that with his 31-yard run last week, Green is showing the 
Rams that he deserves more playing time. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not a verbal person," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"What he's doing now on the practice field, he's practicing his . . . off. So I 
think he's saying nonverbally, 'Hey, put me in the game.' I'm very impressed 
with the way he's handled things that haven't gone his way. So he's sending me 
some nonverbal messages that I should respond to, and I'm trying to."

<P>
There still are about 2,600 tickets remaining for Sunday's game at Anaheim 
Stadium against the Dallas Cowboys. If the tickets are not sold by 1 p.m. 
today, the game will be blacked out locally. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys released longtime Chicago Bear receiver Dennis McKinnon, a Plan-B 
signee during the off-season, and activated rookie linebacker Dave Harper from 
their practice squad Wednesday. McKinnon, who started the first three games of 
the season, had lost his job to Michael Irvin. TIM KAWAKAMI

CHARITY: AN OVERSIZE CROWD ATTENDS 'A TRIBUTE TO THE GOLDEN YEARS,' RAISING 
MORE THAN $125,000 FOR THE HUNGRY.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's more than one way for an organization to guarantee that a cross section 
of the town will show up for its big annual do. 
</P>
<P>
Cajoling sometimes works. Naming a big-league chairman almost always helps. And 
putting the cause in just the right light never hurts. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Adult Services, which sponsors the Meals on Wheels program and played 
host to its 14th annual "A Tribute to the Golden Years" benefit at the San 
Diego Hilton on Nov. 8, used a technique that has served well in the past. 
Besides naming a pair of hard-to-refuse general chairmen -- banker Bob Adelizzi 
and his wife, Tommi, SAS drafted developer Patrick Kruer and his wife, Barbara, 
as chairmen of the Builders and Developers Committee and Dr. Gerard Burrow of 
the UCSD Medical School as chairman of the Physicians Committee. Their jobs 
were to deliver patrons from their particular folds, and the turnout, at 650, 
was sufficient to make the Hilton's vast International Ballroom seem more 
banana republic in size. 
</P>
<P>
Credit for the oversized crowd was shared by this year's featured honorees, 
philanthropists John and Sally Thornton, since the room contained several 
hundred of their fellows from the intermingled worlds of high society, the arts 
and philanthropy. As a typical Thornton touch, they arranged for hosts and 
hostesses to distribute pink carnations during the cocktail hour as thank-yous 
for attendance. 
</P>
<P>
The group discovered, to its general surprise, that it shared in common one 
trait that perhaps none ever had contemplated -- it was described by an SAS 
spokeswoman as "the chronologically advantaged." The reference reflected the 
generally elderly client list of the Meals on Wheels program, which in 1989 
delivered daily meals to some 2,200 persons throughout the county (Tommi 
Adelizzi and Sally Thornton are among the 1,600 volunteers who work one or two 
days a month delivering the meals). The program is supported by fees from those 
clients who can afford all or part of the daily $5 charge, and by donations. A 
considerably larger group receives other services that help them maintain 
independent life styles, include practical assistance with such trying types of 
paper work as tax returns, renters-assistance applications and insurance 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
According to SAS development director William Wiener, the organization does not 
receive any public funding. He said the "Tribute " benefit would raise net 
proceeds in excess of $125,000 and added, "This sum is going to subsidize a 
great many meals." 
</P>
<P>
At this dinner, the crowd was served Greek salad, a sort of mixed grill of beef 
filet and chicken breast and a dessert of berries, all of it consumed in breaks 
between dancing to the Dick Braun Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
The Thorntons, back from Europe just three days earlier and preparing for the 
weekend wedding of their son, said they found the evening a welcome intermezzo 
in the midst of a demanding week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such a wonderful cause, and we're deeply proud to be honored," Sally 
said. "I think Meals on Wheels is such an outstanding program because it 
provides loving care to those who need it." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you could honor two more distinguished citizens of San Diego," 
said chairman Bob Adelizzi, "not only for the amount they contribute but for 
the length of time they've been giving." 
</P>
<P>
The dinner proceeded with a series of addresses, including one in which SAS 
President John Musial congratulated the crowd for what he considered the 
deepest motivation behind their attendance. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to help seniors stay independent," he said. "SAS is founded on the 
great American traditions of volunteerism and private charity to the needy. We 
stand for people helping people." 
</P>
<P>
The guest list included City Councilman Wes Pratt, Ruth and Jim Mulvaney, Rita 
and UCSD Chancellor Richard Atkinson; Amy and Brute Krulak; SAS executive 
director Barbara Bright and her husband, Harold; Annabelle and Al Gabbs; Jean 
and Al Anderson; Jeanne Brace; Betty and Ross Tharp; Alice Zukor; Marge 
O'Donnell; B.J. and Hal Williams; Marion Bourland; Christine and Russell 
Forester; 1989 Meals on Wheels honorees Junko and Larry Cushman; Judith Harris 
and Robert Singer; actress Mercedes McCambridge; Lee and P.J. Maturo; Harriet

CORONADO -- About 400 autograph hounds traded sacks of canned goods for 
admission to the book-signing party given Nov. 7 in the Hotel del Coronado's 
red-and-white-striped Centennial Tent to celebrate the publication of "A Street 
Is Not a Home: Solving America's Homeless Dilemma." 
</P>
<P>
Author and San Diego Municipal Judge Robert C. Coates wielded the pen at the 
Mexican fiesta-themed soiree, hosted by hotelier Larry Lawrence and his wife, 
Shelia. Coates, who several years ago spent a brief time living among the 
homeless on the city's streets, said in a statement that he has received a 
grant of $100,000 through the San Diego Community Foundation to fund the 
distribution of the book to civic and community leaders throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to popular belief, the vast majority of the homeless can be helped," 
he said. "This is the first book that actually addresses the issue of how to 
solve the homeless dilemma through effective mental health programs and the 
fostering of low-income housing in our regional planning." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the guests managed to juggle an open book in one hand and a plate of 
antojitos (hors d'oeuvres) in the other, all the while swaying slightly to the 
nonstop mariachi music. Salsa stains on open pages were not uncommon, and 
perhaps could be taken as dual compliments directed to both the author and the 
kitchen staff. 
</P>
<P>
The canned goods collected at the door were donated for distribution by five 
organizations, including Jewish Family Services, God's Extended Hand and the 
Senior Center. 
</P>
<P>
Coates' wife, Mimi, and children Whitney and Cameron stood in line of those 
waiting for autographs.

ROHRABACHER IS OWN WORST ENEMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing to express my appreciation for Joseph Bell's excellent editorial 
on Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ("Rohrabacher's Sin: Self-Righteousness," Oct. 26). 
The congressman's hypocrisy really stands out when he demands drug tests for 
his employees but maintains his own right to privacy about his history of drug 
use. 
</P>
<P>
The best feature of Bell's article was his surprising tact. He did not wish to 
talk about Rohrabacher's morally bankrupt past, or his LSD use, or his drug 
parties, or his . . . you get the picture. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher has become his own worst enemy. Through his own preaching and 
holier-than-thou attitude, he has established an atmosphere of intolerance that 
will work against him. His shining armor is only a thin shell that hides his 
hypocrisy and less-than-perfect past. Rohrabacher must stop his "no comment" 
strategy and come clean with his own supporters. But be careful, Congressman. 
Police chief Daryl Gates' desired law for the execution of casual drug users 
has no statute of limitation, and he has been asking questions. . . .

ARTICLE DISPLAYS AN 'EXCEPTIONAL TALENT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How fortunate your Orange County readers are to have a writer of Joseph N. 
Bell's caliber. His article entitled "Son's Dedication to Life Survives His 
Irreparable Loss," (Nov. 2) is a gem. Mr. Bell's ability to extract the essence 
of this tragic event, then accurately convey it to us in a deeply sensitive, 
beautifully expressed manner demonstrates an exceptional talent. 
</P>
<P>
I attended Josh Lapin's funeral and visited his family later in the week. Mr. 
Bell related the Lapins' courage and closeness. He also mentioned several 
quotes by Rabbi Mark S. Miller, who has a remarkable ability to lead a bereaved 
family "through the valley of the shadow of death" into an affirmation of life. 
</P>
<P>
The message we receive from this article should be read by everyone and tucked 
away for the day when we seek strength and understanding of the process of 
death. Although there are no words to lessen the pain the Lapins are 
experiencing, I know they will cherish this writing. 
</P>
<P>
I look for Mr. Bell's column daily and want to commend him for his ability to 
provide us with the highest form of journalism, an amazing talent that captures 
our hearts as well as our minds.

<P>
RUSTIC CANYON: LITTLE REMAINS OF AN ELABORATE STRONGHOLD THAT WAS BUILT IN THE 
LATE 1930S, WHEN A SMALL GROUP HOPED TO ESTABLISH A NAZI UTOPIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tucked away up Rustic Canyon is a sordid bit of local history. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by the rugged mountainsides and overgrown by brush, the burned-out 
and crumbling buildings are what remains of the Murphy Ranch, where during the 
late 1930s a small group hoping to establish a Nazi utopia built an elaborate 
infrastructure that included a 395,000-gallon concrete water tank, a 
20,000-gallon diesel fuel tank, and their own power station. 
</P>
<P>
Hikers who reach the site, usually by climbing the creek bed from Will Rogers 
State Historic Park, are sometimes surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"People who don't know the story come upon this and say, 'What the hell is 
going on?' " said Thomas Young, a professional photographer, local historian 
and president of the Palisades Historical Society. Young learned about the 
ranch while growing up in the Pacific Palisades area, and it was included in a 
book on the history of Rustic Canyon written by his mother, Betty Lou Young. 
Thomas Young took the photographs for the book, which was published in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
The story, which Young admits is sketchy, centers on the owners of the Murphy 
Ranch, Winona and Norman Stephens, and a mysterious but persuasive German named 
Herr Schmidt. Although county records say that a Jessie M. Murphy purchased the 
property in 1933, Young said there is no other record of her, and no one in the 
area ever saw her, leading him to suspect Murphy was a front name. The name 
Murphy Ranch, however, stuck. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Stephens was an engineer with silver mining interests in Colorado, and 
apparently financed the operation. His wife, the daughter of a wealthy 
industrialist, had a strong belief in metaphysical phenomena, and apparently 
fell under the spell of Schmidt, who claimed to have supernatural powers. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt convinced the Stephenses that once Europe collapsed and Germany emerged 
victorious in the war, anarchy would break out across the country, and law and 
order would break down. His plan was to create a command center in which the 
National Socialist community would wait out the war. They could then emerge 
from their mountain retreat and impose order on society. 
</P>
<P>
It apparently made sense to the Stephenses, for they proceeded to spend an 
estimated $4 million to build an infrastructure that would be enough for a 
small town. They also made plans to build a four-story mansion that were never 
carried out, probably because they ran out of money, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God they didn't have the assets to pull it off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
What they did accomplish, however, is amazing. The entire hillside above the 
ranch was terraced, and a sprinkler system, complete with timers, was laid out 
to irrigate the numerous fruit, nut, carob and olive trees and other plants 
that covered it. Several concrete staircases ascend the hillside, which were 
either to allow for maintenance of the trees, or more likely, Young believes, 
to patrol the property. 
</P>
<P>
"What they did is they created a whole environment of their own," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
The water tank and the power station, with its double generators, ensured that 
the community would be self-sufficient. The power station is the only structure 
basically intact, although the generators were removed and donated to Loyola 
Marymount University in the early 1970s. The inside walls are covered with 
graffiti, much of it typical of what one would find in an abandoned building, 
including, ironically, several swastikas. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are a lot of gangs and skinheads who come here," Young said. 
"Nuts are attracted to this place." 
</P>
<P>
The only other structure standing on the property is a two-story steel-frame 
building that was used as a garage and machine shed. It is now a rusted hulk, 
everything around and in it having burned in the 1978 Mandeville Canyon fire. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, they were here to stay. This was to be a real monument," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
Workmen hired to build at the ranch were reportedly confused at the scale of 
what they were constructing, according to Young, who spoke to several of them 
years later. Even for an estate, the scale of the project and the extensive 
infrastructure made no sense to them. 
</P>
<P>
"They were setting up something beyond even what an extremely wealthy person 
could do," Young said, which makes him suspect that at least some of the 
funding for the project came from Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Plans were drawn by architect Welton Becket in the late 1930s for a mansion, 
with barn, silo and cottages, for a client, "Mrs. Murphy." But these were 
apparently deemed insufficient, according to Young, and a new set of blueprints 
were drawn in 1941 by Paul Williams, the noted black architect. The client this 
time was Winona Stephens. 
</P>
<P>
Young finds great irony in the selection of Williams as the designer. 
</P>
<P>
"The 'master race' couldn't get it together enough, so they had to go to a 
black architect. I think that's wonderfully poetic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Nazi utopian community was never successfully formed, Schmidt did 
apparently have some followers. There were reports from neighbors of the ranch 
that paramilitary maneuvers took place during the weekends. Young believes that 
people would drive up to the ranch from the city to take part in the 
activities, and then drive back at night. 
</P>
<P>
"I think really that it was Joe Blow Loser coming up for a weekend," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan came to a screeching halt on Dec. 8, 1941, the day after the bombing 
of Pearl Harbor, when federal agents, who apparently had been watching the 
progress of the compound and its activities with some interest, stormed the 
ranch. They arrested Schmidt, whom they identified as a Nazi spy. The agents 
also found a powerful shortwave radio, reportedly for sending messages to 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Schmidt was apparently imprisoned, Young said, but nobody knows what happened 
to him. 
</P>
<P>
The Stephenses remained on the ranch, living in the upper floor of the steel 
garage structure until 1948, when they sold the ranch to the Huntington 
Hartford Foundation, which combined it with the property to the north and 
formed an artist's colony. 
</P>
<P>
John Vincent, a UCLA music professor who negotiated the sale of the property 
for the foundation and served as the foundation's director until the 1960s, 
provided Young with most of the details of the story of the Nazi compound. 
</P>
<P>
The property eventually came into the possession of the Los Angeles Department 
of Parks and Recreation, which wants to turn it over to the state as part of 
the Topanga State Park, said David Conetta, supervisor of land management and 
environment activities for the city agency. The state, however, will not accept 
the property unless the structures are demolished, a task the city lacks the 
money to do. So for now, the relics of the Murphy ranch remain. 
</P>
<P>
Although Young admits that many of the details of the Nazi presence at the 
Murphy Ranch are untraceable, and some aspects of the story have taken on the 
characteristics of a legend, the one fact about which he feels most certain is 
that there was a Nazi encampment in Rustic Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a powerful presence here," he said. And then, looking around at the 
craggy hillsides that he has hiked and photographed since his youth, he 
concludes: 
</P>
<P>
"It's such a pretty place for such a stupid pursuit."

CITIES TO FIGHT REDISTRICTING FOR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE MAYOR OF SAN DIMAS IS COORDINATING AN EFFORT TO DRAW UP AN 
ALTERNATE PLAN THAT WOULD PLACE MOST OF THE VALLEY IN THE SAME DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Cities dissatisfied with the political splintering of the San Gabriel Valley 
under a federally mandated reapportionment of the County Board of Supervisors 
are collecting money to hire their own experts to draw up a plan that would 
place most of the area in one supervisorial district. 
</P>
<P>
San Dimas Mayor Terry Dipple is spearheading the effort by the San Gabriel 
Valley Assn. of Cities to develop the plan by next year, when lines are drawn 
for the 1992 County Board of Supervisors elections. The plan would also enlarge 
the board from five members to seven. 
</P>
<P>
Dipple has asked 32 cities to contribute $500 each to hire National 
Demographics Corp. of Claremont -- at a total cost of $22,500 -- to draw 
proposed supervisorial boundaries, using 1990 census data. He said he is also 
soliciting $1,000 donations from a number of corporations, which he refused to 
name. 
</P>
<P>
Cities that have agreed to contribute include Alhambra, Arcadia, Azusa, 
Glendora, La Puente and San Dimas. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed lines would be submitted to the Board of Supervisors next year for 
consideration during reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
The key element in the cities' plan would be expansion of the board. 
</P>
<P>
Without expansion, Dipple said, it would be impossible to keep most of the San 
Gabriel Valley intact and also meet a court mandate to provide a Latino 
district. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon in August ordered a drastic revision of 
supervisorial districts after concluding that the county had drawn boundaries 
in a way that discriminated against Latinos. The court-ordered reapportionment 
converted the 1st Supervisorial District, now represented by Supervisor Pete 
Schabarum, into a predominantly Latino district. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon added East Los Angeles to the 1st District and removed such cities as 
Covina, Claremont, Glendora, Pomona, Temple City and West Covina, shifting them 
into Supervisor Mike Antonovich's 5th District. In addition, Walnut and Diamond 
Bar were shifted into the 4th District, a largely coastal area represented by 
Supervisor Deane Dana. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Board of Supervisors is still challenging the reapportionment in 
court, an election to choose a successor to Schabarum in the new 1st District 
is scheduled for Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Dipple said the fragmentation of Schabarum's old district will reduce the San 
Gabriel Valley's clout on regional issues. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, his own city, San Dimas, will be represented by 
Antonovich, whose constituencies have included Glendale, Burbank and the San 
Fernando Valley. Dipple said Antonovich is unlikely to pay as much attention to 
San Dimas and other cities in the East San Gabriel Valley when most of his 
constituents live elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"We have so much at stake," Dipple said. San Gabriel Valley cities are just 
beginning to address transportation, waste management, air quality and other 
issues on a regional basis, he said. "We're really becoming a force now, and 
it's important to stay in one group." 
</P>
<P>
Dipple said many officials in San Gabriel Valley cities with high Latino 
populations would prefer to be in a supervisorial district serving the region 
rather than one linked to East Los Angeles. "The Latino makeup and philosophy 
in the San Gabriel Valley is different from East Los Angeles," Dipple said. 
</P>
<P>
San Gabriel Mayor James Castaneda, a Latino whose city was moved to the new 1st 
District from Antonovich's 5th district, agreed. "The San Gabriel Valley and 
Los Angeles are different places," he said. "We have different needs." 
</P>
<P>
But Castaneda said San Gabriel declined to contribute money to the San Gabriel 
Valley Assn. of Cities project because the courts have already acted on 
redistricting. 
</P>
<P>
Dipple said San Gabriel and some other cities apparently misunderstood the 
purpose of the proposed redistricting project. He said he is sending a letter 
to cities pointing out that regardless of the court case, supervisorial 
districts must be redrawn next year to reflect population changes from the 1990 
census and that now is the time to prepare recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Like Dipple, Castaneda said the best way to serve everyone's interests would be 
to expand the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Richard P. Fajardo, staff attorney with the Mexican-American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund, one of the plaintiffs in the reapportionment suit, said the 
board would have to expand to seven or even nine districts in order to draw 
boundaries that would serve the regional interests of the San Gabriel Valley 
and also meet the needs of Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he said, cities such as El Monte, La Puente and Irwindale would have 
to be part of a Latino district in order to preserve a Latino majority. In the 
new 1st District, which stretches from East Los Angeles to La Puente and south 
to Santa Fe Springs, Latinos are 51% of the registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
In Monterey Park, Mayor Judy Chu said her city, which is within the 1st 
Supervisorial District under the court reapportionment, would be better off in 
a district centered in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"There has to be some attempt made to deal with regional interests," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the court-ordered reapportionment, Monterey Park was isolated from 
other San Gabriel Valley cities. Monterey Park has been the only San Gabriel 
Valley city in the 3rd District, a San Fernando Valley-Hollywood-East Los 
Angeles district represented by Edmund D. Edelman. Chu said Edelman has been 
helpful to Monterey Park, but the city should be represented by a supervisor 
whose concerns are focused on the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena, Alhambra and South Pasadena are already represented by Antonovich and 
would remain in his district under the court-ordered reapportionment. Alhambra 
Councilman Michael Blanco said his city "has had a pretty good working 
relationship" with Antonovich and is not eager to change supervisorial 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena Mayor Jess Hughston said the principal problem is that the Board of 
Supervisors is too small. 
</P>
<P>
"The five-member board is inadequate," he said, "and I wonder if two more would 
be enough."

FINAL VOTE ON HOUSE SIZES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday is expected to give final approval to a modified 
ordinance limiting the size of two-story homes. 
</P>
<P>
The council last week discarded an earlier version of the ordinance, which was 
a two-tiered formula based on lot size. 
</P>
<P>
The previous draft said two-story homes on lots of 7,200 square feet or less 
could have floor space totaling 50% of the lot size. Homes on larger lots could 
have floor space totaling 35% of the lot size. 
</P>
<P>
The revised ordinance does away with the two-tiered system. It requires instead 
that total floor space of any two-story home not exceed 35% of the total lot 
area. It also gives property owners the right to apply for an exception to the 
rule through the city's conditional-use process.

In light of the Persian Gulf situation, the City Council is evaluating its

On Tuesday, the council decided to hold off on any changes until the details of

into effect Jan. 1, grants state employees serving in the Persian Gulf 180 days

SUNSET PROJECT APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council has given initial approval to the widening of a 
1,700-foot stretch of Sunset Boulevard, despite complaints from some residents 
that the project will increase traffic. 
</P>
<P>
By an 11-0 vote Tuesday, the council approved a report that found the 
$1.8-million proposal would have no significant effect on the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed project must still be endorsed by several state and federal 
agencies, and eventually must return to the council for funding. 
</P>
<P>
Some area residents, including members of the Pacific Palisades Residents 
Assn., urged the council to delay approval of the project because of concerns 
about the environment. The residents predicted that the widening would create 
major noise, traffic and pollution problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It will become a speedway," resident Michael Franklin said. "There is no need 
for this project." 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Marvin Braude, who represents the area, said the improvements 
are needed to make the corridor safer for motorists and pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
The project calls for creating several left-turn pockets, as well as a center 
median between Baylor Street and an alley just east of Las Lomas Avenue.

BIKE LANE FUNDS SOUGHT

Despite some residents' concerns, the city will apply for funds that will 
probably lead to the installation of a bicycle lane on 4th Street between San 
Vicente and Wilshire boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
With the application deadline near, the City Council directed the city staff to 
seek $27,890 in Southern California Assn. of Governments funds to establish the 
bike lane. The vote was 5 to 1, with Councilman Herbert Katz voting no. 
</P>
<P>
A few residents of the 4th Street area objected, saying 4th Street has too much

You may not have tickets to Saturday's big USC-UCLA football game at the Rose 
Bowl, but if you're interested in soaking up some cross-town rivalry or basking 
in college nostalgia, you're not necessarily out of luck. 
</P>
<P>
Those who want to listen to bands, watch cheerleaders and haul out the old 
tailgate brunch can do all that -- without tickets -- outside the Rose Bowl 
this Saturday, if they're willing to mingle with the other 100,000 or so fans 
who will be sticking around to watch the game, said Rick Purdy, associate 
athletic director at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"For this game, people will probably start arriving about dawn," Purdy said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if you're not an alumnus, you can spread out a picnic on the soccer field 
just south of the Rose Bowl, where UCLA will sponsor a pregame rally at about 
9:30 a.m. with music from the school band and some cheerleading performances, 
Purdy said. 
</P>
<P>
If you're a USC fan and wouldn't be caught dead in the UCLA camp, you can 
always 
</P>
<P>
mingle, hum the fight song and break out the picnic. 
</P>
<P>
"The tailgating is quite a spectacle in itself, what with fans from both 
schools all wearing the colors," said Rob Asghar of the USC News Service. 
</P>
<P>
Parking on the Rose Bowl golf course is free; the paved lots are reserved for 
season ticket holders. But you could also ride a bicycle into the area (and 
avoid anticipated traffic jams) or park in the Parsons Co. lot at Fair Oaks 
Ave. and Walnut Boulevard in Old Pasadena and take a free shuttle bus to the 
Rose Bowl. Dave Casey of Rose Bowl operations said shuttles will begin running 
at 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
As of Tuesday, there were still a few game tickets for sale through the UCLA 
ticket office for $27 each. The tickets belonged to season ticket holders who 
returned their tickets. "Usually, we're sold out by now, but this is unusual. 
It's probably because we've had such a terrible season," a UCLA ticket operator 
said. UCLA's record is 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
The game begins at 12:30 p.m. KAREN E. KLEIN

In a 5-1 vote, with Councilman Herbert Katz voting no, the council created five

customers', employees' and company cars. 
</P>

The new zones, on sections of California Avenue, Pine Street, Maple Street, 
29th Street, 21st Street, 22nd Street and Franklin Street, establish times when

PROPOSED RISE IN FEES OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The price of conditional-use permits and variances will go up $200 under 
increases in community development fees tentatively approved by the City 
Council on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed fee increases will affect building, engineering and planning fees, 
which, according to the Planning Department, have not kept pace with actual 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed fee for a variance or a conditional-use permit -- the permits most 
often sought by property owners -- would increase from $250 to $450. 
</P>
<P>
The council also gave preliminary approval to an ordinance that allows the city 
to adjust its fees automatically to keep pace with increases in county 
community development fees. 
</P>
<P>
A public hearing and a second reading of the ordinance is set for Nov. 27.

MAYORS CALL FOR HALT TO BONELLI PARK PLANS

<TEXT>
<P>
Mayors of four cities in the San Gabriel Valley on Wednesday called for the 
county to scrap plans for more development at Frank G. Bonelli Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
The plan to further develop the 1,994-acre park calls for a 150-room lodge, an 
80-unit cabin complex, and a restaurant in a hillside area west of Puddingstone 
Reservoir. Raging Waters Inc., a private firm that leases property for its 
theme park, plans to add 119 acres for more attractions and a parking 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
The plan is a scaled-down version of a development proposal offered by the 
county in 1988, but the surrounding cities have complained that they were not 
included in the planning effort. 
</P>
<P>
"We're tired of fighting," San Dimas Mayor Terry Dipple said at a news 
conference in front of the Raging Waters entrance. "We've been fighting with 
(County Supervisor Pete) Schabarum since this thing started. We want them to 
scrap the (environmental impact) report and plans, and sit down with us." 
Schabarum's district includes the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Mayors from Glendora, Covina and Pomona joined in seeking to maintain the 
undeveloped part of the park in its natural setting. 
</P>
<P>
"San Dimas already has three hotels," Dipple said. "We are not looking for an 
economical benefit for the park. The almost 2,000 acres is the last remaining 
natural area in Los Angeles County." 
</P>
<P>
Concern about increased traffic has prompted Pomona to adopt several 
resolutions opposing development in the park, said Mayor Donna Smith. Smith 
said the county was "shoveling (the plans) down our throats, and we're tired of 
it. We'd like to tell Pete (Schabarum), hell no." Smith said that "each time 
the county needs a buck, it takes it from the cities, we're tired of being 
bucked to death." 
</P>
<P>
A forum on the park development expansion will be held tonight at 7 p.m. in the 
San Dimas Community Building.

'TOOLS TO FACE REALITY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID MARGOLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To help emigrants from Los Angeles take root in Israel, the Los Angeles Jewish 
Federation operates the Aliyah Demonstration Project, which provides 
prospective immigrants with what project director Arnold Bender calls "tools to 
face reality." 
</P>
<P>
Though American Jews may initially feel at home in the Jewish state, Bender 
emphasizes that Israel's culture is very different from America's. 
</P>
<P>
"No one knows 'I Love Lucy' or the Dodgers," he said. "You don't know what the 
blue line painted on the curb means when you want to park. You don't know the 
network in your professional field, or how to go about signing up for a 
driver's license and a bank account. All the systems are different -- and in 
another language to boot." 
</P>
<P>
Bender strongly recommends that prospective immigrants make exploratory trips 
to Israel to investigate job and housing markets, and that they work on Hebrew 
language skills before going. In addition, he says, they should give serious 
thought to how their children are likely to fare in a new land. Couples should 
make sure they are in accord on the move and the reasons for making it, he 
adds. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't want to face the complexities," Bender lamented. 
</P>
<P>
On the other end of the Aliyah pipeline, the federation's Jerusalem office 
provides various services to new immigrants -- social programs and reunions to 
help them build a network, counseling services in collaboration with the Assn. 
of Americans and Canadians in Israel and no-interest and low-interest loans to 
assist with emergencies and mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration from Los Angeles -- and from all of North America -- has dropped 
significantly in recent years, according to Bender and other Aliyah 
professionals. They attribute the decline to a number of factors, including 
Israel's troubled economy, continuing regional conflict and the Arab uprising 
on the West Bank, as well as a tendency among American Jews today to regard 
Israel in less idealistic terms than they did, say, 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Bender said, 110 Jews, including children, emigrated from Los 
Angeles to Israel. That was down from 177 in 1985. DAVID MARGOLIS

PASADENA PROPOSAL FOR SENIOR HOUSING UNDERGOES REVISIONS 
</P>

<P>
Plans for 44 units of senior citizen housing in the city's old police station 
-- an integral part of the $50.5-million Marengo block project -- are being 
reworked. 
</P>
<P>
The 44 units were the only affordable-income apartments planned for a 394-unit 
project. 
</P>
<P>
The California Housing Rehabilitation Program in May turned down a $1.3-million 
loan to the Janss Corp., which planned a $6-million renovation of the former 
Hall of Justice to convert it into low-income, senior citizen housing. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Santa Monica-based development company and city planners have 
been trying to rearrange the project, which was approved by the city directors 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough problem," said Marsha Rood, an administrator with the city's 
Housing and Development Department. "The question we're going to be asking is, 
without any money from the state, is (rehabilitation of the police building) 
financially feasible?" 
</P>
<P>
Max Nardoni, Janss' manager for the project, said any new housing proposal 
would be "a big change in the scope" of the project. The rest of the project 
includes 350 newly constructed units in nine buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"We were disappointed that we didn't get the loan, but we're used to dealing 
with things like this," he said. "Part of being a developer is always solving 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
The project failed to qualify for state funding under guidelines that changed 
this year, requiring that rehabilitation not cost more than new construction, 
Nardoni said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the extensive demolition work needed on the police building 
interior, costs of renovation are higher than building, he said. The old Hall 
of Justice, built in 1930 and designed by architect Joseph J. Blick, is one of 
14 structures within the Civic Center District on the National Register of 
Historic Places.

<P>
Among the alternatives Janss has been considering, Nardoni said, are 30 senior 
housing units within the Hall of Justice; 24 units elsewhere in the project, 
and conversion of the police building to lofts to provide work and living space 
for artists. The company expects to have a new proposal to the city next week. 
</P>
<P>
The city was expected to contribute $1.3 million toward the senior housing. But 
if the number of units is reduced to 24, the city contribution would be lower 
and the money could be spent on less expensive housing projects elsewhere, City 
Director Rick Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't like to do these kind of deals anymore," Cole said. But he added that 
the total project will bring 1,000 residents downtown and preserve a historical 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
The 60-year-old former police station building is part of the ambitious 
$50.5-million Marengo block development project. The city-owned trapezoidal 
site was sold to Janss early this year for $6.9 million. It is bounded by Holly 
and Walnut streets and Marengo Avenue and the Santa Fe Railway tracks next to 
Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the 350 units, the development includes a two-level underground parking 
structure and 9,000 square feet of retail space. 
</P>
<P>
Janss began work on the project more than two years ago and received approval 
in January from the Board of Directors despite objections from the city's 
Endowment Advisory Commission and the new citizens group, Pasadena Century 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
Members of both groups said the city should not sell the property but should 
establish a 50-50 partnership with Janss. The cost of rehabilitating the police 
building for housing was too high and the city money could be better spent 
elsewhere, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of what we thought would happen; it's not surprising," said 
Endowment Advisory Commission member Sally Mosher about the state denial of 
funding. "But we're not going to stand around and say, 'We told you so.' "

HOUSE-SIZE LIMITS EXTENDED

The City Council on Monday extended and liberalized a moratorium that limits 
the size of additions to single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 4 to 1 to extend for another 10 1/2 months a 45-day 
moratorium that had limited the size of room additions to 50% of the total 
existing floor area. Councilman Steve Herfert voted no. 
</P>
<P>
Planning Director Pat Haley said the original 45-day moratorium was too 
restrictive for property owners with small homes on large lots. The moratorium 
will allow additions on a sliding scale ranging from double to triple the 
original floor area, depending on lot size. The ordinance also calls for wider 
second-story front, side and rear setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Haley said that the ordinance was created to stop mansionization and to make 
homes compatible with other neighborhood homes. She described mansionization as 
the tearing down or remodeling of houses to replace them with larger ones. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance will serve as a temporary solution while a permanent ordinance is 
being prepared, Haley said. The effort to scale down the size of homes came 
after the city received proposals in July for a 7,400-square-foot addition to a 
4,280-square-foot home, and an expansion of 8,868 square feet on an acre lot 
that would have given the house 10 bedrooms. Both houses are on Merced Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new ordinance, the two applicants will be allowed to add rooms 
totaling 100% of the existing floor area. 
</P>
<P>
Panee McDonagh, who submitted the 10-bedroom proposal, said she was told when 
she moved to West Covina that she could build up to 35% of the lot size, and 
has already spent $35,000 on architectural fees. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 10 people in my family, and everyone wants their own room," she 
said. "Everyone should remember when they were young and wanted their own 
room."

FIRM SCRAPS PLANS FOR GOLF COURSE IN TOPANGA; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: THE PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDED A HOUSING PROJECT. BANKS WERE RELUCTANT 
TO PROVIDE LOANS BECAUSE OF STRONG COMMUNITY OPPOSITION.

<P>
Representatives of the Japan-based Tohshin Co. say the firm will not proceed 
with plans for a controversial golf course and housing project in Topanga 
Canyon because obstacles to the project have deterred lenders. 
</P>
<P>
Yuji Kanda, the general manager of Tohshin Co.'s California office, said 
Tuesday that company officials have decided not to buy the 257-acre Montevideo 
Country Club site from developer Christopher Wojciechowski, who filed for 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The site is along the west side of Topanga Canyon Boulevard, across from the 
Viewridge subdivision and about three miles south of Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese banks were reluctant to finance the purchase because of the strong 
community opposition, and because five county permits are still needed before 
construction can begin, said a Tohshin consultant who advised the company on 
the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Godshall, an attorney representing Montevideo Country Club Inc., refused 
to comment on Tohshin's decision. A bankruptcy court hearing is scheduled today 
to discuss "a potential sale," he said, but he declined to disclose the 
potential purchaser. 
</P>
<P>
Tohshin backed out of the deal late last month, the evening before the 
purchasing agreement was scheduled to be ratified by the federal bankruptcy 
court with jurisdiction over Wojciechowski's assets. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was a slam-dunk deal it would be all right, but to go through all that 
hassle, the numbers didn't make sense," said the Tohshin consultant, who spoke 
on the condition that he not be identified by name. 
</P>
<P>
The sale had been contingent on Wojciechowski's obtaining five Los Angeles 
County permits for the project, including a conditional-use permit, a zoning 
permit, an area plan amendment and an oak tree removal permit. 
</P>
<P>
Tohshin was planning to pay $22 million for the land and an additional $14 
million when the necessary permits were obtained, the consultant said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the county was probably going to require the developer to improve 
Topanga Canyon Road and install a sewage system as a condition for approval, 
which he said would cut into potential profits. 
</P>
<P>
"The costs were going to be quite substantial," he said. "The whole project is 
barely economically feasible." 
</P>
<P>
Tohshin wanted to develop a golf course that could be certified as a tournament 
level course by the Professional Golfers' Assn. But several golf course 
designers advised the company that the proposed course probably would not meet 
that standard, the consultant said. 
</P>
<P>
Wojciechowski's plan to turn the rolling, oak-tree dotted meadow into the 
premier private recreation project in the Santa Monica Mountains has been a 
long-running controversy in Topanga. Some residents supported the project -- 
which had called for a hotel, a museum and a shopping mall -- saying it would 
bring services and permanent open space to the canyon, but others adamantly 
opposed altering the natural beauty of the land. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents waged a fierce battle in county hearing rooms. County supervisors 
ultimately rejected plans for a hotel and shopping mall and forced the 
developer to scale back the housing. 
</P>
<P>
When Wojciechowski filed for bankruptcy last year, many Topanga residents hoped 
the project was dead. But announcements that Tohshin planned to purchase the 
site and proceed with the golf course and housing rekindled the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to deter Tohshin from buying the land, members of the Topanga 
Assn. for a Scenic Community deluged the company with postcards. According to 
Bob Bates, president of the organization, the preprinted postcards said many 
Topanga residents were staunchly opposed. 
</P>
<P>
Bates said about 1,000 people sent postcards to the company's Los Angeles 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Kanda said the company was surprised at the amount of opposition. But the 
Tohshin consultant said the opposition merely "tipped the scales." 
</P>
<P>
The primary reason for the decision, however, was simply that Japanese banks 
were "not that enthusiastic" about the project, the consultant said.

NIGHTCLUB SETTLES CLAIM OF SEX BIAS; 
</P>
<P>
HOLLYWOOD: THE FLORENTINE GARDENS AGREES TO STOP 'SKIRT NIGHT' AND OTHER 
PROMOTIONS THAT ADMITTED WOMEN FOR FREE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A popular Hollywood nightclub has agreed to end its "Skirt Night" and all other 
promotions designed to let women in for free as part of an out-of-court 
settlement of a sex discrimination lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed by two men and a woman who said it was unfair and illegal to 
allow women in skirts into the Florentine Gardens club for free on certain 
nights while forcing men, and women without skirts, to pay a cover charge. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the settlement, made public late last week, Florentine 
Gardens agreed to immediately stop all promotions and practices based on sex, 
and promised to have no gender-based discounts in the future. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, plaintiffs Andrew Exler of Palm Springs, Dennis Koire of Anaheim 
and Julie Palasco of Los Angeles agreed to drop their Superior Court lawsuit, 
which was scheduled to go to trial next week. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an important victory for the equal rights of men, who are entitled to 
the same accommodations and privileges as women," Exler said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of clubs that are doing these types of promotions, five years 
after the state Supreme Court ruled they are illegal," Exler said. "I hope that 
this settlement will encourage other California businesses to immediately cease 
'women only' promotions." 
</P>
<P>
Florentine Gardens, at 5951 Hollywood Blvd., is particularly popular with area 
college students, but its admission practices have gotten it into trouble from 
time to time. Last year, students from several area colleges accused the club 
of having denied entry to Asian students on the basis of race. 
</P>
<P>
In the sex discrimination suit, filed in February, the three plaintiffs alleged 
that they were told they would have to pay $10 each to get into the club during 
a "Skirt Night" promotion last December because they were not wearing skirts. 
</P>
<P>
The three had been seeking $1 million in punitive damages and no less than $250 
in actual damages from the club for "humiliation and degradation." 
</P>
<P>
David M. Brown, a lawyer for the nightclub, said the club has already stopped 
promotions that allow women in free. He also said the club agreed to pay 
damages of $250 per plaintiff as required by the state Unruh Civil Rights Act, 
which prohibits businesses from discriminating on the basis of sex, race or any 
other arbitrary characteristic. 
</P>
<P>
When the sex discrimination suit was filed, Brown described it as being 
frivolous, saying: "Our response is this: that when we stop laughing, we'll 
respond. I suppose this means we couldn't have a green hat day either." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said Monday that settling out of court was not an admission of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
The skirt night case "was not worth contesting for my client, as a matter of 
business," Brown said. However, Brown said the promotion did not violate the 
Unruh Act. He disputed the allegations by the plaintiffs, saying anyone, male 
or female, wearing a skirt could have gotten in free. 
</P>
<P>
In June of this year, the club resolved its differences with Asian students who 
had claimed race discrimination when they were refused entry to the club on 
several occasions in 1989. The students had contended that the club's security 
personnel were denying them admission on Thursday "University Nights" by 
selectively applying an unspecified dress code. 
</P>
<P>
Students from Occidental College, protesting what they described as informal 
racial quotas at Florentine Gardens, enlisted the aid of the American Civil 
Liberties Union and university administrators to get the club to change its 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
Although the club denied ever discriminating on the basis of race, it promised 
the ACLU during negotiations that it would implement procedures that would be 
less likely to result in arbitrary exclusions, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The sex discrimination case settled last week was the latest victory for Exler, 
a 29-year-old legal assistant who has filed several such lawsuits aimed at 
stopping discrimination based on gender or sexual orientation. He said his 
share of the award would be donated to the Los Angeles chapter of the Gay &amp; 
Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, a media watch group that monitors the 
portrayal of lesbians and gay men in the media. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1989, Exler sued a resort nightclub near Palm Springs for allegedly 
refusing to admit him to a male exotic dance show, but the case was thrown out. 
In June, 1988, Exler sued the Chippendales nightclub in Los Angeles for 
allegedly barring him and two friends from entering the male strip show. This 
year, he won an out-of-court settlement in which the club offered an apology 
and promised to admit male patrons, he said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1984, he made national headlines by winning a suit against Disneyland 
for refusing to allow him to dance with another man at the park. 
</P>
<P>
In the sex discrimination case, lawyers chastised Exler for being a 
professional litigant who sued for publicity reasons. Exler said he only files 
lawsuits when he feels he has good reason.

HOBBY: A RETIRED DISNEY ANIMATOR IS GIVING A RAILWAY MUSEUM SOME RAIL CARS THAT 
ONCE CHUGGED THROUGH HIS BACK YARD.

<P>
After more than 50 years of running the Grizzly Flats Railroad right in his 
back yard, Ward Kimball is preparing to hear the whistle blow for the last 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The retired Walt Disney Co. animator is donating the line -- two real, 
full-sized working locomotives, a passenger car, a boxcar, a flat-bottomed 
gondola and a wooden cattle car -- to the Orange Empire Railway Museum in 
Riverside County. The museum also plans to display Grizzly Flats' 
Victorian-style depot, windmill and water tower, as well as 900 feet of track 
-- all currently behind Kimball's home in an unincorporated area near San 
Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to find a place for it while I could still get around," said the 
76-year-old Kimball, who has been playing with trains ever since he and his 
wife, Betty, bought a locomotive from the Nevada Central Railroad in 1938 and 
shipped it to their house. "I wanted to be involved in the project and to 
ensure that Grizzly Flats had a good home." 
</P>
<P>
The museum has about 140 pieces of railway equipment, including some of the old 
Red Car trolleys operated in Southern California by the Pacific Electric 
Railway from the early 1900s through 1963. 
</P>
<P>
"Kimball's trains feature a unique aspect of railroad history," said Tom 
Jacobson, president of the museum. "It is a significant addition to our 
collection." The trains are notable because they were designed to run on 
narrower tracks than the standard trains of today -- 3 feet versus 4 feet, 8 
1/2 inches. Kimball collected them as the era of "narrow-gauge railroading" in 
the West came to an end. 
</P>
<P>
Kimball has also donated as much as $100,000 to the museum to build a steel 
engine house to store the trains. The first of the line is expected to be moved 
to the museum next fall. The transfer of the entire collection will take 
several years to complete, Kimball said. 
</P>
<P>
The train enthusiast said he mulled several offers to house his collection, 
including one from the Greenfield Village and Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, 
Mich. In the end, he selected the Orange Empire museum, where he has been a 
longtime member, because it is close to home. 
</P>
<P>
"It was close enough that I could still have a little fun with it," Kimball 
said. "I figure I've still got a good 15 years in me."

SOARING AIRPORT RENTS SQUEEZE OUT SMALL PLANES; 
</P>
<P>
AVIATION: PROPELLER AIRCRAFT ARE BEING REPLACED BY COMPANY JETS IN AN 
EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS IN WHICH ONLY THE ECONOMICALLY FIT SURVIVE.

<P>
On the afternoon of Dec. 7, 1941, hours after Japanese bombers struck Pearl 
Harbor, U.S. Army officers drove up to Van Nuys Airport and commandeered the 
dirt-strip airfield for the war effort. 
</P>
<P>
In less than a month, the sleepy country airport was transformed into a 
bustling military complex. 
</P>
<P>
The changes taking place these days at the central San Fernando Valley airfield 
are occurring more slowly than those rushed through 49 years ago by the Air 
Corps. 
</P>
<P>
But many in the aviation community think that over time, they will be as 
dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the Air Force moved out after the war, Van Nuys Airport has served 
as a training ground and playground for tens of thousands of private pilots. As 
a result, the Los Angeles city-owned facility has long been the world's busiest 
general aviation field and is the seventh-busiest airport in the nation, 
although it has no scheduled commercial air service. 
</P>
<P>
Trends suggest that a decade from now the airport will be as much an office 
complex as an aviation facility. And although it might still lead the nation in 
takeoffs and landings 10 years from now, weekend pleasure fliers with their 
Cessnas and Pipers will have been largely replaced by private jets. 
</P>
<P>
Both trends began about a decade ago and homeowners, pleasure pilots and 
airport officials disagree over whether airport managers should allow the 
trends to continue or seek to reverse them. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, there were 1,333 piston-engine planes at Van Nuys Airport; today there 
are only 711. 
</P>
<P>
During the same 11 years, the number of jets based at the airport grew from 18 
to 93. 
</P>
<P>
The jets seem to be winning out for scarce space at the airport through a 
Darwinian process in which only the economically fittest survive. 
</P>
<P>
The airport does not rent space directly to airplane owners. Instead, it rents 
land to aircraft-related businesses and leaves it largely up to them whether 
they will cater to jets or piston craft. 
</P>
<P>
Business operators say that renting and servicing jets, and leasing space for 
jets, which are favored by corporate executives and high rollers who don't 
blink at spending thousands of dollars an hour to get somewhere in a hurry and 
are willing to pay higher rates, is far more profitable than doing business 
with owners of piston craft. 
</P>
<P>
The list of regular jet users at Van Nuys Airport includes many of Southern 
California's biggest employers -- Litton Industries, Hughes Aircraft, General 
Motors, Great Western Savings. Also regularly appearing on the airport's flight 
log are many of the Southland's movers and shakers: sports and publishing mogul 
Jack Kent Cooke, Chatsworth computer chip maker Tandon Jawahar and former 
President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials agree that pitting jets against pistons sometimes seems to be 
an unfair contest, particularly since pleasure fliers who use piston engines 
have already been buffeted during the 1980s by sharply higher insurance and 
maintenance costs. 
</P>
<P>
But the officials nonetheless characterize the advances made by jets as being 
as natural as the triumph of weeds over flowers in an untended garden. 
</P>
<P>
"As a government agency, we cannot give anything away," said airport Manager 
Charles Zeman. "We have to get fair market value for the land we rent out to 
fixed-base operators." 
</P>
<P>
Under contracts with tenants, the airport raises its rent every five years. 
Last February, the cost per acre was increased to $14,000 per year, up 32% from 
the $10,600 set in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
That has resulted in the fixed-base operators charging an average tie-down rate 
of $120 a month for a single-engine plane at Van Nuys Airport compared to $72 a 
month for Santa Monica Municipal Airport and $76 a month for Whiteman Airport 
in Pacoima. Zeman said the higher rate at Van Nuys "sounds a lot more 
reasonable when you compare the facilities here with other airports," citing 
what he said were superior repair and maintenance facilities, firefighting 
apparatus and security patrols. 
</P>
<P>
But Lee Kanon Alpert, chairman of the Van Nuys Airport Citizens Advisory 
Council, said that the small planes are leaving for other fields because 
airport officials "have jacked up the rents so high that the cost of a tie-down 
has gone through the roof." 
</P>
<P>
He advocates a two-tiered rental system in which operators that rent to owners 
of piston-engine planes would pay less rent than those that serve jet owners. 
</P>
<P>
"That way you could serve the entire aviation community and still keep adequate 
revenue coming in," Alpert said. "But I would be surprised if the Department of 
Airports went for that because everything they do seems oriented to maximizing 
income." 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials say that a two-tiered plan would be difficult to administer, 
since many of the airport operators service both jets and piston-engine planes. 
</P>
<P>
The same economic forces that are bringing in more jets are bringing about the 
transformation of much of the 735-acre airport into an office and hotel 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Airport Commissioners, which runs the city's airports, is pushing 
for Van Nuys Airport to generate more income in anticipation of the December, 
1992, expiration of long-term contracts that benefit commercial airlines. Those 
contracts obligate the city to use revenue in excess of airport operating costs 
to lower landing fees at Los Angeles International and Ontario airports. 
</P>
<P>
Once those contracts expire, however, airport revenue in excess of costs could 
be used to help pay for general city operations. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hearing from some council members, including more than one from the 
valley, who want to see us make a profit on airports as soon as we can," said 
airport Commissioner Samuel Greenberg. He declined to identify which council 
members he was referring to. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the 1980s, the department has allowed small parcels of land on the 
airport's perimeter to be leased for mostly single-building commercial 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, the pace of commercial development has accelerated. 
</P>
<P>
In April, a consultant recommended that a massive office complex be developed 
at the former Air National Guard site on Balboa Boulevard. A report said the 1 
million square feet of office space would generate $4.7 million a year in lease 
income, more than half the airport's $8.2 million in revenue during the fiscal 
year that ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
The board shelved the plan without comment after homeowners protested that it 
would produce massive traffic tie-ups on Balboa and Roscoe boulevards. Further, 
aviation enthusiasts complained because only 16 acres of the base's 94 acres in 
the airport's northwest corner would be set aside for parking and servicing 
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
The department staff is expected to make a new recommendation for the site in 
about six months. 
</P>
<P>
While that site's future remains clouded, the commission has tentatively 
approved a 123,000-square-foot mixed-use development on Valjean Avenue north of 
the Van Nuys Airtel Plaza Hotel, and has reacted favorably to another proposed 
project of about the same size on Hayvenhurst Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Airport staff members are negotiating with both developers. 
</P>
<P>
Also under consideration are two competing proposals for a 38-acre site on 
Woodley Avenue being vacated by Volpar Aircraft Corp. Each plan contains more 
than 700,000 square feet of office space and about one-fourth that much for 
hangars. 
</P>
<P>
If all the suggested plans are allowed to go through, Zeman predicted, the 
airport could produce a profit for the city of about $8 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
"These development plans are ridiculous," said Don Schultz, president of the 
Van Nuys Homeowners Assn. and founder of the anti-noise group Ban Airport 
Noise. 
</P>
<P>
"They are way too intensive for our area. Getting in and out on Woodley is 
tough already, and these would make it all but impossible." 
</P>
<P>
He said the homeowner group does not object to mixed-use development. "But we 
oppose the massive size of these plans," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the fate of proposed large-scale developments on airport property 
is likely to rest with the council, which has given no public indication of how 
it feels about generating revenue from the airport. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, under homeowner pressure, the council rezoned the airport's 735 acres 
to require that a conditional-use permit be obtained for any development larger 
than 10,000 square feet. All such permits can be appealed to the council. 
</P>
<P>
Zeman acknowledged that the council might pull the airport commission up short 
in its move to develop the airport property with high-yield office projects. 
</P>
<P>
"It remains to be seen how this will play itself out," he said. "I'm sure that 
over time we will evolve more into a revenue-generating facility, but I can't 
predict how soon that will happen or to what extent."

AFIELD: DESERT HIKES; 
</P>
<P>
THERE'S NOT MUCH AT ANZA-BORREGO -- THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY SCHAD, Jerry Schad is an outdoor enthusiast, educator and author of 
books on hiking and cycling in San Diego County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stark and barren, yet beautiful in their nakedness, Anza-Borrego's skeletal 
mountain ranges conceal more than they reveal to casual passers-by. If you want 
to know them better, you must leave the security of the automotive cocoon and 
start walking -- up a canyon or a wash, or onto a hardscrabble ridge sweeping 
upward into the fierce blue sky. 
</P>
<P>
Out there you can experience the essence of the desert -- the palpable force of 
the sun's heat and pure white light; the throat-drying air; the prick of a 
cactus spine; the profound silence. 
</P>
<P>
The southern spurs of the Santa Rosa Mountains are as good a place as any to 
discover the wilderness of Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. Midday temperatures 
have declined from the 110-115 degrees typical of July and August to a 
comfortably toasty 80-85 degrees, so November is a perfect time to spend an 
hour, or even a whole day, following any or all of the hikes listed below. 
</P>
<P>
Wear hiking boots (if you have them) to keep cactus spines at bay, and carry at 
least one pint of water for each hour of hiking. Even though the sun has 
retreated quite far south by now, sun-shielding clothing is still a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
All three walks listed below originate along the same paved road, 
Borrego-Salton Seaway (County Highway S-22), about 18 miles east of Borrego 
Springs. The mileages referred to in the descriptions below are keyed to the 
green mile-markers spaced each mile along this highway. 
</P>
<P>
Palo Verde Wash/Canyon 
</P>
<P>
At mile 32.9, the highway dips to cross a dry riverbed. This is Palo Verde 
Wash, named for the palo verde trees that dot its course. You can park on the 
road shoulder nearby. Follow the wash generally north toward a prominent cut in 
the mountains ahead -- Palo Verde Canyon. You'll find the wash is "braided"; it 
consists of multiple channels cut during past flash floods. Just keep close to 
the middle to stay on course. After about one mile of walking, you can make a 
short side trip over to some low ridge spurs to the left (west), where you 
might find some nice examples of the multiheaded cottonpro cactus, a locally 
rare, barrel-cactus look-alike. 
</P>
<P>
After 1.3 miles, the canyon walls begin to close in on both sides and travel 
slows a bit as you're forced to step over more and bigger rocks. Progress up 
the canyon ends after 3 miles, at which point you'll find yourself in the 
bottom of a bowl flanked on three sides by sheer walls soaring over 400 feet 
high. At intervals of several years or longer, flash floods tear through here, 
creating for a brief time a terrific waterfall on the west wall. 
</P>
<P>
Smoke Tree Wash Canyon 
</P>
<P>
The highway dips to cross broad, sandy Smoke Tree Wash at mile 34.6, about 0.2 
mile west of the signed entrance to Arroyo Salado Primitive Camp. Rather flat 
and easy to walk at first, the wash progressively narrows to what becomes, at 
2.3 miles, a fissure overhung by menacing conglomerate cliffs (definitely not a 
good place to be during an earthquake). Up the canyon another half mile, look 
for a major side canyon on the right, heading northeast. Scramble up this side 
canyon a short distance to discover the Natural Rock Tanks -- large depressions 
in the bedrock created by the scouring action of flash floods. The tanks can 
hold water for weeks or months after major storms, temporarily meeting the 
needs of the local population of bighorn sheep and other creatures. Don't 
expect them to be wet this month, unless a storm or two comes along with plenty 
of much-needed rain. 
</P>
<P>
Ella Wash/Coachwhip Canyon 
</P>
<P>
A sandy road, which may or may not be suitable for standard passenger cars, 
goes up Ella Wash and Coachwhip Canyon for about 1 mile. (This road intersects 
the highway at mile 34.8, just west of the Arroyo Salado Primitive Camp 
entrance.) Wraith-like thickets of smoke trees adorn the canyon's lower end, 
which is framed by sandstone formations. 
</P>
<P>
As you proceed farther into many-fingered Coachwhip Canyon, take the time to 
explore several of its more intriguing tributaries. From some of these ravines 
it's possible to scramble to the top of the headwall that surrounds the area on 
the north. There you can either be satisfied with the spectacular view across 
the Borrego Badlands to the south, or continue climbing north up one of the 
ridgelines toward the crest of the Santa Rosas, miles away and thousands of 
feet higher.

STATIONS SEEK NICHE AMONG THE COMMUTERS, SUNBATHERS

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BRASS, Kevin Brass writes about media for The Times. His column 
appears Mondays in Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the eyes of radio industry veteran Tom Holiday, the North County is an array 
of niches and valleys, a landscape dotted with opportunity and complications. 
</P>
<P>
"It is like the face of a Thomas Brothers English muffin," said Holiday, 
general manager of two North County-based stations, KOWF-FM (92.1) and KSPA-AM 
(1450). 
</P>
<P>
Something as basic as delivering signals over the hills and through the canyons 
and into the homes and cars of listeners becomes a challenge. His advice: "If 
you can't get a station, simply walk across the street." 
</P>
<P>
Holiday's operation is based in Escondido, which is also known as the "Hidden 
Valley" -- not the type of nickname a radio executive likes to hear. Like all 
North County radio stations, Holiday is constantly struggling to make people 
understand that the hoppin' country tunes of his popular FM station can be 
heard beyond the hills of Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Holiday's, there are five other radio operations in the North 
County, each attempting to find its own niche in the swirl of the Southern 
California radio market. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of tuning in far-off stations, an Encinitas resident can jam to the 
rock of "Magic 102" or the Top 40 hits of KKOS-FM (95.9), which is "North 
County and proud of it." Also programmed from bases in North County: mellow 
tunes, business news, religious programming and golden oldies. 
</P>
<P>
In a very real sense, North County is a distinct market, separated from urban 
San Diego by marketing strategies, as well as geography. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, North County basically seceded from San Diego, when Arbitron, the 
company that compiles ratings for stations throughout the country, began 
issuing a separate "book" for North County. The move came after heavy lobbying 
from North County radio executives, who didn't feel the San Diego ratings 
accurately reflected their home. 
</P>
<P>
Alone, North County is the 62nd largest of the 252 markets in the country, 
according to Arbitron, comparable in size to Las Vegas and Austin, Tex. Unlike 
Las Vegas or Austin, the area is not isolated; it's not an island. In addition 
to San Diego stations, powerful Los Angeles stations are easily picked up by 
North County residents, many of whom have recently moved from Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
The intrusion of Los Angeles stations is simply one quirk in a very quirky 
radio market. Of course, quirky is not necessarily a negative to radio industry 
and marketing professionals, who try to use an area's special characteristics 
to attract listeners and advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
"The North County is one reason we're pouring a million dollars into 
(upgrading) our AM signal to 50,000 watts at night," said Paul Palmer, general 
manager of KFMB-AM (760) and FM (B100). "With growth, we wanted to be even 
stronger there." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer and others are simply responding to the numbers game that powers the 
radio industry. Rating numbers decide whether a station is succeeding or 
failing. Demographic numbers -- data about the population, ranging from the 
number of people and their ages to the amount of money they earn -- dictate the 
potential of a market. 
</P>
<P>
Those numbers for North County look good: The area's population increased from 
288,979 to 616,793 in the 1980s, according to the San Diego Assn. of 
Governments, making it one of the fastest-growing markets in the country. Most 
of the influx, marketing experts say, came in the form of upwardly mobile, 
middle-class, young families. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people perceive it as fairly upscale," said Nancy Duvall, media director 
for Chapman/Warwick, an advertising and public relations firm. "There is a good 
strong Baby-Boomer group." 
</P>
<P>
Along with the population growth have come hundreds of new businesses that want 
to advertise their presence. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of retail sales is incredible," said Jeff Chandler, owner of 
KKOS-FM and KCEO-AM (1000) in Carlsbad. "If you look at what was here 15 years 
ago, it was just the Plaza Camino Real (shopping center) and a whole bunch of 
car dealers." 
</P>
<P>
Revenues of radio stations throughout the county, North County included, have 
increased dramatically in the last few years, even surpassing the pace of the 
county's growth. According to figures compiled by the San Diego Broadcasters 
Assn., the earnings of San Diego stations have grown by 10% to 20% a year for 
the past few years, one of the fastest rates of growth in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic jams help explain the increase. 
</P>
<P>
People listen to their radios in their cars, which is one reason Los Angeles is 
such a powerful radio market. As the San Diego freeways increasingly resemble 
Los Angeles freeways, the radio audience has grown. 
</P>
<P>
North County is a patchwork of suburban communities whose residents get in 
their cars to go to work five days a week, and who on their off days go to 
beaches and parks -- prime activities to match with radio listening. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, even the emphasis on the automobile has its quirks for North County 
radio stations, according to some radio executives. Arbitron distributes its 
ratings diaries based on ZIP codes. But many of those holding North County 
diaries, the theory goes, get in their cars and drive to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"If they listen in San Diego, it's not a fair representation for us," said Greg 
Stevens, program director for KGMG-FM (Magic 102). 
</P>
<P>
But the numbers don't lie. There is no downplaying the size or importance of 
the North County audience. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like the whole market has grown up with the population growth," said 
Dave Ruhlman, who spent 13 years as co-owner and general manager of KOWN (now 
KOWF), before taking over the reins of KPRZ (1210), a religious station based 
in San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
While there are few dominant personalities at the North County stations, the 
level of professionalism both on and off the air has increased in recent years. 
Industry veterans, such as former KFMB-FM personality Scott Kenyon at KKOS-FM 
and Greg Stevens of Magic 102, are key players. 
</P>
<P>
Each North County station has its own programming niche -- from the Top 40 rock 
of KKOS-FM to the country of KOWF. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the few markets I've been in that is under-radioed," said Bob 
Jacobson, general manager of KMLO (107.1). "There is no duplication; 
advertisers have a better opportunity to target an audience." 
</P>
<P>
Each of the North County-based stations approaches the market differently. 
</P>
<P>
KGMG-FM, for example, often seems to be trying to detach itself from its North 
County roots. Although it is based in Oceanside, the FM has an "auxiliary 
studio" in Kearny Mesa and it has been attempting to move its transmitter tower 
farther south, in order to better reach San Diego. Last year it installed 
"repeaters" in San Diego, which helped boost its signal in previously 
hard-to-reach areas. 
</P>
<P>
It's not so much that Magic 102 wants to disown its North County base, program 
director Greg Stevens said, it just doesn't want to limit itself to one area. 
</P>
<P>
When he first arrived in North County, the station "scrupulously avoided 
talking about North County exclusively," Stevens said. "Our way not to be 
limited to the North County was to ignore it on the air. That was a little 
naive of us." 
</P>
<P>
Magic executives don't feel they should be limited to North County, simply 
because that's where their transmitter is located and their Federal 
Communications Commission license carries an Oceanside address. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where KGB's transmitter is located, but they're not out there 
saying, 'We're Spring Valley and we're proud of it,' " Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the other North County stations focus on their home area simply because 
they have no other choice. Their signals are not as strong as Magic's, making 
it difficult for them to reach into San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The Fallbrook-based KMLO doesn't even dream of reaching San Diego with its 
mellow music format. But it does covet the audience in the rapidly growing 
Temecula Valley in Riverside County to the north. 
</P>
<P>
"Our station is uniquely situated to serve both counties," said KMLO's 
Jacobson. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the North County stations are identifiable as North County 
by their advertisements and news, which tend to be localized. 
</P>
<P>
"Our emphasis on being a North County station is primarily in the information 
we give listeners," said Holiday of KOWF. "Our listeners already know (we're 
based in the North), so we focus on information." 
</P>
<P>
More than satisfied to be thought of as a North County station, he has no 
burning desire to try to move his signal into urban San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time we develop ourselves as North County's country station and 
saturated our potential here," Holiday said, "there is going to be a population 
shift and most of the county's population will be in the North County. Then why 
bother?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Signals From North County 
</P>
<P>
Although a North County resident with a solid antenna can pick up dozens of 
stations from as far away as Mexico and Los Angeles, there are only five 
operations that call the area home: 
</P>
<P>
KKOS-FM (95.9): With Scott Kenyon, formerly a member of B100's Rich Brothers, 
helping to shape the musical format, this ratings power is clearly hoping its 
Top 40/contemporary format will take a slice out of B100's large young-adult 
market. 
</P>
<P>
KCEO-AM (1000): The AM sister to KKOS, it programs business and financial news. 
</P>
<P>
KGMG-FM (Magic 102): Recently switched to more of an album-oriented rock format 
after three years as a classic rock station. Morning show is called "The Rude 
Boys." 
</P>
<P>
KGMG-AM (1320): Recently switched to an "easy listening" format. 
</P>
<P>
KPRZ-AM (1210): North County's newest station features religious programming. 
</P>
<P>
KOWF-FM (92.1): The "KOW" is attempting to be North County's country station, 
battling the San Diego-based KSON-FM (97.3) for the foot-stomping hearts of 
North Countians. 
</P>
<P>
KSPA-AM (1450): The AM sister to KOWF calls itself the "Station of the Stars," 
programming middle-of-the-road hits from such artists as Frank Sinatra, Robert 
Goulet and Jack Jones.

A PET SHOP WHERE THE SQUEAMISH GO FOR CURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURINA SHERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a scene out of your worst nightmare. Thousands of snakes, lizards -- 
reptiles of all kinds -- crawling and writhing and slithering about in a space 
the size of a living room. It's enough to make Indiana Jones, or any 
ophidiophobe, go down for the count. 
</P>
<P>
There are albino Burmese pythons. And seven-foot green anacondas. And 
Colombian, Brazilian, and Argentine rainbow boas. There are tree boas, milk 
snakes, rat snakes, corn snakes, Carpet pythons and Baja rosey boas. Iguanas, 
monitors, skinks and chameleons are also scattered about. Any cold-blooded 
little crawly thing that your warm-blooded heart could desire. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido's Reptile Haven, 2205 E. Valley Parkway, is one of only a handful of 
reptile "pet" stores in the United States. It specializes in more than 100 
species of snakes, tortoises, turtles, lizards and amphibians. At second glance 
(if you make it to second glance, that is), it is apparent that all of these 
beguiling beasts are safely behind glass or in aquariums -- save a 
less-than-frightening tortoise or two -- making it possible for visitors to 
browse the aisles and keep a comfortable distance while feigning bravery. 
</P>
<P>
It is just this discomfort and fear that brings many of Reptile Haven's patrons 
to its doors for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people come in to get over their phobia," says owner Chris Estep. "A 
couple of months ago two little old ladies came in. They were shaking at the 
door. They have 20 snakes now. They're really into it." 
</P>
<P>
Reptile Haven has gotten downright educational about this phobia. It has taken 
some of its specimens to psychology classes at Palomar College at which 
students overcome their fears by handling the animals. 
</P>
<P>
"We start out real slow," said Estep. "First, they look at (the reptiles) for a 
while, and then someone else holds (the reptiles) in front of them, and then 
they start at the tail and pet them, and, before you know it most of them are 
holding them and they feel good with them." 
</P>
<P>
Estep insists that, once people overcome their fear, reptiles can be wonderful 
pets. What, exactly, are some qualities that make snakes good pets? 
</P>
<P>
"They hold onto you and constrict around your arm," said Estep. "They're real 
slow moving, so they don't run away from you." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps some people find a constricting snake endearing. For those who wish it 
were a little faster-moving so it could run away from them, there are other 
options. Like iguanas or tortoises. 
</P>
<P>
"Tortoises are my No. 1 love," Estep said. "We have a huge breeding colony set 
up in Lakeside for super-rare tortoises. They're great." They're so great, in 
fact, that Estep is looking for another location to expand his enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a way of looking right into your eyes," he said. "They're really 
personable." 
</P>
<P>
"Tortoises definitely have a lot of character, and are really smart. They'll 
come out of their hiding places in the back yard to see what you're doing." 
Estep points out that tortoises eat mostly vegetation, and they're not 
aggressive when they eat. "They don't seem as bloodthirsty as snakes -- not so 
cold-blooded. They're really docile. Very few people have been hurt by them," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Estep doesn't have any pet reptiles at home, he maintains they make 
better pets than cats or dogs. 
</P>
<P>
"They're low-maintenance pets," he said. "You can leave your pet snake for a 
month if you fill his water bowl before you leave, and, when you come back 
he'll be the same way, other than the droppings in the cage. You can't do that 
with a dog." 
</P>
<P>
This low maintenance was one of the draws for Estep to open Reptile Haven. When 
he opened the doors in June, 1987, Estep also owned A Bird Haven, a few doors 
down. 
</P>
<P>
"With the bird shop, I had to do a lot of work every day," he said. "Here, I 
can take off for three or four days, and, when I come back, other than it being 
a little messier, they're going to be alive." 
</P>
<P>
Reptiles' low susceptibility to virus and disease is another advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"The bird shop got wiped out three times. Everything in the whole shop died" 
because of a severe and fast-moving virus, Estep said. With snakes, however, 
viruses are rarely transmitted between species. 
</P>
<P>
As far as personality goes, however, reptiles fail miserably. "Snakes have the 
least personality," Estep said. "Most people have a snake for a year or so, 
then switch over to a lizard or a tortoise." 
</P>
<P>
Lizards are the most congenial of the lot. "If you raise an iguana from a baby, 
he'll follow you around the house and react to you more than a snake will," 
Estep said. 
</P>
<P>
Everything sold at Reptile Haven is legal to own. But the manner in which you 
handle and display your acquisition is a little tricky if you want to remain 
within the bounds of the law. Take the case of a 17-foot python. If a minor 
takes it out of its cage, it's illegal. If it is in your house, but out of its 
cage, it's illegal. And, the cage must have a padlock. 
</P>
<P>
"When people have pythons around their necks at the beach -- that's illegal," 
Estep said. "There's a ferocious beast law that covers it." 
</P>
<P>
Until last year, it was illegal in the city of San Diego to own any snake that 
reached over 4 feet. "They don't have that law anymore, because there are very 
few snakes that don't get over 4 feet," Estep said. "Even the king snakes get 4 
1/2 feet." 
</P>
<P>
Estep acknowledges the argument of environmentalists that snakes should be left 
in the wild, rather than kept in captivity. But he maintains that the trade in 
snakes as pets is less of a threat than other demands on the species. In 1988 
over half a million Salvator monitor lizards were killed for the skin trade, he 
said, contrasted with the 1,300 sold in the United States as pets. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Reptile Haven's snakes are bred in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
Some are imported from Africa, Central America, South America, and Asia. 
Reptile Haven exports some of its inventory, as well. This makes for a lot of 
paperwork, especially in the case of endangered species like the Madagascar 
tree boa, which sell for $5,000 a pair. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to sell them out of state, you have to fill out forms with the 
Department of the Interior so they can OK the sale," Estep said. "Normally, I 
don't like to do that because the paper work is not worth it. If you sell in 
California, all you have to do is give the people you sell to the same paper 
work you have. The government stuff takes about 40 days." 
</P>
<P>
And 40 days can make a big difference in shipping costs when you're dealing 
with live animals. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple years ago, we sold some stuff to Singapore," Estep said. "When I 
bought the snakes, they were 6 pounds, and when we shipped them they were 20 
pounds."

If you are among the many who believe macadamia nuts grow only in Hawaii, think 
again. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jim Russell, a local grower and president of the California 
Macadamia Nut Society, the first macadamia nut trees were brought from 
Australia's tropical rain forest to Berkeley in the 1890s. They were later 
introduced to Hawaii, where the nuts attained commercial recognition. Several 
decades later, the trees reappeared on the mainland, including in North County. 
Some varieties, such as the Cate, are ready for harvest in time for the 
holidays. Others produce almost year-round. 
</P>
<P>
Wilbur Simlik, a retired Marine general and owner of Macadamia Hill Ranch in 
Vista, has one of the oldest groves of Cate macadamias in the county. The 
original owner of the ranch, Wells Miller, brought back hundreds of macadamia 
seedlings from Australia and Hawaii in 1958. Records of his grafting 
experiments were kept by UC Riverside, and his grafts eventually made their way 
to Israel and Central America. 
</P>
<P>
"Macadamia trees are very independent," said Russell, a grower since 1978. 
"Every time you plant a seed, you get another variety. But, if you planted 
50,000, maybe only two would be good. That's why we graft them." 
</P>
<P>
Only two botanical varieties produce edible nuts, he said: the tetraphylla, a 
species well-suited to the California climate; and the integrifolia, which 
accounts for Hawaii's major production. 
</P>
<P>
The tetraphylla, which includes the Cate, a popular variety in North County, 
produces a larger, sweeter nut than the integrifolia. Russell said that 
macadamias aren't actually roasted in an oven, but deep fried in oil, "just 
like French fries." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Russell lost a grove of mature trees to freezing temperatures. The 
experience hasn't discouraged him from attempting to develop a hardier variety, 
however. "They're beautiful landscape trees," he said. "You can prune them if 
you want to, and they actually grow and yield fruit even in containers." 
</P>
<P>
Macadamia trees come in all shapes and sizes at Tom Cooper's Rancho Nuez in 
Fallbrook. "We planted a few trees after a friend introduced us to the 
macadamia in the late '60s, and we've been adding ever since," said Cooper, who 
publishes the Macadamia Nut Grower Quarterly. 
</P>
<P>
Like many consumers, Kitty Scholes, owner of the Bob-Kat Ranch in Fallbrook, 
thought that macadamias grew only in Hawaii until 1968, when a friend told her 
they thrived under local conditions. Over two decades later, Scholes acts as 
secretary-treasurer of the Gold Crown Macadamia Assn., a grower-owned and 
operated co-op in Fallbrook that ships macadamias all over the United States. 
The co-op now counts more than 160 growers, who all pool their macadamias in a 
Fallbrook warehouse. "There is no membership fee, and anyone with at least five 
trees may join," said Scholes. 
</P>
<P>
A gentle breeze rustles through the lush foliage of the extensive grove of Cate 
macadamias, as Scholes checks the clusters of nuts hanging from the limbs like 
large, green beads. Cates shed their husk as they hit the ground, and 
marble-sized nuts the color of milk-chocolate dot the thick mulch. 
</P>
<P>
The nuts are hand-gathered, then culled, once again by hand. After the nuts are 
run through a husking machine, they are air-dried for 2 or 3 weeks to get the 
moisture out. The growers then send nuts to the co-op in 50-pound sacks. 
</P>
<P>
Humans are not alone in enjoying macadamias. 
</P>
<P>
"Squirrels, coyotes, crows, rats and even bobcats all love macadamias," said 
Scholes. So do parrots and macaws, whose breeders have become regular customers 
of the macadamia co-op in Fallbrook. 
</P>
<P>
Macadamias contain no cholesterol. Unshelled, they keep up to a year. Nutmeats 
should be stored in an airtight container and refrigerated, or frozen until 
just before use. When thawing, don't open the container until the nuts have 
reached room temperature to avoid rehydration. Roasting or toasting also 
extends the shelf life of nutmeats. 
</P>
<P>
Macadamias are a good source of calcium and riboflavin.

BANNING GOES BACK TO BASICS, GUNNING FOR ANOTHER SHOT AT CARSON IN PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The way Banning High's football team has dominated recent opponents is 
reminiscent of the Pilots' glory days, says a longtime coach. 
</P>
<P>
"This is how it used to be when I first started coaching here," said defensive 
coordinator Rocky Garibay, a member of the staff during Banning's run of six 
consecutive L.A. City titles from 1976-81. "We have to call off the boys in the 
third quarter." 
</P>
<P>
A resurgence? Could be. 
</P>
<P>
Banning has put teams away early since losing to Carson, 41-14, Oct. 12. 
Sparked by a punishing ground game and suffocating defense, the Pilots have 
outscored their past four opponents, 166-33, allowing only six points in the 
last three games combined. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if we face (Carson) again, they're going to have their hands full," 
Garibay said. 
</P>
<P>
A rematch between the rivals is a distinct possibility. Carson (8-1) has been 
seeded first and Banning (6-3) second for the 4-A playoffs, meaning the teams 
could meet in the championship game. The playoffs begin Wednesday, but Carson 
and Banning have first-round byes. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally a running team, Banning seems to be emphasizing its ground game 
even more since the loss to Carson. The Pilots did not attempt a pass two weeks 
ago in a 49-0 victory over Gardena, instead relying on a deep and talented 
stable of runners led by senior tailback Travis Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally decided that's what we do best, so let's get good at it," Coach Joe 
Dominguez said. "Our last few games really haven't justified us throwing the 
ball; they got out of hand early. We're going to keep throwing the ball, but 
only when we want to." 
</P>
<P>
In Davis, the Pilot coaches believe they have a running back who compares 
favorably to the Banning greats. 
</P>
<P>
"I compare him to Freeman McNeil in high school because of his power and 
speed," Garibay said. "I think he's the best runner in California right now." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot, 180-pound senior has rushed for more than 200 yards in three 
consecutive games. Only in the season opener has Davis failed to reach 100 
yards in a game. 
</P>
<P>
But Dominguez points out that Davis isn't doing it all on his own. 
</P>
<P>
"The offensive line has just played super," he said. "Any kid who goes over 200 
yards three straight weeks has to be a great back, but the guys up front have 
to be doing something." 
</P>
<P>
Early in the season, Banning consistently ran to the right side, anchored by 
guard Eric Battle (6-3, 265), tackle Art Donnell (6-2, 290) and tight end Lino 
Quintana (6-2, 225). But recently, Dominguez said, the Pilots have been 
"running left, too." 
</P>
<P>
Most encouraging, Dominguez said, has been the team's steady improvement. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a completely different team than we were a month ago," he said. "When we 
watch a video from six or seven games ago, we say, 'Huh, that was us?' We 
played poorly against Carson. The kids realize that. I think they're looking 
forward to the playoffs more than us." 
</P>
<P>
Three of the South Bay's top basketball players are expected to sign national 
letters of intent with colleges during the early one-week signing period, which 
began Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Wyking Jones, a 6-7 forward for St. Bernard, will sign with Loyola Marymount; 
Frank Willis, a 6-8 forward for Leuzinger, will sign with New Mexico, and Roger 
Hendrix, a 6-6 forward for Rolling Hills, will sign with Utah State, according 
to their coaches. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard Coach Jim McClune said Jones is the first Viking basketball player 
in recent memory to sign directly out of high school with Loyola, which is 
about a mile from St. Bernard. Corey Gaines, a St. Bernard alumnus, played at 
Loyola after transferring from UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Jones also visited UCLA, Oregon, Oregon State and UC Santa Barbara, McClune 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Willis, who averaged 15 points and 10 rebounds a game last season, gave an oral 
commitment to New Mexico during a recruiting visit last weekend. He also took 
trips to Drake, San Diego State, Cal State Fullerton and Pepperdine, Leuzinger 
Coach Phil Sherman said. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa Coach Glenn Marx said Chris Davis, the Mustangs' highly touted 6-8 
forward, will wait until after the season to sign. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, Willis and Davis were all second-team selections on the Long Beach 
Press-Telegram's Best of the West squad, which is chosen based on a national 
poll of college recruiters and scouts. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside guard Princess Murray fulfilled an oral commitment Wednesday by 
signing to play for the Loyola Marymount women's basketball team. She is the 
first Morningside player, male or female, to sign during the early one-week 
period, Morningside girls' Coach Ron Randle said. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-10 Murray, who averaged 12 points and nine assists a game last year, 
chose the Lions over USC, Colorado, Washington and San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the academic program they have," Murray said of Loyola. "Plus, the 
basketball team is developing. They're starting to get good players." 
</P>
<P>
Murray is the second South Bay standout signed by Loyola in the past year. Lisa 
Humphries, an All-CIF guard from Palos Verdes, is a Loyola freshman. 
</P>
<P>
If you're wondering how many yards Serra running back Jerald Henry has rushed 
for this season, forget it. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Leo Hand said Wednesday that he has not kept individual statistics. Last 
year, Hand established a policy of not revealing individual stats until after 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
This year, though, he decided to junk the common practice of keeping track of 
players' performances. 
</P>
<P>
While Hand does this with Serra's best interest in mind -- he feels it helps 
maintain team unity -- it should be pointed out that without statistics it will 
be more difficult to select Serra's top players to the various all-star teams 
that are chosen after the season. 
</P>
<P>
Players named to all-star teams sometimes increase their chances of being 
recruited by colleges. 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, Hand might be doing his players a disservice. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Lane, a senior receiver-defensive back for Bishop Montgomery, ended his 
high school career in style Friday night in the Knights' 14-3 victory over 
Chaminade. 
</P>
<P>
Lane scored on a 65-yard option pass from receiver Anthony Milanes, returned a 
kickoff 70 yards, intercepted a pass, recovered a fumble and knocked down three 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bishop Montgomery struggled to a 3-7 record (1-5 in the Mission 
League), Coach Steve Carroll is looking forward to next year, when the Knights 
return 13 starters. Included in that group is junior Joe McEwen, a speedy 
running back who emerged as the team's top offensive threat. 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Israel Pose of Torrance will head a strong field of South Bay runners Saturday 
in the Southern Section cross-country finals at Mt. San Antonio College in 
Walnut. Races start at noon. Pose recorded the best time (16 minutes, 10 
seconds) last week in the Division II-AA prelims. Other area runners expected 
to do well include Shawn Page of Redondo (II-A, 16:06), Joe Reinisch of Bishop 
Montgomery (II-A, 16:19) and Kala Parker of Chadwick (girls' IV-A, 22:20). The 
Palos Verdes girls, meanwhile, will be going after their sixth consecutive 
Southern Section title in the I-A finals. However, the Sea Kings are going up 
against Agoura, the top-ranked team in the state. Agoura has beaten Palos 
Verdes twice this season in invitationals. The Palos Verdes boys are in a 
similar situation in the III-AA finals, where they are rated second behind 
Laguna Hills. . . . The top-seeded Palos Verdes girls' tennis team, led by 
freshman Nicole London, will travel to face Capistrano Valley at 2 p.m. today 
in the Southern Section 4-A semifinals.

PIERCE CALLS AUDIBLE TO AVOID PAC-10 CLASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pierce College will play a rare Friday night football game this week against 
Bakersfield. Asked why, Brahma Coach Bob Enger gives a seven-letter answer: 
USC-UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojan-Bruin rivalry, which will be renewed at 12:30 p.m. Saturday at the 
Rose Bowl, has caused Enger much grief over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"Because the 'SC-UCLA game is usually on during the day, junior college players 
are never focused for their games later that night," Enger said. "I don't want 
to compete with that. Therefore, I've tried for years to schedule our games for 
Friday. That way, the players are focused." 
</P>
<P>
Enger came to his conclusion in the mid-1960s when he was coach at East Los 
Angeles College. The Huskies were expected to crush Rio Hondo one year but were 
nearly upset. 
</P>
<P>
"It was bad," Enger recalled. "The 'SC-UCLA game started late, and the kids 
were on the bus on the way to the game listening to it on radios. . . . We 
turned what should have been a blowout into a very close game." 
</P>
<P>
Victory showers: Of the handful of Valley-area coaches who received celebratory 
dousings after important victories last weekend, credit Enger with extra credit 
for style points. 
</P>
<P>
It took Pierce players two tries to drench Enger, who avoided the first attempt 
with a nifty sprint down the sideline that he punctuated with a somersault onto 
the field in the final minutes of the Brahmas' 35-14 decision over archrival 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't get me the first time," Enger crowed. "I was too quick for them. 
But they came back five minutes later when I was watching the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought you had one attempt to get the coach and that was it. But they were 
playing by a different set of rules." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale football Coach John Cicuto and Master's soccer Coach Mark Schubert 
weren't as nimble-footed or nimble-minded. They both got doused on the first 
try. 
</P>
<P>
But neither complained: Glendale upset Moorpark, 45-21 and Master's defeated 
Westmont, 3-2, in overtime to win the NAIA District 3 soccer championship. 
</P>
<P>
Mired in obscurity: Like Rodney Dangerfield, the Cal State Northridge men's 
basketball program gets little respect. So little that two of the nation's 
leading college basketball magazines are unaware that the Matadors now play at 
the NCAA Division I level. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN is not listed with the other Division I independents in either Street 
&amp; Smith's College/Prep Basketball magazine or The Sporting News College 
Basketball Yearbook. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Basketball Times is aware of the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
Its comment: "Welcome aboard." 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Northridge basketball Coach Pete Cassidy on Todd Bowser, the 
Matadors' 6-foot-7 center who has steadily been taking weight off his 300-pound 
frame: "It is hard to see the weight in Todd. It is like throwing a deck chair 
off an ocean liner." 
</P>
<P>
Pirates' U-turn: After losing its first six games, Ventura has turned its 
season around with three consecutive victories and will, believe it or not, be 
playing for a possible bowl berth when it meets heavily favored Moorpark on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
A victory would give Ventura a 4-1 record in the Western State Conference 
Northern Division, good for second place behind Glendale. If Glendale chose to 
go to another bowl, Ventura would receive the Northern Division's berth in the 
WSC Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"As crazy as that sounds, I suppose that's possible," Ventura Coach Dick James 
said. 
</P>
<P>
James attributes the turnaround to several factors, among them a decision five 
weeks ago to delete the option from the offense. 
</P>
<P>
Also, two key Ventura offensive players have increased their production. In the 
past three games running back Tony Williams has rushed for 470 yards -- 36 more 
than he gained in the first six games. Quarterback Tim Albrent, meanwhile, has 
completed 32 of 58 passes for 415 yards after completing 56 of 102 for 737 in 
his first six outings. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, wide receiver Chris Thomas has caught 11 passes for 93 yards after 
grabbing 17 for 214 in the first six games. Thomas had more than 200 
all-purpose yards last week in a 29-26 win over Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Three's a crowd: Three teams -- Pierce, Ventura and Cuesta -- have tied for the 
Western State Conference women's volleyball championship with 16-2 conference 
records. But because only two WSC teams automatically qualify for the state 
tournament, the tie will have to be broken. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce will play Ventura tonight at 6 at Moorpark College, and the winner will 
play Cuesta on Friday at 6 p.m. at Santa Barbara City College. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the Pierce-Ventura match will qualify for state, as will Cuesta. 
The Friday match will be held for seeding purposes. 
</P>
<P>
All is not lost for the Pierce-Ventura loser, however. The third-place team 
also usually receives a bid. 
</P>
<P>
Statwatch: The two teams that have defeated Moorpark in football have a 
combined record of 16-2; the seven teams Moorpark has defeated have a 
cumulative record of 24-39. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Freddie Bradley had only 90 rushing yards against Glendale, marking the first 
time since last season's Orange County Classic that Bradley failed to gain 100 
yards. In that game, Rancho Santiago held him to 68 yards. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley intercepted five passes against Mt. San Jacinto. That gave the 
Marauders 20 interceptions this season, five shy of the school record set in 
1974. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tailback Bobby Webster of Glendale has set school single-season records for 
touchdowns (19) and rushing touchdowns (19) this season. He is also closing in 
on the rushing mark of 1,343 yards, set by Henry Longoria in 1975. Webster, who 
has rushed for more than 100 yards in seven consecutive games, has gained 1,235 
yards this season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Going the distance: Marcial Beltran expected a change in the academic 
atmosphere after transferring to Occidental College from Fullerton College. 
What he didn't expect was a change in his cross-country running tactics. 
</P>
<P>
Beltran is undefeated against NCAA Division III competition this season, but he 
says racing five miles -- a mile more than he did in junior college -- was a 
learning experience. 
</P>
<P>
At the Fresno Invitational in September, Beltran bolted to the lead midway 
through the race before fading to eighth place. But at both the Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference championships two weeks ago and 
the Division III Far West regional last Saturday, Beltran held back until the 
later stages before breaking away and setting course records. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm starting to get used to racing five miles," said Beltran, the national 
junior college record-holder in the marathon at 2 hours 17 minutes 26 seconds. 
"You have to think about your strategy and when to make your move. The extra 
mile makes a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
The Occidental men and women will compete Saturday in the Division III national 
meet in Grinnell, Iowa. 
</P>

ONE-MAN GANG

ANN CONWAY: FASHION MODELS WATCH THEMSELVES ON PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Family home videos it wasn't. But for the 100 women gathered at the Black Box 
Theatre in the Orange County Performing Arts Center recently, it was better. 
Much better. 
</P>
<P>
After more than a month of waiting, models in the Guilds of the Performing Arts 
Center's September fashion spectacular -- "The Center of Fashion" -- got to 
watch the show. On video. 
</P>
<P>
Settling back on folding chairs at tables done up with roses, the women oohed, 
aahed and squealed as they watched themselves parade before more than 3,000 
guests in the first fashion show held in Segerstrom Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Among the models was Judie Argyros, who came down with the giggles after 
watching herself vamp on the ramp in a drop-dead ensemble by D.N. Evans. 
</P>
<P>
On the screen, Argyros -- wife of Forbes 400 developer George Argyros -- looked 
like a modern Cinderella in silk taffeta, lace and veiled cocktail hat. But 
schmoozing with fellow models in the Black Box, she looked ultra-modern in 
jersey and leather embellished with beads and chains. "This is an outfit that I 
can only wear with the girls," Argyros confessed. "George hates it." 
</P>
<P>
The models left with a special keepsake -- their own copies of the 
videocassette. 
</P>
<P>
Also among the throng: Guilds chairwoman Janice Johnson and Shari Essayian, 
chairwoman of next year's Center of Fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Two Singular Sensations: "Chorus Line," that singularly sensational kick of a 
musical, made its debut at the Orange County Performing Arts Center on Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Among guests who gathered for a post-performance bash at Birraporetti's was 
Center board member Timothy Strader and his wife, Susan, and Center President 
Thomas Kendrick and his wife, Judy Morr (Center general manager). 
</P>
<P>
"Judy was in a chorus line once," whispered Kendrick, sipping something cool as 
he waited for the cast to arrive. Morr blushed. The secret to being a great 
chorine? "Consistency," Morr said. "When you're a chorus girl, you have to be 
like everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Guests dined on pizza and pasta dishes in a room dotted with gold and black 
balloons and top hats. (The restaurant's banquet manager, Dolores Aleccia, said 
she loves decorating the Irish-Italian bistro for the Center's parties.) Jazz 
pianist Jon Garner kept guests' toes tapping. And, tempting guests was a white 
sheet-cake emblazoned with the words, Chorus Line. The dancers dug into it with 
gusto. (No problem downing cake smothered with Kahlua cream when you dance your 
socks off every night.) The show continues through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Center's other singular sensation -- its annual Christmas Candlelight 
Concert -- is being held Dec. 9 at the Hyatt Regency Irvine. Up for some 
emotional listening: the Boys Choir of Harlem, known throughout the world for 
its angelic sound. 
</P>
<P>
The choir was established in New York in the '60s to build self-esteem among 
inner-city children and provide an alternative to the street scene. This 
morning at the Center Club, an early-bird breakfast is being staged for the 
ball's angels -- South Coast Plaza, the Hyatt Regency Irvine, Tiffany &amp; Co. 
and American Airlines -- and committee members. Ciel Woodman is gala 
chairwoman. Tickets are still available. 
</P>
<P>
Celebration!: Raising more than $50,000 at a benefit luncheon is music to any 
fund-raiser's ears. But big bucks are especially dear to the Orange County 
Philharmonic Society, sponsors of music programs for 300,000 local youth 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, about 700 Philharmonic supporters -- dressed to kill in autumn 
finery (hats are in and so are headbands -- luncheon chairwoman Ann Stern 
sported one) congregated at the Hyatt Regency Irvine for "Celebration of 
Music." They bid on 250 auction items before they dined and viewed a fashion 
extravaganza staged by Saks Fifth Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Among guests were Marcia Coy, chairwoman of the Philharmonic's women's 
committees; Eva Schneider; Susan Beechner; Wolf Stern; Bob Searles, society 
president; Elaine Redfield; Erich Vollmer, the society's executive director; 
Bobbitt Williams; Barbara Mason; Ann Pange; and Ed Halvajian, chairman of the 
Philharmonic board. 
</P>
<P>
Home run for charity: Hundreds gathered at South Coast Plaza's Crystal Court 
last week to dine at the culinary extravaganza that annually benefits Orange 
County's Food Distribution Center. Two dozen wineries and several plaza 
restaurants -- Antonello, Bangkok Four, Gustaf Anders and Gianni, among them -- 
kicked in specialties so guests could fill up to feed the hungry. 
</P>
<P>
Getting almost as much attention as the mouth-watering fare were Angel pitcher 
Kirk McCaskill and his wife, Dana. The handsome couple anted up a $16,000 
donation to the distribution center from an organization they founded, Strike 
Out Hunger. Also among guests were event co-chairmen Timothy Maurier and 
Timothy McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
Butterflies are free: Interval House has dubbed its annual Thanksgiving ball 
"Le Bal des Papillons" -- the ball of the butterflies. It's an appropriate 
theme for a gala that annually raises funds to free women from the cocoon of 
abuse. Word's out that artist Karen Toda has designed 500 gossamer butterflies 
for the affair. 
</P>
<P>
The Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point is the site of the $200 per-person black-tie 
gala, which will feature a gourmet dinner, dancing to the West Coast Music 
Orchestra and an auction with items that include European and spa vacations. 
Tickets are still available. This extraordinary event has become Orange 
County's signature Thanksgiving gala.

CITY OFFERS A SEAT TO A STATESMAN; 
</P>
<P>
SCULPTURE: A STATUE HONORING BENJAMIN FRANKLIN IN THE CITY'S REDEVELOPMENT AREA 
MAY SIGNAL THE FUTURE OF PUBLIC ART IN GLENDALE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It is not an unusual sight in Glendale: a bespectacled, jovial-looking fellow 
shares a park bench with a couple of pigeons. 
</P>
<P>
But this fellow is Benjamin Franklin, cast in bronze. Clutched in his hand is 
the U.S. Constitution, which he helped write. The pigeons, too, are frozen in a 
permanent pose. 
</P>
<P>
The scene in a brick-paved plaza at 135 N. Brand Blvd. was unveiled last 
weekend as the city's first publicly owned art in the downtown redevelopment 
zone. It is a salute to a statesman who died 200 years ago, but also signals 
the future of public art in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Public art in Glendale has become important, city officials say. No matter what 
the art form -- whether historical or modern sculptures, architectural design 
or even cultural events -- a city policy adopted in September mandates that it 
be incorporated into new developments in the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale City Council last year began setting aside $100,000 a year in 
public funds to establish a city arts program. The money could be used to 
purchase new art or to restore historical pieces, such as the 1928 statue of 
Miss American Green Cross -- a salute to early conservation efforts -- that was 
wrecked by vandals and has been stored for years. 
</P>
<P>
The 600-pound, life-size Ben Franklin, however, was donated to the city by the 
Howard-Platz Group of Glendale, developer of The Exchange, where the statue is 
reposed near a gurgling three-tier fountain in a courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
Expected to be completed by summer, The Exchange is a two-block center of 
upscale shops, restaurants and offices in an area bounded by Brand Boulevard, 
Broadway, Wilson and Louise streets. Featured will be an eight-screen theater 
under construction on Maryland Avenue between Wilson and Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
The Howard-Platz Group purchased the Franklin statue for $33,000 and dedicated 
it to the city Saturday. One of an edition of 21, the statue was created in 
1987 by sculptor George Lundeen of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Richard L. Daughterty, project manager for the Howard-Platz Group, said 
developers sought an art form that "would be historical, recognizable and 
understood by all generations of people." He said the Franklin bronze was 
selected after a series of informal discussions with city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1706, Franklin, son of a Boston soap maker, had little schooling. Yet 
he learned French, Italian, Spanish and Latin; invented the Franklin stove, 
bifocal glasses and the lightning rod; and was one of the most skilled 
diplomats in the nation's history. He also is credited with helping to 
establish public libraries, the post office, fire and police departments, 
hospitals and services such as street paving and lighting. Franklin died in 
1790.

BRUSH CLEARANCE PLAN GIVEN TENTATIVE OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under a new Glendale fire prevention program that received tentative approval 
Tuesday, firefighters will check 13,000 hillside lots and order the removal of 
any brush that could fuel a fast-moving blaze. 
</P>
<P>
If property owners do not comply with the removal orders within 15 days, the 
city will send crews to do the work, then add the cost to the owner's property 
tax bill, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance would require the removal of all dead trees. In most 
cases, weeds and other vegetation within 100 feet of a building would be 
allowed to grow only three inches high. The height limit would not apply to 
ornamental shrubbery or plants that would not easily fuel the spread of fire. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance would also require an owner to cut tree limbs that hang over 
roofs and could endanger the structure if the limbs catch on fire. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't do this, we're going to be criticized," said Mayor Larry Zarian, 
one of four council members who voted for the plan. "It is imperative that this 
program start." 
</P>
<P>
But Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg charged that the new rules are a 
"sledgehammer" tactic and were being enacted without sufficient public review. 
</P>
<P>
"This is absolutely outrageous," Bremberg said. "Nobody has any idea what's 
going to be imposed on them. People have spent thousands and thousands of 
dollars putting in their landscaping. Do you want them to end up with half a 
tree?" 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "vegetation management plan" was proposed by Fire Chief John 
Montenero and Fire Marshal Chris Gray in the wake of the June 27 College Hills 
fire that destroyed or damaged 64 Glendale houses and caused more than $15 
million in damage. Firefighters said flammable roofs and dry vegetation near 
the houses helped spread the fire and contributed to the high property loss. 
</P>
<P>
In 4-1 votes, the council allocated $165,000 to begin the brush inspections and 
authorized fees designed to make the program pay for itself. An ordinance 
adding the guidelines to the city's building and safety code was introduced 
Tuesday and will be returned for final approval next week. 
</P>
<P>
Montenero argued that without mandatory inspections, property owners will not 
voluntarily eliminate the tree limbs and other vegetation that could carry 
flames to their houses. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless we eradicate a certain amount of this brush hazard, we will have 
another College Hills fire," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Carl Raggio, whose son lost a house in that blaze, said the 
crackdown will keep a fire from moving quickly from one house to another within 
a hillside neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"My son had taken protective measures," he said. "It didn't work because others 
had not." 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale program, patterned after a similar one in the city of Los Angeles, 
is expected to be launched in January. In the past, Glendale has hired the Los 
Angeles County Department of Agriculture to check about 350 vacant lots 
annually for dangerous brush. But city officials complained that this process 
was too slow and too small in scope. 
</P>
<P>
After the June 27 fire, Montenero proposed that the city order the replacement 
of flammable wood roofs and impose tougher controls on hillside vegetation. A 
majority of council members rejected the roof replacement plan, but urged the 
fire chief to prepare the brush clearance program. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, the Fire Department is expected initially to survey about 
13,000 parcels in brush hazard areas. Gray said about 10,000 lots will likely 
not need clearance. 
</P>
<P>
But he said firefighters expect to make more rigorous inspections and order the 
removal of hazards on about 3,200 parcels. 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department has estimated that the prevention program will cost about 
$218,000 annually, including the hiring of a forester and a clerical worker. 
</P>
<P>
To pay for it, the city will charge property owners a $30 inspection fee 
whenever firefighters find brush hazards that must be removed. The city will 
charge an extra $275 administrative fee if it needs to call in an outside crew 
to do the clearance work. 
</P>
<P>
The department estimates that it will need to call in outside crews to clear 
about 250 lots annually. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said they will return to the council in the coming weeks to call 
for tougher hillside building rules and the use of fire-resistant landscaping.

FOOTBALL: MARK SEAY IS AMONG TOP RECEIVERS IN HIS CONFERENCE. HE'S HAPPY TO BE 
PLAYING FOR CAL STATE LONG BEACH DESPITE LOSING KIDNEY IN SHOOTING.

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Seay did not attend a children's party this Halloween. "My sister and I 
talked about having one and then we thought, 'Oh, no, remember what happened 
the last time,' " said the Cal State Long Beach football player who was shot by 
a suspected gang member at such a party two years ago as he shielded his 
2-year-old niece. 
</P>
<P>
Seay, who lost a kidney as a result of the shooting, said he is happy to be 
back on the field after missing a season. But he still feels betrayed by 
university officials who told him last year that he could not play because the 
risk of damaging his other kidney was too great. He is playing now only after 
taking legal action against the university. 
</P>
<P>
The junior wide receiver will finish his comeback season Saturday when the 
49ers play Nevada Las Vegas in Veterans Stadium. Seay is among the top 
receivers in the Big West Conference with 45 catches for 709 yards. He has 
caught four touchdown passes. Last Saturday, he caught a two-point conversion 
pass that defeated Cal State Northridge, 25-24. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not satisfied, but it's gone pretty good," Seay said. "If I don't perform 
the way I should, if I'm not happy, I always think about the time when I 
thought I'd never be playing again." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Coach George Allen said: "He's an example for all of us, what I call 
a solid citizen. He's a leader. One of the highlights of my coaching career is 
having a guy like Mark Seay on my team." 
</P>
<P>
The only difference Seay has noticed in playing football with one kidney rather 
than two is the extra protective equipment he must wear. "I put on a pad that 
protects my back area and my hip, and then I put on a flak jacket," he said. 
"At first I just wanted to yank it off because I was the type of player who 
wore as few pads as I could get away with." 
</P>
<P>
But he is glad he has kept it on. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been hit as hard as I've been hit this year," said Seay, who is 6 
feet tall and 175 pounds. "I've taken my share of hits." 
</P>
<P>
Only once, in a game in Jack Murphy Stadium against San Diego State, was he 
worried: "A guy was on top of my back and slammed me into the infield area 
where it's all dirt. I coughed up some blood. That was scary. But I didn't 
think it had to do anything with my kidney." 
</P>
<P>
Seay has detected a tendency in people to think that when he makes a mistake in 
a game it must be related to his disability. 
</P>
<P>
In a game against New Mexico State, an embarrassed Seay caught a kickoff and, 
thinking he was in the end zone instead of on the two-yard line, dropped to one 
knee and downed the ball. "Some of the (assistant) coaches didn't think I was 
myself, I think simply because of what happened to my kidney," Seay said. "It 
made me angry. They kept asking me how I felt. I felt great. I just didn't know 
where I was. It could have happened to anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Seay said he has a urine test after each game and has had one 24-hour 
creatinine clearance test -- a measure of kidney function. "They said I was 
fine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Dan Bailey said last week that he could not discuss Seay's kidney tests 
because, he said, Seay never signed a consent, as most players do, for release 
of medical information to the media. 
</P>
<P>
Seay has chosen to play despite the prospect of having to be hooked to a 
dialysis machine should his remaining kidney be damaged. 
</P>
<P>
"I think about that all the time," he said. "It could happen, nothing's 
promised to you in this world. But I'm 23 years old and I'm not going to let 
anyone dictate my life. I was cheated out of one (kidney), if I'm going to lose 
this one I'm not going to be cheated. I'm going to end up losing it doing 
something I want to do." 
</P>
<P>
The quiet, introspective Seay, who grew up in San Bernardino, has been besieged 
with interview requests. He realizes he will probably always be known for 
having one kidney rather than for his football playing ability. "I didn't ask 
for any of this," he said. "A lot of times I don't know what to do with it. I'm 
not the type of guy who likes being in the spotlight." 
</P>
<P>
But one has shined brightly on him nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
He seems perplexed by the national acclaim he received for saving his niece. "I 
never have thought of myself as a hero," he said. "I'd like to know who made up 
the word hero, because really I don't know what it is. I look at myself as I 
did before this even happened. I am what I am, I'm nothing more or nothing 
less. If they want to keep calling me a hero, and that's what makes them happy, 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
When Seay awoke in the hospital after his kidney was removed, he wondered if he 
would play football again. He said university officials, including President 
Curtis McCray and Athletic Director Corey Johnson, visited him. "They said, 'We 
hope you make it back, we're behind you 100%,' " Seay recalled. "I felt good 
because these people were among the reasons I came to this university." 
</P>
<P>
In January of 1989 Seay returned to classes and began working out. He suited up 
for spring practice and fully anticipated playing the 1989 season. He recalled 
visiting McCray in his office. "He told me he'd do anything in his power to see 
that I was back out there," Seay said. 
</P>
<P>
But in June he was told by Johnson and team physician Robert Austin that he was 
being declared medically ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a shock," Seay said. "They told me I wouldn't be able to go to another 
school because I wouldn't be accepted, and as far as going pro, I wouldn't be 
able to pass the physical. They said the best thing was to retire and be a 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish they would have let me know what was going on up front so I could have 
known what to do with myself. There were no warnings, nothing. I was in a lot 
of stress. They left me with no support. They're dealing with young men, not 
professionals. If I was a weak-minded person I could have committed suicide. 
You do not play with young men's lives like that." 
</P>
<P>
Seay sued the university in an effort to keep playing, but in September of 1989 
a U.S. District judge, saying that there was insufficient evidence to determine 
if Seay's remaining kidney was working properly, denied a request for an 
injunction ordering the university to let him play last season. 
</P>
<P>
"At the hearing, instead of Corey coming up to me and saying, 'I'm sorry,' he 
came up and said, 'So what's next, are you going to be a coach?' " 
</P>
<P>
Last winter, with the case expected to proceed to trial, Johnson hired George 
Allen as the football coach. "I didn't start feeling better until he came," 
Seay said. "I knew he was behind me when he told me, 'If they don't let you 
play here, I can get you a shot in the NFL . . . but I know they're going to 
let you play,' " 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, the lawsuit was settled out of court and Seay, after passing 
medical tests, was allowed to rejoin the 49ers this season. He signed a waiver 
absolving the university of liability if he should suffer an injury to his 
remaining kidney. 
</P>
<P>
"It was difficult to deny him his dream," Johnson said at a news conference at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
"They tried anyway," Seay said the other day. "If they didn't think they were 
gong to lose (in a trial) I'm sure they would have stuck to their position. But 
I have no animosity toward them. I forgive them but I don't forget, I'll never 
forget." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Donlan, senior associate athletic director, said Tuesday: "I'm glad it's 
worked out for Mark, and I think I speak for Corey and the president. It was an 
awkward situation. The school was always with Mark, but I think it was a matter 
of being very cautious. It was a position it almost had to take. He remains not 
only an excellent athlete but also a very fine human being." 
</P>
<P>
Seay's smile was brilliant in the slant of sunshine late last Saturday 
afternoon after the 49ers had won on his two-point conversion pass against Cal 
State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark, Mark," called a silver-haired man. It was McCray, the university 
president, rushing up with congratulations. It was a special moment, and Seay 
basked in it. 
</P>
<P>
He walked off the field looking like any other football hero, and it was hard 
to imagine that he has only one kidney and that the bullet that pierced his 
other one is lodged three inches from his heart. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP Cal State Long Beach (5-5) will try for a winning season Saturday 
when it plays Nevada Las Vegas (4-6) at 1 p.m. in Veterans Stadium in Long 
Beach. Coach George Allen has not had a losing season since 1954, when he was 
at Whittier College.

VETERANS GROUPS WIN PRELIMINARY VICTORY TO SERVE ALCOHOL AT HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two veterans organizations with dwindling memberships won a tentative victory 
Tuesday in their yearlong bureaucratic battle to open a joint canteen in La 
Crescenta. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who live nearby have attacked the plan, charging that veterans who 
drive after drinking will endanger dozens of children who live close to the 
Verdugo Hills Memorial Hall at 4011 La Crescenta Ave. They also say the canteen 
will increase parking problems in the neighborhood and decrease property 
values. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1934, the hall has been occupied by American Legion Post 288, but the 
group is not licensed to sell alcohol. Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 1614 wants 
to move from a rented commercial building into the Legion hall, bringing its 
liquor license to set up the joint canteen. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Glendale City Council members weighed emotional pleas and legal 
arguments from both sides at a 2 1/2-hour hearing. Then the council unanimously 
instructed the city staff to prepare documents that would allow the variance 
the veterans need to open a canteen serving only post members and their guests. 
The variance will be returned to the council Dec. 18 for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
But nearby residents and church leaders vowed to continue opposing the plan 
before the council and with state Alcoholic Beverage Control officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't stop here," said Sharon Olsen, who raised $450 from her neighborhood 
to appeal an earlier city decision in favor of the veterans. "The main concern 
is that the city of Glendale never in its history has allowed the sale of 
alcoholic beverages in a residential neighborhood. We're opposed to this 
because it sets a precedent. This is a neighborhood -- we didn't choose to live 
in a commercial zone." 
</P>
<P>
She and other residents told the council that the residential streets next to 
the veterans hall have no sidewalks or curbs. As a result, children often ride 
bicycles, skate and play in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no safe way to drink and drive," said Olsen, who is the finance 
officer for an alcohol education program. "If you put a bar, public or private, 
in a residential area, you'll have people leaving the establishment under the 
influence." 
</P>
<P>
But city staff members urged approval of the variance, saying it would allow a 
modest expansion of social activities that have long taken place at the site. 
</P>
<P>
Legion members have regularly rented the upper floor of their two-story hall 
for classes and social events. Alcohol has been consumed at social events in 
the building when a one-day ABC permit was obtained or when the drinks were 
provided at no cost, post members said. 
</P>
<P>
"No evidence has been shown that the sale of alcoholic beverages at this 
location would make this neighborhood less safe," said John W. McKenna, the 
city's planning director. 
</P>
<P>
The veterans pledged to drink responsibly and serve only members and guests. 
"We do care about the safety of children," said Jack Wager, adjutant of the 
American Legion post. 
</P>
<P>
Members also cited their record of military service to their country. 
</P>
<P>
"At issue here is not just the legality of a variance, but what we as the 
American Legion stand for," said Carl Peirolo, a post member who teaches a 
junior ROTC class at Crescenta Valley High School. 
</P>
<P>
The veterans hall was built in 1934 in an unincorporated section of La 
Crescenta. The area was annexed by Glendale in 1952 and zoned for housing. The 
hall has been allowed to continue operating under a "legal nonconforming" 
land-use status. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1970 the La Crescenta VFW has operated a private canteen at 2937 Honolulu 
Ave. But high rent and declining membership led the post to seek the city's 
permission in February to operate a joint canteen at the Legion hall. 
</P>
<P>
Combined, the two posts have 334 members, but only about half live in the 
immediate area, post leaders said. The groups have estimated that a maximum of 
50 people a day will use the canteen. 
</P>
<P>
The posts would remain separate but would share costs and split the revenue 
from the joint canteen. Post leaders said any proceeds in excess of the hall's 
operating costs would go to support the organization's programs which benefit 
young people and veterans. 
</P>
<P>
On April 26, Glendale Zoning Administrator Kathleen Marcus granted a variance 
to the veterans. But her decision was appealed by an area pastor, at the 
request of the neighborhood. On Sept. 13, the Board of Zoning Adjustments 
upheld Marcus' decision, but Olsen, the alcohol education program official, 
appealed it to the council. 
</P>
<P>
City planning officials have attached 20 conditions to the proposed variance. 
Under these, the veterans must install additional landscaping and walls to 
separate their parking lot from the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The canteen must limit its operating hours to 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through 
Saturday and 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday. The veterans also must maintain an 
alcohol abuse education program and post signs concerning drunk driving laws. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Larry Zarian said the conflicting concerns of the residents and the 
veterans made it difficult to decide the issue. He said he voted to let the 
variance proceed only after getting assurances from the city staff that it 
would not set a precedent allowing other drinking establishments in residential 
zones. 
</P>
<P>
If the variance is granted, the veterans will still need state ABC approval to 
move the liquor license. Post leaders said they will continue to press for the 
joint canteen despite the strong opposition from the residents. 
</P>
<P>
But David Haskell, commander of the Legion post, conceded: "We didn't know they 
were going to be quite as hard-nosed and stubborn as they are."

GROWTH-CONTROL PROGRAM ADDS 'BONUS' FOR BUILDERS; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING: THE COUNCIL TENTATIVELY APPROVES AN ORDINANCE TO ALLOW DEVELOPERS TO 
CONSTRUCT 25% MORE APARTMENTS WHEN THEY COMBINE LOTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a postscript to an ambitious growth-control program approved last week, the 
Glendale City Council gave tentative approval Tuesday to an ordinance that 
would let developers build 25% more apartments or condominiums when they 
combine two or more lots. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "density bonus" originall1y was part of citywide zoning changes 
aimed at reducing by more than half the number of new multiple family units 
that can be built in the city. 
</P>
<P>
That measure was adopted by the council last week, ending a two-year moratorium 
on new apartments and condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
But at last week's meeting Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg said she could not 
approve the growth-control plan because the density bonus would allow at least 
1,000 additional housing units. 
</P>
<P>
The other council members agreed to delete the bonus measure last week so that 
they could vote unanimously for the growth curbs, which are designed to address 
traffic congestion and crowded schools that resulted from an apartment and 
condominium building boom. 
</P>
<P>
During growth-control hearings held earlier this year, the Glendale Chamber of 
Commerce urged the city to grant a 50% density bonus to developers who combine 
lots. Chamber members said it would encourage construction of larger, 
better-designed projects with room for on-site managers. 
</P>
<P>
When the council revived a 25% bonus plan Tuesday, Bremberg opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
"I still feel very strongly that the developers and the Chamber of Commerce 
have no business writing ordinances for us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Carl Raggio said: "This isn't the result of the chamber. This is 
the result of input from the community at large." 
</P>
<P>
"The chamber does not dictate to me," Mayor Larry Zarian said. "They did not 
draft this ordinance." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Richard Jutras reintroduced the density-bonus ordinance, which will 
be returned for a final vote next week.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE; 
</P>
<P>
TO EXTEND CONSUMER AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By a vote of 375 to 41, the House sent to the White House a bill to keep the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission alive with budgets of $42 million in fiscal 
1991 and $45 million in 1992. President Bush was expected to sign the measure 
(S605). 
</P>
<P>
The agency has been slowed in its mission by battles between consumer and 
business interests over how far it should go to keep hazardous products off the 
market. This bill makes it easier for it to obtain a quorum to conduct 
business. Among other provisions, it requires manufacturers to inform the panel 
if they lose a threshold number of lawsuits over their products, and mandates 
safety standards for a few risky products, including garage door openers and 
cigarette lighters that are easily ignited by children. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Doug Walgren (D-Pa.) said the bill has strong backing from consumer 
groups and the agency itself. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Howard C. Nielson (R-Utah) said, "The bill outrageously mismanages, 
micro-manages, this agency." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to reauthorize the Consumer Product Safety Commission. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Immigration Reform 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 264 to 118, the House gave final congressional approval of a bill 
(S358) reforming the process of legal immigration to the United States. 
President Bush was expected to sign the bill, under which the current limit of 
500,000 immigrants annually will be raised to 700,000 between 1992 and 1994, 
then drop permanently to 650,000. The majority of the new visas will go to 
people with needed job and professional skills or who come from European and 
African countries that have had low quotas in recent decades. One innovation is 
a set-aside of 10,000 visas each year for investors of at least $1 million in 
new, job-creating businesses in America. 
</P>
<P>
The bill eases restrictions based on ideology and sexual preference, gives the 
Department of Health and Human Services power to admit immigrants who may be 
infected with AIDS, and is more protective than current law of political 
refugees from El Salvador and elsewhere in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to pass the immigration reform bill. 
</P>
<P>
How They Voted 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Moorhead (R): Nay 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Roybal (D): Yea 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Waxman (D): Yea 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clean Air 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 401 to 25, the House gave its final approval of a bill (S1630) 
accelerating federal efforts to make the air healthier to breathe, protect the 
Earth's ozone layer against further depletion and curb the damage acid rain 
inflicts on lakes and forests. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush was set to sign the first upgrade of the Clean Air Act in 13 
years. Supported by much of the business community and environmentalists, the 
750-page measure relies on economic incentives and tough civil and criminal 
penalties to achieve its goals. The bill curbs toxic emissions from motor 
vehicles, power plants, factories, dry cleaners and all other significant 
contributors to air pollution. It seeks to cut acid rain by curbing high-sulfur 
coal emissions from Midwestern power plants, mandates cleaner gasolines and 
tighter exhaust controls on motor vehicles, and requires the more than 100 
cities with the dirtiest air to lower pollution to acceptable levels over the 
next five to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote supported the bill.

DEVELOPER GETS RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST CITY AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The developer of a proposed 16-acre shopping center has temporarily staved off 
an attempt by the Whittier Redevelopment Agency to nullify its agreement with 
the developer after city leaders said the company failed to deliver what it 
promised. 
</P>
<P>
Urbatec, the planned developer of the Whittier Station Center, received a 
temporary restraining order prohibiting the Redevelopment Agency from declaring 
the company in default of its agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Novak, an attorney for Urbatec, said the restraining order is good until 
Nov. 20, when a judge will determine whether the company is entitled to a 
preliminary injunction against the Redevelopment Agency. Such an injunction 
would prevent city leaders from breaking off the agreement and entering into an 
agreement with another company to develop the property. 
</P>
<P>
Novak, who declared the receipt of the restraining order a "major victory," 
said that Urbatec officials are confident "no court is going to say we are in 
default." 
</P>
<P>
Urbatec and city leaders have been at cross-purposes over the financing and the 
type of grocery store that should anchor the 20-store center. Urbatec obtained 
a $12.8-million loan that the Redevelopment Agency used to buy the land, but 
city leaders complained that, among other things, the loan was put up too 
slowly and the price of the land rose, making the project more expensive.

HALF OF STREET CLOSED FOR CLEANUP OF OIL LINE LEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cleanup of more than 1,000 gallons of crude oil continues on Bloomfield and 
Eckleson avenues in Cerritos after an underground six-inch line burst on Nov. 
7. 
</P>
<P>
The two southbound lanes of Bloomfield are expected to remain closed through 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
One of the northbound lanes is being used for southbound traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Powerine Oil Co. pays an annual franchise fee of about $3,700 to Cerritos for 
the underground pipeline that moves oil from the Port of Los Angeles north 
through Cerritos to the company's base in Santa Fe Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Work crews are removing soil contaminated by the spill and the city has hired 
an environmental consulting company, Woodward and Clyde Consultants of Santa 
Ana, to monitor the cleanup and test the soil for toxic residue. Under terms of 
its contract with Cerritos, Powerine must pay for the cleanup, including the 
consultant's fee. 
</P>
<P>
The spill, which covered the pavement and parts of the street median, also 
leaked into storm drains that empty into the Coyote Creek flood control 
channel. However, Michele Wastal, the city's public information officer, said 
quick action by cleanup crews kept the oil from reaching the creek waters.

TROUBLED CONDO PROJECT WINS UNANIMOUS APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A developer who took the unusual step of filing a $1-million lawsuit against 
Long Beach residents who tried to block his condominium project saw his 
building plans unanimously approved by the City Council this week. 
</P>
<P>
About two dozen residents of the newly formed Zaferia homeowners group stormed 
out of Tuesday's council meeting just before the 63-unit complex was approved 7 
to 0. 
</P>
<P>
While some residents welcomed the building and the moderately priced 
condominiums it will provide, others called it an oversized intrusion in their 
neighborhood of quaint homes off of Pacific Coast Highway near the Traffic 
Circle. 
</P>
<P>
The opponents circulated petitions and spoke out at public hearings to stop the 
project, prompting Huntington Beach developer G.M. Peters to file the 
$1-million suit against two of them last August. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, known as a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation, or SLAPP, 
was dropped soon after the residents hired a lawyer of their own. 
</P>
<P>
The council endorsed the project after hearing from backers who said it would 
help relieve the city's affordable housing crunch.

CHILD-CARE PROPOSAL WINS REPRIEVE FOR FURTHER STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal to reimburse members of city commissions and other groups for child 
care and senior citizens care won a reprieve this week at a Long Beach City 
Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
A council committee had recommended that the proposal by the city's Board of 
Health and Human Services be rejected because it could cost the city about 
$65,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
But several council members questioned the committee's finding, which was based 
on a $25 reimbursement fee instead of the $15 that was recommended. Also, the 
committee estimated that half of the city's commissioners and board members 
would seek the reimbursement. That number is highly inflated, according to 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
The council sent the matter back to its Economic Development and Finance 
Committee for further analysis. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters argue that helping people pay for child care opens local government 
to those who may otherwise not be able to participate. 
</P>
<P>
Reimbursing members of commissions and other groups for child care and senior 
citizens care was suggested earlier this year by the local branch of the 
National Organization for Women. In a study of the city's 47 committees, 
commissions and boards, the group found that women compose 38% of the 
appointments. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those appointments deal with social services and the arts. Men, on the 
other hand, are more likely to be appointed to the more powerful groups that 
set policy and administer funds, according to the NOW study.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EASED LIMITS ON CHILD CARE TENTATIVELY OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale City Council, which last month rejected a proposed law to 
encourage the operation of large child-care centers, tentatively approved a 
limited measure Tuesday that would lift restrictions in all areas except 
single-family neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
City staff members said the new law will streamline the rules for opening large 
child-care centers in multiple-family neighborhoods and in commercial and 
industrial zones. 
</P>
<P>
It would also reduce the parking requirements for such centers because most 
parents simply drop off and pick up their children during a brief stop, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The new ordinance does not allow centers handling more than 12 children to open 
in neighborhoods zoned for single-family houses. Council members Carl Raggio 
and Ginger Bremberg objected to such a proposal Oct. 9, defeating a child-care 
measure than required four affirmative votes. 
</P>
<P>
The two council members expressed no objections to the revised ordinance 
Tuesday. It will be returned for final approval next week. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen any serious concerns on their part about this one," said Jane 
Whitaker, president of the Greater Glendale Child Care Council. "We still are 
very concerned about getting some ordinance on the books that will encourage 
people to open child-care centers."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 STABBED, 1 BEATEN IN HIGHLAND PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men were stabbed and a third was attacked in an apparent racial incident 
early Monday on York Boulevard in Northeast Los Angeles, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Beltran, 24, of Arizona and Larry Delgado, 20, of Hacienda Heights were 
each stabbed once in the chest about 1 a.m., Los Angeles Police Detective Ron 
Whitt said. 
</P>
<P>
The men had been driving around the Highland Park area looking for their uncle, 
Jack Delgado, 40, also of Hacienda Heights. They found him at York Boulevard 
and Avenue 54 involved in an altercation with five men described by police as 
gang members. 
</P>
<P>
When Beltran and Delgado went to the aid of their uncle, a fight broke out 
between them and the assailants, resulting in stab wounds to the two men, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Delgado, who was not injured, drove the victims to White Memorial Medical 
Center in Los Angeles, where they were treated for chest wounds. Beltran was 
reportedly treated and released and Delgado was listed in stable condition 
Wednesday at White Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
In a second incident, James Davis, 41, a transient, was assaulted and pushed 
through a plate-glass window, police said. Davis, who is black, told police he 
was attacked about 12:15 a.m. in the parking lot of a grocery store in the 6200 
block of York Boulevard in Highland Park by two white males who yelled a racial 
slur at him. 
</P>
<P>
The men hit Davis with their fists and then pushed a shopping cart against him 
after he tried to escape, Davis told police. When he tried to get away a second 
time, his attackers pushed him through the store's window, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis suffered minor cuts to the side of his head and told police he would seek 
medical attention on his own. 
</P>
<P>
Because the suspects used a racial slur against Davis, the assault is being 
investigated as a hate incident, Whitt said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL AWARDS BEELINE CONTRACT TO MEDI-RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Glendale City Council awarded a $692,000 contract Tuesday to Medi-Ride, 
making it operator of the city's popular Beeline shuttle service beginning Nov. 
27. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale-based Medi-Ride, which earlier this year won a contract to operate the 
Dial-A-Ride van service for the city's elderly and disabled residents, 
submitted the lowest among four bids, which ranged as high as $1.4 million for 
one year. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members expressed surprise that Medi-Ride's bid was 11.3% below 
the city staff's estimate of the annual cost of operating the 11 shuttles, 
which provide free transportation in the city's central business district. They 
asked whether the firm had enough drivers to take over the system when the 
present contract expires in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Medi-Ride Vice President Irwin Rosenberg said the company was able to submit a 
low bid because it can use some of the same employees who now administer and 
dispatch the Dial-A-Ride program. He said the company has begun seeking Beeline 
drivers and pledged that it will be ready on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The Beeline contract allows the city to negotiate four one-year renewals 
without seeking new proposals from other companies. Under the agreement, 
Glendale will own the Beeline buses, but Medi-Ride will provide maintenance, 
drivers and dispatching. 
</P>
<P>
The shuttle service was launched in December, 1984. Passengers were charged 25 
cents a ride. Two years ago, the fee was eliminated, and ridership began to 
climb. 
</P>
<P>
During October, when a new southern route was added, Beeline shuttles carried 
more than 71,000 passengers, said Kerry Morford, city assistant public works 
director. The city will add a 12th shuttle in the coming months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The service was originally operated by Pacific Busing, which was acquired last 
year by Laidlaw Transit. The city did not receive a proposal from Laidlaw to 
continue the service, Morford said.

GOVERNMENTS OFFER HOUSING ASSISTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD BLUME 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Families, particularly first-time home buyers, are increasingly unable to 
afford a home at current prices. The California Assn. of Realtors estimates 
that only 18% of Los Angeles County households can afford to purchase the 
county's median-priced home, which cost about $205,000 in September. 
</P>
<P>
For that 18%, affordability requires that a family earn at least $67,000 a 
year, can afford to pay 30% of their income toward their mortgage and can 
scrape together a down payment of about $41,000, association spokesman Jeff 
Hershberger said. 
</P>
<P>
Because high home prices threaten to destroy the American dream of home 
ownership for many, government at all levels has debated stepping in. In the 
Nov. 6 election, voters had to decide on housing assistance plans that would 
use tax dollars. Potential sources of government help have included the 
following: 
</P>
<P>
Federal Government: The Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act. 
</P>
<P>
Status: Passed by both houses of Congress. President Bush has until the end of 
November to sign the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Amount of Money: $27.5 billion for fiscal 1991 and $29.9 billion for fiscal 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
Details: Creates a revolving loan fund to buy down interest rates for 
first-time home buyers who earn up to 95% of the median income where they live. 
Assists families in public housing to buy their units. The bill also provides 
for government-subsidized private apartments to remain affordable. 
</P>
<P>
State Government: Proposition 145. 
</P>
<P>
Status: Defeated Nov. 6 by California voters. 
</P>
<P>
Amount of Money: $325 million in general-obligation bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Details: Would have provided about $200 million to assist moderate-income, 
first-time home buyers. Plans for the remainder of the money included making 
affordable rental housing earthquake-safe and providing shelter and 
transitional housing for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
City Government: Proposition K, a bond issue in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Status: Passed Nov. 6 by Los Angeles voters. 
</P>
<P>
Amount of Money: $100 million in municipal bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Details: Establishes a $10-million revolving fund to provide loans to 
first-time home buyers and allocates $10 million to create short-term, 
transitional housing for homeless families. The proposition also provides funds 
to make buildings earthquake-secure. 
</P>
<P>
City Government: Redevelopment funds. 
</P>
<P>
Status: Available now in many cities. 
</P>
<P>
Amount of Money: At least $121 million in Los Angeles County, according to the 
Southern California Assn. of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
Details: City redevelopment agencies are required to set aside a certain amount 
of their revenue to fund low- and moderate-income housing projects. Much of 
this money, which continues to accumulate, has never been used by city 
governments. HOWARD BLUME

AFTER TWO YEARS, NOGALES HIGH RUNNING BACK EDWARDS RETURNS HOME; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: THE SENIOR HAD TO LEAVE HOME DURING HIS SOPHOMORE YEAR WHEN HIS 
MOTHER BECAME ILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was moments after the final game of the regular season against Rowland High 
last week, and Nogales running back Tyrone Edwards had his reasons for being 
excited. 
</P>
<P>
After all, he had scored a touchdown and played an integral role in leading the 
undefeated Nobles to a victory and their first Sierra League title since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
With his 47 yards rushing, he had also surpassed the 1,000-yard rushing plateau 
for the second consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
But for the 17-year-old senior, the biggest thrill of the night was yet to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
That was when, for the first time in more than two years, Edwards went home to 
live with his mother in West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even care if I didn't get a single yard," Edwards said. "It just made 
my night so much better to know I was going back home. It was on my mind all 
game and my teammates knew about it and that made us all feel better." 
</P>
<P>
It was Edward's first night at home since the start of his sophomore year, when 
his mother, Jennie, was hospitalized with a heart murmur. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother was sick and she was in the hospital a lot, and the bills just got 
so high that she couldn't afford for me to live with her," he said. "So she 
moved in with a friend and I was given a choice of either living with my dad or 
moving in with (a guardian)." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards said he wouldn't have minded moving in with his father, Clarence, who 
was divorced from his mother when Edwards was 7. But living with his father 
would have meant transferring from Nogales to Washington High in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to stay at Nogales because I had friends here and I was familiar with 
the environment," he said. "I liked it here and I was doing well in sports and 
in my classes." 
</P>
<P>
His father agreed to allow Edwards to stay in Nogales and live with a guardian. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted me to stay with him, but he also wanted what was best for me," 
Edwards said. "So he just told me to stay here and handle it, and that's what I 
did." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards found a temporary guardian, junior varsity football Coach Don Montenez, 
with the help of former Nogales basketball Coach Mike Southworth. 
</P>
<P>
"I give a lot of credit to Mike Southworth, because he gave me the chance to 
stay here," Edwards said. "He knew a coach here and he asked if I could stay 
with him." 
</P>
<P>
It was a convenient arrangement for Edwards at the time because Montenez also 
coached him on the junior varsity football team. 
</P>
<P>
"Don Montenez was my coach for my games, so I knew at least I would get a ride 
home," he said. "But he lived in Rancho Cucamonga, and after the football 
season I knew I really had to move." 
</P>
<P>
About four months after he started living with Montenez, Edwards moved in with 
Richard George, his junior high school basketball coach. He lived with George 
for about eight months before moving again, this time for living for about 14 
months with Bob Wilson and his family. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to live with a friend from school and his family because it was closer 
and easier for me to live there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The constant moving didn't affect Edwards' performance on the field or in the 
classroom. In addition to rushing for 1,000 yards or more the last two seasons, 
he has maintained a grade-point average of 3.0 or higher. 
</P>
<P>
Second-year Nogales football Coach Brian Beveridge said he has been astonished 
by what Edwards has accomplished through difficult times. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was introduced to Tyrone last year, the other coaches filled me in 
about his situation," Beveridge said. "The amazing thing is that he's been able 
to do what he has with all of those things going on around him. He's done a 
marvelous job of keeping everything together under difficult circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
The coach said it would be difficult to tell that Edwards had any personal 
problems simply by watching or being around him. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not anything outward about him -- his grades, his personality or the 
way he plays -- to tell you that he's had these problems in his life," 
Beveridge said. "To look or talk to him, you'd never know about it. You'd never 
know some of these things even existed in his life. He's the kind of person 
who's just a pleasure to be around." 
</P>
<P>
Beveridge said that as result of his problems outside of school, Edwards is 
probably more mature than most people his age. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents helped change my attitude toward myself as if to say: 'You're a man 
now. You know what life is about,' " Edwards said. "My mom has been sorry about 
what's happened to me, but she's happy because she gave me the initiative to 
become a man." 
</P>
<P>
His attitude keeps Edwards from getting too carried away with his success on 
the football field. 
</P>
<P>
"When they talk about people having a big head, I know that's childish," he 
said. "I'm over that kind of thing. I'm looking at my sports that I play in 
high school and my grades as my career right now, and that's just the way I 
treat it." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards rushed for 1,100 yards as a junior and 1,001 yards and 11 touchdowns on 
122 carries this season -- an average of 8.2 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards said the first three games this season were especially difficult for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew they were keying on me, but I didn't make it any better by being 
tentative when I was carrying the ball," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That prompted a heart-to-heart discussion with his coach. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a new line and he had to gain confidence, and we also set him aside and 
talked to him and how he's a lot more aware of himself," Beveridge said. "Since 
the fourth game, he has really come on." 
</P>
<P>
Said Edwards: "Last year I was a little spoiled because our line just gave me 
the holes all the time. After the first three games I talked to the coaches and 
we decided I just had to bear down more and take whatever (defenses) gave me." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Edwards has averaged nearly 150 yards over the past six games. 
</P>
<P>
"He's big and he's intelligent and he's just a good athlete," Beveridge said. 
"We've been very lucky to have a player like him. As a coach I've never had 
someone with his size and speed together. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-2, 185-pound Edwards said 21 schools have recruited him. He has 
scheduled his first recruiting trip to the University of Arizona for Jan. 11 
and also hopes to visit USC and UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
He said USC is probably his top choice at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
"SC's always been my No. 1 school," he said. "If you're a California native, 
it's a big influence to go there." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards is looking forward to helping the Nobles try to win their first CIF 
title. Nogales is seeded No. 2 in Division IV and plays host to Covina at 7:30 
p.m. Friday in a first-round playoff game.

RESURGENT CONDORS WILL PLAY BALDWIN PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For most of the 1980s, California High School would win about one football game 
a year and then try a new coach. Times have changed. 
</P>
<P>
The Condors, in their second season under Coach Tom Tereschuk, are one of 19 
Southeast/Long Beach area teams in the Southern Section Playoffs and will play 
at Baldwin Park on Friday night. Cal finished in second place in the Whitmont 
League with a 5-2 record and was 5-5 overall. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's pretty happy here," Tereschuk said. 
</P>
<P>
The high-scoring Whittier team is led by junior quarterback Larry Haney, who 
has thrown for 2,106 yards and 22 touchdowns. His top receivers are senior Toby 
Wickoff, who has caught 58 passes for 787 yards and 12 touchdowns, and junior 
Paul Martinez, who has caught 48 passes for 622 yards and seven TDs.

GOOD SPORTS SEND BASEBALL CARDS TO GULF; 
</P>
<P>
MORALE: LAWNDALE SHOP OWNER MOBILIZES COLLECTORS TO DONATE THOUSANDS OF CARDS 
TO BORED AMERICAN TROOPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As President Bush gears up to send more armored divisions to the Persian Gulf, 
Dugout Baseball Cards owner Perry Dodd is planning to send a few big guns of 
his own -- former slugger Reggie Jackson, all-star pitcher Dennis (Oil Can) 
Boyd and superstar shortstop Ozzie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The players, of course, won't be boarding jets for the Middle East. But 
thousands of baseball cards bearing their pictures and those of other sports 
heroes will. 
</P>
<P>
Moved by newspaper accounts of the boredom of the men and women in uniform in 
Saudi Arabia, Dodd figured he was staring at thousands of examples of the 
perfect antidote. So last month, the 29-year-old baseball enthusiast started 
setting aside cards and soliciting donations from the regulars who frequent his 
shop in a mini-mall on Prairie Avenue in Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
"Just hearing about how bored they are over there, I thought it would be an 
interesting thing (the troops) could do," Dodd said. "Baseball is the 
all-American pastime. I thought they would enjoy trading them, or just using 
them to break the ice." 
</P>
<P>
Draped with American flags and sports banners, Dodd's shop is also stocked with 
bubble gum and beef jerky shaped to resemble chewing tobacco. Visitors speak in 
low voices so as not to disturb customers who are absorbed in the sports trivia 
on the backs of cards. 
</P>
<P>
A handwritten sign over a table stacked with baseball cards at the back of the 
store declares: "Bring a 'peace' of America to the Middle East. We are sending 
sports cards. Goal -- 10,000. Any donations are appreciated." 
</P>
<P>
When Dodd penned the sign, he expected that it would take a while to meet his 
goal. But customers greeted the idea with so much enthusiasm that he now 
expects to be able to send twice that many -- more than $2,000 worth -- by the 
end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish we could send more," Dodd said. "There's so many guys over there, and 
I'm not going to be able to get cards to one-tenth" of them. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd isn't the only one in the sports card business hoping to send a piece of 
America to the troops in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
A card shop in Illinois recently donated 800 cases of baseball cards to the 
Middle East, and Upper Deck, a major manufacturer of cards, expects to be 
sending baseball and other sports cards for the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
But Navy Lt. Phillip Ishikawa of the Defense Logistics Agency said hobby items 
such as sports cards are one thing Operation Desert Shield's soldiers just 
can't get enough of. Such gifts do not go unnoticed, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"The Defense Department appreciates all the help people are sending," Ishikawa 
said last week. "It's very important psychologically (for the troops) because 
it lets them know the American people are behind them. The psychological edge 
of knowing that people haven't forgotten about you is important to your 
morale." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in the three months since the agency began manning a phone bank to take 
calls from people who want to make donations, more than 3,000 companies and 
individuals have given the troops a vast array of goods, including books, 
videocassettes, lip balm, hair products, boomerangs, dumbbells, puzzles, 
stationery, sardines and bottles of steak sauce. 
</P>
<P>
One man donated 2,000 footballs, a woman gave away five tons of groceries and a 
company recently offered to send 300,000 headset radios to the troops. 
</P>
<P>
"Books are no longer on the list because some publishing companies have been 
sending a lot of them," Ishikawa said. "One of the things we are emphasizing is 
that people want hobby items, games and card games." 
</P>
<P>
With at least 5 million avid sports card collectors in the United States, Dodd 
is convinced the cards offer just the kind of fun and morale boost the troops 
will need to keep their minds occupied during the holidays. Collectors could 
spend hours memorizing statistics, or looking for cards bearing players from 
their hometowns or schools, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shoe wholesaler Jerry Gelbrich, 38, who donated 150 cards to Dodd's cause, said 
he decided to participate in the giveaway out of concern for the soldier who 
"doesn't get to come home for Christmas, doesn't get to come home for 
Thanksgiving and doesn't get to watch the Lakers play basketball." 
</P>
<P>
"The kid that gets a card -- maybe it's his favorite player or his home team," 
Gelbrich said. "It may not be worth more than 10 cents, but it still might mean 
a lot to him." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some of the card packs could contain a few surprises, Dodd said. 
In some instances, a $1 pack of 10 cards may contain a collector's card worth 
25 times as much as the entire pack, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of (the cards he plans to give away) are new cards of people that 
aren't yet really successful, rookies that are really nobodies now but in a 
couple years could be real special," Dodd said. "But the ones who get the 
cards, if they hold onto them a couple years, they could be very valuable." 
</P>
<P>
Card shop devotee Edwin Rodriguez, 14, one of Dodd's biggest contributors, said 
he decided to part with 800 sports cards in the interest of serving his 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like I'm really going to miss those cards, but it's not like they're 
really cheap or anything," Rodriquez said of his donation, which he said is 
worth more than $80. "It's a little sacrifice. I feel if I can help my country 
in any little way, well, I'll do it."

FISHING NOTES;

<P>
ANGLERS ENJOY A LATE-SEASON RUN OF YELLOWTAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A large body of squid floating off Redondo Canyon has sparked a wide-open late 
season yellowtail bite. 
</P>
<P>
The squid invasion that normally occurs in abundance at Catalina Island from 
November to early March moved closer to mainland beaches with the warm current. 
</P>
<P>
The South Bay party boat fleet has reported several 100-fish counts. 
</P>
<P>
Anglers on three-quarter day and half-day boats fishing from rocky point to the 
horseshoe kelp have been catching 10-fish limits on most trips. 
</P>
<P>
Fleet captains agree the yellowtail have been in the local kelp since the warm 
summer current arrived, but refused anchovies, sardines and jigs so no 
substantial numbers were caught until now. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the fish caught locally are in the 18- to 20-pound class. 
</P>
<P>
The overnight boats have been fishing San Clemente and Santa Barbara islands 
with live squid and finding the yellowtails in the 28- to 35-pound class. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Harbor Sportfishing's Shogun returned with yellowtails from 22 to 30 
pounds on weekend trips. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing aboard the Shogun on his first fishing trip, Gardena fisherman Eung Joo 
Yeon, 21, caught a 32 1/2-pound yellowtail and won the jackpot using 20-pound 
test line. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Kohe of Redondo Beach was a close contender with a 31-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Prospects for an early winter white sea bass run could develop with this year's 
early squid migration. 
</P>
<P>
Anglers on Redondo Sportfishing's Sea Spray, fishing at rocky point Monday, 
caught four white sea bass up to 30 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Three South Bay fishermen returned early Tuesday from fishing the Clarion 
Islands in Mexico aboard the Royal Star. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Yamada of Manhattan Beach caught a yellowfin tuna that weighed 218 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Don Kiyuna of Torrance caught a 75-pound wahoo. 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Misaka of Redondo Beach caught a 74-pound dorado. 
</P>
<P>
King Harbor Marlin Club member Chuck White, fishing Tanner Bank from his boat 
Pacific Venture, caught a 26-pound yellowfin tuna using 20-pound test line. 
</P>
<P>
Club member Linda Koconkes, fishing the kelp at Palos Verdes from her boat the 
Hi-Dry, caught a black sea bass estimated to weigh 25 pounds. She released it 
unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: Trevor Gray of Redondo Beach, fishing off Santa Barbara 
aboard the Blackjack, caught the whopper of the week, a 37-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Maeda of West Los Angeles, fishing at rocky point aboard the Sea Spray, 
caught a 33-pound white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Pagneo La Ferrell of Torrance, fishing aboard the City of Redondo, caught a 
25-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Taira of West Los Angeles, fishing aboard the Monte Carlo at horseshoe 
kelp, caught a 24 1/2-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Selma Goldman of Long Beach, fishing at horseshoe kelp aboard the Hitless Miss, 
caught a 24-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Hart of San Pedro, fishing at San Clemente Island aboard the Shogun, 
caught five yellowtail, the largest a 23-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
Don Shearing of Palos Verdes, fishing at San Nicholas Island aboard the Condor, 
caught a 22-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Fish Reports: Yellowtail catches continue all along the South Bay fishing area. 
Island fishing for yellowtail with some bluefin tuna at Tanner Bank dominates 
the overnight boat catches. 
</P>
<P>
At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Del Mar, fishing the bay, had a catch of 51 
barracuda, 35 calico bass, 20 sculpin and three white sea bass.

<P>
LEWIS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TO REOPEN BY FALL OF '91 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Downey Unified School District Board of Education has decided to reopen 
Lewis Elementary School, which has not been used for elementary classes for 13 
years, to help cope with anticipated overcrowded conditions next year. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted unanimously to reopen the school for the start of the 1991-92 
academic year. 
</P>
<P>
Located at 13220 S. Bellflower Blvd., the school has room for about 600 pupils 
in first through fifth grades, said Gary Orsinger, assistant superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was closed in June, 1977, as enrollment declined in the district, 
Orsinger said. Since then, the district has held adult school classes at the 
campus. It also leases a portion of the campus to the Steenhoek Learning 
Center, a private day-care center that will have to relocate. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are tentatively projecting a 3% growth in the 15,500-student district 
next year. At that rate, the district will need space for about 460 students. 
The district already houses some students in portable classrooms. A committee 
is being formed to determine which students will attend Lewis School, Orsinger 
said.

LONG BEACH TO START RECYCLE PLAN IN MAY; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: NEARLY 90,000 HOMES AND BUSINESSES SHOULD BE INVOLVED BY JULY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Next spring, 10 years after officials first promised to bring a recycling 
program to the city, homes and businesses in Long Beach are supposed to begin 
sorting their trash. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the City Council approved a recycling program that calls on 
residents to separate bottles, newspapers, containers and batteries from the 
city's yearly collection of 400,000 tons of trash. 
</P>
<P>
Every home and business currently served by the city's refuse service -- about 
half of them in the city -- will be participating by next summer, if all goes 
according to plan. The city has not yet figured out which neighborhoods will 
begin recycling first. 
</P>
<P>
The program attempts to comply with a state law, passed last year, which 
requires cities to cut the amount of waste they send to landfills in half by 
the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Failure to comply with the law could cost Long Beach up to $10,000 a day in 
fines. The recycling program is voluntary, for now. But if residents do not 
cooperate, city officials may need to impose fines. "The state has set up some 
real ambitious goals," the city's recycling coordinator, Jim Kuhl, said after 
Tuesday's meeting. "We don't have a lot of time left." 
</P>
<P>
City leaders first promised a recycling plan 10 years ago, when they developed 
a two-part trash plan. The plan included a recycling program and the 
construction of an incinerator that would burn trash, converting it to energy. 
</P>
<P>
The hulking incinerator sits on Terminal Island. But city officials have been 
so busy dealing with its legal, financial and operating problems that they put 
off developing the recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
The only places to take bottles and cans for recycling were operated by private 
companies. The only people who used them were a relatively small number of 
residents and homeless people who needed the money from cans and bottles. 
</P>
<P>
"Now recycling will be more convenient for everybody," Kuhl said. 
</P>
<P>
About one in five Long Beach residences are to begin recycling next May. By 
July, that number should triple to nearly all of the 90,000 homes and apartment 
houses currently served by city refuse workers. 
</P>
<P>
City officials plan to pass an ordinance that will require the private trash 
companies that haul the rest of the city's trash to offer customers a similar 
recycling service next year. 
</P>
<P>
The program means residents will have to do some thinking before they toss out 
their garbage. 
</P>
<P>
Metal, plastic and glass containers need to be washed and tossed into a special 
bin provided by the city. Newspapers must be wrapped in brown paper bags and 
put in the bin, too. Batteries can be put in a special pocket in the bin. 
</P>
<P>
The city has not yet figured out what it wants residents to do with scraps from 
yards, such as tree trimmings and grass clippings. 
</P>
<P>
Residents will be spared one step in the recycling process -- they do not have 
to separate the various items. All metal, glass and plastic will be put into 
one bin, city officials said, because the city wants to keep things as simple 
as possible. 
</P>
<P>
That will encourage participation, Kuhl said. Plus, it would have been 
difficult, he said, to translate the complicated rules for the city's ethnic 
populations. 
</P>
<P>
The program is expected to cost each household up to $2 in addition to the $10 
or so it is now paying to the city for refuse collection. 
</P>
<P>
In a related program to begin next September, a new fleet of automated garbage 
trucks will haul garbage for about 20,000 homes. Officials hope to save the 
city thousands of dollars in personnel costs, which can be used to offset the 
start-up costs of the recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
Residents will be charged for the new automated service based on the amount of 
garbage they produce every week. Officials hope that this will encourage people 
to turn to recycling as a way to cut down on their volume of garbage. 
</P>
<P>
Ambitious as it sounds, the curb-side recycling program will result in only a 
10% reduction in the household trash put out by roughly half of the city's 
homes, Kuhl said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the city's waste comes from yards and construction sites. 
</P>
<P>
The city needs to figure out how to recycle these materials as well by July 1 
to comply with state law, Kuhl said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an incredible amount of work to be done," Kuhl said. "But this program 
is a step in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
Most members of the City Council praised the program. 
</P>
<P>
"We all have to realize that we live on a little old spaceship that is called 
Earth," Mayor Ernie Kell told the council. "It only contains so many natural 
resources, and when these are gone, these are gone. We have a moral obligation 
not to leave a pile of trash for our children and our grandchildren." 
</P>
<P>
Warren Harwood, the only council member to vote against the measure, said he 
wanted more specific information on how much the program would cost and how it 
would be implemented. "We're writing a blank check," he said before the 
meeting. "The potential is great that this could just end up forcing residents 
to dig deeper into their own pockets." 
</P>
<P>
Several councilmen also worried that front curb pickup would leave ugly trash 
along the streets. 
</P>
<P>
And Harwood thought that basing pickup rates on the amount of garbage put out 
by each household discriminated against people with big yards. 
</P>
<P>
Was it fair, he asked, to charge somebody extra money for cleanup because he 
owned messy "shrubbery somebody might have planted 20 years ago?" 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Wallace Edgerton came up with a solution: compost. He recalled how 
his parents used to scold him for throwing out weeds. "It's very simple to make 
yourself a mulch box," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are returning to some of the things we used to do in the earlier days," he 
said, before it became "easier just to throw things in the trash." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ray Grabinski also waxed nostalgic. He said that when he was a boy, 
"everybody had to sort through bottles." 
</P>
<P>
Grabinski said that residents are eager to start the program. "People are 
chomping at the bit," he said.

<P>
City officials said they hope an education program involving the distribution 
of tapes and videos in schools and public meetings will lead residents to 
cooperate with the program. 
</P>
<P>
Officials pointed out that while it may be a hassle to pick through the sticky 
trash, one day residents stand to make a profit. 
</P>
<P>
In Pacific Rim countries such as Japan, there is a growing market for garbage 
that can be recycled into metal, Kuhl said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now one day tuna cans from Long Beach may be part of a Toyota," Kuhl said 
after Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
HOW IT WILL WORK Highlights of Long Beach's recycling plan: 
</P>
<P>
* The city will provide a bin for bottles, cans, other containers and 
newspapers. Residents should place newspapers in brown paper bags before 
discarding. 
</P>
<P>
* City workers will pick up bins weekly from front curbs. 
</P>
<P>
The bill for residential trash pickup will increase as much as $2 per household 
from about $10 a month.

<TEXT>
<P>
About 180 people of all types and ages are congregated in an open courtyard, 
where they have come to sip exotic brew and subject themselves to the spoken 
words of the wise and the wacko. 
</P>
<P>
A man wearing a moth-eaten sweater and black cord jeans stands before them, 
clutching a notebook in his right hand and raising his clenched left fist 
skyward like some hero from a Greek tragedy. His voice rises and wanes with 
each stanza he dramatically reads from his latest poem. Behind the hanging 
sheet that serves as a backdrop, another man points two flashlights in various 
directions that come through as stars bouncing to the poet's reading rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
The gathering is at Deidrich's Coffee in Costa Mesa. And those in attendance 
have come for poetry and java, as they have every third Monday of each month 
for the last year, served up in a program called the "Cafe of Dreams." The 
event is part of a recent Southland trend known as "performance poetry" that 
has the nation's poets turning their heads west toward this burgeoning literary 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
Performance poetry weds the spoken word with performance art, sometimes 
incorporating theatrics, voice dynamics or props. The genre has become so 
popular that Los Angeles held a poetry festival last month that featured over 
200 poets and attracted an audience of about 2,200. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, performance poetry is also catching on, with 10 regularly 
scheduled readings per month and several more scattered throughout the year. 
The longest-running and most frequent reading in the county -- the Laguna Poets 
-- happens every Friday evening, except major holidays, at the Laguna Beach 
Public Library. Founded by Marta Mitrovich 18 years ago, the group also has a 
tradition of inviting well-known poets like Allen Ginsburg and Gary Snyder to 
read as part of the annual Laguna Arts Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the readings follow a similar format, presenting at least two featured 
readers -- who are chosen by the organizers based on their work or reputation 
-- and providing an opportunity for poets to sign up and perform their work to 
a somewhat captive audience. The latter segment is known as an open reading. 
The cover charge is always less than the cost of a movie, and sometimes free. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the readings, poetry journals and specialized poets' groups are 
becoming established and receiving recognition outside county boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Poets and followers agree that the popularity of live poetry depends as much on 
the way words are spoken as it does on the words themselves. "No one wants to 
sit through an hour of mumble mumble," said poetry enthusiast Michael Logue. 
"We decided from the beginning not just to get good writers, but good readers." 
</P>
<P>
Logue has become somewhat of a celebrity in Orange County's poetry community 
since 1988, when he and fiancee Tina Rinaldi co-founded Poets Reading Inc., a 
Fullerton-based nonprofit organization that holds bimonthly readings at the 
Fullerton Museum Center, publishes a magazine for poetry and discussion called 
The Quarterly, and provides scholarships to aspiring poets attending an Orange 
County university or college. 
</P>
<P>
A writer and computer consultant whose baroque attire reflects his eclectic 
personality, Logue also donates much of his energy, time and computer equipment 
to organizing special events featuring renowned writers. British poets Ian 
Whitcomb and Thomas Gunn and Irish poet James Simmons were invited to read last 
month as part of the Festival of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Logue doesn't believe that Poets Reading Inc. should be so closely identified 
with him, citing the work of Rinaldi and 18 dedicated volunteers. "I certainly 
don't do this for my health or as a personal glory vehicle," he said. "I do it 
to promote the literary arts, to provide a forum -- both written and oral -- 
for local writers." 
</P>
<P>
Also intent on promoting live poetry is Lee Mallory, a poet and English 
professor at Rancho Santiago College. He and Jana Kiedrowski have presented the 
"Factory" the first Monday of each month since late 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Jokingly referred to as "the reading that wouldn't die," its dedicated 
following has had to relocate several times because of a series of unfortunate 
circumstances at the restaurants they used. Their first site and namesake, the 
Chicago Pizza Factory in Santa Ana, went bankrupt, as did their second venue, 
and the last site burned down. The Factory's latest home, at the Casa Palma 
Mexican restaurant in Santa Ana, has remained free from catastrophe since May. 
</P>
<P>
Mallory believes a restaurant offers a casual and festive atmosphere conducive 
to the creative, spontaneous and often shocking works read in Factory 
gatherings. (Those attending a recent reading also seemed to enjoy the 
margaritas, chips and salsa.) "We pride ourselves on the 'anything goes that's 
good' philosophy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This "anything goes" philosophy also applies when Anvil Productions, Unlimited, 
serves up poetic lunacy with the "Cafe of Dreams" at Deidrich's Coffee. A theme 
is designated each month for discussion and contemplation among the readers and 
guests, like this month's focus on stress release that encourages everyone to 
bring a percussion instrument for Monday's 15-minute beat-it-out session. 
Noise, music and verbal interaction with the audience complement the poetry. 
Hostess Marsha Muscato is the only poet from the four-member Anvil Productions, 
which includes co-host Randy Bird and his wife, Bonnie, and photographer Kip 
Duff working behind the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
According to Deidrich's Coffee owner Martin Deidrich, a New York poet visiting 
last month's reading called the turnout and participation phenomenal compared 
to poetic activity in the Big Apple. 
</P>
<P>
"I am hosting the poetry readings because I like attending these sort of 
things," Deidrich said. He plans to start his own in-house program of weekly 
entertainment and events at his Costa Mesa coffeehouse, which will eventually 
spread to his Tustin location, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ipso facto and Gallery 57, named after the stores they inhabit in Old Towne 
Fullerton, were started this year by Elliott Rogers, a poet and substitute 
teacher in the Fullerton Elementary School District as an outlet for the 16- to 
24-year-old crowd and for those poets who were "censored or turned away at the 
other places" because of language that some might consider shocking or vulgar. 
</P>
<P>
Ipso facto takes place every third Friday of the month and is strictly an open 
reading, without scheduled poets and without any language, content or time 
restrictions. The no-holds-barred attitude carries over to the 
all-featured-readers format at Gallery 57 every first Thursday of the month. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller, intimate readings drawing only a dozen or so people -- which may be 
more in tune with the introspective personalities of many poets -- have taken 
place in the last few months at the Dana Point Bookstore and Anaheim's Caffe 
Gourmet. 
</P>
<P>
Some organizers, including Poets Reading Inc., limit the use of profanity and 
topics that appear to be used purely for shock value. "We're more mature than 
to listen to shock-value profanity," said Logue. "Although some of our poets 
use language and subjects that might seem obscene to some people, as long as 
it's within context to the work, we only ask the audience to bring an open 
mind." 
</P>
<P>
While some might consider any restrictions censorship, John Brugaletta, a 
published poet and professor of English and comparative literature at Cal State 
Fullerton, says that's not necessarily the case. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be like an editor of a magazine," he said. "If you say no, they 
could always go somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Brugaletta also serves as chief editor for the South Coast Poetry Journal, a 
book published biannually at Cal State Fullerton featuring works by 
internationally known and unknown writers. The SCPJ staff, made up from a 
selected group of students, sorts through an average of 75 submissions a week 
deciding what goes and what doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
He and other poets have questioned whether the lack of standards at some 
performance poetry venues make it a kind of fast-food art that has little 
literary value and only aims to gratify a visually oriented society. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost like a group of people are trying to challenge what is acceptable 
in poetry," said Shannan Batts, a poet and student editor of SCPJ. "Like we're 
supposed to compete about who has the proper definition of poetry or as if 
anything can be poetry -- not that it really is." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Peters also disputes the innovation and talent of many local poets and 
journals. A nationally known poet, critic, and professor at the UC Irvine, his 
credits include "The Peter's Black and Blue Guide to Literary Journals" and 
"The Great American Poetry Bake-Off" -- a collection of essays and reviews. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm puzzled by the safe, even bland, approach they always take," he said. "It 
would be great to see a whole bunch of energetic, experimental writers, but I 
just don't see that here. It seems they're afraid to push that sanitized norm 
for the arts O.C. is famous for." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Hoffen, poet and editor of the poetry magazine Free Lunch, agrees with 
Peters. Since 1988, the Laguna Niguel-based nonprofit magazine has been 
distributed free to poets three times a year throughout the country. Always 
looking for new, unestablished, experimental poets, Hoffen said he finds few 
with any quality among local artists. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not against poetry being accessible to all people, but I have to wonder 
whether performance poetry, which is becoming very popular here, is showmanship 
or art," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But there are its defenders. Charles Webb, a published poet who has also been 
included in the latest SCPJ edition and is an English professor at Cal State 
Long Beach, has documented this West Coast live poetry phenomenon in a 
collection called "Stand-up Poetry," which features some of the best L.A. 
writers of the genre. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many people who prefer to write performance poetry off as fluff," 
Webb said, "but the best of performance poetry still works on the page and is 
just as open to analysis and deep reading." 
</P>
<P>
Poets, reading organizers and followers contend that as Orange County's culture 
continues to develop, it is vital that the literary arts at any level receive 
attention and support from the public. 
</P>
<P>
Terri Joseph, a poet and English professor at Chapman College, has long been 
involved with organizing campus-based events like the Distinguished Writer 
Series that are tailored for the public. She also works on the staff of the 
California State Poetry Quarterly, a collection of works from throughout the 
country, co-published by Chapman College and the California Poetry Society. 
</P>
<P>
"Poetry really belongs to the people who practice it," she said, "and the trend 
to take it out of textbook and make it a performance makes it more accessible 
to an audience without a strong literary background."

NAME CHANGE: David Rothenberg, burned in a 1983 Buena Park fire set by his 
father, has made clear he doesn't want to see his dad again, and now he has 
dropped the name too. . . .David, 14, is now David Jordan Robinson, after 
taking the names of basketball stars Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls and 
David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs, both of whom befriended him. Charles 
Rothenberg (A3) consented to the change but wanted David to ask in a "Dear Dad" 
letter. David wrote the letter -- to "Dear Charles." Nancy Wride and Herman

CALLING UP OF 72,500 MORE RESERVISTS OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Wednesday authorized the call-up of another 
72,500 National Guard and reserve troops to serve in Operation Desert Shield -- 
a move certain to affect civilian life throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The new authority, which does not require the approval of Congress, more than 
doubles the number of citizen-soldiers that the Pentagon may call to active 
duty. The Army is expected to call up more of the 122,500 guardsmen and 
reservists now available than any other branch of the military. 
</P>
<P>
The order came less than a week after President Bush ordered a massive buildup 
of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf. That announcement last Thursday mentioned 
the possible deployment of 12,000 combat reservists. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the remaining 60,000 reserve slots permitted under the new mandate 
would likely be filled by reservists trained in combat support functions, such 
as engineering services, supplies, communications and military police. 
</P>
<P>
Among 17 naval reserve units called to active duty Wednesday was the 4th Light 
Armored Vehicle Company A, a Santa Ana-based medical unit that will support the 
Marines, the Pentagon said. 
</P>
<P>
But officials at the Naval Reserve Center in Santa Ana said they have received 
no word yet about the deployment and had no details on what it would mean for 
the troops. 
</P>
<P>
"If they're going to go, we don't have anything on it," said Chief Petty 
Officer Ron Gross, command chief at the Santa Ana reserve center. "We've got to 
wait until somebody says they're going. If we had word -- any word -- we'd be 
calling them right now." 
</P>
<P>
Gross said the center has been getting frequent calls from its reservists for 
weeks as rumors and reports spread about who might be activated. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been alerted way back in August that you all better get your papers in 
order because when the time comes. . . . But they're all in good spirits. 
They're all good sailors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Navy and the Marines did not say what the company's role 
might be, once activated. 
</P>
<P>
In past weeks, some activated medical reservists in Orange County have been 
assigned to Camp Pendleton and other bases to fill in for personnel who had 
been deployed in the Middle East. But some military sources speculated that the 
Santa Ana company might act as a medical support for the 5th Marine 
Expeditionary Brigade, which is heading overseas. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon announced last week that the 5th Brigade would be sent to the 
Persian Gulf in the largest call-up yet involving Orange County area troops. 
The Marines generally rely on the Navy for their medical personnel, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The heavy reliance on reservists in the projected new wave of deployments 
underscores the military's heavy reliance on Guard and reserve forces during an 
emergency. It is also expected to provide a stern test of that dependence. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's armed forces are designed with combat support . . . built into the 
reserves," Cheney said in announcing the new authority Wednesday. "As we 
increase the deployment of active-duty forces, we must also call upon more 
members of the National Guard and reserve." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney in August authorized the military services to call to active duty a 
total of 50,000 National Guard and reserve troops. The services so far have 
called up 36,073 such troops, and several thousand Air Guard and other 
reservists have volunteered for duty in the gulf. All of those called so far 
have been combat support specialists. 
</P>
<P>
The expected call-up of thousands more "weekend warriors" is certain to leave 
employers throughout the country with sudden gaps in their work force. 
</P>
<P>
In search of cost savings over the last decade, the armed services have shifted 
the burden of supporting any large-scale deployment of forces to such 
citizen-soldiers. As a result, most of the medical personnel, combat engineers, 
communications technicians and administrators that the military requires during 
a conflict would be drawn from guardsmen and reservists working day-to-day in 
the civilian sector. 
</P>
<P>
Already in Operation Desert Shield, Guard and reserve units have fulfilled 
critical roles in providing medical care, ferrying troops and equipment, 
organizing and transporting military supplies inside Saudi Arabia and purifying 
drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what they drill for" in reserve training exercises, said Rep. G. V. 
(Sonny) Montgomery (D-Miss.), a leading congressional advocate of Guard and 
reserve forces. "It's why we pay them such good money. And it's a good buy for 
the taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
The call-up of Guard and reserve forces for Operation Desert Shield encountered 
its first legal snag Tuesday, when a sergeant in the Army National Guard 
challenged as unconstitutional an order transferring him to Saudi Arabia with 
his unit. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Michael R. Ange charged in a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court that the 
order violates a constitutional provision that empowers Congress, and not the 
President, to declare war. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, President Bush notified Congress that he is extending for an 
additional 90 days the call-up authority for reservists already serving 90-day 
stints in the Persian Gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
Under a measure approved by Congress last month, new Guard and reserve units 
called to active duty will be able to serve for 180 days, and the President 
will be permitted to extend their tours by another 180 days. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon had sought the extended-service authorization so that it can 
activate combat guardsmen and reservists, many of whom will require further 
training before serving in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the congressional action, Cheney last week announced the first 
call-up of combat reservists in the gulf operation. The Pentagon is dispatching 
to Saudi Arabia three combat brigades of National Guardsmen: the 155th Armored 
Brigade from Mississippi, the 48th Mechanized Infantry Brigade from Georgia and 
the 256th Mechanized Infantry Brigade from Louisiana.

As the wind began to kick up one afternoon this summer, the dust wafted across 
Bolsa Chica Road and into nearby back yards, coating lawn furniture and landing 
on pools. 
</P>
<P>
The wind stiffened, and within minutes the swirling dust cloud blanketed roof, 
patios, cars and, in some cases, indoor carpeting, furniture and drapes with a 
thick layer of fine dirt. For drivers, visibility was reduced to less than 50 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
It was the beginning of a five-hour episode July 26 that residents in a 
district of homes east of the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station call the Bolsa 
Chica Dust Bowl of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
It was the worst example of dust emanating from barren land on the naval 
station site, a problem that has grown in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The dust was the result of unusual weather conditions, particularly dry, 
powerful winds that also whipped up sprawling fires in Santa Barbara and 
elsewhere around the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
But residents of Westminster and Huntington Beach tracts south of Westminster 
Boulevard along the eastern side of Bolsa Chica Road say the storm illustrates 
the severity of the area's chronic dust problem. 
</P>
<P>
Almost daily, the winds blow, and so comes the drifting dirt. Residents say the 
dust routinely blows through windows, doors and chimneys, sullying drapes, 
carpets and furniture. Some have attributed sinus and bronchial problems to the 
dust clouds. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents of the area of comfortable, two-story homes say they keep their 
doors and windows closed, even during heat waves. And some say they have 
abandoned their back yards entirely. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't even use our back yard any more, Westminster resident Joyce Taylor 
said. "You can't; it's so filthy. We don't barbecue any more. . . . We had our 
grandchildren here last week, and we didn't even let them go out and play out 
back." 
</P>
<P>
Even before the July dust storm, the naval station was cited by the South Coast 
Air Quality Management District. The dusty conditions "can cause severe health 
problems," district spokeswoman Claudia Keith said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 250 residents signed a petition requesting a remedy, which was 
presented to naval officials. 
</P>
<P>
About one-fifth of the 5,000-acre naval station is barren land. Navy officials 
acknowledge that the problem has escalated during the last four years, for 
several reasons: 
</P>
<P>
* The statewide drought has dried up areas of Anaheim Bay National Wildlife 
Refuge, which is part of the base. 
</P>
<P>
* A row of adult oleander bushes and other plants, which for years had buffered 
the neighbors from the wind-swept silt, were removed during 1985 and 1986 
projects to widen a county flood-control channel running along the site's 
eastern border. Until last month, none of those plants had been replaced. 
</P>
<P>
* Some soil excavated for the expansion of the pier at the Port of Long Beach 
was dumped at the Seal Beach station on a strip 100 yards by 1 mile. 
</P>
<P>
To discuss solutions, officials from the naval station, Westminster and the 
County Environmental Management Agency have been holding monthly meetings with 
residents. The latest meeting is scheduled today. 
</P>
<P>
Since the meetings began in August, some short-term steps have been taken to 
curb the dirt. Three dirt roads have been treated with polymers. Each 
treatment, which last about three months, costs $25,000 to $30,000, Thomas 
said. The Navy also spent about $8,000 to pave some particularly offensive 
spots. 
</P>
<P>
Also, more than 800 oleander saplings, which Westminster bought for $1,000, 
were recently planted. 
</P>
<P>
Long-term solutions have been more difficult to find, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The best, least costly permanent solution, Thomas said, would be vegetation. 
The Navy is awaiting results from soil studies to determine what kinds of 
plants, requiring little or no watering, can grow there. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to deal with it, but we can't make plants grow overnight," he said.

POSTAL CENTER TO BE BUILT IN SOUTH COUNTY;

U.S. Postal Service officials said Wednesday that they will build a $30-million 
distribution center in South Orange County to make sure that letters mailed 
here will be delivered promptly throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
Hector Godinez, the postal service's regional postmaster, said a 
200,000-square-foot center will be built within four years at a site not yet 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going toe-to-toe trying to find a place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Godinez said the Postal Service wants to build in an area bordered by El Toro 
Road to the north, the proposed Foothill Transportation Corridor to the east, 
Crown Valley Parkway to the south and the proposed San Joaquin Transportation 
Corridor to the west. 
</P>
<P>
He said the new center will speed the delivery of letters mailed in the South 
County because they will no longer have to be trucked to the Santa Ana 
distribution center for sorting. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of our trucks get on the freeway about 5 or 6 in the afternoon, and if 
the freeways are congested, it can be tough to get the letters sorted and onto 
planes that are leaving at 9 p.m.," he said. "So instead of taking two days for 
a letter to get to the Midwest (or East Coast), it takes three." 
</P>
<P>
The new center will also assure that local letters will be delivered the next 
business day because they won't have to leave the area, Godinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Godinez said that about 6 million letters a day are sorted at the Santa Ana 
center. He said 2 million of those will be sorted at the new facility. 
</P>
<P>
No jobs will be created by the new center. The center's 2,000 employees will be 
taken from the 5,000 who now work in Santa Ana, many of whom already live in 
South County, Godinez said.

FOG A HANG-UP FOR AIRPORT TRAVELERS; 
</P>
<P>
WEATHER: A GRAY BLANKET KEEPS JOHN WAYNE RUNWAYS EMPTY AND PHONE BANKS FULL OF 
BUSINESS FLIERS TRYING TO RESCHEDULE CANCELED FLIGHTS.

Some sprinted through the cavernous airport terminal to the nearest telephone 
booth to reschedule appointments. Others took a more relaxed approach and 
perched themselves in the Orange Grill bar to wait for the fog to lift at John 
Wayne Airport on Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the pastime, nearly all early morning travelers to John Wayne had time 
to kill. A heavy blanket of fog reduced visibility to zero and forced the 
cancellation or delay of all commercial flights until 9:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"We sat in the plane for about an hour, then were told to wait," said Greg 
Paydock, one of dozens of businessmen and women to scramble to the banks of 
phone booths. "That was frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
Air travelers shouldn't suffer the same headaches today, according to weather 
forecasters. While some patches of fog were expected, visibility should not be 
affected, said Marty McKewon, a meteorologist for Kansas-based WeatherData, 
which does forecasting for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The fog disrupted airport operations for two hours, but that translated into 
longer delays for many travelers who missed connecting flights, like John 
McGovern. 
</P>
<P>
McGovern and his wife stared at the flight information screen and wondered what 
to make of the flashing CANCELED next to their flight to Phoenix. They knew 
they were not going to make a connection to New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it's an inconvenience, but what can you do?" said McGovern, who has 
been vacationing in Southern California for nine days. "I haven't seen fog all 
week, now this happens. It's Murphy at work." 
</P>
<P>
Phil McCarty passed the time slouched in a chair snoring peacefully among a 
pile of suit bags and briefcases strewn on the chairs. He and partner Pat 
Diamond were on their way to San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
"You can hang him from a meat hook and he'll fall asleep," Diamond said 
jokingly as he looked at the American Airlines check-in desk, watching for news 
of when the flight would take off. 
</P>
<P>
Meteorologist McKewon said the fog was caused by a storm front that swept from 
the Gulf of Alaska into Central California. The system created wet weather in 
the Pacific Northwest, but only caused a reversal of the wind pattern in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
That reversal, coupled with clear skies and low temperatures overnight, created 
the foggy condition along the coast, McKewon said. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California area should have scattered high clouds for the rest of 
the week, McKewon said, with a slight chance of rain over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement authorities said the fog also caused problems for rush-hour 
motorists on the San Diego Freeway, slowing traffic and causing numerous 
collisions as drivers tried to get to work in visibility as low as 25 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to drive with my head out the window," Orange County Sheriff's 
Department spokesman Lt. Richard J. Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol spokeswoman Angel Johnson said that most of the 
traffic accidents were fender-benders. "There wasn't anything really tragic out 
there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
CHP spokesman Officer Lyle Whitten said the accidents caused no injuries, 
although the fog was particularly dangerous because it covered parts of the 
freeway in large patches. 
</P>
<P>
"Drivers go into a pocket of fog at freeway speed, then they suddenly slow 
down," Whitten said. "That's when we have multiple rear-end collisions."

CITY OKS AGENCY FOR REDEVELOPMENT 
</P>

<P>
The City Council this week voted to form a redevelopment agency, saying the 
move was necessary to ensure the city's future financial well-being. 
</P>
<P>
Council members will serve both on the council and the agency. 
</P>
<P>
An eroding sales tax base and less funding from state and federal governments 
have forced the city to look into different ways to raise revenue, City Manager 
Robert C. Dunek said. 
</P>
<P>
Not having a redevelopment agency puts the city at a disadvantage in competing 
for new businesses, he said, noting that all cities within a 15-mile radius of 
Los Alamitos have such an agency. 
</P>
<P>
"The scare tactic of redevelopment is the idea that the city is falling apart," 
Councilman Ronald Bates said. " . . . That's just not the case. The issue is, 
the reality is competitiveness." 
</P>
<P>
While redevelopment has been talked about in general terms, no specific areas 
of the city have been targeted. 
</P>
<P>
The city has hired the consulting firm of GRC Inc. to help with the 
redevelopment plans. In the next few months, the consultant and city officials 
will study which areas might be suitable for redevelopment, Dunek said. 
</P>
<P>
Brice Russell of GRC Inc. set a tentative date of June, 1991, for pinpointing 
potential redevelopment areas. 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment agency was formed upon the recommendation of an advisory 
business committee that was established by the City Council last year after it 
became aware of the declining sales tax base. KATHIE BOZANICH

FEISTY COUNCIL PLANS SUIT COUNTERATTACK

<P>
The City Council will meet with City Atty. Doug Holland tonight to discuss a 
lawsuit filed against the city by its primary developer, the Mission Viejo Co. 
</P>
<P>
"The new council members ran on a platform of independence to the company and 
we will be eager to demonstrate that independence," said Councilman Robert A. 
Curtis, who endorsed two of the new council members -- Robert Breton and Sharon 
Cody -- in last week's election. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis, who earlier this year survived a recall effort that was heavily 
financed by the company and is likely to become the city's next mayor, said the 
new council "will not be intimidated by this litigation." 
</P>
<P>
In a 16-page lawsuit filed in Orange County Superior Court last Thursday, the 
company declared that it has the right to develop several parcels of land 
scattered across the city. City officials have earmarked a significant portion 
of the company's land for open space, but company officials insist that it has 
a right to develop the land under an agreement with the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors before the city was formed three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The company has asked the court to give it the right to go ahead with its 
development plans for the property. 
</P>
<P>
"We're willing to negotiate to sell the land to them," said company spokeswoman 
Wendy Wetzel, "but the city cannot unilaterally take our land without 
compensation." 
</P>
<P>
At a council meeting Tuesday night, outgoing Mayor Christian W. Keena said the 
lawsuit was "part of a grand scheme by the company to force the city to buy the 
land." 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the statement, Wetzel said: "We don't care who buys the land. We 
are land sellers and we are willing to sell it to whoever comes up with the 
cash." 
</P>
<P>
It appears the company and the new council are heading for a showdown. The 
company, which planned and built the planned community of 75,000 people, had 
contributed more than $300,000 to the unsuccessful recall campaign against 
Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
Wetzel denied that the company's action was meant to intimidate the new 
council. "We were forced to act now since we have only 30 days to challenge the 
city's environmental impact report which takes our land," she said. "It's 
unfortunate but we did not choose the timing." 
</P>
<P>
Curtis, a deputy district attorney for Riverside County, said the new council 
will ask its lawyers whether the city has the right to protect its open-space 
designations. 
</P>
<P>
"If the city attorney so advises, we will assert those rights," he said. DAVAN

ACTION ON TESTING OF PLUMBERS DELAYED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Plans for a controversial ordinance requiring plumbers working in the city to 
get special certification were delayed again by the City Council this week to 
allow more time for study. 
</P>
<P>
The council refused on Tuesday to take action after opponents charged that the 
proposed ordiance was a ploy by the plumbers' union to recruit members. 
Supporters of the measure countered that it was merely a way to protect 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Although the exact terms have not been worked out, the proposal calls for 
plumbers working in Cypress to pass a competence test. Currently, only the 
contractor is required to be certified. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the amount of work involved, city staff recommended that an outside 
organization be hired to do the actual testing. According to a city report, 
several organizations exist that handle the administration of the testing for a 
fee to the city, which is then passed on to plumbers in the form of a licensing 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
The Plumbing Industry Progress and Education Assn., a professional organization 
that has loose ties to plumbing unions, was recommended as a possible 
organization to administer the tests. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want a union coming into this city and telling people what the 
standards are," said Councilwoman Margaret Arnold, who was the only council 
member to take a position on the proposal. "I am strongly opposed to this." 
</P>
<P>
Proponents denied that the proposal was a ruse to increase the membership of 
plumbers' unions. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a union," said Robert Payne, who is a member of several 
professional plumbing organizations. "We just want to upgrade the profession." 
</P>
<P>
Payne said that everyone is allowed to take the test and study classes 
regardless of union membership. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John Kanel suggested the ordinance last month as a possible way to 
protect homeowners. Several cities in California now require extra testing for 
plumbers. LYNDA NATALI

Two Anaheim residents were arrested Wednesday after police searched their home 
and found more than three pounds of methamphetamines with an estimated street 
value of $150,000, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Vance Souza, 24, and Christal Conkle, 20, were taken to County Jail and booked 
on suspicion of possession of methamphetamines with intent to sell, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Placentia narcotics agents, who traced the suspects to Anaheim, said they found 
the drug prepackaged in small bags for street sales. Also seized was an 
undisclosed amount of cash at the residence. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests capped an investigation by Placentia's Special Enforcement Detail. 
No other information about the investigation or arrests was available.

CITY PULLS PLUG ON GOLF COURSE LIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After months of emotionally charged public hearings and negotiations, the City 
Council this week rejected lights for Ridgeline Golf Course -- a decision that 
leaves the future of the city's only public links and driving range in 
question. 
</P>
<P>
Council members, who were lobbied heavily by citizens on both sides of the 
issue, were hesitant to vote on the plan which has divided residents in the 
semi-rural area. They finally turned down the proposal by a vote of 3 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 people packed the council chambers to hear final arguments on whether 
to place 40 lights on the nine-hole course and driving range in east Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Don E. Smith asked twice for a motion before Councilman William G. 
Steiner finally proposed that the permit for the lights be denied. Smith cast 
the dissenting vote. Councilman Fred L. Barrera was absent. 
</P>
<P>
Steiner said that after visiting the golf course, he agreed with Orange Park 
Acres residents who argued that lights would increase evening traffic, an 
impact that would be "inconsistent with the integrity of that very unique rural 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Orange Park Acres, who have been fighting the lights since April, 
also worried that the plan would cause more commercialization. 
</P>
<P>
But supporters of the lights feared that without them the city might lose 
valuable open space and its only public golf and tennis club. 
</P>
<P>
Course owner David Freimann began to install the lights last March because 
extended hours were needed to make the course more profitable. Freimann said he 
had spent about $60,000 installing the lights when the city ordered him to stop 
work and get a conditional-use permit. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Freimann said, he will "have to pursue the possibility of developing the 
property. There's no sugar-coating that." 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Bieber, president of the lighting company hired by Freimann, said he 
intends to sue the city and recover $100,000 already spent on the project. MARY

FAIR FARM: IT OFFERS A LOT TO LEARN

<TEXT>
<P>
Crops of peanuts, kiwis and rhubarb -- rarely seen in Orange County -- mingle 
with the traditional crops of corn and lima beans on a small farm in the middle 
of urban Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual crops were planted because the children who visit this one-acre 
farm on the Orange County Fairgrounds are fascinated by them, supervisor Kevin 
Arnett said. And this farm exists to fascinate children. 
</P>
<P>
Centennial Farm was an employee parking lot in the corner of the fairgrounds 
when fair officials decided to turn it into an educational tool. Tours of 
students and adults come through three times a day now to see something that is 
rapidly disappearing from urban Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"We grow everything," Arnett said. "Anything we can try to grow, we grow 
because of the interest to our kids." 
</P>
<P>
On the tours, guides usually ask the children where they think bread or 
Cheerios come from. The children usually can trace their food only as far as 
the store, Arnett said. 
</P>
<P>
About 25 to 30 crops are rotated as the seasons change, Arnett said. Eggplants 
the size of small onions are starting to hang over their wire supports and 
bright orange pumpkins look ready to take away. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the crops have historical significance, Arnett said. "Lima beans at one 
time were the number one crop in Orange County and strawberries are now the 
number two crop." 
</P>
<P>
The food goes to low-income employees at the fairgrounds, some of whom actually 
help grow it, and to two local shelters for the poor, Arnett said. 
</P>
<P>
Students who visit the farm are offered chicks for free, while other animals, 
such as pigs, rabbits, sheep and goats are sold to local youths for their use 
in 4-H and Future Farmers of America, Arnett said. 
</P>
<P>
Baby chicks are hatched almost daily in the incubators, and all the animals are 
tame enough for the children to pet and hold. 
</P>
<P>
The Fair Board has budgeted $100,000 each year for planting the crops, 
maintaining the animals, acquiring antique farm equipment and building 
permanent structures such as the livestock pens and the barn. 
</P>
<P>
The farm sees a wide variety of students, with those from preschool to second 
grade the most predominant visitors. Because of its design -- wide, level roads 
that make it easy on wheelchairs -- the farm is also popular among special 
education classes, said Michelle McKnight, a part-time employee who schedules 
and conducts tours. MARY ANNE PEREZ

TOLLWAY PLANS OPPOSED AT HEARING;

TRANSPORTATION: OPPONENTS SAY THE 17-MILE SAN JOAQUIN HILLS ROUTE WILL LEAD TO 
GROWTH, RUIN AN UNBLEMISHED AREA AND DISTURB THE HABITAT OF AN ARRAY OF

<P>
A flood of homeowners and environmentalists on Wednesday blasted plans for San 
Joaquin Hills Tollway in South County, declaring that the proposed highway will 
spur more growth and ruin one of the region's last unblemished stretches of 
terrain. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 people, most of them opposed to the 17-mile tollway, gathered at 
Laguna Hills High School during a hearing to collect public comments on the 
project's recently completed environmental review. 
</P>
<P>
"I say no to this road, period," said Robert Wells, a Laguna Beach resident 
whose family has lived in the area for four generations. "One swath of a 
bulldozer on this land is an abomination. . . . I think this thing should be 
stopped now." 
</P>
<P>
A dozen protesters armed with placards featuring slogans such as "I think toll 
roads stink," held a quiet demonstration before the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm one of those people willing to lay down in front of the bulldozers," said 
Brian Jacobs, a former president of the Orange County Coalition. "There's 
simply no need for it. It's immoral." 
</P>
<P>
Under current plans, the tollway would branch off the San Diego Freeway at the 
southern end of Mission Viejo and meander northwest through the sprawling 
subdivisions and lush landscape, terminating at the Corona del Mar Freeway in 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Though it promises to help ease the region's pressing traffic mess, the tollway 
would also cut through some of Orange County's most ecologically sensitive 
terrain. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in communities stretching from Laguna Beach to Laguna Hills Leisure 
World are concerned about the tollway's potential effect on everything from 
their health to their home values. Others complain that the tollway would spark 
another development boom in an area already choked with houses. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists are concerned that the tollway would destroy one of the last 
remaining vestiges of Orange County's bucolic past, pushing a ribbon of asphalt 
through land that ultimately is expected to become a wilderness park. The 
tollway, they contend, also would carve into hillsides and upset the habitat of 
an array of animals, including deer, skunks and bobcats. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal wildlife biologists, meanwhile, say the tollway will cut 
through important terrain that animals use to travel between Upper Newport Bay 
and the San Joaquin Hills and the national forest to the east. By cutting off 
their access, animals will begin to vanish from the hills and bay, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Biologists with the federal Fish and Wildlife Service are especially concerned 
that the tollway will lead to extinction of the clapper rail, a shy, colorful, 
rare bird that lives at the bay. 
</P>
<P>
Federal biologist Dick Zembal has contended that 70% of the clapper rails in 
the United States would be "wiped out" if Newport Bay was cut off from the 
forest. 
</P>
<P>
But officials with the Orange County agency devoted to building the tollway say 
they are working hard to address these concerns. Wetlands that are paved over 
by the road will be re-created elsewhere, they say. The tollway will also be 
built to accommodate the migratory paths of deer and other animals by creating 
passageways beneath the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the tollway will be carved through the canyons so a minimal amount 
of earth has to be removed from hillsides, creating a highway that will be 
picturesque, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Tollway agency officials have also maintained that the road would not induce 
growth, arguing that 98% of the corridor along the route is already set aside 
as open space or approved for development.

J.R. AND FRIENDS DROP IN AT SAN JUAN WATERING HOLES

The cowboys sitting at the bar of the El Adobe restaurant on Monday evening 
hardly created a stir. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until later that Elias Meza, restaurant manager, realized that they 
weren't cowboys at all -- but actors. And sitting inconspicuously among them 
was Larry Hagman, better known in some quarters as J.R. Ewing of the television 
show "Dallas" -- in town to film an upcoming episode of the prime-time series. 
</P>
<P>
"Darn it, I wish I had recognized him," he said, pointing to a guest book 
filled with celebrity autographs he has collected over the years. "Now when I 
get Anthony Quinn, I recognize him right away." 
</P>
<P>
But Hagman and co-star Patrick Duffy did not escape notice the next evening at 
another local bar, the Swallows Inn. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't even recognize them at first. They looked so different from TV," 
said an employee who asked not to be named. She added that while the actors 
pretty much kept to themselves, other patrons "kept buying them drinks." 
</P>
<P>
It did not take long for word to spread through town quickly that J.R. and his 
brother, Bobby, were filming an episode at the nearby Rancho Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
The show's publicist, David Stapf, said the three-day taping was for the 
television series' 350th episode -- making it television's second-longest 
running drama next to "Gunsmoke," which ran for 402 episodes. 
</P>
<P>
"What they were filming down there is a good old-fashioned cattle drive," Stapf 
said of the episode entitled, "Fathers and Sons and Fathers and Sons," which is 
scheduled to run in late February. 
</P>
<P>
The segment's story line will chronicle the Ewings' driving 400 head of cattle 
from one part of the South Fork range to another, Stapf said. 
</P>
<P>
The 40,000-acre Rancho Mission Viejo is owned by the O'Neill family heirs and 
is managed by the Santa Margarita Co. 
</P>
<P>
Company spokeswoman Diane Gaynor said the ranch is occasionally used for films 
and television. Gaynor said the first film made there was the 1928 Gary Cooper 
film, "Lilac Time."

PARKS ONE OF TWO BIG MEN FROM CALIFORNIA TO COMMIT TO DUKE

Cherokee Parks of Marina High School, one of the most sought-after basketball 
players in Orange County history, signed a letter of intent Wednesday with 
Duke. 
</P>
<P>
But Parks, a 6-foot-11 center, wasn't the only new big man to commit to the 
Blue Devil program. 
</P>
<P>
Duke also signed Erik Meek, a 6-10 center from San Pasqual High in Escondido. 
Meek averaged 28.5 points and 12.5 rebounds as a junior and has been a two-time 
Times' All-San Diego County selection. 
</P>
<P>
Other county players signing letters of intent were John Molle of Irvine (San 
Diego State), Ocean View's Marcel TenBerge (Colorado State) and Santa 
Margarita's Chris Hacker (Cal Poly Pomona). 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday was the first day high school players could sign letters of intent. 
</P>
<P>
Parks, who played with Meek in a summer league two years ago, said he is 
excited about the two becoming teammates. He wouldn't say who he thought would 
be the true center and who would move to power forward. 
</P>
<P>
"It depends on how both of us mature," Parks said. "We could go with a two-man 
inside game." 
</P>
<P>
Duke is 231-101 in the past 10 seasons and has made four Final Four appearances 
in the past five years. The Blue Devils lost to UNLV in last year's 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Parks chose Duke over Arizona, Arizona State, Kentucky and UCLA. He orally 
committed to Duke on Oct. 22, one day after visiting the Durham, N.C., campus. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the fall, Meek narrowed his choices to Kansas, Stanford, Vanderbilt 
and Duke. He took recruiting trips to each campus, with Duke as his final visit 
last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel we could both play there," Meek said. "I didn't see going to Duke as a 
situation where they have so many players that I wouldn't be able to play. 
</P>
<P>
"The number four and five spots (power forward and center) are kind of the same 
thing at Duke. I'd be able to be more versatile there." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Parks averaged 22.1 points, 13.4 rebounds and 3.5 blocked shots a 
game while shooting 59% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
A three-year starter, he has averaged more than 20 points and 10 rebounds a 
game since his sophomore year. He was the top vote-getter in the recent "Best 
of the West" high school all-star team, which is selected by coaches, scouts 
and media members. 
</P>
<P>
Parks, who has a 3.2 grade-point average, says he is undecided on his college 
major. 
</P>
<P>
Molle, a 6-foot-5 guard who averaged 20.9 points and 7.5 rebounds a game last 
season, had orally committed to San Diego State this fall. Molle, who has a 2.8 
grade-point average, plans to study business in college. 
</P>
<P>
TenBerge, a 6-8 center, averaged eight points and six rebounds for Ocean View 
as a junior, despite playing half the season with a broken finger. 
</P>
<P>
TenBerge also visited Fordham and Northern Arizona before signing with Colorado 
State. He has 3.7 grade-point average and will study business. 
</P>
<P>
Hacker, a 6-8 center, averaged only five points and four rebounds as a junior, 
but his coach, Roger Holmes, said the center's performance in the Snow Valley 
basketball camp at Westmont College last summer helped raise his stock. 
</P>
<P>
Hacker has a 3.1 grade-point average and plans to major in business. He did not 
make any other recruiting visits. 
</P>
<P>
Two other county players, Tes Whitlock of Loara and Mark Moneypenny of Mater 
Dei, said Wednesday that they're still undecided on their college choices. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock, one of the top guard prospects in the nation, has visited Arizona 
State and Long Beach State but has yet to take his entrance exams. 
</P>
<P>
Moneypenny, a 6-10 center, said he plans to sign in the spring. A reserve on 
last year's state championship team, Moneypenny is considering Syracuse, 
Fordham, Rider and the University of San Diego.

TITANS, ANTEATERS PICKED TO TRAIL BIG WEST

UC Irvine suffered through the worst basketball season in school history in 
1989-90, but the Anteaters were not picked to repeat their last-place finish in 
the Big West Conference in a poll of conference coaches Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
That distinction fell to Cal State Fullerton, which has lost its top two 
scorers, Cedric Ceballos and Mark Hill, from a team that finished seventh last 
season. UC Irvine was picked to finish ninth. 
</P>
<P>
"I was prepared for that," Fullerton Coach John Sneed said. "When you look at 
who's returning around the league and the fact that Wayne (Williams) is our 
only returning starter, I can understand that. I'll tell you this, though. I 
don't think we'll be the No. 10 team." 
</P>
<P>
Nevada Las Vegas, the defending NCAA champion and preseason No. 1 in many 
national polls, was picked unanimously to win the Big West. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV is awaiting the result of its appeal to reverse a ruling barring the 
Rebels from defending their NCAA tournament title. A decision by the Big West 
on whether to allow UNLV to play in the Big West tournament will be made only 
if the NCAA announces that the ban will stand, conference officials said. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State, which tied UNLV for the regular-season title last season and 
lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament, was chosen second. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine, which set a school record with a 15-game losing streak last season, won 
three of its final six games to finish 5-23. Four players from that team -- 
seniors Ricky Butler and Jeff Herdman and sophomores Dylan Rigdon and Jeff Von 
Lutzow -- are expected to start against UCLA in Irvine's season-opener Nov. 23 
in the Great Alaska Shootout.

TITAN VOLLEYBALL AVOIDS SANCTIONS FROM BIG WEST

The Big West Conference compliance committee has decided not to impose 
sanctions on the Cal State Fullerton volleyball program for minor NCAA rule 
violations, Titan Athletic Director Ed Carroll said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But Carroll said he sent a letter of reprimand to Coach Jim Huffman because of 
Huffman's involvement in the violations. 
</P>
<P>
According to an athletic department report submitted to the conference, Huffman 
allowed volleyball players to use his office telephone, a violation of NCAA 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
A study of telephone records from February, 1989, to August, 1990, indicated 
that 34 illegal calls, totaling $3.89 in charges, were made by three players. 
</P>
<P>
An athletic department inquiry uncovered two other possible rules violations, a 
student-athlete who spent a night at Huffman's house and the hiring of two 
players to coach a private volleyball team operated by Huffman assistant Marlon 
Sano. 
</P>
<P>
According to Fullerton's report, a team member who was having domestic problems 
with her roommates went to Huffman's home for counseling, and because it was 
late, Huffman allowed her to stay the night. 
</P>
<P>
Big West Conference Associate Commissioner Dennis Farrell said he was "not at 
liberty" to discuss compliance committee issues. But Carroll said the 
committee, which met during this week's conference meetings in Los Angeles, did 
not deem this a violation. 
</P>
<P>
However, the coach "was reprimanded for the use of poor judgement in housing 
the student-athlete," the athletic department report said. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll said the compliance committee did not address the possible problem 
involving players coaching on club teams because the issue will be discussed at 
the conference's next meeting in February.

What's in a Name?: It's ciao to Ciao, the name given to two Italian-style 
restaurants in Santa Ana and Dana Point. The restaurants will remain under the 
same management, but a new name must be found. 
</P>
<P>
The five Crivello brothers opened their restaurant in 1986, choosing the 
Italian word for farewell as its name. Appropriate as it might be, the name was 
hardly original. A Northern California restaurant chain of the same name took 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
So the brothers have decided to make "fine wine out of sour grapes," as Vince 
Crivello puts it, with a name contest. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the contest will receive an Italian feast for up to 10 people. 
Entries should be sent no later than Dec. 7 to So Long, Farewell, Ciao, 249 
Grenada Ave., Long Beach, Calif. 90803.

EARNINGS: THE HOLDING COMPANY SAYS IT WOULD HAVE MADE MORE THAN $1 MILLION HAD

US Facilities Corp., citing expenses of $860,000 from a previously undisclosed 
takeover attempt, said Wednesday that its net income fell 14% to $265,000 for 
the third quarter ended Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa holding company for underwriting management and reinsurance 
firms said it would have earned more than $1 million had it not been for 
expenses resulting from an attempted acquisition of an insurance firm, which 
company officials declined to identify. 
</P>
<P>
US Facilities posted revenue of $17.1 million for the third quarter, a 4% 
increase over revenue of $16.4 million in last year's third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months, the company posted net income of $1.9 million, up 
46% from $1.3 million for the corresponding year-earlier period. Revenue rose 
13% to $51.4 million from $45.4 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
The company had not announced previously that it was close to acquiring a 
particular firm, though it had said in its last annual report that it hoped to 
grow this year through acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Burke, chief financial officer, said US Facilities did not believe it had 
to divulge negotiations with a California-based insurance underwriting company 
because no definitive agreement had been reached. 
</P>
<P>
The expenses -- mainly for investment bankers, lawyers, accountants, actuaries 
and travel -- had been accumulated over the past year and were to be part of 
the acquisition cost. When the deal fell through, he said, US Facilities had to 
acknowledge the expenses and write them off. 
</P>
<P>
Whether shareholders should have been told earlier that acquisition expenses 
were being incurred but not accounted for in company financial statements is a 
"tough call," said Jeffrey Kilpatrick, president of Newport Securities Corp. in 
Costa Mesa. The better approach, he said, would have been to disclose as much 
as possible and write off expenses as they occurred. 
</P>
<P>
US Facilities will continue to look for other companies to acquire, Burke said, 
but there is "nothing specific in the mill right now." 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock, which has traded as high as $5.75 a share in the last 12 
months, closed Wednesday at $2.75, down 12.5 cents from Tuesday's close.

COUNTY FIRM TO MAKE MOVIES IN SOVIET UNION

A small Laguna Hills investment firm said Wednesday that it has formed a joint 
venture with a Soviet film studio to produce low-budget movies in the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
Rolan A. Bykov, president of Moscow-based All Union Movie and TV Centre, said 
the agreement calls for the production of 20 movies over a five-year period, 
with each picture budgeted at a cost of between $8 million and $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
All Union Movie, which has 11 studios under its wing, is an independent agency 
created in 1989 by the Soviet government to oversee the Soviet Film industry. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet agency and Stevenson, Abercrombie &amp; Claythorne, a Laguna Hills 
investment bank, also said they have formed a joint venture bank, International 
Investment Cultural Bank, to provide financing for the films. 
</P>
<P>
"Compared to the United States, making movies in the Soviet Union is 
inexpensive," said Michael Colla, president of Rico-Lion Films of Hollywood, 
who will oversee the production of the films. "Our intention is to combine the 
ability of the Russians and the talents of the Americans to reach the 
international market." 
</P>
<P>
Bykov, who is also chairman of the Soviet government's cultural commission, 
said the venture, called Soyuz Hart, will produce films based on Soviet and 
U.S. legends and folk tales. The Soviets hope the venture will give the Soviet 
film industry a higher profile in the West, he said, and also help the country 
obtain more foreign currency. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Elliott, chairman of Stevenson, Abercrombie, said Soyuz Hart plans several 
projects, including plans by Hart Industries Inc. of Laguna Hills to clean up 
toxic waste sites in the greater Moscow area. Elliott is chairman of Hart 
Industries, a publicly held firm that cleans underground gasoline storage 
tanks. Stevenson, Abercrombie owns 26% of Hart. 
</P>
<P>
Among the venture's other proposed projects is a chain of fast-food hot dog 
restaurants in the Moscow area and construction of a business center near the 
Moscow River.

NEW TREATMENTS FOR ARTHRITIS HOLD PROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Although no cure is in sight for the painful, debilitating disease rheumatoid 
arthritis, new treatments promise to do a better job of relieving symptoms of 
sufferers. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 2.1 million Americans -- including more than twice as many women 
as men -- are affected by this mysterious disease of unknown origin. Despite 
decades of research, scientists do not know why the disorder makes the body 
turn on itself, attacking bone and cartilage. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the cause of rheumatoid arthritis, though, the result is an 
inflammation of the joints that can cause stiffness, fluid accumulation, 
fatigue and weight loss in addition to pain. In the absence of a means to 
prevent the disease or cure it, the emphasis has been on treatments to 
alleviate symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
Now, several new approaches to dealing with the disorder hold out hope of 
further relief for those afflicted, researchers said during a recent meeting of 
the American College of Rheumatology. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more promising developments is a new class of drugs called 
5-lipoxygenase inhibitors, which act on cells that cause inflammation, said Dr. 
Michael Weinblatt of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent study, a brand of the drug made by Abbott Laboratories of Abbott 
Park, Ill. -- called Zileuton -- was effective in blocking the action of cells 
called leukotrienes, which are known to cause pain and inflammation in joints 
and other tissue, Weinblatt said. 
</P>
<P>
The drug effectively diminished symptoms in 12 arthritis patients who received 
it. "It's very preliminary," Weinblatt said, "but it's exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Another so-called "pathway" of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis is through 
the effects on tissue of an enzyme called cyclooxygenose, he said. Doctors 
typically have tried to suppress the enzyme with aspirin, ibuprofen, steroids 
and gold salts, but Weinblatt said they are not entirely effective. 
</P>
<P>
In the study, he said Zileuton appeared to work against the enzyme, with 
patients showing "a trend toward improvement" of symptoms. But he added that 
"further studies regarding the effectiveness are needed and in progress." 
</P>
<P>
Weinblatt noted that 12 patients in the study who received a dummy substitute 
for comparison also displayed improvements, although to a lesser extent. The 
finding supports other research pointing to a psychological element in the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
Several studies found that a sufferer's level of education appeared to have a 
correlation to the severity of his or her pain. Patients with higher levels of 
education appeared to have better coping abilities, more optimism, less sense 
of helplessness and more support from peers than those with less education, 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
"These findings suggest that formal education and psychological influences are 
a determining factor in the status of (the disease)," said Dr. Theodore Pincus 
of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the University of Texas Southwestern, meanwhile, reported 
another promising treatment that uses an arthritis sufferer's own antibodies to 
suppress painful inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
In laboratory tests performed so far only on rabbits, scientists used a 
technique to curb arthritis symptoms that already has proved useful in treating 
lung inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Hugo Jasin said the antibodies interfere with the ability of problem cells 
to attach themselves to walls of tissue in a manner that triggers the swelling 
and inflammation process. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said more animal researcher need to be done and it could be two 
years or more before the treatment is tried on humans.

HELMETS FOR YOUNG BIKE RIDERS URGED

Overzealous bicyclists can strain their muscles or grow saddle sore, but the 
injuries that most need to be prevented are head injuries, those "that doctors 
can't fix," says a local pediatrician. 
</P>
<P>
"The serious injuries and the ones from which children do not recover are the 
head injuries," says Dr. Modena Wilson, a pediatrician at Johns Hopkins 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The best way to prevent these injuries -- skull fractures and often resulting 
brain damage -- is to wear a helmet "from the first bicycle on," Wilson says. 
</P>
<P>
Should a child hit his head, the helmet protects the skull and the brain by 
cushioning the impact and spreading the shock around so that it is not all in 
one spot. 
</P>
<P>
Parents should buy only helmets that have been approved by the Snell Foundation 
or the American National Standards Institute, Wilson says. If children are 
reluctant to wear helmets, she suggests that "parents sort of gang up on their 
kids" by making their area a "helmet neighborhood," where wearing the 
protective gear is not only accepted but also required. 
</P>
<P>
"Another high priority is keeping kids off roads . . . until they are old 
enough to handle that," says Wilson, adding that children also need to be 
instructed to follow the same rules of the road that motorists do. 
</P>
<P>
"And children should not ride at night," she insists.

PHARMACY OFFERS MORE THAN A BOTTLE OF PILLS

Time was when the lunch counter at the corner drugstore sold cheeseburgers and 
milkshakes, not making for the kind of healthy atmosphere businessman Daniel 
Herbert thinks today's consumers want. 
</P>
<P>
For a fee, customers at Herbert's Westhampton Pharmacy can plan diets to gain 
or lose weight, check their cholesterol and blood pressure, obtain a complete 
medication analysis and calculate their life expectancy. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel like pharmacists have a lot of services to offer other than filling 
prescriptions," said Herbert, who opened a health center at his pharmacy in 
January. "We think it's the way pharmacy is going to be practiced. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to set the standard. We want to help people get good, healthy habits 
so they take less medication." 
</P>
<P>
Herbert's chain, Richmond Apothecaries, has six pharmacies in Richmond and 
opened a health center at a second store in late July. 
</P>
<P>
"Pharmacy counseling seems to be the wave of the future," said Midge Pearce, an 
assistant editor at Pharmacy Times, published in Port Washington, N.Y. "This is 
the first time I've ever seen anybody put a price on it." 
</P>
<P>
A nutritionist staffs Herbert's center two days a week, and for $35 an hour 
tests cholesterol and blood glucose. She also recommends diets. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert's daughter Catherine is the pharmacist at Westhampton. For $35 an hour, 
she analyzes the medicine people take and advises them how to schedule drugs 
and meals to minimize side effects. 
</P>
<P>
The store also offers a computer that reads customers' blood pressure, pulse 
and weight. It advises people of their ideal weight and their risk of a heart 
attack, and it gives a personalized stress analysis. The computer also figures 
a customer's "health age" and life expectancy based on answers to questions 
such as "Do you smoke?" and "Do you exercise?" 
</P>
<P>
Each query costs a quarter. Or for $12, customers can join for a year. 
</P>
<P>
Many chain drugstores are focusing on what the pharmacist can offer, said Tom 
Menighan, a pharmacist and senior director of external affairs for the American 
Pharmaceutical Assn. in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"Dan is just taking it the next step and building the community-health-center 
kind of approach. We feel the future of pharmacy is in the kind of information 
we provide rather than just giving the right drug to the right patient," 
Menighan said. 
</P>
<P>
People should get more from their pharmacy than "a paper bag and a thank you 
from a high school clerk," he said. "If they can't relate to that pharmacist, 
they should find another one." 
</P>
<P>
Health services can attract and retain patients because they will keep coming 
back instead of giving up on their prescriptions, Menighan said. 
</P>
<P>
Equipping the center cost $40,000, including $10,000 for the health computer. 
Opening the second center cost $15,000 to $18,000. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert said he hoped the center would be making money at the end of the year. 
But he said it's been hard to persuade people they need some of the services. 
</P>
<P>
"For tests, people are here all the time," Herbert said. "The rest is slow 
growth. We're selling things people have never bought before."

HOW DID THANKSGIVING GET TO BE TURKEY DAY?; 
</P>
<P>
HISTORY: THE ALL-AMERICAN FEAST TOOK ITS TIME BECOMING THE HOLIDAY WE ALL 
CELEBRATE TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Thanksgiving didn't come into the world fully formed. We don't even know when 
the first Thanksgiving Day took place, only that it was sometime between Sept. 
21 and Nov. 9, 1621. 
</P>
<P>
The Pilgrims certainly had no idea of founding an annual holiday, either. The 
first Thanksgiving was strictly a one-shot event. Similar ad hoc days of 
thanksgiving were proclaimed from time to time in Massachusetts over the next 
50 years -- usually by the churches, rather than by the civil authorities -- 
but it was Connecticut that made Thanksgiving an annual event, starting around 
1647. 
</P>
<P>
The custom of having an annual Thanksgiving Day spread throughout New England 
in the 17th Century, but as yet it did not include any idea of commemorating 
the First Thanksgiving. If anything was commemorated, it was a later 
Thanksgiving when the crops had failed and the Massachusetts Bay Colony came 
very close to starvation. 
</P>
<P>
In 1631, everybody was down to a daily ration of just five grains of corn when 
a day of fasting and prayer was proclaimed for Feb. 22. Miraculously, on that 
day a ship returned from England with food supplies, the colony was saved and 
the fast day turned into a feast. There is a very old New England custom, now 
mostly forgotten, of serving every diner five grains of corn before the meal in 
memory of the hardship and the deliverance of that year. 
</P>
<P>
The holiday actually met a certain amount of resistance as it spread. Since the 
"pagan" holiday of Christmas was not celebrated in Massachusetts until the 19th 
Century, Thanksgiving was often thought of as essentially a Puritan substitute 
for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Thanksgiving made no headway in the South, for instance, and probably it was 
only because the Dutch colonists had celebrated what they called Thankday that 
it was accepted in New York. When the British governor of Rhode Island 
proclaimed Thanksgiving in 1687 -- doubtless thinking he was doing his subjects 
a big favor -- Puritan-hating religious dissidents celebrated the holiday so 
contemptuously he threw some of them in jail. Rhode Island didn't start 
celebrating Thanksgiving until 1776. 
</P>
<P>
In 1776, of course, Thanksgiving was not a Puritan but a Patriot holiday. That 
year and every year throughout the Revolutionary War, the Continental Congress 
declared a national Thanksgiving to boost morale. George Washington also 
declared Thanksgivings as President in 1789 and 1795, as did the following 
Presidents occasionally until about 1815. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the holiday did not catch on. That took two things: the migration of New 
Englanders throughout the Northern states, enthusiastically taking their 
holiday with them, and one very determined lady, Sarah Josepha Hale. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Hale was born in Maine in 1788 and had powerful childhood memories of 
Thanksgiving. In 1826 she published a novel containing a plea for a national 
Thanksgiving holiday. In 1846, as editor of the influential Godey's Lady's 
Book, a combination fashion and literary magazine, she began her campaign in 
earnest. From then on, she wrote at least two editorials a year on the subject 
and deluged public figures with correspondence about the need for Thanksgiving. 
She even included a chapter on the campaign for a national Thanksgiving in her 
book on etiquette. 
</P>
<P>
The South dragged its heels for a while -- when the governor of Virginia 
considered the idea in 1855, it was denounced as a relic of Puritan bigotry 
(probably a code word for Northern abolitionism), but the next year his 
successor just proclaimed the holiday without soliciting advice, and it was a 
success. 
</P>
<P>
In 1859, Thanksgiving was celebrated in every state of the Union except 
Delaware, Missouri and recently admitted Oregon, and Sarah Hale expressed the 
hope that the holiday could unify the country against the gathering clouds of 
the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
That didn't happen, of course, but during that war she persuaded Abraham 
Lincoln to declare a national Thanksgiving Day, intended to be celebrated 
annually. He established the date we follow now, the fourth Thursday in 
November. After the Civil War, Thanksgiving was encouraged as a way of healing 
the wounds of the struggle. 
</P>
<P>
The menu at the first Thanksgiving in 1621 was simply whatever the Pilgrims, 
with the help of the friendly Wampanoag Indians, could put together: venison, 
wildfowl (mostly turkeys and ducks), fish and cornmeal. Even today, the 
Thanksgiving table is supposed to groan with abundance, but in the 19th Century 
it really groaned. Sarah Hale -- whose vision obviously influenced how we 
celebrate Thanksgiving -- described one table loaded with chicken pies, goose, 
ducklings and three kinds of red meat as well as turkey, and another crowded 
with plum puddings, custards and pies of all sorts. 
</P>
<P>
She was emphatic, however, that turkey held pride of place among the meats and 
pumpkin among the pies, and these are still the essential Thanksgiving dishes 
for most people. How did they get this status? 
</P>
<P>
It's a little hard to say. As the largest bird available, turkey is certainly a 
prime candidate for a feast. In the course of the 19th Century, it became the 
absolute essence of what we call "Turkey Day," partly because it was a time of 
culinary nationalism when Americans boasted that they had the best ingredients 
in the world and therefore the best food; the native bird was obviously the 
right one for the native feast. In his 1878 book "A Tramp Abroad," Mark Twain 
describes getting homesick for American food in Europe and lists about 75 
American specialties. Prominent among them are "Roast turkey, Thanksgiving 
style. Cranberries, celery." 
</P>
<P>
Cranberry sauce was already strongly associated with turkey. As early as 1663 a 
visitor to New England had written, "The Indians and English use them 
(cranberries) much, boyling them with Sugar for Sauce with their meat, and it 
is a delicate Sauce." Nineteenth-century cookbooks throughout the country 
recommend serving turkey with cranberry sauce (sometimes cranberry jelly or, as 
in the original Fanny Farmer cookbook, cranberry punch), even in non- holiday 
contexts. It must have been the universal American taste, helped by the fact 
that cranberries keep well and could be shipped easily. 
</P>
<P>
The necessity of pumpkin pie is a little harder to explain. In the 1650s, a 
visitor to New England noted that the colonists were eating apple, pear and 
quince pies like Englishmen, and had largely given up pumpkin pie. Maybe the 
homely pumpkin pie made a comeback in the late 18th Century when New England 
developed a taste for "plain fare," rather than fashionable European dishes. 
They kept their English plum puddings and apple and mince pies, but elevated 
the homespun pumpkin over them. 
</P>
<P>
The New England menu was profoundly influential, but of course it had to be 
adapted to local circumstances. It was hard to start a meal with oysters in the 
Midwest. Certain new food habits might invade the menu, too. Olives and gelatin 
salads were gourmet novelties in late 19th-Century America. On the whole, 
though, our Thanksgiving dinners are simpler than our ancestors'. The effect 
has been to reinforce the special status of turkey with cranberry sauce and 
pumpkin pie. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time every group in the country has tended to add its own 
traditional feast day specialties to the menu, perhaps gumbo crowding out New 
England's creamed onions and chocolate cake the non-pumpkin parts of the 
dessert. The process continues today; in many households, turkey is accompanied 
by pasta or enchiladas. 
</P>
<P>
It has often been pointed out that the First Thanksgiving was not the first 
thanksgiving in this country. There had been thanksgiving feasts in Virginia 
and the short-lived Popham Colony in Maine, years before the Pilgrims came. 
</P>
<P>
We celebrate what is basically a New England Thanksgiving because New England 
made the festival its own. Its people had not come here as Englishmen and 
agents of the king, but to found a new society. In 1896 Edward Everett Hale, 
author of "The Man Without a Country," wrote of the first Thanksgiving: "The 
Festival itself was a reminder that they had turned over a new leaf. It was a 
thick leaf, too, and nothing could be read which had been written on the other 
side."

HOW TO READ THE SCORES

<TEXT>
<P>
These are results of the California Assessment Program test for third, sixth 
and eight grades. 
</P>
<P>
State officials say the scores are intended to provide a way to assess 
schoolwide academic performance. Students do not receive individual scores. 
</P>
<P>
Scores are scaled between approximately 100 and 400, although a few scores my 
be higher or lower. A school's scores may be compared to district and state 
averages. For example, if the third grade at your school scored 295 in math, 
and the state average is 283, children at your school are performing at a 
higher level than most third-graders statewide. 
</P>
<P>
In general, a fluctuation of 10 points or less should not cause alarm, although 
state education officials say that the margin of error varies depending upon 
the size of the school. 
</P>
<P>
Students in grades three and six last spring were given multiple-choice tests 
in reading, written language (including grammar and spelling) and mathematics. 
Last spring's eight-graders were tested in reading, math, history-social 
sciences and science. Eight-graders also took an essay test to assess their 
writing skills. Results of the essay test are expected next month. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases a specialized or "magnet"school has its campus on the grounds of 
a regular school. State officials have combined the scores, so separate results 
are not available. 
</P>
<P>
Additional scores for other school districts in San Diego County will appear 
over the next several days.

THANKSGIVING; 
</P>
<P>
ON CARVING THE BIRD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCHUYLER INGLE, Ingle is co-author of Northwest Bounty, published by Simon 
&amp; Schuster. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We had snow by Thanksgiving in Colville, Wash., in 1946. A home-movie 
cameraman, probably my father, panned across a snow-covered front yard, then 
recorded the arrival of the Thanksgiving guests at the Ingle home at First and 
Cedar. 
</P>
<P>
Young Bill Lane, just back from Germany, wears his Army Air Corps uniform. 
Silver bars shine on his shoulders. He brandishes a Nazi dagger as he slips 
toward the camera on the icy sidewalk and laughs and talks animatedly and hugs 
himself as though freezing from the cold. No sound accompanies the home movie. 
</P>
<P>
Main Street merchant Neal Ledgerwood, my mother's father, opens the back door 
of a well-polished sedan where a roast turkey rides like an honored passenger. 
Neal gingerly approaches the camera, his wife, Lilian, on his arm. He holds out 
the turkey in a roasting pan for inspection and gives the camera a few quick 
words. 
</P>
<P>
The turkey steams in the cold air. The color of the film has deteriorated in 40 
years, turning the bird a sanguine brown. The Thanksgiving guests look slightly 
jaundiced. 
</P>
<P>
Ingles, Lanes and the Ledgerwoods surround a dining table covered with linen 
and loaded down with bowls of vegetables and mashed potatoes, sauce boats 
filled with thick gravy, condiment trays bulging with canned olives and sticks 
of celery and ice-water pickles. A cut-glass bowl shows off the fresh cranberry 
sauce to best advantage. A basket piled with hard-crusted dinner rolls baked at 
the Davenport Hotel delicatessen moves from hand to hand around the table. 
Guests unfold damask napkins the size of road maps and pat them onto their 
laps. 
</P>
<P>
The camera pulls back from all the merry faces around the table to capture my 
grandfather emerging from the kitchen carrying the turkey on a carving board to 
the head of the table. He is smiling and chattering, a long thin version of my 
father, the same wavy hair. 
</P>
<P>
He sets the turkey down, the drumsticks pointing off to his right, and sticks 
the two-pronged fork into the bird to anchor it. He waves his long carving 
knife at the camera with a flourish and a showman's smile. Then, radiating the 
confidence of a man well practiced at what he is about to do, my grandfather 
separates a leg and thigh from the body of the turkey, his single easy stroke 
catching everyone's attention. 
</P>
<P>
My grandfather used his father's carving set for the task. This same carving 
set is now my own. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling-silver bolsters separate the knife from staghorn handles worn smooth 
with use. The blade has a shape like the Old West: 9 1/2 inches of flat-ground 
British carbon steel, forged and polished with buffalo hump roasts in mind. The 
back of the blade rolls forward from the bolster and crests in a steel wave 
that drops down with a sweep to the tip. The cutting edge bellies inward from 
years of sharpening. A short, businesslike honing steel accompanies the carving 
knife, as does a two-pronged fork. 
</P>
<P>
I don't use this carving set to slice roast chicken, a common meal in my house, 
so it remains in its box under the counter, behind the pot lids. I have another 
knife and fork, mere kitchen tools, for the likes of chicken or grilled flank 
steak or the occasional leg of lamb. 
</P>
<P>
I wait for the turkeys and venison roasts before I get down on hands and knees 
to dig out my great-grandfather's carving set. That is to say, I wait for the 
occasions at the table that demand a certain ceremonial display. 
</P>
<P>
Before guests arrive, I clean the carbon steel and silver bolsters of the 
carving set with silver polish. Then I sharpen the blade, pulling it again and 
again across a diamond stone until I am satisfied. I finish this minor chore 
with the steel, slowly stroking the blade across the steel on this side, then 
that, gradually gaining speed and confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Almost by definition, an occasion that demands my great-grandfather's carving 
tools had best be introduced by a few lightning-fast strokes of carving blade 
across honing steel, the butcher shop attention-getter. Practice reduces the 
likelihood of slipping in public and slicing open a finger. 
</P>
<P>
There must have been a time when fathers passed on the art of carving to their 
sons, but I grew up in a house with an electric carving knife, so I learned on 
my own. My father tells me that he didn't learn to carve a turkey until he was 
confronted by the first one he could call his own, cooked by his young wife. It 
rested before him at the head of the table, and with wife and guests looking on 
with admiration, there was nothing to do but have at it. 
</P>
<P>
My father was a dental student in Chicago at the time, and if his carving today 
is any reflection on his carving then, I suspect he had just finished his human 
anatomy course. My father carves a turkey in much the same way he would dissect 
a cadaver. 
</P>
<P>
While contemporary carving isn't necessarily a masculine chore, in my 
grandfather's day the task underscored his position at the head of the table 
and as head of the household, the winner of bread. The dual-career households 
of today don't support such obvious lines of demarcation, and carving occurs in 
the kitchen as often as it does at the table. 
</P>
<P>
A substantial part of my grandfather's responsibility as the carver, however, 
was to glorify the careful and, at times, tedious labor of his wife, the cook. 
My grandmother would have found her mortification inexpressible had she ever 
delivered to the table a turkey less than perfectly roasted. She learned her 
cooking skills as a child at a wood-burning stove and oven, then made the 
transition as an adult to coal and electricity. By the time she could adjust 
oven heat with a dial and count on the accuracy of the thermostat, she was set 
in her ways. 
</P>
<P>
Her pride, her cook's self-esteem, preceded a world polluted by packaged 
stuffing and Butterball turkeys. She must have felt a personal challenge to 
produce a roasted turkey that was in every way a match for a husband who carved 
so well, while the dinner guests watched attentively. And my grandfather, I am 
sure, did his best to honor the cook, his wife, with carving of consummate 
grace. 
</P>
<P>
He would separate the leg and thigh from one side of the turkey, an effortless 
act if the bird is properly cooked and if the carver strikes the joint in just 
the right place, a wrestling match otherwise. He would then part the thigh from 
the leg and set them aside before doing the same on the other side of the 
turkey. Then he would slice the breast meat, laying out each perfect piece on a 
warmed platter. Overcooked breast meat or breast meat on a turkey not allowed 
to rest 20 minutes after roasting tears in ragged chunks for all to see. 
</P>
<P>
When he had finished carving the white meat, my grandfather would cut the dark 
meat from the thighs, adding it to the platter. Turkey drumsticks were small 
enough in those days to leave whole and pass with the platter. Then he would 
scoop the dressing from the cavity of the bird and mound it in an ornate bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Once everyone had been served, all that remained would have been the saying of 
grace. On Thanksgiving in 1946, the grace probably had a lot to do with the war 
coming to an end, like the Great Depression had before it. The gathered 
families no doubt felt stronger for the struggle. 
</P>
<P>
The camera moves from face to face as the meal begins. There is no sound, but 
the laughter and the warmth come through, right across the years. My 
grandfather takes his seat, then looks at the camera for a moment -- at me. The 
long fingers of his right hand rest on the carving knife that had come to him 
from a time before.

ALL ABOUT ONIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE LAND

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the best things about Thanksgiving is creamed onions -- not just the 
pungent, richly sauced vegetables themselves, but the reminder that onions are 
a vegetable, worthy of being enjoyed in their own right. 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing obscure about onions; no seasoning is more ubiquitous. But when 
it comes to enjoying them for themselves alone, after onion rings all is 
silence. It shouldn't be that way; onions are not only delicious, they're easy 
to prepare (especially if you use big ones instead of those little white ones), 
low in calories (about 40 for a medium onion) and, like garlic, they may turn 
out to have cholesterol-lowering properties (stay tuned). 
</P>
<P>
Knowing Your Onions 
</P>
<P>
The big difference is between sweet, Spanish-type onions and the more pungent 
varieties such as the standard yellow globe, which accounts for about 75% of 
the onions in U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
Sweet onions -- including red torpedo and hamburger onions, Vidalias, Walla 
Wallas as well as standard Spanish -- are milder, softer and juicier than what 
might be called "regular" onions. They also spoil more quickly; standard onions 
are called "storage type" in seed catalogues and in the trade. 
</P>
<P>
Either kind can be used in most recipes, but results won't be the same. The 
sweetest onions can fade to blandness when cooked; the pungent ones can be 
disagreeable in salads. Sweet onions also shed more liquid and cook down softer 
than their stronger-flavored, firmer-textured cousins. 
</P>
<P>
Buy sweet onions only as needed, storage types any time. Store all onions in a 
cool, dark, fairly dry place -- not the refrigerator -- and keep them away from 
potatoes. Because of the gasses each gives off, potatoes and onions will both 
spoil more quickly if stored together. 
</P>
<P>
Onions can be used in salad, stir-fried or grilled, but those cooked for a long 
time are the gentlest: 
</P>
<P>
 There is in every cook's opinion, 
</P>
<P>
 No savory dish without an onion: 
</P>
<P>
 But lest your kissing should be spoiled 
</P>
<P>
 The onion must be thoroughly boiled. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Baked Onions 
</P>
<P>
These are as simple to make as baked potatoes and almost as versatile. Butter, 
salt and pepper are the classic accompaniments, but they're moist and 
rich-flavored enough to do fine without the butter. Like baked potatoes, they 
taste great dressed with sour cream and chives, curried yogurt, or, once cold, 
with vinaigrette. Italian and Mexican tomato sauces go well with them, and when 
you're bored with those, there's melted cheese, sauteed mushrooms, or a sweet 
and sour glaze made from a dab of butter, a slug of maple syrup and a squeeze 
of lemon. 
</P>
<P>
Baked onions take a long time to cook, from one to two hours depending on size 
and oven temperature, so plan to cook them while something else is in the oven. 
And do make extras while you're at it. Leftovers will keep for three or four 
days, and they reheat very well. 
</P>
<P>
Plan on one large or two medium onions per serving. The type doesn't matter -- 
sweet onions cook faster, but firmness is important; onions for baking should 
be as hard as possible. Trim off any dirt-bearing root and peel the loose outer 
skin but leave the tight inner skin. Rinse and dry, cut a thin slice from the 
neck so steam can escape, then put them in a shallow pan just large enough to 
hold them comfortably. Bake at anywhere from 325 to 425 degrees for one to two 
hours, until they give slightly when pressed. 
</P>
<P>
To serve onions in skins, cut a slit in one side and push meat up, just as you 
would a baked potato. The skins themselves aren't eaten, so for fancier 
service, remove them in the kitchen. There will be a small amount of 
caramelized onion juice in the pan. Pour in a few tablespoons of warm water, 
cider, wine, vinegar, or cream, stir over low heat until sauce forms and serve 
it with the onions. 
</P>
<P>
Variation: 
</P>
<P>
Easy, Comparatively Low-Calorie Creamed Onions 
</P>
<P>
For each serving: 
</P>
<P>
1 large or 2 medium onions 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
White pepper 
</P>
<P>
Ground nutmeg 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon whipping cream, preferably not ultra-pasteurized 
</P>
<P>
Make Baked Onions as above but peel each onion and cut in half horizontally. 
Loosen cooking juices with warm water and use sauce to paint bottom and sides 
of baking pan just large enough to hold onion halves when crowded together. 
Single servings do well in onion soup crocks; an 8-inch-square brownie pan will 
hold enough for six. 
</P>
<P>
Arrange onions in pan, cut sides up. Sprinkle with salt, white pepper and 
nutmeg and pour whipping cream over. Cover loosely with foil. Bake at 350 to 
375 degrees about 30 minutes or until heated through. Serve at once. 
</P>
<P>
 These are somewhere between a vegetable and a sauce, very rich tasting but not 
at all heavy, slightly sweet and sour. Wolfert suggests serving them on toast, 
with drinks, or with squab, calves liver or duck. I like them with grilled 
tuna, on baked squash, and with sweet potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
RED WINE-COOKED ONIONS (From "The Cooking of Southwest France," by Paula 
Wolfert) 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
2 1/2 to 3 pounds Spanish onions, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups full-bodied red wine (Petite Sirah or Cotes-du-Rhone) 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon red wine vinegar, about 
</P>
<P>
Heat butter in 4-quart saucepan (not aluminum) over low heat. Add onions. Cover 
and cook 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
Uncover and increase heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring frequently, until 
onions are glazed and golden brown, about 20 minutes or longer (avoid 
scorching). Sprinkle with sugar and boil down, stirring, 2 to 3 minutes to 
glaze. 
</P>
<P>
Reduce heat to low, add wine and cook, stirring frequently, until onions are 
very tender and deep mahogany in color, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Season to taste with salt and pepper, adding vinegar to counteract sweetness. 
Serve hot, lukewarm or cold. Makes about 2 cups or 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Onions will keep in refrigerator 2 to 3 days, or freeze for longer 
storage.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: THE ROAD TO SAN JUAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are plenty of reasons to drive out to Pacoima on a Saturday afternoon, 
even if you don't like picking through great old junk stores. You could visit 
Pacoima Junior High School, Richie Valens' alma mater and the place where he 
recorded "Richie Valens Live at Pacoima Junior High," which is still among the 
best live albums ever made -- look for the surreal mural where the singer 
floats among his hit records. You could cruise down San Fernando Road, the 
street where Los Angeles gives way to the scrub and railroad tracks and seedy 
'30s motel courts of the West, and pretend that you're starring in your own 
remake of "Touch of Evil." If you remember to make a reservation, you can visit 
the Merle Norman Tower of Beauty down the road, and spend a couple of hours 
contemplating the beauty of Merle's automobiles and old chandeliers. 
</P>
<P>
But the best thing about Pacoima is probably the Mexican food, which is just 
about as authentic as it gets. Upper Van Nuys Boulevard is lined with taquerias 
and Mexican seafood houses, Norteno joints and restaurants that specialize in 
barbecued goat, places splashed with neon and trumpet music and bright paint. 
If you drive down the street at dinner time, delicious cooking smells float 
over the street, as they do in Chinatown. And you can go anywhere -- I've never 
had a bad meal in Pacoima, even at the chain carnitas stand. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow though, four out of five times I make it up there, I end up at Cafe San 
Juan. 
</P>
<P>
Cafe San Juan is what everybody thinks a Mexican restaurant should be, a clean, 
mom-run family cafe in a working-class Mexican neighborhood, with ruffled 
curtains on the windows and battered stewpots on the walls, a portrait of 
Emilio Zapata glaring down from the back of the room and photographs of cows. 
At least a few customers wear straw cowboy hats at any given time; toward 
lunchtime most of them do. You can get spicy huevos rancheros at 5 in the 
morning and wash it down with strong coffee. (Cafe San Juan sells no alcohol -- 
the most intoxicating beverage on the menu is probably the thick milkshake made 
with platanos and chocolate.) Mexican telenovelas blare on the television, and 
sad Spanish-language ballads from the jukebox. Small children pop up their 
heads and stare at you over the banquettes. 
</P>
<P>
At the front of the cafe, behind a counter just inside the door, women fry 
chiles and heat tortillas, ladle stews and sauces from big, glazed crocks, grab 
handfuls of hard candy to give people who've just paid their checks. What the 
place serves is Northern-style Mexican food, the kind of rural, hearty 
ranch-style grub you might expect to be served in a Mexican home where somebody 
really knows her beans. It's not fancy in the least. Salsas are fiery hot, both 
the smoky, brick-red salsa that comes with tacos and the thick green one that 
comes with everything else. 
</P>
<P>
Chile verde is probably the most delicious thing on the small menu, chunks of 
pork stewed in a salty, tart sauce of green chile and tomatillo until they 
almost fall apart -- scented with garlic, the sort of food you can't stop 
eating until the plate is shiny clean, the best chile verde in town. It's much 
better than the somewhat bitter chile colorado. 
</P>
<P>
There's decent carne asada, tough but tasty from long marination, and good, 
garlicky pork chops. Tongue stew, cooked with tomatoes, onions and chiles, is 
tender as an hour of the Care Bears. Chiles rellenos are freshly fried, spicier 
than you'd expect under their crisp egg batter and bursting with Mexican 
cheese. The chicken ranchero, stewed in a tomato sauce studded with whole 
serrano chiles, is spicier still . . . probably the most rustic stuff you can 
eat within 15 minutes of Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 Cafe San Juan, 13324 Van Nuys Blvd., Pacoima, (818) 897-6144. Open daily, 5 
a.m.-9 p.m. Cash only. No alcohol. Lunch or dinner for two, food only, $9-$15.

WILD RICE AND GUINEA FOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a small and very special Thanksgiving dinner, consider the guinea fowl. 
This luxury game bird is now being bred in Canada from French stock and shipped 
weekly to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Pintade Farms of Toronto, which introduced the bird to the New World in 1985, 
is the largest producer in North America and the only one that brings in French 
birds for breeding. The French fowl has a larger breast and is more tender and 
moist, says James R. Hicks, a partner in the enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Pintade Farms has given the bird a new name -- pintelle. If you have traveled 
in Europe, you may have encountered it under such names as guinea fowl 
(England), pintade (France), pintada (Spain and Portugal), faraona (Italy) and 
Perlhuhn (Germany). 
</P>
<P>
The bird is so popular in France that an estimated 50 million are consumed 
there annually. In addition to delicate game flavor and a high yield of meat, 
it is low in fat -- a decided advantage in the holiday season of 
overindulgence. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks describes the flavor as "this side of pheasant, the other side of 
grain-fed chicken." The birds weigh in at 2 to 3 pounds and have light and dark 
meat just like a chicken or turkey. A pintelle grilled in The Times' test 
kitchen was so mild in flavor that it did not seem like a game bird. The 
density of the meat set it off from domestic fowl, however, and the legs of the 
young bird were free of the ligaments associated with chicken. To bring out the 
game flavor, chefs recommend removing the bird from its packaging and setting 
it uncovered in the refrigerator for 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks recommends marinating pintelle with oil, shallots and herbs, grilling the 
bird and serving it with wild rice. One marinade that he suggests consists of 
3/4 cup olive oil; 3 shallots, chopped; 3 cloves garlic, crushed; 2 teaspoons 
each thyme leaves, white pepper and white wine; 1 teaspoon rosemary leaves and 
1 teaspoon salt. 
</P>
<P>
That's a simple idea, but Canadian chefs who have been experimenting with 
pintelle are coming up with such complex creations as ballottine of pintelle 
with black currant and Pernod sauce (Suzanne Stormont and Anne Desbrisay, 
Toronto caterers), pintelle with savoy cabbage and Pommery mustard sauce (Mark 
McEwan, owner-chef of Pronto in Toronto) and pintelle steamed with lemon, fresh 
ginger and almonds (Jamie Kennedy of Palmerston in Toronto). 
</P>
<P>
Pintelle is being shipped to Los Angeles regularly and can be special-ordered 
through premium meat markets, according to a local distributor, Brian Reff, 
whose Reff Brothers Food Co. specializes in exotic poultry and game. The 
approximate retail price is $5.50 a pound, or roughly $12.50 a bird. And a 2 
3/4-pound bird provides enough meat for 3 to 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Wild rice not only goes well with pintelle but also with the holiday turkey. 
California now grows its own, although it's not wild and it has a slightly 
different flavor than that grown in the Midwest. Commercial wild rice 
production started in the state in 1977, but the first seeds were planted in 
1972 as an experiment by Vince Vanderford, a Yuba City farmer. Vanderford used 
seeds from Minnesota, long the leading source of wild rice. 
</P>
<P>
Today, most of the California crop grows in the Sacramento Valley, with acreage 
stretching into Modoc, Shasta, Lake, Butte, Colusa, Yuba and Sutter counties. 
The seed of an aquatic grass, it has a short growing season. The earliest 
California plantings take place in June, and the harvest continues from July 
through October. 
</P>
<P>
Once, all American wild rice came from lakes, tidal rivers and bays. Harvesters 
paddled through the waterways in canoes, flailing the seeds from the grass into 
their boats. Now, California farmers plant the seeds in man-made paddies and 
harvest mechanically. 
</P>
<P>
The California crop has flourished, which has brought the retail price down. 
What was once a costly item can now be had for $1.99-$5.95 a pound. (The price 
varies with the outlet and the size of the box or bag -- bigger is cheaper.) 
Some labels state prominently that the product was grown in California, but in 
other cases it is necessary to check the small print to learn where the rice 
was packed. A few California brand names are Deer Creek, which is Vince 
Vanderford's company; Spring Valley, McFadden Farm, L-M Ranch, Lundberg, Gibbs, 
Fall River, Sorrenti, Hinode and Great Valley.

THANKSGIVING; 
</P>
<P>
THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO STUFF A TURKEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN RAICHLEN, Raichlen is a Boston cooking school teacher and food 
writer.

<P>
Next Thursday, eight out of 10 Americans will sit down to a turkey dinner. To 
supply the demand, 45 million birds will meet their maker in the weeks leading 
up to Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
Our national bird might well have been the turkey. Benjamin Franklin thought it 
"a much more respectable bird, and withall a true original native of America." 
The bird was already domesticated when the Spanish reached Mexico in 1518. The 
Aztecs ate it with a sauce made from chiles and unsweetened chocolate. (The 
preparation survives in the Mexican dish mole poblano.) Europeans, usually 
finicky about New World foods, adopted the bird with gusto: A 16th-Century 
German cookbook listed 20 turkey recipes. 
</P>
<P>
One of the problems with turkey is that it's a party animal. You need at least 
10 people to eat a small one. If you have a smaller group, you might want to 
serve a game bird, such as partridge, pheasant and quail. They are loaded with 
flavor and perfect for celebrating Thanksgiving when you have only four to six 
guests. 
</P>
<P>
Game birds include, in descending order of size, wild turkey, goose, duck, 
pheasant, partridge, grouse, squab, dove, thrush (the alouette of the French 
children's song) and, the most delicious of them all, woodcock. Game is leaner 
than chicken or duck, which makes it a boon with dieters. Prone to drying out, 
it does best with a moist cooking method, like stewing or braising. Another way 
to keep game birds moist is by wrapping them in bacon or other fat. 
</P>
<P>
Game used to be available only to hunters, but more and more of it can be found 
at specialty markets and butcher shops. True wild game has the richer (and in 
many cases, muskier) game flavor. The pen-raised birds, on the other hand, are 
free of such inconveniences as feathers and wayward buckshot. Game farms have 
proliferated around the United States; many sell their wares by mail order. 
</P>
<P>
Looking for something different for this Thanksgiving? Here are some offbeat 
ways to prepare turkey and some game bird recipes for serving small crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 In pre-Columbian times, chocolate was consumed as a spice, not a sweet. Its 
bitterness goes well with the pungency of chiles. This recipe comes from "The 
Complete Book of Mexican Cookery" by Elizabeth Lambert Ortiz (Bantam Books: 
1968). 
</P>
<P>
MOLE POBLANO (Turkey With Chile-Chocolate Sauce) 
</P>
<P>
1 (8-pound) whole turkey 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup oil or lard 
</P>
<P>
6 ancho chiles 
</P>
<P>
4 pasilla chiles 
</P>
<P>
4 mulato chiles 
</P>
<P>
2 onions, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
4 cloves garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
3 sprigs fresh cilantro 
</P>
<P>
1 tortilla or toast slice, diced 
</P>
<P>
1 pound (3 medium) tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped 
</P>
<P>
1 cup blanched almonds, lightly toasted 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup raisins 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon anise seeds 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander seeds 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup sesame seeds, lightly toasted 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, coarsely chopped 
</P>
<P>
Cut turkey into individual serving pieces and place in pan along with salted 
water to cover. Simmer 1 hour and drain, reserving 2 cups turkey stock. Blot 
turkey pieces dry. 
</P>
<P>
Heat oil in large skillet. Brown turkey pieces, batch at time, on all sides. 
Transfer turkey to platter and reserve fat. 
</P>
<P>
Wash chiles. Tear in halves and remove stems, veins and seeds. Soak chiles in 
cold water to cover 1 hour and drain. Place chiles, onions, garlic, cilantro, 
tortilla, tomatoes, almonds, raisins, anise seeds, cloves, cinnamom, coriander 
seeds, black pepper and 2 tablespoons sesame seeds in blender and puree to 
smooth paste. 
</P>
<P>
Heat reserved fat in turkey pan. Add pureed chile mixture and cook over medium 
heat 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and stir in reserved turkey 
broth and chocolate. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Gently simmer 10 
minutes. Sauce should be very thick. 
</P>
<P>
Return turkey to sauce and cook over low heat 30 minutes, stirring 
occasionally. Correct seasoning. Sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons sesame seeds 
over mole poblano and serve at once. Makes 8 to 10 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Partridge is the game bird for people who like dark meat. This recipe comes 
from the Hermitage Inn in Wilmington, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
ROAST PARTRIDGE WITH DIJON MUSTARD SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
1 partridge, cut in half 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons butter, melted 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
1 shallot, minced 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup dry white wine 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 
</P>
<P>
2 strips crisply cooked bacon, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon chopped parsley 
</P>
<P>
Brush partridge with 2 tablespoons melted butter and season to taste with salt 
and pepper. Roast bird, skin side up, in oiled pan at 500 degrees 10 to 12 
minutes, or until cooked to taste. 
</P>
<P>
Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in heavy saucepan. Add shallot and sauce 
over medium heat until tender but not brown. Add white wine and boil until 
reduced by half. Add whipping cream and cook until reduced by half. Stir in 
Dijon mustard, bacon and parsley. Correct seasoning to taste. Pour sauce over 
partridge and serve at once. Makes 2 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I devised this stuffing, I thought of all the things a quail would eat 
in the fall, or at least the things I wished it would eat," says Greg Parks, 
chef of the Four Columns Inn in Newfane, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
ROAST QUAIL WITH WILD RICE STUFFING 
</P>
<P>
8 quail, preferably fresh 
</P>
<P>
1 lemon 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup olive oil 
</P>
<P>
Stuffing 
</P>
<P>
Wash quail inside and out and dry with paper towels. Sprinkle few drops lemon 
juice, salt and pepper into cavity of each bird. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Fill each quail with Stuffing. Season birds with salt and pepper. Arrange quail 
in lightly oiled roasting pan, breast side up. Tie drumsticks of each bird 
together and baste skin with olive oil. Roast at 450 degrees about 20 minutes, 
or until cooked to taste. To test for doneness, insert slender skewer into 
cavity of bird -- it should feel very hot to the touch. (Parks likes to serve 
quail slightly pink.) Untie legs and serve quail at once. Makes 8 appetizer 
servings or 4 entree servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: This stuffing would also be good in Cornish game hens or guinea fowl. 
</P>
<P>
Stuffing 
</P>
<P>
1 cup wild rice 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup butter 
</P>

</P>
<P>
1 large apple, peeled, cored and chopped 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage or 1 teaspoon dried 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
Rinse wild rice in strainer with cold water and drain. Place rice in large 
saucepan with 8 cups water. Bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer 40 to 50 
minutes, or until grains are just tender. Drain rice. 
</P>
<P>
Melt butter in skillet over medium high heat. Add and saute onion, shallots, 
garlic, red and green peppers and celery over medium heat 6 to 8 minutes, or 
until tender. 
</P>
<P>

think they would part with the recipe? 
</P>
<P>
 -- CHARLES 
</P>
<P>
DEAR CHARLES: This British-type curry (unlike any Indian curry you'll ever 
taste) is loaded with coconut, pineapple, banana and apple. You can add any 
meat, fish or poultry and serve it with colorful condiments that echo the 
ingredients in the sauce. It makes a terrific buffet party dish for a holiday 
season open house. 
</P>
<P>
RANGOON RACQUET CLUB ORIGINAL CURRY SAUCE

"Yeah, yeah, yeah, my yam-mmm-mousse . . . ." crooned "Housewives' " housewife 
Maggie Mayall, with a chorus of "yeah, yeah, yeah" from her rock 'n' roll 
partners, Hope Juber and Lisa Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
They can't help it. Put them in a kitchen and they perform. It's their cue. 
Their act. With tunes like "In Sink and at Your Disposal," "Been Defrosting All 
Day," "Ironing Bored" and "Reynolds Rap," would you expect Shakespeare? 
</P>
<P>
The yam mousse evolved in much the same way their lyrics and songs are created: 
improvisation. 
</P>
<P>
Said Mayall, the originator of the mousse recipe, "I started with mashed yams 
because I lo-o-ve yams. I don't like adding sugar to food, so I threw in a 
banana for sweetness. Then I got cocky and added cream -- real cream. Then I 
baked it, and it became fluffy and puffy. Of course it later fell . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Fluffy? Puffy? You can almost see lyrics forming in their heads. "Give us a 
sec. We'll get the words," Juber said. 
</P>
<P>
"Take your time," we said. "We'll settle for the recipe." 
</P>
<P>
Then it came: 
</P>
<P>
YEAH-YEAH-YEAH YAMM-MMM-MOUSSE 
</P>
<P>
(Lyrics by Maggie Mayall) 
</P>
<P>
For Thanksgiving or any day, 
</P>
<P>
 It has a name that's fun to say! 
</P>
<P>
 It goes with turkey, ham or goose, 
</P>
<P>
 And that is why we love YAM-MMM MOUSE. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 Chorus: 
</P>
<P>
 YEAH, YEAH, YEAH YAMM-MMM-MOUSSE!

ABOUT WINE: YOU MAY BE KEEPING YOUR WINE TOO COOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When you emerge from your 50-degree wine cellar with a bottle of prized red 
wine, it may not taste as good as a bottle of the same wine left out in the 
kitchen for a month before being opened. 
</P>
<P>
I drew this conclusion from chatting with Ron Batori of Heublein Fine Wine 
Group. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the first Beaulieu 
Vineyard Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon, he had recently staged two 
complete tastings of BV-PR vintages, with bottles from virtually every year 
since 1936. 
</P>
<P>
Included was a taste of the newly released 1986 BV Private Reserve, and the 
wine wowed a normally sedate group of wine collectors. The wine is marvelous, 
showing more mint and spice components and far more depth than many BV Private 
Reserve Cabernets of the past. 
</P>
<P>
Winemaker Joel Aiken did a masterful job of blending to capture the black 
currant elements occasionally detectable in this wine and to entwine them 
around a complex core of cedar, cherry and anise. It is striking wine, but less 
of it was made than usual (5,000 cases instead of 15,000). 
</P>
<P>
The tastings of older BV wines were staged at the Mark Hopkins Hotel in San 
Francisco and at the Regency Hotel in New York. I attended the West Coast event 
and found most of the wines excellent, although some were a bit faded. 
</P>
<P>
The New York event was staged a week later. A few days after that, I ran into 
Dennis Foley of the auction house Butterfield &amp; Butterfield, who had served 
as sommelier for both events. I asked Foley his opinion of the two events. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, curiously enough," he said, "the wines in New York all tasted better. No 
matter what the source of the wines, they all seemed to be in better shape." 
</P>
<P>
This was strange. I knew that most of the wines had come from the same cases, 
stored in the cellar of the winery. Six bottles of each case were shipped to 
San Francisco two months before the event; the other six were sent to New York. 
</P>
<P>
I called Batori and asked him whether he too had noticed that the wines were 
better in New York. He said they were, unquestionably. 
</P>
<P>
So I asked the obvious question: Was there any difference in the way the wines 
were treated before the event? The sommelier's handling of them had been 
identical (all wines were decanted), so there had to be another answer. 
</P>
<P>
Batori said that in San Francisco, the wines were stored in a cellar used to 
house the hotel's wines, where temperatures never rose above 55 degrees. This, 
we have all read, is the theoretically perfect cellar temperature. 
</P>
<P>
But in New York, Batori was given the option of storing the wine in either a 
wine cellar or a warmer room, perhaps as warm as 80 degrees, for the six weeks 
before the event. He opted for the warmer room, based on no scientific evidence 
whatever. 
</P>
<P>
"I recalled from my days in Europe that a lot of wines were pulled out of the 
cellar days, weeks, even months before they were to be tasted," said Batori. 
"You could call it a kind of an oral tradition in England. No one ever wrote 
down that the wines were better this way, but they would suggest that you 
should do it this way." 
</P>
<P>
Bringing wine out of a cold cellar to warm up for a few days or weeks before 
serving it may be a way of recognizing that wines are truly living products and 
go through periods when they sulk. Winemakers often talk about recently bottled 
wines that are "dumb" -- going through a stage where the fruit that was evident 
in the cask or tank seems to have disappeared. Disappeared, that is, until a 
bottle has been left to rest for a few weeks. Then the wine opens up again. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps removing a wine from cold storage weeks before consuming it wakes it 
from its slumber in some way. 
</P>
<P>
"All the wines from 1964 on had been put in warehouse conditions (at the BV 
winery)," said Batori. "They may have been stunned for upwards of 20 years and 
needed a period to recover." 
</P>
<P>
He said the wines that really showed better in New York than in California were 
from years where there wasn't much fruit to begin with, not the great vintages 
and not the bad vintages: "It really made a difference in the vintages that 
tended to be shy, like 1971, 1972, and 1975." 
</P>
<P>
Batori pointed out that a number of chateaux in France's Bordeaux district 
often pull wine out of the cellar and store it in a warmer place well before it 
is to be consumed. "I remember at Grand-Puy-Lacoste," he said, "Raymond Dupin, 
the proprietor, used to have around in his dining room cases and cases of wine 
that he designated as wines he would have over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
"These were wines that he felt were ready to be served, and having them in the 
dining room expanded the character, made them even more ready to drink." 
</P>
<P>
He added that while he was living in England for six years, the best wines he 
tasted were at the Whitehorse Inn at Chilgrove. "Barry Phillips always kept the 
wines to be served in the restaurant sort of around the room," he recalled, 
"and I always remember the wines tasting warmer and sweeter." 
</P>
<P>
"I could take the same wine, such as 1953 Lafite, and tasted at the Whitehorse, 
it was better than any other place I ever had it." 
</P>
<P>
Serving temperature is crucial too of course. Batori recommends that the 
serving temperature of red wine be about 60 degrees. "The French term a chambre 
means room temperature, but this was before central heating. Red wine should be 
cooled down. The British have taken that one step further, and they serve 
claret too warm by our standards." 
</P>
<P>
Long experience says that it is vitally important that wine be stored at 
constant (preferably cool) temperatures. Fluctuation in temperature is worse 
than a constantly warm environment. "But if you know you're going to serve a 
great wine a month from now," Batori said, "there is no reason to keep it in 
the cellar fully a month ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"Take it out and let it get its legs, let it warm up. It is better for the wine 
to be part of the environment in which it will be served. Those wines in the 
New York tasting were in a very warm room standing upright for six weeks. Over 
the long term, that would have destroyed the wines. But for the short term, it 
made them happier." 
</P>
<P>

Wine of The Week 
</P>
<P>
 1987 The Terraces Zinfandel ($12.50) -- One of the best Zinfandels I've tasted 
in the last year, this limited-supply wine comes from Wayne Hogue's terraced 
(of course) vineyards east of Rutherford in the Napa Valley hills. Aged in 
French and American oak barrels, it has a wonderful spice with hints of pepper 
and cherries, a supple mouth feel and a warm, inviting finish. Perfect for cold 
evenings and fine food. Hard to find in Southern California, but California 
residents may order the wine by mail. Cases are $173, half-cases $88.50 (both 
include tax and shipping). Mail checks to The Terraces, P.O. Box 511, 
Rutherford, Calif. 94573.

HOLIDAY: TURKEY SCHNITZEL, IT'S A QUICK ALTERNATIVE TO SPENDING HOURS ROASTING 
AND BASTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE LEVY, Levy is the author of the three-volume Fresh From France cookbook 
series (E.P. Dutton).

<TEXT>
<P>
A quick, easy and tasty turkey dinner might seem an unrealistic expectation, 
but that is exactly what many of us wish for when turkey season comes around. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, there is an alternative to spending hours roasting and basting the 
holiday bird. Fast, festive meals can be planned around turkey breast slices, 
which are now easy to find at the supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
The most delicious and foolproof way to enjoy turkey breast slices is to turn 
them into turkey schnitzel. In this adaptation of the famous Austrian veal dish 
called Wiener Schnitzel, a bread crumb coating keeps the lean turkey meat 
juicy. The sauteed turkey slices come out crisp on the outside and moist on the 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
The thin crust, which you make by dipping the turkey slices successively in 
flour, egg and bread crumbs, prevents the turkey from sticking to the pan, 
holds the slices in a neat shape and protects the meat so it won't become dry. 
</P>
<P>
Once the slices are coated, they should be handled with care. They should not 
be stacked before cooking, or moisture from the meat will make the coating 
gummy. Whenever sauteed turkey is kept warm, the pieces should be placed in the 
oven on a platter in a single layer and left uncovered so the coating will not 
soften. 
</P>
<P>
For best results, use a heavy skillet large enough so the turkey has plenty of 
room. Crowding the pieces in the pan causes them to steam and their coating to 
become soggy. The heat for sauteing the turkey should be medium-high. If it is 
too low, the coating absorbs too much fat and begins to stick. 
</P>
<P>
Vegetable and olive oils are ideal for sauteing. Butter imparts a lovely flavor 
to the turkey but can burn if used on its own. The solution is to melt the 
butter in the skillet with an equal amount of oil. To vary the turkey's 
coating, substitute whole-wheat flour for the white flour, or matzo meal or 
cornmeal for the bread crumbs. 
</P>
<P>
Turkey schnitzel is moist enough that sauce is not needed, but you can follow 
the French technique of sprinkling the sauteed turkey with a zesty garnish of 
capers and diced lemon, then drizzling it with nut-brown butter for a 
wonderfully rich taste. Or, try this variation I learned from a Tunisian 
friend: After removing the turkey from the pan, saute 2 or 3 chopped garlic 
cloves and a little parsley in the oil for about 30 seconds and spoon this 
quick seasoning over the meat. 
</P>
<P>
There aren't many dishes elegant enough to be featured often on wedding menus, 
yet so fast and effortless that mothers fix them as a quick lunch for their 
children when they come home from school. Turkey schnitzel, which I learned to 
prepare in Israel, serves in that country as such a dish. It is also perfect 
for celebrating Thanksgiving with a small group of friends and relatives, or 
for any occasion when you feel like serving turkey in minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Steamed rice is the usual accompaniment for these golden-brown turkey slices, 
but bow-tie pasta tossed with a light tomato sauce also makes a pleasing 
partner. A salad of diced red peppers, cucumbers and green onions completes the 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
SPICY TURKEY SCHNITZEL 
</P>
<P>
1 1/4 pounds turkey breast slices (8 slices), about 1/4-inch thick 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
Dash cayenne pepper 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup flour 
</P>
<P>
3/4 cup unseasoned dry bread crumbs or matzo meal 
</P>
<P>
2 eggs 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup oil 
</P>
<P>
Arrange turkey in one layer on plate. Mix cumin, turmeric, black and cayenne 
peppers and salt in small bowl. Evenly sprinkle half of spice mixture over one 
side of turkey and rub into meat. Turn pieces over and repeat with second side. 
</P>
<P>
Spread flour in plate and bread crumbs in second plate. Beat eggs in shallow 
bowl. Lightly coat turkey slice with flour on both sides and tap slice to 
remove excess flour. 
</P>
<P>
Dip slice in egg, then in bread crumbs so turkey is completely coated, pressing 
lightly so crumbs adhere. Repeat, setting coated slices side by side on large 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add enough turkey to 
make 1 layer and saute until golden brown on both sides, about 1 minute per 
side. Turn carefully, using 2 wide spatulas. If oil begins to brown, reduce 
heat to medium. Set slices side by side on oven-proof platter and keep warm, 
uncovered, in oven at 275 degrees while sauteing remaining turkey. Serve hot. 
Makes 4 servings.

THE REPORT FROM POTATOLAND;

ADVENTURE: THE INDIANA JONES OF THE POTATO WORLD EXPLORES THE ANDES IN SEARCH 
OF A SPUD.

Carlos Ochoa is the Indiana Jones of the potato world. Exploring the harsh 
Andean mountainsides since 1950, the Peruvian taxonomist has discovered and 
documented more than 70 species of wild potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
"The Andes are very tough. You have to be in good physical condition. You have 
to have good eyes. You acquire certain instincts. You smell. And when you find 
. . . it's a gift for the spirit," Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
His potato expeditions have taken him to a snow-capped peak that would later 
spew volcanic ash over the plants, and to the South American island that 
inspired Daniel Defoe to write "Robinson Crusoe." 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa recently embarked on a far more modest journey, an all-potato symposium 
at the Smithsonian Institution where he joined 70 international scientists, 
researchers and policy-makers who have devoted their lives to the tuber. 
</P>
<P>
The symposium was sponsored jointly by the Smithsonian Museum of Natural 
History and the International Potato Center (CIP) in Lima, Peru, a scientific 
institution where Ochoa's wild-potato plants are stored. 
</P>
<P>
Norio Yamamoto, an ethnobotanist at the National Museum of Ethnology in Osaka, 
Japan, spoke about the mythical potato in traditional society. Yamamoto spent 
several years in the Central Andes studying the agricultural practices of 
potato farmers, who snack on potatoes in the fields as they are harvested. 
(They bake them with the hot ashes from burning mountain grasses.) 
</P>
<P>
John Niederhauser, now a professor of plant pathology at the University of 
Arizona at Tucson, spent his career helping other countries make the potato 
more productive. He just won the World Food Prize for his contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Niederhauser, who lived in Mexico for 35 years, helped that country develop 
potato varieties resistant to the fungus that causes late blight, the disease 
responsible for the Irish potato famine. The Mexicans have plans to provide 
leadership to grow these varieties internationally, Niederhauser said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Sawyer, director general of CIP, who gave up a potential career in 
small fruits to found the research center with the world's largest 
potato-germ-plasm bank, kicked off the symposium with a rousing potato pep 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
Calling it the most important diversification crop for countries with rice 
self-sufficiency, Sawyer declared that the potato produces more calories and 
high-quality protein per hectare (2 1/2 acres) per day than any other major 
plant food. 
</P>
<P>
While the conference focused on the potato as the potential answer to world 
hunger, the promises of biotechnology and the minimization of pesticides, 
participants discussed the historical, cultural and culinary aspects of the 
tuber as well. 
</P>
<P>
The cradle of the potato is the Andes, where Peruvian Indians first raised them 
more than 5,000 years ago. The Indians were ingenious cooks, learning how to 
dehydrate potatoes so that they could be stored for future use. 
</P>
<P>
Still practiced today by Andean villagers, the ancient method consists of 
spreading the potatoes on the ground in the cold night air, followed by several 
days in the sun. Villagers then stomp on them to squeeze out the moisture that 
the freezing night air and hot sun have not already eliminated. The result is 
called chuno. 
</P>
<P>
By providing a secure food supply, the potato has enabled civilizations to 
occupy themselves with other things. With self-sufficiency in food secure, the 
Incas were able to conquer much of South America, said Rhoades. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians' potato know-how would come back to haunt them, however; almost 80 
years after the Incas were conquered by Spain, Spaniards were still living off 
their warehoused dried potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
Many scholars also link the beginning of the Industrial Revolution to the 
widespread production of potatoes in Europe, said Robert Mercer, president of 
the National Potato Promotion Board. 
</P>
<P>
A readily grown crop eased the time and energy needed to feed the population. 
That energy was then redirected toward other pursuits, namely industry and 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
Before it would gain widespread appeal in Europe, the potato went through tough 
times. First introduced by the Spaniards in 1570, Europeans thought it caused 
syphilis, leprosy, rickets and consumption. In fact, some of the English were 
so adamantly opposed to it that they wanted to ban it from the country. 
</P>
<P>
Guilt by association was the cause of much of this discrimination, according to 
Rhoades. The potato belongs to the botanical family that includes 
hallucinogenic and narcotic cousins such as mandrake and nightshade. 
</P>
<P>
The poisons in these plants were used to prepare ointments strong enough to 
give "witches the power to fly," Rhoades wrote in an article for National 
Geographic in 1982. Europeans wanted nothing to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, the Europeans eased up, and the potato was introduced to North 
America in 1621, when the governor of the English-controlled Bahamas sent two 
boxes of potatoes and other vegetables as a gift to the governor of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays the potato is grown in 130 countries, and there are efforts by 
Americans to cover the world with processed spuds. That's why children are the 
target for the National Potato Promotion Board's efforts to spread "American 
fries" to the Orient. "Their taste buds haven't been trained to like sushi 
yet," said Robert Mercer, president of the board. 
</P>
<P>
With fast-food restaurants, the growth of French fries in Japan has already 
boomed, from 25,000 metric tons in 1980 to more than 100,000 metric tons in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
And with the help of money from processors and the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, the potato board opened an office in Tokyo and began an all-out 
blitz. On one day, for example, it bought the entire ad space of the largest 
newspaper in Japan to promote American fries. It offered cooking lessons to 
Japanese brides and happily welcomed the opening of a bar in Tokyo that 
features American fries. 
</P>
<P>
But children have "made our marketing easy," said Mercer. "Kids worldwide love 
the taste of fries." 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether selling high-fat fried potatoes to children in countries 
characterized by low-fat diets might help set up a whole generation of 
heart-disease victims, Mercer replied, "It's true we're adding oil." But "it's 
strictly a business," he continued. "We could give up all that money too." 
</P>
<P>
A panel of presidents from four international potato associations addressed the 
issue of "global potato-research needs," which highlighted the stark 
differences between the needs of the industrialized and developing worlds. 
</P>
<P>
For the Potato Assn. of America and the European Assn. for Potato Research, top 
priorities include reduced use of pesticides in potato production. In the 
developed world, potatoes are the second highest user of pesticides, one 
speaker noted. Yet developing countries can barely afford chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
For the Latin American Potato Assn., where average potato yields are less than 
half those in developed countries, the focus is on research to improve yields 
and breed disease-resistant varieties. But there's even a shortage of 
scientists. 
</P>
<P>
In Africa, increases in potato production during the last 20 years are due 
almost solely to increases in acreage -- not improvements in yield. 
</P>
<P>
Production increased by 121%, and acreage rose by 112%; yields improved by only 
4%, according to Mahmoud Azzouz, president of the African Potato Assn. Basic 
breeding research to identify varieties best suited for African climates is 
still needed. 
</P>
<P>
Other potato facts: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Blue potatoes, grown in California and Michigan and sold in specialty 
stores, are sometimes referred to as "Peruvian potatoes," according to Mercer. 
Nevertheless, the seed stock came from England. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Before making the recent switch to 100% vegetable oil, McDonald's used 40% 
beef tallow and 60% soybean oil to fry its French fries, Mercer said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dell Raybould, an Idaho potato farmer, has developed a French fry that 
absorbs 50% less oil than traditional fries. It's shaped like a Vienna sausage, 
but something about its texture makes it absorb less oil, according to 
Raybould, who wouldn't divulge any more. 
</P>
<P>
According to CIP, the world is using only 10% of the wild-potato species 
available to help solve varietal adaption and pest and disease concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is that it takes a long time to introduce, select and 
establish a particular trait, and often the most desired traits are the hardest 
to achieve. In addition, new pathogens can eventually overcome resistant 
varieties, according to a paper distributed at the symposium. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the potatoes grown in the United States come from only six varieties. 
In fact, according to John Dodds of CIP, American potatoes are "lousy" in terms 
of disease resistance, since the varieties developed here have been bred 
primarily for good processing traits. 
</P>
<P>
At a reception held at the Museum of Natural History, the only tuber nibble was 
halved new potatoes with melted Cheddar. 
</P>
<P>
Chatting over chicken salad and crackers, Marjorie Leon, senior computational 
linguist at the Pan American Health Organization, described the many potato 
dishes she ate while living in Peru for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
She learned to prepare papa a la huacaina, boiled yellow potatoes covered with 
a sauce of garlic, cheese, hot yellow peppers, milk and bread crumbs and 
garnished with black olives; causa a la limena, mashed potatoes layered with 
tuna fish, and papa rellenos, riced potatoes mixed with ground beef, raisins, 
olives and onions and fried in oil. 
</P>
<P>
She misses the different kinds of potatoes available in Peru, including papa 
amarilla, a yellow potato that "tastes almost as if it had butter and salt 
already on it."

Willie London wanted to sell his well-kept, three-bedroom Lynwood home and move 
to a better neighborhood. But who would want to buy a house near areas plagued 
with gangs and crime, particularly in a depressed real estate market? He listed 
the price at $172,000, and prayed. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time, a professor at a Long Beach college put his penthouse, 
beachfront condominium for sale. The asking price: $430,000. A steal, brokers 
said, for such a gem. 
</P>
<P>
The professor, who asked that his name not be used, received not one offer in 
four months. 
</P>
<P>
Willie London sold his house in a week. 
</P>
<P>
One word explains both scenarios: affordability. 
</P>
<P>
Among the hottest areas for selling property right now are those with the 
reputation -- rightly or wrongly -- of being the worst places to live. 
</P>
<P>
Families are buying where they can afford to: Compton, Lynwood, South-Central 
Los Angeles, Willowbrook, Watts, and parts of Long Beach, East Los Angeles, 
Carson, Inglewood and South Gate. In many cases, buyers choose to cope with 
potential neighborhood problems rather than sacrifice dreams of home ownership. 
</P>
<P>
More prosperous areas of Long Beach and the Southeast, on the other hand, are 
suffering from the same malaise affecting real estate nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"We handle Compton and Lynwood," said LeFrancis Arnold, president of Century 21 
Arrow Realty Inc. in Lynwood. "It's a good market. The things I'm seeing at a 
national level and in the Southern California area have not affected our market 
as negatively as it has others." 
</P>
<P>
Of some 100 Los Angeles County branch offices in his district, Arnold's is 
running No. 3 in total transactions and No. 8 in commission dollars earned, 
despite the smaller commissions that come with less expensive properties. Other 
Century 21 offices that serve part of the same area also are faring well. 
</P>
<P>
"My average sales price is the lowest of all the Century 21 offices in the 
region," Arnold said. "The average sales price for this office last year was 
$115,000." 
</P>
<P>
Some of this activity in less prosperous areas involves purchases in gated 
communities or townhouses with security systems. But the rest of it happens in 
old, established neighborhoods prejudged to be in mortal decline. 
</P>
<P>
Market conditions could reverse that. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to see a change in some of those neighborhoods," said Earl 
Bonawitz, director of marketing and training for one of Century 21's regional 
offices. "You're going to see them cleaned up. You're going to see pride of 
ownership coming into some of those neighborhoods that you haven't seen in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
"For a while it was all non-owner-occupied properties being bought and sold. 
Now you're seeing people buy those properties who want to live in them." 
</P>
<P>
Said realtor Arnold: "You can get a beautiful home in Lynwood for under 
$200,000, three or four bedrooms, 5,000-square-foot lot, sometimes a pool. It's 
the same with Compton." 
</P>
<P>
For better or worse, the active low-end market has pushed prices up in that 
category. "Our average sales price is about $13,000 higher this year than last 
year," Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, properties in Beverly Hills are selling, on average, for more than 
a million dollars less than their listed prices and staying on the market an 
average of 131 days, according to a recent study by Jon Douglas Co., a realty 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
But high asking prices have dulled the market well beyond Beverly Hills. 
Business is slower in La Habra Heights, a desirable, rustic hillside community 
where horse trails wind between acre lots. Home prices ranging from $400,000 
into the millions have brought fewer takers in recent months. About 18 months 
ago, properties in La Habra Heights took one to six months to sell. Now the 
more common wait is six months to a year, said Eileen Greene, a La Habra 
Century 21 real estate agent who specializes in that area. 
</P>
<P>
The picture is not much different in the Whittier area. Brokers there estimate 
that the marketing time to sell a house has increased from less than six days 
to 60 or more days. "We used to specialize in selling homes worth $300,000 to a 
million dollars," said Dennis Rosas, who owns Home Brokers Inc. in Whittier. 
"We have now gone back to selling whatever we can get our hands on." 
</P>
<P>
Whittier homes selling for about $225,000 in early 1989 now go for about 
$190,000, which would force some recent buyers to take a loss if they had to 
move, Rosas said. "We have two kinds of sellers: unrealistic and realistic," he 
said. "The unrealistic are still trying to tack on that 10% to 12% appreciation 
per annum, and they're not going to get it." 
</P>
<P>
Nor are real estate investors thriving as before, said Maurilio Gonzalez, who 
buys foreclosed properties, refurbishes them and resells them. He estimated 
that more than 60% of those who buy homes to resell "are hurting or running 
scared because of the market change." 
</P>
<P>
In the past, "all you had to do was sit around and hold the property," he said. 
And if an investor purchased a foreclosed house, "it took you, say four, five, 
six months to evict the people in the property, and the values would go up. A 
marginal property would become a good property in six months. You didn't have 
to be shrewd to make money. Now you do." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said he prospers because he is willing to work in the poor 
neighborhoods that many brokers and other investers eschew, places such as 
Compton and South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, business is good, because I stay at the bottom end of the spectrum," 
he said. "There are a lot of deals, so to speak, not only at foreclosure sales, 
but also on the market." 
</P>
<P>
In order to make a profit, Gonzalez said, house investors usually try to turn 
over a property in six months and raise the price by at least 25%, which 
contributed to past spiraling home prices. Since the market flattened, 
overextended investors have been stuck with property they can neither sell for 
a profit nor make the payments on. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally know at least eight or nine people who have now forgotten about 
the real estate business and gone on to other things," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
Realtors played a part in fueling unrealistic expectations about home prices, 
said Richard Gaylord, a Long Beach broker and former member of the city 
Planning Commission. "We have permitted sellers to list their property at far 
above the market value." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, that practice presented little problem. That is about when 
Gaylord received a listing to sell a Long Beach monastery whose historic 
significance should have hindered its market value. There might have been 
community opposition had the building been torn down or converted to a less 
pious use. Such factors usually lower a property's value. As it happened, the 
property eventually was sold to a Buddhist sect that wanted to save the 
building, Gaylord said. But there were offers galore. 
</P>
<P>
Gaylord listed the property for $3.2 million. "The appraisals were in the range 
of $3 million," he recalled. "I had six offers of $3.5 million within the first 
week the property was on the market." 
</P>
<P>
Times have changed in Long Beach. In the last part of 1989, a listed home took 
an average of 30 days to sell. Currently, it takes about five months to sell a 
house there. 
</P>
<P>
A four-bedroom home within walking distance of the shore has languished on 
Gaylord's listings for two years at a price other brokers once insisted it 
would sell for. Gaylord long ago advised the homeowner to be more realistic. 
</P>
<P>
The college professor, by contrast, took this advice and found a practical 
solution. "One of the parties that had viewed my condominium had difficulty 
selling a townhouse in Irvine. They were desperate and I was desperate. I said, 
'Perhaps we can trade.' " 
</P>
<P>
The professor got a home outside the city where he could retire and enjoy golf 
and tennis facilities. The elderly couple he traded with now have an oceanfront 
home located closer to family members. And they now live in a building where 
they no longer have to climb stairs. 
</P>
<P>
With that kind of flexibility and resourcefulness, Gaylord said, sellers can 
sell and brokers can thrive even in the current market. "It's taking a lot more 
work, more preparation and talking to sellers, showing buyers a lot more 
property," he said of his profession. "The agents who can't carry themselves 
leave the market and leave more for those of us who are working. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard professionals say we're in a normal market now. What we had before 
was abnormal," Gaylord said. 
</P>
<P>
Most brokers talk of an expected thaw in the housing market come spring. After 
all, the demand for home ownership remains high. No one knows for certain, 
however, when first-time buyers will be able to afford to purchase en masse 
again. It is those buyers who fuel the entire home-selling industry, brokers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Successful home seller Willie London, 43, bought his first house when he was 
25. He paid $27,500. London, an elevator mechanic, doubts that he could afford 
to buy a first house if he were starting out today. "I feel sorry for the young 
kids coming up today unless they have some kind of help."

A 4-year-old girl waiting for her brother on a Highland Park school playground 
was struck and fatally injured by a falling eucalyptus tree branch, police said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The child, Carmen Munguia, was waiting outside Buchanan Street School about 
2:40 p.m. Wednesday with her mother to pick up Carmen's brother, a student, 
detective Ron Whitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Whitt said a large limb broke off a eucalyptus tree on the playground and fell, 
striking Carmen on the head. "They rushed her right into the school nurse, then 
they called the ambulance, but she was unconscious from the time it happened," 
he said. She was taken to Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena and placed 
on life support until arrangements could be made to donate her organs.

President Bush proclaimed a "new era for clean air" today as he signed 
far-reaching legislation placing new curbs on air pollution from automobiles, 
factories and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"Every American expects and deserves to breathe clean air," Bush said, signing 
the Clean Air Act of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
He called the measure "the centerpiece of our environmental agenda" and the 
"most significant air pollution legislation in our nation's history." 
</P>
<P>
Bush signed the measure at an East Room ceremony, standing with key lawmakers 
involved in the long and contentious fight over the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a true red-letter day for all Americans," Bush declared. "We begin a 
new era for clean air." 
</P>
<P>
"No American should have to drive out of town to have to breathe clean air. 
Every city in America should have clean air. And with this legislation, I 
firmly believe we will," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Mission defined, mission accomplished," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, 748 pages long, will affect virtually every American. It was approved 
by Congress easily last month, belying 16 months of debate and long hours of 
behind-the-scenes negotiations on a myriad of provisions. 
</P>
<P>
In advance of today's bill-signing, environmental groups hailed the bill's 
enactment. "The Clean Air Act of 1990 is like a breath of fresh air after a 
10-year smog alert," said Sierra Club President Susan Merrow.

The man who tried to shoot at Soviet leaders during last week's Revolution Day 
parade had been planning to kill President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for more than 
two years, Soviet news reports said today. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander A. Shmonov, a 38-year-old unemployed man from Leningrad, was charged 
with attempted terrorism in the Nov. 7 shooting on Red Square. 
</P>
<P>
Shmonov managed to fire two shots but was prevented by police from aiming at 
Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders, who were observing the traditional military 
parade from atop Lenin's Mausoleum. No one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Pyotr Sokolov, a top KGB investigator, told the newspaper Glasnost that a 
body search of Shmonov turned up a note confirming that Gorbachev was his 
intended victim. 
</P>
<P>
"The note was prepared in advance in case of his death during the assassination 
attempt," Sokolov said in an interview. "In the note, Shmonov explicitly set 
out his criminal intentions in regard to the Soviet president." 
</P>
<P>
According to Glasnost, the shooting took place just 46 yards from the 
mausoleum. Police said an officer had noticed Shmonov pulling out a hunting 
rifle and aiming at the Soviet leaders on the mausoleum. 
</P>
<P>
The officer forced the gun barrel skyward before Shmonov fired the two shots. 
He was then grabbed by more security men. 
</P>
<P>
"Shmonov said he had been preparing this assassination attempt for more than 
two years," Sokolov told the newspaper. "During that time, he acquired an 
imported double-barreled hunting rifle and practiced rapid firing." 
</P>
<P>
Another newspaper, Rabochaya Trybuna, said Shmonov had a hunting license and 
bought the weapon legally for $1,600. 
</P>
<P>
"He went to a public library to read about the correct way to prepare a 
cartridge and asked some questions of hunters who were in the store," the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
"To carry the gun into Red Square, he sawed off the butt and fixed a kind of 
pocket made of rubbery material inside his jacket," the report said, quoting an 
official in the state prosecutor's office. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Andrei Mylnikov, the police officer who subdued Shmonov during the 
shooting, said in an interview with Moscow News on Wednesday that the gunman 
told investigators: "I wanted to kill Gorbachev."

NATO and the Warsaw Pact agreed in principle today to a treaty drastically 
slashing their Cold War arsenals of non-nuclear weapons, delegates said. 
</P>
<P>
The 22 nations represented at the Conventional Forces in Europe talks then 
began cleaning up the 200-page text, which sets ceilings on the number of 
weapons each alliance can hold. 
</P>
<P>
The treaty, the first covering conventional arms since World War II, is to be 
formally initialed in Vienna on Sunday and signed a day later in Paris at a 
34-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Agreement on the treaty, far from certain as recently as a few weeks ago, 
clears the way to full participation at the Paris summit. The United States had 
said it would not attend unless the treaty was certain to be approved. 
</P>
<P>
Under the treaty, described as the most far-reaching and complex arms accord 
ever negotiated, each alliance will be limited to 20,000 tanks, 30,000 armored 
cars, 20,000 artillery pieces, 6,800 combat aircraft and 2,000 attack 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
The ceilings will be divided between four zones in the area under negotiation, 
a vast tract of 2.3 million square miles stretching from the Atlantic to the 
Urals. 
</P>
<P>
Under the overall ceilings, each country will have its own national limit. To 
reach these ceilings, nations will have to scrap or convert to peaceful use a 
quarter of a million arms, in some cases up to half of current stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow will have to get rid of 19,000 tanks to meet the new limit. 
</P>
<P>
Talks will start immediately after the summit on a second-stage agreement that 
will set ceilings on the number of troops deployed by both sides.

Illegal exports of Latin American cocaine to Europe have jumped sharply this 
year, and some experts estimate they are running at almost twice their 1989 
level. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. narcotics officials and Latin Americans familiar with the 
multibillion-dollar cocaine trade said today that large-scale overproduction of 
coca leaf and a stagnant U.S. market have caused an unprecedented export drive 
to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. experts estimate that Europeans consumed about 90 tons of cocaine last 
year. Based on seizures in the first nine months of this year, they forecast 
the 1990 figure at between 160 and 180 tons. 
</P>
<P>
"The Europeans are now where we (Americans) were 10 years ago," said an 
official of the Drug Enforcement Administration. "They are facing a cocaine 
epidemic."

A Soviet man who claimed he had a bomb hijacked an Aeroflot passenger jet on a 
domestic flight and forced its crew to fly today to Helsinki, where he 
surrendered to police and asked for political asylum, national radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
None of the 66 passengers or six crew members aboard were hurt, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The hijacked aircraft landed at 5:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Commissioner Kauko Karhuviita said the Tupolev aircraft had been 
en route to Moscow from Leningrad when the hijacker threatened to blow it up. 
</P>
<P>
"The hijacker wanted to fly to Stockholm, but the plane landed here. The 
situation is under control now," Karhuviita said in a radio interview. 
</P>
<P>
Three Soviet planes have been hijacked to Finland this year. The government 
extradited two hijackers and refused political asylum to a third, who is in 
police custody.

The death toll in the country's worst massacre rose to 13 today when police 
found human remains in the debris of a house the killer set ablaze before 
opening fire on his neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The remains were believed to be those of two 11-year-old girls missing in the 
23-hour siege that ended Wednesday in the South Island seaside hamlet of 
Aramoana. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery of the two bodies raised to 13 the number of people slain by 
33-year-old David Gray before police killed him in a shoot-out. Two children 
were wounded by Gray, who wiped out nearly half of Aramoana's population.

Police said today they have pulled the plug on 1-800-WANT-POT, a toll-free 
telephone number for a $30,000-a-day drug operation that used bicycle 
messengers to deliver marijuana anywhere in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they arrested Michael Cesar, 48, who described himself as "the Pope 
of Pot," and five bicycle messengers Wednesday in the Greenwich Village shop 
where the service was based. 
</P>
<P>
When customers dialed 1-800-WANT-POT, a bicycle messenger would be dispatched 
from a comic book store, police spokesman Capt. Stephen Davis said. He said the 
messenger would bring one-eighth of an ounce of the drug for $50 to any 
Manhattan location. 
</P>
<P>
"These people got marijuana delivered like most people send out for coffee," 
prosecutor Sterling Johnson said.

One of America's familiar stogies has been stubbed out. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Roaring Twenties, a beaming, bespectacled likeness of Emanuel (Manny) 
Rosenfeld has peered out from advertisements for the Pep Boys -- Manny, Moe 
&amp; Jack. 
</P>
<P>
And in the corner of Manny's mouth, for all these decades, was a fat cigar. 
This was, after all, an auto parts and service chain, and in the world of 
greasy overalls and grimy fingernails, a cigar is not out of place. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Manny smoked one until his death in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
But now, to coincide with today's Great American Smokeout, the company is 
getting rid of Manny's cigar. 
</P>
<P>
"That's great," said Dr. Stephen Weiss, president of the Philadelphia division 
of the American Cancer Society. "After 70 years of constant tobacco use, this 
is a very positive step. I guarantee it will clean his intake valves and 
provide more pep for the Pep Boys." 
</P>
<P>
"The decision was based on our desire to promote a healthier image for 
employees and customers," said Fred Stampone, senior vice president of the 
company, which started in Philadelphia in 1921. "It seemed like the right thing 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
The change will be seen in coming weeks in print advertising, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pep Boys logo has been around since the '20s, smiling caricatures drawn by 
Harry Moskowitz. That's Manny on the left, Maurice (Moe) Strauss in the middle 
and, on the right, Moe's brother, Izzy.

Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. said today that profits surged 45% from a year 
earlier in the quarter ended in September but that costs of the Sky television 
network plunged its British operations into the red. 
</P>
<P>
Profits rose to $42.1 million for the three months, buoyed by an abnormal 
profit of $22.3 million, details of which were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
News Corp.'s British operations lost $16.2 million, a sharp turnaround from 
profits of $48.1 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
But the merger of Sky with rival British Satellite Broadcasting, announced 
earlier this month, will cut costs substantially and "ensure a return to 
profitability in the United Kingdom over the remainder of the financial year," 
News Corp. said. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the company's biggest profit generator, News Corp. said 
turnover and operating profits were substantially higher at both 20th Century 
Fox Film Corp. and Fox Television and Fox Broadcasting.

British unemployment showed its biggest monthly jump since 1986 in October, 
rising above 1.7 million and bringing more bad news for embattled Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Government figures released today showed the jobless line longer by 32,200 at 
1,702,700, or 6% of the work force. 
</P>
<P>
Economic troubles are among the reasons Thatcher's popularity has waned, 
leading to a current bid to unseat her by former Defense Minister Michael 
Heseltine. 
</P>
<P>
After declining for four years, the number of jobless turned up again in March 
and Employment Secretary Michael Howard said the rise is likely to continue 
before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
British unemployment remains lower than in Spain, Ireland, Italy, France, 
Denmark, Belgium, Greece and the Netherlands.

Book publisher Simon &amp; Schuster said today that it will not release 
"American Psycho," a violent new novel by critically acclaimed author Bret 
Easton Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Richard E. Snyder released a statement saying the book, which was 
scheduled to be shipped to stores next month, will not be handled by Simon 
&amp; Schuster. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis' publicist said the decision smacks of censorship. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis, 26, is the author of the critically praised novel "Less Than Zero," 
which depicts a morally decadent lifestyle among children of upper-income 
families in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The statement offered no further explanation for the new book's cancellation. 
But Snyder told the Washington Post: "In my opinion, there was an incorrect 
decision" by editors who bought the book and approved its publication. 
</P>
<P>
"American Psycho," the story of a young, successful Wall Street businessman who 
can't stop killing people, was criticized for its vivid descriptions of 
violence against women.

A bitter and protracted domestic pilots dispute savaged earnings at Qantas, 
Australia's international airline, its chairman said today. 
</P>
<P>
After posting a record $136-million profit in 1988-89, Qantas' profit fell 
93.1% to $9 million in the year to June 30, 1990, Chairman Bill Dix said in the 
annual report. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots' eight-month dispute over a pay claim, which ended earlier this 
year, cut operating profits at the state-owned carrier by $127 million, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Qantas, the world's second-oldest airline -- it celebrates its 70th birthday 
Friday -- was also hit by rising fuel costs, spending $331 million on fuel in 
1989-90, compared to $261 million the previous year.

Six Texas A&amp;M football players, including a starting cornerback, and one 
former player have been charged in connection with the alleged illegal use of 
telephone charge cards. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's arrests came as a result of a monthlong investigation by Bryan 
police and CallAmerica, a long-distance carrier in the Bryan-College Station 
area. 
</P>
<P>
A&amp;M Head Coach R. C. Slocum said all six players will make the team trip 
this weekend to Fayetteville, Ark., for a game against Arkansas. Disciplinary 
action will be taken later only if the athletes are found guilty, Slocum said. 
</P>
<P>
CallAmerica announced last month that thousands of dollars worth of 
long-distance phone calls had been made using illegal credit card numbers and 
that several A&amp;M football players were among the A&amp;M students under 
investigation. Arrest warrants were issued Tuesday, and the six players turned 
themselves in Wednesday, Slocum said. They were released on bond later.

AGASSI TO SKIP $6-MILLION ITF TOURNEY

Andre Agassi today joined Boris Becker and John McEnroe in snubbing the 
$6-million Grand Slam Cup, the richest tournament in tennis history. 
</P>
<P>
The Grand Slam Cup, scheduled for Dec. 11-16 in Munich, has raised controversy 
by offering record prize money. 
</P>
<P>
The winner in the 16-man field will earn $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi, ranked fourth in the world, originally signed to play in the inaugural 
event but gave no reason for skipping the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"After careful consideration, I have decided that I will not compete in the 
Grand Slam Cup," he said in a one-sentence statement distributed to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi is in Frankfurt competing at the ATP Tour World Championships, which 
includes the eight top-ranked players in the world. The ATP Tour has opposed 
the Grand Slam Cup, which it sees as a rival to its season-ending tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Grand Slam Cup is being organized by the International Tennis Federation 
and the directors of the four Grand Slam tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi's withdrawal leaves six of the top 10 players still signed up. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Sampras, the U.S. Open champion who is ranked fifth, said Wednesday that 
he is not certain if he will play in Munich. Sampras said his participation 
depends on how his shin splints feel.

FRANCESA STIRS FIFTH-DOWN DEBATE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK WARNER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like a nagging cold or a persistent salesman, the fifth-down controversy just 
won't go away. 
</P>
<P>
The uproar over Colorado's disputed 33-31 victory over Missouri started to fade 
a few weeks after the Oct. 6 game. But CBS commentator Mike Francesa is 
stirring it up again. 
</P>
<P>
Francesa, one of 60 voters in the Associated Press college football poll, is 
troubled by the fact that Colorado scored the winning touchdown on what proved 
to be an illegal extra down. So troubled that the second-ranked Buffaloes might 
not get his vote as national champion even if they beat No. 1 Notre Dame in the 
Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's a close situation, that (fifth-down) game could be a factor," Francesa 
says. 
</P>
<P>
And what's a close situation? Francesa says that if Colorado barely beats Notre 
Dame and third-ranked Miami or No. 4 Georgia Tech rout their bowl opponents, he 
might vote the Hurricanes or Yellow Jackets No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"Think about it," Francesa says. "If that happens, you'd be talking about an 
unbeaten Tech team vs. a Colorado team with one loss, one tie and one shadowy 
game." 
</P>
<P>
Francesa recently infuriated Colorado fans by making similar remarks on a 
Denver radio station. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not going to win any popularity contests out here," says Dave Plati, the 
school's sports information director. 
</P>
<P>
Like other Colorado defenders, Plati points out that the Buffaloes 
intentionally spiked the ball on the next-to-last play because they thought it 
was third down. It actually was the fourth down, but a mixup by the officials 
gave Colorado another play, which turned out to be the winning 1-yard sneak by 
Charles Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Plati says the Buffaloes wouldn't have spiked the ball had they known it was 
the fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
"Doesn't he (Francesa) know the facts?" Plati says. "Why should we be punished 
for playing under the guidelines we were given? People think we're the villain 
because they think we cheated. And that's just not true." 
</P>
<P>
Francesa considers the victory tainted even though it was upheld by the Big 
Eight. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his reservations about the fifth-down game, Francesa says he would vote 
the Buffaloes No. 1 if they win impressively on New Year's Day and no other 
team makes a convincing case for the national championship.

PETROVIC THREATENS TO QUIT IF BLAZERS DON'T TRADE HIM

Yugoslav Drazen Petrovic says he's tired of his reserve guard role with the 
Trail Blazers and wants to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the 12th man on the roster and I don't deserve that," Petrovic said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not being treated fairly." 
</P>
<P>
Petrovic, 26, a sports hero in his native Yugoslavia, said he would give the 
Blazers until Nov. 30 to work some kind of trade. 
</P>
<P>
"If nothing is done, I'm going back to Yugoslavia," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If Petrovic leaves the Trail Blazers and returns to Yugoslavia, he would be 
ineligible to play professionally in Spain or Italy because all NBA contracts 
are recognized by FIBA, the sport's international governing body. 
</P>
<P>
He could play for the Yugoslavian national team. 
</P>
<P>
Petrovic is in the second year of a three-year contract that calls for the 
Trail Blazers to pay him $1.3 million for the 1990-91 season.

A formidable U.S. golf team headed by Beth Daniel, Patty Sheehan and Betsy King 
takes on the best of Europe on Friday in the inaugural Solheim Cup, women's 
answer to the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The American trio, who between them won more than $2 million this year, will 
spearhead the eight-player home team in the three-day match-play series modeled 
on the Ryder Cup which has been contested since 1927 by male professional 
golfers from both sides of the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be great for women's golf," enthused U.S. captain Kathy 
Whitworth, winner of a record 88 LPGA Tour events. "This is so exciting because 
it's all new. I feel like a pioneer." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team also includes No. 4 money winner Cathy Gerring, Pat Bradley, 
Rosie Jones, Nancy Lopez and Dottie Mochrie. 
</P>
<P>
European captain Mickey Walker's top players are Trish Johnson of England, 
winner of the 1990 European Order of Merit; Marie-Laure de Lorenz of France, 
who won the honor in 1888 and 1989, and Sweden's Helen Alfredsson who captured 
the 1990 British Women's Open.

MILLI VANILLI IS REALLY A MARCEL MARCEAU ACT; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: ANOTHER GROUP RECORDED THE VOCALS THAT THE 1989 GRAMMY-WINNING DUO 
SIMPLY LIP-SYNC, THEIR PRODUCER SAYS.

<P>
The rumors are true: Milli Vanilli -- those dreadlocked, hunky dudes Rob and 
Fab -- never actually sang on their debut album that sold 7 million copies, the 
producer-arranger conceded. 
</P>
<P>
"The record company never knew that. I never told them anything," said Frank 
Farian, the German producer who turned a pair of anonymous pretty boys into an 
international phenomenon. "Later on, after the record was out, there were some 
people who raised some questions." 
</P>
<P>
The questions were never really answered as the Vanillis won a 1989 Grammy for 
Best New Artist. Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan became international stars, 
lip-syncing their way through television and concert appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"Girl You Know It's True" and "Blame It on the Rain" were huge hit singles for 
the band. At the MTV awards, the boys boasted they were better than Elvis or 
Bob Dylan. 
</P>
<P>
Farian -- who has a new album with a new group coming out in January -- said he 
was forced to go public with the revelations when the guys told him they wanted 
to sing on the follow-up to "Girl You Know It's True." 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'No. I don't go for that.' Sure, they have a voice, but that's not 
really what I want to use on my records," said Farian, describing the encounter 
that occurred earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
So the bare-chested vocalists once described by the New York Times as 
"exotically sexy" really did nothing but look good and lip sync for videos? 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing more," Farian said through an interpreter during an interview here 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A telephone message left today to the group's manager in Germany was not 
immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
Farian's revelation didn't bother Arista, the label that sold "Girl You Know 
It's True." 
</P>
<P>
"Seven million albums? Embarrassing?" asked Roy Lott, vice president for 
operations at Arista. "I don't mean the end justifies the means. But we sold 7 
million albums." 
</P>
<P>
Lott said there was no reason to doubt Farian's veracity: "I certainly assume 
the producer would know who sang on the record." 
</P>
<P>
According to Farian, the idea to hire Rob and Fab as front men for the band 
came to him when the fabulous bunko boys arrived at his studio in Germany 
shortly after the recording of "Girl You Know It's True." 
</P>
<P>
"It suddenly clicked in my mind, and it was kind of evident: I had the music, 
there were the people who wanted to perform outside," Farian said. "And I said, 
"Hey, let's put that together and make a great record out of it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Farian would not say who the real singers were but added that they will appear 
on his next album -- not a Milli Vanilli album. 
</P>
<P>
Lott said the label is unconcerned about the dupe, and it plans to distribute 
Farian's new album. Lott has heard some of the record already, and he said 
"Frank has my full support." 
</P>
<P>
As to Rob and Fab, well, their future's a bit more uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
"We are purely their distributor. We do not have a specific deal with Rob or 
Fab," Lott said.

'SHELTERING SKY' CAST ENDURED REAL DUST, FLIES

Bernardo Bertolucci admits putting his cast and crew through an ordeal to make 
"The Sheltering Sky," a film about an American couple seeking to revive their 
marriage deep in the Sahara. 
</P>
<P>
The film will have a gala premiere tonight at the year-old Opera-Bastille. 
</P>
<P>
Based on Paul Bowles' best-selling novel by the same name, the film stars Debra 
Winger and John Malkovich as Kit and Port Moresby, sophisticated New York 
artists who go into the African desert to save their failing marriage. 
</P>
<P>
It is due to open in the United States in mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
Bertolucci told reporters after an advance screening Wednesday that the cast 
and crew of 120 battled desert heat and flooding caused by the first rains in 
the region in two years. 
</P>
<P>
The storms swept away roads and bridges, stranding equipment trucks, the cast, 
crew and even Bertolucci himself. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a hard movie to make. The sweat isn't makeup; it's real sweat," he 
said. "The dust is real dust, and the flies are real flies." 
</P>
<P>
Winger said filming on location in the desert added a special quality to the 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
"I had always felt a pull to the desert, whether in the southwestern United 
States or the Negev," Winger said. "But the Sahara was really something 
different; it was much rougher than I expected." 
</P>
<P>
She said she was unable to return to the United States when filming ended last 
January. Instead, she put a pack on her back and traveled through Niger for 
three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Only then could I face coming home. I had the desert inside of me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bertolucci said he was attracted to "The Sheltering Sky," which became 
something of a cult book when published in 1949, because "after 'The Last 
Emperor,' I was really interested in doing something that didn't have a lot of 
actors and a lot of costumes."

A state appeals court overturned the disorderly conduct convictions of three 
members of the group NWA for asking women in a concert audience if they wanted 
to have sex with rapper Eric (Eazy-E) Wright. 
</P>
<P>
The court Wednesday said there was no evidence the group's behavior at the 1989 
show recklessly inconvenienced, annoyed or alarmed anyone -- the standard under 
Ohio law. 
</P>
<P>
All five members of NWA had been charged. Lorenzo (M.C. Ren) Patterson, Oshea 
(Ice Cube) Jackson and Todd (Too-Short) Shaw were convicted and fined $100 
each. Wright was acquitted, and Antoine Carraby is awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling Wednesday was the second obscenity defeat for city prosecutors in 
the past two months. 
</P>
<P>
In October, jurors rejected obscenity charges involving the Contemporary Arts 
Center's display of photos by Robert Mapplethorpe.

LIZ SMITH: SCHUMACHER, OUT OF 'PHANTOM,' STARTS 'DYING YOUNG'

THIS WEEK director Joel Schumacher began filming "Dying Young," starring Julia 
Roberts and Campbell Scott, in Mendocino, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
But after much hoopla -- Schumacher has backed out of his commitment to direct 
the movie of "The Phantom of the Opera." He and Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote the 
screenplay together and spent months here and abroad making plans. But, as one 
observer says, "You know, in show biz, if people don't 'get married' right 
away, sometimes it never happens." 
</P>
<P>
Joel and Andrew say they are still friends, but someone other than Joel will 
direct the great London and Broadway stage hit musical for the screen. 
</P>
<P>
THE BRITISH are coming -- apart? London is agog over director Trevor Nunn. He 
has left his wife, Sharon Leigh, and their two children to trek off after 
actress Imogene Stubbs of the Royal Shakespeare Company. (She has just played 
the leading role in the coming Herbert Ross movie, "True Colors.") Nunn had 
directed Stubbs in "Othello." 
</P>
<P>
Nunn already had a go-round with American actress Judy Kuhn while married to 
Sharon Leigh. And, as a matter of fact, he was once wed to actress Janet 
Suzmann and left her for -- Sharon Leigh. 
</P>
<P>
Award-winning playwright Tom Stoppard (his "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are 
Dead" recently won the Venice Film Festival) and his wife, Dr. Miriam Stoppard, 
are also suffering some apartness. 
</P>
<P>
THE OTHER day I reported all wasn't so hotsy-totsy between those Columbia 
biggies Jon Peters and Peter Guber. They take exception and say my report 
"quite saddened" them. "Our relationship, both personally and professionally, 
has withstood numerous outside assaults. . . . There is not a scintilla of 
truth in your article." Then they invited me to come visit in their homes, 
which would "enable you to understand our relationship in person." 
</P>
<P>
Well, this is one of the most unusual denials I've ever received in this 
business. It's nice not to be yelled at or threatened with broken legs, for a 
change.

LENDL, BECKER REACH SEMIS AT THE ATP; 
</P>
<P>
TENNIS: THIGH INJURY DOESN'T SLOW GERMAN'S QUEST FOR THE NO. 1 RANKING. GOMEZ 
AND MUSTER FALL BY THE WAYSIDE.

<TEXT>
<P>
Boris Becker, chasing his dream of the world No. 1 ranking, and Ivan Lendl 
reached the semifinals of the ATP World Championships today. 
</P>
<P>
Becker showed no signs of the thigh injury which sidelined him last week as he 
overcame a determined Thomas Muster, 7-5, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
The mathematics of the round-robin competition meant that Becker's win also 
guaranteed Ivan Lendl, who earlier beat French Open champion Andres Gomez for 
his second win of the tournament, a place in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
If Muster had beaten Becker, Lendl would have needed to wait for the outcome of 
the final group matches Friday to know his fate. 
</P>
<P>
By his own admission, Ecuador's Gomez served so badly that he virtually gave 
away the swift 6-4, 6-1 victory to Lendl. 
</P>
<P>
Muster, who lost to Lendl on Tuesday, saved four match points before succumbing 
to world No. 2 Becker. 
</P>
<P>
The Austrian suddenly found himself serving at 5-1 down and 15-40 in the second 
set. 
</P>
<P>
His serve got him back to deuce, and though Becker earned two more match 
points, the German's own mistakes gave Muster a breather. 
</P>
<P>
Muster's escape unsettled Becker, who lost the next 10 points in succession, 
dropping his own serve to love and only getting back into the game when Muster 
double-faulted. 
</P>
<P>
When Becker got to his fifth match point, in the 10th game, he was determined 
not to give Muster another chance to get off the hook, and a fierce smash 
clinched the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not my surface," Muster said of the fast carpet laid in Frankfurt's 
Festhalle. "In the second set I lost control." 
</P>
<P>
The sixth-seeded Gomez's second defeat in two days snuffed out his hopes of 
reaching the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"My serving was crucial," said Gomez who, like Muster, prefers a slower court. 
"I made five double faults and I felt tired on my serve." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez opened well by breaking Lendl in the second game. But that startled Lendl 
into action. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, who surrendered the world's top ranking in August and is now third, soon 
took a 5-1 lead in the second set.
