For years, children's advocates and advice columnists have warned about the 
dangers of too much TV for kids. For parents who worry that there's something 
unhealthful about being a couch potato but do not know exactly what to tell the 
young ones (especially if mom and dad are Oprah or football junkies 
themselves), there is new ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, a study linked obesity in children with television. Now, researchers 
at UC Irvine have discovered a correlation between television viewing and high 
levels of cholesterol in youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
The UCI study found that kids who watch between two and four hours a day are 
twice as likely to have high levels of cholesterol as those who watch less than 
two hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
Those who watch more than four hours a day are four times as likely. Doctors 
say that high cholesterol levels in children are a risk factor for 
cardiovascular disease in adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
Are kids somehow getting zapped with cholesterol rays by the tube? No, it's the 
sedentary lifestyle that creates the problem. Dr. Kurt V. Gold, a resident in 
pediatrics at UCI, says that kids who watch lots of TV are bombarded with ads 
for junk food, and, indeed, they are big consumers of those items. And if kids 
are watching television, they aren't physically active. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gold suggests, only half in jest, that maybe parents should buy a TV set 
that only operates when people are exercising. Short of that, how about simply 
tuning out such notions as "average three hours a day of TV viewing" as an 
acceptable family norm?

RAISING 17,000 NEW QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In two days the 22 nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the 
Warsaw Pact are scheduled to sign an agreement for the largest conventional 
arms cuts in history. The numbers involved are staggering. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of weapons -- tanks, artillery pieces, armored personnel 
carriers, fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters -- will disappear from Europe, an 
outward and visible sign that a new era of greater trust and security has 
dawned over a Continent so long riven by a costly and perilous ideological 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
A disturbing element of uncertainty, however, threatens to cloud this new dawn. 
The Soviet Union, by moving early to withdraw a great deal of combat equipment 
from the territory of its erstwhile Warsaw Pact allies, has substantially 
reduced the number of its weapons that must be destroyed or militarily 
deactivated -- without, necessarily, significantly reducing its overall 
arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 17,000 tanks, for example, have already been shipped across the Urals to 
Soviet Asia and so are not subject to the provisions of the Conventional Forces 
in Europe treaty. The status of those tanks and other heavy weapons moved to 
Siberia seems certain to be raised as a point of contention when the CFE treaty 
goes to the Senate for ratification. 
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. officials suggest that the stored weapons are no danger to NATO. Much 
of the equipment is apparently being left out in the open where the elements 
will soon get to it. 
</P>
<P>
Still, an estimated 16,800 Soviet tanks, 15,000 other armored vehicles and 
20,000 artillery pieces that had earlier been headed for destruction have been 
shifted and so escaped the scrap heap. 
</P>
<P>
Some may indeed be left to rust, but Washington has asked for an accounting on 
these weapons and is awaiting a Soviet response. The Senate almost surely will 
demand such an accounting and seek clear assurances about the weapons' future 
before it agrees to ratify the CFE treaty. 
</P>
<P>
A very real, very serious issue of Soviet good faith has been raised. It must 
be promptly addressed, for much more than the CFE treaty may depend on getting 
satisfactory answers.

NO PAIN, NO GAIN: HOW TO TRADE UP; 
</P>
<P>
BRUSSELS TALKS AFFECT EVERY AMERICAN FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes to enjoying the fruits of world trade, we Americans always feel 
as if we're on the losing end. That doesn't do our psyche or our pocketbooks 
much good. 
</P>
<P>
But all that could change. If new international trading laws go into effect, 
they would mean more jobs, better wages and perhaps cheaper clothing and other 
goods -- big, big trade dividends for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Such improvements in our standard of living depend in no little measure on what 
happens in Brussels over the next two weeks. If negotiators for 105 nations can 
hammer out a satisfactory agreement, they will succeed in establishing a new 
framework for world trade, unfettered by distorting government subsidies and 
other protective trade practices. 
</P>
<P>
At stake for the United States are billions and billions of trade dollars. A 
new trade agreement under the GATT (the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) 
umbrella could add $300 billion, or 5%, to the gross output of the U.S. economy 
by the end of this decade, according to a study by the Stern Group, a trade 
advisory group. U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills figures liberalization 
would result in a $200-billion increase in U.S. exports to Third World 
countries over the same period. If government farm subsidies -- which amount to 
$250 billion a year worldwide -- are eventually phased out, Washington could 
get some budget relief. U.S. farm subsidy dollars could be diverted to 
desperately needed domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
But after four years of trade talks, there's little -- if any -- consensus. The 
United States, the European Community, Japan and others all need to get serious 
and compromise, especially on farm subsidies. Washington needs to adopt a more 
realistic approach to cuts in farm subsidies; the European Community must show 
some flexibility, and Japan and South Korea must be willing to modify their 
restrictions on rice imports. A new agreement could cover as many as 15 trade 
categories, including agriculture, investments, intellectual property rights 
and services. 
</P>
<P>
Trade is an increasingly important segment of the U.S. economy. Indeed, the big 
and continuing boom in exports has so far helped keep us out of a full-fledged 
recession. "The best opportunities for American companies and the American 
economy are going to be outside U.S. borders between now and 1995," explained 
Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Assn. of Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, the long-term economic benefits of revamping world trade get lost in the 
political rhetoric and maneuvering of the moment. Angry European farmers 
showing up by the thousands in their tractors to protest cuts in farm subsidies 
is powerful stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Liberalizing trade is sure to cause some hardships. Although new rules, if 
approved, will be phased in over a 10-year period, some industries may 
nevertheless encounter difficulties adjusting to the new realities. That is to 
be expected, but that's a small price to pay for opening up immense new 
economic opportunities worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
No pact means no trade dividends for anyone.

MARGARET THATCHER

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I found British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's "stern remarks" on the need 
for firm military action in the Persian Gulf very interesting. 
</P>
<P>
Her opening address to Parliament, reported on the day after our national 
elections, contrasts sharply with the political process in the U.S. in 
relationship to this potential conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Two things seem particularly relevant. First, the lives that will be lost in 
the battles she urges will not be English lives but the lives of young 
Americans. Secondly, how unfortunate that our own national elections should 
have been conducted without any single campaign addressing the issues of the 
Persian Gulf crisis and the respective roles of Congress and the presidency.

FUR TRADE IN CANADA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On behalf of the more than 1.2 million members of the Humane Society of the 
U.S., I would like to express my amazement over Mary Williams Walsh's article, 
"Canada's Fur Trade Feels Chill" (Column One, Nov. 6). 
</P>
<P>
To claim that the fur industry is the savior of Canada's Indians is fallacious. 
</P>
<P>
Native people respect the Earth and its animal inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
By making the killing of animals a commercial venture, as the fur industry has 
done, the sanctity of life is reduced to a monetary value, a complete reversal 
of the traditional beliefs of Indians. 
</P>
<P>
The fur industry is doing Canadian Indians a disservice by making them reliant 
on a market that is steadily declining. The reason for this decline in fur 
sales is simple. Knowledgeable consumers now have the facts about fur 
production andno longer sanction the killing of millions of animals each year 
for luxury fur garments. 
</P>
<P>
The answer to the problems faced by the Canadian Indians is an alternative 
economy, not a dependence on the whims of an already unstable fur market. What 
is truly shameless about this situation is that the fur industry is using the 
Indians' plight to create a misplaced sympathy to justify its existence in 
today's enlightened marketplace.

INITIATIVES AND ABSENTEE VOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am concerned about what I see as a possible abuse of the absentee ballot 
process. In the past it has been my understanding that absentee ballots were 
available as an option for those who could not get to their polling place to 
vote for reasons of health, business travel or military service. 
</P>
<P>
The impression I got in the last election was that absentee balloting was 
offered as an alternative to voting at one's assigned polling place in the 
event it was inconvenient or simply too much bother. This seems to be one more 
case of "getting out the vote" no matter what the degree of interest or 
understanding of the voter. 
</P>
<P>
I can't believe that the country is well served by the casual involvement of 
voters whose ignorance isn't even a source of concern to them.

INITIATIVES AND ABSENTEE VOTING

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the appalling number of non-voting registered voters, perhaps now is the 
time to consider mandating voting by absentee ballot. Would it not be easier 
for a citizen to mail a ballot than to rush to polls where long lines and time 
constraints often discourage voting? Elimination of polling sites and 
utilization of absentee ballots would permit voters more time, deliberation and 
review of all issues in the relaxed privacy of home, office or factory. 
</P>
<P>
Employees, renters and homeowners could be required to turn in an absentee 
ballot receipt or be docked a reasonable stipend from salary, rent or taxes. 
Proceeds could be forwarded to an established homeless trust fund. This would 
not be a poll tax, but rather a penalty for the right not to vote. 
</P>
<P>
In the light of all of America's wars, including the pending Desert Shield 
fracas, it makes no sense for Americans not to vote; the tactic of a penalty 
seems like a small payment indeed. The utilization of a mandated absentee 
ballot would preclude any and all non-voting excuses in today's fast-paced, 
consumer-driven society.

HEDGECOCK CASE ENDS WITH COMPROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After two trials, more than 6 1/2 years of litigation and what he termed "a 
lifetime or two . . . on an emotional roller coaster," former Mayor Roger 
Hedgecock's political corruption case ended abruptly Thursday with Hedgecock 
accepting his conviction on a single felony in return for no jail sentence and 
no retrial. 
</P>
<P>
In a carefully worded settlement crafted to permit face-saving on both sides, 
Hedgecock agreed not to appeal a felony conspiracy count stemming from illegal 
campaign contributions to his 1983 mayoral race. However, under terms 
negotiated with the San Diego County district attorney's office, that count 
will be reduced to a misdemeanor early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed before Superior Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez, 
Hedgecock will file for outright dismissal of the charge after his three-year 
probation period ends in about six weeks. In addition to not contesting that 
request, prosecutors also agreed not to retry Hedgecock on 12 felony perjury 
counts that he had been convicted of in 1985 but which were overturned by the 
state Supreme Court last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Hedgecock also agreed to pay a $5,000 fine -- five times higher than his 
original fine -- and accepted a one-day jail sentence, which he will not have 
to serve because of one day's credit being granted for his initial booking. 
</P>
<P>
Although both sides expressed satisfaction with Thursday's settlement, 
Hedgecock appeared to gain more from the unexpectedly quick finale to a case 
that he has often described as "the country's longest-running political soap 
opera." Until the agreement was reached, the case appeared headed for another 
protracted round of legal maneuvering next week, when Hedgecock's motion for a 
new trial -- a request based on allegations that a court bailiff tampered with 
his jury during its deliberations -- was scheduled to be heard. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement not only wiped out the one-year jail sentence to which Hedgecock 
had been sentenced after his October, 1985, conviction on 13 felony conspiracy 
and perjury counts, but also will ultimately remove the felony charge that 
could have cost him his law license and barred him from running for public 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Though Hedgecock, now a popular radio talk-show host, reiterated Thursday that 
he does not intend to either practice law or resume his public career, the 
former mayor stressed that the settlement will "finally clear the slate . . . 
and let me move on." 
</P>
<P>
Describing himself as having "mixed emotions" about the outcome, Hedgecock said 
that, although he is delighted to have the case behind him, he also was 
disappointed over not being vindicated either by being found innocent or via 
prosecutors' dismissal of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
"Justice was not done in this case, because I did not commit these crimes," 
Hedgecock said outside the courtroom. "As I said to the judge, I may have to 
accept some consequences here to compromise and put this behind us. But I did 
not commit these crimes, and I think that history will so judge." 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller, meanwhile, emphasized that the settlement enabled 
prosecutors to "salvage a conviction, a felony conviction . . . which is 
exceedingly important. It means that the acts upon which we based our 
prosecution have been confirmed." 
</P>
<P>
During the brief court proceeding, Rodriguez, referring to the lengthy, 
circuitous route the case has taken since prosecutors began investigating 
Hedgecock in early 1984, characterized the settlement as being fair "both to 
the parties . . . and the public." 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to end this case, put this case to rest here today," Rodriguez said. 
"To further continue with this case, we will have nothing but extensive and 
expensive criminal proceedings." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's settlement will have no direct effect on a civil lawsuit filed 
against Hedgecock by the state Fair Political Practices Commission. That 
lawsuit, which stemmed from many of the same charges at issue in Hedgecock's 
two felony trials, had been postponed pending resolution of Hedgecock's 
criminal case. However, Hedgecock said late Thursday that the case may "simply 
dry up and blow away" because a five-year statute of limitations has expired. 
</P>
<P>
After his first criminal case ended in a mistrial in February, 1985, Hedgecock 
was found guilty in his second trial eight months later of conspiring with two 
former principals of the now-defunct La Jolla investment firm of J. David &amp; 
Co. to funnel more than $350,000 in illegal donations to his 1983 mayoral 
campaign. The perjury counts alleged that Hedgecock intentionally falsified 
campaign and personal financial disclosure statements to conceal that aid. 
</P>
<P>
Days after Hedgecock's conviction, however, two jurors signed sworn affidavits 
alleging that a court bailiff had improperly discussed the case and their 
deliberations while they were sequestered in a local hotel. According to the 
two jurors -- whose claims were contradicted in part by statements from the 10 
other jurors -- the bailiff helped jurors define the legal term reasonable 
doubt, pressured them to reach a verdict quickly by reminding them of the cost 
of the hotel where they were staying and provided jurors with alcoholic 
beverages after their daily deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
In overturning all 12 perjury counts and setting aside the remaining conspiracy 
charge pending a hearing on the jury-tampering allegations, the state Supreme 
Court ruled that then-Superior Court Judge William L. Todd Jr. erred by ruling 
that omissions on Hedgecock's financial statements were sufficient -- or, in 
legal jargon, "material" enough -- to support the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Todd also made a mistake, the high court ruled, by not allowing a full-blown 
hearing on the jury-tampering charges, deciding the issue solely on the basis 
of the jurors' and bailiffs' written affidavits and the competing attorneys' 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
Now a justice on the 4th District Court of Appeal, Todd was recently asked to 
conduct the new trial hearing by Presiding Superior Court Judge Judith 
McConnell. Because Todd's own conduct and that of his bailiff were central 
issues in that proceeding, Hedgecock attorney Charles Sevilla questioned his 
ability to be impartial. 
</P>
<P>
Todd's assignment to the case, Hedgecock said, convinced him anew that he 
"could not get a fair trial in San Diego" -- a factor that prompted his 
attorney to begin settlement talks with prosecutors several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It became clear to me that the district attorney was not going to leave well 
enough alone," Hedgecock said. "He was determined to continue retrying this as 
many times as it took to try to nail me with something. After six years . . . I 
think we've made our point, and it was time to end this." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond trying to preserve -- albeit temporarily -- a felony conviction, Miller 
said that prosecutors' incentive in trying to reach a settlement lay primarily 
in ending a case "that's beginning to get barnacles on it." 
</P>
<P>
"The time had come for a compromise settlement, which it was," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Hedgecock case riveted public attention here throughout the 
mid-1980s, the passage of time, coupled with the repeated earlier failures to 
resolve it, caused interest in it to wane except among those whose lives were 
most directly touched by the compelling legal and political drama. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the only people who are still interested are those who were there," 
said lawyer Michael McDade, Hedgecock's former City Hall chief of staff and a 
key witness in both trials. "There is so much in-migration in San Diego that, 
when the subject comes up, people say, 'Who's Hedgecock? What's this all 
about.' A lot of people just don't remember it. I wonder what we would have 
testified to at another trial, it's been so long. It's just a relief to have it 
all finished." 
</P>
<P>
His own "exhausted relief . . . and gratification" with Thursday's court 
developments notwithstanding, Hedgecock remained firm in his belief that the 
prosecution had been from the first a vindictive political act. 
</P>
<P>
"The district attorney has used the criminal justice system in this case to 
prosecute a political opponent and to continue that prosecution until that 
political opponent was out of politics," Hedgecock said. "He did what he set 
out to do."

CHRONOLOGY OF THE LEGAL WOES OF FORMER MAYOR 
</P>
<P>
ROGER HEDGECOCK 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 9, 1984: The J. David &amp; Co. investment firm is sued by an investor who 
claims that the owner, J. David (Jerry) Dominelli failed to return a 
$1.2-million deposit. Hedgecock friend Nancy Hoover, who was Dominelli's 
business aide and girlfriend as well as a former mayor of Del Mar, provides the 
link for what prosecutors alleged was a conspiracy to illegally funnel 
thousands of dollars into Hedgecock's 1983 mayoral campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 27, 1984: The state's Fair Political Practices Commission, or FPPC, begins 
an investigation into Hedgecock's finances. 
</P>
<P>
April 9, 1984: The district attorney opens a criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
May 22, 1984: Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller files a civil suit against Hedgecock. 
</P>
<P>
June 5, 1984: Hedgecock wins the mayoral primary but is forced into a November 
runoff. 
</P>
<P>
June 30, 1984: The first grand jury to look into Hedgecock's finances is 
dismantled without returning an indictment. 
</P>
<P>
July 30, 1984: A second grand jury begins hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 19, 1984: The grand jury indicts Hedgecock, Hoover, Shepard and Dominelli 
on felony conspiracy and perjury charges. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 15, 1984: The FPPC files a $1.2-million suit against Hedgecock, Shepard, 
Hoover, Dominelli, and others, citing more than 450 violations of the city's 
campaign laws. The FPPC asks for nearly $1 million in penalties from Hedgecock 
alone. 
</P>
<P>

PLAYERS IN HEDGECOCK 'SOAP OPERA'

<P>
TOM SHEPARD 
</P>
<P>
In any list of the casualties of the scandal that brought down Roger Hedgecock, 
political consultant Tom Shepard must rank near the top. He eventually pleaded 
guilty to a misdemeanor charge that he conspired with Hedgecock and former J. 
David &amp; Co. principals J. David (Jerry) Dominelli and Nancy Hoover Hunter 
to use his firm to funnel illegal contributions to Hedgecock's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
He was ordered to pay a $1,000 fine, do 200 hours of community service and was 
placed on three years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
Shepard lost his business, his savings and, for a time, his reputation. He has 
bounced back and has a new, thriving political consulting business. 
</P>
<P>
NANCY HOOVER HUNTER 
</P>
<P>
Former live-in companion to J. David (Jerry) Dominelli. For her role in the 
Hedgecock affair, she pleaded guilty to one felony count, which was later 
reduced to a misdemeanor. She was fined $10,000, ordered to complete 350 hours 
of community service and placed on probation for three years. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of her role in the $80-million scam by the J. David &amp; Co., 
Hoover Hunter was either convicted or pleaded guilty to several felony fraud 
and tax evasion counts. She is in federal prison serving a 10-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
JERRY DOMINELLI 
</P>
<P>
The swindler pleaded guilty in March, 1985, to four felony counts of fraud and 
tax evasion stemming from the February, 1984, collapse of his J. David &amp; 
Co. investment firm, based in La Jolla. After admitting he had bilked investors 
of more than $80 million, Dominelli was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison 
and ordered to pay more than $2 million in back taxes. 
</P>
<P>
He suffered a stroke while in jail in San Diego in 1984 which left him partly 
paralyzed and severely impaired his ability to speak. 
</P>
<P>
WILLIAM L. TODD JR. 
</P>
<P>
As a Superior Court judge, Todd presided over Hedgecock's two felony trials. 
Hedgecock accused Todd of being biased against him and twice asked that he step 
down. In sentencing Hedgecock in 1985, Todd bluntly said he believed the former 
mayor was guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Todd was elevated to the 4th District Court of Appeal in 1986, but since last 
summer has been serving on special assignment to help relieve the San Diego 
Superior Court's backlog. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Todd was picked to preside over a hearing scheduled for next week 
that had been ordered by the state Supreme Court to determine whether Hedgecock 
deserved a new trial. The court had found that Todd erred in some aspects of 
the case. Hedgecock's attorney said he intended to challenge Todd's selection.

FOR MANY IN SAN DIEGO, A CLOUD IS NOW LIFTED

"People trust me more when I'm not in office." 
</P>
<P>
So said Roger Hedgecock on Thursday, moments after he agreed to settle his 
campaign-laundering case, leaving him with a felony conspiracy conviction and a 
$5,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the felony will be reduced to a misdemeanor, and then probably 
dismissed altogether, the former mayor was as adamant about never again seeking 
political office as he was about his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Hedgecock said, he will push his political agenda through the 
microphone of his popular radio talk show. Those who know Hedgecock said they 
believe him when he says he won't run again, even though some believe he could 
be a viable candidate. Others say his politics are outdated. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, reaction to Thursday's settlement was one of relief, that a long legal 
and political battle has ended, both for Hedgecock and the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad that this is over . . . this should get rid of the cloud over San 
Diego," said Robert Meadow, a former political consultant who was granted 
immunity from prosecution in the case in return for his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Meadow, now a political pollster with a wide-ranging clientele, was named as an 
unindicted co-conspirator by the county grand jury. "It was my perspective all 
along that there was nothing particularly unusual about these activities," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Meadow believes Hedgecock no longer would be a viable political 
candidate -- not because of Hedgecock's legal problems but because his politics 
have changed. 
</P>
<P>
Time has dulled the gloss of being "an environmental Republican," part of the 
Hedgecock cache a decade ago, and Hedgecock the radio talk show host is much 
more conservative than he was in office, Meadow said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's actually a little out of touch," Meadow said, noting 
confrontational crusades Hedgecock has launched on the airwaves, such as Light 
Up the Border. 
</P>
<P>
"He is not the same Roger Hedgecock who was elected mayor of all San Diego," 
said Meadow, using an old Hedgecock campaign slogan. 
</P>
<P>
Others said the end of the criminal case against Hedgecock puts to rest a 
volatile chapter in the city's history in which every page seemed to have a 
corruption case with characters such as former Councilman Uvaldo Martinez, 
Nancy Hoover Hunter, J. David (Jerry) Dominelli and Richard Silberman. 
</P>
<P>
David Lewis, a veteran political consultant, said, "I believe him when he says 
he's out of this (politics) forever." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Hedgecock has built himself a loyal following through his 
radio show, and, in the absence of strong leadership at City Hall, he could be 
a political contender again, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
"If Roger comes back in six months and says" he really is innocent and agreed 
to the settlement to get on with his life, then "if you like Roger, you are 
going to believe that. If not, you weren't going to vote for him anyway," Lewis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One person who can identify with what happened to Hedgecock on Thursday is Tom 
Shepard, founder of Shepard &amp; Associates, the now-defunct firm at the 
center of the money-laundering case. 
</P>
<P>
Shepard eventually pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge that he conspired 
with Hedgecock and former J. David &amp; Co. principals Dominelli and Nancy 
Hoover Hunter to use his firm to funnel illegal contributions to Hedgecock's 
campaign. His guilty plea, he said a few years ago, arose primarily from "my 
need to put this behind me," not a sense of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Shepard said, "I know what it feels like to face the infinite 
resources of the D.A.'s office. I fully empathize with his decision to cut a 
deal." 
</P>
<P>
Shepard, who rebuilt his consulting business and is now thriving, said his 
internal polling and survey information show that Hedgecock remains "one of the 
most trusted public figures in San Diego." What Thursday's settlement does to 
that, Shepard can only guess. 
</P>
<P>
"What impact pleading guilty would do to this and (what the) certain dislike 
the Copley Press has for him" would do to a possible candidacy is hard to 
gauge, said Shepard, who has not spoken to Hedgecock since his own guilty plea 
in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Among those taking a harder line was Michael Aguirre, a lawyer who 
unsuccessfully ran for City Council and represented Latinos and blacks in a 
class-action Voting Rights Act lawsuit against the city. 
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said that, despite what Hedgecock may say about his innocence, "people 
should recognize that Roger did plead guilty to a crime. . . . The fact is he 
did something wrong and (through the settlement) he has acknowledged he did 
something wrong. He is someone who violated the law." 
</P>
<P>
Hedgecock's insistence that he did nothing wrong makes him both a hypocrite and 
a demagogue, Aguirre said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's using his position on radio as a demagogue. On the same day he pleads 
guilty and admits what he did, he maintains he is innocent," Aguirre said. "You 
can't have it both ways. Either what he told the court (in admitting to the 
felony conviction) is not the truth or what he's saying (about his innocence) 
is not the truth."

THURSTON ROSS; PROPERTY APPRAISER AND ECONOMIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thurston H. Ross., a real estate appraiser and economist who flew for the 
Signal Corps during World War I and served as a strategist for the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff during World War II, died Sunday in Battle Ground, Wash., where he was 
living with his son. 
</P>
<P>
The pioneer teacher, expert witness and government and commercial property 
appraiser was 96. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Indiana, he earned undergraduate degrees at Otterbein College in Ohio 
in 1917 and then enlisted in the Army Signal Corps, where he learned to fly, an 
avocation he pursued through much of his life. 
</P>
<P>
He came to Los Angeles after the war, earned master's and doctorate degrees at 
USC and also taught there. In 1927 he established USC's first course in real 
estate appraisal and wrote extensively on the subject for the rest of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
He had first started his appraisal business in Los Angeles in 1921 and grew up 
with the city, recalling over the years how some downtown properties in that 
era had as many as a dozen mortgage-holders. 
</P>
<P>
At USC, Ross had achieved a partial integration of the Colleges of Commerce and 
Engineering and had become knowledgeable about the burgeoning ship and aircraft 
industries of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Partially as a result of that experience, he was asked to join the Navy at the 
outset of World War II and became a lieutenant commander assigned to the Chief 
of Naval Operations in Washington. He became a member of the Joint Military 
Transportation Committee and the Combined Military Transportation Committee and 
attended the conferences of world leaders at Yalta, Tehran, Cairo and Malta as 
well as those between Gen. Douglas MacArthur and Lord Mountbatten in the 
India-Burma theater. 
</P>
<P>
At war's end he returned to teaching and his appraisal business, and in 1948 
began what was to become a four-decade relationship as a director for Home 
Savings and Loan Assn., then a relatively small institution but now the largest 
in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
He continued to appraise properties for institutions as diverse as the state of 
California, the city of Beverly Hills, supermarkets and malls, the New York 
Life Insurance Co. and the Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
Among his many honors was the Louise and Y. T. Lum Award from the California 
Real Estate Assn. for distinguished service. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his son, Thurston Jr., three grandchildren and three 
great-grandchildren 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service will be held Tuesday at 12:30 p.m. at Forest Lawn Memorial 
Park, Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
In lieu of flowers, contributions are asked in his name to the American Society 
of Real Estate Counselors, 430 N. Michigan Ave., Chicago 60611.

SOCKERS' DEFENSE MISSING IN 5-4 LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Maybe the Sockers should play all of their games on the road. 
</P>
<P>
They have lost all three of their games in the Sports Arena this season, 
despite winning three of five away games. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night's malady was a defensive breakdown early in the third quarter 
that led to a 5-4 overtime victory for the Baltimore Blast before 4,490, the 
third-smallest crowd for a soccer game at the Sports Arena, and the smallest 
since Dec. 2, 1982 (4,672). 
</P>
<P>
"This is the thing," said Sockers Coach Ron Newman. "When we're on the road, 
we're ready to do battle, but at home . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Newman paused, then said, "Baltimore had rookie players beating us to the ball 
on the boards and banging it into the middle. They beat us on every 50-50 ball 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
And Mike Stankovic beat everyone to a Waad Hirmez rebound five minutes into 
overtime to start the play that led to victory. He dribbled downfield on a 
three-on-one break before passing off to Billy Ronson, who shot it past goalie 
Victor Nogueira. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Blast who had to force overtime by going to a sixth attacker late in 
the fourth quarter. Dominick Mobilio ran on to Stankovic's rebound in the goal 
box and hit it into an unguarded net with 36 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
It was Mobilio's second goal of the game and it wiped out a second Sockers' 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers spent the fourth quarter using a deft passing game to forge a 4-3 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the quarter, Ben Collins threaded a pass from midfield to a 
streaking Paul Wright along the right boards in his attacking third. Wright was 
marked tightly by Stankovic, but Collins' pass still made its way to Wright. 
Wright immediately fired a shot that beat Baltimore goalie Hank Henry to the 
far post, tying the score 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
Three minutes later, Brian Quinn fooled two Baltimore defenders by faking a 
shot from just outside the penalty area, then put a pass by Hirmez at the left 
post. Hirmez tapped it in for a 4-3 lead that lasted until Mobilio put the game 
into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the third quarter that did in the Sockers. 
</P>
<P>
It was as if the Sockers decided they didn't need to get anyone back on 
defense, what with Nogueira looking invincible by making 11 saves and shutting 
out the Blast in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
So in a span of two minutes three seconds the Blast scored three times to erase 
a two-goal Sockers lead. 
</P>
<P>
First, Baltimore forward Dominick Mobilio slipped behind defender Alex Golovnia 
and took a pass from Angelo Panzetta, who had sent the ball into the penalty 
area from the midfield stripe. Mobilio turned on the pass and sliced it by 
Nogueira. 
</P>
<P>
Next, Chris Haywood stepped into the middle of the goal box unmarked and took a 
centering pass from Mark Mettrick. He redirected it into an open net. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Sockers did get someone back on defense, Michael Collins, who was 
marking Tim Wittman as Wittman made a run in front of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it would have been better were no Socker came back on defense. Collins 
got to Dale Mitchell's centering pass before Wittman, but he inadvertently 
knocked it between the left post and Nogueira. 
</P>
<P>
So much for a 2-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers' first goal came 1:18 into the second quarter when Wright, just 
outside the right corner of the penalty area, first-timed a pass from Ben 
Collins and beat Henry on the left side. 
</P>
<P>
The play started when Baltimore's Mike Reynolds, guarding the near post on a 
corner kick, headed the ball clear of the box, but right to Collins. 
</P>
<P>
The goal atoned for Wright's inability to get off a shot on a shootout attempt, 
which came earlier in the quarter, within the allotted five seconds. The 
shootout was awarded when Wright was tackled from behind by Angelo Panzetta, 
who went off for two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
With the goal, Wright made it five consecutive games in which he has scored at 
least a point. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the half, the Sockers were awarded their second shootout of the game 
when Mitchell reached up and deflected a Hirmez shot with his hands. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Gabarra took it dribbled twice and sneaked a shot under the on-charging 
Henry to become only the second Socker to score a shootout goal. Branko Segota 
has the other five. 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Neither team managed a shot until 10 minutes 57 seconds had elapsed, then 
Baltimore's Dale Mitchell fired from just inside the red line. . . . Thursday's 
game marked the 10th anniversary of the Sockers' first indoor game, a 6-4 loss 
at Tulsa Nov. 15, 1980. Coach Ron Newman is the only member of that team still 
with the club. . . . The league announced that Kansas City's' Ted Eck and St. 
Louis' Fernando Clavijo will join the U.S. national team this week as it 
prepares for games against its old nemesis, Trinidad and Tobago. "We are most 
pleased that our players will be given an opportunity to represent their 
country," said Earl Foreman, MSL commissioner. Well, sort of. Clavijo is a 
native of Uruguay.

CHARGERS: BUTTS HAS BROUGHT BACK DOWN-AND-DIRTY FOOTBALL WITH HIS BRUISING 
STYLE.

Marion Butts turns his shoulder pads up the field and is running right at you. 
</P>
<P>
That's 248 determined pounds with the motor revving, and it's your job to stop 
the Chargers' starting running back. 
</P>
<P>
"Me, I'd make that quick athletic move, and get out of the way," Charger 
defensive end Burt Grossman said. "Then I'd act like I read the play wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Join the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"Marion's job is to punish guys," running back Darrin Nelson said. "If you look 
at most of our games, especially late in the third quarter or early in the 
fourth, you'll see those safeties are not rushing up there to hit him anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"They're kind of hanging back waiting to see what's going to happen. They're 
not wanting to hit him, and to tell you the truth, I don't blame them." 
</P>
<P>
To stop a player such as Butts, safety Martin Bayless said, you have to be 
willing to be carried from the field. 
</P>
<P>
"Human nature will tell you, you don't want to tackle this guy when he's got a 
full head of steam," Coach Dan Henning said. "You might not want to even admit 
it, but subconsciously you'd like to see him run by so you can catch him from 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
"That's Butts' real message to everybody: I'm going to stop somewhere, but it 
isn't going to be any wimp who stops me." 
</P>
<P>
No fancy footwork. Butts has charged forward for 827 yards this season to lead 
the NFL in rushing. Try and tackle him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad I'm on his side," Bayless said. 
</P>
<P>
Those who are on his side, however, know better than to get in his way. 
</P>
<P>
"You're blocking and you know he's back there and you're pumping your legs as 
hard as you can to get out of his way," Chargers' left guard Courtney Hall 
said. "When he runs into you, oh man, it's terrible. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to come off the field for a couple of plays. But you go back into the 
huddle and then you hear they're going to run the same play again." 
</P>
<P>
The big guys get you whether they're coming or going. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see one of these big guys break free there are a myriad of things 
that go through your mind," 198-pound cornerback Gill Byrd said. "Should I 
tackle him high? Should I tackle him low? Should I get out of his way? Where's 
my help? What's going on here? 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to get the worst of that collision; it's like you're both going 
50 m.p.h. and it's this diesel truck colliding with a Volkswagen . . . you know 
it's going to hurt." 
</P>
<P>
In last week's 19-7 victory over the Denver Broncos, Butts got away clean from 
the line of scrimmage in the fourth quarter on his way to gaining 23 yards. The 
only thing between him and the goal line was Denver 200-pound strong safety 
Dennis Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"Dennis Smith is known as an intimidator and an enforcer," linebacker Gary 
Plummer said. "But I think he was intimidated on that particular play." 
</P>
<P>
As Butts approached Smith in the open field, the safety appeared to be 
considering retirement. He wheezed left, and then right, but there was no 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked weird," Butts recalled. "It was like he was out of control." 
</P>
<P>
Now maybe if this were Ronnie Harmon or Nelson, Smith would have gone high and 
hard with the heavy hit. But when it became clear that Butts was a runaway 
mountain, Smith took a dive for the bruiser's ankles. 
</P>
<P>
"Form tackling went out with steroids," Grossman said. "You see a big guy turn 
your way, and you dive for those ankles or knees or shoestrings. That way you 
never get run over. Of course, the running backs lean forward for an extra yard 
or two, but hey, I'm happy and healthy." 
</P>
<P>
When Smith went low on Butts, it looked as if he was being trampled by a herd 
of cattle. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like Dennis was coming loose at the joints," tackle Broderick 
Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
Butts' thigh hit Smith in the helmet, and then his foot struck his gut, and 
then his leg, and finally his whole body went rolling on top of Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked our defensive backs why everyone tries to tackle me low," Butts said. 
"And they say it's because they wanna keep playing. They say they don't want 
their career to end, so they aren't going to hit a big guy like me high." 
</P>
<P>
Smith went low, as low as he could go, but as Bayless said, "Dennis didn't look 
like he was doing too well after that tackle." 
</P>
<P>
The big backs will do that. They will punish, they will pound, they will hurt. 
And an aspirin, please, it seems as if there are more of them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's come about because there are more and more guys Marion's size that can 
run 4.5 40s," linebacker Billy Ray Smith said. "Before you got a big guy like 
Pete Johnson and Pete Johnson's good for maybe a 5.5 40. 
</P>
<P>
"If a big guy is going to get to the hole just as fast as a 190-pounder, he's 
going to get there with a little more authority and momentum. Where a smaller 
guy might get knocked back, this guy at least is going to go forward for two or 
three yards on a stopped play." 
</P>
<P>
In Kansas City the Chiefs are riding the back of 260-pound Christian Okoye. In 
New Orleans the Saints have hopped aboard 260-pound Craig (Ironhead) Heyward. 
The Pittsburgh Steelers have pushed forward with 230-pound Merril Hoge. A 
232-pound Gerald Riggs is still running for the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in the old days everybody had a big back," Henning said. "You see, what 
Joe Montana does and what they do in San Francisco is a mirage. That's one guy, 
one group, and one system that has been together, and they do it as well as 
anybody has ever done it in history. But you're fooling yourself if you think 
you can do the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Defenses are gearing up to stop that type of thing. In my time in the league, 
which stretches over 25 years, I've seen more different schemes, looks and 
thought processes going on. In order to settle all that down, there's only one 
thing that does it, and that's run the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"Knock people off the ball so they can't be jumping around and putting 
different people in. They have to anchor up and start playing football." 
</P>
<P>
Playing football for Henning is running the football, and running the football, 
and running the football. And then run it again. 
</P>
<P>
Riggs ran the ball 397 times in 1985 for Henning's Atlanta Falcons and that 
mark still rests in the NFL record books as the third-most rushing attempts in 
history. Henning was coach in Atlanta for four years, and each season he had a 
back run for more than 1,000 yards. 
</P>
<P>
He was in Miami when Larry Csonka surpassed a 1,000 yards for the Dolphins. And 
he was with Washington when John Riggins averaged 152 yards in four playoff 
games, including a 27-17 Super Bowl XVII victory over Miami in which Riggins 
ran 38 times for 166 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have a guy who is durable, and you have to have a guy who has some 
pizazz because the other team will try to intimidate the ballcarrier," Henning 
said. "If that guy can't take it, then the opposition gets an impression of 
your team through that guy. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where John Riggins was tremendous. John was an intimidator, not the 
intimidatee. John could get the team's level of play far and above any 
quarterback I've ever been around. He could get the other players around him 
playing down-and-dirty football." 
</P>
<P>
Without planning it or even knowing it, Butts has accomplished the same thing. 
He's made dirty uniforms fashionable. He has the offensive line blasting folks 
off the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
"He gives that offense of ours a personality," Henning said. "You can't 
intimidate him. He doesn't know what the word is." 
</P>
<P>
And as his teammates will tell you, the opposition doesn't even try to talk 
trash with him. "They are all too dazed from trying to tackle him," guard David 
Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
No, the only way to knock Butts for a loop is to praise him. Remind him of the 
fantasy he appears to be living, and you will get 248 bashful and embarrassed 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Fame is man-made, and it's something you fantasize about, but it's short 
term," he said. "A lot of people get carried away when they get it, but I'm the 
same old guy. Come on, without that offensive line I wouldn't exist. I'm just 
trying to get my job done. Nothing out of the ordinary." 
</P>
<P>
From the outset, however, Butts has been extraordinary. He was a seventh-round 
draft choice from Florida State, where he carried the ball 64 times in two 
years. He was supposed to play special teams for the Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
"He's fortunate because Gary Anderson never showed up," Henning said. "He fell 
into something here that was out of necessity. It's like that for anybody, when 
preparation meets opportunity, only this guy's got it in spades. Nobody 
prepares or gives himself more of a chance than Buttsy. 
</P>
<P>
"He runs hard every damn day. He's been here 18 months and he's never taken a 
slow step on the practice field unless we've had to pull him back. This is a 
man with strong values . . . He can't always communicate it well, but you can 
see there's character and substance there." 
</P>
<P>
And you can't help but be in awe of the physical talent. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy has what a lot of big guys don't have," Henning said. "Some guys can 
bring it, but with no thrust. Power comes from mass times rate. If a guy can 
increase his rate he'll tremendously improve his power and thrust. 
</P>
<P>
"Buttsy sees a hole, and wheeeew, he can explode off either the right or the 
left leg. When he hits it, he's going with such a load, that a lot of times 
even when things aren't blocked cleanly, there's still no stopping him." 
</P>
<P>
On Butts' third carry in the NFL, he ran for a 50-yard touchdown against the 
Raiders. In last year's game against Kansas City, he beat up the Chiefs for 176 
yards in a club-record 39 carries. 
</P>
<P>
This season he has averaged 4.7 yards a carry even though everybody in the 
stadium knows he's getting the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think when he runs and hits people he looks at it as punishment," 
Henning said. "I think he looks at what he deals out, like if I don't do this, 
I won't be respected. I think this is what he was told as a kid: work hard, do 
your best every time out, and that's what people will respect." 
</P>
<P>
Straight forward -- just like he runs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just a quiet, peaceful runner," he said, "who tries to get the job done."

SEAU INJURES GROIN IN DRILLS

<P>
Starting linebacker Junior Seau, who was getting additional work on his 
pass-rushing technique with the Chargers' scout team, suffered a pulled groin 
muscle in Thursday's practice. 
</P>
<P>
Seau, who was limping noticeably as he walked off the field, said later he 
would be examined by a team physician. 
</P>
<P>
"It can last for six weeks, it can last for two or for one," Seau said. "We're 
going to have to look at it carefully so the whole year won't be affected by 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"Not playing because you're not playing good is one thing, but not playing 
because of this little piddling groin pull is another. It's just so 
frustrating. There's things that need to be done, and I know it, and with this 
in the way it's just another obstacle to overcome." 
</P>
<P>
Seau had gone through defensive practice drills before his injury. If the 
injury affects his playing time Sunday against the Kansas City Chiefs, 
linebacker coach Mike Haluchak said Cedric Figaro will replace him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to have some depth, but I think Junior will be fine," Haluchak said. 
"It's just a day-to-day thing." 
</P>
<P>
Tight end Rod Bernstine, who alternates with Marion Butts as the Chargers' 
primary ballcarrier, said he's still unable "to burst" on his injured 
hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't run full speed," Bernstine said, "but we still have a few days left." 
</P>
<P>
Bernstine missed last week's game with the Denver Broncos and remains 
questionable for the Chiefs. Coach Dan Henning, however, said it looks as if 
the team might be able to get some work out of him Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Butts has carried the ball 175 times this season without fumbling and has not 
lost the ball since last year's visit to Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
"We work on it a lot," he said. "The coach really pressures us to keep from 
fumbling. You fumble and you're throwing away your paychecks." T.J. SIMERS

Padre reliever John Davis, after being notified that he'll be left off the 
40-man roster, signed a one-year contract with the Atlanta Braves, according to 
his agent, Dennis Gilbert. Davis was 0-1 with a 5.79 earned-run average in six 
appearances with the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
In other news, Denny Sommers accepted the Padres' offer to be the club's 
advance scout. He had been the bullpen coach the past three years before being 
demoted a week ago. Also, Jack Maloof, formerly the Padres' hitting coach, 
decided to stay in the organization as the double-A hitting coach at Wichita.

<P>
Two of the more prominent members of the 31 front-office employees and coaches 
who were fired by the Padres have obtained jobs. Dick Hager, formerly the 
advance scout, was hired in the same capacity with the Houston Astros. Harry 
Dunlop, formerly director of minor league instruction, was hired on the 
Milwaukee Brewers' minor league staff. BOB NIGHTENGALE

Ray Sheppard, trying to play his way into the lineup, scored twice to support 
Mike Richter's strong game in goal as the New York Rangers beat the Minnesota 
North Stars, 4-2, at Bloomington, Minn., Thursday night to take over the points 
lead in the NHL with 30. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Rangers have 23 healthy players but can dress only 20 for games, 
Coach Roger Neilson can't play three men per night. 
</P>
<P>
Sheppard has been one of the odd men out four times, including Tuesday night at 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Richter made 14 of his 33 saves in the first period for the Rangers, who are 
3-0-2 in their past five games. 
</P>
<P>
New York Islanders 4, Calgary 3 -- Brent Sutter scored on a power play with 42 
seconds remaining in overtime for the Islanders' first victory in Calgary's 
Olympic Saddledome. 
</P>
<P>
The Islanders had been 0-8-2 at the Saddledome since it opened in 1983. Their 
last victory in Calgary was a 6-4 victory at the Stampede Corral in October, 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 4, Montreal 1 -- Rick Tocchet and Murray Craven each had a goal 
and an assist to lead the Flyers past the Canadiens at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal's Brian Skrudland gave the Canadiens their only goal with 10 seconds 
left in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 6, Quebec 0 -- Dave Christian scored twice in a three-goal first period 
and Reggie Lemelin recored his 12th career shutout at Boston as the Bruins 
handed the Nordiques a club-record 12th consecutive defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 4, New Jersey 2 -- Rookie goaltender Daryl Reaugh made 29 saves and 
Paul Cyr scored two goals to lead the Whalers at East Rutherford, N.J.

<P>
The Denver Nuggets, whose racehorse style had produced nothing but defeats in 
their seven starts, were reduced to a more normal game by the ball-control 
Minnesota Timberwolves on Thursday night and came away with their first victory 
of the season, 121-108. 
</P>
<P>
The Timberwolves are 0-6 in Denver in their two seasons in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
The Nuggets, who averaged 137 points in their 0-7 start and yielded 153 a game, 
wanted to run but the Timberwolves' slowdown style did not permit it. It turned 
out to be a help as the Nuggets hit 54.5% to 41.1 for Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't place any added significance on this game," Denver Coach Paul 
Westhead said. "We tried to press and trap as much as we could, but if a team 
doesn't want to shoot the ball, there is not much you can do to speed it up." 
</P>
<P>
Orlando Woolridge hit 11 of 16 shots and led the Nuggets with 25 points, Todd 
Lichti had 21 and Walter Davis 20. Corey Gaines had 16 assists in directing the 
Denver offense. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota had four players with 20 or more, topped by Tyrone Corbin and Tony 
Campbell with 24 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio 122, Sacramento 93 -- With Denver's victory, there is only one 
winless team in the NBA. Terry Cummings scored 22 points and Sean Elliott had 
19 at Sacramento as the Kings dropped to 0-6, the second-worst start in 
franchise history. The Kings lost their first seven games in 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 141, New York 125 -- Clyde Drexler scored 13 of his 31 points in a 
42-point first quarter as the Trail Blazers (7-0) remained the NBA's only 
unbeaten team. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 103, Chicago 93 -- Michael Jordan took only 12 shots at Oakland 
and scored 14 points. Golden State's Chris Mullin scored 30 and Tim Hardaway 
had 23 as the Warriors earned their fourth victory in a row. Their 6-2 record 
is their best since the 1977-78 season. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan had been averaging 29.3 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando 102, Utah 99 -- Sam Vincent scored four of his 21 points in overtime as 
the Magic won its second game in a row at home after 16 consecutive losses 
there.

MIRA COSTA DEFEATS EL TORO TO REACH 5-A VOLLEYBALL FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
The Mira Costa mystique claimed another victim Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Rallying from a game down, the Mustangs recorded their second consecutive upset 
in the CIF-Southern Section 5-A girls' volleyball playoffs by defeating 
second-seeded El Toro, 16-14, 13-15, 10-15, 15-8, 15-6, in the semifinals at El 
Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
Even Coach Dae Lea Aldrich appeared startled by the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just in shock," she said, holding her hand to her forehead. "It's not that 
I don't believe in them, but they're just so young." 
</P>
<P>
Aldrich was referring to her players, who have overcome inexperience and youth 
to send Mira Costa into the CIF final for the third consecutive season and the 
seventh time in nine years under Aldrich. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs (20-1) will face top-seeded Corona del Mar (23-1) at 8:15 p.m. 
Saturday at Cerritos College seeking their second consecutive 5-A title. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sitting in awe," Aldrich said. "It was so exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Outside hitter Cindy DeGarceau led Mira Costa with 22 kills, followed by 
sophomore middle blocker Tate Medley with 11 and junior hitter Shannon Parke 
with five. Setter Robin Ortgiesen had 38 assists and sophomore hitter Ann 
Windes contributed five blocks. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro (18-4) had taken control of the match by winning the third game, but 
the Chargers appeared to run out of gas late in the match as Mira Costa gained 
momentum. 
</P>
<P>
Aldrich said a turning point occurred late in the fourth game when Michelle 
Mauney, El Toro's standout 6-foot-3 middle blocker, appeared to tire. Mauney 
sat out a good portion of the deciding fifth game. 
</P>
<P>
"(Mauney) started tipping instead of hitting in the fourth game," Aldrich said. 
"I told my team that was our chance because she was getting tired." 
</P>
<P>
After El Toro took a 6-5 lead in the fifth game, Mira Costa closed out the 
match with 10 unanswered points. DeGarceau, Medley and Parke each scored two 
points during the run.

GRANADA HILLS' DERRICK STEWART SERVES AS TUNEFUL CAMPUS DJ WHEN NOT ROCKING 
OPPONENTS FROM HIS STRONG SAFETY POSITION 
</P>

<P>
Derrick Stewart, man, can that kid play. Prefer fast, slow or in-between? 
Stewart, a two-way football player at Granada Hills High, has more speeds than 
a Waring blender in his unofficial capacity as the school's mixmaster. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe you've heard about his act, or if you live within the same ZIP code as 
the campus, perhaps you just heard it. Student reaction speaks volumes about 
his ability. 
</P>
<P>
"He absolutely played everything, from the slow stuff that everybody likes, to 
rap, to Top 40, to hip-hop," teammate Tom Moormeister said. "He's really in 
tune with what's going on. He had 'em moving." 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Stewart is a hindrance riding the airwaves from his safety position on 
Friday nights. Yet in his spare time, as he did twice last season at school 
dances, Stewart is a deejay, the Highlanders' DB of decibel. The Hills are 
alive with the sound of music. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a good dancer, but I can make people dance," said Stewart, a 
5-foot-11, 180-pound senior. "I'm pretty shy, so I don't like talking much. I 
just play the records." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who travels with his own stereo gear, breaks out tunes at private 
parties and dances and even has business cards embossed with the name of his 
musical alter ego, "D. J. Smeck." 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a name I made up for myself," he said, smiling. "Just kind of a 
stage name." 
</P>
<P>
Under the Friday night lights, when Stewart takes center stage on the football 
field, the sounds are considerably less harmonic. Like a table saw, a dental 
drill or a trash compactor. 
</P>
<P>
Anybody for D.B. Smack? 
</P>
<P>
One of Stewart's greatest hits: Earlier this season, Stewart sprinted downfield 
as part of the punt coverage team and zeroed in on the return man. Player and 
ball instantly parted. Ditto the return man's hair. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy should have caught the ball, because he ended up paying the price 
anyway," said Granada Hills assistant Steve Benjamin, a former Canadian 
Football League cornerback who coaches the Highlander secondary. "I still 
remember it vividly." 
</P>
<P>
It was hardly an isolated incident. In each of Stewart's three years as a 
starter in the secondary, Granada Hills has won or shared a league title. In 
that span, the Highlanders have recorded 11 shutouts in 31 games and 19 times 
have held the opposition to less than 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills (8-1, 6-0 in league play) can clinch the West Valley League 
championship outright with a victory over visiting Chatsworth in a game that 
starts at 8 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart's aggressiveness has won over the toughest of coaches, such as 
Highlander co-Coach Darryl Stroh. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to call time, run out there, call him names and yell and scream at him 
for lining up in the wrong place," said Stroh, who coaches the defense. "But 
he's so hyper that I finally figured out that I had to lay off. 
</P>
<P>
"I let him bang around a while, and he gets it together on his own." 
</P>
<P>
In this get-together, Stewart supplies his own percussion. His melody of mayhem 
has earned him the unbridled respect of coaches throughout the Northwest Valley 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Said Taft's Tom Stevenson: "He might be the best player in the conference." 
</P>
<P>
Said San Fernando's Tom Hernandez: "He's a great defensive player, he's all 
over the field." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart plays the strong safety position, nicknamed "Bandit." It is Stroh's 
terminology, which in short, means termination for anybody Stewart comes in 
contact with. 
</P>
<P>
"They call him a Bandit, but we call him a good solid player," El Camino Real 
co-Coach Mike Maio said. "Some call it a rover defense, or a wolfman, a bandit 
or whatever. It's a privilege to play that position because it goes to the best 
kid on the team." 
</P>
<P>
Playing the Bandit position allows Stewart free rein to blitz the passer, 
smother the run or drop into pass coverage. Last season, his first as the 
Bandit, he led the team in tackles and was an All-City Section and Times 
All-Valley selection. 
</P>
<P>
He is second in combined tackles (90) this season to inside linebacker Curt 
Hulshizer. 
</P>
<P>
"I like tackling and sacking quarterbacks, so I really like it," said Stewart 
of the position. "I play the pass, the run, and they send me in on a lot of 
plays. You never know what I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
Truth be told, Stewart desperately wanted to do something else -- play 
tailback. He first mentioned it to friends two seasons ago when, as a 
sophomore, he was starting at free safety. But he didn't mention it to the 
coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
"It's news to me," co-Coach Tom Harp said before the season. "If he did (want 
to play there), he never said anything to me about it." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart finally was installed as a starter at tailback this season. He has 
rushed for only 277 yards and scored six rushing touchdowns, serving primarily 
as a caddy to fullback Brett Washington, the conference's leading ballcarrier. 
Stewart also has five catches for a 38.4 average and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Not only is Stewart the fastest player in school -- his best time in the 100 
meters is 10.9 seconds -- but he also ranks among the strongest. Stewart 
bench-presses 325 pounds. Only Rob Kalinowski, a 220-pound defensive end who 
bench-presses 350 pounds, is believed stronger. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart is also worth his weight in devotion. "I remember during Hell Week, 
we'd finish up at practice and Derrick would come over here and work out for 
another 2 1/2 hours," said Moormeister, who has a gym at his house. "Nobody 
works harder, nobody." 
</P>
<P>
Washington (6-0, 220) and Stewart were a package deal. Both are bused to 
Granada Hills from Los Angeles and both attended Nobel Junior High in 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, in the ninth grade, the pair considered playing at Dorsey High until that 
fateful night when Stewart flicked on the television. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw them on the news, when they beat Carson," Stewart said, referring to the 
Highlanders' 1987 upset of the Colts in the City 4-A final. "I said to myself, 
'Now that's a good school, and it's not too far from Nobel.' So we decided to 
get our paperwork together and went to Granada." 
</P>
<P>
Some don't want him to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, you really don't appreciate these kids until they're gone, because 
they're better kids than they are players," Stroh said. "Sometimes, you have a 
kid like Derrick for three years and you don't realize how much he meant to you 
until he graduates." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said he never expected to be tabbed as the Nobel prize. 
</P>
<P>
"It's turned out real good," Stewart said. "I can't believe the success of the 
team and myself. I never expected this kind of recognition. It's been 
unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Not so, says Benjamin, and the logjam of Division I coaches in pursuit of 
Stewart would agree. Once Stewart scores the NCAA-required 700 on the 
Scholastic Aptitude Test -- he is scheduled to retake the exam in December -- 
the checklist will be complete. 
</P>
<P>
"He has it all: Speed, size, quickness, instinct and desire," Benjamin said. "I 
don't like to tell kids that they have a chance to make it in the pros because 
it distracts them from their academics. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm saying it -- he definitely has a chance." 
</P>

COLLEGE BASKETBALL PREVIEW;

<P>
MASTER'S, CLU CALL FOR HIGH PRESSURE AND WARMING TREND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The forecast at The Master's College and Cal Lutheran looks like 80s and 90s 
with occasional highs in the 100s. 
</P>
<P>
Scores should soar in Newhall and Thousand Oaks during the upcoming men's 
basketball season, and temperatures in each school's gym might begin to climb 
as well when these teams start to heat up their hoops. 
</P>
<P>
Each team plans to be more up-tempo than a hummingbird. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope we would be above ninety" points per game, said Cal Lutheran 
Coach Mike Dunlap, whose team scored 100 or more in its two scrimmages. 
</P>
<P>
Master's Coach Mel Hankinson believes that if his players can put points on the 
board, the team will put fans in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
"This year you better get here early if you want a seat," Hankinson said. 
"You're not going to sell many tickets if you continue to play games in the 
fifties." 
</P>
<P>
If it sounds like Master's and Cal Lutheran will be pressing to score so many 
points, they will. Hankinson says his team will utilize a press 40 minutes a 
game, and Dunlap says his team will show some form of press for two-thirds of 
each game. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to impress NAIA District 3 coaches, though. In a preseason 
poll, the coaches chose Westmont first, Master's fifth and Cal Lutheran 11th 
out of 13 teams. 
</P>
<P>
Dunlap, whose team struggled to a 5-21 record in his first season at Cal 
Lutheran, believes that he has upgraded his squad's talent. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got better shooters," Dunlap said. "We've helped ourself particularly at 
the point position and the post position." 
</P>
<P>
Dunlap said his wing players have the green light to shoot. He can only hope 
that when his shooters try to heat up, they don't do so with brick ovens. 
</P>
<P>
That should not be a problem with scorer deluxe Jeff deLaveaga in the 
backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
DeLaveaga, a 6-4 junior off-guard, was second in the NCAA Division II in 
scoring last season at 26.9 points a game. DeLaveaga, who also grabbed 5.6 
rebounds a game, has bulked up and scored more than 70 points in the two 
scrimmages. 
</P>
<P>
"DeLaveaga is much more efficient," Dunlap said. "His passing is improved. His 
ballhandling is improved." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Tapp, a 6-1 freshman from Burbank High, will start at small forward, and 
Carl Champion, a 6-4 senior who averaged 5.6 points and 4.5 rebounds a game, 
will start at power forward. Hank Hou, a 5-10 freshman from Marshall, will play 
point guard. Simon O'Donnell, a 6-6 transfer from Lassen College, will man the 
post. 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell has lost 10 pounds through Dunlap's preseason training regimen. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran will open at 9 tonight against UC Santa Cruz in the first round of 
the Menlo tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Hankinson believes he has enough talent to play a schedule that includes more 
than 10 Division II opponents, including Division II runner-up Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not playing a church league," Hankinson said. "We've moved the schedule 
up two whole notches." 
</P>
<P>
All five starters return from a team that finished 19-17, the team's first 
winning record since the 1971-72 season, and earned its first appearance in the 
NAIA District 3 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll be a top-10 NAIA team," Hankinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Junior forward Tom Bruner (6-6) averaged 17.6 points and 8.3 rebounds a game 
and was named to the NAIA All-District 3 team. Junior swingman Jason Webster 
(6-4) averaged 14.6 points and 6.3 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Junior point guard Damon Greer (6-0) averaged 8.5 points and 6-6 junior forward 
Stuart Epperson averaged 9.6 points and 4.3 rebounds. Senior swingman Jeff 
Newton (6-4) averaged 8.7 points. 
</P>
<P>
Five transfers, three from junior colleges and two from Division I schools, 
join 10 lettermen. Bruce Watson, a 6-5 junior from Moorpark, has impressed 
Hankinson with his shooting, and the Division I transfers, Joe Jon Bryant (6-7) 
from Richmond and Terry Minnoy (5-10) from Idaho State, will become eligible 
Dec. 21. 
</P>
<P>
Master's will begin play at home in its Tip-Off tournament today with an 8 p.m. 
game against San Jose Christian.

JENKINS IS NAMED WEST BASEBALL COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Redondo High baseball Coach Harry Jenkins, who has been out of coaching 
for two years, has been named coach at West Torrance High. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins guided Redondo to 10 league titles in 19 seasons at Redondo. He 
resigned to pursue business interests after the 1988 season, when the Sea Hawks 
went 30-3 and reached the CIF-Southern Section 4-A semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins had intended to help Palos Verdes Coach Gil Eberhard this spring until 
West offered him a head coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins replaces Dick McGrath, who resigned after coaching West for one season.

DIGEST: NO. 1-RANKED BAKERSFIELD TO PLAY PIERCE IN FOOTBALL GAME WITH PLAYOFF 
IMPLICATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bakersfield, the nation's top-ranked junior college football team, will meet 
Pierce at 7:30 tonight in a Western State Conference Southern Division game at 
Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield (9-0, 8-0 in conference play and 4-0 in divisional play) is led by 
cornerback Lance Geary, who shares the WSC lead with seven interceptions; 
quarterback Bryan Nixon, a left-hander who averages more than 22 yards a 
completion; and running backs Shon Ellerbe and Nathan Dupree, who rank third 
and fifth in the conference in rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce (4-5, 4-4, 2-2) could perhaps sneak into a bowl game with a victory. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Madison, a 6-foot-2 sophomore guard at Antelope Valley College, has signed 
a letter of intent to play basketball for New Mexico State, according to 
Antelope Valley Coach Newton Chelette. 
</P>
<P>
Madison, a Dorsey High product, averaged 16.2 points a game last season and 
scored 33 points in a season-opening victory over Glendale. Madison, an 
All-Foothill Conference first-team selection, holds school records for 
three-point baskets in a game (8) and in a season (107). 
</P>
<P>
He is expected to join Moorpark College point guard Sam Crawford in the Aggies' 
backcourt. Both players signed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Oviatt of Humboldt State, Jeff Gilkey of Cal Poly Pomona, and Teresa Poy 
of Cal State Los Angeles, all of whom have ties to the Valley area, will 
compete in the NCAA Division II cross-country championships in McKinleyville, 
Calif., Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Oviatt, a 1988 graduate of Agoura High, is the No. 1 runner for the 
sixth-ranked team in the country and Poy, who transferred from Cal State 
Northridge to Cal State L. A. in 1988, is the top runner for the ninth-ranked 
women's team. 
</P>
<P>
Gilkey, who transferred from Northridge last summer, is the No. 2 runner for 
Cal Poly Pomona's fourth-ranked men's team.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK;

<P>
EAST VALLEY RIVALS TO FACE OFF FOR PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1989, Poly and North Hollywood highs combined for three wins and finished 
last and next-to-last, respectively, in the East Valley League. 
</P>
<P>
This season, the Parrots (6-3, 4-2) and the Huskies (5-3, 4-2) enter the last 
week of the City Section's regular season fighting for second place and a berth 
in the 3-A Division playoffs. The teams will play each other starting at 8 
tonight at North Hollywood for that playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood has won the past two meetings -- the Huskies prevailed last 
year, 27-18 -- giving Poly ample incentive. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not sky-high, but we will be," second-year Poly Coach Fred Cuccia said. 
"We don't want (our players) sky-high until the day of the game. We don't want 
them to leave their game on the practice field." 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies, however, have been fired up since last week. After a 24-14 win at 
Grant on Friday afternoon, many of the players attended Poly's 45-28 loss to 
Sylmar that night. Some North Hollywood players jawed with the Parrots as they 
left the field, Cuccia said. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll let North Hollywood do all the talking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cuccia hopes the Parrots' offense speaks for itself tonight. Poly averages 339 
yards a game, tops among area City Section teams. The Parrots have rushed for 
2,312 yards in 346 carries and average 6.7 yards a carry. Jermaine Pledger (68 
carries, 615 yards) is leading the flock with an average of 9.0 yards, followed 
by Enrique Ortiz (13 carries, 106 yards) with an 8.2 average and Jonathan 
Campbell (165 carries, 1,226 yards), who is averaging 7.4. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the Huskies are virtually a one-man offensive show. Leon Gable has 
rushed for 1,639 yards in 248 carries (a 6.6 average) and has scored 23 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood made it to postseason play in 1988 and lost in the first round. 
Poly has not been part of the playoffs since the Parrots were 9-0 in 1983 under 
Coach Dick Windham. 
</P>
<P>
Highlander on the rise: Granada Hills running back Brett Washington, who 
already owns nine school records, has moved within striking range of four 
others. With his next rushing touchdown, Washington can tie Khalid Ali's 
single-season mark of 18, set in 1986. Another Ali mark, for highest career 
rushing average at 6.8 yards a carry, is in jeopardy. In his three seasons at 
Granada Hills, Washington is averaging 7.02 yards, including 8.4 in 142 
attempts this year. 
</P>
<P>
Washington has at least two games remaining to gain the 173 yards needed to 
break Ali's single-season rushing mark of 1,370 yards, also set in 1986. 
Washington (102 points) needs 18 points to tie Ali's single-season mark of 120 
points, set in '86. 
</P>
<P>
Marmonte duel: Mike Smith, coach of the Camarillo boys' cross-country team, 
breathed a sigh of relief after the Scorpions beat Channel Islands by a point 
in the Marmonte League finals earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad we don't have to meet CI any more," he said in reference to the new 
divisional setup for the Southern Section championships. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo, the Marmonte League co-champion, competes in Division II; Channel 
Islands is a Division I school. 
</P>
<P>
But the Scorpions will face another obstacle Saturday at Mt. San Antonio 
College in their quest for a second consecutive Southern Section title. One of 
Marmonte proportions. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura, the third-place team in the Marmonte League, is ranked second in 
Division II behind Camarillo and will challenge the Scorpions for the 
championship. The Chargers also are seeking their second division title in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams placed three runners among the top 10 finishers in recording heat 
wins in last week's preliminaries. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura (39 points) defeated St. John Bosco (66) and Mission Viejo (100) to 
advance to its fourth Southern Section final in as many years. Camarillo eased 
into its fifth consecutive divisional final with 35 points, outdistancing 
Claremont (55) and Bishop Amat (86). 
</P>
<P>
Did you know?: City Section Commissioner Hal Harkness won a City cross-country 
championship while at North Hollywood in 1955. Harkness toured the 1.9-mile 
course at UCLA in 9 minutes 41.8 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Fast times at Marmonte highs: Most leagues have only one cross-country runner 
capable of competing at a sectional level and about one league out of three has 
a state-caliber athlete. 
</P>
<P>
State-level runners Shelley Taylor, a junior at Huntington Beach Edison, and 
Martha Pinto, a senior at Anaheim Katella, are the class of the Sunset and 
Empire leagues, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Seldom does a league have two great runners. But the Marmonte League boasts 
three runners capable of a top-10 finish in the state championships. 
</P>
<P>
Jeannie Rothman, Deena Drossin and Veronica Barajas, runners who compete in the 
Marmonte League, posted times that ranked first, second and fourth in the 
Southern Section preliminaries Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Rothman, a senior at Westlake, ran 17:49 in winning her Division II heat by 1 
minute 45 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura senior Drossin timed 17:54 to lead the top-ranked Chargers to an 18-75 
win over Division I rival Upland. She won her heat by 59 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Barajas, a Channel Islands junior, won her Division I heat in 18:27, nine 
seconds faster than Erica Sumi of Long Beach Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Drossin and Rothman boast the two fastest times at Mt. SAC this year -- 17:16 
and 17:25 from the Mt. SAC Invitational on Oct. 20. Barajas' personal best at 
Mt. SAC is 18:02. 
</P>
<P>
Drossin won the state Division I title last year and Rothman placed third. 
Barajas has made remarkable improvement since last fall and could contend for a 
top-10 finish in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
Raging Warriors: Cross-country dual meets often are won by scores of 19-42, 
24-32 and 15-50. 
</P>
<P>
Rarely does any team score less than 30 or 40 points in a championship meet 
unless it is a national-caliber team like the Agoura girls or the 1989 
Camarillo boys. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake, though, made a statement in the Southern Section preliminaries. The 
Warriors totaled 22 points, confirming that they are in strong contention for 
the Division II title and a berth in the state final Nov. 24. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors placed six runners among the top nine finishers and finished with 
the lowest total of the four Division II preliminary heats. 
</P>
<P>
Rothman won in 17:49 -- the fastest time of the day -- over the three-mile 
course at Mt. San Antonio College to lead Westlake, ranked third in the 
Southern Section final poll. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake's Jessica Graham, known better as an 800-meter runner in track, 
finished second in 19:34. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake will meet No. 1 Anaheim Canyon, No. 2 Huntington Beach Edison and No. 
4 Mission Viejo in the championship race. 
</P>
<P>
Picking up the pieces: In a flash, Fillmore has gone from 8-0 and with hopes of 
a perfect season to 8-2 and limping into the football playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Flashes' second consecutive loss came at the hands of rival Santa Paula on 
Friday and kindled memories of last year when Fillmore started 9-0, only to 
finish 10-2 after being eliminated in the second round of the Southern Section 
Division IX playoffs.

Ventura in the Western State Conference women's volleyball tournament Thursday 
night at Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura beat Pierce, 15-7, 15-9, 3-15, 15-17, 15-10, in a match to determine

STATE MAY ACT TO BLOCK SALE AT FURNISHINGS 2000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State officials on Thursday were considering taking legal action to block a 
liquidation sale that Furnishings 2000 hopes to stage in order to raise cash 
needed to pay off creditors. 
</P>
<P>
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York earlier this month approved the proposed 
sale, but the state Department of Consumer Affairs raised questions about the 
three-month sale that is scheduled to start Saturday at 22 of Furnishings 
2000's stores in California. 
</P>
<P>
The sale is being managed by the court-appointed creditors committee of Mira 
Loma-based Furnishings 2000, which entered bankruptcy proceedings in September 
in New York City. The bankruptcy judge also authorized the committee to spend 
up to $18.5 million to buy additional furniture that would make the sale more 
attractive to shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Damont, chief of the home furnishings bureau in the state Department of 
Consumer Affairs, asked the attorney general's office Thursday to determine if 
the creditors committee is violating state law by spending the $18.5 million 
for furniture and appliances that would be sold alongside the chain's existing 
inventory. 
</P>
<P>
"If you announce a liquidation sale, you're restricted (by state law) to the 
merchandise which is on hand or that had been previously ordered," Damont said. 
"You can't order merchandise just to keep the sale going . . . that would be in 
violation of state law." 
</P>
<P>
However, Herschel Elkins, senior assistant attorney general, said that the 
bankruptcy order issued earlier this month in New York evidently gives 
Furnishings 2000 wide latitude when it comes to complying with state and local 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly the sale (as proposed) violates the California law," Elkins said. "But 
the question is whether the New York bankruptcy court specifically said they 
can run a scam sale and violate California law to benefit creditors and say to 
hell with consumers." 
</P>
<P>
After a "brief examination" of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court order, Elkin said the 
order "appears to say that you can violate anything, cheat as many people as 
you can as quickly as you can." Elkins said a decision on a legal challenge 
will be made today. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the creditors committee was not available for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The creditors committee hopes to generate $40 million in gross revenue during 
the 90-day sale, after which the chain's Southern California stores would be 
closed. Furnishings 2000 owes $20 million to $30 million to its creditors, 
including $1.2 million that is owed to customers who ordered, but never 
received, furniture. 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks following Furnishings 2000's bankruptcy filing, the state 
Department of Consumer Affairs was deluged with "hundreds of calls" from 
disgruntled buyers, Damont said."Some consumers had paid $5,000 or $6,000 to 
Furnishings 2000 before it went into bankruptcy," Damont said. 
</P>
<P>
The creditors committee is sending letters to Furnishings 2000 customers who 
have ordered, but not yet received, merchandise. The creditors committee is 
directing customers who don't receive letters to company representatives who 
will be at the 22 stores that are to reopen on Saturday.

DEAR HOT SHOPPERS: Here's Part II of our cavalcade of holiday catalogue finds. 
It's designed for all of you who, like Candice Bergen, are determined to "avoid 
the maul." So get out the pre-roasted chestnuts (purchased by mail, of course), 
move your telephone over by the fire, play that video of last year's holiday 
party and get ready to hit those 800 numbers. 
</P>
<P>
TEAM SPIRIT: Some of the best-looking athletic jackets we've seen this year 
feature colorful super-graphics of NFL teams splashed across the back. The 
cinnamon-and-gold Washington Redskins jacket, for instance, has a 
larger-than-life profile of an Indian on the back, while the L.A. Raiders 
jacket features a black and white "Raiders" graphic reminiscent of the "Raiders 
of the Lost Ark" logo. Other jackets include the Chicago Bears, San Francisco 
49ers, Minnesota Vikings, Cincinnati Bengals, New York Giants and the Cleveland 
Browns. (Browns fans: Please note that your team's jacket is dedicated to the 
"Dawgs," the Browns' infamous "dog pound" of barking fans.) The jackets are 
available from Sears' Starting Lineup catalogue, which contains a wide variety 
of official NFL merchandise. They come in men's and boys' sizes and sell for 
$54.98 and $49.99 respectively. To order, call (800) 366-3000. 
</P>
<P>
 FIT TO BE TIED: We know, we know. It's not red and green. It doesn't have 
Santa Clauses or gingerbread cookies on it. But it's gorgeous wrapping paper 
(pictured), and it'll make your packages look as enticing as what's inside. 
It's conveniently packaged in book format, with the wrapping paper easily torn 
out. "Giftwraps by Artists: French Provincial 16th-Century Textile Paintings" 
costs $12.95, and there are two 19-by-27-inch sheets of eight different 
designs. To go with the paper is equally amazing French ribbon ($13.50 for one 
roll, one inch wide and five meters long), which contains tiny hidden wires 
that allow you to bend it into any shape you want; it comes in various colors. 
Both are from the Smith &amp; Hawken Holiday 1990 catalogue. To order, call 
(415) 383-2000. 
</P>
<P>
 TOTE-A-COAT: Anyone who has had to stuff, squash or lug a raincoat while 
traveling will appreciate a bit of innovation from Lands' End: a raincoat that 
packs into its own small zippered pouch that in turn fits into a briefcase or 
tote. The putty-colored, full-length coat for men or women is made of 
machine-washable cotton and has a water-repellent finish. It's $79.50 from the 
Lands' End Blockbuster Holiday Issue catalogue. To order, call (800) 356-4444. 
</P>
<P>
LAMPSHADE NOT INCLUDED: Always yearning to be the center of attention at a 
party? With Partyalls you'll have no problem attracting people. This 
long-sleeve jumpsuit turns you into a living canvas so aspiring painters and 
graffiti artists can cover you with words and pictures. They come in white in 
two sizes, one for kids ($13.95) and one for adults ($14.95) and include two 
markers. Partyalls are from Potpourri Holiday '90 catalogue; to order, call 
(800) 225-9848. 
</P>
<P>
FROM THE HIP: Love the idea of fanny packs but hate boring nylon models? So do 
we, but we've found two great alternatives. The first is quilted black leather 
with a leather-woven gold-tone chain belt. It's $55 from the Christmas 1990 
Bloomingdale's By Mail catalogue; to order, call (800) 777-0000. The other is a 
furry koala bear pack for kids; it's $16.95 from the Nature Company Catalogue. 
To order, call (800) 227-1114.

Roger Craig, the San Francisco 49ers star running back, has had a steady stream 
of modeling and acting jobs since he started appearing in Macy's California 
Passport fashion shows. Now he's doing ads for Calvin Klein underwear and for 
various drinks and shoes favored by jocks. And then there are his TV-host and 
exercise-video careers. If you think he's ready for a starring role in a movie, 
you're right: Craig plays a cop in a Roger Corman action film due out next 
month.

NO MORE MR. NICE GUY: Guy Greengard, the genial owner of the Mr. Guy store who 
left Rodeo for Canon Drive less than a year ago and recently filed a Chapter 11 
bankruptcy petition, says it isn't over yet. "The location just hasn't worked 
out traffic-wise," he told Listen. But he added that he will probably open 
another, smaller store soon.

VAL'S PALS: Italian fashion king Valentino will be wined and dined Beverly 
Hills-style when he arrives in town Nov. 25 to celebrate the recent opening of 
his store at Two Rodeo Drive. Reported plans include Swifty Lazar's dinner at 
Spago, Betsy Bloomingdale's lunch at home and Barry Diller's dinner at an 
undetermined location. The capper is Valentino's own cocktail party at the new 
store Nov. 28, with a cast of several hundred including "so many stars it will 
look like the Academy Awards," says his new West Coast spokeswoman, Laurie 
Bodor. 
</P>
<P>
BACK TO SQWEAR ONE: Although he says he enjoyed helping pioneer the brightly 
colored wardrobes the New Kids on The Block wear in their Coca-Cola 
commercials, designer William Beranek, who co-founded L.A.-based Sqwear with 
designer Henry Duarte, will step out on his own this holiday season. He has a 
new line of contemporary men's apparel under the William B. label, to be 
carried at J. C. Amber in Hollywood and Traffic in Los Angeles. He's gone 
mainstream, but Beranek assures Listen his star-wardrobing days are not 
numbered. Late night talk show host Arsenio Hall and singer Stevie B. have 
placed orders between $220 and $600, he says.

THE 18-K HEDGE: What recession? Gianmaria Buccellati, designer and owner of the 
Buccellati jewelry and silver company, unveiled about $20-million worth of his 
latest designs, including diamonds and gold worked to resemble a delicate 
Venetian lace choker ($309,000). "Yes, there is a little contraction (in 
business)," he said, "but I'm a worldwide jeweler, so one day if it's not good 
in the United States, it is in Japan or France or Italy." COMPILED BY THE

INTO THE NIGHT / JEANNINE STEIN: SALUTE TO 'RED, HOT AND BLUE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The Scene: Party Wednesday night at the Four Seasons hotel to celebrate the 
release of Chrysalis Records' "Red, Hot and Blue," a double album of Cole 
Porter songs featuring U2, k.d. lang, Jody Watley, The Jungle Brothers, Sinead 
O'Connor, Neneh Cherry and many others. Next month, ABC will air a 90-minute 
special, including the stars performing their videos. This is more than an 
ambitious multimedia extravaganza: Proceeds from sales will benefit 
international AIDS research and relief programs. The project's co-creators and 
a few of the artists were on hand for a buffet dinner party underwritten by 
Entertainment Weekly magazine that featured a brief performance by Jody Watley 
and a quick speech by Elizabeth Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: Those who had heard the album either thought it was totally wonderful 
or somewhat uneven. And while some thought Cole Porter would have heartily 
approved of the music and the motive, others swore he's turning in his grave. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: Co-creators Leigh Blake and John Carlin, supervising music 
producer Steve Lillywhite, album artists David Byrne and Jody Watley, plus 
Bernie Taupin, MCA Music Entertainment Group chairman Al Teller, Mark 
Slaughter, Balthazar Getty, John Glover, Michael Feinstein, Don Was and every 
working publicist west of the Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Mode: Although the dress code called for "festive" attire, most 
interpreted that as wearing their rumpled suits straight from the office. Some 
found time to throw on some gold lame or black leather. 
</P>
<P>
Bad Fashion Trend Alert: Men in long, black duster coats and a three-day growth 
of beard. Urban cowboy gone awry. 
</P>
<P>
Chow: The hotel's catering service put up food "stations" serving pasta, wild 
mushrooms, veal tenderloins and smoked salmon; other offerings included grilled 
shrimp with roasted garlic, fresh fruit and French pastries. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: "This is sort of beyond my wildest expectations," said Carlin. 
"Everything we hoped to turn out turned out, which I think is somewhat unusual 
in a project like this. . . . Not only do we weave a message into this 
incredibly powerful communication vehicle, but we've also pushed it in a very 
artistic level. Because I think we felt fundamentally that if you have artistic 
integrity, the message gets across much better." 
</P>
<P>
New Way to Greet 'n' Schmooze Your Business Associate: "Hi! How ya doin'? 
Greeeeaaaaat shirt." 
</P>
<P>
Not a Potential Jeopardy Contestant: "So, who's this guy up here?" wondered one 
woman, staring at a picture of Cole Porter. 
</P>
<P>
Glitches: Guests waited for the ballroom doors to open so they could hear 
Taylor speak and Watley sing. When the doors opened, there were no chairs to be 
found, so they stood some more and waited for Taylor. Most left after her 
speech, thinking Watley would follow much later. She didn't. Her one number, 
"After You, Who?" was missed by most of the crowd. Those who stuck around 
praised the singer's jazzy performance.

Murder on Mock Trial: A group of well-known actors took part in a mock trial 
staged this morning outside the Federal Building in downtown Los Angeles to 
commemorate the anniversary of the murder of six Jesuit priests in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
The organization, called the Wednesday Morning Coalition for Peace and Justice 
in Central America and the U.S., will "try" the murderers of the six priests, 
their cook and her daughter in a street opera featuring masked actors, puppets 
and mimes. Among those scheduled to participate were actors Martin Sheen, Ed 
Asner and Robert Foxworth. The eight were fatally shot on Nov. 16, 1989, at the 
University of Central America in San Salvador. CLAUDIA PUIG

its decision to drop the weekly newsmagazine "South Africa Now." A spokeswoman 
for the station said the decision not to renew the show for a sixth season was 
made before station officials realized how important it was to viewers. "South 
Africa Now" made headlines last month when Los Angeles public station KCET 
decided to drop the show, claiming it was biased, and then reversed itself 
under pressure from community organizations. CLAUDIA PUIG

Van Gogh Breaks Record: A Van Gogh still life failed to sell at a Christie's 
auction Wednesday night, but a drawing by the artist fetched a world-record 
price. Vincent Van Gogh's "Garden of Flowers," a detailed rendering of a 
vegetable and flower garden in brown and black ink, sold to an anonymous buyer 
for $8.36 million, a world record for a drawing. But his "Vase With Poppies and 
Cornflowers," estimated to go for up to $16 million, could muster a high of 
only $9.5 million. CLAUDIA PUIG

The Sounds of Simon: Paul Simon will kick off a 40-city North American tour in 
January christened "Born at the Right Time." Simon, whose "The Rhythm of the 
Saints" was released last month and is number 4 on the Billboard charts, will 
perform at the Forum in Inglewood on Jan. 23 and 24 and at the San Diego Sports 
Arena on Jan. 20. The tour will feature a 17-piece backing band, and a quartet

DOCUMENTING ASIAN-AMERICAN EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Arthur Dong's "Claiming a Voice" is a stirring, illuminating one-hour 
documentary celebrating the 20th anniversary of Visual Communications, the 
country's oldest Asian Pacific media-arts organization, headquartered in a 
downtown loft. It will screen Saturday at 8 p.m. at the Japan America Theater 
in Little Tokyo as part of V.C.'s anniversary program. 
</P>
<P>
Dong, the gifted maker of such films as "Sewing Woman," "Lotus" and "Forbidden 
City, U.S.A.," combines interviews with such V.C. founders as Duane Kubo, Bob 
Nakamura and Eddie Wong with clips from their films and those of many others to 
trace the evolution of the organization from a pioneering producing unit to a 
wide-ranging support group. 
</P>
<P>
V.C.'s founders, most of whom were film students in the activist '60s, 
discovered that they shared a desire to create images that would counteract the 
Asian stereotypes perpetuated in the media over decades. They and their many 
colleagues, such as Dan Kuramoto, leader of the jazz fusion band Hiroshima, 
speak of their personal need to discover their identities as hyphenate 
Americans. (Hiroshima will perform Saturday as part of the V.C. festivities.) 
</P>
<P>
They began modestly with educational tools such as game boards for elementary 
school children designed to make them aware and proud of their cultural 
heritage. Soon V.C. was producing films and videos of every form -- 
documentary, fiction, animation. Dong has extracted apt clips from such 
landmark V.C. productions as its ambitious feature-length drama "Hito Hata," in 
which the entire Japanese-American experience is expressed through the long 
life of an elderly immigrant, played beautifully by Mako, and featuring 
Noriyuki (Pat) Morita and the late Yuki Shimoda. (Shimoda was to become the 
subject of one of V.C.'s best documentaries, a touching study of an actor who 
managed to keep growing in his craft despite the limited opportunities that 
exist for Asian Pacific-American performers.) There are clips from films 
dealing with the Samoan community and from Supachai Surongsain's "Pak Bueng on 
Fire," a brief but eloquent story of two young Thai men's struggle to survive 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The interviewees speak of around-the-clock editing shifts necessitated by 
limited equipment and the struggle simply to survive as an organization, not 
only in the early years but more recently during the arts-funding cutbacks of 
the Reagan Administration. V.C.'s founders and early members have by and large 
moved into mainstream media to make way for a new generation, but the fight 
against racism continues, reminds V.C.'s current executive director, Linda 
Mabalot. The words of Yuki Shimoda, nearing the end of his life, could stand as 
a credo for "Claiming a Voice" -- and V.C.: "If we don't fight for something we 
believe in, we're just wasting time."

FEW BIG PAYOFFS IN 'LITTLE VEGAS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Little Vegas" (Monica4-Plex) is a nice little movie that falls apart -- as 
nice little movies are sometimes wont to do. A first-time effort by 
writer-director-actor Perry Lang, it starts off with some positive virtues. It 
has bright, offbeat dialogue, a fine cast and a terrific backdrop -- a 
sun-struck little Nevada trailer camp on the edge of the desert, inhabited by a 
motley collection of transplanted Jews, Italian-Americans and beaming, 
blank-faced Westerners. 
</P>
<P>
It's the bigger Las Vegas impacted and compressed. The people who live there 
are like parodies of the usual Vegasites. They're not gangsters; they're 
gangster's relatives. They're not big players; they're small-potato bunco 
artists with grandiose dreams. Even the local entrepreneur, Harvey (Bruce 
McGill) -- who dreams of tearing down the trailer camp and erecting "Little 
Vegas" -- is so financially strapped that a would-be heist man can't find any 
cash in his safe. 
</P>
<P>
The movie's hero, reluctant gigolo Carmine (Anthony John Denison), locked in a 
vicious probate battle with the son of his recently deceased lover, and falling 
in love with the daughter, is a harried father bereft of the usual machismo. 
When we first see Carmine, he's staggering toward us, in heels and a dress, 
over the desert sands. 
</P>
<P>
Yet these penny-ante schemers don't necessarily talk small potatoes. They 
swagger and swear like the genuine article. The movie does have one real real 
gangster: Carmine's brother, Frank (Michael Nouri), who shows up distressed 
because an old childhood enemy has just been named New Jersey sanitation 
commissioner -- and since Frank looks like a GQ ad model, we might suspect that 
the major difference between big- and small-timers is that the big-timers have 
snappier tailors and don't sweat as much. 
</P>
<P>
Director Lang shows talent; his humor has an easy, unforced pitch. He's an 
actor himself in this film, and he's made the movie into an actor's showcase. 
Denison, McGill, Nouri, Catherine O'Hara, Jerry Stiller, Anne Francis and Jay 
Thomas -- as Frank's sidekick -- are all quite good. 
</P>
<P>
But Lang is better at setups than payoffs. In its last third, this movie goes 
zany and loses all its rhythm, piling on the climaxes and the pratfalls, the 
violence and the major life decisions until they start spraying out every 
which-way, like a scraggly bouquet. A pity -- because, at first, "Little Vegas" 
(R for sex, language, partial nudity and mild violence) is onto something. It 
has a fix on splintered families, wasted, rattletrap lives, wanna-be gangsters 
and people fleeing from their past. 
</P>
<P>
This trailer camp lies at the dead-end of the Great American Open Road but Lang 
doesn't open up the right windows. Perhaps he wants to kid himself that there's 
a better road, opening up just ahead. 
</P>

DARK COMEDY TOO GRIM TO BE FUNNY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Disturbed" (at selected theaters) opens with a sequence from which it can 
never hope to recover. We watch a woman in a mental institution being prepared 
for a rape by its administrator, who drugs her and straps her down. 
</P>
<P>
Later she commits suicide, jumping off the roof of the secluded asylum on 
visiting day and before the eyes of her horrified husband and small daughter. 
</P>
<P>
This is all too grimly literal for a film that writer-director Charles Winkler 
and co-writer Emerson Bixby mean to be a dark comedy, a send-up of the 
insane-asylum genre where the chief doctor always turns out to be crazier than 
his patients. Not helping matters is that there have at this point been so many 
mental-institution movies, serious and otherwise, that it would take filmmakers 
far more experienced than Winkler and Bixby to make such a movie seem fresh and 
original. Competent craftsmanship, which Winkler possesses, is just not enough 
here. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the manic zaniness of Malcolm McDowell in full-throttle as the crazed 
psychiatrist can obliterate the brutal negative impact of the initial scenes. 
McDowell, who might have been fun had the circumstances been more inspired, 
throws himself into the campy spirit of the occasion, and so do Geoffrey Lewis 
as a longtime inmate who's become more a pal than a patient of McDowell and 
Priscilla Pointer as the severe, repressed head nurse. "Disturbed" (rated R for 
violence) is disturbing in a way never intended.

FANTASY, ANIMATION SOAR IN 'RESCUERS DOWN UNDER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With its exhilarating action sequences, Walt Disney Pictures' "The Rescuers 
Down Under" challenges the adventure films of Spielberg and Lucas and confirms 
the special power of animation to present extravagant fantasies on screen. 
</P>
<P>
The first sequel in the studio's history and its 29th feature-length cartoon, 
"Rescuers Down Under" (citywide and suitable for all ages) suggests a new 
direction for Disney animation. With the exception of the forgotten wartime 
propaganda piece "Victory Through Air Power," all the previous Disney cartoon 
features have been musicals; a fast-paced, straightforward adventure story with 
no songs, "Rescuers" is closer in tone to the sci-fi epics of Japanese 
animation than to "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." 
</P>
<P>
Bernard and Miss Bianca (voices by Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor), the plucky mice 
from the Rescue Aid Society who charmed audiences in Disney's 1977 hit, "The 
Rescuers," are back on a new mission. Cody (Adam Ryen), a young Australian boy, 
has been kidnaped while trying to protect Marahute, a giant golden eagle, from 
the villainous poacher Percival McLeach (George C. Scott). 
</P>
<P>
The human rangers think Cody fell into a crocodile-infested river and have 
given up the search. Only Bernard and Bianca can save him -- which they do with 
the help of a variety of animal allies, including Jake, a dashing, Paul 
Hogan-esque kangaroo mouse (Tristan Rogers), and Wilbur, a befuddled albatross 
(John Candy, overplaying wonderfully). 
</P>
<P>
First-time directors Hendel Butoy and Mike Gabriel faced the unenviable task of 
competing with recent live-action adventure films and trying to match the 
polished work of "The Rescuers." The pair successfully meets both challenges, 
an impressive achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Bianca is still the adventurous gamin who blithely dazzles every male she 
encounters. Bernard remains the worrisome adventurer in spite of himself, and 
the sequence in which he summons up his courage and subdues a huge razorback 
hog represents a delightful blend of animation and voice acting. Wilbur the 
albatross looks like Orville from the first film (they're supposed to be 
brothers), but moves in ways that expresses his very different personality. 
</P>
<P>
Human characters have always presented a special challenge for animators, 
because the audience can easily recognize any mistakes in the way they move. 
McLeach is an extraordinarily vivid character. The animation and Scott's vocal 
performance convey a very real sense of menace. 
</P>
<P>
When Cody is thrown into an abandoned opal mine with the animals McLeach has 
illegally trapped, he meets a hysterical frilled lizard who cries, "We'll never 
leave this place!" A sardonic koala reveals the extent of McLeach's villainy in 
his reply, "Oh no, you'll leave -- as a purse, a nice lady's purse." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of offering a pallid copy of the Spielberg/Lucas live-action 
adventures, as the recent "Ducktales: The Movie: The Secret of the Lost Lamp" 
did, Butoy, Gabriel and their story crew went back to the childhood dreams that 
inspired those fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
Computer-generated backgrounds enable Butoy and Gabriel to heighten the sense 
of fantasy in ways that were previously impossible in animation, like having 
the camera follow Wilbur's breakneck flights amid the skyscrapers of New York 
and Sydney. But the real magic occurs when Marahute stretches her vast wings 
and carries Cody through the skies. The scenes of them gliding over massive 
banks of clouds, diving off a waterfall and soaring into the starry Australian 
night embody the fantasy of every child who dreamed of having a special animal 
friend/protector. It's a bravura piece of animation. 
</P>
<P>
On the down side, Cody emerges as a brave and resourceful boy, but he's rather 
one-dimensional. He never has to deal with the conflicting emotions that make 
Pinocchio seem so human, even when he's a puppet. Nor is it clear if the 
animals McLeach had imprisoned are ever rescued, although it's assumed Cody 
would go back for them after the villain has met his richly deserved end. But 
these are minor flaws in an otherwise exceptional film. 
</P>
<P>
Preceding "The Rescuers Down Under," on a sort of double bill, is "The Prince 
and the Pauper," a film in the traditional Disney musical comedy format. Mark 
Twain's classic tale of exchanging identities has been turned into a 22-minute 
comic vehicle for Mickey Mouse (in the double title role), Donald Duck, Pluto, 
Goofy, Horace Horsecollar, Black Pete and the Weasels from "Who Framed Roger 
Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
Mickey's appearance has changed many times over the years, and the artists 
chose the appealing Mickey of the late '30s -- the era of "Brave Little Tailor" 
and "Fantasia" -- as their model for "Prince and Pauper." The polished 
animation, especially in the mime sequences, reminds audiences why the 
character became so popular: Mickey hasn't looked this good or moved this well 
in decades. 
</P>
<P>
"The Prince and the Pauper" is certainly entertaining, but it goes by awfully 
fast. It's really just the beginning and end of a story, with the middle 
compressed into a few quick scenes. Expanding the film into a feature would 
have given the artists more of a chance to explore the reactions of the Prince 
and the Pauper to their new identities. As it stands, neither character has 
much time to realize he's better off being who he really is.

SOLID TRIBUTE TO AN ELUSIVE MASTER PAINTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sigmar Polke is a terrifically important artist, and "Sigmar Polke" is a 
terrifically important exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Just about the only disappointment attached to the sprawling retrospective, 
which opened Thursday at the Museum of Modern Art here, is that it won't be 
traveling to Los Angeles. (After San Francisco, it moves to Washington, D.C., 
Chicago and New York.) That, and the museum's notoriously awkward gallery 
spaces, which make coherent installations of many an artist's work exceedingly 
difficult to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is especially vexing for Polke, the elusive German painter whose 
development since the early 1960s has been broadly influential for both 
European and American artists, but whose work has not been shown in much 
abundance in the United States. (Almost never is it in evidence on the West 
Coast.) 
</P>
<P>
The retrospective is large -- more than 90 paintings, from 1963 on, as well as 
an extensive group of often wonderful drawings and a new installation, 
featuring a gigantic ladder leading to an escape hatch through a skylight, made 
specially for the museum's Beaux-Arts rotunda -- and it offers nearly as 
complete a survey as one might hope for. Certainly there are gaps (the '70s are 
not well represented), but it's safe to say a substantive effort such as this 
isn't likely to come this way again for a very long time. Miss the show only at 
your peril. 
</P>
<P>
Still, piecing together how Polke got where he did, which is one aim of any 
retrospective assessment, isn't easy in the show. The entry galleries present 
the artist at his most consistently compelling -- the richly disorienting work 
of the 1980s -- while his formative pictures from the 1960s occupy a string of 
galleries to the side, displays that here and there are punctuated by more 
recent canvases. The trajectory is jumpy. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, with Polke, a strictly chronological survey may not be exactly 
essential. He's the kind of artist who periodically doubles back on himself, in 
paintings whose two principal trademarks are, first, multiple layers of 
imagery, one painted atop another, sometimes on commercial fabric also printed 
with patterns; and, second, decidedly unusual materials -- goopy stuff such as 
alcohol-diluted pigment and beeswax on canvas, or acrylic on Turkish blue 
Lurex, or silver, silver nitrite, iodine, cobalt chloride and artificial resin 
on canvas. (Reading the labels can make you feel like Ralph Nader at the 
supermarket.) Together, they yield anything but paintings with linear 
narratives. 
</P>
<P>
And, for an artist known to have made paintings that use mineral pigments whose 
color changes with the climactic conditions of the places in which they are 
shown, the idea of a tight, strictly ordered historical presentation doesn't 
really compute. 
</P>
<P>
The catalogue, too, is appropriately quirky. While the quality of the color 
reproductions is sometimes disappointing (near as I can tell, given paintings 
whose color isn't always fixed), the texts are often good. They're also all 
over the map, with contributions by the show's organizer, John Caldwell, the 
new curator at the museum whose debut this is, as well as by a critic, a 
historian, another artist, a filmmaker and even a collector. Each has something 
worthwhile to say, and the unusual diversity of voices serves Polke's 
internally diverse paintings well. This is an art that attempts to ground 
metaphysical experience in the muck and mire of the everyday -- a swamp that 
includes painting itself -- and the cacophony in the catalogue oddly fits. 
</P>
<P>
For Americans, Polke's art from the last 10 years is his most familiar, and for 
three notably interrelated reasons. He has been among the leading artists to 
have emerged in the recent internationalization of the contemporary art world 
(Polke was awarded the Golden Lion Prize for painting at the 1986 Venice 
Biennale). His work is the aesthetic offspring of perhaps the two archetypal 
artists of the post-1960 milieu, Germany's shamanistic Joseph Beuys (with whom 
he studied) and American Pop-meister Andy Warhol, whose influences were 
everywhere to be seen in the last decade. And his art's arrival on these shores 
was preceded by the widely publicized paintings of the younger American artists 
David Salle and Julian Schnabel, who couldn't have done what they did without 
having seen Polke's example on European sojourns. 
</P>
<P>
So Polke has celebrated forebears and followers, yet his own widely acclaimed 
work has been remote. We "know" it chiefly through means other than direct 
experience. Which is to say, we know it the way we know so much else in 
contemporary life, a distended knowledge that is itself central to Polke's art. 
</P>
<P>
Polke was born in Silesia (once part of East Germany, now part of Poland) in 
1941, and he immigrated to West Germany at the age of 12. Imagine growing up in 
a historically torn and ravaged land, physically and psychically, and to 
unprecedented degree, that was simultaneously being rebuilt in the image of the 
youthful culture of America. Something of both will be found in Polke's best 
work, which features evanescent imagery disappearing into the paintings' 
dilapidated material stew. 
</P>
<P>
Polke's paintings from about 1963 to the beginning of the 1970s feature the 
consumer goods, kitschy decoration and benday dots of Pop art, but they're 
vastly different from Warhol and Lichtenstein. Awkward and grubby, they don't 
possess the flashy urgency or cheerful anarchy of the Americans' work, seeming 
more like ancient talismans than reverential icons of the new. Together with 
Gerhard Richter and Konrad Fischer (then an artist, now an influential dealer), 
Polke dubbed this putative movement Capitalist Realism, a wry if provincial 
response to Pop by artists more than familiar with the enforced conventions of 
Socialist Realism. 
</P>
<P>
Most of these paintings are insistently ugly -- and it's hard to take your eyes 
off them. The paradox might partly be explained by the reliance on 
down-and-dirty, banged-up execution to render conventional concepts of beauty: 
tropical islands, flowers, birds, Playboy bunnies, young lovers and such. 
Drained of pop-culture slickness, the subjects seem damaged and oddly poignant. 
</P>
<P>
Polke followed these with several works examining other new conventions. A 
painting of simple mathematical equations that don't add up slid the rug out 
from under Conceptual art, while others took on the lowly decorative element of 
high-toned gestural abstraction and the godlike perfection of hard-edge 
painting. They bear a decided affinity to the contemporaneous early work of 
John Baldessari (the artist, incidentally, who contributed brief notes to the 
catalogue). 
</P>
<P>
These ruminations on the nature of art merged with Polke's prior concerns to 
form the great work of the 1980s (anticipated in some earlier gems, like the 
pivotal "Alice in Wonderland" from 1971). Here, pungent acknowledgement of the 
traditional structure of the object called a painting comes together, wildly, 
with the new pictorial structure of mass-culture imagery. 
</P>
<P>
Stretcher bars are a painting's skeleton, canvas its skin. Polke began dousing 
his canvases with resin, which turned the surface into a yellowed, cracked and 
translucent "flesh," through which the painting's "bones" are eerily glimpsed. 
Elsewhere, quilted cloth or patterned fabric substitutes for canvas, to 
"clothe" the painting's "body." 
</P>
<P>
This patterned fabric also offers one tumble of images on which other layers of 
painted pictures cavort. For Polke, a painting seems not to be a blank canvas 
or an empty field on which new images are invented. Instead, it has the feel of 
a metaphoric body existing as a blank screen, across which phantoms, specters 
and mysterious shades are projected. 
</P>
<P>
The transformative yet Earth-bound mysticism of Joseph Beuys and the 
receptive-to-anything "blank body" of Andy Warhol stand behind this uncanny 
quality. Polke's achievement has been to harness them together in his art -- a 
transfiguration that appears to stand behind the curator's firm commitment to 
Polke's work. 
</P>
<P>
Following a prescient 1987 show at the Milwaukee Art Museum grouping Warhol, 
Beuys and Polke, John Caldwell paired work by the two older, late artists in a 
much-remarked installation at Pittsburgh's 1988 Carnegie International. This 
corner room was matched, at the opposite end of a string of galleries, by a 
special installation of five, large paintings by Polke, variously composed from 
meteorite dust, silver leaf and Paleolithic tools scattered across glowing 
pools of resin. Those five paintings are now in San Francisco, one in the 
collection of the museum, four in Bay Area private collections. "Sigmar Polke" 
is their trenchant validation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sigmar Polke" remains at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art to Jan. 13, 
before traveling to the Hirschhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, 
D.C. (Feb. 12-May 7); the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (July 20-Sept. 8) 
and the Brooklyn Museum Oct. 11-Jan. 6, 1992).

'NORBERT SMITH' A WITTY BRITISH PARODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "Sir Norbert Smith: A Life," a British send-up of the reverential TV 
biography, English comedian Harry Enfield plays an 80-year-old Olivier-like 
actor whose life and career are chronicled in an insufferably stuffy television 
retrospective. 
</P>
<P>
The parody, airing on "Great Performances" tonight (9:30-10:30 on Channel 28, 
9-10 p.m. on Channels 15 and 24) is delicious, managing to be droll and pungent 
at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a show to tape and keep in your library and play back at parties. 
British humor doesn't always cross our shores intact, but "Sir Norbert Smith," 
with a swipe at the superior manner of British interview shows, is hilarious. 
</P>
<P>
The British are making fun of themselves here, but it's easy to imagine 
American celebrity TV shows, too. Barbara Walters' post-Oscar star interviews 
come instantly to mind. The high-toned interviewer prodding Sir Norbert Smith 
is smugly played by British TV host Melvyn Bragg, who, in fact, once 
interviewed Lord Olivier on "Great Performances' " "Laurence Olivier: A Life" 
in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Enfield, who's 29 and something of a cult figure in London, is a discovery -- 
for this viewer not unlike catching Sid Caesar on television for the first time 
in "Your Show of Shows." 
</P>
<P>
In "clips" affectionately staged by director Geoff Posner, Enfield's takeoffs 
on beloved British movie actors and their famous roles are ripe. Among other 
gems, the comedian (who co-wrote the material with Geoffrey Perkins) plays a 
gay, chain-smoking Hamlet "with additional dialogue by Noel Coward," and, in a 
commercial for a detergent called Sudso, recreates in a savory satire the 
doomed romance in "Brief Encounter." His Andrew Lloyd Webber impersonation is 
choice, too. RAY LOYND

1957 BERGMAN CLASSIC RELATES INNER JOURNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dreaming is emblematic of Ingmar Bergman's "Wild Strawberries." This masterful 
Swedish director at first submerges us in his old hero's nightmare, and later, 
the film finds its own dimension where reality is often enveloped by fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
The first scenes set the tone and course for this 1957 movie, screening tonight 
at UC Irvine. Hallucinatory is one way to describe the beginning, as we're 
introduced to Isak Borg (Victor Sjostrom), a 78-year-old doctor known for his 
toughness. He's lying in bed, having a dream that eventually becomes a 
nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
In it, Isak is wandering down a street. Everything seems calm, but then Bergman 
lays out a series of metaphors -- timepieces without hands; a rushing, 
out-of-control hearse drawn by black horses; a pervading isolation that comes 
from the deserted town square. 
</P>
<P>
When the hearse crashes, a coffin falls out. The corpse, suddenly alive, 
reaches out to Isak, who sees that it's he who is dead. He wakes up with 
thoughts of his mortality and decides to drive instead of fly to a distant 
university where he will be given an honorary degree. 
</P>
<P>
Isak takes along his lovely daughter-in-law (Ingrid Thulin) and picks up three 
young hitchhikers (Bibi Andersson, Bjorn Bjelvenstam and Folke Sundquist) after 
they stop at his boyhood home. All three, especially the girl among them, are 
spirited, and their presence revitalizes Isak. 
</P>
<P>
Isak and his companions are now traveling in the real world, but Isak can't 
escape the earlier dream. The foreshadowing becomes overshadowing as Bergman 
thrusts Isak into several dreamlike reveries, juxtaposing the present with his 
uneasy past. The trip becomes an odyssey of self-revelation, regret and 
grudging acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
Like "The Seventh Seal," which was released a year before, "Wild Strawberries" 
initially baffled many critics, who found the symbolism too personal and 
arcane. It did poorly in limited release in America but soon became a favorite 
of the art houses. Bergman's early films, like those of Fellini, were the first 
international cult movies. 
</P>
<P>
The critics' complaints seem odd now. Bergman's vision is unique, but there's a 
universal sweep to Isak's self-absorption and the way the director describes it 
that speaks to everyone who has considered the path of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
This is, to be sure, a film of great melancholy and introspection without a 
happy or heroic resolution. At times, all the pondering freezes the action, 
requiring our patience and attention. "Wild Strawberries," a true classic, is 
as far away from an easy Hollywood movie as you can get. 
</P>
<P>
It has much to offer, from Bergman's exploration of the narrative form to the 
script's reliance on the subconscious for inspiration. On a scholarly level, 
the film displays Bergman's career-long preoccupations with death, spiritual 
truth and rejuvenation. They've become his signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingmar Bergman's "Wild Strawberries" will be screened tonight at 7 and 9 at UC 
Irvine's Student Center Crystal Cove Auditorium as part of the UCI Film Society 
Directors' Personal Portraits series. Tickets: $2 to $4. (714) 856-6379.

LOCKHEED ORDERED TO PAY $45 MILLION IN FIRING OF 3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what is believed to be the largest legal award ever involving a defense 
firm, a Los Angeles jury imposed a $45.3-million judgment against Lockheed 
Corp. on Thursday for firing three employees who tried to warn management that 
the firm's C-5B aircraft was defective and unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
The employees -- two internal auditors and a quality assurance representative 
-- were fired in 1985 by then-Lockheed Chairman Lawrence O. Kitchen after they 
had attempted to convince Kitchen that the giant Air Force transport was 
gravely flawed. They sued for wrongful termination. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed general counsel Joseph Twomey said the size of the punitive damages 
was "just outrageous." He vowed to attempt to overturn the verdict -- if 
necessary, appealing "all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court." 
</P>
<P>
Jurors in the Superior Court case said in interviews that they returned such a 
large penalty to send a message not only to Lockheed but also to the entire 
U.S. defense industry about improper practices in weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Hafif, the Claremont attorney who represented two of the plaintiffs, 
asserted that the award is a measure of public dissatisfaction with defense 
industry waste. Hafif called for a congressional investigation into the safety 
of the C-5B. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force has said the aircraft is not defective. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed can handle the award financially, analysts said. After taxes, it would 
amount to $30 million. The Calabasas-based aerospace firm has an estimated $100 
million cash on hand and is expected to generate profits this year of $315 
million, according to securities analyst Lawrence M. Harris of Bateman Eichler, 
Hill Richards. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Lockheed has had a difficult year. The Navy cancelled Lockheed's 
P-7A aircraft program for non-performance. McDonnell Douglas fired Lockheed as 
a subcontractor on the C-17 aircraft program. And Texas financier Harold 
Simmons has attempted to wrest control of the company from current management. 
</P>
<P>
In several weeks, Lockheed is scheduled to begin a trial before the Armed 
Services Board of Contract Appeals involving allegations that the firm 
overcharged the Air Force for the C-5B. The government's original claim was for 
$495 million, but it has been reduced substantially. 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's case, the three Lockheed employees alleged that improper heat 
treating of the main frames of the C-5B at Lockheed's plant in Burbank resulted 
in cracking, warping and other deformities starting in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The auditors, Clyde W. Jones Jr. and Terrence F. Schielke, said they were 
instructed by audit department executives to not undertake a formal 
investigation or write a report about the allegations, but they continued to 
attempt to sound warnings of the problems. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1985, the two auditors and plaintiff Thomas R. Benecke, a quality 
assurance expert, met with Kitchen and disclosed that they had hired an outside 
metallurgist at their own expense and had found that samples of the structural 
parts were defective. 
</P>
<P>
Kitchen testified Oct. 18 that he personally fired Schielke and Benecke 
becaused they acted unprofessionally, failed to conduct a formal audit of their 
own allegations and took property off company premises when they went to the 
outside metallurgist. Jones retired after he was threatened with firing, 
according to an internal Lockheed memorandum introduced as evidence in the 
seven-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
Though the case was brought on grounds of wrongful termination of the 
employees, the trial revolved around the key question of whether C-5B jets 
contain flawed parts. 
</P>
<P>
Hafif attempted to show -- and, according to jurors, succeeded -- that Lockheed 
did not perform certain tests to certify that a heat-treating oven was 
operating at the correct temperature. 
</P>
<P>
The employees alleged that the ovens operated at too high a temperature and 
caused "eutectic melting," in which certain metals inside the aluminum alloy 
melted, causing voids or cracks. 
</P>
<P>
The voids allegedly occurred in the C-5B's main frames -- the most important of 
a series of structures that form the fuselage of the aircraft and bear enormous 
loads while it flies. The frames were built and heat-treated by the Lockheed 
California Co. for the Lockheed Georgia Co., the prime contractor for the 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"The frames were cracked, warped, twisted," Schielke said Thursday. "And 
instead of scrapping them, they went ahead and used them, because it would have 
put them so far behind schedule to scrap them that the Defense Department would 
not have bought the planes." 
</P>
<P>
Kitchen testified that the employees "lied" about the problem and "claimed 
there was a management cover-up, and there was not." Kitchen said he did not 
learn about the auditors' concerns until the September, 1985, meeting. Schielke 
said, however, he told Kitchen in a 1984 meeting that a cover-up was going on. 
</P>
<P>
Twomey, the Lockheed attorney, said he believed the plaintiffs were successful 
because Hafif had diverted the attention of the jury from the issue of wrongful 
termination to a question of whether the aircraft are unsafe. Twomey said the 
aircraft is not defective. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of the punitive damages awarded is grossly disproportionate to the 
actual damages found by the jury and is insupportable factually and legally," 
he said, noting that only $376,514 of the verdict was for compensatory damages. 
"The company is confident that the verdict will not stand." 
</P>
<P>
Jurors said they distrusted Kitchen's testimony and were shocked by Lockheed's 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
"I will never fly on another Lockheed plane again -- and I fly a lot," said 
juror Jackey Grundman. "I just wonder what else is wrong with the rest of their 
airplanes." 
</P>
<P>
Juror Julio Barrious, an oil exploration geographer at Unocal Corp., said: "We 
felt that if taxpayers pay for a product, that we should get what we ask for 
and not something less. We felt that if we gave Lockheed a large (penalty), we 
would send out a message, not only to Lockheed but the defense industry."

COURT SAYS INSURERS CAN BE LIABLE FOR TOXIC CLEANUPS; 
</P>
<P>
POLLUTION: THE RULING BY THE STATE JUSTICES IS SEEN AS MAKING IT EASIER TO 
DECONTAMINATE WASTE SITES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a case with billions of dollars at stake, the state Supreme Court ruled 
Thursday that insurance companies may be forced to pay for government-ordered 
cleanups of toxic waste created by firms they insure. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, resolving a far-reaching issue raised in at least 17 pending 
cases, opened the way for policyholding polluters to invoke coverage, 
unanimously reversing a state appeal court ruling that had protected insurers 
against such claims. 
</P>
<P>
The high court decision represented not only a major victory for corporate 
policyholders but a triumph as well for state and local officials, who argued 
that including cleanup costs in coverage would lead to faster, more effective 
cleanups and thus protect public health. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for insurers, while disappointed with the ruling, noted that they still 
will be able to dispute coverage in individual cases. They may contend, for 
example, that an act of pollution was "willful" -- as in the case of a 
so-called "midnight dumper" -- and excluded under their policies. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of coverage has emerged in scores of cases around the country where 
officials have ordered toxic-waste cleanups under the federal environmental 
"superfund" law. Pending cases in California alone involve cleanup costs of 
more than $2 billion, according to attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts welcomed the ruling as a badly needed resolution of a hotly 
disputed issue. "The best thing to come out of this ruling will be to 
short-circuit much of the litigation and get down to the problem of obtaining 
environmental cleanups," said Jack Skelton, a Redwood City attorney who has 
represented both insurers and accused polluters. 
</P>
<P>
Polluting firms have argued that cleanup costs were covered as "damages" under 
comprehensive general liability policies. 
</P>
<P>
Insurers responded that such terminology was not intended for cleanups but only 
for monetary awards for injuries in court cases. If they ultimately were forced 
to pay for cleanup costs, insurers said in a brief to the court, reserves would 
be depleted, premiums would rise and insurance coverage would become less 
available. 
</P>
<P>
The high court, in a 60-page opinion by Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, 
concluded that the "plain and ordinary meaning" of the disputed "damage" 
terminology intended includes coverage for cleanup costs. The court did not 
consider other provisions that might affect coverage in individual cases. 
</P>
<P>
The justices cited the legal rule that ambiguous language must be resolved 
against the insurer. An attorney for FMC Corp., a Chicago-based chemical firm 
seeking insurance coverage in the case, said the ruling would have a "major 
impact" on pending cases and could lead to quicker, more effective cleanups. 
"Ambiguous terms are to be construed in favor of coverage," said David W. 
Steuber, a Los Angeles lawyer. "That's going to be extremely important as other 
courts address similar cases." 
</P>
<P>
The ruling also was welcomed by state Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, who said 
that in opening the way for insurer liability, the decision would promote 
privately funded cleanups "with minimum delay" and without "unnecessary public 
expense." 
</P>
<P>
State Deputy Atty. Gen. Timothy R. Patterson, who represented the state in the 
case, noted that while insurers still may raise other issues to contest 
coverage, the high court ruling "resolves the critical first question -- 
whether there can be coverage." 
</P>
<P>
"This decision will encourage settlements," Patterson said. "And settlements 
without lawsuits is just what Congress and the state of California wanted to 
achieve." 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Kaufman of Los Angeles, a lawyer for 62 cities and counties urging 
insurance coverage of polluters, said the ruling would help protect taxpayers 
from paying cleanup costs. "If the insurance companies had won this case, they 
would have hit a home run, because there would be no coverage," Kaufman said. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for the AIU Insurance Co., the insurer contesting FMC Corp.'s claim 
of coverage, expressed disappointment with the ruling but pointed out that the 
issue of coverage would not be finally resolved until issues of other 
provisions in policies are decided. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many other provisions and exclusions we believe will prevent 
insurance coverage in a vast number of cases," said Deborah A. Pitts of Los 
Angeles. Pitts added that lawyers would be considering whether to take the 
issue to the federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
The case before the court arose when state and federal authorities filed suits 
against FMC, alleging that the firm was responsible for contamination of 79 
hazardous-waste disposal sites throughout the United States. Officials sought 
court orders requiring the firm to remove the contaminants and reimburse 
government agencies for the investigation and initial stage of a cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
FMC, in turn, sought to invoke coverage for cleanup costs under the more than 
60 general liability policies issued by its insurers. But AIU and other 
insurers resisted, saying the policies did not cover such costs. A Santa Clara 
County Superior Court judge rejected the insurers' claims, but last year, a 
state appellate panel in San Jose reversed that decision, holding that the 
policies would not allow FMC to pass on the costs to its insurers. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides in the dispute urged the state Supreme Court to hear the dispute, 
citing conflicting rulings from other courts around the country and the 
presence of 17 suits pending in state courts. These cases -- some involving 
hundreds of millions of dollars in cleanup costs -- included disputes over the 
Stringfellow Acid Pits in Riverside, the Rocky Mountain Arsenal in Colorado and 
the Times Beach dioxin contamination in Missouri.

THOUSANDS OF ROMANIANS DEMAND A 2ND REVOLUTION; 
</P>
<P>
EASTERN EUROPE: ANGER FOCUSES ON PRICES, SHORTAGES. IT IS THE MOST SERIOUS 
PROTEST SINCE CEAUSESCU'S OUSTER.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angered by skyrocketing prices and perpetual shortages, nearly 200,000 
Romanians marched Thursday to demand a second revolution in the most serious 
outbreak of anti-government sentiment since last December's uprising. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations in Bucharest, Timisoara, Brasov and other large cities were 
organized to protest a Nov. 1 government decree allowing state producers to set 
prices for their goods according to what the market will bear while wages 
remain fixed and private enterprise severely limited. 
</P>
<P>
But the unexpectedly large street protests illustrated a deeper discontent with 
the course of political and economic reform in Romania, threatening turmoil as 
the new leadership acts to push the nation toward a market economy after half a 
century of Communist repression that was the worst in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"We fight. We work. We starve!" demonstrators chanted in Brasov as they marched 
through the Transylvanian city. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters denounced President Ion Iliescu, demanding his resignation and 
accusing his party of hijacking the anti-Communist revolt of a year ago that 
ousted and executed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the National Salvation Front government granted permission for the 
demonstrations in order to show tolerance toward dissent, and state-run 
television carried unusually detailed accounts of the events. It said that 
70,000 marched in Timisoara, birthplace of last year's revolution, in addition 
to the larger crowd in the capital and tens of thousands more in Constanta, 
Cluj, Brasov and Iasi. 
</P>
<P>
Police lined the protest routes but made no effort to interfere with the 
peaceful processions. 
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Baltazar Bogdan had predicted on the eve of the protest 
that few Romanians would bother to take part, describing those discontent with 
government policy as "a handful of troublemakers." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the government took defensive action in announcing early Thursday 
that salaries will soon become negotiable between employees and employers, to 
balance the effects of the price reforms, which doubled or tripled the cost of 
most goods. 
</P>
<P>
Necessities like bread, milk, meat and cooking oil were exempt from the price 
boosts announced months ahead by Prime Minister Petre Roman, and pensioners 
were simultaneously granted a special raise to help defray the new hardships. 
But even staples remain in short supply in state-run stores because of 
Romania's antiquated processing and distribution facilities, forcing many 
consumers to do without or buy at more expensive farmers' markets. 
</P>
<P>
Labor and Social Security Minister Catalin Zamfir said the new wage 
liberalization bill to be presented to Parliament would ease tensions resulting 
from the pricing changes. 
</P>
<P>
"Practically everybody will be able to earn as much as he wants, if he is 
good," Zamfir said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The leadership also sought to defuse tensions by declaring Thursday an official 
celebration in honor of a workers' uprising in Brasov three years ago to the 
day, now seen as a precursor to last year's revolt. 
</P>
<P>
The turnout of nearly 100,000 in Bucharest, despite the announced reforms, was 
likely a surprise for the National Salvation Front leadership, which won 
resounding victories in the May elections. 
</P>
<P>
"Eleven months of lies!" the Bucharest procession shouted, snowballing in size 
as it swept through the capital's center. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters denounced Iliescu as a Communist in reformer's clothing and 
accused his ruling circle of feasting off the fruit of the working man's 
labors. 
</P>
<P>
"Our last solution, another revolution!" the marchers chanted. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's demonstrations were initially called to commemorate the Nov. 15, 
1987, rioting in Brasov, about 130 miles north of Bucharest, in which an 
unknown number of protesters were killed by Ceausescu's Securitate secret 
police and more than 300 were arrested and tried as instigators. 
</P>
<P>
But the memorial served as a magnet for Romanians disappointed with the 
policies of their new government. 
</P>
<P>
"With our salaries, we cannot afford to buy anything," said Neicu Alexandru, a 
21-year-old worker at a metal fabricating plant in Bucharest. "Today (the 
leadership) is following the same lines the Communists used -- shortages for 
the populations so that the leaders can live the good life." 
</P>
<P>
The hostility seems directly targeted at Iliescu, who won a landslide 87% of 
the vote for president in elections that foreign observers described as 
"flawed." 
</P>
<P>
Once a member of the powerful Communist Party Central Committee under 
Ceausescu, Iliescu was politically exiled by the dictator, but returned to the 
political forefront after the revolution to lead the interim government in the 
National Salvation Front's election drive. 
</P>
<P>
Intellectuals and students, who make up the bulk of the anti-government 
protesters, have since accused Iliescu and his party of plotting to transfer to 
themselves the same monopoly on power and privilege enjoyed by Ceausescu and 
his Communist cronies. 
</P>
<P>
Several prominent figures in the overthrow of communism a year ago addressed 
the crowd of about 12,000 in Brasov. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not need hypocritical, violent demagogues," former dissident Doina 
Cornea told the crowd from a balcony overlooking the medieval City Hall Square, 
flanked by pastel-colored town houses. 
</P>
<P>
She alluded to Iliescu's actions in summoning a horde of miners to Bucharest in 
June to quell unrest with a two-day spree of random beatings and destruction of 
opposition party headquarters.

BUSH FIRM AS HUSSEIN ASSAILS 'PRECONDITIONS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein insisted Thursday that negotiations with the 
United States and Saudi Arabia are the only way to resolve the Persian Gulf 
crisis, but President Bush said he will not back down just "so you, sir, can 
have some face." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in separate television interviews, Bush blamed Iraq for the recent 
slowdown in the U.S. economy, and Hussein said the Persian Gulf crisis could 
end if the United States would stop insisting on "preconditions for 
capitulation." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who leaves Washington tonight on a seven-day trip to Europe, Saudi Arabia 
and Egypt that includes a Thanksgiving Day visit with U.S. troops in the gulf 
area, said that fears of war notwithstanding, the world cannot endure an 
indefinite stalemate in the region. 
</P>
<P>
His remarks came only a day after he assured congressional leaders that war 
with Iraq is not imminent and that he will give economic sanctions more time to 
pressure Iraq to withdraw its forces from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Bush expressed confidence that, if war breaks out, "I think 
the American people will support their President. I think they know I'm 
prudent." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a half-hour interview with Cable News Network in the White House 
Map Room, Bush said he is to blame, to some extent, if the nation is uncertain 
about why he has decided to send more than 400,000 troops to Saudi Arabia and 
nearby waters. 
</P>
<P>
"We're dealing with naked aggression, we're dealing with brutality 
unprecedented in recent times, and we're dealing with a threat to the national 
security of this country and other countries," he said, acknowledging that the 
television interview gave him an opportunity to once again state his 
objectives. 
</P>
<P>
Attributing a share of the nation's current economic problems to war jitters, 
Bush said: "Look what's happening in our own country right now. There's a 
slowdown, an economic slowdown. And it's a disproportionate increase in the 
price of oil that stems from what Saddam Hussein has done. . . . It does mean 
jobs." 
</P>
<P>
But, he suggested, the situation is worse in the Third World, where "the 
have-nots . . . are being driven to their knees by these (oil) prices." 
</P>
<P>
"The Iraq situation, with this speculative effect on the price of oil, has 
complicated and worsened our own economy and the economies of our neighbors and 
the economies of the rest of the world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The President held out little room for compromise with Hussein. Responding to 
suggestions that a deal could be worked out by providing Iraq with access to 
the Persian Gulf over land that lies within Kuwait, Bush said: 
</P>
<P>
"When you rape, pillage and plunder a neighbor, should you then ask the world: 
'Hey, give me a little face, give me a little face-saving, so I can do what I 
should have done months ago?' Should we be saying to him: 'We're going to 
reward your aggression by peeling off some part of somebody else's country?' " 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the foreigners held captive in Iraq, some as "human shields" 
against attacks on potential military targets, and to the Iraqi siege of 
foreign embassies in Kuwait city, the President continued: 
</P>
<P>
"Should we say the brutality to these hostages and the way you've treated these 
embassies should be rewarded in some way, so you, sir, can have some face? 
</P>
<P>
"The answer is no, there isn't going to be a compromise with this kind of naked 
aggression." 
</P>
<P>
Bush also said that once the crisis ends, there must be "some international 
guarantees" regarding future limits on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Hussein's chemical weapons and his efforts to develop nuclear 
weapons, he said: "I don't think the rest of the world would say this is good 
enough, just what they call the status quo ante, going back to where things 
were before the invasion" of Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd have to have some international safeguards," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The President has come under increasing pressure in recent days from Congress 
to provide a clearer explanation of his intentions in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.) called 
Bush "an inept communicator" and said he should better explain his reasons for 
the massive military deployment. 
</P>
<P>
Bush "has failed to convey to the public why we are in Saudi Arabia," Aspin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Aspin, a supporter of the President's gulf policy, added: "In defense of 
George Bush, this is not a simple thing to state. It's not a bumper-sticker 
kind of rationale. It's not 'making the world safe for democracy,' like it was 
in World War I." 
</P>
<P>
In the televised interview, Bush expressed irritation with his congressional 
critics, saying, "You can't have 435 commanders in chief. 
</P>
<P>
"I've read the Constitution. They have the right to declare war, and I have the 
right, as commander in chief, to fulfill my responsibilities," he said. 
"Individual congressmen may look at this differently than I do, and some are 
willing to tell me what not to do, but (they are) a little bit fuzzy and 
unclear on what to do." 
</P>
<P>
Although he refused to be pinned down on how long he would wait for the 
economic sanctions put in place by the U.N. Security Council to force Iraq to 
withdraw, he made clear that there are limits -- not only to his patience but 
to the patience of the public. 
</P>
<P>
"Holding public opinion forever in any country is very difficult to do," he 
said. "In any country, I think there is a ticking of the clock. . . . I don't 
think this matter is going to go on forever. As far as I'm concerned, it's 
not." 
</P>
<P>
Bush challenged assertions that there may be a parallel between the escalating 
involvement in the gulf and the Vietnam War, which began in the late 1950s with 
the deployment of small numbers of troops and grew over the following decade to 
a deployment of 530,000 American troops at one point. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not going to be any long, drawn-out agony of Vietnam," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in an interview with ABC News, Hussein insisted that there can be 
peace in the region only if an agreement is reached that is "comprehensive, 
complete and final." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Iraq's current position is negotiable, Hussein declared: "When I say 
something, I mean it." 
</P>
<P>
Just as Bush appeared to be holding firm in his insistence that there be no 
reward for Iraqi aggression, Hussein seemed to be seeking to open a split in 
the coalition against him by suggesting a readiness to bargain, as he has in 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
But he strongly rejected a pledge to withdraw from Kuwait as a precondition for 
peace talks. Bush's call for a withdrawal, he said, is "not dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
"These are preconditions for capitulation," Hussein said. "On what basis is 
there to be dialogue. . . ? Will he (Bush) continue imposing this boycott, this 
blockade, on us?" 
</P>
<P>
The two presidents addressed the gulf situation as American and Saudi forces 
inside Saudi Arabia began their most comprehensive joint exercise yet, 
involving more than 2,200 Marines, hundreds of Army commandos and as many as 
1,100 combat aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The large-scale maneuver, dubbed "Imminent Thunder," is intended to refine and 
test communications and cooperative procedures between the massive U.S. forces 
and their Saudi hosts, the Pentagon said. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials and independent military analysts have voiced concerns that 
if the allies decide to go to war against Iraqi troops, confusion over command 
relationships and complex lines of communication would hamper the effectiveness 
of the U.S.-led forces. 
</P>
<P>
The exercise includes a mock Marine landing 25 miles south of Saudi Arabia's 
border with Kuwait -- a move some lawmakers criticized as provocative.

U.S. AIR ACT CASTS DOUBT ON SUCCESS OF STATE CLEAN CAR PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
POLLUTION: REGULATORS SAY OIL FIRMS MUST SELL CLEAN FUELS, NOT JUST MAKE THEM 
AVAILABLE. CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAM TO REQUIRE CLEANER CARS MAY RIDE ON THE 
INTERPRETATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The success of a far-reaching plan to place millions of ultra-clean cars on the 
road in California was thrown into doubt Thursday when a dispute erupted 
between state air pollution authorities and the oil industry over a key 
provision of the new federal clean air act signed Thursday by President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
California air pollution regulators insisted that the new federal law requires 
oil companies to sell specific amounts of the clean fuels. 
</P>
<P>
Oil companies are strenuously challenging that interpretation, saying the 
legislation only requires that alternative fuels be "made available." 
</P>
<P>
The distinction could be important to the success of an ambitious program 
approved last September by the California Air Resources Board to force auto 
makers to begin building cleaner cars by 1997. Under the plan, every new car 
sold in the state by the year 2000 must be from 70% to 100% less polluting than 
cars in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
But there is concern that if alternative fuels such as methanol are not priced 
competitively, the clean air effort could be undermined, especially in the 
early years when many new cars may be designed to run on either gasoline or the 
cleaner fuels. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the (federal) law is clear . . . that the provisions that pertain 
specifically to California and that describe California's (clean vehicle) pilot 
program . . . include what we consider a sales mandate," state ARB spokesman 
Bill Sessa said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
ARCO Products Co. President George Babikian sees the new federal law another 
way. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't any sales quota in it. I fail to see how there can be any sales 
quota, and I'm reading it," Babikian said. 
</P>
<P>
The law does not specifically mention sales mandates or quotas but certain 
phrases having to do with production and distribution could be interpreted as 
requiring them. 
</P>
<P>
"If Congress wanted a mandate, it would have appeared in there -- 'mandated 
sales' -- without any weasel words in there," Babikian said. 
</P>
<P>
Babikian's view appears to be supported by remarks published in the 
Congressional Record Nov. 2 by Rep. Jack M. Fields (R-Tex.), a member of the 
House-Senate clean air conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Wilson, director of the Office of Mobile Sources at the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, said the new law "certainly seems to go beyond 
a simple (fuel) availability. . . . It seems to suggest that they have to move 
a certain volume of fuels." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the dispute eventually may have to be settled in court. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the ARB in September had rejected inserting a sales quota into the 
state plan after intense lobbying by Babikian and other oil industry 
executives. ARB staff members had proposed the quota. 
</P>
<P>
Regional air pollution officials, anticipating the state's action, urged 
Congress to include such a mandate in the federal law, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the reasons California people were working so hard to get 
language put in the clean air act to shore them up in this regard,' said 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sessa, the federal law supersedes the ARB plan. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Sessa said the ARB staff believes California's program must be 
amended to include a fuel sales quota to conform with the federal law. 
</P>
<P>
Babikian said alternative fuels are likely to cost more and will require a 
subsidy to keep them competitive. He suggested that "dirty gasoline" be taxed, 
with the proceeds used to launch cleaner fuels. But he said the public should 
be informed of any subsidies.

$1-BILLION AUSTERITY PLAN URGED AS STATE REVENUES DIVE;

BUDGET: THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL INCLUDES CUTS IN VOTER-APPROVED GUARANTEES FOR 
SCHOOLS AND A HIRING FREEZE.

With state tax revenues falling far below expected levels, Gov. George 
Deukmejian on Thursday proposed an instant $1-billion austerity program in 
California that would include the suspension of voter-approved guarantees for 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's surprise announcement put a damper on what had been expected to be 
a congenial meeting with Gov.-elect Pete Wilson to begin the transfer of power 
leading to Wilson's swearing-in on Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to cutting school funding by $526 million, Deukmejian's plan would 
freeze state hiring, cut all state budgets except higher education by 1%, and 
reduce the renters' tax credit. Most of the plan would have to be approved by 
the Legislature, which earlier this year rejected Deukmejian's attempt to 
suspend Proposition 98's requirement that about 40% of the budget go to 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
The governor ruled out any tax increase, saying that voters on Nov. 6 made it 
"plainly clear" by rejecting several expensive ballot measures that they "don't 
want to pay higher taxes." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said he and his top fiscal aides briefed Wilson on the problem 
during a luncheon and three-hour meeting Thursday afternoon. The governor-elect 
spoke briefly with reporters before leaving the Capitol but addressed the 
budget only in generalities, deferring to Deukmejian whenever pressed to 
comment on the potential deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian told reporters that Wilson believes the current Administration 
should resolve the budget crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"He did indicate to me he thought it was very prudent of me to make a proposal 
now to try to get on top of this new developing situation just as quickly as 
possible," Deukmejian said of Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to cut school money drew a sharp reply from state schools Supt. 
Bill Honig, who has battled Deukmejian over the education budget for several 
years. Honig said many of the state's school districts are in bad fiscal 
condition and can ill afford budget cuts halfway through the academic year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not surprising," Honig said of the proposal. "Deukmejian has been against 
education consistently. I suppose with his last breath in office he'll keep 
trying to take money away from school kids." 
</P>
<P>
The dire budget situation became clear Thursday when the legislative analyst's 
office reported that tax collections during October dropped a whopping $250 
million because of the downturn in the economy. When revenue shortfalls in 
July, August and September are added in, it means that state officials now are 
short by $408 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It is too early to hit the panic button, but there definitely are some 
problems, some black clouds on the horizon," said Elizabeth G. Hill, the 
nonpartisan legislative analyst. 
</P>
<P>
The day began with a cordial luncheon meeting between Deukmejian and Wilson, 
the first for the two Republican leaders since the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, at least, the budget problems were set aside when Deukmejian and 
Wilson got together for their first face-to-face meeting since the Nov. 6 
election. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't be any happier," said a smiling Deukmejian, noting it has been 36 
years since governors from the same party served consecutively. Gov. Goodwin J. 
Knight, formerly lieutenant governor, succeeded fellow Republican Earl Warren 
in 1953 when Warren was appointed chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
When Deukmejian took office, the state faced a $1.5-billion shortfall and he 
has said he would not leave his successor with a similar budget problem. 
Deukmejian until Thursday had contended that despite the drop-off in revenues 
the state would finish this year in the black. 
</P>
<P>
As for the report from budget analyst Hill, it showed that the largest decline 
has been in the sales tax, which is down $168 million over the last four 
months. Personal income tax collections are off $111 million, followed by bank 
and corporation tax receipts, off $92 million. Various other tax collections 
are down a total of $37 million. 
</P>
<P>
The hard numbers released Thursday come on top of earlier estimates from Hill 
that the state will be $1.1 billion short of what it will need during the next 
budget year to provide state services. 
</P>
<P>
The October drop must be added to the $1.1-billion estimate because the two 
figures combined represent a shortfall that Wilson will have to deal with both 
to get through the current budget year and to prepare his first budget as 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the problem could get larger in the coming months if the economy 
does not improve. October is one of the lowest revenue-producing months. Almost 
twice as much money comes in during December, reflecting the Christmas shopping 
season, and nearly three times as much in April, when income taxes are due.

DRUG CZAR CALLS STATE SOFT ON OFFENDERS; 
</P>
<P>
NARCOTICS: WILLIAM BENNETT, WHO IS RETIRING, ACCUSES CALIFORNIA OF LENIENT 
SENTENCING. STATE OFFICIALS DENY IT.

<P>
Sentencing of drug offenders in California is "notoriously weak," forcing 
federal authorities to shoulder a disproportionate share of the burden of 
apprehending violators in the state, William J. Bennett, departing director of 
the nation's war on drugs, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, who issued a "white paper" on the status of state drug-control 
efforts, said that law enforcement authorities throughout California have told 
him that drug suspects often ask arresting officers: "Are you state or are you 
fed?" 
</P>
<P>
They breathe "a sigh of relief if it's a state authority," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the federal effort to combat illicit narcotics unprecedented, Bennett 
said that "even the best federal efforts can be undermined when states fail to 
follow suit." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, who is leaving his post as director of the White House Office of Drug 
Control Policy at the end of the month, attributed the problem in California to 
weak laws and judges who mete out "too light" punishment for drug violators. 
</P>
<P>
For marijuana possession, Bennett said, "You can be written a ticket -- a fine, 
and that is it. . . . We think the law is soft there." 
</P>
<P>
Possession of less than an ounce of marijuana in California carries a maximum 
$100 fine and no jail time, while possession of more than an ounce can subject 
the offender to six months in jail or a $500 fine or both, according to the 
state attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett's criticism drew an immediate challenge from Brian Taugher, a special 
assistant attorney general in Sacramento who said that the assessment reflected 
the situation in California in the 1970s, not the current picture. 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of drug offenders sent to prison jumped from 6.7% in 1980 to 
20.6% last year, Taugher said. Those receiving probation dropped from 36% in 
1980 to 8% in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"What's happened here is that we've built the largest prison system probably in 
the world -- bigger than the federal -- and we're awash in drug offenders," 
Taugher said. 
</P>
<P>
The number of felony new admissions in state prisons for drug offenses 
increased 418% between 1983 and 1988, Taugher said. 
</P>

"We have a conservative governor who is leaving office, who is very proud of 
the judges he appointed -- most of them from prosecutors' offices," Taugher 
said. "It would be hard to say they are soft on drug offenders." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, who also criticized New York for its handling of drug violators, said 
that in both states "major trafficking goes on, and there's a lot of (drug) 
consumption." California and New York, he said, "should be sending the clearest 
and most emphatic messages" against traffickers and users. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett said that California and other states with softer laws should toughen 
them to avoid an invasion of drug offenders from states with tougher sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
"If laws in Nevada and Arizona continue to get tougher and California laws 
don't, California could possibly see even more trafficking," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
A state drug-control status table distributed by Bennett showed California 
spending more of its funds -- 8% -- for criminal justice outlays in 1988 than 
any other state in the union and admitting more drug abuse "clients" to 
state-funded programs -- 35,297 -- than any other state.

RAISE FOR GOVERNOR, LEGISLATORS ENDORSED; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: PANEL THAT WAS ESTABLISHED BY PROPOSITION 112 ALSO PLANS TO GIVE 
EXTRA PAY TO LEGISLATIVE LEADERS. BOARD LEADERS SAY THEY DO NOT FEAR PUBLIC 
OUTRAGE.

The annual salary of the governor of California would rise from $85,000 to 
$120,000, ordinary legislators would get an increase in base pay from $40,816 
to $52,500, and for the first time legislative leaders would get a salary 
premium, according to tentative decisions made Thursday by a voter-approved 
salary commission. 
</P>
<P>
The California Citizens Compensation Commission, five Republicans and two 
Democrats appointed by Gov. George Deukmejian, was given authority to set the 
salaries of elected state constitutional officers and legislators by 
Proposition 112, passed in the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks after two sparsely attended public hearings, the commission, 
under the chairmanship of Claude S. Brinegar, secretary of transportation in 
the Nixon Administration, acted unanimously and with little discussion. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent passage of Proposition 140, indicating voter disapproval of 
legislators, Brinegar said, "I'm not worried about public outrage. Our 
assignment is to provide salaries that are fair and equitable. We looked at 
salaries in comparable jobs in other states and the cities and counties. We 
tried to say, 'Here's what fairness suggests,' and not pay attention to the 
political atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Brinegar, now a vice chairman of Union Oil, said the commission will give the 
public a last chance to have its say at a hearing in Sacramento on Nov. 30, and 
at the conclusion of that meeting make its final salary rulings. What 
discussion there was Thursday in a Union Oil meeting room in downtown Los 
Angeles indicated that the tentative decisions are unlikely to change. 
</P>
<P>
The new salaries will go into effect Dec. 3, and next July 1 the commission 
will set salaries for 1992. Slaries will then be updated annually. 
</P>
<P>
According to the tentative decisions made Thursday, the attorney general's 
annual salary will be increased from $77,500 to $102,000, the superintendent of 
public instruction's from $72,500 to $102,000, and those of the state 
controller, treasurer, secretary of state and lieutenant governor from $72,500 
to $90,000. 
</P>
<P>
The post of insurance commissioner, which was an appointive job and has been 
changed to an elective position, was given no salary increase, nor were members 
of the State Board of Equalization. They will remain at an annual $95,052. The 
commission agreed that paying these officials more than the governor would be 
an anomaly. 
</P>
<P>
As for legislative leaders, the commissioners tentatively decided that the 
Assembly Speaker and Senate president pro tem should get 20%, or $10,500, above 
the $52,500 given to ordinary legislators, while the majority and minority 
leaders in each chamber should be given 10%, or $5,250 more. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators, in addition to a 29% raise, also will continue to receive benefits 
and expense allowances worth $25,000 to $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
After praising Deukmejian, Assembly Speaker Willie L. Brown (D-San Francisco) 
and Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti (D-Los Angeles) for hard work, the 
commission tentatively gave those officials the largest percentage increases. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, however, would get the governor's 41% increase only for the month 
of December, since he did not stand for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Commission member George Nesterczuk of Falls Church, Va., a management 
consultant and friend of Deukmejian's executive secretary, Michael Frost, said 
he felt that since Proposition 140 eliminates pensions, it would be a good idea 
for the commission to compensate the legislators by giving them more in base 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
Brinegar first expressed a mild reservation, but quickly agreed that if the 
courts later upset the pension provision of Proposition 140, the commission 
could readjust the salaries downward. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, the commissioners were content to follow Brinegar's lead. Only John 
R. Ohanesian, a vice president of St. John's Hospital and Health Center in 
Santa Monica, and Steven F. Hayward, a director of a public policy research 
group at the Claremont Institute, expressed any uneasiness at starting off the 
commission's work with sizable salary increases. 
</P>
<P>
The commission staff provided the members with comparative charts showing that 
many city and county officials in California receive as much or more than 
California state officials would get under the new state salary schedules. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Foster, new executive director of California Common Cause, said that some 
of the proposed increases, particularly for the governor, were too high. Common 
Cause was instrumental in drafting Proposition 112, the ethics initiative that, 
among other things, set up the new commission.

BUSH LIKELY TO VETO BILL ON GAS, BIOLOGICAL ARMS 
</P>

<P>
President Bush is likely to veto legislation this week that would impose stiff 
penalties on countries or companies that assist in the development of chemical 
and biological weapons, White House officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The sensitive legislation has been the subject of a long fight within the 
government that has put Bush in a difficult position. As vice president, he 
took the lead in proposing global limits on chemical weapons, and as President, 
he has continued to press that campaign. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the debate is the legislation's use of mandatory sanctions 
against countries that produce, acquire or use chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
At the White House and State Department, the sanction provisions were seen as 
"an invasion of the President's prerogatives" and congressional 
"micromanagement" of the Adminstration's conduct of foreign policy, a White 
House official said. 
</P>
<P>
"The downside is, you don't want to appear to be soft on chemical weapons when 
you're opposing (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein," the official said. Despite 
that potential peril, he added, "strong indications are (that) it's going to be 
vetoed." 
</P>
<P>
At the Pentagon, officials argued that a veto, coming just as Bush is about to 
begin a trip in which he will visit U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia on Thanksgiving 
Day, would demoralize troops already made fearful by Iraq's chemical and 
biological weapons arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon agreed that the mandatory sanctions are undesirable, "but it could 
be worse," a Pentagon official said. "The bill isn't perfect, but it is 
probably as good as you're going to get right now and, if it is vetoed, 
Congress could come back with worse." 
</P>
<P>
"We damned it with faint praise, and the State Department was actively against 
it," he added. 
</P>
<P>
California Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), one of the proponents of the 
measure, said the veto would be "a triumph of obstinate ideology over morality 
and American interests. 
</P>
<P>
"It will send a signal that chemical weapons use won't be punished," Levine 
said in a statement issued by his office. "A veto would undermine the 
President's own policy." 
</P>
<P>
The chemical weapons sanctions are contained in a renewal of the Export 
Administration Act, which would ease controls on exports to Eastern Europe and 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has until Saturday to sign or veto the bill -- or, as is likely in this 
case, let it die because he has not signed it when Congress is not in session, 
a so-called pocket veto. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, more than any recent President, has sought to put a public focus on the 
issue of chemical weapons. He made the issue a central element in his first 
presidential speech to the United Nations in 1989.

U.S. CONCERNED ABOUT SHIFT OF TANKS TO SIBERIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Only days before the scheduled signing of a sweeping European arms control 
treaty, U.S. officials expressed concern Thursday about the shift of thousands 
of Soviet tanks from Eastern Europe to Siberian territory not covered by the 
new pact. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet tanks and other armored vehicles moved east of the Ural Mountains 
cannot be excluded in calculating arms cutbacks required by the Conventional 
Forces in Europe treaty, a high U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
While Soviet negotiators have given assurances that some of the the weapons and 
equipment already have been destroyed and most of the rest will be scrapped 
later, U.S. officials said a team of American specialists has been sent to 
Moscow to get more precise information. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a footnote, not the focus," one Bush Administration official said, 
noting that the Soviet Union has been pulling back its forces from Europe for 
nearly two years with U.S. encouragement. "But we want to get a handle on it." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the tanks have been left in unprotected outdoor depots, exposed to the 
weather, according to Administration officials. U.S. satellite cameras also can 
detect stockpiles of Soviet arms that exceed the new ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
At any rate, U.S. officials added, the tanks issue will not interfere with the 
planned signing of the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty in Paris on Monday 
by President Bush, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and heads of 20 other 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Warsaw Pact nations. 
</P>
<P>
The treaty, negotiated in a remarkably short 20-month period, is aimed at 
reducing Cold War tensions between East and West by bringing the former 
antagonists to military parity in a huge area stretching from the Atlantic to 
the Urals. 
</P>
<P>
Even before agreement was reached, the Soviet Union was making major troop 
reductions in Eastern Europe as it relaxed its political grip on Warsaw Pact 
members such as Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Poland. 
</P>
<P>
The treaty would make many of those arms reductions legally binding and give 
assurances to Moscow that the West would not build up its forces beyond the 
treaty levels. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the treaty, each side would be able to keep 20,000 battle 
tanks, 30,000 other armored vehicles, 20,000 artillery pieces, 6,800 combat 
planes and 2,000 attack helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the agreement is a victory for the Administration, since 
cutbacks in tanks and other heavy weapons will be far greater for the East than 
for NATO. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the day before the arms reduction agreement is to be signed, both 
sides will exchange information about the size of their non-nuclear forces in 
Europe. They will have 40 months to destroy weapons that exceed the ceilings 
set in the treaty.

U.S. URGED TO LEAD IN SAVING ANTARCTIC; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE WILL PROPOSE THAT THE CONTINENT BE 
DESIGNATED A WORLD SCIENCE PARK.

The United States risks losing an unusual opportunity to assert global 
leadership in protecting Antarctica, Sen. Albert Gore (D-Tenn.) said Thursday 
on the eve of an international conference on the future of the frozen 
continent. 
</P>
<P>
Gore spoke at a news conference sponsored by the Alliance for Antarctica, a 
coalition of environmental groups. It is calling on the United States and other 
nations participating in the conference, which begins Monday in Chile, to 
designate Antarctica as a world science park. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Bruce Vento (D-Minn.), chairman of the House Interior subcommittee on 
parks and public land, said he fears that recurring degradation has made 
Antarctica "an environmental time bomb ready to explode." 
</P>
<P>
"We have no time for half-measures if America is to be the world's leader in 
protecting Antarctica," Vento said. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional legislation calling for preservation of Antarctica is awaiting 
President Bush's signature, but there has been speculation that the Interior 
Department might urge Bush to veto the measure. The legislation for the first 
time would apply U.S. environmental protection laws to any activity in 
Antarctica sponsored by an agency of the U.S. government. It also would 
prohibit U.S. exploration or development of minerals in Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
The United States "should be leading the way and trying to protect the island 
instead of trying to protect the mineral convention," said Rep. Wayne Owens 
(D-Utah), who introduced the measure in the House. Gore was its Senate sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
The focus of a dispute between Congress and the State Department is the 
ratification of the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resources 
Activities, on which the State Department has worked for six years. 
</P>
<P>
The convention, signed two years ago but not ratified by 17 of 20 nations, 
would regulate mineral exploration but not ban it, as the congressional action 
would. The French and Australian governments are now against the accord, saying 
that no international agreement that would endorse even strictly regulated 
exploitation of Antarctic mineral resources could be acceptable to either 
government. If all 20 nations do not ratify the pact, it is dead. 
</P>
<P>
Mining in the Antarctic is not compatible with the protection of the 
continent's fragile environment, many environmentalists contend. French 
oceanologist Jacques Cousteau, in an interview with the New York Times last 
year, declared that an oil spill in the Antarctic could damage the food chain 
for decades and affect the entire hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
But Tucker Scully, director of the office of ocean affairs at the State 
Department and the lead U.S. negotiator for Antarctic issues, disagreed with 
the hands-off approach to the continent. "Creating a world park is to stick 
one's head in the sand," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to environmentalists, Antarctica is being marred by air pollution and 
tourist ships and threatened by mining. They also believe that the continent is 
being damaged by scientists who come to unlock its mysteries. They burn their 
garbage in pits and dump their junk in a landfill by the sea, they charge. 
</P>
<P>
"We treated Antarctica like a frontier town," said R. N. Andersen, the National 
Science Foundation's deputy general counsel. Congress has funded a five-year, 
$30-million program to clean up the Antarctic environment. More than 76 
scientific projects are now under way on the continent. 
</P>
<P>
During the peak summer months, about 4,000 people inhabit Antarctica, and 
tourism is increasing rapidly. Last year, about 3,000 people paid more than 
$10,000 each to photograph penguins and view the vast sweeps of ice and rock.

RADICALS BREAK UP BERLIN COALITION OVER CRACKDOWN

The radical Alternative List broke up Berlin's ruling coalition Thursday in 
protest at the use of force to evict militant squatters from 13 occupied 
tenement buildings in the former Communist east of the German capital city. 
</P>
<P>
The ecologist-leftist group, junior partner since 1989 in a Social 
Democratic-dominated city government, accused Mayor Walter Momper of using 
force as a substitute for a political solution to Berlin's chronic housing 
shortage. 
</P>
<P>
The List pulled out of the coalition just two weeks before a new city 
Parliament for the whole of reunited Berlin is to be elected. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious wave of violence in Berlin for a decade, with street battles 
resembling a civil war, abated overnight after rioters enraged by the evictions 
had again attacked police, wrecked cars and looted shops. 
</P>
<P>
Small groups of sympathizers rampaged in the west German cities of Cologne, 
Wuppertal and Muenster, smashing shop and bank windows during the night, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Momper accused the Alternative List of choosing solidarity with violent 
radicals who attacked the police with gasoline bombs, stones and iron bars, 
rather than upholding the rule of law. 
</P>
<P>
He said the city government is prepared to negotiate leases with peaceful 
squatters in 115 other eastern Berlin buildings and will work as fast as 
possible to renovate about 25,000 derelict properties there.

BUSH APPROVAL RATING SLIPS, 2 POLLS FIND 
</P>

Americans are beginning to have more reservations about President Bush's 
handling of his job, according to two separate polls released today. 
</P>
<P>
A survey by Times Mirror found that overall support for the President has 
dipped to 49%, the lowest point in his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
A separate poll by the Los Angeles Times found the President's approval rating 
at 61%, but more people were equivocal in their support than earlier. Only 23% 
approved "strongly" of Bush's job performance, while 38% approved only 
"somewhat." 
</P>
<P>
In August, shortly after the President announced he was sending troops to the 
Persian Gulf, that was reversed, with 41% of Americans "strongly" supporting 
Bush while 34% said they "somewhat" approved. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between the two polls is largely one of survey methodology, 
polling professionals said. The Times Poll prods interviewees for a response 
while the other poll, conducted by the Times Mirror Center for The People &amp; 
The Press, does not. As a result, the Times Mirror survey has a higher 
percentage of people who have no opinion about Bush -- 21% vs. only 5% in The 
Times Poll. 
</P>
<P>
Both of today's surveys found that about a third of Americans disapprove of the 
President's performance, 30% in the Times Mirror survey and 34% in The Times 
Poll. 
</P>
<P>
That is almost twice as many Americans who disapprove as compared with those 
who did in August or indeed for most of this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what is significant is that people are becoming more equivocal about 
the President," said Andrew Kohut, director of surveys for Times Mirror Center 
for The People &amp; The Press. 
</P>
<P>
Most other public surveys also show Bush's support down since late August, with 
support ranging from 58% in a Gallup Poll after the Nov. 6 elections to 52% in 
a New York Times/CBS Poll just before the elections. 
</P>
<P>
The Times Mirror Poll interviewed 1,208 adults between Nov. 8-11 and has a 
margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. The Times Poll 
interviewed 1,031 on Nov. 14 and also has a sampling error of plus or minus 
three percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
By any poll, Bush has lost whatever boost in support he won for his early 
handling of the Persian Gulf crisis. That may be significant as he tries to 
manage what Karlyn H. Keene, editor of American Enterprise magazine, called the 
second and more critical phase of the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
After the crisis began, three-quarters of Americans approved of Bush's 
performance in building an international coalition to send troops to Saudi 
Arabia, according to most surveys. Bush's overall support had been gradually 
sliding to about 60% before the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
His popularity began to dwindle again in September as Congress and the White 
House began having problems agreeing on a budget. 
</P>
<P>
Several polls, including those by Gallup and ABC, have seen Bush regain small 
amounts of his support since the budget controversy was resolved. 
</P>
<P>
In other findings in the Times Mirror survey: 
</P>
<P>
The public was more positive about political commercials in the recent election 
than in 1988. More Americans felt the commercials provided useful information 
than before, and pluralities of blacks and adults under 30 actually thought 
commercials were better sources of information than news reports. 
</P>
<P>
Only 25% of Americans were very satisfied with the outcome of the elections, 
while 48% were only somewhat satisfied. Twenty-two percent were dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
Of those who admitted to not voting, only a third said they wished they had 
participated.

MAN IS ARRESTED ON TIP BY SON, 9 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 9-year-old Canoga Park boy told police his father used cocaine, leading to 
the father's arrest, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Lee Hain Sr., 35, was arrested Tuesday and held on suspicion of felony 
child endangerment for using cocaine in the boy's presence, Los Angeles Police 
Sgt. Roger Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers entered Hain's home in the 22000 block of Saticoy Street with a search 
warrant and found narcotics paraphernalia and paper work indicating drug 
transactions, Ferguson said. Two men who were also in the house at the time of 
the search were arrested on suspicion of being under the influence of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
The warrant was issued because "the 9-year-old told authorities that his dad 
was doing cocaine inside the house," the sergeant said.

BABY'S BIRTH OFFERS NEW CHANCE OF LIFE FOR BROTHER

<P>
When little Ricky Reed's mother gave birth to a 7-pound, 9-ounce girl, he got 
more than the little sister he had always wanted. 
</P>
<P>
He got another chance at life. 
</P>
<P>
Her bone marrow has proved a perfect match to that of her older brother, who 
has leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
Five-year-old Ricky has battled both the physical and emotional roller-coaster 
of remissions and active outbreaks of the disease while undergoing chemotherapy 
and radiation treatments for more than two years. He now is in remission once 
again. 
</P>
<P>
His best hope for survival is to have his infected bone marrow replaced with 
healthy marrow -- the thick, almost granular substance within the bone 
structure that manufactures the blood's red and white cells. 
</P>
<P>
But none of the 210,000 people listed in the National Bone Marrow Program could 
provide a match. Bone marrow matches among the general population are 
1-to-20,000 long shots at best. Chances are much better -- 1 in 4 -- that bone 
marrow will prove compatible among blood relatives. But neither Ricky's parents 
nor his younger brother were a match, either. 
</P>
<P>
Then Theresa and Ricardo Reed learned they were expecting their third child. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially, when we learned we were going to have another baby, we just 
thought, 'Wow!' It wasn't until a few days later . . . that we found out that 
the new baby could be a bone marrow match," said Ricardo Reed, a Navy corpsman 
stationed on base. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, after seven hours of labor at the Navy hospital at Camp Pendleton, 
Raeana Melissa was born. On Wednesday, tests at the UCLA Medical Center showed 
her marrow was an exact match with Ricky's. 
</P>
<P>
"She's our miracle baby," said Theresa Reed. "Our ups and downs have gone from 
zero (hope) to this." 
</P>
<P>
Ricky's doctor, Navy Capt. William Thomas at the naval hospital at San Diego's 
Balboa Park, said he hopes the transplant can occur in about three months. 
Usually, newborns aren't tapped for marrow until they're 6 months old. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we can wait that long," he said. "Ricky might go into another 
relapse." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the controversial case of a Los Angeles couple whose baby, born earlier 
this year, was conceived to provide marrow for their stricken teen-age 
daughter, this baby was not conceived as the source of Ricky's cure, Theresa 
said. "It's really something to think that he could be saved by his sister."

EX-PRISONER WHO EXPOSED 'RAMBO SQUAD' GETS $40,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orned (Chicken) Gabriel, a martial-arts expert whose complaints about inmate 
abuse at the El Cajon jail exposed the so-called "Rambo Squad" of deputies, has 
accepted a $40,000 settlement from the county for what he said was a severe 
beating by jail deputies nearly three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel, 40, jailed between February and September 1988 for failing to pay 
child support, contacted reporters and the American Civil Liberties Union 
shortly after he entered jail and complained about numerous civil rights 
violations, from inmate beatings to illegal lockdowns. 
</P>
<P>
His allegations sparked investigations by the Grand Jury and the FBI, and 
eventually led Sheriff John Duffy to discipline 10 deputies, including several 
high-ranking officers, as part of what inmates called the "Rambo Squad." Duffy 
at first contended that Gabriel made up the story. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel's lawsuit against the county alleged that deputies grabbed him from his 
jail cell in March 1988, handcuffed him, pushed his face into a wall and pulled 
him by handcuffs down several flights of stairs into solitary confinement, 
where they ran his head into a bedpost. Gabriel said that, although seven 
deputies were involved, three actually were responsible for the beating. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me they'd wipe the smile off my face, (but) I'm still smiling," 
Gabriel said Thursday. "They told me the most I could hope for was $20,000. I 
got $40,000. They told me I couldn't beat the county. I beat the county." 
</P>
<P>
Three county attorneys, all involved with the case, did not return several 
telephone calls left at their offices Thursday. Duffy also did not return 
telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff-elect Jim Roache, who takes office Jan. 7., said the settlement was 
good for the county. 
</P>
<P>
"We got off quite cheap, frankly," he said. "Undoubtedly, protracted litigation 
would have cost us more than $40,000. I'm sure the county felt it was more 
expeditious and less costly to settle out of court." 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel's settlement with the county Wednesday came during the third federal 
magistrate's hearing to seek a resolution before the case went to trial next 
month. County attorneys, arguing that Gabriel greatly exaggerated the extent of 
his injuries, offered him $20,000. Gabriel had asked for $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
A black-belt karate expert who once operated five martial-arts studios in the 
county, Gabriel saw the popularity of the sport diminish in the 1980s. During 
that time, Gabriel said he became heavily involved with drugs and could not 
meet about eight months of child support payments, which landed him in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Almost from the moment he entered jail, Gabriel said, he was harassed by 
deputies, who knew he was skilled in karate. Shortly after he contacted the 
ACLU, Gabriel said some of his mail was intercepted and opened. Gabriel also 
sought to contact Sagon Penn, a former student and family friend, who was twice 
tried and acquitted in the 1985 slaying of a San Diego police officer and the 
wounding of another officer and a civilian ride-along. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Wheeler, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union who helped 
investigate Gabriel's claims, praised the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"I think $40,000 is a substantial amount of money in many respects," she said. 
"It is one more reminder of the substantial cost government officials must pay 
when they don't comply with the Constitution and don't make sure that the civil 
liberties of inmates are protected." 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Gabriel played a very important role in bringing to light what was 
happening in the El Cajon jail and the jail system overall," she said. "He took 
on quite a great deal of risk and was publicly held up to ridicule by Sheriff 
Duffy to make Mr. Gabriel look like a liar and a bad person when, in fact, his 
complaints were validated by the Grand Jury." 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1988, two months after Gabriel filed his claim, Duffy announced that 
Gabriel and other inmates had "deliberately contrived" their story for 
publicity. At the time, Duffy released a five-page summary of the Sheriff's 
Department's internal affairs investigation into the matter, concluding that 
deputies used no excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel would not have been entitled to punitive damages against the deputies 
involved with the "Rambo Squad" because his former attorney did not file the 
lawsuit naming the deputies before the statute of limitations expired, George 
de la Flor, Gabriel's attorney, said. Gabriel, therefore, was limited in suing 
only the county, and, by law, could not collect punitive damages. De la Flor 
said he has filed a malpractice lawsuit against Gabriel's former lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
During previous settlement hearings, De la Flor said county attorneys 
questioned Gabriel's injuries because he had only $500 in medical bills and 
participated in karate tournaments after he left jail. De la Flor argued that 
Gabriel received free medical care. Gabriel said he was forced to enter 
tournaments to make money. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel was reluctant to go to trial, he said, because he did not have the 
money it took to hire an orthopedic surgeon who might substantiate his injuries 
to a jury. The county already had hired its own expert, who was willing to 
testify that Gabriel was not severely hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel said he would take $30,000 of the settlement and pay $10,000 to De la 
Flor. De la Flor said he is entitled to one-third of the settlement, or 
$13,333. Both said they could work out the disagreement.

BRODERICK JUDGE GIVES 5 OPTIONS AS JURY GETS CASE; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: THE LA JOLLA SOCIALITE MAKES HER COURT APPEARANCE IN JAIL CLOTHES AND 
CALLS IT A PROTEST AGAINST RULINGS THAT SUPPRESSED INFORMATION DURING HER 
MURDER TRIAL. 
</P>

<P>
As jurors began deciding her double-murder trial, La Jolla socialite Elisabeth 
Anne (Betty) Broderick showed up in court Thursday wearing jail-issue sweat 
clothes to protest what she viewed as unfair treatment during the case. 
</P>
<P>
Upset at rulings that kept from jurors almost all of her secret diaries and the 
extensive file from a bitter divorce, Broderick wore a gray sweat shirt, blue 
sweat pants and sneakers to face the jury for the final time before it got the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm protesting," she whispered to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge Thomas Whelan, who made the rulings barring the 
bulk of the diaries and the file, did not say anything to the jurors about 
Broderick's choice of dress. He instructed them on their five options in the 
case -- two levels of murder, two degrees of manslaughter and not guilty on any 
charges -- and told them to begin deciding it. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick, 43, is charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the 
Nov. 5, 1989, shooting deaths of her ex-husband, attorney Daniel T. Broderick 
III, and his new wife, Linda Kolkena Broderick. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick has pleaded not guilty and has been held at the Las Colinas 
Jail in Santee since she turned herself in to police hours after the killings. 
She could be sentenced to life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Broderick, who was 44, was a prominent medical malpractice attorney and 
a former president of the San Diego County Bar Assn. Linda Kolkena Broderick, 
who was 28, was his office assistant. 
</P>
<P>
After 16 years of marriage, Betty and Daniel Broderick separated in 1985. 
During and after their bitter divorce, which took four years to conclude, she 
accused him of cheating her out of her fair share of his million-dollar annual 
income. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick admits firing the shots that killed her ex-husband and his 
second wife. She contended at the trial that she did not have the premeditation 
the law requires for first-degree murder because she intended only to confront 
him and to kill himself last Nov. 5, when she stole into his house before dawn. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry Wells, the prosecutor in the case, contends that Betty 
Broderick fully intended the killings and executed her ex-husband and his new 
wife after years of rising rage that stemmed from the divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Whelan told jurors Thursday that their five options in the case are first- and 
second-degree murder, voluntary and involuntary manslaughter and not guilty on 
any charges. 
</P>
<P>
First-degree murder means the murder was premeditated -- or considered 
beforehand -- while second-degree lacks that deliberation. Voluntary 
manslaughter means a killing was considered after a sudden provocation. 
Involuntary manslaughter describes a killing that occurs while doing something 
else without due caution. 
</P>
<P>
Through her choice of clothes, Betty Broderick contended Thursday that the jury 
wasn't being given all the facts it needed to make a fair decision, Earley 
said. She had the choice of wearing dress clothes, as she had for each prior 
day in the trial, but opted for the sweats, both shirt and pants stenciled with 
"SD JAIL" in big letters. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm upset that the diaries didn't come in," she whispered, pointing to a stack 
of notebooks, "and the divorce verdict not being put into evidence," an 
apparent reference to the divorce file -- not the verdict -- because the 
divorce judgment itself is part of the evidence in the murder case. 
</P>
<P>
The diaries corroborated her testimony in the case about her motives and 
emotions, defense lawyer Jack Earley said. 
</P>
<P>
Whelan, however, ruled that the notebooks -- in all, about 10 volumes, which 
Betty Broderick kept from 1985, when she and Daniel Broderick separated, until 
1988 -- were too cumbersome for the jury to pore through. 
</P>
<P>
One excerpt from the diaries did go to the jury, introduced by prosecutor 
Wells. In that excerpt, Betty Broderick wrote that "there is no better reason 
to kill" than to protect home and family, and said her ex-husband had "attacked 
and destroyed" her and the couple's four children. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick feels it is unfair for the jury to see that excerpt out of 
context, Earley said. 
</P>
<P>
She believes the divorce file is also crucial to an understanding of the 
context of the murder case because it documents the history of her battles with 
her ex-husband, Earley said. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick, he said, believes the file would help explain her allegations 
that her ex-husband manipulated the legal system against her, and why she did 
certain things she did during the divorce -- like drive her car into his front 
door after he engineered the court-ordered sale of her house. 
</P>
<P>
The divorce file is sealed to the public and press. 
</P>
<P>
Earley said he did not believe Betty Broderick's clothes were a sign that she 
was upset with the way he handled the case. Instead, she simply felt she no 
longer had "any reason to go ahead with the trial process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Earley and Wells declined to speculate how long the jury might be out. 
</P>
<P>
"You hope the jury is out long enough to address the issues," Earley said. 
</P>
<P>
Both attorneys also said they did not want to predict the verdict.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY AT LARGE: DUFFY UNWITTINGLY HELPS PAY FOR PARTY CELEBRATING

It just keeps happening. 
</P>
<P>
* Dear John. 
</P>
<P>
Everett and Maudie Bobbitt will host a party at Tom Ham's Lighthouse to 
celebrate the departure/removal/exile of Sheriff John Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
Everett is the attorney who battled Duffy on behalf of deputies. Maudie, his 
wife, is a sheriff's captain who was suspended by Duffy for a month in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy has not been invited to the bash. But his presence will be felt anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The Bobbitts are paying for the party with the back pay that Maudie got after 
the Civil Service Commission revoked her suspension as unjustified. 
</P>
<P>
* The hounds of the press may have missed the real scandal in Duffy's secret 
bank account with money seized in drug raids. 
</P>
<P>
According to documents released by Duffy, he wrote two dozen checks or so on an 
account topping $1 million at Security Pacific Bank. He was assessed $11.36 in 
check charges. 
</P>
<P>
You plunk down $1 million and don't get free checking? Call the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
* Political whirl. 
</P>
<P>
Two members of the Public Utilities Commission, thought to favor the 
SDG&amp;E-Southern California Edison merger, are seeking reappointment. 
Otherwise, they will be gone by the time of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
The decision will be up to San Diego's Pete Wilson, who has stayed mum on the 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
* Classified ad in San Diego State's Daily Aztec: 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know anywhere to find a cheap truck? Preferably a way rad, surf rig 
with (Grateful) Dead stickers &amp; smelling of Humboldt County." 
</P>
<P>
What color would you prefer? 
</P>
<P>
* How hot was the anti-incumbent fever? 
</P>
<P>
Three incumbents on the Grossmont-Cuyamaca Community College District board 
were on the ballot last week. Two of the three lost. 
</P>
<P>
The one who survived was the only one not to list "incumbent" after her name. 
</P>
<P>
* David Spisak was reelected to a third term on the Lemon Grove school board. 
By 15 votes. 
</P>
<P>
He's being called "Landslide Dave."

UC PANEL OKS UCLA EXPANSION; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: REGENTS ARE EXPECTED TO APPROVE SCALED-DOWN PLAN DESPITE WESTWOOD 
RESIDENTS' FEARS OF TRAFFIC GRIDLOCK AND POLLUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite protests from Westwood residents about potential traffic gridlock and 
pollution, a UC Board of Regents panel Thursday approved plans by UCLA to boost 
office, classroom, housing and medical space by as much as 27% while slightly 
decreasing student enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, covering development through the year 2005, could add 3.71 million 
square feet of campus facilities -- about one-fifth smaller than the original 
proposal. Among previous changes, a controversial proposal for a UCLA 
conference center in Westwood with room for 300 overnight guests was dropped as 
a result of neighborhood concerns, and an agreement with the city of Los 
Angeles to limit traffic was added. The plan is expected to be approved by the 
full board today. 
</P>
<P>
In his presentation to the regents, UCLA Chancellor Charles E. Young said the 
development plan was needed "to relieve crowded conditions in teaching and 
research, to replace technologically obsolete facilities and to improve the 
quality of campus life." 
</P>
<P>
The regents committee unanimously agreed without discussion. 
</P>
<P>
The action, however, does not guarantee that all, or any, of UCLA's wishes will 
become brick and mortar. Each new building will require separate approval, an 
uncertainty given voters' rejection last week of a bond issue for university 
construction. Officials gave no estimate of the total potential cost, but it 
clearly could be more than several hundred million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Scaling back the plan has not eliminated the anger against it. In a letter to 
the regents, Alvin Milder, chairman of a Westwood group called UCLA Watch, 
urged that the vote be postponed for further study of the five-volume plan and 
the environmental impact statement. Resulting development and traffic would 
have "a devastating effect" on the already-crowded neighborhood, he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Milder and other community activists did not attend the meeting in San 
Francisco partly because, they said, they each were given only five minutes to 
speak, as is usual for public presentations to the regents, and they considered 
approval a certainty. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Milder said the vote "shows that they really have 
very little concern about the citizens in the area." 
</P>
<P>
Laura Lake, president of Friends of Westwood, also wrote to the regents, asking 
for a sharp reduction in the plan she described as "Godzilla goes to Westwood." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Lake denounced the action and UC's exemption, as a 
state entity, from local zoning and growth rules. 
</P>
<P>
"The regents themselves have tunnel vision. They are untouchable and 
unaccountable to the public," Lake said. "I think this flags the need for the 
Legislature to make them accountable because we are not the only community 
getting crushed by the University of California." 
</P>
<P>
However, Young told the regents that UCLA has made "substantial compromises to 
accommodate community concerns" by scaling down the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA plan includes an agreement with the city to limit campus-related 
"vehicle trips" to 139,500 daily, an increase of 10,500, and to make more 
extensive use of ride-sharing and van pools. That agreement was criticized by 
Lake and others because it can be revised if UCLA's educational plans change 
significantly. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, UCLA wanted an increase of 526 students from the 34,674 who 
attended two years ago. Then, that was cut to an increase of 105. However, 
enrollment this year is projected to be 35,100. So the student body would have 
to drop by 320 to meet the plan's revised goal of 34,779 over 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
However, the number of faculty and staff would rise by 3,128 to 21,945. 
</P>
<P>
Other highlights of the plan include a residential village for 2,300 graduate 
students and 400 faculty on what is now a parking lot between Veteran and 
Gayley avenues, land that reaches into Westwood Village; a new hospital 
building; a child care center; library expansions and new laboratories. The 
main campus boundaries would not expand, leading critics to ask how the 
university could build so much and still maintain what Young contends is "a 
campus in a garden" atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference during a break in the meeting, officials of the U.S. 
Department of Education announced that centers for research in education will 
be established at three UC campuses with federal grants totaling $25.6 million 
over the next five years. A related $6-million grant for a center at USC is to 
be formally announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The center at UCLA would concentrate on student evaluation and testing, one at 
UC Santa Cruz on cultural diversity and second language learning, and the one 
at UC Berkeley on writing and literacy. USC researchers will look at links 
between finance and quality in education. They will be part of a national 
network of what is to be 17 such research headquarters.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN CHARGED IN FORGERY OF TAX REFUND CHECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Culver City man accused of trying to steal more than $644,000 from the state 
by adding a few extra digits to his tax refund check was charged Thursday with 
forgery and attempted grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
State officials, who said the case is one of the largest of its kind in state 
history, say Mathison B. Coleman, 56, allegedly increased the amount of his 
$33.62 state refund check to $644,933.62 before submitting it to his bank in 
Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Now wasn't that chutzpah? Can you believe it? This is classic. I've never seen 
a case like this," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Gilbert Garcetti, who heads the 
district attorney's Torrance branch. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman, who was scheduled to turn himself in to Manhattan Beach police this 
morning, faces up to three years in state prison if convicted. His attorney, 
Robert Corbin, declined to comment.

S.D. TRAILS HOUSTON AS GOP CONVENTION SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the field of contenders has been narrowed to San Diego and Houston, 
the Texas city is now the odds-on favorite to host the 1992 GOP Convention, a 
ranking member of the Republican National Committee said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Ernest Angelo, head of the RNC in Texas, said Houston "has been the favorite 
from the start," because of President Bush's ties to the city and because a 
political convention has never been held in what is now the nation's 
fourth-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
Although still in the running, San Diego is handicapped, Angelo and other GOP 
officials said Thursday, because of technical problems presented in the 
"two-site concept," meaning the San Diego Convention Center and San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Jeanie Austin, co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, said from 
Washington that no GOP convention has ever been staged by shuttling between two 
sites, which creates "a doubling-up of phone lines, lighting and security. 
</P>
<P>
"This doesn't mean San Diego is ruled out," she said. "It just means we've 
never done such a thing before." 
</P>
<P>
Austin said "no city is out of the running," meaning the field still includes 
Cleveland, St. Petersburg, Fla., and New Orleans, as well as Houston and San 
Diego. But Angelo said he had heard from "good sources" that, indeed, the 
choice has been narrowed to Houston and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Austin said the eight-member Site Selection Committee will meet Nov. 30 in 
Washington to narrow the field to two, with the 166-member bloc of the RNC 
voting in the winner Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Austin said the people of San Diego "have been wonderful -- they expressed a 
real 'we want you' attitude and made us feel really welcome -- but there are 
concerns about the big columns in the Convention Center that block television 
and spectator views. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people also expressed concern that the President might be making his 
acceptance speech while squinting into the sun at the stadium. It's not that we 
couldn't overcome these things. . . . It's just that we'd have to think about 
them, and we've never had to think about such things before." 
</P>
<P>
Austin said the Site Selection Committee is composed of two people from each of 
four regions of the country. Tom Wiesner, a national committeeman from Nevada, 
and Barbara Campbell, the Republican committee's state chairwoman in Montana, 
are lobbying aggressively for San Diego, Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
Angelo said California is "a critical state," and Sen. Pete Wilson's 
gubernatorial victory improved San Diego's chances.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DISCOVERERS OF AIDS VIRUS HONORED FOR WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The discoverers of the AIDS virus, Dr. Robert C. Gallo of the National Cancer 
Institute and Dr. Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, were in Los 
Angeles Thursday to receive an award at the annual meeting of the American 
Assn. of Blood Banks. 
</P>
<P>
Gallo said he was "optimistic" that improvement therapies against the AIDS 
virus will be developed within the next five years, but added that he "will 
never predict one way or the other when we will have a vaccine." 
</P>
<P>
Montagnier elaborated on his controversial theory that a small microbe known as 
a mycoplasma has a role along with the AIDS virus in causing the deadly 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
Gallo declined to comment on an ongoing National Institutes of Health probe of 
possible scientific misconduct in some of the AIDS research in his laboratory 
in the mid-1980s. "Wait a few months and I will have a lot to comment on and a 
lot of things to release," he said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COLLEGE STUDENTS PROTEST CANCELLATION OF 
CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 150 Occidental College students staged a daylong sit-in Thursday at 
the Eagle Rock campus after administrators canceled a free rap concert and 
graffiti art show organized by student minority groups and fraternities. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven student groups and several community activists had invited high school 
students throughout Los Angeles to the college's outdoor amphitheater Friday 
night to hear four rap groups, watch graffiti artists doing demonstrations and 
visit information tables set up by ethnic organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Dean of Students Brigida Knauer on Tuesday canceled the concert, saying she was 
concerned about potential gang fights and lack of security. Knauer said she 
initially approved the event, but changed her mind after learning that many 
more high school students had been invited than was expected.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HALF-CENT SALES TAX HIKE WINS NARROW 
APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County voters narrowly approved Proposition C, a measure hiking 
sales taxes by a half-cent to develop a five-county rail transit system, build 
exclusive bus ways and widen freeways, nearly final election returns disclosed 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The county registrar-recorder's office said that with only about 1,000 to 2,000 
absentee ballots still to be counted, Proposition C had received 847,838 yes 
votes to 833,336 no votes, a 14,502-vote margin. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, along with a similar sales-tax proposition approved in Orange 
County, is expected to raise $550 million a year to fight traffic congestion 
with improved transit systems. 
</P>
<P>
In other election results, a tally of the last 1,000 absentee ballots in Santa 
Monica confirmed that tenant rights candidate Kelly Olsen narrowly beat out 
incumbent Councilwoman Christine Reed for the third contested seat on the Santa 
Monica City Council. 
</P>
<P>
And Proposition W, a tenant-backed measure that would have allowed modest rent 
increases on voluntarily vacated apartments, was defeated. The final unofficial 
numbers showed that the measure lost by 266 votes. 
</P>
<P>
On the morning after the election, before the absentee votes were counted, 
Olsen led Reed by 827 votes. On Wednesday, about 1,500 absentee ballots were 
counted, narrowing the gap to 519. The final tally showed Olsen edging out Reed 
by 374 votes. 
</P>
<P>
In the Santa Monica-Malibu school board race, nearly final returns reported by 
the county showed Brenda Gottfried the winner of the last open seat. Gottfried 
and Joanne Leavitt had been locked in a close race for fourth place in the 
race, but Gottfried was ahead by 300 votes. Officials estimated that fewer than 
100 absentee ballots remained to be counted.

JURISTS ADOPT PLAN MATCHING SINGLE JUDGE TO EACH CASE; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: NEW APPROACH SPEEDS CIVIL TRIALS TOWARD RESOLUTION FASTER THAN THE 
TRADITIONAL SYSTEM, JUDGE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Expanding a pilot project and a reputation for innovation, San Diego Superior 
Court judges have voted to adopt a system that assigns a civil case to one 
judge for the duration of the case, the court's presiding judge said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The system, which the court's 70 judges approved Wednesday, will replace the 
traditional system of rotating a case around various courtrooms until trial, 
said Judge Judith McConnell, the presiding judge. All civil cases filed after 
July 1, 1991, will become part of the plan, she said. 
</P>
<P>
An eight-judge experiment, in place since January, showed that assigning the 
case to a sole judge who becomes intimately familiar with it sweeps the case 
toward resolution much faster than the traditional system, McConnell said. 
</P>
<P>
From that pilot project, "we know that, with one judge, there's going to be a 
better quality of justice because the judge becomes familiar with the case, 
there's less game-playing and much more consistency," McConnell said. 
</P>
<P>
The judges' action means the San Diego court will become the first superior 
court in the state to use only the one-judge plan -- formally called 
"independent calendaring" -- for all civil cases, McConnell said. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Superior Court was also the first in California to institute the 
so-called "fast-track" program, a controversial case management plan that since 
has been adopted around the state. 
</P>
<P>
Adopted in San Diego in 1987, the fast-track plan speedily pushes civil cases 
toward trial by programming fixed dates that lawyers must meet, instead of 
agreeing among themselves to delay after delay, as cases proceed toward trial. 
</P>
<P>
After three years of fast-track, the San Diego bench disposes of 63% of civil 
cases within one year and 95% within two years, most of them by settlement, 
McConnell said. The goal for implementing the one-judge plan is to boost the 
one-year rate to 90%, she said. 
</P>
<P>
That's not unreachable, she said, because the experiment with the one-judge 
plan shows that independent calendaring also moves cases through the court 
system faster. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, among cases filed last April, about 23% of the cases in the 
one-judge plan had been set for trial by October, contrasted with 2% in the 
rotation system, which is known at the courthouse as master calendaring. 
</P>
<P>
About 35% of those one-judge cases filed in April had been disposed of by 
October, she said. In the traditional rotation system, only 7% had been 
resolved, McConnell said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the biggest complaints citizens -- and attorneys -- have had about the 
way we handle our civil cases is that, every time they come to court, they get 
a different judge, and that there are endless delays," McConnell said. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Michael I. Greer, one of the eight judges in the experiment, said 
independent calendar judges have to "know the files from beginning to end 
because we're responsible for the file. You don't spend as much time playing 
games. You rule on (an issue) once, and it's over with." 
</P>
<P>
Even the lawyers like the one-judge system because it promotes consistency, 
Greer said. "They love it because they know who the judge is," he said. "They 
can count on it." 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Nelson, the current president of the San Diego County Bar Assn., said 
Thursday that the local bar has embraced the one-judge plan wholeheartedly and 
supports its extension to all civil cases. 
</P>
<P>
McConnell said she would assign 18 of the court's 70 judges to full-time civil 
work beginning July 1. Each judge can be expected to have 500 to 600 cases on 
the docket at any given time, she said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEA SCANDAL BEGAN WITH $16,000 THEFT, JURY 
TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal prosecutor said in a Los Angeles courtroom Thursday that a Drug 
Enforcement Administration corruption scandal began with the theft of $16,000 
in drug cash in October, 1982, leading to narcotics trafficking charges being 
filed against three agents. 
</P>
<P>
From that point, Asst. U.S. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Stefan D. Stein said, the agents engaged "in a spree of corruption" that led to 
a federal grand jury indictment two years ago charging them, among other 
things, with stealing drugs from the DEA's evidence vault in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the agents have pleaded guilty. The trial of the third agent, Darnell 
Garcia, 43, of Rancho Palos Verdes, is set to begin Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Jury selection was completed Thursday and Stein's co-prosecutor, Asst. U.S. 
Atty. Joyce Karlin, said she expects the trial to last about two months. As he 
was leaving the courtroom of U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr., Garcia 
was asked by a reporter if he was confident of acquittal. "Yeah, a lot," he 
said.

FIRMS 'STAMPEDE'AFTER TOHSHIN SCRAPS PROJECT; 
</P>
<P>
TOPANGA CANYON: A BANKRUPT DEVELOPER HAS OFFERS TO REPLACE THE JAPANESE FIRM 
THAT BACKED OUT, HIS ATTORNEY SAYS.

Controversial plans to build a golf course and housing in Topanga Canyon are 
still alive, with "a virtual stampede" of other companies lining up to replace 
Japanese financial interests that withdrew, an attorney for the would-be 
developer said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
John T. Janosik, representing developer Christopher Wojciechowski, said in a 
federal bankruptcy proceeding that Wojciechowski has made "clear, substantive 
progress" in the last several weeks toward obtaining the five county permits 
still required before construction can begin on the site of the proposed 
Montevideo Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
And he promised U.S. District Judge William Lasarow that once the county issues 
the permits, "we will not have any difficulty in getting a signed agreement" 
from a company that wants to buy the 257-acre site, located in the northern 
part of the canyon about three miles from the Woodland Hills border. 
</P>
<P>
Wojciechowski, who filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection about a year ago, 
planned to sell the Montevideo Country Club site and the plans for the 
development to the Japan-based Tohshin Co., for $22 million, plus an additional 
$14 million when construction began. 
</P>
<P>
But Japanese banks were reluctant to finance the purchase and Tohshin decided 
not to proceed on the night before the agreement was scheduled to be ratified 
by the federal bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
Company representatives said the project seemed too risky an investment because 
of the obstacles still standing in the way of construction. 
</P>
<P>
Before construction can begin, the project needs final approval from the 
county's Subdivision Committee, and the Board of Supervisors would have to 
grant a zoning change, an oak tree removal permit and a general plan amendment, 
county Planner Don Culbertson said. 
</P>
<P>
Now another potential buyer is negotiating with Wojciechowski to acquire the 
land for the project, Janosik said Thursday, although Janosik admitted that the 
company -- which he would not identify -- is reluctant to commit itself to the 
purchase until the Board of Supervisors clears the way for construction. 
</P>
<P>
Many Topanga residents vehemently oppose the plan to turn the rolling, 
oak-dotted meadow into an artificially landscaped golf course, and members of 
the Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community have launched a letter writing 
campaign to persuade Supervisor Mike Antonovich to oppose the project's current 
design. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to get the word out that we are not going to accept this thing," said 
Bob Bates, president of the association. "We also want to get the word out to 
potential buyers." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after the court hearing Thursday, Janosik refused to reveal the 
company that is considering the purchase. But he said in court that even if 
that firm backs out, others have expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a virtual stampede of new interest," Janosik said. But, he said, 
"buyers want to wait for county approval."

FOUR CONTRACTORS CHARGED WITH MISHANDLING ASBESTOS 
</P>

Criminal charges were filed Thursday against four San Fernando Valley 
contractors alleging that they unsafely handled asbestos, including using a 
jackhammer to rip out floor tiles in a bank lobby that was used by hundreds of 
patrons shortly afterward. 
</P>
<P>
A state air quality investigator said a witness saw "dust accumulating 
throughout the . . . lobby" at a First Interstate Bank branch at 8495 W. 3rd 
St. in the Fairfax district on Dec. 8. 
</P>
<P>
"Several hundred customers" came to the bank before it closed at 1 p.m., by 
which time the investigator was wearing a protective face mask and rubber 
gloves to remain in the area, he wrote in his report. 
</P>
<P>
John Glover, a First Interstate official, declined to comment. He was quoted in 
the report as saying that the contractor had been warned not to remove the 
tiles and that the bank management was surprised to learn he was doing so. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District monitors construction work that 
may release asbestos into the atmosphere because inhaling the substance has 
been linked to cancer and other lung diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Charged with five counts of violating AQMD asbestos rules was Financial 
Construction Co., an Encino-based firm hired by First Interstate. The 
construction firm's president, Wayne Christensen, could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
In all four cases, the misdemeanor criminal charges were filed by City Atty. 
James K. Hahn's office. 
</P>
<P>
One of the other cases involved the demolition in February of Biffs Restaurant 
at Van Nuys Boulevard and Vanowen Street in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD investigators halted the Biffs demolition job after learning that asbestos 
was on the site and after two-thirds of the rubble had been disposed of at a 
landfill. Nine counts of improper handling of asbestos were filed against All 
Contractors Inc. of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
No criminal charges were filed by Hahn against First Interstate, although an 
AQMD investigator issued a notice of violation against the bank. "They may have 
had some responsibility, but it wasn't enough to file a criminal complaint," 
Deputy City Atty. Teresa Lujan said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Donald Kass said the AQMD did not test for asbestos in the 
dust that was spread through the bank lobby by removal of the floor tiles. The 
tiles, however, were tested and found to contain asbestos, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We can only hope that what was in the air was just dust, not asbestos fibers," 
Kass said. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD investigators were warned by another contractor that Financial 
Construction might be mishandling material containing asbestos. The other firm, 
P.W. Stephens Contractors, was hired to remove floor tiles containing asbestos 
from an adjacent office, separated by a partition from the bank lobby. 
</P>
<P>
A construction supervisor for the Stephens firm told AQMD investigator Laurance 
Israel that he had "observed dust accumulating throughout the bank lobby 
resulting from the Financial Construction Co. work crew using jackhammer 
equipment, scrapers and chipping bars to remove floor tiles." 
</P>
<P>
Glover of First Interstate was quoted in Israel's report as saying that he had 
warned the Financial Construction Co. crew not to remove the tiles until they 
were tested for asbestos. Glover said he was "surprised" to learn later that 
the contractor had proceeded with the work. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD report quotes the Financial Construction foreman as saying that he was 
unaware of the presence of asbestos. He was quoted as saying that his crews 
wore no protective clothing and did not wet the tiles to prevent asbestos 
particles from becoming airborne -- both violations of AQMD rules. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn's office also filed charges against Adi and Zohar Egar, who do business as 
A to Z Construction Co. in West Hills, for work they did April 6 at an Encino 
house; and against Sancho Morada, who heads Morada Builders Co. of Panorama 
City, for renovation work done April 13 at a Hollywood residence.

HIDDEN HILLS WILL PAY $1 MILLION TO DEVELOPER; 
</P>
<P>
LAWSUITS: THE AFFLUENT COMMUNITY'S BUDGET WILL BE STRAINED BY PAYING DAMAGES 
OVER AN AGREEMENT THAT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED LOW-COST HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY. 
</P>

<P>
The exclusive, gated community of Hidden Hills agreed Thursday to pay $1 
million to settle a lawsuit charging that it reneged on an agreement to let a 
developer build low-cost housing for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Danny Howard -- whose plan was fatally delayed by opposition from 
residents -- will receive the payments over a five-year period, city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the settlement will strain the resources of the town, which has a 
population of 2,000 and an annual budget of only $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor H. Brian Herdeg said the first annual payment of $350,000 will come from 
the city's reserve fund of $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
The city may have to sell some of its properties to replenish that account, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Howard's plan for 46 units of housing on four acres -- outside the city gates 
but within the city limits -- stirred the passions of Hidden Hills residents 
who said they wanted to keep their community of million-dollar homes an "island 
in a sea of urban growth." 
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1989, shortly after the project was proposed, an anonymous 
letter circulated to residents warned that tenants of the new project could 
vote in city elections, serve on city commissions, and use all city-owned 
facilities, including the swimming pool and tennis courts. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this really what we want for our community?" the note asked. 
</P>
<P>
Taken aback by vehement public opposition, council members refused to approve 
the project, saying that they needed more time to consider outstanding 
environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
The project became the key issue in municipal elections in April in which three 
council members who defended the project were voted out. 
</P>
<P>
In May, still without the city approval to go forward, Howard lost his option 
to buy the property. 
</P>
<P>
Howard's attorney, Benjamin M. Reznik, called the settlement a major victory 
for his client. 
</P>
<P>
"They delayed the process for so long that our client lost his right to buy the 
land," Reznik said. "They thought they could get away with stalling this 
process as long as they wanted to."

REDONDO BEACH TELLS LIVE-ABOARD BOATERS TO MOVE ALONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 15 years, Bob DeLoyd has lived aboard his boat, a breakwater away from the 
open sea but so close to nature that he knows the gulls by name. 
</P>
<P>
People said his lifestyle was too good to be true. This week they were proven 
right. On Tuesday, DeLoyd and six other live-aboard boaters who moor at the far 
edge of Redondo Beach's King Harbor were told they will have to move. 
</P>
<P>
The eviction notice, served by the City Council, was part of the fallout from 
the violent storms of 1988. In just four months that year, towering waves and 
gale-force winds devastated the harbor area and nearly destroyed the Redondo 
Beach Pier. The storm also spawned several multimillion-dollar lawsuits against 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
When the first of those lawsuits -- a claim by the Redondo Beach Marina that 
the city had not adequately protected the harbor -- was settled earlier this 
year, the city agreed, among other things, to buy the mooring area for $1.5 
million and evict its tenants. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the marina had allowed boats to anchor far from the docks and just 
inside the harbor passage to Santa Monica Bay. The area is far from 
comfortable: Phone service is limited, groceries and water have to be hauled in 
by dinghy and there is the annual threat of winter storms. Still, scores of 
boaters accepted the risks and inconvenience as the price of a home that was 
private, tranquil and cheap. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to explain," said Bill Humphreys, 41, who has lived in the outer 
harbor for 11 years. "What other people feel when they go backpacking, I feel 
on a daily basis when I go home." 
</P>
<P>
DeLoyd agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"So many people live humdrum lives, with their cars and their electric 
garages," the 39-year-old student said. "I row out to my home. I enjoy the wind 
and the waves and camaraderie that you just don't get in a neighborhood where 
people drive home and watch TV." 
</P>
<P>
Each day, he said, he is awakened by his dog, which he would have to give up if 
he kept his boat in a slip, where pets generally are not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
When he leans over the deck of his 26-foot sailboat, Fancy Free, curious seals 
pop up from the water. Sea gulls swoop down to eat from his hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I've even named some," DeLoyd said, smiling. "One old bird I've named Horus, 
for the Egyptian god with the wings." 
</P>
<P>
When the first massive storm hit in January, 1988, DeLoyd and Humphreys said, 
they felt excitement rather than fear. Familiar with the elements, they could 
sense what was coming from the rising force of the winter wind and the crash of 
the waves against the breakwater. When the skies cleared, buildings had been 
wrecked, the landmark pier had been battered and millions of dollars' worth of 
damage had been done. But there were no injuries among the resilient 
live-aboards of the outer harbor, and no lawsuits filed by them against the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
There was, however, a suit filed that year by their landlord, the Redondo Beach 
Marina, and when it was settled in April and the city got the moorings, the 
question of municipal liability arose. 
</P>
<P>
Mooring tenants in the outer harbor who had removed their boats during the 1988 
storms were not allowed to return, but a handful, including DeLoyd and 
Humphreys, had managed to ride out the storms. 
</P>
<P>
The live-aboards urged the city to let them stay, and a six-month study ensued. 
But in the end, a city consultant concluded that the safety of live-aboards in 
the outer harbor could not be guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear what the deadline will be for the people of the outer harbor. 
When the lawsuit was settled, the tenants were given 30 days to move. 
</P>
<P>
DeLoyd and his neighbors, caught in the middle of the legal wrangling, contend 
that the city has ousted them not because of the safety risks but because the 
council is unreasonably fearful of more litigation. 
</P>
<P>
But the council is adamant. 
</P>
<P>
"Living aboard a boat is wonderful and romantic, and I can understand that 
you've done it for a long time," Councilwoman Kay Horrell told the stunned 
live-aboards. 
</P>
<P>
"But when you sit up here and picture things as we do, it's scary. This city 
has lawsuits lined up at the harbor gate and waiting to come in on the tide. . 
. . It would only take one lost life and this city is in deep, deep trouble."

U.S. SENATE VACANCIES COULD CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOCAL POLITICIANS; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTIONS: NEW CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS, TERM LIMITS AND REDISTRICTING MAY 
PRODUCE LIVELY RACES IN 1992.

<P>
The logjam that has blocked the upward mobility of local politicians for years 
could be breaking up. 
</P>
<P>
The election of Sen. Pete Wilson as governor and Sen. Alan Cranston's 
announcement late last week that he has prostate cancer and will not seek 
reelection in 1992 probably will open some doors of opportunity. Wilson will 
resign from the Senate and appoint his own successor when he takes office in 
Sacramento early next year, but that successor would have to run for election 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
With both of California's U.S. Senate seats on the line in 1992, political 
figures from both parties have been sizing up their prospects of moving up to a 
more prestigious office. One such politician is Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa 
Monica), who, even before Cranston's announcement last week, was widely 
expected to make a run for the Senate in 1992. Levine, easily elected to his 
fifth House term Nov. 6, has made no secret of his desire to run for the Senate 
and has built a $1.7-million campaign treasury in anticipation of doing so. 
</P>
<P>
Levine's district stretches along the coast from the South Bay to Santa Monica. 
It includes Redondo Beach, Manhattan Beach, El Segundo, Hermosa Beach and parts 
of Torrance and Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
After Cranston's announcement, Levine said he would consult with family and 
friends before making a decision on the Senate race. Levine said in an 
interview that the need to raise massive sums of money for a Senate race will 
prompt him to decide by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
If he decides to enter the contest, Levine said he will "spend 1991 raising the 
war chest to run this race." 
</P>
<P>
If Levine runs, the prospect of an open seat in the House could set in motion a 
political chain reaction that involves state legislators in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is an open seat, there will be a scramble," said Robert Stern, 
co-director of the California Commission on Campaign Financing, a private group 
of business, labor and academic leaders interested in political reform. 
</P>
<P>
State lawmakers, faced with newly enacted term limits, may be particularly 
interested in running for other political posts, Stern said. But because of 
reapportionment, Stern noted that there is no guarantee that Levine's district 
will continue to exist in its current shape. 
</P>
<P>
The boundaries of all legislative and congressional districts must be redrawn 
based on new census figures. California's rapid population growth during the 
1980s will mean as many as seven new congressional districts. But most of that 
growth has occurred elsewhere, and it may be difficult for all current 
lawmakers representing the South Bay and Westside in Congress to maintain 
secure seats. 
</P>
<P>
And the reapportionment process that will get under way next year will be far 
different from what occurred after the 1980 census. Then, a Legislature 
dominated by Democrats joined a Democratic governor, Edmund G. Brown Jr., to 
adopt a plan highly favorable to their party. Wilson's election on Tuesday 
gives the Republicans a veto this time around, which probably will assure that 
the 1990s reapportionment will be bipartisan. 
</P>
<P>
Levine said it is "impossible to make an intelligent prediction" about what the 
boundaries of California's congressional districts will be. If Wilson and the 
Democratic legislative leaders cannot reach a compromise, the new district 
lines will probably be determined in court, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Whether a Senate bid by Levine would prompt political maneuvering in the South 
Bay will depend on the outcome of redistricting, political experts say. 
</P>
<P>
If Levine's district remains the same, they said, the odds would favor a 
Westside Democrat -- and few South Bay politicians would be interested in 
running. That is because most of the South Bay portion of Levine's turf is 
Republican and dominated by GOP politicians who would stand little chance of 
winning districtwide. 
</P>
<P>
But one South Bay Democrat with a political base in Levine's district, 
Assemblyman Curtis Tucker Jr. of Inglewood, says he might consider competing 
for Levine's seat if it becomes vacant and its lines are altered. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always interested in different options, especially because of the term 
limits," Tucker said this week. "If I were to put together a wish list, moving 
up the ladder (to Congress) would be on it." 
</P>
<P>
But Tucker added that the congressional district would have to be redrawn to 
include more of his South Bay Democratic turf and less of the Westside for him 
to win. 
</P>
<P>
A second scenario spurring local congressional competition would be if Levine's 
district were reshaped to include more South Bay Republicans. That would create 
an opening for a South Bay GOP officeholder with a power base in the district. 
</P>
<P>
Just who, however, is unclear. State Assemblyman Gerald Felando (R-San Pedro), 
after stating in August that he might not seek an eighth term, now insists he 
will run for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
And state Sen. Bob Beverly (R-Manhattan Beach) has not expressed interest in 
running for Congress. An aide says the senator has little desire to be a 
backbencher in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"His comment has been that it takes you 10 years to get a parking place back 
there," said Tom Martin, who heads Beverly's district office. 
</P>
<P>
A third possibility is that Levine's district -- with no incumbent to claim it 
-- will be scrapped altogether and a self-contained South Bay district will 
emerge, a move that would spark interest among South Bay Republicans and 
Democrats alike. 
</P>
<P>
GOP political consultant Allan Hoffenblum said there is a good chance that 
reapportionment would leave the South Bay with its own congressional district. 
The result, he predicted, would be intense political jockeying. 
</P>
<P>
There also is a measure of uncertainty concerning the future plans of one of 
the state's highest-profile politicians: Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa 
Monica). 
</P>
<P>
In an interview before last week's election, Hayden said that after the vote he 
planned to "make a personal assessment of what I want to do with the rest of my 
life. I'm 50 years old. To continue a political career is an option. Not the 
only one. I resist efforts to try to draw a conclusion now." 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Hayden admitted: "My enthusiasm about giving the next several 
years of my life to electoral office is dim." 
</P>
<P>
Might Hayden run for Congress in 1992? Will he run for the U.S. Senate as he 
did in 1976? Will he seek reelection to the Legislature? Or will he get out of 
politics entirely? 
</P>
<P>
For now, Hayden is noncommittal. After Cranston's announcement, he refused to 
discuss whether he would seek one of the two U.S. Senate seats. "To immediately 
jump into political speculation would be inappropriate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
POSSIBLE CANDIDATES FOR HIGHER OFFICE 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Rep. Mel Levine 
</P>
<P>
Has made no secret of his desire to run for the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Curtis Tucker Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Might consider competing for Levine's seat if it becomes vacant and boundaries 
are altered. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Gerald N. Felando 
</P>
<P>
Stated in August he might not seek an eighth term, but now insists he will run 
for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Robert G. Beverly 
</P>
<P>
Has little desire to be a backbencher in Washington, an aide says.

Four years after they met at a peace march in Barstow, Wallace Perry finally 
found Marylyn Scott on Thursday to tell her he had kept a promise. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone call that ended a lengthy quest, Perry, 67, of Torrance, told 
Scott that he had found her father's grave in Belgium, just as she had asked in 
March, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so touched," Marylyn Scott, 53, said by phone from Ukiah, in Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Said Perry: "I feel like I'm floating." 
</P>
<P>
Perry met Scott as the Great Peace March passed through Barstow. The Army Air 
Corps veteran of World War II told Scott that he often traveled to Belgium, 
where he is organizing support for a peace memorial. 
</P>
<P>
Scott asked Perry if he could find the grave site of her father, Pvt. George 
Scott, killed Sept. 4, 1944, in a tank battle in Belgium. And if Perry did find 
it, she asked, would he place a medal inscribed "Peace on Earth" on the grave? 
</P>
<P>
During a 1988 trip to Belgium, Perry made a Memorial Day visit to the American 
Cemetery in Henri-Chapelle and found Scott's grave. 
</P>
<P>
After returning to the United States, he tried unsuccessfully by phone and mail 
to contact Marylyn Scott at her home outside Calpella, in Mendocino County. 
</P>
<P>
A Veterans Day story of Perry's quest led to phone calls from Scott's friends 
in Los Angeles. They told Perry that she could be reached either at the private 
grade school where she teaches or at the Mendocino Environmental Center, where 
she volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday afternoon, Perry finally reached Scott at the school. 
</P>
<P>
"She said she felt honored by what I had done," said Perry, who is making plans 
to meet with Scott again. "I told her, 'What the heck. A promise made is a 
promise kept.' " 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Scott said she remembered Perry's promise but never 
received his letters. The mother of six said she never tried to contact Perry 
because "I felt that he was probably too busy with his life, and I was busy 
with mine." 
</P>
<P>
Perry's odyssey, Scott said, was a poignant tribute to a father she remembers 
as a good man. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember my father very well," said Scott, who was 7 years old when Pvt. 
Scott died. "He didn't have to go to war at his age and with a family. But he 
felt he had to fight for peace." 
</P>
<P>
Her memories, she said, have been strengthened by Perry. 
</P>
<P>
"It is as though Wallace brought my father's spirit alive for me," Scott said. 
"And that is wonderful."

NO SOUTH BAY ALERTS CALLED IN BEST SMOG SEASON EVER; 
</P>
<P>
POLLUTION: IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS, THE LOS ANGELES BASIN HAD THE FEWEST SMOG 
ALERTS SINCE RECORD-KEEPING BEGAN IN 1955, AIR QUALITY OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Clean air is in the eyes -- or is it the lungs? -- of the beholder. 
</P>
<P>
Air quality officials announced this month that during the six-month smog 
season that ended Nov. 1, the Los Angeles Basin had the cleanest air they have 
ever recorded. There were fewer smog alerts in 1990 than in any year since 
records for Southern California were first kept in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
That trend held true at the South Bay's lone smog monitoring station in 
Hawthorne, where there was not a single smog alert in 1990. In fact, the 
Hawthorne station has reported just six smog alerts in the past 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the South Coast Air Quality Management District called the 
improvements for their jurisdiction -- Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties -- "mind-boggling" and "dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
But AQMD officials and health experts also say it is too soon to celebrate a 
victory over smog. They say ozone levels are still too high in much of the Los 
Angeles Basin and that reduction of other types of pollutants continues to be 
problematic. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawthorne smog station, for example, records among the highest levels of 
two pollutants that come from cars and industry -- carbon monoxide and sulfur 
dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
First the good news: 
</P>
<P>
Ozone, the primary component of smog, dropped to new lows in the just completed 
"smog season." Smog alerts for the invisible pollutant were called in at least 
one city on 41 days this year, AQMD records show. That compares to 54 days in 
1989 and 77 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Air quality officials declare first-stage smog alerts when ozone, the area's 
principal pollutant, reaches .20 parts per million. Second-stage smog alerts 
are declared when ozone reaches .35 parts per million. 
</P>
<P>
Ozone is a "secondary" pollutant that forms in the air when hydrocarbons and 
nitrogen oxides emitted by cars and industry are exposed to sunlight. High 
pressure holds the pollution close to the ground and prevents it from blowing 
away. It is worse in inland areas such as the San Gabriel Valley, where 
temperatures are higher and the air more stagnant. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD officials say ozone has dropped substantially, in large part because of 
greater controls on car exhausts and industrial emissions. "When you compare it 
with the past, it's like night and day," said Joe Cassmassi, senior 
meteorologist with the AQMD. "There's really been a dramatic improvement." 
</P>
<P>
But Cassmassi also said that most of the improvement in the last year can be 
attributed to favorable weather conditions. Low pressure systems frequently 
penetrated the basin, with winds blowing out air that typically stagnates for 
days. 
</P>
<P>
The favorable weather cannot be counted on to continue, Cassmassi said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, air quality officials agree with the common perception among coastal 
residents that ocean air blows away most air pollution. Periodic testing has 
shown low pollution levels near the ocean, although the AQMD has no permanent 
smog stations on the immediate coast. 
</P>
<P>
The coastal veil of relatively clean air, however, does not extend inland as 
far as some people think and is not completely pure. 
</P>
<P>
"People who live near the ocean always think, 'We don't have a smog problem 
here,' " said John R. Holmes, director of research for the California Air 
Resources Board. "They don't usually have an ozone problem, but they do have 
other pollutants." 
</P>
<P>
These other compounds are known as "primary" pollutants because they are spewed 
directly into the air by auto tailpipes and industrial smokestacks. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawthorne AQMD station -- three miles inland and just west of the San Diego 
Freeway -- had the highest readings of the industrial pollutant sulfur dioxide 
in the Los Angeles Basin. The concentration of the pollutant -- which can cause 
coughing and eye, nose and throat irritation -- has increased slightly over the 
last three years, although concentrations are still below the federal safety 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
Carbon monoxide, which comes mostly from car exhausts, is a greater concern in 
Hawthorne. There were 25 days in 1989, the most recent year for which data are 
complete, when the federal standard for the pollutant was exceeded. The 
standard had been exceeded just 18 times in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Carbon monoxide limits the blood's ability to carry oxygen, causing headaches, 
dizziness and shortness of breath. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you really turn around and tell people the air is improving when you are 
only talking about one of the constituents, ozone?" said Dr. Russell Sherwin, a 
professor of pathology at the USC School of Medicine. "We understate, rather 
than overstate, what the problem is." 
</P>
<P>
Significant surveys on the impacts of air pollution have not been conducted in 
the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
But UCLA researchers have concluded that residents in a Long Beach neighborhood 
suffered as great a loss of lung function from air pollution as did residents 
of Glendora, the city with the highest ozone readings in the nation. In the 
study, residents of Long Beach and Glendora were compared with Lancaster, a 
control area with relatively cleaner air. 
</P>
<P>
"Young people tend to have an increase in lung function until the age of about 
25," said Roger Detels, the UCLA professor of epidemiology who conducted the 
study. "But in the polluted areas kids did not have as large an increase as in 
the control area. And after 25 years of age they had a greater decline in lung 
function." 
</P>
<P>
Other research also has documented the health problems caused by air pollution, 
particularly for children. A USC study, for instance, showed that second 
graders in the Los Angeles Unified School District had 10% to 15% less lung 
capacity than a comparable group of children in Houston. And their lung 
capacity did not increase as much between the second and fifth grades as did 
the Houston children's, said Dr. Kaye Kilburn, the USC professor of medicine 
who directed the study. 
</P>
<P>
And Sherwin, the USC pathology professor, found "notable" lung abnormalities in 
80% of 100 Los Angeles-area youths who died in homicides or accidents. 
</P>
<P>
"I think essentially what we have accomplished is to stay in the same place 
over the last decade," Kilburn said. "We have absorbed more people and more 
automobiles and we have managed to not let the air pollution situation get 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
The California Air Resources Board is concerned about elevated levels of 
primary pollutants in southern Los Angeles County, said John R. Holmes, the 
board's director of research. 
</P>
<P>
Air board researchers last December and January surveyed thousands of cars and 
analyzed traffic patterns in Hawthorne and Lynwood, in search of high carbon 
monoxide emissions. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators theorize that poor residents drive older cars that are not 
equipped with contemporary emission-control devices. They also suspect that 
South County neighborhoods suffer because they are crisscrossed by several 
freeways and because poorly synchronized traffic signals increase stop-and-go 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
The air board expects to have results from its study early next year, Holmes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The aim is to get some improvement in those areas, to get the numbers back 
down again," he said.

LIVE-ABOARD LIFESTYLE WAS TOO GOOD TO LAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 15 years, Bob DeLoyd has lived aboard his boat, a breakwater away from the 
open sea and so close to nature that he knows the gulls by name. 
</P>
<P>
People said his lifestyle was too good to be true. This week they were proven 
right. On Tuesday, DeLoyd and six other live-aboard boaters who moor at the far 
edge of Redondo Beach's King Harbor were told they will have to move. 
</P>
<P>
The eviction notice, served by the City Council, was part of the fallout from 
the violent storms of 1988. In just four months that year, towering waves and 
gale-force winds devastated the harbor area, nearly destroyed the Redondo Beach 
Pier and spawned several multimillion-dollar lawsuits against the city. 
</P>
<P>
When the first of those lawsuits -- a claim by the Redondo Beach Marina that 
the city had not adequately protected the harbor -- was settled earlier this 
year, the city agreed, among other things, to buy the mooring area for $1.5 
million and evict its tenants. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the marina had allowed boats to anchor far from the docks and just 
inside the harbor passage to Santa Monica Bay. The area is far from 
comfortable: Phone service is limited, groceries and water have to be hauled in 
by dinghy and there is the annual threat of winter storms. Still, scores of 
boaters accepted the risks and inconvenience as the price of a home that was 
private, tranquil and cheap. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to explain," said Bill Humphreys, a 41-year-old boat builder, 
professional skipper and Vietnam War veteran who has lived in the outer harbor 
for 11 years. "What other people feel when they go backpacking, I feel on a 
daily basis when I go home." 
</P>
<P>
DeLoyd agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"So many people live humdrum lives, with their cars and their electric 
garages," the 39-year-old student said. "I row out to my home. I enjoy the wind 
and the waves and camaraderie that you just don't get in a neighborhood where 
people drive home and watch TV." 
</P>
<P>
Each day, he said, he is awakened by his dog, Porky, whom he would have to give 
up if he kept his boat in a slip, where pets generally are not allowed. When he 
leans over the deck of his 26-foot sailboat "Fancy Free," curious seals pop up 
from the water to say hello. Sea gulls swoop down to eat from his hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I've even named some," DeLoyd said, smiling. "One old bird I've named Horus, 
for the Egyptian god with the wings." 
</P>
<P>
When the first massive storm hit in January, 1988, DeLoyd and Humphreys said, 
they felt excitement rather than fear. Familiar with the elements, they could 
sense what was coming from the rising force of the winter wind and the crash of 
the waves against the breakwater. With other neighbors, they helped 
less-experienced boaters get ashore. 
</P>
<P>
When the skies cleared, buildings had been wrecked, the landmark pier had been 
battered and millions of dollars' worth of damage had been done. But there were 
no injuries among the resilient live-aboards of the outer harbor, and no 
lawsuits filed by them against the city. 
</P>
<P>
There was, however, a suit filed that year by their landlord, the Redondo Beach 
Marina, and when it was settled in April and the city got the moorings, the 
question of municipal liability arose. 
</P>
<P>
Mooring tenants in the outer harbor who had removed their boats during the 1988 
storms were not allowed to return, but a handful, including DeLoyd and 
Humphreys, had managed to ride out the bad weather. At least 10 were living 
aboard their boats, and of these, seven had nowhere else to go. Some complained 
that they could not afford the slip fees at other harbors. Others had boats 
that were too big to moor elsewhere. Still others, like DeLoyd, were loath to 
relinquish their pets or their lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
The live-aboards urged the city to let them stay, and a six-month study ensued. 
But in the end, a city consultant concluded that the safety of live-aboards in 
the outer harbor could not be guaranteed, and the city opted not to seek 
insurance against the risk. 
</P>
<P>
The city did not admit liability in the marina settlement, but at least three 
other storm-related suits filed by King Harbor businesses are still pending. 
</P>
<P>
DeLoyd and his neighbors, caught in the middle of the legal wrangling, contend 
that the city has ousted them not because of the safety risks, but because the 
council is unreasonably fearful of more litigation. 
</P>
<P>
"This city is just paranoid," DeLoyd said. "Nobody out there has ever been hurt 
in a storm or sued the city." 
</P>
<P>
But the council is adamant. 
</P>
<P>
"Living aboard a boat is wonderful and romantic, and I can understand that 
you've done it for a long time," Councilwoman Kay Horrell told the stunned 
live-aboards. 
</P>
<P>
"But when you sit up here and picture things as we do, it's scary. This city 
has lawsuits lined up at the harbor gate and waiting to come in on the tide. . 
. . It would only take one lost life and this city is in deep, deep trouble." 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear what the deadline will be for the people of the outer harbor. 
When the lawsuit was settled, the tenants were given 30 days to move. Humphreys 
said he is unsure what he will do. Perhaps he will simply move beyond the 
harbor, farther out to sea, he said. 
</P>
<P>
DeLoyd said he will look for another harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just devastated," he said. "The whole reason I moved (onto a boat) was to 
get away from stuff like this." 
</P>

3 LATINO RIVALS FOR SUPERVISOR SQUARE OFF; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: THE CANDIDATES TAPE A TV DEBATE. DEMOCRATS MOLINA AND TORRES ATTACK 
REPUBLICAN FLORES. 
</P>

<P>
Three Latinos battling to become a Los Angeles County supervisor met face to 
face for the first time Thursday in a spirited exchange at a TV studio, with 
Democrats Art Torres and Gloria Molina uniting to attack Republican Sarah 
Flores in the nonpartisan race. 
</P>
<P>
"I see the opposition as Sarah Flores," said Molina at a taping of "News 
Conference" at KNBC-TV's studio in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Molina, a Los Angeles city councilwoman, contended that Flores' election would 
preserve a conservative majority on the county board and would continue 
policies that are contrary to Latino interests. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, a soft-spoken former aide to retiring Supervisor Pete Schabarum, 
complained that the board suffers enough from partisan infighting. She promised 
to bring a more cooperative spirit to the board. 
</P>
<P>
But Molina said, "County government needs major reform. . . . You don't need 
somebody who is status quo." She added that what the county does not need is a 
"get-along kind of person." 
</P>
<P>
The debate grew so heated at times that all three candidates were speaking 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, Molina and Torres are among a large field of candidates expected to run 
in a special Jan. 22 election in the new court-drawn 1st District. Rep. Matthew 
Martinez (D-Monterey Park) also is a candidate, and there are several 
lesser-known hopefuls. 
</P>
<P>
The new district boundaries -- designed to help the first Latino in this 
century win a seat on the board -- were approved by U.S. District Judge David 
V. Kenyon who ruled that the boundaries drawn by the all-Anglo board diluted 
the voting power of the county's 3 million Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
During the half-hour show, Flores contended that she is the best qualified to 
be supervisor by virtue of her 34 years of county service. "I have more 
experience when it comes to county government." 
</P>
<P>
But Torres interrupted, "It's going to take more than that." 
</P>
<P>
"Unless you know the people in Sacramento . . . you can do all the talking you 
want," Torres said. "You're going to need somebody more than a field 
representative." 
</P>
<P>
Flores, in turn, blamed Torres and Molina, a former assemblywoman, for the 
county's budget problems. County officials have blamed cuts in services on 
reductions in state funding. 
</P>
<P>
Flores pointed out that the board includes two former assemblymen -- Mike 
Antonovich and Pete Schabarum -- "and it didn't do any good" in helping the 
county obtain more money from Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Molina joined Torres in attacking Flores for receiving support from 
conservative supervisors Antonovich and Deane Dana, who have voted to spend $5 
million fighting the historic voting rights lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were there, that would not have happened," Flores said, referring to the 
legal bills. 
</P>
<P>
"So you're going to ask Schabarum, Dana and Antonovich to take back that money 
and give it to health services," Torres shot back. "Yes or no? You're going to 
tell them I will not accept your endorsement unless you give that money back to 
health care. . . . Tell them, Sarah." 
</P>
<P>
Flores did not respond. Instead, she asked Torres, "Why weren't you there, 
Art?" during the court hearing on the redistricting lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Molina accused Flores of opposing the voting rights suit. Flores, however, 
countered that she did not oppose the lawsuit, but favored a different remedy 
-- her November runoff against Superior Court Judge Greg O'Brien in the old 1st 
District. The runoff was canceled by the federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
The spirited debate took on a humorous note when Torres, observing Flores' 
political consultant, Ron Smith, waving from behind a TV camera to get his 
candidate's attention, said, "Sarah, your promoters are telling you to smile 
more." 
</P>
<P>
The show will air at 2:30 p.m. Sunday on Channel 4.

STATE HOPES TO REVIVE HIGH DESERT FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State transportation officials said Thursday that they hope to revive 
long-delayed plans to build an east-west freeway through the Antelope Valley 
within 20 years, serving local commuters and long-distance travelers looking 
for a road around Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal for the six-lane freeway got a boost this week when Antelope 
Valley government and business leaders endorsed a route. Caltrans officials 
said they plan to launch an environmental study of it early next year and hope 
to win approval for the project within several years. 
</P>
<P>
The freeway would run about 70 miles east from the Golden State Freeway near 
Gorman across the Antelope Valley to California 18 at the Los Angeles-San 
Bernardino county line. The project would cost billions of dollars, but state 
officials do not have a precise estimate. 
</P>
<P>
"Building a freeway in a growing area can provide a lot more benefit than in an 
urban, congested area," said Wally Rothbart, a Caltrans official in Los 
Angeles. "Within 20 years, I think we can see the freeway will be in place." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed freeway would be designated California 138. It would replace both 
the Metropolitan Bypass route across the Antelope Valley adopted by Caltrans in 
the 1960s that was never built and the current California 138 that is mostly a 
collection of two- and four-lane roads. 
</P>
<P>
At the regional level, transportation officials said the new freeway would 
offer north-south travelers an alternative to the Golden State Freeway through 
Los Angeles. In the Antelope Valley, it would relieve congestion on Palmdale 
Boulevard, which is part of the current California 138. 
</P>
<P>
The route endorsed this week by Antelope Valley officials would run from the 
Golden State Freeway to the Antelope Valley Freeway near Lancaster along a line 
south of Avenue E. It would join the Antelope Valley Freeway south to Avenue 
P-8 in Palmdale and head southeast to the county line. 
</P>
<P>
The Avenue P-8 segment through Palmdale would route the freeway past the new 
Antelope Valley Mall, the major aerospace employers at Air Force Plant 42, and 
the adjoining 17,000-acre area to the east where the city of Los Angeles still 
plans to build a major regional airport someday. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans had to abandon the old Metropolitan Bypass route in part because 
housing development has encroached on the right of way since its designation in 
1966. Caltrans officials said the new route's right of way is mostly clear and 
urged local officials to keep it open for future use. 
</P>
<P>
The new freeway route had been suggested by a 16-month, $175,000 study 
sponsored by the Southern California Assn. of Governments. Ultimately, the 
state Transportation Commission would have to designate the new route, possibly 
in 1992 or 1994, officials said.

A former employee of the Los Angeles-based United Church of Religious Science 
has filed a lawsuit accusing the organization's trustees and administrators of 
bribery, racial discrimination and embezzlement of more than $10 million in 
church funds since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Jack L. Griffin, 37, also claimed in a Los Angeles Superior Court suit filed 
Oct. 22 that he was wrongfully terminated as an operations coordinator at the 
church's mid-Wilshire district headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
He told a news conference Thursday that he was fired after giving the church's 
accounting firm information documenting the alleged fiscal improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin alleged that computer records he provided the auditor reveal that more 
than $10 million in church assets was used to pay personal expenses of church 
officers and trustees and to pay for "kickbacks from and overpayment to" 
companies the church did business with, including computer vendors, real estate 
developers and building contractors.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GROUND BROKEN FOR NEW SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Caltrans and Inglewood school officials held a ground-breaking ceremony this 
week for a new $2.7-million school that will replace Kew Elementary School, 
which is in the path of the Century Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The state agency has agreed to build the 14,000-square-foot school in a field 
next to Bennett Elementary School on South Cherry Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The new Bennett-Kew complex, scheduled to be completed in August, 1991, will 
house about 1,000 students, compared to the 810 currently enrolled in the two 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Kew students will be moved to portable classrooms on the Bennett site within 
the next few months so that the Kew buildings on Yukon Avenue can be 
demolished, school district spokesman Maurice Wiley said. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood school officials entered into the agreement with Caltrans for the 
replacement school in 1986.

NEW SCHOOL BOARD PRESIDENT HAS ROCKY DEBUT; 
</P>
<P>
CENTINELA VALLEY: RACIAL TENSIONS CONTINUE AS PAM STURGEON IS ACCUSED OF 
TURNING HER BACK ON BLACKS IN THE DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Centinela Valley Union High School District trustee Pam Sturgeon had barely 
taken the gavel as the board's new president Tuesday night when a board critic, 
who is black, accused her of currying the favor of the predominantly Latino 
board at the expense of blacks in the district. 
</P>
<P>
"What (he) was saying is that I went and talked to the blacks, made friends 
with them and now I'm turning my back on them," Sturgeon, who is white, said in 
an interview Thursday. "But that's not true by any stretch of the imagination." 
</P>
<P>
The incident illustrates a continuation of racial tensions that have engulfed 
the district in the past year, and although the campuses recently have been 
quiet, the board's meetings remain contentious. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Ruth Morales -- who Tuesday stepped down from the presidency after 
serving a third one-year term since being elected to the board 12 years ago -- 
presided over numerous raucous meetings in the past year. During the 1989-90 
school year, students staged two walkouts, and several black employees filed 
complaints of racial harassment against the board. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, critics repeatedly accused the board of treating black 
employees and students unfairly. But board members, who deny the allegations, 
have said they have been the targets of a conspiracy to discredit them 
politically. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting on her tenure in a press release issued Tuesday, Morales said, 
"There was a certain amount of joy, despite the problems and harassment of the 
past year, in knowing that in service (you are) making a difference with young 
people." 
</P>
<P>
In one of her first official actions as board president Tuesday, Sturgeon 
called sheriff's deputies to the podium when community activist Stennis Floyd 
refused to obey board rules requiring that speakers refrain from insulting 
district employees. 
</P>
<P>
Sturgeon, who praised Morales for doing "a really good job under the 
circumstances last year" as board president, said she hopes to "take control of 
the meetings" as well as her predecessor did. 
</P>
<P>
The board also voted unanimously to name trustee Jacqueline Carrera as vice 
president and trustee Amparo Font as clerk.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: YOUTH CHARGED IN DELGADO SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Hawthorne teen-ager was charged with murder Wednesday in the shooting death 
of Leuzinger High School student Robert Delgado, 16, who had recently joined a 
gang, a spokeswoman with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Information Bureau 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old suspect, whose name was withheld because he is a juvenile, had 
been suspended from Leuzinger High School for fighting but returned to campus 
Nov. 5 and became embroiled in a fight with Delgado, Deputy Britta Rodela said. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, soon after school was dismissed, the suspect drove to the 
house where Delgado was standing with a group of friends waiting for a ride 
home and shot him, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although police arrested three adults in connection with the shooting, charges 
have been filed only against the juvenile, Rodela said. He was charged with 
murder in Inglewood Juvenile Court.

<P>
Wayne Maddox recalled Bo Schembechler sitting in his living room in Bedford, 
Tex., watching "Monday Night Football" on television. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler was there to recruit Maddox's son, Tommy, to play quarterback for 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Then Schembechler heard Dan Dierdorf, whom he had once coached, say on TV: "Jim 
Harbaugh is from that great quarterback factory, Michigan." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Maddox said it was a facetious remark but it got a response from 
Schembechler, who said, "I'm going to kill that Dierdorf." 
</P>
<P>
The elder Maddox said, though, that Schembechler had been a convincing, 
charming recruiter with plenty of company in the Maddox endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana State, Texas A&amp;M, and Brigham Young were among the other schools 
that recruited Tommy Maddox. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Maddox said that Tommy was leaning toward Michigan until he visited UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"When he got home from California, Tommy said, 'I know where I'm going to 
school -- UCLA,' " Wayne said. 
</P>
<P>
So that ended the recruitment of Tommy Maddox, who as a star athlete at L.D. 
Bell High in Hurst, Tex., had scholarship offers in basketball and baseball as 
well as football. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Maddox said that he and his older son, Mark, worked "quietly in the 
shadows" screening prospective schools for Tommy. 
</P>
<P>
"But the final decision was his," Wayne said. 
</P>
<P>
That decision has already been rewarding for UCLA as it prepares for its final 
regular-season game Saturday against USC at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Maddox, who is only 19 and a redshirt freshman, has demonstrated his skills 
though 10 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
He has completed 54.4% of his passes for 2,273 yards, 14 touchdowns and 11 
interceptions. He is the Pacific 10 Conference's total offense leader, 
averaging 238.5 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
He is also the league leader in passing yards per attempt with 7.92, and in 
yards per completion with 14.57. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics, however, don't reveal his poise, his awareness and the snap-like 
delivery he has on his passes. 
</P>
<P>
"He can throw a perfect overhanded delivery and a side-arm delivery and all 
things in between," said Homer Smith, UCLA's offensive coordinator. "He throws 
like an infielder throwing a baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"He has natural arm strength, and it will become stronger when he acquires more 
muscles." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Maddox said that Tommy didn't consider staying home and playing for a 
Texas school because many of them were on probation at the time and ran veer or 
wishbone offenses that weren't suited to his son's talents. 
</P>
<P>
"Now (Southwest schools are) throwing the ball all over the place," Wayne 
Maddox said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Wayne said, UCLA is the perfect school for his son in his maturation 
as a quarterback with Smith as a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne said that Tommy Maddox was very tall and slender, but never clumsy as a 
youngster. 
</P>
<P>
"However, he had more talent in basketball than football," Wayne said. "When he 
was 10 or 11 years old, he played basketball in an international sports 
festival in Orlando, Fla.," Wayne said. "His football development didn't start 
until his junior year in high school." 
</P>
<P>
As a senior, Maddox averaged 35.8 points a game in basketball, had a 7-1 record 
as a baseball pitcher and passed for 2,601 yards and 18 touchdowns in football. 
He is the leading passer and basketball scorer in the history of his high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne and his wife, Glynda, live in what is called the mid-cities area of 
Texas, the tri-communities of Bedford, Hurst and Euless midway between Dallas 
and Ft. Worth. 
</P>
<P>
High school football is immensely popular in the area, as it is all over the 
state, and Tommy Maddox played before relatively large crowds. 
</P>
<P>
"In high school you're put in a lot of pressure situations and you have to get 
used to handling it," Tommy said. "It's something that you have to learn to 
love, or tell yourself to love. I just look at pressure as something that comes 
along with the territory. I don't worry about things. I have a lot of 
confidence in my teammates, and myself." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne, Glynda, and brother Mark are his biggest boosters. 
</P>
<P>
Mark was an outstanding high school quarterback who enrolled at, then left, 
Southern Methodist his freshman year when the football program was temporarily 
canceled. He transferred to Texas Christian where he became a pitcher on the 
baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
Now the family is seemingly devoted to Tommy's career. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne is an agency sales manager for an insurance company, and Glynda works in 
the international relations office for an airline. 
</P>
<P>
"Glynda didn't work for 25 years until Tommy went to UCLA," Wayne said, but one 
of the perks of Glynda's job is reduced air fare on flights to all parts of the 
country. So, Wayne and Glynda fly from Texas for every UCLA game. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne said he and his wife intend to be here today in time to attend UCLA's 
final practice before Saturday's USC game. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne, who played football in high school and junior college before he suffered 
a knee injury, said that he and Mark have coached Tommy, working on such things 
as a quick release on passes. 
</P>
<P>
He added, though, that Tommy was not pressured into a daily regimen of 
athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"He hunted and fished and had fun and was just an average, red-blooded American 
boy," Wayne said. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Maddox has already out-played such highly regarded quarterbacks as 
Oregon's Bill Musgrave and Washington's Mark Brunell. 
</P>
<P>
Now he will be matched against either Todd Marinovich or Shane Foley in his 
first experience of the cross-town rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my first USC game and I'm looking forward to it," Maddox said. "It will 
be just as tough and maybe tougher than the Washington game. They're a great 
team and they're going to a bowl game and it's going to be highly intense. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm from Texas and I didn't know much about (the rivalry). But when you come 
out here you feel it, and a lot of the players we have grew up with the USC 
players and played with them and against them."

ALYDAR, RUNNER-UP IN RACING RIVALRY, HAS TO BE DESTROYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alydar was buried Thursday at Calumet Farm in Lexington, Ky., not far from the 
grave markers of Whirlaway and Citation, only hours after he had to be 
destroyed at the height of his breeding career. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1940s, Whirlaway and Citation were Calumet's Triple Crown champions, 
sweeping a series that eluded Alydar in 1978 only because he came along in the 
same year as Affirmed, who beat him by 1 1/2 lengths in the Kentucky Derby, by 
a neck in the Preakness and by a head in the Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
"If it hadn't been for our horse, Alydar would have been able to say, 'Move 
over, 
</P>
<P>
Secretariat,' " Patrice Wolfson said Thursday. Louis Wolfson and his wife 
campaigned Affirmed, the 11th and most recent Triple Crown winner. Secretariat 
swept the series in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
A veterinarian gave Alydar a lethal injection Thursday morning. The 15-year-old 
stallion had kicked his stall door at Calumet Tuesday night, breaking his right 
hind leg above the ankle, and on Wednesday, with little hope for success, 
surgeons worked two hours to repair the injury. 
</P>
<P>
With a metal plate and five steel pins in his leg, Alydar was uncomfortable 
with his cast and resisted his sling Thursday morning. He was tranquilized, and 
15 minutes after the sling was removed, he slipped and fell, breaking the femur 
bone in the upper part of the right hind leg. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a heartbreaker," said J.T. Lundy, president of Calumet. "He was a game 
horse all the way. He fought right to the end." 
</P>
<P>
Alydar's loss is one of many in a year that may rank as racing's worst in terms 
of deaths and injuries to important horses. 
</P>
<P>
Go For Wand, 100 yards from a possible victory in the Breeders' Cup Distaff, 
broke down and was destroyed at Belmont Park on Oct. 27, not long after a spill 
that resulted in the deaths of two other horses. 
</P>
<P>
Grand Canyon, one of last year's best 2-year-olds, was destroyed this summer 
after being stricken with an incurable hoof disease, and Sunday Silence, Easy 
Goer and Criminal Type head a long list of talented horses that missed the 
Breeders' Cup because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Two major stallions -- Fappiano and The Minstrel -- were destroyed on the same 
day in September because of injury and illness. 
</P>
<P>
Alydar, the sire of Easy Goer and Criminal Type, lost seven of 10 races to 
Affirmed -- one of his victories, in the Travers at Saratoga, was the result of 
a disqualification -- but in the breeding shed he surpassed his racing rival by 
far. The leading stallion this year according to purses won, Alydar also sired 
Alysheba, the 1988 horse of the year; and Turkoman, a divisional champion. 
Alysheba won the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and Breeders' Cup Classic, and 
Easy Goer the Belmont. This year, Criminal Type is a cinch divisional champion 
and a strong candidate for horse of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Affirmed never got going in stud, and a few years ago was moved from 
Spendthrift Farm to Calumet, where he occupied a paddock next to Alydar's. 
</P>
<P>
Laz Barrera, Affirmed's trainer, visited both horses a few days before this 
year's Kentucky Derby. Barrera, in Kentucky Wednesday for some horse sales, was 
back at Santa Anita Thursday morning, when Wayne Lukas, Criminal Type's 
trainer, told him of Alydar's death. 
</P>
<P>
"I had heard Wednesday that Alydar was in bad shape," Barrera said. "When Wayne 
told me, it broke my heart. Alydar gave me a lot of headaches, but he was a 
great horse and this is a big tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never see another rivalry like Affirmed and Alydar in my lifetime. Their 
races did so much for racing. They did more for racing than anything I've ever 
seen." 
</P>
<P>
Alydar, who was elected to the Hall of Fame at Saratoga Springs, N.Y., in 1989, 
earned $957,195 and won 14 of 26 starts, including the Champagne as a 
2-year-old and the Florida Derby, the Flamingo, the Blue Grass, the Travers and 
the Whitney Handicap as a 3-year-old. He and Affirmed never met after the 
Travers, Alydar's career quickly winding down after he suffered a training 
injury in the fall of 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"All of my memories of Alydar are great," said John Veitch, who trained the 
colt. "Every time he ran, he never gave up." 
</P>
<P>
After Affirmed and Alydar in the 1978 Triple Crown, there was no one else. 
Alydar outdistanced the third-place finishers in the Derby, the Preakness and 
the Belmont by 1 1/4, 7 1/2 and 13 lengths, becoming the only horse to run 
second in all three races. Against horses other than Affirmed, Alydar won 11 of 
16 starts. 
</P>
<P>
"We just ran into another great horse," Alydar's jockey, Jorge Velasquez, said 
at Hollywood Park Thursday. "Every time we'd get close to Affirmed, he kept 
coming back. I'm not sure if we got ahead of him in the (stretch run of the) 
Belmont. If we did, it was only by a half of a head, maybe. I'm very sad that 
he died. This is terrible. It's a big loss for the industry."

MIKE DOWNEY: SUDDENLY, THE MAN IS AN EXPERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
They all laughed last year when I picked UCLA to defeat USC. "At what?" they 
asked. "Synchronized swimming?" One guy in my office who attended USC wondered 
aloud how I could write such a thing and expect to be taken seriously. Hey, 
babe, I don't like to be taken seriously. I just like to be taken. 
</P>
<P>
Anyhow, they would have laughed just as hard last year had I picked UCLA to 
defeat Cal State Fullerton . . . or Cal Tech . . . or Kal Daniels. Not only did 
UCLA's 1989 team not belong in the Rose Bowl, it couldn't have been elected 
best float in the Rose parade. The queen's dress had better material than Terry 
Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, that didn't stop me. Bravely, I went with UCLA. On USC's field, yet. I 
demonstrated my courage. I danced with wolves. I dared the men of Troy to spit 
in my eye. But after the game, they couldn't. Their chins were too low. 
</P>
<P>
USC lost to UCLA, 10-10. 
</P>
<P>
I know, I know; that's a tie. But I know and you know -- and you know that 
everybody else knows -- that the Trojans got their helmets handed to them. They 
had excellent football players -- even beat Michigan in the Rose Bowl -- but 
they couldn't beat UCLA. The Bruins tied them up, tied them down. 
</P>
<P>
It was the definite highlight of a UCLA season in which the players protected 
Donahue's consecutive streak of victories in bowl games by not playing in one. 
This is a major accomplishment, by the way, in an American era in which bowl 
games outnumber Taco Bells and 7-Elevens, two to one. 
</P>
<P>
For USC, last year's game was a terrible disappointment, mostly because from 
November to January, all the student body had to look forward to was . . . 
yuck, basketball. 
</P>
<P>
And now, 12 months later, they're back! . . . Trojans and Bruins! . . . you 
know 'em, you love 'em! . . . well, you know 'em! . . . to clash in college 
football's greatest rivalry! . . . unless, of course, you attended Michigan, 
Ohio State, Harvard, Yale, Navy, Army, Stanford, Cal, Texas, Texas A&amp;M, 
Wabash or DePauw! . . . Saturday in Pasadena, 12:30 p.m., be there! . . . (or 
be somewhere else). 
</P>
<P>
And I know what you're asking: 
</P>
<P>
"Mike, who's gonna win?" 
</P>
<P>
Well, first off, let me tell you right up front that I haven't the slightest 
idea where you get the nerve to think you know me well enough to call me by my 
first name. And next off, look: I have no personal stake in this game. I did 
not attend UCLA. I did not go to USC. The college I attended barely had indoor 
toilets, much less football. We didn't even have cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
Read my lips: I don't care which team wins. 
</P>
<P>
But what the heck, I'll take a shot. It's the least I can do. (The most I can 
do being early retirement.) My boss is pretty worried that I'll insult 
somebody. My boss is one of those guys who believes in being overly respectful 
and polite and mealy-mouthed about every college football team in America. My 
boss went to Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Here's my USC-UCLA scouting report: 
</P>
<P>
TOMMY vs. TODD: Tommy (Auto) Maddox, the UCLA quarterback, has had a better 
season than Todd (Classes? I Don't Need No Stinking Classes) Marinovich, and I 
predict that if Marinovich should decide to turn pro by the end of the season, 
Maddox should decide to turn pro by the end of Saturday's third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy the gun has been one fresh freshman. Only two things kept UCLA from 
having a miserable season, and one of them was Maddox. The other one was 
Stanford, which prides itself on keeping just about everybody from having a 
miserable season. 
</P>
<P>
As for Todd, should he even start? Larry Smith takes out Shane Foley after 
touchdown drives. Does Foley use too many plays when he leads USC to 
touchdowns? Does he drink too much Gatorade on the sideline? Does he wipe his 
dirty hands on the coach's shirt? What? Come back, Shane, come back! 
</P>
<P>
COACH RED vs. COACH BLUE: I call them that because Smith is always mad and 
Donahue is always sad. 
</P>
<P>
At least, it seems that way. Larry dislikes agents rubbing elbows with his 
players and NFL scouts attending practice and referees suspending games because 
of thunderstorms. Terry thinks everybody in the media is negative unless the 
next day's headline reads: UCLA LOSES AGAIN, BUT TRIES REALLY, REALLY HARD. 
</P>
<P>
This game means a possible Liberty Bowl trip for UCLA, putting Donahue's bowl 
streak on the line. The Liberty Bowl is in Memphis. If UCLA wins Saturday, the 
most valuable player should face the TV cameras and say: "I'm going to 
Graceland!" 
</P>
<P>
BATTLE OF THE BANDS: Advantage, USC. The UCLA team does not have a chance in 
hell to win this game, and might forfeit it, if the Trojan band plays that 
school song over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over 
and over and over, as is its custom. Saddam Hussein would surrender if 
subjected to similar treatment. 
</P>
<P>
THE REAL ROSE BOWL: This is it. Lord knows you don't want to watch that thing 
coming up New Year's Day. What is it, Washington against Iowa? Boy, I can 
hardly wait. That game won't even interest people from Washington or Iowa. That 
game will have TV ratings like "Cop Rock." 
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's big Troy-Donahue battle, I'll go with the Trojans by a couple of 
points. But I could be wrong. Could be three.

<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: SEAY FORGIVES CS LONG BEACH BUT WON'T FORGET WHAT IT HAS COST 
HIM TO PLAY WITH ONE KIDNEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mark Seay did not attend a children's party this Halloween. "My sister and I 
talked about having one and then we thought, 'Oh, no, remember what happened 
the last time,' " said the Cal State Long Beach football player who was shot by 
a suspected gang member at a Halloween party two years ago as he shielded his 
2-year-old niece. 
</P>
<P>
Seay, who lost a kidney as a result of the shooting, still feels betrayed by 
university officials who would not let him play last year because of the risk 
of damaging his other kidney. He is playing now only after taking legal action 
against the university. 
</P>
<P>
The junior wide receiver will finish his comeback season Saturday when the 
49ers play Nevada Las Vegas at Veterans Stadium. Seay is among the leading 
receivers in the Big West Conference with 45 catches for 709 yards. He has 
caught four touchdown passes. Last Saturday, he caught a tipped two-point 
conversion pass as Long Beach defeated Cal State Northridge, 25-24. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not satisfied, but it's gone pretty good," Seay said. "If I don't perform 
the way I should, if I'm not happy, I always think about the time when I 
thought I'd never be playing again." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Coach George Allen said: "He's an example for all of us, what I call 
a solid citizen. He's a leader. One of the highlights of my coaching career is 
having a guy like Mark Seay on my team." 
</P>
<P>
The only difference Seay has noticed in playing football with one kidney rather 
than two is the extra protective equipment he must wear. "I put on a pad that 
protects my back area and my hip, and then I put on a flak jacket," he said. 
"At first, I just wanted to yank it off because I was the type of player who 
wore as few pads as I could get away with." 
</P>
<P>
But he is glad he has worn it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been hit as hard as I've been hit this year," said Seay, who is 6 
feet and 175 pounds. "I've taken my share of hits." 
</P>
<P>
Only once, in a game at Jack Murphy Stadium against San Diego State, was he 
worried. "A guy was on top of my back and slammed me into the infield area 
where it's all dirt. I coughed up some blood. That was scary. But I didn't 
think it had anything to do with my kidney." 
</P>
<P>
Seay has detected a tendency in people to think that when he makes a mistake in 
a game, it must be related to his disability. 
</P>
<P>
Against New Mexico State, an embarrassed Seay caught a kickoff and, thinking he 
was in the end zone instead of on the two-yard line, dropped to one knee and 
downed the ball. "Some of the (assistant) coaches didn't think I was myself, I 
think simply because of what happened to my kidney," Seay said. "It made me 
angry. They kept asking me how I felt. I felt great. I just didn't know where I 
was. It could have happened to anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Seay said he has a urine test after each game and has had one 24-hour 
creatinine clearance test -- a measure of kidney function. "They said I was 
fine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Dan Bailey said last week that he could not discuss Seay's kidney tests 
because, he said, Seay never signed a consent form, as most players do, for 
release of medical information to the media. 
</P>
<P>
Seay has chosen to play despite the prospect of having to be hooked to a 
dialysis machine should his remaining kidney be damaged. 
</P>
<P>
"I think about that all the time," he said. "It could happen, nothing's 
promised to you in this world. But I'm 23 years old, and I'm not going to let 
anyone dictate my life. I was cheated out of one (kidney). If I'm going to lose 
this one, I'm not going to be cheated. I'm going to end up losing it doing 
something I want to do." 
</P>
<P>
The quiet, introspective Seay, who grew up in San Bernardino, has been besieged 
with interview requests. He realizes he will probably always be known for 
having one kidney rather than for his football playing ability. "I didn't ask 
for any of this," he said. "A lot of times I don't know what to do with it. I'm 
not the type of guy who likes being in the spotlight." 
</P>
<P>
But one has shined brightly on him nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
He seems perplexed by the national acclaim he received for saving his niece. "I 
never have thought of myself as a hero," he said. "I'd like to know who made up 
the word hero, because really I don't know what it is. I look at myself as I 
did before this even happened. I am what I am; I'm nothing more or nothing 
less. If they want to keep calling me a hero, and that's what makes them happy, 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
When Seay awoke in the hospital after his kidney was removed, he wondered if he 
would play football again. He said university officials, including President 
Curtis McCray and Athletic Director Corey Johnson, visited him. "They said, 'We 
hope you make it back, we're behind you 100%,' " Seay recalled. "I felt good 
because these people were among the reasons I came to this university." 
</P>
<P>
In January 1989, Seay returned to classes and began working out. He suited up 
for spring practice and fully expected to play in the 1989 season. He recalled 
visiting McCray in his office. "He told me he'd do anything in his power to see 
that I was back out there," Seay said. 
</P>
<P>
But in June Seay was told by Johnson and team physician Robert Austin that he 
was being declared medically ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a shock," Seay said. "They told me I wouldn't be able to go to another 
school because I wouldn't be accepted, and as far as going pro (was concerned), 
I wouldn't be able to pass the physical. They said the best thing was to retire 
and be a coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish they would have let me know what was going on up front so I could have 
known what to do with myself. There were no warnings, nothing. I was in a lot 
of stress. They left me with no support. They're dealing with young men, not 
professionals. If I was a weak-minded person, I could have committed suicide. 
You do not play with young men's lives like that." 
</P>
<P>
Seay sued the university in an effort to keep playing, but in September 1989, a 
U.S. district judge, saying that there was insufficient evidence to determine 
if Seay's remaining kidney was working properly, denied a request for an 
injunction that would have forced the university to let him play. 
</P>
<P>
"At the hearing, instead of Corey coming up to me and saying, 'I'm sorry,' he 
came up and said, 'So what's next, are you going to be a coach?' " 
</P>
<P>
Last winter, with the case expected to proceed to trial, Long Beach hired Allen 
as its football coach. "I didn't start feeling better until he came," Seay 
said. "I knew he was behind me when he told me, 'If they don't let you play 
here, I can get you a shot in the NFL . . . but I know they're going to let you 
play.' " 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, the lawsuit was settled out of court, and Seay, after passing 
medical tests, was allowed to rejoin the 49ers this season. He signed a waiver 
absolving the university of liability if he should suffer an injury to his 
kidney. 
</P>
<P>
"It was difficult to deny him his dream," Johnson said at a news conference at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
"They tried, anyway," Seay said the other day. "If they didn't think they were 
gong to lose (in a trial), I'm sure they would have stuck to their position. 
But I have no animosity toward them. I forgive them but I don't forget, I'll 
never forget." 
</P>
<P>
Seay's smile was brilliant Saturday afternoon after the 49ers had beaten 
Northridge on his two-point conversion catch. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark, Mark," a silver-haired man called. It was McCray, the university 
president, rushing up with congratulations. It was a special moment, and Seay 
basked in it. 
</P>
<P>
He walked off the field looking like any other football hero, and it was hard 
to imagine that he has only one kidney and that the bullet that pierced his 
other one is lodged three inches from his heart.

TRIAL DATE SET FOR GATHERS LAWSUITS; 
</P>
<P>
LOYOLA: ATTORNEYS SAY A MEETING MIGHT BE HELD IN DECEMBER TO DISCUSS 
SETTLEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A trial date of Sept. 3, 1991, was set by a Los Angeles County Superior judge 
Thursday for hearing lawsuits related to the death of Hank Gathers. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, a basketball player at Loyola Marymount University, died last spring 
of cardiomyopathy, a heart disorder, shortly after he was stricken during a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys representing 14 defendants and six plaintiffs, including Gathers' 
estate, appeared before Judge Gary Hastings in a Southwest District Court in 
Torrance for a status conference of two multimillion-dollar suits, which were 
filed separately in April and June on behalf of Gathers' family and his estate 
and son. The suits have since been consolidated and will be tried as one. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers collapsed March 4 while playing in a West Coast Conference tournament 
game and was pronounced dead 1 hour 40 minutes later. The suits, filed against 
then-Loyola Coach Paul Westhead, Loyola Marymount and 12 other defendants, 
claim that Gathers died because of negligence by doctors and school employees. 
</P>
<P>
There have been no settlement discussions since the suits were filed, although 
attorneys say a meeting may be held in December. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been some discussion of a voluntary settlement conference before the 
end of the year," said Wayne Boehle, the attorney who represents Loyola and its 
employees. "It would be presided over by a third party, who would have no power 
to act but would help try to settle the case." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Fagel, who represents Gathers' mother, Lucille, brothers Derrick and 
Charles and an aunt, Carol Livingston, agreed that there is a chance the 
conference will be held during the second week of December but said he wouldn't 
bet on that happening. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is, this case should settle but may not because the defendants 
cannot get their act together," Fagel said. "The university wants the doctors 
to pay, but the doctors have limited liability. The university has unlimited 
liability. Then there are six different law firms and that is difficult to 
coordinate. 
</P>
<P>
"My clients do not want a trial but will go if they have to." 
</P>
<P>
Fagel's suit, for $32.5 million, was filed April 20. The second suit, for an 
unspecified figure, was filed June 8 by Philadelphia attorney Martin Krimsky on 
behalf of Gathers' estate and Aaron Crump, Gathers' 6-year-old son who lives in 
Philadelphia with his mother, Marva Crump. 
</P>
<P>
"If this case goes to trial it will be a long, complicated case because there 
are so many issues," Fagel said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, attorneys for the defendants continue to file for the dismissal of 
specific causes of actions listed in the complaints. Last month a commissioner 
tossed out two causes of action and sent others back to Krimsky and Fagel for 
revision. Fagel has amended his complaint and refiled. 
</P>
<P>
"To put it simply, the motions that we have filed since are to take a lot of 
the water out of the complaint and get it down to what can easily be issues 
that need to be decided by a jury," Boehle said. "If they can be reduced, we 
will end up with just the wrongful-death action."

NEWSWIRE: EDWARDS: CAL COULD FACE BOYCOTT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harry Edwards, a University of California sociology professor, said Thursday a 
decision to play in the Copper Bowl could lead to a boycott of the Berkeley 
school by black athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, who gained national attention when he organized a boycott of the 1968 
Mexico City Olympic Games to protest what he described as exploitation of black 
athletes, said he has been contacted regarding a nationwide effort to dissuade 
black athletes from attending Cal. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is organizing a petition that will be signed by the university's 
black faculty members protesting the decision to play in the bowl game Dec. 31 
at Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards said there is a possibility of protests outside Memorial Stadium 
Saturday during the Bears' game against Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Cal has come under criticism for announcing it will accept an invitation to 
play in Arizona despite the controversy there over a state holiday honoring 
Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona residents voted down measures that would have declared a holiday for 
the late civil rights leader.

Defensive end Jeff Cross, leader of the Miami Pound Machine with 10 sacks, said 
the Dolphin defense has improved since last season because of consistency. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just playing a straight-up defense," Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just lining up and getting after people." 
</P>
<P>
So how will the Raiders attack the Dolphin defense Monday night in Miami? 
</P>
<P>
"They're a very good football team, and they're playing extremely well," Raider 
quarterback Jay Schroeder said of the Dolphins. "But I have confidence that the 
guys up front are going to be able to block them." 
</P>
<P>
Injuries: Raider safety Eddie Anderson (knee injury), receiver Jamie Holland 
(foot) and defensive tackle Bill Pickel (back) are listed as probable. Dolphin 
safety Bobby Harden (hamstring) is doubtful; fullbacks Marc Logan (knee) and 
Tony Paige (knee), and defensive end Karl Wilson (ankle) are questionable; 
linebacker John Offerdahl (toe) is probable. CHRIS BAKER

NORMAN CAN'T MISS THIS EVENT; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF: SORE WRIST AND ALL, HE'S THE FEATURED PERFORMER IN CHARITY TOURNAMENT AT 
THOUSAND OAKS.

Greg Norman's right wrist doesn't hurt all the time. Only when he hits a golf 
ball. This, of course, would be OK if he was, say, a field-goal kicker. But 
when your resume lists your profession as World's Best Golfer, then a bum wrist 
is a real problem. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a pain in the wrist when the club strikes the ball, Norman will tee it 
up and wince for three days starting this morning in the $1-million Ronald 
McDonald Children's Charities Invitational at Sherwood Country Club in Thousand 
Oaks. Among Norman's playmates in the 54-hole event are Jack Nicklaus, Arnold 
Palmer, Curtis Strange, Ray Floyd, Mark Calcavecchia and Chi Chi Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament's goal is to surpass the $1 million that last year's inaugural 
event raised for charities, which Norman said would ease his pain a bit. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors have determined that the pain in his wrist is caused by an arthritic 
condition in an area that Norman injured during a football game as a youth. 
</P>
<P>
And it will not, he has been told, get any better. 
</P>
<P>
"It actually hurts pretty bad on about 80% of my shots," said Norman, who 
reinjured the wrist during the 1988 U.S. Open at Brookline but, despite the 
pain, climbed to the No. 1 spot on the PGA money list in 1990 with $1,165,477, 
winning the Doral Open and the Memorial tournament along the way. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned to put up with it most of the year, and now I have to learn to put 
up with it forever, the doctors said. Even surgery would be no guarantee." 
</P>
<P>
For the spectators -- the few, the proud and the rich who shelled out $200 
apiece for a ticket -- the unique tournament offers guaranteed enjoyment. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 two-man teams will play a different format each day, starting with 
today's best-ball round. Saturday, the teams will play alternate shot, and 
Sunday, some of the best golfers in the world will play a duffer's delight, the 
scramble, in which the best shot of each player becomes the team's shot. For 
example, each golfer hits the ball off the tee and then selects the better of 
the two drives. From that point, each partner drops a ball and hits his second 
shot. The pattern continues onto the greens, where each player putts from the 
same spot. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's winning team of Strange and Mark O'Meara rattled the very difficult 
Sherwood course to the tune of 26 under par for 54 holes, including a round of 
10-under-par 62 on the final day using the scramble format. The 62, however, 
was four strokes behind the scramble round's best score of 58 turned in by 
Norman and Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
Challenging Strange-O'Meara and Norman-Nicklaus this year will be the teams of 
Palmer-Peter Jacobsen, Bruce Lietzke-Andy Bean, Rodriguez-John Mahaffey, Gil 
Morgan-Tom Weiskopf, Wayne Levi-Hale Irwin, Calcavecchia-Ian Baker-Finch (not a 
threesome), Lanny Wadkins-Ben Crenshaw and Floyd-Fred Couples. 
</P>
<P>
And the tournament is not entirely for charity. The winning team will split 
$250,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Levi-Irwin team may be the best of the bunch, at least from this year's 
performances. Levi won four tournaments and $1,024,647, ranking him second on 
the money list to Norman. Irwin was sixth with $838,249 and won the U.S. Open 
in June, following it the next week with a victory in the Buick tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The idea for this event came from Norman two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I was talking with a friend after a member-guest tournament in which we had 
used this format," Norman said earlier in the week while practicing at 
Sherwood. "And I wondered, 'What would this format be like with the best 
golfers in the world?' I brought the idea to the McDonald's people, and bang, 
here we are." 
</P>
<P>
The personal preference of Norman is the scramble. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yeah, that's the one," he said. "I think all aggressive players like the 
scramble. It lets you let it out, to reach back a bit and give it a little 
extra pop. I like it a lot." 
</P>
<P>
And the tournament, Norman said, appears to have found a permanent home. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the place," he said. "At the time, it was just the right place at the 
right time and it was available. But now, knowing what we know about the course 
and the whole area, there will be nowhere else for this tournament. It's such a 
beautiful spot." 
</P>
<P>
With a $150,000 membership fee and the purchase of a home or home site around 
the course a stipulation for membership, you would guess it might be a 
beautiful spot. 
</P>
<P>
"If I lived in the L.A. area and could afford to belong to this club, this is 
the first place I'd come to," said Norman, whose golf earnings in 1990 were 
well exceeded by his endorsement contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Then he smiled. "Well, OK. I could afford to live here," he said.

TROJANS' SECONDARY READY FOR THE WORST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
USC's young, inexperienced secondary has been burned with uncommon regularity 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterbacks Tony Sacca of Penn State, Mark Brunell of Washington and Greg Frey 
of Ohio State enjoyed their most productive passing games of the season against 
the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Palumbis of Stanford passed for 360 yards and three touchdowns against 
USC, including 230 yards in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Even Arizona, the worst passing team in the Pacific 10 Conference, completed a 
48-yard pass play against USC, its longest of the season and one of only four 
scoring passes by the Wildcats in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
So, it is with great trepidation that USC fans look to Saturday's matchup 
between the Trojans' secondary and UCLA quarterback Tommy Maddox, who leads the 
Pac-10 in total offense and ranks third in the conference in passing 
efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
"Maddox is as good as anybody we've played -- maybe better," said Bobby April, 
who coaches USC's defensive backs. "He's tremendous. He's on the verge of being 
one of the great players in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, April says he doesn't believe that USC's defensive backfield will 
be overmatched. 
</P>
<P>
"It's improving each week," he said, adding that, despite a propensity for 
giving up a lot of yardage, the Trojans rank third in the Pac-10 in passing 
efficiency defense. "Certainly, a lot of times we've given up big plays -- more 
big plays than I'm accustomed to giving up. But every week, we've gotten a 
little better." 
</P>
<P>
USC has put together a makeshift unit in the backfield. Fourteen months ago, 
none of the Trojans' defensive backs were projected as starters this season. 
</P>
<P>
But then: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cornerback Marvin Pollard blew out a knee. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Safety Mark Carrier, winner of the Thorpe Award as the nation's top 
defensive back last season, made himself available for the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Safety Lamont Hollinquest fell behind in class and was suspended by Coach 
Larry Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cornerback DeChon Burns was forced to quit because of a spinal defect. 
</P>
<P>
And it didn't help that the Trojans' top pass rusher, linebacker Junior Seau, 
also made himself available for the draft. 
</P>
<P>
April was left with a group that includes two converted tailbacks and a 
converted split end. Two of USC's six most frequently used defensive backs are 
redshirt freshmen. Another is a true freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Before last March, cornerbacks Mike Salmon and Calvin Holmes were offensive 
players. "They'd never even backpedaled before," April said. Salmon has started 
in all but three games, Holmes in all but one. 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Jason Oliver was still in high school last spring. He has started 
twice and is expected to start again this week. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans' on-the-job training has not always gone smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
Still, April said: "I'm not unhappy with the way they're playing. They've made 
tremendous strides. People have gone after them -- they've thrown on us a lot 
-- and they've improved." 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Stephon Pace has been the leader of the group, shuffling between 
cornerback and safety and making 58 tackles to rank third on the Trojans. He 
has two interceptions, and his 14 pass deflections are a team high. 
</P>
<P>
His teammates in the secondary have not been as consistent. 
</P>
<P>
Senior safety Marcus Hopkins has been a disappointment, mostly because the 
Trojans, perhaps unrealistically, expected him to have a big season. "I thought 
he would be more of an impact guy," April said. "Although he has done a lot of 
good things, he hasn't made a lot happen. He hasn't made highlight film-type 
plays." 
</P>
<P>
Holmes, a converted tailback, has been a quick study, April said, but still 
needs seasoning. 
</P>
<P>
As pass coverage halfback, he is probably the most visible and vulnerable 
player in the backfield. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the one who really has his (butt) hanging on the line," April said. "He 
has improved as much as any player I've ever had because he's only been a 
defensive back for about eight months." 
</P>
<P>
Salmon also has shown flashes of excellence. A converted split end, he leads 
the Trojans with four interceptions. Oliver, though, has pushed him for playing 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Against Oregon State last week, Oliver intercepted a pass and returned it 66 
yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
April sees room for improvement, obviously, but he does not seem discouraged. 
When he said, "We have to play better than we have all year in the secondary to 
beat UCLA," he said it as if he believed it would happen.

LSU COACH ARCHER TO CALL IT QUITS

<P>
Louisiana State Coach Mike Archer, in a teary farewell, said Thursday he will 
resign at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers (4-5) play at Mississippi State on Saturday before meeting Tulane on 
Nov. 24 in their traditional season finale. 
</P>
<P>
"What I did is in the best interest of the football team," Archer, 37, said 
during a news conference. "It's in my best interest. I need to get on with my 
life. They need to get on with theirs." 
</P>
<P>
The youngest Division I-A football coach when he was hired four years ago, 
Archer has a 26-17-1 record in his first head coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
Fired football coach Dick Crum will be on the sidelines Saturday for Kent's 
final game of the season against Eastern Michigan, but the university hopes to 
name a replacement soon after, a school spokesperson said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Crum has a 6-26 record in three seasons at Kent. The Golden Flashes are 1-9 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Crum began his head coaching career at Miami of Ohio, where he compiled a 
34-10-1 record from 1974-77. He was the winningest football coach in North 
Carolina history, compiling a 72-41 record from 1978-87. 
</P>
<P>
Six Texas A&amp;M football players and a former player have been charged with 
illegally using telephone charge cards. But Coach R.C. Slocum said the 
allegations won't keep the players out of Saturday's game against Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
Slocum told the Bryan-College Station Eagle and the Texas A&amp;M student 
newspaper, the Battalion, that he will not take any disciplinary action against 
the athletes unless they are found guilty. Those charged are Derek Ware, 23; 
Jason Medlock, 19; Felton Ransby, 22; Derrick Frazier, 20; Marlin Haynes, 20; 
Kary Vincent, 20; and Derick Richey, 22, who played last year.

PANEL CITES TRAFFIC EFFECTS IN FARMLAND REZONING DENIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERRY BRAILO SPENCER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the aftermath of the defeat of a county tax increase for road improvements, 
the Ventura County Planning Commission denied a proposal Thursday that would 
have set the stage for a new development in the Santa Rosa Valley east of 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
Measure A, the proposed half-cent sales tax that was defeated Nov. 6 by a 2-1 
margin, would have given funds to the county to improve Santa Rosa Road, a main 
east-west artery that connects Simi Valley and Moorpark to the Camarillo area. 
</P>
<P>
The county's General Plan prohibits development where roads are inadequate to 
handle an influx of new residents. 
</P>
<P>
Nine agricultural land owners in the Santa Rosa Valley who have attempted for 
years to have their property zoned from open space to one-acre parcels were 
denied their request for a General Plan amendment, which would have changed 12 
parcels to 278 additional parcels, adding about 900 people to the area if fully 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
In a 3-2 vote, with commissioners Laura Newman and Mary Alice Henderson 
dissenting, commissioners said that while they understood the plight of the 
owners, they could not approve their request to change the county's General 
Plan without first addressing traffic, sewer and educational effects. 
</P>
<P>
The rezoning proposal will still be submitted to the Board of Supervisors on 
Dec. 4, said Stanley Cohen, attorney for the Caston Trust, which represents all 
the property owners who own a total of more than 330 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Property owners told stories of keeping their land in agricultural use in the 
past, only to find that neighbors had received approval from the Board of 
Supervisors to develop adjacent property in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Carolynn B. Nicholson, who owns 57 acres, said her property is surrounded by 
one-acre zoning. "We've been bounced around by the county. . . . We entered 
into a land-use contract so that agriculture would be preserved, but that was 
not the direction that the Board of Supervisors took." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson said the helicopter company that sprays her crops told her that it 
will no longer be able to spray because of the proximity of housing. "I cannot 
stay in agriculture," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, who attempted to change the land-use amendment from one acre to five 
acres and leave four of the parcels in a greenbelt to be approved by the county 
and Camarillo, said she could not accept the planning staff's recommendation to 
deny the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a true horror story. . . . I think we can try to appease both," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But commissioners also heard pleas from Camarillo officials that the land-use 
change could only bring more problems. 
</P>
<P>
J. William Little, Camarillo's city manager, said approval of the Caston Trust 
proposal, along with other developments in various planning stages, would add 
about 6,200 people to the area. 
</P>
<P>
"That's like building a city equivalent to the size of Ojai," he said.

GUARDSMEN DEPART FOR 'AIR BRIDGE' IN GERMANY; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: THE CHANNEL ISLANDS UNIT WILL TRANSPORT SUPPLIES, EQUIPMENT AND 
PERSONNEL ACROSS EUROPE AND POSSIBLY TO THE MIDDLE EAST, AN OFFICIAL SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three cargo planes carrying 71 volunteer flight-crew members and aircraft 
mechanics departed for Germany from the Channel Islands Air National Guard Base 
on Thursday to become part of an "air bridge" to U.S. troops in the Persian 
Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The three C-130 Hercules cargo planes will meet a fourth plane from the Oxnard 
base at the Rhein-Main Air Base near Frankfurt. For now, the four cargo planes 
and 93 crew members will be based in Germany, transporting supplies, equipment 
and personnel across Europe and possibly to the Middle East, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the Channel Islands guard unit has dispatched about 50 cargo 
handlers and medical technicians to Saudi Arabia. But this week marked the 
first time that the National Guard base has sent some flight-crew and cargo 
planes overseas to help with the buildup of troops and weaponry in Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
So far, reservists bound for overseas have been volunteers. But officials said 
they probably will be asked to activate at least some of the 1,400 reservists 
to help meet the call-up of an additional 72,500 National Guard and reserve 
troops authorized this week by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, Navy Cmdr. Charles Kubic said the 600-man Naval Mobile 
Construction Battalion 3, the only Seabee battalion remaining at Port Hueneme, 
probably will join the base's three other Seabee battalions in Saudi Arabia in 
March. Battalion 3 has been stationed at Port Hueneme since August, after seven 
months in Rota, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have specific orders yet, but it doesn't take a genius to figure out 
where we are going," said Kubic, the battalion's commander. "We're training for 
Saudi Arabia." 
</P>
<P>
Under the Seabees' normal seven-month rotation schedule, the March deployment 
of Battalion 3 would allow the 600 Seabees in Battalion 40 to return to Port 
Hueneme. "With world events as they are, who can predict what will happen?" 
Kubic asked. 
</P>
<P>
At the Air National Guard base Thursday, the volunteer flight crews and 
mechanics arrived before dawn to prepare for the initial nine-hour leg of their 
flight to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The volunteers were issued new identification cards and made sure that their 
military paychecks would be electronically deposited into checking accounts. 
</P>
<P>
For some of the citizen-soldiers, it was an emotional parting from family 
members worried about war erupting in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"I just thought he was going to Germany, but he's not," said Leslie Zuniga, 
wife of Sgt. Jerry Zuniga, an airplane mechanic. "He is going to fly back and 
forth to Saudi Arabia. He won't be fighting; he'll be carrying supplies. You 
wonder if they'll want to knock out the supply planes." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Zuniga tried to comfort his wife as he worked his way through the 
processing line with his son, Andrew, 7, seated on his shoulders. "She's not 
used to this," Zuniga said. "This is the first time I've deployed since I've 
been married." 
</P>
<P>
Zuniga predicted that he would be home before Christmas. "Of course, if someone 
pulls a trigger, we'll be over there a year." 
</P>
<P>
Clutching a double-handful of junk food for the long flight, Sgt. Angela 
Bateman said she had not realized the personal risk of flying into a potential 
war zone. 
</P>
<P>
"Logically, I know this could be something serious, but emotionally it hasn't 
sunk in yet," said Bateman, a Camarillo resident. "We all have a lot of mixed 
emotions." 
</P>
<P>
Before departure, many of the 146th Tactical Airlift Wing members joked around 
on the Tarmac. There was a mixture of excitement about the adventure and a 
gallows humor about making it home alive. "It is something that you can't help 
but think about," Sgt. Robert Bonino of Ventura said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not as excited as some of the younger guys," said Tech. Sgt. Ray C. 
Perkins of Simi Valley. "I've been to Vietnam, so I know what war is all about. 
I've been to hot spots before." 
</P>
<P>
Before departure, each reservist went through last-minute briefing on how to 
handle live bombs, missiles or other ordnance, including chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"If it is a real low charge, it is probably a chemical agent," warned Capt. 
Rick Gibson, the mission's operations officer who led the briefing. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson instructed all the reservists to make sure that they replace the 
training filters in their gas masks with new filters to be issued before they 
enter Saudi Arabia. "I don't have to stress how important this is before going 
'in country,' " Gibson said.

WORKER WITH AIDS VIRUS FIGHTS FIRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KASH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A civilian sheet-metal worker says he was unfairly fired from the Pacific 
Missile Test Center because he has the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
But test center officials said in a hearing last week that Robert Cruz, 34, was 
fired July 30 because "he had threatened bodily harm against three of his 
supervisors," spokesman Gene Okamoto said. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz tested positive for the HIV virus at a civilian clinic in 1987. In 1988, 
personnel at the base clinic discovered the diagnosis when Cruz went there for 
an unrelated reason, said Donald Manning, Cruz's labor-relations advocate. When 
Cruz reported that he was taking a drug given to HIV-positive patients, the 
doctor knew Cruz had the virus, Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
Because Cruz handled sharp pieces of metal as part of his job, the doctor -- 
with Cruz's consent -- contacted Cruz's immediate supervisor, Robert Briggs. He 
suggested that Cruz be transferred to a safer position, Manning said, where he 
would be less likely to cut himself and possibly spread the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz's right to confidentiality was breached when two other supervisors also 
were notified of his condition, Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctor, having no guidelines, thought he was protecting a whole group of 
workers," Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor, now stationed in Japan, was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Okamoto said Navy guidelines say that when a person tests positive, the 
commanding officer of the squadron or base is notified. 
</P>
<P>
However, Diane Zanders, Point Mugu clinic public affairs officer, said all AIDS 
cases are kept confidential. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic does not test civilians for AIDS, she said, but military personnel 
testing HIV-positive are not reported to their supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Under state privacy laws, no one may be notified of anything in a patient's 
medical records without the patient's consent. 
</P>
<P>
On June 11, Cruz said his supervisors were discriminating against him and had 
excluded him from a pay bonus, Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is when they contend he made threats to his supervisor." 
</P>
<P>
Cruz said in Thursday's hearing that he was upset but that he did not recall 
making threats. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz was sent to see base physician's assistant Thomas Rollins, who recommended 
that he see his family physician. Cruz was placed on leave, and while he was 
gone he was fired, Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
Okamoto said Cruz was called in to the base on July 30 and fired "because of 
the serious nature of the threat against his supervisor." 
</P>
<P>
The base gives employees 30 days notice, so Cruz was paid through Aug. 30, 
Okamoto said. 
</P>
<P>
Cruz, a Navy veteran, worked at the test center for five years before his 
dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
A decision in the case is expected in December. KIM KASH

ACT RESPONSIBLY TO CONSERVE FUEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Around town, my 2.8 V-6 auto burns fuel at 28-30 miles per gallon; at 55 
m.p.h., it burns fuel at 35-38 m.p.g. and at 65 m.p.h., it burns fuel at 32-34 
m.p.g. At 55 m.p.h., it burns almost 10% less than at 65 m.p.h. I try to obey 
the law and conserve fuel. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission reports that 72 million 
gallons of fuel are burned each day on the freeway system (the Valdez spill was 
88 million gallons). 
</P>
<P>
If one out of three would ride-share, we would save 24 million gallons of 
gasoline a day, reduce traffic congestion by one-third and improve our air 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
Our free system of democracy requires responsibility, first to obey the law and 
second to act responsibly by making some personal sacrifices and suffering some 
inconveniences. This will conserve fuel, reduce congestion and clean our air 
for a better and healthier life for all. 
</P>
<P>
Don't wait for George to do it. Start now with you and join me in doing it.

LET GOVERNMENT KNOW YOU'RE WATCHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is being written on Nov. 5, the day before the election. By the time this 
is printed, we will know the names of our new elected officials, from water 
boards to governor. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the results, the promises made by the winners and the charges 
made in the heat of battle, the needs of Ventura County are still present. 
Gridlock, water shortages, improved educational opportunities for our children 
and making government live within a budget are just some of the issues that 
need to be addressed quickly. 
</P>
<P>
While not all of the candidates I supported won, I realize that it is the 
winners who will legislate. The time for hard feelings and recriminations is 
over. I also hope that the winners understand they must represent all the 
citizens, not just those they think supported them. 
</P>
<P>
An officeholder has the responsibility of working on behalf of all citizens, 
not just special-interest groups. The problems of Ventura County, and all of 
California, are too large to leave out the needs and knowledge those who didn't 
support the winners. 
</P>
<P>
As citizens, I urge all of us to get involved. Go to public hearings, City 
Council and Board of Education meetings. Meet your Assembly and state Senate 
members, visit your congressman. Also, go to public forums and write letters to 
the editor. If we want to clean up politics and government, if we want the 
politicians to live up to their promises, they need to know we are watching.

MAN ACCUSED OF KIDNAPING, RAPE

<P>
A 31-year-old Ventura County man was arrested on suspicion of kidnaping and 
raping a woman he promised a job as a baby-sitter, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Ray Kaufman was being held in the Ventura County Jail on $20,000 bail, 
a jail spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old woman, who is a transient, told police that she met a man 
Monday when she was at the intersection of Yerba Buena Road and the Pacific 
Coast Highway, Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. John Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
The man, who pulled over to the side of the road, said he needed a baby-sitter 
and asked if she needed work, Fitzgerald said. They arranged for him to pick 
her up the next day, Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
The man drove the woman to his house on Cotharin Road south of Thousand Oaks 
about 6 p.m. Tuesday, Fitzgerald said. The woman said the man then bound her 
hands behind her back and raped her, Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman said the man later put her back in the car, drove her to a shed about 
a quarter of a mile away and left her there, Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman later freed herself and made her way to a restaurant about 7:30 a.m. 
Wednesday. People there called the Sheriff's Department and she then led 
deputies to a house where Kaufman was arrested. CAROL WATSON

YOUTH JOB SERVICE BACK IN BUSINESS

<P>
After being out of work for a year, the Ojai Youth Employment Service is back 
in business with a new set of bosses and an overdue paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
The Ojai City Council agreed Tuesday to release a $3,000 allocation for the 
service that had been returned to city coffers when the nonprofit corporation 
disbanded last October. 
</P>
<P>
Its new chairman, Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Mark Ball, said the agency has 
re-formed with new bylaws, a new director, a new board and a new office at 110 
E. Matilija St. 
</P>
<P>
It provides free job counseling, training and placement to Ojai Valley youths 
ages 13 to 21, at no charge to participating employers. 
</P>
<P>
The program operated for 20 years until its former director and nine-member 
board resigned last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We never got the funding we were led to believe we would get from United Way," 
said former Director Tim Sidoti. Despite increased private donations, Sidoti 
said the old board realized that it could not meet the United Way's expanded 
program goals with half the $18,000 grant it had expected. 
</P>
<P>
Ball said the new 14-member board will receive about $8,000 United Way held in 
reserve. "Our intention is to build up the service and do more fund raising," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
LouAnn Schlichter of Ojai is the new executive director. THIA BELL

Four of five positions are open on the Thousand Oaks Planning Commission.

<P>
The city clerk's office will accept applications for the positions until Nov. 
30. Accepted applicants, who must be residents of the city and registered 
voters, will be nominated by a council member and approved by the full council, 
said City Clerk Nancy Dillon. 
</P>
<P>
The five-person commission meets every Monday night, discussing the city 
General Plan, which addresses land use and housing issues.

2 NEIGHBORS BLAME AILMENTS ON PLANT'S NOISE; 
</P>
<P>
OXNARD: CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES SAY THE CITY IS PARTIALLY LIABLE FOR ALLOWING THE 
FACILITY TO OPERATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The high-pitched whining produced by the electric plant on Diaz Avenue in 
Oxnard has gradually decreased in the past two months, but Bruce Shepard said 
the ringing in his ears has not. 
</P>
<P>
"It rings in my head all the time, wherever I go," said Shepard, who owns a 
salvage yard next to the Sith Industries facility, which began operating on a 
trial basis in April. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Shepard complained to company officials and the City Council about 
headaches and nausea that he believes were caused by high-frequency sound waves 
emitted from the plant. 
</P>
<P>
But now, it is the ringing in his head that worries him. "When I try to watch 
television I hear ringing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Shepard and Emma Ibarra, who lives next to the plant, filed 
claims against the city, contending that it is partially liable for allowing 
the plant to operate. 
</P>
<P>
The claims do not specify how much money Shepard and Ibarra demand in 
compensation, and Shepard declined to make an estimate. But both say the plant 
noise has impaired their hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the claims and complaints from other residents, city officials said the 
facility has satisfied all the requirements to obtain a permit to begin full, 
on-line operations. 
</P>
<P>
The permit may be issued within the next two weeks, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
City Planner Matthew Winegar said the city is aware of the complaints from 
neighbors and hopes that plant officials can address the concerns before the 
permit is issued. 
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that it is possible that the facility will not be able to 
resolve all the complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, they have complied with all the noise-level requirements," 
Winegar said, adding that such permits are approved administratively by the 
community development director. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Hermanson, the facility manager, rejected Shepard's allegations, saying 
none of his employees have complained of headaches, nausea or hearing problems 
due to plant noise. 
</P>
<P>
He said, however, it is common for a cogeneration plant to emit some noise 
during the initial start-up phase. Hermanson said the company has already made 
several modifications to lower the sound level from 85 decibels to below 62 
decibels. 
</P>
<P>
(Sixty decibels is roughly equivalent to the sound of a noisy office. Seventy 
is equivalent to the sound of normal traffic.) 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Dorothy Maron visited the facility soon after the plant began 
operating, but she said she is not convinced that she experienced the ailments 
Shepard and Ibarra claim to suffer. 
</P>
<P>
"The feeling that I had was not a normal or usual feeling," she said. "But I'm 
not sure if it was purely psychological or real." 
</P>
<P>
Maron said she plans to visit the site again today. 
</P>
<P>
Winegar said the city surveyed nine adjacent property owners and found that two 
are unsatisfied with the noise level near the plant. 
</P>
<P>
The facility is in a mostly industrial neighborhood and generates electricity 
and steam by burning natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Gary Gillig declined to comment on the claims, but said his office 
has issued an opinion, saying the city has no legal reason to withhold the 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, they have complied with a whole series of requirements by the 
city," Gillig said. 
</P>
<P>
For Kevin McCulloch and his sister Kelly Mendoza, the plant has been a source 
of headaches almost since it began operations. "It is reduced but it's just an 
obnoxious noise," said Mendoza, who works at her brother's towing business on 
East 5th Street near the plant. 
</P>
<P>
McCulloch said he has complained about the plant several times to city 
officials. Thursday, he said city planning officials told him that the facility 
will probably receive a permit. McCulloch said he made his feelings known. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just an annoyance," he said, referring to the plant noise. 
</P>
<P>
In her claim, Ibarra said "the problem has not been the volume of the sound 
waves, but the frequency and the pressure." In an interview, Ibarra said she 
has experienced headaches, nausea and a ringing in her ears. 
</P>
<P>
In his claim, Shepard said the two security dogs he keeps at his business also 
have developed hearing problems.

OCTOBER HOME PRICES FALL 3%, SALES RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California home prices dropped 3% in October to an average of $202,913 
-- from $208,215 in September -- according to a report released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But October's prices were virtually unchanged from the same period last year, 
said TRW Real Estate Information Services, which prepared the report. 
</P>
<P>
Largely because of the softening prices, home sales in the five-county region 
-- Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties -- 
jumped 10% in October from September. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest decline came in Orange County, where average sales prices last 
month dropped 9.1% to $236,421 from $260,180 in October, 1989. Most of that 
decline came from the 11% plunge in the average resale price in the county -- 
$229,221 in October, from $258,389 a year earlier and the lowest level since 
December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The combined average sales price of new and resale homes in Los Angeles County 
dropped 0.8% over the 12-month period. San Bernardino, Riverside and San Diego 
counties showed slight to moderate price appreciation during the period, 
ranging from 0.6% in San Diego County to 7.1% in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
Although sales for the region remained well below year-earlier levels, real 
estate experts said the one-month sales hike, coupled with softer prices, may 
signal at least a small resurgence of the region's residential market. 
</P>
<P>
New-home prices throughout the Southland have been falling for several months 
as builders, desperate to reduce their building inventories, have been offering 
inducements ranging from free back yard landscaping and cash rebates to new 
luxury cars. 
</P>
<P>
And now realtors are starting to report significant rollbacks of resale prices 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen listed prices come down $50,000 even $60,000 in the past month or 
so," said Martha Jansen, owner of Century 21 offices in Fullerton and Yorba 
Linda. 
</P>
<P>
With the situation in the Mideast still unsettled and a growing number of 
economists warning of a recession, some industry analysts had expected October 
sales to be as bad or worse than September, said Ed Setzer, vice president of 
the TRW real estate unit. "Frankly, we're a bit surprised at the resiliency and 
vitality of the Southern California housing market." 
</P>
<P>
But one industry specialist cautioned that one month's figures don't 
necessarily mean that the region's housing market is on the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of buyers out there, but a lot of them are still waiting to 
see if we've hit bottom," said Milton E. Naylor, the Irvine-based executive 
vice president of Grubb &amp; Ellis Residential Brokerage Services' Pacific 
Southwest Region. 
</P>
<P>
Clive Hoffman, director of the Mortgage Institute of California, said he does 
not see any signs of a significant recovery in home sales. 
</P>
<P>
Still, declining prices -- especially in costly Orange County -- are a welcome 
occurence because they will break down the buyer resistence that has helped 
stall the real estate market, Naylor said. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 21,208 new and resale homes and condominiums changed hands during 
October in the five-county area tracked by TRW. That compares to 19,331 sales 
recorded in September, but was still 21% below the 26,671 sales that closed in 
October, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Sales dropped from October to October in all five counties, with Orange County 
posting the best comparison, as tumbling prices pulled some shoppers back into 
the market. In all, 3,582 homes and condominiums were sold in the county last 
month, down only 0.3% from 3,593 sales a year earlier.

Pasadena-based engineering and construction firm, plans to boost staff at its 
regional headquarters in Houston by 500 people during the next three years. The 
new hires, primarily engineers and designers, will be needed because of a sharp

<P>
Business inventories grew 0.5% in September, the government said Thursday, 
leading some analysts to express concern the buildup could lead to further 
production cuts and loss of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Economist Evelina Tainer of the First National Bank of Chicago noted that 
industrial production in October already dropped 0.8%, its sharpest cutback in 
nine months. 
</P>
<P>
"It's consistent with the idea that the economy is sliding into a recession and 
growth will be negative in the fourth quarter," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the inventory level itself had not reached a dangerous level 
although continued vigilance was needed to prevent an even deeper reduction in 
output. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and back lots in 
September totaled a seasonally adjusted $811.5 billion, up from $807.5 billion 
the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
But the accumulation slowed from a 0.7% gain in both July and August, the 
largest increases since an 0.8% advance in July, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Business sales dipped 0.5% to a seasonally adjusted $548.7 billion, down from 
$551.5 billion a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first decline in sales since a 0.4% drop in July and the largest 
since a 1.0% decrease last April. August sales had jumped 2.1%.

HIGH-DEFINITION TV RACE WON BY MATSUSHITA

Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., the world's largest consumer electronics 
firm, announced Thursday that it won the race to market the world's first 
high-definition television. 
</P>
<P>
The Osaka-based company, which sells TVs under the Panasonic name, said its 
36-inch HDTV would cost 4.5 million yen ($34,900) and go on sale in Japan next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
"Realistically, we can't expect to sell very many. You could buy a luxury car 
for the same money," a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Matsushita aims for monthly sales of only 50 sets. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement was more of a public relations than a technical coup for 
Matsushita. Archrival Sony Corp., Hitachi Ltd., NEC Corp. and other Japanese 
firms have all developed HDTV equipment and are selling it to professionals. 
</P>
<P>
The companies have recently unveiled a variety of HDTV consumer products and 
prototypes, including screens, videocassette recorders and adapters for 
conventional sets. 
</P>
<P>
But no company has sold a stand-alone set combining an HDTV tuner and screen, 
the Matsushita spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
HDTV, which delivers sharper and wider images than conventional TV, is expected 
to be one of the most lucrative high-technology products of the next two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
To help raise awareness and stoke demand, the public Japan Broadcasting Corp. 
began daily one-hour HDTV broadcasts.

Rockwell, Messerschmitt Form Team: Rockwell International and the German

bid on the joint primary aircraft training system, an Air Force and Navy 
aircraft training program. 
</P>
<P>
The team will produce two demonstrator aircraft for the program competition by 
1992. Rockwell's North American Aircraft unit will act as prime contractor and 
assemble the aircraft, based on an MBB design. The Air Force said it will buy 
about 500 aircraft starting in 1997 and the Navy wants 300 aircraft.

MGM-Pathe Slashes Work Force: About 300 employees, representing nearly a third 
of the work force, at newly formed MGM-Pathe Communications have been fired by 
the company's new ownership in the past week, a spokesman has confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
"The layoffs are very unfortunate, but they were made in order to avoid 
duplication of administrative functions," said spokesman Craig Parsons. Pink 
slips were issued two weeks after Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti 
completed his $1.36-billion buyout of the legendary MGM-UA studio. The deal was 
financed partly by selling off home video and TV rights to its film library. 
Parsons said no more layoffs are planned. "This should be all the reductions 
for now," he said.

Trump Deadline Passes: Donald Trump's Thursday midnight deadline to make a 
$47.3-million interest payment passed with no word on whether he was able to 
work out a deal with bondholders who invested in his Taj Mahal casino. 
</P>
<P>
Bondholders' representatives have threatened a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing for 
Atlantic City's biggest casino as early as today. At press time, there were no 
signs whether the developer and the holders of $675 million in junk bonds were 
near an agreement to restructure the debt. The Trump Organization was saying 
very little. Telephones at Trump's New York headquarters went unanswered late 
Thursday.

FADS CHANGE, BUT THE BEAT GOES ON

<TEXT>
<P>
England has long been known as the Land of the Musical Fads, and in the late 
1970s, on the heels of punk-rock, came the "two-tone" ska revival. 
</P>
<P>
The music, essentially a modernized version of ska, the upbeat Jamaican 
precursor to reggae, was characterized by catchy melodies, perky rhythms and 
politically incisive lyrics. The movement was spearheaded by a pair of 
interracial bands from a pair of bleak, industrial cities: the Specials, from 
Coventry, and the English Beat, from nearby Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
By 1981, the fad had fizzled. And now, nearly a decade later, certain members 
of both groups -- including ex-Specials drummer John Bradbury and former 
English Beat singer Ranking Roger -- have joined forces as the Special Beat. 
</P>
<P>
They're gearing up for a second run, starting with a two-month U.S. tour that 
began Nov. 2 in Jacksonville, Fla., and includes a stop tonight at the 
Starlight Bowl in Balboa Park, where they'll open for Gene Loves Jezebel. 
</P>
<P>
The catalyst was Ranking Roger's solo performance last April at an 
international ska festival in San Francisco, Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
"He came back (to England) all excited, telling me there was still plenty of 
interest in ska, particularly on the West Coast," Bradbury said. "So I thought, 
well, let's phone around and see if any of the guys would be interested in 
putting together an outfit, and, as soon as Roger and I got on the phone, we 
found plenty of people saying yes, yes, yes to everything." 
</P>
<P>
They recruited former Specials singer Neville Staples and bassist Horace 
Panter, who had also played in Roger's post-English Beat group, General Public. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the new group's lineup are guitarist Bobby Bird, keyboard player 
Sean Flowerdew and singer Finny, the latter two from the Loafers, a new English 
ska band Bradbury had been producing. 
</P>
<P>
"When you consider when we did it 10 years ago, a complete generation never had 
the opportunity to see us back then, so we have the potential for a whole new 
audience," Bradbury said. "In addition, we don't consider this type of music to 
be old hat. It's not as if the Specials or the English Beat particularly took 
America by storm." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. The late 1970s "two-tone" ska revival was exclusively a British 
phenomenon, having originated when white street punks began mingling and 
swapping musical influences with black immigrants from the West Indies. The 
result was an infectious hybrid of authentic ska, reggae, rock 'n' roll and 
rhythm-and-blues, with lyrics that lambasted racial intolerance and political 
oppression. 
</P>
<P>
"In Coventry and Birmingham, there are a lot of black immigrants, very much 
like Detroit," Bradbury said. "There was a like-mindedness of individuals for 
West Indian music, and the sound developed along those lines, through various 
influences made upon it through the bands. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing all of us sort of purported to do was demonstrate the 
multiracial nature of our music, as well as our bands, by performing on stage 
in black and white, and having black and white logos, that sort of thing. And 
that's how it came about that the media symbolized us as 'two-tone.' " 
</P>
<P>
The ska fad didn't last long; it was a big sensation in England for about two 
years. Both the Specials and the English Beat scored numerous Top 10 hits on 
the English pop charts, and their live appearances routinely sold out. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, however, it was a different story. Despite some powerful 
allies -- Elvis Costello produced the Specials' debut U.S. album; the 
Pretenders and the Talking Heads took the English Beat on the road -- neither 
band achieved more than a cult following. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. pop charts have never been as open as the English charts, and my 
opinion is that they didn't really know where to play us on the airwaves," 
Bradbury said. "We were a white band playing a ska- and reggae-influenced 
sound, so it was difficult for rock stations on one end of the FM to play us, 
and on the other end, black stations couldn't get the idea, either. 
</P>
<P>
"And, in America, if you don't get on radio, you don't make it." 
</P>
<P>
The Specials broke up in 1982 due to "inter-band stress," Bradbury said. The 
English Beat broke up a year later, when Roger and fellow singer Dave Wakeling 
split to form General Public. Bradbury subsequently put together a 15-piece 
soul revue, the J. B. All-Stars, with whom he toured and recorded for two years 
before venturing into producing other acts, including the Loafers. 
</P>
<P>
And, although he's looking forward to ska-ing again, Bradbury said, he concedes 
he has no idea how long the Special Beat will last. 
</P>
<P>
"Our plans for the future? They're up in the air," he said. "I mean, this whole 
project is only about eight weeks old. Once we've tested the water with this 
tour and see how we get along together, the next step forward should be 
recording. 
</P>
<P>
"But in this business, nothing's a certainty until it's been done."

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT / DAVID NELSON / ON RESTAURANTS: TRENDY GRILL ON THE PARK 
TAKES CARE WITH ITS CUISINE;

<P>
It is said that a new broom sweeps clean. At the restaurant space in the Horton 
Park Plaza Hotel, the new broom wielded by The Grill on the Park has quite 
nearly obliterated any evidence of its predecessor, the Fifth Avenue Bistro. 
</P>
<P>
The owners of the landmark building at Fifth Avenue and E Street, built early 
in this century as the city's first skyscraper, expended a considerable sum in 
restoring the period elegance of the two-story banking hall. Their mistake was 
to install an uninspired menu and a so-so kitchen staff, with the result that 
the Bistro survived less than two years. 
</P>
<P>
All new. All beautiful. All gone. The extravagance of the restaurant industry 
sometimes takes your breath away. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1989, Colorado restaurateurs Howard and Barbara Gunther and 
Stephanie and Michael Dietrich leased this Gaslamp Quarter space for a 
companion restaurant to their Aspen eatery, which is called The Inn on the 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
Out went the elaborate, costly draperies that hung the length of the two-story 
windows. The original mosaic tile floor has been replaced by a new floor of 
patterned wood. The bar at the entry was yanked out and replaced by a gleaming 
exhibition kitchen; the new bar is on the mezzanine, which, just as in the days 
of the Bistro, is where you want to sit. 
</P>
<P>
The mezzanine, although redecorated, retains a certain sense of sophistication, 
while the harshly redone ground floor room has all the charm of a school 
cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
The Grill on the Park attempts a rather sleek, ultra-contemporary appearance. 
The success of this is, at best, mixed. But there is a sort of hilarious appeal 
to the waiters' black uniforms, which are brightened by multihued neckties of a 
pattern so wild that they seem salvaged from the psychedelic '60s. 
</P>
<P>
The menu definitely is contemporary, which is to say that it offers currently 
popular categories of foods -- pizzas, pastas, grilled fish, fowl and meats -- 
and emphasizes sharp, definite flavors. It is an agreeable menu, if not 
particularly innovative, and the kitchen generally turns in an excellent 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
Much homage is paid to trendiness. The very first listing seems a sort of 
nouvelle-California-Creole-Southwest cuisine combination, and you can't get 
much trendier than a stew of those mixed styles -- in this case a spicy black 
bean soup filled out with smoked pork and New Orleans-style andouille sausage. 
For that final gesture that adds a little je ne sais quoi of novelty, a 
spoonful of cilantro-spiked sour cream garnishes the soup. 
</P>
<P>
The proprietors, evidently accustomed to satisfying appetites honed on the 
Aspen ski slopes, serve portions considerably larger than the San Diego norm. 
This makes the thought of a starter questionable -- the entrees really are 
enormous -- but one that works well on a shared basis is the fried onion loaf. 
This rectangular block of batter-crisped rings is served, a la Tony Roma's rib 
restaurants, with a pitcher of barbecue sauce, and is equally happy as an 
auxiliary vegetable with the entrees. 
</P>
<P>
Among other choices are tempura-fried zucchini slices with what the menu calls 
"buttermilk herb dipping sauce" (in its ingredients, this sounds suspiciously 
like "ranch" dressing); deviled lamb ribs with jalapeno pepper jelly; a skewer 
of mesquite-grilled steak chunks and shrimp served with a spicy, Thai-style 
peanut sauce, and Southwestern-nouvelle style crab cakes crusted with blue 
cornmeal and dressed with a chili-corn butter sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The display kitchen includes the requisite wood-burning oven, and the pizzas 
that emerge from it are, in fact, quite superior -- the thin, finely textured 
crusts delicious with their seasoning of olive oil and mixed fresh herbs. The 
choice includes a pie topped with barbecued chicken and cilantro, and a 
Mexican-style version with rock shrimp, salsa, sour cream and avocado, but the 
most elegant is the pizza dressed with roasted garlic puree, goat cheese and 
sun-dried tomatoes. This combination may be this era's culinary equivalent of 
the pet rock, but it is undeniably irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
The pasta list is somewhat more restrained (there is, however, angel hair pasta 
with something called "Cajun chicken"), and the likeliest sounding choice might 
be the lasagna stuffed with Maine lobster, cheese, mushrooms and spinach. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen does seem to take great care with the cooking of the entrees. One 
fish special, a filet of Norwegian salmon, was bedded on sauteed spinach, 
crusted with four types of peppercorns and sauced with a pale puree of yellow 
tomatoes and roasted garlic. It showed considerable imagination and had been 
treated with finesse; the beautifully moist fish flaked at the merest nudge of 
the fork. 
</P>
<P>
The herbed, roasted chicken seemed almost to crackle on the plate, its skin a 
dark shade that promised a fine, crisp finish; the flesh, meanwhile, remained 
nicely juicy. A whole bird was served, not an enormous specimen but still 
sufficient for two diners, although it was served for just one; half of it went 
home for later consumption. 
</P>
<P>
The barbecued baby back ribs (listed by the menu as "famous") were good, if 
unexceptional, a comment that also could be made about the grilled, center-cut 
pork chops in a mustard-horseradish sauce. Other entree choices include a 
Yucatan-style chicken breast marinated in spiced fruit juices; a 1-pound veal 
chop and a simple New York sirloin with sauteed mushrooms. All of these are 
accompanied by a hillock of the day's vegetable (on one occasion, quite 
respectable green beans amandine) and a choice of sliced tomatoes, french fries 
or the city's largest stuffed baked potatoes. These spuds are creamy and 
well-seasoned, but utterly daunting in size. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps because of the menu's generally spicy tone, the dessert list takes a 
very basic approach and limits itself to sundaes, a fruit plate and a low-slung 
creme brulee garnished with a side of mixed berries.

'EATING': RICH TALE OF BEING TOO THIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With "Eating" (only at the Park Theater in San Diego) the ever-idiosyncratic 
independent filmmaker Henry Jaglom continues his intimate, spontaneous, witty 
but always compassionate observations of compulsive, neurotic human behavior -- 
and reveals his ongoing fascination with women. He clearly has always inspired 
great trust in actresses, and in this instance his all-female cast rewards him 
with some shining portrayals. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Crosby reveals depths heretofore unsuspected, and from Gwen Welles, one of 
his regulars, he elicits her most harrowing, complex performance yet. But if 
"Eating" had accomplished nothing else, it would have been remarkable for the 
performance of Frances Bergen, one of Hollywood's enduring, elegant beauties, 
in what is surely the best part of her career. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, "Eating" is "The Women" of the '90s. The Norma Shearer role of the 
perfect wife goes to capable Lisa Blake Richards as an attractive Hancock Park 
matron who decides to throw a party to mark her 40th birthday, then expands it 
to celebrate the impending birthdays of two of her best friends: Crosby, a 
happily married housewife who is about to turn 30; and Marlena Giovi, a 
Hollywood agent who is fast approaching 50. By the time the party and the film 
are over, no less than 38 actresses (and no actors) will have appeared on the 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
When one of the women remarks, "Twenty-five years ago the secret subject of 
women was sex . . . today, it's food!," she's hit upon the heart of the matter. 
Except for Bergen, who plays Richards' serene mother, virtually every woman 
present is obsessed with dieting, in at least one instance to the point of 
bulimia. 
</P>
<P>
In this group, thinness has become the absolute measure of desirability and 
self-worth, even for the women who know better intellectually, but remain 
vulnerable emotionally to this rigid standard. Who can deny that the anxiety of 
these by-and-large sophisticated, highly attractive women mirrors our society's 
distorted values, reinforced so intensively by messages in the media? This is 
scarcely news, but what is new is the way Jaglom makes this phenomenon so 
personal; serious, yet occasionally so funny. 
</P>
<P>
Around the issue of food, the usual storylines start unreeling, involving acts 
of infidelity and betrayal as well as gestures of loving support. In order to 
thoroughly -- one might well say exhaustively -- explore women's attitudes 
toward eating and dieting, Jaglom has given Richards a house guest, a French 
documentarian (Nelly Alard) who questions Richards and her guests on those very 
subjects under the guise of making a study of what she calls "Southern 
California behavior." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, this voluptuous beauty herself finally reveals a terrible, wildly 
distorted self-image. However, as the film's various storylines take hold, the 
constant cuts to the documentarian's question-and-answer sessions become 
intrusive, repetitive -- how many things can you say about eating and dieting? 
-- and tend to make the film seem long and drawn out. Yet, on balance, amid so 
many glancing insights and so many radiant presences, this is not a serious 
flaw. Resolutely chic and contemporary, "Eating" (Times-rated Mature for adult 
themes) really isn't, in its grasp of human foibles, so different from "The 
Women" after all.

PREVIEW: FESTIVAL BRINGS THE ARTS TO THE COMMUNITY

Isabella Barone never dreamed that she'd possess more physical and mental 
vitality at 75 than she did at 50. But then she didn't realize when she signed 
up for a tai chi chuan class on a whim that eventually she would master the 
martial art form and become an instructor. 
</P>
<P>
"They say tai chi promotes longevity," said Barone, a resident of Sunland. "I 
guess they're right." 
</P>
<P>
Perfected by Chinese monks more than 1,000 years ago, tai chi is a series of 
108 detailed movements learned in three sets, each progressively more 
difficult, she said. The stylized exercise, practiced daily throughout China, 
is graceful and almost dancelike. Some historians speculate that tai chi is 
related to another martial art, kung fu, but without the self-defense 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about bringing the body, the mind and the spirit together in fluid 
motion. It's about balancing the ying-yang energies," said Barone, who has 
taught several classes a week at the McGroarty Arts Center in Tujunga for the 
past 12 years. "Because of its gentle quality, almost anyone can learn the 
movements." 
</P>
<P>
Barone and some of her students will present a tai chi demonstration Saturday 
and Sunday at the McGroarty Arts Center Festival and Open House. 
</P>
<P>
Also featured is the Majikina Honryu Dance Company, a Whittier-based troupe 
that performs the traditional dances of Okinawa. 
</P>
<P>
"Okinawan culture, language, music and dance is relatively unknown," said 
Heather Matsunaga, 45, who founded the company in 1977 along with Aiko Tengan 
Majikina. "Before Okinawa was taken over by Japan in the late 1800s, it was a 
separate nation. Because of its distinct location as a trading center, the 
culture actually has more Chinese and Korean elements than Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
There are 10 members in the professional company, which is named after the 
Okinawan dance master Majikina. 
</P>
<P>
"After a dancer passes the five stages or certificates, which takes about 15 
years of intense practice, they use his name professionally as a tribute. My 
partner has obtained this honor. I have only passed three certificates," said 
Matsunaga, who began her dance training in junior high school. 
</P>
<P>
"Most non-Okinawans find us unique. The classical styles are slow, while our 
newer dances rely heavily on drums and rhythms," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Other performances at the festival, which runs from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. both 
days, will include the Los Angeles Chinese Music Ensemble, the Rainbow Riders, 
and a puppet and clown act. There will also be arts and crafts booths, 
storytelling, a group mural painting project and refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first year we've had a festival to go along with the open house," 
said Joan de Bruin, who became director of the McGroarty center this month. 
"We'd like to make it an annual event since the center is all about reaching 
out into the community." 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1923, the McGroarty Arts Center is sponsored by the Los Angeles 
Cultural Affairs Department. Originally the home of poet-congressman John 
Steven McGroarty, it was declared a historical monument by the city in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
"Our purpose is to bridge the gap between the community and the arts," said de 
Bruin, an artist who works in acrylic and bronze, and previously administered 
the city's Hollywood center for 11 years. "We're trying to touch as many people 
as possible because art is about people. It's everywhere and every day." 
</P>
<P>
 The McGroarty Arts Center Festival and Annual Open House will be held from 10 
a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at the center, 7570 McGroarty Center 
Terrace, Tujunga. Admission is free. Free parking is available at the center's 
upper lot. A free bus shuttle is also available at the K mart parking lot. Call 
(818) 352-5285. HEATHER W. MORGAN

STAMP ART: Reproductions of the painting on the annual federal duck-hunting 
stamp are said to net $1 million or more for the artist (E1). 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't hold true for the scores of state hunting stamps, according to 
Dave Chapple of Irvine, onetime Rams punter whose paintings are on six state 
stamps. "You have to give them the painting free, and some states make you 
publish the stamps too, and that's around $15,000," Chapple says. "If you've 
got time to . . . promote your pictures, you can do OK. I'd rather just sell 
the original." Lanie Jones and Bob Schwartz

NURSE SAYS BOSS FIRED HER AFTER TOUR OF ACTIVE DUTY; 
</P>
<P>
CALL-UP: A NATIONAL GUARD CAPTAIN SUES FIRM FOR DISMISSING HER ON RETURN FROM 
SERVING IN GULF CRISIS.

<P>
An Army National Guard nurse filed suit against her civilian employer Thursday, 
alleging that she was illegally fired for missing work after being called to 
active duty during the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Debra M. Simpson, 35, of Santa Ana alleges in her Superior Court suit 
that she was fired from her administrative position at a Santa Ana care 
facility for chronically ill or disabled children on Oct. 3, the day she 
returned to work after a month of active duty overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Her employer orally told her that she was being terminated for "abandonment of 
her position," Simpson's suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
National Guard officials in Sacramento said federal law forbids civilian 
employers' firing or demoting people called to active duty by the U.S. 
military. They said Simpson is the first guard member or reservist in the state 
claiming to have lost a job because of call-ups during the gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very concerned that none of our people lose their jobs or be demoted," 
said Maj. Bruce Roy, public affairs officer for the California National Guard. 
"And so we work to educate businesses and companies about how the law protects 
those who are called to active duty. 
</P>
<P>
"This type of thing is something that concerns us very much," Roy added. 
</P>
<P>
According to the lawsuit, Simpson worked as hospital administrator at Kangaroo 
Kids Center for Fragile Children in Santa Ana. She has not found permanent 
employment since being fired, the suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Care Visions Corp., which operates the Kangaroo Kids Center, 
declined to comment on Simpson's suit or its allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Julia Bell, chief executive officer of Care Visions Corp. and a defendant in 
the lawsuit, declined comment during a brief telephone conversation. Efforts to 
get statements from other corporation officials were also unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson is a registered nurse with special training in military medical air 
evacuation. This week she is again on active duty with the Army National Guard 
and could not be contacted. 
</P>
<P>
However, her attorneys, Thomas L. Brown and Michael De Benon, said at their 
Westminster office that Simpson is "devastated" by the loss of her job. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a competent, highly trained woman," Brown said. "She was doing her 
military duty. She informed the corporation, in writing, that she was going to 
be on active duty for a month, and she even told them when she was getting 
back. But when she came back to work that day (Oct. 3), she was coolly treated 
for a few hours and then told she was being fired because she had abandoned her 
position." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson alleges that her employer, by firing her, violated a state law 
prohibiting "wrongful discharge." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the suit could also have been filed in federal court, because there 
is a federal law against wrongfully firing reservists or guard personnel. "We 
filed the complaint in state court because, frankly, she can get a bigger 
settlement under the state law," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The suit sets no specific damages but asks for compensatory and punitive 
damages "in an amount to be determined at the time of trial." 
</P>
<P>
Defendants named in the suit are Care Visions Corp., Kangaroo Kids Center for 
Fragile Children, Bell and Jeffrey Gasser, listed as being the president and 
chief operating officer of Care Visions. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson's military orders show that she was called to active duty for Sept. 2 
through 28. She was sent to a military post in Nuremberg, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said Simpson filled in for another nurse in Nuremberg who was rotated to 
Saudi Arabia. Since August, Saudi Arabia has been the buildup site for 
thousands of U.S. troops sent to defend that key Middle East oil kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson's suit says that she orally informed Bell, her immediate supervisor, 
that she was being called to active duty. 
</P>
<P>
The suit says Simpson also "gave written notice of her required leave of 
absence" from the care home. 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges: "As a proximate result of the wrongful discharge of plaintiff 
(Simpson), plaintiff has become unemployed and has been unable to find 
satisfactory work of a similar kind by which to support herself and has become 
emotionally distressed." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said Simpson is now again on active duty, for a short period in 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a specialist in medical air evacuation, and her military skills are 
really needed," Brown said.

YOUTH, 17, TO BE TRIED FOR FATAL SHOOTING OF CLASSMATE;

<P>
CRIME: A JUDGE REJECTS RICHARD BOURASSA'S VERSION OF CHRISTIAN WIEDEPUHL'S 
DEATH. THE DEFENDANT KILLED ANOTHER YOUNG FRIEND IN 1986.

<P>
A judge Thursday ordered 17-year-old Richard H. Bourassa Jr. to stand trial on 
a murder charge stemming from the shooting death of his friend, the second 
classmate killed by Bourassa in his home since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In her decision, North Orange County Municipal Judge Margaret R. Anderson said 
that Bourassa's explanation of the May 24 shooting of Christian Wiedepuhl, 17, 
was "rather an incredible version" of the events. She called Bourassa's 
statements about being unfamiliar with guns "totally unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's comments came at the end of a four-day preliminary hearing to decide 
if there was enough evidence to try the former Canyon High School student. 
</P>
<P>
In explaining her ruling, Anderson referred to the sometimes dramatic testimony 
of three friends who said that Bourassa frequently handled firearms and had 
pointed guns at them before Wiedepuhl was slain. 
</P>
<P>
"I was appalled beyond belief that he had been playing with a shotgun that he 
had killed another human being with," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 13, 1986, Bourassa fatally wounded Jeffrey A. Bush, 13, while the two 
were allegedly playing with a 12-gauge shotgun and a .22-caliber rifle. The 
shooting, which occurred the same hour of day and in the same room as 
Wiedepuhl's death, was ruled an accident by police. There was no witness, the 
same as with the Wiedepuhl shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Edward W. Hall, Bourassa's attorney, said the youth and his family were 
disappointed by the ruling. As with most preliminary hearings, the defense did 
not present a case. Nonetheless, Bourassa has maintained that the shooting was 
accidental. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a navy blue T-shirt and jeans, Bourassa appeared in court with his 
ankles shackled. After the hearing, he was returned to Orange County Jail, 
where he has been held since a Juvenile Court judge ruled that he should face 
charges as an adult. His bail was set at $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Hall sought to avoid a trial by having Bourassa plead guilty 
to a manslaughter charge, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Kathi Harper. She 
explained that she discussed the plea with her supervisors, basically to spare 
both families the ordeal of a trial, but ultimately decided against it because 
she believes that she has a strong murder case. 
</P>
<P>
Hall declined to comment on the plea arrangement Harper described. Bourassa 
will be arraigned in Orange County Superior Court on Nov. 29. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic preliminary hearing began last Tuesday and was occasionally 
punctuated by the sobs of the latest victim's father, Richard Wiedepuhl, who 
shared the same side of the courtroom as Bourassa's mother and stepfather, 
Nancy and Tom Baldwin. They never spoke. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence ranged from technical analysis of gun residue and ballistics to 
testimony from fellow teen-agers about Bourassa's interest in guns and his 
videotaped interviews with police. In one tape, he re-enacted the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
In that and a second videotaped interview, Bourassa told police that Wiedepuhl 
pulled out a .38-caliber pistol from his parents' bedroom closet and was shot 
after Bourassa took it away from him. 
</P>
<P>
Bourassa has said that he was pointing the gun downward when Wiedepuhl reached 
to pick up a holster from the carpet and that the pistol accidentally 
discharged. He maintained that he knew little about guns. 
</P>
<P>
Harper, however, has alleged that Bourassa took the gun out of his parents' 
headboard and, in a form of Russian roulette, shot Wiedepuhl once above the 
right eye. Rather than one bullet, the pistol's cylinder held four rounds, she 
said, and Bourassa, who is dyslexic, might have mistakenly assumed that the 
hammer would fall on an empty chamber when he pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more important, the evidence suggested major contradictions between the 
testimony of Bourassa's friends and Bourassa's taped statements to police that 
he did not know how to use a gun. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Roberts, a classmate, said in court that Bourassa pulled a BB gun from a 
closet at Roberts' home and pointed it at him. Another friend, Anthony Cordova, 
said Bourassa loaded and unloaded his stepfather's .38-caliber pistol, before 
pointing it at him and saying, "Boom." 
</P>
<P>
Another time, Cordova said, he and Bourassa played with the shotgun and rifle 
that Bourassa and Bush allegedly pointed at each other before Bush was fatally 
wounded with the shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
A schoolmate, Nicholas Bouse, 17, testified that he saw Bourassa playing with a 
gun about six months before Wiedepuhl's death. Bouse said he had climbed onto a 
second-floor window sill of Bourassa's home and peered through the window. 
</P>
<P>
He testified that he saw Bourassa walking toward him with the .38-caliber 
pistol. When Bourassa reached the window, he pointed the gun at the center of 
Bouse's forehead, according to his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Hall did not dispute the witnesses' statements in court but later said Bourassa 
might have been acting in self-defense when he saw Bouse at the window.

DANA PARSONS: 2 GRANDFATHERS -- UNDERSTANDING CAME EARLY AND LATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a cool day in late September of 1978, my grandfather died at 90. He was a 
simple man with a third-grade education who walked 2 miles every day to his job 
as a custodian for the railroad. 
</P>
<P>
We have an old family photo of me as a 3-year-old combing the eight or nine 
strands of hair that grandpa had. As a teen-ager, I had a running joke with him 
based on my grandma's passion for bingo, which she indulged in three or four 
nights a week at the local parlor. Grandpa would phone and invite me over, and 
I'd ask him if grandma was going to be home, knowing full well she was probably 
at bingo. 
</P>
<P>
"No, she's down at Billy Graham's tonight," he would say, always delivering the 
joke with his high-pitched laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Good ol' Grandpa. 
</P>
<P>
That's essentially how he remained in my consciousness until well into adult 
life, when I gave my first serious thought to the rhythms of his life. Born in 
1888, married in 1911, devastated at 41 by the Depression. The father of four 
children. In my mind's eye, I pictured him at various stages of life -- in good 
times, in bad times -- not as a stick figure caricature of a "Grandpa," but as 
a flesh-and-blood man of both vice and virtue. 
</P>
<P>
But by the time I pieced together who Grandpa really was, he was already dead. 
</P>
<P>
This remembrance is sparked by a letter from Justin Yoshida, a junior at 
Fountain Valley High School. Along with the letter, Justin sent a photocopy of 
a front-page photo in The Times from Oct. 10, showing his grandfather with U.S. 
Atty. Gen. Richard Thornburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, written Nov. 1 as an outpouring of Justin's thoughts, explains the 
rest: 
</P>
<P>
"This weekend, I watched my grandfather in a hospital bed being fed green 
liquid through an IV tube. I solemnly stared at his expressionless face for a 
long time. His breath came in long, deep gasps, interrupted intermittently by 
weak coughs. As I stood by this once powerful man, unexpected emotions ran 
through me. I didn't feel deep sorrow. I felt strangely satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"I clasped his age-scarred hand firmly. He wouldn't have felt my grip 
physically, even if he had been awake. My grandfather had suffered two 
debilitating strokes in the past week. The first he had been unaware of, or had 
shaken off. He was hospitalized for the second one, which had paralyzed his 
right side. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved this man deeply. I remember him taking care of his grandchildren 
tenderly, even in his old age. He was always special to me, because he was the 
oldest person I was related to -- 101 years old. If I had such deep feelings 
for him, why did I feel so content while he wasted away at my side? 
</P>
<P>
"Three weeks ago, my grandfather flew to Washington, D.C. My aunt and cousin 
escorted him, for he had trouble walking from place to place and was 
disoriented. Very recently, he had won an award at Los Angeles Nisei week for 
being a pioneer of the Japanese-American community. He had been supportive to 
his friends and family all of his life, but now it was his turn to be aided -- 
in simple walking. 
</P>
<P>
"I pondered for a long time on his benevolence, and it enraged me to think that 
this noble man and all others like him had never been recompensed for being 
betrayed and interned in prison camps by his own country during the second 
world war. The Japanese-Americans, a notoriously proud and honorable ethnic 
group, had never been apologized to, in person, for the great losses and 
atrocities they suffered as the result of unjustified suspicion and racism. It 
was detrimental to their fierce pride and deep honor. 
</P>
<P>
"Now in D.C., my grandfather, Senkichi Yuge, was being televised as the 
attorney general of the United States of America offered a war reparations 
check and an apology on behalf of our country to him, and shook his hand. It 
was the happiest I have ever seen my grandfather, cousin or aunt. As I watched 
each first-generation Japanese-American accept both a check and an apology, I 
felt what all of my people were experiencing -- fulfillment and relief, but 
deep sorrow for all of those who would never receive an apology or reparations 
(more than half of all people interned in prison camps have already died). 
</P>
<P>
"Today at school, I realized why I was satisfied for my grandfather. He had 
waited his whole life to have his dignity restored, and it finally had been. A 
wave of patriotism, unity and pride for my people washed over me as I sat in 
U.S. history class. I went home fulfilled, only to receive very serious news. 
</P>
<P>
"My grandfather died today. It was sudden, unexpected and hopefully painless 
for him. Perhaps I should feel pensive, morose, gloomy, but my new level of 
awareness enables me to have a different insight. I am happy for my 
grandfather. He passed away only after his high hopes had been fulfilled. His 
people's honor was restored. He was content. And he passed away on All Saints 
Day." 
</P>
<P>
Justin and I both had memorable grandfathers. He just got to know his a lot 
sooner than I did.

CHESS WHIZ, 11, TAKES ON AND DEFEATS 30 YOUNGSTERS

An 11-year-old Armenian-born chess prodigy demolished 30 elementary school 
opponents in a simultaneous exhibition match Thursday, setting an unofficial 
world record for such victories, according to his coach. 
</P>
<P>
Andranik Maissian, who is ranked ninth in the nation for his age group, took 2 
1/2 hours to checkmate the last of his 6- to 11-year-old challengers. 
</P>
<P>
"Boy, chess is a hard game," said 8-year-old Brian Rakusin, surveying the 
impending disaster on his board as Andranik began closing the trap around his 
king. 
</P>
<P>
But even for the defeated, there were consolations. 
</P>
<P>
"I made him think two times!" Jonathan Bass, 6, announced proudly. 
</P>
<P>
Andranik, a sixth-grader from West Hills in the San Fernando Valley, placed 
second in the national elementary school chess championships last year. With a 
rating of 1910, Andranik is a Class A player, which puts him in top 15% of 
chess players of all ages in the nation, according to the United States Chess 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
Andranik and four other top players from the Garden Grove Chess for Juniors 
Club have been invited to play in Leningrad in the Soviet Union in July, and 
are trying to raise $12,000 to finance the trip, according to their coach, 
national chess master Robert Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids are really going to give the Russians a run for their money," 
Snyder predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's match was held at the Pegasus School, which has 168 gifted and 
talented pupils, of whom about 25 are taking chess classes. Several other 
children from the chess club also played. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them are beginners, but they've all had some lessons," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
The previous record for simultaneous victory was set by Roy Runas, 13, of Long 
Beach, who defeated 21 players in Santa Ana in 1988, Snyder said. Neither that 
victory nor Andranik's triumph on Thursday are official, however, because the 
Guiness Book of World Records has so far declined to keep track of such feats. 
</P>
<P>
Roy went on to become the National Junior High School Champion, and is also 
going to Leningrad. His 2057 rating puts him in the "expert" category, and he 
is ranked 13th among 13- and 14-year-olds, according to the Chess Federation. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder said the Pegasus School players were on the whole better players than 
those Roy had faced in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't real strong competition, but it's not like these kids were picked 
to be bad," Snyder said. "They've all had some practice. This was definitely a 
tougher field of players than Roy had." 
</P>
<P>
Still, even the best were clearly outmatched by Andranik -- although they had 
30 times longer than he to ponder their next move. Andranik played white and 
opened with the queen's gambit. He appeared to be following his coach's advice 
to stick to safe moves and let his opponents make the mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
The dark, slender boy was mainly poker-faced as he moved from board to board, 
usually taking only seconds to make his moves. He has already developed stage 
presence, swooping across the board to snatch up queens and bishops. Some 
younger players were left staring open-mouthed at their boards. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like he's trying to hype you out . . . 'cause he really moves them 
really fast," said Jennifer Goldberger, 11. "It seems like he's trying to trick 
you -- and that he's thinking really hard." 
</P>
<P>
Andranik was often forced to inform his opponents that their proposed moves 
were illegal. He resisted their appeals for advice. 
</P>
<P>
"If I move there, can you take me?" asked Shana Goldberger, 7. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't answer that," Andranik replied. 
</P>
<P>
She moved her knight anyway, and he promptly captured it. 
</P>
<P>
He did take mercy, however, on one small child, shaking his head ever so 
slightly as she hesitated over a move that would have proved fatal. 
</P>
<P>
After 70 minutes, two first-graders were disqualified for trading pieces, 
hopelessly muddling the board. Shortly after, 6-year-old Jonathan Bass got 
antsy and told Snyder he wanted to stop. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you wish to surrender?" Snyder asked. 
</P>
<P>
"What's that?" Jonathan wondered. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder said about one-third of his students are exceptionally bright, but he 
also has pupils with learning disabilities or behavioral problems, some of whom 
seem to be helped by learning chess. 
</P>
<P>
"Chess teaches logic, abstract thinking, concentration -- and how to plan 
ahead," Snyder said. "Chess can be therapeutic." 
</P>
<P>
Some children were clearly plotting their strategies carefully. "I have a small 
chance of beating him," said Mike Toledano, 11, about 90 minutes into the game. 
"He hasn't made a mistake, but I don't think I have either. Two weeks ago, we 
studied this position." 
</P>
<P>
Mike, who belongs to the chess club, said he hopes his parents will send him to 
chess camp this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"If you practice enough, anybody can get as good as him," Mike said. "Maybe not 
at his age." 
</P>
<P>
Andranik said his father taught him to play chess at 5. His uncle, Houanes 
Gendijian, thought the boy was talented and began taking him to a chess club in 
Armenia. Three years ago, the family emigrated and settled near Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Andranik's father works as a truck driver, and Gendijian drives the boy 
for the three-hour, round-trip trek to monthly chess lessons with Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nothing for me, as long as he's (getting) good," Gendijian said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fun game, exciting and challenging," said Andranik, who also likes 
basketball and soccer. He said he is looking forward to returning to play chess 
in the Soviet Union, and would like to become a professional player. 
</P>
<P>
"On Saturdays and Sundays, I spend more than five or six hours practicing," 
Andranik said. "But on school days, only two hours, because I have a lot of 
homework."

O.C. HEALTH OFFICIAL SAYS FEDERAL DRUG WAR IS 'LOPSIDED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Charging that President Bush has waged a "lopsided" war on drugs, the director 
of Orange County's substance abuse programs warned Thursday that the loss of 
$1.6 million in federal funds next year could devastate an already inadequate 
system to treat the county's drug addicts. 
</P>
<P>
Long waits -- some up to six months -- for those trying to get into a county 
treatment program are "totally unacceptable" and can be expected to worsen if 
funds are reduced, William Edelman told a state Senate committee on a 
fact-finding mission about drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman, a division manager for the County Health Care Agency, said his budget 
will drop to $10.6 million -- and possibly even lower -- next year when a 
two-year federal grant expires. The federal cuts come at a time of steadily 
declining state funds, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Although federal funding for drug treatment programs has climbed since 1985, it 
has increased far less dramatically than the amount of money the government has 
set aside for law enforcement efforts in the drug war. Of the total amount of 
federal money spent to combat illicit drugs, 25% goes to treatment programs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lopsided war," said Edelman, who oversees outpatient clinics and 
long-term care facilities operated with government funds. "All of our programs 
have waiting lists . . . and that's a crime." 
</P>
<P>
Edelman made his remarks during an emotionally charged hearing held at the 
County Hall of Administration by state Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim), chairman 
of the Senate Select Committee on Substance Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Seymour is holding a series of proceedings to review the progress of 
California's five-year plan to fight drugs, which was adopted by the 
Legislature two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County was criticized for its lack of support for treatment programs. 
Witnesses ranged from a tearful Anaheim mother, who told of her family's fear 
and her 8-year-old son's constant exposure to drugs, to an upbeat Sheriff Brad 
Gates, who said the county might be turning the corner on the drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
As evidence, Gates cited a slight decline in drug-related deaths in Orange 
County over the past two years. In 1988, such deaths peaked at 206. Last year, 
194 died. So far this year, there have been 142 fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
"The facts show very clearly that we've hopefully reached the top and are 
starting to go down the back side of the hill just a little bit," Gates said. 
"We have come together as a system. . . . We have approached this issue in a 
very coordinated fashion." 
</P>
<P>
Recommending that California follow Alaska's lead, Gates said he would propose 
legislation to Seymour early next year that would impose prison sentences and 
stiff fines for possession of even small amounts of marijuana. The current 
maximum penalty for possessing less than an ounce of grass in California is a 
$100 fine, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the day's most dramatic testimony, several members of a countywide coalition 
of churches representing an estimated 50,000 families complained that little 
progress has been made in the war on drugs. They said the county's politicians 
have only offered lip service in the fight. 
</P>
<P>
One coalition member, a disillusioned Catholic nun, talked about the fear that 
stalks her Latino neighborhood. Sister Carmen Sarita, a community worker at St. 
Joseph's Catholic Church in downtown Santa Ana, said there is danger in the 
parks, in the laundry rooms and even in the church pews, where drug users 
occasionally steal unattended valuables. 
</P>
<P>
"I know of women who come to church thinking they will be safe. . . . When they 
come back from Communion, their purses are gone and so is the rent money," 
Sarita said. "Because they are poor, because they speak another language does 
not mean they are not traumatized by the terrorism, by the fear that exists in 
their neighborhoods. They bleed like the rest." 
</P>
<P>
The coalition, known as Orange County Congregation-Community Organizations, 
prepared a chart to show what members describe as the county's meager 
commitment to fighting drugs. 
</P>
<P>
According to the chart, Alameda County in the San Francisco Bay Area has just 
over half the population of Orange County but spent five times more of its own 
money on drug treatment programs this year. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, Alameda County has more than doubled it allocation for drug 
treatment to $2.2 million. In contrast, Orange County's spending on drug 
programs has dropped to about $434,000. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, coalition representatives said, not one of the five county 
supervisors accepted an invitation to attend a drug conference of local 
religious, political and community leaders that was organized by the group last 
June. 
</P>
<P>
"It leaves us with serious questions about the commitment of the county," said 
Rick C. Connor, a coalition member who attends First Presbyterian Church of 
Anaheim. "Our families continue to be assaulted by the drug epidemic." 
</P>
<P>
Maria Alaniz, 38, who lives with her three children in Anaheim, told of her 
frustration in dealing with politicians. She frequently stopped her testimony 
to fight back tears. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything I hear is there's no resources, and we keep fighting," Alaniz said. 
"My question is when, Sen. Seymour, are we going to have a safe park?"

County drug treatment programs are funded by the state, Medi-Cal, the federal

county will have $1.6 million less to spend on drug treatment because a federal 
grant expires.

For the first time, Pacific Bell and AT&amp;T are allowing company trucks to 
promote something other than telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Phone company employees will be able to join Mothers Against Drunk Driving's 
annual campaign to keep drunk drivers off the road during the holidays by tying 
red ribbons to vehicle door handles or radio antennas. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a brief ceremony was held in front of the Pacific Bell operations 
building in Tustin. Several employees decked their trucks with red ribbons, and 
the Telephone Pioneers, a volunteer group with members from both phone 
companies, presented more than 100,000 information cards and red ribbons to 
Sandy Gaar, vice president of the Orange County chapter of MADD. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneer volunteers worked for several weeks to cut the ribbons and attach them 
to the information cards. The ribbons are intended to remind anyone entering a 
vehicle not to drink and drive and will be distributed and used between the 
Thanksgiving and New Year's holidays. SHANNON SANDS

SCHOOL WORKERS WIN NEW CONTRACT

<TEXT>
<P>
The Newport-Mesa Unified School District board this week approved a new 
contract for its classified employees for the 1990-91 school year. 
</P>
<P>
The contract covers the district's nearly 800 full- and part-time non-certified 
employees in positions including maintenance and custodial workers, bus drivers 
and administrative support staff. 
</P>
<P>
Salaries will be increased by 5.27%, retroactive to July 1, raising the average 
monthly pay of classified employees from $1,932 to $2,037, according to Carol 
Stocker, the district's chief negotiator. The district is also covering the 
increased cost of health-care benefits and reducing the amount of time required 
to earn vacation time. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the compensation package will cost the district 8.06% more than last 
year and is a result of five months of negotiations between the district and 
the union that represents classified employees during contract talks.

DEVELOPMENT BATTLE MAY SHIFT TO BALLOT

<P>
It's not clear when a special election might happen in Seal Beach, but people 
on both sides of a controversial proposal to develop the old Hellman Ranch are 
already gearing up for it. 
</P>
<P>
First, supporters of Mola Development Corp.'s $200-million plan to build 329 
homes started an initiative drive to have the voters approve it. 
</P>
<P>
The new City Council majority has rejected the plan but will have to approve it 
or call a special election if Mola's supporters -- Seal Beach Citizens for 
Parks, Open Space and Responsible Government -- gather signatures from 2,700 of 
the city's registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
But the measure would probably not be alone on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
On a 3-2 vote, the City Council on Tuesday ordered a 15-member residents' 
committee to draft an alternative plan by Dec. 1 that could serve as a rival 
ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Laszlo, who introduced the idea and drew support from council members 
Gwen Forsythe and Marilyn Bruce Hastings, said he thinks voters should be able 
to choose between two plans. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Edna Wilson and Councilman Joe Hunt dissented, saying that giving voters 
a choice of "yes or no" is sufficient. Wilson and Hunt support the current 
initiative drive. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of Laszlo's proposal called it an attempt to cloud the issue and said 
that a comprehensive plan could not be assembled in such a short time. The Mola 
plan took more than four years to develop and includes input from the Coastal 
Commission, the state Department of Fish and Game and various city boards and 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
A third measure might land on the ballot as well if the Wetlands Restoration 
Society has its way. Don May, secretary for the environmental group, urged the 
City Council on Tuesday to declare the Hellman Ranch property a hazardous zone 
because the council's rejection of the Mola plan was based partly on reports 
that the ground was unstable. 
</P>
<P>
No serious alternative plan can be offered until Mola is out of the way, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
May suggested that the council put the issue before the voters, but the council 
took no action on the idea and it was clear that the suggestion did not have 
enough support to pass. 
</P>
<P>
Former Councilman Victor Grgas, who supports the initiative drive by Seal Beach 
Citizens, said the Wetlands Restoration Society should be required to gather 
signatures if it wants to put a measure on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Roberts, director of finance and operations for Mola, criticized the 
Wetlands Restoration proposal, calling it an attempt to get the city to help 
undermine Mola's plan. Wetlands Restoration and Mola Development Corp. have 
both sued the city.SHANNON SANDS

DRIVE LEADS TO RIDES FOR 12 CHILDREN

<P>
Guadalupe Canela proudly carried her 5-year-old son, Daniel, through the gates 
of Knott's Berry Farm on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Too poor to afford a wheelchair for Daniel, who has cerebral palsy, she never 
dreamed they would ever be enjoying a vacation 2,000 miles away from their 
hometown in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
But with the help of several volunteers, including donations from local 
businesses, he and a group of 11 children and their mothers will be spending 
the next week touring Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe how nice we have been treated," said Canela, a mother of four. 
"It is wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
The children, ranging in age from 5 to 13, attend a private rehabilitation 
center for the poor in Guadalajara. All have cerebral palsy, a condition that 
affects muscle coordination and speech. 
</P>
<P>
The center often has trouble making ends meet and relies heavily on private 
donations and the work of volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing about the children, Patricia Padilla, the manager of a local 
travel agency in Mexico, decided she wanted to do something for them. "All of 
them don't have enough money," Padilla said. 
</P>
<P>
So during the past 10 months, she and other volunteers helped persuade everyone 
from Delta Airlines to the Buena Park Hotel and Convention Center to donate 
something for the trip. They also held fund-raising drives until $1,500 per 
child was collected. 
</P>
<P>
The vacation is the first trip to the United States for all the mothers and 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"The mothers cried when they got on the plane because they have never been able 
to take their children anywhere," Padilla said. 
</P>
<P>
After breakfast, the youngsters eagerly made their way to the park. The mothers 
trailed behind, carrying cameras and knapsacks. 
</P>
<P>
After being greeted by Snoopy, the children raced for Camp Snoopy, stopping to 
inspect each ride. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to get off," protested Lucero Gonzales after a turn on the Red 
Baron airplane. 
</P>
<P>
"There is more," her mother promised. LYNDA NATALI

UCI NURSES TO VOTE ON CONTRACT OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Registered nurses at UCI Medical Center in Orange will vote next week on a 
proposed contract that would give them a 3% raise this month and another 3% in 
May, as well as increased benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The nurses' two-year contract with the state expired last week while talks 
between the university and the nurses' union continued in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the university had offered UCI nurses a 2% raise now and 3% in May. 
</P>
<P>
Nurses at the medical center have said they would need at least a 10% raise to 
earn as much as nurses at other University of California medical centers. About 
950 nurses at UCI are expected to vote Monday and Tuesday on whether to accept 
the contract. 
</P>
<P>
Highlights of the proposed contract for nurses at UCI Medical Center include 
$100 a month extra pay for nurses with advanced certification in specialty 
areas and increased pay for working during the evening and at night, Maureen 
Anderson, a spokeswoman for the California Nurses Assn., said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed contract would bring the basic pay for UCI registered nurses to 
between $31,840 and $60,026, depending on experience and skill, and between 
$39,300 and $66,010 for nurse practitioners. 
</P>
<P>
After weeks of negotiations, tentative contracts were written this week for 
nurses at each of the university's five medical centers and various campus 
clinics, Anderson said. Nurses at all of the university's hospitals and clinics 
work under the same basic contract, with separate pay and benefit provisions 
added for each campus. TOM McQUEENEY

It's hard to be right all the time, but some people just are. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen-year-old Louie Cheng, for example, and his teammates from Sunny Hills 
High School never missed a question during a two-hour decathlon Thursday, tying 
for first place in a Southland contest which started with 600 high school 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
The four-member team from Sunny Hills vied with 11 other teams in the finals 
Thursday of the "Ambassadors to Europe" program, winning a weeklong trip to 
Germany on Dec. 9, where they will participate in a summit with German students 
and tour Heidelberg, Wiesbaden and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
Cheng and his teammates, who spent several sleepless nights preparing for 
Thursday's competition against 60 of Southern California's brightest students, 
didn't rely on training alone. 
</P>
<P>
"We prayed quite a bit before each question," team member Jedidiah Yueh, 16, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Their technique paid off. The team, which included Ken Chen and Janet M. Lee, 
both 16, hesitated only once before answering a question, and finally tied for 
first place with the team from Harvard-Westlake School of North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Although they had said they were confident of winning, Yueh and Lee tapped 
their feet constantly, Lee rocked in her seat and Cheng gripped his chair as 
the questions were asked of other teams. 
</P>
<P>
But the Sunny Hills team never faltered. Preparation, team members said, was 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
They divided the subjects that the contest would cover, making each member 
responsible for becoming an expert in the field. 
</P>
<P>
"Two or three times this week, we stayed up until 2 and 3 in the morning" 
studying, Yueh said. 
</P>
<P>
They also created memory devices such as unusual associations to remember 
facts. For example, to remember the name of the former prime minister of 
Greece, Andreas Papandreou, they focused on the "papa" of his last name. They 
knew that the prime minister's wife was 60 years his junior, and he was more 
than old enough to be her father. 
</P>
<P>
Yueh added that he prepared for the contest by eating light. 
</P>
<P>
"It's better to take tests when you're cold and hungry because that's when 
you're most aware," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It paid off when they were asked questions such as the name of the isthmus that 
connects the Peloponnesus of Greece with the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
After a short consultation, Cheng strode again to the stage and answered, "The 
Corinth." 
</P>
<P>
The contest, held at the Los Angeles Times building in Times Mirror Square, was 
sponsored by The Times and Lufthansa German Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, team members said they were looking forward to seeing Germany so 
soon after the reunification. 
</P>
<P>
"We can tell our grandchildren, 'I was there,' " Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
Their last question in the competition, worth 20 points, was on Germany, and 
later the teammates would call it "anti-climactic" because they knew it cold: 
"In what year did the German Democratic Republic begin to construct the Berlin 
Wall and in what year did it fall?" 
</P>
<P>
After the winners were announced, Ken Chen said, "It's not sunk in. We're very 
surprised." 
</P>
<P>
They said that they hope to compete next year as well, although it depends on 
where the destination is. 
</P>
<P>
"They do it on current events, so they might do Iraq next year, but we don't 
want to go there," Cheng quipped.

O.C. MAN ONE OF 11 INDICTED IN SMUGGLING RING

The federal government has indicted 11 people, including a Buena Park man, for 
allegedly smuggling aliens falsely identified as agricultural workers into the 
United States, New Hampshire's U.S. attorney said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment, returned in U.S. District Court, claims that the defendants 
charged aliens fees ranging from $2,700 to more than $6,000 each to create 
fictitious farm-worker histories for their applications for temporary resident 
status. The scheme allegedly involved nearly 2,000 aliens from at least 60 
countries who now live in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The case illustrates how New Hampshire is inextricably linked to organizations 
alleged to be operating nationwide," U.S. Atty. Jeffrey R. Howard said. "The 
fact that the alien population in New Hampshire is small compared to that of 
other states is one factor which helps to draw conspiracies here." 
</P>
<P>
A trial in the case is scheduled to begin on Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Howard said the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 created the category 
of "special agricultural worker." That allowed aliens who might otherwise be in 
the United States illegally and who performed seasonal agricultural work for at 
least 90 days within a 12-month period to apply for lawful temporary resident 
alien status. 
</P>
<P>
Aliens who applied through the program had to prove to the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service that they met the requirement by submitting forms signed 
by employers. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment charges that the primary farms allegedly used to promote the 
scheme were South Dade Harvesting and Second Dade Harvesting in the Miami, 
Fla., area. 
</P>
<P>
Indicted in connection with the scheme were the operators of the farms, Willie 
Jones, 46, of Goulds, Fla., and David Jones, 53, of Naranja, Fla.; Colon E. 
Bustamante, 58, of Jersey City, N.J., a notary public who accompanied some of 
the aliens to the Paterson, N.J., INS office to assist them in interviews; and 
Victor A. Nassif, 52, of Goffstown, N.H., who is charged with helping the 
aliens complete false applications for temporary resident status. 
</P>
<P>
Also indicted were: Michel Melki, 29, of Buena Park, Calif.; Atef Eid, 42, of 
New York, N.Y.; Awad Hamada, 29, of Brooklyn, N.Y.; Abed El Kafar, 35, of 
Astoria, N.Y.; Muhammad Masnu, 40, of Bronx, N.Y.; Adres Prada, 36, of Miami, 
Fla.; and Wahid Zaman, age unknown, of Astoria, N.Y.

STATE PANEL 'OPENS' REGION FOR CARE OF THE POOR 
</P>

<P>
Concerned that Orange County's second largest Medi-Cal provider is quitting the 
state health system for the poor, the state commission that negotiates hospital 
contracts has suddenly revamped its rules, allowing indigent patients to get 
care at any hospital in the Fountain Valley-Huntington Beach-Westminster area. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by the seven-member California Medical Assistance Commission board 
was made Thursday, as the 293-bed Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical 
Center prepared to quit the Medi-Cal system at midnight Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley still plans to terminate its Medi-Cal contract. But by 
consensus, the Medical Assistance Commission agreed to allow Fountain Valley, 
plus three nearby hospitals that currently do not have Medi-Cal contracts, to 
treat non-emergency, indigent patients and receive state reimbursement. Under 
the state health system, Medi-Cal recipients generally must go to one of Orange 
County's 13 Medi-Cal contracting hospitals. But now, in designating this 
west-central county area "open," Medi-Cal recipients can go to any hospital in 
the area for emergency or non-emergency care. 
</P>
<P>
"We did it because, with Fountain Valley leaving the area (quitting Medi-Cal), 
we didn't have enough beds to ensure access" to health care for the poor, CMAC 
general counsel Byron Chell said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, other CMAC officials had maintained earlier this year that Orange 
County did have sufficient beds for the poor. But that was before August, when 
Fountain Valley and subsequently three other hospitals announced that they 
planned to quit the Medi-Cal system. The other hospitals in Fountain Valley's 
area -- 182-bed Humana Hospital-Westminster, 141-bed Humana Hospital-Huntington 
Beach and 109-bed Pacifica Community Hospital -- do not have Medi-Cal 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Chell added that the commission was worried about a gap in care for Medi-Cal 
patients had it not allowed non-contracting hospitals to be reimbursed for 
treating Medi-Cal patients in this section of Orange County. He noted, however, 
that doctors first must agree to treat these patients and that the commission 
will be monitoring whether Orange County doctors in this area are willing to do 
that. 
</P>
<P>
(In "closed" Medi-Cal areas -- a designation which covers most of central and 
northern Orange County -- hospitals without contracts can be reimbursed for 
giving emergency care to Medi-Cal patients, but not for non-emergency care. 
That reimbursement, hospital officials say, is usually well below a facility's 
actual treatment costs.) 
</P>
<P>
The commission's decision to "open up" the Fountain Valley area took hospital 
leaders in Orange and Los Angeles counties by surprise. Some called it good 
news for poor women in the area who, for at least two years, have faced severe 
overcrowding in Medi-Cal hospital maternity wards. 
</P>
<P>
"I think my initial reaction is this is good news -- maybe a practical first 
step," said Richard E. Butler, Fountain Valley's administrator. "But our 
feeling is a broader area needs to be opened up" to include hospitals such as 
UCI Medical Center and Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, which are also 
overburdened with Medi-Cal maternity patients, Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
Butler has spent much of the past three months asking Medi-Cal leaders as well 
as local, state and federal legislators to abandon the 8-year-old Medi-Cal 
contracting system in all of Orange County and instead adopt a system in which 
every hospital takes its "fair share" of Medi-Cal patients. 
</P>
<P>
Butler noted that his facility's decision to quit Medi-Cal was not motivated by 
the state's poor reimbursement for Medi-Cal patients, but rather because for 
the past two years the hospital has been deluged with these patients, 
jeopardizing the quality of all patient care. Fountain Valley's maternity 
division, for instance, has been delivering about 400 babies a month in a 
facility designed for 300. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, John Cochran, president of La Palma Intercommunity Hospital, warned 
that the commission decision to "open up" a small part of Orange County "will 
have very little impact" on Fountain Valley's maternity load. Also, he said, 
the remaining dozen Medi-Cal hospitals in north and central Orange County will 
still have a heavy load of indigent patients. 
</P>
<P>
Cochran and other hospital officials noted that La Palma and Martin Luther 
Hospital in Anaheim have given notice that they plan to terminate their 
Medi-Cal contracts in January. Also reportedly intending to terminate its 
Medi-Cal contract by year's end is a key Medi-Cal maternity provider, AMI 
Medical Center of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
But another hospital leader was more optimistic about CMAC's decision. "It 
helps a little," said David Langness, vice president of the Hospital Council of 
Southern California. "I think it's the precursor to most likely all of Orange 
County being opened" and no hospital being required to take Medi-Cal patients. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the largest "open" Medi-Cal area in Orange County is South County, 
where a Medi-Cal patient can go to any hospital for emergency or elective care. 
And if a doctor agrees to care for him, the doctor and the hospital can be 
reimbursed for that care.

MIKE PENNER: THEIR ONLY WHICH WAY IS UP

Jim Hess, the football coach at New Mexico State, is a good ol' boy with a bad 
ol' team. He knew this going in. Hess inherited a program then in the throes of 
a 17-game losing streak and now in the throes of a 27-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm only taking credit for 10 of 'em," Hess said. 
</P>
<P>
Hess never made any pretense about turning Aggie football around overnight. 
Hours after he first set boot in Las Cruces, just off the plane from Stephen F. 
Austin State, Hess opened his first news conference by introducing himself as 
the new coach of "the worst football team in the country." 
</P>
<P>
He said, "It would be foolish to raise expectations around here." 
</P>
<P>
He said he could see no difference in making the move from Division I-AA 
football to Division I-A. 
</P>
<P>
"What difference?" Hess said. "I don't have as many good players now as I did 
in Division I-AA." 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, Hess has been true to his word. Right now, New Mexico State 
has the worst team in the country, at least in Division I-A, at least in the 
national polls. The 0-10 Aggies are ranked 106th out of 106, but this week, 
after 2 1/2 years in the bunker, they have spotted hope on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies have seen the enemy, and its name is Cal State Fullerton, 1-10 and 
ranked 105th in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's game at the aptly named Aggie Memorial Stadium will be a 
breakthrough. College football still has no viable system to determine its true 
champion, but this year, it has stumbled into a way to determine who's the 
worst. 
</P>
<P>
Head to head, guano y guano -- that's the only way to decide it. 
</P>
<P>
Excitement is high in Las Cruces, as high as excitement ever gets in Las 
Cruces. (There's been kind of a lull since the trial of Billy The Kid.) A crowd 
of 15,000 is expected Saturday. There will whooping and hollering and quite 
possibly, the way Fullerton plays defense, history. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State can move the football. Quarterback David Chisum, late of Sunny 
Hills High School and Fullerton College, has thrown for 1,989 yards, 11 
touchdowns and is 15 completions shy of the school's single-season record. 
Fullback Jimmie Mitchell has rushed for 684 yards and a 4.7 average. Wide 
receiver Alvin Warren has caught 46 passes and scored five touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies also have that flea, Dat Ly, the diminutive man who kicks field 
goals from long distances. Ly was born in South Vietnam on Dec. 1, 1966, and 
left on April 29, 1975 -- the day Saigon fell. Now a senior, Ly is nine for 11 
on field-goal tries this season -- perfect inside the 50 -- and needs one more 
to break the school's career record. 
</P>
<P>
New Mexico State's problems come when the Aggies turn the football over or 
don't protect Chisum's back or don't do much of anything when the other team 
has the ball. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies have a turnover ratio of minus-21 and have allowed 62, 55 and 56 
points in three of their past four games. But New Mexico State has been at its 
worst when it tries to pass block. 
</P>
<P>
The Chisum trail has been a painful one, lined with an insane, inhumane 47 
sacks. Paul Schulte, Fullerton's shellshocked quarterback, is as comfy as Joe 
Montana by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
"David Chisum ought to be honored as a veteran of World War III," Hess said, 
"because I don't think I've ever had a player that has taken the physical abuse 
and whipping he has. Never had one like that who is still walking. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had some that have been hit hard and were gone, but he's still out there. 
He did break his wrist and bummed his knee up, but in the 11th ballgame, it is 
amazing that he is still standing." 
</P>
<P>
The definitive snapshot of Chisum's season came after one plastering during a 
55-10 loss at Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
"Chisum came off the field, and he was peeking out of his ear hole," Hess 
recalls. "He looked like Wile E. Coyote in a Roadrunner cartoon, just after he 
blew himself up again." 
</P>
<P>
Hess is pained, too, when he looks at the first half of New Mexico State's 
season and sees the near-misses: 27-24 at UTEP, 31-27 at Long Beach, 24-20 
against Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that if we had done a better job of coaching," Hess said, " . . . we 
could've won three or four ballgames. There was enough closeness in there that 
if we had been a little better prepared or made a play here or there, we 
would've been all right. 
</P>
<P>
"As I look back on it, I see things we could've done different and things we 
could've done better as coaches." 
</P>
<P>
It's been a rough year all around. Hess is a funny guy, but his weekly radio 
talk show has become a breeding farm for unintentional laughs. Every Wednesday, 
The Jim Hess Show airs from Eddie's Bar and Grill, and the idea is for Hess to 
field phone calls from listeners. But KOBE-FM is a low-budget operation -- even 
for Las Cruces -- and sometimes Hess gets the news feed instead of the question 
about his linebackers. 
</P>
<P>
The result: 
</P>
<P>
"Coach, can you hear the question?" 
</P>
<P>
"No, but I just heard something about Saddam Hussein." 
</P>
<P>
Given the chance, Hess sends out no mixed signals. He recognized the haul 
involved when he accepted the New Mexico State job. He knew this program had 
nowhere to go but up. That's why he hitched up in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Before the season, Hess said he came to Las Cruces "to try to do something no 
one else has done. If I do it, I'm a legend. If I don't, I'll retire, or 
they'll retire me." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Hess is no legend yet. But if he wins Saturday, he may get his own statue.

RAMS: A YEAR AGO, TOP DRAFT PICK BILL HAWKINS TORE A KNEE LIGAMENT. NOW, THE 
COACHING STAFF IS TURNING UP THE HEAT ON THE DEFENSIVE LINEMAN.

Doug Reed watches Bill Hawkins in practice every day, and what he sees makes 
him shake his head with empathy. 
</P>
<P>
What he sees is a young defensive lineman whom Reed says probably won't be 
physically ready to meet his coaches' high expectations until next season. 
</P>
<P>
And what Reed, an eight-year veteran defensive lineman, also sees is a proud 
player who won't admit it to himself, who wants to play so badly that he is 
hurting his career. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like he's really being pushed, and I really don't believe that he's 
ready," Reed said. "I think if he was in his fifth, sixth, seventh year, he'd 
say, 'I just can't go. I just can't go.' 
</P>
<P>
"Because when we go out there and you're not able to do your best, you're being 
judged for what you're doing out there and people who really don't know what 
he's going through are saying, 'The kid's a No. 1 draft pick, he can't even 
rush the passer. . . . ' 
</P>
<P>
"If the guy is healthy, I know he can be the type of guy they thought he 
would." 
</P>
<P>
It has been almost year since Hawkins tore a ligament in his left knee, and the 
Rams' coaching staff this week has clearly stepped up the pressure on Hawkins 
to start playing with fire. 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson said this week that the Rams have concluded it is time for 
Hawkins to find a role. Just last week, Hawkins was one of two players the Rams 
deactivated. In the exhibition season, Hawkins had been counted on to be a 
starter, only to disappoint with his play. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've made the decision that he's healthy," said Robinson, who also 
added that Hawkins has "obviously floundered" so far this season. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins, for his part, declined an interview request Thursday, saying he had to 
go to a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"You talk to the guy," Reed said, "you say, 'Hey, Billy, if you're hurt you 
shouldn't really be out here, really.' 
</P>
<P>
"It's like taking a test before you study -- it just doesn't work. You don't 
give yourself the benefit of the doubt. The man can only give what he has. He 
can't give his potential, he can only give what he has." 
</P>
<P>
Defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur said he understands that Hawkins is still 
feeling the effects of the injury, and that the team expects him to make a full 
comeback eventually. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably a lack of confidence as much as anything, either consciously or 
subconsciously, and what we're trying to do is work through that," Shurmur 
said. "And he'll work through it, it's just a matter of he and us recognizing 
we've got to put some extra effort into it. There's no reason he can't be the 
same guy he was before he was injured. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we're going to get him in a position where we can get him in a 
ballgame and he'll be productive. He needs that and we need that. We're just 
accelerating the program a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
Dexter Manley as a Ram? It might be possible. 
</P>
<P>
Manley, the longtime Redskin defensive end, is scheduled to have a hearing with 
NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue today about lifting his lifetime ban for 
substance abuse. Tagliabue is expected to make a ruling by Monday, and reports 
in Washington indicate that the commissioner is expected to grant Manley's 
request -- one year after the ban was ordered. 
</P>
<P>
If Manley is reinstated, team sources have told the Washington Post, it is 
almost certain Manley will be promptly released by the Redskins, who are said 
to be weary of the entire affair. 
</P>
<P>
And if this scenario unfolds, Robinson said the Rams would have to be 
interested -- cautious, but interested -- in Manley, who is a proven pass 
rusher. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson also said that before the Rams, who would be in prime waiver-wire 
position to claim him, moved to acquire Manley, they would have to make sure he 
is clean and enthusiastic about playing for them. 
</P>
<P>
"Those things demand investigation once you decide to do something," Robinson 
said. "There wouldn't be any reason we wouldn't (be interested). (But) we'd 
need some information." 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Manley said if the Redskins didn't want him, he'd prefer playing 
for the Raiders or the Dolphins.

THIS MUSCULAR PAIR IS HELPING TO DEFINE THE LINE AT VILLA PARK

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The strength of the Villa Park High School football team can be found in the 
weight room six days a week. It's there that Damon Becknel and Brian Pearsall 
-- the Spartans' beef boys -- perfect their skills. 
</P>
<P>
These aren't finesse guys. They don't need a stopwatch or even a football to 
demonstrate their abilities. They just peel off their shirts and start pumping 
iron. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Becknel and Pearsall are big, big, big. 
</P>
<P>
For the past two seasons, they have been the bulk that opened holes for Villa 
Park running backs and the brawn that has shut down opposing offenses. They are 
the main reason the Spartans are no pushovers. 
</P>
<P>
At 7:30 tonight, they'll attempt to shove Loara around in the first round of 
the Southern Section Division III playoffs at Glover Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Who wins will depend greatly on the offensive and defensive lines. Loara and 
Villa Park are predominantly running teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the game will come down to whoever controls the front line," Villa 
Park Coach Pat Mahoney said. 
</P>
<P>
And it's Becknel (6 feet 5, 240 pounds) and Pearsall (6-3, 230) the Spartans 
depend on for that. 
</P>
<P>
"Brian and Damon are very good at moving people around," Spartan quarterback 
Jason Martian said. "They're great to hang out with too. No one bothers us." 
</P>
<P>
Pearsall and Becknel are just the latest in a long line of good linemen at 
Villa Park. Pearsall has been a starter for three seasons, Becknel for two. 
</P>
<P>
This season, they are also team captains. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of pride involved with being a lineman at Villa Park," Becknel 
said. "We feel we should be able to dominate the other guy. That's the way we 
were taught." 
</P>
<P>
Although Becknel and Pearsall play well on both offense and defense, they do 
have preferences. 
</P>
<P>
Pearsall, a defensive end and offensive guard, is adept at reading opponents' 
offenses and getting to the ball. He is so good at it that teams double- and, 
sometimes, triple-team him . . . and he still gets to the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"Brian is the type of player who can dominate a game on defense," Mahoney said. 
</P>
<P>
Against Los Alamitos, he had four sacks in a 17-10 loss. Against Orange, he 
made seven unassisted tackles in a 24-7 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel more comfortable on defense," said Pearsall, who has a 3.3 grade-point 
average. "I can rely on my instincts more." 
</P>
<P>
Becknel, a defensive and offensive tackle, is a solid blocker, opening holes 
for tailbacks Ellis Williams (798 yards), Donnie Bladow (300 yards) and Ryan 
Tsui (249 yards). He has handled some of Orange County's top defensive linemen 
during the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Defense can be fun, but I enjoy playing offense," said Becknel, who has a 3.9 
grade-point average. "There's a plan to every play, and I know who to hit and 
where to hit him." 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, he neutralized Hartwell Brown in the Spartans' 24-21 upset of No. 
1-ranked Los Alamitos. Becknel also controlled Isaac Alo in a 27-0 victory over 
Santa Ana Valley that clinched a playoff spot for Villa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who is at Stanford this season, and Alo were all-county selections last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"Damon has had some great games against the best defensive linemen in the 
county," Mahoney said. "He seems to get pumped up for those assignments." 
</P>
<P>
Becknel and Pearsall were thrown together as freshmen. But they were very 
different players. 
</P>
<P>
Pearsall had played organized football since he was 8 and already was 
well-skilled in the ways of a lineman. He had a reputation as a fierce 
competitor even before he got to high school. 
</P>
<P>
Becknel, on the other hand, had never played tackle football. He had always 
been too large for youth teams, which have weight limits. 
</P>
<P>
But they did have one thing in common. 
</P>
<P>
"We were the two biggest guys on the team, so we were paired together for 
drills," Pearsall said. 
</P>
<P>
They started on the defensive line. On offense, Becknel played tackle, and 
Pearsall was a fullback -- the only time he has played a position other than 
lineman. 
</P>
<P>
Pearsall's freshman season came to an end in the third game when he 
hyper-extended his elbow. He underwent surgery two weeks later and wasn't able 
to work out again until December. 
</P>
<P>
After rehabilitation, Pearsall and Becknel began their routine of lifting 
together. Back then, Villa Park had two weight rooms, one for the varsity and 
one for everybody else. Becknel and Pearsall were asked to move to the varsity 
room during the winter of their freshmen years. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a lot more competitive in that room," Pearsall said. "That made Damon 
and me work even harder. The older guys accepted us and showed us the ropes. We 
learned what it meant to be linemen at Villa Park." 
</P>
<P>
It means that you're big, for starters.

RYAN SPREADING HIMSELF OUT -- BUT NOT TOO THINLY -- AT BREA

<P>
Mike Ryan is a starter in three sports at Brea-Olinda High School -- football, 
basketball and baseball -- and will have earned eight varsity letters when he 
graduates in June. 
</P>
<P>
As pep commissioner, he plans assemblies and rallies. He organized activities 
leading to the homecoming game and helped construct the senior float. And he is 
a member of the National Honor Society. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan is equally versatile on the football field, where he helped Brea win the 
Orange League title and earn the No. 4 seeding in the Southern Section Division 
VI playoffs. Brea (7-2-1) will play host to two-time defending champion Corona 
del Mar (5-4-1) at 7:30 tonight in the opening round. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan returns punts and kickoffs, holds for kicks, calls the defensive 
formations as a free safety and doubles as a backup tight end, wide receiver or 
running back. He intercepted four passes and scored three touchdowns, including 
a 94-yard kickoff return against Troy. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the hardest-hitting secondary player I've coached in 16 years," Brea 
Coach Jon Looney said. "Mike's strength is run support. He's very aggressive up 
front. He has good range, and he hits with the best of them." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan made the big plays in Brea's 23-21 victory over Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
First, he set up the winning field goal with a 43-yard pass reception from 
Jamie Baraglia. Then, he managed to control and hold a high center snap, 
allowing Marco Hernandez to kick a 27-yarder with 42 seconds remaining and give 
Brea its first victory over Valencia since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said he has replayed the film and still wonders how Valencia failed to 
block the field-goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"The snap was high and to my left, and I barely caught it," he said. "When I 
put the ball down, I looked up and saw two guys charging. I told myself, 'This 
isn't going to work.' 
</P>
<P>
"Somehow, the ball sailed right through one guy's arms, and then it nearly hit 
another guy in the head. It was fate." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said he reminded his teammates in the huddle before the kick that Brea was 
going to win because "we have somebody else on our side." 
</P>
<P>
Brea's players have worn No. 75 stickers on the side of their helmets in 
tribute to former teammate Brian Arredondo, who was killed in a traffic 
accident before the 1990 season. 
</P>
<P>
"I told everyone, 'Brian is with us,' " Ryan said. "Nobody gave us a chance 
against Valencia. There were a lot of doubters on campus. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing compares to winning the football title. Winning the league title means 
a lot to me. These are definitely good times. They've been about the best." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan has also experienced tough times. Only two years ago, he considered 
quitting football while struggling as a varsity reserve. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't playing much and wondered whether I wanted to continue playing 
football," he said. "There were some problems at home. I took a week off, and 
the guys on the team gave me a lot of support." 
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Looney, Ryan was moved to the junior varsity and was named 
the most valuable player. Last year, Ryan was a second-team all-league 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
He credits his mother with much of his subsequent success. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been just me and my mom (Pat) for the past 12 years," Ryan said. "She 
drove me to practice and to the games when I played Pop Warner football. She 
was my catcher when I practiced my pitching. 
</P>
<P>
"She's always been my biggest fan and supported me all the way. She's the 
best."

AVERAGE PRICE FOR HOMES DECLINES 9.1% IN OCTOBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Average home prices in Orange County dropped 9.1% in October to $236,421 from 
$260,180 a year earlier, although prices throughout the rest of Southern 
California remained fairly stable. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County price decline was most pronounced in the resale market, where 
the average price -- the lowest in 20 months -- was down 11.3% to $229,221 from 
$258,389 in October, 1989, according to TRW Real Estate Information Services. 
</P>
<P>
For the five-county region, total sales in October were down 21% from a year 
earlier but were up 10% from September. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate experts said the softening of prices contributed to last month's 
resurgence of home sales. 
</P>
<P>
New home prices throughout the Southland have been falling for several months 
as builders, desperate to reduce their building inventories, have been offering 
inducements ranging from free back-yard landscaping and cash rebates to new 
luxury cars and steep price reductions. 
</P>
<P>
And now realtors are starting to report significant rollbacks of resale prices 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen listed prices come down $50,000, even $60,000 in the past month or 
so," said Martha Jansen, owner of Century 21 offices in Fullerton and Yorba 
Linda. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's plummeting resale prices are especially important because, with 
home prices in the county among the highest in the nation, the stagnant new 
home market is dependent on resales. 
</P>
<P>
Most new home buyers in the county find the cash for their down payment in the 
equity they pull out of their old home, but high resale prices have stalled 
activity in that portion of the market for months. 
</P>
<P>
So while October home sales in the region still were far below the year-earlier 
level, declining prices helped bolster Orange County's market. Sales of 3,582 
new and used homes and condominiums were off only 0.3% from 3,593 sales in 
October, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The month's 3,066 resales in the county were down 5% for the 12-month period 
but up 7.8% from 2,843 in September. 
</P>
<P>
Overall prices in the five Southland counties fell 3% in October from 
September, TRW reported, with Orange County's 3.9% decline for the month again 
the sharpest drop in the region. 
</P>
<P>
With the situation in the Mideast still unsettled and a growing number of 
economists openly talking about a fourth-quarter recession, industry insiders 
generally believed October sales "would be as bad as, or worse than, 
September's," said Ed Setzer, vice president of TRW Real Estate Information 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino, Riverside and San Diego counties all showed slight to moderate 
price appreciation from October to October, ranging from 0.6% in San Diego 
county to 7.1% in Riverside. The combined average sales price of new and resale 
homes in Los Angeles County dropped 0.8% over the 12-month period. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, we're a bit surprised at the resiliency and vitality of the Southern 
California housing market," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But one month's figures aren't the basis for a forecast of great things to 
come, cautioned Milt Naylor, executive vice president of Grubb &amp; Ellis 
Residential Brokerage Services' Pacific Southwest Region. "There are a lot of 
buyers out there, but a lot of them are still waiting to see if we've hit 
bottom," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Clive Hoffman, director of the Mortgage Institute of California, said he does 
not see any signs of a massive recovery in home sales. 
</P>
<P>
"We are still seeing an explosion of prospective equity borrowers," he said. 
"And that seems to indicate that people are not moving into new homes like they 
were two years ago. Instead, they still are taking out equity loans to improve 
their existing homes. And that is symptomatic of slow sales of new and existing 
homes." 
</P>
<P>
Still, October's price declines are a welcome occurence because they will help 
break down the buyer resistance that has helped stall the real estate market, 
Naylor said. A total of 21,208 new and resale homes and condominiums changed 
hands during October in the five Southland counties, up from 19,331 sales 
recorded in September but still well below the 26,671 sales that closed in 
October, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Sales dropped from October to October in all five of the counties, with Orange 
County posting the best comparison as its tumbling prices pulled some shoppers 
back into the market. San Diego County posted the steepest drop in sales over 
the year, down 34.9%; Riverside County sales plunged 32.5%, and sales for the 
12-month period were off 19.3% in Los Angeles County and 16% in San Bernardino 
County, TRW reported. 
</P>
<P>
But sales were up in each county when compared to September levels, with 
increases ranging from 4.1% in San Diego County to 13.6% in San Bernardino 
County.

FIRM HOPES CLEAN AIR LAW WILL LIFT SALES; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: STRUGGLING POLLUTION RESEARCH AND CONTROL CORP. EXPECTS THE NEW 
FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT TO INCREASE DEMAND FOR ITS EMISSIONS MONITORING DEVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pollution Research and Control Corp. is a tiny Glendale company that makes 
devices for monitoring air pollution. Since it was founded in 1971, its success 
in the U.S. market had been limited, so in 1988 Pollution Research turned to 
overseas markets -- particularly South Korea -- which recently have accounted 
for more than half of its sales. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the Korean market has proved an unsteady one for Pollution 
Research, and in the year that ended June 30, the company lost $1.45 million on 
$5.4 million in revenues. Not only were South Korean sales slipping, the same 
was true for domestic sales. 
</P>
<P>
But with the new federal clean air act, signed Thursday by President Bush, 
Pollution Research stands to participate in what could be a bonanza for 
companies that make pollution control and measurement products. These products 
will be needed by government agencies and factories to measure emissions of 
sulfur dioxide and other pollutants from smokestacks and in the surrounding 
air. 
</P>
<P>
"We see a very positive impact," said Albert E. Gosselin Jr., Pollution 
Research's president and chief executive. Gosselin estimated that the 
legislation could result over the next year in a more than $2-million jump in 
the company's sales. 
</P>
<P>
Gosselin said specific provisions in the legislation that will most directly 
help his company are those concerning acid rain. Pollution Research's monitors 
measure sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen -- two of the key components of 
acid rain. Most of the electronic devices are about the size and shape of 
stereo receivers, cost $4,000 to $18,000, and analyze gases using ultraviolet 
light. 
</P>
<P>
Pollution Research hopes to sell more products to its traditional customers -- 
mostly utilities and government agencies such as the California Air Resources 
Board -- which will need the devices to monitor compliance with the new 
emissions standards. Orders may also come from consulting companies that buy 
the equipment on behalf of manufacturers, Gosselin said. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts agree that the clean-air legislation could be a boon for 
companies in the $50-million-a-year domestic air pollution-monitoring business. 
"We're not just talking 20% or 30% growth here," said Stephen Schweich of Alex 
Brown &amp; Sons in Baltimore. "The market for emissions monitoring systems is 
going to expand geometrically," Schweich said. 
</P>
<P>
But John G. Taylor, an analyst at L.H. Alton &amp; Co. in San Francisco, 
cautioned that the clean-air legislation is still no guarantee that Pollution 
Research will manage a turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because the stage is set doesn't mean business is going to start walking 
in the door," Taylor said. "It's a question of executing a marketing plan and 
getting in front of enough people. I think the jury is still out as to whether 
they can do that." 
</P>
<P>
Pollution Research's track record has been spotty. Founded in 1971 by Gosselin, 
a mechanical engineer, Pollution Research (formerly named Dasibi Environmental 
Corp.) made a disastrous 1973 investment in a Colorado cattle ranch, from which 
it took the company several years to recover. The company has also fought an 
uphill, mostly losing, battle against its two biggest competitors. 
</P>
<P>
That's partly because the two competitors have the resources of large 
corporations to draw from. Massachusetts-based Thermo Instrument Systems is a 
division of Thermo Electron, which has annual sales of $400 million. Lear 
Siegler, a $2.5-billion concern, has a Colorado division that makes pollution 
monitoring equipment. 
</P>
<P>
To compete for contracts against its big rivals, Pollution Research more than 
doubled its staff to 86 workers from June to December of last year. But 
Gosselin said the increased overhead came at a time when domestic orders for 
pollution monitoring equipment started to slow as companies waited to see what 
the final clean-air legislation would contain. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, orders from South Korea's equivalent of the Environmental Protection 
Agency, a big Pollution Research customer, also started to dry up. 
</P>
<P>
Gosselin said he has taken steps to try to turn the company around, including 
cutting the staff by more than half to 33 workers. He is also hoping to team up 
with larger partners.

FUNDS TO INSURE BANK, S&amp;L DEPOSITS CALLED 'UNDER STRESS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by James S. Granelli, Times staff writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The federal fund that insures deposits at the nation's banks and savings and 
loans is "under stress" but "not stressed out," a top regulator told about 400 
Orange County bankers and accountants last week. 
</P>
<P>
"The pace of failures should have slowed, but we have an uncooperative 
economy," said Anthony Scalzi, western regional director of the Resolution 
Trust Corp., which operates and liquidates failed S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
He said the nation's troubled banks are "usually the squirts" -- referring to 
small banks. He predicted that about 200 banks nationwide would fail this year. 
He also said that a major bank -- he had no idea which one -- will probably 
fail soon. 
</P>
<P>
Scalzi was filling in for an ailing L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp., at a joint dinner meeting of the Orange County Bankers 
Society and the local chapter of the California Society of Certified Public 
Accountants. 
</P>
<P>
Scalzi, a former banking regulator, said the increased premiums that banks pay 
to the FDIC for deposit insurance aren't going down, but the higher premiums 
are "still a bargain." 
</P>
<P>
"The alternatives stink," he said. "You can't put up a sign saying 'Not insured 
by the FDIC,' and I don't see us lowering insured accounts to $80,000 or 
$60,000" from the current $100,000 per account holder." 
</P>
<P>
Scalzi also told bankers that regulators probably will grant them broader 
investment powers to help them grow faster and compete with banks worldwide, 
but "if we're going to increase the speed, we're going to put more cops out on 
patrol," he said, referring to stepped-up enforcement powers the regulators 
would get.

2 BROTHERS TO PLEAD GUILTY, AID DIET PATCH INQUIRY; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: THE TARGET OF THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION OVER ALLEGED MAIL AND 
SECURITIES FRAUD IS THEIR UNCLE, WHO HEADED SEVERAL SOUTH COUNTY FIRMS. 
INVESTORS LOST UP TO $11 MILLION.

<P>
Federal authorities said Thursday that they have filed mail and securities 
fraud charges against two brothers involved in a scheme to raise millions of 
dollars for a phony diet patch that was supposed to suppress hunger. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan D. and Mark A. Sterns, both former Orange County residents, agreed to 
plead guilty to the charges and to cooperate in the ongoing criminal 
investigation of several firms headed by their uncle, David A. Sterns. 
</P>
<P>
The charges against the Sterns brothers and the plea agreement were filed 
Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana. According to the agreement, the 
U.S. attorney general's office, in return for the brothers' assistance, has 
promised not to make more charges against them in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Paul L. Seave said the number of investors defrauded by 
the patch scam and the amount of money lost is still being determined. In 
March, 1989, Postal Inspector James C. Vach estimated that about 22,000 
investors had been bilked out of $9 million to $11 million. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Sterns, 34, who now lives in Texas, and Jonathan Sterns, 30, who lives in 
Florida, are expected to enter a formal guilty pleas Monday in Santa Ana to one 
charge of mail fraud and another of conspiring to sell unregistered securities. 
They could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers could each face a sentence of up to 10 years in prison and a fine 
of up to $500,000, plus be ordered to pay restitution, with the court deciding 
how much of the losses are their responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
However, in a letter to the brothers' attorney, federal authorities said they 
will recommend that the court impose prison sentences of not more than five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers have agreed to "cooperate fully" with the Justice Department in 
helping to complete an investigation in progress for two years. Among other 
things, they have promised to "respond truthfully" before a grand jury or at 
trial and to "produce voluntarily any and all documents, records and other 
tangible evidence." 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1989, law enforcement agents from a half-dozen regulatory agencies 
swooped down on the Irvine headquarters of the diet patch business and loaded 
two postal trucks with potential evidence. 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service, Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue 
Service have been involved in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The main target was David Sterns, the uncle. The Justice Department alleges 
that the brothers were part of a scheme conceived by their uncle in early 1988 
to manufacture and distribute a device called Le Patch. Worn on the skin, it 
was purported to have been designed by a UCLA doctor and to have the ability to 
suppress appetite. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials allege that David Sterns -- operating through former South 
Orange County corporations named Gentre Laboratories Inc., Omnisource Inc. and 
New Source Ltd. -- made or had others make "false and fraudulent" 
representations that led investors to wrongly believe that Le Patch could be 
sold without approval from the Food and Drug Administration or that the device 
had obtained FDA approval. 
</P>
<P>
David Sterns, who has denied wrongdoing, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attorney general's office said that if the case against the brothers 
had gone to trial, the Justice Department would have sought to prove that 
Jonathan Sterns, who was made president of Gentre by his uncle, "assisted in 
making arrangements for the manufacture of the appetite suppressant, knowing 
that FDA approval, though required, had not been obtained, and knowing that the 
device ultimately manufactured and distributed was in fact not the device 
invented by the UCLA doctor." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Sterns was president of other companies not involved in this case that 
were controlled by his uncle, but he also played a role in the patch business, 
Seave said. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers have been charged with joining others in creating "backdated, 
false corporate documents in order to create the false appearance that the 
securities of corporations controlled by David D. Sterns could be freely traded 
without being registered with the SEC." 
</P>
<P>
It is further alleged that David Sterns sent a newsletter through the mail that 
falsely said distribution of the patch was being delayed until a larger and 
more efficient manufacturing process was arranged, when in fact no manufacturer 
had agreed to make it. 
</P>
<P>
Seave said that although the brothers are not believed to have worked on the 
mailings, they are culpable, because they were involved in the overall scheme.

JOSEPH N. BELL: THIS WISH LIST DRIVES HIM TO DISTRACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I used my Continental Airlines pass to go to Colorado last week, dividing my 
time between my grandchildren in Boulder and a visit to Aspen, which I had 
never seen in winter. God obliged, giving me a little more winter than I really 
needed, which made it a rather hazardous drive from Denver to Aspen. 
</P>
<P>
But I was determined, and I hung in, spending two glorious picture-postcard 
days in Aspen, which I had virtually to myself since I beat the beginning of 
the ski season by several weeks. All of which is a long preamble to Glenwood 
Canyon and the direction it set me thinking. 
</P>
<P>
Glenwood Canyon is a 15-mile-long crevice in the Rocky Mountains that has to be 
navigated on I-70 to get from Denver to Grand Junction. For many years when I 
drove this route, I-70 dwindled to a torturous two-lane road for this 15 miles, 
usually spent behind trucks creeping along at 20 m.p.h. and impossible to pass. 
</P>
<P>
About seven years ago, the state of Colorado set out to build four lanes of 
highway through Glenwood Canyon -- and I have watched the project with 
fascination ever since. I have no engineering expertise and usually very little 
interest in such things, but this is a challenge hard to ignore. Each time I 
pass through, a little more of it is done. The one constant is the 
30-to-60-minute delay. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is totally out of character, I've never been impatient with the 
delay because it gives me time to study how this remarkable stretch of road is 
taking shape. I had to traverse Glenwood Canyon twice on this recent trip, each 
time with a 30-minute delay. Both ends of the road have been completed, but 
there is a seven-mile section in the middle -- including a stretch of tunnel 
through solid rock -- that is still under construction. And to this unpracticed 
eye, will be for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
As I cleared the canyon and relaxed my grip on the steering wheel, I mused, 
half-aloud: "I hope I live to see this finished." It's an old cliche, but it 
set me to thinking -- which is mostly what one does when driving long stretches 
of open highway alone. And on this Colorado highway on this day, I pondered the 
question: What else do I hope to live long enough to see or do? 
</P>
<P>
The road was free enough of traffic that I could jot down my thoughts as they 
came to me. So here is a partial list in answer to that question: 
</P>
<P>
* To watch the California Angels play in a World Series. I could probably have 
no better guarantee of longevity than this. 
</P>
<P>
* To enjoy the experience, just once, of having our bubble-headed dachshund, 
Coco, come the first time I call her. Or the second. 
</P>
<P>
* To see low-cost housing built in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
* To watch Bill Mulligan's UC Irvine basketball team play in an NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
* To witness a U.S. political campaign devoted solely to the positions of the 
two candidates on the issues that divide them. 
</P>
<P>
* To see a cure for AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
* To drive a car powered by something other than an internal combustion engine. 
</P>
<P>
* To see middle-class Southern Californians using public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
* To know that my grandchildren will not have to go to war. Or anyone else's 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
* To wallow in a Midwestern fall. 
</P>
<P>
* To eat gravy without worrying about cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
* To see a cure for cancer. 
</P>
<P>
* To witness an election in which a proud and avowed member of the ACLU wins 
public office in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
* To finish writing the novel that has been in my desk drawer for the last 
eight years. 
</P>
<P>
* To hear Richard Nixon admit that he was wrong -- and mean it. 
</P>
<P>
* To see a revival of "Showboat" in which the lyrics of "Ol' Man River" are 
sung as Oscar Hammerstein wrote them. 
</P>
<P>
* To read Ariel and Will Durant's "History of Mankind" and the "Interpreter's 
Bible" in their entirety. 
</P>
<P>
* To stop searching for simple answers to complex questions. 
</P>
<P>
* To experience a great-grandchild. 
</P>
<P>
* To spend a month is Paris -- while I'm still strong and healthy enough to 
walk its streets every day. 
</P>
<P>
* To procure another bathroom at home. 
</P>
<P>
* To develop a tennis backhand strong enough that the people I'm playing will 
stop hitting every ball in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
* To see the car telephone outlawed. 
</P>
<P>
* To see the hole in the front of our house put there by a wayward motorist 
converted into a magnificent bay window. 
</P>
<P>
* To no longer need to understand how God and evil can co-exist in the same 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
I figure this list will carry me to about 2020 at least. I'll have another look 
at it then -- maybe on the four-lane highway through Glenwood Canyon.

RANDY LEWIS: WILL NO ONE REPRESENT O.C. AT STATE ARTS FORUM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What if they gave a protest and nobody came? 
</P>
<P>
Since Wednesday, hundreds of arts leaders, patrons and advocates from 
throughout the state have been meeting in Los Angeles to discuss all manner of 
burning issues as part of the "1990 Congress of the Arts," presented by the 
California Confederation of the Arts, the state's largest nonprofit arts 
advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
Among the panels that have been or will be covered are "Arts and the Global 
Economy," "Beyond Disneyland: Getting California Arts on the International 
Tourism Map," "The Arts and the New Governor" and "Arts and Disabilities: An 
Agenda for the '90s." All are subjects you might expect to draw the interest of 
at least some Orange County arts leaders. 
</P>
<P>
One that looks especially inviting, though, is "The Fight for Freedom of 
Expression." Not only have there been several clashes over arts and censorship 
in Orange County that would seem to make such a seminar of interest to local 
arts types, but the organizers said they planned to focus on recent incidents 
in Costa Mesa, where irate citizens successfully persuaded the City Council to 
attach anti-obscenity regulations to city arts grants. 
</P>
<P>
Just one problem: Conference officials were nowhere near as successful in 
trying to persuade certain artists from Costa Mesa to take part in the 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I can understand why the local folks might not rush to a panel called 
"International and Multicultural Festivals: What Works and What Doesn't." We 
obviously have no need to take pointers from anyone on that front, still awash 
as we are in the artistic euphoria, the creative afterglow spawned by the 
recent Festival of Merchandising . . . er, Britain. 
</P>
<P>
But county arts leaders must have memories shorter than a freshman senator's. 
Have they forgotten so quickly about the storms set off by the Costa Mesa Civic 
Playhouse's staging of Christopher Durang's satire, "Sister Mary Ignatius 
Explains It All for You"? The La Habra Community Theatre board's refusal to let 
a director cast an interracial "Romeo and Juliet" for fear of upsetting the 
community? And how about the Grove Shakespeare Festival, which probably would 
get the blessing of certain City Council members if only they dropped all of 
that, you know, foreign stuff and staged a musical version of, say, "Wheel of 
Fortune." 
</P>
<P>
Confederation associate director Ken Larsen said he tried to involve officials 
from the Costa Mesa Playhouse and from South Coast Repertory, who unexpectedly 
found themselves on the censorship-sponsorship hot seat earlier this year. 
Remember when a couple of city residents took exception to the SCR flyer urging 
support for the National Endowment for the Arts? 
</P>
<P>
The Playhouse is still thinking about attending, but SCR -- clearly Orange 
County's big fish -- won't be there. Could there be a better victory for those 
who would silence voices and opinions they'd rather not hear? 
</P>
<P>
SCR's participation would have been especially significant because it is one of 
the very few Orange County arts organizations that has achieved national 
acclaim. Co-founder David Emmes, who turned the confederation down, wouldn't 
have needed to bellow "we're mad as hell," but with force and dignity might 
have let the rest of the state know that "we're not gonna take it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
But Emmes says that his PR man didn't tell him what the panel was about and 
that, anyway, we didn't have enough advance notice and we're awfully busy over 
here right now so would you please stop bugging us? 
</P>
<P>
The PR man, meanwhile, says he wasn't told that the invitation had anything to 
do with a "Freedom of Expression" seminar, while Larsen swears he made that 
perfectly clear. 
</P>
<P>
Funny thing: Lots of others who were invited to the panel -- including Bella 
Lewitzky, the acclaimed modern dance company director who's got to be at least 
as busy as David Emmes, and Arts Democratic Club vice president Bruce W. Davis, 
who's coming all the way from San Francisco -- managed to get the invitation 
straight and found that it came in plenty of time for them to arrange their 
schedules. But then, this wouldn't be the first time that Emmes has opted out 
of the spotlight as far as controversy is concerned (see accompanying story). 
</P>
<P>
In any case, with no Orange County representatives on this panel, the outside 
perception will persist that this is a region where freedom is limited to which 
credit card we use at Nordstrom, and self-expression is what follows the words 
"My Other Car Is a . . ." on our BMW license plate frames. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of how busy SCR might be, it certainly should be able to find at 
least one top official who could be sprung loose for a few hours to attend the 
Saturday morning session. Undoubtedly, officials there are more than happy that 
they wound up with their grant money safely in hand, and now would just as soon 
forget the whole thing. But it's a mistake to play ostrich -- or is it opossum? 
-- and then meekly hope that the opponents of free expression will turn their 
attention elsewhere. It's crucial to show that an arts community won't be 
intimidated by those who fear the unconventional, the unfamiliar, the 
unsettling. 
</P>
<P>
I hope circumstances don't arise in which SCR finds itself in need of 
vociferous support of arts organizations outside of Orange County. It might 
just hear the refrain of that great old country song, "When your phone don't 
ring -- it'll be me."

THE GOAL: FUN;

NOBODY'S KEEPING SCORE IN LEAGUE FOR 5-YEAR-OLD GIRLS

There is no blood left on the soccer field when the Bunnies meet the Lambs. 
</P>
<P>
And there are no winners or losers when the Ducklings take on the Fawns. When 
their game is over, the Kittens and the Puppies don't even know the score, but 
they exchange hugs anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the American Youth Soccer Organization's league for 5-year-old girls 
-- a league whose games are played on what AYSO organizers, with apologies to 
Disneyland, call the "Happiest Field in Mission Viejo." 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is for the kids to have fun," said Paul Beltis, program director for 
the local league. "We don't keep score and we don't have standings. The kids 
have the rest of their lives to be competitive." 
</P>
<P>
For the 102 girls in Division 7, the AYSO league is their first experience with 
organized youth sports. At this age, say AYSO coaches, the game is rather 
basic. Run down the field. Kick the ball. Aim for the goal. 
</P>
<P>
"The joy for them is kicking the ball and scoring," said Allan Gallup, 
commissioner of the Mission Viejo AYSO district, which he says is the second 
largest in the nation with more than 3,000 children. "So we don't use goalies." 
</P>
<P>
The girls tend to bunch around the ball like bees around a hive and buzz up and 
down the field, giggling and laughing. League officials like to tell stories 
about untangling the occasional overenthusiastic youngster from the nets when 
their momentum carries them into the goal. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, said Gallup, all 22 girls from both teams chased a ball 
beyond the end line and just kept going, ignoring the excited whistles of the 
referee as they ran, en masse, past startled players on the next soccer field, 
then scooted down a hill after the ball, stopping only when it jammed against a 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
"The game is so entertaining that parents on the next fields stop watching 
their kids and turn around to watch the girls," Beltis said. 
</P>
<P>
But gradually, they learn the basics of soccer, and in the learning also pick 
up some valuable social skills, their parents say. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially they are very shy," said Lorie Kilgore, as her daughter, Ashley, sat 
quietly by her side after a game last week at Youth Athletic Park in Mission 
Viejo. "Their attention span is very short, and they tend not to be very 
aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
"But then you see them grow and gain confidence in themselves," said Kilgore, 
who coaches the Ponies. "They learn so quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Every girl gets a uniform, and at the end of the year, everyone gets a trophy, 
said Peltis, whose daughter Jennifer, the last of his six children -- all girls 
-- is in the league. 
</P>
<P>
"They love it," he said. "It's their very own trophy, and they take it to 
preschool or kindergarten during show and tell and share it with the other 
kids, they're so proud of that trophy." 
</P>
<P>
And by the end of the season, the improvement in play from the early games is 
dramatic, he said. The girls eventually learn the meaning of end lines and how 
to guide the ball instead of kicking it aimlessly. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo is one of only three AYSO districts in the county that separate 
the girls from the boys, Gallup said. 
</P>
<P>
"Even at this age, the boys seem to be more aggressive," he said, which tends 
to send some of the girls into a shell. "As a rule the kids do better when they 
are separate and many (AYSO) districts in the Southern California area are 
trying to do that. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is, they don't have the numbers," Gallup said, "which is a shame 
because once they get started, the league really takes off." 
</P>
<P>
Called the "baby animal league" because the teams are named after infants in 
the animal world, the 5-year-olds were divided three years ago into six teams. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are 12 teams, and organizers say they are running out of baby 
animal names. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally settled on the Foals and the Fledglings for new names this year," 
Beltis said. "We were going to use Chicks, but we thought some of the parents 
might not be too happy about that." Christine Cotter / Los Angeles Times

IRIT EHRLICH: SIMPLE SHAPES AND LUXURY FABRICS ARE HER TRADEMARK. IN THE BEST 
NEW DESIGNS, GOLD LACE PLAYS AGAINST BLACK VELVET FOR A RICH EVENING LOOK.

Irit Ehrlich has three rules for designing clothes: simple shapes, basic colors 
and only the most exquisite fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
The results of this formula are lush and appealing, and it's easy to see why 
Ehrlich has survived in the antiquated world of custom order. 
</P>
<P>
In a fashion show Monday for the 500 Club of the City of Hope, Ehrlich gave a 
sampling of daytime, cocktail, black-tie and bridal clothes for the 
winter/holiday season under her label, Irit Designs. 
</P>
<P>
The colors were black, gray and ivory, with touches of gold and red; fabrics 
included silk velvet, silk satin, lace, wool and cashmere. 
</P>
<P>
Among the standouts: long wool herringbone jackets over short skirts and 
re-embroidered lace dresses sculpted to fit the body. 
</P>
<P>
To the surprise of some audience members, most skirts were about eight inches 
above the knee. They can, of course, be ordered in longer versions. 
</P>
<P>
At her very best, Ehrlich uses gold fabrics against black velvet for a look 
that has the richness and radiance of a Zeffirelli film: a sheer gold poet's 
jacket floats over a black silk velvet sheath, for example, and a long opera 
coat and pencil-slim pants, both in black silk velvet, pair with a splendid 
gold lace blouse with a scalloped edge.

MAKING SENSE OF STORE DEPARTMENTS

<P>
What's in a name? When it comes to those plastered above the departments within 
big stores, many are as cryptic as personalized license plates. Brass Plum, 
Visionaries and Club House, for example, don't tell shoppers anything about the 
designer labels, price range or quality of the clothes they might find there. 
</P>
<P>
It seems some of these non-informative headings were selected long ago, to 
suggest lifestyles. Marie Joyce, a Nordstrom spokeswoman, points to her store's 
Brass Plum, a.k.a. the junior department, as an example. Whatever meaning the 
term once had is lost on first-time shoppers today. 
</P>
<P>
Cutting through the jargon requires strategy: 
</P>
<P>
* When you find a garment you like, make a note of the department for future 
reference. It also helps to remember the name in the label. 
</P>
<P>
* Before shopping at a new store, call ahead. Ask the store operator which 
department carries your favorite labels. 
</P>
<P>
* If you are looking for a particular label, call the designer's headquarters 
and ask for the names of the stores in your area that carry their brand. 
Fashion magazine ads often list the phone numbers of designer's corporate 
offices. CINDY LaFAVRE YORKS

ZANG TOI: CHARTREUSE TWEEDS, A LACQUER RED MINI-OPERA COAT, A PINK TRENCH COAT. 
THE MALAYSIA-BORN DESIGNER IS NOTHING IF NOT EXOTIC.

Zang Toi never gave a thought to Americanizing his name, which now appears on 
the label of one of the hottest new collections in the country. It may read 
oddly (the last name is pronounced "toy"), but that hasn't hurt him one bit. 
</P>
<P>
New York-based and Malaysia-born, Toi is entering his second year in business 
after a five-year stint assisting New York designer Mary Jane Marcasiano. 
</P>
<P>
You see his quirky Amerasian style in the way he dresses: Shorts made of 
gold-threaded songket fabric traditionally used for wedding clothes, 
apple-green custom-made blazer, black velvet Belgian slippers. 
</P>
<P>
And you see it in his designs. In his fall collection, available at I. Magnin 
Beverly Hills, colors are as exotic as rare flora, such as chartreuse green 
tailored tweeds (paired with silver fox), a lacquer red moire mini-opera coat 
that reverses to a jewel-colored paisley, and a shocking pink trench coat 
paired with a bright red waist cincher. Prices range from $200 (shorts) to 
$1,800 (evening coat). 
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, the 29-year-old designer explains, is a multicultural country, 
composed of native Malay, Indians and Chinese -- his own heritage -- and he 
finds inspiration everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"I got my sense of color from the Indians who are known for wearing shocking 
pink, orange and red together. They treat shocking pink like navy here in 
America." BETTY GOODWIN

NANCY JOHNSON: HER CLOTHES FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS DWELL HEAVILY ON THE PAST,

Designer Nancy Johnson's nostalgic tea dresses and feminine frocks fill 
antique-strewn salons at Harrods in London and Saks Fifth Avenue in Beverly 
Hills, where she recently introduced Premiere, her first collection of evening 
wear. 
</P>
<P>
An avid collector of period gowns, which she finds in European antique stores 
and Los Angeles estate sales, Johnson is enthralled with the past. 
</P>
<P>
Her new evening wear is inspired by glamorous women through the ages. 
</P>
<P>
From the flappers of the '20s comes a black sequined silk crepe chemise; from 
the '60s society set, a velvet Empire dress with sheer floral beaded bodice and 
sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
Even modern-day Tinseltown is represented, with beaded chiffon bodysuits worn 
under short sarong skirts or palazzos. 
</P>
<P>
Many pieces have matching stoles, opera capes or embellished jackets. Prices 
range from $190 to $600. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson heads a $25-million empire and attends many formal events. She likes to 
make an entrance. 
</P>
<P>
"The dress shouldn't draw attention to itself but to its wearer," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"It's part of the whole picture. We notice the woman and say, 'isn't she 
glamorous?' " LIZ GARDNER

SAGA OF ROCKY BALBOA, ROUND BY ROUND; 
</P>
<P>
A MOVIEGOER'S GUIDE TO THE FOUR PREVIOUS SYLVESTER STALLONE 'ROCKY' MOVIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAT H. BROESKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The thought of "Rocky V" may leave some moviegoers feeling pummeled, pounded 
and downright punchy. 
</P>
<P>
But if it's easy to take jabs at the Rocky series -- and the critics have dealt 
plenty of kidney punches -- there is no denying the series' popularity. 
Consider: the total worldwide purse tops $762 million. 
</P>
<P>
Fans have made star/creator Sylvester Stallone a household name, and the films 
have launched the careers of a trio of athletic actors who've portrayed his 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Still, all the ring activity of titles "I" through "IV" can leave a moviegoer 
wobbly. What follows is a round-by-round guide to the Rocky films, to help 
readers stay on their feet. Now . . . the bell . . . 
</P>
<P>
ROUND 1: "Rocky" (1976). 
</P>
<P>
The scenario: At 30, Rocky Balboa -- aka the Italian Stallion -- is a club 
fighter who also works shaking down bad customers for Gazzo the loan shark (Joe 
Spinell). Rocky lives in a row house apartment with his turtles, Cuff and Link, 
and his fish, Moby Dick, and romances the shy and bespectacled pet shop 
attendant, Adrian (Talia Shire), who's the sister of his obnoxious best friend 
Paulie (Burt Young). 
</P>
<P>
The challenge: Apollo Creed (former Oakland Raiders linebacker Carl Weathers) 
-- a colorful, Muhammad Ali-like world heavyweight champ -- wants an underdog 
opponent for his big Bicentennial fight of Jan. 1, 1976. Suddenly, Rocky faces 
"the chance of a lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
The training regimen: Under the guidance of feisty trainer/gym owner Mick 
(Burgess Meredith), Rocky's up at 4 a.m., slurps down a cholesterol nightmare 
of five raw eggs, dons grimy sweats and hits the streets for solitary roadwork 
that climaxes with a run up the steps of Philly's Museum of Art -- to the 
inspirational background song of "Gonna Fly Now" (aka the "Rocky" theme). 
</P>
<P>
The big fight: It's the 190-pound Italian Stallion (64 fights, 44-20, with 38 
by knockout) vs. the 210-pound showboating Master of Disaster, Creed (46-0). In 
the bloody slugfest, Rocky lasts to the final bell. The split decision leaves 
the title with the defending champ, who gasps, "Ain't gonna be no rematch!" 
</P>
<P>
The stats: Filmed over 28 days for about $1 million, the sleeper of the year 
grossed $117.2 million domestically, $45 million in foreign territories and won 
three Oscars, including best picture. Nominated for both acting and writing, 
Stallone followed in the weighty steps of Charlie Chaplin in 1940 and Orson 
Welles in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
As for a sequel: "I'll never do another 'Rocky.' It's a once-in-a-lifetime trip 
. . .," says Stallone. 
</P>
<P>
ROUND 2: "Rocky II" (1979). 
</P>
<P>
The scenario: Opens with the last five minutes of the original Rocky. Then . . 
. Rocky and Adrian marry, buy a house and become parents-to-be. Warned that he 
could lose his right eye if he continues boxing, Rocky tries other jobs -- 
going from being a pitchman for commercials to menial labor. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge: Creed -- who's irate over letters from fans who claim he didn't 
really win his bout with Balboa -- goads Rocky into a rematch. 
</P>
<P>
The training regimen: To protect his bad eye, Rocky works out right-handed. He 
also chases chickens (for speed), and does the usual gym workouts and roadwork. 
This time, as he sprints up the steps of the museum, he's joined by hundreds of 
schoolchildren and a thunderous rendition of "Gonna Fly Now." 
</P>
<P>
Preliminaries: Adrian slips into a coma after giving birth to their son, Rocky 
Jr. When she finally awakens, she implores Rocky to win. 
</P>
<P>
The big fight: It's the 202-pound Rocky vs. the 220-pound Creed on Thanksgiving 
Day's Superfight II -- what one commentator dubs "World War III!" Knocked down 
in round two, Rocky rebounds and the fight goes 15 bloody rounds (Rocky changes 
to southpaw status for the 15th), climaxing with both battered warriors 
falling. . . Finally, it's Rocky who rises, to take the title and declare to 
the TV cameras and his recuperating wife, "Yo, Adrian, I did it!" 
</P>
<P>
The stats: Budgeted at $7.6 million, "II" grossed $79.2 million domestically 
and $45 million worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
As for a sequel: Stallone -- who returned to "II" during career woes -- now 
talks hopefully of a trilogy. 
</P>
<P>
ROUND 3: "Rocky III" (1982). 
</P>
<P>
The scenario: Opens with the final minutes of "II." Then . . . after defending 
his title 10 times, Rocky reaps the rewards of celebrity. Meanwhile, 
ominous-looking Clubber Lang (the then-unknown Mr. T, a former 
bodyguard/bouncer) climbs the fight ranks. Though he eventually learns that 
Mick has been protecting him by hand-picking opponents, Rock agrees to a match 
with Lang, who KO's Rocky in round two. More bad news: Rocky's trainer dies. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge: A rematch for Rocky and Lang, with Apollo Creed stepping in as 
Rocky's trainer. 
</P>
<P>
The training regimen: At the gritty L.A. gym where Creed got his start, Rocky 
swims, does the gym routine and runs on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminaries: Racked with self-doubt, Rocky has lost his nerve. Creed dares 
him to get back "the eye of the tiger." (The name of the theme song, by 
Survivor.) Adrian tells him . . . "Win!" 
</P>
<P>
The big fight: It's the unrealistically small (191-pound) Italian Stallion vs. 
the big and powerful (237-pound) Lang. Knocked down twice in round two, Rocky 
eventually makes Lang see birdies in round 15. For this one, Rocky's got a new, 
lean, mean physique, shown off in Creed's borrowed red, white and blue trunks. 
(As the "Rockys" have progressed, the trunks have become smaller, showing off 
more of the sculpted bods. Stallone/Rocky's face has also changed -- due to 
real-life facial surgeries between "II" and "III.") 
</P>
<P>
The stats: Budgeted at $16 million, "III" grossed $123 million domestically, 
$75 million worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
As for a sequel: "I love the character too much to do (another one), and have 
people go away disappointed and say we bled it dry. So this is it," says 
Stallone. 
</P>
<P>
ROUND 4: "Rocky 4" (1985). 
</P>
<P>
The scenario: Opens -- yawn -- with the final moments of "III." Then Apollo 
Creed decides to return to the ring, with Rocky as his trainer, for an 
exhibition match with awesome 6-foot-6 Soviet amateur world champ Ivan Drago 
(Dolph Lundgren). When Drago fatally pulverizes Creed in a brutal match in Las 
Vegas, Rocky sees red. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge: It'll be Rocky vs. Drago -- aka the Siberian Express -- in a 
non-title match held in the Soviet Union on Christmas Day. (The Soviets chose 
the date.) 
</P>
<P>
The training regimen: With Apollo's trainer, Duke (Tony Burton) stepping in as 
his trainer, Rocky and Paulie head for an ice-covered lodge in the tundra, 
where Rocky lifts logs, pulls peasants' carts from snow drifts and runs the 
steppes (and Soviet mountains) as if they were the steps of the art museum. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminaries: How can Rocky win against a virtual fighting machine? (Per 
computer read-outs, Drago is shown punching 1,850 pounds of pressure 
per-square-inch, compared to the average of 700.) As ever, Adrian balks at this 
fight -- but then shows up in the Soviet Union to stand by her man. 
</P>
<P>
The big fight: East meets West as the 261-pound Drago faces Rocky (we didn't 
catch his weight, which was delivered in Russian), as an arena full of Soviets 
and Politburo members -- including a Gorbachev look-alike -- look on. Turning 
point: when Rocky cuts Drago, causing him to bleed. Soon, even members of the 
Politburo are chanting "Rock-eee!" Yes, he wins -- topping his victory with a 
speech about detente. 
</P>
<P>
The stats: Budgeted at $34 million, "IV" grossed $128 million domestically, 
$150 million worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
As for a sequel: "This is it. What am I going to do, have Rocky fight E.T.?" 
says Stallone after "Rocky IV" came out. 
</P>
<P>
Time now for "V."

POOR RATINGS SLOW DOWN CBS' 'WISEGUY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CBS has slowed down production on the drama series "Wiseguy" after poor ratings 
for its first episode of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Executive producer Peter Lance said Thursday that the show had not been 
canceled, but production has been delayed for a week to see if ratings for the 
9 p.m. Saturday show improve. 
</P>
<P>
The third-season series, which returned to the schedule last Saturday night 
with Steven Bauer replacing Ken Wahl in the lead role, finished third in its 
time slot, attracting only 13% of the available viewers, and ranked 78th among 
the week's 93 prime-time programs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's fair to say they (CBS) were dissatisfied with the numbers we got 
the first time out," Lance said, "but also you have to remember it was on 
against the 'Who Killed Laura Palmer' episode of 'Twin Peaks,' which is like 
'Who Shot J.R.?" -- it was certainly the most heavily promoted episode of this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"The networks are sensitive to immediate ratings, especially with mid-season 
programs," he continued. "We're promoting the show heavily; Steven Bauer is 
doing 'The Arsenio Hall Show' on Friday. We'll see how well it does now that 
everyone knows who killed Laura Palmer -- except Agent Cooper." 
</P>
<P>
Lance said eight of the 13 "Wiseguy" episodes ordered by CBS have been 
completed, including a five-episode "arc" featuring Billy Dee Williams.

FOUNDATION GIVES $2.5 MILLION TO ARTISTS' COLONIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Artists' colonies around the nation, including three in Northern California, 
are the latest recipients of the largess of the John D. and Catherine T. 
MacArthur Foundation. In an unusual initiative announced Thursday, the 
Chicago-based foundation awarded a total of more than $2.5 million to 18 
artists' retreats and residences in 10 states. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, MacArthur Foundation president Adele Simmons said, "Although 
these grants are not being made in direct response to the recent controversy 
surrounding arts funding, we feel that our support of these artists' 
communities comes at a time when it is important to reaffirm the essential 
freedom that is necessary for all creative accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
The one-time grants range from $50,000 to $200,000. Recipients include such 
well-known organizations as Capp Street Project in San Francisco and the 
MacDowell Colony in Peterborough, N.H., as well as lower-profile facilities 
such as the Atlantic Center for the Arts in New Smyrna Beach, Fla., and 
Sculpture Space in Utica, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
All three California colonies, which received $150,000 apiece, are in the Bay 
Area. In addition to the Capp Street grant, awards were made to the Djerassi 
Foundation, Woodside, and the Headlands Center for the Arts, Sausalito. 
</P>
<P>
Like the celebrated MacArthur Fellowships, which provide no-strings-attached 
grants to artists so they might follow their individual muses, artists' 
colonies and retreats typically are established to provide living and studio 
spaces in which selected artists can pursue their work unimpeded. The new 
grants are designed to provide those residences with resources for capital 
improvements and expanded programs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the MacArthur Foundation completed a study of the program needs of 
artists' colonies. Based on the results, proposals were requested from 
traditional rural-retreats, from urban studio spaces, and from collaborative 
venues for the performing arts.

Sheriff's deputies and federal drug agents raided a 20-acre estate, discovering 
a sophisticated marijuana-growing operation based at a million-dollar house, 
authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Search warrants were served on the house at 4363 E. Ave. E Thursday night, and 
officials seized about 6,000 plants that had been cultivated with an intricate 
irrigation system, Deputy Roger Hom said.

<P>
Five people were in custody today after a 90-minute, 125-mile pursuit that 
began near the U.S.-Mexican border south of San Diego and ended on the 
outskirts of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The fleeing auto was clocked at speeds of 95 m.p.h. to 125 m.p.h. during most 
of the chase, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries, although the chase caused an accident on Interstate 5 
in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The pursuit began about 4:30 a.m. when an auto reported stolen in Carlsbad, 
north of San Diego, was spotted south of the city by U.S. Border Patrol 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officers took over the pursuit northbound on I-15 in San Diego, and up 
I-805 and I-5 into Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The pursuit ended about 6 a.m. when the auto stopped in the City of Commerce 
and several people jumped out and ran across the freeway. CHP spokeswoman Pam 
Severson said five people were arrested.

INFLATION SLOWS BUT ECONOMISTS SEE IT AS SIGN OF RECESSION

<P>
Consumer inflation slowed slightly in October, and the country's trade deficit 
narrowed, but economists attributed today's seemingly upbeat developments to 
the near-certainty that the nation has slid into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported that the consumer price index rose 0.6% in 
October, better than the 0.8% spurts that hit in August and September as oil 
prices surged after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles area, prices climbed 0.7% in October after rising 1% the 
previous month. For the 12 months ending in October, prices jumped 6.7% -- the 
highest yearlong increase since June, 1982, the government reported. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, prices rose a modest 0.3% last month for products not related to 
energy. Economists said this "core" rate, often seen as a better barometer of 
inflation, probably stayed relatively low because the economic slump is holding 
down prices. 
</P>
<P>
"The sliding economy is preventing the oil and energy shock from causing a 
runaway on inflation," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Co. 
</P>
<P>
Added analyst David Wyss of DRI-McGraw Hill: 
</P>
<P>
"There's some good news on the inflation side, but bad news on the real side, 
which is that the real economy is a mess." 
</P>
<P>
Also today, the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. merchandise trade 
deficit narrowed 3.3% in September, the first improvement since June. But the 
value of petroleum imports was at its highest level in nine years because of 
escalating costs due to the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Imports dropped 2.4% to $41.3 billion despite a huge 28.5% jump in petroleum 
imports. But exports also fell, down 2.2% to $31.8 billion. The deficit is the 
difference between the two. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the Labor Department said Americans' average weekly 
earnings, after adjusting for inflation, plunged 2.1% in October. It was the 
largest decline since a 2.3% drop in April, 1979. The average weekly wage, 
before adjusting for inflation, was $349.85.

Iben Browning has incurred the wrath of geologists and seismologists for 
projecting a 50-50 chance for a major earthquake on the New Madrid Fault zone 
in early December. 
</P>
<P>
He may soon be getting in trouble with economists. 
</P>
<P>
During a presentation Thursday to a St. Louis business group, the New Mexico 
scientist said it appears that conditions are right for the world to fall into 
a depression in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"For climatological reasons, we will reach the bottom of the depression about 
the end of 1992. . . . I expect (it) will be the most severe since 1776, more 
severe than the 1930s," Browning said. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, he said that: 
</P>
<P>
* High tidal forces have affected such things as the size of the wheat crop in 
the Soviet Union and the rise of Nazism before World War II. 
</P>
<P>
* Volcanoes cause acid rain, not coal-burning factories and power plants. 
</P>
<P>
* The temperature of ice in Greenland affects the world economy. 
</P>
<P>
One thing he didn't spend much time talking about was his projection that 
strong tidal forces could touch off a major earthquake in the Midwest about 
Dec. 3. He also had nothing to say about the overwhelming criticism it has 
prompted. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be a waste of time. I'd rather just stick to my work," Browning 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he referred to his projection as a "guesstimate," he said he was 
confident in his reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
Earthquake experts say there's a good chance of another quake in the region 
eventually but have dismissed Browning's theories.

LAWYER FILES FOR DISMISSAL OF NORIEGA CASE; 
</P>
<P>
DRUG WAR: AN ATTORNEY, CITING TAPED PHONE CALLS, SAYS THE DEPOSED PANAMANIAN

<P>
A lawyer for Manuel Noriega, saying it might be one of his last acts in the 
Noriega case, filed a motion today to dismiss the charges against the deposed 
Panamanian dictator, citing in part disputed tapes of Noriega telephone 
conversations with counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Rubino accused the government of a conspiracy to deny Noriega's rights to 
a fair trial and effective legal counsel. 
</P>
<P>
The motion accuses the government of misconduct by taping Noriega's prison 
phone calls with his attorneys. Cable News Network reported last week that it 
had obtained tapes of such calls. 
</P>
<P>
CNN is demanding that the FBI return a box of recordings and papers related to 
the government's taping of Noriega's jailhouse phone calls. The material was 
taken from a hotel room where a CNN reporter stayed. 
</P>
<P>
Both an FBI official and CNN President Tom Johnson said today they didn't know 
if the recordings were audio tapes or videotapes, or if they were the phone 
calls between Noriega and his lawyers that are at the center of a legal battle 
before the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"We just know that there were notes, work papers and tapes" related to CNN's 
coverage of the Noriega story, Johnson said. "But in the process of working in 
an operation like this, you could have all sorts of tapes, including (taped) 
air checks." 
</P>
<P>
The box of material was given to the FBI on Thursday by security guards at the 
hotel. CNN claimed the box was improperly removed from the reporter's room and 
that the FBI obtained it without a warrant. 
</P>
<P>
William Hinshaw, head of the FBI bureau in Atlanta, said today that after a 
Thursday night meeting with CNN officials, he agreed to seal the box and not 
take inventory of its contents until the Justice Department orders him to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's private legal team also was in court today for a hearing on whether 
he should be appointed a government-paid defense attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Rubino had claimed the U.S. government has sabotaged its work by freezing 
Noriega's assets, leaving no money for legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler on Tuesday set a deadline of today for 
Noriega's lawyers and the prosecution to work out a payment plan. Otherwise, he 
said, he will declare Noriega indigent and appoint an attorney on the U.S. 
payroll. 
</P>
<P>
If declared indigent, Noriega would be allowed two attorneys paid a maximum of 
$75 an hour and investigative expenses of a few thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the Justice Department has 30 lawyers on the case and is prepared 
to spend up to $30 million to prosecute Noriega on charges of accepting $4.6 
million in bribes from Colombian cocaine smugglers, Rubino said.

MUBARAK URGES U.S. TO DELAY ATTACK IN GULF

<P>
President Hosni Mubarak said today he has urged the United States to delay 
ordering military action in the Persian Gulf by up to three months to give Iraq 
more time to think about pulling out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
His appeal, reported in Cairo newspapers, came after the Soviet Union's chief 
Middle East envoy called for delaying introduction of a U.N. Security Council 
resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said he asked President Bush "to postpone the military option, which 
the United States favors under an international (U.N.) umbrella . . . and allow 
a chance of two or three months to try to achieve peace." 
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader was also quoted as saying, by newspaper editors who 
accompanied him on diplomatic missions to Libya and Syria, that the Soviet 
Union and China were not opposed to the use of force as a last resort to drive 
Iraq out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has ordered at least 200,000 more troops to reinforce the 230,000 
Americans already sent to the gulf in response to Iraq's Aug. 2 seizure of 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The extra troops, warships and hundreds of tanks are not expected to be in 
place before January. 
</P>
<P>
Egypt has sent at least 20,000 troops to the multinational gulf force, more 
than any other Arab nation. 
</P>
<P>
A prominent Egyptian military strategist close to Mubarak said: "I think by 
January all the pieces will fall into place . . . I think the military option 
will be ready by January." 
</P>
<P>
China and the Soviet Union say they favor an Arab solution to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Both countries have backed U.N. resolutions demanding an unconditional Iraqi 
withdrawal but unlike the three other permanent members of the Security Council 
-- the United States, Britain and France -- they have not sent troops to the 
gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet envoy Alexander Belonogov emerged from talks with Mubarak today and told 
reporters: "Iraqi President Saddam Hussein must be convinced that the situation 
in the gulf is very dangerous and that the time element is not in his favor."

<P>
A cockroach-shaped vehicle built by Swiss university students left the giants 
of the Japanese and U.S. motor industries eating dust when it won the world's 
major solar car race today. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters rang cow bells in bright sunshine as the sleek, pink-and-blue car 
called the Spirit of Biel crossed the finish line among vineyards outside 
Adelaide at the end of the second World Solar Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
It used the energy equivalent of just 1.3 gallons of gasoline to cover the 
1,900 miles of flat, arid outback from the northern city of Darwin. 
</P>
<P>
It made the journey in 49 hours and 15 minutes at an average speed of 40 
m.p.h., just failing to beat the winning time in the inaugural race in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Powered by revolutionary solar cells invented in Australia, the Biel finished 
about 240 miles ahead of its nearest rival -- an entry financed by Japan's 
Honda, which is not expected to finish until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Race officials estimate that Honda spent about $20 million on their bid, about 
10 times that spent by the Swiss. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese motor giants Toyota, Nissan and Mitsubishi along with General Motors 
of the United States all backed cars in the race, which had 36 starters. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought we would win it before we started," driver Paul Balmer said 
after prying himself out of the car's tiny cockpit. "But once the race began, I 
realized we weren't too bad at all. 
</P>
<P>
"In the middle of the race it was very hot and dry, and we burst five tires in 
two days. On the first day we had an electronics failure, but otherwise 
everything went well." 
</P>
<P>
The three-tired Biel is 18 feet long, three feet high and weighs 385 pounds 
empty. 
</P>
<P>
"Now all I want is a shower and we'll probably have a big party tonight," 
Balmer said. Each of the team's four drivers was presented with a watch by the 
Swiss consul in Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
The low-slung car, with a body of reinforced carbon fiber, occasionally touched 
speeds of 65 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Laboratory assistant Balmer was in the team from Ingenieurschule Biel that 
finished third behind General Motors' Sunraycer in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Swiss car was in second place, not far behind Sunraycer, when it collided 
with a conventional car in Alice Springs after failing to give way at a 
crossing.

Millions of Americans have been cheating the government out of billions of 
dollars a year by claiming non-existent children and parents as dependents for 
tax purposes, the Internal Revenue Service said. 
</P>
<P>
The year after Congress required that children 5 or older have Social Security 
numbers, the number of dependent exemptions dropped by 7 million below what had 
been predicted. 
</P>
<P>
That brought in an extra $2.8 billion in taxes in 1987 alone, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Returns filed by 11,627 couples and individuals showed declines of seven or 
more dependents claimed from the previous year. Nearly 67,000 claimed four, 
five or six fewer dependents than before. In most cases, the exaggerated claims 
had been made for several years. 
</P>
<P>
"The decrease is particularly significant because it seems to indicate that a 
20-year trend of increasing numbers of improper dependency exemptions has 
finally been reversed," IRS researcher John A. Szilagyi concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The study indicated that most of the cheating was being done by single 
taxpayers and by married people who filed separate returns. The number of 
dependents claimed by singles dropped 48.3% from 1986 to 1987; claims by 
married people filing separately fell 28%, while the number claimed by couples 
filing joint returns dropped 3.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Returns filed for 1987 claimed 69.7 million dependents; the IRS had anticipated 
76.7 million.

Telephone companies reported normal operations today after bracing for a 
possible disruption of service somewhere in the country by computer "hackers" 
breaking into the phone network. 
</P>
<P>
Non-specific threats had been made to invade the massive computers that control 
the telephone network but not to attack physical facilities, industry sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said the threats apparently were in connection with the sentencing, 
scheduled in Atlanta this afternoon, of three members of a hackers' group 
called the Legion of Doom who had broken into BellSouth Corp. computers. But by 
late morning Eastern time, no problems had been reported. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a normal weekday, and there's been no indication of trouble 
anywhere in the network," said Herb Linnen, a spokesman for American Telephone 
&amp; Telegraph.

The Miami Dolphins placed backup receiver Fred Banks on injured reserve today 
and signed two free agent receivers -- Dennis McKinnon and James Pruitt. 
</P>
<P>
Banks will miss at least four games after fracturing his left foot in practice 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
He is the second receiver to go on injured reserve this week; starter Mark 
Clayton suffered a knee injury in last Sunday's victory over the New York Jets 
and will also be sidelined for at least a month. 
</P>
<P>
Pruitt played with the Dolphins in 1986-88 before signing with the Indianapolis 
Colts as a Plan B free agent. The Colts waived him on Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
McKinnon played with the Chicago Bears from 1983 to 1989. He went to Dallas as 
a Plan B free agent and caught 14 passes for 172 yards this season before the 
Cowboys waived him Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Banks has caught 13 passes for 131 yards this year.

Lakers Coach Mike Dunleavy says his main concern is for the well-being of James 
Worthy following the star forward's arrest Thursday on charges of solicitation 
of prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
"All I know is that James has been a model citizen for the Lakers and has been 
a wonderful person and player for me in my tenure as coach," Dunleavy said. 
</P>
<P>
"My main concern right now is for James Worthy and his mental state." 
</P>
<P>
Several hours after he was arrested at his hotel Thursday, Worthy reported to 
the Lakers' bench in the second quarter of their game with the Houston Rockets 
and finished with 24 points in a 108-103 overtime victory. 
</P>
<P>
"James is a great performer and he told me he wanted to play," Dunleavy said. 
"He did and I think that says a lot for the kind of guy he is." 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of the two Class C misdemeanor charges, Worthy faces up to six 
months in jail and a $1,000 fine. He had to post $500 bond Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy has been the Lakers' second-leading scorer for each of the past five 
years.

Stefan Edberg made sure of ending the year as the top-ranked player in the 
world by beating Pete Sampras, 7-5, 6-4, at the ATP Tour World Championships 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg, of Sweden, advanced to the semifinals of the tournament with the 
victory over the 19-year-old from Rancho Palos Verdes. The Wimbledon champion, 
who took over the No. 1 spot on Aug. 13, broke Sampras once in each set and 
eliminated the American from the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Boris Becker rallied impressively to beat Ivan Lendl, 1-6, 7-6, 6-4, 
and that forced Edberg into a situation in which he had to beat the U.S. Open 
champion Sampras to clinch No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg will play Lendl in the semifinals, while Becker will face Andre Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
The second-ranked Becker, of Germany, appeared on the verge of defeat after 
Lendl rolled through the first set. Becker and Lendl already had clinched 
places in the semifinals, along with Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
Becker, roared on by 9,000 home fans, gained the key break in the ninth game of 
the decisive set. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl netted a volley and was hit by bad luck when a Becker return bounced off 
the netcord high over Lendl as the Czechoslovak charged to the net. 
</P>
<P>
That gave Becker two break points, and he used the first. 
</P>
<P>
Racing to the net to meet a Becker return, Lendl mis-hit the ball, and it went 
high. He was already walking to his chair when Becker slammed the ball into the 
empty court. 
</P>
<P>
A backhand volley that touched the line gave Becker two match points and he 
converted the first by firing his 13th ace. 
</P>
<P>
"I sort of took it as a great practice day, win or lose there was nothing at 
stake for me," Lendl said. "He was serving well and he was volleying better 
than I've seen him in some time." 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, making a record 11th appearance in the year-ending event that he won 
five times when it was known as the Masters, stunned Becker in the first set by 
charging to the net behind almost every serve. 
</P>
<P>
Usually more comfortable at the baseline, Lendl dropped only three points on 
his serve in the first set. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I am trying to become a serve and volley player in the second half of my 
career," Lendl joked after the match. 
</P>
<P>
Becker agreed that it was a good practice day, "but it was a pretty long 
practice day." 
</P>
<P>
"After the first set, I was just trying to win a couple of more games. But I 
started playing better. It was a matter of pride," said Becker, who evened his 
career record against Lendl at 9-9.

Three witnesses say a Rhode Island nightclub bouncer accused of assaulting New 
England Patriot wide receiver Hart Lee Dykes last month never hit him. 
</P>
<P>
Two patrons of the nightclub and the manager testified in District Court 
Thursday at a probation violation hearing for the bouncer, William K. Earley, 
35, of Tiverton. 
</P>
<P>
One of the patrons, Jessica O'Brien, 17, said Dykes was yelling at Earley 
outside Club Shalimar in Providence when someone else knocked Dykes to the 
ground. Her boyfriend, Glen Upchurch, said that Dykes was punched twice and 
kicked but that Earley did not participate in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The manager, Edward Imondi, said Dykes and his teammate, receiver Irving Fryar, 
yelled obscenities at Earley and "would not leave without a fight." 
</P>
<P>
Dykes testified last week that he and Fryar were not looking for trouble and 
that it was Earley who harassed them. Judge Richard Israel continued the 
hearing until Nov. 29.

A Japanese city bidding for the 1998 Winter Olympics has advised schools and 
libraries to destroy materials featuring the "Little Black Sambo" character in 
order to improve the city's international image, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The municipal office in Nagano, central Japan, late last month requested that 
the city's schools and libraries destroy all books, pictures and educational 
tools involving "Little Black Sambo," a story criticized as racist. 
</P>
<P>
Sambo, originally meaning a person who was half Indian and half black, has been 
used as a degrading name for blacks for decades. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important for a better international reputation for Nagano," which is 
bidding to host the 1998 Olympic Games, a municipal official said. 
</P>
<P>
The city maintains everything that carries the word "Sambo" or cartoons of the 
boy should be banned regardless of content. But Nagano's library officials said 
references describing racial problems in the story should not be banned.

Gov. Buddy Roemer says he has resumed talks with the owner of the San Francisco 
Giants about moving to New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Voters in Santa Clara, Calif., recently rejected a bond issue to build a new 
home for the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Team owner Bob Lurie has expressed a desire to leave San Francisco's windy 
Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
"The owner would like to remain in the San Francisco area," Roemer said during 
an impromptu news conference Thursday. "He's still trying to do that. He and I 
have spoken, and if San Francisco doesn't work out, he's interested in New 
Orleans. He's not yet ready to make a commitment." 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco and San Jose also have rejected moves to build a new home for the 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Lurie has said the Giants will play the 1991 season in Candlestick Park, but he 
may have to look elsewhere for a new home after that. 
</P>
<P>
In another baseball development, the head of one of the two groups seeking a 
baseball expansion franchise for the Washington, D.C., area dropped out of the 
bidding today, saying the national economic downturn had hurt his efforts to 
attract investors. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Tracz said he told the National League's expansion committee his Capital 
Region Baseball, Inc., was short of the $250 million needed to put a team in 
Washington's Northern Virginia suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal leaves one group, led by Washington developer John Akridge, 
bidding for one of the two new franchises the National League will award to 
begin play in the 1993 season. 
</P>
<P>
The National League is asking $95 million as an entry fee for the two new 
franchises and Tracz said putting together a baseball organization and building 
a stadium in Northern Virginia put the cost out of reach for his investment 
group.

The Quarter Horse Breeders Classics -- eight stakes races worth more than 
$500,000 -- will highlight Saturday night's 12-race program at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
The main event will be the Grade I $172,000 Breeders Championship Classic which 
will showcase World Champion See Me Do It facing the million-dollar mare Dash 
For Speed and four other rivals. The Classic will be the ninth race on the 
program and will be contested over 440 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Championship Classic could go a long way in determining the 1990 World 
Champion as 1989 champion See Me Do It will face two-time champion Dash For 
Speed. 
</P>
<P>
See Me Do It has won 15 of her 18 lifetime starts and $884,833. The daughter of 
On A High capped a perfect six-for-six season in 1989 by defeating older horses 
in the Grade I Champion Of Champions at Los Alamitos. After her perfect season, 
See Me Do It was voted World Champion Quarter Horse. 
</P>
<P>
Dash For Speed has won 21 of her 28 starts with earnings of $1,094,066. The 
5-year-old daughter of Dash For Cash was awesome in the summer at Los Alamitos, 
winning the Anne Burnett Handicap in a track record performance and returning 
to the winners' circle in the Los Alamitos Championship. 
</P>
<P>
Heisajoy and Jazzin Hi could play spoiler's roles in the Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Heisajoy is fresh from a win in the Inaugural Handicap at Los Alamitos on Oct. 
26, covering 350 yards in a quick 17.57 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Jazzin Hi won the Vessels Maturity this summer and was a fast closing second to 
Dash For Speed in the Los Alamitos Championship. 
</P>
<P>
The six-horse field from the rail out, with jockeys in parentheses: Tee Roy Reb 
(Steve Treasure), Wicked Dash (Luke Myles), See Me Do It (Larry Layton), 
Jazzing Hi (Bruce Pilkenton), Heisajoy (James Lackey), and Dash for Speed (Kip 
Didericksen). All starters will carry 122 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The lineup for the Breeders Classics races is as follows: The $31,000 Grade II 
Sophomore Classic for 3-year-olds at 400 yards will be the fourth race followed 
by the $18,690 Grade III Breeders Classic Freshman at 350 yards. The $30,275 
Pacific Classics Derby at 400 yards will be the sixth race with the Grade I 
$47,580 Breeders Sprint Classic at 350 yards the seventh race. Fillies and 
mares will meet in the $48,720 Breeders Distaff Classic at 400 yards followed 
by the Grade I $172,000 Championship as the ninth race. The Grade I $130,100 
Juvenile at 400 yards will be the 10th race followed by the 870-yard Grade III 
$24,020 Breeders Marathon Classic.

In an abandoned movie theater in Beijing's student district, Vic Trigger, an 
unofficial American ambassador of rock 'n' roll, gives a hands-on demonstration 
of the glories of high-amplification music. 
</P>
<P>
His audience is a colorful collection of Beijing's subculture -- leather-clad 
heavy metallists, spiky haired neo-punks (known as pan-ke in Chinese) and 
guitar-toting loners. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any difference between these people and those I'm working with in 
the U.S.," said Trigger, who came from the Guitar Institute of Technology in 
Hollywood to instruct China's rockers. 
</P>
<P>
"Loud is Beautiful" is the message on Trigger's T-shirt -- despite a faxed 
request from one of his anonymous Chinese hosts for "an older musical expert, 
preferably over 50, who would be able to persuade the Chinese musicians to play 
their music a little softer." 
</P>
<P>
Trigger did not know who this Chinese host was, nor was he overly concerned 
since the entire operation was organized and financed by the U.S. Embassy in 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
The status of the visit, at a time when China's communist authorities decry 
"spiritual garbage" from the West, remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
Trigger was told the Chinese had "given consent by the absence of negation." 
The appropriate visas were granted, and no bureaucratic obstacles were raised. 
</P>
<P>
Sino-U.S. relations have gradually improved following the negotiated release 
earlier this year of dissident Prof. Fang Lizhi, who took refuge in the U.S. 
Embassy after the bloody suppression of the pro-democracy movement in June, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
But cultural exchanges remain few and low-key. 
</P>
<P>
Trigger said he views his visit as a cultural exchange in the spirit of 
glasnost, the Russian word for openness that has a Chinese equivalent rarely 
heard in China these days.

There had been almost no rock concerts in Beijing for months preceding 
Trigger's arrival, as city authorities braced themselves for the Asian Games. 
</P>
<P>
Privately owned bars were obliged to close until mid-October, a week after the 
games ended. A nationwide tour by rock star Cui Jian, ostensibly in aid of the 
games, was cut short in July when party officials became alarmed at the unruly 
behavior of young audiences in Chengdu. 
</P>
<P>
Trigger, a guitar specialist, began his career in the 1960s with a degree in 
music psychology from UC Berkeley. He later moved through a variety of musical 
genres, from classical symphonies to avant garde electronic rock. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to giving rock music lessons in Canton, Beijing and Shanghai, 
Trigger brought along a large selection of music tapes donated by three major 
U.S. record companies, which gave him unlimited access to their libraries. 
</P>
<P>
The tapes were presented to the Conservatory of American Music in Tianjin and 
the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, where they will be available to local 
people for listening and recording -- an act of copyright infringement toward 
which the record companies seem willing to turn a blind eye. 
</P>
<P>
Trigger has great confidence in the future of rock music in China. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a strong desire for the expression for freedom," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, there are considerable problems to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
"Rock is about a group working together with a common goal, but here they can't 
do it," Trigger said. 
</P>
<P>
He bemoaned the difficulties in obtaining equipment and the lack of practice 
facilities, even for Cui Jian, who is one of China's most successful rock 
musicians and has been dubbed China's Bob Dylan. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these obstacles, Trigger is convinced the world will soon be hearing 
more from Beijing's rockers. "There will be world-famous Chinese rock and roll 
groups, but they aren't there yet."

CBS SCALES BACK MEETING FOR AFFILIATES; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: LEAN ECONOMIC TIMES HAVE FORCED THE NETWORKS TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK 
AT THE LAVISH ANNUAL AFFAIRS.

CBS, citing difficult economic times, said today that it is scaling back its 
usually lavish affiliates' convention and is moving it from Los Angeles to New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
Network conventions in past years have been three-day affairs, a mix of 
business, parties where guests include TV stars, and recreational events for 
station executives and their spouses. 
</P>
<P>
NBC said it is reviewing its convention plans but has made no decision yet. ABC 
said its convention will be scaled back somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
Next June's CBS convention will last only 1 1/2 days and will concentrate on 
business, CBS spokesman George Schweitzer said. He said no spouses will be 
invited. 
</P>
<P>
"We've substantially scaled it back and changed the venue," he said. The usual 
convention business, including the screening of new series, will go on but 
"minus the embellishments," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be more of a business meeting than a three-day adventure." 
</P>
<P>
The lean economic times were the main reason for the change, he said. 
"Absolutely. It (the cutback) is saving several million dollars that we don't 
need to spend, money that we can put on the air instead." 
</P>
<P>
ABC will still hold its three-day convention in Los Angeles, and spouses of the 
executives will be invited, ABC spokeswoman Janice Gretemeyr said. But there'll 
be "more stress on business" this time, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at the situation, trying to figure out if there is a better way 
to do things," NBC spokeswoman Betty Hudson said.

Television actress Shelley Fabares says Alzheimer's disease robbed her mother 
of the memory that she preferred suicide to suffering from the mind-killing 
affliction. 
</P>
<P>
Fabares, starring in the "Coach" series, said she learned of her mother's 
preoccupation with the disease after she had to take over her affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"In taking over her papers, I discovered that she'd been making donations to an 
Alzheimer's association for years," Fabares told an interviewer for Redbook 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"Mother once told my sister that if she ever found out she had Alzheimer's, she 
would kill herself," Fabares said. "Fortunately, by the time she was diagnosed, 
she was too far gone to remember what she'd said." 
</P>
<P>
Her mother had to be institutionalized in February, the actress said.
