F. MCCONNELL; EX-INSURANCE CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
F. Britton McConnell, a former state insurance commissioner whose tenure 
involved beginning reduced rates for safe drivers and protection of the state 
workers' compensation programs, died Saturday at his Los Angeles home, his son, 
B. Drew McConnell, said this week. 
</P>
<P>
The former councilman and mayor of Beverly Hills was 94 and was replaced as 
insurance commissioner in 1964 in a policy dispute that McConnell said at the 
time would have diluted the independence of the office. 
</P>
<P>
Born in New Orleans, McConnell came to Los Angeles as a teen-ager in 1910, was 
wounded by German gunfire in France during World War I and spent two years in a 
military hospital. 
</P>
<P>
McConnell attended UC Berkeley Hastings College of Law at San Francisco and 
opened a private practice in San Francisco and Los Angeles. He became a member 
of the Beverly Hills City Council in 1948 and was mayor of that city from 1950 
to 1952. 
</P>
<P>
In 1956 he was named state insurance commissioner by Republican Gov. Goodwin J. 
Knight, succeeding John R. Maloney. A Republican, he was reappointed when 
Democratic Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown succeeded Knight. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving public life, he returned to private practice, retiring only two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
A widower, McConnell is survived by another son, Malcolm, a brother, six 
grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service is scheduled at 2 p.m. Monday at All Saints Episcopal Church 
in Beverly Hills. Contributions are asked to be sent to the American Red Cross.

LOUIS BARRON; MADE MUSIC ELECTRONICALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Louis Barron, an electronic pioneer who created music from circuitry long 
before the evolvement of synthesizers, has died of lung cancer, his wife said 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Barron, who with his first wife fashioned the score for the innovative music in 
the 1956 film "Forbidden Planet," died Nov. 1 in Los Angeles. Mary Ellen Barron 
said her husband was 69. 
</P>
<P>
A largely self-taught engineer and pianist, Barron first combined those 
interests in 1948 when he and his then wife, Bebe, created circuits that 
mechanically altered sound. At the time, he was one of few Americans involved 
in the field. 
</P>
<P>
He later worked with composer John Cage investigating the relationship between 
music and sound and, after a few experimental film scores, was asked with his 
wife to write the music for "Forbidden Planet," a science-fiction film based on 
Shakespeare's "The Tempest." 
</P>
<P>
Louis and Bebe Barron also collaborated on concerts and on such Broadway 
productions as "Visit to a Small Planet," "The Happiest Girl in the World" and 
"The Chinese Wall." 
</P>
<P>
Besides his wife he is survived by two sons.

A COUPLE'S DREAMS END ON A BONITA ROAD; 
</P>
<P>
TRAGEDY: WHILE TOM ROSSI MOURNS THE LOSS OF HIS WIFE, HE IS ALSO ANGRY AT THE 
CHP FOR A MISTAKE THAT MAY ALLOW THE MOTORCYCLIST WHO STRUCK HER TO GO FREE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly two weeks after his wife was killed jogging, Tom Rossi is still 
struggling to understand the bittersweet ironies that led to her death, 
including the final one that left him and their three children with a measure 
of financial security after years of struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Reyes Rossi, 29, died Nov. 5 while jogging along Sweetwater Road in 
Bonita when she was struck head-on by a motorcycle. The motorcyclist, Jerald 
Covey, 29, was uninsured and not licensed to operate a motorcycle, according to 
a California Highway Patrol report and the state Department of Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
When Stephanie, a nurse, left the house that Sunday afternoon, she planned to 
jog before dropping in on a patient and later going to work on a PTA project at 
her children's elementary school. But, according to Rossi, she apparently 
decided to visit the patient first and then take her afternoon jog. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just like her, thinking of the other person first. She decided to see 
the patient first. That choice cost her her life," Rossi said. 
</P>
<P>
It took Rossi more than 12 hours to learn that his wife was dead. Because she 
was carrying no identification, Stephanie was admitted to the morgue as a Jane 
Doe. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until Monday morning, when a concerned Rossi found her car parked 
near Sweetwater Road, that he called police. Rossi, who is unemployed while 
going through computer school, did not know that his wife had purchased a 
$200,000 insurance policy that had gone into effect two weeks earlier, which 
will allow him and the children, ages 3, 6 and 8, to keep their Bonita house. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Rossi managed to touch hundreds of lives through her job as a home 
health nurse and through running, her second passion. People who had known her 
for only a couple of hours were moved enough by her death to send sympathy 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
"They were really taken by her, and that really got to me -- I mean, getting 
cards from people who say they only knew her for a couple of hours but were 
impressed by her," Rossi said. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie's drive made her a success at whatever she tackled. She was making 
plans to go to medical school. And she probably would have succeeded, as she 
had years before as the only girl on the San Diego High School cross-country 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to know the kind of person she was?" Rossi said. "One week after our 
second son was born, she was back at school. She didn't miss any classes during 
her pregnancy. She always pushed herself to the max." 
</P>
<P>
When she died, Stephanie was in training for next month's San Diego Half 
Marathon. According to Rossi, his wife had never jogged on Sweetwater Road 
before the day of her death. 
</P>
<P>
Running came naturally to Stephanie, who was part of an athletic family. After 
high school, she attended McPherson College in Kansas on a track scholarship. 
But, by that time, she and Rossi had become engaged, and she returned to San 
Diego to marry in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"I met her at a high school dance in 1978. I was just out of the Navy, and my 
brother dragged me along. Stephanie walked up to me and asked me to dance. That 
was typical of her. I fell in love with her that night," Rossi said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after their marriage, Rossi dropped out of school to go to work and put 
his wife through nursing school. Eventually, Stephanie became a registered 
nurse, and she was recently working to put her husband through computer 
programming school. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a million plans. After years of struggling, things were finally turning 
around for us. We just added a room to the house. Stephanie was looking forward 
to my finishing school 
</P>
<P>
next year so she could quit working and go to medical school. She wanted to be 
a doctor," Rossi said. 
</P>
<P>
But death shattered those plans, and the CHP's investigation has added to 
Rossi's bitterness. CHP officials have acknowledged that errors were made in 
the investigation, and Rossi said the those errors will probably let his wife's 
killer go free. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-year-old motorcycle involved in the accident was registered to Covey, 
and several witnesses told investigators that Covey admitted running over the 
5-foot, 100-pound woman, officials said. One witness told investigators that 
Covey told him, "I hit that little girl over there," pointing to Stephanie's 
body lying on the side of the road. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy began when CHP Officer Rosemary Manjarrez, a two-year veteran, 
arrested Covey after believing she detected alcohol on his breath. Because 
Covey said he was hurt, Manjarrez then allowed him to be taken to a hospital by 
paramedics, unescorted by police, the CHP said. Manjarrez, believing that Covey 
was injured, did not give him a field sobriety test. Once at the hospital, 
Covey walked out before he could be given a blood-alcohol test. He wasn't 
recaptured until about three hours later. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Capt. Gene E. Towle visited Rossi on Monday to explain that Manjarrez 
"inadvertently made a mistake," Rossi said. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Towle told The Times that Manjarrez "was under a lot of pressure" 
at the accident scene and that the officer made "an inadvertent error." Rossi 
said that Towle told him Manjarrez "was upset so badly by Covey's lack of 
remorse." Covey's only reaction to the accident was "to stand there and smoke a 
cigarette," Rossi said Towle told him. 
</P>
<P>
According to DMV officials, Covey had a clean driving record before the 
accident, but he was not licensed to operate motorcycles. A CHP report report 
indicates that he was not insured. 
</P>
<P>
Citing that report, Rossi noted that Covey and his wife were born six days 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to be 30, and my wife never will. It stinks," he said.

MUSEUM PROJECT PITS ART AGAINST NATURE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Malkin knows trees. The retired landscape architect sees them as art as 
much as nature, living sculptures that provide not only shade and serenity to 
busy urban streets but a certain grace as well. 
</P>
<P>
Since he moved to La Jolla last year, the 56-year-old East Coast native has 
strolled the seaside village, enjoying the exotic palms and other trees that 
lend a leafy canopy to his neighborhood -- especially the four stately 
sycamores standing guard at the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
"They're big trees, so they filter out a lot of the direct sunlight, providing 
a cooling effect on the area," he said. "They are also visually pleasant, 
creating intricate shade patterns on Prospect Street. They are just beautiful 
things to behold." 
</P>
<P>
But Malkin worries that a planned museum expansion might buzz-saw all this 
beauty. Because of its concern that the trees might steal from the profile of 
its building, Malkin says, the museum plans to bulldoze his beloved trees. 
</P>
<P>
In past weeks, the sycamores have ignited a debate in La Jolla over whether 
trees should take precedence over man-made art. 
</P>
<P>
"Artists frequently draw inspiration from nature, so it seems contradictory to 
the creative process to destroy living beauty," Anita Brynolf, an artist and 
design professor at Mesa College, wrote in a letter to a weekly newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not wish my students to witness the destruction of living art for the 
sake of man-made art. Why doesn't LJMCA respect the sycamore trees in the 
context of living sculptural form?" 
</P>
<P>
The plan to replace the sycamores with what Malkin calls "telephone pole-like 
palms" is part of a $14-million expansion that will more than double the 
museum's size over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he contends, museum officials are neglecting the 
multi-trunked, 50-foot-tall trees, three of which have developed anthracnose -- 
a potentially deadly leaf and stem fungus that causes early and continued leaf 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
Malkin calls it "arborcide." 
</P>
<P>
"The museum does not want those trees blocking its view, no matter what," he 
said. "They want to build a huge glass and concrete altar to art that will 
stand out on Prospect Street like some huge billboard. They resent being stuck 
behind a canopy of foliage." 
</P>
<P>
The expansion plans, he said, are a "classic case of too much ambition." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a tree-hugger," Malkin said. "But there must be other ways to go 
rather than sacrifice these trees for art's sake. The sycamores have much more 
expressive beauty to offer the community than any modern art they might hang in 
their museum." 
</P>
<P>
Museum officials say that, although the expansion plans indeed call for the 
removal of the sycamores, they will be replaced with the more adaptable palm 
trees. In the meantime, they say, every effort is being made to treat the 
anthracnose, described as the common cold of trees. 
</P>
<P>
During the summer, Malkin decided to take action. In July, he appealed to Mayor 
Maureen O'Connor about the 40-year-old trees, which were transplanted to the 
museum site during a previous renovation in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
"She got kind of poetic about it," Malkin recalled. "She said 'I love those 
trees' and said she used to admire them a lot on strolls through La Jolla." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, at the mayor's request, city planners went to inspect the 
sycamores. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, city landscape planner Marcela Escobar-Oliver met with museum 
Associate Director Norman Hannay to review horticulture records on the care and 
upkeep of the trees and to make another examination. Her finding: The museum is 
doing nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"They showed me that they had certified arborists on the site as early as July, 
1987, and have taken numerous steps to stem the disease," she said. "The people 
at the museum have been very cooperative about sharing the records of what 
they've done." 
</P>
<P>
Escobar-Oliver said that anthracnose is almost inevitable for sycamores in 
cities like San Diego because moisture from coastal fog becomes trapped in the 
leaf canopy. Often, she said, little can be done to prevent the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"Horticulture experts will say not to even plant them in San Diego," she said, 
"because they're so susceptible to the disease." 
</P>
<P>
Diane Maxwell, a museum spokeswoman, said officials have authorized both spring 
and fall pruning of the trees as well as a regular spraying for the disease. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not willfully neglecting these trees or doing anything to make them 
unhealthy," she said. "But our plans do call for these trees to eventually be 
replaced by palm trees." 
</P>
<P>
The planned expansion, which calls for a restaurant, an artist-in-residence 
apartment and major space for a continuing contemporary art exhibit, is in the 
design and development stage and will not be submitted to the museum's board 
for final approval until early next year, Maxwell said. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the trees do not fit into the architectural style they have chosen 
for the structure, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes time, we will be willing to work with community groups if they 
want to move the trees," Maxwell said. 
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of most La Jollans, Maxwell said, the tree issue is anything but a 
debate between art and nature. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Malkin is a newcomer to La Jolla. It just surprises me that he would make 
such assumptions about what La Jollans think and feel." 
</P>
<P>
Malkin said he plans to circulate several petitions to gauge public support of 
the issue. "People care," he said.

Downtown L.A. -- playground of athletes. 
</P>
<P>
No sooner does the local World Trade Center open a golf driving range than a 
firing range debuts a few blocks to the east. Something new to do on your lunch 
break. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to have a business close to the tourist trade downtown," explained 
Elias Yidonoy Jr., owner of the L.A. Gun Club on East 6th Street. 
</P>
<P>
"We're targeting visiting businessmen, especially from Asia and Mexico who have 
more firearms restrictions in their own countries. I have one customer from 
Mexico City who told me he used to have to pull off the highway when he wanted 
to practice shooting." 
</P>
<P>
Yidonoy, a Korean-American who speaks Spanish, said one of his most popular 
items is a Thompson submachine gun. 
</P>
<P>
"People want to try it because they've seen it in the movies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Customers are welcome to bring their own weapons to the 15-lane indoor range, 
located in a neighborhood where bullets sometimes fly outdoors too. Law 
enforcement officers receive a 50% discount on the $6-per-hour range time. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from offering weapons and ammunition, the club sells knickknacks such as 
bullet key chains and features a VCR in the lobby for waiting gunslingers. On 
Thursday afternoon, the VCR was playing a shoot-'em-up starring Kurt Russell. 
Mood music. 
</P>
<P>
William Cartwright Jr. of West Los Angeles finds it odd that, in a survey 
quoted by The Times' View section Thursday, Gov. George Deukmejian listed one 
of his favorite childhood books as "The Making of the President." 
</P>
<P>
Cartwright points out that the book was published in 1961, when Deukmejian was 
a tyke of 33. 
</P>
<P>
Freeway Spill du Jour: On the Artesia Freeway in Lakewood, a volleyball net. 
</P>
<P>
In case you missed any of the riveting episodes of the weeklong series by KNBC 
(Channel 4) on Bigfoot, the station's crack investigative team failed to find 
the beast, though an alleged Bigfoot hair was found. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe KNBC will be able to find the big guy (or gal) during the next rating 
sweeps period. 
</P>
<P>
The angry garbage hauler who dumped 10 loads of trash in front of City Hall in 
a protest over job conditions calls to mind a similar splash made by an artist 
who dropped two tons of horse manure outside The Times building a few years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Waisler was protesting what he considered an unfair review of his work in 
this paper. "I'm just making my statement," he said, after dumping a steaming 
load from a red rental truck. "I consider this (the manure heap) to be a piece 
of art -- performance art." 
</P>
<P>
When a police officer arrived to ask what happened a few minutes later, someone 
in the crowd shouted: "It belongs to The Times." 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big horse," another person yelled. 
</P>
<P>
"It all comes together in The Times," said a third voice. 
</P>
<P>
The other day, we mentioned that the celebrated L.A. street sign that says, 
"111st St." -- that's One Hundred-Eleven Street Street -- might steal the civic 
redundancy award from "the La Brea Tar Pits, which translates as the Tar Tar 
Pits." 
</P>
<P>
No way, writes Jerry Martz, pointing out that "the La Brea Tar Pits" actually 
translates as "The The Tar Tar Pits." 
</P>
<P>
OK, OK.

BRODERICK INTERVIEWS DESCRIBE ANGER, ANXIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I am madder than hell, and I want to kill him for being lied to and cheated," 
Elisabeth Broderick once said, describing the bitter divorce proceedings with 
her ex-husband, lawyer Daniel T. Broderick III. 
</P>
<P>
And Daniel Broderick, perhaps in his own premonition of events yet to come, 
reflected on the abuse and torment he alleged he suffered from Elisabeth and 
said, "She'd like me to be destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Broderick and his new wife, Linda, are dead, shot while sleeping in 
their Hillcrest home two Sunday mornings ago. 
</P>
<P>
Elisabeth Broderick has pleaded not guilty to murder charges and remains 
without bail at the County Jail at Las Colinas. Locked up and confused, 
Elisabeth Broderick, according to her criminal defense attorney, is unaware of 
the seriousness of the charges filed against her and still believes her 
ex-husband is alive. 
</P>
<P>
Using separate, tape-recorded interviews of Elisabeth and Daniel Broderick 
conducted last year, the Reader, a weekly San Diego newspaper, on Thursday 
published lengthy accounts of how each viewed the divorce case, the 
vengefulness of their ex-spouses, and how they seemed to foreshadow the events 
that purportedly led up to the double slaying Nov. 5 in Daniel Broderick's 
master bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
The Reader published a short article in January about the protracted divorce 
case and the fact that Daniel Broderick had successfully obtained a court order 
sealing the divorce records from public inspection. 
</P>
<P>
But, after Daniel Broderick threatened a lawsuit for invasion of privacy, the 
Reader withheld publishing the interviews with the couple, saying the divorce 
case was not newsworthy at that time. 
</P>
<P>
In the now-published interviews, it is clear that both Elisabeth and Daniel 
Broderick had grown to distrust each other, that Elisabeth was distraught about 
losing custody of their four children, and that Daniel felt he was at his wits' 
end to control his ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Broderick told the Reader that Elisabeth had burned his clothes, damaged 
his home and destroyed some of his personal property -- all in a rage over the 
continuing divorce battle. He said he had her arrested and jailed for violent 
behavior, and once even saw that she was sent to a mental-health facility. 
</P>
<P>
He said her irrational conduct was unsettling his new life with Linda, and was 
equally upsetting to the four children from the first marriage. 
</P>
<P>
"All I want is peace and quiet," he said. "That's all I want." 
</P>
<P>
But that seemed unlikely, he said, because "she's filled with hatred. I left 
her, and she's mad about it. And she cannot let go of it." 
</P>
<P>
Elisabeth Broderick saw things differently. She felt taken advantage of by 
Daniel Broderick's influential legal connections and tossed aside in the 
divorce. She described her settlement with him of more than $16,000 a month as 
not enough to provide her the style of living and social standing she was 
accustomed to from her wealthy upbringing in the New York area. 
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged once ramming her car into Daniel Broderick's front door, and 
said, "I'd do it again, only I'd do it better. I was mad!"

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CURBS ON NIGHT FLIGHTS OPPOSED BY 
PHYSICIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Proposed curbs on nighttime jet flights from Van Nuys Airport would jeopardize 
some organ-transplant programs and cause critically ill patients to die, 
surgeons and organ-transplant program administrators said this week. 
</P>
<P>
Proposals to close the Van Nuys Airport at night, or to lower the allowable 
takeoff noise level, are being considered as part of a $300,000 federal study 
of noise at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
At an airport news conference organized by one of the busiest organ-transport 
services on the West Coast, physicians pleaded with city officials and 
anti-noise groups to forgo further restrictions on nighttime operations.

IN VIDEO, THE NAVY SEES MORE OF CHER THAN IT FORESAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Navy reviewed the story line and the song lyrics to ensure the 
project's good taste before it gave Cher permission to film her video in Long 
Beach aboard the venerable battleship Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the Navy neglected to ask Cher one thing: what she planned to 
wear. 
</P>
<P>
At 2 a.m. on the last day of taping over the Independence Day weekend, the 
actress buzzed up in a motorboat and climbed aboard Mighty Mo wearing a black 
garter belt, black boots, a transparent net body stocking and two posterior 
tattoos the size of pancakes. 
</P>
<P>
Her ensemble touched off a flutter over whether such attire was appropriate for 
a battleship of the Missouri's stature: The Japanese surrendered on its decks 
in 1945 in the presence of Gen. Douglas MacArthur. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy was left with some explaining to do. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew she had tattoos, but I never knew they were so big," Yeoman 2nd Class 
Don Cipriano recently remarked after seeing the video, which is so risque that 
MTV cable channel runs it only late at night. 
</P>
<P>
But the 200 or so Missouri crewmen who stayed up all hours to watch the taping 
enthusiastically approved. One sailor even gave Cher his hat, prompting video 
director Marty Callner to declare in a recent Navy newsletter that he was 
"proud to be an American." 
</P>
<P>
But a handful of critics have since grumbled that the historic battleship was 
demeaned by Cher's costume -- salvaged from censorship by a strategically 
placed V-shaped strip of black cloth -- and choreography, in which she leans 
affectionately against one of the ship's impressive 68-foot guns. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not consider myself to be a prude," a retired Navy commander wrote to the 
Navy after being "arrested" by the video one evening. "I enjoy watching 
scantily clad young ladies as much as the next man. But were I the commanding 
officer or another of the senior people who form a deep personal bond with 
their ship, I would be deeply embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
"She was wearing a see-through body netting that showed her rear end nude," a 
woman from Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., steamed in a letter to Navy headquarters in 
Washington, firing off a carbon copy to President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Navy, a part of our government that should stand for what is good and 
honorable, is putting its stamp of approval on trash like this. . . . What kind 
of image did you hope it would give the Navy?" 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the Navy was hoping to reach MTV's sizable audience of 18- to 
24-year-olds who might be prompted to enlist. However, in a response from Navy 
headquarters written in August and released this week, Lt. Cmdr. A. J. Dooley 
explained that the Navy had expected Cher to wear something more . . . well, 
something more. 
</P>
<P>
"The Navy worked closely with the producer to ensure the video would be in good 
taste," he wrote. "However, changes during the final stages of production, 
including Cher's revealing costume, were unanticipated, and led to overtones 
that we had sought to avoid during our pre-production planning." 
</P>
<P>
There were rumors that Navy brass was offended, but there were no official 
statements of the sort. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, some officers took exception to the criticism, saying the slick video 
gave the impression that the Navy is "a neat place to be." 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the ship looked outstanding," Lt. Cmdr. Steve Chesser in Long Beach 
said of Mighty Mo, which was spit-polished and gloriously lit up against the 
night sky. "I don't think the Navy has anything to apologize for." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Cher nor her publicist could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Chesser said future video requests would be considered on a case-by-case basis, 
and even Cher should not assume she has worn out her Navy welcome. 
</P>
<P>
But one junior officer who asked not to be identified said the "moral outrage" 
that emanated from Washington, however slight, will not be soon forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be a cold day in hell before she ever films another video on a Navy 
ship," he said.

SALK OFFERS TOP JOB TO N.Y. SCIENTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Edwin Darnell, a molecular biologist with a strong administrative 
background, has been offered the presidency of the Salk Institute, acting 
President Renalto Dulbecco said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Final negotiations are going on now" between Darnell, a scientist at 
Rockefeller University in New York City, and officials at the prestigious La 
Jolla biomedical research center, Dulbecco said. "I hope there would be a 
decision within a short period of time." 
</P>
<P>
Darnell, who has been meeting with institute officials and researchers for the 
past week, was the unanimous choice of the institute's faculty, Dulbecco said. 
"He has also met with the search committee and they've been very pleased with 
him," Dulbecco said. The search committee was created by the institute's board 
of directors. 
</P>
<P>
The institute began its search for a new president a year ago, shortly after 
former President Frederic de Hoffmann resigned after 18 years as president. 
Hoffmann died in October after contracting AIDS during a blood transfusion. 
Dulbecco earlier this year agreed to serve as interim president. 
</P>
<P>
The faculty was strongly impressed by Darnell's research and administrative 
credentials, according to Dulbecco. Darnell, 59, "was at the top of the list" 
drafted by the faculty, Dulbecco said. 
</P>
<P>
Darnell once was chairman of Columbia University's department of biological 
sciences. In 1974, he joined Rockefeller University, where he conducts research 
on the molecular structure of cells.

HELPING HOMELESS HELP THEMSELVES; 
</P>
<P>
LANCASTER: THE 40-BED CENTER IS DESIGNED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE GROWING 
HOMELESS POPULATION IN THE HIGH DESERT OPENS SATURDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal and local officials said Thursday that a new Lancaster shelter will 
greatly improve efforts to help the growing homeless population of the high 
desert. 
</P>
<P>
Catholic Charities will operate the 40-bed shelter opening Saturday on 
city-owned land near downtown Lancaster. The city spent about $100,000 on land 
and construction, but individuals and businesses from throughout the Antelope 
Valley donated the bulk of the construction funds, about $350,000 in money, 
labor and materials. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Carlile, executive director of the federal Inter-Agency Council on the 
Homeless, attended a ceremony at the shelter Thursday. The council is chaired 
by Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp and oversees federal 
programs for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Carlile said the shelter embodies the kind of private-public partnerships that 
Kemp and President Bush see as the answer to social problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The solution is at the community level," said Carlile, who was invited by 
state GOP Chairman Frank Visco of Lancaster. "This is very much what the 
President talks about when he talks about a thousand points of light. . . . It 
cannot be done by the federal government alone." 
</P>
<P>
The shelter will offer short-term housing and longer-term, federally funded 
"transitional housing" in which residents will get help finding jobs, education 
and counseling in an attempt to keep them off the street, officials said. 
Thirty of the 40 beds will be devoted to that program. 
</P>
<P>
Social workers said housing for the homeless in the Antelope Valley to date has 
been limited to county-issued vouchers for motels and board-and-care operations 
of uneven quality. 
</P>
<P>
"The city is taking steps to do this before we have a major problem," said 
Susan Aguilar, district director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public 
Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
Homelessness has increased in the valley, county and city social workers said. 
The county department received an average of 105 applications for public aid 
from homeless adults in February and March of this year, compared to a monthly 
average of 77 during the same period in 1987, Aguilar said. 
</P>
<P>
The South Antelope Valley Emergency Services program provided cold-weather 
housing vouchers to 1,700 homeless people in 1988, an increase of 735 over the 
previous year, according to June Hawker, who runs that program. 
</P>
<P>
The high desert's extreme climate shifts and abundance of open space shape the 
local homeless problem, officials said. During hot summer months, some homeless 
people find refuge in the streets of Palmdale and Lancaster, while others camp 
in unpopulated areas. 
</P>
<P>
"They throw a mattress in a field" or live in abandoned cars, Hawker said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the extent of the problem is "half-hidden," said Natalie Ambrose 
of the local United Way chapter. But temperatures often dip below freezing on 
winter nights, making the need for a refuge acute, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Social workers welcomed the emphasis of the new Lancaster shelter on programs 
to make residents self-sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
Hawker said: "It doesn't serve the community at all to give them a few days of 
lodging and then throw them back out on the street." 
</P>
<P>
The annual budget of about $235,000 comes out of a five-year HUD transitional 
housing grant of $117,000 a year, a one-time city grant of $70,361, private 
donations and United Way funds.

TEEN-AGER ON CRIME SPREE SHOOTS TORRANCE MAN, IS SLAIN BY POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles teen-ager was on a three-day crime spree Wednesday when he shot a 
Torrance man in front of a supermarket and then was slain by police following a 
high-speed chase, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis Lee Toney, 18, died of a gunshot fired by a Torrance officer late 
Wednesday in the Willowbrook section of South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Less than an hour before, at 8:20 p.m., Toney had approached Harry Staalberg, 
62, of Torrance in the parking lot of the Pavilions supermarket at Torrance 
Boulevard and Anza Avenue. Toney shot Staalberg once in the stomach in what 
investigators believe was a bungled robbery attempt, police said. Toney then 
drove off with an accomplice. 
</P>
<P>
Staalberg was in critical but stable condition Thursday evening at county 
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The incident is the second violent crime in central Torrance in a week. On Nov. 
8, Pomona pharmacist Stanley Hoe was mortally wounded in a beating and robbery 
at a service station two miles east on Torrance Boulevard. Hoe died Tuesday 
evening at Little Company of Mary Hospital in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the two crimes are not connected and that there is no cause for 
residents to be alarmed, but they noted such violent attacks are unusual in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Bruce Randall, head of the Police Department's Patrol Division, called 
the crimes disturbing, but added, "I don't see there is any alarming trend 
occurring. I don't see it meaning anything dark or gloomy for the city of 
Torrance." 
</P>
<P>
The rate of violent crime is virtually unchanged from recent years, Randall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Staalberg had driven the two blocks from his home on Victor Street to shop when 
he was confronted by Toney, police said. The two had a "brief conversation," 
although police said they have not yet interviewed Staalberg, an apartment 
building manager, to find out what his attacker said. 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, Toney and an accomplice sped east on Torrance Boulevard, 
while witnesses called police. The car was spotted by police near the city's 
Old Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects drove on the wrong side of the road as the chase continued at 
speeds exceeding 100 m.p.h. The getaway car evaded its pursuers by speeding 
through red lights, but it was spotted again in Willowbrook by a Sheriff's 
Department helicopter, said Torrance Police Sgt. Ron Traber. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects ran, and officers found Toney hiding atop a shed in a horse 
stable. Ignoring commands to give up, Toney ran along the top of a wall before 
spinning and crouching as if he was about to fire a gun, Traber said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers reported that they fired six shots at Toney, striking him once in the 
chest. No weapon was found. Toney died several hours later at Martin Luther 
King Jr.-Drew Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Police and deputies cordoned off the neighborhood and searched for several 
hours, but they could not find the accomplice. 
</P>
<P>
Traber said detectives had determined that Toney, not his accomplice, was the 
gunman, but added that he did not know how that was done. 
</P>
<P>
Police linked the pair to crimes on Monday in Los Angeles and Tuesday in Pomona 
because the car used in the Torrance shooting was a Ford Thunderbird stolen at 
gunpoint the day before in Pomona, police said. The suspects approached a 
58-year-old salesman Tuesday morning in Pomona and one held a gun to the man's 
head, Pomona police said. 
</P>
<P>
The two had attempted to steal a car from a 26-year-old woman just eight 
minutes earlier, but they failed when the woman sped off, police said. 
</P>
<P>
And the day before, police said, the same men stole a Subaru in South Los 
Angeles. That car was found abandoned in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the other attacks.

INFANT MORTALITY AND UNWED MOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eberstadt's article certainly was revealing. 
</P>
<P>
Since unplanned and unwanted pregnancies seem to account for high infant death 
rates, what is gained by restricting a woman's right to an abortion? Certainly 
it is insane to try to shut down family planning clinics (as our county 
supervisors are doing), to restrict abortions for low-income women, or to 
prohibit minors from using birth control devices. 
</P>
<P>
If Eberstadt's article proves anything, it proves the need for birth control 
and planned parenthood. We should discourage anyone from having a baby if she 
or he is unwilling to care for the child. Our watchword should be "Responsible 
parents only, please."

INSCRIPTION

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Rights Fight Memories Stirred by Monument," Part A, Nov. 3: 
</P>
<P>
The inscription on the black granite wall of the civil rights memorial in 
Montgomery, Ala., reads: 
</P>
<P>
"Until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream," 
and is attributed on the memorial to Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
This quotation is from the Hebrew Scriptures, Book of Amos, Chapter 5, Verse 
24, written thousands of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps a credit line could be added to the wall to inform the viewing public 
of the actual source of this fine inspirational thought.

INFANT MORTALITY AND UNWED MOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nicholas Eberstadt ("Out of Wedlock and Into Danger," Op-Ed Page, Nov. 3) was 
correct in bringing the issue of the health and welfare of our children to the 
attention of your readers. The statistics on infant mortality are alarming 
indeed. According to the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment, the 
U.S. ranks 17th, well behind most industrialized countries in this regard. 
Children are also the largest single group of Americans who are living in 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
However, his attack on "illegitimacy" is misguided and mean-spirited. While it 
is true that children who are born to single mothers are at risk for a variety 
of deleterious conditions, one is compelled to take issue with placing the 
blame on the "parental behavior" that accompanies single parenthood. Life is 
not as simple as Eberstadt presents it. How can he blame parents while the 
issue of parenthood by choice is being viciously attacked by a powerful 
minority in our country? The attack on sex education and family planning is 
advanced by the same conservative forces of which Eberstadt is a member. How 
can he place the blame on parental attitudes and behavior when the programs 
needed to ensure that all children are cared for are being systematically 
savaged? 
</P>
<P>
Poverty, unemployment and underemployment, lack of opportunity, failure of the 
government to respond to the needs of families, sexism, racism, and 
mean-spirited attacks all contribute to the decimation of family and community 
integrity. Eberstadt ignores or discounts these factors and simply blames the 
victims. If you have any doubt of this thesis, just ask yourself why Eberstadt 
employs the term "illegitimate babies" in his article. Can we seriously believe 
that anyone who thinks that one baby is less legitimate than another merely 
because his parents were not married accepts the American values of equality, 
liberty and justice for all? 
</P>
<P>
The real issue is that we have yet to accept the idea that our youth are our 
greatest national treasures. The larger society must engage in a partnership 
with all families to ensure that they have the tools and resources with which 
to nurture their children. Finally, our society must commit the resources that 
will permit this. Without them, we are responsible for wasting millions of 
lives.

MUSLIM SCARVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article "Muslim Schoolgirl Scarves Banned: France in a Furor" (Part A, Nov. 
7) points up the importance of freedom of religion as enshrined in our Bills of 
Rights. 
</P>
<P>
It seems incredible that three teen-age Muslim girls in France can so arouse a 
whole country over so simple an issue as an article of clothing. Certainly no 
one talks about banning topless bikinis from the French Riviera but somehow 
Muslim girls modestly wearing head scarves to public school is an emotional 
issue. What is at issue, however, is the question of religious freedom. And 
when it comes to Islam, the French schools and the anti-religious intellectuals 
are still fighting the Crusades. 
</P>
<P>
While these independent-minded teen-agers would be heralded as a new group of 
liberated women heroically standing up to a society's status quo if they were 
anything but Muslim, that conviction alone seems to be the reason for their 
expulsion from school. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is not one of an "attempt to convert others to their religion" as the 
school principal ridiculously insists. According to this logic, priests, nuns, 
ministers and others should remove their religious clothes and wearing crosses 
and Jewish stars should be banned, too. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the wife of President Francois Mitterand, the archbishop of Paris 
and a French rabbi, supporting these girls' rights, have sided with light 
against darkness. Bravo for all clear-minded thinkers in a world where 
irrationality too often prevails.

WINE SALES ON SKID ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article by Martin M. Cohen ("Wine: a Drop in the Bucket of Skid Row Woe," 
Op-Ed Page, Nov. 1) is more a symptom of the problem than a realistic view of 
the problems related to cheap wine sales in the downtown Skid Row area. Cohen 
contends that some persons are destined to be miserable on Skid Rows and that 
they should not be deprived of the temporary comfort of a bottle of cheap 
fortified wine. 
</P>
<P>
For every portion of intoxicated comfort achieved with the cheap wines, there 
are many portions of misery. Consumption of cheap wines results in physical 
deterioration, mental anguish and a loss of motivation to improve one's living 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
Gallo and other wineries have reaped enormous profits from the manufacture and 
distribution of the cheap fortified wines to the Skid Row misery market for 
over 30 years. Supervisor Ed Edelman and the County Office of Alcohol Programs 
have now raised the issue with the plan of starting to reduce the growing 
problems within the downtown Skid Row area. The fact that Gallo was embarrassed 
and offered to withdraw the product from Skid Row areas is testimony to its 
awareness of the damage caused. To date no reduction in the Skid Row alcohol 
outlets has been observed. The county plans to conduct a study to determine if 
the cheap wines availability is reduced, and, if so, what the effect is on 
public intoxication and other related problems. 
</P>
<P>
The removal of the cheap wines is not an overall solution to the massive 
political, social and economical problems of Los Angeles downtown Skid Row. 
There will remain a need to develop additional recovery programs and establish 
long-term housing, jobs and support systems. However, reducing the availability 
of the cheap wines is a positive step. Yes, some of those addicted to the cheap 
wines (winos) will move to other areas and others will purchase bootlegged 
bottles. But others, in time, will seek help in the several quality downtown 
recovery programs. The environment for the sales of other drugs will be 
reduced. 
</P>
<P>
Let us hope more citizens become aware of the many problems that exist for the 
lonely and destitute and become willing to initiate change.

MEDI-CAL FRAUD IS CHARGED; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: TWO FIRMS -- ONE OPERATES IN THE VALLEY -- ARE AMONG 20 UNDER 
INVESTIGATION FOR FRAUDULENTLY BILLING MEDI-CAL.

Cracking down on a scam that may cost California's medical program for the poor 
up to $80 million this year, state Justice Department attorneys on Thursday 
charged the owner of a health-care company doing business in the San Fernando 
Valley with filing fraudulent Medi-Cal bills for incontinence supplies for the 
elderly and disabled. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles firm, and another in Oakland against which charges were filed, 
are among 20 under investigation for Medi-Cal fraud. Under the scheme, hustlers 
go door-to-door persuading residents of nursing homes and government-subsidized 
housing complexes -- including a number in the San Fernando Valley -- to hand 
over Medi-Cal stickers they use for health-care services and supplies, said 
Steven V. Adler, the state's chief prosecutor of Medi-Cal fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The stickers are sold, for up to $300 apiece, to unscrupulous firms that 
specialize in incontinence products, Adler said. The companies use the stickers 
to bill Medi-Cal, charging for items never delivered or sharply inflating the 
amounts delivered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the scam has surfaced in counties throughout the state, and that 
Medi-Cal may lose up to two-thirds of its $120-million budget for incontinence 
supplies this fiscal year to fraudulent billings. 
</P>
<P>
Adler said the owner of a Los Angeles incontinence-products firm, Dr. Librada 
V. Del Mundo, was charged with nine felony counts of filing false claims and 
grand theft. Del Mundo filed fraudulent bills totaling $32,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Medi-Cal inspector Dennis Cowan said Del Mundo, a dentist, obtained stickers in 
exchange for performing dental exams and cleaning teeth for residents of board 
and care homes in Studio City, Lake View Terrace and elsewhere in Los Angeles 
County. She used the stickers to bill Medi-Cal for incontinence supplies that 
were rarely delivered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also charged was Ronald J. Norman, owner of American Home Health Care Products, 
an Oakland-based firm that operated throughout California, Adler said. He said 
Norman's firm was suspected of filing $9.1 million worth of fraudulent claims 
in an 18-month period. 
</P>
<P>
Del Mundo and Norman couldn't be reached for comment.

<P>
MURDERS: WHETHER IN SECULAR PURSUITS OR MORE PASTORAL WORK IN EL SALVADOR, THE 
JESUITS SOUGHT TO SERVE THE TRUTH. THIS, APPARENTLY, WAS THEIR 'CRIME.'

<P>
My wife's message was brief: The residence of the Jesuits in San Salvador had 
been bombed by heavily armed men. Six Jesuits, the cook and her daughter 
killed. I stared at the machine -- stunned, outraged, disbelieving. 
</P>
<P>
Disbelief lasted only a few seconds, however. After all, in 1980 I heard 
Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero in his sermon warn soldiers not to kill unarmed 
peasants, even under orders. "No human command is above God's law: 'Thou shalt 
not kill.' " The next day he was shot dead while saying Mass. Father Ignacio 
Ellacuria, one of those killed Thursday, was with Romero that morning nine 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Ellacuria and other Jesuits in El Salvador have been living on borrowed time 
since June, 1977, when a death squad called the White Warriors Union ordered 
all of them to leave the country within a month or be eliminated, one by one. 
This was shortly after two priests had been murdered (one of them a Jesuit 
named Rutilio Grande, as seen in the film "Romero"). The White Warriors Union, 
reputedly directed by Roberto D'Aubuisson, then active in the army's 
intelligence service, denounced "Jesuit guerrillaism." The bizarre 30-day 
countdown drew international media attention to El Salvador. As the 
attention-filled days and nights passed, the Jesuits held their ground. None 
was killed then, although over the next two or three years 10 priests were 
murdered. 
</P>
<P>
What was the Jesuits' "crime"? The landholders, business people and the armed 
forces were blaming the Jesuits for growing militancy among peasants, workers 
and students. The logic seems to be that poor people don't think for 
themselves, so that when they begin to demand their rights, there must be 
"brains" behind them -- intellectuals, church people and especially Jesuits. In 
fact, initial reports from San Salvador indicated that four of the Jesuits were 
found with their brains cut out. 
</P>
<P>
These Jesuits were murdered at their residence in the Central American 
University, a Jesuit school. Catholic universities in Latin America have 
generally devoted themselves to training young professionals. Often these 
schools have higher academic standards than national universities, which are 
under-funded and usually highly politicized. Twenty years ago, under the 
leadership of Ellacuria, the Central American University began to ask itself a 
basic question: What is the role of a Catholic university in a country like El 
Salvador? Their answer was that it should steer its research and training in a 
direction that would address El Salvador's economic, political and social 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
For two decades, the most honest and objective social science research in El 
Salvador has come from the university. It's journal, Estudios Centroamericanos, 
edited by Ellacuria, has carried the best documentation and analysis of events 
in the country. Astonishingly, even in the midst of the civil war, Ignacio 
Martin-Baro carried out opinion polls and Segundo Montes monitored human-rights 
violations and studied the situation of refugees. These priests, whether 
following secular pursuits or a more pastoral work, sought to serve truth and 
God's people, especially the poor. These Jesuits have gone to bed every night 
knowing that they were on numerous permanent death lists. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in April, 1981, Gen. Guillermo Garcia, the minister of defense, 
read on television a list of 138 "traitors." Included were the names of 
Ellacuria and other church people. What probably gave them a measure of 
protection was a calculation that there would be a high political cost to 
murdering people with as many international connections as the Jesuits. 
</P>
<P>
Their murderers apparently blame the Jesuits to some extent for the current 
rebel offensive. It is true that they had insistently pointed out that the 
roots of the crisis in El Salvador are to be found in an unjust economic system 
that enriches a few while keeping the majority in poverty. In that sense, they 
can be seen as sympathetic to the left. 
</P>
<P>
However, they were not simply guerrilla partisans. When I interviewed him in 
1981, Ellacuria criticized particular positions of the guerrillas at that early 
stage of the war. In their publications, the Jesuits insisted over and over 
that the only sane, just and rational course for El Salvador was the 
negotiation process involving all forces -- the government, military and the 
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. 
</P>
<P>
The White Warriors Union -- or a similar group -- has finally gotten its way. 
In 1977, when announcing their decision to remain in El Salvador, the Jesuits 
stated "Christian power is far stronger than a two-edged sword because it is 
based on the teachings of Jesus Christ. It is a power neither money nor guns 
can destroy." They died with that belief and others will continue to live and 
resist in the same spirit.

CENTRAL AMERICA: TELL GORBACHEV TO DIG INTO HIS BAG OF TRICKS AND FORCE HIS 
ALLIES IN OUR HEMISPHERE TO YIELD TO THE NEW REALITIES OF THE '90S.

<P>
We are trapped in a miracle of the satellite TV age. The world is changing so 
rapidly that history seems to be on fast-forward one minute and rewind the 
next. 
</P>
<P>
Fast-forward: Live and in color, we're watching communism evolve itself out of 
existence in Eastern Europe. The Soviet satellites are changing faster than we 
can change channels. 
</P>
<P>
We're seeing hundreds of thousands of people who lived under communism for two 
generations fleeing to places where they can work and speak and save and spend 
in freedom. And we're seeing their iron-fisted rulers benignly step aside, 
admitting the failure of communism's catechism and cause. 
</P>
<P>
Rewind: A newscaster insists it's San Salvador today, but the picture on our 
screen looks more like Tet in the streets of Saigon -- or is it Havana or 
Managua? No matter, it's Communist-backed rebels killing hundreds of innocents, 
one more time, as they try to force on yet another country the system we just 
saw their Marxist bankrollers admitting has failed and fallen two continents 
and one ocean away. 
</P>
<P>
There's no logic to the order of things. It's as if the past can't wait for the 
future to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
We're watching and our President is watching, and none of us seem to have much 
influence over those pictures on the screen. So rapidly is history shifting 
between fast-forward and rewind that we've begun to understand at least this: 
Remote control doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
Changes generated by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev have swept not just 
his nation but our world. In China, the people rose up and were gunned down. In 
Eastern Europe, the people rose up and gained new freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
In the Americas, Gorbachev's disciples look to the future and see only the 
past. Nicaragua's nervous Marxist Daniel Ortega scrapped a truce and went for 
his guns, flinching out of fear that his countrymen would soon draw their 
ballots. El Salvador's leftist rebels, in their own desperation, figure it 
doesn't matter if they win people's hearts and minds, or merely pierce them 
with bullets. 
</P>
<P>
The past that today's Central American communists see as their future is Fidel 
Castro, who came to power under Nikita Khrushchev, became a global crusader 
under Leonid Brezhnev and outlived Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko. 
Castro has given them their weapons -- he's even given Ortega a wardrobe of 
hand-me-downs. 
</P>
<P>
But suddenly, Cuba's master of tirade seems to have acute laryngitis; his 
silence coincides with those satellite pictures from Europe and Moscow that put 
the lie to his decades of words. 
</P>
<P>
There is something that George Bush can do. He can borrow a page from the 
diplomatic playbook of Henry Kissinger and take it to the summit-at-sea. 
</P>
<P>
It's time for "linkage." It's time for Bush to stop looking so painfully 
repressed as he reacts to the good news from the East. It's time for him to let 
Gorbachev know in firm, unmistakable words that there is much the United States 
can do to help the Soviets repair their shattered economy -- and that we would 
like to continue the Bush policy of not seeking to embarrass the Soviets in 
their own back yard. 
</P>
<P>
But the Soviets need to undo the mess they've made of our back yard as well. 
Say it and mean it: We can't cooperate to the fullest as long as military aid 
is being funneled from the Soviet Union and Cuba to Nicaragua and the rebels in 
El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
In Jackson Hole, Wyo., Secretary of State James A. Baker III discussed this at 
some length with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. The Soviets 
clucked sympathetically, proclaimed their willingness to comply, but maintained 
that they were limited in what they could do to stop Castro from shipping 
military aid to Ortega et al. 
</P>
<P>
That's not good enough. It's time to tell Gorbachev that he's got to dig down 
into his bag of geopolitricks and come up with the right stuff -- carrots or 
sticks -- that will force Fidel to yield to the new realities of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets need Western technical assistance for their economy, and their need 
for defense cuts is even more urgent than ours. Eastern Europe needs a new 
Marshall Plan. 
</P>
<P>
Our price must be a hemisphere at peace, here in the West. And while the rest 
of us can only sit and watch satellite pictures on our TV screens, it's time 
for George Bush to speak up.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FLORES SEEKS MERCHANT SHIP BERTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores has asked the Port of Los 
Angeles to reconsider docking the merchant ship Lane Victory at Berth 87, which 
would place the vessel near popular tourist attractions along the San Pedro 
waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to have the port tell its engineers to look at this site and pretend 
that a very prosperous shipping company" has a ship this size, which it wants 
to dock at Berth 87, and see if they can make it work, Flores told port 
officials at a City Council committee meeting Tuesday. "Try and be a little 
creative." 
</P>
<P>
Port spokeswoman Julia Nagano responded in an interview after the meeting: "We 
will evaluate it. And I am sure we will continue to look at other sites as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
A group of merchant marine veterans is trying to convert the 455-foot-long 
vessel into a museum to honor their fallen comrades. They want to dock the ship 
at Berth 87, just north of the Los Angeles Maritime Museum and a statue that 
honors merchant seamen. But port officials say that berth, along the main 
shipping channel, is needed as a cargo terminal.

2 HELD, LINKED TO BOMB MADE FROM STOLEN DYNAMITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies arrested two men Wednesday in connection with the 
construction and planting of a dynamite time bomb found outside an abandoned 
store in El Cajon earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
James Jacobson, 30, a mechanic of San Diego, and George Vanderwall, 26, of 
Santee, were arrested after officials searched their residences, said Sgt. 
Connie Grayson of the Sheriff's Bomb and Arson Squad. They were linked to the 
bomb through fingerprints lifted from the device by the Sheriff's Department, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both men are suspected of possessing and manufacturing a destructive device and 
receiving stolen property, Grayson said. Vanderwall also faces charges of 
possession of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Grayson said the dynamite found Nov. 2 in El Cajon was part of the 800 pounds 
of explosives stolen from the Gordon Carter Construction Co. in Ramona in 
March, 1988. Officials have recovered several hundred pounds of the explosives 
in 17 different incidents since the dynamite was reported missing, he said. 
However, Grayson said a couple of cases of the high-powered dynamite have not 
been found. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the hottest thing in the county right now," he said, adding that a single 
stick of the dynamite, which sells for as much as $200, could easily destroy a 
car and kill all occupants. Investigators would not say whether the pair are 
suspects in the original theft. 
</P>
<P>
Searches of both Jacobson and Vanderwall's residences did not uncover any more 
dynamite, Grayson said. However, Gerald E. Clifton, 43, of the same address as 
Vanderwall, was arrested on suspicion of possessing methamphetamine and 
marijuana, and possessing methamphetamine and marijuana for sale, he said.

<P>
It's 1:40 in the afternoon. Classroom doors simultaneously swing open as if 
operated by an electronic switch. Kids run out, celebrating their freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, another day of school has ended at Oceanside High. 
</P>
<P>
The jocks start heading to the gym. The freaks begin their quest to find a 
place to get stoned. The brains go home to study. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the kid wearing a Raiders sweat shirt and shorts, striding 
down the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
Heads turn. Students whisper. Teachers grimace. Coaches ignore him. 
</P>
<P>
His name is Jerry Garrett. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone at school knows about Jerry. 
</P>
<P>
Every high school coach in San Diego County knows about Jerry. 
</P>
<P>
Every major college football recruiter in the country knows about Jerry. 
</P>
<P>
The Oceanside Unified School District knows about Jerry. 
</P>
<P>
The California Interscholastic Federation and its attorneys know about Jerry. 
</P>
<P>
And, unfortunately, the folks at the San Diego Family Court Services know about 
Jerry, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's go," Jerry says. 
</P>
<P>
He starts to walk across the parking lot, then hears a noise. He stops, turns 
around and sees that football practice is about to begin. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett looks away, hoping that no one notices. He's not about to let anyone on 
the campus know how much he misses playing football. He wouldn't give anyone 
the satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, it's the school's embarrassment, not his, right? They're the ones 
suffering without him. They're the ones who have to keep telling every college 
football recruiter in the country that, sorry, Jerry Garrett isn't playing for 
us anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Oh sure, Oceanside's coaches tell recruiters, they know that Garrett is one of 
the best high school players to come around these parts for quite some time. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, they know that the school's former coach, Roy Scaffidi, is telling 
everyone that, as much talent as USC linebacker Junior Seau possesses, Garrett 
makes him look like a Pop Warner player. Seau played here, too. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, they know that every college football coach in the country lusts for his 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
"But what can you do," Oceanside Principal Brian Sullivan said, "if you can't 
get him to go to class? How can you help him if he's not going to help himself? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame. It's a tragedy, is what it is." 
</P>
<P>
Garrett has not been academically eligible to play sports since November 1988. 
He did not have enough credits to be eligible this fall and, at the last 
grading period in October, he was failing four of his six classes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not dumb, I know that," Garrett said. "I know I can do the work. It's just 
that I don't go to class enough." 
</P>
<P>
"Why?" everyone asks. 
</P>
<P>
"He's such a marvelous athlete, and bright, too," said Joseph Graybeal, 
assistant superintendent of the Oceanside Unified School District. "That's why 
we're all asking why such a great talent like this is going to waste, when he 
could be using it to his advantage and attending the college of his choice." 
</P>
<P>
Garrett is asked this question every day, dozens of times each week. If only 
they knew, he says. If only they realized what he's had to endure in his life, 
then they wouldn't ask why school seems so unimportant at times. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, it's just that I don't have the same enthusiasm for the 
classroom like I do when I'm on the football field," he said. "It's funny, I 
used to love school. But things are different now. My whole life's different. 
</P>
<P>
"It just seems like everything in the world has gone wrong, and some days, I 
don't know, I feel like I can't even deal with it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
If you really want to know what tragedy is all about, step into the life of 
Jerry Dewayne Garrett. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Garrett and Terry Vaughn have been best friends since fifth grade. They 
grew up together. They went to school together. They played sports together. 
They double-dated together. And yes, they dreamed together. 
</P>
<P>
"We always talked about how we were going to win the state championship 
together and go to the same college," Vaughn said. "Everything was coming 
together so well. I remember when we played on the freshman team, we were so 
dominant, teams were actually afraid of us." 
</P>
<P>
They played on the varsity together their sophomore year. Garrett had to wait 
nine games before he could play because he didn't turn 15 until Nov. 5. It was 
worth the wait. The first game in which he was eligible was homecoming against 
El Camino. Scaffidi didn't care. He put him in at quarterback in the second 
series, with the game still scoreless. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett ran for two touchdowns and threw to Vaughn for another. Oceanside won, 
31-0. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way we thought it always would be," Vaughn said. "There was nothing 
to indicate any different." 
</P>
<P>
This year, Vaughn is leading all of San Diego County in rushing with 1,496 
yards, averaging 166 yards a game. He has shoe boxes in his closet, filled with 
recruiting letters. With his athletic skills and 3.2 grade-point average, he 
should have more than 100 colleges and universities to choose from. 
</P>
<P>
"Who would have ever thought it would turn out like this?" said Vaughn, who 
will be under the spotlight at 7:30 tonight when Oceanside (5-4) plays Mission 
Bay (8-2) in the first round of the San Diego Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett said: "Terry and I talk about it all the time, what would happen if we 
were playing together. Nobody could touch us. I think we'd be the best team in 
the country. All our games in the county would be a joke." 
</P>
<P>
It's one thing for a 17-year-old to be making such brash statements, but when 
adults and those in the coaching profession agree with him, you begin to 
wonder. 
</P>
<P>
After all, this is Jerry Garrett you're talking about, a 6-foot 190-pounder who 
always could do anything on an athletic field better than anyone else: 
</P>
<P>
* Football: "He was the greatest athlete I've ever seen," Scaffidi said. "He 
could get an athletic scholarship in football, basketball or baseball, and 
probably make a professional living at any sport he chose. He had great size, 
great speed, great quickness and a tremendous heart. Practically every college 
coach in America was on campus that year -- guys like Terry Donahue, Larry 
Smith, Lavelle Edwards, John Cooper -- and they were all asking about Jerry as 
if he were senior." 
</P>
<P>
* Basketball: "He can play at a low Division 1 school or a high Division 2 
school right now without even improving," said Oceanside Coach Steve Kinder, 
"and that's a modest statement. He's got great quickness and terrific court 
vision. There's no doubt in my mind he can get a four-year scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you how much I think of him, I made him our captain this year, and I 
have no idea if he's even going to be eligible." 
</P>
<P>
* Baseball: "He might be the finest athlete I've ever seen in San Diego 
County," said Oceanside Coach David Barrett. "He's got some rough edges, but 
he's a tremendous center-fielder. I remember once as a freshman he hit a 
450-foot-home run. Four-hundred and fifty feet. Can you believe it? The kid was 
14 years old. I mean, he struck out a lot, but so did Reggie." 
</P>
<P>
* Track: "You know when he ran for us two years ago," Oceanside Coach Terry 
Scaife said, "it was only part-time. But one of the first meets he ever ran for 
us, he ran the 100 meters in 10.8. That's just two-tenths off the school 
record. He long-jumped 22 feet without ever having practiced. He even qualified 
for the CIF preliminaries, but he had a baseball game, so he couldn't make it. 
You're talking about a dynamite athlete here." 
</P>
<P>
Imagine, all in one school year: Garrett was the starting quarterback on the 
varsity football team. He was the starting guard on the basketball team. He was 
the starting center-fielder on the baseball team. He was the fastest kid on the 
track team. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Garrett had barely turned 15 years old. 
</P>
<P>
He was a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
He had the world at his feet. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, there were problems. But every family has them, don't they? Why should 
Jerry and his 17-year-old sister, Angela, have felt any different when they 
heard their parents fighting at night. 
</P>
<P>
But it got worse and worse. Their father, Jerre Garrett, started coming home 
later and later. Some nights, wife Dorothy said, he wouldn't come home at all. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Garrett got so mad at her husband one day in May 1987 that, according 
to court records, she grabbed a vase in the hallway and smashed it against his 
right arm. 
</P>
<P>
Jerre Garrett went to the hospital for stitches. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy and Jerre's relations seemed to improve after the incident. They even 
went on a two-week family vacation in Alabama in July later that year. 
</P>
<P>
But by the time the summer of '87 was over, Jerry and Angela said they feared 
for each of their parents' lives. 
</P>
<P>
Then it happened: the day that still causes Angela nightmares and the day that 
forever changed the Garrett household. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Garrett said in court records that Jerre Garrett had been gone for four 
days when he appeared again Oct. 13 at the family apartment. Dorothy Garrett 
was waiting. She grabbed a knife. Jerry tried to stop her. It was of no use. 
She pushed her son aside and tried to stab her husband. She flung the knife at 
him several times and missed. 
</P>
<P>
Later that day, Angela and her father went to the laundromat. When they 
returned, the anger had only intensified. 
</P>
<P>
Jerre and Dorothy began yelling obscenities at each other, and according to 
court records, Dorothy Garrett threw a bucket of hot water on her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Jerre Garrett pulled out a gun. 
</P>
<P>
He was outside when he saw his wife in the kitchen. He put his finger on the 
trigger and pulled it. He missed. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Garrett telephoned the police, but it was Jerre Garrett who spoke: "My 
wife has gone crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Garrett: "Yes . . . I am crazy. And one of us is going to die while we 
both wait for the police." 
</P>
<P>
Jerre Garrett: "I missed you once, but I won't miss you again." 
</P>
<P>
Two police officers arrived with their guns drawn, ordering Jerre Garrett to 
come out with his hands up. Dorothy Garrett followed. 
</P>
<P>
They each were handcuffed and arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The charge: Attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry arrived home in time to see the police car drive away with his parents in 
the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
The attempted murder charges were dropped, but the time in court was just 
beginning. There were custody hearings. Each parent was prohibited from 
approaching within 100 yards of each other's residence. A holiday schedule for 
the children's visitation rights was drawn. The parents were required to submit 
to random drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
During the custody hearings, Angela was asked that if she could have any three 
wishes, what she would want most. 
</P>
<P>
"That my parents get back together," she said. 
</P>
<P>
They were divorced by the end of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Jerre Garrett was given custody of his son. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Garrett was given custody of her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Angela lives in an apartment with her 15-month-old baby. She had one 
request: "Please don't give my phone number to my mother." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry lives with his father and his father's girlfriend. Jerry, who already had 
three stepbrothers and stepsisters from his dad's previous marriage, will soon 
have two more stepsisters. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really never been the same since the divorce," Angela said. "It's just 
bothered him so much. Sometimes he'll come over to my apartment, and I'll tell 
him he needs to go to school. 
</P>
<P>
"He asks me, 'What for? They won't let me play football anyway.' 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, I don't know what to say." 
</P>
<P>
Garrett's eyes dart across the room. He shifts uncomfortably in the booth. He 
takes a drink and swishes it in his mouth, biding time to collect his emotions. 
</P>
<P>
His eyes begin to mist as he wonders how he can be in such a mess. 
</P>
<P>
How can this polite, well-mannered, 17-year-old, who has never gotten into a 
bit of trouble, cause such a disturbance that many teachers and administrators 
today refuse to publicly discuss him? 
</P>
<P>
How can a kid be responsible for his high school football coach being fired? 
</P>
<P>
How can he be ineligible for all sports now, lagging so far behind now in his 
schoolwork that he doesn't even know if he will graduate. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I get the feeling that teachers don't even want me here," Garrett 
said. "I know the football coach (John Carroll) hates me. There are a lot of 
adults that hate me. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, I guess I don't have anyone to blame but myself. If I went to 
class all the time, none of this mess would have ever started. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's too late now. All I can hope is that this will be a very painful 
lesson, and I'll be better for it. 
</P>
<P>
"It just seems like everything's happened so fast." 
</P>
<P>
When Garrett's personal world began crumbling, his schoolwork followed suit. 
His father had moved out of the district in February of 1988, and just to get 
to school was a burden. If he couldn't get a ride to class, he wasn't going. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he had football. For the first eight weeks of the season, Oceanside 
established itself among the premier teams. They were 6-1, Garrett was 
dominating the playing field, scoring seven touchdowns in seven games and Roy 
Scaffidi had a championship dancing in his head. 
</P>
<P>
Then came results of the first grading period on Oct. 21. Garrett was flunking 
four classes. 
</P>
<P>
Scaffidi figured his starting quarterback would be on probation. No problem, 
Scaffidi said, he'd set up a tutoring program. Heck, he even started driving 
Garrett to school. 
</P>
<P>
Well, there was a problem, said Steve Maddox, Oceanside's athletic director. 
Although he technically was eligible to participate in sports under district 
guidelines, he didn't qualify under CIF rules, which requires passing grades in 
at least four classes. 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, Maddox said, but Garrett would have to sit out the remainder of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Said one Oceanside teacher: "That's when Roy went berserk, absolutely berserk. 
He was going to do everything he could to get his player eligible." 
</P>
<P>
Scaffidi: "There were a lot of bad feelings. The football staff spent several 
hours each week tutoring kids and having study hall for kids. I even picked up 
Jerry and took him to school. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, this was a great kid, a great kid. He just didn't have enough 
discipline to go to class and, unfortunately, there was just no support system 
at home. You don't expect children to make adult decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"I just felt it wasn't right, and I battled with the administration. I battled 
with the counseling office. I battled with everybody. 
</P>
<P>
"But instead of cooperation, I received resentment." 
</P>
<P>
Going nowhere in his fight with the administration, Scaffidi then persuaded 
Jerre Garrett to file legal action against the California Interscholastic 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
"He wrote the letter, and I hand-carried it to the CIF," Jerre Garrett said. 
"It was no use. It seemed like they had it in for Jerry. Scaffidi said there 
were four or five other kids on that (ineligibility) list, but Jerry's the only 
one who was ineligible." 
</P>
<P>
Kendall Webb, commissioner of the CIF San Diego Section, said: "They just had 
no case. He talked about hiring a lawyer, but I tried to discourage him, 
telling him it was an exercise in futility. He just didn't meet the grades." 
</P>
<P>
Even without Garrett, Oceanside was able to advance to the semifinals of the 
San Diego Section playoffs before losing, 45-7, to Rancho Buena Vista. It was 
the second time in Scaffidi's three-year career that the Pirates reached the 
playoffs, raising his overall record to 24-12-2. In the 10 previous seasons 
before Scaffidi's arrival, Oceanside had gone 37-54-2 without a single playoff 
berth. 
</P>
<P>
"Roy was a hell of a coach, and a very, very special person," said Jim Corley, 
who teaches world history at Oceanside and was on Scaffidi's staff. "He was 
very concerned about the kids, and Jerry Garrett was one kid that Roy was very 
concerned about. This kid had a lot of problems, but I think maybe Roy went 
overboard with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, this kid was one of the most phenomenal kids I've ever been in contact 
with. Roy tried everything but hand-feed Jerry to help him. When he became 
ineligible, Roy took it so personally that it ended up to be a vendetta toward 
the school district." 
</P>
<P>
Scaffidi resigned on Dec. 14, just days after the last game of the 1988 season. 
</P>
<P>
And if he had refused to resign? 
</P>
<P>
"I would have been fired," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Scaffidi, now the offensive backfield coach for Whittier College, was asked if 
he would still be coach at Oceanside if Jerry Garrett had never come into his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe for right now I would," he said, "but sooner or later, there would have 
been another Jerry Garrett come down the line. It would have just been a matter 
of time." 
</P>
<P>
Letters from college recruiters pursuing Garrett still trickle into John 
Carroll's football office at Oceanside. Letters from Colorado, letters from 
Oklahoma, letters from Washington, letters from Arizona. Garrett may not have 
played a down of football in a year, but college teams have not forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
"I know they're coming in, because the girls who take the mail to Carroll's 
office tell me about them," Garrett said. "But Coach Carroll, he doesn't want 
me to see them. He says it's not right 'cause I'm not playing." 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, who refused to comment at any length on Garrett but acknowledged that 
he still is receiving the letters, said, "those schools are assuming he's 
playing." 
</P>
<P>
It's too late for football, Garrett knows, but the time has come to help 
himself. He's still hoping to regain his eligibility for the basketball season. 
If he can raise his grade-point average to at least 2.0 and be passing at least 
four of his classes, maybe he can salvage what's left of his high school career 
after all. 
</P>
<P>
But Garrett also realizes that he missed eight days of school in the first 
six-week grading period. If that trend continues, he may not even be able to 
graduate. 
</P>
<P>
Without a high school degree, there is no college. Without college, there are 
no sports. Without sports, well, Garrett doesn't know what he'd do. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just messed up, and now I'm going to have to deal with it," Garrett said. 
"I've let a lot of people down, but mostly myself. It'd be great to go to a big 
school like I always planned, but I'll probably have to go to a juco (junior 
college) first and get my grades up. The SAT (Scholastic Achievement Test) is 
coming up, too, so I know I have to be ready for that. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to think it's not too late for me." 
</P>
<P>
Barrett, his baseball coach, perhaps spoke for everyone at Oceanside when he 
said: "You know, it's tough enough for kids these days to grow up in society, 
but when their parents don't have a grip on things and act irresponsible, the 
obstacle becomes very big. Sometimes, too big. 
</P>
<P>
"As a coach, I'd love to have Jerry Garrett back playing for me. But more than 
anything, I pray Jerry Garrett gets his life together." 
</P>
<P>
Times have been tough for Jerry Garrett. There are nights, he says, that he 
cries himself to sleep. He forever is trying not to reveal his emotions, but on 
this particular day, he was asked if he ever feels sorry for himself. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett lowered his head, swallowed, looked up again, and said: "I feel that 
way every morning I wake up." 
</P>
<P>
Garrett sniffed, rubbed his eyes and looked away.

CLIPPERS HIT SEASON LOW IN LOSS TO ROCKETS; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: SPIRITS LIFTED BY TRADE AND SIGNING EARLIER IN THE DAY ARE LOWERED 
BY COLD SHOOTING THAT PRODUCES 82 POINTS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They came, they saw, they traded, they signed, they lost. Not your ordinary 
Clipper day, except for the ending. 
</P>
<P>
"We seem to have gotten into a pattern," Coach Don Casey said. "We play a great 
game, have a light practice the next day, and then it's like the guys are 
meeting each other for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
Fine and good in the week ahead, but newcomer-to-be Ron Harper and newly-signed 
Benoit Benjamin were nowhere near as the Clippers lost at the Summit for the 
seventh consecutive time, 94-82, to a Houston Rocket team that got 27 points 
from Otis Thorpe and 18 points and 16 rebounds from Akeem Olajuwon. 
</P>
<P>
The 82 points is a season-low for the Clippers (2-4), and betters (worsens?) 
any point total from last season. It was also the fewest points the Rockets 
have allowed since Feb. 21, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Coming off an emotional home win over Denver, the Clippers slipped back into 
their road uniforms and wore them like a suit of armor. They had, after all, 
beaten the Rockets by 14 in the season opener Nov. 3 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
But here? They received scoring from the backcourt -- Gary Grant with 21 points 
and Tom Garrick keeping Harper's spot at shooting guard very warm with 16 
points on six-of-nine shooting -- but nothing else. No one had more than nine 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"They had more confidence at home," Rocket Coach Don Chaney said. "But we also 
helped them out there with turnovers. I thought the biggest thing was we took 
care of the basketball, not so much what they did and did not do." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers trailed only 70-67 entering the fourth quarter, but Houston opened 
the lead to 10 with 5:52 remaining. The Clippers were outscored, 24-15, in the 
final 12 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon, playing with a jammed thumb and forefinger on his left hand that made 
it difficult to catch or grip the ball, had 12 points and seven rebounds in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
When the Benoit Benjamin signing is approved by the league today, the Clippers 
will most likely have to make a cut, unless they discover someone suddenly has 
a previously-unknown injury. . . . More trade fall-out: Reggie Williams returns 
to the Sports Arena Dec. 7, when the Clippers play host to Cleveland, and he 
said Thursday he can already imagine being pumped up a little more than normal. 
"I probably will be," he said. "But I won't go overboard. I'll be excited to 
play in every one with them (Cleveland)." . . . Don Casey's reaction on never 
getting to coach Danny Ferry: "He don't know what he missed."

Cheetah drifted across the finish line in almost no wind but nearly 11 hours 
ahead of the next boat to sweep the line, IOR-A and PHRF-A handicap honors in 
the 13th biennial race from Long Beach to Cabo San Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
The Peterson 66, co-skippered by Phil Murray and Dick Penningston of Long Beach 
Yacht Club, sailed past the cape of Baja California at 10:43 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>

Mitchell Rouse's Taxi Dancer, also of Long Beach Yacht Club, was next at 9:34 
a.m. Thursday. All 14 of the ultra light displacement boats -- or "sleds" -- in 
those two classes had finished by early afternoon Thursday. Taxi Dancer also 
was runner-up in IOR-A. Joss, a MacGregor 65 sailed by Dick and Camille Daniels 
of Long Beach Yacht Club, was runner-up in PHRF-A, more than 13 hours behind 
Cheetah. RICH ROBERTS

THE BOTTOM TEN: THEY SHOULD HAVE ROASTED MASCOT ON A STICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Colleges 
</P>
<P>
The debut of Bows-o the pink, marshmallow-headed mascot of the University 
Hawaii's Rainbows, was such an aesthetic disaster earlier this month that the 
student senate voted to fire him, 28-0. Thus ended Bows-o's one-week stint, 
believed to have been the shortest in NCAA history. 
</P>
<P>
And, now, Chief Illiniwek, the University of Illinois' mascot, is imperiled 
because some groups say his dancing is an insult to American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
The two cases inspired Bottom Ten voters, in their never-ceasing search for 
ineptitude, to set aside their usual duties and rank school symbols, instead. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland's wimpy Terrapin, for instance, had its flipper broken by Virginia's 
temperamental Cavalier during a mascot free-for-all last year. Auburn's War 
Eagle once tried to peck a Florida player, causing Auburn to be penalized 15 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
And who can forget that afternoon in 1983 when Air Force was playing so poorly 
that its live falcon flew the coop, never to return? Or this year, when USC's 
Traveler IV suffered an ankle injury forcing the school to activate young 
Traveler V, who had planned to red-blanket this season. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Ohio State's Brutus Buckeye. No matter how admirable his conduct, 
he's still a man dressed up as a chestnut. 
</P>
<P>
THE MASCOT RANKINGS 
</P>
<P>
Figure, School: Description 
</P>
<P>
1. Bows-o (Hawaii): Book him, Danno! 
</P>
<P>
2. B. Buckeye (Ohio State): Macho chestnut 
</P>
<P>
3. Terrapin (Maryland): Win one for Snapper! 
</P>
<P>
4. Falcon (Air Force): Biding its time 
</P>
<P>
5. Leprechaun (N.D.): Awful green outfit 
</P>
<P>
6. Tree (Stanford): Needs pruning 
</P>
<P>
7. War Eagle (Auburn): Gets too beak-y 
</P>
<P>
8. Illiniwek (Illinois): May be ousted 
</P>
<P>
9. Traveler (USC): Uses stand-in 
</P>
<P>
10. Sun Devil (ASU): Avowed Satanist 
</P>
<P>
HOLTZ RESIGNATION WATCH: He still hasn't had to follow up on his threat to quit 
if Notre Dame's players misbehave -- even though they were penalized 70 yards 
against SMU on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
ROUT OF THE WEEK: USC by 102 points over UCLA. Why? Well, the Bruins lost by 
one to Oregon State, which lost by 38 to Washington State, which lost by five 
to Arizona State, which lost by 20 to Oregon, which lost by one to Stanford, 
which lost by 16 to Arizona, which lost by 21 to USC. That adds up to 102. 
</P>
<P>
GRACIOUSNESS AWARD: After underdog Rutgers missed a late field goal attempt and 
lost, 20-21, West Virginia Coach Don Nehlen said: "There's no way (Rutgers) 
deserved to win. In my opinion, we were the better football team." 
</P>
<P>
The Pros 
</P>
<P>
Attending a Seahawk game is an exercise in following the bouncing ball -- to 
the accompaniment of boos. Slippery fingered Seattle (4-6) leads the NFL with 
29 fumbles. And quarterback Dave Krieg has 13 himself, just four short of the 
NFL record held by past and present Houston Oiler quarterbacks, Dan Pastorini 
and Warren Moon. 
</P>
<P>
It's really a shame that the Seahawks play their home games in the 
climate-controlled Kingdome, instead of an outdoor arena in the East where they 
could build up their bobble stats.

Miami. The Jets had to settle for a field goal after he was stopped by Dolphin 
safety Louis Oliver, who later accused O'Brien of being "afraid to take a hit."

CHASING A CROWN;

<P>
PALOS VERDES GIRL HARRIERS TO GO ALL OUT SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG GONZALEZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Palos Verdes High girls cross-country team did not run its fastest times of 
the year at last week's sweltering CIF Southern Section qualifying meet at Mt. 
San Antonio College. But, as Coach Joe Kelly will tell you, the Sea Kings had 
their burners set on low. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just running to qualify," Kelly said. "Our girls will run considerably 
faster on Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes still ran the fastest team time at the preliminaries. Saturday 
morning, led by sophomores Tami Wilcox and Maya Muneno, the Sea Kings will try 
to win their fifth consecutive 4-A Division championship at Mt. SAC in Walnut. 
No other school has ever won more than three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids work their tail off, they deserve the credit," said Kelly, whose 
girls team has also won two consecutive State Division I championships. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section and L.A. City finals, Saturday at Pierce College, will 
determine representatives for the state championships Nov. 25 in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
The top five teams from each Southern Section division and the top five 
individuals from teams that do not place will qualify for the state meet. The 
top two City Section teams and top five individuals not on those teams will go 
to Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
The only team regarded as a threat to the Palos Verdes girls is Buena of 
Ventura . 
</P>
<P>
"I would have to consider ourselves the favorite," Kelly said. "To beat us, 
(Buena) would have to run very well, and we'd have to be a little off." 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance boys qualified for the 4-A final, led by Israel Pose, who covered 
the hilly three-mile course in 15 minutes, 41 seconds last week, tops in his 
heat. Pose should place in the top five individual finishers. 
</P>
<P>
The Palos Verdes boys have also qualified for the final. Kelly hopes the team 
can place sixth or higher. 
</P>
<P>
In the boys 3-A Division, West Torrance ran the third-fastest qualifying time. 
If the Warriors run well, they could challenge Hart and San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
The Miraleste girls team qualified for the 1-A final. 
</P>
<P>
Carson's Steven Gonzales and Banning's Roman Rendon will once again duel for 
top spot among South Bay runners at the City finals. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales and Rendon each ran 15:32 over three miles to qualify for the final on 
Pierce's flat course. 
</P>
<P>
Carson Coach Bill Mocnik said Gonzales could challenge for the City individual 
championship if he can stay close to the leaders and catch them at the end. The 
Colts' Richard Raya, who placed fifth in last year's City final, could also 
crack the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Mayorga of San Pedro and Ryan Winn of Narbonne ran well in qualifying 
heats.

EL CAMINO HAS AN OUTSIDE SHOT AT NATIONAL GRID CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An almost sure match-up, not official yet, is El Camino and Riverside in the 
Orange County Bowl, formerly the Pony Bowl, on Dec. 2 at Orange Coast College's 
LeBard Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The bowl gives an automatic bid to the winner of the Mission Conference Central 
Division, in this case Riverside (9-0, 8-0), the only undefeated team besides 
El Camino (Northern Division) in the 16-member conference. 
</P>
<P>
The opponent is chosen by a bowl committee. If the Warriors beat Cerritos on 
Saturday, they'll wrap up the season untarnished (10-0), which means an Orange 
County Bowl victory is possibly equivalent to a mythical national championship, 
a title El Camino won in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside, ranked second in the state and third in the nation, has never won 
the title. Unlike El Camino, the Tigers like to keep the ball on the ground. 
Their rushing offense is tops in the conference, and overall they're third (El 
Camino is second) with an average of 401 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Daryl McChristian of Riverside is the league's second-best rusher 
with 1,456 yards on 193 carries for 10 touchdowns. Mt. San Antonio College's 
Leonard Russell is first with an average of 162 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside will end the regular season Saturday against Golden West (4-3, 4-4). 
</P>
<P>
The JC Grid-Wire, which ranks teams nationally, says that the winner of the 
Orange County Bowl won't necessarily be the national champion. A lot depends on 
the outcome of this week's games. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the Mid-American Bowl in Tulsa is the other possibility. It will 
feature Navarro, Tex., the nation's top-ranked team, and Ellsworth, Iowa, which 
is ranked fourth nationally. Both are 9-0. 
</P>
<P>
The JC Grid-Wire predicts that L.A. Southwest (7-1-1, 6-1-1) will play Palomar 
in the Hall of Fame Bowl at Balboa Stadium in San Diego on Dec. 2. Palomar 
heads the weak Southern Division of the Mission Conference with a 5-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
Comet quarterback Scott Barrick leads the conference in passing with 2,747 
yards and 18 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
If the prediction is right, it will be the first time Southwest competes in a 
bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Kristy Loesener looked to a neighbor for the perfect game plan, and if the El 
Camino Warriors' season-opener is an indication, it works. The second-year 
women's basketball coach follows the Cal State Long Beach fast-break attack 
that's tough to keep up with. 
</P>
<P>
She got the idea from Joan Bonvicini, who heads one of the strongest Division I 
women's basketball programs in the nation. Bonvicini has led Long Beach to the 
playoffs in each of her nine years there. 
</P>
<P>
"I've studied her program a lot and I've studied her style a lot," Loesener 
said. "This year we're using it a lot because we're super quick and we have an 
excellent fast break." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday it resulted in a 70-32 trouncing of Glendale, where Loesener coached 
from 1982 to 1984 and led the Vaqueros to their most successful season ever. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino looks strong up front with returning center Cheri Bullet (6-feet) and 
freshman power forward Jill Reid (6-1). Bullet had 16 points and 18 rebounds 
against Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Guards Tammy Booker and Kim Bly make up a speedy backcourt with Lynn Sherman, a 
transfer from Long Beach City College. Bly led the Warriors with 20 points 
against Glendale and Sherman had 16. 
</P>
<P>
"Lynn is a very good all-around player," Loesener said. "She has an excellent 
outside shot and she moves very well." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino will go to Orange County to play in the Golden West tournament this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"Fresno, here we come!" That's a happy tune if you're on a junior college 
cross-country team, and that's what the El Camino women are chanting after 
placing third at the Southern California Regionals last week. 
</P>
<P>
The finish earned the Warriors a trip to Fresno's Woodward Park for Saturday's 
state meet, which features the top five teams in Southern California and the 
top five from Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Conference rival and cross-country powerhouse Mt. San Antonio College placed 
first at the regional meet with 50 points, and Bakersfield was second with 86. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Tracy led El Camino with a fourth place, the best performance in the 
school's history in a regional race. The 36-year-old ran the three-mile Mt. Sac 
course in 18:38, surpassing Chris Hamilton's 18:49 finish last year. 
</P>
<P>
Carla Swaim placed second for El Camino and 14th (19:31) in a field of 115 
while Sharrette Garcia came in 20th (19:50) and Shena Mills 27th (20:04). 
</P>
<P>
"I had a reasonable notion that we would do very well at the end of the season 
because a few of the girls made the transition from training to racing," Coach 
Dean Lofgren said. "This team was underrated all year, and it's good to see it 
coming on strong." 
</P>
<P>
The injury-plagued men's team didn't qualify for the state meet because it 
placed 13th at the regional meet. However, Phil DeMontigny qualified for the 
state championship as an individual. He finished 19th in the four-mile.

AGOURA WINS IN MARATHON TO REACH VOLLEYBALL FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE GLAZE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After four games and 87 minutes, Thursday's Southern Section 3-A Division 
semifinal volleyball match between Agoura High and Rim of the World was even. 
</P>
<P>
So leave it to Agoura to take the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
The third-ranked Chargers, survived to beat Rim of the World, 15-2, 12-15, 
15-8, 3-15, 15-8, advancing into Saturday's 3-A championship match at Marina 
High in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In the final, Agoura will meet La Habra, a 15-4, 15-6, 15-8 winner of Anaheim 
Canyon on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the first of the year for the Fighting Scots (20-1), the Sunkist 
League champion. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a great team," Agoura Coach Alan Segal said. "We've been in a lot of 
tough games. I've got to give it to these kids, they played their guts out all 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Outside hitter Christy Janssen led Agoura's charge, recording 19 kills and two 
service aces. And the Charger senior came through when Agoura needed an extra 
push in the fifth game. 
</P>
<P>
With her team trailing, 8-7, Janssen served four consecutive points -- 
including an ace -- to give the Chargers an 11-8 advantage that kept growing 
until the final point. 
</P>
<P>
But Janssen's heroics Thursday only confirmed what Segal has known all along. 
</P>
<P>
"If she's not the 3-A Player of the Year, there's a problem," he said. "There's 
nobody better than her." 
</P>
<P>
With Agoura (15-3) leading, 12-8, in the final game and junior Shannon 
Carpenter serving on the match's last sideout, Janssen tipped the ball over the 
net and it fell to the floor. Carpenter then launched another serve, but the 
Fighting Scots could not return the ball in three hits. 
</P>
<P>
On match point, Janssen landed a spike between Rim of the World defenders Julie 
Noyes and Katie Ojendyk that sent the Chargers into their second championship 
game in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura, the Frontier League champion, advanced to the 3-A final in 1987 but was 
defeated by San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
Having taken game one, 15-2, the Chargers dropped a spine-tingling second game, 
15-12, after jumping to a 4-0 lead and, later, an 11-7 margin. 
</P>
<P>
However Rim of the World middle hitter Tahlia Wagner served four points in a 
row to tie the score, 11-11, and Ojendyk added two more points to put the game 
out of reach for Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
"We really need to win that second game," Fighting Scots Coach Jill Lawler 
said. "Being down 0-2 would have been disastrous (for Agoura)."

LOYOLA CAGERS RUN OUT OF GAS, BUT COACH THINKS HE'LL GET THEM REVVED UP AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It wasn't the most artistic game and both teams will have sharper performances 
this season, but for thrills and spills, Loyola's 102-91 loss to Nevada Las 
Vegas was a success. 
</P>
<P>
Though Loyola eventually ran out of gas, and UNLV looked beatable in missing 
two of its big men, both coaches saw some positive aspects of the opening round 
match-up in the preseason National Invitation Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola led at the half, 54-52, but Lions Coach Paul Westhead said he already 
saw signs his team's energy was flagging. "We had a little trouble sustaining," 
he said. "We usually need five or six games (to hit peak form). We almost 
pulled it off. We're like a car that's running out of gas. We don't conserve 
energy. We exceed the speed limit. Perhaps at this time (of the season) it's 
not humanly possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little concerned into the second half -- I saw as a group our team was 
tired. The guys did a nice job of hanging on but there were, early on, signs of 
being tired." 
</P>
<P>
The Lions took it to UNLV in the first half, flustering the Rebels with a 
tougher press than expected and running off a 20-2 spurt to build a nine-point 
lead. But just when the Lions had things going their way, a phoned-in bomb 
threat halted play for several minutes while the Thomas and Mack Center was 
checked. 
</P>
<P>
Upon resuming play, Loyola guard Tony Walker lost the in-bounds pass and 
committed a foul trying to steal it back, and UNLV clawed back into the game. 
"I thought (UNLV) was tired," Westhead said. "We shouldn't have had a halftime 
break or a bomb scare break." 
</P>
<P>
UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian said his No. 1-ranked team took the challenge of 
running with the Lions. "The best way to play 'em is don't run with 'em," 
Tarkanian said, "but that's not our style (to back down). We have our pride. We 
figured they want to run, we'll run." 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, with two teams known for their run-and-gun offense facing off, 
defense decided it. Loyola's press hampered the Rebels in the first half. 
UNLV's rarely used zone slowed Loyola in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"We stayed in the zone as long as we could," Tarkanian said. "For about 10 
minutes it really helped us, it gave us a chance to keep our guys out of foul 
trouble." UNLV was playing without starting center David Butler and rugged 
forward Moses Scurry, both academically ineligible but expected to return to 
the team soon. Another center, George Accles, is out with a broken wrist. 
</P>
<P>
"Their press bothered us more than it should. (But) we beat 'em without Accles, 
Scurry and Butler. We're gonna be OK," said Tarkanian. 
</P>
<P>
Westhead got some strong play from forward Per Stumer, who had to cover bullish 
Larry Johnson for much of the game, and from Terrell Lowery, Tom Peabody and 
John O'Connell off the bench. Stumer got 10 rebounds and though Johnson scored 
24 points, he was harassed into committing eight turnovers. Lowery scored 15 
points and hit five of six shots in the first half, and Peabody's intensity was 
one of the keys to Loyola's first-half run. Westhead was also pleased with 
Walker's debut at point guard. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got the whole season left," Westhead said. "We'll bounce out of this in 
a positive way." 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian noted: "I'd hate to play 'em again. I didn't feel good at halftime, 
and I don't feel good now. It was the type of game, after it's over you're 
still afraid they're gonna come at you." 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian made an unusual move after the game, going into Loyola's locker room 
to apologize for several confrontations between UNLV and Loyola players, 
including some loud verbal exchanges beneath the stands after the game. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian shook several Lions players' hands and told them: "You guys played a 
hell of a game. I'm sorry for what happened. I've got a lot of respect for you 
guys. You scared the (bleep) out of me. You still do." 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian's gesture apparently made some friends. The Loyola team applauded as 
he bid them adieu. One yelled, "Win 'em all, coach." 
</P>
<P>
As expected, Loyola Marymount signed two more basketball recruits during the 
early signing period: Ross Richardson, a 6-foot-7 swing man from Flint, Mich., 
and Craig Holt, a 6-3 guard from West Valley Community College in Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson, a senior at Central High, averaged 13.5 points as a junior and is 
projected as a shooting guard because of three-point accuracy. He is also the 
quarterback on Central's football team and a highly considered baseball 
pitcher. He has a 3.96 grade-point average and was sought by Ivy League 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Holt, a sophomore, is a Santa Clara native who averaged 26 points as a senior 
at Aptos High and 14 points last season as a freshman. He is in the honors 
program at West Valley and is considered "by far the best shooter I've ever 
been around" by his coach, 20-year veteran Bob Burton. 
</P>
<P>
College Notes: Loyola junior forward Marcus Slater has a sprained knee ligament 
and will miss two to three weeks. Teammate Chris Scott, a freshman forward, 
broke a bone near his left thumb and will wear a cast for three weeks before 
beginning rehabilitation . . . The Loyola water polo team finished fourth in 
the Western Water Polo Assn. Tournament and closed the season with a 9-13 
record. Tim Waggoner led the Lions with 41 goals and was named to the 
All-Western Water Polo Assn. first team.

EL CAMINO CAN CAPTURE THE MISSION CONFERENCE GRID CROWN ON SATURDAY; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: WARRIORS ARE RATED NO. 1 IN THE STATE. THEY HAVE AN EDGE OVER TOUGH 
CERRITOS WITH LEAGUE'S BEST DEFENSE, SECOND-BEST OFFENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Undefeated El Camino can wrap up the Mission Conference Northern Division title 
with a victory over Cerritos in Saturday's 7 p.m. football game at Murdock 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Both are 3-0 in division play, but El Camino, No. 1 in the state and No. 2 in 
the nation, has an edge with the league's best defense and second-best offense. 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos (6-3-1) is coming off a big win over Mt. San Antonio College. The 
Falcons run a balanced offense that centers around quarterback Sean McConnell 
and running back Victor Matos. McConnell had a great game against Mt. SAC with 
14 pass completions in 22 attempts for 275 yards and three touchdowns. The 
6-foot-3, 190-pound sophomore has completed 139 passes for 1,624 yards and 16 
touchdowns this season. Matos has gained 667 yards on 95 carries for three 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons have Mission Conference losses to Rancho Santiago, Riverside and 
San Diego Mesa, a team El Camino defeated handily last week. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a very good football team," said El Camino Coach John Featherstone. 
"They're good on both sides of the ball, and they're peaking. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question this is the best football team we'll play all year. We're 
very concerned about Cerritos College." 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors hold a 16-game winning streak that will be difficult to break. 
Tough defensive performances and a productive offense have allowed them to 
remain on top with a 9-0 mark. El Camino's offense averages 426 yards a game 
and its defense, fifth in the state, allows only 221 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Frank Dolce had one of his poorest outings last week against Mesa, 
but the sophomore is still second in the Mission Conference in passing with 166 
of 282 attempts for 2,308 yards and 22 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Tenth-ranked L.A. Southwest can tie for first place in the Western State 
Conference Northern Division with a victory over first-place Moorpark (7-1, 
8-1) at 1 p.m. on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
A win will almost assure Southwest of a Bowl bid, first in the school's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
The task, however, won't be easy against the No. 7 Raiders, who shut out 
Ventura 28-0 last week to remain the league's No. 1 club. Southwest's only loss 
was to Ventura, which was upset by Harbor two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"To put it plain and simple," said Southwest Coach Henry Washington, "we're 
going to have to work a lot to win. This is probably the best team we'll play 
this season." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders rank third in the state offensively and defensively. They allow 
opponents only 197 yards of total offense a game. Their offense consists of a 
balanced attack that averages 435 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jayson Merril is fourth in the conference in passing with 98 of 197 
attempts for 1,545 yards and 10 touchdowns. Running back Fred Bradley has 
gained 1,113 yards on 168 carries and has scored 20 touchdowns. 
</P>

The host Cougars (7-1-1, 6-1-1) are enjoying their best season ever thanks to 
tough defensive performances and quarterback Craig Manigo's strong outings. The 
freshman has completed 128 of 214 attempts for 1,603 yards and 19 touchdowns.

DOMINGUEZ STARTS CAGE SEASON AGAINST HAYWARD AND SONOMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

Cal State Dominguez Hills basketball Coach Dave Yanai begins his 13th season 
today with a road trip to Northern California. The Toros will play at Cal State 
Hayward at 7:30 tonight and at Sonoma State at 7:45 p.m. Saturday before 
returning to Carson to play their home opener Tuesday against La Verne. 
Tuesday's game starts at 8:05 as part of a doubleheader with the women's team. 
</P>
<P>
Yanai owns 186 victories, two California Collegiate Athletic Assn. titles and 
three appearances in the NCAA Division II regionals. The Toros are coming off a 
20-10 season and a third-place finish in the regionals and return 
all-conference guard Robert Barksdale as well as lettermen Michael Bell and 
Segaro Bozart, also guards. Junior Mike Rudberg returns at forward after 
sitting out last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros will be relatively small, with only two players taller than 6-foot-5, 
but Yanai will be unveiling one of his best recruiting classes, including guard 
Raymond Bennett and forward Vincent Washington, both from Carson High, forward 
Norman Francis out of Fairfax High and 6-7 center Joseph Janney, a native of 
Accra, Ghana, by way of L.A. Trade Tech.

MASTER PLAN ROUNDING INTO SHAPE FOR MASTER'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
All the literature that The Master's College puts out on its basketball team 
says that Coach Mel Hankinson is in his second year on the job. 
</P>
<P>
We respectfully point out that they stretch the truth. 
</P>
<P>
Hankinson is in his 21st season as a college coach and his third at Master's. 
The fact is, the school has chosen not to tarnish his record by giving him 
credit for his first one at the helm of the Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, after witnessing all of three games, Hankinson decided that his first 
year would be better spent on the recruiting trail, visiting places his lowly 
team would not. 
</P>
<P>
"They were nice fellas," Hankinson said of his '87 Mustangs, "but Adolph Rupp 
could not have helped them." 
</P>
<P>
The school's administration agreed. So, while the team he was hired to coach 
struggled to an 11-19 record, Hankinson became a frequent flier. 
</P>
<P>
He traveled to Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, Alabama, Oregon and Washington 
looking for clean-cut, studious athletes who believed in God and never missed 
an open jump shot -- all with the blessing of John MacArthur, The Master's 
president. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever success we enjoy here is the result of the cooperation of everyone at 
the school," said Hankinson, whose team opens at home tonight against San Jose 
Christian in the first round of the Tip-Off tournament. 
</P>
<P>
By season's end, they may all be celebrating together. 
</P>
<P>
The Master's plan, which envisioned the Mustangs challenging for a National 
Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics District 3 championship sometime in the 
early 1990s, has been accelerated a bit. 
</P>
<P>
Or, as Hankinson brazenly puts it, "By February, if we stay healthy, anyone who 
comes calling on us on a dusty road at high noon had better have all their guns 
loaded." 
</P>
<P>
Big talk from a coach whose team was 15-15 last season, 5-9 in District 3 
games. But it had best be believed. 
</P>
<P>
Master's top scorers and rebounders from a year ago were both freshman. Tom 
Bruner, a 6-foot-6 power forward, averaged 14 points and eight rebounds a game. 
Jason Webster, a 6-5 swingman, averaged 12 points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"The best way to build a strong program is to build a strong foundation of 
freshmen who are solid students, good people and who can play," Hankinson said. 
"Then you fill in the cracks, the weak areas, with transfers and junior college 
transfers." 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs' lineup is Hankinson's game plan in action. 
</P>
<P>
At point guard is Larry Lopez, a 5-10 junior transfer from Hesston (Kan.) 
Junior College. At shooting guard is Jeff Newton, a 6-4 junior who transferred 
from Napa Valley College two years ago. And at center are Dan Jarms, a 6-8 
junior transfer from Eastern Washington, and Ted Hahs, a 6-8 sophomore and a 
member of the prized recruiting class of '88. 
</P>
<P>
"We have good, young players," Hankinson said. "And we have versatility. We can 
put a fast, pressing team out there, or a big, zone team. There are a lot of 
ways this group can hurt you." 
</P>
<P>
One weapon will be disarmed as the season opens. 
</P>
<P>
Damon Greer, last seen in these parts helping Cleveland High to two City 
championship games, will be eligible Dec. 19 after transferring from San Jose 
State. 
</P>
<P>
"He ought to do all right here," Hankinson said, tongue planted firmly in 
cheek. 
</P>
<P>
Greer, a sophomore, might be Master's missing link. "We struggled at point 
guard last season," Hankinson said. "But Damon moves our game up a whole notch 
in tempo. His greatest asset is that he improves everyone else's ability level. 
Instead of self glory, he's most interested in team glory." 
</P>
<P>
However, the Mustangs' most glorious days may still be ahead. Don't expect The 
Master's to beat out the perennial favorites, Westmont and Biola, in the NAIA 
District 3, Hankinson said. At least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't come in and in two years break up that kind of tradition," Hankinson 
said. "We'll be very competitive this year and a top 10 team next year. We're 
cautious only because of our youth."

CSUN'S AUTHORITY FIGURE; 
</P>
<P>
SOCCER: MIDFIELDER TERRY DAVILA GIVES THE PLAYOFF-BOUND MATADORS A HARD-NOSED 
ENFORCER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By his own count, Terry Davila was suspended from school at least three times a 
year from the time he entered fourth grade until he completed his sophomore 
year of high school. 
</P>
<P>
Twice, and almost a third time, he was kicked out of schools. He fought. He was 
rowdy. 
</P>
<P>
But, in his mind, he always was right. 
</P>
<P>
"I hated authority," Davila says. "I thought I was an authority." 
</P>
<P>
Watch Davila play soccer and you see many of the same traits. 
</P>
<P>
Davila is animated, aggressive and so confident that he seems to dribble the 
ball with a swagger. With battle-scarred legs and a soiled uniform, he is easy 
enough to spot. 
</P>
<P>
"Terry is our dirtiest player," Cal State Northridge Coach Marwan Ass'ad says 
with admiration. "Look at him after a game. . . . Look at his shirt, his legs, 
his knees. He gives us all he has to give." 
</P>
<P>
The same holds true off the field, as the energy Davila long struggled to 
control seems finally to be channeled in the proper direction. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a great student in the 11th and 12th grades when I found out I had to 
be," Davila says. "I wanted to go to college and play soccer at Northridge. 
I've always wanted to come here. When I was 15 and I would come and just watch 
the team practice. There were so many great players." 
</P>
<P>
Davila, a sophomore, can be counted among them. As a freshman, he started at 
sweeper for a team that advanced to the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
Division II championship. This season he starts at midfielder and has played a 
key role in the Matadors' advance to Saturday's West regional final against Cal 
State Hayward at North Campus Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, when Northridge clinched its sixth consecutive California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. championship, Davila was involved in the key play. 
</P>
<P>
With CSUN and Bakersfield knotted, 1-1, in a match that would decide the CCAA 
title and the recipient of the conference's automatic playoff berth, Davila 
took a pass at the left side of the 18-yard box, dribbled in, turned his back 
toward the goal to position himself for a pass, and drew a tripping call that 
resulted in a penalty shot that was converted by Don Imamura with 23 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
"That's him," Ass'ad says, recalling the play. "He hits it right before you 
tackle him. He's so quick. Boom, he hits it." 
</P>
<P>
Davila, who has three goals and an assist, has extra incentive to perform well 
during the playoffs. His younger brother, Teddy, a freshman defender, has been 
sidelined because of a broken left leg. 
</P>
<P>
"It really broke my heart when I saw him get hurt," Terry says. "I wanted to 
share our great season with him. Before a game I can still feel his excitement 
and it gets me going that much harder." 
</P>
<P>
Terry also has been battered and bruised at times this season, but he has 
managed to play through it. 
</P>
<P>
Against San Diego State, a highly ranked Division I team, Ass'ad planned to 
rest Davila, who had a severely bruised leg. But Davila, who had been snubbed 
in recruiting by San Diego State, would have none of it. 
</P>
<P>
Says Ass'ad: "Terry says, 'Coach, I'm ready.' I said, 'You're not going to 
play.' " 
</P>
<P>
Not satisfied with his coach's answer, Davila sent a barrage of trainers, 
assistant coaches and teammates to plead his case. 
</P>
<P>
"So I don't start him, but I put him in later and he hurts his toe," Ass'ad 
says. "The next day I pull him aside and say, 'You know, you . . . me off. You 
shouldn't have played.' 
</P>
<P>
"It's great to have a player like that. He's hungry, you know? Aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
Davila credits his father, Tony, CSUN's women's tennis coach, for that 
characteristic. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the one who taught me to go hard," Terry says. "He always said, 'If 
you're going to get hit, hit the other guy harder because then you won't get 
hurt.' " 
</P>
<P>
However, it is Ass'ad who Davila credits with changing his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I respect him totally," Davila says of his coach. "Every decision he's made 
concerning me and our team has been the right one. I listen to Marwan and he 
guides me. 
</P>
<P>
"I just give it all I've got. I respect Northridge, the tradition. That's why I 
try to act the best I can, because I'm wearing the Northridge uniform."

MIRA MESA HOPES IT HAS MT. CARMEL'S NUMBER

Mira Mesa Football Coach Brad Griffith doesn't know the Mt. Carmel player's 
name. Griffith has just seen the films and knows him only as "No. 66." 
</P>
<P>
That's the way it is for several football coaches around the county these days 
as they prepare for the opening round of the San Diego Section playoffs. No 
more league games in which you're familiar with several players from each team. 
Now, you get two films from your opponent and go to work dissecting. 
</P>
<P>
Griffith's Mira Mesa team opens the 3-A playoffs tonight at Mt. Carmel at 7:30. 
The teams haven't played this season, so they're not very familiar with each 
other. But Mt. Carmel, located in Rancho Penasquitos, sits close enough to Mira 
Mesa that there's a rivalry anyway. Mira Mesa and Mt. Carmel scheduled each 
other for non-league games from 1985 through 1988, but that stopped after a 
bench-clearing brawl last season. 
</P>
<P>
During that time, Mira Mesa won three of four, including last year's game, 7-3. 
Mt. Carmel won in 1987, 14-3. 
</P>
<P>
This year's meeting seemingly features two teams going in opposite directions. 
Mira Mesa (7-3) finished the season with two victories after stumbling against 
No. 6 Point Loma (27-23) and No. 4 Morse (21-17). Mt. Carmel (6-4) finished the 
season with losses to No. 1 Rancho Buena Vista (42-7) and Vista (14-0). 
</P>
<P>
What concerns Griffith is Mt. Carmel's defense. Which brings us to No. 66 -- 
Mt. Carmel nose tackle Brian Berry. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a heck of a football player," Griffith said. "And their linebackers fly 
around. They just have some talent. Their defense could shut you out." 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, but their offense could be shut out. Quarterback Matt Miller tore up a 
knee against RBV, and with sophomore Josh Stang starting the next week, Mt. 
Carmel was shut out by Vista. Coach Bill Christopher will give junior Larry 
Lehman his first start at quarterback tonight. Lehman has been Mt. Carmel's 
starting flanker. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be Larry's first start at quarterback, but I think it makes a lot of 
difference that he has started in a varsity game at all," Christopher said. "If 
nothing else, he's taken varsity hits in practice."

APPEAL UPHELD, CLARK ALLOWED TO PLAY BASKETBALL AT CHRISTIAN; 
</P>

HIGH SCHOOLS: A THREE-MEMBER SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF MANAGERS VOTED TO 
WAIVE THE PUBLIC/PRIVATE TRANSFER PENALTY.

Finally, Tony Clark is free to play the game that got him into hot water in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
The six-month case of the ex-Valhalla athlete who just wanted to play 
basketball came to a halt Thursday when Section Commissioner Kendall Webb 
announced that a three-member subcommittee of the Board of Managers upheld the 
appeal by Clark's parents to waive the public/private transfer penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Clark transferred to Christian this year, but because Valhalla Principal Bob 
Avant refused to sign the transfer form, he was banned from competition. The 
case then went to Webb, who refused to rule Clark eligible. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I just want to concentrate on basketball, nothing else, just ball," said 
Clark, who on Nov. 10 announced that he signed to play at Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming into this season, I had college and this on my mind," he said. "I can 
finally get on with things." 
</P>
<P>
No committee members could be reached for comment, but their decision read in 
part: 
</P>
<P>
"Denial of the opportunity to compete would be a penalty placed against Tony 
Clark because of possible improper action of persons other than himself. In 
view of the foregoing, the committee upholds the appeal of Mr. and Mrs. Clark 
and waives the ineligibility at the varsity level." 
</P>
<P>
Webb said he supported the decision by the committee. "The committee did an 
excellent job of studying the issues and arriving at a logical conclusion," he 
said. "It's important we have a review process." 
</P>
<P>
Although Clark's case has received extensive publicity, there have been similar 
cases. In 1981, Ken Johnson, a transfer from Alabama, led La Jolla to the 2-A 
section basketball championship. Webb ruled Ken Johnson ineligible on the basis 
that he was not a hardship case, but the subcommittee overruled him. 
</P>
<P>
Webb said that while he also based this decision on whether Clark was a 
hardship case, the committee had other considerations. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't base it on hardship," Webb said, "They did it on if Tony Clark was 
given the same consideration as other athletes. And they saw he wasn't. They 
couldn't find a substantive reason not to support him." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego is one of the only sections in the state that gives principals the 
option of signing a transfer waiver for players. 
</P>
<P>
"We may want to look at the possibility of removing the public-to-private form 
and going to the state rule that if you want to appeal a transfer waiver, you 
go directly to the commissioner," Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said he was prepared not to play his senior year but that he was relieved 
with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I more or less prepared myself for 'no'," Clark said. "But when I found out it 
was yes, I was all over the place."

BLOCKED SHOT SAVES USD IN 85-84 VICTORY OVER AIA

The University of San Diego won its exhibition basketball game over Athletes in 
Action Thursday, but it didn't come easy. 
</P>
<P>
USD center Dondi Bell blocked Rod Foster's driving layup attempt with 13 
seconds remaining to preserve an 85-84 victory in front of 1,179 in the USD 
Sports Center. 
</P>
<P>
It was USD's second exhibition victory of the season. AIA, which was playing in 
San Diego for the first time since moving to Cincinnati from Rancho Bernardo, 
fell to 2-9. 
</P>
<P>
Using a 28-10 run to begin the second half, USD built a 15-point lead with 8:35 
left. The Toreros were playing very good basketball, and AIA was showing signs 
of having played 11 games in 13 days. 
</P>
<P>
USD was leading by eight with 2:46 left, but AIA scored the next seven points 
to cut it to 82-81 with 1:05 left. After a Wayman Strickland free throw, Foster 
drove the lane attempting to tie the game, but Bell swatted his shot off the 
backboard. The Toreros rebounded and held on. 
</P>
<P>
AIA scored the first five points, led, 13-4, after six minutes and never 
trailed in the first half. USD forced four ties, but each time AIA regained the 
lead immediately. 
</P>
<P>
AIA's Howard Wright, a former standout at Patrick Henry High and Stanford, led 
all scorers with 30 points but fouled out with 51 seconds left. Lorenzo Romar 
added 18 and Foster 16. AIA was without leading scorer Zack Jones (formerly of 
San Diego State), who strained his knee against UCLA Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
USD had five players in double figures and 10 who scored. Craig Cottrell led 
with 14 points. Bell had 13. Kelvin Woods had eight of his 12 points in the 
second half, most of which came at crucial times. 
</P>
<P>
USD begins its regular season a week from today at 7:30 p.m. at home against 
Cal Lutheran. AIA, which plays 21 games in 25 days in November, plays at 
Nebraska tonight.

personnel Thursday night as the Aztecs opened their season with an exhibition 
game against DAS Delft, a national team from Holland. 
</P>
<P>
By halftime of an eventual 52-42 victory at SDSU's Peterson Gym, Brandenburg 
had played 11 of 12 players on his roster. 
</P>
<P>
And the way DAS Delft performed most of the game, Brandenburg probably could 
have called a few students out of the bleachers and still come away with a 
victory. DAS Delft (1-7) went 9:50 without scoring in the second half after 
taking its only lead of the game, 31-30, with 14:30 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU's starting lineup consisted of Michael Best (6-feet-4) and Rodney Jones 
(6-1) at the guards, Neal Steinly (6-11) at center and Vern Thompson (6-6) and 
Shawn Jamison (6-8) at the forwards. 
</P>
<P>
Best, Jones and Steinly are three of just five players returning from last 
year's team. 
</P>
<P>
But it will be a while, Brandenburg said, before he finds some combinations he 
likes. 
</P>
<P>
"At least a couple of weeks," he said. "It's easy for me to say these guys are 
going to start, but there has to be some rationale from the coach's standpoint 
and from the players' standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
Three community college transfers led SDSU in scoring. Jamison (Pratt, Kan., 
Community College), Marty Dow (Northeastern Oklahoma A&amp;M) and guard Arthur 
Massey (Alvin, Tex., Community College) had nine points apiece. Jamison also 
had a team-high 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Best, who averaged 12.5 points a game last season but is coming back from 
surgery to remove two screws from a knee, had nine rebounds but was zero for 
eight from the field and finished with just one point. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU shot just 38% from the field. DAS Delft was even worse -- 35%. 
</P>
<P>
"I could sit here and be negative or super positive, because I saw both ends of 
it," Brandenburg said. 
</P>
<P>
Brandenburg also said that Terrence Hamilton, a 6-foot-6 forward from Patrick 
Henry High School, will red-shirt this season.

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: DISCUSS WEALTH WITH CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My husband, and the father of my children, grew up in 
terrible poverty. He's now a wealthy man, but he never discusses money on the 
grounds that he wants to protect our two children from ever having to worry 
about it the way he did. Our son and daughter are about to become adults and 
they still have no idea of the concept of work. I believe this is important 
even though both will inherit enough to live on. 
</P>
<P>
 -- N.J. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR N.J.: I think teen-agers, and certainly adults, need to know what it is to 
hold a job. When they don't have this experience they're robbed of a source of 
self-esteem that can never come from simply having others present you with 
money, gifts and all the necessities of life. 
</P>
<P>
People don't work only for money. They work because through work they gain a 
sense of competence and of identity. Children need to experience firsthand the 
frustrations, challenges and setbacks that they meet in the work force. If 
they're protected from all of this, the moment life gets rough, they're apt to 
give up or try to buy their way out of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
John Levy of Inherited Wealth Consultants, an organization in San Francisco, 
warns parents to talk about family money and how it was made. If the wealth and 
its eventual transmission to the children is dealt with covertly, he warns that 
children are apt to see it as something dark and shameful and themselves as not 
trusted. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My wife and I are both in our 60s and at our recent physical 
we were told by our family doctor that we'd profit in many ways if we started a 
physical fitness program. What surprised me was that he mentioned this after we 
confessed we were concerned because of our loss of interest in sex. 
</P>
<P>
 -- O.F. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR O.F.: Many people who lose interest in sex in their late 50s and 60s do so 
because they're buying into old stereotypes of aging. They feel they're getting 
old and have been told that older people aren't very interested in sex. This is 
a myth. What happens is that when older people get out of shape, when they let 
their bodies become flabby, they begin to lose self-esteem, which is a vital 
ingredient in sex. If a person feels ugly, he or she is much less apt to want 
to make love. 
</P>
<P>
Regular exercise can improve one's sex life. In a study, Harvard anthropologist 
and sociologist Phillip Whitten and his research associate Elizabeth Whiteside 
found that swimmers who trained about an hour a day, four or five days a week 
were much more sexually active than would normally be expected for people in 
their age bracket.

ISAAC ASIMOV: A STARGAZER'S GUIDE TO THE UNIVERSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Since we'll be putting a large telescope in space, it will have to be able to 
recognize the stars it is viewing. To achieve that, scientists at the Space 
Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore produced, in 1989, the largest star 
map ever made. 
</P>
<P>
Star maps have a long history. The first important one was prepared by the 
ancient Greek astronomer, Hipparchus, about 130 BC. He had spotted a new star 
in the sky (something we call a nova nowadays), and he wanted to make sure that 
other such phenomena would be quickly recognized. To do that, he listed the 850 
brightest stars and gave their positions by dividing the sky into lines of 
latitude and longitude. 
</P>
<P>
About AD 150, another astronomer, Ptolemy, incorporated Hipparchus' data into 
his own book on the subject and added 170 stars. Ptolemy's map was used for 14 
centuries. In the 1580s, however, the Danish astronomer, Tycho Brahe, prepared 
the first modern star map. His map included 788 precisely located stars. 
</P>
<P>
A century later, in 1661, a sharp-eyed German astronomer, Johannes Hevelius, 
prepared a map containing 1,564 stars, one that was even better than Brahe's. 
</P>
<P>
After Hevelius' time, stars were mapped only with the use of the telescope. 
With the telescope it was also possible to see and locate stars too dim for the 
unaided eye to discern. The first telescopic star map of importance was 
prepared by an English astronomer, John Flamsteed. The map was published in 
1725, six years after Flamsteed's death, and it listed 3,000 stars. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1859 and 1862, however, making use of far better telescopes, the German 
astronomer, Friedrich Argelander, prepared a giant map of the stars, 
cataloguing no fewer than 457,848 of them in four large volumes, each star 
carefully listed by latitude and longitude. 
</P>
<P>
Once it became possible to photograph the night sky through large telescopes, 
it was no longer necessary to work out the position of each star while 
observing. By the early 1900s it was possible to map millions of stars. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 map prepared by the Space Telescope Science Institute catalogues the 
position and brightness of 18,829,291 objects. Of these about 15 million are 
stars in our own galaxy. The remaining 3 million to 4 million are other 
galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
Humans with good vision can only see about 6,000 stars unaided by optics. These 
go down to the 6th magnitude in brightness. (The higher the magnitude, the 
dimmer the star). The 1989 map contains all the stars and other objects down to 
the 15th magnitude. But modern telescopes can make out objects to the 21st 
magnitude, so the new star map does not include every visible object by any 
means. 
</P>
<P>
One would think that no flaws could be found with such a enormous and accurate 
star map, but the fact is that all stars move. They are plunging along huge 
orbits that carry them about the center of the galaxy, some in fairly circular 
orbits and some in elongated elliptical orbits. 
</P>
<P>
The motions are very slow, but they represent shifts in position that, while 
tiny, will certainly throw off the Space Telescope. In only five years, 
astronomers estimate, fully 10% of the stars will have shifted position 
sufficiently for the Space Telescope not to be able to recognize them. 
</P>
<P>
What astronomers are now doing, therefore, is calculating these apparent 
motions so that they can incorporate that information in the star map.

STARLIGHT THINKS ABOUT CHANGING ITS TUNE; 
</P>
<P>
MUSICALS: THE DECLINE IN NEW BROADWAY PRODUCTIONS IS PROMPTING MANY THEATERS, 
THE STARLIGHT INCLUDED, TO PONDER THE RISK, AND COST, OF PRODUCING ORIGINAL 
WORKS.

<TEXT>
<P>
It's fitting that Starlight Musical Theatre chose "La Cage Aux Folles" as its 
last production of the current season. 
</P>
<P>
The 1983 Broadway hit, about a young man brought up by a loving gay couple, is 
the song-filled story about a crisis of identity (not with the couple, but with 
the man who dreads the sight of his "mother" cross-dressing when his fiancee's 
parents come calling). 
</P>
<P>
It's a crisis of identity, albeit of a different sort, that propels Starlight 
toward its 45th season. 
</P>
<P>
The questions it confronts are these: 
</P>
<P>
Will Starlight continue to be a house of revivals? 
</P>
<P>
Will it continue to scout Broadway for new shows even as a dwindling number of 
them open on Broadway, and only a fraction of those receive enough acclaim to 
even last? 
</P>
<P>
Or will Starlight pursue the goals iterated by its 70 fellow members of the 
National Alliance of Musical Theatres, a group which resolved to devote itself 
to the development of new musicals, with the hope that those shows will 
eventually go to Broadway? 
</P>
<P>
Can Starlight and other musical theaters make that move without losing what 
made them viable in the past -- giving subscribers the old-fashioned, familiar, 
warm musical that they've always liked and that many still seem to want? 
</P>
<P>
The questions became pointed when "A Change in the Heir," a new fairy-tale 
musical by a new composing team (Daniel Sticco, music and George Gorham, 
lyrics), was proposed for the 
</P>
<P>
1990 schedule by executive producer Harris Goldman. It was tentatively booked 
in the Spreckels Theatre and then dropped before the new season was announced. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel McSweeney, executive vice president of the 31-member board of trustees, 
said he opposed "A Change in the Heir" because the funding was not yet in place 
for a new work. In 1990, Starlight will present four musicals new to the 
company: "Follies," Starlight's first attempt at a Sondheim musical, "Jesus 
Christ Superstar," "Me and My Girl" and "Singin' in the Rain." (The fifth, 
"Carousel," will mark the fourth time the painted ponies will be going up and 
down for Starlight.) 
</P>
<P>
The 1991 season will be soon enough for a world premiere at Starlight, 
McSweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a question of timing. We have to be very careful, because we don't have 
the funding sources that would support something like that. That's why 'A 
Change in the Heir' was controversial. It was such a new thought (introducing a 
new play) that many people on the board were afraid. But that's not to say that 
next year we wouldn't do something just like that." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the elimination of the project, which now may go directly to New York, 
exacerbated conflicts that had been brewing all year. The principal players 
were Goldman, who was brought into the organization because of his commitment 
to new works; co-artistic directors Don and Bonnie Ward, equally committed but 
with different tastes and management styles, and the board. Some blame the 
problems on the tensions of being in the transitional state in which Starlight 
now finds itself. 
</P>
<P>
No one will be surprised if the two years remaining on Goldman's contract are 
bought out within the month. 
</P>
<P>
"Starlight is pretty much in the mainstream of musical theater companies in 
this country," said Jim Thesing, president of the National Alliance, who just 
returned to New York after a trip to San Diego to see Starlight and other local 
theaters. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these companies have relied very heavily on what you would call the 
traditional repertory, but how many times can you do the old standards?" 
Thesing asked. 
</P>
<P>
The National Alliance was founded in 1986 because musical theaters across the 
country recognized they had two common problems: The cost of producing quality 
musicals was rising and the pool of new work was shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
Non-musical regional theaters have been addressing those problems over the past 
decade by relying more heavily on fund-raising and by commissioning or 
producing new work themselves. 
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, besides their presentation of new musicals, the Old 
Globe Theatre sent "The Cocktail Hour" and "Rumors" to New York and the La 
Jolla Playhouse sent "A Walk in the Woods" and "Dangerous Games." 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us feel there is a real opportunity right now to create a regional 
theater movement for new musicals just like the wonderful regional theater 
movement for new plays," Thesing said. "I think San Diego is one of the best 
places in this country for this type of thing happening. And I think the 
necessity for Starlight to do it is a little more keen because of the other 
institutions here doing this work." 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, Thesing said eight new musicals were presented by National 
Alliance members. Last year, there were 25 new productions. Two shows, "The 
Unsinkable Molly Brown" and "Grover's Corners" (the latter a musical version of 
Thornton Wilder's "Our Town"), were co-productions by various National Alliance 
theaters which shared the expense of orchestration, costumes and sets among the 
co-producing theaters. 
</P>
<P>
"The Unsinkable Molly Brown," co-produced by the Long Beach Civic Light Opera 
and Theatre Under the Stars in Houston, is booked for a tour of regional 
theaters through June of 1990 and "Grover's Corners," co-produced by the 
Sacramento Music Circus, the North Shore Music Theatre in Boston and Casa 
Manana Musicals in Ft. Worth, Tex., will open next summer at North Shore and 
then go to the other theaters. 
</P>
<P>
In October, the National Alliance played host to its first Festival of First 
Stage Musicals, a dozen readings in New York, with the hope that some theater 
representatives would see something they could use for their upcoming seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Goodspeed Opera House in Connecticut, for instance, picked up "The Real 
Life Story of Johnny BeFacto," a story of a rock musician whose career is 
boosted by an attempted assassination on his life. 
</P>
<P>
Another festival offering is under consideration by Starlight, to be 
co-produced with other member theaters, but neither Thesing nor the Wards will 
name it, explaining that negotiations are at "a delicate stage." 
</P>
<P>
No one wants to get anyone's expectations up about a project that may not come 
to pass. Working out contractual details for a new work can be as tricky as a 
marriage. The project has to fit the stages, styles and tastes of the 
cooperating companies, and the Wards have seen other projects slip through the 
company's fingers when one of the co-producing companies dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
Still, with the commitment of both the artistic directors and the board to new 
work, the Wards are convinced that a world premiere in a Starlight season is 
just a matter of time. 
</P>
<P>
And that couldn't please the Wards more. The two, co-artistic directors since 
1982, grew up with Starlight as performers, playing opposite each other in 
"Carousel" in 1952. Bonnie Ward's father, Robert H. Baker, performed in 
Starlight's "The Mikado" 40 years ago. And some of the Wards' children, who 
began their theatrical careers as Munchkins in a Starlight production of "The 
Wizard of Oz," continue to return to the Starlight stage; Kirby Ward starred in 
"My One and Only" earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We desperately love musical theater," said Bonnie Ward. "And Don and I have 
known for a long time that Starlight hasn't begun reaching its potential. But I 
feel we are just hitting our stride. We are moving in the direction we want to 
move, and we're excited. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no musical theater product coming out of the Broadway arena, and the 
regional theaters must take the initiative to get new productions to Broadway. 
It's terribly risky financially, but someone has got to do it or there won't be 
any 'Sound of Musics' in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Board president Marshall Lucas concurs. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to save the American musical," he said. "It's been my vision for a 
long time to see Starlight grow. I want to have a West Coast premiere, I want 
to have a world premiere, but it takes time. We need to make changes, but I 
don't want to make abrupt changes. We have to do it with style and with timing 
and respect." 
</P>
<P>
Lucas' vision includes a six-play season, with three shows indoors as part of a 
winter season (possibly in the Lyceum) that stresses more serious work (like 
"Threepenny Opera") and three lighter choices outdoors in the Starlight Bowl. 
The board is planning to work funding for a new work in 1991 into the coming 
budgetary plans. 
</P>
<P>
But a key question is whether Starlight will raise the money it needs in the 
months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Starlight's 44th season was an unprecedented box office success, 
grossing $40,000 more than the projected $400,000 per show, the company has 
still not raised the 15% of the $2.5 million budget that it needs to end the 
season in the black. 
</P>
<P>
"Expansion costs money," Goldman said. "We still have not met our fund-raising 
goals for this year. Depending on where we are by Dec. 31, we may or may not 
break even. At this point we are close." 
</P>
<P>
Even if Starlight meets its fund-raising goals this year, the larger issue is 
that if Starlight has difficulty raising the 15% of unearned income it needed 
in this year's budget, what will the company do when it needs an even greater 
percentage of unearned income to put in the coffers for new works? 
</P>
<P>
New works have many hidden costs -- new orchestrations, new costumes, new sets 
and more rehearsal time for the inevitable revisions. In addition, there is no 
built-in audience for unknown works by unfamiliar composers as there is for a 
"Carousel." 
</P>
<P>
Starlight's case is not unusual, Thesing said. Companies like the Goodspeed and 
the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey, both of which regularly initiate new 
work (Goodspeed premiered "Man of La Mancha," "Shenandoah" and "Annie"), may be 
heavily supported by local patrons and state and national funding, but they are 
the exceptions rather than the rule. 
</P>
<P>
Philanthropists don't tend to give to musical theater companies, said Thesing, 
because "There is a kind of a stigma attached to musical theater. Musical 
theater is traditionally thought of as Broadway, and, since Broadway hits make 
a pile of money, people think musical theater makes a pile of money." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, said Thesing, even full houses don't enable theaters to meet their 
expenses any more. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Starlight executives said the company will be unveiling a new 
fund-raising campaign in the next few months. Recently, they held a 
fund-raising party targeted to audiences in their 30s -- quite a bit younger 
than the usual Starlight crowd. They are also trying to ease their audiences 
both into accepting works that Starlight has not done before and into an indoor 
season to complement the outdoor one in the Starlight Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The Starlight Bowl itself is a historical cause of dissension in the 
organization because it is in the flight path of Lindbergh Field. In 1967, when 
attendance at Starlight, dipped from a high of 4,000 a night in the '50s to 
early '60s, when the theater was called Ford Bowl, to under 2,000 a night, the 
Starlight management team blamed its problems on the airplanes and made a 
series of moves -- from the San Diego Civic Theatre to San Diego Zoo's 
Wedgeforth Bowl (where they swapped airplane noise for screaming peacocks and 
barking seals) to San Diego State University. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance dropped to a low of 500 before Starlight limped back to the 
Starlight Bowl in 1974, where the attendance has been climbing to stabilize at 
about 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
Still the air traffic increases each year, reaching a high of 45 a night this 
season alone. To compensate, Starlight uses a series of freezes in which 
traffic lights direct the actors to stop suddenly and simultaneously when a 
plane is coming. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no limit to what Starlight can become except in our own minds," said 
Don Ward. "But we have to find a new venue. We can't survive with the 
airplanes. But we also have to respect an audience that loves the park." 
</P>
<P>
That leaves the organization looking for not only a new indoor theater -- where 
new work can be produced without the distraction of the planes -- but a new 
outdoor stage because, eventually, with the ever-increasing air traffic, even 
the cleverness of the freeze-frame system may wear thin. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, San Diego audiences will not be the only ones watching to see 
what Starlight pulls out of its hat in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
New productions benefit all musical theaters said Philip Wm. McKinley, musical 
theater project coordinator at the Paper Mill, a company that also narrowly 
passed on "A Change in the Heir" this year. 
</P>
<P>
McKinley, who just put the finishing touches on a new cowboy musical called 
"Rhythm Ranch" for the Paper Mill, said new work from new sources would be as 
welcome as water in a desert. 
</P>
<P>
"Any involvement that any musical theater has in the production of new works is 
only going to benefit everyone," McKinley said.

Walt Disney Co., bolstered by the success of its movie theme park in Florida, 
announced Thursday that it will open a similar attraction in 1996 next to its 
planned Euro Disneyland park in France. Disney MGM Studios-Europe will include 
full-scale movie and television production. The theme park will feature 
re-creations of Hollywood and Sunset boulevards in Los Angeles and show how 
earthquakes, explosions and flash floods are filmed. The Disney MGM Studios 
Theme Park at Orlando, Fla., has been attracting capacity crowds since it 
opened in May. Disney announced plans in August to double the size of the 
$500-million attraction. ALEENE MacMINN

Gary Cooper's Gals: The daughter of Gary Cooper says that the one life 
experience that eluded her screen-idol father totally "was being turned down by 
a woman." In an article to be published Sunday in Parade magazine, Maria Cooper 
Janis talks about her father's appeal to women, and says "he often had to do 
the turning down, and we would sometimes even joke about it. One social 
Cleopatra circled around him for weeks in the South of France, barely 
tolerating my mother's presence. Finally she found her moment. She swept over 
to him on the steps of the Hotel du Paris in Monte Carlo and sank down at his 
feet. Looking up at him, she pleaded, 'Oh, Gareee! I must have turned my ankle! 
Would you please carry me upstairs?' Without missing a beat, my father looked 
down and said, 'Gee, I'm so sorry, but I've got a bad back! I'll tell you what: 
You stay here and I'll get the concierge to carry you.' And, with that, he 
proceeded up the steps." Cooper, who made 98 films, died in 1961 at age 60.

BLUTH'S 'ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN' IS BLAND FAMILY FARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

I've always loved the idea of feature-length animated movies more than I've 
loved the movies themselves. Although there are many notable exceptions, 
animation seems to work best in the short form; few feature-length animated 
movies have the sustained snap and invention of, say, the best Disney and 
Warners shorts. 
</P>
<P>
This is to some degree a matter of economics. The cost of producing an animated 
feature is so prohibitive, and the labor so painstaking, that most film makers 
opt for the commercially safe "family entertainment" mode. Irreverence is 
generally the first casualty of the long form. 
</P>
<P>
"All Dogs Go to Heaven," the latest animated feature from Don Bluth ("The Land 
Before Time," "An American Tail"), is in the comfy fun-for-the-entire-family 
category. Except, as is so often the case with such movies, it's not really a 
whole lot of fun for anyone. The animation is of variable quality; the story is 
a garbled pastiche of "Oliver Twist" and "Little Miss Marker;" the songs, 
including four by Charles ("Annie") Strouse, are eminently unhummable. Adults 
probably won't find the story transporting enough to stifle yawns; children 
won't pop their eyes at the animation. 
</P>
<P>
Even on a product tie-in level, the film falls short. Charlie, the junkyard dog 
at the film's center, is rather mangy and uncuddly. Do the Wendy's executives 
who arranged the marketing tie-ins with this movie really believe that rubber 
figurines of a flea-specked mutt will sell burgers? The most memorable thing 
about Charlie is that he is voiced by Burt Reynolds. Charlie/Burt actually gets 
to sing a few songs, making this the first time Reynolds has crooned onscreen 
-- sort of -- since "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas" and before that, "At 
Long Last Love." Some milestones are millstones. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie and his dachshund chum Itchy (Dom DeLuise) break out of prison at the 
start of the film and make their way back to the Louisiana nightclub Charlie 
co-owns with the bulldog Carface (Vic Tayback). 
</P>
<P>
When Charlie is rubbed out by Carface, he zooms off to heaven, where he 
pirouettes with a cloudborne greyhound angel (Melba Moore) before sneaking back 
to Earth for some pay back. There, he snatches from Carface's clutches an 
orphan girl, Anne Marie (Judith Barsi), who has the ability to talk to animals 
-- which comes in handy when betting on rat races and kangaroo boxing matches. 
</P>
<P>
With Anne Marie in tow, Charlie and Itchy put their new-found booty into their 
own nightclub, Charlie's Place. But then innocence rears its ugly head. Anne 
Marie wants Charlie to find her parents. And she disapproves of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
Considering how integral Anne Marie has been to Charlie's betting success, her 
sudden disapproval has the hollowest ring since Claude Rains was shocked -- 
shocked -- to discover gambling going on at Rick's place in "Casablanca." Don 
Bluth and his screenwriter, David Weiss, may be able to sleep better at night 
because of this little tyke's willed naivete, but her virtuousness is a drag on 
the action. The only time the movie jolts to life is when Carface and his 
underlings are scampering and slavering. 
</P>
<P>
A tip-off to the film's vacuity is its vision of heaven, which appears to have 
been color-coordinated in shades of Pepto Bismol. Shouldn't a movie keyed to 
the wonderment of childhood look more wonderful? When animation falls short, as 
it does here, we feel the lack more severely than we would in a live-action 
film, since the expressive possibilities of animation seem limitless. Virtually 
anything can be made to happen. 
</P>
<P>
A great animated film delineates the entrancements and poetic leaps of 
imagination that are central to a child's fantasy life -- and an adult's 
fantasy life too. That's why, when we're in the presence of great animation, we 
feel as if our childhoods have overwhelmed us. Suddenly, everything is 
possible. In "All Dogs Go to Heaven," the possible is the mundane.

POP CAPSULES: BEYOND 'GRACELAND' WITH SENEGAL'S YOUSSOU N'DOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As part of the Amnesty International tour last year, Senegalese singer Youssou 
N'Dour did more than provide Third World contrast and context for First World 
stars Bruce Springsteen, Peter Gabriel, Sting and Tracy Chapman. He showed 
large audiences on five continents that modern Afro-pop goes far beyond 
"Graceland." 
</P>
<P>
At the Palace on Wednesday, N'Dour and his 10-member band accomplished even 
more than that, rendering the terms Third World, Afro-pop and even world beat 
inadequate to describe their music. N'Dour's almost unearthly singing and 
percolating rhythms bear only passing resemblance to the Nigerian juju of King 
Sunny Ade or the South African township jive that inspired "Graceland," 
relating more to the contemporary music coming from Islamic North Africa. (The 
South African style was represented by opening group Themba, an a cappella 
sextet of South African UCLA students.) 
</P>
<P>
But it's N'Dour's cosmopolitan cross-pollination that gave the show its 
distinctive air. Much of the music Wednesday reflected the slinky, modern, 
global melange of his occasional collaborator Gabriel. And the cross-cultural 
crowd seemed quite ready to take N'Dour not as an African musician, but as an 
inventive pop musician. STEVE HOCHMAN

POP CAPSULES: SLY GUITAR FROM RAITT, COODER, LINDLEY AT BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON WALLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rare pairing of sly git-tar whizzards Ry Cooder and David Lindley provided 
the highlights, caustic comic Bob Goldthwait provided the punch lines and 
red-haired bluesrocker Bonnie Raitt provided the headliner at the benefit 
concert for the California Environmental Protection Initiative that sold out 
the Santa Monica Civic on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Raitt (a pretty fair sly guitarist herself) and her band breezed through a 
solid set of old, new, borrowed and blues tunes and the "Bobcat" spewed a blue 
brew of today's political and pop-music stew, but it was the near-telepathic, 
multi-ethnic, musicological, multi-instrumental, ego-free playing of Cooder and 
Lindley that simply shot out the lights. Cajun, gospel, country, blues, cars, 
sex, humor, politricks, virtuosity. This one should have been a live album. DON

'SKIES A' FALLIN' ' PREMIERES AT COURT THEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. H. McCULLOH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The backdrop of Dexter Freeman's "Skies a' Fallin' " is familiar. So, vaguely, 
are the characters. But in this world premiere production at the Court Theatre, 
a new twist is given to the old steamy night in New Orleans on the eve of Mardi 
Gras. 
</P>
<P>
It's a tight little tale about a husband and wife stumbling toward their 40s 
and fracturing their relationship over their childlessness, and the 
guitar-toting 17-year-old street kid who pulls them apart and then puts them 
back together again. Looks like Tennessee Williams? Look again. 
</P>
<P>
"Skies" is deceptively light in its early stages, with a thermometer in Lou 
Sistrunk's mouth to make sure she is ovulating, and her campy neighbor 
Hertizine, called The Diva, helping set the stage for the evening's planned 
conception. Tagging along with Diva is the teen-aged C. L., also known as 
"Chicken Little," who wants only a night's shelter from the falling sky. 
</P>
<P>
But the best laid plans go awry, in this instance with JoJo Sistrunk's 
announcement that he is, and always has been, sterile. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman sets up his pre-Mardi Gras frolic neatly and with a great deal of humor 
and firm characterizations. Lou is a waitress supporting her artist husband, 
and actress Gwen Banta makes a loving if desperate figure of her. She gives Lou 
a rewarding complexity that keeps her from being ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
The other performance that gives the production its distinction is that of 
Douglas Bryant Johnson as C. L., a horrendous role to make work theatrically 
while still winning sympathy. Johnson knows the kid's soft spots and lets us 
see them. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Arbolino is less effective as the husband, but the overbrimming 
enthusiasm of Marie Lillo's Diva could only be improved by a little more 
subtlety. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Mason's direction keeps the energy high and shapes the action and twists of 
plot beautifully, allowing the general lightness to give a nice glow to the 
deeper emotions below. Set and lighting design by Robert W. Zentis, Maggie 
Peach's costumes, Leonora Schildkraut's music and sound, are of the high 
standard these designers maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 At 722 N. La Cienega Blvd., West Hollywood, Thursdays through Sundays, 8 p.m., 
through Jan. 14. Tickets: $15-20; (213) 466-1767.

POP CAPSULES: LIVING-ROOM VIBES FROM PETER CASE AND COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is something agreeably homespun in folkies Bob Neuwirth (of the old 
guard), Peter Case (of the new guard) and Steve Young (of the not-yet-proven 
guard) getting together for some fairly informal acoustic shows in town, 
sharing songs one by one with the slightest of accompaniment from one another, 
as you'd guess they might do in one of their own living rooms. But at Cafe 
Largo on Wednesday, the atmosphere during the first set was more akin to a 
living room in which little sister has invited over a score of friends, as 
incessant crowd chatter prevailed over on-stage chirping. 
</P>
<P>
Being a rock 'n' roll veteran, unlike the other two, Case came through all this 
the easiest. While still in the Plimsouls, he learned the tricks of winning 
over distracted barroom audiences, and the energy in his performing and the 
touching novelty in his songwriting are still inherently attention-getting. 
</P>
<P>
Neuwirth and Young are more reticent performers, and cover the much more 
well-traveled ground of lost love and the-road-as-metaphor. Their often 
funereal approach had a far harder time breaking through, but as the crowd grew 
thinner and more attentive during the late set, Neuwirth and Young's lot 
improved, as it no doubt will further still when the threesome plays folk-haven 
gigs tonight at Bogart's Bohemian Cafe in Long Beach and Saturday at the 
Breakaway in Venice. CHRIS WILLMAN

In a handful of watercolors and graphic works, Jeanette Pasin Sloan renders all 
sorts of silver vessels -- wine goblets, bowls, platters -- with photo realist 
snap. As if it weren't hard enough to coax the fragile, transparent personality 
of watercolor to behave like obdurate metal, Sloan also takes on the task of 
painting in the cacophony of ambient reflections picked up on vessels' shiny 
surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
In "Emergence" there's a tour de force silver pitcher across whose surface we 
see the reflection of a table draped in a striped cloth and an oddly elongated 
nude woman seated in a sunny room with windows bowing outward as they echo the 
curvature of the pitcher. In all the works Sloan cleverly pits the perfectly 
described silver containers against the distorted, fun house look of striped 
fabric, furniture, and other objects mirrored on the silverware's irregular 
planes. 
</P>
<P>
The formal challenge of reflected imagery and the philosophical twist of having 
reality copy itself on the face of a shiny object has tickled the fancy of 
realists since Van Eyck. In Sloan's case, when the formal pyrotechnics subside 
-- and this takes a while because her craft is solid -- there is little else 
there to hold our interest. (Tatischeff Gallery, 1547 10th St. to Dec. 9).

A half-dozen paintings by Bill Komoski look like X-Rays of aged wood siding, or 
infrared diagrams of brush marks made by emulsion materials reacting to a photo 
sensitized surface. In fact Komoski uses only a brush, matte acrylics and paste 
to ape the look of machine made effects. 
</P>
<P>
On deep purple-blue grounds, the artist trowels a brush laden with iridescent 
violet paint back and forth to create lateral banding. The strips run from 
opaque to transparent as the paint on Komoski's brush varies, and he 
intentionally alters the width of the striations to jostle readings of figure 
and ground. Komoski is deft at highlighting color with lighter accents to 
recreate the tinsely look of mylar or a photographic negative. 
</P>
<P>
Highlights also give many canvases the appearance of a strong and inexplicable 
vertical light strafing their centers. Some of the works pantomime machine 
techniques so well they're distancing and cold, but the good ones address the 
whole issue of gesture in post modern art. 
</P>
<P>
The New York school emblazoned original gesture, the color fielders 
spiritualized it, Pop art spoofed and demystified it and conceptual art reduced 
gesture to pure matter and process. Komoski's paintings are interesting because 
they draw from every point along that continuum: look awhile and they're 
shimmery and transcendent, look longer and they're poker faced puns 
decontextualizing the age-old brush and paint vocabulary of art. (Roy Boyd 
Gallery, 1547 10th St. to Dec. 5). MARLENA DONOHUE

British painter Tony Bevan looks back in anger at the socioeconomic underside 
of the Thatcher era in a strong series of stylized, linear portraits and 
self-portraits. An aura of tense submission to unseen, brutal forces pervades 
many of these works. In several images, the artist's head is turned to one side 
to reveal an array of red and black markings. They read variously as strands of 
hair, arteries or wounds -- mementos of the everyday violence of the streets. 
</P>
<P>
In portraits of line-ups of twitching, slack-jawed young men, Bevan carries on 
the anecdotal strain of the British figurative tradition with streamlined 
vigor. At his telegraphic best he obsessively deconstructs portions of the 
human anatomy -- feet, hands, heads -- to reveal the damages and depravities of 
contemporary society. 
</P>
<P>
In "Head, Leg and Red Table," an extended bare leg gashed by a long stroke of 
red paint shares a table with a man's head, flung back to reveal its 
ritualistic pattern of red arteries. Such images are presented on coolly 
stylized, non-descriptive grounds of bright powdered pigment that collects in 
little ripples, as if washed up by an invisible tide. 
</P>
<P>
Most devastating is the large painting called "Fork," in which a hand holding a 
fork emerges out of the spare geometry of a maroon-and-red field. One is 
conscious of the way the fingers are tucked in, the slabs of fingernail and the 
awful meat-like hunk of forearm squashed against the table edge. This is man as 
consumer and devourer, greedy flesh disconnected from mind and soul. Even the 
fork throws a bizarrely menacing shadow. (L.A. Louver, 55 N. Venice Blvd. and 
77 Market St., Venice, to Nov. 25) CATHY CURTIS

Matt Mullican's "Untitled (Bath Stone)" is a vast, low-lying swath of limestone 
slabs carved with the plan of a model city, a metaphysical construct that has 
preoccupied the artist throughout this decade. (The title refers to the English 
city in which the piece was carved.) 
</P>
<P>
Two oval areas on this plan contain incised clusters of images. One group 
consists of familiar pictographs from the international sign system the artist 
incorporates into most of his works -- the little images that announce nearby 
amenities (telephone, restaurant) and indicate proper social behavior (a figure 
throwing litter in a basket). Carved into the other "image bank" are rows of 
generic insects, plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
Mullican's use of such images hinges on the viewer's easy recognition of these 
signs. By grouping them in mind-boggling arrays, he calls into question their 
seemingly fixed meanings and invites the viewer to devise personal 
alternatives. What is the relationship between the food chain represented in 
one image bank and the human imagery and consumer goods crammed together in the 
other? The answers seem to be entirely up to the whims of the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Other, two-dimensional work on view includes "Untitled (Round House)," a large 
acrylic and oil stick grisaille painting of the interior of a circular building 
used to switch locomotives. An incongruous billboard in this space repeats the 
city plan image, teasing the mind with a competing "fictional reality." The 
blurred, grainy quality of the painting makes it look like a second-generation 
copy of an original we don't get to see. It seems of a piece with Mullican's 
musings on the way the language systems we use reconstruct the world at a 
second remove. (Richard Kuhlenschmidt Gallery, 1634 17th St., Santa Monica, to

This has been designated Home Video Week by the Video Software Dealers Assn.,

<P>
Two days ago, Warner Home Video released "Batman," the blockbuster fantasy that 
opened in theaters only five months ago and set box-office records. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the hype over the PG-13-rated movie, which stars Michael Keaton as 
Batman and Jack Nicholson as the Joker, despite the fact that it was directed 
by the talented Tim Burton ("Beetlejuice"), and despite the low price -- $24.98 
-- you may be better off renting the tape for a $2 preview before you buy. 
Unless, of course, you've already seen the movie and know you want to spend $25 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
Over the next few weeks, "Batman" may break the video-cassette-sales records 
set by "E.T." (the laserdisc won't be out until early '90), but unlike "E.T.," 
this was not a movie that was (nearly) universally loved. Lost amid all the 
Batmania is the fact that the film disappointed many people. 
</P>
<P>
Times film critic Sheila Benson, for example, wrote that only Keaton's 
performance "keeps the picture alive; it's certainly not the special effects, 
the editing, which has no discernifble rhythm, or the flaccid screenplay." 
</P>
<P>
And in the newly released 20th-anniversary edition of Leonard Maltin's TV 
Movies and Video Guide, Maltin gives "Batman" only a mediocre 2 1/2-star rating 
-- a mere half-star more than the 1966 version starring Adam West! "There's 
razzle-dazzle to spare in this dark, intense variation on Bob Kane's comic book 
creation," says Maltin, generally a fan of fantasy films and an expert on 
cartoons, "but there's also something askew when the villain is so much more 
potent than the hero!" 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there were several critics -- and millions of filmgoers -- who loved 
the movie. However, there's one more thing you'd better not expect from this 
ballyhooed "Batman" -- Robin. 
</P>
<P>
Other new-on-tape movies: 
</P>
<P>
"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, PG) might please a 
lot of "Batman" fans. Also a big-budget fantasy that was preceded by another 
version (two, in fact, in 1943 and 1961), "Munchausen" is a 
special-effects-and-fun-filled movie about an 18th-Century traveler. It's 
another far-out film from Terry Gilliam, who did the crazy artwork for Monty 
Python and made the brilliant "Brazil." 
</P>
<P>
"The Wicked Stepmother" (MGM/UA, $79.95, PG-13) is another 1989 fantasy / 
comedy, but one that will be remembered only as the unfortunate final project 
of the great actress Bette Davis -- she left the movie during production and 
the script was rewritten accordingly, and disastrously. 
</P>
<P>
"K-9" (MCA, $89.95, PG-13) is the first and worst (by a sniffing nose) of 
1989's dog-and-man-detective-team films to be released on video (still to come: 
"Turner and Hooch"). Jim Belushi plays a narcotics officer who works with a 
headstrong German shepherd. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rainbow" (Vestron, $89.98, R) returns director Ken Russell and star Glenda 
Jackson to D. H. Lawrence territory, with far less pleasing results than the 
film that made both famous, "Women in Love" (1970, available on video). 
</P>
<P>
"The Dressmaker" (Capitol, $79.95, no MPAA rating) stars the great veteran 
British actresses Joan Plowright and Billie Whitelaw in a low-budget, low-key 
film that starts off nicely and then goes awry. It's about two very different 
Liverpool sisters whose niece falls for an American soldier during World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
Four oldies from MGM/UA ($19.95 each): 
</P>
<P>
"Yours, Mine and Ours" (1968) isn't the best comedy ever made by its stars 
(Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda, who, incidentally used to date back in the 
pre-Desi days), but it's a fine family film -- in more ways than one. Ball 
plays a widow with eight children who marries a widower (Fonda) with 10 of his 
own. 
</P>
<P>
"A Hole in the Head" (1959) unites two great Franks (star Sinatra, director 
Capra) with disappointing results -- it's a gooey son-and-dad drama -- but 
among the occasional pleasures is the delightful song "High Hopes." 
</P>
<P>
"The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm" (1962) has a few colorful, playful 
renditions of Grimm fairy tales, but the framing story of the tale-collecting 
brothers (Laurence Harvey, Karl Boehm) is a drag. TERRY ATKINSON

HOME TECH: COURT OKS FILM RENTALS WITH COMMERCIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
What home video fans have always feared -- clusters of commercials on cassettes 
-- is a step closer. 
</P>
<P>
This time next year, you may have to fast forward through two or three ads on a 
rental cassette before you get to the movie. 
</P>
<P>
A Kansas federal court apparently opened the floodgates recently with a 
stunning ruling in favor of Video Broadcasting Systems, a Wichita company that 
has been putting local ads on rental movies for the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
Home video companies object to these local ads for two reasons: first, because 
an excess of local ads may turn off renters, and second, because these home 
video companies don't get a penny of the local ad revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to end the local-ad threat, Paramount Home Video sued Video 
Broadcasting Systems, claiming that company had added local commercials to 
Paramount videocassettes without authorization. The Paramount suit charged 
copyright infringement, asserting that the local ads spilled over onto coming 
attractions and the authorized national ads that Paramount had sold. The studio 
sought an injunction and $1 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
In a 38-page opinion, Judge Sam Crow of the U.S. District Court in Wichita 
denied a preliminary injunction, saying that the ads didn't violate copyright, 
trademark or unfair competition laws and also did no damage to Paramount's 
product or reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"Had Paramount gotten the injunction, we would have been ruined," Video 
Broadcasting Systems President Tim Mead said. "But now we can forge ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Though it lost this battle, Paramount hasn't conceded the war. According to 
Deborah Rosen, the company's senior vice president of corporate communication, 
Paramount will pursue further legal action. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling was also a go-ahead signal for the other company peddling local 
commercials on cassettes, Video Air Time of Midland, Tex, which differs from 
Video Broadcasting Systems in one important way. While the latter puts the 
spots on the blank tape preceding the movie, Video Air Time places its ads on 
tape that is spliced onto the beginning of the cassette. 
</P>
<P>
VBS and VAT get their revenues from advertisers who purchase spots on the 
cassettes. Then they pay video retailers a fee for the right to add the 
commercials to the cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
What home video companies fear is that this favorable ruling will not only 
prompt these two companies to expand their activities but also will attract 
other entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
Said CBS-Fox executive Dave Goldstein: "This could be the tip of the iceberg. 
Right now these local ads are a factor in a few small places. But this whole 
thing could grow." 
</P>
<P>
Home video companies are worried that these local ads might discourage national 
advertisers, like Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola, who make deals for their 
commercials to be on cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
"National advertisers are concerned about this uncontrolled addition of local 
ads," said Jim Davie, president of the Pepsi Cola Entertainment Group. "It's 
not a big problem just yet, but it could become one. We want exclusivity. A 
national advertiser doesn't want other ads involved. If companies like 
Paramount can't guarantee exclusivity, then national advertisers won't be as 
interested in making cassette deals in the future." 
</P>
<P>
What these extra ads do, Davie explained, is increase the likelihood of 
"zapping": "The more ads on the cassette, the more likely people are to 
fast-forward and not even look at them." 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging this concern, Mead said a survey is being conducted now to 
determine how many videocassette commercials people would tolerate. 
</P>
<P>
Mead maintained that issues such as "zapping" are smoke-screens for the 
bottom-line: money. 
</P>
<P>
"The big problem is that companies like Paramount aren't getting revenues from 
local ads," he said. "I'm prepared to work out deals with them so they'll get a 
share of the profits." 
</P>
<P>
Mead also mentioned a compromise that might keep national advertisers 
interested in putting ads on cassettes. "We might work out a deal where we 
wouldn't put local ads on cassettes until, say, 30-60 days after the movie is 
released." 
</P>
<P>
National advertisers haven't turned their backs on the home-video market just 
yet, undoubtedly figuring that, right now, local ads are a factor in a small 
section of the national market. In an effort to discourage the local ads, 
meanwhile, Orion has eliminated most of the blank tape from the beginning of 
its cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
Another possible solution for home video companies would require a drastic 
change in basic industry policy. Instead of selling tapes to retailers, home 
video companies might lease them. By leasing, the video companies would retain 
some control over the tapes and might be able to restrict local ads.

LOVE, LETTERS ENTWINED IN AFFAIRS OF THE HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A young man and a young woman unwittingly hire the same middle-aged scrivener 
to write love letters to each other in Gabriel Garcia Marquez's "Letters From 
the Park" (at 9 tonight on Channels 28, 15 and 24, in Spanish with English 
subtitles). 
</P>
<P>
The setting is Matanzas, Cuba, in 1913 -- an idyllic place for a love story, at 
least when seen through the eyes of Cuban director Tomas Gutierrez Alea. But 
not everything goes according to plan. The lovers like each other's letters 
more than they like each other. And the letter writer himself (Victor LaPlace) 
falls for the young woman (Ivonne Lopez) -- or at least with the idea of 
falling for her. 
</P>
<P>
Shades of "Cyrano de Bergerac." But this intermediary is no dashing leader of 
men, but rather a melancholic widower who occasionally takes comfort in the 
arms of a golden-hearted prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
The story was inspired by a brief mention in Garcia Marquez's "Love in the Time 
of Cholera," but the Nobel laureate created new characters to flesh out this 
film, which he co-wrote with Eliseo Alberto Diego and director Alea (who is 
best known for "Memories of Underdevelopment" and "Death of a Bureaucrat"). 
</P>
<P>
Concurrent with the human romance is an affair between the young man (Miquel 
Paneque) and flying. He is clumsily trying to learn how to pilot a balloon, and 
his efforts not only distract him from the would-be love of his life, but they 
also expand the scenic dimensions of the film. Still, the essential spareness 
of the story isn't violated. The performances are carefully understated -- 
which helps turn up the eroticism of the final scene. 
</P>
<P>
The script doesn't hint at the "magical realism" for which Garcia Marquez is 
widely known. It's simply a graceful and civilized film about the importance of 
experiencing affairs of the heart firsthand.

JANE'S CUCINA: FAMILIAR PASTA, UNUSUAL SETTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jane's Cucina Italia is hard to figure. Recently renamed and reconceptualized, 
it used to be called Le Serene (in fact you still get the old restaurant's 
matchbooks), and the decor is, well, nearly as unforgettable as Jane. 
</P>
<P>
You enter through the hotel lobby of a '30s-looking structure known as the 
Safari Inn, then pass through a show-biz bar where mirrored walls are covered 
with pictures of celebrities from Woody Allen to Rex the Wonder Horse. As you 
pause to take a long look at just what you are in for, a sultry blonde 
bombshell in evening wear comes up and says "G'day." Egad. Jane is an Aussie. 
</P>
<P>
Tiny lights shimmer and twinkle on an opaque black ceiling and from endless 
rows of clear plastic rods that hang down by darkened windows. You sink into 
high-backed, plush red velvet booths and drink in a sultry air of mystery. Hard 
jazz plays softly over the speakers. It's almost as if one of those private 
clubs where the monster at the door only lets you in if he approves of the way 
you are dressed. When food actually comes to the table, it's almost a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
From the mondo bizzarro decor, you'd expect to find food to match. No such 
luck. The chef, David Cecchini, is the son of the man who owns Genio's, a big, 
conventional Italian haunt just down the street. 
</P>
<P>
You might begin with his credible version of polenta parmigiana, a grilled 
square of cornmeal with eggplant, mozzarella and a thick marinara sauce, or by 
trying his fresh bufala mozzarella with olive oil, minced garlic and roasted 
peppers. And there are plenty of pizzas -- melanzane, with grilled eggplant and 
a good sausage, or Margherita, with basil and four cheeses. But you'd better be 
hungry. Most things come with soup (a slightly bland, beanless minestrone) or 
salad (a better choice with a stand-up vinaigrette), and portions are huge. 
</P>
<P>
Cecchini makes a couple of pastas fresh daily. One day, he made a fresh tomato 
fettuccine a la Davide, his own recipe, with plum tomato, fresh mushrooms, lots 
of basil and chunked prosciutto; the whole thing was finished with an Alfredo 
sauce en casserole. The prosciutto was a nice touch and gave the dish real 
character. 
</P>
<P>
Another day, I sampled canneloni, thick tubes of pasta stuffed with a meat 
mixture that reminded me of the premium-grade roast beef hash you get at places 
like the Pacific Dining Car or the Grill. It didn't taste particularly Italian, 
but I didn't mind. 
</P>
<P>
Other pastas were less experimental, but no less good. Cecchini cooks all of 
his pastas al dente, and most of his sauces are appealing. The Alfredo and 
pesto are on the heavy side, but tasty. Aglio e funghi, garlic and mushroom in 
a butter sauce, is simple and satisfying, with really big slices of mushrooms. 
Only the marinara sauce was a disappointment -- far too thick, and not nearly 
rambunctious enough. 
</P>
<P>
Cioppino was the best of the main dishes. Mixed seafood, including snapper, 
clams, shrimp and calamari came in a thick, nicely seasoned tomato stew. And a 
fine filet mignon came topped with porcini. 
</P>
<P>
Lobster Portofino may have been the worst. It turned out to be an undercooked, 
rock lobster tail. Chicken primavera wasn't much better: a giant dish of 
parboiled vegetables and chunks of white meat chicken came in a profoundly 
boring butter sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Jane will come by and offer you dessert after dinner, and I'd advise you to 
take her up on it. There is an excellent homemade bread pudding served cold, 
and several interesting gelato bombes, including tortoni (coconut ice cream 
with almonds) and espresso (also cloaked in chocolate). At this writing, the 
espresso machine has not yet arrived, so content yourself with cafe Picasso, a 
giant mug of coffee, grappa, rum, brandy and several other mystery ingredients. 
And don't forget to say "G'day" on the way out. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane's Cucina Italia, 2011 W. Olive Ave., Burbank. (818) 843-4437. Open for 
breakfast 6:30 to 10:30 a.m. Sunday through Friday, for lunch 11:30 a.m. to 
2:30 p.m. Monday through Friday, for dinner from 5 to 10 p.m. Monday through 
Saturday. Major credit cards accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $20 to $30.

The Solidarity-led Parliament in Poland passed a law that reduces the sentences 
of many prisoners and suspends terms of those convicted of lesser crimes on the 
grounds that the jail terms set by the former Communist regime were too severe. 
The law covers crimes committed before Sept. 12, the day the Communist 
government was replaced by a Solidarity-led administration.

In a shift that could break its postwar deadlock with Iraq, Iran offered to 
exchange prisoners of war simultaneously with an Iraqi withdrawal from its 
border territory. The official new agency IRNA said Foreign Minister Ali Akbar 
Velayati laid out Iran's new position to a U.N. envoy in Tehran "to help break 
the present artificial impasse which benefits no one."

Three South Africans and two Americans were indicted in Washington for 
allegedly conspiring to export $50-million worth of U.S. missile-guidance 
equipment to South Africa through Israel. The five were charged as part of an 
ongoing Customs Service undercover operation in which agents posed as arms 
brokers. The equipment, made by Los Angeles-based Northrop Corp., was destined 
for Armscor, the South African national arms company. The Justice Department 
said Northrop cooperated in the probe.

Jurors in the trial of a Latino police officer charged with killing two black 
men in a Miami shooting that set off three days of racial rioting saw a 
videotape of blacks pelting crime scene detectives with rocks and bottles. "It 
was bedlam," testified crime scene technician Rafael Garcia, who was hurt the 
night of Jan. 16 by flying debris. Garcia, a prosecution witness in the trial 
of Officer William Lozano, 31, told defense lawyer Mark Seiden that much of the 
physical evidence in the case was abandoned because of the violence. Garcia, 
testifying during the second day of testimony, did not say whether evidence 
that was never retrieved by police would have been beneficial to either side.

Two young girls and their father died in a house fire in the Fresno County 
community of Clovis. The blaze may have been hidden from passers-by by a dense 
San Joaquin Valley fog, authorities said. A motorist who spotted the flames 
called firefighters on a car phone, but the fog prevented the driver from 
pinpointing his location, a Clovis fire official said. The Fresno County 
coroner's office identified the victims as Avery Hensley III, 28, and his 
daughters Rebecca, 6, and Stephanie, 8.

A San Bernardino County sheriff's deputy fatally shot a Fontana woman as he

unidentified deputy had walked over to the car during a routine traffic stop 
just north of San Bernardino when the woman, whose name was withheld, suddenly 
accelerated. He fired as he held on to the door. Following the shooting, the 
deputy was hospitalized with abrasions, officials said. A man accompanying the 
dead woman was not wounded but was arrested on outstanding warrants, deputies

Convicted "Night Stalker" Richard Ramirez has been transferred to San Quentin, 
where he will become the 266th inmate awaiting the gas chamber on Death Row. 
The 29-year-old devil worshiper was flown by sheriff's helicopter from Men's 
Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles to Long Beach, where he boarded a small 
plane for Marin County. Prison spokesman Lt. Cal White said Ramirez will spend 
a week in an "orientation area."

More than 120 pounds of marijuana -- evidence in the trial of a Los Altos man 
-- has been stolen from a locked storage shed at a ranger station in the 
Stanislaus National Forest. A U.S. Forest Service spokesman said that the 
plants have a street value of almost $225,000 and that the FBI has been called 
into the investigation. The marijuana was being held as evidence against 
Jeffrey Peter Gurney, 37. Officials said the theft will not affect the case 
because prosecutors have a sample of the marijuana and other evidence.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / S. J. DIAMOND: MOST 1-900 NUMBERS DON'T DELIVER WHAT THEY 
ADVERTISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. J. DIAMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who wouldn't be curious? The "Success Line," 1-900-USA-CASH, promises tips on 
earning additional income, getting jobs, fixing bad credit. D. J. Jazzy Jeff 
and the Fresh Prince offer rap sessions on 1-900-909-JEFF. There's even group 
conversation, all male, on 1-900-505-JOCK. 
</P>
<P>
Something for everyone. What a kick. 
</P>
<P>
It's more than that. To the entrepreneurs selling such fare, billed to the 
caller's phone, 900 service is the "fourth medium," after radio, TV and print, 
says Cory Eisner, vice president of New York-based Phone Programs (Jazzy Jeff 
and others). 
</P>
<P>
To consumers, it's a potential nightmare. Such numbers, says a California 
university professor, fighting the phone company over a child's unauthorized 
calls, "in effect turn the telephone into a credit card or blank check, without 
the protections that federal and state law provide to credit card or check 
users." 
</P>
<P>
What's exciting is the promise of personal access to the information age. 
There's talk of financial quotes, legal advice, medical information, of "known 
and reputable providers who'd like to use (900 service) as an alternative way 
to service their customers," says Howard Levin, vice president of marketing at 
Interactive Telemedia, a Los Angeles "telepromotions" agency. 
</P>
<P>
But that's mostly talk. There's more promotion than information broadcast. 
"It's sad when you see all the truly fantastic things that can be done with 
telephones," says Jeffrey Holtzman, deputy city attorney in Santa Monica, "and 
what do we get but P. T. Barnum?" 
</P>
<P>
In a week of calling, the most intellectual fare heard was 1-900-WEATHER (75 
cents a minute). Typical financial stuff (1-900-USA-CASH, $2 for the first 
minute, $1 each additional) defined cash reserves as "money you don't need to 
live on," and suggested using credit cards to buy now and pay when one has 
money. 
</P>
<P>
More than 90% of 900 lines are "entertainment," and while it's doubtless 
someone's medium, it's no fourth. It's inane chatter from a rock star, a 
rapper, a deservedly starving comic ("Her face brought up more food than a 
Heimlich maneuver"). More often, it's clips from albums, books, movies about to 
be released -- undisguised hypes billed to Barnum's born-every-minute suckers. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the information transmitted comes from the caller, paying to give 
personal data to sweepstakes promoters, food companies, opinion polls. It's 
party-line conversations with consenting men, women, sports fans, or private 
conversations with other callers ("Hi, this is Lisa, 5'7", 125 pounds, I'm bi 
(bisexual) but also straight, Voice mail 31644"). 
</P>
<P>
Alas, one can't always hear the fourth medium. Telephone wires being rather low 
fidelity, Jazzy Jeff seemed to bubble up through water, Motley Crue was all 
beat and static. Six celebrity impersonations for a birthday greeting ($3 to 
hear them, $11.99 to order one) needed rehearing. 
</P>
<P>
The all-male chat group above (90 cents per minute) was always silent, without 
participants. Sports Phone Live (99 cents per minute to talk sports with seven 
to 10 fans and celebrities) had only the staff man, twice. Even 1-900-USA-SWING 
(67 cents a minute, 15-minute minimum) was all wind whistling through the party 
lines and occasional voices calling, pathetically, "Hello? Hello? Who's there? 
This is Jim. Hello, who's this? Hello? " 
</P>
<P>
Worse, this fourth medium is being unleashed before the marketplace is ready. 
The sales arrangements, or lack of them, are almost anti-consumer: There's 
little disclosure and no normal retail procedures. The consumer may not know 
what he's buying or its price, and can't cancel the purchase once made. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is it well regulated. The Federal Communications Commission regulates only 
the terms of the service that telephone carriers provide to interstate 
"information-providers" (the programming entrepreneurs), not the service those 
entrepreneurs provide the consumer, or "end user." The few 900 numbers offering 
service strictly intrastate come under variable state regulations. 
</P>
<P>
In California, for example, there must be an initial statement of price on such 
calls, a $20 price cap, a monitor (in the provider's employ) on party lines to 
interrupt "harmful matter." But the rules don't yet cover all telephone 
companies, and cover only intrastate calls -- a minute portion of the market, 
indistinguishable to consumers, who have no idea where each 1-900 call goes. 
</P>
<P>
The particular carrier (more than 60 provide 900 service to entrepreneurs) may 
cancel 900 charges if calls were made without the bill-payer's knowledge or 
authorization (by children, perhaps) or if he didn't know the cost. But most do 
so only once, and none have provisions for canceling charges if the consumer 
got bad service or a disappointing product -- an empty party line, inane 
financial advice, inferior porn. "Our basic policy," says Andrea West, 
AT&amp;T's national marketing manager for 900 service, "is to sustain the 
charges." 
</P>
<P>
So much for the retailer. The manufacturers, or providers of these messages are 
often unknown and never identified and in many cases, says AT&amp;T's West, 
"did not want to be referred to by anyone." It's not easy, therefore, to 
contact the people responsible for a message, even through their carrier (if 
one can figure out which it is). 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T requires a written inquiry from anyone asking a provider's identity 
and provides only name and mailing address. The information line at Telesphere 
(the USA prefix, among others) is always busy. And Pacific Bell (505-JOCK, 
among others) took 50 minutes to understand the inquiry and find the right 
office, right individual and right list providing such information. 
</P>
<P>
Even getting one's lines blocked from all 900 access isn't easy. Individual 
states may make total blocking available or just blocking of intrastate calls, 
blocking of all 900-code prefixes or blocking of selected prefixes. Some 
companies don't even know what they can do: the California professor was told 
that GTE California doesn't provide 900 blocking, then that it does but not for 
all 900 numbers, then that does but not for all his lines (a GTE California 
spokesman says it does, period). 
</P>
<P>
For telephone companies, for consumers, even for regulators, "it's very 
difficult to try to sort out this service, jurisdictionally and otherwise," 
says Kathie Kneff, chief of the informal complaints branch of the FCC's common 
carrier bureau. Until someone does, consumers would be smart not to use it.

U.S. PROBING PATIENT REFERRALS BY DOCTORS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH CARE: SOME 500 LABS MAY BE TARGETED. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN 
SERVICES IS TRYING TO LEARN WHETHER THEY ARE PROFITING ILLEGALLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The enforcement arm of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has 
launched a probe of hundreds of doctor-owned clinical laboratories, imaging 
centers and other health-care facilities to discover whether doctors are 
illegally benefiting from patient referrals. 
</P>
<P>
Some 500 facilities -- about 80 in Southern California -- may be targeted in 
the investigation by the HHS' Office of Inspector General. 
</P>
<P>
The OIG recently served a rash of broad subpoenas under anti-kickback 
provisions of federal Medicare and Medicaid laws. The subpoenas seek detailed 
information on nearly every aspect of the businesses, including how joint 
ventures were structured, who the partners are and how profits are distributed. 
They also seek records of the referrals made by physician owners. 
</P>
<P>
Inspector General Richard P. Kusserow has never been as active in investigating 
the industry as he is now and that fact alone is already having a "chilling 
effect" on the businesses, said lawyers and consultants who advise health-care 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation has caused confusion among investors because Kusserow seems 
to be questioning practices considered normal and legitimate in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The mere fact that they are targets of investigations has been very damaging 
to their businesses," said Patric Hooper, a partner in Hooper, Lundy &amp; 
Bookman, a Los Angeles law firm specializing in health care. 
</P>
<P>
Some doctors have stopped making referrals to targeted clinics, he said. Also, 
he added, some physicians are trying to get out of the businesses and pending 
joint ventures are having trouble finding capital because potential investors 
are scared. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California, where a greater percentage of physicians have bought into 
health-care businesses than elsewhere, is a particular focus of the probe. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Holtz, spokeswoman for Kusserow, refused to say how many facilities were 
targeted, but she said the estimate of 500 nationwide by the industry lawyers 
was a "bit high." 
</P>
<P>
The investigation stems from a "fraud alert" the inspector general sent last 
April to about a million doctors and health-care providers asking them to 
report suspect joint ventures that may violate the law. Calls started pouring 
into hot lines set up by OIG around the country, Holtz said, explaining that 
calls raising questions about California and New York businesses were 
particularly heavy. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation was opened because the allegations were "substantial," she 
said. The probe may result in civil proceedings or criminal charges against the 
targeted businesses, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1977 federal anti-kickback law and related statues have never been 
interpreted to bar physicians from referring patients to health-care services 
in which they have a financial stake, said Hooper, Lundy attorney W. Bradley 
Tully. (California law, however, requires that doctors who refer patients 
disclose their financial stake, if it reaches a certain threshold percentage.) 
</P>
<P>
"The problem here is that it (federal law) is very broad," said Craig Holden, a 
Baltimore attorney specializing in health care. "If any kind of payment is 
intended to induce referrals, it is a violation," he said, explaining that 
distributing profits to partners based on the number of referrals is clearly 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
But part of the problem, he said, is that OIG seems to be implying that some 
practices the industry believes have legitimate business purposes are designed 
to make indirect payments for referrals possible. 
</P>
<P>
"We think they are . . . really trying to make new law and set new precedents," 
Tully said. He said some health-care lawyers believe that OIG will proceed 
against certain businesses based on "suspect practices " identified in the 
fraud alert and seek to have a court declare those activities a violation of 
the anti-kickback laws. 
</P>
<P>
The fraud alert states that the OIG is trying to ferret out indirect forms of 
rewarding partners for making referrals. 
</P>
<P>
"These suspect joint ventures may be intended not so much to raise investment 
capital legitimately to start a business, but to lock up a stream of referrals 
from the physician investors and to compensate them indirectly for these 
referrals," it said. It identifies "potentially unlawful activity" to include: 
</P>
<P>
* Offering greater investment opportunities to doctors who are expected to make 
a large number of referrals and offering less opportunity to those who are not. 
</P>
<P>
* Encouraging physicians to divest if they don't sustain a certain number of 
referrals or requiring doctors to divest if they move out of the area or 
retire. 
</P>
<P>
* Keeping and distributing sources of referrals to investors. 
</P>
<P>
There may be legitimate quality control reasons for keeping track of referrals 
in that the laboratory or clinic may want to know whether a drop in referrals 
is a sign that doctors are unhappy with its service, said Hooper, Lundy partner 
Robert W. Lundy Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not uncommon for businesses to provide information to investors as to 
where the business is coming from," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The OIG investigation comes amid an ongoing debate over whether physicians who 
have an interest in health-care businesses refer more patients for tests. 
Kusserow reported to Congress in April that Medicare patients treated at 
clinical labs owned by their doctors receive almost half again as many tests as 
Medicare patients in general. Such "over-utilization," he said, cost Medicare 
an additional $28 million in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers as well as many in the medical community believe physician 
ownership of health-care services where they refer patients is an inherent 
conflict of interest. Rep. Pete Stark (D-Calif.) has been pushing Congress to 
ban doctors from referring Medicare patients to labs in which they have 
invested. The bill currently only has House approval. Despite the stepped-up 
enforcement by the OIG, Stark still believes new law is necessary to prevent 
abuses, said a spokesman for the congressman. 
</P>
<P>
The OIG investigation also comes at a time when doctors are facing increased 
competitive pressures and are seeking new ways to maintain income. The 
proliferation of health-maintenance organizations and Preferred Provider 
Organizations mean that physicians are increasingly receiving discounted 
payments for their services, said Steve Valentine, a Los Angeles-based Ernst 
&amp; Young partner specializing in health-care consulting. Medicare and 
Medicaid is also paying doctors less, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"To maintain their income stream, they need to make money somewhere else, " he 
said. Investing in clinical laboratories and other ancillary health-care 
services has become a very popular option. However, with the OIG stepping up 
its investigations, many potential physician investors are looking at the 
ventures with a "more jaundiced eye." The investigations have given doctors who 
are in some marginal ventures an excuse to bail out, he added.

AT&amp;T Plans to Boost Some Rates: Long-distance telephone rates, which have 
fallen nearly 40% since 1984, appear to have bottomed out as American Telephone 
&amp; Telegraph, the market leader, asked federal regulators to let it increase 
domestic prices for night and weekend calling by $34 million a year, a 1.3% 
increase. The average price of a 10-minute late-night call from Los Angeles to 
New York would increase to $1.32 from $1.30, effective Nov. 29.

TEXAS AIR TO BUY 40 AIRBUS JETS FOR CONTINENTAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT E. DALLOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Texas Air Corp. said Thursday that it will buy 40 European-made Airbus A330 and 
A340 aircraft for its Continental Airlines subsidiary in a deal that could 
total $4.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air, said the planes will be used by 
Continental to enable it to develop "important" new markets and to replace 
older airliners. He added that some of the planes might also be used eventually 
by his company's other subsidiary, Eastern Airlines, which is trying to work 
its way out of bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second major commercial airplane order announced this week. Delta 
Air Lines said Tuesday that it was buying $10 billion worth of planes from 
Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"These aircraft place us in a strong position to capitalize on the new and 
exciting opportunities we have for growth in both the Pacific and Europe," 
Lorenzo said, "and in particular as a result of the recently signed U.S.-Japan 
bilateral agreement." The two nations have agreed to increase the number of 
commercial air routes between them. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo said Airbus Industrie, a European consortium, plans to finance the 
purchase of the planes itself. But he said that between now and 1993, when the 
first plane is delivered, other arrangements for financing might be made. 
Another possibility, he said, is having the planes purchased by a third party, 
which would lease them to Texas Air, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Texas Air said it placed firm orders for 20 of the Airbus planes and took 
options on 20 others, which it said was the largest single order so far for the 
A330 and A340. 
</P>
<P>
Lorenzo said it had not been decided yet which company would make the engines 
for the planes. 
</P>

"This is a positive move on the part of Texas Air," said airline analyst Ray 
Neidl of the New York investment firm of Dillon, Read &amp; Co. "It shows that 
they have faith in the future. But, also, they have to stay competitive. They 
have many older aircraft that are reaching obsolescence in the 1990s. And many 
other airlines have been buying large amounts of planes." 
</P>
<P>
Neidl said it is not surprising that Airbus Industrie has offered to provide 
the financing. "They do this as a last resort to make sure the deal will go 
through," he said. "They are probably offering a low rate of interest to get 
the deal." 
</P>
<P>
The A330 and A340 are two distinct wide-body aircraft within a single program 
that provides economies of scale in training, scheduling, maintenance and 
parts. The A330 has two engines, and the longer-range A340 has four. 
</P>
<P>
The A330 will carry about 300 passengers, and the A340 has about 286 seats. 
Capacity in the A340 is lower because the plane carries two cockpit crews for 
very long-distance flights and is designed to include a two-bunk crew-rest 
compartment immediately behind the flight deck for the longest flights. Both 
planes will provide three classes of service. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Pierson, president of the consortium, which is made up of manufacturers in 
West Germany, Britain, France and Spain, told reporters that 466 of its five 
types of planes have now been sold to five North American airlines. He said 
Airbus had estimated that it eventually would sell a total of 800 A330s and 
A340s. It already has commitments for half that many and now hopes to sell 
1,000. 
</P>
<P>
The two planes are expected to enter service in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Texas Air ordered 50 Boeing narrow-body 737-300s and took options on 
another 50 in a deal that could total $2.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The A340 has the fuel capacity to enable it to make flights of up to 7,000 
miles and the power to use high-altitude airports, making it ideal for use in 
the Pacific, Latin America and Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Airbus Industrie said the new planes will cost less to operate than competing 
aircraft and thus will be able to fly profitably with smaller passenger loads. 
</P>
<P>
Airbus said the A340 offers seat-mile costs equal to that of Boeing's much 
larger new 747-400. It said the 747-400, the first of which Boeing delivered a 
few months ago, burns about 75% more fuel to carry 50% more passengers than the 
A330 and A340. A McDonnell Douglas MD-11 burns 22% more fuel than the A330 and 
14% more than the A340, the European company said.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: IMAGE CONSULTANTS CAN TAKE JITTERS OUT OF 
MAKING THAT BIG PRESENTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When you own a small business, you not only run the business, you are the 
business. And because most business owners can't afford a full-time public 
relations person, the owner usually serves as the company spokesperson. 
</P>
<P>
But what if you are shy in public and feel uncomfortable when asked to answer 
questions or speak to groups? Do you stay awake all night before you have to 
make a presentation? Do your palms sweat? Does your throat tighten before a 
speech? 
</P>
<P>
If so, you may want to consider working with an image or communications 
consultant. There are many to choose from, especially in Southern California -- 
the image capital of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Joe McLean Jr., vice president of an asbestos removal company, admitted that he 
was petrified when he had to make presentations to trade or civic groups. 
</P>
<P>
"I got ill the night before," said McLean. "I used to stand behind the podium 
and read the speech, grateful that the lights were off while I showed the 
slides." 
</P>
<P>
As public speaking became a major part of his role at P. W. Stephens 
Contractors in City of Industry, a public relations firm referred him to On 
Camera, a West Los Angeles communications consulting firm. After several hours 
of training and confidence building, McLean said he now speaks to groups about 
three times a week and would think nothing of addressing an audience of 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who wants to get out and sell their product and doesn't do this kind 
of thing is kidding themselves," said McLean. 
</P>
<P>
On Camera's Christen Brown and Peter Lownds work with authors, business owners 
and anyone else who is anxious to boost confidence and overcome stage fright. 
</P>
<P>
Working with clients in front of a video camera, Brown and Lownds try to bring 
out what's best in people, rather than try to change them. 
</P>
<P>
"The camera is a phenomenal tool," said Brown, a former psychologist and 
television personality. "People have to see themselves as others see them." 
</P>
<P>
By watching themselves on tape, the clients observe their quirks or nervous 
habits. Brown said most people don't realize that more than half of the total 
impression made during an oral presentation comes from nonverbal cues. Most of 
the rest comes from the speaker's voice; less than 10% results from the actual 
words spoken. "I once listened to a man giving a brilliant speech, but one hand 
was betraying him by jingling the coins in his pocket," said Lownds, who is an 
actor and language teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Communications consultants at On Camera and elsewhere rely on breathing 
exercises, visualizations and role playing to help clients relax and be 
themselves on camera. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent session with Stuart Brown, an attorney and investment banker 
who wanted to refine his Southern "good ol' boy" image, Lownds pretended to be 
a high-powered Hollywood mogul interviewing Brown for a job. 
</P>
<P>
The first videotaped session revealed Brown's nervousness. He was unaware that 
he was rubbing his thumbs together when he spoke. Brown also tended to lean 
back in his chair, looking sleepy, rather than attentively sitting forward. 
After a few hours of training and practice, Brown appeared confident, relaxed 
and a step ahead of the interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
Clifford Scott, vice president of Scott, Lancaster, Mills, Atha, a small 
Century City advertising agency, said he turned to On Camera when he felt his 
sales presentations to clients needed more pizazz. "Advertising agencies spend 
a tremendous amount of money on the content side, but most agencies don't spend 
much money on the form," said Scott. He said the advice he received has 
dramatically improved his firm's presentations to new clients.

<P>
TIPS ON TALKS 
</P>
<P>
Consultants Christen Brown and Peter Lownds offer the following guidelines on 
public speaking: 
</P>
<P>
Learn to relax before making any presentation. 
</P>
<P>
Take deep breaths, inhaling to a count of five and exhaling to a count of 10. 
</P>
<P>
Stretch your whole body. 
</P>
<P>
Relax by rolling your neck in circles, three times in each direction. 
</P>
<P>
Shake your hands vigorously. 
</P>
<P>
Don't eat a heavy meal before a speaking engagement or interview. Digestion 
takes a lot of energy. 
</P>
<P>
Since cold water can constrict your vocal cords, sip room temperature water, 
preferably with a squirt of lemon juice, if you need to moisten your mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Fill your speech or presentation with illustrations and examples. 
</P>
<P>
Never memorize a speech. Know the exact beginning and the exact end and the 
middle will fill itself in. 
</P>
<P>
Make sure your gestures complement your words. 
</P>

Andersen Study Shows Owners Are Optimistic 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Arthur Andersen Enterprise Survey reveals some uplifting projections 
for small business in the 1990s. Andersen polled more than 4,500 chief 
executives on a variety of economic, social and business issues. The companies 
represent a cross-section of regions and industries, with sales ranging from $1 
million to $120 million. 
</P>
<P>
Almost two-thirds of the companies reported an increase in sales over 1988, 
with one-third growing 10% or more. Nearly 75% predict an increase in sales for 
1990. Nearly 85% of the employees at the companies surveyed can expect a raise 
in 1990, and employees at more than 80% of the companies received one this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
About 40% of the firms expanded their work force, but more than 80% said they 
were having trouble finding qualified managers and technical people. More than 
43% give U.S. public secondary schools a poor rating. 
</P>
<P>
More than three-quarters of the respondents said the recent flurry of leveraged 
buyouts is bad for business. However, almost 30% of those surveyed said they 
are considering selling their business and 69% said they would sell to a 
foreign investor. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based small businesses seem to take the best care of their 
employees. Fifty-eight percent of local firms surveyed provide between 96% and 
100% of their employees' health-care premiums, compared to 50% of respondents 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Of the Los Angeles respondents, 52% are involved in manufacturing and 21% are 
involved in both service and distribution. Most have been in business for 15 
years or more. 
</P>
<P>
Annual total compensation was concentrated in the $100,000 to $250,000 range. 
</P>
<P>

CALLENDER'S GETS NEW AD AGENCY TO AID IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marie Callender's, which says "Hello, Good Pie" on its billboards, said hello 
to a new ad agency on Thursday and goodby to its old one. 
</P>
<P>
The family-style restaurant chain handed its projected $3-million annual 
advertising account to the Los Angeles agency Kresser/Craig. Losing the account 
was the Santa Monica agency Suissa &amp; Associates, which said that blow was 
softened somewhat by its win Thursday of the estimated $2.5-million ad business 
for the Sports Connection health club chain. 
</P>
<P>
For Marie Callender's, which began as a Long Beach pie shop in 1948, the move 
is part of an overall attempt to update its image and separate it from other 
family restaurants. "As we move into the '90s, we will try to distinguish Marie 
Callender's from the rest of the crowd," said Neil Narhoff, the Orange-based 
chain's client director of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
That may take some doing. Industry analysts say family restaurants continue to 
lose customers to fast-food outlets as well as to the expanding deli sections 
at neighborhood grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
Even within its own category, Marie Callender's has recently begun to struggle. 
"Marie Callender's is over the hill in terms of being a hot concept," said John 
Hollingsworth, a Laguna Hills restaurant industry consultant. "They're an 
upgraded coffee shop." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, that's not what the new agency thinks. "It's a wonderful name that 
everyone knows," said Robert Kresser, chairman of Kresser/Craig. "Our first 
task will be to re-establish in the minds of consumers how valid Marie 
Callender's is as a restaurant for today." Kresser, whose agency also creates 
ads for Daihatsu America and Atlantic Richfield Co., said Marie Callender's 
"will become a far more aggressive advertiser." 
</P>
<P>
Some industry analysts contend that the problems at Marie Callender's have 
little to do with its advertising. They said the chain has built some very 
costly units at high-rent locations -- forcing it to charge relatively high 
prices for its food.

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market churned in place Thursday, getting little benefit from news of 
a smaller than expected U.S. trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 3.08 to 2,635.66. 
</P>
<P>
But declining issues slightly outnumbered advances in nationwide trading of New 
York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 735 up, 748 down and 498 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The business day began with a report from the Commerce Department that the 
nation's trade deficit contracted to $7.94 billion in September from $10.10 
billion the month before. 
</P>
<P>
The margin by which imports exceeded exports was the smallest in nearly five 
years and was well below most advance estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said some of the lackluster trading was due to anticipation of the 
expiration of stock-index options and futures today. 
</P>
<P>
Dun &amp; Bradstreet led the active list, down 2 at 42 1/2 on top of a 5 
3/4-point drop Wednesday, when the company said it expects to post lower 
earnings in 1990 as it revamps its credit-services business. 
</P>
<P>
Among actively traded blue chips, General Electric rose 3/4 to 57 1/2; Philip 
Morris gained 3/8 to 41 1/8, and American Express was up 1 1/8 at 34 5/8. But 
International Business Machines dropped 3/4 to 97 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
The General Services Administration said it was investigating IBM's sale to the 
government of used computer equipment marked as new. 
</P>
<P>
Expectations of lower interest rates helped electric utility issues gain 
ground, pushing the Dow Jones index of 15 utilities up 0.82 to 222.40, its 
highest close in more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume came to 148.37 million shares against Wednesday's 155.13 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo stocks posted a record close, continuing a seven-day rally in fairly 
heavy trading, but the gains were limited due to nervousness about recent 
climbs. The 225-share Nikkei index edged up 24.11 points to close at 35,876.34, 
its fourth consecutive record high. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices also rose on London's stock exchange, helped by some strong 
corporate earnings reports, takeover speculation and favorable economic news. 
The Financial Times 100-share index rose 6.4 points to 2,209.8. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell modestly amid conflicting interpretations of the decline in 
the U.S. merchandise trade deficit, which fell to the lowest level since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond fell 5/32 point, or about $1.50 for 
every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which rises when the price falls, rose 
to 7.86% from 7.85% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said the shrinkage in the trade deficit to $7.9 billion in 
September should have helped bond prices by bolstering the dollar. A strong 
dollar is good for bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Also, imports fell sharply, and that is usually good for bonds by indicating an 
economic slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
But pessimists decided that imports had fallen less than hoped, and they noted 
that exports rose. A rise in exports indicates economic strength, which is a 
negative for bonds because it can contribute to inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Bond investors decided that the trade report would not impel the Federal 
Reserve to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted late in the day at 8.50%, unchanged from late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rallied on news of a big improvement in the country's trade balance 
but finished below its best levels due to technically motivated selling. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices edged up in U.S. trading after posting sharp gains overseas. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery ended 
at $391.40 an ounce, up 10 cents from Wednesday's settlement. The Republic 
National Bank of New York quoted an ounce of gold at $391.30 as of 4 p.m. EST, 
40 cents higher than Wednesday's late bid. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar got off to a strong start in U.S. foreign exchange trading. It 
gained support from the merchandise trade deficit report. 
</P>
<P>
But the deficit's unexpectedly sharp decline caught some currency investors 
unprepared and forced them to adjust their holdings by selling dollars. The 
market had anticipated a deficit of about $8.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors that the Federal Reserve Board was selling dollars to mute the rally 
accentuated the downtrend that had been touched off by the technically oriented 
sales. The Fed never comments on any day-to-day currency transactions. Some 
dealers said they doubted the central bank had actually intervened. 
</P>
<P>
Mixed emotions about what the Commerce Department's trade report meant also 
snuffed out some of the enthusiasm to buy dollars. One interpretation was that 
the slowdown in imports underscored the weakness in U.S. economic growth, which 
would strengthen the case for lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
A decline in U.S. interest rates would tend to lessen demand for dollars and 
make returns on dollar-denominated investments less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar began its trading day in Tokyo with a rise of 0.48 Japanese yen to 
close at 143.85 yen. Later, in London, it edged up to 143.90 yen and rose to 
144.25 yen in New York from 143.795 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British pound fell to $1.5805 from $1.5810 late Wednesday. The 
pound fetched $1.5755 late in New York, compared to $1.5803 Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Grain and soybean futures prices rose on the Chicago Board of Trade amid hopes 
that the warming of U.S.-Soviet relations would lead to greater grain sales to 
the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts were skeptical, saying the Soviets already seem able to buy as 
much grain as they want. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets Thursday, coffee prices fell sharply; heating oil 
surged, leading the energy complex higher; precious metals were mixed, and 
livestock and meat futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, wheat futures settled 2.5 to 4 cents higher, with the contract for 
delivery in December at $4.075 a bushel; corn was 0.5 cent to 2 cents higher, 
with December at $2.4025 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2 cents higher, with 
December at $1.4725 a bushel, and soybeans were 3.5 to 5.50 cents higher, with 
November at $5.8425 a bushel.

'VALMONT': A NOT SO DANGEROUS 'LIAISONS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With "Valmont" (at the Coronet and Showcase), Milos Forman takes us back 
between the sheets of Choderlos de Laclos' great 18th-Century novel "Les 
Liaisons Dangereuses," back to all those seducers-with-abandon, and for a few 
lulling scenes he seems to be on to something. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the period, he's dropped the age of his sexual combatants, the 
Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont. They're now in their 20s, and 
their erotic machinations seem more like the careless intrigues of youth 
instead of the poisonous, knowing maneuvers of maturity. If it takes the 
"dangerous" out of the equation -- and it does, oh, how it does -- the reward 
is Annette Bening's dazzling Marquise, red-haired and purring-voiced. To have a 
Marquise with buoyancy and humor, whose sweet concern might even be sincere, is 
a startling idea; you can see how easily her fellow aristocrats might be taken 
in by this warm, beautiful young widow. In Stephen Frears' version last year, 
"Dangerous Liaisons," the wonder was that anyone would believe the Merteuil of 
Glenn Close for a second; her layers of deceit were so elaborate and so 
transparent. 
</P>
<P>
"Valmont" is gorgeous, and for a while you can coast on its costumes and 
production details. The novel's period has been moved back 50 years, turning 
things into a Watteau dream. But seductive as his surfaces are, Forman's tack 
doesn't hold for long. His changes have muted a great tale of betrayal by 
intelligence and he has blunted the malign inevitability of Laclos' story. 
</P>
<P>
By changing the fate of key characters, the innocent 15-year old Cecile 
(Fairuza Balk) and the deeply pious Madame de Tourvel (Meg Tilly), Forman and 
screenwriter Jean-Claude Carriere may have thought they were underlining the 
hypocrisy of the day. Instead, their conclusions are arch and obvious, like the 
wink from the elderly aunt at the film's end. 
</P>
<P>
The story unfolds roughly as before: The action is set in motion by the 
imminent marriage of convent-educated Cecile to Gercourt, the ongoing lover of 
the widowed Merteuil. To get even with Gercourt (Jeffrey Jones), Merteuil 
schemes to have his 15-year-old's virginity taken by her confidant and equal 
libertine, Valmont (Colin Firth). 
</P>
<P>
Valmont is bored with the assignment of seducing a child who would "probably 
flop on her back out of simple curiosity." Only when it becomes a bet between 
the two equals in deviousness does he agree to take it on. If he wins, he may 
claim Merteuil (although not for the first time) as payment; if he loses, he is 
to shut himself in a monastery and repent his sins. 
</P>
<P>
Visiting the estate of his elderly aunt Madame de Rosemont (Fabia Drake), 
Valmont unexpectedly finds a quarry of his own, the unshakeably faithful 
Tourvel, whose older husband, a judge, is away on business. This should be the 
story's tragic liaison, with shattering consequences; to have its effect 
trivialized is perhaps "Valmont's" worst sin. (Its R rating is for its ongoing 
seductions, sometimes accompanied by selective nudity.) 
</P>
<P>
Losing the great saga of Tourvel, we spend the first third of the film on 
Cecile and her entanglements. And since she goes on to one of the film's newly 
minted social triumphs, Cecile becomes little more than a John Hughes heroine 
in period clothes who learns that sex is fun and you don't have to tell all. 
Pfui. 
</P>
<P>
From the first, Forman moves to emphasize details, perhaps afraid we'd miss 
them. His adolescents -- Balk, who is 15, and Henry Thomas as her well-born 
harp teacher, the young Chevalier Danceny -- frisk about, skittering on the 
parquet floors. ("Return to Oz's" Dorothy and E.T.'s little pal, Elliot, as our 
young lovers? It's enough to make even baby boomers feel ancient.) 
</P>
<P>
Danceny can't pick up two things without dropping one of them, generally his 
harp. It's the same "endearing" klutziness Forman used in "Amadeus" and it's 
even less effective here. A chevalier of that day may have been young; he was 
also worldly, sophisticated and cultivated, which Forman won't let Thomas play. 
(He can be believably steely, however.) 
</P>
<P>
If we have a warm-blooded, believable Merteuil, casting Jeffrey Jones as her 
lover Gercourt is another mistake. Better to let Gercourt live in our 
imagination. Jones may be part of Forman's stock company, after his dim Emperor 
Josef II in "Amadeus," but why use his patented smugness here? Even taking into 
account Gercourt's closeness to the King, to have Merteuil involved with this 
popinjay makes her seem not calculating but masochistic. 
</P>
<P>
Colin Firth's Valmont is pleasant, a dreadful thing to say about one of 
literature's most magnetic seducers. Meg Tilly's translucence is more than 
wasted here; for the first time, it is tiresome. It is lovely to see Sian 
Phillips as Cecile's rightly alarmed mother, and Fabia Drake's grand, worldly 
Madame de Rosemont, forever being awakened to discover that her card-playing 
companions have tip-toed away, is the film's bright-eyed Doormouse. 
</P>
<P>
But to consider "Valmont" in the light of Baudelaire's words on "Les Liaisons 
Dangereuses" -- "This book, if it burns, must burn like ice" -- is to see just 
how far down this ice has been watered.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: A TALE OF TWO MINISERIES -- ONE GOOD, ONE BAD; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THERE ARE STRIKING PARALLELS BETWEEN DICKENS' 'TALE OF TWO CITIES' 
AND JUDITH KRANTZ'S 'TILL WE MEET AGAIN,' BUT QUALITY IS NOT ONE OF THEM.

Who says television lacks diversity? 
</P>
<P>
This weekend brings the best of timeslots and the worst of timeslots, the 
Sunday of wisdom and the Sunday of foolishness, the network of belief and the 
network of incredulity, the miniseries of light and the miniseries of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, we will have everything before us (Charles Dickens' "A Tale of Two 
Cities" on PBS) and we will have nothing before us (Judith Krantz's "Till We 
Meet Again" on CBS). 
</P>
<P>
Yet there are striking parallels in these two works of historical fiction. 
</P>
<P>
Just as Dickens' two cities are Paris and London, Krantz's story is set in 
France and Britain, in addition to California. Both also interweave romance and 
violence, and both are written by famous authors (Dickens, as it turned out, 
writing for the ages, and Krantz, the Bob's Big Boy of contemporary 
literature). What's more, the "wilderness of ruin, misery and oppression" that 
Dickens applies to pre-revolutionary France also characterizes "Till We Meet 
Again," which, as a bonus, is also a wilderness of mush. 
</P>
<P>
If Dickens has the overwhelming numerical edge in heartless French aristocrats 
and vengeance-blinded revolutionaries, Krantz gives us her own epic French cad 
in Bruno the snot, whose actions in "Till We Meet Again" echo the credo of the 
Marquis St. Evremonde in "Tale of Two Cities": "Repression is the only lasting 
philosophy." More about Bruno shortly. 
</P>
<P>
But first (at 9 p.m. on Channels 28 and 15 and 8 p.m. on Channels 50 and 24), 
this new adaptation of "A Tale of Two Cities," produced as a four-parter by 
Britain's Granada Television and the French Dune and Antenne 2 to commemorate 
last July's 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. The stage here is 
"Masterpiece Theatre." 
</P>
<P>
Channel 28 is airing Parts 1 and 2 back to back and -- to accommodate a Nov. 26 
concert telecast live by San Francisco's KQED to benefit Bay Area earthquake 
victims -- skipping a week before returning with the concluding two parts on 
Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
To capsulize "A Tale of Two Cities": 
</P>
<P>
As the rotting nobility is about to be toppled and annihilated by the 
long-suffering French people, Charles Darnay (Xavier Deluc) and 
brilliant-but-degenerate London lawyer Sidney Carton (James Wilby) fall in love 
with the luminous Lucie Manette (Serena Gordon), whose elderly physician father 
(Jean-Pierre Aumont) has just been freed from the Bastille after being locked 
away for 18 years. Lucie marries Darnay, an idealistic French aristocrat who 
has renounced his family name of St. Evremonde out of shame, and lives in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
The revolution erupts, and aristocrats are paraded to the guillotine en masse. 
Drawn back to Paris, Darnay is unjustly held accountable for his family's 
crimes and ordered executed. Now it's time for Carton to rev up, as he 
heroically fulfills his vow to Lucie to give his life "for you -- or anyone you 
love." 
</P>
<P>
There's lots to like here. Adapted for TV by Arthur Hopcraft and directed by 
Philippe Monnier, "A Tale of Two Cities" is grandly staged and a nice way to 
spend an evening. The climactic last half hour -- in which Carton gives meaning 
to his life by sacrificing it -- is beautifully done. Moreover, you have to 
admire Hopcraft's humanized Madame Defarge (Kathie Kriegel), who remains 
pitiless without being mindlessly maniacal. Most of the major players are fine, 
but it's Jean-Marc Bory who almost steals the first hour as Darnay's doomed 
uncle, the unredeemably cruel marquis. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, there are visible seams that distract. The editing is at times 
disjointed, the romance sequences just a little bit static and Aumont's 
dottering old Dr. Manette too broad to be credible. This "A Tale of Two Cities" 
nicely captures the emotion of Carton's rebirth. What's missing is passion, a 
convincing portrayal of the revolution's blind fury that stained the streets 
with blood. 
</P>
<P>
Passion -- of another sort -- is available on CBS Sunday. Depending on your 
point of view, "Till We Meet Again" (9 p.m. on Channels 2 and 8, with Part 2 
airing at 8 p.m. Tuesday) is either too bad to watch or too bad to ignore. 
Television has rarely been funnier. 
</P>
<P>
This is no less than a festival of dumbness as it traces the tumultuous lives 
of a mother and two daughters, and, of course, the men they love. 
</P>
<P>
We meet Eve (Lucy Gutteridge) in 1913 as a rebellious 17-year-old French girl 
who runs away to the big city and becomes a dance hall singer. Her friend tells 
her: "Soon you will conquer Paris." Two years later, she is en route to 
entertain French troops on the Western Front when she is forced to take refuge 
in a barn from German shells. Then the door flies open, and it's dashing Capt. 
Paul de Lancel (Michael York) -- heir to a French champagne dynasty -- and his 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers sit down. Eve sings to them. The soldiers fall asleep. A sign. 
Even the violins sound bored. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Charles Jarrott and adapted by Andrew Paul Martin, "Till We Meet 
Again" is a Rolodex of cliches -- one comical, badly acted scene after another. 
Paul's first wife shoots herself in the head, and there's no blood. Later, two 
hours into his first date with Eve, Paul proposes and she accepts. It's that 
kind of show. 
</P>
<P>
Their two daughters go in different directions, Delphine (Mia Sara) as an 
actress in Paris, and Freddy (Courteney Cox) as a pilot in the United States 
and in Britain during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The family black sheep is Paul's son by his first marriage, Bruno the snot 
(Hugh Grant), a sniffy, malicious, power-mad snob who despises his own family, 
is thrilled when the Germans occupy France and later commits unspeakable acts. 
Do you hear, UNSPEAKABLE!!! At least Bruno the snot gets your attention. 
</P>
<P>
Although spanning 43 years and several nationalities, "Till We Meet Again" has 
no sense of period or texture: Not only is Eve's face as vacant as a 
cantaloupe, she doesn't age except for a few gray hairs. Meanwhile, Paul and 
Eve are French, yet he speaks English with a British accent and she with a 
cultured American accent. Bruno the snot only briefly budges from France, yet 
oozes Oxford. This is especially confusing when the British-sounding French 
characters are in Britain, or California. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the accent hasn't been invented that could improve this dialogue. 
Here is French director Armand Sadowski (Charles Shaughnessy) rejecting 
Delphine's offer of a kiss: "No. First I must undress you, button . . . by . . 
. button." And here's that big lug Jock Hampton (Bruce Boxleitner) all ga-ga 
over Freddy: "You beautiful, wonderful handful!" Your eyes fill with tears. 
</P>
<P>
A tale of two miniseries. In choosing one, remember: It is a far, far better 
thing that Charles Dickens does, than Judith Krantz has ever done.

PUIG'S 'BOUQUET': TRIUMPH OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anne Bancroft is the one with the "nervous disorder," but it's Jane Alexander 
who has the case of nerves in Manuel Puig's "Mystery of the Rose Bouquet," in 
its American premiere at the Mark Taper Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The two meet in Bancroft's white-on-white suite in a luxurious Agentine 
psychiatric hospital. Bancroft is a rich, fractious old lady suffering from a 
depression brought on by the death of her favorite grandson in an auto 
accident. Alexander is an inexperienced nurse who needs this case, but isn't 
sure she's going to be able to handle this patient. 
</P>
<P>
But not so fast. It's also possible that Alexander is a vastly experienced 
psychiatric nurse who knows exactly what persona to assume in order to arouse 
the curiosity of a stubborn old woman and to get her to start eating. 
</P>
<P>
Interesting premise, no? And it leads to a graceful and life-affirming play. As 
he did in "Kiss of the Spider Woman," Puig shuts up two dissimilar people in a 
room and, in effect, throws away the key. And again, defying the rule that puts 
conflict at the heart of drama, the interest is to see how quickly they arrive 
at a relationship, in fact, a friendship. 
</P>
<P>
For the Desmond Morrises of this world, humanity's dominant instinct is a 
selfish one: the territorial imperative. In Puig's opinion, what we really want 
is somebody to talk to. 
</P>
<P>
And to pretend with. As in "Spider Woman" there's a heavy use of the 
subjunctive mood: memories, nightmares, fantasies -- here's where the rose 
bouquet comes in -- and daydreams. Some of these may bother the logical viewer. 
What is Alexander doing in Bancroft's dream about her dead sister? 
</P>
<P>
A psychological explanation can be devised, but the real reason is theatrical. 
This is a two-character play. No intruders wanted. We want to see how well the 
players will manage the imaginary roles, as well as the real ones. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander's "real" identity is, of course, one of the play's big questions. Who 
is she when she goes off duty? Whom does she go home to? Does she let Bancroft 
assist her in her romantic fantasies as a sort of therapy project for the old 
lady -- or does she, in fact, need a facilitator for her dreams? 
</P>
<P>
Who is helping whom here? And what's up with Bancroft? By now she realizes that 
her nurse isn't all she seems; or rather that she is quite a lot more than she 
seems. Why doesn't Bancroft speak up? 
</P>
<P>
Because it would ruin the game. Fantasy and game-playing in "Who's Afraid of 
Virginia Woolf?" are seen as neurosis. For Puig, games make the world go 'round 
and fantasies are the vehicle of truth. All that counts is that the game be 
played with kindness. For all that we don't understand about these two women, 
we do understand that they wish each other well. 
</P>
<P>
Actresses Bancroft and Alexander take the Taper stage in just that spirit. 
Under Robert Allen Ackerman's direction, they don't play against each other, 
but for each other, keeping us within the circle of the play's belief. 
</P>
<P>
Do we believe Bancroft's old lady as much as we do Alexander's nurse? Probably 
not. From the very beginning of the play, she's too sharp, too involved with 
life, to read as a depressed personality. Her appetite is there, even when she 
can't eat a thing. 
</P>
<P>
There's a slight problem too with that Bronx accent, which Bancroft hasn't 
taken any trouble to modify. This keeps yanking us back from Argentina, in a 
way that Alexander's neutral accent doesn't. The old lady's shrewdness is 
wonderfully observed, though. It's a sharp and entertaining performance, with 
the detail work still to come. 
</P>
<P>
The nurse's role is one that an actress could play for weeks without 
exhausting. Right now, Alexander makes us thoroughly accept the unconfident 
nurse that we see, with only the occasional hint -- the efficient way she 
manages the blinds, for example -- that we are dealing with a consummate drama 
therapist here. 
</P>
<P>
In later performances, perhaps the nurse's "mystery" will be more evident. But 
Alexander and director Ackerman seem to feel that the ultimate subtlety is to 
play her as simply as possible, and they may be right. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, we feel the character's goodness. She's like one of those wise 
figures in Pirandello who tell us to stop putting names on things -- "truth," 
"untruth" -- and to trust life's healing process. As with "Spider Woman," we 
take the point that human instinct is a more reliable guide than words, 
especially words at the service of some system. The play is as small and 
consoling as a nightlight -- and Arden Fingerhut's lighting is as finespun as 
silk. 
</P>
<P>
 Performances Tuesdays-Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 7:30 p.m., with 
Saturday-Sunday matinees at 2:30. Closes Dec. 17. Tickets $22-$28; (213) 
410-1062 or (714) 634-1300.

JIM MURRAY: HE FEEDS THE PUBLIC A MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Usually, when a manager finishes fourth in a six-team division, he gets to buy 
his own dinner all winter. He can't get anybody to have a cup of coffee with 
him. His phone gets cobwebbed, his dog avoids him and the only way he can get 
anybody to listen or talk to him is to ring up Dial-A-Prayer. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Tommy Lasorda. He hasn't had a home-cooked meal since the Carter 
Administration. If somebody accidentally bangs a fork on a glass, he jumps up 
and begins to shout what a great country this is and how lucky it is to have 
the Dodgers in it. 
</P>
<P>
His one-week itinerary would exhaust Marco Polo. He is constantly in furious 
motion, either on an airplane or on a dais. He gets five hours' sleep a night, 
maximum. 
</P>
<P>
He is baseball's traveling salesman with a kit full of cliches, homilies, 
mottoes, words to live by. His spiel is constant. Everybody can win the 
pennant, even if the Dodgers didn't. God is a Dodger, but He's open-minded. 
Only in America would all this be possible. Winning isn't everything but losing 
is nothing. 
</P>
<P>
He never speaks in a normal tone of voice. Lasorda always sounds like a guy 
who's lost in a blizzard and is shouting into an echo for his party. He always 
manages to sound as if he is screaming at an umpire who just called his cleanup 
hitter out on a third strike in the bottom of the ninth with two gone and the 
bases loaded. He treats the world as if it were hard of hearing or not paying 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda is like an oncoming train. You hear it long before it comes into view. 
His decibel level could warn ships off rocks. 
</P>
<P>
He used to have the most nearly perfect silhouette ever devised for a baseball 
manager. He looked like an egg with legs, Humpty-Dumpty in cleats. Hollywood 
couldn't have cast the part more perfectly. He was America's Manager. Part of 
the drama. 
</P>
<P>
When a call went against him, he was King Lear. When he won, he was as 
emotional as the overture to "Aida." He was as verbal as a sidewalk vendor 
hawking vegetable peelers. No one ever came out of his office without a full 
notebook. 
</P>
<P>
When most people lose weight, only their doctors know. When Lasorda lost 
weight, he let the whole world in on it. He huckstered Slim Fast as shamelessly 
as he huckstered his team and his game. He made more money out of not eating 
than the Aga Khan used to get stuffing himself for the diamond scales. He was 
the most famous thin man since William Powell had the part. 
</P>
<P>
Still, I thought I might find him in his carpet slippers, watching daytime TV, 
or walking the dog, when I called him at home recently. I had heard he was to 
be on the spit at a roast at Bally's Casino Resort in Las Vegas Saturday for 
the Barbara Sinatra Children's Center in Rancho Mirage, a shelter for 
emotionally and physically abused children. I wondered if they had to get him 
out of mothballs for the event. 
</P>
<P>
"MOTHBALLS!" he roared. (I didn't really need the earpiece. He was only in 
Fullerton.) 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had time to unpack since the season! I was the Orange County 
professional sportsman of the year for about the fifth time! I flew to New York 
to the New York Athletic Club! Then I flew home! 
</P>
<P>
"Then I was at the Downtown Athletic Club in New York. I was their man of the 
year! I'm leaving tomorrow for Oklahoma City! Then I go to Vegas. I was the 
grand marshal at the Columbus Day parade. 
</P>
<P>
"Tuesday I went to the state department (puff, puff) then I went to New York 
University, then (puff, puff), I drove to Philadelphia, that night (puff, 
puff). I spoke at Jersey City. I went to bed at 2 a.m., I got up at 6 a.m. 
(puff, puff). 
</P>
<P>
"I flew to the Air Force Academy in Colorado, I spoke to 3,000 cadets at noon 
and (puff, puff) they put me on the board of directors of the Air Force 
Academy. at 6:30, I talked to the football team (puff, puff). 
</P>
<P>
"The next morning I flew back to Washington (puff, puff) for the national 
Italian-American foundation dinner for me and Danny Aiello and a dinner for the 
president of Italy (puff, puff). Imagine! Me at a dinner for the president of 
Italy! 
</P>
<P>
"Then I went to Cherry Hill, N.J., for a dinner and home to Norristown." 
</P>
<P>
I had to come up for air. 
</P>
<P>
"Wait a minute! Have we got a bad connection?" I asked. "There's this wheezing 
on the line." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm on a treadmill!" Lasorda roared. "I have to walk an hour a day (puff, 
puff), four to eight miles a day! Wait a minute, I'm going to turn it up. It's 
(puff, puff) like walking up Everest! 
</P>
<P>
"What do I do while I'm walking (puff, puff)? I watch TV and talk on the phone. 
I'm on a 12 elevation right now. It's like walking up the Empire State 
Building! Physically, I can't believe how great I feel. I'm 62, but I feel like 
they got the numbers mixed. I feel like I'm 26! 
</P>
<P>
"What a great story this is! This dinner is not only for the Barbara Sinatra 
center, but for the Sisters of Mercy in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
"Listen! Is this a miracle? When I found out they were going to lose their 
home, I said, 'Where will you go?' and they said they didn't know but God would 
provide. They prayed for a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
"And then two of my ballplayers, Kirk Gibson and Orel Hershiser, say they will 
give me $10,000 apiece if I will lose 20 pounds and another $10,000 if I will 
lose 30 pounds. And I give the money to the sisters. All of a sudden, their new 
home is a reality! 
</P>
<P>
"But, here is the best part! I lose the weight and three things happen: 1. I 
feel better; 2. They get a new convent, and 3. Thousands of people lose weight 
because of me. 
</P>
<P>
"And, on Nov. 30, I'm going back to Nashville for an all-star show at the Grand 
Ole Opry and we're going to have our new convent! A miracle! Only in America! 
</P>
<P>
"What? The team? We'll be great! We're in conversation with Mark Langston. What 
an outstanding young man! He was born to pitch for the Dodgers! 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know we were involved in 78 one-run games last season? Do you know we 
lost 80 games by two runs or less? I can't wait for opening day! 
</P>
<P>
"But, meantime, I have to go to Toledo, Chicago (puff, puff) and, of course, 
back to Nashville." 
</P>
<P>
Puff, puff.

IT'S DANGEROUS FROM THE START; 
</P>
<P>
GYMNASTICS: SOME OFFICIALS AND COACHES WONDER IF THE SPECTACULAR YURCHENKO 
VAULT IS WORTH THE RISK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kelly Garrison knew the risk every time she ran down the runway toward the 
vaulting horse. 
</P>
<P>
She knew that proper timing and accuracy were a must in international 
gymnastics and that the slightest slip could mean the difference between 
winning and losing, or between winning and injury. 
</P>
<P>
But while training at the University of Oklahoma for the 1988 Olympics, 
Garrison decided to take an extra risk. 
</P>
<P>
Her hopes of making the team had been sinking, along with her vaulting scores. 
She lacked the power on her takeoff and was earning low scores on the vault, 
which in turn dropped her all-around results. 
</P>
<P>
So in 1987, Garrison began experimenting with the Yurchenko, a roundoff entry 
to the vault named after Soviet gymnast Natalia Yurchenko, who introduced it in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take Garrison long to learn the maneuver. She built up plenty of 
speed on her approach run, then whipped into a roundoff cartwheel just before 
landing backward on the springboard for her takeoff. The Yurchenko gave her the 
extra momentum she needed to be competitive, and it helped her land a spot on 
the Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a drastic improvement," said Garrison, who scored a 9.8 with a 
Yurchenko at the Seoul Olympics. "I had been a weak vaulter, scoring around 9.4 
and 9.5. It really helped my all-around score." 
</P>
<P>
But as her scores increased, so did the risk. The roundoff entry had little 
margin for error, and when Garrison missed the springboard or slipped off, she 
sailed backward, headfirst, into the vaulting horse. 
</P>
<P>
"I crashed probably about 30 or 40 times (in training)," she said. "I had a lot 
of bruises, but nothing serious. I'm very fortunate, as many times as I landed 
on my head." 
</P>
<P>
But some others haven't been as fortunate: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Julissa Gomez, a member of the U.S. national team, slipped when practicing 
a Yurchenko at the World Sports Fair in Tokyo on May 5, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Her foot fell off the back of the springboard and she sailed backward, 
headfirst, into the vaulting horse. 
</P>
<P>
She suffered a hyper-extended neck, then fell into a coma at a Tokyo hospital 
after an oxygen hose slipped off a tracheotomy tube. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen months after her accident, Gomez, 16, is still in a coma. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Karen Tierney broke a vertebra in her neck while attempting a Yurchenko at 
the 1987 U.S. Olympic Festival in Raleigh, N.C. Tierney recovered and still 
practices the vault daily. 
</P>
<P>
Some gymnasts and coaches say those accidents should never have happened. They 
say they're tired of seeing young U.S. gymnasts trying high-risk moves, such as 
the Yurchenko, to keep up with their competition. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Lou Retton used a conventional approach -- a simple run to the end of the 
takeoff board -- when she scored two 10s on the vault to win the all-around 
title in the 1984 Olympics. She calls the Yurchenko a short cut to high scores. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they weed out the best vaulters (with) the Yurchenko," she said. 
"Gymnasts don't need much speed when they throw a roundoff. I really don't care 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
But even the conventional approach has proven risky. Adriana Duffy, a member of 
the Puerto Rican national team who also competed for Stanford, suffered a 
broken neck recently doing a conventional vault at the World Championships in 
Stuttgart, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Svetlana Boginskaia of the Soviet Union, who used a Yurchenko when she won the 
gold medal in vaulting at the 1988 Olympics, said there's little risk with the 
roundoff approach. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a problem with it," she said through an interpreter last Sunday 
while participating in an exhibition at the Forum. "It's an easy vault for me. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a vault that's very much in style. Almost everyone is using it now. Maybe 
someone should come up with a new vault." 
</P>
<P>
Olga Korbut, the star of the 1972 Olympics when she made women's gymnastics a 
glamour sport with her back flip off the uneven parallel bars, has watched 
women's gymnastics blossom in the Soviet Union in the last 17 years. She said 
that complex moves such as the Yurchenko have a small place in gymnastics. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's the element that is dangerous, but how the athletes 
approach them," she said. "There have been a lot of changes in gymnastics that 
do not gladden my heart. I feel that the complexity of the (elements) have 
overshadowed the femininity of gymnastics." 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma Coach Becky Buwick, who helped Garrison learn the Yurchenko, said the 
roundoff entry is a flashy alternative to conventional vaulting. Gymnasts score 
between 9.4 and 10 with a roundoff entry, depending on the difficulty of the 
vault. 
</P>
<P>
"With Kelly being an old-timer (she was 21 at the time), not having a 
(Yurchenko) would have been a good reason to keep her off the (Olympic) team," 
Buwick said. "Everyone was using them. We were definitely pressured to make 
sure she was keeping up with the (younger Americans) and the Soviets." 
</P>
<P>
The Yurchenko is banned by the NCAA, and Buwick hopes it stays that way. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we never see it at the college level unless there are some big-time 
changes in equipment," Buwick said. "The bottom line is that they need to do 
something with the equipment before it will be safe to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a beautiful vault, but a dangerous one." 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the Gomez tragedy, the U.S. Gymnastics Federation banned the 
Yurchenko at level 10 -- the highest class a gymnast can reach before moving on 
to Olympic training -- so it could be studied. The USGF still allows the 
Yurchenko at the Olympic, national and elite levels. 
</P>
<P>
Don McPherson, who owns a gym in Lombard, Ill., recently wrote a letter to USGF 
officials asking that the Yurchenko be banned at all levels. He said the 
maneuver is too risky and he won't allow the 220 gymnasts he coaches to try it. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing of going after the Russians is ridiculous," he said. "It's 
like E.F. Hutton. When (the Soviets) talk, we listen and scramble back to our 
gyms to work on it. It's a disservice to teach them the (Yurchenko) vault." 
</P>
<P>
But coaches and athletes who work with the Yurchenko say that the move is only 
another frontier in gymnastics, and that progress and risks are part of the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
Don Peters, owner of SCATS Gymnastics in Huntington Beach, said the Yurchenko 
is worth the risk. Peters, who has coached Olympians Kathy Johnson and Pam 
Bileck, said that at least 20 of his gymnasts use the Yurchenko. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not any more dangerous than 30 or 40 other (gymnastic maneuvers)," he 
said. "But it has to be approached cautiously." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Sands, who has a doctorate in exercise physiology and is the director of 
sports sciences for women with the USGF, said the vault is one of the safest 
events in gymnastics. Only 5% of all gymnastic injuries occur on the vault, and 
most injuries are to ankles and wrists, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sands, a former assistant coach at Utah, directed a study on the Yurchenko for 
the USGF after Gomez was injured. He broke down the approach biomechanically 
and found that the Yurchenko doesn't necessarily give a gymnast extra momentum 
off the springboard. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't appear to have an enormous amount of velocity," he said. "But the 
Yurchenko makes it easier to do certain (vaults) well . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Yurchenko accidents usually occur when gymnasts land either too far forward on 
the springboard or when their feet slip off the back, as Gomez's did. 
</P>
<P>
Peters said that the USGF has required a foam mat installed around the 
springboard to provide extra cushion should a gymnast's foot slip off the back 
of the board. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of teaching the vault to older, more mature gymnasts, Peters said he 
would rather take a youngster and develop the Yurchenko over a long period of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet coaches begin simulating Yurchenkos with gymnasts as young as 8 and they 
have been developing the vault since the 1970s, McPherson said. 
</P>
<P>
Injury statistics for the Eastern Bloc countries aren't available, but even its 
creator discovered how risky it can be. 
</P>
<P>
Yurchenko, the Soviet gymnast, used her maneuver to win the all-around at the 
1983 World Championships. The next day, she broke both ankles when she landed 
while attempting the same vault in the individual event finals. 
</P>
<P>
Yurchenko continued to use the vault after her injuries, however, as did 
Garrison. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the accidents during training, Garrison was glad she used the 
Yurchenko. 
</P>
<P>
"There's risk anymore in all the skills," she said. "It's just a matter of 
working on them consistently. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good vault. There are many things that can still be done with it. 
Originality is such an important part of gymnastics right now." 
</P>
<P>
But her coach, Buwick, said she isn't sure if the risk is worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who knows of Julissa Gomez's injury knows that it's a nightmare you 
have as a coach," Buwick said. "Every night, when I go to turn off the lights 
in the gym and leave, I stop and thank God that nothing like that happened." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND In the 1972 Olympics, 17-year-old Olga Korbut of the Soviet Union 
wowed audiences with her spectacular display on the uneven bars, punctuated by 
an unprecedented back flip on the landing. In that competition, the teen-ager 
changed the appeal of women's gymnastics. It became big box office, and 
gymnasts soon found themselves doing increasingly risky routines on all of the 
events, sometimes with tragic results.

DELPINO A BARGAIN IN RAM BACKFIELD; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: LUXURY CARS ABOUND AMONG THE RUNNING BACKS, BUT THE TEAM'S 
SECOND-LEADING RUSHER DRIVES A FORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this week's episode of life styles of rich and famous Rams, Robert Delpino, 
the second-year fullback from Dodge City, Kan., realizes he's the only man in 
the Rams' backfield driving a Ford. 
</P>
<P>
In order of yards gained this season, in fact, it's Greg Bell, Mercedes-Benz; 
Delpino, Mustang; Cleveland Gary, Mercedes; Gaston Green, Mercedes, and Buford 
McGee, BMW. 
</P>
<P>
In the speculative world of judging football talent, it all boils down to 
plain, lousy, fifth-round luck. Delpino, we now know, is much more luxury 
vehicle than sedan. But under the National Football League's system, you are 
what you're drafted. First-rounders get rich. Fifth-rounders get Fords. 
</P>
<P>
Why Delpino lasted eight picks into the fifth round in 1988 is a mystery in 
this age of unlimited budgets and sophisticated scouting services. 
</P>
<P>
To the Rams' credit, they memet Delpino face to face. Coach John Robinson and 
scout Lawrence McCutcheon stopped by Columbia, Mo. -- it's not as easy as it 
sounds -- on their way back from Oklahoma State, where they had taken a hard 
look at tailback Thurman Thomas, ultimately deciding against drafting him 
because of a knee problem. (Robinson's updated opinion: "I regret that.") 
</P>
<P>
"I came away with a sense that (Delpino) was a violent football player," 
Robinson said. "And some violent things happened when he was around." 
</P>
<P>
Five rounds and Gaston Green later, the Rams squeezed Delpino onto their draft 
board. 
</P>
<P>
"It was nothing personal," Delpino concedes. "It was just the system; me never 
being a running back until my senior season in college; me coming from a losing 
program; me growing up in the Midwest. I was kind of a hidden name. I wasn't 
out there much." 
</P>
<P>
Delpino is the Rams' second-leading rusher with 173 yards and a 4.9-yard 
average. He has also caught 15 passes for 154 yards while continuing to play 
well on special teams. 
</P>
<P>
Delpino attacks the game head-on, playing with the intensity of someone who has 
had to fight for every yard and every cent. 
</P>
<P>
He has. Last year he came to camp and stood behind Bell, Charles White, Mike 
Guman, McGee, Tim Tyrrell and Green, the 14th overall pick who was being paid 
$1.85 million over four years. 
</P>
<P>
Delpino, who checked in at $333,500 for three years, pored over the odds and 
decided that his only shot was on special teams. 
</P>
<P>
"We were stacked," he said of the running back situation. "After mini-camp was 
over, I went home and told myself to concentrate on other areas, meaning 
special teams." 
</P>
<P>
He ended up as the Rams' rookie of the year for 1988 and was named the league's 
special teams player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a name for myself on special teams, and I got a big ol' trophy. It 
looks like a Heisman Trophy," Delpino said, laughing. "I'm damn proud of it. 
But you get to a point where you want to get off special teams and be more 
involved in the offense, to make more money, to provide for the team." 
</P>
<P>
The battles continue. Last year, he out-dueled the first-rounder, Green, at 
every turn, and figured to make even more inroads this season. 
</P>
<P>
Then came draft day in April. Coach John Robinson, asked why he had by-passed 
Miami fullback Cleveland Gary with the 21st pick to take defensive end Bill 
Hawkins, said Delpino was everything he needed in a fullback. 
</P>
<P>
Five picks later, though, Robinson took Gary with the 26th pick. Delpino, 
watching the draft at home with his girlfriend, nearly choked on his generic 
potato chips. 
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked," he said. "I didn't know the exact position we stood as far as 
running backs, but I didn't think we needed him. Not a first-rounder. 
</P>
<P>
"Me and Buford McGee were talking about that. We had the same reaction. My 
mouth was wide open. It was my second year, and I'm going to have to do it all 
over again. He does much the same thing I do, the same role. 
</P>
<P>
"But here he is, a first-rounder, and here I am, a fifth-rounder, so I was kind 
of interested to see what was going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Delpino said his girlfriend turned to him and asked for an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"I said I didn't know," he said. "My head was spinning. I was surprised, 
shocked, dismayed and all those great words. The difference was the big money 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
Gary signed a four-year, $1.8-million deal. Delpino is making $80,000 this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Delpino has held off his latest challenge, although Gary appears closer to 
making an impact. 
</P>
<P>
Delpino's relentlessness has forced the Rams to reconsider the future. Robinson 
is already talking seriously about dumping his vaunted I-formation in favor of 
multiple-back sets. 
</P>
<P>
Delpino can't help but consider the financial differences among the backs, 
especially Green, who plays so sparingly and dresses so smartly that he might 
consider coming out with his own line of inactive wear. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't help but think about it, to be honest," Delpino said. "I think about 
it a lot. But I do work hard enough to where somebody will take notice, and 
maybe I'll get what's coming to me -- more money." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jim Everett's back continues to bother him, although it seems almost certain 
that he will start against Phoenix on Sunday. Before Thursday's practice, 
though, John Robinson painted a bleaker picture. "If we said he was out of the 
game, we'd activate (Jeff) Carlson or send out a helicopter for (Steve) Dils," 
Robinson said. Everett, however, threw painlessly in practice and announced 
himself fit for the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Everett missed Wednesday's practice to have his back checked at Centinela 
Hospital Medical Center, where X-rays proved negative. Everett is also seeing a 
chiropractor, Robert Moore of Irvine, and is doing special exercises to 
strengthen his stomach muscles. "It's probably similar to what Joe Montana was 
doing," Everett said. The San Francisco quarterback had major back surgery a 
few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Everett's condition appears only temporary. "He's got a strained back," 
Robinson said. "Like you or I would have a strained back from lifting a garbage 
can." . . . The Rams fell 12,953 tickets shy of selling out, meaning Sunday's 
game will be blacked out locally.

HUNTINGTON BEACH, LA PUENTE PLAYOFF APPEALS DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-four hours before its big game, Huntington Beach High School was thrown 
out of the playoffs Thursday by appellate court justices who lectured the 
team's booster club attorneys on the importance of playing by the rules. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach had been cited by the California Interscholastic Federation's 
Southern Section as having played tackle David Roman, 17, who was ineligible 
because he lived with a brother instead of his mother since moving from 
Maryland. Rules require that an athlete live with a parent or legal guardian 
upon transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Savanna High School of Anaheim, which also was barred Tuesday from 
the playoffs because of an ineligible player, is due in court today to seek 
reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
And Pomona Superior Court Judge Thomas Nuss denied La Puente High School's 
attempt to be in the playoffs. La Puente also had been disqualified because of 
an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
Because the La Puente request was denied, Covina Northview, the No. 3 team in 
Valle Vista League, will play top-seeded Hacienda Heights Wilson, the No. 1 
team from the Sierra League, tonight at Wilson High. 
</P>
<P>
And coach Dick Bruich of Fontana High, the top-rated football team in the 
Southern Section, said: "We spent two days preparing for Huntington, two days 
for Fountain Valley. We spent today preparing for Huntington." 
</P>
<P>
Now, it's Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
In the Huntington Beach case, a three-judge panel of the 4th District Court of 
Appeal unanimously sided with Sunset League officials who had disqualified the 
Oilers from the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe what's suffering is respect for rules," interjected Associate Justice 
Edward J. Wallin during a hearing held in the Santa Ana court. "What you're 
really attacking is the whole CIF (California Interscholastic Federation) book 
of rules, aren't you?"

NEWSWIRE: BASS SIGNS 3-YEAR CONTRACT WITH GIANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Outfielder Kevin Bass of the Houston Astros signed a $5.25-million, three-year 
contract with the San Francisco Giants Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The first of 90 free agents to switch teams this year, Bass said he chose the 
Giants because they gave him a no-trade clause. Bass, who lives in the Bay 
Area, said it was a "once-in-a-lifetime" opportunity to play for both a 
pennant-winner and his hometown team. 
</P>
<P>
Bass already has been told that he will bat second in Manager Roger Craig's 
lineup, between Brett Butler and Will Clark.

SPECIALTY MODELS PUT THEIR CAREERS IN GOOD HANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PRESTON LERNER, Lerner is a Burbank-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Photographers, art directors, account executives and food stylists are crammed 
around the massive camera anchored in the center of the studio. All of their 
eyes are riveted on model Don Maderich. Or, more properly, on Maderich's hands. 
</P>
<P>
Maderich is co-starring -- from the wrist down -- in a photo-shoot for a 
restaurant chain. He's being paid $150 an hour to hold a tortilla in one hand 
and a fork in the other. Like most aspects of modeling, it's not as easy as it 
sounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Roll your pinky in on your left hand," photographer Dennis Skinner commands. 
"Now, squeeze the fork a little tighter. Push your fingertips in a little. 
That's good, Don. Now move your hand down a little. Now turn this way. Can you 
turn that way? Now slide in there a little. OK, that's good." 
</P>
<P>
"It might make a better hand like this," Maderich says, repositioning his 
fingers ever so slightly. 
</P>
<P>
"That's better," Skinner admits. Then an art director adds, "The hand with the 
fork is great." 
</P>
<P>
Maderich beams with pleasure as he contemplates yet another satisfied client. 
During the last 15 years, his hands have been featured in thousands of print 
advertisements and television commercials. He's typed for Apple Computers, 
caressed fannies for Ditto Jeans, signed checks for Bank of America, delivered 
pizza for Godfather's, poured wine for Gallo, flipped tops for Pepsi, even 
scratched off winning numbers for Lotto. With all due respect to the Dodger 
blue-bloods of Chavez Ravine, he's got two of the best-known mitts in town. 
</P>
<P>
Maderich is one of Los Angeles' top hand models. Although their names are 
unknown outside the advertising industry, their work can be seen everywhere -- 
on magazine covers, television, movie posters, billboards, product labels and 
coupons. They are modeling's ultimate specialists. 
</P>
<P>
Hand modeling is a sub-specialty of what's known as parts modeling. Some parts 
models do legs, others do feet and there's even an occasional call for eyes or 
ears. But hands are the most sought-after part. After all, they're used to sell 
virtually every product on the market, from cars to credit cards, diapers to 
diamond rings, lettuce to laundry detergent. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, different products demand different hands. On the male side, there 
are large, brawny hands that work best in, say, beer campaigns, and then there 
are more delicate hands favored for items such as computers. 
</P>
<P>
"I have kind of an upscale hand," explains hand model Drake Madison. "I do a 
lot of high-ticket-type items -- Citizen watches, champagne and so on. It's 
really weird, but I've sometimes not gotten a job because my hand was too 
sophisticated." 
</P>
<P>
So far as women go, the standard division is between elegant hands with long 
nails, which are perfect for jewelry and cosmetics, and well-proportioned but 
less glamorous hands appropriate for household and business products. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's Denise Feir, one of L.A.'s only unisex hand models. While she 
stands 4 feet 10 inches tall, her hands are as small as an 8-year-old boy's or 
girl's. Besides playing kids on McDonald's, Wendy's and Jack-in-The-Box 
commercials, her hands have been featured on countless Mattel, Kenner, Hasbro 
and Coleco spots. "I've gone down to (portraying) an infant," she says, "but 
that's pushing it." 
</P>
<P>
The man widely regarded as the busiest hand model in town -- the ubiquitous 
Bill Karp, who's featured in virtually all Anheuser- Busch () and Pizza Hut 
advertising -- is more than just another pretty palm. Karp specializes in 
pouring beers with perfect heads, slicing vegetables in mid-air and generally 
performing feats of awesome manual dexterity. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't rehearse or practice," Karp says. "I guess I just have a God-given 
knack." 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of New York City, Los Angeles is probably the largest 
hand-model market in the country. But despite all the action, only a dozen or 
so local models derive the bulk of their income from hand work. Rare indeed are 
the hand models who don't augment their income with acting or other parts 
modeling. 
</P>
<P>
Because supply exceeds demand, the competition for hand modeling jobs is 
fierce, and while the back-stabbing that characterizes fashion modeling is 
largely absent from the hand game, there's little love lost between many of the 
more competitive players. 
</P>
<P>
As model Gene Poe says, punctuating the thought with a grim chuckle, "There are 
some you wouldn't mind giving a little shove if they were standing next to a 
meat grinder." 
</P>
<P>
Models covet hand modeling jobs primarily because they pay roughly $150 an hour 
for print ads and $400 per eight-hour day for TV commercials. Although fashion 
and face modeling are more glamorous, hand modeling can be steadier and more 
lucrative for the very reason that its biggest stars remain anonymous: One hand 
looks like another to the general public, which means models can work for 
competitive clients without any conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
"When IRAs first came out, I think I did every bank in L.A.," Maderich says. "A 
lot of people say they built their house with their own hands. I like to say 
that I bought my house with my own hands." 
</P>
<P>
But despite the obvious benefits, few hand models actively sought out a career 
in the field. For example, one-time client agent Michele Slate, whose hands 
have been featured in more than 2,500 commercials during the last two decades, 
got her first job because a frantic director desperately needed a woman to lift 
a product out of a frame for a commercial, and she was available. "When I got 
finished," she recalls, "I looked at him and said, 'People get paid for this?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Most hand modeling jobs, though, are considerably more difficult. In fact, 
short of a paper cut, nothing irritates hand models more than the notion -- 
common among outsiders -- that their job is so simple that anybody can do it. 
</P>
<P>
They say it demands tremendous muscular control to remain motionless for 
painfully long periods of time. Hand models also must be resourceful and 
flexible enough to accommodate the awkward positions required in most shoots. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times, you want to put your camera where his head is supposed to be," 
photographer Jeff Nadler explains. Adds Jeanette Cook, whose hands have starred 
in dozens of Kraft spots, "You're always in a weird position. If people were to 
walk in (during a shoot), they'd probably say, "Oh, something kinky is going on 
here.' " 
</P>
<P>
Every hand model has a few favorite tales of woe to relate. Slate recalls 
spending most of a day balanced precariously over a 200-gallon fish tank on 
2x4s strung between two ladders on a dish-washing detergent shoot. For Madison, 
it was holding a violin and bow in the same position for seven hours. "After a 
while, the blood left my arms, and I started shaking," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"One day, I had to open, like, 500 cans of dog food," Poe says. "Another time, 
for a Midwestern fertilizer company, they hung me upside down in a harness for 
eight hours. I was supposed to be the hands of God (appearing) over a town." 
</P>
<P>
Cook's most absurd assignment was for a Chicago grocery store chain. "They'd 
tell me, 'Now fondle the fruit, and make it look realistic,' " she says. 
</P>
<P>
The one concern all hand models share is a fear that something will happen to 
their meal tickets. A tiny cut, a chipped nail, the smallest blister or just 
about anything else that most people accept as unavoidable are enough to throw 
hand models out of work. As a result, hand care is their obsession. "It's a 
24-hour job," Feir says. 
</P>
<P>
Almost without exception, hand models regularly moisturize their hands, 
manicure their nails, wear gloves when doing dishes or gardening and avoid 
heavy machinery. Frick puts petroleum jelly and heat mitts on her hands before 
going to sleep. Karp has gone so far as to insure his hands for $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The one thing they can't do, much to the chagrin of their employers, is change 
the structure of their hands. Cook remembers a photographer who repeatedly 
complained, "Oh, get rid of those knuckles!" More ridiculous still was 
Madison's experience with another photographer. "He told me that the pad of my 
thumb was too lean, and could I do some exercise to strengthen it." 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't, of course. Fortunately, Madison's hands, like those of his 
colleagues, are already among the best in the business.

L'AMOUR'S LEGACY; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILY UNEARTHS JUMBLE OF MANUSCRIPTS IN LATE AUTHOR'S STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARRY ABRAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Louis L'Amour, the novelist of the American frontier whose books continue to 
entertain presidents and construction workers, left a real mess behind when he 
died last year. 
</P>
<P>
His family is the first to admit how bad it was -- a "toxic dump" of maybe a 
couple tons of papers stacked chaotically on nearly every square inch of the 
floor and desk of the big room where L'Amour turned out novels and stories 
almost as fast as the U.S. Mint stamps out quarters. 
</P>
<P>
But the mess in the book-lined office of L'Amour's West Los Angeles home almost 
certainly will turn out to be a mint, too. In the jumble and tumble of 
newspaper clippings, magazines, maps, letters, screenplays, film treatments and 
manuscript copies, L'Amour's family found enough unpublished -- or long out of 
print -- writing to keep L'Amour riding tall on best-seller lists for years. 
</P>
<P>
The unpublished works are part of an already staggering publishing inheritance 
left by L'Amour, author of more than 100 books and once labeled by a critic as 
a sociological rather than a literary phenomenon because of his huge 
popularity. Now his wife, son and daughter, accustomed to remaining in the 
background while L'Amour handled the responsibilities of fame and success, are 
emerging to manage and promote his legacy. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a couple of full-length novels and we have some (unpublished) short 
story material and we have short story material that was written for the 
pulps," said Kathy L'Amour, the novelist's wife of 32 years in a joint 
interview with her children Beau and Angelique. "So we're in good shape and 
we'll have a publishing program well into the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
Kathy and her children remember L'Amour with obvious fondness and no apparent 
sadness. More often than not, they laughed when recounting the habits and 
humors of the novelist who became a household word as a paperback writer, and 
late in life made the leap to successful hardcover novelist with the 
publication of such works as "The Walking Drum" and "The Haunted Mesa." 
(L'Amour was so popular that readers wrote to tell him they named their 
children after his characters, mainly pioneers of the Old West.) 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Kathy L'Amour said she has taken over her husband's former 
office and -- like the rest of the flower-filled, rambling, Western-motif house 
-- it is polished, neat, attractive and comfortable. Indeed her husband's 
messiness is something of a family legend as well as an in-joke. (The papers, 
clippings, maps, manuscripts and an estimated 40,000 fan letters have been 
bound or filed and tucked away in storage in the L'Amour home.) 
</P>
<P>
"I used to kid him and tell him that he files in piles," Kathy L'Amour said. 
"His method of filing was crazy. He just stacked stuff up." 
</P>
<P>
Beau, 28, was the first to make the foray into his father's dangerous den. "I 
took about seven days of randomly walking around and randomly sampling stuff to 
try and find if there was any order or not," he recalled. "After that week I 
just decided there wasn't any order." 
</P>
<P>
Said Angelique, 25: "Dad always said he could find anything he wanted. (But) we 
all know that took a lot longer than he thought." 
</P>
<P>
A lengthy search for a missing paper or map was an entertaining diversion for 
L'Amour, who had a relentless writing schedule, his wife remembered. "He really 
liked looking for it, you see, because when he looked for something in a pile . 
. . he would come across all kinds of interesting things he hadn't seen for six 
months or two years or five years or whatever. So he had a really good time 
when he had to look. It would have made me crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Yet after L'Amour's fatal illness was diagnosed early in 1988, the room where 
he worked and created an extravagant clutter did cause a brief moment of pain, 
Kathy L'Amour said. "After he knew he was sick and he was down there one day 
and he was starting to clean up his room and I knew what he was thinking," she 
said. "I got very upset and I said, 'Oh please, please don't touch this room. 
Don't spend whatever time you've got on this room.' He looked at me and he was 
so happy. He went right to the typewriter and wrote another chapter . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Until a couple of weeks before Louis L'Amour died, he and his family kept his 
illness a secret. Moreover, the disease was seldom mentioned around the house. 
</P>
<P>
"We just told everybody that he had a viral pneumonia that was very, very tough 
to get rid of and he was able to carry it off for quite awhile," Kathy L'Amour 
said. "He was remarkable. He and I didn't talk about it. He didn't want to 
spend the rest of his life talking about his illness. To him that was rather 
boring and really not much fun. He would rather hear a good joke, he would 
rather read his books, he would rather be at the typewriter creating 
something." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, a casual observer who didn't know that the 80-year-old L'Amour, a 
nonsmoker, died of lung cancer in June, 1988, wouldn't have many clues that he 
was gone. A posthumous work, "Education of a Wandering Man," was published a 
few weeks ago and already is on both the New York Times and The Los Angeles 
Times bestseller lists for hardcover, nonfiction books. 
</P>
<P>
The memoir, which L'Amour was proofreading the day he died, is the author's 
105th published book, an output composed of 86 novels, 16 collections of short 
stories and three nonfiction works. In addition, a hard-cover book, "The 
Sackett Companion," and two paperback collections of short stories, "Lonigan" 
and "Long Ride Home," have been published since his death. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his death, daughter Angelique was on the promotion trail with a 
book she had compiled, "A Trail of Memories: The Quotations of Louis L'Amour," 
which also rode the bestseller list for 11 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Next May, "The Outlaws of Mesquite," a collection of eight short stories 
published decades ago in long-forgotten pulp magazines will be issued in 
hardcover, a first for a L'Amour book of short stories. No date has been set 
for publication of the two novels which "will need some editing," according to 
Stuart Applebaum, L'Amour's editor at Bantam Books, his longtime publisher. 
Both novels are adventure stories, not Westerns. Beau L'Amour said his father 
also left behind a 94-page fragment of a mystery but it is unlikely to ever be 
published because it apparently is a third or less of the projected book. 
</P>
<P>
Even without upcoming posthumous books, L'Amour's publishing statistics more 
resembles the gross national product of a small country than the efforts of one 
man. All of his books are still in print and about 220 million copies of 
L'Amour works -- mainly paperbacks -- have come off the presses over the 
decades, Applebaum said, making him one of the world's most popular writers. 
Most of those numbers were racked up in the final 15 years or so of L'Amour's 
life, a period that coincided roughly with the demise of the Western as a film 
and television genre, Applebaum said, noting that many Western fans apparently 
filled the gap with L'Amour novels. 
</P>
<P>
"The first 50 million of his books were sold copy-by-copy in the heartland of 
America," Applebaum said. 
</P>
<P>
L'Amour was never championed much by book critics, Applebaum acknowledged, 
although he sometimes was reviewed very favorably. "Education of a Wandering 
Man" has gotten some good notices, he added, from critics who have been charmed 
by the rambling, digressive account of L'Amour's years as a hobo, merchant 
seaman, mine watchman, day laborer and traveler with an obsession for reading. 
In that book accounts of close calls in barroom fights and boxing matches are 
interspersed with lists of classic novels, histories, philosophical works and a 
host of other volumes that L'Amour -- a 10th-grade dropout -- read while riding 
box cars or aboard a freighter steaming across the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Copies of the books listed by L'Amour now stand on the shelves of his office, 
evidence of his passion for self-education. It was a hard-earned learning that 
L'Amour used in surprising ways. For instance, he told an interviewer in 1984 
that the ancient mythical Greek hero Achilles, killed at the siege of Troy, 
would have been right at home in 19th-Century Dodge City, Kan., where the 
action was pretty good, too. 
</P>
<P>
On the verge of the 1990s, the surviving L'Amours have practical as well as 
sentimental reasons for keeping the L'Amour cottage industry humming. 
</P>
<P>
"There's the business of keeping it up and keeping people interested in it and 
not just letting it coast," said Beau L'Amour who has aspirations in film 
making and has been producing audiotapes of his father's books. "If we coast, 
eventually we make less money, we devalue the material." Besides, he added, his 
memories of his father are not mainly about his books. "To be extremely blunt, 
I really think that the material, that's for other people, that's for fans. I 
really think that Dad's writing was probably the least of him." 
</P>
<P>
Kathy L'Amour added that part of the family's purpose is to keep Louis L'Amour 
as a sort of living presence in the house where they were happy for a long 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you can't feel that someone like Louis is dead because his work and 
his words are around us all the time," she said. "Maybe the thing that's most 
gratifying is that you don't feel that the rest of the world thinks he's dead. 
I think it's kind of comforting in a way to feel that the rest of the world 
feels that he's still here because there are new books coming out and there are 
new readers doing the old books." 
</P>
<P>
L'Amour himself knew the chances of being remembered by history were slim. In 
"Education of a Wandering Man," he wrote, "Actors, politicians and writers -- 
all of us are but creatures of the hour. Long-lasting fame comes to but a few. 
Turning the pages of my notebooks, I see so many names, once well known, now 
all but forgotten."

INVENTIVE SCHOOLS GIVE TIRED CHEERS THE OLD COLLEGE TRY; 
</P>
<P>
SPIRIT: THOUGH USC AND UCLA REMAIN TRADITIONAL, YELL SQUADS ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
DELIGHT CROWDS WITH WITTY AND IRREVERENT CHANTS.

While USC quarterback Todd Marinovich may throw unexpected bombs to receivers 
in Saturday's game against UCLA, the cheerleaders from both schools won't vary 
from close-to-the-vest routines which advisers at both schools call 
"traditional." UCLA cheerleaders will urge thousands of rooters to spell out 
B-R-U-I-N-S. USC yell leaders will implore one side of the Coliseum to chant 
"Go" and the other to bellow "Trojans." 
</P>
<P>
It's not that way everywhere. Yell leaders at many colleges are more irreverent 
than the staid Bruins and Trojans, delighting crowds with witty and inventive 
cheers. 
</P>
<P>
While fans at Occidental College in Eagle Rock scream "O-X-Y," male yell 
leaders roll in the dirt in front of the grandstand to spell the letters. 
</P>
<P>
If that doesn't rouse anyone, yell squad captain Amy Muller says she can always 
rely on a poem which is a crowd favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Oo oo ooga ahh 
</P>
<P>
 Ah ah ooga ahh 
</P>
<P>
 Igge igge igge oh 
</P>
<P>
 Ah ah ooga ahh 
</P>
<P>
 Go Oxy! rah, rah, rah. 
</P>
<P>
 The yell which brings tears to the eyes of alumni, however, is "Io Triumphe," 
pirated from Albion College in Michigan in 1903. 
</P>
<P>
 Io Triumphe! Io Triumphe!

<P>
 There is also some funny business going on at nearby California Institute of 
Technology in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
When the Beavers' club team hosts the Pasadena Police Assn. Saturday, the 
police may need a decoding unit to understand the Caltech rooters fearsome 
traditional chant:

<P>
 The Yale University marching band also trumpets its intellectual achievements. 
When the Bulldogs play an opponent of questionable academic caliber, the 
musicians yell "Two, four, six, eight. We can count to eight." 
</P>
<P>
The band also plays fight songs by incomparable composers. Cole Porter, class 
of 1913, wrote "Bulldog," containing the immortal line, "Bulldog! Bulldog! Bow, 
wow-wow," and "Boola Boola," which includes the verse: 
</P>
<P>
 Boola, Boola, Boola, Boola, 
</P>
<P>
 When the Bulldog gets poor Harvard 
</P>
<P>
 She will holler Boola Boo. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Ives (1898) weighed in with a drinking song, "Here's to Good Old 
Yale/Drink it down, drink it down," not to be confused with his later complex, 
modernistic pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Many other unusual yells dot the country. When the Fighting Gobblers of 
Virginia Tech score, a mechanical turkey gobbler on the scoreboard warbles. 
</P>
<P>
Rooters for the University of California Irvine Anteaters add "Zot" after 
spelling out "U-C-I," a throwback to the same word the anteater in the BC 
cartoon uses when its tongue reaches its prey. 
</P>
<P>
At Massachusetts Institute of Technology, secure rooters display a cavalier 
attitude toward opponents' successes, yelling: 
</P>
<P>
 That's all right. 
</P>
<P>
 That's OK. 
</P>
<P>
 You're gonna work 
</P>
<P>
 For us someday." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately the Southern Arkansas Muleriders, the Arkansas Tech Wonder Boys 
and the University of Akron Zips report no unusual cheers, and some schools, 
such as Stanford University, have no organized cheers at all. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had them since the 1960s," said Stanford spokesman Joel Shurkin, 
explaining that counterculture students voted out cheering. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here 10 years and I've seen one cheer and that was an ad hoc job 
during the big game with Cal . . . They've tried. God knows they've tried. But 
with limited success. There is no sign of them ever coming back."

WALESA: Most congressmen who wanted to get a glimpse of Solidarity leader Lech 
Walesa had to claw their way through the crowd at a jammed joint session at the 
Capitol. . . . But Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) got a private 
audience at a gathering later where he presented Walesa with a Polish language 
copy of Cox-authored amendments to a foreign aid bill just adopted by the 
House. . . . "He said what they need more than money is private ownership in 
Poland, and that this is the way to do it," Cox said. Dana Parsons and and

COLLECTOR'S ITEM: Despite being tossed out of the CIF playoffs again (A1), 
Huntington Beach High won't be forgotten at tonight's game at Fontana High. . . 
. The 1,500 game programs, printed before Thursday's ruling, contain the 
Huntington Beach roster and team description. . . . They also include the same 
for Fountain Valley High, the team that actually will play. Fontana Coach John 
MacKinney said that was the only solution when, at printing deadline, "all we 
knew was we were playing Friday night against somebody wearing a white jersey."

<P>
Twenty-four hours before the big game, the Huntington Beach High School 
football team was thrown out of postseason championship play Thursday by 
appellate judges who sternly lectured the Oilers' booster club attorneys on the 
importance of playing by the rules. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Anaheim's Savanna High School, also barred Tuesday from the playoffs 
because of an allegedly ineligible player, was in a lower court Thursday to 
seek reinstatement and expects a decision today. 
</P>
<P>
In light of the Huntington Beach ruling, however, Savanna's chances don't look 
good. "All we can do (is) sit and wait and pray and keep the fingers crossed," 
said Rebel coach Fred DiPalma. 
</P>
<P>
In the Huntington Beach case, a three-judge panel of the 4th District Court of 
Appeal in effect unanimously sided with Sunset League officials who had 
disqualified the Oilers from the playoffs last Saturday for using an ineligible 
player in its games. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, the appellate justices stayed an Orange County Superior Court 
judge's ruling on Tuesday that had returned the team to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We were given hope and then had it taken away," Huntington Beach football 
coach George Pascoe said. "Something has to be done about . . . how this sort 
of thing is handled." 
</P>
<P>
Booster club attorney Edward J. Paul argued in vain that the rule, which 
requires an athlete's parent or guardian to live in the school district, had 
been unintentionally violated in the case of starting tackle David Roman and 
should have been caught by school administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, Paul said, students, the football team and the Roman family are 
suffering. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe what's suffering is respect for rules," interjected Associate Justice 
Edward J. Wallin during a hearing held in the Santa Ana court. "What you're 
really attacking is the whole CIF (California Interscholastic Federation) book 
of rules, aren't you?" 
</P>
<P>
"The rules are extremely clear as to what the consequences will be if an 
ineligible player is fielded," Wallin asserted. 
</P>
<P>
The justices said they were reluctant to get involved in sports disputes, which 
Wallin reasoned could ultimately mean "we'll have games every Monday and Friday 
and litigation Wednesdays through Thursdays." He added: 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe in January or February, when we finally get though all the appeals, we 
can finally have CIF trophies presented right here." 
</P>
<P>
"Pretty soon," Wallin continued, "a coach will want to start the season with 
good assistants, a good trainer and a good lawyer. A good lawyer who can work 
fast will be more important than a fast tailback." 
</P>
<P>
Another booster club attorney, James Baze, said he was "more disappointed for 
the children of the Huntington Beach High School football team than for anyone 
else." 
</P>
<P>
But CIF-Southern Section attorney Andrew Patterson said the ruling "maintains 
stability in interscholastic athletics." 
</P>
<P>
At least, said Coach Pascoe, the matter was finally resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"This week, the kids have been through everything," Pascoe said. "First we're 
the No. 1 seed (in the league). Then we're out. Then the principals say we're 
in. Then, the CIF says we're out. Two days ago we're back in and today we're 
finally out." 
</P>
<P>
"That's a lot for a 17-year-old kid to deal with. I'm 35 and I'm having trouble 
dealing with it," Pascoe added. 
</P>
<P>
Booster Club president Reno Bellamy suggested that the Southern Section 
officials should "get smart and rewrite that blue book of theirs." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, "we thought it was a good cause and we had to fight for 
them. And we took them all the way." 
</P>
<P>
The controversy centered on Roman, 17, who was declared ineligible when 
officials discovered as postseason play approached that he had been living with 
an older brother and not his mother since transferring from Maryland this year. 
</P>
<P>
In the court action by Huntington Beach's booster club, Orange County Superior 
Court Judge Thomas N. Thrasher ruled Tuesday that even though Roman's brother, 
Tony, 24, is not his legal guardian, he fulfilled the spirit of the CIF rule as 
a "de facto guardian." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Thrasher said, the boy's mother had intended to move to Huntington 
Beach but was unable to sell her house in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's appellate hearing, however, Justice Wallin said that if the 
intention to move within a school's boundaries was all that was required, "I 
guarantee you you'll see a lot of houses up for sale about every August and a 
lot of fine football players moving around." 
</P>
<P>
In a sworn declaration filed in appellate court, CIF-Southern Section 
Commissioner Stan Thomas said schools would have no incentive to abide by the 
rules if exceptions were allowed after violations were detected. 
</P>
<P>
"Under those circumstances, the schools would be free to 'take a chance' and 
play a youngster, then if questions are raised later, to seek eligibility at 
that time," Thomas reasoned. "The CIF seeks to deter this kind of conduct." 
</P>
<P>
Justice Wallin drew a parallel with the Southern Section's rules and the game 
of football. 
</P>
<P>
"There are lots of rules in football, too, that have nothing to do with play, 
but they are rules," Wallin said. "Lining up offsides when you're a wide 
receiver doesn't make much difference, but it's a five-yard penalty." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the court action, Fountain Valley High School will play Fontana 
High School tonight in place of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In the Savanna High School case, Orange County Superior Court Commissioner 
Julian Cimbaluk postponed a decision until today. 
</P>
<P>
A third legal effort failed Thursday when La Puente High School in Los Angeles 
County lost its bid to be reinstated to the playoffs. La Puente had been 
disqualified by its league officials because of an ineligible player. Pomona 
Superior Court Judge Thomas Nuss denied the school's request for reinstatement, 
in part, because it was not filed in a timely manner, a school spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Coach Dick Bruich of Fontana High, the top-rated football team in 
the Southern Section, said: "We spent two days preparing for Huntington, two 
days for Fountain Valley. We spent today preparing for Huntington. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I look at it, you got to live with whatever situation is dealt you; 
you don't settle in court. The rule book spells out everything."

HOUSE APPROVES PAY RAISE AND ETHICS PACKAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
House members, ignoring the public opposition that prevented them from taking a 
salary increase just 10 months ago, passed a pay and ethics package Thursday 
that would raise compensation for themselves, federal judges and top 
Administration officials to almost $125,000 a year over the next 13 months. 
</P>
<P>
The unusually wide margin of 252 to 174 reflected a widespread view by 
Republicans and Democrats that American taxpayers will not oppose the nearly 
40% pay increase, since it is tied to ethics reform and since most of it would 
not take effect until after the next election. 
</P>
<P>
House leaders also succeeded in undermining opponents of the pay raise by 
scheduling a vote less than 24 hours after details of the measure were made 
public. Printed copies of the complex 100-page legislation were not available 
until shortly before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
The House-passed increase would not apply to members of the Senate. The Senate 
is expected to act today on a different pay proposal, which also was being kept 
secret until shortly before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for an increase of more than $30,000 from their current salary of 
$89,000, House members accepted the first overhaul of their code of conduct in 
two decades -- including a ban on pocketing speech honorariums, which currently 
can generate as much as $26,850 a year. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, many senior House members who regularly collect the maximum 
allowable honorariums would realize only a small net increase in pay from the 
legislation. Junior members who seldom get honorariums for speeches would be 
the chief beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
Under the House legislation, members would receive a 7.9% "cost-of-living" 
increase before the end of the current year, followed by another, unspecified 
cost-of-living raise and a mandated 25% pay increase in January, 1991. It is 
estimated that the 1991 cost-of-living raise would be about 3%, bringing the 
total salary to $124,330 after the final increase. 
</P>
<P>
The salaries of federal judges and top executive branch officials would 
increase in tandem with congressional pay, although many of these federal 
employees would not get the initial increase because they already received a 
cost-of-living increase earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The base salary of members of Congress, judges and top federal employees has 
been $89,500 since February, 1987, when it was increased by 16%. But members of 
Congress usually vote to forgo the cost-of-living increases they would receive 
automatically if they took no action. 
</P>
<P>
The House measure, which would cost taxpayers an estimated $70 million in 1990, 
was the product of 10 months of behind-the-scenes negotiations designed to 
fashion a bill that could be supported by Democrats, Republicans and President 
Bush. These talks began after the House voted last February to reject a 51% pay 
raise that had failed to win GOP support. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking for the majority during two hours of House debate, Rep. Richard A. 
Gephardt (D-Mo.), the majority leader, characterized the pay-ethics package as 
"the right thing to do." Gephardt acknowledged, however, that many of his 
constituents would probably oppose such a large pay raise for officials who 
already are in the top 1% of the nation's wage-earners. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand and sympathize with people in my district who make $15,000 
and $20,000 and $30,000 a year who would have trouble understanding why this 
kind of pay level is needed," Gephardt said. 
</P>
<P>
Some members spoke out against the package either because they believed that 
the ethics reforms did not go far enough or because the pay increase would come 
at a time when budget cuts are being imposed on many federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) said that voters expect members of 
Congress to do more to earn a pay raise. He argued that it should be tied to 
passage of a balanced budget amendment. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality is that the American public doesn't have much sympathy for those 
of us running the Congress today because the majority of this country's fiscal 
affairs has been a disaster," Dannemeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
The only member of the Orange County congressional delegation to vote in favor 
of the pay raise and ethics package was Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), whose 
district includes the southern section of the county. 
</P>
<P>
Packard said he has worked during his seven years in Congress to strengthen 
ethics regulations and that the measure provided a rare opportunity to enact 
reforms, including restrictions on outside Congressional income. 
</P>
<P>
"I have held elective office for 26 years, and I have never in my life . . . 
voted myself a pay raise," Packard said. "I would have voted against the pay 
raise this time if it had been a separate up-and-down vote on that issue alone. 
. . . I chose ethical reform. I would do it again. It was the right vote." 
</P>
<P>
Opposed were Reps. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Lomita) and Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
Cox said he supported the ethics provisions of the pay raise bill as well as 
the pay increase for federal judges but that he voted against the measure 
because "congressional spending on the Congress itself has gone wildly out of 
control. . . . For Congress to have held judges' salaries hostage until its own 
members get a pay raise . . . is cynicism of the worst kind." 
</P>
<P>
Most House members characterized the ethics package as a radical reform that 
would help restore confidence in the House in the wake of a string of 
embarrassing scandals. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. David R. Obey (D-Wis.) said that the ban on pocketing honorariums, 
combined with severe restrictions on outside employment, would restore the 
principle set forth in the Constitution that members of Congress be paid only 
by the American people. 
</P>
<P>
"It says, boys and girls, this is a full-time job," Obey said. "Pay attention 
to what's going on here. We'll compensate you straight from the public 
treasury, right out in the open, but no more side employment deals." 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly over the last few years, members of Congress have come to rely on 
honorariums from special interests to supplement their incomes because of their 
reluctance to take the political heat generated by a pay increase. The House 
now permits members to accept honorariums up to a limit of 30% of their income; 
the Senate sets a limit of 40%. 
</P>
<P>
Under the House pay bill, the limit on honorariums would be frozen at $26,850 
until January, 1991, when honorariums would be prohibited entirely. Members 
would still be allowed to instruct special interest groups to donate up to 
$2,000 to specified charities in their names -- a practice that enhances the 
political image of members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, House members and top federal officials would be prohibited from 
accepting compensation for serving on corporate boards of directors or for 
performing professional services. Some outside earned income such as teaching 
fees would still be permitted, with a limit equivalent to 15% of a member's 
annual pay. 
</P>
<P>
House members would be prohibited from accepting gifts in excess of $200 from 
any source except relatives. Personal hospitality would be exempt as long it 
was not claimed by a corporation as a tax exemption. All meals purchased for 
House members would also be exempt, even if paid for by lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
Travel by House members that is paid for by special interest groups would be 
limited to four days and three nights within the borders of the United States 
or seven days and six nights for trips overseas. Travel expenses reimbursed by 
special interests would be subject to stricter public disclosure than now is 
required. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Hank Brown (R-Colo.) said the reforms are insufficient, that Congress 
should, among other things, require members to disclose favorable interest 
rates they receive when they borrow money. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Brown said that members should be prohibited from placing their 
holdings in blind trusts, where they are shrouded from public scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
After the vote, there was a clear sense of relief felt by many members who hate 
to deal with the sticky issue of pay and ethics. "This is like root canal work 
without anesthesia," said Rep. Thomas J. Downey (D-N.Y.). "It's enormously 
painful, but it needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE PAY AND ETHICS BILL 
</P>
<P>
PAY 
</P>
<P>
A 1989 cost-of-living increase for House members, federal judges, and top 
executive branch officials upon enactment, plus the 1990 cost-of-living 
adjustment (COLA) in January, for a total 7.9% increase; raising pay from 
$89,500 to $96,600. 
</P>
<P>
A 25% salary increase in 1991, plus whatever COLA is set for other federal 
employees, reduced by 0.5% and not to exceed 5%, meaning at total of at least 
$120,000. 
</P>
<P>
HONORARIUMS-OUTSIDE INCOME 
</P>
<P>
Prohibits acceptance of honorariums, such as speaking fees, by House members 
and all government employees (except senators) begining in 1991. Permits 
donation of honorariums up to $2,000 to charity.

<P>
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE 
</P>

POSITIVE ID: THAT BIRD WAS NO EAGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE CHANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In tan khakis, a fishing hat and his Pomona Valley Audubon Society T-shirt, 
Milton Blatt peered through binoculars at the large brown bird perched atop the 
Walnut sheriff's substation radio tower. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm positive, absolutely positive," he said Thursday. "That's not a golden 
eagle. It's a red-tailed hawk. See the white shanks and barred tail? Million to 
one it's a red-tail." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, Dr. Russell Rohde, a West Covina cardiologist and bird enthusiast, 
squinted through a telescope and nodded in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Then, a helicopter ride during which Blatt, Rohde and a sheriff's deputy 
hovered near the tower for a few minutes, confirmed it: The empty nest on top 
was too small to be an eagle's. 
</P>
<P>
So ended a weeklong puzzle for local ornithologists and officials at the 
sheriff's station, one that had dragged on ever since a maintenance worker 
discovered the nest while climbing to the top of the 130-foot tower. Circling 
in the air above, screeching loudly, were two large birds the worker took for 
eagles. 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Fish and Game and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service were immediately contacted. State officials sent Rohde, who at first 
identified the bird he spotted there as a golden eagle. 
</P>
<P>
Blatt, sent out by the federal department, disagreed. He said it was an 
immature red-tailed hawk that hadn't yet fully developed its distinctive red 
feathers. 
</P>
<P>
Had it been a golden eagle, and had there been eggs in the nest, federal law 
would have prohibited disturbing it. 
</P>
<P>
Still, with a twinkle of hope in his eyes, Rohde said Thursday there was a 
possibility that what he saw a few days before was a golden eagle. "I once saw 
a pair of golden eagles in Chino Hills," he said, gazing wistfully to the east.

2 FREED FROM DIRT TRAP; 
</P>
<P>
RESCUE: AFTER TWO HOURS, TWO GEOLOGISTS ARE DUG OUT FROM A 12-FOOT-DEEP TRENCH 
THAT COLLAPSED IN ANAHEIM HILLS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a dramatic, two-hour rescue, two geologists were freed from a death trap of 
dirt Thursday after one wall of a 12-foot-deep trench collapsed on them at an 
Anaheim Hills construction site. 
</P>
<P>
Five construction workers scooped dirt with their hands and shovels to unearth 
the head of Jim Glomb, 41, who was buried beneath about two feet of soil after 
the trench gave way. 
</P>
<P>
"We could hear him yell, hear him scream when we first got here," said Anaheim 
Firefighter Jody Ballard, whose crew arrived about 10 minutes after the 
collapse. "It's really amazing he survived." 
</P>
<P>
It took about two hours for rescue workers to dig out Glomb, who was fed oxygen 
through a mask during the rescue. He emerged conscious from a 10-foot hole dug 
by firefighters and was taken to United Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, where 
he was in stable condition Thursday night with a broken right arm. 
</P>
<P>
The other geologist, Chris Tomlin, 36, was buried to his waist and freed in 
about 40 minutes. Tomlin was taken to Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in 
Anaheim, where he was examined and released. 
</P>
<P>
The trench was in the side of a hill next to the end of Anise Street, a 
cul-de-sac near the intersection of Santa Ana Canyon and Weir Canyon roads. The 
geologists, employees of G.A. Nicolls &amp; Associates of Tustin, were testing 
the soil before it was graded for Phase 2 of The Highlands housing development 
in the Anaheim Hills area. 
</P>
<P>
A state safety inspector who was at the site said the geologists should not 
have gone into a trench that deep without shoring it up first. 
</P>
<P>
The rescue effort involved everyone from construction workers from other 
projects to residents of an adjacent housing tract. When homeowner Michael 
Parker heard the firefighters call for plywood to shore up the trench, he 
didn't think twice about tearing the doors off the tool cabinet in his garage. 
</P>
<P>
"What's there to think about?" Parker said. "I ripped it right out of the 
wall." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Scheffer, a Boulder, Colo., resident who was visiting his daughter, 
brought two gallons of drinking water and a stack of plastic cups for the 
rescue workers. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to do what little bit I could to help," Scheffer said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters supported the sides of the trench with plywood and braced the 
plywood with 2-by-4 lumber, much of which was gathered from the back yards and 
workshops of neighbors. Two construction workers who were supposed to be laying 
sidewalks in the area left their job and carried plywood on their backs to the 
rescue site. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a lot of improvisation, as we usually do," said Anaheim Fire Department 
Battalion Chief Steve Magliocco. "It was a real nice team effort." 
</P>
<P>
The first reward came when Tomlin was dug out about 40 minutes after 
firefighters were called at 2:40 p.m. His clothes stained with dirt, the 
bearded Tomlin was strapped to a backboard and loaded into an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
Freeing Glomb was more complicated. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Guthridge, site superintendent for builder Presley of Southern California, 
was one of the first people on the scene after the trench collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
"We got his head exposed in about 15 minutes," Guthridge said of Glomb. "We 
knew right where to dig because we knew where he had been." 
</P>
<P>
As more rescue workers arrived, some used shovels to remove the dirt from 
around Glomb's body while others worked to stabilize the trench above where it 
had collapsed. Firefighters called out the length of the 2-by-4 needed to brace 
the 4-foot-wide trench, and a construction worker cut the wood using a chain 
saw. 
</P>
<P>
As Glomb's upper body was freed, firefighters splinted his broken arm. Finally, 
at about 4:20 p.m., Glomb was carried out of the trench on a stretcher. His 
face bloodied above his right eye, Glomb blinked as he responded to paramedics' 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you feel my hands?" a paramedic asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," Glomb responded softly. 
</P>
<P>
Within about 40 minutes, a construction worker bulldozed the trench, and 
firefighters cleared the area. About 30 people assisted in the rescue, 
including 16 firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
An investigator from Cal/OSHA was on the scene and said state and federal laws 
require that any trench deeper than five feet be shored up or sloped before 
workers can enter. The trench that collapsed Thursday was neither, said William 
Loupe, a compliance safety engineer. 
</P>
<P>
"A citation will likely be issued to the company," Loupe said of G.A. Nicolls 
&amp; Associates.

A COMMUNITY TO BE BUILT ON A THEME OF ART; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: FOOTHILL RANCH WILL ABOUND IN PUBLIC ARTWORKS OF ALL KINDS AND ITS 
BUILDERS WILL PICK UP THE TAB -- WITHOUT PROMPTING BY GOVERNMENT.

<P>
One of Orange County's largest landowners plans to charge developers of homes 
and businesses in a new Saddleback Valley planned community fees that would be 
used to adorn the community with murals, sculpture and other public art. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in both the arts and real estate communities say they are unaware of 
any other project in Southern California in which a program like this for the 
arts has been run by developers, rather than government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill Ranch is planned as a 2,700-acre, $2-billion community to be developed 
over the next 10 years in South County by Foothill Ranch Co., a subsidiary of 
Hon Development, the community's creator. 
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to include 3,900 housing units, commercial and 
industrial development geared to create more than 10,000 jobs, a 1,100-acre 
nature park, schools, a fire station and a library. 
</P>
<P>
As planned, it would also feature a multimillion-dollar Foothill Urban Arts 
Program which would, over the next 10 to 15 years, sprinkle at least 100 
sculptures, murals and other artworks throughout the urban village and offer 
performing art festivals and educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Art won't just exist in a few places," said Maudette M. Ball, administrator of 
the arts program and a well-regarded arts executive who ran the Palos Verdes 
Art Center for five years until last April. 
</P>
<P>
Likening the concept to European cities where "urban art is very much a part of 
life and every plaza has art," Ball explained: "What we're trying to do is make 
the arts a vital part of this community." 
</P>
<P>
Foothill Ranch Co. is requiring nearly all companies that buy its land and plan 
to build commercial, industrial and residential units to contribute up to 1% of 
their construction costs. The amount each company contributes would depend on 
the degree to which each developer would benefit from the art, according to 
Chris Downey, Foothill Ranch vice president and project manager. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the fees, which would generate "at least several million" dollars 
for art, would probably be charged industrial and commercial builders, who are 
expected to develop 8 million square feet of space -- about $1 billion worth of 
building, Downey said. Home buyers would bear a relatively small share of the 
program's cost, he added. 
</P>
<P>
However, the project's first three residential developers -- Bramalea 
California Ltd., William Lyon Co. and J.M. Peters Co. Inc. -- have already 
agreed to pay several hundred thousand dollars, Downey said. 
</P>
<P>
Developers of Southern California's planned communities have long embellished 
their projects with art, even it it has simply been a bas relief on the stone 
markers at the entrance to a subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
And nationwide, there are numerous public art programs underwritten by 
developers' fees imposed by local governments. The city of Brea has a 
14-year-old program which so far has produced 91 artworks, a Brea city official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Foothill Ranch program may be unprecedented, perhaps statewide. 
Claudia Chapline, head of the California Arts Council's public art program, 
said she was not aware of any similar programs in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"Public art programs are usually mandated by a city or county," Chapline said. 
"I think the fact that Foothill is planning for art from the very beginning is 
significant and certainly shows an enlightened approach." 
</P>
<P>
It is also a strong indication that developers' attitudes toward fees for art 
have changed markedly, said Chapline, who recently delivered a lecture on 
public art to Foothill Ranch planners. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we're seeing that developers are viewing art as an asset in marketing," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Foothill Urban Arts Program is an outgrowth of Hon Development's 
"commitment to maintaining and enhancing open space" and its "concept of 
addressing the whole person," Ball said, adding that the firm will keep about 
half the community's land open. The company also has moved 600 oak trees for 
preservation. 
</P>
<P>
Planning for Foothill Ranch has gone on over eight years. But Hon Executive 
Vice President Gerald E. Buck, a partner of Foothill Ranch Co., came up with 
the idea for the art project about three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Buck, who owns a collection dominated by early California art, part of which is 
often loaned to local institutions, said, "We have a unique opportunity to do 
something special." 
</P>
<P>
In June, the arts program will be launched officially with a 5K and 10K run, 
planned to be an annual event, to raise money for arts education programs, Ball 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The art planned for the program, ranging from traditional to contemporary, will 
be mostly three-dimensional and be either existing or commissioned works by 
established and emerging artists, Ball said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the developers working with Foothill Ranch Co. have resisted the art 
fee, Downey said. "I think the developers we are working with . . . are all 
experienced enough to understand the benefits of a program like this to the 
whole community." 
</P>
<P>
However, it is conceivable that in the future, in lieu of the fee, firms may 
elect to donate an artwork of their choice, providing it is approved by the 
arts program's managers. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have endorsed the art program as well. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's another in the line of outstanding, forward-thinking ideas that 
the Foothill Ranch Co. has had in regards to how they want to see this 
community developed," said Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, whose district includes 
the planned community. 
</P>
<P>
Performing arts events envisioned for Foothill Ranch include outdoor music or 
dance performances, said Moss, who is also administrative director of Buck's 
art collection. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a lot of open plazas where people will naturally congregate and 
stroll and dine (where) we foresee concerts or children's arts festivals," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for arts education include signs identifying artworks, tours, seminars, 
and conferences and lectures by out-of-state artists commissioned for works. 
All events will be open to everyone, not just Foothill Ranch residents, Ball 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The first artworks will be selected by the Foothill Urban Arts Program task 
force, a group that includes Ball, Buck, Downey, two Foothill Ranch landscape 
architects, its chief architect, and Northern California artist Tony Sheets, 
son of the late Millard Sheets, who produced several public artworks in 
Southern California and elsewhere. This group will soon create an advisory 
panel of arts professionals, Ball said. 
</P>
<P>
Developers paying the art program fee "may or may not" have a say in choosing 
what their money will go for, Downey said. "We have not worked those details 
out yet." 
</P>
<P>
One real estate expert believes that allowing developers to pick their art 
could spell trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"I see a situation where some of them might want statues of themselves," said 
Kelly McDermott of the housing consultants Market Profiles in Costa Mesa, with 
a laugh. "Seriously, it could open up a can of worms." 
</P>
<P>
For long-term funding, particularly after development has ceased, a nonprofit 
operating foundation would be established to support the program, Ball said. It 
would also pay for art maintainance and preservation, a critical concern 
sometimes overlooked by public art planners, art experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Requiring a fee for art is unusual because the housing market is slowing down 
and also because prices are so high. Anything that adds to prices might 
discourage builders from buying land and -- further down the pipeline -- 
discourage consumers from buying houses. 
</P>
<P>
"This can work in master-planned communities, where one developer has control 
of many thousands of acres," said Thomas F. Daly, director of governmental 
affairs at the Building Industry Assn.'s Orange County chapter. "But there are 
only a few of those left in Orange County."

ARMY ENGINEERS MAY BACK DOWN ON MOVE TO CHARGE FOR WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A top Army official agreed Thursday to reconsider a newly instituted policy 
that allows the Corps of Engineers to charge cities, counties and other local 
agencies hundreds of thousands of dollars for services that the corps 
traditionally has given away. 
</P>
<P>
The action grew out of a dispute involving the Orange County Water District, 
which has protested the corps' plans to charge an estimated $150,000 a year for 
water from the Prado Dam that otherwise would be released into the sea. The 
Prado Dam case was seen by some officials as a trial run at enforcing the new 
policy across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
However, following a Capitol Hill meeting with members of Orange County's 
congressional delegation and county water district officials, Robert W. Page, 
assistant secretary of the Army for civil works, said the Army may back off. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to look at what the policy is, what it really means," said Page, 
whose office supervises the Corps of Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want something to happen here where we get a national policy . . . 
that's going to be detrimental," he said. "If that's the case, then the policy 
is no good. If it's not productive and it doesn't serve the nation, I don't 
think it's a good policy." 
</P>
<P>
The recent policy change, made in response to growing concerns about federal 
budget deficits, could affect every community that benefits directly or 
indirectly from corps projects, including flood control and harbor dredging. 
</P>
<P>
The revenue-raising plan would allow the corps to charge fees to public 
agencies based on the market value of the benefits that result from the corps' 
work. Such benefits include the release of water from corps dams so local 
governments can capture the water in municipal reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, including water reclamation, the value of the benefit would be 
far greater than the actual cost the corps incurs in providing it. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Reps. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Lomita) and Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) said they were pleased with the results 
of the meeting with Page and a deputy. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the (new revenue) policy is being dropped like a hot potato," said 
Cox, who organized the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"The corps here today acknowledged that their new policy is not one contained 
in (published corps) regulations, and does not have any specific legal 
authority," said Cox, who was formerly an assistant legal counsel in the Ronald 
Reagan White House. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a policy that they literally have written and are trying out on Orange 
County," said Packard, whose district includes southern Orange County. "We 
wanted to remind them . . . that this will become a national policy that will 
apply to projects all across this country." 
</P>
<P>
Said Rohrabacher, whose district includes northwestern Orange County, "This is 
a monkey wrench thrown into the works at a time when people have already 
dedicated enormous time and effort and resources to a (water district 
reclamation) project." 
</P>
<P>
William R. Mills, general manager of the Orange County Water District, and 
James F. McConnell, Orange County's Washington lobbyist, also attended the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The county water district, which maintains a vast underground reservoir that 
feeds about 40 local water districts, for years has informally arranged with 
the corps to use water from the Prado Dam in Riverside County to replenish the 
district's underground water supply. 
</P>
<P>
To do that, the corps must fill the reservoir behind the dam to a higher than 
normal level, and then release the water slowly so the water district can 
divert it from the Santa Ana River channel into "recharging ponds." The ponds 
allow the water to seep into the deep deposits of gravel and sand that form the 
underground reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, the water district sought to formalize its agreement with 
the corps, and agreed to pay for any costs that the water reclamation project 
might entail. Those costs could reach an estimated $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the plan, which would involve reclaiming about 5,000 
acre-feet of water (about 1.6 billion gallons) a year, would cost an estimated 
$3 million to $5 million. The money would largely pay for partial 
reconstruction of a habitat for an endangered bird species that would be 
flooded by the rising water. 
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the reclamation project would add an additional 3,000 
acre-feet of water to the district's reserves, but would cost as much as $10 
million more because a much larger area of the bird habitat would be flooded. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, the Army told the water district that it would, as part of the new 
reclamation agreement, in effect charge the district for half of the value of 
the Prado Dam water that the corps formerly had given away. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mills, the numbers work out this way: 
</P>
<P>
If the district purchased 5,000 acre-feet of water on the open market, it could 
expect to spend about $500,000. The estimated annual cost of the improvements 
required for the first phase of the reclamation project is about $200,000. That 
leaves the district with a net annual savings of $300,000 over what it would 
spend if it acquired the extra water from an agency other than the Army. 
</P>
<P>
Under its new revenue policy, the corps maintained that it would charge a fee 
equal to half of that savings, or about $150,000 a year, Mills explained.

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council will meet on Monday to elect a new mayor for a one-year term 
to succeed Wes Bannister, who has held the position since November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Bannister said that normally the council elects the previous year's mayor pro 
tem to the mayoral post. The current mayor pro tem is Tom Mays. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, the council is to meet in closed session with its 
executive-search team to discuss the hiring of a new city administrator to 
succeed Paul E. Cook, who plans to retire early in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Bannister said Thursday that the council will use the closed session to narrow 
down the list of prospective candidates for the job. 
</P>
<P>
Bannister said the council hopes to name a new city administrator by early 
January.

LIBRARY TO EXPAND GENEALOGY SOURCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $15,113 federal grant is enabling the city to purchase for its library system 
more genealogy books, library director Ron Hayden said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the City Council formally received the money and passed it 
on to the library system. The money is part of the federal government's program 
to encourage urban libraries not to duplicate expensive, specialized 
collections, Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
"The strategy is to help libraries enhance their collections without 
duplicating some of the expensive references of other nearby libraries," Hayden 
said. "For instance, here in Huntington Beach, we have a very extensive 
genealogy section," he explained, adding that the library serves as a sort of 
regional resource center for genealogy references. "It would be very expensive 
for other libraries in our area to go out and purchase many of these books." 
</P>
<P>
Hayden said that the federal money will also be used to buy science, social 
science and other reference indexes.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FINAL ROUND OF HEARINGS ON ETHICS REFORMS 
BEGUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council's ethics committee opened its final round of 
hearings Thursday on a new package of ethics reforms that were triggered by the 
controversy over Mayor Tom Bradley's financial affairs. 
</P>
<P>
But it was clear that the committee has a long way to go in shaping, adopting 
and implementing a new ethics code. 
</P>
<P>
Committee members Michael Woo, Ruth Galanter and Gloria Molina were openly at 
odds over proposals to ban outside employment and restrictions on city 
officials returning to the private sector. Some proposals -- such as the 
creation of a city ethics office -- would require a ballot measure to change 
the city Charter. And other proposals, such as granting the city attorney 
access to the grand jury to subpoena witnesses and take testimony under oath, 
would require a new law by the state Legislature.

<P>
A hidden video camera in an automatic teller machine was stolen by two men -- 
while it took pictures of them. 
</P>
<P>
And police have the film. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach Police Sgt. Andy Gonis said the thieves pried off the sides of 
the ATM outside Great American Bank, 301 Marine Ave., on Balboa Island, and 
ripped away a light panel Wednesday evening to get the the camera. The cameras 
are installed in some ATMs to deter robbery. 
</P>
<P>
But the film is stored in a separate unit, which the thieves left behind. And 
now officers, armed with the photographs, are searching for suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Gonis said the thieves caused $300 in damage, and escaped with the camera, 
valued at $1,000.

BOARD TO GET LAND LEASE OFFERS

<P>
The Huntington Beach Union High School District Board of Trustees has scheduled 
a public hearing Tuesday to receive proposals from five developers seeking to 
lease district-owned land at the intersection of Golden West and Gothard 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
The district is considering leasing 14 acres at the site, which is at the rear 
of Ocean View High School. 
</P>
<P>
The special meeting will be held at 7 p.m. at the district's headquarters, 
10251 Yorktown Ave. 
</P>
<P>
David Hagen, assistant superintendent for business services, said Thursday that 
the school board members will hear the development proposals but will not make 
a decision at the meeting on whether to accept any of the offers. He said the 
board would study the proposals and schedule a vote later on whether to lease 
the property. 
</P>
<P>
Hagen said a study group recommended about a year ago that the school board 
lease or sell the surplus land. He said the site includes the district's 
Guidance Center, but the district plans to move the center next year to vacant 
land on the Edison High School campus. The 14-acre parcel also contains a 
practice football field used by Ocean View High. The conditions of any lease of 
the land would require the developer to provide another football field on other 
vacant land at Ocean View High.

There are few things the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors love more than 
a good courtroom fight. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors have dispatched their lawyers to fight the efforts of the 
homeless mentally ill to gain easier access to shelter and food. They are 
opposing courtroom demands on behalf of children who are sexually abused in 
county-supervised foster homes. And of course, in their biggest legal battle, 
the supervisors are resisting the U.S. government. The Justice Department has 
sued the county over lack of Latino representation on the board. 
</P>
<P>
Thus it is surprising to learn that the supervisors backed away from a 
courtroom showdown with Abraham M. Lurie, a developer who leases prime 
waterfront land from the county at Marina del Rey and then builds on it. Over 
the years, Lurie has become the major leaseholder there, erecting a hotel, 
apartment, office building and retail empire. 
</P>
<P>
As a tenant, Lurie would drive most landlords nuts. His delinquent county 
property taxes reached almost $1 million before he paid them off. And he has 
yet to build a promised nine-story hotel on one of his sites. When the county 
demanded to see some action, Lurie had some pilings driven into the ground. 
Meanwhile, he pays just $1,001 a month in rent for the land, which is worth 
millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Stories in The Times this week revealed that Lurie was in financial trouble. To 
bail himself out, he sold a substantial portion of his holdings to businessmen 
he would not name. The stories, however, identified Lurie's new partners as 
wealthy Saudi businessmen with a liking for secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
The stories raised two questions: Why didn't the supervisors demand to know the 
identity of the purchasers, and why did they permit Lurie to treat his 
obligations to the county treasury in such a slow-paying manner? Why didn't the 
county take him to court, as most landlords would do? 
</P>
<P>
Lurie is one of the largest contributors to supervisorial political campaigns. 
A big campaign contribution might have some influence, but it usually isn't 
enough to make that kind of a difference. It is just one part of the puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
I asked county lawyers and private attorneys if there is another, more complex, 
reason why the supervisors treated Lurie so gently. 
</P>
<P>
The pragmatic answer I got was that a lawsuit would have driven Lurie into 
bankruptcy. The complex actions in bankruptcy court would have tied up the 
county for years, preventing it from evicting Lurie and turning the land over 
to another developer. It was better, the attorneys said, to save him so he 
could continue paying rent. 
</P>
<P>
That cautious approach seems inconsistent with the supervisors' tactics in 
other cases, where their attorneys pursue adversaries in an aggressive, 
scorched-earth fashion. The reason goes to the heart of what ails Los Angeles 
County government today. 
</P>
<P>
Marina del Rey, owned entirely by the county, contains some of the world's most 
valuable real estate. It has been pretty much the domain of whichever 
supervisor is representing the 4th District, which runs the length of the 
county coastline. First it was Burton Chace, when the county developed the 
marina in the 1960s. Then it was Jim Hayes, Yvonne Brathwaite Burke and now 
Deane Dana. The 4th District supervisor sets policy, and the others do not 
interfere. 
</P>
<P>
That's the way things are done in the county. Each supervisor is boss of his 
district, a sensible arrangement when it comes to handling local problems but 
bad public policy when the issue has implications for the entire county. In 
this case, it was particularly bad public policy. 
</P>
<P>
By the '70s, it was clear that the marina was pure gold. Yet, the politically 
influential leaseholders were able to resist rent increases that county 
officials now privately admit should have been imposed on them. 
</P>
<P>
The county agency responsible for the marina is the Department of Beaches and 
Parks. But its director has always been under the 4th District supervisor's 
thumb, a condition that has intensified ever since the supervisors were given 
broad power over executives' salaries. Disobedience now can cost a pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts have been made to break this pattern and tighten control over the 
marina. Supervisor Pete Schabarum and County Administrative Officer Richard 
Dixon got the county to hire an attorney, Richard Riordan, who negotiated rent 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
But those were surface fixes. The story of the gentle treatment accorded tenant 
Lurie shows the situation is in need of basic repair. The Board of Supervisors 
was theoretically in charge. Fourth District Supervisor Dana and Beaches and 
Parks chief Ted Reed were nominally responsible. But really, nobody was in 
charge.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STREET VENDORS PROTEST POLICE ARREST METHODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 70 demonstrators carrying signs that said "We are vendors, not 
criminals," and shouting in Spanish, "Work, yes. Repression, no," marched in 
front of the Rampart Police Division Headquarters on Thursday to protest what 
they said is excessive use of force by officers arresting street vendors near 
McArthur Park and other areas near downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The protest is the latest wrinkle in a long-running flap between street 
vendors, who say they are just trying to make a living, and police, who say the 
vendors are violating a city ordinance that prohibits pedestrians from selling 
food or merchandise on public streets. 
</P>
<P>
Several vendors in the crowd of protesters said police had roughed them up as 
they were arresting them, and had confiscated their merchandise. Rampart police 
did not return calls.

EX-CON INDICTED IN BANK ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An ex-convict has been indicted in Pennsylvania in the robbery of a Buena Park 
bank last year, accused of strapping what he said were explosives around a 
teller's waist and forcing her to help him take $190,000. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Stephen Gambin, 42, has also been indicted in a similar holdup last year 
in Torrance, where robbers got away with $410,000. 
</P>
<P>
Gambin remains a suspect in other robberies in Torrance, San Francisco and 
Florida, said Jim Neilson, an FBI spokesman in Los Angeles. The robberies, most 
involving the abduction of a bank employee, have netted nearly $1 million since 
April, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities arrested Gambin in Elgin, Ill., on June 2. He had been on 
parole since March, 1988, after serving 15 years in federal prison for a 1973 
Iowa bank robbery and a failed escape attempt three years later in which he 
shot two U.S. marshals, one of whom was left paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
Since his arrest, he has been held in the federal penitentiary in Lewisburg, 
Pa. Arraignment in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles has not been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Gambin's alleged crime spree began one month after his release from prison, FBI 
officials say. On April 25, 1988, three men in disguises held a Wells Fargo 
Bank manager and her son in a Torrance home overnight and then forced the woman 
to open the bank's vault before the branch opened. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 28 last year, in a similar incident, Gambin and another man allegedly 
wore black wigs and beards and forced their way into the La Habra apartment of 
a Buena Park bank teller, holding the woman and three family members at 
gunpoint until morning. 
</P>
<P>
They then forced the teller into a Security Pacific Bank branch, officials 
allege, after saddling her with a device that they claimed was a remote control 
bomb. It was fake and no one was injured, but the robbers got away with 
$190,000. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI believes that from Orange County, Gambin moved to southern Florida and 
last Nov. 4 made an unsuccessful attempt to rob a bank in the town of 
Plantation. The robbery was aborted when police came to the scene of a serious 
car crash nearby. In Ft. Lauderdale on Dec. 20, Gambin allegedly accosted an 
employee outside a bank and sent her inside to loot the safe, telling her, "By 
the way, we have your children." 
</P>
<P>
Gambin also is a suspect in a robbery attempt last May 5 at Security Pacific 
National Bank in Torrance. FBI officials said the robber told a bank employee 
that he was holding her children -- but she had no children. He had apparently 
confused her house with a neighbor's house where there were children. 
</P>
<P>
In the most recent incident, Gambin allegedly robbed a Bank of America branch 
in San Mateo on May 12. FBI officials say Gambin and an accomplice took a bank 
employee and her husband hostage at gunpoint and then ordered her to loot the 
vault. The employee dragged a bag with $269,200 to the waiting car, and the 
bandits fled. TED JOHNSON

FRIENDS CHIP IN FOR LEUKEMIA VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If a man's wealth can be measured by his friends, Jim Chiesa is rich. 
</P>
<P>
Chiesa, a 29-year-old leukemia victim, found that out this week. More than 100 
friends, relatives and neighbors jammed the Oso Viejo Community Center 
Wednesday night in an outpouring of support for the Mission Viejo resident, who 
is facing a life-threatening bone marrow operation. 
</P>
<P>
With his insurance benefits falling short of medical expenses, many Mission 
Viejo residents have vowed to rally around Chiesa and his wife and 2 
1/2-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Through mailers alone, supporters have raised $6,000 of the $80,000 not covered 
by insurance. Wednesday night's event laid the groundwork for several 
fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
In an emotional scene, Chiesa and his wife, Michelle, surprised the 
well-wishers by announcing that a two-month search for a bone marrow donor was 
finally successful. The crowd broke into applause. 
</P>
<P>
For people like Jim Chiesa, who suffers from acute leukemia, life is gauged by 
percentages. 
</P>
<P>
"Right off the bat, your chances of going into remission are one in three," 
said Thomas Herzog, a bone marrow transplant survivor who befriended Chiesa 
after hearing about his case. "Then if you make it into remission, your chances 
of relapsing are 80%." 
</P>
<P>
That is what makes quickly finding a bone marrow donor absolutely critical, 
Herzog said. Leukemia destroys the body's ability to manufacture healthy white 
blood cells that defend against disease. 
</P>
<P>
That Chiesa could find a donor at all was a minor miracle. Doctors say the 
chance of a non-relative matching bone marrow samples is about 15,000 to 1. 
Only about 55,000 people in the United States are registered bone marrow 
donors. But those odds pale in comparison to the obstacles Chiesa has already 
overcome, Herzog said. 
</P>
<P>
At least twice, his chances of surviving dwindled to less than 1%. Once, in 
December, 1988, his heart stopped for 15 minutes on the operating table before 
doctors were able to revive it. A few months later, Chiesa finished taking a 
drug that might reverse the disease. Bud Burgess, one of a series of family 
friends who spoke at the meeting, was there when a doctor told Chiesa the drug 
had failed. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't cry in front of you, Jim," Burgess said to Chiesa and the audience, 
"but that night, I went home and cried." 
</P>
<P>
Then, Chiesa said, an experimental drug became available that brought the 
leukemia into remission. 
</P>
<P>
A former Sunday school teacher at Saddleback Valley Community Church in Mission 
Viejo, Chiesa said he believes strongly that "God had a part in my remission. 
The doctor said when he came into my hospital room that it was truly a 
miracle." 
</P>
<P>
But Chiesa has one more set of odds to overcome: the 45% to 70% chance his 
doctor gives him for surviving the bone marrow transplant. "I'm happy that we 
found a donor," he said softly, "but I'm also very scared. The odds are against 
me, but I've beaten all the odds so far." FRANK MESSINA

NAVY ASKED TO HELP SAVE ILL DOLPHINS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The man who organized the largest count of bottlenose dolphins ever conducted 
in the United States is attempting another project involving dolphins, but this 
time he must win the cooperation of the U.S. Navy. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Kelly, a professor of marine biology at Orange Coast College in Costa 
Mesa, wants to establish a dolphin halfway house where sick animals can be 
treated and the effects of sewage dumping on local dolphins can be assessed. 
</P>
<P>
The center would also provide a place where dolphins captured for research or 
for shows can be readapted to the wild and set free. 
</P>
<P>
But the best location for the project happens to be Anaheim Bay, within an area 
controlled by the U.S. Naval Weapons Station in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no other location in Orange County that has clean water, is 
accessible yet protected," Kelly said. "You can't put this up in Newport Harbor 
or Dana Point. There are too many boats and too many people." 
</P>
<P>
The Navy is considering Kelly's proposal, but a decision may be several months 
away, according to Scott McDonald, director of the Anaheim Bay National 
Wildlife Refuge situated inside the weapons station. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald said he had discussed the proposal with Kelly and presented it to 
administrative officers, but would not speculate on the likelihood of approval. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly's studies have shown that dolphins living off the Orange County coastline 
are severely affected by pollution, and he wants to prevent last year's mass 
dolphin deaths on the East Coast from happening here. 
</P>
<P>
"After 2,000 dead dolphins washed up on beaches last year from New Jersey to 
Florida, a fact-finding commission was given $2 million to find out why. I'm 
trying to raise $200,000 to try to prevent a similar occurrence here," Kelly 
said. "In fact, the real question to be answered is why it hasn't happened 
already." 
</P>
<P>
A recent necropsy of a dolphin found on a local beach revealed that it 
"suffered several pathologies, (any) one of which would kill you or I," Kelly 
said. The dolphin had pneumonia, ulcers, a cancerous liver tumor and enlarged 
lymph glands, indicating the mammal's immune system was fighting off a major 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
Similar findings were made during examinations of other adult, juvenile and 
baby dolphins found dead on Orange County beaches and indicates that "something 
is going on within the entire dolphin population here," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
The increasing popularity of swim-with-dolphin attractions at resort hotels is 
creating an even greater need for a place where uncooperative dolphins can be 
readapted to ocean living and released. 
</P>
<P>
Dolphins no longer useful to scientific research facilities and dolphin shows 
are released into the ocean even though there is no evidence that they survive. 
Others, Kelly said, are warehoused until death in tanks at zoos, research 
facilities, even hotel swimming pools because there is no place where they can 
be rehabilitated or allowed to live out their lives semi-captive in an ocean 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly said the Anaheim Bay facility would consist of floating docks, access 
ramps, netted ocean pens and a simple structure. The facility would be built 
and operated by Kelly through the Orange Coast College marine sciences 
department. The school would partially fund the effort, but private donations 
are needed to make up the difference. Kelly estimates the facility would cost 
$200,000 to build and an additional $100,000 each year for operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly has received the support of the Hill, Farrer &amp; Burrill law firm in 
Los Angeles, which has promised free legal help to get necessary federal 
permits. Other supporters include the Orange County Sanitation Districts, the 
Cetacean Society of Orange County and several corporate and individual donors. 
</P>
<P>
Studies conducted by Rick O'Barry, the original trainer of the 1960s dolphin TV 
star Flipper, and the Oceanic Research Communications Alliance in Florida have 
proved the feasibility of dolphin rehabilitation, Kelly said. "But those were 
temporary projects, and an ongoing program is needed." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ken Norris, who heads a dolphin project at Long Marine Laboratory at UC 
Santa Cruz, said the real challenge is reintroducing captive dolphins back into 
established social groups. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not convinced yet of this readaptation concept. But I agree that times are 
changing and we need to adopt a new attitude towards research animals," Norris 
said. JANICE L. JONES

HOME-HEIGHT CURBS REJECTED BY PLANNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Clemente Planning Commission has voted to reject a proposal that would 
have placed restrictions on making single-story homes two or more stories. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners agreed in a 3-0 vote with one abstention that a proposed 
25-foot height limit for all houses in San Clemente would be too difficult to 
enforce because of the city's hilly terrain. 
</P>
<P>
"Uniformity is impossible," Commissioner Hal Joseph said. "You can't write an 
ordinance to treat San Clemente as one universe. It is too different in 
topography and in the kinds of neighborhoods it has." 
</P>
<P>
The request to study the proposed law was generated by the City Council in 
response to complaints that the city has inconsistent methods of calculating 
home heights. The council will review the Planning Commission recommendation at 
its Dec. 20 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Several property owners complained that the proposed home-height ordinance 
would lower property values by limiting what could be built on a parcel. They 
also said that it would be unfair to those who owned hillside property, because 
a three-story home could be built on a slope but could rise only 25 feet above 
street level. 
</P>
<P>
The commission urged residents of neighborhoods where one-story homes are 
preferred to place limits on second-story additions by using homeowners' 
association regulations, or by using land-associated laws known as "covenants, 
codes and restrictions." 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Jeff Goldfarb said that under existing laws, a group of residents 
could petition the council at any time to create a special zone that would 
prevent second-story additions in their neighborhoods. WENDY PAULSON

INTERIM POMONA JOB BEGUN BY EX-CHIEF

<P>
Kelson McDaniel, who was ousted as police chief in San Clemente in 1987 after 
officers complained about his management style, began work as interim police 
chief in Pomona last week, praising the attitude of officers he has met and 
insisting he has no instructions to fire anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona Mayor Donna Smith has said the city council, over her objections, fired 
the former police chief on Oct. 17 because he refused to fire a number of 
subordinates. Council members have denied that they have a "hit list," but have 
made it clear that they would like to see some officers depart. 
</P>
<P>
Acting City Administrator Tom Fee, who appointed McDaniel on Wednesday, said 
McDaniel "is highly qualified; he knows what he is doing and will provide our 
citizens with the level of police service they expect." 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel, 52, has more than 26 years in law enforcement, starting with the 
Newport Beach Police Department where he spent 17 years and rose to the rank of 
lieutenant. He served more than six years as police chief in Los Alamitos and 
then 18 months as chief in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel said he lost his job in San Clemente despite receiving superior 
evaluations from his city manager after police officers issued a vote of no 
confidence. The officers complained that McDaniel had a punitive and 
uncommunicative management style. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel sought and obtained a hearing after his dismissal. The hearing officer 
found some justification for firing McDaniel, but said he was dealing with 
problems, such as low police pay, that may have been beyond his control. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel said he felt vindicated by the hearing findings, but he did not get 
his job back, and has since been working with his wife in a real estate office. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente Peace Officers Assn. president Russ Moore, a detective on the San 
Clemente force, said he had no comment on McDaniel's new job. 
</P>
<P>
"We are under strict orders from the police chief not to say anything," Moore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente Police Chief Albert C. Ehlow, who succeeded McDaniel, could not be 
reached for comment late Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel said he has been eager to return to police work and will be a 
candidate for the permanent position of police chief in Pomona. The city is 
soliciting applications. MIKE WARD and WENDY PAULSON

Born a slave in 1818, Biddy Mason walked to California behind her Mississippi 
master's covered wagon, won her freedom in a Los Angeles court and saved the 
wages from her job as a midwife to buy a $250 plot near downtown's 4th and 
Spring streets in 1866. 
</P>
<P>
She built a wooden house, then a mixed-use brick building with business space 
on the first floor and her home above. From that home she founded a day nursery 
and a school and, in 1872, the First African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los 
Angeles. In 1885, her grandsons started a livery stable on the bustling block. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, which was declared "Biddy Mason Day in Los Angeles," her 
descendants returned to the site of the old homestead and snipped two ribbons 
at a new mixed-use building called the Broadway Spring Center. 
</P>
<P>
The first ribbon cutting officially opened the $24-million facility's 
1,274-space public parking garage, which will serve the Ronald Reagan State 
Building due to open across Spring Street next fall. 
</P>
<P>
The second ribbon, officially snipped by Biddy Mason's 95-year-old 
great-granddaughter, Gladys Owens Smith, was mounted on a new city monument to 
black history. 
</P>
<P>
Only after turning into the modern version of the livery will unsuspecting 
drivers see the monument by graphic designer Sheila Levrant de Bretteville. The 
memorial, located outside the garage's west end, is a striking 8-by-81-foot 
time-line wall of Los Angeles' and Mason's intertwined history during the 19th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
Any driver taking elevators to retrieve a car in the 10-story facility will see 
another public work of art, a collage reminiscent of Biddy Mason's original 
wood frame home, done by sculptor and assemblage artist Betye Saar. 
</P>
<P>
The melding of historic art with a functional parking structure -- "no small 
challenge . . . to do with dignity," noted James Wood of the Community 
Redevelopment Agency -- was accomplished through the joint efforts of the Power 
of Place, a UCLA-affiliated organization that promotes Los Angeles' 
multicultural history, and City Councilwoman Joy Picus. 
</P>
<P>
They persuaded city planners that the CRA requirement that developers provide 
public art in downtown projects could be used to memorialize Biddy Mason's 
pioneer contributions to the city. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just marvelous," said Smith, accompanied by her great-granddaughter, 
Linda Cox, and Cox's daughters, Cheryl, 11, and Robynn, 9. 
</P>
<P>
"More people will see this in a parking garage, and recognize what she did, 
than they would a painting somewhere else," said Smith, who was in no way upset 
that her energetic ancestor has been memorialized in a parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
The new complex, which stretches from Spring Street on the east to Broadway on 
the west mid-block between 3rd and 4th streets, will also include 35,000 square 
feet of retail space, sidewalk cafes and a food court, and a landscaped, walled 
and gated park. 
</P>
<P>
Parking is available now. The park is under construction. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Phillips of System Parking Investments, a co-developer in the project, 
said that although the street-level retail shops are not yet open, the space is 
65% leased. The center should be in full operation within six months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to concerns that the 3,000 future Reagan Building employees might 
not be safe in the area, which is on the edge of Skid Row, developer Robert 
Silberman of Allied Parking Ltd. said the complex will have 24-hour, 
state-of-the-art security designed by the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about homeless people who frequently sleep on nearby sidewalks, Silberman 
pointed out that even the park and food court will have locking gates. 
</P>
<P>
"They can still sleep on the sidewalk," he said. "We are not building a park 
for people to sleep in."

DEPUTIES SLAM THE BRAKES ON EAST L.A. TIRE STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies had long suspected that the innocuous 
little tire store on Whittier Boulevard in East Los Angeles was doing more than 
selling retreads. 
</P>
<P>
Their suspicions were confirmed Thursday morning, when an unwitting customer 
wandered into Whittier Tire in search of some new wheels. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than offer the prospective tire buyer some Goodyears or Michelins, 
authorities said, store employees were scrambling to unload a 48-foot-long 
trailer filled with $1 million worth of brand-new television sets, 
videocassette recorders and microwave ovens. 
</P>
<P>
"His impression was that there was more electronic equipment for sale than 
tires," Sgt. Mike Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
The customer, whose name was not released, called the Sheriff's Department 
about 9 a.m. to report the unusual activity. Deputies arrived a few minutes 
later to arrest the owner, Antonio Coronel, 41, and five other men. 
</P>
<P>
All were booked on suspicion of grand theft and were held at the East Los 
Angeles sheriff's station in lieu of $100,000 bond each. 
</P>
<P>
Allen said the tire store had been under surveillance as a possible "fencing" 
operation, a distributor of stolen goods. 
</P>
<P>
But deputies said something went horribly wrong for the suspected fences early 
Thursday morning when they landed what may have been their biggest heist ever 
-- the trailer of electronic equipment from a Circuit City store in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The unattached trailer had been parked behind the store warehouse, deputies 
said. Sometime before dawn, the thieves took the trailer simply by hooking it 
up to their own truck, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
After a 10-mile drive to the East Los Angeles tire store, the thieves 
apparently discovered that they had become the victims of their own success, 
Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
Normally the stolen goods would have been quietly stored in a shed and then 
distributed to safe houses set up at nearby residences, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
But on Thursday, Allen said, "they had so many boxes they couldn't fit them in 
the tire store discreetly." When deputies arrived, the store employees had 
emptied three-quarters of the boxes into their own steel containers. 
</P>
<P>
Coronel's wife, Maria, was also arrested at the store for allegedly trying to 
obstruct the deputies, authorities said. Deputies said they also planned to 
serve search warrants at some nearby residences. 
</P>
<P>
A Circuit City truck arrived at the tire store around noon to take the trailer 
of electronic equipment and major appliances back to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Workers at the appliance store were taking inventory of the recovered goods 
Thursday afternoon. They were relieved to discover that none of the equipment 
was missing. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby residents and merchants said they were surprised that their neighborhood 
tire store had been raided. 
</P>
<P>
A gas station attendant said he had seen trailers pull up to the store before 
but never suspected that they may have contained stolen goods.

SANTA ANA HEIGHTS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Edwin C. Hall started fighting the county over airport noise in 1977. That was 
four suits, numerous newspaper articles, hundreds of phone calls and, by his 
estimate, 3 million words ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I've written to everyone including the President," said Hall, 64, who moved 
into what was the quiet neighborhood of Santa Ana Heights 25 years ago. His 
dreams of a peaceful retirement home have long since been shattered by the roar 
of airplanes flying in and out of the county-operated John Wayne Airport, just 
to the northeast. 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes to government, they really have a license to steal," Hall 
complained this week. 
</P>
<P>
But not far from the Hall residence live Kelly and Wesley Beavers, who bought 
their home in Santa Ana Heights from the county earlier this year. They say 
they're the ones -- not county government -- who got the steal. 
</P>
<P>
"The houses we looked at in other areas were so small and much more expensive," 
said Kelly Beavers. As for the airplanes, she said, "I have parrots, and 
they're noisier." 
</P>
<P>
As neighbors in the Sherwood Estates section of Santa Ana Heights, the two 
couples represent opposites sides of a controversy that has dogged the county 
for more than a decade and shows no sign of going away any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago the county adopted a three-part program that was supposed to 
mend fences with airport neighbors fed up with the noise. But residents 
complain -- and some county officials concede -- that much of the program has 
been slow getting off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
As one of the first steps under the noise relief program adopted by the Board 
of Supervisors in 1986, the county rezoned some of the noisiest areas around 
the airport from residential to industrial to forestall future homeowner 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
The other two parts of the plan applied to about 460 existing homes or 
apartments in Santa Ana Heights. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners were given until March, 1987, to opt for a buyout under which the 
county would purchase the homes of residents who couldn't take the noise. Then 
the county was to insulate the houses against noise and resell them. It is one 
of these homes where the Beavers now live. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that bad when the windows are closed," said Kelly Beavers. "It's not 
even a roar. It's just like a muffle." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, 72 homeowners opted for the buyout. But county officials say the 
number of participants has since dwindled to 44. Of those, county officials 
have completed purchase of 20 and resold half a dozen. The others are under 
renovation and should be sold by the end of next summer, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, who did not sign up for the program, contends that homeowners dropped out 
because of long delays and below-market purchase prices offered them by the 
county. He complains that four county-owned houses near his home remain vacant 
and are a fire hazard. 
</P>
<P>
But county officials say many of the homeowners decided not to sell because of 
another more popular option offered by the county. Homeowners have until the 
end of 1990 to sign up for $25,000 worth of sound insulation -- including 
stronger, thicker doors and windows and air conditioning -- in exchange for 
giving up their right to sue over the noise as long as it remains under a 
certain decibel level. 
</P>
<P>
Already 102 homeowners and the proprietors of 198 apartments in two complexes 
have agreed to the deal, according to county records. Work on about 40 of the 
homes is expected to begin early next year. Completing work on all the homes 
and apartments is likely to take another three or four years, said Micki 
Harris, a county environmental planner who is overseeing the program. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a little slow, but once we get going we should really start cranking 
them out," Harris said. "We've gotten a good turnout. We're pretty pleased." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas F. Hogan is among the 100 or so residents who haven't chosen either 
program. At 78, Hogan said, he has no plans to move and would miss the summer 
breezes from the ocean channel behind his home if he were forced to close his 
windows and turn on air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
He would never, in any case, give up the rights to the airspace over his home, 
Hogan says, and so he'll just wait it out and see what happens. 
</P>
<P>
That's the attitude of many folks in the neighborhood these days, Hall said. He 
is not planning on doing much of anything either. 
</P>
<P>
"We've all adopted the happy-go-lucky" attitude, Hall said. "Otherwise we'd be 
chewing all our fingernails off."

TIME CATCHES UP TO TITANS' GRAVES

<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Pringle and Obie Graves first crossed paths long before 1989 and the quest 
to become the most-traveled Cal State Fullerton running back in history. 
</P>
<P>
It was the spring of 1988 and Pringle, preparing to suit up as a Titan for the 
first time, went on a numbers search, trying to find the proper jersey 
designation for a runner of his stature. 
</P>
<P>
He wound up getting a history lesson instead. 
</P>
<P>
"He was looking at all the running back numbers -- 24, 26, 27, 28," Graves 
remembers. "But he wanted 25. He kept saying, 'Where's No. 25 at?' 
</P>
<P>
"One of the coaches had to tell him that 25 was in a cabinet, getting dust on 
it." 
</P>
<P>
It had been there since 1978 -- to date, the only Fullerton football jersey to 
have been retired. 
</P>
<P>
And it belonged to Graves -- to date, the only Fullerton football player to 
have led the nation in rushing. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when I was introduced to him," said Graves. 
</P>
<P>
And was Pringle impressed? 
</P>
<P>
Mainly with himself, according to Graves. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me, 'I can play here. I can break records here,' " Graves said, 
laughing at the recollection. "He said, 'This is my type of offense. I'll do 
well here.' " 
</P>
<P>
Graves took an immediate liking to the youngster. 
</P>
<P>
"A young, small back . . . and a little cocky," Graves said. "Just like me." 
</P>
<P>
Now that Pringle is closing in on Graves' other number -- 1,789 rushing yards, 
the Fullerton and Big West Conference single-season record -- Graves can't help 
but let the memories come rushing back. 
</P>
<P>
He remembers the conversation he had with Pringle following the Titans' 1988 
spring game, when Michael Moore was the incumbent at tailback and Pringle just 
another challenger. 
</P>
<P>
"He came to me and said, 'Obie, I'm better than him,' " Graves said. "He said, 
'I can outrun him. I'm sweeter than him.' " 
</P>
<P>
Graves remembers saying the same thing about Dwayne Sims more than a decade 
earlier, when Sims was still the only Fullerton player who had rushed for 1,000 
yards in one season. 
</P>
<P>
"Eleven years ago, I told Dwayne Sims I was going to break his record -- in 
seven games," Graves said. "He told me his record (1,071 yards) was going to 
last 20 years. I told him him I was taking him down in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
"After seven games, I was 40 yards short." 
</P>
<P>
Most of all, Graves remembers the time Fullerton's football coach pulled his 
star running back from a game only yards shy of a rushing record. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going for 300 yards against Long Beach State," Graves recalls. "No one 
at Fullerton had ever done that. I had 291 yards in the fourth quarter but we 
were winning big and the coach took me out. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me, 'We're not here to break records.' " 
</P>
<P>
History's mistakes apparently go unheeded at Fullerton. Eleven years before 
Pringle and Gene Murphy and New Mexico State, the Titans had Graves and Jim 
Colletto and Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
At this school, running backs are pulled more often than offensive guards. 
</P>
<P>
Graves, however, defends Murphy and the Substitution That Shook Santa Ana 
Stadium two weeks ago. Graves, who describes himself as "a diehard Titan fan," 
still gets a sideline pass for Fullerton home games and was there on the 
fateful afternoon against New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest, I don't think Coach Murphy knew he was that close to the 
record," Graves said. "At the time, I didn't know what the record was. And the 
situation he was in -- Mike was tired after making a long run, (New Mexico 
State) fumbled the ball, we were up by almost 40 points and there were kids 
who'd been practicing all year he wanted to get into the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Coach Murphy seriously knew. He's too good of a coach to let 
something like that happen. . . . In my case with Colletto, he wanted to play 
the other kid, Jay Bennett. Bennett was his guy." 
</P>
<P>
That's another controversy, best saved for another time. But in short: Bennett 
had been Fullerton's leading rusher in 1977 and in 1978, Graves always felt as 
if he was ruining Colletto's best-laid plans by outrunning Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
"The first 3 1/2 games of that year, I was trading off with Jay Bennett," 
Graves said. "I had 500 yards in three games and I was still trading off. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'd played all season long, I know I would've gotten over 2,000 yards." 
</P>
<P>
As it was, Graves finished with 1,789 -- then the fourth-highest total in NCAA 
history, behind Tony Dorsett (1,948 in 1976), Ed Marinaro (1,881 in 1971) and 
Ricky Bell (1,875 in 1975). Today, Graves' total stands at No. 12. 
</P>
<P>
After outrushing the entire nation in 1978 -- Oklahoma's Billy Sims and USC's 
Charles White were among his contemporaries -- Graves embarked on a 
professional football odyssey that dragged him through two countries, three 
leagues and seven organizations in six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Too small (5-feet-9, 178) and too slow (4.7 in the 40) to be drafted by the 
NFL, Graves wound up trying out as a punt returner with the Raiders in 1979. He 
was cut. Then came a tryout with the Rams in 1980. He lasted until the 
next-to-last cut. 
</P>
<P>
After that, Graves says, "I got pulled up to Canada," where he became the 
unofficial trial sample of the Canadian Football League. Everyone had to have 
one. In four years, Graves played for four teams -- Hamilton in 1980, Winnipeg 
in 1981, Toronto in 1982 and British Columbia in 1983, when he was released. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there was a desperate stab at a new position, wide receiver, in a new 
league, the USFL. Graves didn't make it through training camp with the Denver 
Gold and in 1984, with no more leagues to turn to, he called it a career. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Graves is 32 and an employee of South Bay Hospital in Redondo Beach. His 
position? "I'm the director for the Department of Environmental Service 
Engineers," he says. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1978, Graves was Cal State Fullerton's director for the Department of 
Oblong Projectile Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
To put it another way, Graves heads the hospital's janitorial department. 
</P>
<P>
"A nice, easy job for an old running back," he says, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
At least, he has Saturday afternoons off, which enables him to hang out with 
old buddy and teammate Dale Bunn, the Titans' linebacker coach, and watch 
Pringle chip away at his claim to fame. Right now, Pringle is within 180 yards 
of the record -- giving Graves' presence on the Fullerton sidelines the air of 
impending occasion. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky had Gordie Howe, Mike Pringle has Obie Graves. Entourage for a 
countdown. 
</P>
<P>
Graves claims he's pulling for Pringle to reach 1,790 at San Jose State 
Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope with my heart he does it," Graves said. "I've had my fun. He's played a 
hard schedule and he's run hard for every yard he gets. He deserves it. 
</P>
<P>
"And, if he gets it, that'll put more money in his pocket. To the pro scouts, 
those stats look good." 
</P>
<P>
As will Titan jersey No. 27, destined for the same cabinet as old No. 25, if 
and when.

JULIAN FINDS THE SPEED TO KEEP IN STEP WITH FAMILY TRADITION; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: LA QUINTA RUNNING BACK OVERCOMES KNEE INJURY TO FOLLOW IN ATHLETIC 
FOOTSTEPS OF HIS FATHER AND UNCLE.

<P>
There has never been any doubt that Trent Julian, La Quinta High School's 
running back, would be a good athlete. He apparently has the genes. 
</P>
<P>
His father, Tom, was the Garden Grove League player of the year in 1967 as a 
senior tailback for Bolsa Grande. He received a scholarship from Arizona State, 
where he played defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
His uncle, Randy, who also played football for Bolsa Grande, was the state 
champion in the 440-yard run in 1965. He went on to the University of Kansas 
and ran with Jim Ryun, who held the world record for the mile run from 
1966-1975. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was, although Trent Julian inherited plenty of heart and desire, he 
appeared to have come up short on speed from the family gene pool. 
</P>
<P>
"I was praying I was going to get it," Julian, 17, said. "I was working really 
hard on it, doing a lot of stretching, lunges and jump roping and just working 
hard on it." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at the end of last summer, just in time for his senior season of 
football, Julian got his gift. 
</P>
<P>
While Julian received one thing, another was taken away. He dropped his 40-yard 
time two ticks to 4.7 seconds, but he tore a cartilage in his knee in a 
scrimmage the week before the season opener. That injury has caused him to miss 
two games, plus two days of practice each week. His accomplishments this season 
are even greater considering that he's playing hurt. He will have surgery to 
repair the cartilage after the football season and plans to play varsity 
basketball this season. 
</P>
<P>
Julian is the top offensive weapon for La Quinta, which plays Valencia in the 
opening round of the Southern Section Division VI playoffs at 7:30 tonight at 
Valencia. In eight games he has rushed for 508 yards in 97 carries, caught 24 
passes for 424 yards and scored 16 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"He has great peripheral vision and a real feel for where the defenders are," 
La Quinta Coach Roger Takahashi said. "He makes unbelievable cuts at the last 
minute, which either breaks open a run or gets him an extra three to five 
yards." 
</P>
<P>
It is that cutting ability and his offseason work habits that make the 
6-foot-2, 185-pound Julian such a dangerous runner. 
</P>
<P>
Julian doesn't think of himself as a slashing type of runner and he says he 
doesn't have the ability to stop on a dime. He attributes his success to good 
vision. 
</P>
<P>
"That first guy I see doesn't bother me," he said. "I know I can get by. It's 
that second and third guy I pay attention to. If I can kind of lean them to one 
way, I can juke pretty good from there."

As Julian goes, so goes La Quinta's offense. And his is not a bad frame to 
build an offense around. Against Rancho Alamitos he scored on a 34-yard run and 
a 65-yard screen pass the first two times he touched the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a one-man show against us," Rancho Alamitos Coach Mark Miller said. 
"You can stop him 10 times but on the 11th time, BOOM, he breaks it." 
</P>
<P>
Miller teaches at Rancho Alamitos with Julian's father and has been a family 
friend for several years. He has seen a marked change in Julian's speed. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first saw him against us as a sophomore, he didn't really stand out 
speed-wise but he was just a young kid out there," Miller said. "I think he 
just physically matured and grew a couple of inches. (This year) I noticed in 
the films him running away from people and running by people. Before, he was 
not slow but he wasn't the breakaway threat. Last year he was a quarterback so 
maybe he wasn't in a position where he was able to show his speed." 
</P>
<P>
Julian is following a tad slower, but he is following in his father's 
footsteps. Both were versatile, standout athletes in the Garden Grove League. 
Trent also plays varsity basketball. Like his father, he was a quarterback his 
junior year, then a running back his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
Julian, one of La Quinta's team team captains, is an extremely level-headed 
young man, Takahashi said. "He's a really good kid, not arrogant or selfish," 
the coach said. "He always congratulates his offensive line and quarterback . . 
. he sets a good team example." 
</P>
<P>
Julian, whose parents are divorced, lives with his father, who coached La 
Quinta's freshman team to a league title in Trent's freshman year. "I've been 
playing football since Day 1," Julian said. "My first birthday I got a Nerf 
football and ever since then that ball was never out of my hands. I just love 
football and whatever it takes, that is what will be done." 
</P>
<P>
Julian has been contacted by several colleges and plans to play in college, 
which is one reason he trains so diligently in the offseason. And when the 
going gets tough, he turns to his dad. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad, he really knows how to motivate me about work habits and football and 
school. He always tells me, 'Trent, if you don't want to do it, there is 
probably someone in Oklahoma or Kansas or Tennessee who will want to do it even 
more.' "

MOTHERWAY HAS FOUND HIS RIGHTFUL PLACE IN LINE AT MATER DEI THIS SEASON;

<P>
FOOTBALL: LINEMAN FOLLOWS TWO BROTHERS WHO ALSO WERE STANDOUTS ON THE MONARCHS' 
OFFENSIVE FRONT.

<P>
Ryan Motherway has heard about the tradition of exceptional offensive linemen 
at Mater Dei High School. He has heard about their great girth, speed -- for 
big guys, anyway -- and their advancement into the college ranks. 
</P>
<P>
And frankly, he's not all that impressed. 
</P>
<P>
Motherway, a 6-foot-4, 255-pound senior lineman at Mater Dei, has his own, 
higher expectations. After all, family bragging rights are at stake. 
</P>
<P>
He'll get another chance to show off his considerable talents when Mater Dei 
(6-4) takes on Redlands (8-2) in a first-round Southern Section Division I 
playoff game at 7:30 tonight at University of Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
Brothers Mike (Mater Dei, class of 1986) and Tom (1984) played on the Monarchs' 
offensive line. Keeping up with his brothers has been difficult enough. 
</P>
<P>
After standout seasons at Mater Dei, Motherway's older brothers went on to play 
in college. Mike played for a season at Princeton before quitting to 
concentrate on his studies. Tom played one season at Air Force, quit and 
transferred to UCLA. He made the team as a walk-on during his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
Following his brothers' lead, Motherway is intent on playing college football. 
Certainly, he's off to a good start. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important," Motherway said. "It's a family matter. They're my brothers." 
While at Mater Dei, he has played with some of the biggest and best linemen in 
Orange County. Motherway has started for two seasons. A year ago, he played 
alongside a line that weighed in at a combined 1,295 pounds. Two of the best, 
Brian Turk (6-4, 265) and Rick Pallow (6-3, 240), are at Pacific 10 schools. 
Turk plays at USC and Pallow is at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Here, too, Motherway worked hard to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to play up with them," he said. "They made me better." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Motherway is glad the others graduated. 
</P>
<P>
"I was overlooked a lot last year," he said. "I was always the 'small one' or 
the 'young one.' Now, I'm in the spotlight." 
</P>
<P>
An offseason in the Mater Dei weight room has helped push Motherway into the 
limelight. 
</P>
<P>
Kerry Crabb, Mater Dei's strength coach, has noticed a dramatic improvement in 
Motherway's on-the-field performance. 
</P>
<P>
"From last season to this, he's increased his overall strength," Crabb said. 
"The kid trains with such intensity. He's got good explosive power and good 
quickness. And with his size, that makes him a dominant player." 
</P>
<P>
Motherway, who calls weightlifting a "hobby," can bench press 335 pounds, squat 
420 and clean and power 255. 
</P>
<P>
Expectations were high at Mater Dei when the season began. A new coach, Bruce 
Rollinson, had taken over and the Monarchs had an impressive cast of veteran 
players in the starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Dan O'Neil and running back Kealii Clifford were two important 
players Motherway was assigned to protect. 
</P>
<P>
But the season began in disappointing fashion. Mater Dei lost to Fountain 
Valley, 28-22, in the opening game. Then the Monarchs lost to Tustin, 21-20, 
and Santa Ana, 29-14. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs were in desperate straits when they faced Edison in the fourth 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"It got pretty shaky the first couple of weeks," Motherway said. "Coach Crabb 
came in and told us before the Edison game that no Mater Dei team had gone 0-4. 
We got fired up and beat Edison." 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei has won six of its past seven games, including a 21-14 victory over 
Edison to break the losing streak and avoid an 0-4 record. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got it turned around now," Motherway said. "I think the team, especially 
the seniors, has jelled."

SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION VIII FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS;

LAGUNA HILLS WINS ON FINAL PLAY

Fullback Mark Mitchell, who had fumbled the ball away at the Yucaipa 12-yard 
line on a previous drive, scored the winning touchdown with no time remaining 
to give Laguna Hills a 16-13 victory over previously undefeated Yucaipa in the 
Division VIII playoffs Thursday night at the University of Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
However, it wasn't Mitchell's dive off left tackle that was special, but the 
way the Hawks (6-5) got to the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks got the ball back after Mitchell's fumble with 1:58 left at their 48. 
</P>
<P>
Five plays later, quarterback Mark Wells ran out of bounds at the Yucaipa six 
with 52 seconds left. Then Yucaipa's perfect season collapsed under a hail of 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Fino was called for a face mask violation. Then cornerback Wes Samuelsen 
was called for pass interference in the end zone with seven seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
On the next play, Samuelsen was called for holding on Wells' keeper as time ran 
out. That set the stage for Mitchell's plunge from the one with no time left. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell had scored on a one-yard run to cut a Yucaipa lead to 13-10 after 
starting tailback Marwan Saba was taken off the field with a dislocated elbow. 
Saba, who gained 165 yards in 23 carries, was submarined by Yucaipa's Beau 
Smith with 10:51 left. 
</P>
<P>
But until the final drive, Laguna Hills' luck was all bad. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Brodbeck missed a 39-yard field goal. Laguna Hills also had a first 
quarter 18-yard touchdown pass from Wells to Darrin Chapman called back because 
of a holding penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Then Yucaipa (10-1)scored its second touchdown after a fluke pass play gave the 
Thunderbirds the ball at the Laguna Hills' 15. The score was set up by a 
32-yard pass from Bob Taylor to Sean Arend. Laguna Hills coach Steve Bresnahan 
argued that Arend was a "sleeper receiver" and had not stood within 15 yards of 
the huddle as the pass was being called. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Taylor hit Todd Lemanski for a 15-yard touchdown pass to give Yucaipa a 
13-3 lead.

New Leases on Life: It's been a good week for The Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
Late last week, the huge Newport Beach developer and landowner signed one of 
the largest office leases in the county, a $60-million deal with the law firm 
of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher for space in a new office building at Jamboree 
Center in Irvine. Then early this week, the company signed a large lease for 
industrial space with a software firm. 
</P>
<P>
State of the Art Accounting Software Inc. of Costa Mesa took 71,000 square feet 
in a two-story building at the Lakeview Business Center in the Irvine Spectrum. 
The lease calls for rent of $4 million over five years.

INVESTORS SEE POTENTIAL, PITFALLS IN EAST BLOC 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While Solidarity leader Lech Walesa stood before Congress this week and asked 
for assistance for the ailing economies of Eastern Europe, Carey Vigor-Zierk 
was sitting at her home computer and working on ways that she might lend a 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
Vigor-Zierk, a third-generation Polish-American, has formed a small company 
that is trying to obtain computer equipment for Poland's first alternative high 
school. But she has run into a lot of bureaucratic red tape. In several months, 
her company has managed to get only one personal computer into the hands of the 
First Communal High School in Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
But the Santa Ana physician says her efforts have not dampened her optimism for 
doing business in Poland. Although the school project is not intended to be a 
money-making venture, she says she's been swamped with requests for information 
from Polish firms interested in buying computers and other electronics gear. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't have anything over there, not even something like fax paper. It's 
just unbelievable," said Vigor-Zierk, who visited Poland for two months last 
summer. Vigor-Zierk calls her company Jobs-RX Inc. and operates it out of her 
home office, where her desk is decorated with a red "Free Poland: Solidarnosc" 
sticker. 
</P>
<P>
The political and economic reforms sweeping through the Eastern Bloc countries 
of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria and the Soviet Union 
offer the potential for stronger business ties between the United States and 
the East. And some Orange County business people are starting to pay closer 
attention to developments there. 
</P>
<P>
"As things have slowly changed in Eastern Europe during the past year, most of 
our companies have shown some interest," said Susan Lentz, executive director 
of the World Trade Center Assn. of Orange County, which has 800 members. "And 
we've had (queries from) a number of Czechs, Bulgarians, Yugoslavians and other 
Eastern European nationals who want to establish closer ties and assist 
companies in going over there." 
</P>
<P>
No one keeps figures on Orange County companies doing business with the East 
Bloc, but local trade and business officials say there is little activity so 
far, particularly outside of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Trade specialists say business ties between the United States and Eastern Bloc 
have been limited by a number of factors. Perhaps the most important factors 
are Eastern Europe's debt-ridden economies and lack of currency from the West 
with which to buy the West's products and services. 
</P>
<P>
"The complicating factor in the past has been that they didn't have the money 
to buy the goods," said Keith Crane, an economist with the RAND Corp. in Santa 
Monica. "That problem isn't going to change quickly. But Poland and Hungary, in 
particular, have been opening up their countries to foreign investment." 
</P>
<P>
An example, Crane noted, is General Electric Co.'s announcement Wednesday that 
it will pay $150 million to buy 50% of a Hungarian light-bulb maker, the 
largest Western investment in Hungary since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"As these U.S. investments increase, these East Bloc companies will begin to 
export products and the countries will have more money to buy goods," Crane 
said. He said he expects to see a substantial increase in East-West trade 
within the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential for doing business in these countries is huge," said Dennis J. 
Aigner, dean of the Graduate School of Management at UC Irvine, who in 
September visited the Soviet Union with several local business people. "There 
is a huge pent-up demand for goods." 
</P>
<P>
Eastern Bloc nations are especially eager to acquire Western technology, such 
as personal computers. The Commerce Department earlier this year eased 
restrictions on the type of computers that can be exported to Eastern Europe, 
permitting all but the most advanced PCs to be shipped to the East. 
</P>
<P>
The Eastern Bloc reforms are welcome news to Western Digital Corp., an Irvine 
computer products company that has been frustrated in its efforts to forge ties 
with Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1988, Western Digital signed an agreement to sell $1.3-million worth 
of personal-computer hard-disk drives to a Bulgarian company in one of the 
first high-technology sales to that country by a U.S. firm and was viewed by 
the company as entree into Eastern Europe. But, 16 months later, the U.S. 
government still has not approved the sale. The deal involved disk drives of 
the type that might be used in an International Business Machines PC-XT model, 
a roughly 6-year-old technology.

"We are still in the process of obtaining approval," said Western Digital 
spokesman Robert Blair, who added that he was not sure why the approval was 
taking so long. "With the recent wave of change in Eastern Europe, we are 
cautiously optimistic about getting approval." 
</P>
<P>
Blair said Western Digital has received government approval to sell a small 
number of computer graphics circuit boards to Bulgaria and has sold some 
circuit boards and disk drives to Yugoslavia. He said the firm also has had 
talks with officials in Hungary, Poland and the Soviet Union about doing 
business in those nations. 
</P>
<P>
"We view the East Bloc nations as having a tremendous potential," he said. 
</P>
<P>
UCI's Aigner cautions that companies looking to make a fast buck in Eastern 
Europe will probably face disappointment. "The market distribution systems in 
these countries are in shambles," he said. "You have to go in there with a view 
toward helping to create and develop a market for your products. If you don't 
do that, the risks are very great." 
</P>
<P>
Trade specialists say the rules of doing business in Eastern Europe are 
changing quickly and vary from country to country. For example, the Soviet 
Union, Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia allow joint ventures and Western 
ownership of a business, but East Germany prohibits such ventures. 
</P>
<P>
Vigor-Zierk says she would like to set up a joint venture in Poland that would 
export computers and other products. But she has been discouraged by the 
minimum $50,000 investment the Polish government requires before a Western firm 
can set up a joint venture there. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been doing some preliminary market research and we're finding that it 
could take one year for our contacts in Poland to get an export license," 
Vigor-Zierk said. "I have a lot of optimism, but for now I'm not jumping into 
the private, for-profit arena." 
</P>
<P>
For now, she said her company -- which is working with an Irvine schoolteacher 
-- is searching for government funding and private corporate support to help 
equip a computer and language laboratory at the Warsaw high school. The 
objective: to help the school's 60 ninth-graders learn about computers and 
study English.

ONLY COUNTY-BASED AIRLINE PREPARES BANKRUPTCY FILING 
</P>

Resort Commuter airline, which operated as Pan Am Commuter, has suspended 
service and is preparing to file for bankruptcy protection from creditors, its 
president said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Chapter 11 filing "is imminent," said Robert O'Keefe, president and chief 
executive of Resort Commuter Inc. 
</P>
<P>
O'Keefe said that Resort officials are talking to several potential buyers, 
including another airline, but added that he "would not call any of the 
discussions serious at this point." 
</P>
<P>
He said the carrier has been losing about $100,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Resort's financial problems stem from an ill-fated attempt last year to operate 
daily service from Southern California to the Baja California resort towns of 
Cabo San Lucas, La Paz and Loreto. 
</P>
<P>
That service ended in May, limiting the airline's routes to seven daily round 
trips between John Wayne Airport and Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to stop all service Wednesday placed most of Resort's 30 employees 
on unpaid leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Resort, which started in 1983 as Catalina Commuter, has been the county's only 
locally based airline since AirCal was acquired by American Airlines in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
It has operated as Pan Am Commuter for the last two years under contract to 
serve Pan Am's Los Angeles fleet as a feeder carrier. It was one of five 
commuter lines operating from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Airport officials last month awarded Resort a 60% increase in its annual 
passenger allotment because its business had been picking up and it was in 
danger of exceeding the earlier annual limit of 15,500 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
But the additional business has not been enough to staunch the hemorrhaging 
caused by the Baja misadventure, O'Keefe said. 
</P>
<P>
The carrier, owned by Beverly Newport Aviation -- of which Newport Beach auto 
dealer Jim Slemons is a major shareholder -- agreed with creditors in July to 
reorganize in return for a moratorium on debt collection and a debt-for-equity 
swap, O'Keefe said. 
</P>
<P>
Resort said at the time that it had $525,000 in assets and $17 million in debt, 
including nearly $12 million owed to Jim Slemons Leasing, which leases three 
18-seat deHavilland Twin Otter turboprop planes to Resort. 
</P>
<P>
But efforts to find more capital -- through operating economies or new 
investors -- so far have failed.

PARENTS' GROUP IS RELENTLESS IN URGING CHANGES AT SCHOOL

Martha Harvey thinks it's just a matter of setting a good example. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey is president of the A. Phillip Randolph High School Parents Assn., and 
it's a commitment she and her fellow board members take seriously. They meet 
through the summer and at least two times a month during the school year. Some 
even give up vacation time. And some stay on after their own kids graduate, to 
help the next group learn the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that by doing, we exemplify what we expect our kids to do," Harvey 
says. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a group that runs bake sales. They press the school for real 
changes, such as mid-term reports, which teachers resisted. 
</P>
<P>
They also run political interference at the Board of Education for Lottie 
Taylor, the principal, such as supporting her in cutting an administrator 
instead of a classroom teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor encourages such involvement. To her, lack of parent participation is an 
obstacle in obtaining her pet school reform: vouchers to let families shop for 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor is all for parental choice. 
</P>
<P>
But she thinks the voucher lobby talks too much about choice and not enough 
about responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a broader obligation on the part of the parent once he chooses. The 
parent has to be a real parent."

TIME IS ALWAYS OF THE ESSENCE FOR THIS TRUE CLOCK WATCHER

<TEXT>
<P>
We were a bit late, wouldn't you know it, for an interview with the man who 
pays more attention to the time than anyone in this country. 
</P>
<P>
So when we entered the tiny paper-strewn office of our nation's timekeeper, we 
asked just what time it was. 
</P>
<P>
"This, of course, is exactly right," he said in a heavy Austrian accent, 
pointing confidently to an unadorned black and white clock on the wall, the 
only one in the room. "You can check it." 
</P>
<P>
With that, Dr. Gernot M.R. Winkler, director of the U.S. Time Service 
Department, picked up the receiver of his desk phone and dialed direct to his 
personal ally in the quest to form a more perfect world through the 
synchronization of time -- the master clock of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"U.S. Naval Observatory Master Clock. At the tone, Eastern Daylight Time, 14 
hours, 49 minutes, 38 seconds, beep. Universal Time, 18 hours 49 minutes 43 
seconds, beep." 
</P>
<P>
The message coming through the receiver was clear and ungarbled. It's exactly 
what Winkler expects from the master clock, a technological marvel that looks 
like a huge rack of audio equipment with a digital time readout and sits 
quietly in an environmentally controlled room about 10 paces from his office. 
</P>
<P>
It's the keeping of precise time by this clock that is responsible for 
maintaining order around the country. Without it, television broadcasts would 
interfere with each other, satellites would go haywire and planes and trains 
would never know when to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
My watch, a relatively inexpensive timepiece with a degree of accuracy that 
doesn't even merit mention in comparison with the master clock, said it was 
about 2:53 p.m. It was just a little fast, we learned, after receiving a couple 
of quick lessons in the more simple intricacies of the telling of time from the 
master himself -- the Time Lord, as Winkler's son has dubbed him. 
</P>
<P>
* Lesson One: The master clock tells time on a 24-hour system, widely used by 
the military and radio communications and scientific community. That means the 
day goes from 00:00 to 23:59. 
</P>
<P>
* Lesson Two: The world is broken into 24 time zones, so everybody has sunlight 
at noon and darkness at midnight. Of the 24 time zones, the United States is 
located in eight. Universal time is the time at the Greenwich meridian, the 
prime meridian from which all time zones radiate. The meridian passes through 
London. 
</P>
<P>
Those are the easy lessons, we were soon to discover. 
</P>
<P>
We traveled to the U.S. Naval Observatory, located on 75 acres in the northwest 
corner of the District of Columbia, which oversees the enormous task of keeping 
precise time. Vice President Dan Quayle lives in an aging mansion on these 
grounds, and his tennis court is within view of the tiny time service building 
housing Winkler, his small staff and his master clock. 
</P>
<P>
Winkler, 67, is a physicist and an astronomer who has been managing the time 
service department for nearly a quarter of a century. Time is a passion for 
this serious man, who speaks of his "aesthetic attraction" to things precise. 
</P>
<P>
Taking off his glasses and fidgeting with them, Winkler sat back in his thickly 
padded desk chair and looked over a desk full of paper. Then he 
matter-of-factly explained that the first thing we needed to understand about 
time is that there is no such thing. 
</P>
<P>
"The simplest thing to explain what time is is to explain that it is just an 
idea which we developed from change, and the abstract measure of that change is 
time," said Winkler with authority. "It's really a human invention." 
</P>
<P>
The nature of time also makes it a subject ideal for humor. The temptation to 
make a joke with every detail is so great, we discerned the answers to our most 
burning questions about time early in the interview. 
</P>
<P>
No, Winkler is very rarely late (he thinks it's "tactless and impolite"), he 
doesn't work around the clock, nor does he watch the clock all day to pass the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
He does have a theory of how to get more time in the day: 
</P>
<P>
"By not doing nonsense, useless things. Reading 99% of what is printed today. 
Listening to 99% of what people tell you. 
</P>
<P>
"In other words, by restricting yourself to the really valuable things, you 
have a big amount of time. You can be very well read by reading very little. 
Just don't fill your mind with garbage. That's the only way with which you can 
gain time. And a very effective one." 
</P>
<P>
Winkler said people take time for granted and don't really understand what the 
impact would be if time were not coordinated precisely. 
</P>
<P>
"The use of time is much more widespread than people realize. You may not know, 
for instance, that every television station operates on an atomic clock," which 
can be accurate to one second in every 300,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
"All the television stations, all the power stations, all the public services 
are very closely synchronized. If you drive an airplane, the systems that 
support that are very tightly synchronized. What we do is clear up the problems 
in all these stations in which we are in constant connection." 
</P>
<P>
Part of Winkler's job is to make adjustments to the clocks about once a year to 
synchronize the time determined by the rotation of the Earth with the time kept 
by the atomic clock. The Earth's rotation is not constant and slows over a 
period of time, so one second must be added to the master clock annually to 
synchronize the two. Called a leap second, it is based on the same principal as 
the leap day, which occurs once every four years. The leap day is necessary to 
synchronize the calendar year with the solar year, which also is slightly 
variable because of the inconsistency of the Earth's rotation. 
</P>
<P>
Winkler and his staff also provide astronomical data obtained from a variety of 
very sophisticated telescopes that measure the positions and movement of cosmic 
objects for use in navigation, space travel and scientific research.

PRINCIPLED PRINCIPAL SUCCEEDS IN HARLEM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The textbook budget is only $25 per student. In some classrooms, students can 
barely hear, what with carpenters' power saws whining in the halls. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the science teacher assigned by the Board of Education. A 
disaster. He has survived in the system because other principals chose to pass 
their problem along rather than endure an exhausting dismissal process. 
</P>
<P>
Small problems, perhaps, as things go in New York public schools. ("School 
Opens With a Murder" was the Newsday headline the day after summer vacation 
ended.) But Lottie Taylor isn't one to settle for less bad. She's on the phone, 
as she often is, wheeling and dealing like a general manager in the National 
Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe she can find a graduate student to "assist" the disappointing teacher. 
She raises money herself for just such emergencies, so she can avoid delays and 
red tape. It's not strictly by the book. But her students can't wait while the 
bureaucrats play games. 
</P>
<P>
"You do what you have to do to get the material across to your kids," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor is principal of the A. Phillip Randolph Campus High School in Harlem. 
Randolph, hailed by former Education Secretary William Bennett and the subject 
of a TV documentary, is an inner-city school that works. 
</P>
<P>
Randolph is a minority school. Three-quarters of the students are black, the 
other quarter Latino. Families of almost half the students receive public 
assistance. Yet more than 95% of Randolph graduates go to four-year colleges, 
many to the very finest. The dropout rate is less than 2%. 
</P>
<P>
While concerned parents and a bright student body certainly help, Taylor is by 
all accounts the guiding force. "She makes you believe anything is possible for 
these kids," says Martha Harvey, president of the school's Parents Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Taylor's plaudits have not spared her the daily harassments and absurdities 
of New York's public school bureaucracy. Her story shows that to make an urban 
school work, it's not enough to fight television and crack. One has to fight 
the system as well. 
</P>
<P>
"It can wear you down," Taylor says. "Yet I can't let that be an excuse to not 
educate the students the best that I can. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want to fire me -- no sweat," she says. "I will go out into the 
community and work with the parents." 
</P>
<P>
The first thing a visitor notices at Randolph is the order. The school occupies 
an old (1924) stone building on the fringe of City College next to the drug 
warren of St. Nicholas Park. Originally, Randolph was to be a model school, run 
jointly by the school system and the college. But 10 years of planning and 
union pressures diluted the idea. 
</P>
<P>
The previous principal, a white male, fell victim to bitter racial politics. By 
the time Taylor arrived, "things were just falling apart," recalls Margaret 
Ketly, a guidance counselor at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the wood is polished and the lockers work. Major renovation work is in 
progress. Visitors are greeted politely by a uniformed guard in a starched 
white shirt. Classes are purposeful and planned to the last detail. 
</P>
<P>
Students waiting to speak with a visiting reporter (who arrives, sheepishly, 15 
minutes late) are put to work stuffing envelopes. "There is something to do 
every minute," Taylor says. 
</P>
<P>
But this is not the macho order of principal Joe Clark of Newark, N.J., with 
his trademark bullhorn. Taylor shows that mothering qualities are no less 
important. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, she is a "a tough, good lady," as one admirer put it. Taylor walks 
the halls between classes, admonishing young men who tower over her to remove 
their baseball hats and show some respect. The curriculum is demanding, and she 
drives her teachers hard. She is legendary for standing firm against the city 
and union bureaucracies. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't touch me because I'm steel," she says, without exaggeration. "Some 
people translate that into another five-letter word." 
</P>
<P>
But Taylor also attends to her students' smallest daily needs. Some live in 
disordered households and have trouble getting up in the morning. So Taylor 
raised money to provide computerized wake-up calls. (Music followed by "Hi. 
This is Mrs. Taylor. I'm here to remind you that you have a date at 8 so don't 
be late.") 
</P>
<P>
When the Board of Education ordered the schools to devote a day to workshops on 
drugs, AIDS and the like, Taylor asked, "One day?" She raised the money -- 
again, outside school channels -- to install a full-time medical clinic. 
</P>
<P>
She arranged the school year so that students who do poorly in the first 
semester can redeem themselves in the second. She has started an academic 
summer camp. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to save these kids because they are mine," she says. "You come to 
Randolph, and you are mine." 
</P>
<P>
Teachers get the same kind of attention: special programs, extra cash, pats on 
the back. The approach here does not fit neatly into conservative or liberal 
agendas; it's based simply on aspiration and respect. At the outset of each 
class, teachers, students and parents all sign a contract laying out what they 
expect from the course and what they will do in return. 
</P>
<P>
"Children have rights too," she says. "That's a hard thing for a lot of 
teachers to accept." But with rights come responsibilities. Before they 
graduate, students devote 80 hours to community service -- to give back a 
little of what the school gives them. 
</P>
<P>
"From the very first day you step into this school, everyone here wants to 
accomplish something, wants to go someplace higher," says Vaughn Malone, the 
student body president. Malone wants to become a lawyer because, as he explains 
it, "a lot of my brothers are in jail." 
</P>
<P>
There are city educators who think Taylor has gotten more than her share of 
glory. Yes, she's a good principal, they say. But look at what she has to work 
with: a school without entrenched faculty politics and with a link to City 
College that is a magnet for grants. Randolph was planned to have a complete 
cross-section of students, but Taylor has tilted the mix toward the best and 
brightest. There are grumblings about skimming the cream and leaving local 
"zoned" schools to deal with the rest. 
</P>
<P>
"They do a good job, but they are not a typical school," says one school 
official who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Randolph isn't typical. Last year, 3,000 students applied for 115 
places in the school's special pre-med program, funded by the Macy Foundation. 
The intellectual, Spike Lee look is common in the corridors. 
</P>
<P>
But Randolph also accepts underachievers and special-education students and 
lifts their sights as well. "That's the success of it," says Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor has fierce protective instincts. The whole "skimming" issue sets her 
off. 
</P>
<P>
When she was a youngster in Harlem, she recalls, her parents had to lie about 
their address to send her to a first-rate high school. What's so wrong with 
providing that kind of school for bright Harlem kids today? Randolph has a 
higher percentage of blacks than any other high school in Manhattan, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"When I march (at graduation) I march with a whole class of minorities," Taylor 
says, with not a little indignation. "What happened to these kids before A. 
Phillip Randolph existed?" 
</P>
<P>
The key, she says, is giving principals the authority to do their jobs. "Change 
will come at the school level with principals who say, 'The heck with this 
bureaucracy.' "

ARTS SUPPORT: DESIGNED NEITHER TO RAISE, DISTRIBUTE NOR DONATE FUNDS, THE

<P>
It's that time of year again. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, many of the area's top business leaders will once again don 
three-piece suits and cocktail attire to attend the Orange County Business 
Committee for the Arts' annual awards ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony recognizing "outstanding" arts support by local businesses 
routinely makes society, arts and business news. It is practically synonymous 
with the committee itself. It will be followed, as is tradition, by an 
elaborate supper at the Ritz restaurant in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Ask almost anyone who knows about the 9-year-old nonprofit organization for a 
definition, and the person will usually talk of the awards fete, at which 
corporations are recognized for volunteering hours and hours of technical aid 
or donating large amounts of money. 
</P>
<P>
The annual ceremony and dinner, underwritten by several corporations, is also a 
fund-raiser. Last year, it contributed about $38,000 to the committee's 
$131,816 expense budget, said committee executive director Betty R. Moss, who 
is expecting 320 for Sunday's ceremony and $175-per-plate repast of crab, 
shrimp and lobster salad, roast duck and white-chocolate ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
But besides the high-profile affair, just what does the Orange County Business 
Committee for the Arts do? 
</P>
<P>
A satisfactory answer appears to elude many members of the local arts 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really certain of the intent of the business committee," John H. 
Rhynerson, chairman of the Master Chorale of Orange County, said recently. 
</P>
<P>
While the chorale won an Arts Award at the committee's 1985 ceremony, he said, 
"I haven't been in contact (with the committee) in the last couple of years, 
other than getting invited to their banquets." 
</P>
<P>
Moss, the committee's founding executive director, certainly can explain its 
guiding mission: "Our whole purpose is to encourage businesses to support the 
arts" with service or cash contributions, she said recently. 
</P>
<P>
Designed neither to raise, distribute nor donate funds, the committee acts more 
as a clearinghouse. "The heart of what we do, more than anything else is, is to 
form partnerships between arts organizations and our members," Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
One of 12 branches of the national Business Committee for the Arts Inc., the 
committee forms these partnerships by matching up its members -- 120 
corporations whose annual dues range from $250 to $5,000, depending on their 
size -- with nonprofit arts groups seeking funds, board members, pro bono 
accounting or legal expertise and a range of other needs. 
</P>
<P>
"Arts organizations are in touch with me all the time," Moss said. "They will 
call and say, 'We need someone on our board,' or 'We just had some city funds 
taken away, can you help?' Then I call (committee) members and see if they can 
indeed help." 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, sometimes corporate members who want to become involved with a 
specific art form call up asking for a referral. Moss, whose staff consists of 
herself and a secretary, keeps a file of most of 200 county arts groups for 
this and other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The committee recently had a hand in helping the St. Joseph Ballet Company, 
which provides dance instruction for disadvantaged, inner-city youths, move 
from an overcrowded church basement into bigger, better quarters in Santa Ana's 
Fiesta Marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
Moss arranged breakfast for herself, her friend, Daniel Guggenheim, and the St. 
Joseph founder and artistic director, Beth Burns. The result: a $55,000 grant 
from the New York-based Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation used to 
complete St. Joseph's shiny new facility. 
</P>
<P>
"It was Betty's intimate knowledge of our mission and our program over the 
years that I think first interested (Daniel Guggenheim) in finding out more 
about our program and seeing what a wonderful match it is with the Guggenheim 
Foundation," Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
When Gov. George Deukmejian went looking for a county resident to name to the 
California Arts Council, it was the committee that initially suggested Harvey 
Stearn, one of its members, Moss said, and encouraged 5th District Orange 
County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley and other local leaders to write letters 
recommending him. 
</P>
<P>
Moss sent Stearn's name to Sacramento, said an assistant to Stearn, who was 
then president of Mission Viejo Co.'s California division. He won the 
appointment in 1984 and was subsequently council chairman. 
</P>
<P>
"Many times (financial) contributions are made, and we are behind the scenes in 
that," Moss added. "The arts organization may not even know we are there." 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1981 by Fluor Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer David S. 
Tappan Jr., Moss and other leading area businessmen, the committee has also 
helped place business executives on the boards of several arts groups. It is 
working to add James Martin, vice president of Security Pacific National Bank, 
to the board of directors of Stop-Gap theater troupe in Santa Ana, for 
instance, Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
"Betty has come out to see what Stop-Gap is doing, she's attended our events so 
she could become an advocate for our programs," said Don Laffoon, Stop-Gap's 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the increasing importance of minority representation on arts boards -- 
the California Arts Council greatly reduced a grant to South Coast Repertory in 
part because it has too few minority board members -- Moss said the committee 
does nothing to help arts groups increase the number of minorities on their 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
Board makeup should be decided by each organization and is not something the 
committee should "in any way influence," Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
Not every local group has been helped by the business committee. 
</P>
<P>
"They have contacted us on a couple of occasions, but nothing ever really 
worked out," said Judith Peterson, director of Fullerton's Muckenthaler 
Cultural Center. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also ceased sponsoring seminars that, for example, brought 
together arts and business professionals. That is something better left to an 
arts service agency, such as a countywide council being developed, Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, however, has contributed significantly to vigorous local 
corporate support of the arts -- exemplified by the $73-million Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, funded entirely by private sources, individuals and 
corporations -- said Judith A. Jedlicka, president of the committee's New 
York-based national headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Developer C. J. Segerstrom &amp; Sons -- whose managing partner, Henry T. 
Segerstrom, is a committee member and past chairman -- has been honored several 
times at its annual awards ceremony for, among other things, millions of 
dollars in cash and five acres of land that he and his family have given to the 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
In the last seven years, the committee has recognized firms small and large for 
arts support, among them the Fluor Corp., the Irvine Co. and the Mission Viejo 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
An Arts Award, acknowledging arts organizations' "achievement in developing 
partnerships with businesses," is also given each year. The award has 
"sporadically" been accompanied by a grant of $500 to $1,500 -- whenever a 
member corporation can be found to donate the cash, Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
Some believe that the award -- even without money attached -- is an important 
gesture. 
</P>
<P>
"The recognition factor for us was much greater than the cash award," said 
Catherine M. Michaels, director of the Children's Museum at La Habra, which won 
$1,500 in 1988. "That alone helps us get into corporations to apply for other 
grants." 
</P>
<P>
Moss, however, said the chief focus of the evening's celebration is on 
businesses, not arts groups, and that some business committee branches give no 
such awards at all. (This contributed to the local committee's decision to give 
one award annually, instead of two after its first two years.) 
</P>
<P>
"I am always happy to get whatever a business would like to give" for an Arts 
Award grant, Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
She added that the local affiliate's 36-member board has discussed eliminating 
the award altogether, a suggestion she opposes. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope we would keep the Arts Award in there, even though (the event) is 
not an arts-award program. It is primarily to honor businesses. These fellows 
need to be recognized." 
</P>
<P>
"When we started the business committee eight years ago, (corporate) giving in 
the community was not at the level it is today," added Moss, 58, who was host 
for a nighttime TV talk show in Chicago before moving to the county in 1957. 
She volunteered with various organizations until she began to work for the 
committee in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great job," she said. "It's a wonderful opportunity to make a 
difference in a community that, compared to cities like San Francisco or 
Boston, is in its infancy stage in the arts, a community that is laying the 
foundation for future generations."

It's not unusual to find Faraday's Grill and Spirits jammed with people -- even 
midweek. 
</P>
<P>
On a Tuesday, around 7:30 p.m., I waited 20 minutes for a table, and the next 
day at about the same time I waited nearly 25. I'm still trying to figure out 
what all the waiting was about; my response to the food was mixed. 
</P>
<P>
The decor is all awkward splatterings and splashes of clashing colors. Potted 
plants, balloon clusters, funky lamps and prefab wooden trim decorate the large 
main dining area. You sit at clunky booths with vinyl and polyester upholstery, 
and eat off stone table tops of an almost mystically green hue. Banana leaf 
fans swirl languidly overhead. 
</P>
<P>
I have to hand it to the food servers, though, mostly perky 
working-their-way-through-college types who smile through your sourest moods 
(brought on by the annoyingly slow kitchen). They are a cheerful crew, 
recommending every dish with a big smile, and their enthusiasm appears to be 
genuine. The customers don't seem to complain either, as long as their burgers 
come out medium rare and their baked potatoes are the size of an NFL 
linebacker's shoulder pad. 
</P>
<P>
Looking around, I see that a lot of people here start with onion strings, a 
golden mountain of flour-dredged, deep-fried onions that remind me a lot of the 
canned variety my school cafeteria put in our green bean casserole. 
</P>
<P>
If you are a chili fancier, the cooks here make their own, a bland, uninspiring 
version topped with two kinds of cheese and diced onion. 
</P>
<P>
Oriental chicken salad is another possibility -- a giant bowl of julienne 
chicken with red and green bell peppers, water chestnuts, snow peas and 
whatever else you can think of, piled high. It doesn't have much taste, but 
there is plenty of texture. 
</P>
<P>
Things pick up considerably when the menu gets down to basics. Like most of the 
sandwiches here (club, tuna, French dip), the burger is excellent . . . and 
enormous. More than half a pound of charbroiled beef is served on a good, chewy 
bun and topped with red onion, good Cheddar and some surprisingly juicy sliced 
tomato. It rivals the best I've had in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Prime rib, served only on weekends, is fine, too. I had an end slab, nicely 
marbled. The baked potato was so good I thought it must have been a fluke. It 
tasted as if it had been cooked over hot coals, smoky on the outside with 
crispy skin, soft and steamy inside. But why did they have to mess it up with 
that horrid whipped butter? 
</P>
<P>
Barbecue is pushed a lot at this place, mostly chicken and ribs in a sauce 
that's maddeningly sweet without being hot or even spicy. The meats aren't bad 
at all, so it seems even more of a shame. They smoke their own baby backs, and 
the chicken is plump and tender. Another sugar-sweet alternative is the 
home-style roast chicken, a half chicken basted in a candy-like marinade. 
</P>
<P>
I can tolerate a little sweetness in the morning, so I came to Faraday's early 
Sunday for breakfast (and I got a table without having to wait). I would rate 
breakfast as the best meal here. Orange juice is squeezed. They make their own 
muffins -- bran, zucchini and blueberry -- in little Bundt-like molds, and they 
are delightfully springy and flavorful. 
</P>
<P>
Pancakes are firm and fluffy, not at all gluey as they often are in restaurants 
that cater to families, and waffles are light and crisp. Then there are things 
like eggs Benedict (the kitchen is way out of its depth here), huevos 
rancheros, stuffed French toast, and lots of omelets with green chilies, 
spinach and assorted minced goodies, served with nicely seasoned, slightly 
over-salted potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
But what I like best was a side dish: hot oat bran and raisins, the perfect 
antidote to all that salt and sugar. 
</P>
<P>
Faraday's is inexpensive to moderate. Most breakfasts are under $5. On the main 
menu, starters are $3.45 to $6.95. Burgers and sandwiches are $4.45 to $6.95. 
Specialties are $6.95 to $12.95. For a fax menu, call (714) 730-3461.

JOKERS DISCO PUSHES SUIT TO PROHIBIT COMEDY CLUB'S USE OF SAME NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jokers, a disco in Costa Mesa, has gone to court to prohibit a comedy club at 
the Hyatt Regency Alicante Hotel in Garden Grove from using the same name. The 
comedy club disputes the disco's right to exclusive use of the Jokers name but 
has dropped it to avoid litigation, according to an attorney representing the 
hotel management. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the disco, Thomas Elsea, said earlier this week that he is 
continuing to press the case in Orange County Superior Court. Elsea is seeking 
an unspecified amount of money on grounds that his business has been harmed by 
confusion arising from the comedy club's use of the name. 
</P>
<P>
Elsea said the disco, formerly called Kiss, changed its name to Jokers in early 
July. The comedy club took the name in August, said David Gladstone of Off 
&amp; Running Entertainment, which books the club for the hotel and has 
presented the weekend-only shows for the past 10 weeks. Gladstone said the 
comedy club would be renamed in January. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the hotel's attorney, who asked not to be identified, said: "We've 
denied there have been any damages or that they have the exclusive right to use 
the (Jokers) name." The only reason for dropping the name, he added, is that 
"it's cheaper and easier to switch than fight. Our goal is not to litigate the 
issue but to resolve it."

SCHOOL OF HOPE; 
</P>
<P>
AT ESPERANZA, MENTALLY HANDICAPPED STUDENTS BUILD PRODUCTIVE LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAWN STONE, Dawn Stone is a senior at El Toro High School, where she is 
editor of the student news magazine, The BullETin, Keywanette treasurer and a 
member of the Orange County Academic Decathlon team. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Peterson Santos or Darin French walked the halls of a typical high school, 
many students would feel uncomfortable and possibly avert their eyes. Some of 
the friendlier ones might offer them a smile, and, if no one were looking, 
perhaps even say hello. 
</P>
<P>
Santos, 18, and French, 20, are special students who attend a special school -- 
Esperanza School. 
</P>
<P>
Established in 1973, Esperanza -- Spanish for hope -- educates 117 trainable 
mentally handicapped students -- from preschoolers to adults. The school, up 
the hill from Mission Viejo High, is part of the Saddleback Valley Unified 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Within Esperanza's curriculum is the high school program, in which 48 students 
from ages 15 to 21 learn academics and job skills. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza's principal, Ruby Edman, said her school's students would have 
difficulty at other high schools because of problems with concentration, 
language skills and articulation. Many of them speak in only three- or 
four-word phrases. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a more intensive educational program for them," Edman said. "More 
specialists, a smaller class size and we offer more support." 
</P>
<P>
At a regular high school, Edman said, "they get confused because there are so 
many people and there's so much going on. 
</P>
<P>
"Socially, they do things that are unacceptable, that make them stand out. They 
are less isolated in a school like this. It's their school, and they can go 
anywhere they want to here." 
</P>
<P>
Edman said the greatest challenge for mentally handicapped students who attend 
regular high schools is making friends. Anyone who has tried not to notice the 
special education students sitting by themselves at lunch would agree. 
</P>
<P>
Some teen-agers are friendly toward the mentally handicapped, but 
acknowledgment is usually as far as it goes. "Sometimes the hardest thing to 
get (mentally handicapped) people to understand is that somebody being nice to 
you is not the same thing as being your friend," Edman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, they have wonderful friends. They go to the movies on weekends, they 
talk on the phone, they go to the dances. They have boyfriends and girlfriends 
and love triangles -- absolutely the same thing here as at other schools, but 
at their level." 
</P>
<P>
To enhance its students' social lives, Esperanza holds four dances a year, 
including a Christmas dance sponsored by the Elks Club. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, Esperanza is similar to any high school. Students attend classes, 
study and hold down jobs. The school day runs from 8:30 a.m. to 2:20 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza students start each day in homerooms, where they meet in groups of 
10, based on their abilities and age. Groups go from room to room, changing 
teachers for each 40-minute lesson. Subjects include reading, handwriting, 
social studies, science, math, physical education, arts and crafts, and music, 
as well as a broad range of vocational skills. Each classroom is staffed by a 
full-time teacher and aide. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really preparing them for jobs," said Pat Haberfield, instructor in 
charge of Esperanza's high school program. "We try to have a balance between 
the academic and the vocational." 
</P>
<P>
The school's vocational program serves as a training ground for a productive 
adulthood. As part of the restaurant program, for example, the school has a 
commercial kitchen where students prepare lunch three times a week. 
Lunch-making is divided into three crews: food preparation, serving and 
cleanup. A rotating schedule allows students a chance at each job. 
</P>
<P>
While some teen-agers find fast-food restaurant work mundane, Esperanza's 
students view such jobs as the crowning achievement of their culinary skills. 
They strive to land fast-food jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll come back in their uniform with their Coke and fries and eat in the 
hall where everyone can see," Haberfield said. "They're very proud of it." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Stuetz, 18, said his goal is to get a job at Wienerschnitzel. Another 
Esperanza student, Paul Harrington, 20, echoed the feeling: "I'm going to get a 
job this year. I'd like to work at Sizzler." 
</P>
<P>
Said Haberfield: "It (a job) provides wonderful motivation. It provides a goal 
our students can work for." 
</P>
<P>
As another part of the food preparation program, students learn to use a 
special machine to package cookies baked the night before by Esperanza's adult 
school students. The cookies are sold during snack and lunch at nearby Mission 
Viejo and Silverado high schools. 
</P>
<P>
Other job training helps to develop assembly-type skills. The school asks local 
businesses to supply easy, repetitive tasks that students can perform for 
experience, not pay. One travel agency sent Esperanza stickers and brochures, 
and students spent a class period learning to affix address labels. 
</P>
<P>
Twice weekly, students spend time working in the school's vegetable and flower 
gardens, and taking care of the chickens. They collect the eggs and sell them 
to faculty members. Students learn responsibility by caring for the plants and 
chickens, and math skills by making change for the eggs they sell. 
</P>
<P>
The average reading level for Esperanza's students is about the second or third 
grade, though some cannot read at all. The emphasis in teaching reading is on 
functional, everyday material -- menus, instructions and signs. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the students have a firmer grip on the written word. Harrington, one of 
Esperanza's more advanced students, recently wrote a letter to the mayor of 
Laguna Beach in praise of recycling efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"The pace is slow," Haberfield admitted. "Sometimes you may go for years 
thinking, 'Will this student ever learn this?' But it is so gratifying when you 
see them succeed." 
</P>
<P>
Haberfield has spent 15 years educating the mentally handicapped. For many 
reasons, she said she prefers working with these teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great to work with students who think you are wonderful," she said. "It's 
nice to be appreciated, to know they love you and respect you. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see a student out there working, it's very gratifying to know that 
they are happy and productive. We want them to be producing something in 
society, and 10 years ago, people didn't think that was possible."

DEBUNKING MYTHS OF URBAN LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Mike Spencer's article, "Readers Angry but Still Unable to Find Case 
of Halloween Horror" (Nov. 9), you might be interested in a book by Hal Morgan: 
"Rumor." In it he debunks a number of "urban myths," including: 
</P>
<P>
* Woman finds rat in Kentucky Fried Chicken. 
</P>
<P>
* You can get high by smoking banana peels. 
</P>
<P>
* Walt Disney wanted his remains put in cryonic freeze, but his family ignored 
the request and had him cremated instead (only the cremation part is true). 
</P>
<P>
* The oil companies are suppressing the development of a "pill" (or carburetor) 
that would allow cars to travel 100 miles on a gallon of gas. 
</P>
<P>
* The tobacco companies own marijuana fields in Mexico and have a design for 
marijuana cigarette packs all set to put on the market the moment pot is 
legalized. 
</P>
<P>
* Woman bathes poodle, then puts it in microwave oven to dry it, thereby 
killing it. 
</P>
<P>
These are only a few of the zingers that "everybody knows about." Some of those 
not mentioned in the book: One's hair can turn white (or gray) overnight from 
fright. Hair, beard and fingernails continue to grow after death. A dull razor 
blade placed under a cardboard pyramid aligned to true north will sharpen 
itself. Urban violence increases when the moon is full (the implication being 
that the moon has some kind of influence on the human brain). 
</P>
<P>
Human nature being what it is, I expect "modern mythology and lore" will 
continue as long as there are imaginative people to spin the yarns and gullible 
people to believe them.

S. AFRICA OPENS BEACHES, TARGETS APARTHEID LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Frederik W. de Klerk, taking his first important step toward 
dismantling apartheid, declared South Africa's remaining whites-only beaches 
open to blacks Thursday and promised to scrap a 36-year-old law that enables 
local officials to segregate such public facilities as parks, meeting halls and 
libraries. 
</P>
<P>
"The government is not playing games. There is no alternative for South Africa 
but the road of reconciliation and of creating opportunities for all people of 
this country in a way which is just, fair and equitable," De Klerk told a 
presidential advisory group in Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
For whites "to cling to power means accepting the risk -- more than a risk, 
facing a revolution," De Klerk said. "Nowhere in the world has a minority clung 
to power without that result." 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk's announcement that "all beaches will henceforth be accessible to all 
members of the public" will affect only about a dozen beaches that remain 
segregated. Most beaches on South Africa's 2,700-mile-long coast have been 
integrated for several years. 
</P>
<P>
However, the decision to repeal the Separate Amenities Act "as soon as 
possible" after the new session of Parliament convenes in February is a sharp 
rebuke to the country's right-wing whites. It marks one of the more significant 
policy changes in the ruling National Party's 41-year history. Until Thursday, 
the government had supported separate public facilities for those who wanted 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The law, known formally as the 1953 Reservation of Separate Amenities Act, has 
allowed local town councilors, at their discretion, to segregate buses, 
toilets, swimming pools, beaches and any other land, building or vehicle to 
which the public has access. 
</P>
<P>
The law was imposed in response to the 1952 Defiance Campaign, led by Nelson R. 
Mandela and other black nationalists. It specifically decrees that the separate 
facilities do not have to be equal. 
</P>
<P>
Although most public amenities have been opened to all races in major South 
African cities in recent years, whites-only facilities still exist in the 
capital, Pretoria, and many rural communities. Several industrial cities near 
Johannesburg used the act to reimpose segregation after the far-right 
Conservative Party took power in municipal elections last year. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative spokesman Koos van der Merwe said De Klerk's announcement is "yet 
another broken National Party promise," and he predicted "the beginning of the 
end of a separate white community life." 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. De Klerk is placing South Africa on the road to a totally racially mixed 
South Africa, which will inevitably be governed by a black majority," Van der 
Merwe said. 
</P>
<P>
But Zach de Beer, co-leader of the liberal white Democratic Party, said he is 
"very pleased" with De Klerk's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We've said for a long time that whenever Mr. De Klerk does anything to create 
a more open and more equal society, he will have our support," De Beer said. He 
added that the segregated public facilities "were already on their way out, and 
it's a pity that the government so often recognizes reality in this tardy 
manner instead of taking the lead in reform." 
</P>
<P>
The Mass Democratic Movement, the anti-apartheid coalition that has led a 
nationwide defiance campaign against discriminatory laws since August, welcomed 
the decision but said the law should never have been passed in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"This is only a reflection of the strength of mass action when it comes to 
putting pressure on the government," said Murphy Morobe, a Mass Democratic 
Movement leader. 
</P>
<P>
The repeal of the Separate Amenities Act would still leave several important 
pillars of apartheid. Under South African law, residential neighborhoods, 
public hospitals and public education remain segregated. Population 
Registration still officially classifies each person in South Africa by race. 
The political system, which denies the 26 million blacks a vote in national 
affairs, remains dominated by the nation's 5 million whites. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk has said he wants to maintain racially separate housing, hospitals and 
schools for those who want them. But since he took office in August, the 
president has launched a broad program of reform to create a climate for 
black-white negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The government has plans to designate certain neighborhoods as multiracial, and 
De Klerk says his goal is a new constitution that would extend voting rights to 
blacks while protecting white interests. 
</P>
<P>
However, anti-apartheid leaders have refused to negotiate until the government 
ends a 3 1/2-year-old state of emergency, lifts restrictions on black political 
organizations and releases political prisoners, including Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk made his remarks at a meeting of the President's Council, whose 
members murmured in surprise when the president revealed his plans. Five years 
ago, the council recommended that the Separate Amenities Act be repealed. 
</P>
<P>
Although De Klerk promised quick action on the act, he said the government will 
first carefully consider "the implications of such a step." And he said 
"fitting measures" will be taken to make sure this does not lead to 
overcrowding or an increase in crime. He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
However, De Klerk said racial separation at beaches is an area in which a 
decision can be taken immediately, as the Southern Hemisphere's summer vacation 
season begins. He asked local officials to "act in the spirit of this decision" 
and open their segregated beaches. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen beaches in small resort towns along the Cape province coast 
remain reserved for whites. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Norman Kempster, in Washington, contributed to this story.

ETHICS PANEL TO CONDUCT CRANSTON INVESTIGATION; 
</P>
<P>
LINCOLN S&amp;L: OUTSIDE COUNSEL TO BE APPOINTED OVER ALLEGATIONS INVOLVING 
INFLUENCE PEDDLING BY SENATORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Senate Ethics Committee will appoint an outside counsel to investigate 
allegations of influence peddling against Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and 
four other senators who intervened with federal regulators on behalf of Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan after receiving campaign donations from the owner of the 
Irvine thrift, sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The panel is believed to have settled on Robert S. Bennett, a Washington 
attorney who specializes in white-collar crime, to head the investigation of 
charges filed against the five senators by Common Cause, the citizens' lobby. 
</P>
<P>
The other four senators are Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), John McCain (R-Ariz.), 
John Glenn (D-Ohio) and Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.). 
</P>
<P>
Bennett, 50, is expected to meet with the committee members today to make final 
plans for the inquiry. He has served as special counsel in two previous 
investigations of senators -- the 1981 probe of then-Sen. Harrison H. Williams 
(D-N.J.) and a pending inquiry into the book-publishing activities of Sen. Dave 
Durenberger (D-Minn.). He is the older brother of William J. Bennett, director 
of the White House Office of Drug Control Policy. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., Bennett received a law degree from Georgetown 
University and a master's degree in law from Harvard. He represented Boeing Co. 
earlier this week when it pleaded guilty to two felony charges of trafficking 
in secret Pentagon planning documents. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Ethics Committee's decision to conduct a full-blown investigation 
headed by an outside counsel is a major setback for Cranston, who had hoped 
that the charges against him would simply be dismissed on the basis of the 
legal defense that he had filed with the committee Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston, who is assistant majority leader of the Senate and has served in the 
chamber 21 years, is accused of intervening improperly in 1987 along with the 
four other senators in an investigation by federal regulators of Lincoln. The 
Irvine thrift is owned by Charles H. Keating Jr., who had contributed about 
$1.3 million to campaigns and other causes supported by the senators. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Cranston's aides acknowledged for the first time that the 
senator's top adviser on banking matters, Carolyn D. Jordan, took a trip paid 
for partly by Lincoln a week after the senator first intervened for the thrift. 
Jordan also lobbied California Savings and Loan Commissioner William J. 
Crawford on behalf of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
But in a letter and a 16-page legal brief filed with the Ethics Committee, 
Cranston insisted that he did nothing illegal or improper when he, along with 
the four other senators, contacted federal regulators on behalf of Keating. 
</P>
<P>
He also denied that his actions were in any way responsible for an estimated $2 
billion in losses to the federal government caused by the collapse of Lincoln 
or for the personal financial losses suffered by 24,000 people -- many of them 
elderly Californians -- who invested in uninsured junk bonds sold at Lincoln 
branch offices. The bonds are now worthless. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not responsible for loss of taxpayer funds through a delay in shutting 
down Lincoln or the losses of innocent California bond investors," Cranston 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that his efforts on Lincoln's behalf never exceeded what a member of 
Congress can legally do for a constituent who is at odds with the government. 
Nor, he said, did Keating have any reason to believe that the senator was 
paying off a debt to him for his campaign donations. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston noted that he never benefitted personally from Keating's largess, 
which would have violated the law. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cranston was responding officially to charges of influence peddling 
pending before the Senate committee, the 16-page document written by his 
attorney, William W. Taylor III, focused heavily on allegations that have 
arisen in recent House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee hearings 
into the Lincoln affair. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he devoted 3 1/2 pages of his legal brief to disputing a charge by 
Edwin J. Gray, former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, that 
Cranston's efforts on behalf of Keating were "worse than anything Jim Wright 
did." Former Speaker Wright was forced to resign from Congress earlier this 
year after a year-long investigation in which he was found to have violated 
House ethics rules. 
</P>
<P>
One of the charges against Wright was that he intervened improperly with the 
bank board, which supervised savings and loans, on behalf of the owners of 
several Texas thrifts. Wright eventually was cleared of any ethics violations 
involving the thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Gray said that Wright's alleged intervention was comparable to Gray's 
meeting in April, 1987, with Cranston and three others senators who were 
seeking better treatment by the regulators for Keating. 
</P>
<P>
"Sen. Cranston's alleged 'intervention' with Chairman Gray is not even remotely 
comparable to that for which the committee exonerated the Speaker," Taylor 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that Wright had been accused of seeking "specific regulatory results" 
from the bank board, of trying to get rid of a regulator on grounds he was 
homosexual, of trying to arrange special deals for constituents and of trying 
to delay the seizure of an insolvent savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
Although the charges against Wright were much more serious than those against 
Cranston, he added, they were dismissed by the House Ethics Committee on 
grounds that a member of Congress has a right to intervene in such matters. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Cranston's attorney cited the decision in the Wright case as proof that 
his client did nothing illegal or improper by asking the bank board to expedite 
the investigation of Lincoln, which claimed that it was being harassed by the 
regulators. He said that Cranston would still be innocent even if he had 
specifically asked the bank board to go easy on Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
He cited a Supreme Court decision saying that it is within the rightful duties 
of a senator to "cajole and exhort" the executive branch regarding the 
enforcement of laws. 
</P>
<P>
To underscore this point, Cranston listed three occasions on which he had 
intervened with federal agencies on matters involving immigration, the Legal 
Services Corp. and the semiconductor industry. In only one of the three cases 
did he receive campaign contributions from the interested parties, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that a constituent who requests a senator's help is subsequently 
accused or indeed convicted of violations of the law does not suggest that a 
senator acted improperly," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's legal brief also disputed the testimony of three elderly California 
women before the House Banking Committee earlier this week. The three had said 
that they held Cranston personally responsible for the loss of their life 
savings as a result of investments in bonds issued by Lincoln's parent company, 
American Continental Corp. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that even Gray, whom he called a "discredited former bureaucrat," 
acknowledged in testimony before the House committee that the actions of the 
five senators did nothing to deter him from investigating Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cranston received $35,000 in campaign contributions raised by Keating 
and solicited an additional $850,000 from him for voter registration 
organizations, there is no evidence that he pocketed any money. 
</P>
<P>
"When it is all said and done," Taylor's brief concluded, "the critical and 
undisputed fact is that Sen. Cranston received no personal gain from Charles 
Keating or any organization he owned or controlled."

W. EUROPE SURPASSING U.S. IN AIDING EAST BLOC REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-eight years ago, when East Germany built the Berlin Wall, President John 
F. Kennedy rallied the West with his defiant response: "Ich bin ein Berliner." 
Now, as the wall comes tumbling down, Western leaders are proclaiming victory 
and stepping up aid to Soviet Bloc reformers. 
</P>
<P>
But this time, the rallying cry is not coming from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of President Bush, the West's most visible spokesmen on shaping the New 
Europe are Europeans: West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President 
Francois Mitterrand. In particular, diplomats say, it is Kohl and his foreign 
minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who are spearheading the West's efforts to 
aid reform in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The change reflects more than a difference between two U.S. presidents. It 
reflects, to a significant degree, a fundamental change in America's place in 
the scheme of things. 
</P>
<P>
For 40 years, the United States has been the most important power in Europe and 
the dominant partner in the Western alliance. But now that the two halves of 
divided Europe are growing closer together, Washington appears increasingly on 
the margin. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going through a difficult transition," said Helmut Sonnenfeldt, a 
former senior State Department official. "This isn't 1949, when the United 
States was clearly the leading power. In 1949, Europe was down and out. In 
1989, that vacuum isn't there any more; it's been filled by the Western 
Europeans themselves." 
</P>
<P>
That change may make some Americans uncomfortable, Sonnenfeldt and others say, 
but in the long run it is inevitable -- and, they added, a good thing. "We 
should welcome a bigger role by the Western Europeans," Sonnenfeldt said. 
"Leadership, in some ways, means getting them to take more responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, it was Mitterrand, not Bush, who called an emergency meeting 
of the Western allies to consider additional responses to the changes in East 
Germany. The United States is not even attending that meeting. Instead of the 
U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization, it is the 12-member European 
Community that is taking the lead. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Democrats have sharply criticized what they see as Bush's 
reluctance to act as leader of the non-Communist world. Privately, some 
Republicans are also concerned about the way Bush has reacted to events in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a historic opportunity in Eastern Europe, but the Administration 
hasn't been leading, it's been following," said Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), 
a former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. "They ought to grasp the 
nettle of leadership, both rhetorically and with resources." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), the Senate majority leader, called on Bush to 
convene a meeting of the NATO allies, to visit West Berlin and to move more 
quickly to suspend restrictions on trade with the Soviet Union. The White House 
said Bush plans no trip to Berlin and that he will act on trade only after 
Moscow meets U.S. demands on easing emigration. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the President has been content to welcome the changes sweeping Eastern 
Europe in a series of mostly low-key statements. "We are handling it in a way 
where we are not trying to give anybody a hard time," Bush explained last week. 
</P>
<P>
Bush aides defend their posture, saying that any greater U.S. role might 
actually get in the way of more changes in Eastern Europe. "One of the reasons 
the Soviet Union has let these changes take place . . . is that we aren't 
trumpeting our victory," a senior foreign-policy official said. 
</P>
<P>
To some foreign-policy specialists, the less dominant U.S. role springs not 
from tactics but from necessity. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a kind of knee-jerk American reaction that we ought to be in charge," 
said David P. Calleo of Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced 
International Studies. "Part of it is the discomfort of giving up our dominant 
role. Part of it is just partisan." 
</P>
<P>
"But we can't afford to take the lead in economic aid," he said. "We don't have 
any money. If we give more money to Poland, we'll be borrowing it from the 
Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
The United States is not irrelevant to the future of Europe, by any means. The 
Bush Administration is working on a package of aid for Poland and Hungary that 
Congress has enlarged from the original $125 million to more than $900 million. 
And, of course, the United States is still a major military presence as the 
biggest member of NATO, with more than 325,000 troops on the Continent. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, European leaders still see the United States as such a towering 
presence that Bush and other U.S. officials have had to put considerable energy 
into convincing them that the President does not intend to cut a secret deal on 
Eastern Europe with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev when the two 
superpower leaders meet in the Mediterranean off Malta next month. 
</P>
<P>
"(We) are not meeting to negotiate the future of Europe," Bush said Wednesday. 
"The peoples of Eastern Europe are speaking their own minds about that future." 
</P>
<P>
West European diplomats in Washington said their governments generally are 
pleased with the Administration's position -- with one exception: They would 
like more consultation with Bush or Secretary of State James A. Baker III, both 
before and after the summit. 
</P>
<P>
"That is one place where the Administration has slipped," said Robert E. 
Hunter, a former foreign-policy aide to President Jimmy Carter. "The act of 
working more closely with the allies is, in some ways, the most important part 
of building a new kind of relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand's action in calling a European Community meeting to deal with 
Eastern Europe is both a landmark in the new political assertiveness of Western 
Europe and a test of how the Continent's new structure will work, diplomats 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an important development," a senior European envoy said. "For the 
first time, the European Community is making a specific effort to take the lead 
on a foreign policy issue." 
</P>
<P>
"The EC is very eager to take the lead in dealing with Eastern Europe," he 
added. "NATO is important for the security aspect, but to discuss the future of 
Europe -- that's a job for the 12 (EC members)." 
</P>
<P>
Officially, the Bush Administration welcomed the announcement of the European 
meeting, but some U.S. officials were irritated by the move. "It was mostly 
Mitterrand playing domestic politics," said one. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of people (within the Administration) who are still 
uncomfortable with the Europeans' new role," said another. "There are some who 
feel that if the EC gains political effectiveness, NATO loses. That isn't our 
policy, though; our policy is that a stronger EC is going to be a stronger 
voice on our side." 
</P>
<P>
A more independent political role for the European Community is inevitable for 
two reasons, officials and other analysts said. One is economic reality, and 
the other is the increasing success of Western European integration. 
</P>
<P>
When NATO was formed in 1949, the U.S. economy was roughly 40% larger than the 
combined economies of postwar European nations; now, the European Community's 
output is roughly equal to that of the United States (although exchange-rate 
fluctuations make exact comparisons difficult). 
</P>
<P>
More to the point, swelling trade imbalances and budget deficits have made it 
impossible for Washington to exercise leadership by spending money on foreign 
aid. In Poland, Hungary and East Germany, the leading economic role now belongs 
firmly to West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The main danger in Western Europe's new independence, as some officials see it, 
is that the United States and the European Community might become estranged. 
That danger will be especially acute if the community acts to restrict U.S. 
investment or exports as it approaches full economic integration in 1992, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
To meet that potential problem, U.S. and European officials are already 
discussing ways to strengthen political links, perhaps through a new "economic 
alliance" agreement. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they said, the allies must find a new role for NATO -- 
especially if the current East-West talks on reducing conventional armed forces 
in Europe result in a major withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Continent. 
</P>
<P>
"NATO is still there at the center of security issues," a State Department 
official said. "Our role in that area has not diminished. . . . But that 
relationship is changing, too." 
</P>
<P>
"There is clearly the potential for increased friction with our European 
allies" as the balance of power shifts, he said. "But it doesn't need to be 
that way unless we let it."

BORDER ARRESTS RISING RAPIDLY, INS OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 2 1/2 years of steady decline following passage of the sweeping 1986 
immigration reform package, arrests along the U.S.-Mexico border have begun to 
surge, signaling a possible renewed wave of illegal entries, according to 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Between May and September, U.S. border guards from San Diego to Brownsville, 
Tex., apprehended more than 435,000 suspected illegal immigrants, an increase 
of almost 25% over the same period of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The numbers are going up, and we're concerned," said Duke Austin, spokesman in 
Washington for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
But the warning of increased illegal crossings is based upon statistics -- 
arrests along the border -- that, while widely repeated, are also widely 
questioned. The apprehension numbers, critics argue, are on the rise because of 
a range of factors -- among them INS staffing and priorities, seasonal shifts 
in migration and changes in policy and law. Using arrest figures alone to claim 
that illegal immigrants are once again streaming into the United States, these 
critics say, can be misleading. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the figures' value has always been very problematic," said Wayne A. 
Cornelius, director of the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at UC San Diego and 
a leading researcher of immigration issues. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the border arrest statistics have long been trumpeted by INS officials as 
the single most effective indicator of illegal immigration. For decades, the 
numbers have played a key role in U.S. immigration strategy. In the 1950s, 
immigration authorities cited higher arrests to justify widespread sweeps of 
suspected illegal migrants. In the early 1980s, rising arrests led to calls for 
new controls, culminating in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
That law, analysts say, has further eroded the reliability of arrest statistics 
as an indicator of illegal immigration. Several provisions of the statute have 
clearly had an impact on the border arrest totals, which at first declined 
precipitously. 
</P>
<P>
A major reason is the newly legalized status for more than 3 million amnesty 
recipients -- almost 75% of them Mexican citizens and more than half residents 
of California. That has meant that far fewer people have to cross the border 
illegally; they can now go back and forth freely. Not surprisingly, the number 
of legal crossings has risen considerably since 1986, and contributed to the 
decline of illegal crossers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the law gave new responsibilities to U.S. immigration authorities, 
drawing some resources away from border enforcement, and leaving some agents in 
the undermanned San Diego border force openly skeptical of claims that the law 
was deterring illegal entry. 
</P>
<P>
"They (policy-makers) have to prove that the law they wanted is doing the job," 
said Steven Garcia, president of Local 1613 of the National Border Patrol 
Council, the officers' union. "If we had more agents, we'd definitely have more 
arrests." 
</P>
<P>
INS officials, especially former commissioner Alan C. Nelson, were quick to 
seize upon the post-1986 drop in arrests as evidence of the deterrent effect of 
new penalties against employers who hire illegal aliens. The so-called employer 
sanctions -- a centerpiece of the 1986 law -- were meant to dry up the illegal 
migrant job market. 
</P>
<P>
But skeptical researchers, aware of the lack of success of similar sanctions in 
various U.S. states (including California) and in Europe, question the link. 
Illegal aliens have easily managed to circumvent the new requirements through 
use of false documents and other means, according to several studies. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics, notably Jorge Bustamante, director of the College of the Northern 
Border, a Tijuana-based research institution, have argued that the INS has 
manipulated staffing in a deliberate effort to inflate or deflate the arrest 
numbers to achieve its policy goals. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a manipulation from the top," said Bustamante, who also writes a 
popular column for El Excelsior, the Mexico City daily. "The agency has been 
lying to the American people." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials deny any attempt to deceive. "I think they (the numbers) are the 
best barometer there is" of illegal immigration, said Austin, the INS 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
One weakness, as INS officials concede, is that the apprehension numbers are 
inflated. The statistics measure only arrests, so anyone arrested several 
times, as frequently happens along the border, is counted with each arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the volume of arrests along the border is staggering, particularly 
in the San Diego area, the single busiest crossing point along the border. On 
Nov. 5, U.S. Border Patrol agents based here recorded 1,219 arrests of 
migrants, or an average of about 50 per hour. More than 90% were Mexican 
nationals. Among the 102 non-Mexicans apprehended were 41 Guatemalans, 36 El 
Salvadorans, 11 Nicaraguans, four Hondurans, two Egyptians, two Colombians, two 
Chinese and one citizen each from Bolivia, Belize, India and the Dominican 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, authorities have used the arrest numbers as barometers of 
unauthorized immigration from Mexico. After World War II, apprehensions of 
illegal aliens began to double and triple annually, peaking at more than 1 
million arrests in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities took action, instituting the infamous "Operation Wetback," 
arresting thousands. Caught in the net were many legal U.S. residents -- and 
even U.S. citizens -- residing in Los Angeles and elsewhere. Some immigrants, 
even though in the country legally, fled back to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The ferocity of that operation has not been forgotten in Mexico, where the 1986 
immigration law revisions sparked fears of similar actions. 
</P>
<P>
In the years after "Operation Wetback," the border arrest numbers gradually 
declined, reaching a low of about 29,000 apprehensions in 1960. A sharp upward 
trend began in the 1980s, as the Mexican economy worsened, and reached its apex 
in 1986, when authorities recorded 1.6 million arrests of immigrants along the 
border, a record. Again, as in the mid-1950s, there were calls for drastic 
steps to stem the "invasion." The response this time was passage in October, 
1986, of the immigration reform package.

'KIDNAPING' OF 3 WESTERNERS IN BEIRUT PROVES TO BE A HOAX

After a kidnaping scare based on messages from the Lebanese underworld, an 
American and two West Germans turned up safe Thursday, telling diplomats they 
had been held by robbers but had not been taken as hostages. 
</P>
<P>
West German Ambassador to Lebanon Wolfgang Goettelmann reported that Mounir 
Sami, 39; his 7-year-old son Daniel, and their American companion, Deborah 
Fahrend, 54, were never abducted, as was reported by a hitherto-unknown group, 
Organization of Just Revenge. 
</P>
<P>
The three foreigners first heard of their alleged abduction when they read 
Thursday's newspapers, the ambassador said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were astonished when they read the story. They came to the embassy to see 
what was happening." 
</P>
<P>
According to Fahrend's family in the United States, the American woman, who 
lives in West Berlin but lists her home as San Geronimo in northern California, 
went to Lebanon last month to do research for a book. Mounir Sami is a 
Lebanese-born West German citizen. 
</P>
<P>
Sami's sister, Marwa, who learned further details from the West German Embassy 
in Christian East Beirut, said the three were seized by gunmen who held them 
for about 24 hours and took all their money. All three were then set free. 
</P>
<P>
The sister did not say whether the robbery occurred in Muslim West Beirut or 
the Christian East. 
</P>
<P>
Western news agencies in West Beirut ignored as suspected hoaxes telephone 
calls Tuesday reporting that the three were hostages. A later message, 
accompanied by copies of their passports, was received Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sami's mother said the three were expected to leave by boat from the 
Christian-held port of Juniyah, north of Beirut, and fly from Cyprus to West 
Germany.

U.S. LINKS SOVIET TRADE STATUS TO VISAS FOR JEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration said Thursday that it will move to extend 
most-favored-nation trade status to the Soviet Union only after Moscow enacts 
and puts into place its new plan to ease restrictions on emigration by Soviet 
Jews. 
</P>
<P>
The clarifications came in the wake of a statement Thursday by Commerce 
Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher that the move could come "within the next one to 
three months." Mosbacher offered the guess during a television interview, but 
aides later backed away from that estimate. 
</P>
<P>
They said that President Bush wants to wait until the Soviets not only have 
changed the legal requirements for emigration but also have issued enough exit 
visas to demonstrate that they are serious about carrying out the spirit of the 
new law. That could take until next summer. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. law also requires that the two countries work out a trade agreement before 
the Administration can restore most-favored-nation benefits to the Soviet 
Union, U.S. trade officials said. A Soviet delegation, meeting with Mosbacher, 
agreed Thursday to preliminary explorations. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Administration appeared to soften its tone on another key trade 
issue with the Soviets -- whether the United States would drop its opposition 
to Soviet membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the 
Geneva-based organization that administers world trade rules. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Washington had flatly refused even to consider Soviet 
membership in GATT. It contended publicly that the way the Soviet economy works 
would not be compatible with GATT rules, which are based on market economies. 
</P>
<P>
Although officials insist that the U.S. position has not changed, senior 
Administration officials reportedly were somewhat more flexible in discussions 
with the Soviets on Wednesday and Thursday, saying that Washington would not be 
able to consider such a move soon.

The softening of the U.S. tone was seen as another response to the Soviets' 
economic reforms and not as any indication that the Administration will soon 
endorse Soviet membership in the 97-country group.

The statements by officials were designed to quell speculation raised by 
Mosbacher's comments that Bush may announce the action during his meeting with 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev Dec. 2-3 in the Mediterranean near Malta.

The White House has insisted repeatedly that the two men will not make any 
major decisions during the summit.

 Approval of the trade privileges would be an important symbolic milestone in 
the improving U.S.-Soviet relationship, putting Moscow on the same trade 
footing as the United States' Western allies and other trading partners.

A former deputy Communist Party secretary made tens of thousands of dollars and 
lived like a king while serving a six-year jail sentence for corruption, the 
Legal Daily reported Thursday.

Chen Zhengsu was sent to prison in Huainan, central Anhui province, in 1986, 
but he never spent a night in a cell or ate a meal with other prisoners. 
Working with partners on the outside and using stolen materials from the 
inside, Chen ran a hardware factory, shops and printing center, and he enjoyed 
a private room and special food, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
For allowing this, 16 officials have received severe warnings and party 
punishments, the paper said.

ARCHDIOCESE, SALVADORANS IN L.A. DEPLORE SLAYINGS

Members of Los Angeles' large Salvadoran community and their supporters are 
flooding community centers and churches with offers to donate blood, raise 
funds or participate in public protests. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of outrage in the community because of the indiscriminate 
(government) bombing against civilians," said Carolina Castaneda, a coordinator 
with the Central American Refugee Committee and a Salvadoran refugee herself. 
"The outrage has been magnified by the massacre of the priests." 
</P>
<P>
The killings Thursday of six Jesuit priests, including the renowned rector and 
vice rector of San Salvador's leading Catholic university, followed a week of 
escalating combat between government and guerrilla forces. 
</P>
<P>
"People are angry. They are very angry," said Castaneda. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the estimated 350,000 Salvadorans in Los Angeles have participated in 
protests against the war this week in front of the Salvadoran Consulate near 
MacArthur Park. Another community demonstration against the escalating violence 
is planned for Saturday at MacArthur Park, the heart of Los Angeles' Central 
American community. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Archbishop Roger M. Mahony said Thursday that the "tragic 
slaughter" of the Jesuit priests "signals a new, ominous chapter in this 
country which has already experienced such suffering." 
</P>
<P>
"Innocent people continue to be the victims caught between the differing 
ideologies of the government and the guerrillas. . . , " Mahony said. 
</P>
<P>
A Mass in memory of the slain priests was held Thursday night at Our Lady Queen 
of Angels, the downtown Catholic church that is also known as La Placita. 
</P>
<P>
The murders stunned the dozen or more human rights, peace activists and relief 
groups in Los Angeles that all week have been mobilizing to send aid and 
medical supplies to the Salvadoran people. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like our worst fears being realized," said Father Don W. Lewis, rector of 
St. Edmond's Episcopal Church in San Marino.

U.S. TO PRESS FOR PROBE OF KILLINGS

The Bush Administration said Thursday that it will ask the government of El 
Salvador to investigate the murders of six Roman Catholic priests and two 
civilian women, but officials said that they have no evidence that Salvadoran 
government forces are responsible for the killings. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not know who committed this barbarous act, which we condemn in the 
strongest possible terms," State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said. 
She added that the Administration is accelerating the delivery of military aid 
to the Salvadoran army, which is battling a major offensive by Marxist 
guerrillas in the capital of San Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
A human rights group and Democrats in Congress said that they had received 
credible reports that Salvadoran troops carried out the murders, in which six 
Jesuit priests, a cook and her 15-year-old daughter were killed. 
</P>
<P>
"At least one eyewitness saw uniformed armed men entering the Jesuit rectory 
right before the murders," the human rights group, Americas Watch, said in a 
letter to Secretary of State James A. Baker III. 
</P>
<P>
But Asst. Secretary of State Bernard Aronson, in a closed-door briefing for 
members of Congress, said that the Administration has no information about the 
murders, according to representatives who were present. 
</P>
<P>
Several Democrats said they were angered by Aronson's account. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he had no verification that they had even occurred," said California 
Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez). "Yet he could verify every FMLN (rebel) 
killing for the last 24 years." "He said there are lots of armed men in San 
Salvador who wear uniforms, (and asked) 'how would we know who they were?' " 
recalled another source who was present. 
</P>
<P>
California Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said that she asked Aronson 
whether the Administration would stop U.S. military aid to El Salvador if it 
were established that the army had carried out the murders. 
</P>
<P>
"He said we shouldn't cut off the aid, but those people should be brought to 
justice," she said. "My question is, when does a violation of human rights 
become the government's responsibility?" 
</P>
<P>
Aronson's office did not respond to a request for comment on the congressional 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Pelosi, Rep. Joe Moakley (D-Mass.) and 113 other members of Congress sent a 
telegram to Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani and to leaders of the 
rebel's Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front asking them to agree to a 
cease-fire and to resume peace negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
But Aronson told House members that the Administration does not favor a 
cease-fire, because it would allow the rebels to resupply their troops, 
according to several congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has requested $85 million in military aid and $285 million 
in economic aid for El Salvador, which has been locked in civil war since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress said that, despite the Democrats' complaints about the 
Administration's position, there is little prospect of any reduction in aid. 
</P>
<P>
"People aren't willing to take that step, partly because there's no sympathy 
for the FMLN," said Pelosi. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler said that U.S. Ambassador William G. Walker has been instructed to 
press for a full investigation of the killings by Salvadoran authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Salvadoran officials have investigated several major murders among thousands of 
death-squad killings during the past decade, but few cases have resulted in 
convictions.

STRUCTURE IS LARGEST YET SEEN IN UNIVERSE; 
</P>
<P>
ASTRONOMY: A NEWLY DISCOVERED SHEET OF GALAXIES STRETCHES FOR 500 MILLION 
LIGHT-YEARS. HARVARD SCIENTISTS CALL THEIR DISCOVERY THE GREAT WALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists have discovered the largest structure seen so far in the universe, a 
narrow sheet of galaxies stretching more than half a billion light years across 
space. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists, who have pioneered in the effort to determine the large-scale 
structure of the universe by creating three-dimensional images of space, have 
called their discovery the Great Wall. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Geller and John Huchra of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for 
Astrophysics in Cambridge said the string of galaxies is 500 million 
light-years long, 200 million light-years wide, and about 15 million 
light-years thick. (A light-year is the distance light travels in a year, about 
6 trillion miles.) They reported their discovery in today's issue of the 
journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
The Great Wall is more than 200 million light-years away from Earth, and it 
cannot be seen with the unaided eye. In fact, it does not even show up in 
normal astronomical photographs because it is revealed only through a 
three-dimensional effect. 
</P>
<P>
Geller and Huchra are engaged in an ambitious research project that has 
revolutionized the thinking on the shape of outer space. By measuring the 
distance between Earth and 10,000 galaxies in a pie-shaped wedge of the 
northern celestial hemisphere, they have been able to plot the galaxies with a 
computer and they have produced some startling results. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago they announced that their first three-dimensional image revealed 
that the universe is structured around giant voids that look somewhat like soap 
bubbles in a dishpan. Galaxies are strung along the skin of the "bubbles," and 
scientists have debated fiercely over how the bubbles could have been created. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the bubbles are huge, measuring 150 million light-years in diameter. 
That is so big that scientists are at a loss to explain how the matter that 
makes up galaxies could have been swept clear of such a large area in the 10 to 
20 billion years since the universe was born. 
</P>
<P>
Early explanations, including the suggestion that massive explosions sent 
matter flying out from the center of the voids to create the bubble effect, 
have not gained acceptance because scientists cannot explain how matter could 
have traveled far enough to create the giant voids in the lifetime of the 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
Today's announcement only adds to the mystery and was described by the two 
scientists as "one of the most sobering results" of their research. 
</P>
<P>
It may well be that there are even much larger structures waiting to be 
discovered, further complicating the lives of cosmologists who are already 
struggling to explain why the universe should have enormous areas that are 
devoid of galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
"The size of the largest structures we detect is limited only by the extent of 
the survey," Geller said. 
</P>
<P>
Although earlier attempts to determine the structure of the universe suggested 
in the 1970s that space had some areas that were devoid of galaxies, Geller and 
Huchra were the first to carry the surveys far enough into space to see the 
large-scale structures, including the bubbles and the Great Wall. 
</P>
<P>
They have used the 60-inch telescope at the Smithsonian's Whipple Observatory 
on Mt. Hopkins, Ariz., to measure the "red shift" of galaxies in a pie-shaped 
"slice of the universe." As a galaxy speeds away from the Earth, the light it 
emits is shifted to the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum. By measuring 
the red shift, the scientists are able to determine the distance to the 
galaxies. 
</P>
<P>
The first results suggested that voids were present. Subsequent surveys, 
looking twice as far into space as previous efforts, revealed that the patterns 
continued farther out. 
</P>
<P>
The Great Wall became a distinct structure as the scientists finished their 
fourth "slice of the universe."

U.S.-MEXICO FAMILY-PLANNING GROUP FORMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three years ago, Maria Erana of Tijuana was in the predicament of many Mexican 
women. She was poor, unmarried and pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
And she did as many others do. She crossed the border and had an abortion in 
San Diego. The procedure is illegal in Mexico, except in certain cases, such as 
after rapes or when the child is likely to be born deformed. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't ready for a child," explained Erana, now in training as a lawyer in 
Tijuana. "I wanted to rise above my economic circumstances, to complete my 
studies. I knew that I wouldn't be able to do that while supporting a child on 
my own." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Erana and pro-choice representatives from both sides of the border 
announced formation of a unique binational effort dedicated to protecting and 
furthering women's family-planning practices in Mexico and the United States. 
Their planned campaign is in response to what they categorize as an effort to 
curtail options in both nations. 
</P>
<P>
"Women on both sides of the border stand together in solidarity in support of a 
woman's right to make choices that are right for her life and the well-being of 
her family," said a joint statement read by Shireen Miles, associate director 
of the Federation of Feminist Women's Health Centers, a Los Angeles-based 
umbrella organization representing 20 clinics throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The border, Miles noted, has long been traversed by women seeking abortions. 
Before abortion was legalized in the United States, many U.S. women traveled to 
Mexico to have illegal abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Now, there is fear of increased restrictions in both nations, as well as a 
reduction in federal funds to family planning clinics in U.S. border areas that 
are used by Mexican women seeking abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Among other actions, the federation has planned a conference in Tijuana on Nov. 
25 to discuss tactics to counter anti-abortion efforts. There will also be an 
accelerated exchange of information and expertise between women' groups in the 
two nations, the federation said.

AFL-CIO SIDESTEPS DEBATE ON ABORTION, SHOWING SCHISM ON ISSUE AMONG UNIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Although most national organizations long ago chose sides in the abortion 
debate that has been dominating America's political scene, delegates to the 
AFL-CIO convention Thursday settled for a resolution promising to study the 
question of what side organized labor should support. 
</P>
<P>
The compromise -- engineered by pro-choice women who feared they would lose an 
outright confrontation -- was an illustration of the schisms that exist in the 
AFL-CIO, which Thursday ended a week-long convention dedicated to proclaiming 
new-found levels of solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
On one side of the abortion question were several major unions with heavy 
female membership. They wanted the 14-million-member labor federation to take a 
firm pro-choice stand, as virtually all of organized labor's political allies 
have done. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side was the AFL-CIO's socially conservative executive council, 
populated largely by middle-aged white men. The 35-member executive council has 
only three women, although they make up a third of organized labor's rank and 
file. 
</P>
<P>
Organized labor has avoided the issue of abortion for years because it stands 
to alienate someone no matter which way it goes. 
</P>
<P>
A pro-choice stance would be offensive to many of labor's Catholic members, 
including millions of building trades members concentrated in the Northeast and 
the burgeoning Latino population that is regarded as a fertile source of future 
membership. 
</P>
<P>
However, failure to adopt a pro-choice position would hamper labor's stated 
goal of appealing to women in general. Women are a strong majority of the work 
force in areas like health care and the service sector, which labor needs to 
organize to make up for deep losses in the industrial sector. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-choice forces throughout the nation began a furious lobbying campaign in 
July after the Supreme Court ruled that states could limit abortion rights. The 
resulting grass-roots campaign was credited with significantly helping 
Democratic candidates in last week's elections, particularly in the Virginia 
governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
After July's Supreme Court ruling, several unions submitted a half-dozen 
pro-choice resolutions to the AFL-CIO convention's resolutions committee. The 
proposals joined a list of hundreds of other resolutions that are routinely, 
and usually quietly, taken up at the convention. 
</P>
<P>
However, the resolutions committee, which includes the executive council and 17 
other labor leaders, indicated it did not want to bring the pro-choice 
resolutions to the floor. It was clear a floor fight on abortion would be 
embarrassing, particularly at a convention whose official theme was 
"solidarity," sources familiar with the conflict said. 
</P>
<P>
So a deal was cut. The convention would merely call on the executive council to 
appoint a committee to fashion labor's stand on abortion, hopefully by February 
for the next quarterly meeting of the executive council. 
</P>
<P>
Several women who hold high positions in their unions privately said they were 
disappointed with the compromise but said it was necessary to avoid having the 
subject quashed entirely by the resolutions committee. 
</P>
<P>
They will now lobby the executive council to draft a pro-choice stance that 
leans heavily on casting abortion as a civil rights issue, taking pains to 
acknowledge that there is room for disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
"These are sensitive issues," said Joyce Miller, a member of the executive 
council and a vice president of the 180,000-member Amalgamated Clothing and 
Textile Workers Union, in a convention speech in favor of the compromise. "We 
need time to build the coalitions that are necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Cowell, a vice president of the 153,000-member International Ladies 
Garment Workers Union, stressed that she and other pro-choice delegates "did 
not choose this issue. . . . The Reagan court has forced it on us. . . . Labor 
cannot stand on the sidelines on the great issues." 
</P>
<P>
In tribute to how smoothly the compromise was orchestrated, all nine delegates 
who rose to speak on the abortion issue were pro-choice advocates, and eight of 
them supported the compromise, rather than an immediate vote. 
</P>
<P>
The dissenter, Henry Nicholas, a member of the 1.1-million-member American 
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Union, said: "The entire 
labor movement must summon the moral courage to say yes . . . which side are we 
on? The labor movement must not wait on the moment."

SENATE DROPS EFFORT TO WIDEN ABORTION RIGHTS 
</P>

<P>
Bowing to presidential veto threats, the Senate Thursday dropped efforts to 
provide government-paid abortions for poor women in cases of rape or incest. 
</P>
<P>
In another abortion-related decision, however, the House Thursday joined the 
Senate in defying the possibility of a presidential veto by voting to approve a 
$14.6-billion foreign aid bill that earmarks $15 million for the United Nations 
family planning agency. 
</P>
<P>
The House's 207-200 vote was a reversal from an earlier decision that 
effectively blocked funding for the family planning agency. The Senate voted to 
approve the family planning funds Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents warned that the President would veto the measure even though the bill 
includes high-priority aid to Poland and Hungary as well as billions for other 
nations, including Israel, Egypt, Pakistan and the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
"This bill is absolutely unacceptable," said Rep. Christopher H. Smith 
(R-N.J.), who, along with Bush, charged that the U.N. agency has promoted a 
program of coerced abortions in China. To meet this objection, the House added 
an amendment to provide that the $15 million would be returned if any of it 
were used in China or for abortions anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
In the measure involving government-paid abortions in the United States in rape 
and incest cases, the Senate approved by voice vote a $157-billion 
appropriations bill for major health, welfare and education programs without 
the language on expanded abortion rights. Bush had rejected the bill the first 
time around because it called for expanded abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
Conforming to the President's wishes, the legislation -- which has now passed 
both chambers of Congress -- provides Medicaid funding of abortions for 
low-income women only if the life of the mother is endangered by the pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), manager of the money bill in the Senate, said swift 
passage of the measure was needed to prevent spending cutbacks in such popular 
programs as Head Start, student loans, Meals on Wheels and health care for the 
elderly. 
</P>
<P>
If Bush were to veto the bill after Congress has adjourned for the year, 
spending on these programs would revert to lower levels provided in the 
previous fiscal year, Harkin indicated. 
</P>
<P>
"But we'll be back next year," Harkin said, referring to the rape-incest 
provision he authored in the first version of the bill that was unexpectedly 
accepted by the House in a 216-206 roll call Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion rights advocates in the House agreed with the Senate's decision to 
avoid another confrontation over the issue at this time. They said they lacked 
the votes to override a second Bush veto on the rape-incest provision. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional sources said anti-abortion forces in the House were prepared to 
allow Medicaid-paid abortions for rape and incest victims if they reported the 
crimes to police within 48 hours. Pro-choice lawmakers said the notice period 
was too short because victims of rape and incest often were extremely reluctant 
to talk about the offenses to anyone for days, if not weeks or months, 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
The issue has become highly political since the Supreme Court decision in July 
authorized states to do more to limit abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Many moderate Republicans -- especially those seeking statewide office -- have 
appealed to the President to soften his stand against abortion payments for 
poor women in rape and incest cases, but so far he has stood fast. 
</P>
<P>
Taking a sharply different stance than the President, for example, Sen. Pete 
Wilson (R-Calif.), a candidate for governor next year, announced that he would 
sponsor a "freedom of choice" bill to guarantee a woman's right to have an 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision to terminate a pregnancy is so intensely personal that no one but 
the woman can be permitted to make it," Wilson said in a statement. "Government 
does nothing wise or good if it enacts laws that force this decision 
underground and compel otherwise law-abiding citizens to resort to illegal and 
dangerous back-alley medical treatment or self-performed abortions." 
</P>
<P>
The California Constitution, Wilson noted, includes a guarantee of abortion 
rights, but federal law is necessary to protect women in other states where 
there is no such constitutional guarantee.

FAST-LANE SAGA OVER: WIDOW GUILTY IN MURDER OF HUSBAND

For 3 1/2 years it has been Miami's most popular murder mystery, featuring 
tales of adultery, a squad of professional hit men and a jet-set life style 
that included snorting cocaine with country singing star Tanya Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
It began March 7, 1986, when millionaire developer Stanley Cohen, 52, was found 
dead in his bed. He was naked, and he had been shot four times in the head with 
his own gun. It ended here Thursday when a jury found his 39-year-old widow, 
Joyce Cohen, guilty of first-degree murder for hiring the hit men, apparently 
because she feared a divorce would leave her impoverished. 
</P>
<P>
After the verdict was read, Joyce Cohen, dressed in black, showed no emotion. 
The state is seeking the death penalty. The jury will make its recommendation 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Right from the start the Cohen murder case made bold headlines. Stanley Cohen, 
a barrel-chested fitness buff and Joyce, his one-time secretary who became his 
third wife, lived in a large Coconut Grove coral rock home, and traveled often 
by private jet. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Cohen was not charged with murder until October of 1988, more than a year 
after the alleged hit men were arrested. One of those men, convicted robber 
Frank Zuccarello, 25, told police that Joyce Cohen had offered him and his 
partners $100,000 to kill her husband, and had even provided them with a map of 
the house and shut off the burglar alarm. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Kevin DiGregory portrayed the wife as a woman so bored with her 
husband that they had not had sex for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Cohen contended that her husband was killed by mysterious intruders. 
Weeks after her husband's death, she passed a lie detector test and called a 
press conference to announce the results. 
</P>
<P>
The case never strayed far from the public's attention. One of the most 
sensational newspaper reports was based on a 46-page transcript of a Miami 
detective's interview with Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker was quoted as saying that the month before the murder she shared some 
cocaine with Joyce Cohen, who began to confide the details of her failing 
marriage. The wife was "very upset," Tucker said, because her husband had a 
girlfriend whom he had gotten pregnant. "She seemed kind of a pain-wracked 
person," Tucker added.

SOCIAL SECURITY UPDATES PAY RECORDS, ADDS $84 BILLION 
</P>

<P>
The Social Security Administration disclosed Thursday that it has added $84 
billion to workers' wage records, increasing potential retirement benefits for 
13 million workers who did not get full credit for their earnings between 1978 
and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The additional earnings come from clearing up discrepancies between separate 
reports by businesses to the Internal Revenue Service and the Social Security 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"Workingmen and -women in this country have a right to know that each dollar 
they earn will be accurately credited to their Social Security records," Social 
Security Commissioner Gwendolyn S. King said. "It is simply unacceptable for 
anyone to receive less than their entitled Social Security benefits because 
their wages were, at some point in their career, improperly recorded," she told 
a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Companies send the IRS quarterly reports on their workers' total earnings and 
taxes withheld. In addition, the firms send the Social Security Administration 
annual reports for each individual worker. Because some companies disappear 
each year through mergers, buyouts and bankruptcies, the IRS and Social 
Security totals frequently do not match. For about 1 million workers a year, 
more earnings are reported to the IRS than are credited by Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
A massive backlog of cases of under-reported income developed in recent years, 
drawing criticism from the General Accounting Office and members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Social Security has become more aggressive in contacting businesses to clear up 
the backlog. About 60% of the backlog of cases between 1978 and 1983, which 
totaled about 9.7 million workers, has been resolved, with workers getting 
additional credit for their earnings, Norman Goldstein, Social Security's chief 
financial officer, said. 
</P>
<P>
Goldstein predicted that most of the remaining cases -- nearly 4 million -- 
will be resolved when individual workers ask Social Security for records of 
their past earnings and make corrections in mistaken reports. 
</P>
<P>
Workers can request a Personal Earnings and Benefit Estimate statement by 
calling the local Social Security office or a toll-free number: 1-800-234-5772. 
The errors can also be corrected when workers apply for retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Pension benefits are calculated through a complex formula pegged to a worker's 
highest 30 years of earnings. Social Security officials had no estimates of the 
amount of increased benefits now available to those workers whose records were 
corrected. 
</P>
<P>
Corrections in the backlog of cases from 1984 through 1987 should be completed 
by October of next year, according to Goldstein. The IRS is preparing a 
regulation that would require businesses to compare their IRS and Social 
Security reports and clear up discrepancies. 
</P>
<P>
Social Security is also beginning a campaign to persuade businesses to send 
better annual reports. King said that her agency has developed voluntary 
standards.

UC URGED TO BORROW $50 MILLION FOR SEISMIC WORK 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
The University of California should borrow up to $50 million for quick seismic 
safety work on its nine campuses, UC President David P. Gardner said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The money would be in addition to the estimated $30 million the university 
needs to repair damage from last month's earthquake at the Santa Cruz, San 
Francisco and Berkeley campuses. 
</P>
<P>
UC hopes to receive the $30 million soon from state and federal sources but 
cannot count on getting all the other money needed for preventive work sooner 
than the next 10 to 15 years, according to Gardner. So the university must 
either issue bonds or take out bank loans for the $50 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We should do the work now instead of waiting 10 or 15 years," Gardner told the 
Board of Regents. He said the loans could be repaid through the nearly $6 
million a year that UC receives from the federal government for running energy 
and nuclear weapons laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
The $50 million would be used to shore up the most vulnerable UC buildings and 
is only a fraction of the money required to strengthen all campus structures, 
UC officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In other business, a UC regents committee approved increases in student 
education and registration fees of 4.7% for California residents and 2.5% for 
out-of-staters next year. Excluding housing, food and books, a UC education 
would cost in-staters $1,703 and non-Californians $7,619 under the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The increase for out-of-staters would be small compared to the double-digit 
hikes of recent previous years. UC officials fear that too big a jump next fall 
would slow the flow of talented graduate students to California from around the 
nation and world. Many other state universities charge non-residents about $900 
less in annual tuition than UC does, according to a recent survey. 
</P>
<P>
The full Board of Regents is expected to adopt those increases today along with 
a request to the state for $2.37 billion in operating funds for 1990-91. That 
would be 10% more than the current budget and, regents said, would help 
accommodate expected enrollment growth of about 3,050, bringing the UC student 
body to 162,000. 
</P>
<P>
A representative of the UC Student Assn. said his group would not oppose the 
fee increases. "While any increase in the cost of education poses a burden for 
students and their families, these proposals are reasonable," John Leyman, a UC 
Riverside senior, told the regents. 
</P>
<P>
The regents also heard a report from Karen McNally, director of the Richter 
Seismology Laboratory at UC Santa Cruz. The Oct. 17 earthquake, centered in the 
Santa Cruz Mountains, appeared to follow warning signs that McNally said may 
help scientists predict big temblors. 
</P>
<P>
Showing similarities to other earthquakes around the world, the 7.1 magnitude 
quake last month was preceded by a 5.2 quake in August along the same section 
of the San Andreas Fault, another moderate temblor in the area in June, 1988, 
and seven prior years of relative seismic quiet in the region, according to 
McNally. 
</P>
<P>
She urged UC and state leaders to increase funds for seismic monitoring 
stations to help warn Californians that a big earthquake might occur within one 
to three years after warning signs are detected. 
</P>
<P>
McNally cautioned the regents not to build any proposed new campus near an 
earthquake fault. That argument might bolster bids for a UC campus by Central 
Valley communities, most of which are far from major fault lines.

ADMIRAL SAYS MISHAPS MAY BE ROOTED IN COMPLACENCY

A rash of Navy accidents may signal an outbreak of complacency among Navy 
personnel following completion of stressful ocean maneuvers, Chief of Naval 
Operations Adm. Carlisle A. H. Trost told a congressional committee Thursday, 
the second day of an unprecedented Navy-wide safety review. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we saying to ourselves: 'OK, the hard stuff's over, this is a piece of 
cake'?" Trost mused before the Senate Armed Services Committee. The sudden 
spurt in mishaps, many of which came on the heels of a virtually accident-free 
Pacific exercise, "does lead one to conclude that perhaps people are more 
safety-conscious when operation tempo increases," Trost said. 
</P>
<P>
Trost said "we place strong emphasis on supervisor and officer oversight," but 
several senators nevertheless harshly criticized the Navy for lapses in 
managing its personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Trost and other naval officials also faced harsh criticism for the Navy's probe 
of the April 19 explosion aboard the battleship Iowa, which killed 47 sailors. 
</P>
<P>
In concluding that blast probably was a deliberate act by Gunner's Mate Clayton 
M. Hartwig, the Navy disregarded glaring lapses in Navy safety practices and 
personnel procedures, congressional critics charged. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an appalling, appalling situation aboard a capital ship of the U.S. 
Navy," said Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio). Hartwig and several other sailors killed 
in the explosion were from Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn repeated a litany of management shortcomings aboard the Iowa, ranging 
from the unauthorized live-firing experiments aboard the ship to inadequate 
training and certification of sailors. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Navy's investigation called the deficiencies "a foundation for 
disaster," the probe concluded that they did not cause the April blast or 
contribute to the loss of lives. 
</P>
<P>
Other senators and critics of the Navy joined forces to blast investigators for 
discounting evidence contradicting the official conclusion that Hartwig 
probably set off the explosion in a suicide attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a report that seems based on supposition and guesswork rather than fact 
and physical evidence. It is in short a report that appears to be unraveling" 
said Sen. Alan J. Dixon (D-Ill.). 
</P>
<P>
"I do not think we can have this flawed investigation stand as the truth of 
what happened," added Dixon, who called for an agency separate from the Navy to 
conduct a new probe. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of a barrage of criticism, Navy Rear Adm. Richard D. Milligan, who 
directed the probe, staunchly defended his panel's conclusion. "I know of 
nothing that would cause me to change my report," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Committee chair Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) dismissed the proposal of an independent 
study as costly and duplicative. 
</P>
<P>
But the father of one of the casualties applauded the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're covering their butts all the way from the top to the bottom," 
said Robert Gedeon of Lakewood, Ohio, the father of Seaman Apprentice Robert 
Gedeon III. 
</P>
<P>
"My kid is dead. If the Navy is going to spend $20 million to fix that gun, it 
can spend the same amount of money to find out what killed our boys -- and 
what's still killing our boys," he added, in a reference to the recent rash of 
accidents.

Two committees formed to study water policy issues -- one in the San Francisco 
Bay Area and one in Southern California -- said Thursday that they have joined 
forces to seek an end to California's water wars. 
</P>
<P>
The groups are the Southern California Water Committee, chaired by Ventura 
County Supervisor John Flynn, and the Bay Area's Committee for Water Policy 
Consensus, headed by Contra Costa County Supervisor Sunne McPeak. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn and McPeak said the new State Water Conservation Coalition includes local 
governments, business interests and environmentalists. They told the state 
Water Resources Control Board that the new group will work for a statewide 
consensus on the volatile issue of water quality in the San Francisco-San 
Joaquin River Delta. 
</P>
<P>
Water drawn from the delta currently is used by San Joaquin Valley farmers and 
the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which imports Northern 
California water for use by urban Southern California.

Two huge ammunition dumps used by Afghan guerrillas exploded and caught fire in 
northwestern Pakistan, raining missiles over a wide area and killing at least 
18 people and injuring eight others, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We had this incredible shower of missiles, which spread terror and forced the 
people to run for shelter," said one witness reached by telephone from 
Peshawar. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the blasts occurred at about 4 p.m. Wednesday near the village of 
Gharam Chasma, about 25 miles from the Afghan border in northwestern Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the blasts was not immediately clear, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have charged agents of the Communist government in neighboring 
Afghanistan with staging hundreds of bomb attacks that have killed scores of 
people in Pakistan over the last few years.

U.S. OUSTS KEATING, AIDES FROM CONTROL OF 2 LUXURY HOTELS

<P>
Federal regulators Thursday ousted Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan owner Charles H. 
Keating Jr. and more than two dozen of his associates from management of two 
troubled Arizona hotels partly owned by the failed Irvine thrift. 
</P>
<P>
More than 60 regulators, lawyers, federal marshals and locksmiths walked into 
the posh Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale and the Crescent Hotel in downtown 
Phoenix at 1:30 a.m. to seize control of the lodges. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators seized Lincoln on April 14, a day after its parent company filed for 
bankruptcy protection. It will cost taxpayers as much as $2 billion to bail out 
the insolvent institution, making it the largest thrift failure on record. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln invested a total of $324 million in the two hotels, which are among its 
major problem assets. The government will continue to operate the hotels, along 
with Lincoln, until it can find buyers for the assets. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln, through a subsidiary, owns 55% of the Phoenician, a luxury lodge 
nestled at the foot of the Saddleback Mountains, and the Crescent, an upscale 
hotel for business executives. The Kuwait Investment Office, an investment 
firm, owns the remaining 45%. 
</P>
<P>
Keating had retained control of the hotels even after regulators seized Lincoln 
because a contract with the Kuwaiti investors required a 75% vote to change 
management. Until Thursday, Keating had been able to keep the Kuwaitis on his 
side, thwarting government attempts to remove him. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators had been wooing the foreign investors since April to join with them 
in ousting Keating. 
</P>
<P>
In seizing the hotels, regulators threw out as many as 30 employees and 
managers, including Keating, his wife and other family members. Others removed 
were Michael Kelly and Robert J. Hubbard Jr., general managers of the 
Phoenician and the Crescent, respectively. Hubbard also is a son-in-law of 
Keating. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the fired executives learned about their dismissals through notes taped 
to the doors of their homes at 2 a.m. A handful of people, wearing large brown 
and yellow buttons declaring, "I Like Charlie Keating," gathered at the 
Phoenician at 3 a.m. to find out why they were let go. 
</P>
<P>
The takeover surprised and angered American Continental officials, said Bradley 
J. Boland, another Keating son-in-law and corporate spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"The Gestapo came in and took over," Boland said. "These guys don't know which 
side of the Berlin Wall they're on." 
</P>
<P>
Boland characterized the seizure as "a blatant act of terrorism" on the part of 
federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
"They locked up doors," he said. "They locked up offices. Then they sent an 
army out to post severence notices on doors of employees they were firing. They 
cut out the major portion of the senior management that ran and made the resort 
the most successful resort anywhere in the country. They ruined it today." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Boland said, the resort's gross revenues were more than $4.3 
million, and the Phoenician had become a "magnet" for Arizona's economic 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Resolution Trust Corp., a new federal agency created to operate failed thrifts, 
said it had hired Hans D. Turnovszky to manage the two hotels. Turnovszky is a 
25-year veteran of the hotel industry, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The hotels were high on the list of risky investments identified by regulators 
in their examinations of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln invested $296 million in the Phoenician. Cost overruns and other 
expenses ran so high that federal examiners determined that the resort would 
lose money even if it were fully occupied. The resort currently is about 95% 
occupied, regulators said. 
</P>
<P>
Built on 130 acres, the Phoenician consists of 474 hotel rooms, 131 cottages, a 
22,000-square-foot ballroom, 21 meeting rooms, six restaurants, a golf course, 
10 lighted tennis courts, a health club and an acre of pools set on three 
tiers, each with different water temperatures. Its restaurants include Mary 
Elaine's, named after Keating's wife, and Charlie Charlie's, named after 
Keating. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln invested $28 million in the Crescent. Last year, regulators said that 
the hotel had incurred a $5.2-million operating deficit since it opened in 
1986.

BEHIND THE WHEEL: GM PRODUCES NEW MINIVAN GENERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When American Dreamers drove the firstborn of the baby boom to their Kaiser 
homes in the San Fernando Valley ("Northridge Knolls . . . $8,000 -- GIs No 
Down"), it was in another suburban essential of those late '40s -- the 
plastiwood-paneled, chromium-plated, harmonica-grilled, nine-passenger station 
wagon. 
</P>
<P>
Park Club. Country Squire. The names implied living in Connecticut, working in 
the big city, and men in gray flannel suits drinking arid martinis on commuter 
trains. In the four decades since, Americans have bought about 35 million 
station wagons. 
</P>
<P>
But today's trend -- and one still based as much on image as on any straight 
sense of utility -- is away from the station wagon and toward several dozen 
marques of imported and domestic minivans. 
</P>
<P>
Station wagon sales are down and stuck around 700,000 units annually. Next 
year, say researchers, minivan sales could touch one million. Of particular 
satisfaction to flag-waggers, Lee Iacocca and the UAW is that 97% of the U.S. 
market is held by domestic minivans and 51% of that huge slice belongs to 
Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes General Motors with the second generation of minivans -- that are so 
rounded, so streamlined, so wedgy, they make earlier editions look like 
Conestoga wagons. They will be battling Ford (the existing Aerostar) and 
Chrysler (Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager) and the imports from Mazda and 
Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
Under the generic heading of All-Purpose Vehicle, GM's entry is a 
three-division product. Pontiac calls its version the Trans Sport and it is on 
sale this month. Chevrolet introduced the Lumina APV in September. Oldsmobile 
will come to market later this year with its Silhouette. 
</P>
<P>
They are identical vehicles apart from some reworked skirting here, a different 
facia line there and leather upholstery available only on the slightly 
up-market Oldsmobile. 
</P>
<P>
All come with 3.1-liter, V-6 engines, automatic transmission and injection 
molded fenders that pop out like Ping-Pong balls when dented by the dings and 
furrows of outrageous parking. 
</P>
<P>
Price ($15,000 for naked versions, $20,000 for one with all toys and trimmings) 
and performance are much the same and so is the 2001 styling input by Italian 
designer Pinafarina. 
</P>
<P>
With their sloping noses, generous use of aerospace carbon composites and low 
aerodynamic coefficients, the APV appears to have been whelped at Edwards Air 
Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
The windshield is 17 square feet of glass raked to a 66-degree slope. To reduce 
the obvious greenhouse effect, a special coating has been applied to reflect 
60% of the solar heat load away from driver and passengers. To increase the 
space shuttle look, the pitch of the windshield continues through the hood line 
and flows into grooved, bulging bumpers suggesting an air-cushion vehicle for 
lunar cruising. 
</P>
<P>
By concept and purpose, however, the APV is strictly down-to-earth. 
</P>
<P>
The average suburban mom and dad with their 1.4 pets and 2.5 children hitting 
.384 in Little League have had it with station wagons that drive like pickups. 
</P>
<P>
They have found that even fur-lined vans equipped with VCRs and bean bag chairs 
lurch and clatter no less than the van driven by the pool cleaning man. 
</P>
<P>
Missing has been a family vehicle that implied urban-rural elegance, had enough 
hauling area to satisfy Bekins -- and really did drive like a car. 
</P>
<P>
The APV is such a vehicle and Pontiac's Trans Sport (based on the Pontiac 6000 
platform) is typical of GM's series. 
</P>
<P>
Here is emphasis on functional design before attention to styling. Here is the 
product of some serious team-think about end use: If seats are to be removable, 
can they be removed quickly, easily and by an fumble-fingered owner who thinks 
a socket wrench is a torn rotator cuff? Does interior space equate to maximum 
usable space? How much additional loading room in the rear is allowed by 
front-wheel drive, which does not require differential and drive-shaft humps? 
Does the ride approximate that of a car or is it exactly the feel and 
performance of a car? 
</P>
<P>
The verdict: the minivan should do for family men what the mini-truck has done 
so successfully for the handyman. 
</P>
<P>
Visually the Trans Sport is exquisite. 
</P>
<P>
It is over styled, of course, and really does look like something that should 
be mounted on the monorail at Disneyland. But if God had been interested in 
purpose devoid of shape, he would have given Eve square shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
So the Trans Sport has been allowed to flow and sweep and those are verbs of 
the wind, not some mechanical blockhouse. Slotted magnesium wheels are in 
concert with the grooved, wraparound skirt. Every slope of the roof line leads 
to a curving door in search of a rounded corner. Black glass conceals ugly 
posts. All the necessities -- headlights and handles, seams and grill -- are 
flush, recessed and integral. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to composite panels (also used for hood, roof, tailgate and rear quarter 
areas) the Trans Sport's barn doors open with ease. Stepping up into the 
vehicle is a zero energy maneuver. The sit-down into bucket seats is barely 
noticeable. Such lack of extrusion is what comfortable travel is all about. 
</P>
<P>
And those seats (take your pick of benches or buckets and configurations 
ranging from five to seven passengers) really do come out with a flick and a 
click, without tools. 
</P>
<P>
All-Purpose Vehicle, however, is something of a misnomer. 
</P>
<P>
For if "all-purpose" means towing a 40-foot sailboat or hauling 8,000 pounds of 
reinforcing bars, you'd be better off with a truck. But if the average load 
tends to be no weightier nor tougher to load than a platoon of kids, four tubas 
and two damp dogs, the Trans Sport, as a people mover, is perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Now the bad news. 
</P>
<P>
Someone on Pontiac's dashboard team must have mumbled when ordering and 
mounting heater and air controls. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a downsized climate panel and tiny buttons that can only be seen 
by squinting around and below the steering wheel. How small the buttons? 
Imagine a pocket calculator. Think about operating one at arm's length while 
driving 55 m.p.h. At night. 
</P>
<P>
Ducting for the van's man-made climate is another problem. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a secondary fan for rear seat passengers, air barely whispers from 
small-mouthed vents and into the back forty. So when the environment is toasty 
and Palm Springs up front, it's Michigan out back and Seattle somewhere in 
between. 
</P>
<P>
Externally, Pontiac has persisted with door handles that are mounted north to 
south. 
</P>
<P>
Vertical handles require the application of force to either left or right of 
the handle, which is cumbersome and awkward for any tugger attempting to bring 
the door towards them. With horizontal handles, direction of force and 
direction of travel do not cancel themselves out. 
</P>
<P>
On the tailgate, Pontiac approaches handling with the right idea but, again, 
the wrong item of equipment. This time, the latch is a small butterfly handle. 
It has room only for fingertips. An entire hand around a full handle is needed 
to open and raise any tailgate. 
</P>
<P>
Some magazine critics have found fault with the power spread of the Trans 
Sport, in particular with its oomph level above 50 m.p.h. when carrying bodies. 
The Trans Sport, obviously, is no Testarossa. On the other hand, few family men 
are Ferrari drivers and all are quite accustomed to the amble of suburban 
transportation impaired by family, coolers, barbecues and beach umbrellas. 
</P>
<P>
Yet full or even half-loading represents only 8% of all trips undertaken. 
Under-loaded or empty, the Trans Sport leaves the line with ample vigor. Under 
way, it will hum along as well as anything else in the van pool. 
</P>
<P>
Brakes are all they should be and at any speed. The steering seems a little on 
the floppy side and when combined with the obvious breadth of the vehicle, 
handling becomes somewhat twitchy when crowded by irritable traffic on surface 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
In just about all other respects, the Trans Sport certainly fulfills its 
promise -- that is, to deliver the starting lineup of your high school 
basketball squad, plus totes, with the ease, comfort and quiet of a modern 
sedan. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of the APV is quite brilliant. It's the execution that is lightly 
scratched by flaws. But next year . . . well, with a tweak here and a 
correction there, GM could be hitting a home run. 
</P>
<P>
James Westby, an APV manager for GM, has noted that these minivans are aimed at 
those who have been delaying buying until someone took the bounce and boxiness 
out of the product. 
</P>
<P>
A GM marketing survey has shown that typical minivan buyers will be family 
persons and college graduates making more than $50,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
They also will be members of the fortysomething set -- whose first car rides 
likely came when their parents drove them home from the maternity ward in a 
Country Squire station wagon.

A STORY THAT MADE A SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Larsen's article, "A Mideast Oasis of Peace," (View, Oct. 20) is a very 
good example of how, in this age of information and communication, we still do 
not know about so many important and isolated things happening around the 
globe. 
</P>
<P>
Until Larsen wrote about Neve Shalom-Oasis of Peace and informed us readers at 
large of its very special program in Israel, the School of Peace, I assume most 
of us were practically ignorant of its existence. 
</P>
<P>
The diversity of special articles on hidden subjects, with their important 
details, and the people who write them do contribute a lot to the world in 
which we live, in very special ways. 
</P>
<P>
Larsen's article relates the vision of hope based on tolerance and respect to 
our human differences. It also shows how tomorrow will depend progressively on 
the information and education we get today. 
</P>
<P>
I am not suggesting that the tiny village of Neve Shalom will bring utopian 
peace to the planet Earth, nor, particularly, to that part of the world -- at 
least, as we can all imagine, not any time soon! 
</P>
<P>
But today, as we live in a world of conflict, despair and disappointment, your 
article informed us about the people who have chosen another alternative to 
violence and harsh rhetoric -- the alternative of dialogue and peace.

A sportfishing boat and a supertanker hauling jet fuel collided in the darkness

The 35 passengers and 7 crew members of the 90-foot fishing boat Shogun were

light jet fuel spilled into the sea, but officials said it evaporated rapidly

SAVANNA HIGH PROPERLY BARRED FROM TOURNAMENT, COURT RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The football season for Savanna High School ended in Orange County Superior 
Court today when a commissioner ruled that the team had been properly kicked 
out of postseason play for fielding an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
The court ruling came on the heels' of an appellate court decision Thursday 
ousting Huntington Beach's football team from the postseason tournament for 
similar reasons. (Story, A1.) 
</P>
<P>
The Savanna Rebels' booster club went to court Thursday to get the team 
reinstated. The Rebels were disqualified for using a player who was in his 
fifth year of high school. The rules of the California Scholastic 
Federation-Southern Section, which govern local high school athletics, allow 
only four years of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
"I see no abuse of discretion or violation of the rules," Commissioner Julian 
Cimbaluk said in denying Savanna's request to be reinstated. "They (league 
officials) didn't arbitrarily disqualify the team. They had the right to do so 
under the rules." 
</P>
<P>
Cimbaluk also questioned whether the booster club even had legal standing to 
sue on behalf of the football team. 
</P>
<P>
"The courts will not interfere with the discipline or expulsion of members of 
private organizations or associations where the action was taken in good faith 
in accordance with its rules," Cimbaluk said.

The Senate today returned to the White House the nomination of James Cason for 
a top natural resources job in the Agriculture Department, marking its first 
rejection of a presidential appointment since John Tower was denied 
confirmation as defense secretary. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see the handwriting on the wall," Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas 
said in asking that the Senate not act on the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), who led the opposition, said Cason would have 
been defeated by a 20-vote margin, including more than five Republicans, if a 
confirmation vote had been taken. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said he would strongly urge 
President Bush not to resubmit Cason as a nominee or appoint him during the 
congressional recess as a means of circumventing the confirmation process. 
</P>
<P>
Cason, who has been a high-ranking official at the Interior Department since 
1982, was nominated to be assistant secretary of agriculture for natural 
resources and soil conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Leahy and other opponents say his record at Interior shows a preference for 
private development interests over environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the White House said it has no intention of withdrawing the nomination.

Arthur James Julius, turning both thumbs up as a "goodby to the world," was 
executed early today in Alabama's electric chair for raping and murdering his 
cousin while free on an eight-hour pass from prison in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Julius, 42, died almost nonchalantly at 12:21 a.m. inside the Holman Prison 
execution chamber, wearing a white sweat suit, flip-flop sandals and a purple 
ribbon given to him by an anti-capital punishment group. 
</P>
<P>
Julius was the 119th person to be put to death in the United States, and the 
seventh in Alabama, since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 
1976. The execution was the 15th in the nation this year.

President Bush signed into law today legislation to boost the minimum wage to 
$4.25 an hour, promising that the first increase since 1981 will "put more 
money into the pockets of our workers." 
</P>
<P>
The White House ceremony marked the formal end of a nearly decade-long deadlock 
between the Congress and the Reagan and Bush administrations over the issue of 
raising the wage level. 
</P>
<P>
With House and Senate leaders at his side, Bush signed the legislation and 
commended the bipartisanship that crafted a compromise. After the brief 
ceremony in the Oval office, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said he, 
too, is pleased, although he had initially hoped for more.

President Bush has sent a cable to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
expressing hopes for "a calm and peaceful period of change" in Eastern Europe 
as democratic reforms are adopted, the White House said today. 
</P>
<P>
The message echoed the theme of a cable that Gorbachev sent to Bush last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the President 
"indicated his support for the changes in Eastern Europe and the reforms under 
way in the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
"He said the United States wants a calm and peaceful period of change in 
Eastern Europe as Poland, Hungary and East Germany seek to implement their 
reforms," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"The President said he believes these historic steps will make a positive 
contribution to a Europe that is whole and free," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
The message was dispatched to Moscow on Thursday evening and will be delivered 
by U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, Fitzwater had said that Gorbachev's message to Bush "underscored 
the importance of the changes taking place and expressed the hope that the 
situation will remain calm and peaceful." 
</P>
<P>
Bush and Gorbachev will meet Dec. 2 and 3 on ships off the coast of Malta for 
their first summit. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said the dominant issue will be the changes in Eastern Europe and 
their impact on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact, and 
on East-West relations in general. 
</P>
<P>
Bush talked by telephone today with President Francois Mitterrand of France, 
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West 
Germany about events in Eastern Europe and the summit. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said Bush and Mitterrand agreed to talk again after a meeting of 
European leaders this weekend and before Bush sits down with Gorbachev. Bush 
and Mulroney also said they would talk after Malta. 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the talks, Bush planned to confer at the White House today 
with four former U.S. ambassadors to the Soviet Union: George Kennan, Malcolm 
Toon, Thomas Watson and Arthur Hartman. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said the United States is not concerned that Gorbachev might spring a 
surprise on Bush, as he did with then-President Ronald Reagan when he proposed 
sweeping arms cuts during the Reykjavik summit. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said, "Obviously, if President Gorbachev makes a proposal, the 
President will say, 'Well, that's very interesting -- why do you feel that way 
and what's your reasoning?' and he'll give him his points of view and his ideas 
and say, 'We'll take these matters up with the Allies, and we'll talk about 
them again at our next summit.' " 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater added, "We don't anticipate any negotiating going on there or the 
emergence of any specific agreements in any kind of formal fashion."

ZHIVKOV OUT IN BULGARIA AS LEADER

Parliament dumped Todor Zhivkov as head of state today, and a deputy told the 
legislature's first televised session the ousted Communist Party chief had 
amassed a fortune in 35 years of secretive leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Zhivkov was replaced by Petar Mladenov, who became party leader a week ago when 
Zhivkov was forced out of that post. Mladenov, formerly foreign minister, spoke 
in his acceptance speech of radical political and economic changes, but was not 
specific. 
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 people jammed a state-sponsored rally in downtown Sofia. They 
carried banners praising perestroika, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
catchword for reform, and chanted "Zhivkov to court!" demanding that the former 
leader be tried. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 people, most of them university students, held an unofficial 
demonstration later outside the National Museum on Vitosha Boulevard, chanting 
"We want democracy!" and "Down with the murderers!" 
</P>
<P>
They called out the names of Gorbachev and Mladenov, marched down the boulevard 
and then dispersed, calling "See you tomorrow" to one another. 
</P>
<P>
An unofficial rally planned for Saturday appears to have been given official 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
The 400-member National Assembly voted unanimously by a show of hands to 
dismiss Zhivkov as head of state, then again to replace him with Mladenov. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusually frank debate, deputies praised Mladenov's "enthusiasm" for 
reform and criticized Zhivkov. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Slavcho Trnski accused the former Communist Party chief of indulging in 
a "flamboyant life style" while Bulgaria fell into economic crisis." 
</P>
<P>
He said Zhivkov owned 30 homes, was "hungry for fame" and had retained power 
through a policy of "divide and rule." 
</P>
<P>
The deputy also demanded an investigation of alleged misuse of funds by 
Zhivkov's son, Vladimir, who was removed from the Central Committee on Thursday 
and is rumored to be involved in several scandals.

At least seven of the nation's top 20 generic drug firms show signs of fraud or 
serious manufacturing flaws, but tests of leading generic drugs turned up no 
"poison pills," the Food and Drug Administration said today. 
</P>
<P>
FDA Commissioner Frank Young, who will step down from his post next month, 
reported results of special inspection efforts to a House Energy and Commerce 
subcommittee investigating the generic drug scandal. 
</P>
<P>
"At least as far as we have looked, the top 30 generic drugs, constituting 76% 
of the market, are safe," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
"Poison pills were not approved even though we had some substantial, terrible 
problems" with companies trying to deceive the FDA, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Since the stepped-up inspection drive began this summer, the FDA said, it has 
completed its checks at eight of the 20 top drug makers. 
</P>
<P>
No serious problems were found at four firms -- Martech, Mutual, Mylan and 
Roxanne. But Young said "clear evidence" of fraud was found at one firm, 
Quantum Pharmacics of Amityville, N.Y., and signs of possible fraud were turned 
up at the three other firms, which were not identified.

BRITISH FIRM TO ACQUIRE DUNKIN' DONUTS

Two months after rejecting a hostile takeover bid from a Canadian group, 
Dunkin' Donuts said today it reached a $325-million agreement for acquisition 
by a British food and drink corporate giant. 
</P>
<P>
Under the definitive agreement, Allied-Lyons PLC will acquire outstanding 
shares of the coffee and doughnut shop franchiser's common stock with a cash 
tender offer at $47.25 per share on or before Nov. 24. Shearson Lehman Hutton 
Inc. will act as dealer manager for the offer. 
</P>
<P>
Trading over the counter on the New York Stock Exchange just after the market 
opened today, Dunkin' Donuts stock was up 37.5 cents to $46.875. 
</P>
<P>
"The combination with Allied-Lyons will clearly strengthen our position as the 
world's largest coffee and doughnut chain. We look forward to building upon our 
accomplishments as part of the Allied-Lyons team," said Dunkin' Donuts Board 
Chairman Robert M. Rosenberg. 
</P>
<P>
The two companies said the total value of the transaction is about $325 
million. The agreement is subject to Allied-Lyons' acquisition of at least 75% 
of the outstanding shares. In connection with the execution of the merger 
agreement, Dunkin' Donuts agreed to pay Allied-Lyons a $7 million termination 
fee under certain conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Allied-Lyons, based in Britain, primarily owns and operates drink and food 
businesses. Its holdings include Baskin-Robbins franchised ice cream stores, 
Tetley Inc., DCA Food Industries and Hiram-Walker-Allied Vintners, the wine and 
spirits company which markets Kahlua, Ballantines, Courvoisier, Canadian Club 
and Tia Maria. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Dunkin' Donuts rejected a $45-per-share hostile takeover bid from 
DD Acquisitions of Toronto which valued the company at about $310 million.

A Los Angeles woman who said she nearly died from an unwanted spray of perfume 
in Bloomingdale's has accepted a $75,000 settlement of her assault lawsuit, her 
lawyer said today. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Martorano was hospitalized with "respiratory distress" and was "close 
to death" three days after a salesperson at the department store spritzed her 
with perfume April 30, 1984, said her lawyer, Michael Gluck. 
</P>
<P>
Martorano, 36, said she has a long history of asthma and allergies to perfume, 
horses, trees, ragweed and dust. She said her first asthma attack in eight 
years was triggered by the unwanted spray. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard somebody behind me," she said in court papers. "I turned around, and 
the next thing I knew I was sprayed. My nose started to burn and my eyes 
started to tear." 
</P>
<P>
Gluck said Martorano was in New York Hospital for 11 days and ran up $12,000 in 
medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
Martorano was an office administrator for a New York law firm when she was 
spritzed and now works for a Los Angeles law firm, Gluck said.

British inflation dipped slightly to 7.3% in October, but the fall was lower 
than expected and the underlying trend was still upward, the government said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Economists had forecast the yearly rate would fall to 6.9% from 7.6% in 
September as a rise in mortgage rates in October, 1988, dropped out of the 
reckoning. 
</P>
<P>
But the Central Statistical Office said this was offset by increases in the 
cost of food, clothing and footwear. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury said the underlying rate of inflation, excluding home loan 
repayments from the index, showed a rise to 6.1% in October against 5.8% the 
previous month. That rise was the biggest in 6 1/2 years.

Nearly 38,000 counterfeit audio cassette tapes were found and four suspects 
were arrested Thursday in East Los Angeles, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The tapes and four suspects were found about 6 p.m. in a garage behind the 
house at 3709 E. Fourth St., Sheriff's Deputy Van Mosley said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies had a warrant for one of the suspects, Ysidro Flores, 39, and received 
an anonymous tip that he was at the house, Mosley said. 
</P>
<P>
Two other men and a woman were found with Flores in the garage, along with 
37,750 counterfeit tapes with a combined value of more than $278,000, Mosley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
An official from the Assn. of Latin American Record Manufacturers helped 
deputies confirm that the tapes were counterfeit copies of works by Latin and 
U.S. artists, Mosley said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Flores, deputies arrested Isaias Cano, 27; Refindo Reyes, 26, and Juana 
Perez, 26. All four were booked for possession of counterfeit tapes and were 
being held at the East Los Angeles sheriff's station on $5,000 bail each, 
Mosley said.

DALY'S 'GYPSY' NEEDS MORE FIRE IN HER SONGS

Is everything still coming up roses for "Gypsy," 30 years after the Jule 
Styne-Arthur Laurents-Stephen Sondheim musical first opened on Broadway? 
</P>
<P>
Well, almost. For those needing proof, the evidence is on display at the St. 
James Theater, where a revival opened Thursday after a long national tour. (It 
stopped in Los Angeles last summer.) For much of the evening, the production 
reaffirms the show's reputation as one of the greatest American musical 
comedies. 
</P>
<P>
The only question about any major Broadway revival is how it compares to the 
original, and with 'Gypsy,' it is who plays Rose, the greedy, grasping Gorgon 
of a mother whose little girl, Louise, grows up to become the stripper Gypsy 
Rose Lee. 
</P>
<P>
Tyne Daly, best known as the star of television's "Cagney and Lacey," has taken 
up the challenge. And she has succeeded -- with one drawback. 
</P>
<P>
The woman is a terrific actress and even has a few Mermanesque qualities. She 
talks tough and can bully with the best of them in the scenes when she tries to 
find jobs in vaudeville for her daughters, Baby June and Louise. 
</P>
<P>
But any performer playing Rose must do more than act. Much of Rose's fierceness 
and determination is expressed in song. Daly gets through her three star 
numbers adequately, but one misses the vocal fireworks that make them 
terrifying hymns of self-delusion and overconfidence.

ITALY NAMED OWNER OF 'GARDENER'

A court ruled Thursday that the Italian government has ownership rights to Van 
Gogh's masterpiece "The Gardener," thus preventing its sale to the Peggy 
Guggenheim Collection in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ruling by the administrative court of the province of Lazio, the 1889 
oil painting valued at $8.5 million will remain at the National Gallery of 
Modern Art in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
The ownership dispute dates to 1977 when Ernst Beyeler, an art collector from 
Basel, Switzerland, bought the painting for 600 million lire -- about $1 
million then -- from an Italian nobleman. 
</P>
<P>
The painting remained in Italian museums, and Beyeler tried to sell it last 
year to the Guggenheim Collection, one of the most renowned modern art 
galleries in Europe. The sale price was $8.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian Culture Ministry, however, blocked the sale. It charged Beyeler's 
1977 purchase of the painting was illegal, saying it was bought in another 
person's name. The ministry said that Beyeler was not the legal owner and that 
the government had rights to the painting. 
</P>
<P>
Beyeler took the case to court, which ruled against him Thursday. The court 
will announce the reasons for its ruling later. 
</P>
<P>
Guggenheim officials were not involved in the court case.

As the child of the outspoken Vanessa Redgrave, Natasha Richardson found the 
easiest thing was to keep her opinions to herself, steering clear of the 
controversy that surrounded her mother. 
</P>
<P>
But with an increasing profile of her own that may have to change, the 
26-year-old actress says in the December issue of Mademoiselle. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard growing up and seeing all this press against your mother," 
Richardson said. "I'd be sitting next to a girl in chemistry, and she'd say, 
'Your mother's a commie.' " 
</P>
<P>
But her roles in "Fat Man and Little Boy," which deals with the making of the 
atomic bomb, and in "The Handmaid's Tale," about a make-believe society that 
executes women who have abortions, have forced Richardson to speak out. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a feminist in any way at all, at all. But the abortion issue is 
different. When men say that women shouldn't be allowed to choose. . . . It 
just makes my blood boil," said the actress, whose father is director Tony 
Richardson.

EAST GERMANS ANGERED BY REPORTS OF ATHLETES' PERKS

<P>
East Germans have gone from cheering to loathing top athletes after reports of 
special privileges appeared in the country's media. 
</P>
<P>
Citing a report by the East Berlin-based radio station Berliner Rundfunk, the 
Bild newspaper said today that unknown persons had "demolished world champion 
swimmer Heike Friederich's car." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the tires on ice speed skater Constanze Moser's car were slit, and 
world champion cyclist Uwe Ampler was purposely knocked from his racing bike 
during training, Bild said. 
</P>
<P>
"First Adored, Now Hated," Bild said in the story's headline. The report did 
not say where in East Germany the attacks against the athletes took place. 
</P>
<P>
Bild said the incidents occurred after East German news reports of huge gifts 
given to sports figures, including swimming star Kristin Otto and Katarina 
Witt, the Olympic and world figure skating champion. 
</P>
<P>
Otto reportedly was given more than $30,000 for winning six gold medals at the 
Seoul Olympics, and Witt received her own villa, Bild said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, East Germany's state-run youth newspaper Junge Welt (Young World) 
criticized the Communist country's sports program as "wasting millions in 
foreign exchange" in a blind hunt for medals. 
</P>
<P>
Junge Welt suggested that East Germany consider allowing its top sports figures 
to earn money through commercialization to help fight the country's deep 
economic crisis and not put the burden of supporting them "on the backs of our 
population."

A delegation from Minnesota is trying to persuade the NCAA to move the 1993 
College World Series from Omaha, the event's home the last 42 years, to the 
Metrodome. 
</P>
<P>
A seven-man delegation representing the University of Minnesota, the Metrodome 
and the Minnesota Twins made the presentation earlier this week in Kansas City, 
Mo. 
</P>
<P>
"No bid was submitted, nor was one requested. It was just a discussion to see 
what's available and a good opportunity to visit," said Dennis Poppe, NCAA 
director of championships. 
</P>
<P>
University of Minnesota men's Athletic Director Rick Bay, who led the 
delegation, said he is sensitive to the College World Series' close ties to 
Omaha, where 186,000 people attended the event last June. "It's a great 
environment, almost a 'Field of Dreams' atmosphere," Bay said. "We aren't 
trying to convince the NCAA to move it out of Omaha, but if it is moved, it 
only makes sense to go to a higher level." 
</P>
<P>
The College World Series is committed to Omaha until 1992.

Free agent Nick Esasky of the Boston Red Sox today signed a three-year contract 
with the Atlanta Braves, a team that had been wanting the first baseman for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"He's going to be a great addition to our ball club and our rise to the top," 
vice president and general manager Bobby Cox said at a news conference 
announcing the signing. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a decision that was long coming," said Esasky, a Florida native who 
lives with his wife and three children in Marietta, Ga., a suburb north of 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there was talk for many years of me coming here," Esasky said. "It 
never seemed to work out. I'm totally excited about coming here and playing." 
</P>
<P>
Esasky became one of the top prizes among this year's free agent crop after 
batting .277 with 30 home runs and 108 RBIs for the Red Sox last season. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the contract were not disclosed, but it was believed to be a package 
worth $5.7 million over the three years -- a $1.1 million signing bonus and 
salaries of $800,000 next season, $1.8 million in 1991 and $2 million in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Esasky ranked third in the American League in RBIs and fifth in home runs. He 
was fourth in slugging percentage at .500, sixth in extra-base hits with 61 and 
seventh in total bases with 282 in his first AL season. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody could be any happier than me," Braves manager Russ Nixon said. "Nick 
and I go back quite a ways." 
</P>
<P>
Esasky made his major league debut with Cincinnati in 1983 when Nixon was 
managing the Reds.

Strom recently severed his connections with the Dodgers rather than accept an

his home in San Diego. "I felt it was in my best interests not to go to

DINNER TO HONOR DOMINGUEZ RANCH ADOBE CURATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Father Patrick McPolin, curator since 1974 of the Dominguez Ranch Adobe, will 
be honored at a $100-a-plate testimonial dinner and celebrity show Sunday by 
the Dominguez-Carson chapter of Rotary Club. The event will be held at the 
Carson Community Center and will headline entertainers Danny Thomas and Vikki 
Carr. Proceeds will be used to repair structural damage to the adobe. 
</P>
<P>
The adobe, designated a historical state and national landmark, is at 18137 S. 
Alameda St., Compton, on property that was once part of a 75,000-acre rancho 
founded by Juan Jose Dominguez. 
</P>
<P>
The Dominguez Ranch Adobe was built by Manuel Dominguez, who inherited the 
property from his uncle in 1826. The adobe was owned by the Dominguez family 
until 1922, when it was given to the Claretian missionaries. Father Pat, as 
McPolin is known, came to the adobe in 1936 as a student of the Claretian 
seminary. When the school closed in 1974, he took charge of the house's 
restoration.

EUROPEAN STARLING 
</P>
<P>
(Sturnus vulgaris) 
</P>
<P>
Description: Adult in breeding plumage is iridescent black with a yellow bill. 
In fresh fall plumage, feathers are tipped with white and buff, giving an 
overall speckled appearance; bill becomes brownish. Short, square tail, stocky 
body, and short, broad-based pointed wings that appear pale gray from below. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Mostly open fields, woodland, suburbia and cities. 
</P>
<P>
Diet: Other inverts and berries. 
</P>
<P>
Displays: Courting male 
</P>
<P>
adopts variety of postures while vocalizing; highest intensity includes 
flailing wings in hunched stance. 
</P>
<P>
Nest: In any handy cavity; slovenly cup of grass, twigs, forbs, rootlets and 
straw. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs: Pale bluish or greenish white, marked with browns. 
</P>
<P>
Natural history notes: Starlings were introduced in New York City's Central 
Park one hundred years ago and quickly spread across the continent. Bold and 
aggressive, it often competes successfully with native species for nest holes. 
Varied call notes include squeaks, warbles, chirps and twittering; also 
imitates the songs of other species. Outside of nesting season, starlings are 
usually seen in large flocks, sometimes in company with grackles and 
blackbirds. Within one century, the 60 starlings introduced to North America 
have increased to over 200 million. 
</P>
<P>

to get information on the breeding bird atlas (now in its fifth and final 
year), call Sea and Sage Audubon Society member Nancy Kenyon, (714) 786-3160.
