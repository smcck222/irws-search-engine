<P>
A federal program to test government workers suspected of off-duty drug use was 
put in jeopardy by a court decision that struck down similar checks of 
Agriculture Department employees. The ruling by a three-judge panel of the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said "the government has 
not produced evidence that might establish a relationship between off-the-job 
drug use and government efficiency . . . " The ruling is the first by a federal 
appellate court on the government's use of drug tests. The court ruled also, in 
a case involving White House employees, that government officials with access 
to secret information may be subject to random drug testing along with 
officials with top secret clearances.

<P>
Sudden heart rejection caused the death this week of 13-year-old Stormie Jones 
six years after she became the world's first heart-liver transplant recipient, 
doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
The autopsy results surprised Stormie's doctors at Children's Hospital in 
Pittsburgh, Pa., who said that heart rejection was rare so many years after a 
transplant. The girl needed the transplant because a rare genetic disorder 
prevented her body from processing cholesterol. She is to be buried today in 
her hometown in White Settlement, Tex.

CITY MAY OK PLAN THAT WOULD ALLOW NEW HOUSING; 
</P>
<P>
VENTURA: THE PROPOSAL WOULD REPLACE A MORATORIUM ON BUILDING PERMITS. THE 
LIMITS OF 185 UNITS A YEAR REFLECT THE SLOW-GROWTH BENT OF THE COUNCIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura City Council is expected to replace the current moratorium on 
building permits with a program that will allow 185 new units a year, city 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But if adopted as expected Nov. 26, the Residential Growth Management Program 
will drastically reduce the number of new units that had been allowed in the 
past decade and reflect the slow-growth bent of the new City Council majority 
that was swept into office in November, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years, Ventura averaged about 560 units a year, Community 
Development Director Everett Millais said. 
</P>
<P>
Vice Mayor Donald Villeneuve, who heads the city's housing subcommittee, said 
he was confident that the plan would be adopted when the council votes on it 
Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
"If we go much lower, we'd be standing still," he said. "I think this plan is 
the best way to control growth while maintaining a commercially viable city." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, while the new growth plan will allow developers to file building 
plans with the city, no new construction will be allowed until the city 
overcomes its water shortage emergency, Millais said. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium on filing applications was adopted in January after city 
officials determined that unless the number of building allocations was 
reduced, the city would exceed a General Plan population limit of 102,000 by 
the year 2000. This moratorium will end when the new growth management plan is 
adopted. 
</P>
<P>
In March, the city declared a water emergency and banned all new water hookups 
until the city finds new water sources. The ban on water hookups will remain in 
effect after the growth-management program is adopted, and no new construction 
will be allowed until the ban is lifted, Millais said. 
</P>
<P>
In adopting the growth plan, however, the city would allow developers to begin 
the process of obtaining building permits, which normally takes about 18 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Millais said such a decision would justifiably raise expectations among 
developers that new construction will be allowed in the city in the foreseeable 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"By going forward with this plan, the city will be putting developers in the 
hopper with the expectation that they will be allowed to build again," Millais 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The water emergency was not adopted as a growth-control measure," Millais 
said. "The RGMP will become the city's instrument to control growth." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Holmes, a spokesman for the Ventura Building Industry Assn., said 
developers had mixed feelings about the growth plan. While they would be happy 
to be able to file for building applications again, they were disappointed with 
the low number of new units the city would allow. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a great deal of concern that we will be allowed less than a couple of 
hundred units a year," Holmes said. He said the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments has determined that to meet its fair share of the region's housing 
needs, Ventura should allow about 770 new units per year. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that the city could accommodate that much growth if the 
council wanted to provide affordable housing to its residents," Holmes said. He 
said the city's refusal to build more housing has helped make Ventura one of 
the most expensive places to live in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Gary Tuttle disagreed with Holmes' assessment of the city's 
capability to absorb more housing units. The water crisis, he said, had proven 
that the city doesn't even have enough resources to meet the needs of its 
existing population. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not even sure that the city can accommodate the numbers of units proposed 
in the RGMP," he said.

CSU REJECTS TAYLOR RANCH AS CAMPUS SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After three years of community squabbling over whether California State 
University should build a campus at the Taylor Ranch west of Ventura, 
university officials on Friday put the site to final rest. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State trustees meeting in Oxnard eliminated the hillside bluff with an 
ocean view in favor of three less controversial locations: one west of 
Camarillo, one southeast of Oxnard and one northeast of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
However, the property northeast of Ventura could prove infeasible because the 
Ventura City Council has not supported a campus near the city and some 
residents are opposed, Cal State Vice Chancellor John M. Smart said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have at least two sites that are acquirable," Smart said, referring 
to property owned by the Duntley Trust and Chaffee family west of Camarillo and 
property southeast of Oxnard owned by the Donlon family and others. 
</P>
<P>
"But I don't know about the Ventura site," he said, adding that it's not a 
matter of whether the owners are willing to sell but of whether the city wants 
a university campus. The Ventura site is owned by several interests, including 
the Pinkerton family. 
</P>
<P>
The councils in Oxnard and Camarillo have said they would welcome the 
university to their cities and vowed to help provide services to a new campus. 
The Ventura City Council has rejected all opportunities to endorse a site near 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees may consider a fourth site northwest of Oxnard on 1,100 acres of 
McGrath family property east of Harbor Boulevard and straddling Gonzales Road. 
But trustees left it up to an environmental consultant to decide whether there 
are 200 buildable acres on the property. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the land north of Gonzales Road is in the Santa Clara River flood plain 
and the portion south of the road is under the flight path of the Oxnard 
Airport, consultants said. Building on the site could require extensive levee 
work, building a concrete channel for the river or moving Gonzales Road, 
consultant Brian Boxer said. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees will decide at their Nov. 27 meeting whether to include the land among 
the final sites to be studied in-depth in environmental reports. 
</P>
<P>
Consultants will meet with community members again in January to set the scope 
of the environmental reports. Smart said he hoped that trustees would pick a 
final site in May or June. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees, who met in Oxnard as a five-member ad hoc committee of the full 
board of trustees, decided on the four sites after a four-hour morning session 
held by a 35-member citizens advisory panel. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, which has been meeting for six months to determine which sites would 
be most acceptable to residents countywide, had recommended that Taylor Ranch 
be included in the final study, along with the Donlon, Duntley/Chaffee and 
northeast Ventura properties. 
</P>
<P>
But trustees sent the recommendations back to the committee, citing the Taylor 
Ranch owners' refusal to sell their property, community opposition and division 
on the Ventura City Council. On Friday, no support was left for the Taylor 
Ranch on the advisory committee, with one lone appeal coming from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"The only site that is not in an agriculture greenbelt or being actively 
pursued for agriculture purposes is the Taylor Ranch," said Ventura Mayor 
Richard Francis, who spoke as an individual and not as a city representative. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State chose Taylor Ranch in 1986 as its preferred site. The state abandoned 
that plan in June after the owners said they would not sell, community 
opposition developed and the Ventura City Council split over whether to welcome 
the university to the city. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, in addition to settling on the three final sites and the possible 
fourth site, the trustees decided to confine the site northeast of Ventura to 
land south of Foothill Road. Trustees had originally considered property both 
north and south of Foothill Road at the property called the Saticoy site. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees also decided Friday to exclude from consideration property across from 
the Ventura Harbor owned by the Lusk Co. and McLaughlin family. That property, 
which was the university's first choice before the Taylor Ranch emerged as a 
possible site, met strong opposition in 1986 and again Friday from homeowners 
in the Ventura Keys. In addition, the site lacks support from the Ventura City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees were concerned about the Duntley/Chaffee property's location next to 
the California Youth Authority west of Camarillo, where young offenders are 
incarcerated for crimes ranging from burglary to forcible rape and murder. 
About 12% of the boys and 16% of the girls are serving time at the facility for 
homicide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Final Cal State University Sites 
</P>
<P>
1. Saticoy site: 353 acres of farmland south of Foothill Road between Wells and 
Kimball roads northeast of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
2. Duntley/ Chaffee property: 589 acres east of Central Avenue and south of 
Santa Clara Avenue west of Camarillo and next to the California Youth Authority 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
3. Donlon property: 300 acres south of Wooley Road between Rose and Rice 
avenues south of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
4. (Possible additional site) McGrath property: 1,100 acres straddling Gonzales 
Road betweenHarbor Boulevard and Victoria Avenue in northwest Oxnard. This site 
will be considered only if environmental consultants find 200 buildable acres.

AL MARTINEZ: A WALK IN THE PARK WITH JACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
W.C. Fields was often heard to remark that he much preferred whiskey to dogs. 
"Alcohol," he'd observe, "can take care of itself, which is more than you can 
say for a dog." 
</P>
<P>
While I am not suggesting that you walk your whiskey, and not your dog, on a 
pleasant Sunday afternoon, the idea has merit in view of the turmoil 
surrounding Topanga State Park. 
</P>
<P>
I am not a whiskey man myself, but I have it on good authority that whiskey, 
while it might embrace other sins, does not bark or chase squirrels, which are 
among the chief objections to dogs in parks. 
</P>
<P>
I am not intending to imply, by the way, that booze is a perfect companion. For 
those who are considering trading their schnauzer for a bottle of Jack Daniels, 
I hasten to say it wasn't a dog that killed W.C. Fields. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings me, however circuitously, to the case of Flavia Potenza, a 
community activist locked in combat with the state Department of Parks and 
Recreation. 
</P>
<P>
The fight is not over whiskey, but over her right to walk Ben, Rocky and Willow 
in Topanga State Park, on whose fringes she abides. Dogs, however loving, are 
not allowed on park trails. 
</P>
<P>
Flavia has been cited five times in the past few months, paid $130 in fines and 
is on two years' probation for violating this rule, but swears she will fight 
on. 
</P>
<P>
"If necessary," she told me the other day, "I'll go to jail for my dogs." 
</P>
<P>
Oh, my. 
</P>
<P>
There are roughly 30 million dogs in the United States, most of which live and 
love in Topanga Canyon. Their utter lack of social grace is a continuing 
subject for debate. 
</P>
<P>
The latest uproar concerns Flavia's contention that one ought to be able to 
walk one's leashed dogs on a fire trail and not be harassed by park rangers 
while doing so. 
</P>
<P>
In one instance, Flavia says, a ranger stood outside her house shouting for her 
to come out and be cited for having earlier violated the no-dog rule. 
Amazingly, Flavia complied and was, indeed, cited. 
</P>
<P>
She is, she will tell you, a most cooperative person who is concerned with her 
community, in whose boundaries the park is situated. 
</P>
<P>
As proof, she offers a list of activities that include her founding stewardship 
of the sprightly Topanga Messenger, and a character reference from her 
landlady, which I find the most impressive credential of all. 
</P>
<P>
Most landladies would rather rent a cell on Death Row than utter a positive 
word about a tenant. 
</P>
<P>
Flavia, we must therefore assume, is the kind of person even a landlady can 
love. 
</P>
<P>
Then why, I hear you cry, is she the center of a controversy that threatens 
civil war in Topanga? Simply put, not everyone prefers dogs to whiskey. 
</P>
<P>
In more complicated terms, she feels targeted by the system, is angry that she 
can't walk her dogs on the park trails and is annoyed that letters to park 
officials have gone unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm saying to them, 'Talk to me, for God's sake,' " she said the other day, 
her eyes flashing fire. She was wearing a sweat shirt with a cow on the front 
to indicate, one supposes, her otherwise serene and bucolic nature. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm saying why not establish a volunteer dog patrol to guarantee they're kept 
on leashes and are cleaned up after?" 
</P>
<P>
I asked this of park personnel who replied, in effect, that if you let a dog on 
a trail today, someone's going to want to walk an elephant on a trail tomorrow. 
You've got to draw the line somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Dogs, they point out, intimidate hikers, chase small animals, bring in diseases 
and leave do-do on the trails, among other unpleasantries. 
</P>
<P>
"If you allow them on a leash," one ranger said, "you can bet that they'll be 
off the leash when no one's looking." 
</P>
<P>
All points of view have been significantly aired on the pages of the Messenger 
in essays by Flavia and responses by those in disagreement with her stand. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe Ms. Potenza has been living in the company of canines a bit too long," 
one person wrote. Another letter began, "Who in the hell does Flavia Potenza 
think she is?" 
</P>
<P>
I hike the park trails occasionally, and accept without rancor the possibility 
of meeting dogs, coyotes, horses, rattlesnakes or time-locked, unregenerated 
hippies. 
</P>
<P>
I consider them all a part of the ecosystem. What I do not consider part of the 
system are rangers with guns and pickup trucks, and maniacs on mountain bikes 
rocketing down a fire trail at 30 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
My solution is simply to ban everyone and everything from the park, with the 
possible exception of me and my martini. I will sit on a knoll under a tree, 
sip a little glory and contemplate the barking of the crowd below, as the world 
rolls unnoticed into hell.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MISTRIAL CALLED IN ACTOR'S DRUNK DRIVING 
CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mistrial was declared in the drunk driving case of former "Taxi" co-star Jeff 
Conaway, who faced felony charges stemming from an accident that injured a 
bicyclist. 
</P>
<P>
Conaway, 40, of Hollywood Hills was ordered Thursday by Superior Court Judge 
Sara Radin to return to court in Santa Monica Dec. 3 for a pretrial conference. 
</P>
<P>
The jury deadlocked 8-4 in favor of acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say Conaway was driving drunk Feb. 23 when his Porsche, traveling 
at more than 60 m.p.h. on Santa Monica Boulevard, slammed into the back of 
Farid Farhan's bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
Farhan's leg was broken and he required 15 stitches on his head. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Lydia Delgadillo said two tests indicated the actor's 
blood-alcohol level at the time of the collision was 0.15% and 0.16%. The legal 
limit is 0.08%. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Anthony Brooklier contended that Farhan was struck by another 
vehicle.

The California Avocado Commission has offered to donate a new four-wheel drive 
pickup so the Ventura County Sheriff's Department can patrol avocado fields. 
</P>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors is expected to approve the commission's 
donation of the vehicle Tuesday, along with the purchase of police radio 
equipment, for a total of $37,883. 
</P>
<P>
Because of increased avocado thefts from fields, the commission has taken steps 
to help local law enforcement agencies in several Southern California counties. 
In Ventura County, the commission is providing up to $70,000 for increased law 
enforcement during 1990-1991. JANE HULSE

gnashed their terrible teeth, and rolled their terrible eyes" on the blacktop 
behind Richard Bard Elementary School, acting out Maurice Sendak's classic 
children's book, "Where the Wild Things Are." 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen classrooms, totaling 400 children from kindergarten through the sixth 
grade, each turned a book they have read into a parade or a skit Friday as the 
grand finale of their National Book Week activities. 
</P>
<P>
During the week, students listened to a poetry reading, wrote letters to U.S. 
troops stationed in Saudi Arabia, and congregated on the schoolyard lawn at 
lunch to hear stories read by parents. 
</P>
<P>
The week's activities "get the parents involved," which is one goal of the new 
literature-based curriculum in California public schools, said Sue Measures, a 
reading specialist. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, students began reading "really good literary works" rather than 
textbooks, said Principal Debbie DeSmeth. It was the first time the school 
participated in National Book Week, she said. 
</P>
<P>
In October, each classroom chose a book its students liked, then made costumes 
fashioned to look like story characters and practiced parading on the 
playground. The older grades selected from books they read as part of their 
curriculums; younger children had books read to them. 
</P>
<P>
"St. George and the Dragon," a folk tale retold by Margaret Hodges, was the 
story chosen for the parade by a third-grade class. 
</P>
<P>
In the re-enactment, children rolled out a cardboard palace built on a utility 
cart. A pint-sized prince with an aluminum-foil sword battled with a dragon -- 
another boy wearing a green and yellow felt suit and a huge green paper tail 
with black scales. 
</P>
<P>
The audience squealed with laughter as the narrator announced that the prince 
and a princess -- wearing a white satin dress -- married and lived happily ever 
after. 
</P>
<P>
Measures and DeSmeth were pleased that one class had chosen a non-fiction work 
as its favorite book. 
</P>
<P>
"Life Cycle of the Whale" "tells true facts about where they live, how they 
travel and what they eat," a second-grade narrator said of the book by Paula Z. 
Hogan. 
</P>
<P>
Besides sparking interest in books, the new reading curriculum attempts to 
integrate science, math and social studies into the reading program, DeSmeth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A group of first-graders wearing cat masks made of paper plates and yarn 
marched in a circle chanting from Wanda Gag's "Millions of Cats": "Cats here, 
cats there, cats and kittens everywhere. Hundreds of cats, thousands of cats, 
millions and billions and trillions of cats." KIM KASH

CLARIFYING ROAD'S ROUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to add my two cents worth to all of the discussion about the Bob 
Hope land swap which would trade 59 acres of National Park Service land for 
5,700 acres of land for preservation of open space, parkland and recreational 
areas. I understand that this would provide access to Jordan Ranch for the 
development of a PGA golf course and 750 houses. 
</P>
<P>
I happen to know a lot about the plan. And I know enough to know that the road 
proposed through the 59 acres does not go through the middle of the park as 
some people who oppose the exchange and the project have erroneously stated. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal allows for a two-lane road, part of it tunneled, which would, for 
the most part, only be used by residents. The road does not run through the 
middle of the park, only along the edge that is already adjacent to 
development, thus preserving surrounding ecologically sensitive areas. 
</P>
<P>
At the present time, there is no public access to the park. There is only a 
temporary easement through land owned by Potomac Investment Associates, the 
developer proposing to develop Jordan Ranch. If the land swap were successful, 
there would be a new entrance owned and operated by the Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
The input of all parties, including the general public, is always a valuable 
part of the negotiations. When the final decision is made it is called a 
"deal." And there is nothing sinister about it. 
</P>
<P>
But, what would be a crying shame is that so-called "grass-roots activists" who 
oppose this proposal continue pushing to the point that it falls through and 
the public at large loses an opportunity of the ages. 
</P>
<P>
I presume that those same activists will want to take the credit if this "deal" 
does not go through. I hope they are equally prepared to take the blame if the 
open space is lost forever to the general public.

HIDDEN HILLS TO SCRAP REDEVELOPMENT PANEL, SAYS IT SERVES NO USE; 
</P>
<P>
AGREEMENTS: THE AFFLUENT, GATED COMMUNITY ADMITS A MISTAKE. IT WILL DISBAND THE 
AGENCY IN DECEMBER AND RETURN A PORTION OF THE MONEY TO THE COUNTY. 
</P>

<P>
The Hidden Hills Redevelopment Agency -- the target of criticism and legal 
challenges since its inception six years ago -- will disband next month, the 
Hidden Hills city attorney said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The city had no use for a redevelopment agency," City Atty. Michael Jenkins 
said. "It was a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Under a tentative agreement with Los Angeles County, the city will dissolve the 
agency and return a portion of the redevelopment money it has received to the 
county, which will use the money to build low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
The city no longer wants the agency because under state law a portion of the 
redevelopment money it is collecting from the county must be spent for 
low-income housing inside the boundaries of Hidden Hills, a gated, affluent 
community of 2,000 residents. The requirement had infuriated many residents who 
did not want such housing in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The city created the agency in 1984 to raise money to build a storm drain along 
Long Valley Road. County officials, however, filed a lawsuit contending that 
the city was abusing state laws by declaring itself a redevelopment area, a 
designation usually reserved for blighted inner-city neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was dropped in 1988 after the city agreed to spend 20% of the 
redevelopment money on low-income housing and the county agreed to build the 
storm drain project. 
</P>
<P>
Some city officials then moved ahead with plans to use redevelopment money on a 
combined residential-commercial-office complex that would have included 
low-income housing. But residents objected when they learned that developer 
Danny Howard's proposal included a 46-unit apartment building for the elderly 
on city land outside its gates. The City Council failed to approve the project 
in the face of the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
In December, Howard filed a $10-million lawsuit against the city, contending he 
had lost money because Hidden Hills had reneged on an agreement to let him 
proceed with the project. The city agreed Thursday to pay Howard $1 million to 
settle that suit. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the agreement to disband the redevelopment agency, some of the money 
will pay for environmental studies and easements needed for construction of a 
storm drain. The remainder will be given to the county for affordable housing, 
Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy County Counsel Manuel A. Valenzuela Jr., who is working with Jenkins to 
dissolve the agency, said although the county has agreed to build the storm 
drain for Hidden Hills, the city will be responsible for buying easements and 
completing the necessary environmental studies. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins also said the city will try to relinquish jurisdiction over the 26 
acres it annexed from the county -- land on which Howard had planned to build 
the low-income housing and an office building and retail center.

Manny Mota, coach and former player for the Los Angeles Dodgers, will hold two 
free batting clinics today for Simi Valley youths. 
</P>
<P>
The clinics are sponsored by a local drug prevention organization called 
Baseballers Against Drugs (BAD). 
</P>
<P>
Boys and girls between the ages of 5 and 12 are invited to participate, said 
Jim Dantona, founder and president of BAD. The first clinic will be held at the 
Batting Net, 1667 Royal Ave., from 1 to 2:30 p.m., and the second will be at 
the Simi Valley Batting Cages, 2019 Donville Ave., between 3 and 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Mota will be joined by two of his sons, Domingo and Jose, both minor league 
ballplayers, in instructing the youths on hitting and fielding techniques, 
Dantona said. 
</P>
<P>
Mota will also pass out autographed pictures, baseball caps and other items.

Students at Simi Elementary School won't have any trouble finding Texas or 
Florida on the map. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, even Rhode Island, the smallest state in the country, would be 
difficult to miss on the new 45-by-26-foot map of the United States painted on 
the school's playground over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Principal Leslie Frank said the map was painted by parents, students and 
teachers to celebrate National Geography Week. 
</P>
<P>
The map, which Frank also worked on, took about 10 hours to complete, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank said the map will be used as a learning tool for students, who can use 
multicolored chalk or watercolors to fill in the names of the capitals and 
cities of each state as well as mountain ranges and other landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
She said students will be encouraged to create games using the map and what 
they have learned from their geography lessons. CARLOS V. LOZANO

Willie London wanted to sell his well-kept, three-bedroom Lynwood home and move 
to a better neighborhood. But who would want to buy a house near areas plagued 
with gangs and crime, particularly in a depressed real estate market? He set 
the price at $172,000 and prayed. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time, a professor at a Long Beach college put his beachfront 
condominium penthouse up for sale. The asking price: $430,000. A steal, brokers 
said, for such a gem. 
</P>
<P>
The professor, who asked that his name not be used, received not one offer in 
four months. 
</P>
<P>
Willie London sold his house in a week. 
</P>
<P>
One word explains both scenarios: affordability. 
</P>
<P>
Among the hottest areas for selling property right now are those with the 
reputation -- rightly or wrongly -- of being the worst places to live. 
</P>
<P>
Families are buying where they can afford to: Compton, Lynwood, South-Central 
Los Angeles, Willowbrook, Watts and parts of Long Beach, East Los Angeles, 
Carson, Inglewood and South Gate. In many cases, buyers choose to cope with 
potential neighborhood problems rather than sacrifice dreams of home ownership. 
</P>
<P>
More prosperous areas of Long Beach and Southeast Los Angeles County, on the 
other hand, are suffering from the same malaise affecting real estate 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"We handle Compton and Lynwood," said LeFrancis Arnold, president of Century 21 
Arrow Realty in Lynwood. "It's a good market. The things I'm seeing at a 
national level and in the Southern California area have not affected our market 
as negatively as it has others." 
</P>
<P>
Of about 100 Los Angeles County branch offices in his district, Arnold's is 
running third in total transactions and eighth in commission dollars earned, 
despite the smaller commissions that come with less expensive properties. Other 
Century 21 offices that serve part of the same area also are faring well. 
</P>
<P>
"My average sales price is the lowest of all the Century 21 offices in the 
region," Arnold said. "The average sales price for this office last year was 
$115,000." 
</P>
<P>
Some of this activity in less prosperous areas involves purchases in gated 
communities or townhouses with security systems. But the rest of it happens in 
old, established neighborhoods prejudged to be in decline. 
</P>
<P>
Market conditions could reverse that. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to see a change in some of those neighborhoods," said Earl 
Bonawitz, director of marketing and training for one of Century 21's regional 
offices. "You're going to see them cleaned up. You're going to see pride of 
ownership coming into some of those neighborhoods that you haven't seen in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
"For a while it was all non-owner-occupied properties being bought and sold. 
Now you're seeing people buy those properties who want to live in them." 
</P>
<P>
Said real estate agent Arnold: "You can get a beautiful home in Lynwood for 
under $200,000, three or four bedrooms, 5,000-square-foot lot, sometimes a 
pool. It's the same with Compton." 
</P>
<P>
For better or worse, the active low-end market has pushed prices up in that 
category. "Our average sales price is about $13,000 higher this year than last 
year," Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, properties in Beverly Hills are selling, on average, for more than 
a million dollars below their listed prices and staying on the market an 
average of 131 days, according to a recent study by Jon Douglas Co., a realty 
firm.

<P>
MASSIVE MARIJUANA FARM IS DISCOVERED IN UNDERGROUND VAULT NORTH OF LANCASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three men were arrested and more than 6,000 marijuana plants seized from a 
massive underground bunker north of Lancaster in what authorities Friday said 
was the largest such operation ever uncovered in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities estimated that the high-desert site discovered Thursday produced 
about 24,000 marijuana plants a year that, when harvested, could bring an 
estimated $75 million to $150 million a year on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies and federal Drug Enforcement Agency agents unexpectedly 
stumbled onto the 7,000-square-foot bunker -- complete with diesel-powered 
lights and ventilation -- while searching a nearby house. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they went to the house after finding an $800 utility bill, 
indicating excessive energy use, during their investigation of a related case 
in Arizona. The bill, found when deputies served a search warrant at an 
Antelope Valley location, apparently was issued before the site's diesel 
generator was working. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the most incredible thing you'll ever see in your life," said Capt. Larry 
Waldie, commander of the sheriff's narcotics bureau. "We've never seen anything 
quite as sophisticated as this." Waldie estimated that the site on Avenue E 
near 40th Street East had been operating for two years. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies said the site apparently represented a major growing and distribution 
point for marijuana in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they believe the farm was run by the same people who were 
involved with operating two similar underground sites near Bullhead City, 
Ariz., that DEA agents raided Oct. 30, resulting in seven arrests. 
</P>
<P>
The bunker had been dug out under a more than foot-thick concrete ceiling. The 
thickness of the concrete was an apparent attempt to shield the operation from 
infrared sensing equipment which could detect heat from lamps used to supply 
the plants with light. The plants were growing wall-to-wall in pots under about 
142 generator-powered lamps. 
</P>
<P>
A trapdoor inside a back building led to the vault, which was divided into 
three rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Waldie estimated that the underground operation cost more than $1 million to 
build and equip. Deputies who went there following up a lead Thursday afternoon 
found a surveillance camera monitoring the site. No money, weapons or large 
quantities of harvested marijuana were found. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies arrested two caretakers at the desert ranch house without incident. 
Both were being held Friday at the Lancaster sheriff's station on $5-million 
bail each and face arraignment Monday on felony drug cultivation charges. They 
were identified as Calvin G. James, 38, of Garden Grove and Ronald L. Podratz, 
42, of Alpine in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Another man described by investigators as a top figure in both the Lancaster 
and Arizona operations surrendered Thursday at the Lancaster sheriff's station 
and faces federal charges in Arizona of conspiracy to distribute marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators identified him as Frank E. Gegax, 48, of Lancaster, owner of KMG 
Construction Inc. in Lancaster. DEA agents served federal search warrants 
Thursday at Gegax's residence and business and said they recovered nearly 
$50,000 in cash from the business. 
</P>
<P>
A DEA spokesman in Los Angeles said two of Gegax's relatives -- Kathleen Gegax 
and Michael Gegax, apparently his wife and brother -- were among the seven 
people arrested in Arizona. One underground location there had about 10,000 
plants, the other about 5,000, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies also are looking for an Antelope Valley father and son in connection 
with the case. The son, identified as Richard F. Yerger, 28, was listed as the 
owner of the Lancaster-area site. Officials said his father, Richard E. Yerger, 
60, may also be involved. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies said the house, apparently built without proper permits, 
probably would be demolished. Deputies said the 10-acre site, purchased by the 
younger Yerger in 1986 for about $55,000 according to real estate records, 
could be sold as drug forfeiture property.

AROUND THE VALLEY: NEW CLOTHES FOR TATTERED LIVES

<P>
The children stare from the other side of the bars. 
</P>
<P>
The security gate opens and Albert and Jennifer Kwan, ages 7 and 8, follow 
their school counselor into a small house in a faded part of Hollywood, 
sticking close together. 
</P>
<P>
Albert and Jennifer don't completely understand why it's hard for their parents 
to buy them clothes for school or why they are not allowed to play outside 
their house in East Los Angeles. Or why last month, while the Kwan family sat 
watching television, a random bullet fired by a teen-age gangster in the street 
crashed through the living room and wounded Grace Kwan, 10. 
</P>
<P>
"She got shot," Albert says, his helmet of black hair nodding, empty spaces 
showing between clenched baby teeth. 
</P>
<P>
Albert and Jennifer go to John F. Kennedy Elementary School; they say the name 
of the school in unison when asked. They understand this: They have left school 
today to come to this cheerful room decorated with giant Disney characters, 
where a group of women are going to give them new clothes. 
</P>
<P>
As Albert tries on a button-down shirt and gray slacks, his expression in the 
mirror sums up what Operation Schoolbell is about. 
</P>
<P>
Each day during the school year, a group of San Fernando Valley housewives in 
jeans and sweat shirts drop off their children at school and head to Operation 
Schoolbell headquarters. The 24-year-old charity gives clothes to needy 
students who are referred by social workers from throughout the Los Angeles 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Funding comes from an annual Christmas benefit and donations. 
</P>
<P>
"For some of the kids it's the first time they've had new clothes," volunteer 
Janna Cooley says. 
</P>
<P>
It's one thing to learn about the urban American Third World from headlines. 
It's another to pick out gym shoes for a boy who has to miss school because he 
shares shoes with his brother, to scrounge a prom tuxedo for a teen-ager who 
later gets shot by gang members, to contract lice from a hug. 
</P>
<P>
The do-good/feel-good atmosphere at Operation Schoolbell can be a little 
overwhelming. But on the whole, it's an atmosphere in which a visitor's 
cynicism fades rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
And the volunteers' street sense has grown. They are no longer shocked when 
they hear that some parents sell the "hygiene kits" of soap and toothbrushes 
the program gives to each child. 
</P>
<P>
Just because people are poor doesn't mean they are going to be uniformly noble 
and self-sacrificing. That's about as misguided as expecting them to be 
uniformly dishonest and lazy. Learning to spot a hustle is an unfortunate but 
inherent part of the work. 
</P>

"Yes, we get taken for a ride sometimes," volunteer Stacey Hubert says. "But 
that's all right. The need is there." 
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 children received packages last year. The standard package also 
includes a new outfit consisting of jeans and a shirt (purchased from 
wholesalers), a sweat suit, socks and underwear. 
</P>
<P>
On top of that, children get to pick out used clothes as available, many of 
them top-of-the-line designer items discarded by the children of volunteers. 
Volunteers say they bring their children from the San Fernando Valley on 
occasion so they can help out and learn what parents are talking about when 
they grumble about kids realizing how good they have it at home. 
</P>
<P>
In the fitting room, 10-year-old Eberardo Castaneda removes tattered black 
Nikes, revealing discolored maroon socks. Eberardo has close-cropped hair and 
the kind of instinctive, engaging humor and good manners that make you want to 
smack the first obnoxious rich kid you see. 
</P>
<P>
Eberardo speaks in Spanish and English: His family lives in a two-bedroom 
apartment in Bell; there are 14 kids and his two oldest sisters have babies, 
which makes 17 in the family counting his mother. 
</P>
<P>
On the Castanedas' information form for the program, next to the space for the 
whereabouts of their father is the word "Unknown." 
</P>
<P>
Eberardo's three younger sisters have the dark eyes of Renaissance angels. 
Volunteers hover around tiny Griselda, 5, who tries on a pink down coat to the 
amusement of Sandi, 8. Nine-year-old Rosario crouches before a sumptuous 
three-story dollhouse, a castoff from a suburban household where reality more 
closely resembles such toys. 
</P>
<P>
On the way out, each child gets a toy and a book. Eberardo scrutinizes a 
handful of plastic creatures in space suits from a well-stocked shelf. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to decide which one to take," he says in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
He grins when he is told to take all five. 
</P>
<P>
The Kwans take their turn, and Jennifer selects a yo-yo for her older sister. 
Grace has recovered rapidly from surgery to remove the bullet from her liver. 
</P>
<P>
"She went back to school today," Jennifer says. 
</P>
<P>
Albert selects a yellow music box shaped like a portable radio. He turns the 
dial and listens to a tinny version of "Somewhere over the Rainbow" over and 
over again. 
</P>
<P>
Albert and Jennifer pack up their bundles with the help of the counselor. The 
music box keeps playing as the children say thank you and leave. The iron gate 
swings shut behind them.

MAN WHO MOLESTED 2 GIRLS GETS 38 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A convicted child molester was sentenced Friday in Ventura County Superior 
Court to 38 years in prison for assaulting two girls over a period of six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Ceballos, 58, of Camarillo was arrested Jan. 18 after the younger of 
the two girls, who are now 11 and 15, complained to her teacher that Ceballos 
had been assaulting her and the other girl since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos was convicted Aug. 22 of 89 counts of child molesting, including lewd 
or lascivious acts with a child, lewd or lascivious acts with a child with 
force and oral copulation with a child with force. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Jenny Scovis filed motions for Judge Robert C. Bradley to 
acquit Ceballos and grant a new trial. She argued that the criminal complaint 
filed against Ceballos made only vague accusations, alleging that he committed 
one act of molestation during each month of each year against each girl, 
instead of charging him with specific acts at specific dates and times. 
</P>
<P>
But Bradley denied the motions. 
</P>
<P>
"The jury's either going to believe this conduct took place or it did not," 
Bradley said. "The jury believed the victims and did not believe the defendant. 
It's just as simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael K. Frawley said in an interview that Ceballos had 
faced a maximum sentence of 190 years and eight months in prison.

OFFICIALS PREDICT PALMDALE AIRPORT FINALLY HERE TO STAY; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: TWO CARRIERS EXPECT A RECORD 46,000 PASSENGERS IN THE FIRST 
YEAR SINCE THE TERMINAL REOPENED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles city airport officials predicted this week that the fledgling 
Palmdale Regional Airport is finally here to stay, with two well-established 
carriers expected to draw a record 46,000 passengers in the first year since 
the terminal reopened in January. 
</P>
<P>
America West Airlines and Skywest, the two carriers flying out of Palmdale, 
said their flights there have been about one-third full. That is well below the 
industry's standard, but both airlines called it a good load factor for a 
developing market such as Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
The passenger projections by airport officials and the airlines' load factor 
rates, disclosed at an airport supporters meeting in Palmdale, were the first 
public indications of how much business the airport has done since airline 
service resumed his year after a five-year hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the two carriers said they had been attracting enough 
passengers to at least break even on their Palmdale operations. However, they 
warned that higher ticket prices -- due to increases in jet fuel costs because 
of the Middle East crisis -- could change that. 
</P>
<P>
William Schoenfeld, deputy executive director of the Los Angeles Department of 
Airports, which operates the Palmdale airport, said it drew 36,144 passengers 
for the 10 months through October. And he predicted the airport would handle at 
least 10,000 more people during November and December. 
</P>
<P>
Since the city of Los Angeles opened it in mid-1971, the small terminal had a 
succession of mostly small, commuter air services come and go until the last 
one pulled out in 1985. In all those years, Schoenfeld said Palmdale never had 
as many passengers as expected this year. 
</P>
<P>
America West began servicing Palmdale on Jan. 2 and now offers four daily 
flights to Las Vegas and one to Phoenix. Skywest moved in June 1 and now offers 
seven daily flights to Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Schoenfeld said airport officials have an estimated $60-million plan to expand 
the terminal, which sits on land leased from adjoining Air Force Plant 42. But 
he said that would not proceed until the airport gets close to the 250,000 
passenger-a-year capacity of the current terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Schoenfeld said, airport officials plan in January, after months of 
delays, to solicit proposals for the first major commercial-industrial 
development on about 440 acres of the 17,500 acres owned by the city nearby, 
where Los Angeles officials still hope to build a major airport.

LIGHTING UPGRADED FOR SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROD WADE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to concerns about security, lighting in hallways, restrooms and 
other areas is being upgraded at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
College officials also have given the California State University chancellor's 
office proposals for additional outdoor lighting. 
</P>
<P>
Proposals for better lighting were submitted by CSUN's Commission on the Status 
of Women, which has long urged that lighting be improved for safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the chancellor's office appropriated $21,000 to upgrade lighting 
in hallways, restrooms and other areas, said Maralyn Parker, a commission staff 
chairwoman and senior secretary for the university's School of the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
"Another $88,000 has been requested for the continuation of this project, as 
well as another $121,000 to retrofit, or change, existing exterior lighting 
fixtures," Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Chatham, CSUN's director of facilities planning and operations, said the 
Cal State University system provides money for minor projects to improve health 
and safety on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Campus growth created a need for more lighting at the same time the university 
system required reduced consumption of electricity, Chatham said. New lighting 
technology made the commission's proposals feasible. 
</P>
<P>
Commission members, accompanied by Dick Hostetler, director of the lighting 
project for CSUN's department of physical plant management, walked the campus 
Wednesday to identify areas where lighting, access and vegetation might pose 
safety risks at night. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased with the improvements that have been made so far," Parker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hostetler said the lighting project is the fifth "minor capital outlay" program 
designed to improve campus security that he has been involved with over the 
last five years. ROD WADE

MIDTERM CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS 
</P>

<P>
Let's try to sort this out. There was (ultra) column-left pundit Alexander 
Cockburn (Commentary, Nov. 12) discussing the silver lining aspects of a 
Republican real estate developer beating the moderate Democratic incumbent in 
California's congressional District 1. 
</P>
<P>
Cockburn states that this was because a third candidate, a Peace and Freedom 
type, siphoned off votes from the moderate Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
Cockburn then proceeds to lay the victory and foundation for a new political 
movement on the doorstep of an anarchistic weekly newspaper in Mendocino County 
that has, at the most, a few thousand subscribers (many out of the region) and 
a publisher whose recent acts of journalism include punching out a school 
superintendent because he dared to disagree with publisher's views. (Cockburn 
fails to reveal that his column has run in the Mendocino weekly for years and 
that he is good friends with the publisher.) 
</P>
<P>
Mendocino County has always been known for its fringe political movements, 
whether animal rights issues, get-out-the-vote for Jesse Jackson or feeble 
attempts to organize a Green Party. 
</P>
<P>
What Cockburn fails to admit is that the radicals of whom he is so proud played 
right into the hands of the conservatives, and now a real estate developer will 
hold the seat held by a Democrat whose only crime was that he waffled 
occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
Silver lining? Hardly.

As a native Northern Californian born and raised in the "silver lining" above 
Mendocino County, I strongly agree with Cockburn's column. 
</P>
<P>
His cryptic outlook on the parties and their funding is realistic. 
</P>
<P>
These corporations are piling money into these candidates for their own 
welfare, not that of the community. It is time to realize the dangers we are 
facing by allowing these multimillion-dollar firms to influence and run our 
elections and our government. 
</P>
<P>
It is indeed time that we as individuals who appreciate our freedom become 
educated about the perils of corporate funding before we find our democracy 
taken away by socialists in three-piece suits.

William Raspberry states that an investment is needed in the moral development 
of kids ("Kids Need a Moral Compass to Go Straight," Commentary, Oct. 25). 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't spell out this investment. 
</P>
<P>
Morality is learned by example. Our whole culture is caught up in expediency, 
in dishonesty, in hypocrisy. This starts from the very top. This sets the wrong 
example. Look at the Washington budget process, the election process. These set 
very poor examples of morality. Look at the whole era of Reaganomics. It set an 
example of me first, not morality. 
</P>
<P>
When we point our finger at the kids and their parents, notice how many fingers 
are pointed back at ourselves.

FAILURE TO INCLUDE DISTINGUISHED BLACK AUTHORS IN 'THE GREAT BOOKS' AMOUNTS TO 
INTELLECTUAL COLONIALISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK MATHABANE, Mark Mathabane is the author of Kaffir Boy in America 
(MacMillan). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, the "Great Books of the Western World" have been a prominent feature 
of my library. Few sets of books have exercised a more profound influence on my 
intellectual growth. 
</P>
<P>
It was therefore with extreme disappointment that I learned that during the 
Encyclopedia Britannica's revision and updating of the "Great Books," in which 
45 authors of the 20th Century, among them James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, F. 
Scott Fitzgerald and Willa Cather, were added to the reading list (women 
writers for the first time), the editors could not find a black writer worthy 
of inclusion. Not one. 
</P>
<P>
Disappointment turned to outrage when I read that W. E. B. DuBois -- historian, 
novelist, editor, essayist, political activist, sociologist and one of this 
century's intellectual giants -- was rejected because nothing in his 
astonishing range of work met the three criteria: relevance to the contemporary 
world, capacity to be reread and universality. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if the editors have impartially read any of DuBois' seminal works. 
"Dusk of Dawn," a tour-de-force autobiography of his struggle for 
"self-conscious manhood," which also brilliantly analyzes the complex issues of 
black liberation and racial conflict, is as important and illuminating as 
Bertrand Russell's memoirs. 
</P>
<P>
As America's first black sociologist, DuBois, in "The Philadelphia Negro," an 
exhaustive empirical examination of ghetto life, made significant contributions 
to the field that seeks to determine the effects of social environment on human 
behavior. This at a time when white sociologists were merely theorizing about 
the plight of blacks in America and race relations. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soul of Black Folks" is a literary classic and one of the major 
sociological documents of our time. Though ostensibly about the black 
experience in America, it is not a "black" book, just as Tolstoy's "War and 
Peace" is not a Russian book and "Pride and Prejudice" is not a British book. 
Like these two classics, its insights, provocative ideas and observations 
transcend the narrow boundaries of race and nationality to address momentous 
issues of the human condition and character. 
</P>
<P>
DuBois' themes -- racism, oppression, freedom, justice, history, culture and 
identity -- are bona fide great ideas. In treating them, his DuBois is seldom 
preachy or pedantic, despite his erudition and self-assuredness. His language, 
though impassioned and redolent with pride in and love for black people, is 
reasonable and measured. He analyzes complex problems with the psychological 
precision and clarity of a Freud or William James. 
</P>
<P>
The leitmotif of DuBois' works -- how one achieves self-actualization in a 
world where one lives constantly behind a suffocating veil, and is often 
invisible, sometimes even to oneself -- is not unique to blacks in America. The 
dichotomy of personality created by living behind the veil is common among most 
blacks where the white man has oppressed them, destroyed their heritage and 
imposed upon them a new and alien way of life and being. It exists in South 
Africa, Britain, France, Germany and wherever in the Western World that the 
black man is found. 
</P>
<P>
Why then, in the name of fairness, cannot this vital component of Western 
society and thought be included in the discussion of the great ideas that have 
shaped humankind? 
</P>
<P>
Critics have charged that the editors of the "Great Books" are culturally 
biased in favor of Western white male authors. The omission of meritorious 
black writers is even more glaring when one considers that the latest inductees 
into the white male intellectual hall of fame -- Faulkner, Hemingway, Orwell, 
Eliot, et al. -- penned their masterpieces in a century (the 20th) replete with 
superb black writers, such as Ralph Ellison, Richard Wright, James Weldon 
Johnson, Zora Neale Hurston, James Baldwin, Wole Soyinka and Chinua Achebe, to 
name a few. 
</P>
<P>
It would be shrill and unfair to accuse the editors of the "Great Books" of 
racism. Rather, I choose to believe that they suffer from the widespread but 
erroneous belief that black writers, however brilliant, are invariably "race" 
writers, capable only of writing protest literature, whose literary and 
intellectual value is transient. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all the black writers I have mentioned are not period writers. They 
possess in the fullest measure what Dostoyevsky calls "universal sensibility," 
the talent to recreate the essence of other cultures and epochs without losing 
one's individuality and identity. Surely the incisive commentaries of Ellison, 
Wright, Achebe and Baldwin on the problem of race and the human condition are 
not inferior to those of a Mark Twain or William Faulkner, fine white writers 
from whose characters many whites have inferred impressions, often harmful and 
stereotypical ones, about blacks. 
</P>
<P>
Most of us who cherish the "Great Books" sincerely hope that the editors will 
rectify their egregious mistake. Failure to include qualified black authors 
amounts to intellectual colonialism. It robs not only America and the world, 
but also posterity, of the means to understand blacks as human beings and to 
empathize with their manifold experiences and rich culture as an integral part 
of the Western world.

PRESIDENT BUSH ORDERS MORE TROOPS TO IRAQ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Golly, what a coincidence! Only two days after the election, President Bush, 
without the approval of Congress, decides to double the size of our force in 
the Persian Gulf (front page, Nov. 9). It should take a couple of months to get 
all the equipment over there, so Thanksgiving, Christmas and Hanukkah won't be 
spoiled by the sight of body bags coming home. 
</P>
<P>
But don't expect a very happy New Year. 
</P>
<P>
Why do we sit mutely by, watching this unilateral manipulation? After Vietnam 
we said that never again would we allow our country to be taken unwillingly 
into a war fought for specious purposes. Yet we, for the most part, stand idly 
by as President Bush commits huge numbers of soldiers and huge amounts of 
equipment to the Persian Gulf region. 
</P>
<P>
The War Powers Act was passed to ensure that the United States would not 
declare war without congressional approval. But President Bush knows that a 
vote in Congress would not support his aims, and so he builds up our forces in 
preparation for a war to be fought for the noble purpose of keeping gasoline 
under $1.35 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
If we do not call and write our representatives to express our opposition, our 
silence can only be taken as acquiescence.

I disagree with the theme that government should go into the business of

<P>
What a joy to read Raspberry's column. 
</P>
<P>
While our politicians for self-interest will continue to sell their voters on 
the notion that "it isn't your fault, we only need more federal money," a 
columnist has come straight. 
</P>
<P>
There will always be racism, but to use that fact for an excuse to not go to 
school or work, or to go late with a negative attitude, and/or to abuse others, 
drugs and sex only fuels the racist. 
</P>
<P>
Racism has never been so muted in this country or opportunity all that wanting 
(ask some recent immigrants), yet an ever-increasing number of parents are 
developing a subculture that precludes their children from a meaningful future. 
The bigger problem is not hopes dashed on the rocks of racism, but no hope that 
has been learned from parents. 
</P>
<P>
Until negligent parents have been made aware of their invidious role in 
creating a no-culture culture and have to face other consequences for the 
results of their parenting, there is little hope for change. 
</P>
<P>
In the community in which I work with high school students, many parents 
denounce intervening authority and lie for their child until the youngster is 
failing in school, pregnant, beaten up, shot or is going behind bars. Then a 
few will break from supporting anger to tears and plead, "What can I do?" 
Institutions and individuals should be answering that question, even before it 
is asked.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
C. Curtis Gabrielson, a retired certified public account and longtime Glendale 
resident, has died in a Glendale hospital. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
Gabrielson died Tuesday of heart failure, his daughter, Marylou Dudley, said. 
</P>
<P>
Born March 9, 1903, in Los Angeles, Gabrielson opened an accounting firm in Los 
Angeles in 1932. He merged the firm, Gabrielson, O'Sullivan &amp; Poulson, in 
1956 with Haskins and Sells to become Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells. He retired 
in the mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Gabrielson was president of the California Certified Public Accountants Society 
in 1951-52, served on the governing council of the American Institute of 
Certified Public Accountants from 1951-56, and was president of the Los Angeles 
chapter of the American Defense Preparedness Assn. in 1959. He was a longtime 
member of the Jonathon Club in Los Angeles and the World Affairs Council of Los 
Angeles and was active with the YMCA of Metropolitan Los Angeles for more than 
50 years, serving on its finance committee. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife of 67 years, Ruth L. Gabrielson; daughters Marylou 
Dudley of San Marino, Joan Cooper of San Lorenzo and Jean McCoy of El Centro; 
sister Myrtle Frampton of Oakland; nine grandchildren; and seven 
great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral is scheduled for noon today at the La Crescenta Presbyterian Church, 
2902 Montrose Ave., where he was a member. Burial will follow at Forest Lawn 
Memorial Park in Glendale. Forest Lawn Mortuary in Glendale is handling the 
arrangements. Donations can be sent in Gabrielson's name to the YMCA of 
Metropolitan Los Angeles.

FRED C. KNOTH; SPECIAL EFFECTS EXPERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fred C. Knoth, who headed Universal Pictures' special effects department and 
won a technical award for designing a fog machine, has died at his Burbank 
home. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
Knoth died Thursday of a heart attack, said his daughter, Elecia Klaes. 
</P>
<P>
Born March 13, 1902, in Loveland, Colo., he came to California in the 1920s and 
worked as a carpenter at Hal Roach Studios. Knoth earned a bachelor's degree in 
civil engineering from the University of Colorado in 1930 and returned to Hal 
Roach where he worked as a prop man and an extra in films. 
</P>
<P>
Knoth later turned his interests to special effects, working at Warner Bros. 
from the late 1930s to the mid-1940s before becoming head of the special 
effects department at Universal Pictures. He worked on several Abbott and 
Costello and Laurel and Hardy films in addition to "Topper" (1937), "The Deadly 
Mantis" (1957) and "The Land Unknown" (1957). He retired from Universal in the 
late 1960s, but returned to work on "Hellfighters" (1968) and "Airport" (1970). 
</P>
<P>
In 1954, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave Knoth a technical 
award for co-inventing a portable electric dry-oil fog machine with Orien 
Ernest. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his son, Fred R. Knoth of Downey; daughter, Elecia Klaes of 
Fountain Valley; six grandchildren, and one great-grandson. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral is scheduled at 11 a.m. today at St. Finbar Catholic Church, 2010 W. 
Olive St. in Burbank, with burial to follow at San Fernando Mission Cemetery in 
Mission Hills. Woods Glendale Mortuary is handling the arrangements. Donations 
can be sent in Knoth's name to the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders 
Assn.

OFFICIALS FLAGGED FOR CALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINE BRENNAN, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To this day, Dave Parry wonders how he missed the call. The former NFL 
official, now in his first year as supervisor of Big Ten football officials, 
knows the Houston Oilers were one of the teams involved in his mistake. He 
doesn't even remember the other team, but that's understandable, considering he 
spent 15 years calling penalties as a side judge in the league. 
</P>
<P>
What he always will remember about the play is that he blew it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I was daydreaming or just drew a blank," Parry said over the 
phone from his home in Michigan City, Ind. "But someone from the Houston Oilers 
wound up and threw a haymaker punch and I just missed it. The players came up 
to me and complained, and I had to tell them I didn't see it. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I saw the tape of the game, and I said, 'My gosh, how did I miss that?' I 
was very embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps this is why Parry reacted not with rage, but with a knowing sigh of 
resignation, when earlier this season officials missed an Illinois forward 
lateral on an important touchdown against Ohio State, or when they failed to 
call pass interference on Michigan State as then top-ranked Michigan went for 
-- and missed -- the winning two-point conversion at the end of the game a week 
later. 
</P>
<P>
It was a difficult stretch for the Big Ten, just as it has been a difficult 
year for officials everywhere. Missed calls, a controversial fifth down, 
outraged coaches, enraged players, instant-replay snafus, lengthy delays: it 
all has happened in the 1990 football season, college and pro. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not perfect; we are people," Parry said. "I don't know anyone who feels 
worse when they make a mistake than do officials." 
</P>
<P>
To some, this might be a revelation: Officials are people too. They are 
well-trained but not full-time; they are graded but rarely suspended; they are 
paid but not well. They are avid sports fans who weren't quite good enough to 
play the game at the level at which they officiate it. They love the smell of 
stadium grass; some of their favorite people are longtime assistant coaches 
with whom they chat in the hour before kickoff. They crave anonymity in a world 
of high-priced headline grabbers, from the field to the owners box. When they 
do their best, they go unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was on the field, I remember players lining up for a play and saying to 
myself, 'God, am I fortunate to be here,' " said Art McNally, the NFL 
supervisor of officials since 1973 and a longtime official of football, 
baseball and basketball at all levels. "A half-hour before the game, I'd get my 
feet down on the grass or AstroTurf and talk to the assistants, like the 
Redskins' Wayne Sevier. Not only are the officials my guys, but the coaches are 
my guys." 
</P>
<P>
Nice guys or not, there have been a tremendous amount of embarrassing gaffes 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
It's impossible to forget the sight of an enraged Boomer Esiason screaming at 
the officials during one of several drawn-out rules discussions in Cincinnati's 
34-13 Monday night victory over Cleveland last month. The problem, in Esiason's 
mind, was the way the crew of referee Bob McElwee decided to take away a 
touchdown, then debate the offensive-line formation. A source close to the 
officials said they decided to double-check their decision as a courtesy to 
Esiason when he became so upset. 
</P>
<P>
In that game they also debated whether a Bernie Kosar pass was a lateral that 
could be recovered by the defense. Then the question became whether the play 
had been whistled dead with the ball on the ground. And, finally, the crew lost 
count of the downs and nearly took a play away from Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
"The game was way out of hand," Esiason said. 
</P>
<P>
There were problems the week before in the Minnesota-Philadelphia game, with a 
quick whistle on a Herschel Walker fumble, a muffed interference call on wide 
receiver Cris Carter and a controversial holding penalty on safety Joey 
Browner. 
</P>
<P>
And then there were the back-to-back Big Ten games officiated by the same crew 
in early October. 
</P>
<P>
Parry attended the Illinois-Ohio State game, watched the forward lateral that 
allowed Illinois to put a close game out of reach and joined the crew 
immediately afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"Fellas," he said to them, "I saw the replay and we missed it. It was forward." 
</P>
<P>
The officials looked up at him in silence. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, you could hear a pin drop," Parry said, with sadness in his voice. "They 
just felt terrible." 
</P>
<P>
The next Saturday came the non-call on Michigan State's pass interference. 
</P>
<P>
"Two or three officials could have called it, but none did," Parry said. "The 
mistake was made when the people looked up to see the status or position of the 
football and looked back and saw tangled bodies. I understand the thinking 
process of the people involved, but it couldn't have come at a worse time, with 
the fifth-down situation as well as the lateral." 
</P>
<P>
(The fifth down came in the Colorado-Missouri Big Eight game of Oct. 6, the 
same day as the Illinois-Ohio State game. The officials mistakenly gave 
Colorado a fifth down at the end of the game and the Buffaloes used it to score 
the winning touchdown on a one-yard run. Colorado now is No. 2 in the 
Associated Press poll.) 
</P>
<P>
Parry speaks for his officials because the league asks that they don't speak 
for themselves and discuss their work in public during the season. This isn't 
unusual. The NFL will not allow its officials to talk to reporters during the 
season except after games, and only about specific plays. 
</P>
<P>
"We just make it simple, no interviews," said McNally. "We will not break from 
that." 
</P>
<P>
So the people who talk about them, and their profession, are their supervisors 
or former officials. Some, like Parry, are both. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say there is a split second to make a call, and no more. It's the 
time that differentiates between right and wrong, the time that makes the good 
officials good and the bad ones bad. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a moment of truth, and then it's gone," Parry said. "Both the Ohio 
State and Michigan situations were like that. It's a moment when all is right 
for the right call, or all is wrong for the wrong call. It's all there for you, 
and then it's over." 
</P>
<P>
The making of a call is not so quick it cannot be dissected, Parry said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of it is training, some of it is instinct," he said. "All the years of 
training, all the years of meetings, are wrapped into that decision. If a play 
is so close it takes time for you to think about it, it's probably not a foul. 
A foul should be an instinctive thing." 
</P>
<P>
Said Norm Schachter, a veteran of 23 NFL seasons who now writes weekly rules 
quizzes taken by all NFL officials: "I don't think there is a feeling. You see 
it, you throw it." 
</P>
<P>
These instincts are honed over time. All officials who make the big time have 
been at it for dozens of years. They undoubtedly began officiating high-school 
games for $10 or $15 a game, worked their way to college games and, for some, 
made it to the NFL. Football wasn't their only game; in one year in the early 
1950s, McNally worked 269 games, including some nights of three consecutive 
basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
Officiating wasn't their only job, and still isn't. Even in the NFL, these men 
are moonlighting. They are school teachers, businessmen, engineers, sales 
managers, physicians, insurance agents. NFL officials -- there are 107 of them 
-- travel to their game cities on Saturdays to meet and review both their last 
game film and a weekly training film. They take the rules quiz Sunday morning, 
discuss the teams they will see in very general terms ("They're never allowed 
to talk negatives," McNally said), then work the game. They get home late 
Sunday or early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
They don't do it for the money: NFL rookies make $600 a game, 20-year veterans 
earn $2,000 a game. The top-notch officials, so deemed by a weekly grading 
system, get to work the playoffs, where they make $5,000 a game until the Super 
Bowl. In that game, they earn $7,500. 
</P>
<P>
Every NFL player makes more than the officials. 
</P>
<P>
In the Big Ten, the 44 officials earn $400 a game and are required to review 
their game tape and a training film Friday night and watch a tape of their game 
almost immediately after it ends Saturday. Many of them drive to Parry's house 
for a weekly Wednesday night meeting in his basement to go over plays, 
coverages, mechanics and rules. 
</P>
<P>
"Some drive three to four hours one way and they don't even get mileage," Parry 
said. "The fact that they take the time shows you what kind of people they 
are." 
</P>
<P>
The fact they don't hate instant replay also tells you something. There are no 
formal polls on the subject, but, as Parry said of his NFL officiating days, 
"You always hope you're right. You stand on the field and wait and when the 
call stands, you feel good. When they overrule you, however, you get a 
sickening feeling in your stomach." 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I had had instant replay," said Schachter. "I never would have made a 
bad call." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, quite a few NFL coaches have wondered aloud if officials 
shouldn't be full-time. Their criticism is that if the coaches and players work 
full-time, the officials should, too. 
</P>
<P>
"This comes up on occasion," McNally said. "But there are some problems with 
it. A minimum of 60 percent of our officials could not go full-time, so we'd 
probably lose a lot of them. If we played games Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and 
Sunday, then I'd say, 'Let's cut the staff down and go full-time.' Right now, 
with games just on Sundays and Mondays every week, crews can work just one 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"Then there's the problem of what the officials would do during the week if 
they were full-time," McNally continued. "I'm not certain it would be best to 
have them go to team practices during the week, where they are not working 
under game conditions." 
</P>
<P>
So, unlike the officials in professional baseball, basketball and hockey, who 
work full-time in season, NFL officials remain part-timers with other lives to 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very tough for the people involved," Parry said. "The loved ones hurt 
too. Your wife goes to the grocery store and people point fingers. Your kid 
goes to school and other kids make comments. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, we've still got people who are willing to do this. How would you 
play the games without them?"

GRAF MAINTAINS THE UPPER HAND IN NEW YORK 
</P>

<P>
So what kind of year has it been for Steffi Graf, who is 72-4? 
</P>
<P>
a) Pitiful 
</P>
<P>
b) Terrific 
</P>
<P>
By most accounts, 1990 will go down as an utterly underwhelming year for Graf, 
who discovered that it's not necessarily losing matches that hurts the most, 
but losing the wrong matches. 
</P>
<P>
She lost to Monica Seles in the final of the German Open, to Seles again in the 
French Open final, to Zina Garrison in the Wimbledon semifinals and to Gabriela 
Sabatini in the U.S. Open final. 
</P>
<P>
After winning seven of the eight Grand Slams in 1988 and 1989, her lone Grand 
Slam title this year in Australia looks pretty lonesome. 
</P>
<P>
Graf power-stroked her way into today's semifinals of the $3-million Virginia 
Slims Championships with a 6-3, 6-0 wipeout of Katerina Maleeva Friday night at 
Madison Square Garden. As a result, Graf is on track to pick up the $250,000 
winner's share if she wins two more matches this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
In the semifinals, Graf meets Sabatini, who defeated Conchita Martinez in a 
quarterfinal, 6-4, 1-6, 6-1. Seles plays Mary Joe Fernandez in the second 
semifinal today. 
</P>
<P>
Graf, twice a winner of the season-ending Virginia Slims Championships, hinted 
that she was affected all year by reports linking her father and manager, Peter 
Graf, with a model, who was later charged in Germany with attempting to extort 
money from the elder Graf. 
</P>
<P>
"After having the troubles that I have had, I think I had a very good year for 
what I have gone through," Graf said. "I can be happy. Even despite sayings 
that it hasn't been a good year, I feel good about it." 
</P>
<P>
Maleeva said reports about Graf's slide are amusing. She was asked how well an 
opponent must play to beat Graf. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to play out of your mind," Maleeva said. 
</P>
<P>
Two forces made for each other -- Seles and shopping -- collided this week for 
the first time at two of Manhattan's most famous clothing stores. The result 
was, well, picture how Casey Stengel might describe a trip to a department 
store. This may be the only way to follow what happened. 
</P>
<P>
The following is Seles' complete and unabridged account of her shopping trip, 
sort of Monica meets the mall: 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I went into Bloomingdale's and Macy's and it's crazy," Seles said. "I 
mean, I've never been there first of all. I got lost in Bloomingdale's. I just 
left. I think it was Third Avenue and I didn't even look because you are used 
to one exit in the Sarasota (Fla.) mall that is all inside. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept going around and I kept looking for my parents. I didn't know where I 
was because at the fourth floor, or four or five, they were at the main level. 
I was, like on the first level, going around, and kept asking everybody. And 
they didn't know because they didn't know what avenue I was coming in. So it 
was a long day. But it was a long day." 
</P>
<P>
Seles was asked if she was still missing her parents. 
</P>
<P>
"I found them after quite awhile. It was probably an hour and a half going in 
circles, but not just that. It is just the panic that you get in because I know 
I was, I told my parents I would be there by 1:45, then I'm not there. 
</P>
<P>
"I really got lost because, I mean in Sarasota, you know all the exits of the 
mall are right there. It is a small store. All the people, all the confusion, 
and one part, this guy is trying to sell this perfume and in the other part, 
makeup. 
</P>
<P>
"It is just -- it is hard to resist a lot of times, I wouldn't go in here for a 
couple of days, I think."

MORNING BRIEFING: IT IS BY NO MEANS LAST LAUGH, BUT BRUINS GET A GOOD START

<P>
Coaches Larry Smith of USC and Terry Donahue of UCLA were guests at Friday's 
Downtown Rotary luncheon, held each year the day before their schools' football 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Both were asked questions by the audience. If the battle of the quips is an 
omen of today's game, Donahue and the Bruins already have opened a sizable lead 
over Smith and the Trojans. Some samples: 
</P>
<P>
Question: "Terry, why don't coaches ever smile on the sidelines?" 
</P>
<P>
Donahue: "You sound like my mother." 
</P>
<P>
Question: "Terry, in your pregame chalk talk tomorrow, what special strategy 
will you have, what will you tell your team?" 
</P>
<P>
Donahue: "I'll tell them to stay out of the way of that damn horse." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Which two Pacific 10 football rivals have played the most games 
against one another? 
</P>
<P>
"I am Spartacus": With a strike deadline less than 24 hours away, San Francisco 
Chronicle staff writers showed their solidarity with the Northern California 
Newspaper Guild by forgoing their bylines in Friday morning's editions. 
</P>
<P>
You knew they meant business when columnist Herb Caen and The Sporting Green's 
Lowell (First Person) Cohn went anonymous for the day. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath the headline, "A Sigh for Venerable (Dave) Stewart," and the 
designation, "Chronicle Staff Writer," Cohn could not totally conceal his 
identity, although he did limit himself to four I's, three me's and one my. 
</P>
<P>
Add Chronicle: Cohn's near-starvation diet might have been more rigorous. But, 
with the end of his column in sight, he backslid: 
</P>
<P>
"While I had Stewart on the phone, I brought up an old subject. In the World

Now the picture unfolds: Oregon State's 56-7 trouncing at the hands of USC last 
week might have been worse. The Beavers might have been without quarterback 
Fred Schweer. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to start in place of Matt Booher, who had been suspended for 
violating a team rule, Schweer nearly was benched after the Corvallis 
Gazette-Times reported that he had been caught shoplifting a copy of Penthouse 
magazine from the OSU bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
Add Schweer: The bookstore incident occurred Tuesday and wasn't reported until 
Saturday morning. Schweer was allowed to play only after a meeting among Oregon 
State Coach Dave Kragthorpe and his assistants. 
</P>
<P>
According to Neil Cawood of the Eugene Register-Guard, Schweer was apprehended 
by one of several plainclothes student security employees hired to help curb 
rampant shoplifting at the bookstore in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Schweer was arraigned Thursday in Benton County district court and will appear 
at a hearing on Nov. 29. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Oregon and Oregon State. Today's game at Corvallis will be the 
93rd time the schools have met. 
</P>

program, which has been banned from television appearances and postseason play

Hats off to the Dodgers for finally doing the right thing and not letting a 
great one (Tim Raines, Rickey Henderson, etc.) slip away. Darryl Strawberry 
will be a great Dodger for many years, but if the Dodgers are really serious 
about winning a championship, they'll have to dig a little deeper into their 
pockets and sign or trade for a left-handed relief pitcher, such as Dave 
Righetti or Ken Dayley.

Being a big fan of the Mets, I am now relieved that the departure of Darryl 
Strawberry has been finalized. The Dodgers just may see that not working with 
their farm system and just living off players from other teams could hurt them.

Should the Dodgers elect to keep Kirk Gibson, they would certainly have three 
of the more pleasant human beings in the history of the game together in one 
outfield, now that Darryl Strawberry has joined Kal Daniels on our merry blue 
crew. It serves to remind us once again that it's not the person but the 
performance that endears the athlete to our hearts.

<P>
Cal State Long Beach, trying for its first winning football season since 1986, 
will play Nevada Las Vegas in a Big West Conference game today at 1 p.m. in 
Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers are 5-5 overall and 3-3 in the Big West. 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas is 4-6 and 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
Coach George Allen said a victory is important for the future of the Long Beach 
program, adding: "We have to get better student support." 
</P>
<P>
Although they are 5-0 at home, the 49ers are averaging only 4,800 fans a game. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach quarterback Todd Studer, who has passed for 17 touchdowns, is 11th 
in the country in total offense with 2,388 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas uses two quarterbacks -- Derek Stott, who has thrown for 1,706 yards, 
and Hunkie Cooper, who is sixth nationally with 1,622 all-purpose running 
yards. Cooper also plays flanker and returns kicks. 
</P>

New Mexico State today is the Game of the Weak.

The Titans (1-10) have lost 10 consecutive games and are ranked 105th of 106

Oliver Miller had 20 points, 12 rebounds and blocked five shots in dominating 
the inside as second-ranked Arkansas routed No. 15 Oklahoma, 110-88, Friday 
night at Fayetteville, Ark., in the second round of the preseason NIT. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-9, 275-pound Miller also helped the Razorbacks (2-0) with outlet 
passes to start fast breaks, and on at least three occasions tied up Oklahoma 
shooters. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the worst for Oklahoma (1-1) since 1980, when Nebraska beat the 
Sooners, 90-63. 
</P>
<P>
No. 3 Arizona 88, East Tennessee State 79 -- The Buccaneers made 12 of 26 
three-point shots, but the Wildcats, led by Sean Rooks' 17 points, took control 
in the second half at Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona (2-0) took the lead for good at 66-65 with 8:46 remaining when the 
6-foot-11 Rooks, who finished with 21 points, made a short jumper. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats built their lead to 83-72 on a dunk by Brian Williams with 1:34 
remaining, and took a 87-74 lead in the final minute on two free throws by 
Chris Mills. 
</P>
<P>
No. 6 Duke 100, Boston College 76 -- The Blue Devils took command 2 1/2 minutes 
into the game at Durham, N.C., going on a 24-2 run that included 20 consecutive 
points while holding the Eagles scoreless for 6 1/2 minutes.

CAVALIERS BEAT BUCKS, 99-94, BUT LOSE WILLIAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cleveland's John Williams, who had begun to get into his best shape, suffered a 
foot injury in the closing seconds of the Cavaliers' 99-94 victory over the 
Milwaukee Bucks Friday night at Richfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, who signed a seven-year contract shortly before the season opened, 
collapsed while driving to the basket, twisting his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-11 forward was carried off on a stretcher. A preliminary examination 
indicated no broken bones, but he was taken to a hospital for X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Nance, who replaced Williams in the starting lineup after the Cavaliers 
were overwhelmed in their first two games, had 25 points (11 for 14 from the 
field), six rebounds and four blocks to again lead the Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
Since Coach Len Wilkens moved Nance and rookie guard Gerald Paddio into the 
starting lineup, the Cavaliers are 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Williams had kept getting sharper coming off the bench. In this game he and 
Nance keyed a 9-0 spurt that enabled the Cavaliers to build a 10-point lead in 
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Williams was the only Cavalier to play every game last season. Injuries almost 
destroyed the team. Brad Daugherty missed 41 games and Nance 20 last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Injuries have hurt us the last two seasons," playmaker Mark Price said. "I 
sure hope John is not hurt seriously. We are just starting to jell." 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte 119, Atlanta 109 -- The Hornets, 6-35 on the road last season, have 
found a road warrior in Rex Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman scored 12 points in the fourth quarter at Atlanta, including seven in a 
row near the finish to thwart the Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 115, Washington 102 -- Charles Barkley had 35 points and 18 
rebounds at Philadelphia, but the 76ers almost lost anyway. 
</P>
<P>
With only four seconds left in regulation, Ron Anderson sank a three-point shot 
to send the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The Bullets, who outplayed the 76ers most of the game, collapsed in the extra 
period and were outscored, 19-6. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard King had 33 points for the Bullets, but all came in the first three 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was nine for 54 in three-pointers this season, Anderson said he 
called for the ball, but didn't know why. "Fortunately, it went in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 114, Utah 89 -- No matter where they call home, the Jazz can't win in 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Parish and Larry Bird paced a 24-4 run in the third quarter that broke 
open a close game and the Celtics scored their 20th consecutive victory over 
the Jazz in Boston Garden. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 105, New Jersey 96 -- Isiah Thomas had nine points and four assists in 
the first quarter at East rutherford, N.J., to help the Pistons take a 35-18 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
They held on for their fifth victory in seven games, although Coach Chuck Daly 
wasn't happy that they let the Nets back into the game. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana 106, Miami 80 -- Shortly after signing a contract extension, guard Vern 
Fleming was a point-a-minute player for the first 10 minutes at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Fleming's flurry gave the Pacers a 23-9 lead and the Heat was never in the 
game. DAN HAFNER

'ILLUSION WINS CLOSE CABO RACE; 
</P>
<P>
SAILING: MCDOWELL'S BOAT TAKES SERIES OVER CHEVAL WITH BETTER PERFORMANCES IN 
THREE OF FIVE EVENTS.

Ed McDowell's Grand Illusion scored the narrowest of victories and won the 
closest of championships at Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
After six days of slow, agonizing sailing, the Santa Cruz 70 from the King 
Harbor Yacht Club finished 1 minute 22 seconds ahead of Mitchell Rouse's Taxi 
Dancer to win the 870-mile race from Los Angeles to Cabo San Lucas, around 
Guadalupe Island. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, in the last of five point-scoring events for the ULDB 70 Assn., 
gave Grand Illusion the season title over Hal Ward's Cheval. With Cheval 
finishing sixth, each had 55 points, but Grand Illusion placed higher than 
Cheval in three of the five events. 
</P>
<P>
If Taxi Dancer had beaten Grand Ilusion, Cheval would have won the 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
McDowell, a retired petroleum executive, wasn't there for his boat's big moment 
but was in Chicago for a speaking engagement. The sailing master was Bill 
Peterson, with Joe Buck the navigator. 
</P>
<P>
Grand Illusion, Taxi Dancer and Peter Tong's third-place Blondie, the defending 
champion, all passed Davis Pillsbury's Holua and Brack Duker's Evolution on the 
final day, after the one day of good wind Wednesday died to a zephyr Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Leweck, tactician aboard Evolution, said: "We passed Holua (Thursday night) 
and thought we had won. Then, when the sun came up this morning, we saw Grand 
Illusion and Taxi Dancer in front of us. The first six boats were in sight of 
one another." 
</P>
<P>
Grand Illusion and Taxi Dancer, taking advantage of stronger breezes inshore, 
were virtually even the last few miles and managed to finish just as the wind 
died, leaving the others to drift in more than two hours later. 
</P>
<P>
Nine of the 21 boats had finished by late Friday afternoon. Seven others 
dropped out along the way because of the light winds. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them may not make the awards banquet (tonight)," Leweck said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the sponsoring Los Angeles Yacht Club indicated that they would 
not try to sail around Guadalupe Island in future events because the November 
winds are too light. That would cut about 60 miles off the distance and allow 
boats to sail closer to shore in stronger winds.

Nothing is more pathetic than a band caught in a rut. Change or die, they say, 
and bands that do neither invariably end up in something of a musical limbo. 
</P>
<P>
It seems unlikely that this fate will ever befall the Untouchables. Since the 
band's early 1980s emergence on the Los Angeles club scene, change has been its 
trademark. It started out playing straight Jamaican ska, the upbeat precursor 
to reggae. Today, the group weaves ska, reggae, rhythm-and-blues, funk and even 
rap into its musical tapestry. 
</P>
<P>
This ever-expanding musical Weltanschauung is certainly one of the reasons why 
major commercial success has steadfastly eluded the Untouchables. Radio likes 
things neat and simple. If you don't fall into a specific category, if you take 
chances, if you take risks, forget it. 
</P>
<P>
But what radio continues to snub makes for a riveting live show, as the 
Untouchables once again demonstrated Thursday night at the Belly Up Tavern, 
where the group plays every other month or so. 
</P>
<P>
Like the group's past performances at the 560-capacity Solana Beach nightclub, 
this one was all but sold-out. The dance floor resembled a Manhattan subway 
platform during rush hour -- a mass of twisting, gyrating, sweating bodies, all 
moving at once. 
</P>
<P>
And, for a good 90 minutes, this throbbing mass of people was treated to 
exhilarating, intelligent dance music, a veritable hodgepodge of black musical 
styles. 
</P>
<P>
From the very start, the Untouchables had a foot on the gas pedal, and, as the 
evening wore on, the group kept revving the engine with increasing intensity, 
shifting gears without pulling in the clutch. 
</P>
<P>
It opened with "I Spy (for the FBI)," a sizzling soul tune punctuated by riffs 
from the familiar "Dragnet" theme. Then came a reggae song, a rap song and a 
funk song -- a spirited interpretation of the old Edwin Starr hit, "Agent OO 
Soul" -- each highlighted by the majestic, dueling trombone and saxophone of 
the Utility Horns, aka Bill Donato and Tim Moynahan. 
</P>
<P>
"Do U Love Me?" was as sensuous as it was sweltering; "Hey U Tease" was a 
ferocious funk-rocker reminiscent of James Brown in his heyday. 
</P>
<P>
"What's Gone Wrong," a lilting soul ballad that was a big hit last year on 
alternative radio stations like L.A.'s KROQ-FM, provided the dancers with a 
temporary respite. Particularly compelling was the horn chorus, at once smooth 
and piercing. 
</P>
<P>
The pace picked up again with a fired-up rhythm-and-blues song, "Wild Child," 
which sounded like something from the fabled Stax-Volt catalogue of mid-1960s 
soul hits. Clyde Grimes, who had founded the band with singer Jerry Miller, led 
the charge with his spicy guitar chops; the horns responded with the force of a 
runaway locomotive. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the performance, the Untouchables served up a delicious 
version of "Free Yourself," long a staple of the group's live shows. It was a 
fitting finale: the song is a musical melting pot of every style of black music 
the Untouchables excel at, a showcase for the group's remarkable talent and 
versatility.

FUNDING SHAKESPEARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My heartfelt appreciation to the anonymous Costa Mesa woman who gave $10,000 to 
the Grove Shakespeare Festival (Oct. 25). 
</P>
<P>
But what a sad commentary it is on the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
None of the controversy over NEA funding would have happened if the endowment 
had been spending its money wisely. Why can a woman who smears food on her 
naked body get funding when a Shakespeare festival can't? 
</P>
<P>
Our government should support the arts by helping to find the artist in us all 
-- by funding programs that put poets, painters, writers and dancers in the 
schools; by helping cities fund plays and concerts in our parks; by supporting 
teaching inner-city youth to paint murals instead of graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Let experimental art and the private performance artists get funding elsewhere. 
Let the government fund truly "public art."

If one has the guts and the drive to determine the relative worth of a 
political issue, regardless of who is for or against it, he doesn't need to 
swallow the celebrities' pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrities are media creations who live in airy fantasy. It's only when one 
realizes that there are as many air-heads among the consuming public as there 
are among "celebrities" that the subject even deserves attention.

Funny that Rosenberg should bring up Tyne Daly's name. It was Daly's political 
"dis-advocacy" in the last gubernatorial election that gave celebrity advocates 
in general little or no credibility. 
</P>
<P>
Daly was so offensive as well as so off base in her attacks on Gov. George 
Deukmejian that I no longer could stand to watch her on the fine "Cagney &amp; 
Lacey" series. 
</P>
<P>
The ad that I found most distasteful was the one done by Tracy Nelson and the 
little cancer victim. I know Tracy has licked cancer and I am glad for her, but 
I thought that to use the little girl and her sad plight to persuade people to 
vote for Prop. 128 was shameful.

GUEST GENERAL LEADS A MASSACRE OF BACH AND HAYDN

<TEXT>
<P>
Inviting Alexander Schneider to conduct the first of three concerts in the San 
Diego Symphony's Classically Baroque series was a colossal mistake. The 
octogenarian conductor, who made his Copley Symphony Hall debut Thursday night, 
displayed not the faintest sympathy for the performance of 18th-Century music. 
</P>
<P>
His grotesque caricature of Haydn's Symphony No. 90 and his utter distortion of 
J. S. Bach's First Suite for Orchestra proved cruel and unusual punishment to 
those who admire the craft and inspiration of those composers. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of this new series is indeed laudable: to perform music that 
predates the advent of the large modern symphony orchestra by using a 
judiciously pared down ensemble. However, the execution is not foolproof, as 
Schneider clearly demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-piece ensemble, clustered at the forward edge of the stage for 
Thursday's program, had a comfortable, lively presence in the hall. 
</P>
<P>
In the solo sections of the Bach Suite, for example, the intricate counterpoint 
of the two oboes and bassoon shimmered elegantly in such intimate proximity to 
the audience. In Giuseppe Torelli's modest but charming Concerto Grosso for Two 
Violins in A Minor, concertmaster Igor Gruppman and principal violin II Alex 
Palamidis alternated their lyrical flights cogently and deftly. 
</P>
<P>
But Schneider's relentlessly exaggerated fortes, ridiculous sforzandos, 
uncharacteristic cadential ritardandos, loutish pounding out of the bass lines 
and misshapen phrasing made such intermittent pleasures a moot point. 
</P>
<P>
In the right hands, the late Haydn symphonies elegantly balance drama and wit. 
Schneider threw Symphony No. 90 on the anvil and attempted to hammer it into 
Beethoven at his stormiest. 
</P>
<P>
The lilting Menuet sounded like a peasant Landler danced in military boots. It 
is a miracle the orchestra was nevertheless able to play with discipline, 
cohesion and balanced string sound. 
</P>
<P>
The Bach Suite for Orchestra, a string of contrasting dance movements, lumbered 
along at Schneider's relentless drubbing. If there is no single "correct" way 
to perform Bach, it is equally true that the one wrong way is to ignore every 
shred of known Baroque performance practice, which Schneider did with brio. 
</P>
<P>
The last time this writer heard Bach played with such insensitivity, it was on 
a musty recording that was instantly tossed out the window by a disgusted music 
history teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's concert opened with a quiet Vivaldi Sinfonia ("Al Santo Sepolcro"). 
Its sweetly benign harmonies, however, gave no indication of the musical 
massacre that was to follow.

Regarding Howard Rosenberg's Nov. 5 column, "Celebrity Advocates: Is It Their

</P>
<P>
Rosenberg asks whether viewers are listening to Michael Landon or Jonathan 
Smith the angel (of TV's "Highway to Heaven"). I don't know -- who are we 
listening to when newspapers say vote "No" on Prop. 128? Is it someone 
brilliant? Is it you, Howard? 
</P>
<P>
Golly, we don't know who it is, do you? It couldn't be the people who own these

MJQ: IT'S MODERN WITH A FEW MOTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Where is the M in the MJQ? 
</P>
<P>
Thursday evening, at the Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena, John Lewis took his 
Modern Jazz Quartet through a program of music so impeccable in its 
craftsmanship, and so set in its long popular ways, that it seems curmudgeonly 
to complain. 
</P>
<P>
If jazz is, as has often been said, the sound of surprise, this group, 
comprising the same four men who faced the public together in 1955, is the 
antithesis: the sound of no surprises. Lewis is a composer whose skill is 
beyond question; some of his works, such as "Django," have shown a good shelf 
life. But the problem of predictability is a nagging constant. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever spontaneity could be discerned was largely due to the solos of Milt 
Jackson, but anyone who has heard him leading his own quartet (with Cedar 
Walton, Billy Higgins and John Clayton) knows that in that setting he truly 
came alive, whereas in this format he is largely under wraps. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson even cleaned up Gershwin's Uncle Tom grammar by announcing "Bess You 
Are My Woman Now." One almost expected to hear it followed by "It Doesn't Mean 
a Thing If It Hasn't Got That Swing." 
</P>
<P>
This sense of propriety governed the music itself. The first half consisted 
largely of pieces from the group's Ellington album, with Lewis solemnly turning 
pages of manuscript paper as if he hadn't been through these motions a thousand 
times before. 
</P>
<P>
A new Lewis work, "The Majesty of the Sun," was typically well designed, but 
the "explosions" referred to in his announcement never arrived; one listened in 
vain for a hint of solar energy. 
</P>
<P>
The three-part suite "A Day in Dubrovnik" brought a greater measure of 
interest, as did the encore, Charlie Parker's "Confirmation," one of the few 
pieces that had the quartet loosening up, with Percy Heath's bass and Connie 
Kay's drums in a more propulsive groove. 
</P>
<P>
John Lewis needs a radical change of setting. In the context of the 1990s, for 
all his academic excellence, the MJQ is an anachronism. A more orchestral 
canvas might be the answer. One hates to see the evening sun go down on a group 
that was, in its day, a vital force in generating enthusiasm and respect for 
its innovation. LEONARD FEATHER

DAWN UPSHAW IN INAUGURAL RECITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With its muted, dusky-rose interior, near-perfect sight lines and 756-patron 
capacity, the 2-month-old Irvine Barclay Theatre on the campus of UC Irvine 
would seem to be the ideal recital hall. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it is. Dawn Upshaw, the young American soprano now on the roster of 
the Metropolitan Opera, gave the first solo recital in the hall on Thursday 
night, and proved so. 
</P>
<P>
This was no debut for the 30-year-old singer from Illinois. Upshaw was first 
introduced to Los Angeles-area audiences in a recital at Ambassador Auditorium 
nearly three years ago; subsequently, she has sung with the L.A. Philharmonic 
at the Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
Her accomplishments, then, could be no surprise, but they could delight, as 
they did, in an unhackneyed and satisfying program just a bit short on variety. 
Through it all -- music by Purcell, Poulenc, Wolf, Rachmaninoff and Barber, 
with encores by Mozart and Ives -- Upshaw was handsomely assisted by pianist 
Margo Garrett. 
</P>
<P>
Upshaw was again a thorough and careful song-interpreter, delineating moods, 
delivering textual nuances, indicating the thrust and direction of musical 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a diva she ain't. She does not sweep onto the stage like many of her 
operatic colleagues; her recital deportment and manner of bowing have nothing 
of artifice about them; haughty is not in her repertory. 
</P>
<P>
But the voice is pristine, true, and truly pretty, if not yet distinctive, and 
used with intelligence. In her singing, words emerge clear and understandable; 
meaning follows. Upshaw the artist creates atmosphere and paints emotions. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most beauteous tone produced in this performance came in Mozart's 
"Das Veilchen," the first encore, and an object-lesson in the perfect blending 
of song and singer -- genuine type-casting. Upshaw also excelled in projecting 
the moods -- also mostly melancholy -- of the six songs in Rachmaninoff's Opus 
38. She did the same for Poulenc's subtle "Fiancailles pour rire" and six 
lieder of Hugo Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
What proved far from ideal in this program was Upshaw's choice to end with five 
of Samuel Barber's wondrous "Hermit Songs." Temperamentally, as well as 
vocally, these items, though given honest and sincere performances, did not 
suit the soprano at all, but instead revealed a shallowness -- of tone and 
artistry -- one would not have expected from hearing the earlier part of the 
evening. DANIEL CARIAGA

Some churches ask visitors to stand up and identify themselves at one point 
during Sunday services. Some other congregations ask visitors to wear name 
tags. Good welcoming strategy? 
</P>
<P>
No, according to Barna Research Group in Glendale, which conducted a nationwide 
survey of 900 adults unaffiliated with a church. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors generally would like to learn about a congregation -- but without 
drawing undue attention, said George Barna, president of the group. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-four percent of those surveyed said they would not like to be identified 
during the service as visitors, including 47% who said they would "dislike it a 
lot." Only 23% said they would like a church to do that, 10% said it would not 
matter and 2% had no opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Six out of 10 people also said they would not want to wear a name tag, Barna 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Most "unchurched" people, as non-members are termed by church leaders, would 
rather remain anonymous during the service, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Many unchurched people are uncomfortable returning to church," Barna said. 
"They don't know anyone in the congregation, they don't know the traditions of 
the church, they're often not sure what to expect next in the service -- and 
then suddenly they become the focus of the entire congregation." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, 74% said they would would like to be provided written 
information about the church, its beliefs and programs. 
</P>
<P>
And 67% said they would like it if church members greeted them individually 
after the service. Only 19% said they disliked the idea. 
</P>
<P>
The findings are part of a larger study on Americans who do not attend church, 
Barna said. 
</P>
<P>
CONFERENCE 
</P>
<P>
Islamic teachings on marriage and family life will be examined at a three-day 
conference starting at 8 a.m. Friday at the Stouffer Concourse Hotel in Los 
Angeles. Sponsored by the Masjid As-Salaam, a 200-member, predominantly 
African-Americans mosque, "The Making of the Muslim Family" will cover topics 
such as mate selection, marital obligations and rights, children's rights, 
divorce and abortion. Speakers will include Abu-Bekr Ali, president of Pacific 
Psychotherapy Associates, and Muzammil Siddiqi of the Islamic Society of Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
DATES 
</P>
<P>
For the seventh straight year, a Pentecostal congregation in La Verne will 
provide a free Thanksgiving meal this Sunday after its 11 a.m. service at the 
Los Angeles County Fairgrounds in Pomona. Clothing and shoes will also be 
distributed to the needy. The House of Praise pastor, the Rev. John Pereda, 
said the meal will be served in Building 8 at the fairgrounds, also known as 
the Fairplex. The congregation, which a spokesman said is leaving the 
Assemblies of God to become independent, will also hold a concert at the 
fairground facility at 8 p.m., featuring the South African group Jabulani. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Britten's "The Company of Heaven," a 50-minute work interspersed with 
readings and performed only twice before in the United States, will be 
performed in a concert at 4 p.m. Sunday at Pasadena Presbyterian Church. A 
50-voice choir and orchestra will be conducted by Steve Pilkington, music 
director at the church. Donations of $5 per person will be asked at the door. 
</P>
<P>
The annual meeting of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Greater 
Los Angeles on Monday will feature a panel discussion by community leaders on 
nonviolent ways to combat the drug crisis. State Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los 
Angeles) and the Rev. Richard Horton, pastor of the Eternal Promise Baptist 
Church, are among the speakers. The membership meeting, which starts at 7 p.m., 
will be at Faith United Methodist Church in Los Angeles. JOHN DART

SOUTHON'S JAZZ STYLE CAN COOL TO EXCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ROSENBLUTH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like an air conditioner stuck on high, Sonny Southon's cool-jazz stylings are 
first gratifyingly refreshing, but soon become uncomfortably excessive. 
</P>
<P>
At the Roxy on Thursday, the New Zealand native presented an hour's worth of 
half-good songs, culled primarily from her debut album, "Falling Through a 
Cloud." 
</P>
<P>
Just as a melody would assert itself, her two drummers and one very loud 
percussionist would kick up a sort of generic ethno-beat that overwhelmed her 
voice and invariably meandered on for too long. 
</P>
<P>
When the band (which also included a bassist, guitarist and two back-up 
singers) was kept in check, some provocative songs emerged that could give Sade 
a run for her money on the adult contemporary charts. Southon's spritely tunes 
bely profoundly dark lyrics about prostitution, heroin addiction, the futility 
of life and the like. It's a wonder that she was able to smile. 
</P>
<P>
Her vocalizing has a muffled huskiness to it, as if she were singing through a 
surgical mask. The affect is subtly sexy, a perfect complement to her overt 
physical beauty, which she sets off well with a peculiar sort of hand jive and 
fluid dance steps. Southon may not yet have a handle on a workable musical 
personality, but at least she looks like a star. That's often half the battle.

INDEPENDENT GEAR DADDIES AT WHISKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the leader of a young Minneapolis-area band was trying to be super-cool in 
his group's Los Angeles debut, he might throw in an overlooked Bob Dylan song 
or obscure Paul Westerberg tune to document his savvy rock tastes. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Gear Daddies' Martin Zellar augmented his own songs Thursday night 
at the Whisky with a well-known hit by Neil Diamond, a move that caused about 
half the audience to assume initially that it was a joke. No one has called 
Diamond hip in a long time and Minneapolis bands are known for sly, irreverent 
wit. 
</P>
<P>
But it was soon clear from Zellar's gently affectionate rendition of "Sweet 
Caroline" -- one of many wonderfully appealing songs Diamond wrote early in his 
career -- that he wasn't trying to be humorous. 
</P>
<P>
Zellar was, however, sending out a signal that the Gear Daddies are an 
independent bunch -- prone to take chances. And it wasn't the only sign in the 
40-minute set that suggested this is a band with integrity and vision. 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't much flash about the group -- even by often anti-glitter 
college/alternative rock standards. They didn't attack the stage with a 
feverish intensity or play at break-neck, post-punk speed. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they performed the songs with a natural, almost back-porch demeanor 
that underscored the convincing observations about trying to sort out some of 
life's everyday complications. 
</P>
<P>
"Sweet Caroline" -- an endearing celebration of good times after some bad ones 
-- isn't the kind of song that Zellar would write. 
</P>
<P>
He tends to write songs that James Dean might have favored if he had ever led a 
rock group: lean, melodic, almost understated tales of wondering why you don't 
fit in and trying to figure out if you ever will -- tales that often involve 
fractured relationships. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I feel sick and I feel used / You ain't the boy I thought I knew," he 
sings in one song. He adds in another, "I don't want to wear your crown / 
'Cause I'd only let you down." Yet elsewhere, he pleads, "Don't give up on me 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, a young band with a new, just-released album would make sure it 
crammed as many songs as possible from the album into its performance. Tours 
are designed to promote the album, right? 
</P>
<P>
But Zellar and the Gear Daddies -- whose soulful, stripped-down approach 
combines the softer moments of the Replacements with a bit of the country 
coloring of the early BoDeans' albums -- didn't concentrate on songs from the 
album. 
</P>
<P>
Opening for the far more energetic and much-admired Soul Asylum (whose latest 
A&amp;M album is a hit on the alternative-radio circuit and who'll open for the 
Pixies on Dec. 13 at the Universal Amphitheatre), the Gear Daddies came across 
almost as a tortoise in a rock world more accustomed to hares. 
</P>
<P>
But there is a growing yearning in the rock community for new voices and 
approaches, and this is a potentially great band -- one whose underlying sense 
of heart and craft may eventually make it one of the winners of the '90s.

EINSTURZENDE NEUBAUTEN TRIMS ITS HARD ROCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Einsturzende Neubauten has cut way back on the hardware. At the German band's 
concert at Helter Skelter on Thursday -- a rare L.A. appearance that was a big 
event for the local sonic underground -- there was little of its trademark 
arsenal: No chain saws or air hammers, no incendiary activity. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the group spoofed its pyrotechnic past, dousing the stage with fluid 
from a gasoline can and striking a match before revealing, "Is vater!" Funny 
guys. 
</P>
<P>
There was one power-drill solo on the amplified spring set-up, a shower of 
sparks from a sanding wheel, some pipes to pound on the floor. But essentially, 
the veteran band showed that it doesn't need heavy machinery to construct its 
harrowing environments -- just a front line of bass, guitar and vocals, backed 
by an assortment of electronics. It helped that the beats, whether driving and 
danceable or slow and ominous, were the product of people hitting things with 
sticks rather than keying a computer. 
</P>
<P>
Blixa Bargeld, looking like a tortured, punk-rock Baryshnikov, sang 
passionately in German, but no translation was necessary for the chaos and 
disintegration depicted in his four colleagues' panoramas of pain: Pounding, 
industrial disco and jaw-dropping storms of whooshing, squealing noise. The 
demolition derby peaked with a fluttering rumble that put fissures in your 
collarbone, gripped your throat so you couldn't swallow and seemed to lift you 
off the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Einsturzende Neubauten (rough translation: "collapsing new buildings") is the 
indisputable, defining force of its genre. Time and familiarity might have 
dulled the novelty, but in today's world, its combination of Germanic torment 
and Dada defiance still rings true. RICHARD CROMELIN

NEA CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My heartfelt appreciation to the anonymous Costa Mesa woman who gave $10,000 to 
the Grove Shakespeare Festival. 
</P>
<P>
But what a sad commentary it is on the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
None of the controversy over NEA funding would have happened if the endowment 
had been spending its money wisely. Why can a woman who smears food on her 
naked body get funding when a Shakespeare festival can't? 
</P>
<P>
Our government should support the arts by helping to find the artist in us all 
-- by funding programs that put poets, painters, writers and dancers in the 
schools; by helping cities fund plays and concerts in our parks; by supporting 
teaching inner-city youth to paint murals instead of graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Let experimental art and the private performance artists get funding elsewhere. 
Let the government fund truly "public art."

LITTLE FROM LITTLE

Jess Bravin's comedy review ("Rich Little Makes a Weak Impression," Nov. 13) 
was "right on target." 
</P>
<P>
With an audience composed of citizens who worked diligently to raise funds for 
some 40 charities, he should be ashamed of his performance. 
</P>
<P>
In his rote presentation of "old" material, not once did he seem in contact 
with his audience. His eyes were closed most of the time. I sincerely doubt he 
could find a valid excuse for such a dismal performance. 
</P>
<P>
Bravin was indeed correct about Julie Budd -- she was absolutely marvelous and, 
in addition, donated funds from the sale of her new album to the buyer's 
charity choice. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Little should have stayed home.

HOLD THE APPLAUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not content with merely clapping between movements, the Pacific Symphony 
patrons have now taken to clapping during movements. 
</P>
<P>
At the Nov. 7 concert, Carl St. Clair and the Pacific Symphony turned out a 
crackling performance of Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, it was twice interrupted with unwelcome applause, once after the 
close of the second movement and again in the fourth movement, where 
Tchaikovsky foolishly intruded a brief pause before the final statement. 
Tchaikovsky should have known better than to tempt our audience with the 
briefest moment of silence. 
</P>
<P>
Since we can't do anything about composers who want to pencil in moments of 
silence, perhaps we can aid the audience. I propose the following eight rules 
on when to clap and, more pertinently, when not to clap: 
</P>
<P>
1. When in doubt, don't. 
</P>
<P>
2. If the conductor still has his hands in the air, keep yours in your lap. 
</P>
<P>
3. Count the movements listed in the program, and don't clap between them. 
</P>
<P>
4. Catch the mood. 
</P>
<P>
5. Wait for the climax. 
</P>
<P>
6. Listen for resolution. 
</P>
<P>
7. Let the sound die before clapping. 
</P>
<P>
8. Ignore your neighbor -- he or she probably doesn't have any better idea of 
when to clap than you do. 
</P>
<P>
As evidenced by Wednesday's concert, the Pacific Symphony Orchestra has grown 
into a first-class orchestra. Let's become a first-class audience.

PHONE STOCKS DIVE AS LONG-DISTANCE FIRMS FEEL SQUEEZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Telephone company stocks plunged Friday, with MCI Communications losing a full 
one-fourth of its value amid growing investor concern that the nation's 
long-distance carriers could falter under the strain of increasing competition 
and a slipping economy. 
</P>
<P>
MCI's stock fell a whopping $7.375 per share Friday to close at $22.625 in 
over-the-counting trading, leaving it with a massive two-day loss of about 29%. 
The stock had fallen $1.875 per share Thursday in anticipation of news released 
later that day that the firm would lay off up to 1,500 workers over the next 
six months in a consolidation aimed at trimming costs and coping with 
escalating competition from archrival American Telephone &amp; Telegraph. 
</P>
<P>
MCI, the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier, also had acknowledged 
Thursday for the first time that its once-soaring revenue growth -- which had 
made its stock an investor favorite -- has slowed as a result of the economy's 
drop and more aggressive consumer marketing from AT&amp;T. 
</P>
<P>
MCI's stock plunge also pulled down the stocks of AT&amp;T and United Telecom. 
AT&amp;T, the nation's most widely held stock, dropped $1.125 per share on 
Friday to close at $32. It was the most active issue on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with more than 3.7 million shares changing hands. United Telecom, the 
majority owner of US Sprint, the No. 3 long-distance carrier, fell $2.875 per 
share to close at $22.50. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the problem for the carriers, analysts said, is the slowing growth 
of the long-distance market caused by recession fears, primarily among jittery 
and cost-conscious consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the Big Three are already involved in a major and costly fight to 
steal residential-service market share from one another to compensate for 
slowing overall market growth. And they predicted that the fight -- which 
AT&amp;T is dominating so far -- would escalate, increasing marketing costs and 
eroding profits. 
</P>
<P>
The current situation underscores how dependent long-distance carriers have 
become on rapidly increasing telephone usage for their revenue growth -- and 
how their operations can teeter when the growth rate slows. 
</P>
<P>
Long-distance phone use has grown steadily every year since the end of World 
War II, growing dramatically in the last five years. However, usage charges 
have steadily declined since 1984 with the opening of competition into what was 
once AT&amp;T's monopoly market. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Americans' long-distance usage has doubled in six years, totaling 
75.2 billion minutes between April and June of this year, compared to only 37.5 
billion minutes from July through September of 1984, according to Federal 
Communications Commission records. 
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, the cost of a five-minute call from Los Angeles to 
Washington fell to $1.24 this year from $2.70 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Mariane Bye, a telecommunications analyst at Shearson Lehman Bros. in New York, 
said Wall Street became nervous after MCI executives gave analysts a gloomy 
outlook for the final three months of the year in a private briefing late 
Thursday. The company told analysts that October revenue was stagnant and 
fourth-quarter revenue might not exceed that of the third period, Bye said. 
</P>
<P>
Bye said the warning about a flat fourth quarter was immediately interpreted as 
an admission from MCI that its market share is falling. That's because the 
fourth period will include a full three months of revenue from Telecom U.S.A., 
MCI's recent acquisition, while the third period included only a portion of the 
newly acquired company's sales. 
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared for a very tough quarter," Bye said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said MCI's slowing revenue demonstrates the impact of AT&amp;T's newly 
aggressive campaign to regain market share that it has steadily lost to MCI and 
US Sprint since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"AT&amp;T has drawn a line in the sand, and it will cost everyone a ton of 
money to cross that line," Jack Grubman, an analyst at Paine Webber in New 
York, told news services. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Gabbard, MCI's chief financial officer, said the carrier's residential 
customers are making fewer long-distance calls and business usage has not 
increased to cover the slack. "The competition and negative advertising is 
having an impact on us," he said in an interview.

CARL'S JR., SEEKING GROWTH, WILL INCREASE FRANCHISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE MICHAUD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to fuel expansion, Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc. said Friday that 
it plans to sell 57 company-owned Carl's Jr. restaurants in Northern California 
to franchisees over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said franchising will allow Carl's to expand faster in Northern 
California because franchisees will pay for new construction. 
</P>
<P>
But the plan depends on Carl's ability to arrange financing for its 
franchisees, according to a restaurant consultant. 
</P>
<P>
"Our franchise strategy will greatly enhance the company's long-term growth, 
spread the challenge of developing properties and raising capital, and cushion 
the volatility of economic cycles," said President and Chief Operating Officer 
Donald F. Karcher. 
</P>
<P>
All Carl's Jr. restaurants from Lompoc north to Ukiah will be sold to 
franchisees. The buyers will be asked to open an additional 80 restaurants in 
Northern California in the next five to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The economic times in the restaurant industry being what they are, restaurants 
are trying to do all they can to keep afloat and growing," said Janet Lowder, 
owner of Restaurant Management Services, a Rancho Palos Verdes consulting firm. 
"It's a great opportunity to get into a franchise now, but Carl's better have 
financing (for expansion) lined up for the people coming in." 
</P>
<P>
Karcher's proportion of franchised restaurants -- 23% -- is low by fast food 
industry standards, Lowder said. The company hopes to increase the proportion 
to 40% in the next four or five years. 
</P>
<P>
Robert W. Wisely, a former marketing director for the company, already has 
bought a six-restaurant franchise in Northern California. Another sale is 
pending, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Karcher's stock, which closed Friday unchanged at $6.50, is considered 
undervalued by some analysts.

Milken, 44, pleaded guilty in April to six felonies. He faces a maximum 
sentence of 28 years in prison. The sentencing originally had been set for Oct. 
1, but was postponed so that Judge Wood could hear evidence to help her decide

GENERAL DYNAMICS UNIT PLANS TO LAY OFF 450 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing the poor outlook for defense contracts, General Dynamics said Friday 
that it will lay off 450 employees at its Electronics division, a 15% cut in 
jobs at the San Diego-based unit and one of the biggest single layoffs in San 
Diego this year. 
</P>
<P>
The division's principal line of business is making test equipment for military 
aircraft such as the F-16 fighter, the C-17 military cargo aircraft and the B-1 
bomber. As aircraft orders have fallen off, so has demand for General Dynamics' 
test equipment, hence the decision to cut jobs, spokeswoman Julie Andrews said. 
The division employs 3,000 workers in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The layoffs will be across the board, from salaried executives to hourly 
workers on assembly lines. The cuts will take effect starting at the end of 
January. The individuals losing their jobs will be notified after the 
Thanksgiving holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Electronics division was hit with severe cost overruns 
related to its SINCGARS hand-held radio used by U.S. Army ground troops to 
communicate with airborne units. The overruns caused General Dynamics to take a 
$50-million writeoff, a charge that contributed to the defense firm's 
$240-million second-quarter loss, the largest in its history. 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics' Andrews said the troubled radio contract had no direct 
bearing on the company's decision to reduce its payroll, however. "We are 
seeing the reality of the defense downturn at General Dynamics. . . . Layoffs 
in our industry have not been that infrequent lately. We are downsizing to meet 
what we expect will be declining revenues." 
</P>
<P>
The layoffs are the latest of a succession in the state's aerospace industry 
this year, as contractors have been buffeted by defense spending cutbacks. As 
of last month, total aerospace employment in California was 335,000 -- down 
18,000 from the start of 1990, according to the UCLA Business Forecast Project. 
Another 17,000 aerospace jobs will be lost in the state next year, UCLA 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics also said Friday that it was laying off 60 of its 8,910 
Convair Division employees over the next two months. San Diego-based Convair, 
which makes the Tomahawk Cruise missile, laid off 40 employees earlier this 
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
Andrew P. Solt, 74, playwright and screenwriter who co-wrote the 1948 film 
"Joan of Arc." 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian-born writer, known to friends as "Bundy," came to Hollywood in 
1939 to convert his internationally successful play, "They All Kissed the 
Bride," for film. He wrote a series of hit films in the 1940s, including

St. Paul wide receiver Mickey Foster caught two passes, both for touchdowns, to 
lead the Swordsmen to a 21-8 victory over Orange in the first round of the 
Division III football playoffs Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul (6-3-2) will meet Beverly Hills next weekend in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
Foster's second catch, for a five-yard touchdown on the first play of the 
fourth quarter, gave St. Paul a commanding a 21-0 lead minutes after Orange 
wide receiver Mark Lightfoot dropped a potential touchdown pass on a 
fourth-down play from the St. Paul 15. 
</P>
<P>
St. Paul took over, and quarterback Albert Borunda connected with wide receiver 
Ricky O'Campo on a 62-yard pass to set up the final touchdown. Borunda was four 
for seven for 122 yards and the two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end Richard Gonzales led the St. Paul defense with three sacks of 
Orange's Josh Beloysky. The Panthers (5-5-1) managed just 156 yards in offense, 
half on their final drive to a touchdown with three minutes remaining. Acen 
Chiles, who led Orange with 56 yards rushing, scored from five yards out. 
</P>
<P>
Foster also caught a 52-yard touchdown pass to open the scoring in the first 
quarter.

David McDivitt and Jim Zopelis each scored two touchdowns in Canyon Country 
Canyon High School's 40-0 victory over Westminster in a first-round Division I 
game Friday at Westminster High. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon (10-1) advanced to the second round against Bishop Amat, a 31-13 winner 
over Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
"Canyon is a real disciplined team," Westminster Coach Stan Clark said. "Our 
defense couldn't stop them and our offense couldn't get on track. 
</P>
<P>
"We prefer to run the ball and Canyon took that option away from us." 
</P>
<P>
Westminster (5-5-1) was held to 107 yards rushing in 35 carries. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions' passing game didn't fare much better. Three quarterbacks completed 
four of 19 passes for 60 yards. Canyon's defense sacked two of Westminster's 
three quarterbacks six times. 
</P>
<P>
The lone bright spot for Westminster was the defensive play of Vance Senteno, 
who had a sack, an interception and recovered a Canyon fumble. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon rushed for 170 yards in 40 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Bialas completed 10 of 18 passes for 222 yards and two touchdowns -- including

EDISON FIZZLES, 44-19, AGAINST RUBIDOUX AND SECRET WEAPON

<P>
Edison High School's dream of winning a Southern Section championship fizzled 
fast Friday night, as Rubidoux shocked the Chargers with a 44-19 victory at 
Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
Rubidoux, which entered the game with a 4-6 record, never seemed the underdog, 
taking a 28-13 halftime lead and winning with impressive running, intense 
defense and a secret weapon named La Salle Hughey. 
</P>
<P>
Hughey, who missed three games this year with an ankle injury and was nowhere 
in the Rubidoux game films which Edison used to prepare, scored three 
touchdowns on his first three carries on runs of 41, 56, and 50 yards. 
</P>
<P>
But Hughey was just one of Rubidoux's weapons. Tracy Harris rushed for 146 
yards on 26 carries, scoring two touchdowns, and Marc Lewis added 76 yards and 
a touchdown on 13 carries. 
</P>
<P>
The loss overshadowed an impressive passing performance by Edison quarterback 
Josh Gingrich, who completed 27 of 47 passes for 394 yards and two touchdowns. 
Gingrich, whose output tied Andy Bielanski (Savanna, 1967) for the county's 
fourth-best single-game yardage, was also intercepted twice. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe (Rubidoux was) 4-6, I'll tell you that," Edison Coach Dave 
White said. "We didn't stop them. . . . They had four options and we didn't 
stop any of them. They just whipped us. We came ready to play, though." 
</P>
<P>
But was Edison, seeded fourth in the division, prepared for such an offensive 
onslaught from an underdog team? It's doubtful. The shocked looks on the 
Chargers were proof enough that this game was one they expected to win. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, they were real shocked, I think," Hughey said. "They thought they would 
take it all the way to the title game. But they didn't know about me, I doubt." 
</P>
<P>
Hughey scored on his team's first play from scrimmage, sprinting through a wide 
hole in the Edison line and outracing several defenders to the end zone. His 
second and third touchdown runs were similar. Said Rubidoux Coach Wayne 
Cochrun, whose team will meet Quartz Hill, a 49-14 winner over Long Beach 
Wilson, in next week's second round: "This was by far our biggest victory this 
year. Maybe they didn't look at who we played and who are losses were to, like 
Eisenhower, Fontana, Bishop Amat. . . . We felt all along we were more a 7-3 
team anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Edison's Greg Seybert was taken to Hoag Memorial Hospital in Newport Beach late 
in the fourth quarter after he suffered a concussion after being tackled during 
a punt return.

Esperanza High School's Jarod Smith rushed for 174 yards on just eight carries 
and scored three touchdowns to lead the Aztecs to a 47-0 romp over Alhambra 
Friday in the first round of the Division III playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza will face the winner of tonight's game between Crespi and Leuzinger 
in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
The Moors (4-7), the only team with a sub-.500 record in the Division III 
bracket, did not seriously challenge Esperanza (11-0), the No. 1 seed, after 
Smith took his first handoff from quarterback Keith McDonald and raced 85 yards 
for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
When the Moors attempted to punt on their next series of downs, the ball was 
snapped over the head of the punter and recovered by Esperanza at the Alhambra 
four. Garrick Emry scored on a two-yard run two plays later to put the Aztecs 
on top, 15-0. 
</P>
<P>
Things didn't get any better for Alhambra. On their next series, the Moors 
attempted to punt, but again the ball was snapped high and squirted through the 
end zone for a safety that gave Esperanza a 17-0 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald (five of 10 for 41 yards) passed for one touchdown of 16 yards to Reid 
Pullen. DENNIS KAISER

Steve Bresnahan hasn't made too many mistakes while coaching Laguna Hills High 
School quarterback Casey Sullivan this season. But Bresnahan admitted to a 
glitch that nearly proved disastrous Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan passed for two touchdowns as Laguna Hills held off a fourth-quarter 
St. Monica rally, 21-17, in the first round of the Division VII playoffs at 
Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks (9-1-1) advance to Friday's second round against San Marino. St. 
Monica ended the season at 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
Bresnahan took full blame for giving St. Monica life in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Uncomfortable with a 21-7 lead, Bresnahan called for Sullivan to roll out to 
the left for an option pass. There was only one problem -- Laguna Hills was at 
its three-yard line and Sullivan was sacked for a safety. 
</P>
<P>
After the safety, St. Monica went 41 yards with Na'il Benjamin scoring on a 
two-yard run that cut the deficit to 21-17 with 6 minutes 19 seconds left to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a brilliant call at the three-yard line," Bresnahan said. "I'll take 
credit for that. We were trying to get a big play. It was a gamble call." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Bresnahan, the Hawks' defense came up with some big plays in 
the final four minutes, keeping St. Monica from crossing midfield. 
</P>
<P>
"This wasn't our best game tonight," Bresnahan said, "but a lot of that had to 
do with the fact we were playing a good team." 
</P>
<P>
No one needed to tell that to Sullivan, who transferred from St. Monica last 
spring. He completed three of five passes for 80 yards, including touchdowns of 
60 and eight yards, against his former teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Marwan Saba added 97 yards in 17 carries and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
St. Monica scored on its first possession as James White capped a 17-play, 
64-yard drive with a four-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills tied the score, 7-7, with 1:21 left in the first quarter when Saba 
scored on a nine-yard run. Saba was a workhorse on the drive, carrying the ball 
six consecutive times for 59 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks used a different route to the end zone in the second quarter. 
Sullivan threw to a wide-open Sergio Jiminez for a 60-yard touchdown pass with 
10:23 left in the second quarter.

Despite 336 passing yards from sophomore Pat Barnes, Trabuco Hills lost to 
Gardena Serra, 34-21, Friday in the first round of the Division VII playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Serra, coached by former Servite Coach Leo Hand, won its ninth game of the 
season and its 23rd over two years. 
</P>
<P>
The division's top-seeded team was led by running back Jerald Henry's 344 yards 
and three touchdowns in 21 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Serra, which advances to meet La Mirada next weekend, took a 14-0 lead in the 
first quarter on two touchdown runs by Henry, the first a 76-yarder on the 
game's first play from scrimmage. The Mustangs (4-6-1) cut the lead in half on 
an eight-yard touchdown pass from Barnes to Jeff Clayton early in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
After the Cavaliers extended their advantage to 20-7, Trabuco Hills got 
touchdowns from Ben Rooker (4-yard run) and Julian Bond (32-yard pass from 
Barnes) to take a 21-20 lead with 9:14 to go in the third quarter. DAVID RAATZ

Quarterback Chris Castellano connected with wide receiver Scott Lesser on a 
five-yard pass play with 6 minutes 59 seconds remaining to give Pacifica High 
School a 24-20 victory over Fullerton in a Division VI first-round playoff game 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Pacifica (8-3) advances to a second-round game next weekend against Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
Pacifica took a 2-0 lead on a safety when Fullerton's David Chacon fielded a 
punt at his own one-yard line and tried to escape the Mariner coverage by 
running around the end zone, only to be met by Pacifica's Kevin Harbour. 
</P>
<P>
But Fullerton (8-3) responded with two touchdowns, taking a 14-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians scored on a nine-yard run by David Chacon and on a one-yard bootleg 
by his twin brother, quarterback Daniel Chacon. 
</P>
<P>
David Chacon set up the second Fullerton touchdown by intercepting a Castellano 
pass at the Fullerton 35-yard line and returning it 51 yards. 
</P>
<P>
But Pacifica closed the gap to 14-9 on a one-yard keeper by Castellano with 39 
seconds left in the half. That touchdown came aftera pass interference and a 
personal foul call against David Chacon, who was playing safety, on a pass 
intended for Lesser. The penalties gave Pacifica a first-and-10 at the 
Fullerton 14. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton continued the see-saw battle with a three-yard touchdown run by D.C. 
Olsen in the third quarter, but Pacifica mounted its final, decisive comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Pacifica's Derek Nicholson, who had 66 yards in 17 carries, scored from two 
yards out, and Castellano hit Chris Maroney on the two-point conversion to cut 
Fullerton's lead to 20-17. 
</P>
<P>
Four minutes later, Castellano connected with Lesser for the winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Castellano completed 14 of 20 passes for 138 yards, but was intercepted three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Chacon was 12 of 24 for 167 yards.

Orange Lutheran High School defeated Cantwell, 27-14, in a first-round Division 
IX playoff game Friday night at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers advance to a second-round game against Tehachapi. 
</P>
<P>
Cantwell quarterback Jimmy Cortinas passed for 105 yards and two touchdowns in 
one quarter before being injured in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Cortinas' passing was a nightmare for Orange Lutheran (9-2). He threw 
a 45-yard scoring pass to Danny Alsala for Cantwell's first touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran tied the score on Lenny Gavin's quarterback sneak, but the 
Cardinals wasted no time coming back. 
</P>
<P>
Cortinas again went to his wide receivers, passing 48 yards to Matt Asato to 
help put Cantwell ahead, 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran soon turned to a running game. Behind strong blocks, Gavin 
scrambled 54 yards for the longest touchdown of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a minute later, the Cardinals fumbled on their own 25, and Lancer 
lineman Brad Darling scooped up the ball and ran it in, putting Orange Lutheran 
in front, 21-14. 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, another Cantwell fumble put the Lancers in position to 
score. Running back Brandon Orman, who had 48 yards on eight carries, broke two 
tackles and went 25 yards for Orange Lutheran's final touchdown. MARGIE LUCK

In a rematch of last year's final, Corona del Mar High School will meet Mira 
Costa in the Southern Section 5-A girls' volleyball championship match tonight 
at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded Sea Kings (23-1) have a 21-match winning streak and are ranked 
fourth nationally by Volleyball Monthly magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar hasn't won a section title in girls' volleyball since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Sixth-seeded Mira Costa (20-1) advanced to the final with a five-game victory 
over El Toro in the semifinals. Mira Costa defeated Corona del Mar in last 
year's final. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings are led by senior middle blocker Lara Carlsen and senior outside 
hitter Tracy Schriber. 
</P>
<P>
The Division 3-A final will feature the only undefeated teams in Orange County 
-- top-seeded La Habra (18-0) and third-seeded El Modena (18-0). The match will 
start at 3:30 p.m., also at Cerritos College. MIKE REILLEY

CAMARILLO STUNS GLENDALE, 33-8 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It took only 14 seconds, but Glendale High felt the effects of Brian Vellmure's 
73-yard opening kickoff return for the entire game in a 33-8 loss to Camarillo 
on Friday night in the first round of the Southern Section Division II playoffs 
at Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Vellmure faked a reverse to Fahali Campbell on the kickoff and ran down the 
left sideline to give Camarillo a 7-0 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo (8-3), which placed fourth in the Marmonte League and received an 
at-large berth, scored on its first four possessions and led, 33-0, at halftime 
over third-seeded Glendale (10-1). 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't intimidated," said Campbell, a sophomore running back who rushed 
for 126 yards in nine carries, including a 77-yard touchdown run, to spearhead 
the Camarillo wishbone. "We've played some good teams and we felt we could play 
with anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo's Corey Tucker and Tag Johnson rushed for 59 and 47 yards, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale running back Pathon Rucker, who ended the season with 1,878 yards, 
carried 19 times for 102 yards, but Glendale, which came into the game 
averaging 371 rushing yards, was limited to only 85 yards on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale quarterback Eric Kiesau (seven of 23 for 70 yards), threw only one 
interception during the regular season but threw two Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker returned a Kiesau interception 28 yards to the Glendale six-yard line 
that set up his own two-yard touchdown run that gave Camarillo a 33-0 lead with 
58 seconds left before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you get a break like we did at the start, the momentum just starts to go 
your way," Camarillo Coach Carl Thompson said. "We just played our standard 
defense and I felt if we stopped Rucker, we would be all right. I'd rather have 
them pass than let him carry the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale, which had outscored its opponents, 320-81, entering the contest and 
had not allowed more than 21 points in a game, scored its first touchdown late 
in the third quarter. Kiesau threw a short pass to Tim Hilton, who flipped the 
ball to Rucker, who ran 20 yards down the right sideline for his 31st touchdown 
of the season. Rucker added the two-point conversion to make it 33-8. 
</P>
<P>
After Vellmure's opening score, Rucker returned the ensuing kickoff 31 yards to 
the Glendale 44. The Dynamiters, aided by a 38-yard Rucker run, drove to the 
Camarillo 12, but Hector Maya was stopped for no gain on fourth and two and 
Camarillo took over on downs. 
</P>
<P>
Five plays later, Campbell ran 77 yards to give the Scorpions a 13-0 lead with 
5 minutes 43 seconds to play in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo took over on the Glendale 28 after a short punt by Bill Tuttle. Seven 
plays later, Johnson plunged in from one yard to increase the margin to 19-0 
with 1:01 left in the first period.

BAKERSFIELD FOILS PIERCE UPSET BID IN 38-35 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In Bob Enger's final game as the Pierce College football coach, he came within 
a second of a masterminding a stunning upset of Bakersfield, the No. 1 team in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield turned back the Brahmas, 38-35, on a 47-yard field goal by Jon 
Baker with one second left Friday night at Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
A 42-yard field-goal attempt by Pierce's Steve Szekely fell far short with 25 
seconds left. Bakersfield then drove 45 yards in the next 24 seconds to set up 
the winning field goal in the Western State Conference finale. 
</P>
<P>
"This was our best offensive effort, and I thought it was a courageous 
defensive effort," Enger said. "I just was real proud of my kids." 
</P>
<P>
Pierce pulled ahead, 35-28, with 6:38 left when D. J. Vlaming plunged in from a 
yard for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
David Dunn returned the ensuing kickoff 61 yards and Bakersfield tied the score 
on a one-yard run by Nathan Dupree slightly more than two minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce quarterback Jamie Grossman kept Bakersfield defenders on their heels, 
completing 19 of 30 passes for 288 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman's favorite targets were Carlton Bowen, who had six catches for 70 
yards, and Jay Rich, who caught seven for 123. 
</P>
<P>
LaShante Parker added 115 yards and a touchdown in 19 carries for Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield was led by the running tandem of Dupree and Shon Ellerbe. Dupree 
finished with 196 yards in 27 carries and Ellerbe had 111 in 18. Both finished 
with more than 1,000 rushing yards on the season. 
</P>
<P>
Each scored a touchdown within the first seven minutes of the second half to 
put Bakersfield ahead, 21-14, but Pierce refused to fold. 
</P>
<P>
"We did get down for a little bit," Enger said. "We talked about how this could 
go to 90 (Bakersfield points) or we could suck it up." 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield improved to 10-0 overall, 9-0 in conference play and 5-0 in 
division play. Pierce is 4-6, 4-5, 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce led, 14-7, at the half, the first time this season the Renegades have 
trailed at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce jumped to a 7-0 lead on its first possession and Bakersfield found 
itself trailing for only the third time this season. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce marched 76 yards for its first touchdown and Grossman capped the drive 
when he rolled right on a play-action pass and hit Arie McQuaig for a five-yard 
touchdown at the 7:23 mark.

WFC COACHES JUDGED FANN ON MORE THAN NUMBERS IN BESTOWING HONOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Western Football Conference coaches don't play by the numbers. How else to 
explain their selection of Cal State Northridge tailback Albert Fann as the 
conference's offensive player of the year? 
</P>
<P>
Fann was not the leading rusher in the WSC. He wasn't second or third, either. 
His season statistics show 918 yards rushing in 10 games and a modest average 
of 4.1 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
Good statistics but nothing Fann-tabulous. Most people expected better. Most 
people expected too much. 
</P>
<P>
Fann is, after all, a celebrity among the masses playing Division II football. 
His picture made national magazines, his story was told on television, his name 
was penned high on the lists of professional scouts. 
</P>
<P>
The attention made him a marked man from the opening kickoff against Northern 
Arizona. "Take that Mr. Harlon Hill," linebackers muttered as they raked cleats 
over Fann's limbs after a tackle. 
</P>
<P>
How easy it is to forget that Fann runs behind a line with only one player who 
had four-year college experience before this season, or that Northridge lacks a 
consistent passing threat, or that opponents often stack 10 defenders within 
five yards of scrimmage to stop the run. 
</P>
<P>
Since the second game of the season, Fann has played on a torn left hamstring 
muscle. Small wonder that his longest run of the season is a mere 32 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Then, three weeks ago, while rushing for 134 yards in 26 carries against Santa 
Clara, Fann's right ankle was injured. He tried to play the following week in 
the WFC championship game against San Luis Obispo but was "held" to 34 yards in 
11 carries and the Matadors lost, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Fann credited a tough Mustang defense and. . . . oh, never mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm playing with injuries, but that's no excuse because it's part of the 
game," Fann said after a practice this week. "I've learned I can play with 
certain injuries and still be effective. Then there are other times you've just 
got to say no." 
</P>
<P>
Like last week against Cal State Long Beach. Fann suited up but only to return 
kickoffs. He took back three kicks for 58 yards, giving him 7,032 all-purpose 
yards in his career -- more than Tony Dorsett had. Fann became only the fifth 
player in NCAA history to surpass the 7,000-yard milestone. 
</P>
<P>
Now that's a stat. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody thinks stats tell who's the best player, but stats doesn't have 
anything to do with it," Fann said. "I help my team win. That's what's most 
important." 
</P>
<P>
Opposing coaches agreed. They made Fann the WFC's first four-time, first-team 
all-conference selection and two-time offensive player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Fann's numbers don't jibe with the award but the coaches saw past that. In 
CSUN's five most important games, he rushed for more than 125 yards in all but 
one, the showdown against San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
And that is the statistic of which Fann is most aware. 
</P>
<P>
He says his hamstring injury has healed somewhat and that his ankle is "almost 
100%." CSUN and San Luis Obispo will meet today in the first round of the 
Division II playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully I can show them what the real Albert Fann looks like," he said. "It 
should be a lot different game from my standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
If so, the result should be different for Northridge. When Fann has rushed for 
100 or more yards this season, the Matadors are 5-0. The other times, they are 
2-3. 
</P>
<P>
Second helping: In Division II football, familiarity has bred contempt -- for 
the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to cut down on transportation costs, the NCAA regionalized the Division 
II football playoffs. But in doing so it all but ruined the postseason 
experience for most teams. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, co-champions of the Western Football 
Conference, will meet today for the second time in 15 days. "I felt the 
committee would try to keep one of us out," said Lyle Setencich, San Luis 
Obispo's coach. "This way they eliminate at least one from the West." 
</P>
<P>
Such bitterness was echoed around the nation. Seems that the Matadors and the 
Mustangs aren't the only ones who were forced into a first-round rematch. 
</P>
<P>
Squaring off in the South region are North Alabama and Jacksonville (Ala.) 
State of the Gulf South Conference; in the Midwest, Missouri Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference rivals Pittsburg (Kan.) State and Northeast Missouri will 
meet again; and on the other side of the West bracket, North Dakota State and 
Northern Colorado of the North Central Intercollegiate Athletic Conference will 
play for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
Two thumbs up: Travis Peterson had an average game last Saturday. It was the 
players who surround him on the Glendale College offensive line who turned in 
superlative performances. 
</P>
<P>
In a 45-21 upset of Moorpark, Vaquero running backs rushed for 366 yards. This 
against what was the state's top-rated junior college defense against the run. 
In eight previous games, the Raiders had allowed only 496 yards on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an incredible film," Coach John Cicuto said after watching reruns of 
the game. "I was surprised we handled them so easily. I've never seen the line 
block so well." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not as a whole. However, for Peterson, a 6-foot-3, 265-pound guard, the 
outing was typical. "From a guy who never played at all last year, he has 
developed into a phenomenal player," Cicuto said. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly: Why did Moorpark Coach Jim Bittner panic last week when the Raiders 
fell behind against Glendale? After the Vaqueros jumped to an early lead, 
Bittner fell away from what Moorpark does best -- hand the ball to Freddie 
Bradley, and instead relied heavily on the passing game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of panicking, what was CSUN Coach Bob Burt thinking last week when he 
asked Abo Velasco to attempt a 65-yard field goal with 13 seconds remaining in 
the Matadors' 25-24 loss to Cal State Long Beach? The longest kick of Velasco's 
career is 50 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The ball was on target but landed at the three-yard line, about 20 yards short. 
"We had the wind with us. You roll the dice," Burt said. "He was kicking them 
that far in practice." A few days later, Burt had a different explanation. "I 
blew it," he said.

Royal High blew a seven-point, fourth-quarter lead and fell to Downey, 17-10, 
Friday night in a first-round Southern Section Division II playoff game at 
Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore quarterback Johnny Macon threw a 52-yard touchdown pass to running 
back Ron Martin with three minutes to play to give the Vikings the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Macon's 25-yard touchdown run three minutes earlier had tied the score, 10-10. 
</P>
<P>
Macon also scored the only first-quarter points for Downey (8-3), the 
second-place entrant from the San Gabriel Valley League, on a 27-yard field 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
Royal (8-2-1), the second-place team in the Marmonte League, drove 61 yards in 
six plays on its first possession, scoring on a 36-yard touchdown pass from 
quarterback Ryan Fien to wide receiver Jeff Creed. 
</P>
<P>
Royal had to settle for Steve Prchal's 32-yard field goal and a 10-3 lead early 
in the second quarter after an illegal-procedure penalty nullified Robbie 
Smith's five-yard scoring run. 
</P>
<P>
Royal punter Richard Naranjo kept Downey pinned deep in its own territory in 
the first half, forcing the Vikings to begin second-quarter drives at their 
nine- and seven-yard lines. 
</P>
<P>
Fien completed 17 of 26 passes for 162 yards and threw one interception. Creed 
caught six passes for 93 yards. The Highlanders managed only 36 yards rushing.

ARREOLA LOOKING FOR FAST FINISH; 
</P>
<P>
CROSS-COUNTRY: NORTHRIDGE SENIOR EXPRESSES DISAPPOINTMENT WITH HER SEASON 
HEADING INTO DIVISION I CHAMPIONSHIPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No Cal State Northridge athlete appeared as prepared for the move from the NCAA 
Division II ranks to Division I this fall as distance runner Darcy Arreola. 
</P>
<P>
Arreola, the 1989 Division II cross-country champion, had won three individual 
Division II track titles, had earned nine Division II All-American certificates 
in track and cross-country, and had placed third in the 1,500 meters in the 
1989 Division I track championships since arriving at Northridge in five years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
This cross-country season, however, has been frustrating for Arreola, who will 
compete in the NCAA Division I championships at Pine Lakes Golf Course in 
Knoxville, Tenn., on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been disappointed," said Arreola, the lone Northridge qualifier for the 
national meet. "I think that's why I'm really looking forward to nationals and 
the end of the season. I know that's not the greatest attitude to have going 
into nationals, but I haven't won a race yet. And I haven't improved as much as 
I wanted to." Last season Arreola won four of five cross-country races, 
including the California Collegiate Athletic Assn., Division II West regional 
and Division II titles. 
</P>
<P>
This season she has finished second once, third twice and fourth twice. 
</P>
<P>
After falling behind in her races, Arreola has been forced to battle for second 
-- or worse. It is a notion as foreign to Arreola as liberalism is to 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the season began, I thought I had a chance at winning Division I," 
Arreola said. "But after (the) Stanford (Invitational), I started to realize 
that that probably won't happen." 
</P>
<P>
Arreola has had her best cross-country season -- lowering her personal best on 
the Stanford course by 39 seconds -- but after being a dominant force in 
Division II, she won't be one of the favorites when the women's 5,000-meter 
race begins at 11 a.m. (EST) Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to accept that I'm one of the unknowns," the 22-year-old Arreola 
said. "It puts less pressure on me, but it's hard to accept that you're not 
going to be one of the ones they're looking at. 
</P>
<P>
"In the school newspaper the other day, (Northridge Coach Don) Strametz said 
that a good goal would be the top 10. I saw that and said, 'Top 10?' But then I 
realized that I'm going to be running against a lot of good girls that I've 
never run against, and that a top-10 finish would probably be a good goal." 
</P>
<P>
Arreola, a fifth-year senior, was a well-beaten third in the Stanford 
Invitational on Oct. 6, 29 seconds behind winner Suzy Favor of Wisconsin and 22 
seconds behind Buffy Rabbitt of UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"Suzy was just so far ahead of me," Arreola recalled with a laugh. "And she 
probably won't be the No. 1 favorite on Monday." 
</P>
<P>
That role will fall to Michelle Dekkers of Indiana and South Africa, the 1988 
NCAA Division I champion who defeated Favor for the Big Ten and District 4 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
"Dekkers appears to be the favorite," Strametz said, "with (District 8 winner) 
Rabbitt looking for a finish in the top seven. . . . But a lot can happen in 
cross-country." 
</P>
<P>
Strametz linked Arreola's early-season difficulties to her 70-miles-a-week 
regimen, more than she has ever run before. 
</P>
<P>
"She was training through the meets," Strametz said. "She was racing tired. She 
was not as fresh as some of the people she was running against." 
</P>
<P>
Arreola, the 10th ranked 1,500-meter runner in the country in 1989, concurred 
with Strametz. 
</P>
<P>
"I kept telling myself, 'Don't worry about it. Just think about regionals and 
nationals, that's all that matters.' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Based on Arreola's fourth-place finish in the District 8 meet at Fresno's 
Woodward Park last week, Strametz figures that things are going according to 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
He has tapered Arreola's training to less than 50 miles a week, and with a 
little fine-tuning, he expects her to be firing on all cylinders Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"She ran her best race of the season at districts," he said. "But she's capable 
of running better. Physically, she was ready to run a great race at districts, 
but mentally she wasn't all there. 
</P>
<P>
"There were certain mental things that she didn't do, like accelerating out of 
the curves. If she runs a great mental race at districts, she runs 15-20 
seconds faster." 
</P>
<P>
The mental aspect of cross-country running is something that Arreola admittedly 
has never mastered. She made marked improvement in that area last season, but 
she has never been as aggressive in cross-country as in track. 
</P>
<P>
"You put her within 10 feet of a track during track season and she becomes an 
animal," Strametz said. "In cross-country, she works hard, but her attitude 
isn't as intense. She is disciplined, but her work ethic has to go to another 
level to reach her potential." 
</P>
<P>
Arreola is aware of her mental shortcomings, but she is hopeful of rectifying 
them by the time she races in Knoxville. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've been anywhere close to being mentally there (this season)," 
Arreola said. "I think (Strametz) would like to think that I'm a lot closer 
than I am. I'm really trying to improve in that area, but it's just been hard 
this season. . . . It seems like I keep thinking about track when I should be 
concentrating on cross-country. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, I can end the season on a good note."

FACES . . . : MCDONNELL LEARNS ANOTHER WAY OF LIFE MAKING 'DANCES WITH WOLVES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We had the best caterers in the entire universe," quips Mary McDonnell. "I 
never ate such good food on a daily basis." 
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old McDonnell also had the best time of her life starring opposite 
Kevin Costner in his critically lauded Western, "Dances With Wolves." The New 
York-based stage actress plays Stands With a Fist, a white woman, raised by the 
Sioux after her family had been massacred by another tribe, who falls in love 
with Lt. John Dunbar (Costner). 
</P>
<P>
Before filming began, McDonnell had to learn to speak Lakota, the Sioux 
language. "It took a while," she says. "They sent me an audio tape with my 
lines translated so I started working by myself. 
</P>
<P>
The thing that struck me immediately and made me very sad was that I had never 
heard this language. Here was one of the native tongues of the country I live 
in and I had never heard it. I thought that appalling." 
</P>
<P>
Learning the language wasn't difficult, McDonnell explains, "but trusting that 
it was good enough was the hard part. Learning to ride bareback day in and day 
out was hard because we would become sore. And the weather could be hard. I 
remember shooting a scene where Kevin and I meet and roll around in the snow. 
It was absolutely freezing. It was so cold that I cry when I see the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"But there were just so many things about making the film that were so 
incredible, you didn't notice you were out on the prairie in South Dakota for 
four months." 
</P>
<P>
When "Dances With Wolves" premiered last month in Washington, D.C., McDonnell, 
Costner and co-producer Jim Wilson were each adopted by a Sioux family. "I was 
adopted by Doris Leader Charge and her family," says McDonnell. "She was sort 
of my best friend on the film. Basically, what they have given us is an open 
door to their families and their lives and their love and support from now 
until the day we die." SUSAN KING

LAKERS UP, THEN DOWN;

<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: MAVERICKS COME BACK FROM AN EARLY 14-POINT DEFICIT TO WIN, 
99-86.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was another inspirational victory in a Laker game, only they weren't the 
winners in this one. 
</P>
<P>
A day after beating the Houston Rockets in overtime, the Lakers let the 
post-Roy Tarpley, out-on-their-feet Dallas Mavericks climb off the deck. The 
Mavericks rallied from a 14-point deficit and smoked the Lakers for the rest of 
Friday night, thumping them, 99-86. 
</P>
<P>
After the first quarter, the Mavericks, who had just lost back-to-back games to 
Orlando and Miami, not to mention their last six in Reunion Arena to the 
Lakers, shot 60%. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers are still one of three NBA teams allowing opponents to shoot 50%. 
The others are Charlotte and Denver. 
</P>
<P>
There were other problems: Dallas cut a 13-point lead to four as soon as Magic 
Johnson left the floor; Terry Teagle's slump, the continuing problem of the 
Lakers' settling for long shots. 
</P>
<P>
But they pale beside the fact that they have become fish in a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
"In the second half, we kind of fell apart a little bit defensively," Dunleavy 
said. "I'm not sure it didn't have to do with fatigue. I played our guys big 
minutes in the overtime (at Houston on Thursday). But defensively, we've got to 
have a 'gut check.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Mavericks started the night looking as though they were doing well to avoid 
crying in public. Contenders for the finals in their own minds as the season 
began, they were ambushed by Tarpley's knee surgery. The news was felt to be of 
such import, two area newspapers carried it on the front page. 
</P>
<P>
Once again the Mavericks found themselves in what the Dallas Morning News calls 
"Post-Tarpley Syndrome." Coach Richie Adubato walked up and down press row 
before the game, confiding how upset he was. 
</P>
<P>
His team went out and proceeded to demonstrate why. 
</P>
<P>
Ducking a fusillade of Maverick bricks, the Lakers shot to a 26-12 lead. They 
led, 31-18, in the second quarter when Johnson went to the bench for his first 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
Within four minutes, the Mavericks trailed, 32-27. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was rushed back in, but the chance for an early knockout was over. The 
teams battled on even terms until the fourth quarter, which Dallas began with a 
10-0 run, including Derek Harper's back-to-back three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, the Lakers had shocking lapses, such as the one in which they 
came out of a timeout, lined up and let venerable, slow Brad Davis the lane, 
reach the basket and lay the ball up. Maybe they were emotionally spent from 
Houston. Maybe Dunleavy is right about that gut check, too. 
</P>
<P>
"None of us played well," Magic Johnson said. "Sam (Perkins) played a great 
half (with 14 points), but that was it." 
</P>
<P>
Everybody is still being polite, but the Lakers' defensive problem seems to 
begin at center. 
</P>
<P>
Mychal Thompson started last season and the Lakers generally played straight up 
against the opposing center. Thompson, 34, has fallen so far out of the picture 
that against Phoenix on Tuesday, he missed a game without being injured for the 
first time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers began this season with Vlade Divac and double-teamed opposing 
centers. Opponents shot them up like Dodge City. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, Perkins, a forward, got his first start at defensive center. The 
Mavericks suggested that the Lakers still haven't found the total answer yet. 
</P>
<P>
Thus ended the Laker tour of Texas. They had an emotional night in Houston, won 
a game and got Perkins going but couldn't sustain the effort long enough to 
produce the victory that would have meant momentum. 
</P>
<P>
Let's just say, they're a work in progress. The operative word being "work." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Mavericks didn't throw the Lakers any bouquets afterward, either. "Anybody 
can look up and see this isn't the Laker team that dominated us for the last 
few years," James Donaldson said. "It's still the Lakers on the uniforms but 
not the Lakers on the court." . . . The Lakers had won nine consecutive games 
from the Mavericks. This was the first time the Mavericks had held them under 
90 points. . . . Donaldson and Byron Scott tangled on a jump ball, Scott 
actually advancing on his massive opponent. "I'm not afraid of James 
Donaldson," Scott said. "He's nobody to be afraid of. That he's 7-0, 260 
doesn't mean anything. If he's trying to take advantage of you, that's not 
going to happen." . . . The Lakers shot three for 21 from the three-point line. 
Poor shot selection? "Absolutely," Mike Dunleavy said. "We played right into 
their hands." . . . Terry Teagle shot three for 17 in Texas. . . . In his 
return to Dallas, Sam Perkins finished with 18 points, giving him 47 in Texas. 
. . . Magic Johnson made six more free throws, giving him 38 in a row, then 
missed. . . . The Lakers play host to Golden State Sunday night.

CLIPPERS GO COLD, LOSE IN OVERTIME

Mike Schuler couldn't put into words what it would have meant for the Clippers 
to beat the Phoenix Suns back-to-back, but description wasn't his strong suit 
Friday night. He couldn't put a finger on what went wrong when it counted, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the obvious. 
</P>
<P>
"We called everybody's number," he said after his Clippers lost, 121-110, in 
overtime before 14,487 at Veterans Memorial Coliseum. "We ran something for 
everybody to try and create shots. We had some, but they didn't fall." 
</P>
<P>
They didn't fall for a span of 6:16 extending into overtime, costing the 
Clippers (3-5) a chance to end a seven-game losing streak here. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers caught Tom Chambers (four of 14) on a dreadful night and Kevin 
Johnson (nine of 24, 10 turnovers) on a bad one and still couldn't put away the 
Suns. Those numbers shouldn't even hurt the most. 
</P>
<P>
These should: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Clippers' final field goal of regulation came with 3:07 remaining, 
their final point with 2:40 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They made three of 11 shots in overtime, while the Suns made seven of nine. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In a 101-101 game at the end of regulation, they were outscored 11-1 to 
open overtime, 20-9 in all. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to give ourselves a chance to win in the fourth quarter, and we 
did," said Clipper Ken Norman, who had 32 points, eight rebounds and six 
assists. "But it slipped away. We have to look at the positives, though, that 
we came in here and took it to them at home." 
</P>
<P>
Coming off a six-point victory over the Suns Wednesday at the Sports Arena, 
they played well almost the entire second half, but could never get enough 
control. Even when the Phoenix offense went without a point from 5:12 to 3:01 
left in regulation, the Clippers could build nothing better than a 101-96 lead. 
</P>
<P>
That disappeared, even though the Suns could manage nothing more than one free 
throw by Johnson and Mark West's rebound layup in the final 2:32. The Clippers 
had two 24-second violations in the same stretch and missed the opportunity to 
win when Tom Garrick's 30-foot straight-away shot missed at the end of 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Once into overtime, the Clippers didn't get their first point until nearly half 
of the five-minute period was gone. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think we were much more aggressive," Johnson said of the Suns' play 
down the stretch. "We tried to trap a little more. They weren't noticeable 
traps like half-court, but we are quick enough to do a lot of things that mean 
a lot to us." 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, that meant cornering point guard Gary Grant and forcing him into 
options besides feeding the ball into Norman and Benoit Benjamin at the post. 
Such tactics, especially by Norman, had been most harmful to the Suns earlier. 
</P>
<P>
It took Phoenix all of 4:21 to take a 15-5 lead. From there, the Suns pushed 
the margin to as much as 31-16, with 29 seconds remaining in the first quarter. 
The Clippers shot 28.6% (eight of 28) in the first 12 minutes, contrasting to 
57.1% (12 of 21) by Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Things turned just as quickly in the second quarter, when the Clippers opened 
with a 16-4 charge, Norman accounting for seven of the points and Bo Kimble 
six. That brought them within 36-34, a margin that disappeared when Garrick's 
layup tied the score, 38-38, with 3:58 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Looking to end a losing streak here that dates to Nov. 20, 1987, the Clippers 
finally took the lead back on their next possession when Norman made two free 
throws. They scored eight of the final 10 points of the quarter to go ahead, 
52-48, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
All involved are denying extra concern over Danny Manning going on the injured 
list, even though the tendinitis is in the same knee that was reconstructed 
nearly two years ago and the tendon that was grafted to replace a torn ligament 
knee came from the spot that is bothering Manning now. "I don't think so," Dr. 
Stephen Lombardo, who performed the surgery, said when asked if the flare-up is 
abnormally serious.

ANGELS STAYING OFF EXPENSIVE FREE-AGENT TRACK; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: CLUB LOOKS WITHIN, IN AN ATTEMPT TO INCREASE PRODUCTION AND WIN 
ONE-RUN GAMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The "glaring holes" found by Richard Brown in his two weeks as the Angels' 
president and chief executive officer probably won't be filled by high-profile 
free agents. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said Friday the Angels have not initiated talks with any free agents, or 
with players who might become new-look free agents and could be signed without 
costing their new team a draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged his interest is piqued by New York Yankee reliever Dave 
Righetti and by Minnesota Twin third baseman Gary Gaetti -- who may be a 
new-look free agent -- but said building from within is his goal, if possible. 
</P>
<P>
"My philosophy is to build on scouting and the minor leagues, then trades and 
then free agents," Brown said. "Signing new-look free agents is a matter of 
money, and the list hasn't been finalized. . . . We're trying to fill holes as 
well as we can and as expeditiously as we can. I can't wait until March to pull 
the trigger on trades. Looking at all free agents, I'm loath to sign Type-A 
players because that means giving up two first-round draft picks. Our first 
approach is to look to the minor leagues to see who's coming." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' farm system isn't likely to come up with the power-hitting third 
baseman or slick-fielding second baseman Brown would like to have. He said 
Bobby Rose is "on the path" to becoming the club's regular second baseman but 
might not be ready; he also said third baseman Jack Howell's declining offense 
is a problem, especially with Brown's desire to increase Angel production. 
</P>
<P>
"We scored a few more runs in 1990, but timely hitting and one-run games were 
the keys," Brown said. "Teams that win pennants win one-run games. In 1989, we 
were well above .500 (33-21 in one-run games), but this year, we were just 
around .500 (23-21). By having Dave Winfield all year, that's going to help in 
that department." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said that only starting pitchers Mark Langston, Jim Abbott, Kirk 
McCaskill, Chuck Finley and Bert Blyleven are not expendable, and that he is 
trying to sign first baseman Wally Joyner to a long-term agreement. Brown 
intends to re-sign free-agent infielder Donnie Hill and outfielder Max Venable 
and hasn't precluded a return by designated hitter Brian Downing. Should Chili 
Davis be granted new-look free agency and sign with another team, Brown said 
Downing might be re-signed. If Davis stays, Downing's chances would decrease. 
</P>
<P>
Brown confirmed that several clubs have expressed interest in Dante Bichette, 
who faded in the second half of the season after he lost his starting job. 
However, Brown said Bichette and center fielder Devon White have too much 
promise to be easily surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
"Some players I view as unexpendable would be expendable if the right deal came 
along," Brown said. "Do I trade one of our promising outfielders to fill a hole 
elsewhere? The answer has to be yes, but you have to look at the relative worth 
of the deal. I've rarely seen a player with as much potential as Devon White. 
Are we happy that he hit .217? No. Some people also realize their potential 
elsewhere. I hope he realizes it here. But I can't sit on potential. Potential 
doesn't win pennants." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Former Angel Darrell Miller has been hired as the club's director of community 
relations. . . . Richard Brown, the Angels' president and chief executive 
officer, said that despite the sale of the triple-A franchise in Edmonton, 
Canada, the Angels will almost certainly renew their affiliation with the 
Trappers.

<P>
Fleisher said Worthy would hire a lawyer to handle the matter. Worthy is 
scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday, at which point he would have to enter a plea 
but may seek a continuance. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy continued to have no comment.

<P>
"I think it's a hard time for him," Fleisher said.

The Lakers released a statement: "It is in everybody's best interest that this 
be put into the past as quickly as possible so that James and the Lakers can 
get on with their lives. We do not believe any further comment is appropriate."

GOLIC EAGER TO FACE DOLPHINS' MARINO

<P>
Raider nose guard Bob Golic, who has been sacking quarterbacks on a regular 
basis lately, is looking forward to facing the Miami Dolphins' Dan Marino 
Monday night at Joe Robbie Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth-rated passer in the AFC, Marino has thrown for 1,787 yards and 10 
touchdowns this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that I've had 2 1/2 sacks in the last two games, I've become a 
sackmaster," Golic said with a laugh. "And a guy like Marino is really a 
challenge. He's only been sacked six times this year. He's got a quick release 
and he doesn't let too many people knock him down." 
</P>
<P>
In past seasons, opponents could concentrate on Marino because the Dolphins 
lacked a running game. But Miami, averaging 118.6 yards on the ground, has 
rebuilt its attack and ranks sixth in the AFC in rushing. 
</P>
<P>
Which is the greatest team in professional sports? Well, it depends on where 
you draw the line. The Dolphins, using the 1970 merger between the American 
Football League and the National Football League as the starting point, have 
posted a .672 winning record since then to edge the Lakers, .667; the Montreal 
Canadiens, .665; the Boston Celtics, .663, and the Raiders, .649. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are eighth with a .628 mark. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders, of course, boast of having the best winning record in professional 
sports since 1963, when Al Davis assumed command as coach and general manager.

Coach John Robinson says running back Marcus Dupree seems to be handling his 
recent media attention well. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's an interesting phenomenon," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"He comes in, he hadn't played in five years, and yet there are four TV cameras 
following him around every day. He handled that good and seems to be right in 
the middle of this team. He's just one of the guys." 
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the Dallas Cowboys, who will play the Rams Sunday in Anaheim, will 
have three potential top 10 first-round choices -- their own and picks from the 
New Orleans Saints and the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
Does Coach Jimmy Johnson find himself cheering against those two teams to 
better the Cowboys' selections? 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, any time you have the opportunities to upgrade the talent on your 
football team," Johnson said, "that gives you some anxious moments. And I feel 
like we'll be able to do that with, I think, nine ones and twos over the next 
two years." 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys have stockpiled five No. 1s and four No. 2s in the next two drafts.

The Harlem Globetrotters canceled two games scheduled for January in Arizona 
because the state does not have a paid holiday for slain civil rights leader 
Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The games were to have been played Jan. 28 in Tucson and Jan. 29 in Tempe.

Arizona voters narrowly rejected a paid state King holiday in last week's

Tommy Scallen, executive vice president of the Globetrotters, said the 
all-black team formed in 1927 "is an institution born out of segregation. To 
our people, it's not a matter of whether state employees work. The ultimate 
test is the way people are viewing Arizona, that the state is not recognizing 
the achievements of Dr. King and the struggles of blacks in America.

NEWSWIRE: USOC SUSPENDS BOBSLED FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Olympic Committee announced Friday that it has suspended its funding 
of the U.S. Bobsled Federation while it conducts a full-scale audit of alleged 
misuse of federation money. 
</P>
<P>
A three-member team of independent auditors will begin examining financial 
records next week at federation headquarters in Lake Placid, N.Y. John 
Samuelson, the USOC's chief financial officer, said the audit is expected to 
take about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"This has never happened before," Samuelson said. "This is a precedent." 
</P>
<P>
The USOC board of directors voted last month to stop the grants to the 
federation, which has received nearly $1.2 million from the nation's Olympic 
governing body since 1988. Instead, Samuelson said the USOC is allocating funds 
directly to athletes in training. 
</P>
<P>
The federation's executive director denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no misspending of money. The audit will show that all the money that 
is spent from this organization is accounted for," said David Heim, the bobsled 
federation's executive director since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The federation's failure to file an audit for 1989 prompted the USOC to look 
into the matter. "That got our attention," Samuelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Heim said the failure to do last year's audit was because of an oversight.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEPUTY IN SKIMMING CASE CALLED A SKILLED 
GAMBLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy accused of helping skim drug money and 
spending some of the stolen cash was described Friday as a successful gambler 
who once won $32,000 in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Defense witnesses for Deputy Ronald E. Daub told jurors in U.S. District Court 
in Los Angeles that the narcotics officer won the money at the blackjack tables 
in 1988 as Daub's attorney sought to explain how Daub accumulated tens of 
thousands of dollars beyond his sheriff's salary. 
</P>
<P>
Government prosecutors contend that Daub purchased a boat, automobiles and a 
vacation home during 1988 and 1989 with some of the $1.4 million allegedly 
stolen by narcotics deputies during drug raids. 
</P>
<P>
Daub's brother and mother, however, testified that Daub not only won money 
gambling but also received a sizable cash inheritance from his late father. The 
relatives also said they contributed money toward the purchase of the vacation 
home in Arizona.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CASE AGAINST PROSTITUTE WITH AIDS VIRUS 
RESET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A convicted male prostitute was ordered to stand trial in Los Angeles Friday on 
a felony charge of continuing to solicit sex for money after being informed 
that he had tested positive for AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Municipal Court Judge Rand Schrader, who also chairs the Los 
Angeles County AIDS Commission, reversed an earlier decision and reinstated a 
case against Demitri Santangelo, 29, of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Schrader's ruling to dismiss the charge last month was overturned on appeal to 
Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: USC, UCLA OFFICIALS SEEK PUBLISHERS OF 
PARODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Administrators at USC were searching for the publishers of a sexually explicit 
and racist parody of UCLA's Daily Bruin student paper, officials at both 
schools said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-page tabloid was distributed Thursday at USC and on the Westwood 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
Staff members of USC's newspaper, the Daily Trojan, said the bogus tabloid may 
have been produced by a group led by a former Daily Trojan writer who was 
disappointed that the rival schools chose to end the longstanding tradition of 
lampooning each other's student papers. 
</P>
<P>
Because of increasingly offensive material published in recent years, students 
agreed to cease distributing the mock newspapers, which traditionally appeared 
just before the annual UCLA-USC football game, which is today. 
</P>
<P>
Writer bylines and photographer credits in the bogus Bruin contained racial 
slurs. Advertisements contained crude references to homosexuals. About 2,000 
copies were distributed at each campus.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VAPOR CLOUD ACCIDENTALLY ESCAPES FROM 
REFINERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A foul-smelling vapor cloud from the Shell Oil Co.'s Carson refinery floated 
over a large section of the South Bay on Friday, causing scores of complaints 
but apparently no serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Fire and air quality officials said they received more than 100 calls from 
Carson and Torrance residents complaining of eye irritation, breathing 
difficulties and other problems. But local hospital and emergency officials 
said no one requested treatment. 
</P>
<P>
According to Shell, the vapor cloud contained hydrogen sulfide, butane and 
propane that escaped accidentally at 9:30 a.m. during testing of a gasoline 
processing unit. Air quality officials said they are investigating the release, 
the fifth air pollution problem at the Shell refinery since May.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TEACHER AIDES THREATEN STRIKE OVER 
INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teacher assistants in Los Angeles said Friday that they will go on strike Nov. 
27 unless they reach a contract agreement with the school district. 
</P>
<P>
The teaching assistants, who last year unionized by joining Service Employees 
International Union Local 99, are asking for a contract guaranteeing them 
enough hours to qualify for health benefits. There are 10,000 teaching 
assistants in the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
District officials contend that budget difficulties limit their flexibility in 
meeting the union's demands.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TORRES MAY TRY TO SPEED RAIL TRASH-HAULING 
STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County's trash disposal situation has become so urgent, state Sen. 
Art Torres said Friday that he may introduce legislation to hasten the 
environmental review of plans to have trains haul garbage to the desert in San 
Bernardino and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
Torres, chairman of the Senate Committee on Toxics and Public Safety 
Management, said that if public officials, environmentalists, homeowners and 
trash industry representatives can reach a consensus, he will fight to shorten 
environmental studies. The Los Angeles Democrat told more than 50 people at the 
La Puente hearing that he would convene a meeting on this within a week.

CONCERN, REALITY SPLIT ON BROADWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The doorman, a beefy guy dressed in a fancy jacket and gray derby, is smiling 
and nodding as he holds open the door for the people going into the hotel lobby 
full of chandeliers, marble, antiques and splendor. 
</P>
<P>
A woman with a briefcase comes up. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's the homeless workshop?" she asks. 
</P>
<P>
The doorman looks into the park across the street. A bare-chested man with a 
dog collar around his neck is growling like an angry Rottweiler, a drunk with 
rubber legs is nearly falling into traffic, and a Charles Manson look-alike is 
frantically scratching and digging at his skin, screaming, "One shot to the 
body, baby, one shot to the heart. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The doorman pulls open the big glass door, and the cool, clean, old-money 
fragrance of luxury sweeps onto the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
"The homeless conference? You've got the right place," the doorman says. "It's 
right inside, ma'am." 
</P>
<P>
The sun is pounding off the white face and windows of the U.S. Grant Hotel at 
the corner of Broadway and 4th Avenue in downtown San Diego, making the place 
look like a palace. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street -- and at the other end of the world for all practical 
purposes -- the same sunlight is hitting Horton Plaza Park, warming it up 
nicely, taking off the morning chill and making it ripe with the smell of urine 
and sweat. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lawyer," who has just sat down on a bench, is a little disbelieving. 
</P>
<P>
He had just been asked if his colleagues -- the park's drugged-out, hung-over, 
unconscious or otherwise out of it denizens -- are aware that the glittering 
hotel looming in front of them is host to a major, two-day workshop Thursday 
and Friday of the federal Interagency Council on the Homeless, a regional 
conference that hopes someday to spawn the answers for getting them off the 
mean streets and back into mainstream society. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, hell, no, son," says The Lawyer. "I'm afraid a lot of these folks aren't 
aware of too much that happens around them, let alone in a hotel like that." 
</P>
<P>
At age 63, Robert Dupre is living proof that homelessness can happen to anyone 
and -- this is the part that makes homeless advocates cringe and the 
anti-homeless gloat -- that being a hobo just ain't always that bad. 
</P>
<P>
Dupre tells one of those stories you would never believe. As a young man in the 
1950s and '60s, he was an FBI agent, a senator's aide and an assistant U.S. 
attorney, a real up-and-comer in the powerful legal and political circles in 
Washington and the South. 
</P>
<P>
You think: Yeah, sure you were, old man. And I'm the Wizard of Oz. 
</P>
<P>
Only problem is The Lawyer's story checks out. The FBI, Sen. Strom Thurmond 
(R-S.C.), and the U.S. attorney's office in South Carolina all confirm it. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I declare, I declare. That's shocking. . . . As a young man, I thought 
he had a bright future," Thurmond said softly, upon learning Dupre has been on 
the streets since the early 1970s, when his life crumbled under alcohol, a 
divorce and other personal troubles. He was a public defender until being 
disbarred a few years later. 
</P>
<P>
Dupre says some homeless people call him The Lawyer because he does occasional 
paralegal work and once in a while will help a street person find the right 
legal and social services. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday morning, sitting on a park bench, Dupre looked over an agenda for the 
conference on homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
After a moment, he launches into a knowledgeable discourse about financial 
waste and the inner workings of the bureaucracy administering funds from the 
federal McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. 
</P>
<P>
He favors eliminating much of the bureaucracy, which he considers a 
self-sustaining black hole for taxpayers' money, and instead giving vouchers 
for food, clothing and other necessities directly to the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"There's so much money wasted," The Lawyer says. "It's such a complex system, 
and it really shouldn't be." 
</P>
<P>
During the conference, the Interagency Council on the Homeless, a coalition of 
federal, state and local agencies, discussed everything from housing to job 
training for the homeless in the council's Western region of California, 
Nevada, Arizona and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
The language of the workers discussing the homeless is much different from the 
language of the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego was chosen to host the conference because of its record for 
"interagency cooperation" and establishing one of the nation's highest numbers 
of "single-room occupancy boarding houses" for people surviving on government 
benefit checks, conference officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In one workshop, the topic was mental illness and substance abuse, considered 
two of the most pernicious disorders gripping many homeless people, putting 
some on the street, keeping others there, reinforcing many people's perception 
of the homeless as lazy winos and addicts who wouldn't take honest manual labor 
if you gave it to them. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the ornate meeting rooms, the social workers used their clinical terms 
-- "dual diagnoses" and "integrated assistance programs" and "relapse 
prevention" -- to discuss the troubles of the mentally ill and alcohol and drug 
abusers. 
</P>
<P>
Someone mentioned the homeless who refuse help -- the ones whose brains and 
bodies are too far gone, the ones who have, for whatever reason, abandoned 
mainstream society. 
</P>
<P>
One item mentioned was a proposal for more conservatorships, where social 
workers get control over a person's monthly Social Security disability and 
veteran's benefits checks so the money, theoretically, is used "properly," 
rather than lost, stolen or "wasted." 
</P>
<P>
The homeless "wasting" government benefits is at the crux of the issue of 
"true" homelessness. Some get no money from anyone. For others, monthly benefit 
checks are more than $1,000, enough for a vagabond lifestyle, with shelters, 
churches and other social service programs meeting emergency needs. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, the merchants would stop complaining about the homeless if 
they realized how much the street people were spending on clothes, motels, 
liquor and Walkmans, said Susan Dempsey, head of a Santa Monica social service 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"They blow the checks. They just spend it as they wish. . . . It's an abuse of 
the system because these people have no desire to get off the streets," said 
Dempsey. 
</P>
<P>
A tough-talking woman in her 40s, Dempsey emphasizes the need for compassion 
and hope for the mentally ill homeless, but she doesn't appear to tolerate any 
mollycoddling. She opposes shelters that provide food and clothing without 
offering recovery services and permanent housing programs. 
</P>
<P>
Most homeless people want off the street, Dempsey said, but helping those who 
don't is nearly impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Fear is what keeps many people on the streets, she said -- a fear of failure 
mixed with no self-esteem and a denial of what life really is on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"If you trust in the system for help and you fail -- for whatever reason -- 
then the next time will be twice as bad. . . . You get into a vicious cycle 
and, after a while, you figure what's the use, life isn't so bad on the streets 
as long as you get your (benefits) checks." 
</P>
<P>
A young man Dempsey knows lived on the street for years until his family helped 
him get psychiatric care. He got medication, clean clothes, hot meals again. 
And he hated it. 
</P>
<P>
"On the streets, he was out of it (mentally)," Dempsey said. "But he said the 
medication made him too aware of who he was, what his problems were. He said, 
'I have no life. I see that now.' 
</P>
<P>
"It's very sad. The only thing we can do with people like that is just keep 
trying to improve their quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
Back in Horton Plaza Park, The Lawyer is talking in a raspy Southern accent 
about how he can quit the streets any time and go live with relatives -- he 
hasn't told them he is a hobo -- in San Francisco, Salt Lake City or even 
return to his native Oconee County, on the edge of the Great Smoky Mountains in 
northern South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Dupre is clean, polite, soft-spoken, avuncular. He is not a braggart about his 
past; he is more interested in discussing homelessness from both a first-person 
perspective and as a socio-cultural phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
Neatly dressed in tennis shorts, an Izod sweater and South Carolina Gamecocks 
baseball cap, his worldly belongings in a gym bag, he sounds, looks and smells 
like a grandfather from the rural South: strong hands and a potbelly, smelling 
vaguely of pipe tobacco, cologne and old sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
He has no intention, however -- at least right away -- of leaving the street. 
He says he's "not ready" yet. 
</P>
<P>
He has been lucid until now, but he starts wandering a little, talking of 
"searching for something . . . a way to change homelessness. . . . I'm still 
learning about life." 
</P>
<P>
He says it as if he were a young student gathering material for a doctoral 
dissertation on homelessness or the human condition, and not a 63-year-old 
recovering alcoholic who has nowhere to go and doesn't particularly care, an 
old man who spends his nights on concrete and days soaking up the sun among the 
Horton Park regulars -- some harmless, some dangerously unstable and none 
clearly all there. 
</P>
<P>
The $845 a month Dupre gets in Social Security and veteran's benefits -- for 
being a Navy Air Corps tail gunner in the South Pacific during World War II -- 
goes for food, an occasional motel room, odds and ends and, since he gave up 
booze, enough marijuana to get "relaxed" a few times a month. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Thurmond, irritation edging out his pity, cannot understand it. 
</P>
<P>
"Just between you and me," the old senator whispers. "Is he all there in the 
head? . . . He's got an education, and he comes from a very respectable family. 
I wonder why he hasn't gone home to his people. He could get a job in real 
estate or insurance. I just don't understand." 
</P>
<P>
Dupre wants none of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's smart on the streets, but you choose to be in society or out of it," 
he says. "Those are the two choices -- there is no middle ground. I've chosen 
to be out of it. To fit in, you need that good ol' American work ethic. . . . 
and I don't have it. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't mind losing my status -- I never had any great calling to be a lawyer 
anyway -- but I don't want to lose my mind and sink into the homeless 
mentality." 
</P>
<P>
He looks around. Dozing or chatting in the sunshine are dozens of young men, 
able-bodied and looking well rested, a little drunk or high, bumming change off 
people passing by, relaxing on the grass and benches. 
</P>
<P>
This, apparently, is what Dupre thinks of as the "homeless mentality." Nobody 
is poring desperately over the want ads in search of gainful employment or 
otherwise "pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Kemp and Frank Keating would be disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the Grant Hotel, in a vast ballroom after lunch, Keating, general 
counsel for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, was speaking about 
HUD Secretary Kemp's "Operation Bootstrap" and homelessness being a "national 
tragedy" afflicting "lost souls." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing was too memorable among the cliches and rhetoric until Keating recalled 
a winter day in Washington a few years ago when he was returning from lunch. He 
came upon a man sitting on a sidewalk grate. It was raining and 20 degrees. 
Icicles covered the man's beard and bare head. He was trying to peel a frozen 
orange. 
</P>
<P>
And Ted Bundy popped into Keating's mind. 
</P>
<P>
It was a tragedy, Keating said, that a society's priorities could be so screwed 
up that a serial killer like Bundy could live in a Florida prison before 
getting the electric chair -- and yet no one was taking care of that freezing 
man with his rock-hard navel orange on the Washington grate. 
</P>
<P>
Down in Horton Plaza Park, with a few of the social workers from the conference 
passing by, a woman with no teeth asks for the time. 
</P>
<P>
She has not bathed in weeks -- her hair looks like a mechanic's grease rag. The 
crotch of her farmer's overalls -- big enough for a 250-pound man -- hangs to 
her knees. She is in her 40s and looks 70 -- a very ill 70. 
</P>
<P>
She clearly is in a hurry. Impatiently, she shuffles away -- to a corner, back, 
around the park, to another corner, fenced in a by a one-square-block mental 
barrier. 
</P>
<P>
She is going nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
After a while, she gets tired and sits on a bench. Ten minutes later, she 
starts bouncing off the invisible walls again -- corner to corner to corner to 
corner. It goes on all day. 
</P>
<P>
"Poor woman," says The Lawyer. "See, I'm not like that because I have the 
choice of being out here. . . . Do you think she has that choice?"

CAREER CRIMINAL CONVICTED AGAIN AS A REPEAT FELON; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: IT TOOK A JURY JUST 10 MINUTES TO RETURN THE VERDICT IN JAMES BLAND'S 
SECOND TRIAL. AN EARLIER VERDIT HAD BEEN OVERTURNED. HE FACES LIFE IN PRISON 
WITHOUT PAROLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Warren James Bland, a Los Angeles man who was labeled a career criminal last 
year by a San Diego federal judge, was convicted Friday of being a repeat felon 
in possession of a gun and, for the second time, faces being sentenced to life 
in prison with no chance of parole. 
</P>
<P>
If he receives that term, as he did in an earlier trial that was overturned, he 
will be the first person in California sentenced to life without parole under a 
4-year-old federal law that targets repeat offenders. 
</P>
<P>
It took a U.S. District Court jury precisely 10 minutes to convict Bland, who 
has spent 28 of the past 31 years in prisons or mental institutions, of 
possessing a gun when San Diego police arrested him in February, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
His first life sentence under the 1986 Armed Career Criminal Act was handed 
down last year. 
</P>
<P>
However, he won a new trial four months ago when a federal appeals court ruled 
that U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving improperly told jurors during last 
year's trial that Bland was wanted in the 1986 killing of a 7-year-old Pasadena 
girl. 
</P>
<P>
The second trial began Wednesday. Jurors began deliberating the case at 4:04 
p.m. Friday and returned with the guilty verdict at 4:14 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's the appropriate verdict," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Larry A. 
Burns, the prosecutor in the case. "I think the sentence was appropriate the 
first time. Hopefully the court will reimpose the same sentence." 
</P>
<P>
Irving, who presided over the second trial, too, set sentencing for Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
When Irving imposed the life sentence in August, 1989, he called Bland, 54, a 
"vicious, incorrigible predator." Because of Bland's bespectacled, 
grandfather-like appearance, Irving said, he is "particularly dangerous" and a 
"wolf in sheep's clothing." 
</P>
<P>
The conviction Friday marked Bland's 14th felony 
</P>
<P>
conviction, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
"He has become the measuring stick for other alleged armed career criminals," 
Burns said. "I hear defense attorneys comparing their clients to him, saying, 
'He's not a Warren Bland, judge, he's not a Warren Bland.' 
</P>
<P>
Bland's first felony offense came in 1957, Burns said. He was most recently 
released from prison in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1987, he was wounded and arrested by San Diego police and charged 
in the torture and murder of 7-year-old Phoebe Ho of South Pasadena, whose body 
was found in a Riverside County ditch. She had disappeared while walking to 
school in December, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Bland also has been named as a suspect in the slayings of 14-year-old Wendy 
Osborn of Placentia in Orange County, and Ruth M. Ost, 81, of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police had been looking for Bland on the Riverside County warrant. 
Officers found a gun in his car. 
</P>
<P>
Bland was then charged under the 1986 federal "career criminal" law with 
possession of a gun by a felon with at least three serious convictions. The law 
sets maximum punishment as a no-parole life term. 
</P>
<P>
Bland was convicted in March, 1989, of the gun charge and sentenced five months 
later to life in prison. But, in July, 1990, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals reversed the conviction and ordered a new trial, saying that Irving 
should not have mentioned the Ho killing to jurors. 
</P>
<P>
No juror could have remained impartial upon hearing that acquitting Bland might 
mean releasing an "exceedingly dangerous child molester and killer into the 
community," a three-judge 9th Circuit panel said. 
</P>
<P>
Bland remains in federal prison pending sentencing, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Mario Conte could not be reached Friday for comment.

JURY WEEPS BUT DOESN'T AWARD MONEY TO WIDOW IN AIDS CASE; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: DOROTHY POLIKOFF'S HUSBAND ACQUIRED AIDS BY TRANSFUSION AND THEN PASSED 
THE DISEASE ON TO HER BEFORE HE DIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jurors wept Friday morning as they told Dorothy Polikoff that they wouldn't 
make a hospital compensate her for the death of her husband from AIDS, a 
disease he acquired by transfusion and then passed on to her before he died in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict came after a three-week trial during which Mrs. Polikoff, 65, had 
rejected a $500,000 settlement offer from UC San Diego Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
She settled out of court for an undisclosed amount with the San Diego Blood 
Bank, which provided the transfused blood. 
</P>
<P>
"The case was a tragic one, and the jurors were crying when they gave their 
verdict," said Jeffrey B. Barton, attorney for UCSD. "But they were able to put 
aside their feelings of sympathy and go on what was known at the time, and the 
fact that (UCSD was) doing everything that could be done to protect patients." 
</P>
<P>
Polikoff's lawyer, Michael Moriarty of Walnut Creek, said he was shocked by the 
verdict and plans to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"It came out loud and clear that there were options back in January, 1984, to 
those who were getting operations with transfusions," said Moriarty, clearly 
dejected by the case's outcome. "You could donate your own blood, or you could 
designate who you wanted to donate for you. . . . The person who was in charge 
of passing on those options to the physicians, so they could advise the 
patients, refused to divulge that information to the physicians." 
</P>
<P>
Polikoff, who has tested positive for the HIV virus that causes AIDS and now 
suffers the diarrhea and weight loss that are pre-AIDS symptoms, cried quietly 
at her home Friday afternoon after learning the news earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder what the world is getting to," she said in a voice muffled by tears. 
"Have we lost all sense of integrity, dignity? Is life meaningful? Would they 
like to wear these shoes? 
</P>
<P>
"It's a beautiful world, but we don't make it better if we don't speak out when 
something's wrong. I failed. I failed miserably. And that's what hurts." 
</P>
<P>
The case centered on the issue of whether UCSD Medical Center had a 
responsibility in 1984 -- months before the AIDS virus was isolated or a 
detection test developed -- to give transfusion patients alternatives to 
getting blood from a blood bank. Although the detection test had not been 
developed yet, Moriarty said, there was enough evidence that AIDS was commonly 
associated with people who had hepatitis so that blood testing should have been 
done. 
</P>
<P>
William Polikoff died at the age of 70 in December, 1987. He had undergone 
cardiac surgery at UCSD in 1984, during which he received four units of plasma 
and five units of red cells from nine different donors. It was two years later 
that the Polikoffs became aware of the danger of getting AIDS through 
transfusions, and were tested. 
</P>
<P>
Barton contended successfully during a three-week trial that UCSD had met the 
"standard of care" for transfusions at the time of Polikoff's operation. 
</P>
<P>
Moriarty countered that UCSD should have offered William Polikoff the option of 
storing his own blood in advance of the operation, or getting blood from family 
members. He also contended that UCSD should have warned the Polikoffs later to 
practice safer sex techniques, so Mrs. Polikoff would not be infected. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD's $500,000 settlement offer was turned down "because, I think Mrs. 
Polikoff is entitled to far greater compensation for the loss of her husband of 
41 years," Moriarty said. 
</P>
<P>
Barton said the offer had been made because San Diego Superior Court Judge 
Michael I. Greer, who presided over the trial, had made a procedural ruling 
that would have allowed the jury to award an unlimited amount to Mrs. Polikoff. 
</P>
<P>
"You combine that with the sympathy factor, and it creates a financial 
exposure," Barton said. "The thing that scared me about the case was that they 
wouldn't be able to see past Mrs. Polikoff, the tragedy of what happened to 
her." 
</P>
<P>
Disappointed, she said Friday that she just doesn't understand the jury's 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
"How these jurors could make that decision is beyond me," she said. "To say 
that there's no consideration for my care after all this agony of years -- I 
don't understand the public. I don't understand." 
</P>
<P>
Moriarty said a second lawsuit, against the Veterans Administration Medical 
Center in San Diego, will go to trial in San Diego on Dec. 11. It was V.A. 
doctors who referred William Polikoff to UCSD for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The Polikoff case is one of about 200 filed around the country because of AIDS 
caused by contaminated blood products. More are expected as the 3,600 people 
across the United States that have acquired the disease from transfusions 
become symptomatic. 
</P>
<P>
Early cases resulted in smaller, out-of-court settlements. More recently, there 
have been large verdicts, including a $28.7-million judgment in June against a 
hospital and doctors on behalf of a 5-year-old Phoenix boy. In August, Los 
Angeles attorney Martin Berman won a $3 million lawsuit for an 10-year-girl.

HEDGECOCK BASKS IN PRAISE FROM MANY RADIO FANS AS CLOUD OF LAWSUIT PASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
The first sign that Friday would not be a typical day on Roger Hedgecock's talk 
show on KSDO radio came when his program's normal theme music was replaced with 
the late Roy Orbison's hit, "It's Over." 
</P>
<P>
Then, as he outlined the show's schedule, Hedgecock said there would be 
segments on organ transplants, graffiti eradication and -- after a coy pause -- 
"items in the news, so to speak." 
</P>
<P>
And, just in case anyone still had not caught on, a commercial break ended with 
a tape of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s concluding lines from his famous "I 
Have a Dream" speech: "Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are 
free at last!" 
</P>
<P>
With that, it was time for the former San Diego mayor to take some telephone 
calls from listeners. 
</P>
<P>
"Roger, you must be one happy camper!" a North Park woman exclaimed. Only 
someone who slumbered through the past 24 hours would have needed to ask why. 
</P>
<P>
And so it went for Roger Hedgecock, ex-mayor, radio talk-show host and the 
namesake of The People vs. Roger Hedgecock, for whom Friday was, in his own 
words, "a whole new world." 
</P>
<P>
The day after his lengthy political corruption case ended abruptly with a 
settlement agreement that will leave him with a clean criminal record. 
Hedgecock, dressed casually in jeans and a green and red plaid shirt, spent 
much of his four-hour program accepting congratulations from listeners. 
</P>
<P>
To a person, the callers wanted to extend their best wishes over Thursday's 
agreement, under which Hedgecock accepted conviction on a single felony -- 
which will be erased from his record in about six weeks -- in exchange for 
having the prospect of a one-year jail term and a possible retrial eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been waiting a long time to make this call!" said Chuck of La Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"Congratulations to Cindy and your cute kids," added a man calling from his car 
phone, referring to Hedgecock's wife and two boys. 
</P>
<P>
Hedgecock's callers were at no loss in coming up with ways to congratulate him 
on what most of them clearly saw as a happy ending to what Hedgecock often 
described as "the country's longest running political soap opera." 
</P>
<P>
Some urged him to consider reentering politics, an option that Hedgecock 
insists is not in his future. One woman suggested that two men she considers to 
be Hedgecock's legal tormentors -- Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller and Justice William 
L. Todd Jr., who presided over his two 1985 trials -- would feel her wrath in 
future elections. 
</P>
<P>
Others encouraged Hedgecock to stay right where he is, saying that he can play 
a more forceful and effective role in city affairs from his Kearny Mesa studio 
than he could at City Hall. And a few supporters sent telegrams or even faxed 
their congratulations. 
</P>
<P>
"Hedgecock in '92!" said Tom from Pacific Beach, capturing the breezy, upbeat 
tone of the callers. "I'd like to see you as our mayor again." 
</P>
<P>
"Here's the deal -- you get to be mayor again, but you have to still do the 
radio show," another caller said. "Run the city from the studio." 
</P>
<P>
Chuckling, Hedgecock replied: "That's the only way I'd get back in politics!" 
To another caller who suggested a political comeback, Hedgecock said, only 
half-jokingly: "I think I would destroy my credibility, my family life and my 
peace of mind if I were to go back into politics." 
</P>
<P>
During commercial breaks, Hedgecock paused to muse over how the end to his 
protracted case caused Friday to dawn, at least in his eyes, "brighter, sunnier 
and better" than most other days since the investigation into his personal and 
campaign finances began in early 1984. 
</P>
<P>
From the beginning, Hedgecock prided himself on his ability to 
"compartmentalize" by focusing on his work and not dwelling on the darker 
possibilities posed by his legal woes -- first by maintaining a firm hands-on 
approach as mayor during his two trials, and later by rebuilding his public 
following via his radio program. Even so, now that the "unhappy chapter" has 
ended, Hedgecock conceded that it was difficult not to be preoccupied. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got up this morning, I had a feeling of liberation, a new appreciation 
for what it's like to not have to go through another single day with this sword 
hanging over my head," Hedgecock said. "Even though I never considered this to 
be a cloud over me, it was always in the back of your mind. To have it gone 
feels wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
For it to be completely "gone," however, Hedgecock still must clear one 
remaining legal hurdle: a civil lawsuit filed by the state Fair Political 
Practices Commission over the same illegal contributions to his 1983 mayoral 
campaign that led to his criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
Put on hold pending resolution of Hedgecock's criminal trial, the civil case 
has "seen no activity -- none at all -- in five or six years," according to 
Hedgecock's attorney, Leo Sullivan. Though Hedgecock has suggested that the 
case may "dry up and blow away" because a five-year statute of limitations has 
expired, Sullivan explained that that procedural question remains to be 
answered definitively. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd suspect (FPPC attorneys) have their own thoughts on that subject," 
Sullivan said. "Now that the other case is over, I expect we'll be hearing from 
them soon." 
</P>
<P>
FPPC officials did not return repeated telephone calls Friday. 
</P>
<P>
At least on Friday, however, the FPPC lawsuit was all but forgotten by 
Hedgecock, who basked in the nonstop adulation of his listeners, who described 
him as everything from a role model for youths because of the way "you kept 
your head high" to a symbol of perseverance, of hard-fought triumph over the 
odds. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, it was, a smiling Hedgecock said, "Just another great day at KSDO." 
</P>
<P>
"This show has played a major part in helping me put my life back together over 
the past five years," Hedgecock said. "On a day like today, this is where I 
belong." 
</P>
<P>
HAILING HEDGECOCK: On the day after his lengthy political conspiracy case ended 
with a settlement that will leave ex-San Diego Mayor Roger Hedgecock with a 
clean criminal record, hewas basking in the adulation of listeners on his radio 
talk show.

CITY DECLINES TO PROSECUTE RAP GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego city attorney's office will not prosecute a Los Angeles-based rap 
group that allegedly simulated sex acts with inflatable dolls during a summer 
concert, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. 
</P>
<P>
James Cahan said his office considered bringing obscenity charges against three 
members of the rap group Digital Underground, who allegedly acted out oral sex 
and intercourse on stage during an Aug. 26 show at the San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
But, particularly in light of recent obscenity rulings that went against 
prosecutors, he said, the city attorney decided the case "was not worth 
pursuing." In recent months, prosecutors have lost two celebrated obscenity 
cases involving the lyrics of rap group 2 Live Crew and an exhibit of the late 
Robert Mapplethorpe's photographs. 
</P>
<P>
Cahan said that his office concluded that the odds of winning the case against 
Digital Underground, whose album is entitled "Sex Packets" and whose members 
include one rapper named Humpty Hump, were not necessarily good. 
</P>
<P>
"The conduct was certainly vulgar but not necessarily obscene according to the 
statute," Cahan said. "It was not worth bringing to trial." 
</P>
<P>
"It was a question of resources but also a question of probability of 
conviction," he said. "When you're dealing with the First Amendment, and you 
always are when you're dealing with obscenity, the probability of winning was 
too remote to bring to trial and bring before the courts and the people."

CAMPUS GREEK GROUPS DISCOVER IT'S TOUGH TO PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN D. CRAMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He was lucky it wasn't the shark tank. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Sea World was host to a college fraternity social event, some guy 
got drunk and naked and jumped into an aquarium. He swam among the startled 
fish -- with some equally surprised restaurant patrons looking on -- until 
security guards pulled him out. 
</P>
<P>
"The fish weren't hurt and neither was he, but that was about it," said Sea 
World spokesman Dan LeBlanc. "We couldn't take any more chances with our 
animals or the facilities." 
</P>
<P>
Citing drunken behavior and rowdyism among college fraternity and sorority 
members, many of San Diego's top hotels and resorts are refusing to hold social 
events of the Greek organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"Many hotels have had bad experiences, and they've just gotten fed up," said 
Hotel del Coronado spokeswoman Nancy Weisinger. The students "tend to drink too 
much, spill things, break things, be noisy, and they want (unchaperoned) 
sleeping rooms . . . Not all of them are bad, of course, but you really have to 
think twice." 
</P>
<P>
Both sides agree that a handful of fraternities and sororities cause most of 
the trouble, tagging all Greek organizations with an "Animal House" label, but 
many top resorts still will not book their social events, even if supplied with 
good references from other hotels. 
</P>
<P>
"It's discrimination, is what it is," said Alan Moznett, social chairman of Tau 
Kappa Epsilon at San Diego State University. "In most cases, it isn't an 
'Animal House.' We are young gentlemen and ladies. We don't all rip things up 
and throw drinks on each other. . . . We're classy individuals, too." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big stereotype," said Scott Hagen, vice president of Lambda Chi Alpha 
at SDSU. "It's a few bad applies spoiling the barrel." 
</P>
<P>
Hotel and resort officials, however, contend it is easier to book private 
clubs' parties, weddings, high school proms and other non-college events and 
simply avoid the hazards of dealing with drunken and ill-behaved fraternity and 
sorority members. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the facilities banning or imposing restrictions, such as large damage 
deposits, on Greek organizations include the Hyatt Regency and Mariott in La 
Jolla, Hotel del Coronado, and Sea World. 
</P>
<P>
Some of San Diego's top hotels have had no contact with fraternities -- such as 
the La Valencia, which is too small to accommodate large parties -- and thus 
have adopted no specific policies regarding college Greek organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The only large hotels, including the U.S. Grant Hotel and La Costa Resort and 
Spa, not to have instituted such policies, however, seem to be the ones that 
have not been approached by fraternities. 
</P>
<P>
Fraternity social events "post a red flag" at the Marriott Hotel and Marina in 
downtown San Diego, meaning the hotel staff is especially alert for 
misbehavior, and security guards will inspect the rooms for any damage before 
the fraternity leaders leave, said Harold Queisser, the hotel's director of 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla Marriott did not require security deposits from Greek 
organizations until 1987, when some fraternity boys opened the fire hoses on 
the hotel's sixth floor and caused more than $100,000 in water damage. 
</P>
<P>
Such experiences tarnish the reputation of all college Greek organizations, 
reinforcing the let's-get-drunk-and-rowdy image, said Marriott spokesman Dan 
Kelleher. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, they ruined it for all of them," Kelleher added. "Ninety 
percent of them are good, but it is hard to take that risk any more." 
</P>
<P>
Sea World has banned all college Greek organizations since mid-1989. After 
hotels began imposing restrictions a few years ago, the marine park accepted 
fraternities until numerous episodes of alcohol-related vandalism and fights 
ended their welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Many fraternity leaders say they understand the hotels' concerns but still 
consider the restrictions unfair. 
</P>
<P>
"The nicer hotels don't want Greeks," said Dan Finkel, president of Alpha Tau 
Omega at SDSU. "They say, 'Things happen.' Furniture getting broken or whatever 
is very rare, but they say it isn't worth the hassle." 
</P>
<P>
Finding it nearly impossible to book a formal or semi-formal event at a top 
hotel, many Greek organizations go outside San Diego, while some book 
reservations under false names to deceive local hotels. 
</P>
<P>
"Our social budgets are pretty low, but we like to have our formal events at 
nice places," Moznett said. "And a lot of hotels have open dates until they 
find out who it's for. Then they get booked very fast. They give you the 
runaround. It's just a lot of bureaucratic crap." 
</P>
<P>
Some students suggested that hotels would be wise to remember that today's 
fraternity and sorority members could be become tomorrow's corporate executives 
-- the ones who choose which hotels to patronize. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the awkward position now of having minimal to no influence over the 
hotels, but when we graduate (the hotels) could end up losing business," 
Moznett said. "The whole thing is leaving a bad taste in everyone's mouth."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;

<P>
GEOGRAPHY LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Here was the terrific news that Solana 
Beach kindergarten teacher Arlene Johnston had won the first national 
"Excellence in Geography Teaching" award for her simple, yet highly successful, 
idea to teach 5-year-olds the locations of the nation's 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the way Johnston's kindergartners proved their prowess that was a 
bit deflating. They defeated a team of San Marcos High School students in a 
competition to locate states on a blank map of the United States and identify 
their best-known products and nicknames. 
</P>
<P>
There it was in a nutshell: teen-age Americans' appalling knowledge of 
geography juxtaposed against the success of Johnston's simple program. 
</P>
<P>
Hand-wringing about students' lack of acumen in geography is widespread. But 
here is a teacher offering promise for future improvement. 
</P>
<P>
The most encouraging aspect is that Johnston accomplished the task without a 
high-priced program or a battery of research. She just asked the children to 
send letters to friends and relatives in all 50 states and posted them on a map 
in the classroom until every state was represented. 
</P>
<P>
That idea bested 500 others submitted from around the country, enriching 
Johnston by $10,000 and winning a collection of geography material for Solana 
Vista Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
And it proved, once again, that an imaginative teacher and a captivated class 
of students are still the best combination for successful education on critical 
concepts.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
ROGER -- OVER AND OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whether you believe that former Mayor Roger Hedgecock got what he deserved 
Thursday, the city of San Diego finally has been rewarded for its patience with 
the feuding factions at the center of his political and legal melodrama. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the infamous Hedgecock affair is over, and with its conclusion a turbulent 
chapter in the city's political history is winding down. Whether you blame 
Dist. Atty. Edwin L. Miller Jr. or Hedgecock for the scandal and bloody 
infighting that marred the mid-1980s, you can now look forward to a gradual 
diminishing of the fervor of the struggle. Or so everyone hopes. 
</P>
<P>
By 1990, Hedgecock had become less a man on trial than a touchstone, a human 
Green Line dividing a city into political and philosophical camps. It's a good 
bet that the many people who have migrated here in the years since Hedgecock 
was charged in 1984 with campaign-financing crimes can tell you whether they're 
"pro-Roger" or "anti-Roger." But they probably can't begin to describe the 
crimes of which he was actually accused. 
</P>
<P>
You see, in the modern San Diego lexicon, being "pro-Roger" means being 
anti-Establishment, anti-Miller, anti-Mayor Maureen O'Connor and anti-Copley 
Press. Roger's legions consist of snarling, long-suffering "little guys," who 
want to throw the bums out and who have been waiting for justice for their 
hero. It's a civic division that the trial on charges of campaign-law 
violations exacerbated and that Hedgecock exploits daily on his local radio 
show. But it is a schism that doesn't help San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with Hedgecock free of the threat of jail and ensconced behind his 
microphone -- enjoying considerable clout but forswearing a future bid for 
office -- the soap opera has something of an ending. Sure, Hedgecock won't stop 
hammering at City Hall and his detractors won't soon forgive him. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps with the matter settled and O'Connor stepping down in two years, 
San Diego is poised to begin a new political era.

DEAL FOR STRAWBERRY SEEMS TO MAKE FANS OF BOTH SIDES HAPPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Daaaaaaryl. Daaaaaaryl. The hometown kid is coming home. Thanks to Dodgers' 
Vice President Fred Claire (and $20 million), Crenshaw High's Darryl Strawberry 
will be a Dodger for at least the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
This is the best thing Claire or the Dodgers have ever done. Without 
hesitation, Claire went after and got baseball's premier power hitter. The 
die-hard Dodger fans are all well aware of the Dodgers' bad luck with free 
agency (with the exception of one swing by Kirk Gibson), and so, we all held 
our breath, praying that Claire and the Dodgers didn't let Strawberry get away 
like a certain slugging free agent did in 1977. That slugger, Reggie Jackson, 
of course, proceeded to then help the Yankees to two straight World Series 
victories over the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Those of you who bleed blue blood became instant fortune tellers as soon as 
Strawberry filed for free agency, sure that the Dodgers wouldn't sign him and 
have the Mets beat up on the Dodgers for the rest of Strawberry's long and 
fruitful career. But unlike past disappointments, Claire came through, so let 
the championships start flowing in.

HEADLINE UNFAIRLY RIPPED DOUCETTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I just had an opportunity to read your "Viewpoint" column in last Saturday's 
edition of The Times. 
</P>
<P>
I was aghast to see such a large damaging headline applied to such a petty 
article about Eddie Doucette. I believe Doucette does a great job of selling 
the Rams without much to work with this year. The article was a small 
viewpoint; your headline was a large injustice.

STATUS OF SEAU, BERNSTINE UNCERTAIN

<P>
Linebacker Junior Seau, who suffered a pulled groin Thursday in practice, 
wasn't sure Friday whether he would be ready for Sunday's game at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Seau practiced in a limited capacity Friday and said the injury hadn't improved 
since Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
What are his chances? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to say anything about Sunday," he said. "All I know is that we 
play the Chiefs." 
</P>
<P>
Tight end Rod Bernstine might not play on Sunday, either. Bernstine is still 
recovering from a hamstring injury he sustained last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Just jogging doesn't bother me," he said, "but bursting and stuff like that 
does." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dan Henning said he would decide Sunday morning whether to activate Seau 
and Bernstine. 
</P>
<P>
Nose tackle Joe Phillips, recovering from an assault Sept. 26 that required him 
to have surgery to repair his eye orbit, is back into a workout routine. 
</P>
<P>
He was at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium Friday lifting weights. He is 24 pounds 
lighter than he was before the beating and says his bench-press capability is 
down from 550 pounds to 450 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Darrin Nelson used to do a lot less standing around than he does 
now. He is the fourth running back of four. In nine games, he has carried twice 
for nine yards and caught two passes for 19. 
</P>
<P>
Last year in 10 games with the Chargers, Nelson caught 31 passes for 328 yards 
and rushed 36 times for 197 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson isn't fazed by the situation. This is his 10th season in the NFL, and he 
is aware that the end of his football career is approaching. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say I'm bored," Nelson said. "It gets a little frustrating. But 
Marion (Butts) is doing a good job, and Ronnie (Harmon) is going to be here a 
lot longer than I am. He might as well get the experience." DON PATTERSON

PADRES TALK TO VALENZUELA

The Padres have had preliminary talks with free agent left-hander Fernando 
Valenzuela, Joe McIlvaine, Padre general manager, said Friday night. But 
McIlvaine refused to divulge whether the Padres are willing to make the 
starting pitcher a contract offer. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some contact with him," McIlvaine said, "but I can't tell you how 
interested we are. I haven't even told his agent (Tony DeMarco). We'll just 
have to wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, a six-time All-Star, spent the past nine years with the Dodgers 
before filing for free agency. The Dodgers, who paid Valenzuela $2 million this 
past season, said they are not interested in re-signing him. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, 30, was 13-13 with a 4.59 earned-run average this past season. 
Although he pitched a no-hitter June 29 against the St. Louis Cardinals, he was 
1-3 with an 8.40 ERA in his last six starts. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres, who have an opening for the fifth spot in their rotation, also have 
been contacted by left-hander Teddy Higuera (11-10, 3.76 ERA), who filed for 
free agency from the Milwaukee Brewers. McIlvaine declined to reveal the 
Padres' interest, if any. 
</P>
<P>
In other news, the Padres completed their organizational meeting by obtaining 
third baseman Tom Redington of the Atlanta Braves, who were attempting to 
outright him on waivers.

KC'S FIRST ROAD VICTORY COMES AGAINST GULLS 
</P>

<P>
Just when the Gulls started to look like contenders, they lifted the facade and 
played like pretenders. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, the Gulls played their last card and folded, 7-4, to Kansas City, 
a loss witnessed by 5,673 at the San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, one step forward, two steps back. Will the real Gulls please stand 
up? 
</P>
<P>
More often than not, the Gulls' (9-8-2) have shown muscle in taking leads into 
the third period, having gone 7-0 in such situations. Moreover, Friday's 
opponent hadn't won in its last eight tries and had never won on the road. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the flexing ended when Kansas City's (3-15-1) scoring barrage began. 
</P>
<P>
After taking a 3-2 lead into the third, the Gulls extended it briefly to 4-2 
when Darcy Norton scored from the right wing at 2:25 on a short pass taken from 
Darren Lowe behind the net. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City came alive and scored three goals, two within a 1:06 span, giving 
the Blades a 5-4 lead at 13:54, which they extended by two once the Gulls 
looked like they felt it was already over. 
</P>
<P>
It was the most prolific period by a Gulls' opponent all season. 
</P>
<P>
"We beat two teams tonight," Kansas City Coach Doug Soetaert said, "the Gulls 
and the guys in stripes. This is our first road win, and hopefully this will 
help us turn the corner." 
</P>
<P>
It's not certain what kind of turn the Gulls took with this performance. 
</P>
<P>
But there were bright moments. This is no longer a one- or two-man show. 
</P>
<P>
Little had been heard from several Gulls in previous games, but defenseman 
Derek Mayer, the hero from the Nov. 9 shootout victory against Kansas City, 
scored his first goal of the season; centers Mike Sullivan and Norton scored 
their second and third; and right wing Robbie Nichols chalked up his first 
point of the season with an assist. 
</P>
<P>
"They were a determined team all right," said Gulls' Coach Mike O'Connell. "We 
were hoping instead of making it happen. We didn't play well from the start." 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls' 1-0 first-period lead and goalie Scott Brower's scoreless streak of 
almost 82 minutes both dissolved at 1:51 in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Giffin mimicked the opening goal by Dennis Holland from the left circle, 
but the Gulls traded the next three goals with the Blades, and took a 3-2 edge 
into the third. 
</P>
<P>
Having only recently discovered the merits of scoring first, the Gulls, through 
the efforts of Holland, did so Friday, for the fifth time this year. 
</P>
<P>
Already proud of their power-play proficiency, the Gulls made an IHL-leading 
statistic even better, and got its 27th power-play goal at 12:46. 
</P>
<P>
Heading toward Cohen from the left point, Holland focused, put his head down 
and beat Cohen on the right side with a slapshot from the circle. 
</P>
<P>
Gull Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls on Friday started goalie Scott Brower (1-2-1), who was coming off his 
first professional shutout Wednesday against Phoenix. It was the first time 
since Oct. 10 and 12 -- both were losses -- that Brower has made back-to-back 
starts. . . . Add Goalie: Kansas City started Paul Cohen in goal Friday. It was 
the first KC start for Cohen, who was acquired earlier in the week from the New 
York Islanders. . . . The IHL's second-leading scorer, Brent Sapergia (15 
goals) of the Gulls celebrated his 28th birthday Friday. . . . Sunday's 
starting time against Salt Lake is 6:05 p.m. at the San Diego Sports Arena. 
There is a free family skate from 3 to 4:15 Sunday for ticket holders.

FED TRIES TO CUT LOAN RATE AMID RECESSION SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Federal Reserve Board, seeking to bolster the weakening economy, signaled 
its intention Friday to nudge interest rates down another quarter of a 
percentage point, as new reports showed that the economy continues to be 
buffeted by sharply rising oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
In a widely expected step, the nation's central bank sought to push the federal 
funds rate on interbank loans from the current 7.75% to 7.5%. The effort was 
stymied by an unexpected rash of heavy borrowing in the markets, but analysts 
said the Fed would try again next week. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed's action occurred as the government published new evidence that the oil 
price surge related to the Persian Gulf crisis continued to push the U.S. 
economy further toward recession in September and October as consumer prices 
soared and the nation posted another large monthly trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Economists said there is little doubt that the combination of figures reported 
Friday added to earlier evidence that the economy has entered a recession. 
</P>
<P>
"Recession is winning the day," said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston 
Company, a financial services firm in New York. "Oil prices are pushing up the 
consumer price index, but . . . recession is overweighing everything." 
</P>
<P>
Both the inflation and trade figures were bearish by any standard. Largely 
because of the jump in oil prices, the Labor Department's monthly inflation 
index jumped by 0.6% in October, after increases of 0.8% in the two previous 
months. It was the worst three-month price rise since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the trade deficit, bloated by high costs for imported oil, continued 
essentially unchanged at $9.41 billion in September, just slightly below the 
previous month's high level of $9.73 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Since Iraq invaded Kuwait, Americans' cost of living has risen at an annual 
rate of 8.9%, nearly double the 4.6% rate for all of last year. Fuel oil prices 
have shot up more than 50% in the last three months, and gasoline prices have 
soared nearly 27%. 
</P>
<P>
However, economists noted that the so-called "core" inflation rate -- excluding 
volatile food and energy prices -- rose by only 0.3%, signaling that the oil 
price hikes are not rippling through the rest of the economy as rapidly as some 
had feared. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the action by the Fed was taken partly in response to Friday's 
relatively modest rise in this core rate. The Fed's policy-setting Federal Open 
Market Committee had met Tuesday and apparently decided to nudge interest rates 
down if inflation did not worsen. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's effort by the Fed was the second time in recent weeks that the central 
bank has sought to cut the federal funds rate on interbank loans by a quarter 
of a percentage point. Barely one month ago, the Fed pushed the rate down to 
7.75%, from 8%, in response to congressional passage of the budget accord. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fed signaled a desire to ease to 7.5%, but credit demand is too high to 
allow them to get there in a single afternoon," said Alan Levenson, an 
economist and Fed analyst at the WEFA Group, an economic forecasting firm based 
in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
The action by the Fed was expected to ease tensions between the central bank 
and the White House, which has been pressuring Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan to 
cut rates to help avert a recession. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Fed has been reluctant to ease interest rates as rapidly as the 
Bush Administration has wanted because of fear that the move might backfire and 
worsen inflation and possibly make it more difficult to attract foreign 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
The $9.4-billion trade deficit reported for September was slightly better than 
the $9.7-billion deficit recorded in August, but it was essentially in line 
with the $9.3-billion red-ink figure reported for July. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding oil exports and imports, the deficit was $3.8 billion, compared to $5 
billion in August. In constant 1987 dollars, the September deficit was $7 
billion, compared to $8.5 billion the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
Mainly because of the surge in prices, oil imports soared by $1.4 billion to a 
new level of $6.2 billion, even though the total number of barrels imported was 
virtually unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The average cost per barrel was $24.31, compared to $17.31 in August. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding petroleum, however, imports fell by $2 billion, as recession-wary 
importers sought to hold inventories down. Imports of consumer goods, 
automobiles and capital goods were lower, reflecting across-the-board 
retrenchment. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, exports declined for the second consecutive month, reflecting 
a slowdown in the economies of some of the major U.S. trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
Exports fell to $31.8 billion in September, slightly lower than the $32.5 
billion in August. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the decline casts doubt on hopes by some economists that 
expanding exports will mitigate the recession. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the bearishness of Friday's reports, economists found one silver 
lining: If the economy falls into recession, it may help keep inflation in 
check. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Brinner, economist at DRI-McGraw Hill, an economic forecasting firm based 
in Lexington, Mass., said that, if the slowdown proves to be as deep as some 
forecasters expect, "we'll lock in a 3.5% annual rate" of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"But we expect unemployment at 7% by spring," Brinner noted. "If that happens," 
he said, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein "will have done the Fed's work" in 
slowing the rate of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The slower core inflation rate reported Friday was widely regarded as another 
open door for the Fed to reduce interest rates another notch. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said they believe that the Fed's move on Friday clearly marked an 
effort to cut rates. 
</P>
<P>
The upward pressure in the inflation report was all from oil prices, save for 
one perennial exception: the cost of medical care, up 0.8%, and medical 
services, up 0.9% -- areas that seem recession proof and impervious to any 
inflation-cutting strategies. 
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices rose 7.7% in the month and have risen 26.9% in the last three 
months and 36.9% so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
The higher energy prices pushed transportation costs, public and private, up 
2.1% for the month. Altogether, inflation is running at an annual rate of 6.7% 
so far this year -- compared to a 4.7% rate through October, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Before seasonal adjustment, the consumer price index increased 0.8 of a point 
to 133.5, from a base of 100 in 1982-84. A cross section of goods and services 
costing $100 in the base period would have cost $133.50 last month. 
</P>
<P>
Retail prices in the Los Angeles-Anaheim-Long Beach metropolitan area increased 
0.7% in October, after a 1% increase in September. Consumer price inflation 
over the last 12 months stands at 6.7% in the metropolitan area, compared to 
6.3% nationwide.

FBI SEARCHES SEN. ROBBINS' ENCINO HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS and LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal agents armed with a search warrant raided the Encino home of Sen. Alan 
Robbins on Friday in the latest phase of a continuing investigation of 
corruption in the state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
The search, which was conducted by the FBI, is the strongest indication to date 
that the U.S. attorney's office in Sacramento is pressing ahead with a possible 
case against Robbins, a veteran Democrat whose business deals have come under 
investigators' scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
Agents at Robbins' house refused to describe the nature of their search to a 
Times reporter. But among those present was Jim Wedick, a Sacramento-based 
agent who has played a central role in the FBI's political corruption probe 
since it began more than five years ago. Wedick said he could not comment. 
</P>
<P>
Contacted by phone after the search, Robbins said, "I have been advised that 
it's not appropriate to comment on it (the investigation)." 
</P>
<P>
An aide to the lawmaker acknowledged that Robbins was home at the time of the 
raid, which began in the morning and lasted for a matter of hours. 
</P>
<P>
Several agents were at the lawmaker's large, Tudor-style home, which has a 
commanding view of the San Fernando Valley below. One of them held a hand-drawn 
map and a flashlight, apparently to guide him on his search of the residence. 
</P>
<P>
As reported earlier in The Times, a federal grand jury in Sacramento has been 
investigating almost every aspect of Robbins' extensive business dealings and 
political activities to determine if the state senator abused his office for 
personal financial gain. 
</P>
<P>
One of the allegations made before a grand jury is that Robbins and California 
Coastal Commissioner Mark L. Nathanson were part of an elaborate scheme to 
extort $250,000 from a San Diego hotel developer. Attorneys for both men have 
denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
The search of Robbins' home required that a judge be persuaded that it would 
turn up evidence linked to the commission of a crime. The warrant and 
supporting documents with details of the allegations and the nature of the 
search have not yet been made public. 
</P>
<P>
A source familiar with the probe said that authorities were looking for 
financial records, at least some of which involved the San Diego hotel 
developer, Jack Naiman. Naiman has told investigators that he was put in "a 
squeeze" after he asked Robbins to help him fight a rival hotel project. 
</P>
<P>
The 47-year-old politician, who has served in the Senate for 17 years, has a 
long history of being caught up in controversy, only to emerge unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
There is even a long-running dispute over whether he actually lives in the 20th 
Senate District, where he was handily reelected earlier this month with 59% of 
the vote. Robbins makes no secret that the house where he lives -- the one 
raided by the FBI -- is outside his district. But he is registered to vote at a 
second residence, the North Hollywood home of his former father-in-law, which 
is inside the district boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires that legislators be residents of their districts at the time 
they run for office, but Robbins has long contended that he is entitled to pick 
his own residence for voting purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins' name first came to light as a possible subject of the federal 
corruption probe in August, 1988, when federal agents searched the Capitol 
offices of four lawmakers. Although they did not search Robbins' office at the 
time of that raid, the FBI did interview Robbins at his Sacramento-area home. 
</P>
<P>
The Capitol search was the first public sign of an FBI sting operation, 
code-named Brispec (for bribery-special interest), in which agents posing as 
businessmen tried to win support for bills that would supposedly help them 
start up a shrimp-processing plant near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the sting, two former Democratic state senators, Joseph B. 
Montoya of Whittier and Paul Carpenter of Norwalk, were convicted on political 
corruption charges earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the Capitol raid, Robbins insisted that he was not a target of 
the FBI probe. And several sources familiar with the investigation indicated 
initially that it was unlikely that Robbins would ever be prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
But tapes released during the Montoya and Carpenter trials showed that Robbins 
had played a role in passage of the special-interest bills to benefit the FBI's 
phony companies. 
</P>
<P>
And according to sources familiar with the probe, the FBI's investigators 
received a number of allegations about Robbins' personal business transactions 
and, as a result, reopened their files on Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs reported from Sacramento and Berger from Encino. Times staff writer Mark 
Gladstone also contributed to this story.

YELTSIN ASKS LEGISLATURE FOR CRISIS GOVERNMENT; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: GORBACHEV IS UPSTAGED BY THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT, WHO CALLS FOR A 
VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE.

Upstaging Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Russian Federation leader 
Boris N. Yeltsin called Friday on the country's legislature to replace the 
government with an emergency "anti-crisis committee" and to seek urgent food 
aid from the West to stave off famine. 
</P>
<P>
"The economic and political crisis is becoming extremely acute. The patience of 
the people has reached its limit," Yeltsin ominously told the Supreme Soviet at 
a crucial session called by the legislature to assess the deteriorating state 
of the nation. "At any moment, an explosion can occur." 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers had convened to hear Gorbachev report on the country's economic, 
social and ethnic troubles, but he dismayed many on both the left and right by 
delivering a rambling, often testy 80-minute discourse instead of precise 
remedies that would arrest the downward Soviet spiral. 
</P>
<P>
"No prophet can help Gorbachev now; he's missed the boat," one prominent 
conservative, Vasily Starodubstev, the head of the Peasants Union, said in 
disgust. Genrikh Igityan, an acerbic Armenian, said Gorbachev seemed as out of 
touch with Soviet problems as an emigre who had been abroad for years. 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, Friday's speech was a bad blunder by Gorbachev, who is trying 
to stem burgeoning ethnic and political rivalries before they cause the breakup 
of the country. Moreover, events inside the snow-wreathed Kremlin disclosed an 
unparalleled lack of confidence in Gorbachev among political decision-makers 
only two days before he is to leave Moscow for Rome and Paris. 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the 59-year-old Soviet leader's ability to ride out his country's 
assorted crises will be a major topic of discussion in the corridors of the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, to be attended by both 
Gorbachev and President Bush. So will the question of whether the West should 
aid the Soviet Union to safeguard Gorbachev's perestroika reforms, and if so, 
on what scale. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Soviet lawmakers, alarmed at what they had seen in their 
districts during a holiday recess, changed their agenda to seek a way out of 
the country's crisis. Glowering and confident, Yeltsin strode to the podium to 
deliver his concise and specific recommendations, a pointed contrast with 
Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
First, the Russian populist -- shown by opinion polls to be the country's 
most-respected politician -- called upon the legislature to follow the Russian 
Parliament's lead and pass a vote of no confidence in the government of Prime 
Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who is blamed by Yeltsin for hamstringing economic 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
Second, he said, power must pass from the Council of Ministers, or Soviet 
Cabinet, that Ryzhkov heads to an "extraordinary anti-crisis committee" that 
would include representatives of each Soviet republic. Gorbachev "must hold 
consultations about this with all republics within the next two weeks," said 
Yeltsin, who implied that the president should also be accountable to the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, "the No. 1 crisis for Russia and the country is food," he declared. 
"The situation is extremely grave; it has no precedent in the past several 
decades. In some cities, the food stocks are good for two or three days. And 
this is in the sixth year of perestroika! 
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that we must cast aside our pride and appeal to the developed 
Western countries for urgent food aid, perhaps in the form of a lend-lease 
scheme," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Yeltsin said strategic reserves stockpiled by the Soviet 
government "for the next war" could be tapped if needed and a nationwide system 
of ration cards issued. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the country and the republic (Russia) have the potential of 
averting famine this winter," he said, cautioning that time cannot be wasted: 
"We must take extraordinary, urgent measures to hold on through this winter." 
</P>
<P>
As the Soviet Union's state-run economy breaks down, or is shattered into 
fragments by ethnic and political disputes, food supplies have been disrupted 
so seriously that rationing was introduced this week in Leningrad and is 
planned for Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev admitted that current shortages are bad but said his opponents are 
spreading "vile rumors that the country will be hungry and cold" to discredit 
his reform drive. This year's grain harvest was 23 million tons more than in 
1989, he said, but some areas -- including Yeltsin's Russia -- are not making 
deliveries of staples such as meat and milk mandated by the Five-Year Plan. 
</P>
<P>
"Separatism will only complicate the situation further," Gorbachev said, 
thumping the lectern with his hand for emphasis. "We can only get out of this 
crisis together." 
</P>
<P>
He sought to reassure legislators and the nation as a whole that the Soviet 
leadership knows the way out of the present difficulties. "There is a plan; it 
just has to be carried out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But for lawmakers, Gorbachev's speech was short on specifics. Many said he made 
only one identifiable new proposal -- a request for a "moratorium" to halt the 
administrative tug-of-war between the Kremlin and newly assertive parliaments 
in the republics as a new federal arrangement, the Union Treaty, is formulated. 
</P>
<P>
The president also said personnel changes would be made soon at the top 
echelons of the Soviet armed forces -- intriguing wording that could presage 
the departure of Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov -- and in similarly vague 
terms, spoke of plans to create a "government with a broad social basis." 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to hear a program for action and not excuses and complaints about 
difficulties and obstacles," Anatoly A. Sobchak, the progressive mayor of 
Leningrad, told reporters later. "The issue of the day is not forming a new 
government, but imposing emergency measures, a state of emergency." 
</P>
<P>
However, in what could herald a compromise between the two most powerful 
figures in Soviet politics, Gorbachev adviser Georgy K. Shakhnazarov told 
journalists that Yeltsin's proposal for an anti-crisis committee "was exactly 
the same" as what Gorbachev now has in mind.

Yeltsin last Sunday called upon Gorbachev to form a "coalition government of 
national unity" and claimed that Gorbachev had agreed to it in principle in 
their five-hour meeting. The Soviet president, however, told the 542-member 
legislature that to share power with Russia alone would be unfair to the other 
14 Soviet republics. 
</P>
<P>
In debate that is to continue today, a parade of lawmakers and local leaders 
trooped to the microphone to fix blame for the Soviet Union's woes and offer 
solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"There is danger of a social riot," warned the president of Armenia, Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan. He shrugged off Gorbachev's proposal for a moratorium, saying, 
"It is clear to all that it won't go through." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Gorbachev's hopes for a rejuvenated Soviet Union, the envoy of 
Georgia's newly elected nationalist government, Akaky Asatiani, served official 
notice that his homeland, which "lost its national independence in 1921 due to 
Soviet Russia's aggression," will not sign the Union Treaty proposed by 
Gorbachev and is bent on recovering statehood. 
</P>
<P>
Envoys from Latvia and Estonia said they also want no part of even a 
"new-style" Soviet Union, and the third of the independence-minded Baltic 
republics, Lithuania, did not even bother to send a representative to address 
the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
From the sidelines, ousted Communist conservative Yegor K. Ligachev watched the 
discordant spectacle with relish. "This is like Krilov!" the Siberian said at 
one point with a laugh, referring to a Russian writer famous for his tale of 
how a crab, swan and pike hitched to a cart end up pulling it in three 
directions.

NEW VENUS IMAGES DAZZLE WITH 'PANCAKE' VOLCANOES; 
</P>
<P>
SPACE: MAGELLAN SPACECRAFT ALSO REVEALS MOUNTAINS AND VALLEYS SEEMINGLY COVERED 
WITH FOOL'S GOLD.

<P>
The Magellan spacecraft has sent back dazzling new pictures of the surface of 
Venus showing mysterious pancake-like volcanoes and mountains and valleys that 
appear to be covered with gold. 
</P>
<P>
Fool's gold, that is, not the real stuff. The new images were released one day 
after the spacecraft broke communications with Earth for the third time, but 
this time it took only minutes for controllers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
in Pasadena to regain control. Magellan project manager Anthony Spear said 
changes in Magellan's computer software that were radioed to the spacecraft a 
month ago allowed engineers to resume photographing the surface of Venus within 
three orbits, compared to several days of lost time after the two earlier 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers and scientists were delighted Friday that controllers had been able 
to correct the problem so quickly, and they were absolutely enchanted by the 
images the spacecraft sent back. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the tortured landscape of Venus -- with its volcanoes, craters, 
mountains and ancient rivers of lava -- is hidden from view, but the radar 
system aboard Magellan pierces through the dense clouds that envelop the 
planet. The system produces images that look like shots of the Earth from a 
high-altitude aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
But the scene on Venus is quite different from the blue oceans and green 
forests seen on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Photos released by JPL on Friday depict a barren, rugged landscape, pockmarked 
with huge craters and twisted and torn by dynamic forces that have left the 
surface of Venus a weathered and foreboding place. Among the most intriguing 
images is one showing seven pancakes that apparently were formed by a series of 
oozing volcanic eruptions. 
</P>
<P>
The pancakes measure about 15 miles in diameter and are about 2,500 feet tall, 
said Magellan project scientist Stephen Saunders. They are startling in their 
near-perfect symmetry, and they stretch across the Venusian landscape like 
cookies dropped on a tin plate. 
</P>
<P>
The photo of the pancakes, like the thousands of other images being created at 
JPL from narrow strips of data collected as Magellan glides around the planet, 
should help scientists sort out the history of Venus and the dynamic processes 
that are still reshaping the planet that is most like the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Saunders said scientists hope to learn something about the consistency of the 
magma that lies beneath the Venusian surface by studying the tidy string of 
volcanic pancakes. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan continues to turn up mysteries as well as answers to questions that 
have troubled scientists for years. For example, some of the images show great 
fields and mountain slopes that appear to be covered with snow. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like snow, but we are talking about (a surface temperature) of 700 
degrees Fahrenheit, so it certainly isn't ice," said Gordon H. Pettengill of 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, principal investigator for radar 
science. 
</P>
<P>
To investigate this, Pettengill used Magellan's radar to measure the radiation 
emitted by the surface of the planet. The "emission," as it is called, depends 
mostly on the composition of the surface, and it offers clues to the chemical 
nature of the material on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the "emissivity" of the areas that look as though they are covered 
with snow, Pettengill believes the substance is most likely iron pyrite, also 
known as fool's gold. 
</P>
<P>
But that answers one question while posing another. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know where it comes from," if indeed it is iron pyrite, he said. On 
Earth, the material is associated with volcanic activity, and Venus has plenty 
of volcanoes, but normally water is also required. Pettengill suggested that 
the material may form on Venus in the absence of water because of the high 
temperatures on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
The Magellan images also show what appear to be enormous riverbeds winding 
through the hills. But these were never rivers like those on Earth. They were 
once rivers of molten lava, so hot that it burned its way into the surface as 
it flowed for hundreds of miles, creating scars across a landscape that is void 
of life. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Magellan has covered more than 18% of the surface of Venus, an area 
roughly equivalent to all of North and South America. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect to get something like 80% of the planet" in the first phase of the 
operation, said Spear, the project manager. That is even better than the goal 
of 70% set before the mission began Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
A second phase is to begin May 1, during which Magellan will continue to map 
the surface of Venus as the planet spins within the spacecraft's polar orbit. 
JPL, which manages the Magellan program, is run by Caltech for the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Spear said Friday that it is still not known for certain why the spacecraft has 
severed communications with JPL three times, but the leading candidate is 
electronic "noise" somewhere in the system. 
</P>
<P>
Every now and then, Spear said, the noise overwhelms the system and "zaps the 
computer." At that point, the craft turns its largest antenna away from Earth 
"and stares at the weeds," he said.

HURD MAY BID FOR TORY LEADERSHIP POST IF THATCHER FALTERS

British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd on Friday reserved the right to enter 
the Tory party leadership battle if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher falters in 
the first ballot Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The only challenge Thatcher faces in that vote is from former Defense Secretary 
Michael Heseltine, who is presenting himself as best able to ensure a 
Conservative victory in the next election. 
</P>
<P>
If Thatcher fails to get 214 votes from the 372 Tory members of Parliament who 
will pick the party's leader -- and thereby the country's prime minister -- 
there will be a second, and possibly third round. 
</P>
<P>
Hurd, seen as the likeliest compromise candidate in a stalemate, was asked 
Friday whether he would rule himself out of the race. He replied simply: 
"Against her." 
</P>
<P>
This left the possibility that if Thatcher is so humiliated in the first round 
Tuesday that she withdraws, he might enter the race. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher's aides are confident that she will win in the first round but say 
that she would continue to fight. Hurd, who nominated Thatcher for reelection, 
stressed that he expects the prime minister to win on the first ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher will be in Paris for the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe when the votes on her future are counted.

FARM SUBSIDIES STILL SNAG WORLD TRADE PACT, U.S. SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMICS: RIFT WITH EUROPEANS MAKES YEUTTER 'VERY PESSIMISTIC' ABOUT REACHING 
AN AGREEMENT.

<P>
Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter met with European Community officials 
Friday and emerged "very pessimistic" about the prospects for concluding an 
agreement to boost world trade. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'm usually an optimist," said Yeutter, in Brussels with a delegation of 
U.S. officials headed by Secretary of State James A. Baker III. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, appearing at a news conference with Yeutter and other U.S. and European 
officials, dismissed a suggestion by a Soviet official in New York that 
opponents of Iraq's occupation of Kuwait should try a fresh diplomatic 
initiative before advancing along the road to military force. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm told he was speaking for himself, representing his personal views," Baker 
said of Yevgeny M. Primakov, Moscow's chief Mideast negotiator, who has been 
acting as Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's special envoy on the Persian 
Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Baker was embarking on a weekend of lobbying smaller nations to support a new 
U.N. resolution approving the use of force to eject Iraqi troops from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The endangered trade talks dominated the private session between U.S. and 
European officials. Four years of talks involving about 100 nations are 
scheduled to conclude in Brussels in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
However, a dispute between the United States and the 12 European Community 
nations is threatening to block an accord. U.S. negotiators are seeking 
reductions of 75% and more in governmental subsidies to farmers, but Europe has 
offered reductions of only 30%. 
</P>
<P>
Other participants in Friday's meeting expressed more optimism than Yeutter 
although none cited any signs of concrete progress. 
</P>
<P>
"The time we spent on agriculture was useful," said U.S. Trade Representative 
Carla A. Hills. ". . . We are always ready to negotiate." 
</P>
<P>
From the European side, Frans Andriessen, Hills' counterpart as the European 
Community's chief trade negotiator, conceded that "there are major problems" 
but said the atmosphere in the meeting was constructive. 
</P>
<P>
However, Yeutter said he saw no evidence of movement by the Europeans on what 
he called the two central issues: 
</P>
<P>
* Export subsidies. The United States has proposed that governments slash by 
90% their subsidies to exporters, which Yeutter said are used to "buy foreign 
markets" for their farmers. Yeutter said he found no willingness among the 
European Community officials to dismantle their export-subsidy system. 
</P>
<P>
* Market-opening measures. U.S. negotiators have sought 75% reductions in 
governmental subsidies to farmers who sell their products domestically. Yeutter 
said the Europeans showed no sign of such deep cuts in a program that, he said, 
closes European markets to Third World nations that have little industry and 
desperately need to sell their agriculture produce to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the principal purposes of this exercise," Yeutter said of the trade 
talks, "is to let farmers compete for markets" on an equal footing. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is only one of 15 categories in the international trade talks, and 
negotiators are nearing agreement on some of the others. But officials fear 
that the whole package might fall apart if the United States and Europe cannot 
reach an agricultural accord. 
</P>
<P>
On the Persian Gulf crisis, Baker told the news conference that he talked for 
13 hours last week with Gorbachev and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze. 
</P>
<P>
"Both of them pointed out," he said, "that we have a common position on Iraq's 
aggression: There should be no rewards, no partial solution -- full 
implementation of U.N. resolutions -- and no linking of the gulf with other 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
Primakov, in an interview with the New York Times, said an effort should be 
made to persuade Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to give up Kuwait peacefully in 
return for a promise by the major powers to promote a broader Mideast 
settlement, presumably meaning an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the U.N. Security Council should not be rushed into approving a 
resolution authorizing the use of force. If such a resolution is adopted, 
Primakov said, it should be followed immediately by an attack on Iraqi 
positions in Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
A senior official traveling with Baker said Thursday that the secretary will 
consult with five of the 10 non-permanent members of the Security Council today 
and Sunday in an effort to win support for a U.N. resolution authorizing the 
use of force. 
</P>
<P>
All five permanent members -- France, Britain, the Soviet Union, China and, of 
course, the United States -- apparently favor such a move, at least 
tentatively. Nine affirmative votes of the 15-member Council are required for 
passage. 
</P>
<P>
Baker also said the United States has tried to discourage well-known figures 
from going to Iraq to plead for the release of their countries' hostages. Most 
recent among such emissaries were former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt 
and former British Prime Minister Edward Heath. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope prominent personalities will not permit themselves to be used (by 
Iraq) in order to send confusing and mixed messages to the world about the 
(anti-Iraq) coalition's unity and resolve," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, diplomats at the United Nations said Baker recently discussed with 
Canadian officials the possibility of the United States organizing a foreign 
ministers meeting of Security Council members to underscore the importance of 
the resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq, if it is voted. 
</P>
<P>
Such a meeting, at which the foreign ministers would cast their nations' 
ballots, could give the resolution more authority, some ambassadors believe. 
Nations are normally represented by their U.N. ambassadors. 
</P>
<P>
"The Americans . . . .may wish to underline, stress the importance of the 
meeting by having it at the ministerial level," said Canadian Ambassador Yves 
Fortier. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, there are no drafts of a use of force resolution being 
circulated. But diplomats have been considering outside of council chambers a 
number of paragraphs that eventually could end up in drafts of such a 
resolution. 
</P>

story.

MAIL FOR TROOPS IS PILING UP IN THE SAND; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: MORE THAN 200 TONS OF LETTERS AND PACKAGES ARE STILL UNSORTED AT AN 
AIRFIELD IN THE DESERT.

<P>
More than 200 tons of mail for U.S. troops deployed for Operation Desert Shield 
waits unsorted in the sand at an airfield here, too much to suit Air Force 
Staff Sgt. Rance Bell. 
</P>
<P>
"What we really need, Colonel, is space -- space and people," Bell pleaded to a 
senior officer Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Iraqi takeover of Kuwait, Bell had an easy, if lonely, job 
processing what little U.S. military mail came in to the Arab world. Since 
Desert Shield began, the flow of letters and packages has doubled weekly, 
leaving Bell in what he calls "a nightmare situation." 
</P>
<P>
After the latest avalanche of mail was unloaded Friday from Air Force C-141 
transports, the backlog of unprocessed letters from home took up an acre or 
more of sand. Bell counted and found 205 cargo pallets yet to be handled, 
despite a round-the-clock effort to sort and distribute mail in the converted 
aircraft hangar that has been turned into the main American post office in 
Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"Four days ago, we had fewer than 100 pallets," Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
American officers say mail volume has been about average for a U.S. military 
operation of this size. But the immensity and quickness of the U.S. buildup 
here have swamped the small detachment assigned to postal duty and put more 
demand on scarce facilities. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, the unsorted mail was kept in a yard outside the post office 
hangar. But the yard was commandeered for more crucial supplies, forcing 
handlers to scatter the mail around the sandy fields beside aircraft taxiways. 
</P>
<P>
With so much mail on the ground, the process of sorting and distributing it has 
been slowed even more. "You try to work the older mail first -- but sometimes 
it is hard even to find the older mail," said Capt. Phillip Jewitt, the Air 
Force officer in charge of postal service in eastern Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Early Christmas mailings by Americans with loved ones in the Middle East are 
partly to blame for the onslaught, Jewitt said, which suggests that the backlog 
will likely intensify as the holidays near. The number of troops assigned to 
Operation Desert Shield is also expected to grow by another 200,000 by 
mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
More than in past military operations, letter-writing campaigns back home have 
resulted in a high volume of mail -- as much as 30% -- addressed simply to "Any 
Soldier." Those letters add to the crush, but they are worth more in morale 
than they cost in efficiency of mail distribution, Jewitt said. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hate to discourage it," Jewitt said. "The guys really appreciate that 
stuff. It makes them feel that somebody cares that they're over here." 
</P>
<P>
Before the current backlog, some mail came through with surprising speed, 
Master Sgt. Gloria Greenwood said. "I got a package from Ohio in eight days," 
she said. "I was impressed." 
</P>
<P>
But some soldiers say that the mail delivery has seemed much slower recently, 
especially for letters. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a letter today that was mailed on the 6th (of November)," said Air Force 
Staff Sgt. Tim Tennant of San Diego, whose wife is also deployed in the Persian 
Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The workload is much different than Sgt. Bell expected when he transferred to 
Saudi Arabia last spring from Rhein-Main Air Base in Frankfurt, Germany, which 
at the time contained the world's busiest military postal center. He said he 
looked forward to an easier time in Saudi Arabia, where the staff was 18 people 
and "a heavy day was 50 or 60 bags of mail." 
</P>
<P>
Now, more than 160 people are assigned to mail-sorting duties, and 50 bags can 
be processed in less than half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I went from the frying pan into the fire," Bell said Friday, sweating 
despite a brisk wind that softened the midday heat. "But I've been doing this 
for eight years. I know how to move mail."

A Norwegian-flagged oil tanker spilled between 4 million and 6 million gallons 
of crude oil when it hit rough seas in a storm in the Atlantic Ocean earlier 
this week, the Coast Guard said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker, named the Berge Broker, spilled Arabian light crude oil about 700 
miles southeast of Nova Scotia on Tuesday, said Lt. Richard Gill of the U.S. 
Coast Guard in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker, bound for Newfoundland, apparently encountered an Atlantic storm, 
but it was not known if the storm directly caused the oil spill, Gill said. 
</P>
<P>
The captain of the Berge Broker apparently notified the Norwegian Consulate in 
New York about the incident. Calls placed to the consulate and its spokesman 
after business hours Friday were not immediately returned.

In a new U.N. Security Council resolution, a group of Arab and nonaligned 
nations Friday called for a U.N. observer force to monitor the treatment of 
Palestinians living in territories occupied by Israel and also for a conference 
of all 164 nations that signed the Fourth Geneva Convention. 
</P>
<P>
As the resolution stands now, a U.S. veto would be likely, officials indicated. 
</P>
<P>
But efforts are under way behind the scenes to modify the resolution's wording 
as council members awaited a decision by U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de 
Cuellar on whether to accept the invitation of Israel's government to send an 
emissary to study the problems of Palestinians in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
A U.N. spokeswoman said Perez de Cuellar will make his views known when he 
returns from Paris on Tuesday. The secretary general conferred Friday in Paris 
with his special envoy, Jean-Claude Aime, on consultations that Aime held in 
New York with Israeli diplomats about the potential trip. 
</P>
<P>
Israel has rejected a Security Council resolution calling for an investigation 
into violence Oct. 8 at the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, during which 20 
Palestinians were killed by police and security forces. But as a compromise, 
Israel agreed to accept a mission by Aime to discuss the treatment of 
Palestinians under Israeli occupation. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli diplomats hope their offer will temper the resolution introduced Friday 
in the Security Council by Colombia, Cuba, Malaysia and Yemen. It calls for 
deploying military observers stationed at the Jerusalem headquarters of the 
U.N. Truce Supervision Organization into the occupied territories to monitor 
the situation and to report back to the secretary general and the Security 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Truce Supervision Organization was established in 1948 to scrutinize a 
series of cease-fire agreements and armistices between Israel and Arab states. 
</P>
<P>
But Israel has served notice in advance that it vigorously opposes an observer 
force, and U.S. diplomats said they could not vote for Friday's resolution in 
its present form. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. statements left the door open for negotiations over the weekend. There was 
considerable sentiment among council members for a proposal by Perez de Cuellar 
that the 164 nations that signed the Fourth Geneva Convention hold a new 
conference, probably in Geneva, to discuss ways of protecting Palestinians in 
Israeli-occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
The Fourth Geneva Convention, covering the protection of civilians in areas 
occupied during a war, was signed Aug. 12, 1949. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution submitted to the council demanded that Israel's government 
accept the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention and scrupulously abide 
by its provisions. It endorsed the idea of convening a meeting of the 
document's signers to discuss possible new measures to strengthen the 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
Israel was among the original signers of the convention. However, it takes the 
position that it has sole responsibility, including the duty to maintain law 
and order, in territories it occupies. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates from Malaysia, Libya, Syria and the Organization of the Islamic 
Conference all spoke in favor of the resolution during council debate Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Observer Nasser Kidwa of the Palestine Liberation Organization indicated that 
some room exists for compromise on the new resolution, however. 
</P>
<P>
He said agreement with the United States would be "difficult; nevertheless we 
don't think it is impossible." He stressed, "We are ready to negotiate with 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
But the PLO observer added that monitoring by U.N. forces is an "essential 
factor" in the draft submitted to the council.

SHAMIR'S COALITION GAINS AN ULTRA-ORTHODOX PARTY

Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir expanded his ruling coalition Friday by 
signing on an ultra-Orthodox Jewish party with promises of stricter religious 
laws that include outlawing the sale of pork. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement with the Agudat Israel party gives greater stability to Shamir's 
5-month-old, right-wing government. 
</P>
<P>
But it also threatens to reopen old wounds between ultra-religious Jews who 
want biblical law enforced by the state and the secular majority, which fears 
religious coercion. 
</P>
<P>
Shamir's promise of sweeping religious legislation came amid demands by another 
government minister for tighter laws restricting the number of non-Jews coming 
to Israel with a huge wave of Soviet immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
The demand by Immigrant Absorption Minister Yitzhak Peretz, also an 
ultra-Orthodox Jew, has raised a political storm, with critics calling it 
racist, divisive and a threat to immigration. 
</P>
<P>
Peretz, who is in the Soviet Union, said he has discovered that one-third of 
the would-be immigrants are not Jewish. Israel has estimated that up to a 
million Soviets will arrive before the end of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone call to Shamir on Thursday, Peretz demanded that the government 
change the Law of Return, which allows Jews and certain of their non-Jewish 
family members to emigrate to Israel, said his spokeswoman Ida Ben-Shitrit. 
</P>
<P>
She said Peretz wants to bar non-Jewish grandchildren from immigrating because 
he feels it isn't enough if a grandparent is the last link to Judaism. Shamir's 
spokesman, Avi Pazner, said the premier will consider the issue when Peretz 
returns from Moscow next week. Peretz said his discovery that so many non-Jews 
plan to emigrate to Israel "hurts me."

BURTON BLAMES 'SELF-SERVING, INEPT' JERRY BROWN FOR FEINSTEIN'S DEFEAT; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: BUT OTHER DEMOCRATS SAY THE NOMINEE FOR GOVERNOR SHARES 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR HER LOSS TO PETE WILSON.

Internal bickering among California Democrats over blame for Dianne Feinstein's 
narrow gubernatorial defeat surfaced Friday in Florida as delegates to a 
meeting of state Democratic officials snickered over a letter harshly critical 
of state party chairman and former governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter dispatched to state Democratic Party chairmen meeting in Miami, 
California Assemblyman John Burton of San Francisco said Brown bungled the 
party's get-out-the-vote drive and doomed Feinstein to defeat. Feinstein lost 
to Republican Pete Wilson by 3% of the votes cast. 
</P>
<P>
Brown "is the most self-serving, inept politician that I have ever met in my 35 
years in politics," Burton's letter to the Democratic officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, defending his tenure as state party chairman, promptly labeled Burton "a 
yeller and a screamer" and said the assemblyman was "out of touch" with 
California Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"He's used to just yelling and having everybody shake," Brown said in a 
telephone interview from Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Burton's letter was only the latest bit of ammunition to be fired at or by 
Brown since the Feinstein defeat. As dispute over the election results 
continues, some Democrats have separated into camps. Others are openly 
chagrined that the tempest will further sour the party's image. 
</P>
<P>
While the shifting of blame is a traditional act for fratricidal Democrats, it 
has been heightened this year because of maneuvering over the two 1992 Senate 
races and the general tumult caused by the success of initiatives limiting the 
terms of elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Burton has raised the loudest public ruckus against Brown, and has 
himself come under criticism from Brown partisans. They contend that Burton is 
trying to undercut a future Senate bid by Brown in order to assist his 
political ally, Rep. Barbara Boxer of Greenbrae. Boxer has announced she will 
run for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Burton, in an interview, dismissed with an expletive the suggestion that his 
attack was politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
The intraparty tussle is expected to be renewed this weekend at a meeting of 
the state party's executive committee in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
Burton said he personally believes that Brown, whose term runs until 1993, 
should be ousted as the party chairman. However, party rules establish a 
complicated process for dismissing officers, making summary action this weekend 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Brown also maintains some strong ties with party regulars, many of whom insist 
that it is overly simplistic to blame him for Feinstein's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein herself made several strategic errors during the course of the 
campaign, fellow Democrats point out, including a decision not to air 
television ads critical of Wilson's absence from the Senate until after Wilson 
had defused the issue by returning to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The surge of concern over the Persian Gulf stalemate and fears about a 
recession played against Feinstein's positioning of herself as a "candidate of 
change." And some voters were influenced against Feinstein because she is a 
woman, polls showed. 
</P>
<P>
Fund-raisers who could have financed a stronger get-out-the-vote effort were 
pulled in several different directions. In June, Democrats were working to 
defeat initiatives that would have reformed the reapportionment process. In 
November, many were allied against the term-limit initiatives, one of which 
succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
Brown has pointed out that his San Francisco law firm spent $300,000 to help 
overturn Proposition 73, the campaign financing measure that was struck down by 
a state court in September, allowing Feinstein to collect millions in extra 
campaign dollars and bringing her closer to Wilson in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the party's organized groups, including the Los Angeles County 
Democratic organization, have rushed to Brown's defense. 
</P>
<P>
"We all share responsibility for the loss of the governor's race," said David 
Brooks, chairman of the Butte County Central Committee, in a letter to the 
party executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
Problems with the party's get-out-the-vote organization began in February with 
the dismissal of voter organizer Marshall Ganz over what Brown says was a 
financial dispute and Ganz says was a failure by Brown to commit to a massive 
plan to target 750,000 voters. 
</P>
<P>
Ganz was not replaced until mid-September, when fellow organizer Larry 
Tramutola was brought in to head what turned out to be a much-diminished 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ganz said Brown bears "a major responsibility" for November's results 
because Brown scuttled the initial program, he and other Democrats said elected 
officials and Feinstein herself deserve some of the blame for the low-powered 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the statewide candidates were nominated in June, they certainly had 
responsibility, too," Ganz said. "Why the Feinstein people didn't raise holy 
hell . . . is a mystery to me." 
</P>
<P>
Ganz said he proposed a get-out-the-vote effort to Feinstein's campaign staff, 
but the suggestion "disappeared into the mist." 
</P>
<P>
Several Democrats said this week that they were concerned that public dissent 
over the election results would disintegrate into Brown-bashing and enhance the 
perception of Democrats as a less-than-organized lot. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wish what was being debated was why did the party drop the ball on 
registration and get-out-the-vote and why didn't Feinstein pick up the ball," 
Ganz said. "Instead it's a little like low farce."

JUDICIAL COUNCIL ACTS TO CURB SEX BIAS; 
</P>
<P>
LEGAL SYSTEM: MANY OF THE STEPS TAKEN BY THE STATE PANEL ARE AIMED AT HELPING 
VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. ACTION FOLLOWS FINDING OF WIDESPREAD BIAS AGAINST 
WOMEN IN COURTS.

<P>
The state Judicial Council, acting in the wake of a landmark bias study, on 
Friday approved new court rules and urged a broad range of other steps to curb 
sex discrimination in the California legal system. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-member council, the policy-making arm of the state judiciary, 
unanimously adopted 67 recommendations by a special council committee that in a 
three-year inquiry found widespread bias against women in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the steps the council approved were aimed at helping victims of 
domestic violence. The group voted to provide around-the-clock availability of 
emergency restraining orders to prevent recurring violence; decided to advise 
prosecutors and police to treat domestic violence as seriously as crime 
involving strangers, and asked that judges receive special training on the 
nature of domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the most important areas we have dealt with," said Los Angeles 
Superior Court Judge David M. Rothman, co-chair of the special committee. "This 
marks a profound change in the way the judiciary looks at and deals with that 
subject." 
</P>
<P>
The council, acting on a wide range of issues, also urged a new ethics code 
barring judges from membership in discriminatory clubs; adopted a new rule 
requiring gender-neutral language in local court forms and documents; and asked 
corrections officials to provide women inmates with less-cumbersome jail 
shackles that are "suitable to the female form." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the recommendations will be implemented in the form of new court rules 
by the council, which is made up of judges, lawyers and legislators and chaired 
by Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
But other steps will require action by the State Bar, the California Judges 
Assn., law school deans and the state Legislature. Council members expressed 
hope such action will come soon. "We don't want this to be merely a report that 
gathers dust on the shelf," said Appellate Justice Ronald M. George of Los 
Angeles, leader of a council group that reviewed the committee's 680-page 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Other officials noted that since release of the report last March, they had 
sensed a new sensitivity to sex discrimination in the legal system. William E. 
Davis, administrative director of the courts, said some judges have begun 
punishing lawyers who exhibit bias in the courtroom. "The attitudes have 
already changed within the judiciary," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
The council's investigation was one of the first of its kind in the nation and 
the most extensive in the state. At least 28 other states have launched similar 
inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
The report cited instances of "openly hostile" behavior and demeaning remarks 
by judges against female lawyers, litigants and witnesses. It also found 
shortcomings in family law -- such as inadequate child support -- and in 
jailhouse facilities for women. 
</P>
<P>
Since March, the council has received dozens of letters, most of them 
supporting its findings and recommendations. But there were assorted 
criticisms, as well. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Municipal Judge R. Bruce Minto noted that the massive report failed 
to consider sex bias against men in child-custody and support cases. The 
California National Organization for Women said that the judiciary should 
attain a gender balance reflecting the 52% female portion of the population. 
Mary C. Dunlap, a San Francisco gay-activist attorney, faulted the committee 
for failing to address "the treachery and damage of homophobia and of 
anti-lesbian attitudes" in the legal system. 
</P>
<P>
Among other actions Friday the council voted to: 
</P>
<P>
Authorize judges to read statements in court expressing their refusal to 
tolerate any bias in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Create pilot projects in three counties to develop grievance procedures for 
complaints of sex, racial or religious bias in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Urge the Legislature to extend child-support obligations to age 21. 
</P>
<P>
Establish comprehensive policies providing for pregnancy and parental leave for 
judges.

SMITH PLANNING TO CHALLENGE ABSENTEE BALLOTS STATEWIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN and BOB SCHWARTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democratic state attorney general candidate Arlo Smith on Friday dropped his 
court battle to halt the count of more than 50,000 absentee ballots in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith, who trails Republican Dan Lungren by just under 10,000 votes out of 
more than 7 million cast statewide, said he is still determined to pursue a 
legal challenge of more than 500,000 absentee ballots from last week's 
election. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of litigating it twice, we're going to litigate it once," said Smith's 
campaign manager, Marc Dann. 
</P>
<P>
The Smith campaign has charged that the Republican Party may have improperly 
submitted applications for absentee ballots on behalf of voters. To remedy the 
situation, Smith's attorneys will ask at a hearing scheduled for Nov. 30 that 
most absentee ballots be invalidated, an action that would apparently turn the 
election in favor of Smith. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, an Orange County Superior Court judge, acting at Smith's request, 
lifted a temporary restraining order that prevented Orange County Registrar of 
Voters Donald Tanney from counting absentee ballots unless his office 
specifically checked for fraud in the applications for absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, Tanney said he would begin processing the ballots 
immediately without the anti-fraud safeguards sought by Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The count, which is expected to add to Lungren's lead, is likely to be 
concluded on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's attorney, Allan H. Stokke, told reporters that Tanney's actions are 
"clearly contrary to the Election Code." But rather than fight Orange County 
specifically, Stokke said, a more expansive lawsuit against Secretary of State 
March Fong Eu's office would be more productive. 
</P>
<P>
Stokke said the Smith suit would rely on a court affidavit filed this week by 
Eu's elections division chief which acknowledges that her office advises county 
registrars across California not to bother comparing the signatures on absentee 
applications with those on returned ballots or on voters' original affidavits 
of registration. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, the district attorney of San Francisco, had led Lungren, a former 
five-term congressman, by almost 29,000 votes when the statewide absentee 
ballot count began. But Lungren steadily closed the gap, passing Smith on 
Wednesday and declaring victory on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Smith has refused to concede and is considering an unprecedented statewide 
recount if the margin remains close.

RARE ELEMENT CALLED 'RAIN' MAY SHOW UP IN SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A rare phenomenon of nature that Webster's defines as "water falling to earth 
in drops" and meteorologists call "rain" could come to the Los Angeles area 
this weekend, weather forecasters said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Guarded in their predictions, forecasters agreed that an intense rain is 
unlikely. Even a spritz, they say, would be unusual by recent standards. 
</P>
<P>
Since July 1, only .02 of an inch of precipitation has been measured at the Los 
Angeles Civic Center, compared to a historic norm of 1.42 inches over that 
period. The last significant rain occurred on Memorial Day, when a freak storm 
dropped 1.17 inches on the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
As for the prospects of such a downpour this weekend, or even a steady shower, 
"it doesn't look very likely," said Steve Burback, a forecaster for WeatherData 
Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
A storm system expected to arrive Sunday night "doesn't really have any punch," 
he added. Burback predicted "just small amounts here and there, maybe more in 
the mountains," on Sunday and Monday nights. 
</P>
<P>
The paucity of precipitation continues to worsen California's drought, now in 
its fourth year. 
</P>
<P>
If it were to rain, the immediate benefit would be to reduce demand for water 
to irrigate lawns and gardens, said Bob Gomperz of the Metropolitan Water 
District. Rain would help replenish Southern California's depleted ground water 
supplies, which provide about one-third of the region's water. The rest comes 
via aqueduct from Northern California and the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
Water officials are hopeful that winter storms eventually will break the 
drought. The two primary storage reservoirs in the State Water Project -- Lake 
Oroville, north of Sacramento, and the San Luis Reservoir, west of Fresno, -- 
now contain 1.09 million acre-feet of water, compared to 3.6 million acre-feet 
a year ago. "And we thought last year was dry," Gomperz said. "This year, it's 
parched." 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, rain has not always been so scarce. The average annual 
rainfall at the Civic Center is about 14.9 inches; as recently as 1986, 18 
inches fell. Since then, however, every year has been below normal, bottoming 
out at 4.56 inches in 1989. So far in 1990, 7.37 inches have been measured. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 mark was the lowest since 1953 -- lower even than the 6.54 inches 
recorded in 1972.

The biggest embarrassment in the Milli Vanilli affair is that the lip-syncing 
duo was awarded a Grammy in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
In picking Milli Vanilli as the best new artists of 1989, the National Academy 
of Recording Arts and Sciences voters were simply seduced by record sales. 
</P>
<P>
The Grammys are designed to salute excellence in the recording industry -- and 
it's hard to imagine anyone with even the slightest musical sophistication 
being impressed by the lightweight, teen-oriented dance-pop on the Milli 
Vanilli album "Girl You Know It's True." 
</P>
<P>
Milli Vanilli was never about artistry -- as indicated by Rob Pilatus' 
admission Thursday that neither he nor partner Fab Morvan sang a note on the 
album. 
</P>
<P>
Milli Vanilli was an exercise in marketing in the video age -- and it was 
spectacularly successful. 
</P>
<P>
Does anyone think the voters would have selected Milli Vanilli as the best new 
act of the year if "its" album had sold 70,000 copies instead of 7 million? 
</P>
<P>
So, it's doubly embarrassing now that the academy, which sponsors the Grammy 
competition, is being so timid in taking the first step toward correcting the 
error. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of sending an immediate telegram to Pilatus and Morvan demanding the 
return of the Grammy statutes, the academy c-r-a-w-l-e-d into action Thursday 
by announcing that it would conduct a review of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
A review? 
</P>
<P>
What is there to review? 
</P>
<P>
The academy's rules require that the singers whose names appear on the album 
have to actually sing on the album to be eligible for a Grammy, and here we 
have Pilatus telling us he didn't sing on the record. We also have Frank 
Farian, the German producer of the Milli Vanilli album, confirming it. 
</P>
<P>
So what's the problem? 
</P>
<P>
What's the academy going to do when it finally decides that Milli Vanilli has 
to return the Grammys: Ask them "pretty please"? 
</P>
<P>
The larger problem is that the Milli Vanilli award isn't an isolated blunder. 
The Grammy track record over the last 20 years in saluting new artists isn't 
very encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
What names come quickly to mind when you think of the most acclaimed pop 
artists of the last two decades? Prince, Bruce Springsteen, U2, Elton John, 
Sinead O'Connor, David Bowie? 
</P>
<P>
None won a Grammy for best new artist. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the academy voters have honored the likes of America, the Starland 
Vocal Band, Christopher Cross, A Taste of Honey and Debby Boone. 
</P>
<P>
The outlook isn't good. If Grammy voters have had trouble separating artistry 
and commerce before, the problems are going to be compounded in an age where a 
large segment of the young pop audience is more interested in a good video than 
in a good record. 
</P>
<P>
Truth be known, many fans would prefer having a couple of pretty faces and hot 
dancers -- like Pilatus and Morvan -- in a video or in a concert, even if 
they're lip-syncing, than two average-looking singers who can't dance a lick. 
</P>
<P>
Those same fans are so enamored of videos that the important thing in concert 
isn't hearing someone sing live, but being caught up in a re-creation of the 
energy and excitement of the video. 
</P>
<P>
The Milli Vanilli situation is just an extreme example of a shell game that has 
been part of the pop experience. Studio musicians -- often uncredited -- have 
frequently sat in for band members over the years during recording session. 
Concurrently, engineers have employed technology to disguise the weaknesses of 
countless of singers. 
</P>
<P>
That's why live shows were always considered a sort of moment of truth. Singers 
had to prove live that they could handle the song without the various vocal 
enhancement devices employed in the studio. 
</P>
<P>
But that's no longer true. 
</P>
<P>
Technology has become so sophisticated and audiences apparently so undemanding 
that sound engineers can work just as many wonders in a concert hall as they 
can in the studio. Prerecorded tapes to beef-up a band's instrumental sound are 
commonplace, and acts as prominent as Madonna, Janet Jackson and the New Kids 
on the Block have been the subject of "is it live or is it Memorex?" 
speculation concerning their concert vocals -- none of which has hurt ticket 
sales, it should be noted. 
</P>
<P>
This is an outrage to most pop purists, who argue that part of the excitement 
of a concert is in an artist expressing the emotion of the moment -- an extra 
enthusiasm or an unexpected gentleness that wasn't offered on the recorded 
version of the same song. 
</P>
<P>
If a new generation of fans prefer a recreation of the videos, so be it. Is it 
really any different than the scores of hollow, recycled pop-rock acts that go 
out on stage night after night and play the same music in such a passionless 
fashion that the whole thing might as well be prerecorded? 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, all Frank Farian, who masterminded the Milli Vanilli album and 
campaign, did was recognize this new reality in pop and act accordingly. He was 
probably as surprised as anyone else when his creation was honored by the 
academy. 
</P>
<P>
What's ahead? 
</P>
<P>
With the conflicting standards among pop fans these days, it is important that 
Grammy voters carefully focus on the traditional values of singing, songwriting 
and musicianship -- which is what they should have been doing all along. 
Otherwise there is no difference between the Grammy awards and the American 
Music Awards, which make no bones about merely honoring popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Warning stickers are big these days in the record industry. So, maybe the 
academy should take advantage of this week's revelations and place a sticker on 
the ballots it sends to Grammy voters in January: Listen to the music, not to 
the cash register.

MILLI 'SINGER' SAYS ARISTA KNEW ABOUT ALBUM HOAX; 
</P>
<P>
POP MUSIC: MILLI VANILLI PERFORMER AND FORMER MANAGER CLAIM THE RECORD COMPANY 
WAS AWARE BEFORE THE GRAMMYS THAT DUO DIDN'T SING ON RECORD.

Officials of Arista Records knew that pop duo Milli Vanilli's Rob Pilatus and 
Fab Morvan did not sing on their 7 million-selling "Girl You Know It's True" 
album before the duo won the 1989 Grammy Award for best new artist of the year, 
a group member and a former manager said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations contradict claims made by a spokesman for the record company 
earlier, after record producer Frank Farian and Pilatus admitted the performers 
did not sing on the album. 
</P>
<P>
If Arista officials were aware that Pilatus and Morvan didn't sing, then the 
company may have purposely misrepresented the album in its marketing and 
advertising to the public, as well as to the National Academy of Recording Arts 
and Sciences, the recording industry organization that awards the Grammys. The 
allegations made Friday also raise questions about the role of Arista President 
Clive Davis and leading Hollywood talent manager Sandy Gallin in what has 
become the first major challenge to the integrity of the Grammy awards 
selection process. 
</P>
<P>
Because Pilatus and Morvan are wrongly listed on the album credits as its 
vocalists, the pair could lose their Grammy award, a first in the 33-year 
history of the recording industry award. They won their award during a 
nationally televised program from the Shrine Auditorium in February. 
</P>
<P>
"We told Clive Davis. We told Sandy Gallin. We told everybody six months before 
the Grammy awards," Pilatus told The Times on Friday. Pilatus and Morvan plan 
to release written material that Pilatus says substantiates the claim at a news 
conference next week. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody who worked closely with Rob and Fab at Arista knew what was going 
on," said Todd Headlee, who represented Milli Vanilli from August, 1989, to 
August, 1990. "That's why they always tried so desperately to insulate the guys 
from the press. Sandy Gallin and Clive Davis did not even want Rob and Fab to 
appear on the Grammy broadcast." 
</P>
<P>
Headlee, who handled the Milli Vanilli account for the management firm Gallin 
Morey Associates claims Pilatus and Morvan were pawns in an elaborate corporate 
marketing scheme, approved by top officials at Arista, a New York-based label 
owned by the European conglomerate Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG). 
</P>
<P>
Farian, the German studio whiz who produced the album and is the owner of the 
Milli Vanilli moniker, denied Wednesday that top officials at the labels had 
any knowledge of the lip-syncing. Farian said he recorded the album in Munich, 
and it was released by Arista in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Arista president Davis did not return numerous phone calls Thursday and Friday. 
Roy Lott, executive vice president of Arista, denied the charges in a phone 
interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way that anyone ever could have known whether they sang or not," 
Lott said. "We are merely a distributor of their records. Rob and Fab and Frank 
assured us that they sang on the record." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to contact Gallin were unsuccessful on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it very irresponsible that the record companies continue to deny 
knowing about all this," Headlee said. "As hard as Rob and Fab worked to meet 
their obligations to these corporations which were raking in millions off the 
concept. For them to leave them out to dry when the truth hits the fan is 
reprehensible." 
</P>
<P>
Pilatus and Morvan released a statement Thursday backing up Headlee's claims. 
</P>
<P>
"We have strongly expressed to Frank Farian and to our record labels, Arista 
Records and BMG Records, our reluctance to participate in any kind of 
misrepresentation," Pilatus and Morvan said. "Through a variety of coercive 
maneuvers, our wishes to creatively participate in our recordings have been 
denied." 
</P>
<P>
Headlee claims that the duo was manipulated into participating in the lip-sync 
plan because they were promised the opportunity to sing on tour and upcoming 
projects, a promise that he said Farian didn't follow through on. 
</P>
<P>
Headlee, who is writing a book about his year with Milli Vanilli, said record 
company officials and other associates of the duo were concerned about their 
appearance on the Grammy show, where they lip-synced to a recording of one of 
their songs. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone at Arista who worked closely with the group was walking on eggshells 
before the Grammy lip-sync performance last February," Headlee said. "When they 
walked off the stage clutching the trophy, I remember thinking to myself that 
they may not have deserved the Grammy for their performance, but they sure as 
hell did deserve an Oscar."

N.Y. ART AUCTION SCENE: A STILL-LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
ART: ASIDE FROM THE GRETA GARBO COLLECTION, THERE WASN'T MUCH ACTION IN THE 
SALE OF CONTEMPORARY, MODERN AND IMPRESSIONIST ARTWORKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When Sotheby's auctioneer John Marion struck his gavel for the 77th and last 
time on the evening of Nov. 6, the art market appeared to be in big trouble. 
The consummate salesman had opened a two-week round of New York auctions with a 
disastrous sale of contemporary art. If this was a bellwether of the fall 
season, the weather promised to be rotten. 
</P>
<P>
Only 34 of the 77 items offered attracted buyers in this initial auction of 
contemporary art. Sales totaled a mere $19.8 million -- exactly half the low 
estimate of $39.6 million that had been forecast by the auction house. To make 
matters worse, the paltry total for the 34 pieces that did sell was less than 
the price of Willem de Kooning's Abstract Expressionist painting, 
"Interchange," which brought $20.68 million in a $98.3-million sale held only a 
year ago in the very same salesroom. 
</P>
<P>
Could the situation get worse? Yes, but it didn't. Big-ticket auctions on 
subsequent days simply leveled off a precipitous downturn that began last 
spring and plunged further during the summer and early fall. When November's 
marathon of contemporary, modern and Impressionist art sales ended on Thursday 
-- with an auction of Greta Garbo's collection -- the art market hadn't crashed 
but it had been severely chastened. 
</P>
<P>
"Sanity has returned to the market," said Los Angeles collector Eli Broad, who 
attended the contemporary sales in New York but didn't buy anything. "Real 
collectors who want to buy art and keep it are still involved, but the 
so-called speculative collectors have disappeared." 
</P>
<P>
Collectors and dealers agree that the weakness of the dollar and America's 
recessionary mood were important factors in the art market's downturn. As in 
real estate, the stock market, oil or just about anything else, art prices can 
follow cyclical patterns, say art market players, and prices that went up too 
fast in the 1980s had to come down. 
</P>
<P>
Christie's star item, Vincent van Gogh's "Vase With Cornflowers and Poppies," 
was valued at $12 million to $16 million, but bidding stopped at $9.5 million 
and the colorful still life went back to the seller. 
</P>
<P>
Was it all over for Van Gogh, whose prices have gone as high the $82.5 million 
paid in May for "Portrait of Dr. Gachet"? Well, no. A few minutes after "Vase 
With Cornflowers and Poppies" was whisked off stage, a Van Gogh drawing, 
"Garden of Flowers," commanded $8.4 million and broke the six-year-old auction 
record for a drawing. The former record-holder, a chalk depiction of a man's 
head and hand by Raphael, was sold for $4.8 million in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Garbo's name apparently was all that was needed to sell every artwork, 
candlestick, ceramic clown and enamel snuff box that the film star owned. 
Sotheby's on Tuesday sold $16 million worth of works from her estate, which had 
been valued at $14.5 million to $20 million. The most expensive piece was 
Renoir's 1889 portrait of his nephew Edmond, which brought $7 million. An 
additional $4.7 million worth of artworks and decorative items was sold on 
Wednesday and Thursday. People who wanted a piece of Garbo turned out in droves 
on Thursday to bid on relatively low-priced furnishings and collectibles. The 
auction brought a total of $2.5 million -- more than twice the high estimate of 
$994,050. 
</P>
<P>
Famous names aside, even the most optimistic spin doctors couldn't deny certain 
troubling facts about the November sales: 
</P>
<P>
* Despite last minute efforts to lower reserve prices -- the lowest a seller 
will accept -- about half the works in the two most important contemporary art 
sales went begging. 
</P>
<P>
* The top item in Sotheby's contemporary art sale was Robert Rauschenberg's 
"Third Time Painting," which was sold for $3 million -- but only after the 
original estimate was reduced to the range of $3 million to $4 million. The 
mixed-media "combine" painting was originally valued at $4 million to $5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
* Impressionist and modern works fared slightly better than contemporary art, 
probably because the market is more international and less subject to American 
jitters about a recession, but roughly one third of the works in the prime 
Impressionist and modern art sales failed to find buyers. 
</P>
<P>
* A controversial practice of guaranteeing sales was called into question by a 
disappointing sale on Monday of 36 high quality works from the estate of Henry 
Ford II. Sotheby's won the right to sell the Ford pictures by guaranteeing an 
undisclosed sum to the family. But when 13 pieces didn't sell, Sotheby's was 
left holding a bag of artworks valued at a total of $23.4 million to $30.8 
million. The 23 works that did sell brought a total of $48.6 million -- far 
below the $66 million to $88 million that Sotheby's had expected to get for the 
36 pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Some sources have speculated that the guarantee was between $50 million to $58 
million and that the auction house owes the Ford family $20 million or more. In 
a statement to the press, Sotheby's acknowledged a loss but pegged it at less 
than $5 million. The final figure will depend upon Sotheby's success at selling 
the pictures privately. 
</P>
<P>
November auction news was not all bad, however. In light of Sotheby's dismal 
opener, Christie's contemporary art sale on Nov. 7 was relatively successful. 
Only 30 of the 58 contemporary artworks offered were sold, but Christie's toted 
up $36.7 million in sales, just $5 million under the low estimate of $41.7 
million. Eight works brought more than $1 million apiece. Top among them was De 
Kooning's 1956 painting, "July," which was valued at up to $7 million but sold 
for $8.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Christie's also set five contemporary art records: Philip Guston ($1 million 
for "Summer," a 1954 abstract painting), Agnes Martin ($495,000 for "The 
Peach," a white canvas divided with pencil lines, from 1964), Sigmar Polke 
($374,000 for a 1964 painting, "Tennis Player"), Eva Hess ($297,000 for "Tori," 
a group of fiberglass sculptures constructed in 1969) and Jannis Kounellis 
($242,000 for an untitled quartet of mixed-media panels made in 1986). 
</P>
<P>
This week the spotlight shifted to Impressionist and modern art, and the sales 
produced mixed results. Once again, total sales figures fell below the auction 
houses' most restrained estimates, but a number of high-quality pieces sold 
within estimated prices and a few works even set records. 
</P>
<P>
The top item in the Ford sale, Pierre-Auguste Renoir's "The Cup of Chocolate," 
brought $18.2 million, just above the high estimate of $18 million. On Tuesday 
night, Sotheby's sold 52 of 69 Impressionist and modern artworks for a total of 
$84.4 million. The pre-sale estimate was $91 million to $124.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
The high-rolling Impressionist and modern art crowd moved to Christie's on 
Wednesday, when the Park Avenue auction house rang up a total of $92.3 million 
for 32 of 47 items offered. The sale had been estimated to bring between $129.4 
million and $158.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The days of wildly escalating prices are long gone, but collectors, curators 
and auction house officials assess the situation variously. 
</P>
<P>
David Nash, who directed Sotheby's Impressionist and modern art sales, 
attributed disappointing results in part to "the uncertainty of the worldwide 
political and economic situation." 
</P>
<P>
"After an orgy that escalated art prices far beyond the rate of inflation, you 
have a major adjustment," said collector Broad. "Twenty years ago when you 
bought a work of art and tried to sell it the next year, you knew you would 
lose money. But lately some people think they can do no wrong. They can buy in 
a studio or gallery and turn around and sell at auction." 
</P>
<P>
While the salesrooms were packed as usual, some long-time dealers and 
collectors had given up on buying at auction. Peter Goulds, owner of L.A. 
Louver Gallery in Venice, for one, stayed home this year. The clients he 
generally represents had been turned off by the machinations of a spiraling 
market. Trying to build collections at "irresponsibly handled" auctions "had 
become an exercise in futility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers wonder if the market will plunge further before it bottoms out, 
but Broad predicts a turn-around in the spring when the next big round of sales 
is scheduled. "In the May sales we'll see lower estimates and because the 
prices are lower a higher percentage of lots will sell," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have bought hardly anything at auction for several years. All the excesses 
come to light in auctions in a rising market. You pay more for a work of art at 
auction than you would in a gallery. In a declining market the opposite is 
true. There will be good values for real collectors. I expect to buy more at 
auction in coming years," Broad said.

RICK DU BROW: CHUNG HAS NO NEWS TO REPORT -- AND NO REGRETS; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THE TV JOURNALIST STILL ISN'T PREGNANT -- BUT SHE'S HAPPY DOING 
JUST THE OCCASIONAL CBS SPECIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's nearly four months since Connie Chung gave up her weekly CBS series to 
concentrate on trying to have a child. 
</P>
<P>
For someone who has long had a fierce ambition to achieve topmost network 
stardom, it was a dramatic personal decision for the 44-year-old anchor. She 
was on the verge of having it all. 
</P>
<P>
In a phone interview from New York, Chung, who is married to fellow TV 
journalist Maury Povich, clearly had no regrets, although she said she was not 
yet pregnant: "The answer is no. I have no news to report yet." 
</P>
<P>
Wanting a child is no joke. But Chung has grown used to the gags that 
inevitably followed her frank declaration that "I now need to take a very 
aggressive approach to having a baby." 
</P>
<P>
"There have been a lot of jokes -- on Carson, Letterman, Arsenio," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And is she offended? 
</P>
<P>
"No. Of course not. The jokes are very funny." 
</P>
<P>
Chung's withdrawal from her weekly series -- which was to follow such major 
Monday hits as "Murphy Brown" and "Designing Women," both now Top 10 shows -- 
cost her one of TV's best time slots and perhaps great ratings success. 
</P>
<P>
The slot was taken over by CBS' new drama series "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill," 
which has done well with Sharon Gless as a public defender. 
</P>
<P>
Chung's planned series now turns up only occasionally as specials, with the 
next one -- her first since Sept. 10 -- scheduled for Thursday, Thanksgiving 
Day, with Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward and Kevin Costner as interview guests. 
</P>
<P>
Thanksgiving is widely regarded in the TV industry as a poor viewing night 
because of family holiday dinners and get-together celebrations. But Chung 
scoffs at the notion that CBS has downgraded her special by airing it on that 
night, when such series as "The Cosby Show," "A Different World," "The Flash" 
and "L.A. Law" are running repeat episodes. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, good heavens, no," she said. "Thanksgiving is a great night. Everybody's 
home with their families. They have their turkey. Then they settle down to 
watch a program. It's perfect. They're not out doing something else." 
</P>
<P>
The next "Face to Face with Connie Chung" special will be broadcast in the 
less-significant TV month of December, well after the key November ratings 
sweeps are over. 
</P>
<P>
Chung, as indefatigable and focused as ever, is determined that her personal 
life and professional career will turn out a double triumph despite the changes 
she instigated -- among them, cutting down on travel after consulting with 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still working six days a week," she said. "I still continue to put stories 
together. I'm still doing the Sunday CBS news. I did election night. And I've 
been subbing for Dan Rather. But I haven't been on the road as much. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, I was pretty much on the road from either Sunday night or Monday 
until Wednesday or Thursday. And then I'd come down and we'd tape the show on 
Friday. And I'd have Saturday off, sometimes. And then I'd do the Sunday news." 
</P>
<P>
Considering her personal goals, why is she driving herself so much? 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for me to change 20 years of behavior. And I've always worked on 
overdrive. That's probably why I'm still working six days a week, because I 
don't know how to work any other way. The way I work is at a fast pace. It's 
the way I am. I cannot change my behavior. But last year (because of the 
travel), I was working like a maniac." 
</P>
<P>
If she has her hoped-for baby, would she stop working? 
</P>
<P>
"No. Absolutely not." 
</P>
<P>
When Chung decided in July "to lighten my workload" in trying to have a child, 
she thrust herself into the spotlight as a highly visible example of someone 
attempting to reconcile the matters of career and family. Has she thought about 
that? 
</P>
<P>
"Sure. I mean, for me it was a very personal decision. But I realized the 
impact that it could have. In terms of the letters that I've gotten, and the 
phone calls, people have been very supportive. Many women who were older have 
told me that it gave them pause to think." 
</P>
<P>
About whether to wait that long to have a baby? 
</P>
<P>
"Exactly." 
</P>
<P>
And that, she said, is what she meant when she spoke about taking "a very 
aggressive approach to having a baby." 
</P>
<P>
"See, at my age, 44, that's what I have to do," said Chung. 
</P>
<P>
When Chung, because of her status at CBS, was able to have her working 
conditions modified in her attempt to have a child, it was suggested in some 
quarters that women of lesser clout at the network now might have legal footing 
to demand the same consideration. Couldn't her case open the doors for such 
demands? 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose so," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Could she see the case opening doors for men, too, in special situations? 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't thought about that. If it's a medical situation, I suppose so," she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Even from her days as a Los Angeles anchor, Chung has been extraordinarily 
cautious, private and tight-mouthed in public statements in her pursuit of TV's 
top rung. So going public with her intimate plans must have been painful. Did 
she think it was necessary to go into such detail -- including the blunt 
phrasing that some praised but others considered ill-advised? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it was a really hard decision," she said. "I decided that honesty was 
the best way to go. Maury and I talked it over extensively. What should we do? 
What should I say? 
</P>
<P>
"Surely I would have preferred to keep my private life private. Absolutely. But 
this is what I had to do. I had no choice. I really didn't."

CHURCH TO MEET IN PHOENIX DESPITE KING DAY DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Episcopal Church will hold its 1991 General Convention in Phoenix despite 
the defeat on Election Day of a referendum designating Martin Luther King Day 
as a state holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Presiding Bishop Edmond Browning, who traveled to Phoenix last spring to lobby 
for the holiday, expressed disappointment at the measure's narrow defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Some Episcopal church leaders urged a move after the Nov. 6 vote. 
</P>
<P>
But Browning said this week that a meeting in Phoenix could serve as an 
occasion for Episcopalians to demonstrate their faith. "The fight has been a 
bruising one and they need our support," said Browning, referring to "people of 
good faith in Arizona who are working and fighting to overcome prejudice." 
</P>
<P>
The triennial convention of the Episcopal Church, which draws about 10,000 
delegates and visitors, will be held July 11-20. 
</P>
<P>
A smaller denomination, the homosexual-oriented Universal Fellowship of 
Metropolitan Community Churches, is having attorneys look into whether it can 
get out of a hotel contract in Phoenix for its convention July 14-21. Nearly 
3,000 delegates and visitors are expected to attend its biennial meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I imagine we will have to honor our contract," said Troy Perry, 
founder-moderator of the Hollywood-based denomination. "But I know we will 
cancel the option we had with the hotel to meet in Phoenix two years later." 
</P>
<P>
Perry said the Metropolitan Community Churches selected Phoenix as a national 
convention site without being aware that the Episcopal Church, which faces a 
convention debate on homosexuality issues, will be in the city at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"That was probably the move of the Holy Spirit," Perry said.

GATES OFF HOOK IN SUIT; COUNTY TO PAY $616,000; 
</P>
<P>
JUDGMENT: RITTER BROTHERS DROP ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN PUNITIVE DAMAGES FROM SHERIFF 
IN GUN-PERMIT CASE. 
</P>

<P>
Two private investigators, who alleged that Sheriff Brad Gates unfairly denied 
them concealed weapons permits, will receive $616,000 in a court judgment 
approved Friday that will end more than a decade of controversy over the way 
Gates issues gun permits. 
</P>
<P>
The judgment, to be paid by the county, came after weeks of negotiation between 
the sheriff and Frank and Ty Ritter, two brothers who in September won a 
$246,000 jury verdict and the right to pursue additional punitive damages from 
the sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
With the agreement, Gates will not have to face the possibility of being held 
personally accountable for violating the Ritters' constitutional rights. Had 
the case gone forward, he would have had to divulge details of his wealth at a 
court hearing set to begin Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy. It's been 12 years and a long fight," said Frank Ritter of 
Huntington Beach, who was denied a gun permit six times. "Obviously, I am 
pleased from the money side, but, in the broader sense, someone has to look 
over the sheriff's shoulder because he can't be trusted to look over his own 
shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
Although the jury decided that the sheriff intentionally discriminated against 
the Ritters, Gates maintained again Friday that he and his deputies have tried 
to treat everyone fairly when they apply for a concealed weapons permit. 
</P>
<P>
"We are relieved to have this case behind us," the sheriff said. "I have not 
been afraid of the process at any point of the game. I think the plaintiffs 
probably made a decision to settle rather than take a chance on a long, 
drawn-out battle on punitive damages. After 11 or 12 years, that is enough." 
</P>
<P>
The stipulated judgment was approved late Friday afternoon by attorneys for 
both sides and U.S. District Court Judge William P. Gray, who presided over the 
case. It allows the jury's September verdict against Gates to stand. 
</P>
<P>
Meir J. Westreich, the Ritters' lawyer, said his clients will receive $400,000 
of the total award while the remaining $216,000 will be used for legal fees and 
a few remaining court costs. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the judgment, the Ritters agreed to drop their attempt to obtain 
upward of $500,000 in punitive damages from Gates personally. Frank Ritter also 
abandoned his request for a gun permit to be granted to him retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Sheriff's Department was ordered to make sure that a new gun 
permit policy that Gates intends to issue treats all applicants equally and in 
compliance with the U.S. Constitution and state law. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a conclusion that makes it very clear that Sheriff Brad Gates is not 
abiding by the law, plain and simple," Westreich said. "The fact remains there 
is a final judgment that shows Brad Gates violated his oath of office by 
applying a policy that violated the Constitution of the United States. That 
judgment stands." 
</P>
<P>
The Ritters, both of Orange County, were denied a permit to carry a concealed 
weapon six times in the late 1970s and early 1980s. They alleged in their 
lawsuit that Gates discriminated against them as private investigators and 
oversaw a process that improperly issued many gun permits to political backers, 
wealthy business people and friends of the sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
During three weeks of trial, the defense contended that the sheriff tried to 
treat every applicant fairly and that there was no indication that political 
influence or lack of it had anything to do with the fact that the Ritters did 
not get permits. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 28, the jury found that the Ritters' failure to support the sheriff 
politically was not a motivating factor in the denial of their gun permits. 
Jurors decided that Gates intentionally discriminated against the brothers 
because they were private investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, jurors found that Gates acted with malice or reckless disregard for 
the Ritters' constitutional rights, which subjected the sheriff to the 
possibility of additional punitive damages to be determined by the same jury at 
a later hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly understand the jury's feelings," Gates said, "but I believe my 
people and my department were trying to do the right thing. I think that this 
is underscored by the fact that the judge did not want the plaintiffs to take 
part in the review of the gun-permit process. Without talking to him, I think 
it is an indication that he trusts us to do the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
Westreich disagreed. "It is outrageous that someone who is agreeing to pay 
$616,000 and agreeing to an order to obey his own oath of office can turn this 
upside down and say, 'The judge trusts me,' " he said. "Can the public afford 
the trust this judge has in the sheriff? It has cost them $616,000." 
</P>
<P>
Gates noted that his department has issued 448 gun permits to private security 
personnel and private investigators since 1978. He reiterated that his efforts 
since becoming sheriff in 1975 have reduced the number of gun permits from 
about 3,000 to 250. 
</P>
<P>
Gates also said the California State Sheriff's Assn. will be introducing 
legislation to have the state assume the responsibility for issuing concealed 
weapons permits to private investigators and security personnel to avoid future 
problems for local law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Had the case gone into the punitive-damage phase, Westreich was prepared to 
argue that Gates deliberately ignored the U.S. Constitution and a 1978 Orange 
County Superior Court decision that said he discriminated against private 
investigators who applied for gun permits. 
</P>
<P>
Westreich also said he would have contended that Gates showed disregard for the 
jury's $246,000 award by making statements to the media minimizing his 
responsibility in violating the Ritters' constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
Eric L. Dobberteen, Gates' lawyer, has contended that punitive damages were not 
deserved because Gates was acting in his official capacity as sheriff and did 
not consider the Ritters' gun permit applications himself. 
</P>
<P>
Dobberteen was prepared to argue that the sheriff never benefited personally 
nor tried to benefit personally from the Ritters' applications, such as asking 
for political support or campaign contributions in exchange for gun permits.

NATION SHOWS A GROWING CONCERN ABOUT THE DRAFT; 
</P>
<P>
MOBILIZATION: YOUNG PEOPLE, FROM ORANGE COUNTY TO WASHINGTON, WORRY ABOUT 
REVIVAL OF CONSCRIPTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
As the United States races to assemble its military might in the Saudi Arabian 
desert, separating thousands of troops from their families, phones have been 
ringing off the hooks in Washington, Chicago, San Francisco -- and at the 
Anaheim post office. 
</P>
<P>
The calls have been coming from worried grandparents, parents, girlfriends and 
young men themselves who are asking Selective Service System officials about 
the chances that the draft will be reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
Although there has been no draft since 1973, officials say people are still 
calling, confused about their responsibilities as the nation faces the 
possibility of combat in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the confusion might stem from the fact that an overwhelming number of 
young men between the ages of 18 and 26 have been quietly complying with the 
government's requirement to register with the Selective Service. 
</P>
<P>
A government spokeswoman estimated that compliance nationwide stands at a 
whopping 97% and includes 1.4 million men in California, 53,495 of whom are 
from Orange County; 60,424 from Los Angeles County and 66,326 from San Diego 
County. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers would serve as a pool from which the government could draw if the 
draft is reinstated for an all-out war. 
</P>
<P>
Also looming in the background is a force of 11,000 volunteers who would staff 
more than 2,000 draft boards nationwide and make decisions about requests from 
young men for exemptions, deferments or conscientious-objector status. 
</P>
<P>
One in that volunteer force is Greg Winterbottom, executive director of the 
Orange County Transportation Services Agency, who said he was notified of his 
appointment to Draft Board 160 just a month ago. Board members are appointed by 
the President from nominations made by governors. 
</P>
<P>
Winterbottom, initially approached about his interest in serving eight months 
ago, said: "I really don't know what I'm supposed to do yet." 
</P>
<P>
He also is not sure what geographical area the board will represent or who his 
colleagues are. Yet the 43-year-old Villa Park resident said he expects to 
attend a class at some point that he feels will answer all his questions. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe very strongly in community service. Personally, my life was enhanced 
by military service. I think military service is a reasonable expectation for 
members of a free society." 
</P>
<P>
While there has been little public discussion about reinstating the draft, 
Selective Service spokeswoman Barbi Richardson said it has been business as 
usual for the agency, except for the thousands of telephone calls her office 
has received since troop movements began in August. 
</P>
<P>
"They really run the gamut," Richardson said. "They are parents, young men and 
girlfriends. Some are worried, some are just seeking information. They just 
really want to know how a draft would work. People are concerned. They want to 
know what would happen if there was a return of the draft." 
</P>
<P>
Other questions have come from high school and college newspapers, who want to 
know what their readers' responsibilities are, Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
In Anaheim, Frank Garcia, a window clerk at the post office, which like other 
post offices serves as an intake center for Selective Service applicants, said 
phones there have also been ringing. 
</P>
<P>
"I get a lot of calls from people wanting to know how they can sign up," Garcia 
said. "I seem to be getting calls from grandmothers wanting to know what their 
grandsons should do." 
</P>
<P>
Other Orange County post offices reported little change in their Selective 
Service functions and are continuing to receive draft registrations each week. 
</P>
<P>
In the event of a mobilization, though, Congress and the President would have 
to approve the reinstitution of the draft and area Selective Service offices 
would be established and local draft and appeal boards would be activated. A 
lottery would be conducted to determine the order in which men would be 
drafted. 
</P>
<P>
The first to go would be men 20 years old. Priority groups would then be 
established for those whose birthdays fall in succeeding years and the cycle 
would begin again for those 18 years of age. Those 26 years and older are 
generally considered past their eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Selective Service officials say that they could meet the immediate needs of the 
Defense Department within two weeks of a declared mobilization and 100,000 
could be drafted by the end of the first 30 days, if needed. But officials are 
quick to point out that they have not been notified of plans for mobilization. 
</P>
<P>
"It's part of our readiness," Richardson said of the registration movement and 
the maintenance of volunteer board members. "It's truly business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) said there has been no discussion 
in Congress about reviving the draft. 
</P>
<P>
"I have heard of no suggestion. I don't see the necessity for it," Dannemeyer 
said. "The volunteer service is adequate to meet any test we might face in the 
Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
But in San Francisco, a Selective Service official said some callers are even 
hesitant to take the agency's word that their sons or relatives are safe for 
now because a draft does not exist. 
</P>
<P>
The issue also is generating interest among local young people, especially 
young men who remember registering simply to retain their eligibility for 
student loans and job-training benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Miles, an 18-year-old UC Irvine student from the San Fernando Valley, said 
he received a letter from the Selective Service last month reminding him of the 
requirement to register. Miles said he had not registered within the required 
30 days of his 18th birthday in April. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as all this (troop movement) started happening, they sent me a letter 
saying I had to be registered within 15 days. I knew I was eligible, but I 
didn't get the letter until mid-October . . . since all this stuff started 
happening. 
</P>
<P>
"My girlfriend brought it up last night. She said, 'I don't want you to go.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sam Abed, 23, of Huntington Beach said the issue of military service has become 
topical in his political science class at UCI. He said he registered only after 
getting a series of letters from the Selective Service. 
</P>
<P>
"My grandfather and my uncle fought," Abed said, "so I figured that was enough 
for my family."

MARINES RAM, JAM AND RE-UP 850 AT PENDLETON; 
</P>
<P>
GULF CRISIS: RESERVISTS ARE INSPECTED, INJECTED AND ELECTED FOR DESERT SHIELD 
DUTY. THEY'LL JOIN CORPS' 5TH EXPEDITIONARY BRIGADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The largest mobilization of Marine Corps reservists since the Korean War turned 
Camp Pendleton into a fast-paced "ram and jam" processing center Thursday and 
Friday, when 850 called-up Marines were inspected, injected and instructed. 
</P>
<P>
It took each Marine from 20 units throughout the United States, including 
Orange and San Diego counties, about 45 head-spinning minutes to get ushered 
into active duty, beefing up Camp Pendleton's 5th Marine Expeditionary Brigade 
bound soon for Operation Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
They arrived Thursday, and by the end of Friday, all reservists had been 
checked in, gotten medical screening -- including a test for the HIV virus that 
causes AIDS -- were issued new identification cards and dog tags, and had made 
legal and financial arrangements for their deployment. 
</P>
<P>
"Every Marine who shows up here feels the emotion," said Brig. Gen. Michael 
Neil, who was a San Diego trial lawyer until he was called back to active duty 
to temporarily command Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
"As a reservist, I share it," said Neil, who, as time allows, has been 
personally speaking with the arriving Marines. "Based on my conversations with 
young Marines and senior Marines, they are highly motivated and ready to go. 
That's not just talk on my part." 
</P>
<P>
It has been an abrupt departure from civilian life, and the reservists who went 
through what Lt. Col. Ray Blum dubbed "ram and jam" mobilization processing, 
expressed some common sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
There is trepidation about leaving their jobs for an uncertain period, cautious 
confidence the United States will prevail against Iraq and the Marines patented 
esprit de corps. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bit of a shock when they called me at 2 in the morning and told me 
I've been activated," said 21-year-old Corp. RicSutton, a policeman in 
Chesapeake, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little apprehensive about leaving my job back home, but everybody is," 
said Sutton, who, with a week's notice, is preparing to serve on an amphibious 
assault vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Not knowing whether the Middle East confrontation will burst into war, many 
reservists are concentrating on their orders and trying not to fret about 
combat that might never come. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. John Haymon, 25, a computer specialist from Norfolk, Va., said, "I left 
politics behind" when he was called up, and hopes his emergency military 
service "is going to be a plus for my career." 
</P>
<P>
He's not wringing his hands over the crisis, preferring to believe it will be 
resolved without any killing, so he dreams about the good times he will have 
when it is all over. 
</P>
<P>
"When I get back, I'm going to buy an old Winnebago and travel America," Haymon 
said during a brief stop between processing stations. 
</P>
<P>
Other Marines, especially those who have left families behind, revealed some 
tensions, but hastened to add that as Marines they have lived with the 
knowledge they could be deployed some day. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife, she's not entirely happy, but she's known this could happen," said 
Staff Sgt. Eugene Franklin, 30, a factory supervisor from Virginia. "I really 
don't worry about (deployment). I'm going to wait and see. I'd prefer not to 
have somebody shooting at me, and I hope they can settle it peacefully." 
</P>
<P>
At least, he offered good-naturedly, the Middle East desert bakes in dry heat, 
not the damp humidity he simmers through in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
The reservists were allowed to be briefly interviewed as they shuffled among 
the rows of uninviting, World War II Quonset huts with peeling paint and no 
charm of antiquity. Reporters were barred from talking to the Marines while 
they were inside being processed. 
</P>
<P>
Blum, the executive officer of the mobilization processing center, said the 850 
reservists all were males from reserve combat units who will join the 
amphibious assault brigade. 
</P>
<P>
They are among the 1,144 Marine reservists summoned to active duty, the largest 
reserve call-up since the Korean War 40 years ago, according to Blum. So far, 
it's believed that about 90,000 Marines, nearly half of the entire corps, are 
stationed in the Middle East or are going there. 
</P>
<P>
Blum said the 5th Brigade will ship out soon, although the Marine Corps has 
declined to give a date. "It will be very quickly," Blum said. Navy sources 
have said a fleet of 13 ships loaded with Marines will leave after 
Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
Camp Pendleton, Neil said, is the "focal point" of processing the bulk of the 
reservists, although some will activated at other bases. It was unclear Friday 
whether any additional reservists will arrive at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
If being part of the most significant mobilization in decades is a distinction, 
most of the reservists didn't show it as they coursed through the Quonset huts. 
</P>
<P>
After being checked in, they received dental screening and medical screening, 
receiving shots for influenza, typhoid and tetanus. The Marines took their 
inoculations without grimacing, though some of the news reporters and cameramen 
winced at the sight and walked away. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether any Marines had fainted, a corpsman said, "not today, but last 
night. . . . " He smiled thinly and said no more. 
</P>
<P>
The reservists were issued traditional metal dog tags to hang around their 
necks, and got green active duty identification cards. 
</P>
<P>
Disbursing officials helped them get their financial affairs in order, 
including arranging direct deposit of paychecks and assuring them that 
dependents could draw from checking accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Legal experts made sure the Marines had completed their wills and left behind 
no pressing legal complications.

By the start of next year, children in science classes at Andersen Elementary 
School will be able to watch their teacher perform experiments on a special, 
mirrored lab table. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa High School biology students will study intertidal zones and 
estuaries with special fieldwork labs, and Estancia High School students will 
have access to a computer database with information from more than 200 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
The projects were among those that will be funded by grants from the 
Newport-Mesa Schools Foundation, a nonprofit group that underwrites innovative 
teaching programs. This year, 53 individuals received grants totaling almost 
$40,000. 
</P>
<P>
The projects were singled out for their contributions to academic excellence 
and their practical application in the classroom, according to Reg Fifer, one 
of the foundation directors. 
</P>
<P>
Among them were money for a school nurse to purchase a vision testing kit to 
identify students with early childhood sight problems, the purchase of new 
science books to replace those written before 1960 in one school library, and a 
set of books that teachers hope will help integrate classical literature into a 
kindergarten language arts curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
The grants, donated by the foundation in a lump sum, allow the district to fund 
projects that it cannot afford. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 49 grants given out, 11 went to fund science-related projects. Teachers 
interested in improving computer-teaching tools received 10 of the grants, and 
language arts, elementary reading, math and other projects split the remaining 
grants. Teachers could receive a maximum of $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
According to science teacher Kathleen Schwartz, who will be purchasing a 
rolling, mirrored lab table for her classroom with her grant, smaller projects 
often spark ideas for other teachers across the district. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our precepts is 'Let's get a new idea going,' " said foundation 
President Diana Long. "Then let's see how easy it is to extend that idea 
throughout the entire district." 
</P>
<P>
The foundation started in 1981, in an effort to make up for funds that were 
lost after the passage of Proposition 13. Since then, the foundation has 
distributed more than $450,000 to teacher projects.LAURA MICHAELIS

Local residents Mary and Bob Shackleton were honored Friday by the Coast Guard 
for their August, 1989, rescue of seven stranded sailors. 
</P>
<P>
The Shackletons had been heading home from a Sunday afternoon sail to Santa 
Catalina Island when they spotted a 40-foot powerboat anchored off Avalon with 
smoke coming from the cabin. 
</P>
<P>
As they headed toward the craft, the seven people put on their life vests and 
jumped overboard to escape the flames. 
</P>
<P>
"As it turned out, the owner of the boat was an FBI agent and had about 500 
rounds of ammunition on board," Mary Shackleton said. "That's why they all got 
off the boat so fast." 
</P>
<P>
All seven people escaped unharmed before the "Quentgalic" exploded. The 
Shackletons rescued the group from the water and took them to shore while fire 
boats battled the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
The Shackletons were awarded the Coast Guard Certificate of Merit at a ceremony 
in Long Beach. The award recognizes skill, courage and humanitarianism. LAURA

A survey of Orange County emergency food clients reveals their average monthly 
income is about $250 below poverty level. The survey, conducted by the 
University of California Cooperative Extension's Expanded Food and Nutrition 
Education Program at Fullerton, randomly selected 191 clients of the county's 
soup kitchens (programs that serve hot meals) and food pantries (distributors 
of grocery items or vouchers to buy groceries). 
</P>
<P>
Those interviewed represent both individuals and family members (families with 
children account for 86% of the total client population).

'LAST CHANCE' MAKES DROPOUT DIFFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pedro, 18, was just like dozens of other students that teacher Dorothy Fortune 
had seen before. 
</P>
<P>
He was a gang member, inarticulate in both Spanish and English, and appeared to 
be on the road to nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager had not yet dropped out of high school, but all signs indicated 
that it was only a matter of time before he did. 
</P>
<P>
As a last resort, he was placed in the Student Transition and Retention (STAR) 
program, a joint effort between Rancho Santiago College and the Santa Ana 
Unified School District that tries to help potential high school dropouts chart 
a new course in life. 
</P>
<P>
"When they come to us, it's kind of their last chance," said Fortune, who 
teaches English as a second language to program students. 
</P>
<P>
"Once a kid is 18," she said, "high schools don't have to keep them any longer. 
We tell them that they can finish their education and make something of their 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
The STAR program, which has a successful graduation rate of about 80%, began in 
1988, with a grant from the U.S. Department of Education. Classes for the 
two-year program are held at the college. 
</P>
<P>
The program helps students earn their high school diplomas and provides them 
with vocational job training. Students are also encouraged to transfer to a 
four-year college. 
</P>
<P>
About 75% of those enrolled in STAR are Latinos, the rest of Southeast Asian 
parentage. Most of the students have limited English, which in many cases is 
the root of their academic problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We encourage them," Fortune said, "to overcome the many obstacles they may 
have in their lives, such as the language barrier, economic disadvantages and 
cultural adjustments." 
</P>
<P>
The program has helped about 200 students by offering one-on-one counseling, 
academic course work, vocational training, group advisory meetings and other 
services, such as child care, bus passes and part-time jobs. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify, students must be 17 to 21 years old, one year behind their class 
and have been identified as a potential dropout by assistant principals, 
counselors and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fantastic program," said Robert D. Jensen, chancellor of the Rancho 
Santiago College District. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the strongest, most viable programs in the country that 
effectively deals with the dropout problem," he said. "It's an example of what 
two educational bureaucracies can do when they get together and share resources 
to attack educational issues." 
</P>
<P>
Rudy M. Castruita, superintendent of Santa Ana Unified School District, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Without this program, most of these students would be either dropouts or 
working low-paying jobs," Castruita said. 
</P>
<P>
"They deserve all of the attention we're giving them," Fortune said. "They 
respond to us and are going to be functioning, positive parts of our community. 
That's all we can ask of them." GREG HERNANDEZ

WITNESSES TO POSSIBLE HIT AND RUN SOUGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's Department traffic investigators are seeking the public's assistance 
in locating witnesses to a possible hit-and-run accident that left a bicyclist 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen C. Balcom, 19, of San Clemente was found lying on Coast Highway at 5:48 
p.m. Thursday by a passing motorist, who called 911, sheriff's spokesman Lt. 
Bob Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
Balcom remained unconscious Friday at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center 
in Mission Viejo, suffering from a broken leg, fractures to his face and 
internal injuries, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, we have no real witnesses," Rivas said. "We are really trying to find 
out more about what happened. We need assistance." 
</P>
<P>
Although Rivas said that investigators have not ruled out the possibility that 
Balcom fell off his bike, he said that "we're investigating it as a possible 
hit and run." 
</P>
<P>
Rivas said that a preliminary investigation has concluded only that Balcom was 
riding his bike north along Coast Highway in the city's Capistrano Beach 
section. 
</P>
<P>
He was spotted lying in the road, with his undamaged bicycle a few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
"Other than that, we don't know anything," Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information is asked to call the Sheriff's Department at (714) 
249-5200 and request the traffic division.JAMES M. GOMEZ

STREET-SWEEPING SCHEDULE IS CHANGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city will have a new street-sweeping schedule beginning Monday, officials 
have announced. 
</P>
<P>
Streets will continue to be swept every two weeks, but sweeping will now occur 
the day after scheduled trash pickups. 
</P>
<P>
Streets where trash is collected on Friday will be swept on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, there was no connection between street sweeping and garbage 
collections. 
</P>
<P>
"It made no sense to have a street swept, then have the trash picked up the 
next day or two because if there was a spill, it would sit in the street for 
two weeks," said Danian Hopp, assistant to the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
Street sweeping will continue between 7 a.m. and 3 p.m., except on streets in 
front of high schools. Those streets are swept at 6:30 a.m.

The honors started last month when White, 77, who works in real estate, 
received the annual community service award from the California Assn. of 
Realtors from among 23 nominees statewide. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Anaheim then issued a proclamation in her honor, and the Board of 
Supervisors followed suit last week. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the big shocker," White said of the supervisors' action. "When I was 
asked to come in, I figured I'd get a proclamation. I didn't expect this day in 
my honor." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the tree controversy, White has served on the city parks 
commission, was a founding member of Anaheim Beautiful and helped develop the 
Brookhurst Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
In her years as a real estate agent, she played a role in helping the city 
build Julianna Street Park and the Senior Citzens Park Plaza.

White and her husband, Joe, have lived in Anaheim for 39 years. LISA MASCARO

MWD CHIEF URGES AN END TO WATER WAR; 
</P>
<P>
RESOURCES: CARL BORONKAY SAYS COMPETING FORCES MUST GET TOGETHER TO AVERT 
FUTURE SHORTAGES.

The general manager of the Metropolitan Water District, which serves 15 million 
Southern Californians, on Friday urged competing forces in the ongoing water 
war to come together to solve the problems of future shortages. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a water quality trade association meeting here, Carl Boronkay told 
the audience that a continuing drought, a cutback in the state's share of 
Colorado River water and less than anticipated supplies from Northern 
California will lead to water shortfalls by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is time for a fresh look and a change in mind-set," he told the 300 
persons attending the opening session of the Pacific Water Quality Assn. 
convention at the Anaheim Marriott hotel. "We should now look at the problem as 
all our problems -- the environment problem is my problem and the urban water 
supply problem is the problem of the Environmental Defense Fund and the 
agricultural water needs are the problems of the urban areas and the 
environmentalist." 
</P>
<P>
The competing forces in the battle of water allocation include the urban areas 
and the agricultural areas, environmentalists who want to protect the sources 
of the water, plus the competing regional forces -- those in Northern Californa 
who have the water and those in the south who use it. 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Water District supplies 350,000 acre-feet of water (just over 
half the total in the county) to three of Orange County's largest cities -- 
Anaheim, Santa Ana and Fullerton -- and two large municipal water districts 
that serve smaller cities. (An acre-foot of water equals 326,000 gallons, 
enough to supply two large families for a year.) 
</P>
<P>
California is in its fourth year of drought. Runoff in the Sierra, the main 
source of water, fell to 63% of normal in 1987. It was 60% of normal in 1988 
and 64% last year, and the 1990 total is expected to be less than 63% of 
normal, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
After his speech, Boronkay said that if the drought continues and conservation 
efforts don't work, Orange County, along with other counties in Southern 
California, could "start seeing substantial water shortages." He said water 
used outside the homes for watering grass and washing cars would be the first 
to be cut back. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you want to live that way? Would you like to look outside this hotel and 
see no lawns -- see it all browned out? 
</P>
<P>
"We need to get together. The interests that have opposed each other have all 
suffered. We have to get together and take the collective water problem and 
solve it. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the individual -- you don't even know you're wasting water -- the 
hose is running, the faucet is running. We are used to it as cheap and 
available and it is no longer cheap and available."

Dr. Norman Nixon, a longtime resident who had long and distinguished careers in 
both pediatric medicine and psychiatry, died here Nov. 9 of a stroke. He was 
91. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon, a native of Burlington, Iowa, started his medical career in Los Angeles, 
where he served on the staff of Los Angeles Children's Hospital before moving 
on to private practice in pediatrics in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
While serving as an Army Medical Corps physician at the Santa Ana Army Air Base 
in World War II, Nixon was struck by the number of combat veterans returning 
home with psychological problems, so he turned to psychiatry. After retraining 
at Columbia University in New York, Nixon practiced psychiatry in Philadelphia 
until 1958, when he returned to California and established an office in Laguna 
Beach, where he practiced until 1972. 
</P>
<P>
After three years in Hawaii, Nixon again returned to Orange County and was an 
associate clinical professor of psychiatry at UC Irvine until his retirement in 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon also established himself as a civic leader, serving on the boards of 
directors of the Laguna Playhouse, the Big Brothers of Orange County and the 
Orange County Mental Health Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon was also president of the Laguna Chamber Music Society, an organizer of 
the South Coast Child Guidance Center and a member of the advisory boards of 
the Art Institute of Southern California and the Laguna Beach Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Virginia Bishop Nixon; a son, William Bishop Nixon 
of Santa Barbara; four grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.

L.A. AND O.C. OFFICIALS CLASH OVER CONTROL OF COMMUTER RAIL SYSTEM; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: AT ISSUE IS WHETHER A REGIONAL, JOINT-POWERS AGENCY SHOULD 
OPERATE THE PROPOSED 300-MILE NETWORK OR EACH CORRIDOR SHOULD BE RUN 
SEPARATELY.

<P>
A clash erupted Friday over who should control the commuter rail system planned 
for Southern California beginning in 1992, with a representative of the Los 
Angeles County Transportation Commission objecting to a regional agency and the 
chairman of the Orange County Transportation Commission supporting one. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Lewis, an alternate for County Supervisor Pete Schabarum on the Los 
Angeles commission, said he opposes any "SCAG for commuter rail," a reference 
to the Southern California Assn. of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis told a meeting of transportation officials from four Southland counties, 
who gathered to consider how the commuter rail system will be run, that he 
fears an administrative morass in which, he contended, San Bernardino commuters 
finding that something was wrong would have to call Orange County for help. 
</P>
<P>
But Dana Reed, the Orange County commission chairman, said he disagreed and 
hopes that a joint-powers agency will be created as early as next month by Los 
Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties to operate the proposed 
300-mile system. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about 100 or so trains a day," Reed said. "We are going to have 
to switch equipment between San Bernardino and Orange, if necessary, or Ventura 
and Orange. We're going to have to share a common maintenance facility. We 
certainly don't need four or five operating agencies." 
</P>
<P>
"Who answers the phone? That's what I want to know," Lewis rejoined. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to have common authority," Reed answered. "One of the problems we have 
in Southern California now is so many agencies running things like the buses. 
If we set up five separate agencies to run commuter rail, it won't work." 
</P>
<P>
"There's no proof there is an advantage in having a single operator," Lewis 
argued. He said that each proposed corridor, such as Los Angeles-San 
Bernardino, should be controlled separately. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, a member of the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission who was 
also present, Jacki Bacharach, a Rancho Palos Verdes city councilwoman, said 
that despite Lewis' statements at the meeting, the Los Angeles commission has, 
as yet, taken no position on who should control the commuter rail system. 
</P>
<P>
"My personal opinion is we are on the brink of an opportunity to establish a 
unified network," she said. 
</P>
<P>
If a joint-powers agency is established, Ventura County is unlikely to be part 
of it, officials at the meeting said, since that county has no available 
transit funds to contribute to the system, even though there are plans for 
trains to Moorpark and possibly Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Reed said that if a joint-powers agency is formed, there must first be an 
agreement on representation. If it is by population, he said, Los Angeles 
County would have majority control, which might not be acceptable to the other 
counties. Perhaps, he said, representation could be allocated on the basis of 
track mileage or another standard. 
</P>
<P>
Among the commuter links proposed as part of the system, besides those to 
Ventura County, are lines radiating from Los Angeles to Santa Clarita, points 
in Orange County, San Bernardino and Riverside. There would also be service 
between San Bernardino and Riverside and Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Participants in Friday's meeting also heard a cautiously optimistic report on 
the status of negotiations to buy public control of at least 177 miles of Santa 
Fe right of way and rights to run trains on another 70 miles.

JUDGE CONVICTS TEEN OF MURDER IN FIRST DEGREE

A juvenile gang member has been convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy 
in the drive-by shooting death of a teen-ager on a Garden Grove street in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen-year-old Mario Pena was the first of three suspects to be tried for the 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
He was convicted by Superior Court Judge Phillip Cox at West County Court, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Avdeef said. 
</P>
<P>
On April 30, the victim, 17-year-old Rosendo Ibarra, was talking at a pay 
telephone on Katella Avenue between the Panaderia Sonoria, a bakery, and the 
American-Mexican Video Store when he was shot once in the head. 
</P>
<P>
Avdeef said the shooting was retaliation for an earlier attack that left gang 
member Baltazar Medina wounded in the leg. Ibarra was a member of a rival gang 
that reportedly executed that attack. 
</P>
<P>
He will be sentenced Dec. 14, and could face incarceration at the California 
Youth Authority until he is 25. Because of his age, he could not be tried as an 
adult, according to Garden Grove Police Investigator Mike Handfield. 
</P>
<P>
The two other men will be tried in early December in connection with the 
murder, Handfield said.

PACESETTER HOMES POSTS $1.8-MILLION 3RD-QUARTER LOSS; 
</P>
<P>
CONSTRUCTION: THE BUILDER OF LOW- AND MID-PRICED SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES BLAMED A 
CONTINUING SOFT MARKET AND A VOLUNTARY WRITE-DOWN ON THE VALUE OF SEVERAL 
HUNDRED LOTS.

Pacesetter Homes Inc. said Friday that it lost $1.8 million in the third 
quarter, contrasted with net income of $2.7 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The company said a continuing soft market for new homes caused revenue for the 
period to fall 60% to $11.1 million from $27.6 million in the third quarter of 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Pacesetter posted a net loss of $2.2 
million, down from a $2.9-million profit in the corresponding period in 1989. 
Revenue declined 32% to $34.6 million from $51 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Pacesetter Homes builds low- and mid-priced single-family residences throughout 
Southern California. It also develops land for sale to other builders, 
according to Dave Reese, vice president and chief financial officer of the 
publicly traded company. 
</P>
<P>
Reese said the third-quarter loss came mainly from a voluntary write-down of 
the value of several hundred finished lots that the company owns in projects in 
Palmdale and Nevada. In the current housing market, Reese said, the value of 
the lots, which Pacesetter intends to sell to other builders, is no longer as 
high as shown on Pacesetter's books. 
</P>
<P>
The company is still building and selling homes in Riverside and San Diego 
counties, and Reese said that while sales have slowed considerably, "they still 
are doing OK." 
</P>
<P>
Like most builders, however, the company's cost of selling homes has jumped 
because of price cuts and other incentives intended to lure buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock closed at $5.50 a share on the over-the-counter market 
Friday, unchanged for the day.

Developers may think they've tried just about everything to line up a financial 
backer in these troubled times, but they probably haven't yet resorted to 
videotape. But if a local company has its way, developers will soon be starring 
in videos that could probably be titled "It Came From a Tustin Industrial 
Park." 
</P>
<P>
A perky press release from a company called Global Video Marketing in Costa 
Mesa says it will put a videotape of clients' real estate projects into the 
hands of people all over the world with money to invest. The company claims 
that at least two local developers have profited this way. 
</P>
<P>
"Video is the ideal medium for reaching out to the individuals, institutions 
and syndications of sophisticated financiers worldwide who are investing in 
American real estate," says Gene Growbridge of Global Video. 
</P>
<P>
But if you're a developer in search of money, be sure and wear your best suit. 
One of the big selling points of video, says Global, is that the potential 
investor not only gets a good picture of your project but also of you. 
</P>
<P>
"In real estate, the first thing you're selling is yourself, not your building 
for sale or a joint venture opportunity," says Daniel Hopsicker, another Global 
Video executive.

OCEAN PACIFIC PLANS TO REACQUIRE RIGHTS TO JIMMY 'Z LINE

Ocean Pacific Swimwear Ltd., a Tustin surf-wear maker, said Friday that it 
plans to reacquire the Jimmy'Z surf-wear trademark that it sold to another 
Tustin firm, 199Z Inc., last April. 
</P>
<P>
"199Z has been unable to meet its obligation to (Ocean Pacific)," said Jim 
Jenks, Ocean Pacific's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
"(Ocean Pacific) will reacquire the trademark and oversee the brand going 
forward." 
</P>
<P>
"It is our understanding that 199Z Inc. intends to complete its (current) 
holiday shipping," Jenks said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of 199Z could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
199Z, a Tustin surf-wear maker, purchased the Jimmy'Z line for an undisclosed 
amount of cash and notes. Ocean Pacific took an ownership interest in the 
Jimmy'Z trademark pending repayment of the notes by 199Z. When 199Z was unable 
to pay off the notes by the due date, ownership of the trademark reverted back 
to Ocean Pacific, said Michael Balmages, Ocean Pacific's general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, Ocean Pacific is required to conduct a foreclosure sale of the 
Jimmy'Z trademark, Balmages said. The sale is set for Nov. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Balmages said Ocean Pacific, which hopes to acquire the trademark itself, has 
received inquiries from seven prospective buyers. He said, however, that Ocean 
Pacific would be willing to sell the trademark for the right price. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean Pacific will take over distribution of Jimmy'Z merchandise in the spring, 
Jenks said. 
</P>
<P>
If Ocean Pacific retains the Jimmy'Z trademark, it would operate it separately 
from the rest of its licensing business, including the Ocean Pacific and 
Newport Blue brands, Balmages said. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean Pacific, which in recent years has shifted from manufacturing to 
licensing its products, acquired Jimmy'Z in November, 1987, from Jimmy Ganzer 
and Sepp Donahower, founders of the trendy surf-wear maker. 
</P>
<P>
Balmages said Ocean Pacific expects sales to surpass $300 million in 1990.

ARTS: ANXIOUS TO 'CORRECT ANY MISCONCEPTION,' A SOUTH COAST REPERTORY DIRECTOR 
DECIDES HE WILL SPEAK AFTER ALL AT AN LA SESSION ON FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION.

COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A top official at South Coast Repertory has said he will speak after all today 
at a major meeting of state arts officials on the subject of freedom of 
expression. And representatives of the Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse, who had been 
considering an invitation to speak, have decided to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
They will join a panel called "The Fight for Freedom of Expression" at the 
annual convention of the California Confederation of the Arts, the state's 
largest arts advocacy organization, at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, when it appeared that no representatives of either troupe 
might attend, confederation officials said that discussion of recent arts 
controversies in Costa Mesa -- the only Orange County issue on the agenda -- 
would be deleted. 
</P>
<P>
David Emmes, SCR's producing artistic director, had declined the 
confederation's invitation to speak, asserting that he had been given 
inadequate notice and was "completely unaware" of the panel's subject when the 
invitation was relayed to him through an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
But Friday, after The Times reported his decision, Emmes said he would appear 
on the panel. He said he had been made aware of "the importance of the issue to 
be discussed" and wanted "to correct any misconception about SCR's advocacy for 
artistic freedom." 
</P>
<P>
Informed of Emmes' initial decision, a prominent arts advocate had charged that 
SCR had been "spineless" and tried to "avoid confrontation" in July when the 
Costa Mesa City Council approved arts-grant restrictions banning the use of 
city money for obscenity or religious or political activity. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions were imposed after a Costa Mesa resident complained that SCR, 
a recipient of city grants, had inserted flyers into programs urging support of 
the National Endowment for the Arts, under attack by conservatives for funding 
allegedly obscene or sacrilegious artworks. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Chester, a political consultant and co-founder of the 2,000-member 
National Campaign for Freedom of Expression, had said that the Tony 
award-winning theater troupe had rejected his offer to help organize a large 
protest at a council meeting on the grant restrictions, and to arrange national 
publicity for the protest. 
</P>
<P>
Emmes has acknowledged that he rejected Chester's offer, but on Friday he 
insisted that SCR has participated in the nationwide debate on public arts 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran two different (pro-NEA) essays in our program," he said, ". . . and we 
understand they were distributed to certain members of Congress. Plus, even 
after the whole stink about the (program flyers), we printed and inserted a 
second flyer. 
</P>
<P>
"So it seems to me that Mr. Chester is not fully informed about what was going 
on. We've never ducked an artistic issue." 
</P>
<P>
Civic Playhouse officials had said earlier that the distance between Costa Mesa 
and Los Angeles might make attendance at the convention difficult. 
</P>
<P>
But Friday, board member Judy Sharp said that having a voice at the convention, 
where about 300 arts leaders from throughout the state are expected, is 
crucial. She said that she and board President Eleanor Rey would be speaking. 
</P>
<P>
"Non-participation," Sharp said, "would be a form of censorship." 
</P>
<P>
The playhouse, a community group that receives Costa Mesa subsidies, was thrust 
into the local and nationwide arts funding debate with its production of 
Christopher Durang's satire "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You." 
</P>
<P>
The play, staged after the City Council imposed its restrictions, offered the 
first test of the new policy when residents complained that Durang's work is 
"anti-Christian bigotry." The City Council found that the play did not violate 
the policy, though individual council members indicated that the theater's 
future may have been marred by the imbroglio.

IRVINE MEADOWS WINS 1990 BOOKING WAR; 
</P>
<P>
COMPETITION: BUT TAKE AWAY THE SYMPHONY SERIES, FREE CONCERTS AND AN OUTSIDE 
EVENT, THE ORANGE COUNTY CONCERT DUEL ENDED IN A TIE. 
</P>

Cigarettes and the symphonies provided the margin of difference that made 
Irvine Meadows the busier of Orange County's two large outdoor concert 
amphitheaters in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Meadows hosted 42 concerts during a long outdoor season that began March 
3 with a Tom Petty concert at the Pacific Amphitheatre and ends tonight with a 
show by Basia, also at the Pacific. That show will bring the Pacific's final 
concert tally for the year to 30. Each amphitheater staged 36 concerts in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But take away the Pacific Symphony's five-concert summer residency at Irvine 
Meadows, the series of six free pop concerts sponsored by Parliament cigarettes 
and one Christian rock concert put on by an outside promoter, and Irvine 
Meadows and the Pacific finished in a dead heat for 1990 with 30 paid, in-house 
pop promotions each. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, executives for both amphitheaters said, it was not a strong year, but 
it did bring gains over the slack season of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Total 1990 attendance at Irvine Meadows was "a click over 400,000," up from 
about 360,000 in 1989, said Robert Geddes, the amphitheater's managing partner. 
Alex Hodges, vice president in charge of West Coast concerts for the 
Nederlander Organization, which operates the Pacific, said attendance totaled 
about 325,000 this year, an improvement over the announced 1989 total of 
300,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It was lean year for everybody, but we feel confident we got our share," said 
Geddes. 
</P>
<P>
"We had fewer shows than the year before, but our gross sales were up," noted 
Hodges. He said attendance averaged about 10,800 fans per concert. "I was real 
pleased with that figure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Meadows hosted three pop acts that were strong enough draws to play 
multiple-night stands. Whitesnake and Phil Collins played two nights each, 
while Oingo Boingo played three consecutive nights. At the Pacific, Janet 
Jackson and New Kids on the Block both had two-night stands. Rush also 
headlined twice in Orange County, playing the Pacific in April, then returning 
in June to play Irvine Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
The two amphitheaters have waged high-stakes bidding wars to lure pop acts away 
from each other ever since 1983, when the 18,765-capacity Pacific opened in 
Costa Mesa to challenge the 15,000-capacity Irvine Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides say back-and-forth auctions for performers' services have eroded 
profits or led to losses. This year, Hodges said, the Pacific tried limit the 
bidding. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we could have had a few more shows if we'd opened the checkbook," he 
said. "But there's no point in running a show if you're going to lose money. 
We're being aggressive, but we're trying to keep our head on our shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
Geddes, however, said that he noticed no change in his competitor's tactics. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't paying lesser guarantees. We were paying (as much) or more than we 
ever did before" because of aggressive counter-bidding by the Pacific, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific management's most aggressive bid of the season came in the spring, 
when it tried to acquire a majority share of the stock in Irvine Meadows, a 
move that would have ended the amphitheaters' competition. But antitrust 
lawyers from the U.S. Justice Department blocked the buyout attempt, ruling 
that it would create an illegal monopoly in the Orange County concert market. 
Geddes, who had fought to prevent the merger, then brought record industry 
mogul Irving Azoff into the Irvine Meadows partnership, which also includes 
developer Donald M. Koll. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific officials were more pleased with the outcome of a longstanding lawsuit 
in which Costa Mesa neighbors tried to restrict the amphitheater's sound 
output. Although the case ended with the establishment of noise guidelines, 
they call for levels that Pacific officials say they can meet without limiting 
rock bands' freedom to play at their usual concert volumes. 
</P>
<P>
The outlook for 1991 is competition as usual, Hodges and Geddes said. 
</P>
<P>
"Both venues will do about 40 (pop concerts) each next year," Hodges predicted. 
"There'll be some good acts out." 
</P>
<P>
"It should be a little stronger next year," Geddes agreed. "Bigger names, and 
more of them."

'DANGEROUS' APPEARANCE BY BILL HICKS; 
</P>
<P>
COMEDY: THE FORMER MEMBER OF THE TEXAS OUTLAW COMICS IS SLATED TO PERFORM AT 
THE IRVINE IMPROV ON MONDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Comedian Bill Hicks performed his first stand-up comedy routine at a Baptist 
Bible camp talent show when he was 13, borrowing freely from Woody Allen's 
self-deprecating, nebbish routine. You know -- jokes like being breast-fed from 
falsies. 
</P>
<P>
But now Bill Hicks is "dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
That's how the alumnus of the so-called Texas Outlaw Comics is being billed 
these days. It also, not coincidentally, is the title of his debut comedy album 
released last spring. 
</P>
<P>
And just how "dangerous" is Hicks, who will perform at the Improv in Irvine 
Monday night? Here's Hicks, roaming the stage, smoking cigarettes and liberally 
seasoning his observations with obscenities, on: 
</P>
<P>
* His drinking days: "I'd get pulled over by the cops and I'd be so drunk I'd 
be dancing to their lights, thinking I'd made it to another club: 'Turn the 
music up! Hey, what is this, a leather bar?' " 
</P>
<P>
* Small Southern towns: "You know in many parts of our troubled world people 
are yelling, 'Revolution! Revolution!' In Tennessee, they're yelling, 
'Evolution! We want our thumbs!' The thing is they see people with thumbs on TV 
all day. That's gotta drive them hog wild." 
</P>
<P>
* Nonsmokers: "A bunch of whining little maggots. Aren't they? Obnoxious, 
self-righteous slugs. I'd quit smoking if I didn't think I'd become one of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
* Drugs: 'Drugs are so bad.' 'Drugs are so bad.' Yeah, yeah. Well how come 
Keith Richards still walks? Explain that Mr. Surgeon General! You never hear 
the Surgeon General mention Keith, do ya? Aha! A little hole in the theory 
there." 
</P>
<P>
As Hicks sees his "dangerous" appellation, it all has to do with "freedom." 
</P>
<P>
"The origin of that title came from a Thomas Jefferson quote," Hicks explained 
in a phone interview. "His quote was 'No idea is dangerous to society wherein 
that idea can be openly discussed.' That's why the album is called 'Dangerous,' 
because I'm discussing drugs and things drugs do." 
</P>
<P>
A former drug user himself, Hicks maintains he is not promoting drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm saying I did have some good times on drugs, so don't say they're all bad 
like they do on the commercial. . . . Alcohol is the No. 1 offender and there 
are alcohol ads on TV right after the (anti-drug) drug commercial. Tell me 
about mixed messages. That's my point. Get off my back." 
</P>
<P>
Hicks added that the "dangerous" label also applies "to fascists and 
fundamentalists and puritanicals" who undoubtedly "would view my act as 
dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Described by one critic as "a firebrand who seems on the verge of 
self-immolation as he uses his incendiary wit to torch American hypocrisy," 
Hicks obviously has found his comedy niche. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based comedian was in Chicago last week to tape his first 
television comedy special. He expects the show, which will air on HBO in 1991, 
to give him a big career boost. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real good for me because, first off, you'll get to see the real me on 
stage, without the network restrictions," said Hicks, who has appeared several 
times on "Late Night With David Letterman," where he has had to tone down his 
act. 
</P>
<P>
The Bill Hicks that network television audiences have seen is not the same Bill 
Hicks comedy club audiences see. "It's like you see Richard Pryor on Carson," 
he said. "Is that the real Richard Pryor? Well, to a degree." 
</P>
<P>
Hicks, who sneaked out of the house to hang out at a comedy club when he was in 
high school, moved to Los Angeles to become a comedian in 1980 when he was 18. 
He began developing his own comedy voice on stage at the Comedy Store. 
</P>
<P>
"I was loosening up a lot and trying to be natural and organic," he recalled. 
"I'd talk about anything I felt like. I tried to keep it very personal, which I 
still do." 
</P>
<P>
Hicks moved back to Texas in 1982, where he joined a group of like-minded 
comedians who performed at the Comedy Workshop, a Houston comedy club that 
earlier spawned Sam Kinison. 
</P>
<P>
"We formed a group called the Outlaw Comics and did theme shows like 'Outlaw 
Comics Get Religion,' 'Outlaw Comics Get Political,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We really had a love of comedy and we strove to be original. That was the 
hallmark -- not gigs, not how much we were getting paid. We had no respect for 
hack sellouts." 
</P>
<P>
Hicks, who has been compared to Lenny Bruce, said he thinks "highly" of the 
legendary free-speaking comic. 
</P>
<P>
"What I like about him is his spirit of honesty," he said. "He was totally 
honest about what he was feeling and going through. That's what I endeavor to 
do: to be honest and real. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care if you're obscene, filthy, horrendous -- as long as you're 
honest." 
</P>
<P>
Hicks maintains that he doesn't do anything in his act just for shock value. As 
for the use of four-letter words, he said: "It's the way I talk. I don't think 
any of the material relies on them. . . . (Profanity) is not the punch line. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing," he said, "is I want to open everybody's mind up to how to 
look at the world. That's all: to show that there are other ways to see things 
and here are a few of them." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
"Keith Richards outlived Jim Fixx, the runner and health-nut dude. . . . The 
plot thickens. . . . Keith Richards is shooting heroin into his eyeballs and 
still touring, all right? I'm getting mixed signals. I picture nuclear war and 
two things surviving: Keith and bugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Hicks will appear at 8:30 p.m. Monday at the Improv, 4255 Campus Drive, 
Irvine. Tickets: $8. Information: (714) 854-5455.

A NEW ENVIRONMENT FOR MOULD; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: THE FORMER MEMBER OF HUSKER DU HAS TURNED INWARD WITH HIS 'BLACK SHEETS 
OF RAIN,' WHICH EXPRESSES A PERIOD OF TRANSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"The fish in all the streams are dying, fluorocarbons fill the sky, and I don't 
really want to die before my time has come," Bob Mould writes in his latest 
single, "It's Too Late." 
</P>
<P>
Has Mould channeled his desperate Angst, galvanized throughout and beyond his 
Husker Du days, into a blistering crusade to save the Earth? Has the recent 
greening of pop music seeped into Mould's songwriting too? 
</P>
<P>
Well, he says, it's not that simple -- or that dogmatic. 
</P>
<P>
On the title track of his new "Black Sheets of Rain" album, from which the 
single is drawn, he elaborates on the subject, wondering, "Is there an upside 
to every downside?" 
</P>
<P>
The record is flecked with hints of environmentalism, which, he says, reflects 
a longtime awareness and reverence of his natural surroundings. That sentiment, 
he said, fermented during the 18 months he lived on a Minnesota farm, while 
sorting through the ashes of Husker Du's sour collapse of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
And, upon moving to New York last year, "it became obvious to me that a lot of 
things were going wrong" with the planet, he said during a telephone interview 
this week from Sacramento, where his current U.S. tour had stopped. "It's not 
so much New York City itself, but the amount of decay you see all around you." 
</P>
<P>
But don't expect to see Mould doing one of those MTV save-the-planet spots. 
</P>
<P>
In "Black Sheets," for example, he raises the other side of what is usually 
painted as a tedious working-class existence of blue-collar towns that are 
mired in pollutants and drudgery. He said the song was inspired by his visit to 
Cleveland steel mills to get a firsthand glimpse of the workers and their 
squalid daily surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
"And I walked away from it really disliking the environmentalists," Mould said. 
Granted, the mills poison our rivers and sully our skies, he said, "but these 
workers have to have a way to survive. If all these things (environmentalists) 
wanted to go away went away, what would happen?" 
</P>
<P>
The silver-lining theme is one that has surfaced intermittently through Mould's 
work, both with and without his Husker mates. 
</P>
<P>
It also could well serve as a thesis statement on his career since the 
Minneapolis trio vaporized. 
</P>
<P>
Although Husker Du's abrupt demise marked the end of one of the 
alternative-rock bands of the past decade, Mould, like his former songwriting 
cohort in the band, Grant Hart, has since embarked upon an intriguing, dynamic 
new musical endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
For Mould, that artistic excursion has been decidedly inward. 
</P>
<P>
His 1989 solo debut, "Workbook," boiled his Husker despair down to a deeply 
personal concentrate, which he vented with a heavy dose of melancholy and a 
smattering of fury. 
</P>
<P>
As for "Black Sheets," he said the songs illustrate a cathartic expression of a 
trying period of transition. But that centered on his relocation from the farm 
to Minneapolis and his subsequent move to the East Coast, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a wrapping up of a series of events," he said, which included "some 
pretty bad relationships, and seeing friends of mine in pretty bad 
relationships." 
</P>
<P>
Musically, whereas he employed acoustic and electric guitars, assorted 
percussion, keyboards, the mandolin and the cello on "Workbook," his new record 
is a return to Huskerian basics: a driving drum and bass, combusted with 
Mould's scorching guitar/vocal assault. 
</P>
<P>
"Black Sheets" is also the product of a cohesive band, rather than a Bob Mould 
solo project with mere studio accompanyment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In his new trio, Mould is joined by Pere Ubu bassist Tony Maimone and Golden 
Palominos drummer Anton Fier. 
</P>
<P>
Maimone and Fier appeared on "Workbook," but they took shape as a group during 
Mould's tour last year in support of that album, he said. And their more 
physical treatment of those songs during live performances forged the sound 
exploited on the new record. 
</P>
<P>
His new record and tour -- which includes stops tonight at the Embassy Theater 
in Los Angeles, Sunday at the Ventura Theater and Monday at the Coach House in 
San Juan Capistrano -- "brings things to a head for me," he said. "It's a 
culmination of what this band can do." 
</P>
<P>
Mould seems to harbor little regret or anguish anymore over Husker Du's 
breakup. But it is still too soon for him to evaluate the impact the post-punk 
vanguards had on music, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Husker Du "spoke of a certain time and place and what three people were 
thinking about," he said. "You can say it was a reaction to the Reagan years 
and the collapse of the music industry in 1980. A lot of ideas were brought 
into that band." 
</P>
<P>
While he finds it "flattering" that a flurry of young bands today have borrowed 
heavily from his old group's style, he said he is most proud of the example 
Husker Du set by jumping from an independent company to a major label, Warner 
Bros., without auctioning off the band's ideals. 
</P>
<P>
"I see that sentiment coming up more with newer bands, and that's the most 
important thing we contributed, I think," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Only occasionally does he speak anymore with his ex-bandmates. However, he says 
his widely publicized feud with Hart was exaggerated and has since cooled. Soon 
after Hart's debut solo effort, "Intolerance," was released last year, Hart 
"cornered me and made me listen to it," Mould said. 
</P>
<P>
His critique? "That's the music he hears now, and I wish him well." 
</P>
<P>
Husker Du's bassist, Greg Norton, who has been playing clubs in and around 
Minneapolis with his new band, visited after one of Mould's shows earlier this 
year, Mould said. 
</P>
<P>
Norton wanted to say hello, and talk about the prospects of re-releasing some 
of the Huskers' early material. 
</P>
<P>
Mould cringed. "I just told him, 'Look, I'm in the middle of a tour. Maybe 
someday we can reissue those old records, but right now, I gotta get to 
Madison.' " 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his solo projects, Mould has produced records by a pair of 
promising, upcoming bands, the Zulus and Friction Wheel. 
</P>
<P>
After his tour concludes next week in San Diego, Mould said he plans to return 
to New York to "take a break from the treadmill. I know when I've had enough. . 
. . I want to take some time to sit back and reorganize what I want to do from 
here." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to weighing his next step musically, Mould said he hopes to 
experiment with other artistic outlets, perhaps film or photography. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people I respect in those fields have suggested I do some things in those 
areas," he said. "A part of me has always been curious about these things. I 
have a lot of ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"(And) I think it could be a real learning experience -- which is ultimately 
what I'm always looking for." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Mould performs with Firehose at 8 p.m. Monday at the Coach House, 33157 
Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. (714) 496-8930. Tickets are $18.50.

ASK THE HANDYMAN: HOW TO GET MORE MILEAGE FROM GARDEN RUBBISH? COMPOST IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: What's the best way to turn grass clippings and leaves into compost? 
Do I need to buy any kind of additives? 
</P>
<P>
M.N., Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
Answer: "You'll need to build some kind of chicken wire or screen cage to put 
in your back yard," says Kelly Kong-Green of Flowerdale Nursery in Costa Mesa. 
"Try to find an inconspicuous place for it, since it will smell, then fill it 
with your leaves and clippings. You can even put things like banana peels, 
apple cores, any kind of fruit or vegetables. Then cover it with newspaper or 
plastic to help it retain heat and turn it or mix it every few months until 
it's fully decayed. 
</P>
<P>
"You can add aluminum sulfate to speed up the decaying process, but it's not 
really necessary. Composting occurs faster when there's some humidity in the 
air, so if it's been dry for a while, try wetting your pile down and covering 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Q: In paneling a room, I'd like to know how to make exactly the right hole for 
the electrical, phone and cable outlets. I'm afraid of just guesstimating, 
because I may end up with a hole that's not right on target. 
</P>
<P>
B.B., Westminster 
</P>
<P>
A: "Try putting the outlet screws in their holes just enough so they're 
straight," says carpenter Brad Martin of La Mirada. "Then put a little paint on 
the screw heads, line up the panel where it's going to be placed and press it 
against the wall and the outlet. When you pull the panel off again, you find 
the paint left by the outlet screws and, from there, you can make an outline of 
the hole you'll need to make." 
</P>
<P>
Q: I'm starting to repair some old chairs we have. In looking for materials, 
I've noticed both white and yellow carpenter's glue. What's the difference 
between the two and wouldn't a hot-glue gun be better than either of those? 
</P>
<P>
L.O., Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
A: "Yellow glue has special resins in it that make it set faster," says Robert 
Espland of Espland Furniture Repair in Orange. "When I have a gluing job that's 
a little tricky, and I'm not sure I can get the clamps on it right away, I'll 
use the white glue, because it gives you about five minutes before it really 
sets. With the yellow glue, you have about a minute. 
</P>
<P>
"The glue gun glues are really a mistake when you're working with wood. They're 
never fully dry, and they stay rubbery. And when you're doing a glue job, 
remember the most important thing is not the glue but your clamps. It's the 
pressure applied to the job, not the amount of glue used that makes the

Q: I've got to replace the fill valves in both toilets in our home. While I've 
heard that those plastic valves work great, they look cheap. Should I get one 
or should I stick with the brass-type valve that I'm replacing?

A: "The good plastic-fill valves have just one moving part, and while they 
might look cheap, they're really good quality," says Dave Van de Aveer of 
Tustin Hardware. "They adjust to fit almost any toilet, and they're real simple 
to install. Not only that, they're a lot cheaper than the old-fashioned valves, 
now that the price of brass has gone up."

Photo, Neo Bedroom: Coordination of color and fabric is the key to decorating 
today's bedroom, Ron Splude says. Since the bed is the focal point of the room, 
says Splude, design director for Du Pont interior textiles, you should select a 
bedspread or comforter with a rich, colorful pattern. Choose sheets in a 
coordinating style -- perhaps pin-stripes or a small floral design to accent a 
bold floral print. Splude says to create a more luxurious-looking bed, combine 
at least six pillows and add a pair of oblong or square boudoir pillows with 
shams and cases that are compatible with the sheets and comforter.

WICKER WITCHCRAFT: EASY CARE AND REPAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If you have wicker furniture in your home or on the porch, you already know how 
to enjoy it, but do you know how to take care of it? 
</P>
<P>
Here's how to help your wicker retain its looks and charm: 
</P>
<P>
Care and Cleaning: 
</P>
<P>
* You can wash rattan and willow wicker with soapy water using a soft brush for 
crevices. If the wicker becomes brittle, drenching it with water helps restore 
it. 
</P>
<P>
* Rush, sea grass or fiber (twisted paper) should only be wiped now and then 
with a damp cloth. 
</P>
<P>
* Vacuum wicker regularly with the brush attachment. 
</P>
<P>
* For in-between dusting, try a soft, slightly dampened paint brush. 
</P>
<P>
* Wash painted wicker with warm, soapy water and a damp sponge. Don't use an 
abrasive cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
* For stained wicker, spray furniture cleaner on a clean, dry cloth and wipe 
all surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
* Keep wicker well away from a fireplace, stove or radiator. 
</P>
<P>
* Bring wicker furniture indoors during freezing weather. 
</P>
<P>
Repairing: 
</P>
<P>
* For pliability, soak new strands of rattan and wicker in warm water for at 
least 10 minutes and weave them while they are wet. 
</P>
<P>
* To repair worn wicker: Remove the damaged strand. From the underside, anchor 
the end of the new strand next to the end of the old strand. Working from 
above, weave the new strand through the spokes in the existing pattern. 
</P>
<P>
* To repair rattan wrapping: Strip off the old rattan. Tie one end of new 
rattan temporarily into place with string; start wrapping the other end over 
the tied end. Remove the string once the wrapping holds the first end in place. 
To complete wrapping, tuck the second end up through the last few rows of 
wrapping. Pull the end tight and trim. Secure the end with a tack. 
</P>
<P>
Refinishing: 
</P>
<P>
* If rattan or willow has accumulated many coats of unsightly paint, consider 
having it stripped by a professional. To do the job yourself, work outdoors and 
use a semi-paste stripper, following manufacturer's directions. Be sure to 
scrub off all traces of the stripper using a stiff-bristle brush dipped into 
detergent and water. 
</P>
<P>
* If the piece is unfinished, clean it first to remove grease, wax and dirt. 
Let it dry thoroughly before applying finish. For a light, natural finish, 
spray on polyurethane or clear lacquer from an aerosol can. For a darker 
finish, use a stain before applying the finish. 
</P>
<P>
* Wicker can also be painted any color you choose. Aerosol plastic resin enamel 
works best. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how to paint wicker or apply a clear finish: 
</P>
<P>
* Work outdoors on a warm, dry day. 
</P>
<P>
* Create a screen to confine spray. A large appliance box with the front cut 
off works well. 
</P>
<P>
* Hold the spray can about 12 inches away. Practice first on newspaper to get 
the feel of the sprayer. Then start at the top and sweep across in one 
continuous motion. Spray inside surfaces first, then sides and top. 
</P>
<P>
* Apply two or three thin coats, allowing each to dry thoroughly.

SINGLE-FAMILY HOME FUTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With most of the year gone, single family home building futures continue in the 
doldrums. Although September (the most recent month for which information is 
available) was the third most active month of 1990, with 433 such permits 
issued, the nine-month total was 53% less than 1989's comparable figure and 
even lower contrasted with 1986-88. 
</P>
<P>
While the major declines so far have occurred primarily in South County 
unincorporated areas and in Mission Viejo, some cities in the northern half 
show big negative comparisons -- namely Anaheim, Orange and Yorba Linda. 
Newport Beach and Cypress are the sites of the largest increases. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how the cities stack up, listed from the largest decrease to the largest 
increase in permits issued:
